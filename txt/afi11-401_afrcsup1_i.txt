  RESPONSIBILITY AND OBLIGATIONS, FLIGHT AUTHORIZATIONS, AND FOREIGN
                           MILITARY FLYING

Section 1A—Responsibilities and Obligations

1.1. Who Must Comply. The policies and requirements of this instruction apply to all personnel (both
active and inactive aircrew members, operational support members and other authorized personnel) who
fly onboard Air Force aircraft. In addition, it provides guidance on the Jump Record Folder (JRF), Avia-
tion Service Codes (ASC), and flight authorization codes in Table A2.3. for Air Force parachutists. Fur-
ther guidance on parachutist policies and requirements can be found in AFI 11-410, Personnel Parachute
Operations.
1.1. (AFRC) Who Must Comply. This supplement applies to Air Reserve Technicians (ART) and
non-ART civilian aircrew members according to their employment conditions and job description.

1.2. Responsibilities of HQ USAF/XOO. The Director of Operations and Training (HQ USAF/XOO)
establishes and monitors the Air Force flying program as outlined in this instruction to ensure effective
use of resources.

1.3. Responsibilities of MAJCOMs. MAJCOM commanders, through their staffs, must provide guid-
ance, criteria, and supervision to their subordinate organizations to establish a system to carry out the
requirements of this instruction and to meet training and operational needs of the US Air Force. They
must prohibit any agency or unit from operating or maintaining an aircraft that does not have an estab-
lished system program director. For example, aircraft procured through non-DoD resources will not be
flown or operated by USAF units without MAJCOM approval.
1.3. (AFRC) Responsibilities of MAJCOMs. AFRC flying units will comply with this supplement and
with the directives of the command with oversight responsibilities.
   1.3.1. Interfly Guidance. MAJCOMs will place interfly guidance (if applicable) in their aircraft-spe-
   cific AFI 11-2MDS, Volume 3.
   1.3.2. Ensure that no aircrew member is allowed to remain with a flying status code (FSC) of “S”
   (Table 2.6.) (except Duty Not Involving Flying [DNIF] members) or ASC of “04” (Table 2.5.)
   beyond 180 days without being disqualified for aviation service, returned to flying, or reassigned to
   non-flying, unless a valid waiver was requested by the member’s unit commander, with a valid reason
   for an extension, and approved by the MAJCOM/DO. Waivers beyond 365 days (total) must be sub-
   mitted through AF/XOOT to AF/XOO for approval.
   1.3.3. Ensure FSC “K” (Table 2.6.) is used only for aircrew members assigned to an active Aircrew
   Position Indicator (API) not authorized to fly due to lack of resources (aircraft, flying hours, etc.). To
   ensure the requirement for active flying is still valid, each position occupied by the primary incumbent
   assigned FSC “K” must be revalidated by the MAJCOM/DO at the end of each fiscal year. Upon com-
   pletion of the revalidation, a letter must be sent to the member’s Host Aviation Resource Management
   (HARM) office authorizing the continuance of the FSC “K.”
       1.3.3.1. FSC “K” is not authorized when aircrew members double billeted due to PCS, PCA
       actions.
8                                                           AFI11-401_AFRCSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2005


1.4. Responsibilities of Subordinate Organizations.
    1.4.1. Commanders are responsible for compliance with the minimum requirements of this instruc-
    tion. Commanders will:
       1.4.1.1. Issue orders and supervise all personnel assigned or attached to their command for flying
       duties.
       1.4.1.2. Establish procedures to ensure all flights are reviewed for flight feasibility.
       1.4.1.3. Ensure compliance with appropriate instructions, and adequate crew preparation for safe
       conduct of flight.
       1.4.1.4. Verify aircrew members are qualified before being assigned to an aircrew position.
       1.4.1.5. Notify the HARM office within 10 days of the beginning of any investigations that may
       affect an aircrew member’s aviation service.
       1.4.1.6. Ensure aircrew members that have been disqualified for aviation service have the appro-
       priate disqualification aeronautical order (AO) published, even if the member may have already
       separated or was dismissed from the Air Force.
       1.4.1.7. Ensure aircrew members that have been assigned FSC “S” and ASC “04” do not exceed
       the 180-day limit, without obtaining approval from their MAJCOM/DO. If an extension is
       required, the commander will submit the request for an extension/waiver prior to the 180-day limit
       expiring. If a waiver of the 180-limit was previously approved IAW paragraph 1.3.2., the unit
       commander must obtain AF/XOO waiver approval prior to the member exceeding 365 days in this
       status. AFI 11-402, Aviation and Parachutist Service, Aeronautical Ratings and Badges, provides
       applicable guidance for suspensions/disqualifications.
       1.4.1.7. (AFRC) Commanders should coordinate with the servicing Host Aviation Resource
       Management (HARM) office, explore all options and be fully briefed on all ramifications prior to
       selecting a course of action concerning any rated aircrew member or Career Enlisted Aviator
       (CEA) who will exceed the 180-day limit for Flying Status Code (FSC) “S” (except Duty Not
       Involving/Including Flying (DNIF) members).
           1.4.1.7.1. (Added-AFRC) If necessary, Commanders will provide a request for extension
           with justification to the HARM or Squadron Aviation Resource Management (SARM) office
           (if the AFRC unit is supported by an active duty HARM) at the 150-day point explaining why
           the rated aircrew member/CEA should remain in “S” status beyond 180 days. The HARM or
           SARM will forward this request for extension, complete with full justification, to HQ AFRC/
           DOT prior to the expiration of the 180-day limit.
           1.4.1.7.2. (Added-AFRC) Without an approved extension, the unit Operations Group Com-
           mander (OG/CC) must recommend flying evaluation board (FEB)/aircrew evaluation board
           (AEB) action to the wing commander or equivalent of rated aircrew members/CEAs who have
           been in FSC “S” for more than 180 days (except DNIF members). If FEB/AEB action is not
           recommended, the unit OG/CC will notify HQ AFRC/DOT and provide supporting documen-
           tation as to why the individual should not meet an FEB/AEB under the provisions of AFI
           11-402, paragraph 4.3.5.7.3.2. Do not use FSC “S” in lieu of an appropriate aviation service
           code.
AFI11-401_AFRCSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2005                                                                         9


      1.4.1.8. The OG/CC, deputy, or equivalent will send the servicing HARM office a letter of expla-
      nation when to assign FSC “K” and an information copy to the MAJCOM/DO. The HARM pro-
      cesses the AO, with explicit remarks and files the letter of notification permanently on the left side
      of the FRF. The OG/CC is required to submit a revalidation letter to the MAJCOM/DO no later
      than 30 days after concluding the fiscal year. The HARM will file the MAJCOM/DO’s revalida-
      tion letter permanently in the member’s FRF upon receipt.
   1.4.2. Commanders manage aircrew and parachutist members assigned to their unit and coordinate
   changes that affect aircrew members' flying and parachutist members' jump status with the HARM.
      1.4.2.1. Commanders will manage rated and CEA aircrew positions IAW AFI 11-412, Aircrew
      Management.
          1.4.2.1.1. Commanders must notify the HARM when staff or flight surgeon flying positions
          are double billeted and identify which aircrew member to assign inactive flying activity, FSC
          (J), within 30 days of assignment to the position, IAW Table 2.1., Note 3. When excess air-
          crew members are identified, HARM offices will contact the applicable commander if notifi-
          cation is not provided. Unless AF/XOO approves authorization of excess crewmembers, the
          HARM will inactivate aeronautical orders for those flyers in excess of the unit authorization.
      1.4.2.2. Commanders will manage non-rated aircrew and parachutist positions IAW AFI 11-402.
          1.4.2.2.1. DELETED.
      1.4.2.3. Commanders will ensure a process is in place for aircrew and parachutist members and/
      or unit orderly rooms to notify the base HARM office of all non-flying TDYs, projected PCS,
      RET, or SEP actions. This requirement can be met by having the flying or jump unit orderly room
      forward copies of all aircrew/parachutist members’ TDY, PCS, RET, or SEP orders to the base
      HARM to process required AO or ARMS actions.
          1.4.2.3.1. Commanders will establish procedures to ensure aircrew/parachutists pick up the
          FRF/JRF from the HARM office prior to outprocessing members from their unit for PCS
          assignments.
          1.4.2.3.2. Commanders will establish procedures to ensure aircrew/parachutist members and/
          or unit orderly rooms notify the HARM office prior to a PCA action to another unit, so HARM
          office personnel can accomplish any necessary AO or ARMS actions.
   1.4.3. (Added-AFRC) Commanders will ensure AFRC units use Aviation Resource Management
   (ARM) procedures and forms of the command with oversight responsibility unless AFRC has devel-
   oped specific forms and procedures.

1.5. Responsibilities of Aircrew Members and Parachutists.
   1.5.1. Safely and effectively use available flying and parachute jump resources to obtain and maintain
   aircrew or parachutist qualification when assigned to active flying or jump billets. See AFI 11-402 for
   guidance pertaining to failure of members to attain/maintain aircrew or parachutist training require-
   ments.
      1.5.1.1. SARMs/TARMs must assign aircrew or parachutist training requirements in ARMS to all
      fliers/jumpers assigned to active billets.
10                                                           AFI11-401_AFRCSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2005


     1.5.2. Accomplish an annual flight or jump records review in the HARM office (except for geograph-
     ically separated units [GSU]) to validate aviation/parachutist service actions and the record of flying
     or jump accomplishments during the previous year. HARMs may mail annual record review docu-
     ments to a GSU for a member’s review and certification. Member will complete the review and sign
     the INDIVIDUAL DATA SUMMARY (IDS) not later than the end of the member’s birth month.
     (Does not apply to cadets, who do not have FRF/JRF requirements.)
        1.5.2.1. Certification is acknowledgement by the member that the flying/jump data is correct.
        Information maintained in the FRF or JRF will not be changed without official source documenta-
        tion. For example an AFTO Form 781 or AF Form 3520 for missing flights and sorties, AETC
        Form 240-5 for student hours, an AF Form 922 or AF Form 4323 for missing jumps, Military ID
        or re-enlistment paperwork for date of separation change and personnel data that did not interface
        to ARMS, etc. In the absence of source documents, the member may submit a DD Form 149 to the
        Air Force Board for Corrections to Military Records (AFBCMR) IAW Air Force Pamphlet
        36-2607, Applicant’s Guide to the Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records (AFB-
        CMR). HARMs must ensure all flying hour corrections (especially to career totals) are accounted
        for by a source document. A copy of the DD Form 149 or flying hour log book or letter (submitted
        under previous Air Force policy) must be filed on the left side of the FRF IAW AFI 11-421, Avia-
        tion Resource Management.
            1.5.2.1.1. AF/XOOT is OPR for AFBCMR requests. AF/XOOT may contact HARM offices
            directly to obtain documents for review/validation, to expedite corrective action if an AFB-
            CMR is received, or expedite corrective action to ARMS data received on the Consolidated
            Headquarters Aviation Resource Management (CHARM) report.
        1.5.2.2. Inactive aircrew/jump personnel must accomplish a records review within 120 days prior
        to departure and not later than 120 days following their arrival at a new duty station. They are not
        required to accomplish annual reviews of their FRF/JRF.
        1.5.2.3. Aircrew/jump personnel suspended or disqualified for aviation service (does not include
        DNIF) will accomplish a FRF/JRF review within 30 days. Geographically separated members will
        sign review and return to HARM office within five duty-days of receipt.
     1.5.3. Ensure the HARM office maintaining their FRF or JRF is aware of an impending permanent
     change of station (PCS) move or temporary duty (TDY). The HARM office must be advised of the
     proposed departure date, date of last flight or jump before departure, and date the individual will pick
     up the FRF or JRF. Members must notify the HARM at least five days prior to departure, if applicable.
        1.5.3.1. Notify the HARM of flying/jumping TDYs so aviation/parachutists and incentive pay
        actions can be managed properly during extended TDYs. If assigned to a unit with a Squadron
        Aviation Resource Management (SARM) or Tenant Aviation Resource Management (TARM)
        office, the SARM/TARM will establish notification procedures to the HARM via a memorandum
        to help the HARM manage aviation/parachutist or flight/jump pay issues while the member is
        TDY.
        1.5.3.2. Validate flights or jumps accomplished before departing PCS and sign ARMS generated
        PCS IDS.
        1.5.3.3. Notify the HARM office of any permanent change of assignment (PCA), to include pend-
        ing PCA moves. The SARM/TARM will establish procedures to notify the HARM of PCA moves
        for assigned aircrew/parachutist members. Provide gaining unit, effective date of assignment, and
AFI11-401_AFRCSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2005                                                                       11


     position number. The HARM office must be advised if the position will require flying or jumping
     that will require an update to the Aviation Resource Management System (ARMS) and the publi-
     cation of any necessary AOs.
  1.5.4. Pick up the Flight Evaluation Folder (FEF), Flying History Report (FHR), FRF or JRF before
  departing for PCS or flying/jumping TDY (ref. para 3.1.4.1.). Members must ensure they have a cur-
  rent copy of AO, IDS, ARMS training summary, and AF Form 142, Aviation Service Audit Work-
  sheet, prior to departure on a jump/flying TDY. Members initiating parachutist status, scheduled to
  attend jump school, must give the HARM office a copy of their TDY orders at least 5 work-days prior
  to TDY, to allow processing of the initial AO authorizing jump status.
  1.5.5. Turn in the FRF or JRF to the proper HARM office (or notify the HARM office that the record
  was mailed) within 10 duty-days after arriving at a new duty station (includes flying TDY). FRF/JRF
  must be reviewed by the member within 30 days after arrival at a new permanent duty station. Inactive
  aircrew members must also turn in the FRF and Flight Evaluation Folder (FEF) within 10 duty days.
  If a member does not turn in the FRF within the 10 workday limit, aviation career incentive pay
  (ACIP), career enlisted flyer incentive pay (CEFIP), or hazardous duty incentive pay (HDIP) will be
  suspended (via a Military Pay Order [MPO]) until receipt of the FRF for validation of qualification.
  HARMs will consider mailed records as “turned in” and will not suspend incentive pay on these mem-
  bers. HARMs will make every effort to contact the member prior to stopping incentive pay. HARMs
  will ensure FRF/JRFs are inprocessed to the ARMS database NLT 10 days after receipt of the records.
     1.5.5.1. Fliers assigned to an inactive API code/duty position (after an active flying assignment)
     will turn in their FEF to the HARM office within five duty days of assignment to an inactive API
     code/flying position (i.e. API-6 flyer is placed in an API-3 position, etc.). The HARM office will
     file the FEF inside the member's FRF. If the member returns to active flying status, forward the
     FEF to the member's flying unit.
  1.5.6. Turn in medical records to the flight surgeon’s office within 10 duty-days after arriving at new
  duty station and complete initial clearance prior to first flight or jump.
  1.5.7. Maintain physical examination currency by completing a preventive health assessment annu-
  ally not later than the last day of, but not earlier than five months prior to, the member’s birth month.
  1.5.8. Members will sign out their AF Form 702, Individual Physiological Training Record (origi-
  nal), and AF Form 1042, Medical Recommendation for Flying or Special Operational Duty
  (copy) from the HARM office prior to attending physiological/centrifuge training. Upon completion
  of training, return forms to the HARM office within 5 duty days after arrival at home station.
  1.5.9. Provide the SARM office a copy of TDY orders at least 5 days prior to departure (when possi-
  ble).
     1.5.9.1. Squadron Aviation Resource Management, Tenant Aviation Resource Management
     offices, or flight medicine elements will establish procedures to notify HARM offices for aircrew/
     parachutists members assigned to their units to validate deployments to support flying operations
     and non-fly/jump TDYs (in lieu of sending TDY orders). The HARM office will use the TDY
     notification to ensure no flight/jump credit is authorized for non-flying/jumping TDY assignments
     (including Air Force Educational Leave of Absence, other academic classes, and other non-fly/
     jump TDYs) and to note that a member may have flight time pending turn in which may affect pay
     entitlements.

        1.5.9.2. Inactive aircrew members will notify the HARM office at least 10 days prior to departing
        on an authorized flying TDY (includes requalification courses).
        1.5.9.3. HARMs/SARMs will establish procedures to validate flights/jumps performed during
        non-flying-jumping TDY are not counted toward ACIP, CEFIP, or HDIP flight/jump require-
        ments.
     1.5.10. When permanently changing station or unit of assignment, ensure sign-out from unit/base
     does not negatively affect OFDA credit. Aircrew members permanently changing station or unit of
     assignment require 15 days or more on active flying status for that month for valid AOs and to receive
     credit towards OFDA totals.
        1.5.10.1. Aircrew members assigned to an active flying billet who are being reassigned to an
        inactive billet should make every effort to outprocess their unit/base after the 15th of the month to
        provide an opportunity to obtain the last month of OFDA credit (if flight requirements are also
        met).
        1.5.10.2. Aircrew members assigned to an inactive billet who are being reassigned to an active
        billet should outprocess their unit/base before the 15th of the month to provide an opportunity to
        obtain OFDA credit for the first month of assignment (if flight requirements are also met).

1.6. Flying Obligations.
     1.6.1. During Time of War. Commanders (including unit commanders) may order Air Force mem-
     bers on active duty to make flights in any aircraft. They are not entitled to incentive pay unless placed
     on active AOs that require them to perform specific in-flight duties on a frequent and regular basis (to
     include aircraft AOs) as defined in this instruction. Members are not entitled to such pay if the pay is
     suspended by the President according to Title 37 U.S.C. 301(d) or 301a(c). They are entitled to flight
     credit IAW paragraph 3.3. of this instruction based on the commander's tasking.
        1.6.1.1. Members qualified on the aircraft in which they are tasked to perform in-flight duties log
        the aircrew certification code IAW Table A2.3. of this instruction and flying hours associated with
        duties performed.
        1.6.1.2. Members not qualified on the aircraft in which they are tasked to perform in-flight duties
        log “O” or “X” aircrew certification code (first character) and other time. If member obtains qual-
        ification while deployed, and aircraft AOs are not processed prior to the flight, the flying unit
        commander may issue a verbal order IAW paragraph A3.3.1.2.of this instruction.
     1.6.2. In Time of Peace. Commanders (including unit commanders) may order Air Force members
     on active duty to make official flights when in the best interest of the Air Force. They are not entitled
     to incentive pay for Operational Flying Duty Accumulator (OFDA) credit unless they are rated, CEA,
     or nonrated aircrew members on AOs and assigned an active ASC that requires them to perform spe-
     cific inflight duties on a frequent and regular basis, (e.g., flying a minimum of four hours per month
     for an active duty nonrated aircrew member or two hours per month for an ARC nonrated aircrew
     member).
        1.6.2.1. Military aircrew members who are properly qualified, meet the criteria of this instruction
        and AFI 11-402 for initiating aviation service, and are directed to perform specific inflight duties
        on a frequent and regular basis, will be placed on AOs and a flight authorization.
AFI11-401_AFRCSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2005                                                                       13


        1.6.2.1.1. Members not listed in an AFI 65-503 crew complement, who are not obtaining or
        maintaining aircraft qualification, and who do not have current aircraft AOs, may be autho-
        rized to fly IAW paragraph 3.3. of this instruction when required for the mission. Written
        authorization for flight duty must be provided to the HARM office.
            1.6.2.1.1.1. If the member obtains qualification in the aircraft while TDY, and aircraft
            AOs cannot be processed prior to the flight, the flying unit commander or flying unit flight
            authorization authenticating official may issue a verbal order IAW paragraph A3.3.1.2. of
            this instruction, authorizing the flight. The member will log the appropriate aircrew certi-
            fication code (first character) and primary, secondary, or appropriate time applicable to the
            inflight duty performed.
            1.6.2.1.1.2. If the member does not obtain qualification in the aircraft, the member may
            log “O” or “X” aircrew certification code (first character) and other time only.
     1.6.2.2. Members who are properly qualified and directed to perform specific inflight non-inter-
     ference duties will be placed on AOs and the flight authorization but will not be placed on the
     AFTO Form 781, ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document. Refer to paragraph 2.12.4.
     for additional guidance.
     1.6.2.3. Military members not on AOs, and not required to perform duties or obtain and maintain
     qualification in the aircraft, must fly in passenger status, will be placed on a passenger manifest,
     and must fly on commercial or military aircraft with adequate facilities for transporting passen-
     gers. Refer to paragraphs 1.9.4.7.1., 2.12.5., and applicable MDS-Specific guidance for further
     passenger guidance/restrictions.
     1.6.2.4. Commanders (including unit commanders) may detail (by written orders) personnel
     under their command to take part in aircraft flights operated by any foreign government accredited
     by the United States, provided the flights do not add additional expense to the US Government,
     and provided personnel are on AOs that require them to take part in frequent and regular flights.
     1.6.2.5. Military members not authorized AOs (as specified above) tasked to perform unique
     ground support duties directly related and essential to the particular aircraft or mission being
     flown, e.g., a maintenance specialist required to perform routine maintenance or a security team
     required to guard the aircraft at enroute or destination stops, may fly as Mission Essential Ground
     Personnel (MEGP) as defined by MAJCOMs in MAJCOM supplements to this instruction. See
     paragraphs 1.8.4.2. and 1.12.2.2. for additional guidance.
        1.6.2.5.1. The OG/CC (or equivalent) with operational control of the mission being flown
        authorizes MEGP status. MEGP may only fly on aircraft capable of carrying passengers IAW
        the provisions of DoD 4515.13-R. EXCEPTION: Under exceptional conditions (e.g. national
        emergency, severe weather, earthquake, flood) MEGP may be flown on non-passenger carry-
        ing aircraft if their duties are essential to the maintenance of the aircraft at the recovery base.
        All steps should be taken to pre-deploy these personnel via other means of transportation, if
        adequate time permits.
     1.6.2.6. MAJCOMs may designate aircrew members to travel in Additional Crewmember (ACM)
     status. ACMs will be defined by MAJCOMs in MAJCOM supplements to this instruction. See
     paragraphs 1.8.4.2. and 1.12.2.2. for additional guidance.

            1.6.2.6.1. The OG/CC (or equivalent) with operational control of the mission being flown
            grants ACM status. ACM may only fly on aircraft capable of carrying passengers IAW provi-
            sions of DoD 4515.13-R.

1.7. Waiver.
     1.7.1. For Combat Missions or National Emergencies. MAJCOM commanders may waive any
     requirements of this instruction when necessary to carry out combat missions or to accomplish mis-
     sions flown during a state of national emergency. Provide notification to AF/XO with copy to AF/
     XOOT.
     1.7.2. At Other Times. Unless otherwise specified in this instruction, HQ USAF/XOO is the waiver
     authority for this instruction. Request waivers through applicable channels to MAJCOM/DO, or
     equivalent level. MAJCOM/DOs will forward request in message or memo format to HQ USAF/
     XOO, with courtesy copy to HQ USAF/XOOT. Waivers to supplemental guidance will be handled by
     the MAJCOM agency that generated the supplement.
     1.7.3. Administrative Procedures. MAJCOMs may publish HQ USAF waivers in supplements citing
     the authority (e.g., HQ USAF/XOO memo, date, subject).

Section 1B—Flight Authorization

1.8. Aircraft Flight Authorizations.
     1.8.1. Prior to all flights in Air Force aircraft, commanders (including unit commanders) issue written
     authorizations documenting all crewmembers required to perform inflight duties on the mission. Units
     will use AF Form 4327, ARMS Fighter Flight Authorization, or AF Form 4327a, Crew Flight
     Authorization, as applicable to the unit aircraft. A commander's (including unit commanders) verbal
     authorization may direct aircraft flight only when time constraints or administrative procedures pre-
     vent written authorization. Written confirmation of this order must be issued within three duty-days.
     Once a Flight Authorization (FA) has been signed, changes must be validated by a designated approv-
     ing authority by placing the approving authority's initials by the line changed. The commander with
     operational control of the mission is responsible for the publication/maintenance/retention of the air-
     craft FAs for each mission flown by the aircraft. Only commissioned officers are authorized to be
     authenticating officials for Flight Authorizations.
     EXCEPTION: Aeromedical (AE) and Pararescue (PJ) unit commanders with aircrew members may
     accomplish a FA for assigned aircrew members that are required to perform aircrew duties on the mis-
     sion. Commanders must ensure all members listed meet go-no-go criteria prior to authenticating the
     FA. The FA is not a stand alone document and must be attached to the aircraft FA for the mission on
     which aircrew members were required to perform in-flight duties. If the AE or PJ crew is scheduled to
     perform aircrew duties on more than one mission, a remark will be placed on the FA to depict varia-
     tions. As a minimum, the information in blocks 11 through 18 must be documented on the flight
     authorization. In the Remarks section of the aircraft FA, annotate the AE/pararescue FA number, date,
     and unit designation. The FA is a critical document used to validate aircrew member’s duties/flight
     time logged on the AFTO Form 781.
     1.8.1. (AFRC) The HQ AFRC/DOT flight authorization (FA) program is authorized to produce flight
     authorization forms. The AF IMT 4327, ARMS Flight Authorization (FA) and AF IMT 4327a, Crew
AFI11-401_AFRCSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2005                                                                           15


   Flight (FA) Authorization are the only authorized forms for documenting Air Force Reserve aircraft
   flights, unless a waiver is approved by AF/XOOTF. Flight authorizations and AFTO Forms 781,
   ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document must match with the following information: crew posi-
   tion, flight authorization duty code, reserve duty status, and mission type. All changes (additions or
   deletions) must be written in ink. Upon return to home station, file a copy of the corrected flight
   authorization with the original. Commissioned officers authorized to sign flight authorizations must
   be assigned to the respective unit.
       1.8.1.1. Validation of go-no-go qualification must be accomplished IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 2, Air-
       crew Standardization/Evaluation Program, prior to authorizing members to participate in aircrew
       or operational support duties. Once a FA has been published, the pilot in command is responsible
       for validating go-no-go status for additional aircrew or operational support members prior to
       authorizing them to fly and adding or attaching them to the flight authorization. Validation may
       include ARMS products IAW AFI 11-421 (or comparable database for USAFA airmanship pro-
       grams), a flight authorization from an AE or Pararescue unit commander (or designated represen-
       tative), or a letter from the member's unit validating the individual's qualification to fly on required
       missions.
NOTE: When preparing flight authorizations for flying on future dates, the 1C0X2 or designated repre-
sentative (responsible for go-no-go validation) must confirm the member's aeronautical order status, cur-
rency (to include flight physical and physiological training), and qualification will remain valid through
those future dates. Once the FA is published, if the pilot in command is not available, the FA authenticat-
ing official may validate go-no-go status.
   1.8.2. Once a flight authorization has been signed and a mission is later canceled, line through the
   canceled portion(s) of the flight authorization and annotate the reason for cancellation (e.g. weather or
   maintenance cancel).
   1.8.2. (AFRC) Local flight clearance/flight authorization, as a minimum, reflects military grade.
   ARC flight duty status codes are as shown in Table A2.1., item 33 and as supplemented. All nine dig-
   its of the SSN will be reflected on the original; however, copy with full SSN will not be given to other
   aircrew members.
       1.8.2.1. A designated pilot-in-command, or formation flight leader of each flight or flight ele-
       ment.
       1.8.2.2. Name, grade, and flight authorization duty code (Table A2.3.) of each crewmember,
       operational support flyer, or any other official personnel (use the position designation established
       by the MAJCOM) required for the mission or flight.
       1.8.2.2. (AFRC) ART crewmembers will have their military and civilian grades reflected on the
       flight authorization as follows: Under the entry of grade, indicate military and civilian grades for
       ARTs when applicable (e.g., TSgt/GS-8). ARC flight duty status codes are as shown in Table
       A2.1. Item 32.
       1.8.2.3. Type, serial number, and call sign of aircraft or formation and mission symbol.
       1.8.2.3. (AFRC) Flight authorizations will be annotated and tracked by a number which includes
       a two digit fiscal year designation, followed by a dash, followed by a four digit sequence number.
       Numbering will begin with 0001 for the first flight authorization published on the first day of each
       fiscal year (e.g., for the first flight authorization published in FY04 - i.e., on 1 October 2003 - the
16                                                          AFI11-401_AFRCSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2005


        number would be 04-0001.). Flight authorizations are numbered sequentially throughout the fis-
        cal year. Do not use separate numbering systems for local and line missions. ARM Wing Func-
        tional Manager will establish procedures for assigning flight authorization numbers when part of
        the unit is deployed. Flight authorization numbers will be tracked in a logbook or online file.
        1.8.2.4. Place from which the flight will depart plus "on-or-about" departure date.
        1.8.2.5. An itinerary and the phrase "Variations in itinerary authorized."
        1.8.2.6. Provisions of AFI 65-103, Temporary Duty Orders, apply to temporary duty performed
        incidental to authorized flights. Include a statement to this effect on the flight authorization.
     1.8.3. The flight authorization must include (minimum requirements):
        1.8.3.1. A designated pilot-in-command, or formation flight leader of each flight or flight ele-
        ment.
        1.8.3.2. Name, grade, and flight authorization duty code (Table A2.3.) of each crewmember,
        operational support flier, or any other official personnel (use the position designation established
        by the MAJCOM) required for the mission or flight.
        1.8.3.3. Type, serial number, and call sign of aircraft or formation and mission symbol.
        1.8.3.4. Place from which the flight will depart plus "on-or-about" departure date.
        1.8.3.5. An itinerary and the phrase "Variations in itinerary authorized."
        1.8.3.6. Provisions of AFI 65-103, Temporary Duty Orders, apply to temporary duty performed
        incidental to authorized flights. Include a statement to this effect on the flight authorization.
     1.8.4. Flight authorizations will only include personnel on AOs (or contract aircrew personnel on a
     memorandum of agreement/contract) authorized to perform in-flight duties for that mission according
     to paragraphs 1.10. and 3.3. of this instruction. Except for non-interference members, individuals on
     the flight authorization should match those authorized to log time on the AFTO Form 781, ARMS
     Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Extract.
        1.8.4.1. Personnel who are on the aircraft for point-to-point travel, an orientation/familiarization
        flight or to only perform a proficiency jump (not performing aircrew duties for that mission) will
        be listed on the passenger manifest. For fighter-type aircraft, when a passenger manifest is not pre-
        pared, list individuals in the Remarks section of the Flight Authorization.
        1.8.4.2. If ACMs or MEGPs are transported, IAW MAJCOM supplements, they may be listed on
        the flight authorization in the Remarks section (only). ACMs or MEGPs will not be listed on the
        AFTO Form 781, will not log time, and will not accrue OFDA credit.

1.9. Authorization for Using US Air Force Aircraft.
     1.9.1. Commanders (including unit commanders) authorize aircraft flights to support command oper-
     ations.
     1.9.2. Commanders (including unit commanders) must ensure each flight is in the direct interest of
     government business and does not exceed flying hour allocations without specific approval. Com-
     manders (including unit commanders) must not authorize flights for personal convenience or recre-
     ation.
AFI11-401_AFRCSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2005                                                                          17


  1.9.2. (AFRC) HQ AFRC/DOTF is the approval authority for all changes to flying hour programs.
  Units will request changes to the flying hour program through their NAF in writing. NAFs will for-
  ward unit flying hour change requests with comments to HQ AFRC/DOTF.
  1.9.3. The transportation of passengers and cargo will be in accordance with DoD 4515.13-R, Air
  Transportation Eligibility. The Deputy Chief of Staff/Installations and Logistics, Director of Trans-
  portation, Headquarters U.S. Air Force (HQ USAF/ILG), develops and publishes passenger policy to
  oversee passenger movement. AFI 24-101, Passenger Movement, provides guidance and procedures
  for arranging official transportation of Air Force personnel. Orientation flights may be approved as
  provided in DoD 4515.13-R and this instruction.
  1.9.4. Commanders (including unit commanders) may use Air Force aircraft under their control to:
     1.9.4.1. Perform tactical and combat operations.
     1.9.4.2. Train aircrew personnel and evaluate aircrew performance.
     1.9.4.3. Allow aircrews to meet the flying requirements of this instruction.
     1.9.4.4. Further national health or safety interests, to include saving of human life if a medical
     officer indicates the situation involves possible loss of life, limb, or sight (DoD 4515.13-R).
     1.9.4.5. Cooperate with foreign governments as directed by HQ USAF.
     1.9.4.6. Perform other official missions as required.
     1.9.4.7. Conduct the Air Force Orientation Flight and Public Affairs Travel Programs according
     to DoD 4515.13-R; AFI 35-101, Public Affairs Policies and Procedures; AFI 48-123, Medical
     Examinations and Standards, this instruction, and MAJCOM guidelines. Table 1.1. is a matrix of
     approval authorities for orientation/public affairs flights.
     1.9.4.7. (AFRC) Table 1.1. is a matrix of approval authorities for AFRC orientation/public
     affairs flights.
         1.9.4.7.1. The USAF conducts orientation flights to reward and motivate individuals (incen-
         tive orientation flights only), ensure a better understanding of a particular weapon system and
         its role, or when the flight is determined to be in the best interest of the USAF.
         1.9.4.7.1. (AFRC) Commanders must ensure that all orientation/public affairs flights are con-
         ducted on a noninterference basis within their normal training schedule. Unless there are
         unique circumstances, individuals should not participate in repeat orientation flights.
         (EXCEPTIONS: Public affairs related orientation flights are restricted to no more than one
         flight every 2 years; individuals will be eligible to compete for an incentive flight at each of
         his/her PCS locations). Repeat orientation flights will require NAF/CC approval. Assign only
         experienced pilots to perform orientation flights. All passengers will receive appropriate life
         support, egress and emergency procedures training prior to flight. Passengers flying in fighter
         aircraft must either have a medical records review and be interviewed by a flight surgeon or be
         examined by a flight surgeon within 30 days of the flight. All non-US military passengers are
         required to complete a DD Form 1381, Air Transportation Agreement, prior to flight. Com-
         pleted DD Form 1381s will be retained with the flight authorization and passenger manifest
         until mission completion. Military rated pilots will not control the orientation aircraft during
         critical phases of flight until the instructor pilot has evaluated pilot skills and ability to handle
         the aircraft in a benign environment (i.e., above 5,000 feet above ground level (AGL) for all
18                                                   AFI11-401_AFRCSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2005


     fixed wing aircraft and 2,000 feet AGL for helicopters). Critical phases of flight are: takeoff,
     instrument departures, air-to-air refueling, close formation, over-the-top aerobatics, instru-
     ment approaches, low-altitude flying and landing. These imposed restrictions may be waived
     in unusual cases by the NAF/CC with information to HQ AFRC/DO. Submit all requests for
     orientation/public affairs flights via the Single Mobility System (SMS) IAW AFRCI 11-201,
     Flight Information Publications, NLT 7 working days prior to the desired flight date - NLT 14
     working days for missions requiring NAF action/approval. Requests must include justifica-
     tion for the flight, the profile to be flown and any special training the approved individual may
     require. Approval will be issued in the form of a Mission Identifier (MI).
        1.9.4.7.1.1. Incentive Flights. Provide a visible reward to military personnel for out-
        standing service and motivate others to similar performance levels.
        1.9.4.7.1.1. (AFRC) Wings develop, execute and track their own incentive flight pro-
        grams. Flight profiles are unrestricted; however, commanders must consider the individ-
        ual's background to determine the type of flight profile appropriate to the passenger's
        experience and the flight purpose.
            1.9.4.7.1.1.1. (Added-AFRC) Guidance for incentive and distinguished visitor flights
            in fighter/attack aircraft:
            1.9.4.7.1.1.2. (Added-AFRC) The flight is normally a dedicated single ship mission.
            Target ships or formation flights are permissible when they serve the specific purpose
            of the orientation flight, but must be coordinated and approved through 10 AF/CC.
            Public Affair (PA) related fighter flights will always be single ship missions unless oth-
            erwise approved by 10 AF/CC and AFRC/DO.
            1.9.4.7.1.1.3. (Added-AFRC) Plan and execute incentive and distinguished visitor
            flight profiles in a low-risk environment. With the exception of take-off and landing,
            the mission is flown above 1,000 feet AGL. The aircraft will carry no external ord-
            nance and all guns will be mechanically safe.
            1.9.4.7.1.1.4. (Added-AFRC) Cover all aspects of the flight in the pre-flight briefing
            to relieve apprehension. Time pilot advisories in-flight to achieve the same objective.
            1.9.4.7.1.1.5. (Added-AFRC) Perform aerobatics only at the request of the passenger.
            1.9.4.7.1.1.6. (Added-AFRC) Avoid abrupt, unexpected maneuvers and excessive
            G-loading.

       orientation
       flights

NOTES:
          1. “Orientation flights” are defined as continuous flights performed within the local flying
             area and terminating at the point of origin (DoD 4515.13-R, Chapter 4). “Note 1 N/A,”
             means the category of flight is not considered an orientation flight; however, it is included
             in the table as a consolidated reference source.
          2. Requests for point-to-point travel must be specifically addressed and approved by SECAF.
             Retiring members of Congress and retiring congressional staff members may be flown on
             orientation flights only upon the written approval of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for
             Legislative Affairs (ASD[LA]). (Ref. DSD Memo, 23 Dec 1996.)
          3. When aircraft are “chopped” or assigned to a gaining Combatant Commander, approval
             authority will be the Commander Air Force Forces (COMAFFOR) or Theater Special
             Operations Command (SOC) commander.
          4. The USAFA Superintendent is the approval authority for USAFA aircraft flights.
          5. Inform AF/CC/XO/XOO, if approved.
          6. Flights involving foreign nationals must be reviewed for foreign disclosure requirements
             and political concerns. Foreign government officials are equivalent to US Federal govern-
             ment officials and do not include local government officials such as mayors, police chiefs,
             and other local officials who do not represent a foreign government at the national level.
             Foreign military "civilian equivalents" are comparable to DoD "civilian equivalents ."
             a. Ensure foreign disclosure requirements and base visit requests are satisfied according
                to AFI 16-201, Disclosure of Military Information to Foreign Governments and Inter-
                national Organizations.
             b. Coordinate with the country director in the appropriate SAF/IA regional division
                (three-letter level), before approval, to ensure no political concerns that would prevent
                the flight.
          7. This authorization does not include transportation to or from the exercise area or support-
             ing flights utilized for logistics purposes only.
          8. Does not include spouses of government personnel, non-DoD Federal officials, or mem-
             bers of Congress and their staffs.
          9. 34 TRW/CC is approval authority for USAFA.
          10. For foreign students enrolled in USAF Academy or ROTC programs, ensure foreign dis-
              closure requirements (AFI 16-201) concerning visit authorizations and disclosure of
              USAF information are satisfied.

     11. This is not intended to allow all Government contractor employees to fly. The contractors
         must be performing work in direct support of the approving command (aircrew training
         system and aircraft maintenance contractors are the most frequent participants). Normally,
         the requirement for familiarization flights should be specified in the government contract.
     12. For public affairs flight purposes, a local flight is a continuous flight originating and end-
         ing at the same location aboard aircraft assigned to that location. For aircraft permanently
         assigned to one location, but temporarily deployed to another location, the commander
         with operational control of the aircraft at the deployed location may approve local orienta-
         tion flights at the deployed location, IAW the provisions of this AFI and this Table.
     13. For public affairs flight purposes, a non-local flight is a flight from one location to another
         (point-to-point flight).
     14. Foreign citizens are not included in DoD 4515.13-R as passengers eligible for orientation
         flights. "Civic leaders" applies to U.S. civic leaders. See line 25. AF/CV approval is
         required. (Note 6 applies to flights involving foreign nationals.)
            15. For youth in Congressionally sanctioned, DoD-approved Youth Programs, pro-
                gram participants may take part in no more than one orientation flight (Ref DoD
                4515.13-R, Chapter 4). Parental and/or guardian permission is required and the
                flight must be approved by SAF/PA. Specific Public Law guidance applies, includ-
                ing Title 10 United States Code (USC), Section 2012, and Title 32 USC, Section
                508.
     16. Passengers on orientation flights under 18 years of age require parental approval in writ-
         ing.
     17. Travel, which is designed to improve relations, increase good will, or serve humanitarian
         purposes, does not meet the criteria.
     18. Requests for exception to policy must be submitted through command channels according
         to DoD 4515.13-R, Chapter 10, and AFI 24-101. NOTE: Exception to policy authority
         delegated from CSAF to AF/CV IAW AFI 24-101.
     19. Cadets and midshipmen are authorized orientation flights while on leave status.
     20. Aircrew members in suspended (ASC 04) or DNIF status are not authorized familiariza-
         tion/orientation or incentive flights without an approved waiver from HQ USAF/XOOT.

1.10. Authorization to Perform Inflight Duties in Air Force Aircraft.
     1.10.1. A person may not perform duties in Air Force aircraft unless specifically authorized, physi-
     cally qualified (member cannot be in DNIF status--commanders will not authorize any aircrew mem-
     ber in DNIF status to be placed on the flight authorization to perform aircrew duties), and current in
     physiological training (if applicable or on an approved waiver). IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 1, Aircrew
     Training, individuals will not be scheduled to fly when they are delinquent in physiological training
     (when required IAW AFI 11-403, Aerospace Physiological Training Program). Unit commanders
     must restrict individuals from performing inflight duties in the unit assigned aircraft when such per-
     formance may adversely impact safety, morale, or mission accomplishment. Commanders (including
     unit commanders) may authorize the following to perform aircrew (as part of the authorized crew
     complement IAW AFI 65-503, U.S. Air Force Cost and Planning Factors, or required for the mission
     according to paragraph 3.3. of this instruction) and operational support duties on board Air Force air-
     craft:
        1.10.1.1. Qualified members of US military services who hold a current aeronautical rating or
        aeronautical badge, are on active AOs (including aircraft AOs) to take part in frequent and regular
        flights, and are within the authorized crew complement (AFI 65-503) for the aircraft or required
        for the mission. Aircrew members will perform duty associated with their current aeronautical rat-
        ing and aircrew qualification. Flying solely for the purpose of qualifying for incentive pay or
        Operational Flying Duty Accumulator (OFDA) credit is not authorized. Documentation for those
        individuals not in the crew complement or not on aircraft AOs for the specific aircraft must be on
AFI11-401_AFRCSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2005                                                                       31


     file in the member’s FRF IAW paragraph 3.3. prior to authorizing such duties. The SARM/TARM
     office will keep a copy of member’s military service current AOs, including aircraft AOs, on file.
     1.10.1.2. Qualified non-rated officers and enlisted personnel of US military services who are on
     AOs (including aircraft AOs), are required to perform mission essential inflight duties on a full
     time basis, and are within the authorized crew complement (AFI 65-503) for the aircraft or
     required for the mission. Aircrew members will perform duty associated with their current aircrew
     specialty and aircrew qualification. Flying solely for the purpose of qualifying for incentive pay is
     not authorized. Documentation for those individuals not in the crew complement or not on aircraft
     AOs for the specific aircraft must be on file in the member’s FRF IAW paragraph 3.3. prior to
     authorizing such duties. The SARM/TARM office will keep a copy of member’s military service
     current AOs, including aircraft AOs, on file.
     1.10.1.3. Operational support fliers who are on AOs and who are required to perform essential
     specific inflight duties on an occasional basis that cannot be accomplished by regularly assigned
     crew members, and other non-rated members on non-interference AOs who fly occasionally to
     perform specific official inflight tasks. Flying solely for the purpose of qualifying for Hazardous
     Duty Incentive Pay is not authorized. The SARM office will keep a copy of member’s current mil-
     itary service AOs on file.
     1.10.1.4. Personnel authorized by competent authority to receive instruction in aircrew duties at
     Air Force schools.
     1.10.1.5. Professionally qualified civilian employees of the US Government. MAJCOM com-
     manders determine individual qualifications.
     1.10.1.6. Qualified employees or prospective employees of a government contractor according to
     the terms and conditions of a current government contract. The Squadron Aviation Resource Man-
     agement office will keep a copy of contract on file.
     1.10.1.7. Foreign nationals according to Section 1C of this instruction.
     1.10.1.8. US Air Force Academy cadets, Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC)
     cadets, Uniformed Services University of Health Sciences (USUHS) and Health Professions
     Scholarship Program (HPSP) students participating in aviation related activities, and Civil Air
     Patrol (CAP) cadets are authorized to participate in flying duties as observers, in a special training
     status, on missions as determined by the MAJCOM. HARM offices will process AOs for such
     cadets or students. Neither flying incentive pay nor flying duty credit are authorized, nor will avi-
     ation service dates be established.
     1.10.1.9. US Air Force Academy cadets and Air Force ROTC cadets enrolled in approved
     USAFA flying programs are accorded aircrew status while actively participating in such pro-
     grams. Cadets will be placed on an AF Form 1887, Aeronautical Order, authorizing USAFA Air-
     manship Program flying status. Cadets will not be added into an operational ARMS database, an
     Aviation Service Code (ASC) will not be assigned, and an Aviation Service Date (ASD) will not
     be established. Neither flying incentive pay nor flying duty credit are authorized.
  1.10.2. Family members will not be assigned to airborne duty on the same aircraft for a given mis-
  sion. Family member is defined as spouse, brother, sister, parent, and child. MAJCOMs are authorized
  to waive this prohibition on a case-by-case basis, only where unusual conditions dictate.
32                                                           AFI11-401_AFRCSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2005


     1.10.2. (AFRC) AFRC units will forward requests to the NAF/DO for approval. The NAF/DO will
     forward approved requests to the AFRC/DO for final approval.

1.11. Authorization to Perform Inflight Duties in Non-US Air Force Aircraft.
     1.11.1. With MAJCOM approval, aircrew members in active flying positions, and authorized opera-
     tional support personnel, may perform appropriate duties in non-US Air Force aircraft if it is in the
     interest of the US Government, approved by the authority that controls the aircraft, and the members
     are qualified and, if applicable, licensed to perform such duties. Prior to authorizing these missions,
     MAJCOMs will ensure a valid requirement for a USAF aircrew member to operationally fly exists,
     which cannot be accomplished in USAF aircraft. For operational support flying, justification must
     show that qualified aircrew or operational support personnel of other (non-US Air Force) services or
     applicable organizations cannot perform such duties. Requests to fly solely for the purpose of quali-
     fying for incentive pay or Operational Flying Duty Accumulator (OFDA) credit will not be approved.
     1.11.2. NOTE: Performing these duties does not remove military personnel from line-of-duty deter-
     mination status. When aircrew members are not assigned to API 7 or API G coded positions, MAJ-
     COMs must provide the member’s HARM office with a letter of justification authorizing the member
     to perform official aircrew duties in non-US Air Force aircraft and log flying time IAW paragraph
     3.3.and assign an appropriate aircrew qualification code IAW Table A3.1.. In addition, Wing/CCs or
     equivalents (or higher, as applicable with the member’s chain of command) must authorize orientation
     flights in non-USAF aircraft for USAF aircrew members.

1.12. Requirements for Pilots in Dual Controlled Aircraft.
     1.12.1. Every flight in a dual-controlled aircraft requires two pilots with current qualification in the
     type aircraft being flown. Anytime an individual not fully qualified in the specific mis-
     sion-design-series (MDS) being flown occupies a pilot’s seat (with a set of controls), a current and
     qualified instructor pilot will occupy the other seat. EXCEPTIONS:
        1.12.1.1. If operational, command mission requirements, or MDS-specific instructions dictate
        that these requirements are not practical.
        1.12.1.2. To accommodate training programs for checkout or continuation programs.
        1.12.1.3. If the crew composition requires another rated specialty (such as a weapons system
        officer).
        1.12.1.4. To accommodate established programs (for example, indoctrination and orientation pro-
        grams).
        1.12.1.5. Flight surgeons and MAJCOM-designated Flight Test Engineers who take part in flights
        in dual-controlled aircraft.
     1.12.2. At no time will an individual who is not fully qualified in the specific type aircraft being
     flown occupy any pilot’s seat (with a set of controls) with passengers on board the aircraft. For general
     officer flying, waiver authority to this guidance is AF/CC, IAW AF/CV msg 091724Z Apr 04.
     (NOTE: This message specifically precludes unqualified general officers from flying in the seat on
     aircraft deliveries when passengers are on board the aircraft.) EXCEPTIONS:
        1.12.2.1. To accommodate training objectives required by formal training programs. This excep-
        tion allows passengers, when they are an integral part of the overall mission being performed (e.g.,
AFI11-401_AFRCSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2005                                                                       33


     Pararescue, Rangers, CCT, SEALs, etc.) and their presence is required by the training syllabus, to
     be on board the aircraft. During such times, a current and qualified instructor pilot will occupy the
     other pilot’s seat.
     1.12.2.2. In order to accommodate training objectives or mission requirements, pilots (including
     non-current or unqualified pilots) who are authorized to obtain and maintain qualification in a par-
     ticular MDS aircraft may occupy a pilot's seat for purposes of conducting training or accomplish-
     ing mission requirements when ACMs or MEGP are on board the aircraft.
        1.12.2.2.1. During such times, if the pilot is non-current or unqualified, a current and qualified
        instructor pilot will occupy the other pilot's seat.
        1.12.2.2.2. Pilots who are not authorized to obtain or maintain aircraft qualification will not
        occupy a seat with a set of controls with passengers, ACMs, or MEGP on board.
            1.12.2.2.2.1. (Added-AFRC) Individuals will ensure travel orders include the following
            citation when Mission Essential Ground Personnel (MEGP) status is authorized: MEGP
            status is authorized by (appropriate wing/NAF/DO) on (unit, aircraft number and/or mis-
            sion number/exercise or contingency name) from (start date) to (mission completion date).
            MEGP status must be cited in an authorization letter or message approved by the OG/CC
            using the statement above.
            1.12.2.2.2.2. (Added-AFRC) Individuals anticipating traveling in MEGP status should

     mand administrative procedures, military personnel of friendly foreign nations may take part as air-
     crew members in flights of US Air Force aircraft operated by the MAJCOM, Defense Intelligence
     Agency (DIA), US Military Groups (USMILGP), Missions, and Military Assistance Advisory Groups
     (MAAG) when: the individual is physically, physiologically, professionally, and administratively
     qualified; a fully qualified US Air Force pilot occupies a pilot position during aircraft operations; and
     when required by the MAJCOMs, DIA, USMILGP, Missions, or MAAG to help complete their mis-
     sion.
     1.13.5. Flights involving foreign nationals must be reviewed for foreign disclosure requirements,
     IAW AFI 16-201.
     1.13.6. If not otherwise provided for in this instruction, other foreign military personnel stationed at

Section 2A—Flying Program

2.1. Rated Officer and Career Enlisted Aviator (CEA) Flying Program. The rated officer and CEA
inventory requires close management at all levels to ensure a high state of readiness is maintained with
available resources. The authorized rated inventory includes pilots, navigators and air battle managers in
the grade of lieutenant colonel and below. To manage these as well as other aircrew positions, API codes
are assigned to identify these positions. NOTE: API 1-0 applies to all officers, and A-Z applies to CEA
personnel (Table 2.1.).
2.1. (AFRC) Rated Officer and Career Enlisted Aviator (CEA) Flying Program. D e s i g n a t i o n o f
proper Aircrew Position Indicator (API) codes for AFRC owned rated officers and CEAs is according to
the unit manpower documents (UMD). The UMD designates the operational supervisory positions (lieu-
tenant colonel and below) requiring active flying as prescribed in AFRCI 38-201, Manpower Authoriza-
tion, Allocations, and Change Requests. These are designated with APIs 6/8 and B/D. Any changes,
additions or deletions to the API code listed in the unit UMD must be coordinated with HQ AFRC/DOT
before being approved by the Director of Personnel. (See also AFI 38-201, paragraph 9.3.2.3 and
9.3.2.3.6., require Air Staff approval if inactive to active – new AF IMT 480, Aircrew AFSC/Active Flying
Justification submission.)
   2.1.1. Until the Military Personnel Data System (MILPDS) is modified to maintain API effective
   dates and interface this data to the ARMS database, HARMs will enter the API effective date in
   ARMS. Upon receipt and validation of MILPDS interface API change, enter the effective date of the
   API change.

NOTES:
  1. APIs 1, 2, 9, and A are for officers and CEAs assigned to line flying positions or assigned to for-
     mal flying training programs. The primary duty of these crewmembers is flying.
   2. API 3, 4, 6, 8, B, C, D, and E identify crewmembers assigned to supervisory or staff positions.
      These positions require aircrew expertise (API 3, 4, 6, 8, B, D, and E) and some require active fly-
      ing (API 6, 8, B, and D).
   3. If more than one crewmember is assigned to an API-5, 6, 8, B, and D position, only the primary
      designated incumbent will be assigned an active FAC/FSC code and fly. The MAJCOM/SGPA or
      higher will determine which flight surgeons are designated as the primary incumbent.
   4. If replacement of the primary incumbent is necessary (for example, PCS, permanent change of
      assignment, etc.), the replacement may also be authorized an active FAC/FSC code, provided the
      overlap is not more than 30 days. (Reference para 1.4.2.1.1.).
   5. Qualified medical officers assigned to flight surgeon and pilot-physician, when not assigned to an
      operational flying squadron as a primary line flier, positions.
   6. Officers/CEAs assigned to flying positions outside of USAF or duties requiring active flying with
      foreign services.
   7. API 0 and Z identify non-rated/non-CEA positions.

   operational AVO duties. (CSAF-approved for OFDA credit.)

NOTES:
  1. The FSC indicates if a member is assigned to an active or inactive flying position and the reason
     for inactivity. Rated members assigned to mandatory rated flying duties must fly in an active sta-
     tus if otherwise qualified. If the unit commander determines that no flying support capability
     exists for these officers, assign them an inactive FSC. All rated aircrew members assigned to
     non-flying duties or non-rated flying are restricted from active rated flying. MAJCOMs assign
     support-flying priorities according to paragraph 2.8. when adequate resources are lacking.
     2. ARMS automatically generates an FSC change for ASC G; no AO is required.
     3. Do not process non-performance AOs for rated officers after 18 years of aviation service or CEAs
        after 20 years of aviation service. Refer to AFIs 11-202, Vol 1, and 11-402 flying/aircrew evalua-
        tion board requirement procedures, for members assigned to active flying positions who do not fly
        for extended periods for reasons within their control.
     4. HARM offices will process an AO to assign FSC P or R effective the date of the separation or
        retirement orders, update ARMS, and terminate flight pay (if applicable).
     5. When nonrated/non-CEA members are assigned to a dual-coded flying/jump position, assign FSC
        D. When no longer assigned to the dual-coded jump/flying position, change the member's FSC
        from D to J. When a member is re-assigned from a dual-coded position to a jump DAFSC (or J
        prefixed position) only, change the member's FSC to E.

2.4. Aviation Service Code (ASC) and Flying Activity Code (FAC) Effective Dates.
NOTE: HARM offices must verify UMD information to document that aircrew/parachutists are assigned
to an authorized flying/jump position prior to publishing AOs.
     2.4.1. The date that an ASC becomes effective determines when the member's flying or parachuting
     duties, OFDA credit, and incentive pay starts. Incentive pay terminates the day prior to a member
     being assigned a suspension, disqualification, or termination (from aviation/parachutist status) ASC.
     Assign the ASC effective date as follows:
        2.4.1.1. Use 1 June 1974 for officers rated before 1 June 1974.
AFI11-401_AFRCSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2005                                                                       51


     2.4.1.2. Use the individual’s aviation service date for medically qualified officers and CEAs
     entering formal Undergraduate Flying Training (UFT) or approved local initial qualification train-
     ing (IQT) flying training courses where flying is part of the course. This date cannot be prior to
     member meeting qualification requirements IAW AFI 11-402.
     2.4.1.3. Use the day after DDLDS from the losing organization for a PCS move that requires an
     ASC change. This includes inactive officers who require active AOs to attend formal flying train-
     ing TDY enroute to PCS to an active flying assignment. EXCEPTIONS:
        2.4.1.3.1. An officer/CEA UFT graduate, upon changing base locations to his or her first
        operational duty assignment following completion of UFT and initial qualification training,
        will change from an FSC "X" to an FSC "A" with an effective date of the day the member
        signs into the operational unit at their permanent base.
        2.4.1.3.2. An officer/CEA UFT graduate, who attended UFT at their permanent duty station
        and assigned to their operational duty assignment after UFT, then entered into in-unit formal
        training leading to initial qualification in their primary aircraft will retain FSC X until comple-
        tion of training as documented by a flight evaluation, AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew
        Qualification, e.g., C-130 initial qualification.
        2.4.1.3.3. A previously rated officer or CEA returning to another UFT course will maintain
        their current ASC until the UFT class-start date. For example: Captain Lopez, a rated naviga-
        tor with a current ASC of 1A is selected to attend pilot UFT. Captain Lopez has a PCS assign-
        ment to Laughlin AFB to attend UPT and departs Robins AFB on 5 Sep 02. The UFT
        class-start date is 15 Sep 02. Laughlin HARM changes Captain Lopez’s ASC from 1A to 1U
        effective 15 Sep 02.
     2.4.1.4. Use the latest UFT graduation date to process the ASC change from 1U to 1X (rated) and
     AU to AX (CEA). UFT HARM will process the AO.
     2.4.1.5. Use the formal jump school training (leading to the basic parachutist rating) class start
     date as the AO effective date to initiate Air Force parachutist service for members initially
     assigned to an authorized jump (“J” prefix AFSC or AFSC 1C2X1, 1T2X1, 13DX) UMD position.
     HARMs may use TDY orders or formal training notification to jump school to process initial AO
     prior to the member attending training.
        2.4.1.5.1. HARMs must publish an AO for parachutists to attend HALO (High Altitude Low
        Opening) school prior to the member attending school, effective the class start date. Member
        must be on competent orders for that type of jumping and AOs must specify the type of pay on
        the AO (HALO). Once the member performs a HALO jump, HALO pay is authorized from
        effective date of the AO forward (if otherwise qualified). If the member does not complete the
        course, HALO pay terminates on the day the member is disenrolled from class. A new AO
        must be published effective the day after disenrollment to reinstate back to the Static Line
        HDIP (if member returns to previous jump duty) or previous ASC held (prior to the class).
     2.4.1.6. Use the duty effective date for a change in duty that does not involve PCS but requires an
     ASC change (suspension/disqualification actions, flying waivers, etc.). For example: Member
     assigned to an inactive position approved for a Flying Activity Code (FAC) waiver to support a
     contingency or date a commander directs suspension/disqualification IAW AFI 11-402.
52                                                         AFI11-401_AFRCSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2005


           2.4.1.6.1. For inactive aircrew approved to attend a formal flying qualification/requalification
           course prior to PCS or PCA to an active flying position, the HARM will publish an AO assign-
           ing FAC 6/E and FSC A effective on the class start date (all other uses of FAC6/E must be
           approved by AF/XOO). HARMs will reassign an inactive FSC/FAC effective one day after
           the course completion date.
       2.4.1.7. For rated officers/CEAs required to perform air battle staff, airborne emergency actions
       officer, combat rescue officer, mission crew commander, AVO, IIO, or other duties that do not fall
       under the operational support program, use the effective and termination dates of the duty orders
       to authorize FAC 8. FAC 8 terminates upon completion of flying duties. Process HDIP IAW AFI
       11-421 for the duty period (if otherwise qualified); OFDA and ACIP are not authorized for these
       duties. For rated officer, ASC remains unchanged; for non-rated officer, assign ASC 9C.
       2.4.1.8. Use the effective date of the API code for a change to an API code (inactive to active or
       vice versa), which requires an ASC change.
       2.4.1.9. Rated officers. Use the anniversary date (same month and day) plus 12, 18, 22 (if appli-
       cable), and 25-year aviation service date (ASD) when passing a gate.
       2.4.1.10. CEAs. Use the anniversary date (same month and day) plus 10, 15, 20, or 25- year ASD,
       when passing a gate.
       2.4.1.11. Parachutists. Only individuals assigned to authorized permanent (UMD “J” prefix or
       DAFSC 1C2X1, 1T2X1, and 13DX) positions, temporary or permissive jump status, or USAFA
       cadets, are authorized to have AOs published. Commander requests to initiate jump status are pro-
       cessed IAW AFI 11-410. Disqualification requests are processed IAW AFI 11-402.
           2.4.1.11.1. Use the effective date the member is assigned to a designated Unit Manpower
           Document (UMD) position that requires active jump status (“J” prefix DAFSC or AFSC
           1C2X1, 1T2X1, 13DX) IAW AFI 11-410 without a PCS change or the date a member is autho-
           rized (IAW AFI 11-410) to be attached to another US military unit requiring active parachute
           duty. The HARM office prepares AOs, assigning ASC 9E or 9D if the member is assigned to
           duty that requires both aircrew and parachutist qualification IAW AFI 11-401. The AO must
           specify type of jump duty required and pay authorized.
NOTE: HARMs do not establish ASC 9E for members who already have an ASC assigned. In such
cases, include a statement in the remarks section of the AO that member is assigned to parachute duty and
a “J” prefixed UMD DAFSC and the type of jumping/pay authorized. Do not assign an ASC to permissive
jumpers.
           2.4.1.11.2. An officer/enlisted member qualified for parachutist service who is authorized
           temporary jump status IAW AFI 11-410 will have an AO processed with an effective period
           established in the commander’s request letter and with a termination date not to exceed 180
           days. For example a qualified parachutist, currently not assigned to a “J” coded UMD position
           is approved to provide manning assistance on a Joint Readiness Exercise from 19 Jul 03
           through 23 Sep 03. HARM would publish an AO effective 19 July 03, with a termination date
           of 23 Sep 03. AO remarks would reference approval letter justification.
           2.4.1.11.3. An officer/enlisted member authorized for permissive jump status IAW AFI
           11-410 will have an AO processed with an effective period established in the commander’s
AFI11-401_AFRCSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2005                                                                         53


          request letter and the termination date will not exceed 12 months. An ASC change or HDIP is
          not authorized.
          2.4.1.11.4. Publish a new AO to change a termination date with no change in effective date,
          providing there was not a break in parachutist service. For example, a non-rated aircrew mem-
          ber or parachutist reenlistment without a break in service. If otherwise qualified, incentive pay
          and badge creditable months continue through this period.
          2.4.1.11.5. Publish a new AO when type of jump duty changes (static/HALO). Type of jump
          duty is dependent on the member’s requirement to perform HALO duties. This includes
          attending HALO school (as referenced above). If a member is in a HALO required position
          and goes PCS to a position that does not require HALO jumping, publish a new AO authoriz-
          ing static jumping/pay only.
          2.4.1.11.6. Use the day a member is no longer assigned to an authorized UMD parachutist
          position (“J” prefix, AFSC or AFSC 1C2X1, 1T2X1, or 13DX) IAW AFI 11-410 to remove
          the parachutist from parachute duty and assign ASC 06 (Conditional HDIP—Flying/Jump
          requirement terminated) at the same duty location. This includes members who are assigned to
          a unit that has no available jump authorizations (in excess of total UMD authorizations).
NOTE: Members who still have flight requirements or have an established ASC (rated/CEA) will have
an AO published to reflect termination date of jump requirements only.
          2.4.1.11.7. Use the day after departed last duty station or jump school for members who PCS
          to a base without an available UMD parachutist position (“J” prefix, AFSC or AFSC 1C2X1,
          1T2X1 or 13DX) IAW AFI 11-410 to remove the parachutist from parachute duty and assign
          ASC 06 (Conditional HDIP—Flying/Jump requirements terminated).
          2.4.1.11.8. HARMs must publish AOs for USAFA cadets participating in jump related duties
          as part of the special Airmanship Program. Use the effective date of entry to the USAFA Air-
          manship Program. The effective period of the AO authorizing parachutist service is limited to
          the period of training at the USAFA. Do not assign an aviation service code. Leave the ASC
          section of the AO blank. Neither jump duty credit or jump incentive pay are authorized.
      2.4.1.12. Non-rated aircrew members. The effective period of an AO authorizing aviation ser-
      vice as a non-rated aircrew member is limited by the member’s availability for the requirement.
      For members initially beginning aviation status, the initial AO becomes effective the date the
      member is certified for aircrew duty and is entered into a formal school where in-flight duties (not
      observation) are part of the course curriculum. Example: On 1 Jun 03, a member reports to the
      base for aircrew duty. On 15 Jun 03, the commander certified eligibility and assigns the member
      to a UMD aircrew prefix DAFSC; on 1 Jul 03, the member reports TDY to begin formal flying
      training. The initial AO effective date is 1 July 03. For in-unit initial training, the AO is effective
      when formal in-flight flying training begins after being assigned to an authorized aircrew position
      within a unit. For example: On 1 May 03, a member reports to a base for aircrew duty. On 15 May
      03, the commander certifies eligibility, assigns the member to the appropriate UMD aircrew pre-
      fixed DAFSC, and notifies the HARM of in-flight training start date. On 20 May 03, the member
      begins formal in-unit flying training. The AO effective date is 20 May 03; however, the initial
      training must lead toward initial qualification.
          2.4.1.12.1. For previous non-rated/non-CEA aircrew members, HARMs will assign ASC 9D
          (Active Non-rated Aircrew Member) effective one day after member departed last duty sta-
54                                                         AFI11-401_AFRCSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2005


           tion, providing the member is qualified for aircrew duty and is assigned to an authorized
           non-rated/non-CEA aircrew “X,” “K,” or “Q” UMD DAFSC position, not occupied by
           another active flyer. If there was no PCS involved, use the effective date of duty (if otherwise
           qualified). Reference AFI 11-402 for limitations of exceeding manpower UMD authorizations
           for non-rated/non-CEA aircrew positions.
           2.4.1.12.2. Use the date the non-rated/non-CEA aircrew member is no longer assigned to an
           authorized aircrew “X,” “K,” or “Q” prefixed UMD DAFSC to terminate aviation service and
           assign ASC 9J (Inactive-Restricted).
       2.4.1.13. Operational Support Members. Use the effective date authorized (IAW AFI 11-402)
       when man-months are authorized, not to exceed a one-month period.

2.5. Transition Status Codes (TSC). TSCs allow the HARM office to track the OFDA requirements for
rated officers, after the Air Force transitioned from the Aviation Career Incentive Act of 1974 to the Avia-
tion Career Improvement Act of 1989 and the FY 1996 National Defense Authorization Act. TSCs became
effective on 1 Oct 1991 and remained in effect until 1 Oct 2003 (guidance may apply to certain fliers and
is retained in AFI). Table 2.7. defines the TSCs and Table 2.8. shows OFDA gate requirements.

Table 2.7. Transition Status Codes (TSC).

      A         Officers who had less than 6 years of aviation service on 1 October 1991
      B         Officers who had at least 6, but less than 12 years of aviation service and accrued less
                than 72 months of OFDA on 1 October 1991.
      C         Officers who had at least 6, but less than 12 years of aviation service and accrued 72
                months or more of OFDA on 1 October 1991.
      D         Officers who had at least 12, but less than 18 years of aviation service on 1 October
                1991.
       E        Officers who had 18 years or more of aviation service on 1 October 1991.

Note 1. Aircrew members assigned TSC “D” or “E” are grandfathered under the ACIA of 1974.
Note 2. Aircrew members assigned TSC “A” require 96 months OFDA at 12 years to receive continuous
pay until 18 years, and 120 or 144 months OFDA at 18 years to receive continuous ACIP until 22 years or
25 years respectively.
Note 3. Aircrew members with an ASD between 2 Oct 1979 and 1 Oct 1985 inclusive, who accumulated
at least 72 months of OFDA as of 1 Oct 1991, are assigned TSC “C”.
         Example 1. If a member in this status accumulated 72-107 months OFDA as of 1 Oct 1991, he/she
is entitled to continuous ACIP until 18 years.
        Example 2. If the member accumulated 108-131 months OFDA as of 1 Oct 1991, he/she is entitled
to continuous ACIP until 22 years.
         Example 3. If the member accumulated at least 132 months OFDA as of 1 Oct 1991, he/she is enti-
tled to continuous ACIP until 25 years.
        Example 4. Members assigned TSC “C” with less than 132 months OFDA as of 1 Oct 1991, will
be reviewed again at 18 years to determine appropriate incentive pay action.
Note 4. Aircrew members with an ASD between 2 Oct 1979 and 1 Oct 1985 inclusive, who accumulated
less than 72 months of OFDA as of 1 Oct 1991, are assigned TSC “B”.
        Example 1. Members assigned TSC “B”, with an ASD of 2 Oct 1979 – 9 Feb 1984 inclusive,
require 108 months OFDA at the 12-year gate to receive continuous ACIP until 18 years.
     Example 2. Members assigned TSC “B”, with an ASD of 10 Feb 1984 or after, require 96 months
OFDA at the 12-year gate to receive continuous ACIP until 18 years.
        Example 3. Members assigned TSC “B” who did not meet the 12-year gate, but accumulated at
least 72 months OFDA at the 12-year gate, will be assigned ASC “5Y” and will be reviewed again at the
15-year point.

NOTES:
  1. If at 12 years of aviation service the individual has 72 months of OFDA, but less than 96 or 108
     months, his or her ASC will change to "5Y" conditional status until 15 years of aviation service.
     This will flag in ARMS that the individual needs to be looked at on his or her 15th year of avia-
     tion service. If the individual has 96 or 108 months (whichever the member’s 12-year gate
     requirement was) of OFDA by the 15th year of aviation service, he or she will receive continuous
     ACIP until the 18th year of aviation service and their ASC will change to "2Y." If the individual
     has less than 96 or108 months (their 12-year gate requirement) of OFDA, he or she will remain in
     conditional status ASC "5Y" until 18 years of aviation service, where HARM offices will again
     look at the individual.
   2. Individuals in this category will be grandfathered to the OFDA requirements under the ACIA of
      1974, although they have not reached the 12th or 18th year of aviation service, if they met the
      OFDA requirements of 72, 108, and 132 months on 1 October 1991. Otherwise, they must meet
      the OFDA requirements listed above at 18 years of aviation service. When an individual reaches
      their 12th or 18th year of aviation service, they will receive the appropriate entitlement status
58                                                          AFI11-401_AFRCSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2005


        code required at that time. If individuals do not meet the required OFDA for continuous ACIP,
        they enter conditional status.

        Example A. If an individual has 72 months of OFDA, but less than 108 months on 1 October
        1991, he or she will receive continuous ACIP through 18 years of aviation service. However, at
        the 18th year of aviation service they must meet the revised criteria of 120 and 144 months OFDA
        under the ACIA of 1989 to be paid continuous ACIP through 22 and 25 years of aviation service.

        Example B. If an individual has 108 months of OFDA, but less than 132 months on 1 October
        1991, he or she will receive continuous ACIP through 22 years of aviation service. However, at
        the 18th year of aviation service they must meet the 144 months of OFDA requirement under the
        ACIA of 1989 to be paid continuous ACIP through 25 years of aviation service.

        Example C. If an individual had 132 months of OFDA on 1 October 1991, he or she will receive
        continuous ACIP until 25 years of aviation service. When an individual reaches their 12th or 18th
        year of aviation service, they will receive the appropriate entitlement status code required at that
        time. If individuals do not meet the required OFDA for continuous ACIP, they enter conditional
        status.
     3. Individuals with TSCs D and E are totally grandfathered under the ACIA of 1974 and must meet
        the requirements above for continuous ACIP. If TSC D and E individuals do not meet the required
        OFDA for continuous ACIP they will enter conditional status.

2.6. Rated Officer and Career Enlisted Aviator Operational Flying Duty. To control the award of
operational flying duty credit required by public law, HARM offices must assign active operational fliers
(FSC A) who fail to perform flying duties to a temporary status (FSC S) until: they again meet the require-
ments of this instruction; are disqualified for Aviation Service; or are reassigned to non-flying duty.
Active rated officers and CEAs recommended for DNIF are identified in ARMS by a physical availability
date and code. When the DNIF is expected to last more than 30 days or has lasted for 30 days, ARMS
automatically reports the member on the Headquarters Operations Resource Information System interface
as FSC G. (The FSC G is for reporting purposes only.) Such personnel are entitled to Operational Flying
Duty Accumulation (OFDA). An AO change is not necessary. Individuals continue to accumulate opera-
tional flying duty credit until FSC S applies.
     2.6.1. Operational flying is flying performed in assignments which require an individual to maintain
     basic aircrew flying skills. Rated officers and CEAs must attain and maintain, as a minimum, basic
     aircraft qualification in mission or support aircraft. One of the following indicates the need to fly:
        2.6.1.1. The assigned API code associated with a specific position.
        2.6.1.2. Assignment to a formal course of flying instruction.
        2.6.1.3. A case-by-case determination by HQ USAF/XOO when unusual circumstances dictate.
     2.6.2. The requirement for the Air Force to track the flying activity of rated members, other than
     flight surgeons and UFT students, is based upon the Aviation Career Incentive Act (ACIA) of 1974
     and the ACIA of 1989, FY 96 NDAA, and FY 99 NDAA. These acts establish the criteria to deter-
     mine eligibility for ACIP. The requirement to track flight activity of CEAs is based upon the FY 00
     NDAA.
AFI11-401_AFRCSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2005                                                                         59


       2.6.2.1. The 1974 Act sets standards of minimum experience necessary to receive ACIP; these
       are: at least 72 months (6 years) of operational flying completed prior to the 12th year of aviation
       service and 108 months (9 years) of flying completed by the 18th year of aviation service. Indi-
       viduals meeting these gates are, if otherwise qualified (medically and physiologically [if applica-
       ble]), entitled to continuous ACIP until the 22nd year of aviation service (using an individual's
       ASD), without meeting a specific flying performance standard. Members who complete at least
       132 months (11 years) of operational flying by the 18th year of aviation service receive, if other-
       wise qualified, continuous entitlement to ACIP until the 25th year of aviation service. Those who
       fail to meet the standards are conditionally entitled to ACIP only through a minimum performance
       standard by flying an average of four hours per month (two hours for ARC members) while
       assigned to operational flying duties. In addition, rated officers with over 25 years of aviation ser-
       vice (grade O-6 and below) and assigned to operational flying positions may receive conditional
       ACIP.
NOTE: An officer's ASD is normally the date he or she began UFT. (See AFI 11-402 for additional guid-
ance.)
       2.6.2.2. The 1989 Act modified the required OFDA months rated officers must achieve for ACIP
       entitlement. The new law established revised OFDA requirements of 9, 10, and 12 years from ear-
       lier requirement of 6, 9, and 11 years. The effective date for the new criteria was 1 October 1991.
       On 1 October 1991, the USAF began transition to the new gate structure and rated members were
       assigned Transition Status Codes (TSC) in order to determine their gate requirements. Rated offic-
       ers with ASDs of 1 October 1985 and later were required to meet the 9, 10, and 12-year OFDA
       requirements under the ACIA of 1989. However, the FY96 NDAA again modified gate require-
       ments.
       2.6.2.3. The FY 96 NDAA modified the required gates rated officers must achieve for ACIP enti-
       tlement established by the 1989 Act. The new law established revised OFDA requirements for
       rated members who completed, or will complete, 12 years of aviation service on, or after, 10 Feb
       1996. Rated members with the TSC of A must perform 8 years or more of OFDA within their first
       12 years of aviation service to qualify for continuous ACIP through 18 years of aviation service.
       Rated members who completed 12 or more years of aviation service prior to 10 Feb 1996 must
       have performed at least 9 years of OFDA within their first 12 years of aviation service to qualify
       for continuous ACIP through 18 years of aviation service. Rated members who did not meet the
       original 9 years of OFDA and are beyond 12 years of aviation service remain entitled to condi-
       tional ACIP contingent upon meeting the monthly flying hour requirement.
       2.6.2.4. The FY 99 NDAA changed the way ACIP was computed for all rated officers. Previ-
       ously, eligibility was based on the anniversary of the Officer Service Date (OSD). The FY 99
       NDAA changed the eligibility to the anniversary of the ASD. This change did not apply to those
       fliers who had passed their 22 or 25 years of OSD and had their ACIP terminated under the ACIA
       of 1974.
       2.6.2.5. The FY 00 NDAA set standards of minimum experience necessary for CEAs to receive
       CEFIP: at least 72 months (6 years) of operational flying completed prior to the 10th year of avia-
       tion service and 108 months (9 years) of flying completed by the 15th year of aviation service, and
       168 months (14 years) completed by the 20th year of aviation service. Individuals meeting these
       gates are, if otherwise qualified (medically and physiologically [if applicable]), entitled to contin-
       uous CEFIP until their 25th year of aviation service and without meeting a specific flying perfor-
60                                                           AFI11-401_AFRCSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2005


        mance standard. Those members who fail to meet the standards are entitled to conditional CEFIP
        only through a minimum performance standard by flying an average of four hours per month (two
        hours for ARC members) while assigned to operational flying duties until they reach their next
        gate.
     2.6.3. In accordance with Title 37, U.S. Code, Section 301a and AFI 36-2110 paragraph 2.9, it is Air
     Force policy that as many members as possible complete at least 10 years of operational flying (sec-
     ond gate) by the 18th year of aviation service, however not all officers will fulfill the requirements to
     receive ACIP through 25 years of aviation service (third gate ).
     2.6.4. OFDA Computations. To receive credit for a month of OFDA, an individual must:
        2.6.4.1. Be assigned to primary or corollary duties that require flying and perform valid flying
        duties in the current month or preceding three months which authorize OFDA credit.
        2.6.4.2. Be assigned to rated/CEA in-flight or similar AVO duties in an FSC A, U, X, or Z for at
        least 15 days within each calendar month that he or she received operational flying credit from the
        current month of creditable flying or previous three months of creditable flying duty. Rated offic-
        ers or CEA members assigned to an active flying billet pending a PCS assignment to an inactive
        assignment should ensure that they sign out on or later than the 16th day of the month in order to
        receive OFDA credit. They must have also performed OFDA-creditable flying within three
        months of the departure month.
        2.6.4.3. Have no more than 18 years of aviation service for rated officers and 20 years of aviation
        service for career enlisted aviators.
        2.6.4.4. Individuals initially assigned to flying duty (FSC A) or returning to such duty from a dis-
        qualified or inactive status, other than FSC S, receive OFDA credit from the date of assignment of
        an active FSC. If such individuals do not fly within three months of that date, retroactively change
        the active FSC to FSC S, effective the day following the date of initial assignment of the active
        FSC. Deduct OFDA credit (which began accruing with assignment of the original active FSC) and
        terminate OFDA credit. Assign an active FSC when flying begins, effective two months before the
        date of the first flight. OFDA credit begins from that date. EXAMPLE: Captain Wiggins is
        assigned FSC A on 19 December but first flies on 17 April: On 20 March, the HARM changes the
        FSC A to an S, effective 20 December. Captain Wiggins accumulated three months OFDA credit
        for January, February, and March. (Do not credit December because less than 15 days was in an
        active ASC during that month.) The FSC S action deducts the three months credited and stops fur-
        ther accumulation. On 17 April, change the FSC S to FSC A, effective 17 February. This retroac-
        tive change restarts OFDA credit. Do not award OFDA credit for February (less than 15 days
        assigned), but do award credit for March and April. Credit continues to accumulate until the indi-
        vidual fails to perform for a period greater than three months.
NOTE: Non-performance does not apply to CEAs prior to 1 Oct 99; however, CEAs who were on active
flying status as of 1 Oct 99 are considered “initially assigned to flying duties (FSC A)” effective 1 Oct 99.
The guidance in this paragraph applies. For example, SSgt Harris, a flight engineer, was on 9D status from
5 Sep 94 through 30 Sep 99. Effective 1 Oct 99, her ASC was changed from 9D to AA. Her first flight
after initial assignment to FSC A was 15 Feb 00. Therefore, the HARM office processed an AO to change
her ASC from AA to AS (Inactive-Nonperformance) effective 2 Oct 99, the day after her initial assign-
ment to FSC A. The HARM office then processes a subsequent AO to change SSgt Harris’ FSC from S to
FSC A effective 15 Dec 99, two months prior to the date of her first flight.
AFI11-401_AFRCSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2005                                                                        61


      2.6.4.5. When aircrew members who are actively flying prior to reaching 18 years (rated) and 20
      years (CEA) of aviation service do not perform by the end of the third month following the month
      in which flying duties were last performed, change FSC to “S” and stop OFDA credit. The FSC
      becomes A when flying begins effective on the date of flight. Do not award retroactive credit.
      EXAMPLE: Lt Ostrowski flew on 14 May and did not fly again until 18 November: The HARM
      assigns FSC S on 1 September. Credit OFDA for May, June, July, and August. The HARM
      changes the FSC back to “A” on 18 November. There is no OFDA credit for November because
      assignment to FSC A was less than 15 days.

2.7. OFDA Waivers. The Aviation Career Improvement Act of 1989 authorized the Secretary of the Air
Force (SECAF) to waive OFDA requirements for rated officers and CEAs who are unable to meet their
flying gates due to reasons beyond their control. Each year, MAJCOM commanders submit nominations
for Lieutenant Colonels and below to HQ USAF/XOOT or, for CMSgts and Colonels and above, to HQ
USAF/AFSLMO for staffing to SECAF. To implement this program the following procedures apply:
   2.7.1. Rated officers assigned TSCs A, B, C, and CEAs are eligible for flying gate waivers. Because
   TSC D and E rated officers were grandfathered to the pre-ACIA of 1989 OFDA requirements, they
   are not eligible for flying gate waivers. Candidate rated officers must have at least 72 months (6 years)
   of OFDA credit. Candidate CEAs must have at least 60 months (5 years) of OFDA credit prior to the
   gate the waiver is being submitted for.
      2.7.1.1. For retroactive gate waivers which are approved by SECAF, for rated officers who obtain
      72 months or CEAs who obtain 60 months of OFDA credit after their 12 or 10 years of aviation
      service respectively, members will be authorized continuous AOs from the month in which they
      completed 72 or 60 months credit. (Members are not qualified for continuous entitlement prior to
      meeting qualification requirements). For example: Major Blinn reached her 12 year flying gate on
      18 January 00 and only accumulated 60 months of OFDA, 36 months short of the 12 year gate
      requirement and was assigned ASC 5A, conditional entitlement status. On 17 January 01 she
      accumulated 72 months of OFDA and applied for a waiver of her 12 year gate requirements on
      that date. SECAF approved a 24-month OFDA waiver on 15 April 01 and Major Blinn’s HARM
      was directed to publish an AO changing Major Blinn’s ASC from 5A to 2A effective 17 January
      01 and start continuous ACIP.
      2.7.1.2. For gate waivers submitted from the MAJCOM or equivalent, and approved by SECAF
      prior to loss of continuous pay, members will be authorized continuous AOs from the gate anni-
      versary date (if otherwise qualified).
      2.7.1.3. For gate waivers submitted from the MAJCOM or equivalent, and approved by SECAF
      after the loss of continuous pay, members will be authorized AOs (continuous entitlement status)
      from the date the member submitted to the MAJCOM or equivalent (if otherwise qualified).
   2.7.2. MAJCOM commanders may submit OFDA waiver nominations only when the member failed
   to achieve gates due to reasons beyond his or her control. For example: banked UPT graduates,
   extended DNIFs, individuals assigned to deactivating/draw down flying units or Air Liaison Officer
   assignments who cannot be placed into another flying position, and rated officers assigned to non-fly-
   ing duties necessary to comply with the requirements of the Goldwater-Nichols Act (joint duty
   schools/follow-on tours) or the Acquisition Public Law.
62                                                          AFI11-401_AFRCSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2005


        2.7.2.1. Officers and CEAs selected for highly competitive and nominative assignments that are
        decided at AF/AFPC/MAJCOM central selection boards, such as the School of Advanced Aero-
        space Studies or other services’ equivalent schools and command positions, merit OFDA waiver
        consideration, when those assignments are specifically responsible for rated officers and CEA
        missing an OFDA gate. It is in the best interests of the Air Force to assign selected individuals to
        certain specific assignments following Professional Military Education (eg. joint duty schools and
        joint tours) or AFIT completion. Should such assignments jeopardize the achievement of OFDA
        gates, place appropriate documentation in the member’s personnel record. Documentation will
        include reasons why the member was assigned to a non-flying position (see paragraph 2.7.7..
     2.7.3. Rated officers receiving acquisition bonus monies may not be eligible for OFDA waivers.
     2.7.4. Lost OFDA months due to time spent under flying status code K (inactive--lack of support)
     does not meet this criteria unless the officer or CEA was assigned to a unit undergoing draw down or
     conversion to an aircraft where the individual’s specialty was not required (i.e., an F-4 navigator
     assigned to a unit converting to single-place fighters), or when the unit aircraft was operationally
     grounded. Individuals must meet both K code and draw down, conversion, or grounding criteria to be
     considered for a waiver.
     2.7.5. Individuals who received an OFDA waiver are not eligible for a second waiver.
     2.7.6. OFDA waivers will not apply to individuals who voluntarily turn down a flying opportunity or
     elect to move to a non-flying position, which would preclude the possibility of meeting their OFDA
     requirements (except as provided for in paragraph 2.7.2.1.. When an individual declines an opportu-
     nity to fly and is selected for a non-flying assignment, document this action in the member’s personnel
     record, as specified in paragraph 2.7.7. Reference the flying assignment that was declined.
     2.7.7. AFPC/DPA or HQ USAF/AFSLMO will document that the above situations existed at the time
     of assignment to establish an audit trail. (MAJCOMs will verify flying status code K criteria.) This
     may then be used to verify why OFDA waiver candidates were unable to achieve their flying gates.
     2.7.8. MAJCOM commanders will forward OFDA waiver nominations to HQ USAF/XOOT for
     Lieutenant Colonels and below, or to HQ USAF/AFSLMO for CMSgts, Colonels and above (include
     brief, individual narratives, and individual’s current Aviation Audit worksheet).
     2.7.9. Submit OFDA waiver requests no earlier than the year prior to loss of flight pay. Submissions
     will be to the servicing HARM office and staffed to the MAJCOM. For members assigned to Head-
     quarters, USAF, submit waivers through the individual’s supervisory chain of command (DP, XO, XP,
     etc.), then to XOOT or AFSLMO. For members not assigned to an Air Force MAJCOM (i.e. members
     assigned to organizations such as USCENTCOM, USPACOM, or USSTRATCOM), individuals will
     submit packages to their servicing Air Force HARM, which will staff requests packages to the HARM
     MAJCOM. As a minimum, the submission will include the member’s dated request letter, Aviation
     Service Worksheet, justification for OFDA request, Military Personnel Data System duty history
     (SURF), and any other documents to support justification. Packages forwarded to HAF for SECAF
     approval must also contain MAJCOM (or equivalent) indorsement.
        2.7.9.1. HARMs will review the package for accuracy and validate eligibility criteria is IAW this
        instruction. Review ARMS data/member’s FRF to validate TSC code. Do not forward TSCs not
        authorized OFDA waivers (TSC D and E).
AFI11-401_AFRCSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2005                                                                        63


     2.7.9.2. Commanders ensure waivers are submitted within the year prior to the applicable gate
     member submitted a waiver of requirements for.
         2.7.9.2.1. If the rated officer requests waiver of the first gate, submit their name during the
         officer's 11th year of aviation service; the 17th year of aviation service for a waiver of the sec-
         ond gate; and the 21st year of aviation service for a waiver of the third gate.
         2.7.9.2.2. If the CEA requests a waiver of the first gate, submit their name during the individ-
         uals 9th year of aviation service; the 14th year of aviation service for a waiver of the second
         gate; and the 19th year of aviation service for a waiver of the third gate.
  2.7.10. Eligibility criteria for Air Battle Manager gate waivers. In order to be considered, the ABM
  must meet all of the following criteria.
     2.7.10.1. In addition to using existing criteria in rated directives, an ABM must be eligible for
     Aviation Career Incentive Pay as specified in HQ USAF/XO message dated 2 Oct 99 (Subj: Rat-
     ing Air Battle Managers), and have an established Aviation Service Date.
     2.7.10.2. Must comply with provisions of para 2.7., above.
     2.7.10.3. The following ABM duties that commenced after the establishment of the ASD and
     prior to 1 Oct 99, including ABM duties in which the individual was serving an uninterrupted
     assignment beyond 1 Oct 99 may count toward an OFDA waiver on a month-to-month equivalent
     (not to exceed the minimum gate month requirement) if the member was assigned and performed
     primary duties as a mission ready Air Weapons Director, Senior Director, Air Surveillance Officer,
     Interface Control Officer, or Mission Crew Commander at a Ground Theater Air Control System
     or Air Defense unit that had an operational wartime mission (Designed Operational Capability) or
     was formally attached to one of these line units and counted toward its SORTS rating.
     2.7.10.4. After the ASD and prior to 1 Oct 99, an ABM on aviation orders and receiving Hazard-
     ous Duty Incentive Pay may credit the entire month if the individual performed ABM primary
     operational flying duty at least one day within that same month (not to exceed the minimum gate
     month requirement).
  2.7.11. After HQ USAF/XOOT or HQ USAF/AFLSMO verifies that the above criteria were met, HQ
  USAF/XO and HQ USAF/DP staff representatives will review and forward nominations to SECAF
  for consideration of an OFDA waiver (not to exceed minimum gate month requirement).
  2.7.12. MAJCOMs are responsible to ensure each individual eligible for an OFDA waiver is con-
  sidered for a waiver.
     2.7.12.1. The MAJCOM OFDA waiver process must include Operations Staff (DO) and Person-
     nel Staff (DP) to ensure compliance with all regulations and laws. Prior to MAJCOM/CC
     approval, each waiver may be sent to HQ USAF/XOOT or HQ USAF/AFSLMO for an informal
     review. Each submitted package must include a Staff Summary Sheet stating the case, any corre-
     spondences written by the individual and/or their chain of command, a current Aviation Audit
     worksheet for the individual (obtained from individual’s HARM), current ARMS IDS, and any
     other relevant background information on the case.
     2.7.12.2. HQ USAF/XOOT or HQ USAF/AFSLMO will provide a recommendation to the sub-
     mitting MAJCOM staff stating their assessment of the validity of each case. This assessment may
     be used by the MAJCOM staff to decide whether or not to forward a formal package.
64                                                          AFI11-401_AFRCSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2005


     2.7.13. AFRC and ANG will develop initial MAJCOM procedures for reviewing OFDA waiver
     packages. Following MAJCOM/CC approval, forward OFDA waiver packages to HQ USAF/XOOT
     or HQ USAF/AFSLMO for processing and final action.

2.8. Taking Part in Flying by Rated Officers. Public law and DoD directives restrict active rated flying
to officers in positions that require maintaining flying skills. If certain SECAF approved mission require-
ments are more than the number of such officers locally assigned, a minimum number of other qualified
members of the authorized rated inventory may also be assigned rated aircrew duties.
     2.8.1. Flying duties are assigned in the following precedence:
        2.8.1.1. API 1 or 2 officers assigned to support the weapon system crew ratio.
        2.8.1.2. Student officers assigned to a formal course of flying training.
        2.8.1.3. Officers assigned to positions coded API 6 or 8.
        2.8.1.4. Officers assigned to positions at MAJCOM or FOA level or below coded API 3 or 4, or
        non-rated (API 0). Assign such officers to rated aircrew duties on the basis of the most recent avia-
        tion service date, if:
            2.8.1.4.1. Their assignments provide at least 24 months of local flying availability (12 months
            at short tour bases) from the date they were first qualified.
            2.8.1.4.2. The flying assignment is to an approved operational support mission specifically
            designated by HQ USAF.
        2.8.1.5. Crewmembers cannot perform flight duties while on leave, permissive TDY, non-flying
        TDY, or participating in an orientation flight, unless required to perform their official aircrew
        duties.
        2.8.1.5. (AFRC) Air Force aircrew members on terminal leave from active duty and hired into an
        ART position requiring flying may fly in civilian status while on terminal leave. Retroactive flight
        time, Operational Flying Duty Accumulator (OFDA) or flight pay is not authorized for a period
        Aeronautical Orders (AOs) were not in effect.
     2.8.2. Special Circumstances.
        2.8.2.1. If special circumstances require active temporary (180 days or less) operational flying
        that is not according to paragraph 2.8.1., HQ USAF/XOO may approve exceptions on an individ-
        ual case basis (FAC 6/E waiver).
        2.8.2.2. If special circumstances require rated officers to perform temporary in-flight non-rated or
        non-crew (operational support duties) duties, HARMs change the member’s FAC to an 8 in
        ARMS. For rated officers who were in inactive status, publish an AO, with the FAC 8, FSC J, and
        document in remark section of AO: “Rated Officer assigned to perform in-flight non-rated (or
        non-crew) duties.” Officers performing non-rated duties log aircrew certification code “Z” on the
        AFTO Form 781 and flight time does not count towards OFDA or ACIP entitlement.
     2.8.3. Do not assign active flying duties to members who are scheduled for an academic instruction
     course of 90 days or more. Member will be assigned an FSC L.
     2.8.4. Reserve officers not on extended active duty (EAD) may be assigned to inactive rated positions
     (API 3 or API 4).
AFI11-401_AFRCSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2005                                                                       65


   2.8.4. (AFRC) This applies to changes in the rated requirement for a particular manpower authoriza-
   tion (e.g., API 6 to API 3). Changes will be submitted on the AFRC Form 106, Manpower Change
   Request, according to with AFRCI 38-201, Manpower Authorization, Allocations, and Change
   Requests.
       2.8.4.1. Send requests for removing Reservists from flying to HQ AFRC/DOTS (with copies to
       HQ USAF/REO and HQ USAF/XOOT) for approval.
       2.8.4.2. Send requests for removing ANG personnel from flying to NGB/CF (with a copy to HQ
       USAF/XOOT) for approval.

2.9. Additional Ratings. Aircrew personnel will comply with requirements of this instruction and appli-
cable Air Force aircrew training publications that pertain to their current aeronautical rating.

2.10. Flight Surgeon Flying Policy.
   2.10.1. A flight surgeon who has an additional pilot or navigator rating, and is assigned flight surgeon
   position (API 5), flies only as a flight surgeon, unless selected and approved as a pilot-physician or
   navigator-physician IAW AFI 11-405. Pilot-physicians/navigator-physicians assigned to active flying
   positions (API 1/2) fly as line pilots/navigators. HQ USAF/XO authorizes exceptions upon request,
   with complete justification from the Surgeon General (HQ USAF/SG). Flight surgeons who hold
   valid pilot or navigator ratings are entitled to only conditional ACIP and OFDA credit is not autho-
   rized, even when assigned to API 1/2 positions.
   2.10.2. Flight surgeons must be medically and physiologically (if applicable) qualified, and maintain
   flight medicine credentials before being authorized active flying status. In addition, they must be
   assigned to an API 5 unit manpower document (UMD) position with Duty Air Force Specialty Code
   (DAFSC) 48XX, or 40C0C with an additional AFSC of 48XX, be on active flying status AOs (includ-
   ing aircraft AOs), and be qualified in the aircraft to receive conditional ACIP. IAW DoD FMR
   7000.14-R, Volume 7a, Military Pay Policy and Procedures - Active Duty and Reserve Pay, flight sur-
   geons are conditional fliers and qualification for entitlement to conditional ACIP is earned by com-
   pleting a prescribed minimum number of operational flying hours per month, and by performing the
   minimum flying hour requirements IAW the DoD FMR and AFI 11-421, Aviation Resource Manage-
   ment.
   2.10.2. (AFRC) Non-EAD flight surgeons assigned to an authorized flying flight surgeon position
   (API-5) may log flying time for pay aboard any military aircraft, regardless of unit assignment/attach-
   ment for flying; however, flight surgeons will fly the minimums in their primary assigned aircraft
   (PAA) according to AFI 11-202, Volume 1, Aircrew Training. Flight surgeons who are assigned to
   units with only single seat PAA and are in an authorized flying position must be attached for flying to
   a unit that can provide a PAA in which they can meet minimum requirements of AFI 11-202, Volume
   1, Aircrew Training. Flight Surgeons will return their AFTO Form 781 extracts (certified exact copy
   of original AFTO 781) and training accomplishment sheets to their HARM/SARM not later than 5
   working days after the mission. These documents can be faxed to the HARM/SARM in lieu of wait-
   ing until return from off station operations.
       2.10.2.1. When flight surgeons are assigned to non-API coded “0” positions, AOs will be termi-
       nated and members will be assigned ASC 8J. Inactive flight surgeons may be authorized to fly and
       log time without ACIP on a noninterference basis with unit training and flying schedules. Flight
66                                                           AFI11-401_AFRCSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2005


        surgeons not qualified in an aircraft, on inactive AOs, or observing ground-based UAV aircrew
        will log only “Other” flight time and document remarks on the reverse side of AFTO Form 781
        (for example, “Inactive flight surgeon,” or “Flight surgeon not qualified in aircraft”). Paragraphs
        2.16.3.through 2.16.5. apply.
     2.10.3. Pilot-Physician Procedures. AFI 11-405, The Pilot-Physician Program, prescribes procedures
     for the US Air Force Pilot-Physician Program. Pilot-physicians remain conditional fliers for ACIP
     entitlement and do not earn OFDA credit. Except as noted above, active flying pilot-physicians will be
     assigned ASC 8A, FAC 9, and API 5, and hold the DAFSC of 48VX. Retain members in ESC 8
     beyond 25 years of aviation service. Credit flight time logged as a pilot towards advanced pilot and
     flight surgeon ratings (only when member is assigned FAC 9) and ACIP entitlement.
     2.10.4. Critical Care Air Transport Team (CCATT) Procedures. Both active and inactive flight sur-
     geons may be tasked to assist CCATTs with patients on a mission.
        2.10.4.1. Active flight surgeons assigned to API 5 positions, with ASC 8A on current aircraft
        AOs, are authorized to log crew position "FS" and primary time on all USAF aircraft missions
        based on their aircraft qualification.
        2.10.4.2. Inactive flight surgeons assigned to API 0 positions, in ASC 8J and tasked to perform
        CCATT non-crew duties, are authorized to log "FZ" crew position and primary time on these mis-
        sions. When authorized, the member's HARM office will process the operational support AO.
        Assign FAC 8, and include AO remarks: "Rated officer tasked to perform CCATT non-crew FAC
        8 duties. Crew position FZ and non-crew HDIP authorized." The member's ASC remains ASC 8J.

2.11. Taking Part in Flying by Career Enlisted Aviators.
     2.11.1. Flying duties are assigned in the following precedence:
        2.11.1.1. API A or B CEAs assigned to support the weapon system crew ratio, flying training
        instruction duty, operational test and evaluation functions, Foreign Military Sales (FMS), etc.
        2.11.1.2. Students assigned to a formal course of flying training.
        2.11.1.3. Career enlisted aviators assigned to positions coded API B or D.
        2.11.1.4. Career enlisted aviators assigned to positions at MAJCOM or FOA level or below coded
        API C or E. Assign career enlisted aviators API C or E aircrew duties on the basis of the most
        recent aviation service and be careful not to cause the member to fall short of meeting OFDA
        credit.
     2.11.2. Do not assign active flying duties to members who are scheduled for an academic instruction
     course of 90 days or more.
     2.11.3. Crewmembers cannot perform flying duties while on leave, permissive TDY, non-flying
     TDY, or participating in an orientation flight, unless required to perform their official aircrew duties.
     2.11.4. If special circumstances require active temporary (180 days or less) flying that is not IAW
     paragraph 2.11.1., HQ USAF/XOO may approve exceptions on an individual case basis (FAC E
     waiver).

2.12. Taking Part in Flying by Non-rated Officer and Enlisted Members.
AFI11-401_AFRCSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2005                                                                      67


  2.12.1. Qualified personnel assigned to designated aircrew positions established in AFI 65-503 are
  shown as non-rated aircrew members (FSC D). Non-rated aircrew members are included onboard
  flights when their presence is required for the aircraft to accomplish its primary tasked mission. This
  is their full-time duty. When a full-time presence is not required, operational support flying may be
  applicable (see paragraph 2.12.2.). Non-rated aircrew members will maintain flying class III physi-
  cals.
     2.12.1.1. Enlisted aircrew members require an aircrew prefix of X (Basic Aircrew), K (Instruc-
     tor), or Q (Evaluator).
     2.12.1.2. Non-rated officer aircrew members may be assigned to duty positions with an AFSC
     prefix of X (Basic Aircrew), B (Squadron Operations Officer), C (Commander), F (Flight Test), K
     (Instructor), or Q (Evaluator).
         2.12.1.2.1. When a non-rated officer is assigned to an authorized “X” or “J” coded UMD
         position which is also a Commander (C prefix) position, the “C” prefix takes precedent over
         the “X” and “J”; however, in such cases, the “C” prefix does not eliminate the authorization to
         fly or jump. Therefore, place a remark on the individual’s AO “member occupies an X (or “J”
         coded) UMD prefix position.”
         2.12.1.2.2. When a non-rated officer fills a position as a Squadron Operations Officer (B pre-
         fix) that is also authorized as an aircrew or parachutist (X or J UMD position), place a remark
         on the individual’s AO “member occupies an X (or J coded) UMD prefix position.”
         2.12.1.2.3. FSC J (Inactive) or L (TDY School) identifies non-rated crewmembers not
         assigned to active flying positions. AOs terminate authorization to fly and entitlement to
         incentive pay.
  2.12.2. FSC C (Ops Support) identifies non-rated personnel required to perform essential inflight
  duties which cannot be accomplished by rated officers, CEAs or non-rated aircrew members. Opera-
  tional Support fliers may be required to fly on an occasional basis. However, their assigned full-time
  duties do not require them to be onboard the aircraft to accomplish its assigned primary mission.
  When their requirement to fly terminates, flight record responsibility ends. Process requests for oper-
  ational support flying IAW AFI 11-402. Authorized man-months are required prior to issuance of
  AOs.
  2.12.3. Aerospace physiologists (DAFSC 43AX) and Human Performance Training Teams (DAFSC
  4M0X1) are authorized to participate in flight duties as observers on a noninterference basis. HARM
  offices will publish AOs according to this instruction and MAJCOM directives. Neither aviation
  career incentive pay nor flying duty credit are authorized, with the exception of personnel who pro-
  vide high altitude airdrop mission support. Paragraphs 2.16.3. through 2.16.5. apply. Personnel who
  fly in support of high altitude airdrop missions will comply with AFI 11-402.
  2.12.4. Other non-rated members who fly occasionally to perform specific tasks (e.g., administrative
  duties, evaluation of equipment, maintenance, passenger escort, security for classified documents,
  crew chiefs who perform duties on the ground at the final destination or points enroute and other
  duties not authorized as operational support IAW AFI 11-402) may have AOs published according to
  this instruction and MAJCOM directives. Members who fly occasionally to obtain familiarity with the
  flying environment or directed to perform specific inflight duties on an infrequent or irregular basis
  (Commanders [including unit commanders], Operations Officers, and supervisory personnel) may do
  so under the guidelines of paragraph 1.6. Individuals in these categories will fly on a non-interference
68                                                             AFI11-401_AFRCSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2005


     basis; neither flying incentive pays nor OFDA credit are authorized; and flying is restricted to aircraft
     with adequate facilities for transporting passengers (reference DoD 4515.13-R, which restricts pas-
     senger travel in aircraft, such as, but not limited to, fighter aircraft, which are not designed or normally
     configured for passenger carrying capability). Paragraphs 2.16.3. and 2.16.5. apply. EXCEPTION:
     Members who fly on non-interference AOs will not be placed on the AFTO Form 781 (see paragraph
     1.6.2.2.).
NOTE: The frequency a member is required to perform in-flight tasks must be considered when com-
manders request AOs for non-interference fliers. Non-interference fliers who are not on AOs will be listed
on the passenger manifest.
     2.12.4. (AFRC) Members placed on aeronautical orders under this paragraph are not entitled to air-
     crew flight gear.
     2.12.5. Aircrew members not formally entered into Initial Qualification Training (e.g., Pre-Initial
     Qualification Training) will do so under orientation flight guidelines of paragraph 1.9.4.7.
     2.12.6. Crewmembers will not perform flying duties while on leave, permissive TDY, non-flying
     TDY, or participating in an orientation flight, unless required to perform their official aircrew duties.

Section 2B—Supervisory Operational Flying Positions

2.13. Supervisory Position Criteria. To conserve available resources, clearly identify rated officers and
CEA supervisory positions where the incumbent must actively fly in API 6, 8, B, and D positions to per-
form assigned duties.

2.14. Supervisory Flying.
     2.14.1. Rated officers and CEA supervisory flying is necessary to ensure that appropriate rated staff
     officers maintain a current and comprehensive background in the overall flying operations of the orga-
     nization. Although occasional indoctrination flights normally maintain inactive rated staff officers and
     career enlisted aviators at an acceptable level of experience for their jobs, it is Air Force policy that
     key supervisors closely involved in their organization's flying mission must maintain their basic flying
     skills sufficiently to provide them with expert awareness of most aspects of their unit’s mission.
     2.14.2. Supervisory flying should be performed to the maximum extent possible in primary mission
     aircraft inventory (PMAI) associated with the position. However, in the interest of fiscal responsibil-
     ity, when PMAI resources are not available or not practical to use, and maintenance of flying skills is
     mandatory, supervisory flying may be performed in the most cost-effective aircraft available.
     2.14.3. Commanders (including unit commanders) authorized to designate rated and CEA supervi-
     sory positions must minimize the impact of such flying and only those positions where active flying is
     essential are designated as API 6, 8, B, or D. Designating authorities are:
        2.14.3.1. General Officer. The Chief of Staff designates general officer operational flying posi-
        tions. MAJCOMs are not authorized to make adjustments without the Chief of Staff's approval
        (See Table 2.10.).
AFI11-401_AFRCSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2005                                                               69

       2.14.3.2. Colonel. MAJCOMs designate colonel active flying positions (API 8) by forwarding
       AF Form 480, Aircrew AFSC/Active Flying Justification, for review and approval to HQ
       USAF/AFSLMO (see AFI 38-201, Determining Manpower Requirements). Colonel flying posi-
       tions should only be for individuals who directly supervise aircraft flying operations, flight safety,
       standardization/evaluation programs, and operational readiness inspection programs. Should posi-
       tions not warrant full time flying, there may be justification for the individual to participate in the
       indoctrination flying program.
       2.14.3.3. Lieutenant Colonel and Below. MAJCOMs designate Lt Colonel-and-below rated
       officer and CEA positions that require active flying IAW AFI 38-201. If the position requires an
       AF Form 480, provide justification for flying on the form. Normally, API 8 positions are only
       authorized above wing level (NAF/FOA/DRU/MAJCOM) in safety, inspector general, and stan-
       dardization/evaluation functional areas in which flying is a requirement associated with the posi-
       tion. On occasion, justification may exist for an aircrew member to fly while in inactive status; see
       paragraph 2.16.

2.15. Supervisory Position Limitations. MAJCOMs will establish procedures to review API 6, 8, B,
and D supervisory flying positions whose incumbents are assigned FSC K (lack of support) when ade-
quate support will not be available within six months. Where practical, return such positions to API 3, 4,
C or E.

2.16. Flying by Individuals in Inactive Status. Occasionally, a rated officer or CEA in inactive status
may be required to perform operational flying on a temporary basis to complete a specific official task
(for example, to evaluate an operational flying procedure, review flying training effectiveness, take part in
a flying exercise or test program, or become familiar with a specific operational weapon system and pro-
cedure). The following policy applies:
AFI11-401_AFRCSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2005                                                                         71


  2.16.1. MAJCOMs (or MAJCOM equivalents) select and authorize rated staff and CEA positions for
  indoctrination flying. Indoctrination flying allows inflight observations of mission equipment or pro-
  cedures that will benefit the organization. Incumbent must request to fly. Take a conservative
  approach in designating these positions. MAJCOMs (or MAJCOM equivalents) will establish proce-
  dures for approval of indoctrination flying in accordance with Table 2.11. Limit incumbents to 24
  missions per fiscal year. For this purpose, a mission is all sorties performed in a single calendar day.
  MAJCOMs will identify the incumbent by FSC T.
  2.16.1. (AFRC) The AFRC/DO is the approval authority for indoctrination flying status. Request for
  indoctrination flying status must include individual's name, grade, organization, duty position, API,
  aircraft, date of flight and reason why the individual is required to fly. Forward requests through
  respective NAF/DOT to HQ AFRC/DOTF. Each NAF and ARPC provides HQ AFRC/DOT a com-
  plete list of indoctrination fliers no later than 31 August each year. Indoctrination flyers:
     2.16.1.1. (Added-AFRC) Are not responsible for any operational decision involving a flight or
     mission in which they participate.
     2.16.1.2. (Added-AFRC) May fly aboard any aircraft under AFRC operational control regardless
     of individual aircraft currency.
     2.16.1.3. (Added-AFRC) Must occupy a seat equipped with a seat belt during all takeoffs and
     landings.
     2.16.1.4. (Added-AFRC) Are not authorized any additional flying training periods (AFTP) or
     additional ground training periods (AGTP).
  2.16.2. MAJCOM commanders must approve the use of command aircraft resources to support
  indoctrination flying for personnel outside their commands.
  2.16.3. MAJCOMs must ensure individuals complete, before flight, adequate training on emergency
  procedures, life support equipment, and aircraft systems. Individuals must be physically and, where
  required, physiologically qualified.
  2.16.4. Indoctrination flights in inactive status are not operational flying duty for aviation career (fly-
  ing gate) or incentive pay purposes and do not allow authority to change ASCs except to assign FSC
  T. MAJCOMs will ensure indoctrination flying does not impact on unit training, and will not increase
  command flying hour allocations.
  2.16.5. Obtaining or maintaining aircraft qualification while in inactive status is not authorized. Doc-
  ument flights on the AFTO Form 781, ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document. Individuals
  flying in inactive status may not act as pilot in command and flights in single-place aircraft are specif-
  ically prohibited. See paragraph 3.4.1.1.1. for information on logging flying time.

Section 2C—Flight Management Administration

2.17. Host Aviation Resource Managemetn Office. The host command of the Air Force base desig-
nates within the operations group a HARM function to be the base OPR for ARMs and for FRF/JRF man-
agement of all aircrew/parachtists on base or in the locale (regardless of MAJCOM) to accomplish the
requirements of these instructions. The Wing/Group Chief, HARM office, will be the senior or most
qualified person, with a primary AFSC of 1C072, 1C092, 1C000, or civilian equivalent, with at least three
years experience in the Aviation Resource Management career field and who has otained/maintained a
Chief, HARM Special Experience Identifier qualification. The HARM office will be manned according
AFI11-401_AFRCSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2005                                                                        73


to Air Force Manpower Standard (AFMS) 13C1, OFPP Policy Letter 92-1, and the Defense Reform Ini-
tiative Directive (DRID) 20. HARM positions are inherently governmental oand only qualified 1C0X2
personnel (and government equivalent) will operate ARMS, process aviation/parachutist service entitle-
ment service actions, and monitor and validate entitlement to to flight/parachutist incentive pay.
NOTE: SARMs are authorized to maintain/manage their unit members’ FRFs/JRFs only when there is
no established HARM office for the installation or locale. Requests for exceptions to this policy must be
submitted to HQ USAF/XOOT for approval prior to operating independent SARM offices to operating
independent SARM offices.
2.17. (AFRC) Host Aviation Resource Management Office. Operations group commander will estab-
lish a HARM office when the operations group is not supported by an active duty HARM office. When
the operations group is supported by an active duty HARM office the AFRC ARM Wing Functional Man-
ager is the OPR for all AFRC ARM matters IAW AFI 11-421, Aviation Resource Management.
   2.17.1. Prepare AOs according to Attachment 3 of this instruction and AFI 11-402.
   2.17.2. Maintain all FRFs/JRFs according to this instruction, AFI 11-410, Personnel Parachute Oper-
   ations, AFI 11-421, Aviation Resource Management, AFPD 37-1, Information Management,
   AFMAN 37-123, Management of Records, and dispose of records in accordance with the Air Force
   Records Disposition Schedule (RDS), located at https://webrims.amc.af.mil. Maintain all active,
   inactive and disqualified (except ASC 06) aircrew member (including ARC personnel) FRFs/JRFs at
   the HARM office nearest to where the aircrew member maintains personnel, finance, and if possible,
   medical records. To ensure proper aviation or parachutist incentive pay validation and prevent inter-
   ruptions in the MilPDS to ARMS interface, FRF/JRF management will not change for TDY periods
   of less than 90 days. (EXCEPTION: Personnel attending formal flying courses within AETC will fol-
   low the guidelines established by Education & Training Course Announcement (ETCA) located at
   https://etca.randolph.af.mil for FRF/JRF management. For other formal courses where the member
   will accomplish flight/jump activity, ensure the TDY unit is provided an electronic copy of the mem-
   ber’s FRF/JRF.) All records maintained by the HARM office will be entered in the ARMS database.
   If the member’s personnel and finance records are maintained at different locations, the HARM office
   located nearest to where the finance records are maintained will manage the member’s FRF. Request
   exceptions to this procedure from HQ USAF/XOOT.
   2.17.3. Work closely with the servicing flight medical facility to ensure immediate and accurate
   exchange of flight management and flight medical data. Establish written procedures (either a memo-
   randum of agreement or include in supplement to this AFI) between the aircrew/parachutist member’s
   flight surgeon’s office and the HARM to ensure required documentation is received. As a minimum,
   this means:
       2.17.3.1. The Flight Surgeon Office (FSO) will provide the initial flight surgeon notification to
       the HARM office when required periodic physical examinations have been carried out, or when
       changes occur in an individual’s medical status that affect flying availability. Suspense is one duty
       day.
       2.17.3.2. Send completed medical examination results (AF Form 1042, Medical Recommenda-
       tions for Flying or Special Operational Duty) to the HARM office within 10 duty-days. If the
       medical examination is incomplete due to reasons beyond the member's control, the appropriate
       medical waiver authority may extend certification to cover administrative processing. The FSO
       must inform the HARM office via AF Form 1042 if an aircrew member has had their medical cer-

        tification extended by the applicable waiver authority. The official date of the AF Form 1042 will
        be the date of the flight surgeon’s signature.
     2.17.4. Validate entitlement to flying/jump incentive pays with member’s finance office. Establish
     written procedures (either a memorandum of agreement or include in supplement to this AFI) between
     the aircrew/parachutist member’s finance office and the HARM to ensure required documentation is
     received to validate flight/jump pay entitlement.
     2.17.5. Validate personnel data changes with member’s unit orderly room. Contact the MPF to obtain
     a UMD and a personnel listing to reflect member’s current assignment data. Establish written proce-
     dures (either a memorandum of agreement or include in supplement to this AFI) between the aircrew/
     parachutist member’s unit orderly room or personnel office and the HARM to ensure required docu-
     mentation is received. As a minimum, validate DAFSC, API, effective date of duty, unit manning
     position numbers and active duty (AGR) or non-EAD status for ARC personnel.

or Aircraft

2.20. Attachment for Flying/Parachuting.
     2.20.1. Aircrew/parachutist members who are assigned by PCS/PCA orders, in active flying/para-
     chutist positions, to US Air Force units and organizations without flying facilities or aircraft may be
     attached for flying/parachuting to flying/parachute units. Individuals must request (in writing) attach-
     ment for flying/jumping through their chain of command to their MAJCOM/DO (EXCEPTION:
     Request for attachment for flying/parachuting is not required if flying/parachuting support is
     addressed by a host-tenant agreement). This request must include: Individual’s name, rank, Social
     Security Number (SSN), aviation service date (ASD), aviation service code (ASC), aeronautical rat-
     ing (or badge), expected duration of attachment, date of separation (DOS)/expiration of term of ser-
     vice (ETS), assigned duty position title/position number/API code, aircraft last qualified in, date last
     flown, current AO, current AF Form 1042, and requested unit of attachment and point of contact.
     Parachutists only need information listed above, applicable to parachuting. Individuals should coordi-
     nate flying/parachute qualification, currency and attachment with requested units prior to submitting
     formal request. For attachments outside an individual’s MAJCOM, submit request to both MAJCOMs
     for coordination. MAJCOMs will develop their own procedures for attachments within their own
     MAJCOM.
     2.20.1. (AFRC) Aircrew members seeking attachment to AFRC units will coordinate with the
     desired unit of attachment and submit request with comments to appropriate NAF/DOT in writing.
     NAFs forward request for approval to AFRC/DOT. The request for attachment will include the name,
     base of assignment and phone number of the HARM currently maintaining the aircrew member's FRF.
     The SARM at the unit of attachment will track ground and flying training requirements for attached
     flyers in ARMS. The attachment will remain in effect for 3 years or when attachment is no longer
     required, whichever occurs first. If the attachment must remain in effect for more than 3 years, the
     member must request a continuation of the attachment. The following rules apply until the attached
     flyer module of ARMS is fixed:
        2.20.1.1. (Added-AFRC) Attached flyers are identified in ARMS using a dummy ID. This ID is
        a nine-digit numeric identification code entered in the SSN block.
            2.20.1.1.1. (Added-AFRC) The first three digits identify the MAJCOM. The code for AFRC
            (Host locations only) is “878.” The fourth and fifth digits represent the assigned HARM code
            within the MAJCOM. AFRC assigned HARM codes are on Table 2.14. (Added) The last
            four digits will be assigned sequentially starting with 0001. HARMs must develop procedures
            to ensure duplication does not occur.
AFI11-401_AFRCSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2005                                                                       77


          2.20.1.1.2. (Added-AFRC) If co-located with an active duty HARM, the active duty HARM
          will provide the dummy ID to reserve squadrons, using their MAJCOM and HARM Code.
       2.20.1.2. (Added-AFRC) Attached flyers are assigned a service category of "F" (foreign flyer)
       within ARMS to preclude inclusion of any of their data in the CHARM report.
       2.20.1.3. (Added-AFRC) The individual aircrew member or ARM personnel of the attached unit
       will coordinate with the attached member’s HARM office and have them provide copies of the air-
       crew member’s AF IMT 1042, Medical Recommendations for Flying or Special Operational
       Duty, and AF IMT 702, Individual Physiological Training Record to ensure the data created in the
       ARMS “dummy” record is accurate.
       2.20.1.4. (Added-AFRC) Aircrew members attached to units for flying will notify the unit when
       the flying attachment is no longer required. The unit of attachment will notify the appropriate
       NAF. Each NAF provides HQ AFRC/DOTF a complete list of attached fliers no later than 31
       August each year.
   2.20.2. Attachment units must provide resources necessary to complete and maintain the minimum
   training requirements established in the applicable aircrew/parachutist training publications (this
   includes TDY cost to formal training courses). However, the unit to which the member is assigned is
   responsible for the TDY cost for the member’s travel to the attached unit to meet normal training
   requirements. The attached unit is also responsible for maintaining the FEF.
   2.20.2. (AFRC) Rated personnel on EAD approved for flying attachment to AFRC units are limited
   to the minimum flying requirements outlined in applicable aircrew training publications; exceptions
   are at the discretion of the OG/CC.

Section 2E—Flying with Reserve Component Units

2.21. In addition to the guidance provided in this section, aircrew personnel must comply with Total
Force Absorption Program (TFAP) guidance contained in AFI 11-412, Aircrew Management.

2.22. Flying With ANG Units.
   2.22.1. The ANG Wing Commander must concur on all active duty flying with ANG units. Flying is
   restricted to Air Force advisors and aircrews who support unit training objectives, contingencies, or
   operational missions to include those aircrew that inspect, standardize, augment, or assist in unit con-
   version. (Individuals will not be listed on the ANG web page since they are not formally attached to
   an ANG unit for the purpose of obtaining continuation training.) Active duty aircrew attached to Air
   Warrior, Combat Archer and Combat Hammer are authorized to fly with ANG units with concurrence
   of the deployed commander’s approval.
   2.22.2. Active duty flying with ANG units for the sole purpose of continuation training (CT) is pro-
   hibited without concurrence from the individual’s MAJCOM/DO and ANG/XO (Future Total Force
   [FTF] wings excepted). Forward all requests for CT flying with appropriate MAJCOM/DO and ANG
   Wing Commander concurrence to ANG/XOOS for ANG/XO approval. Requests will include: name
   and rank, office symbol (e.g., 9 AF/DOV), primary aircraft MDS (e.g., F-16C, C-130E), and aircrew
   position (e.g., IP, IN), along with the reason training cannot be accomplished at the member’s current
   location. Active duty aircrew who fly CT sorties with the ANG will be listed on the ANG web page at
78                                                           AFI11-401_AFRCSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2005

     with the ANG unit as specified.
     2.22.3. Active duty aircrew members authorized to fly ANG aircraft in accordance with paragraph
     2.22.2. may coordinate sortie support directly with the unit. Members must provide the supporting
     unit operations group commander with a source for verifying currencies, egress training, flight quali-
     fication, etc., before flying. The supporting unit operations group commander is the final authority for
     determining when active duty aircrew may fly unit aircraft.
     2.22.4. All flying will be conducted in accordance with applicable US Air Force, MAJCOM, and
     ANG instructions.

2.23. AFRC Bases and Facilities. Active duty rated aircrew members, except for active duty Air Force
advisors to AFRC units and active duty aircrew members assigned/attached to AFRC units under TFAP,
will send requests for flying support and requests for exceptions to policy to HQ AFRC/DOT, Robins
AFB GA 31098-5000, with an information copy to HQ USAF/XOOT.
2.23. (AFRC) AFRC Bases and Facilities. Members of the active duty higher headquarters evaluation
teams on scheduled unit visits (e.g., operational readiness inspections and stan/eval formal visits) are
authorized to fly in AFRC aircraft. ANG/ACC/AMC rated officers assigned to the ANG/AFRC Test Cen-
ter (AATC) or directly involved in an AATC test project are authorized to fly AFRC aircraft in the perfor-
mance of AATC duties. All other flying by non-AFRC aircrew members in AFRC aircraft (with the
exception of those covered by a MAJCOM Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) or Memorandum of
Understanding (MOU) as outlined in paragraph 2.25. (Added)) must be approved by the AFRC unit,
applicable NAF/DO and HQ AFRC/DOT. AFRC units will forward all non-AFRC aircrew member flight
requests through their respective NAFs to HQ AFRC/DOT for consideration at least 15 days before
planned flight. EXCEPTION: 10 AF/DO has approval authority for ACC active duty aircrew members
on the current list of authorized ACC fliers coordinated between HQ ACC/DOTB and HQ AFRC/DOTF.
This list will be updated at least once each year.

2.24. Coordination Authorization. Direct communication with MAJCOMs, ANG, and AFRC con-
cerning attachment of rated personnel is authorized.
2.25. (Added-AFRC) MAJCOM MOA/MOU Interfly Agreements With Active Duty and ANG Air-
crew Members. AFRC operations group commanders are authorized to approve flights with AFRC units
for aircrew members not assigned or attached to an AFRC unit. Such aircrew members must provide
operations group commanders with a source for validating aircrew qualifications, training and currencies
prior to flying. AFRC OG/CCs will forward information copies of interfly agreements to the respective
NAF/DO and AFRC/DOT.
     2.25.1. (Added-AFRC) Interfly agreements may involve the exchange and/or substitution of aircrew
     members and/or aircraft between different MAJCOM units to accomplish flying in support of contin-
     gencies, exercises or designated missions according to the appropriate OPLAN/CONOPS.
     2.25.2. (Added-AFRC) During interfly operations aircraft ownership will not transfer. Aircraft
     hours executed will be credited to the command and unit of assignment of the aircraft regardless of the
     crew MAJCOM affiliation.
AFI11-401_AFRCSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2005                                                            79


  2.25.3. (Added-AFRC) When active and/or ANG crews operate an AFRC aircraft, the appropriate
  AFRC mission symbol will be used on the AFTO Form 781. When AFRC crews fly active or ANG
  aircraft, active and/or ANG mission symbols will be used.
  2.25.4. (Added-AFRC) As a minimum, interfly crewmembers will be qualified/certified in the MDS
  and model as well as system/configuration required to fly the aircraft and/or mission.

                                     FLIGHT DOCUMENTATION

Section 3A—Records Maintenance

3.1. Flight and Jump Records and Aviation Resource Management System (ARMS) Functional
Responsibility. The individual flight or jump record folders are the official source documents for deter-
mining incentive entitlement, current flying or jump status, and total experience. HARM offices will
maintain and enter in the ARMS database all aircrew/parachutist members’ FRFs/JRFs whose personnel
records are maintained by base Military Personnel Flight (MPF), Accounting Finance Office, (AFO), and
base flight surgeon office. FRFs/JRFs will be maintained by the Air Force HARM office closest to the
member’s MPF and AFO. Dispose of Air Force records in accordance with the Air Force Records Dispo-
sition Schedule (RDS), located at https://webrims.amc.af.mil, and this instruction.
     3.1.1. Use these records as the basis for USAF flying resource inventory reporting (RCS:
     HAF-XOO[M&AR]7103). This report provides essential individual flying information to HQ USAF
     and MAJCOMs. HARM offices ensure the report is transmitted not later than the 10th of each month
     (or as soon as possible for special reports). Continue to report during emergency conditions, prece-
     dence delayed (Emergency Status Code C-3). Continue reporting during MINIMIZE.
     3.1.2. The HARM office is the sole approval authority (except for HQ USAF/XOOT) at each flying
     base that determines entitlement and the starting and stopping of Aviation Career Incentive Pay
     (ACIP), Career Enlisted Flyer Incentive Pay (CEFIP), and Hazardous Duty Incentive Pay (HDIP) for
     flying and parachute duties. The HARM office interprets public law as it pertains to these incentive
     pays along with auditing, reconciliation, and waivers of these incentive pays; is the single point of
     contact for ARMS; and is responsible for the following procedures:
        3.1.2.1. The HARM office, supported by the standard ARMS, keeps FRFs/JRFs for all flying
        (active and inactive) and jump personnel in the assigned HARM code established for that base.
        The Standard Systems Group ARMS program manager will allocate one ARMS database code per
        base. The HARM Office must be located in a securable area so that when HARM personnel are
        not present integrity of privacy act material is properly maintained.
            3.1.2.1.1. Base HARM offices keep the FRFs/JRFs for all assigned tenant and attached per-
            sonnel ordered to take part in regular and frequent flights as aircrew, operational support mem-
            bers, and parachutists. This includes all active duty and ARC active and inactive aircrew
            members, active operational support members, and parachutists.
            3.1.2.1.2. Base HARM offices will combine the FRF and JRF into one four-part folder for
            dual qualified aircrew and parachutist members. File documents IAW AFI 11-421.
            3.1.2.1.3. FRFs/JRFs for disqualified aircrew or parachutists (entitlement status 0) are kept
            for five years after such designation. After five consecutive years, return the FRF/JRF to the
            member. (EXCEPTION: for UFT students disqualified from training and operational support
            fliers removed from flying for more than one year, release the FRF to the member.)
     3.1.3. Initiate a Military Pay Order (MPO) (except for non-USAF members) within 5 work days
     when:
AFI11-401_AFRCSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2005                                                                        81


      3.1.3.1. Any aircrew/parachutist member initially meets or fails to meet flight/jump entitlement
      requirements for pay.
      3.1.3.2. Flight/jump requirements for pay have been met after a period of failing to meet mini-
      mum flight/jump requirements (or a period of suspension disqualification has been removed), or
      an individual otherwise regains entitlement to incentive pay.
      3.1.3.3. An individual in conditional entitlement status (ESC 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, E, F, G, or H) departs
      PCS to a non-flying or non-jump position.
      3.1.3.4. A parachutist enters in a 12-month Rule 3 waiver period IAW DODFMR and AFI
      11-421, Aviation Resource Management. HARM will terminate pay until jump requirements are
      met.
   3.1.4. Release the FRF to individual custody only after the HARM receives:
      3.1.4.1. Official PCS orders or TDY orders indicating a TDY with another USAF activity for a
      period of 30 days or more. (Units have the option to transfer records to the gaining HARM office
      for TDYs.)
      3.1.4.2. Official retirement or separation orders.
      3.1.4.3. Notice that the aircrew member has been disqualified for more than five consecutive
      years.
      3.1.4.4. MAJCOMs will establish temporary sign-out procedures.
NOTE: HARM office personnel will not release the FRF/JRF to a member in suspended status.
   3.1.5. Release of Data from Flight/Jump Records.
      3.1.5.1. Information maintained in the FRF/JRF is subject to the provisions of the Privacy Act of
      1974. HARM offices have a legal obligation to safeguard these records from unlawful disclosure.
      Standard ARMS reports or ad hoc queries which contain personal data will have the symbol
      “(PA)” in the product title and contain the statement “Personal Data - Privacy Act of 1974.”
      3.1.5.2. The disclosure of information, for any purpose, to other than those AF activities with an
      official need, for which the record was created, without expressed written consent of the member
      concerned, is not authorized.
      3.1.5.3. Data may not be disclosed to agencies, except where allowed by law, outside the Depart-
      ment of Defense. Reference AFI 33-332, Air Force Privacy Act Program. Maintain a record of
      each disclosure to include name and address of the person or agency receiving the data, date,
      nature and purpose of each disclosure.
          3.1.5.3.1. A copy of disclosure is retained on file as part of the FRF/JRF. Prior to releasing the
          FRF/JRF, the HARM office will remove all records disclosures. Retain the disclosure account-
          ing on file for five years or the life of the record, whichever is longer.
      3.1.5.4. The Pilot Records Improvement Act of 1996 requires that before the airlines hire a pilot,
      the air carrier must request and receive certain records from “any carrier or other persons that has
      employed the individual at any time during the preceding five years.” Before any information is
      released to an agency based on this Act, HARM offices must receive a written release of informa-
      tion statement from the applicant via the agency or applicant. This statement confirms the appli-
      cant agrees to the release of their records to the air carrier. If the requester does not supply this
82                                                          AFI11-401_AFRCSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2005


        statement, the HARM office will not release any information. HARM offices must release infor-
        mation within 30 days of receipt of the request. Additionally, the releaser must provide notice to
        the applicant that a release request has been received and inform the applicant of their right to
        receive a copy of the records. The HARM office will provide the ARMS products listed below and
        documents (preceding five years from the date of employment application of the member) con-
        tained in the member’s Flying Evaluation Folder (FEF) if maintained by the HARM office. If the
        member’s FEF is maintained in another location the HARM office must obtain copies and provide
        to the requesting agency.
            3.1.5.4.1. Individual Flight Record (IFR).
            3.1.5.4.2. Flying History Report (FHR)
     3.1.6. The FRFs/JRFs of personnel assigned or attached to other than USAF activities must be kept
     by the base designated by:
        3.1.6.1. The parent command for individual aircrew members or parachutists on duty with other
        US military services.
        3.1.6.2. The MAJCOM with geographical cognizance over the area or country to which the indi-
        vidual is assigned or attached for duty with an allied service or on duty with non-US military agen-
        cies.
        3.1.6.3. If the individual’s FRF/JRF is required at the crewmember’s or parachutist’s duty station,
        a duplicate copy of the FRF/JRF will be provided to the flier’s duty station. The master record will
        be kept at the HARM office designated by the MAJCOM.
        3.1.6.4. Notify the member’s parent MAJCOM prior to the FSC “S” or “4” exceeding the 180-day
        limit.
NOTE: MAJCOM notification is not required for members assigned to FSC S due to extended DNIF.

Section 3B—Logging of Flight Activity (ARMS)

3.2. Background Information. This section explains the conditions under which personnel are autho-
rized to log flight activity into ARMS. ARMS will be used for tracking and management of all aircrew
and operational support flight activity.
     3.2.1. Flight data must be recorded and accumulated accurately to provide commanders with mean-
     ingful flight experience information to ensure resources are used effectively, and only qualified per-
     sonnel receive incentive pay. Units will follow AFI 33-360V2, Forms Management Program, to
     develop local training accomplishment forms for entering training data into ARMS.
     3.2.1. (AFRC) AFRC units may use ARMS AFRC reports program generated forms (i.e. AFRC
     Forms 58a, MAR [Mission Accomplishment Report] Format 1, 58b, MAR Format 2, 58c, MAR
     Format 3 and 58d, MAR Format 4), or locally devised training accomplishment report (TAR) forms.
     Local forms must be approved through Wing channels with courtesy copy to NAF IM.
        3.2.1.1. (Added-AFRC) An AFTO Form 781 and a MAR/TAR form for each aircrew member
        must be completed after each flight/mission.
     3.2.2. The Air Force flying program must be designed to ensure that each individual actively engaged
     in performing airborne duties maintains at least the basic professional skills necessary to perform in
AFI11-401_AFRCSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2005                                                                          83


   member’s aircrew specialty. This requires accurately logged flight and simulator activity to record and
   monitor the accumulation of experience.

3.3. Crediting Flight Time. Credit flying time as follows:
   3.3.1. To credit flight activity, personnel must:
       3.3.1.1. Be physically qualified (member cannot be in DNIF status).
       3.3.1.2. Be physiologically qualified (if applicable for the aircraft).
       3.3.1.3. Be on AOs to take part in frequent and regular flights as aircrew, to obtain aircrew quali-
       fication, or as operational support members (IAW AFI 11-402).
       3.3.1.4. Be under an approved aircrew qualification code (based on AF Form 8 qualification) and
       aircrew position identifier (Table A2.3.) designated on a flight authorization for the aircraft.
       3.3.1.5. Be part of the crew complement (AFI 65-503) authorized to perform aircrew duties in the
       aircraft in order to obtain and maintain aircrew qualification, or be required for the mission.
           3.3.1.5.1. Individuals required for the mission who are not part of the crew complement may
           log flying time only when specifically authorized (e.g. AEs, CROs, PJs, combat camera, etc.,
           required for the mission), or perform mission-related observation or evaluation duties. Except
           as noted in paragraph 3.4.1.6., written authorization for flight duty is required to be on file
           with the HARM office prior to the mission. The unit commander with operational control of
           the mission or the flying unit flight authorization authenticating official will issue the authori-
           zation, to include justification. (See Attachment 6 for example. Contact SARM office for
           assistance with letter.) The mission requirement letter will be permanently filed in the mem-
           ber’s FRF, as a source document to validate flying time logged. Members must comply with
           all other applicable requirements to include medical clearance and physiological training (if
           applicable).
               3.3.1.5.1.1. Members who do not have a specific aircraft listed on their current aircraft
               AOs, but who have completed qualification requirements for that specific aircraft and are
               tasked to perform operational flying duties in the specific aircraft, must provide to the
               HARM office a source document that authorizes the member to perform inflight duties in
               the aircraft specified. A verbal order is authorized IAW paragraphs 1.6.2.1.1. and
               A3.3.1.2., but must be followed up with a written letter to the member’s servicing HARM
               office within three duty-days. This letter is the source document for logging operational
               flying time on an aircraft (in lieu of an aircraft AO) on an infrequent basis.
NOTE: Commanders must process an aircraft AO request IAW AFI 11-402, to add aircraft to the mem-
ber’s current operational aircraft authorization, for aircrew members obtaining and maintaining additional
aircraft qualification.
           3.3.1.5.2. Non-aircrew members assigned to flying unit commander positions may log flying
           time in assigned aircraft. Individuals will fly on a non-interference basis (paragraph 2.12.4.),
           will use crew position “OX” (Colonel and above) or “XX” (Lt Col and below) IAW Table
           A2.3., and log other time on the AFTO Form 781 for entry into ARMS.
   3.3.2. Flights in any other capacity are to be considered familiarization and/or incentive orientation
   flights (logging flight time on AFTO Form 781 is not authorized). Crewmembers and parachutists
84                                                           AFI11-401_AFRCSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2005


     cannot credit flights/jumps while on leave, permissive TDY, or nonflying/nonjumping TDY/Tempo-
     rary Assignment Duty (TAD), regardless of duration, or flying on an aircraft during point-to-point
     travel (not authorized or required to perform aircrew duties). Aircrew members cannot log flying time
     when the purpose for flying is to make a proficiency-sustaining jump.

3.4. Definition of Flight Time Categories. The references in this paragraph to aircraft also apply to syn-
thetic training devices categorized in AFPAM 36-2211, Management of Air Force Training Systems, as
operational flying trainers or weapon system trainers. Log flight time only on the AFTO Form 781,
Attachment 2, and AF Form 3520, ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Extract, Attachment 4, and
use only the approved Flight Authorization Duty Codes listed in Attachment 2, Table A2.3.
     3.4.1. Primary Flight Time. Time logged by a member occupying a designated duty station identi-
     fied in AFI 65-503, and actively performing the duty associated with their aircrew specialty. Only
     qualified aircrew members, aircrew members obtaining qualification in the aircraft can log primary
     time when performing in-flight duties. Non-rated aircrew members and operational support personnel
     who do not have an established crew duty station will only log primary time when actually performing
     their in-flight duty. For example: operating equipment or caring for medical evacuation patients.
        3.4.1.1. EXCEPTIONS:
            3.4.1.1.1. Pilots in inactive status who are authorized to fly under the provisions of paragraph
            2.16. and commanders and key supervisors under the provisions of paragraph 3.7.1. will log
            primary time only when actually controlling the aircraft.
            3.4.1.1.2. Pilots who maintain qualification in single-place aircraft when completing instru-
            ment training or the instrument flight check in similar dual-place aircraft.
            3.4.1.1.3. Graduates of a military test pilot school (Air Force Test Pilot School, Navy Test
            Pilot School, etc.) are considered qualified and may log primary flight time using FP, FN, or
            FW as the flight authorization duty code while actively flying qualitative or approved
            short-term aircraft tests or evaluations. This does not authorize Test Pilot School graduates to
            perform duties on other missions requiring qualified aircrew members at the controls of the
            aircraft (e.g. functional check flights).
            3.4.1.1.4. Pararescue aircrew members assigned to authorized flying billets, on active flying
            AOs and qualified in the MDS, who are required in addition to the normal aircrew comple-
            ment to perform in-flight duties for mass rescued aircrew member/personnel missions may log
            primary flight time when performing patient support duties on mass personnel recovery mis-
            sions. Primary time is only authorized during such time those in-flight duties are performed.
            During periods when the PJ is not performing in-flight duties associated with the rescued
            members, or is non-current for that MDS, only Other flight time will be logged.
        3.4.1.2. For pilots, primary time is time actively controlling the aircraft excluding hands-on-time
        flown while instructing and evaluating (log such time under instructor or evaluator). It is not pred-
        icated on which set of controls is being used (multi-place aircraft), or on the duty position indi-
        cated on the flight authorization. Pilots receiving instruction while controlling the aircraft will log
        primary time.
        3.4.1.3. Astronauts performing duties in the space shuttle may log primary time in accordance
        with the preceding paragraphs, for their rated specialty. Astronauts accomplishing space station
AFI11-401_AFRCSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2005                                                                            85


       duties may log time for the duration of space station activity (primary time). For space station
       duty, use Aircrew Position Identifier (Second Character) “A” from Attachment 2, Table A2.3.
       3.4.1.4. For other aircrew specialties, log primary flight time only when performing duties at a
       duty position established for that specialty. Where more than one station is established for the
       same specialty, one member at each such station may log primary time while actually performing
       the duties associated with that station (for example, multiple Air Surveillance Operator positions
       on a single aircraft). (MAJCOMs will specify which AFI 65-503, US Air Force Cost and Planning
       Factors, authorized crew duty station(s) flight test engineers may occupy during test functions.
       During periods when the flight test engineer is not actively performing his or her evaluation/test
       duties, other time will be logged.) Except under conditions in this paragraph, the total primary
       time for any specific aircrew specialty must not exceed the total flight time.
NOTE: Due to the broad nature of flight surgeon duties, each position which another aircrew member
occupies (as defined in AFPD 11-4, e.g., pilot, navigator, ABM, observer, or CEA personnel), may be
considered as a flight surgeon station/position (i.e., a KC-135 with a pilot, copilot, navigator, and boom
operator would be authorized four flight surgeons). If there are more flight surgeons onboard than aircrew
stations, the total primary time must be split between those flight surgeons onboard by logging primary
and other time. When the number of flight surgeons on board is less or equal to the number of occupied
aircrew stations, all flight surgeons are authorized to log primary time for the total mission.
       3.4.1.5. Aeromedical Evacuation Crewmembers (AECM) must fly one mission as a primary
       crewmember each quarter. As long as an AECM flies one mission as a primary crewmember in the
       previous quarter, qualified AECMs may log secondary time when performing simulated patient
       duties or Mission Clinical Coordinator duties during aeromedical readiness missions. During peri-
       ods when the AECM is non-current, only other flight time will be logged when performing simu-
       lated patient or Mission Clinical Coordinator duties.
       3.4.1.6. Nonrated aircrew members and flight surgeons on active flying AOs, who are qualified in
       specific aircraft, but tasked to perform in-flight aircrew duties for a real-world mission in an air-
       craft in which they are not current and qualified, are authorized to log aircrew certification code
       (first character of crew position) "F" and primary time for that mission. Verbal orders of the unit
       commander may authorize such duties; however, a letter from the unit commander with opera-
       tional control of the mission or the flying unit flight authorization authenticating official (See
       Attachment 6) must be provided to the member's servicing HARM office within three duty-days
       for filing in the member's FRF, validating the requirement IAW paragraph 3.3..
           3.4.1.6.1. The mission requirement letter (for real world missions) must include the statement,
           "The verbal orders of the commander on (date) are confirmed; circumstances prevented writ-
           ten orders in advance." Include a statement in the remarks section of the AFTO Form 781 val-
           idating the real-world mission tasking and verifying that the member completed emergency
           egress training for that aircraft prior to flight. This does not establish qualification for the air-
           craft unless all applicable qualification requirements have been accomplished as specified in
           applicable publications.
NOTE: For deployed operations every attempt should be made to submit the mission requirement letter
and AFTO Form 781 to the aircrew member’s servicing HARM office within seven duty-days.
   3.4.2. Secondary Flight Time : Flight time logged by a crew member who is performing inflight
   duties related to the crewmember’s specialty, but who is not controlling the function of that specialty.
86                                                            AFI11-401_AFRCSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2005


     Except as listed below, the total secondary time logged in each specialty may not exceed the total
     flight time. When in excess to the crew complement, a remark will be placed in the remarks of the
     AFTO Form 781 depicting the secondary duties performed by additional aircrew.
        3.4.2.1. The member must be maintaining or obtaining qualification in the aircraft to log second-
        ary time. EXCEPTION: Crewmembers designated in AFI 65-503; and tasked to perform their pri-
        mary duties on aircraft other than their assigned aircraft (e.g., Flight Attendants tasked by TACC
        or HHQ to support Silver Bullet or DV missions) will log secondary time as long as crewmembers
        maintain currency in their primary aircraft. The member’s aircrew certification code will reflect
        the current qualification. If not qualified in the aircraft, the member will log “X” or “O” as the first
        character of the flight authorization code IAW Attachment 2, Table A2.3.
        3.4.2.2. For pilots, log secondary time while occupying a duty position having a set of flight con-
        trols, yet not actively controlling the aircraft, instructing, or evaluating.
        3.4.2.3. For other aircrew specialties, log secondary time when actually performing inflight duties
        of the specialty, but not at the primary duty station established for that specialty (for example, sec-
        ond navigator during airdrop missions or additional PJs on AOs required to perform “in-flight
        duties” assisting mass aircrew/personnel on a rescue mission) when dictated by mission require-
        ments.
            3.4.2.3.1. Annotate specific inflight duties performed and circumstances that require addi-
            tional crewmembers (in additional to basic crew complement) to perform the mission in the
            remarks section of the AFTO Form 781.
        3.4.2.4. Except as provided for in AFI 65-503, the total secondary time logged in each specialty
        may not exceed the total flight time.
        3.4.2.5. Pararescue aircrew members assigned to authorized flying billets, on active flying AOs
        and qualified in the MDS, who are required in addition to the normal aircrew complement to per-
        form in-flight duties for mass rescued aircrew member/personnel missions may log secondary
        time when performing simulated patient duties or Mission Coordinator duties on mass personnel
        recovery training missions. Secondary time is only authorized during such time those in-flight
        duties are performed. During periods when the PJ is not performing “in-flight” duties associated
        with the rescued members or mission coordinator, or non-current for that MDS, only Other flight
        time will be logged.
     3.4.3. Instructor Flight Time. Flight time logged by a designated and qualified instructor while
     actively performing authorized instructional duties. (Includes "hands on" time during demonstration
     activities that are part of instructional duties.) The instructor does not have to be occupying a primary
     duty station established for that specialty but must be actually performing instructor duties. Except as
     provided for in AFI 65-503, the total instructor flight time for each aircrew specialty may not exceed
     the total flight time.
        3.4.3.1. Instructors may log instructor time while accomplishing unlike specialty training instruc-
        tion (e.g., an instructor navigator training pilots/boom operators for the three-person crew or third
        pilots in the navigator seat). Only the amount of time used to train a specific event may be logged
        as instructor time. If more than one instructor of like specialty are on the aircraft, to provide simul-
        taneous instruction of different specialties, both instructors may log instructor time (e.g., two
        instructor navigators are on the same aircraft, one is instructing a student navigator and the other
AFI11-401_AFRCSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2005                                                                         87


       is instructing a boom operator). In this case, total instructor time logged may exceed total flight
       time logged. A remark must be entered on the back of the AFTO Form 781 explaining rationale.
       3.4.3.2. Two instructors (to include FTU) of the same specialty may fly together and each log
       instructor time; however, total instructor time logged may not exceed total flight time logged.
       (e.g., A new FTU instructor is flying with a student crew and a more experienced FTU instructor
       flies with the new FTU instructor; instruction can occur between the new FTU instructor and stu-
       dent or between the experienced FTU instructor and new instructor, but not both simultaneously.
       Therefore, the total instructor time logged may not exceed total flight time).
       3.4.3.3. Qualified instructor pilots may log instructor time when participating in missions where
       AFI 11-202V1 senior officer qualification and performance requirements apply.
       3.4.3.4. Instructors will log primary, secondary, or other time, depending on their activity, when
       not performing instructor duties.
       3.4.3.5. Log simulator console time as instructor time if the crewmember is qualified as an
       instructor in the aircraft. When MAJCOMs authorize crewmembers to be instructors in the simu-
       lator only, they may log simulator console time as instructor time. MAJCOMs will determine
       which types of simulators qualify for this approval, e.g., operational flight trainers, weapon system
       trainers, etc. Otherwise, log console time as other time for those simulators which do not qualify.
   3.4.4. Evaluator Flight Time. Flight time flown by a designated and certified flight evaluator while
   actively performing authorized flight evaluation duties. (Includes "hands on" time if coincident with
   performance of flight evaluator duties.) The member does not have to be occupying a primary duty
   station established for that specialty, but must be actually performing evaluator duties. Evaluators will
   also log instructor, primary, secondary, or other time, depending on their activity, when not per-
   forming evaluator duties.
NOTE: Member must be current and certified in the aircraft to log evaluator time. When flight evaluators
conduct flight evaluations on aircraft they are not qualified, IAW AFI 11-202V2, then members must log
“O” or “X” as their first character per Table A2.3., Flight Authorization Duty Codes.
   3.4.5. Other Flight Time. Flight time flown by members who are on the flight authorization, but not
   occupying a designated duty station or conforming to the requirements of primary, secondary, instruc-
   tor, or evaluator time. For example: additional or extra crewmembers taking part in the flight, required
   for the mission to augment the crew or perform mission-related observation or evaluator duties (not
   qualified in the aircraft). Crewmembers will log other time during periods of crew rest or sleep.
   3.4.6. Combat and Combat Support Flight Time.
       3.4.6.1. Combat. Aerial activity, engagements, or attacks conducted by aircraft against an enemy
       of the US or an opposing foreign force when there is risk of exposure to hostile fire. Aerial activity
       in support of forces engaged in combat when there is risk of exposure to hostile fire.
           3.4.6.1.1. Once a combat zone is established, the Commander Air Force Forces (COMAF-
           FOR) will identify which portion constitutes hostile airspace, based on risk of exposure to hos-
           tile fire. To prevent an interruption in accurate aircrew documentation the COMAFFOR must
           do this as soon as possible. For the purposes of logging combat time the aerial activity must be
           accomplished in a designated combat zone within hostile airspace as defined by the COMAF-
           FOR. (EXCEPTION: In cases of aircrews that employ standoff weapons, the COMAFFOR
           under extraordinary circumstances can make an exception to allow aircrews to log combat
88                                                           AFI11-401_AFRCSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2005


            time.) COMAFFOR will publish guidelines specifying which aircraft missions may log com-
            bat/combat support flight time as well as identify the inclusive dates that the hostile airspace is
            activated for logging time. During contingencies where a combat zone is not designated but
            the use of force is authorized, COMAFFOR will coordinate with HQ USAF/XO to establish
            hostile airspace criteria and guidelines for logging combat/combat support flight time. NOTE:
            COMAFFOR must issue new guidance and procedures every two years to ensure all Air Force
            units are aware of the current policy.
        3.4.6.2. Combat Support. Aerial activity, engagements, or attacks conducted by aircraft against an
        enemy of the US or an opposing foreign force that operate outside the designated hostile airspace.
        Aerial activity directly supporting forces engaged in combat or directly supporting those who are
        actively supporting combat when the aerial activity occurs outside the designated hostile airspace.
        Hostile airspace is determined as described above under combat time.
            3.4.6.2.1. Combat or combat support time will be logged from takeoff to landing when an
            individual meets the requirements of combat/combat support flight time, is on an active AO, is
            on the flight authorization authorized to perform in-flight aircrew duties, and is required for
            the mission IAW paragraph 3.3. of this instruction. Do not combine mission symbols; use one
            symbol for the entire flight.

3.5. Flight Condition Time. The categories listed in paragraph 3.4. are the basis for accumulating flying
experience for all flying personnel. Record all flying time accrued on a mission in the appropriate cate-
gory. Provisions have been made to record, for historical purposes, a breakout of flight time by flight con-
dition: night, instrument, and simulated instrument. Primary time flown in more than one condition
simultaneously (for example, night and instrument) would result in entries under both of these categories
on the form. The type of time logged must be consistent with the flight condition actually encountered or
procedure accomplished. MAJCOMs may further restrict logging combinations that are inconsistent with
command policy or procedures. Use the following rules in logging flight condition time:
NOTE: DELETED.
     3.5.1. Night Time. That portion of primary, secondary, instructor, or evaluator flight time logged
     between the end of evening civil twilight and the beginning of morning civil twilight, as published in
     the American Air Almanac. Crewmembers having night requirements (includes wear of NVG) speci-
     fied by Air Force or MAJCOM publications will log this time. For personnel assigned at latitudes
     above 60 degrees north (May through August) or below 60 degrees south (November through Febru-
     ary), night requirements are waived when removal from active flying or PCS occurs during the sum-
     mer months.
     3.5.2. Primary Instrument Time. The portion of primary, instructor, or evaluator flight time logged
     when external conditions require that the aircraft attitude be maintained primarily by reference to the
     flight instruments. Pilots only will log this time when performing duties in this flight condition.
NOTE: To log primary instrument time, an instructor or evaluator pilot must occupy a duty station with
a set of flight controls, but does not have to actively (hands-on) control the aircraft.
     3.5.3. Primary Simulated Instrument Time. The portion of primary, "hands-on" instructor, or
     "hands-on" evaluator time logged by an individual controlling the aircraft attitude primarily by refer-
     ence to the flight instruments. Pilots only will log this time when performing duties in this flight con-
     dition.
AFI11-401_AFRCSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2005                                                                         89


   3.5.4. Night Vision Goggle Time. The portion of flight time logged by an aircrew member wearing
   night vision goggles between the end of evening civil twilight and the beginning of morning civil twi-
   light, as published in the American Air Almanac. Crewmembers performing aircrew duties in a crew
   position with NVG requirements will log this time while wearing NVGs. NVG time may also be
   logged by flight surgeons and aircrew members instructing or evaluating individuals who are perform-
   ing crew duties where NVGs are required and worn. NVG time will not exceed total night time
   logged.

3.6. Non-rated Flight Time. Non-rated aircrew members must log flying time, using the proper flight
authorization duty code. Log time only when authorized on AOs and when actively performing specific
inflight duties as designated by flight authorization orders (paragraph 3.9.). Aeromedical evacuation
crewmembers log time only when listed on the flight authorization and actively engaged in operational air
evacuation or air rescue missions; aeromedical research and development inflight; or air evacuation train-
ing missions that require AECMs in a crew position, being instructed, or being evaluated or as listed in
paragraph 3.4.1.4. above.

Section 3C—Logging of Flight Activity (General)

3.7. Logging Flight Time for Pay. Credit only flight time logged according to paragraph 3.3. toward
incentive pay requirements (NOTE: See Attachment 2, Table A2.3.). (EXCEPTION: Air Technicians
[AT] and Air Reserve Technicians [ART] must be in military status to log time for incentive pay. This Air
Force Instruction and MAJCOMs define the inflight duties, which qualify individuals for ACIP, CEFIP, or
HDIP.)
   3.7.1. Logging Flight Time by Rated Officers Who are Qualified in One Aircraft and Not Other
   Types of Aircraft Assigned to Their Units. Commanders (including unit commanders) and key
   supervisors (API 6 and API 8) who are qualified and maintain currency in one type aircraft, but have
   other types assigned to their units, may be authorized to fly in a primary crew position in assigned air-
   craft in which they are not qualified. Individuals will be under the supervision of an instructor for the
   applicable crew position. The crewmember will log an “O” or “X” as per Table A2.3.. Flight time
   flown in “O” or “X” status does not entitle the member to OFDA credit, ACIP or HDIP.
   3.7.2. (Added-AFRC) Logging, posting and crediting of flight duty time entries on AFTO Form
   781s are authorized only for personnel designated on the flight authorization. Commanders ensure
   that only those members authorized to perform aircrew or non-crew duties according to the provisions
   of the basic instruction are designated on the flight authorization. Aircrews log flying time in the
   same duty (pay) status as that indicated by the flight authorization published for a particular flight or
   series of flights.

3.8. Logging Flight Time by Rated Officers and Career Enlisted Aviators in Inactive Flying Status.
Personnel in such status do not log flying time in their specialty in US Government aircraft except as pro-
vided in FAC waivers listed in Table 2.2., paragraphs 2.8.2.2., 2.10.2. and 2.16. In all such cases, inactive
crewmembers must maintain physical and physiological qualification for aviation service.

3.9. Non-rated Crewmembers and Operational Support Flight Time. The inflight duties as autho-
rized by and MAJCOM and Air Force instructions determine the proper flying duty or position symbol for
90                                                         AFI11-401_AFRCSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2005


logging flight time on AFTO Form 781. This flying time is accomplished by officers and enlisted mem-
bers when actively performing inflight duties as follows:
     3.9.1. Non-rated Crewmember Duty. When on AOs and properly assigned to an authorized
     non-rated aircrew position as part of the regularly constituted crew IAW AFIs 11-401, 11-402, and
     65-503.
        3.9.1.1. The principal duties require an individual to perform inflight on a frequent and regular
        basis.
        3.9.1.2. The approved duties are essential to operating the aircraft systems and associated equip-
        ment used for completing a mission successfully.
     3.9.2. Operational Support (Noncrew Member) Duty. These members are placed on orders for a
     specified time and must be properly authorized to perform inflight duties not prescribed in AFI 65-503
     and to supplement a regularly constituted aircrew. They are occasionally on flight status for limited
     periods to perform essential and specific in-flight duties. Refer to AFI 11-402 for guidance.
     3.9.2. (AFRC) Operational Support (Noncrew Member) Duty. Personnel performing operational
     support (non-crew member) duties will log "FZ" as the flying duty/crew position symbol.

3.10. Flying in Other Than Military Aircraft. Flight time logged according to paragraph 3.3. in other
than military aircraft is credited toward annual flying requirements only when directed by competent Air
Force AOs and such flying is inherent in the primary duty assignment of the person concerned. Aircrews
must document flight time on an AFTO Form 781 or AF Form 3250 and, except for CAP-USAF or Intro-
ductory Flying Training missions, be in aircraft with 450 or more horsepower.

3.11. Responsibility of Pilot in Command. Enter and credit flight time on an individual's flight record
only when flown according to this instruction and properly logged on AFTO Form 781 or AF Form 3250.
The pilot designated, as "in command" of the aircraft is responsible for making sure the appropriate form
is dated and properly completed. These forms provide an accurate record of pertinent flight data for per-
sonnel authorized to take part in the flight and to receive ACIP, CEFIP, or HDIP.

3.12. Logging Flight Time in Non-US Air Force Aircraft. Only members performing inflight duties
authorized by paragraph 1.11. may log flying time in non-Air Force aircraft for credit towards OFDA
requirements or incentive pay. Otherwise only other flight time can be credited in an individual's flight
records.

3.13. Logging Civilian Flight Time. Total career flight time acquired in civilian aircraft of over 450
rated horsepower, when verified by logbook or other official record certified by authorized persons.
(These authorized persons are operations officers of military aviation activities; suitable agents of com-
mercial aviation companies; operating managers of fields from which the reported flying was performed,
if in privately owned aircraft; and officials of recognized civil flight schools.) This time will be entered
into ARMS in the civilian hour block.

3.14. Logging Student Time. Total career flight time acquired by rated trainees in USAF undergraduate
flight training prior to attaining a rating. This time will be entered into ARMS in the student time hour
block.
AFI11-401_AFRCSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2005                                                                      91


3.15. Logging Other US Military Time. Total career flight time obtained in the service of other US mil-
itary agencies when not officially directed by the Air Force, and when verified by logbook or other offi-
cial records certified by authorized persons. This time will be entered into ARMS in the Other US
Military hour block. Time obtained in other US military aircraft is not included in this category if per-
formed in an official capacity (e.g., directed by competent Air Force order); such time is recorded as Air
Force rated time.

3.16. Logging Foreign Military Time. Total career flight time obtained in the service of other govern-
ments when not officially directed by the Air Force, and when verified by logbook or other official record
certified by authorized persons. This time will be entered into ARMS in the Foreign Military hour block.

3.17. Quarterly General Officer Flying Hour Information Report. MAJCOMs will submit Quarterly
GO Flying Hour Information Report (RCS: HAF-XOO(Q)9724) via message to HQ USAF/XO, with HQ
USAF/XOO/XOOT as message info addresses, by the 15th of the month following each calendar quarter.

Terms
Additional Crewmember (ACM)—Aircrew members not required for a particular mission being flown,
but who are required for follow-on missions. ACMs are further defined by MAJCOMs in MAJCOM
supplements to this instruction. The OG/CC (or equivalent) with operational control of the mission being
flown grants ACM status. ACMs are passengers and may only fly on aircraft capable of carrying
passengers IAW the provisions of DoD 4515.13-R.
Aircrew—The total complement of rated (pilots, navigators, air battle managers, and flight surgeons),
career enlisted aviators (1AXXX Air Force Specialty Codes), and nonrated aircrew (K-, Q-, or X-prefixed
Air Force Specialty Code) personnel responsible for the safe ground and flight operation of the aircraft
and onboard systems, or for airborne duties essential to accomplishment of the aircraft’s mission. Includes
members in initial formal training for immediate assignment to an authorized operational flying position.
Individuals must be on aeronautical orders and assigned to an authorized position according to AFI
65-503, US Air Force Cost and Planning Factors, or nonrated aircrew not in an aircraft’s basic crew
complement, but required for the mission. Aircrew members perform their principal duties inflight and
their presence is required for the aircraft to accomplish its primary tasked mission. Duties must be
essential to operating the aircraft or mission systems and equipment used for completing a mission, or
other duties essential to the aircraft’s mission.
NOTE: US Air Force Academy (USAFA)/Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (AFROTC)
cadets enrolled in approved USAFA flying programs are accorded aircrew status while actively partici-
pating in such programs. Cadets will be placed on aeronautical orders authorizing USAFA Airmanship
Program flying status and will not be added in the operational ARMS database. An Aviation Service
Code (ASC) will not be assigned and an Aviation Service Date (ASD) will not be established. Neither
flying incentive pay nor flying duty credit are authorized.
Air Force Aircraft—US Government aircraft under US Air Force jurisdiction.
Authentication—The process that makes an administrative order official. Evidenced by proper signature
or seal that a document is genuine and official. The only seal authorized on AOs is on Department of the
Air Force (DAF) orders (For example: A DAF order that the CSAF awarded a pilot rating).
Authorized Aircrews—Aircrews authorized according to AFI 65-503, USAF Cost and Planning
Factors, Attachment A36-1 (Authorized Aircrew Composition Active Forces), Attachment A37-1
(Authorized Aircrew Composition Reserve Forces), and Attachment A38-1, (Authorized Aircrew
Composition Guard Forces).
Aviation Career Incentive Pay (ACIP)—Incentive pay for rated officers in an aviation career as
authorized in the Aviation Career Incentive Act of 1974, the Aviation Career Improvement Act of 1989,
and the FY 96 National Defense Authorization Act.
98                                                           AFI11-401_AFRCSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2005


Aviation Service Date (ASD)—Effective date of the first aeronautical order to perform flight duties. For
rated officers, this date is set when the member first reports to the aviation activity that has aircraft in
which he or she will receive flight training leading to an aeronautical rating and is placed on aeronautical
orders (for example, class start date of SUPT, SUNT, or UPT-H class or Weapons Systems Training) or
date of commission, whichever is later. For flight surgeons, the ASD equals the date all requirements for
the flight surgeon rating were met, which is normally the date Course 50BY9351 or equivalent was
completed. (EXCEPTION: The ASD for medical students who have completed Course 50BY9351 will
be the date post graduate medical training is completed, an unrestricted medical license is attained, AFSC
48XX is awarded, and flight surgeon rating is assigned. All requirements must be accomplished for award
of the ASD.) For Air Battle Managers, the ASD is the date the crewmember enters formal ABM flying
training (class start date). For career enlisted aviators, the ASD is set when the member first reports to the
aviation activity that has aircraft in which he or she will receive flight training leading to career enlisted
aviator status and is placed on aeronautical orders. Rated ASDs and CEA ASDs are established
separately. See also AFI 11-402.
Career Enlisted Aviator (CEA)—Personnel in AFSCs 1AXXX and 8A000.
Career Enlisted Flier Incentive Pay (CEFIP)—Incentive pay for career enlisted aviators in an aviation
career as authorized in the FY 00 NDAA.
Civil Air Patrol - United States Air Force (CAP-USAF)—CAP-USAF is the Air Force agency that
coordinates or approves use of the Civil Air Patrol to carry out non-combat missions of the Air Force
(IAW AFI 10-2701).
Commander—When used in this instruction, "commander" refers to a wing commander (or comparable
level), or any level higher within the chain of command, of a flying unit to which an individual is assigned
or attached for flying. If an individual is geographically separated from the wing, authority may be
delegated to a group or squadron level.
Conditional Entitlement—The requirement for any aircrew member in an aviation status or career to
meet monthly flight requirements to receive ACIP, CEFIP, and HDIP.
Continuation Training—The continuation training program provides crew members with the volume,
frequency, and mix of training (flying and ground training) necessary to maintain proficiency in the
assigned qualification level. This training must be maintained in the ARMS database.
Continuous Entitlement—The condition under which rated officers and career enlisted aviators in an
aviation career are entitled to receive ACIP or CEFIP without regard to flight activity.
Flight—For the purpose of this instruction only, a flight is synonymous with a mission.
Flight Authorization (FA)—A single document used to identify all aircrew, operational support, and
authorized non-interference members on AOs, who are qualified and authorized to perform duties on
specific aircraft for a scheduled mission. ACMs and MEGPs may be placed on the flight authorization,
only in the Remarks section. AE/PJ FAs are attached to the aircraft FA for the mission(s) on which they
performed duties.
Frequent and Regular—"Frequent and regular" is a DoD 7000.14-R, Volume 7A, Part Two, term which
establishes the minimum monthly flight requirements to be entitled to conditional Aviation Career
Incentive Pay (ACIP), Career Enlisted Flight Incentive Pay (CEFIP), or Hazardous Duty Incentive Pay
(HDIP). DoD 7000.14-R, Volume 7A, Part Two, sets the minimum at four hours for active duty
(DoDFMR, Part Two) and two hours for Air Reserve Components (ARC) per calendar month, or a
AFI11-401_AFRCSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2005                                                                         99


prorated share for lesser periods. By itself, the requirement to fly frequently and regularly is not
justification to assign an individual to aircrew or operational support flier status. There must be a need to
perform inflight duties.
Gate—Identifies a point in a rated officer’s or CEA’s aviation career at which utilization is measured
according to the Aviation Career Incentive Act of 1974, the Aviation Career Improvement Act of 1989,
the FY 96 National Defense Authorization Act, or the FY 00 National Defense Authorization Act.
Utilization is measured at the 12th and 18th year of aviation service for rated officers, and 10th, 15th, and
20th years of aviation service for CEAs. A transition period was in effect for rated officers until 1 October
2003.
Government Aircraft—An aircraft owned, operated, or leased by the US Government.
Hazardous Duty Incentive Pay (HDIP)—Incentive pay authorized for personnel required to perform
flight duties on a frequent and regular basis.
Host Aviation Resource Management Office—The office responsible for ARMS, flight record, and
jump record management. The HARM office determines entitlement to ACIP, CEFIP, and HDIP.
Host Aviation Resource Manager—The sole approval authority (except for HQ USAF/XOOT) at each
flying base for determining entitlement and the starting and stopping of Aviation Career Incentive Pay
(ACIP), Career Enlisted Flier Incentive Pay (CEFIP), and Hazardous Duty Incentive Pay (HDIP) for
flying and parachute duties; responsible for interpreting public law as it pertains to entitlement to these
incentive pays along with auditing and reconciliation of these incentive pays; and the single point of
contact for ARMS. These positions are inherently governmental.
Instrument Flight—Flight conducted when external conditions require that the aircraft attitude be
maintained primarily by reference to the flight instruments.
Intent—For the purpose of publishing an Aeronautical Order, the intent of an AO validates individual
qualification for aviation and parachutist service, authorizes and directs frequent and regular participation
in aerial flight or parachute duties; and establishes or terminates individual entitlement to ACIP, CEFIP,
and HDIP. Intent also includes the effective date of the AO.
Interfly—The exchange and/or substitution of aircrews and aircraft between MAJCOMs.
Mission—For the purpose of this instruction only, mission is defined as a primary objective for which an
aircraft is operated (see Mission Symbols) and which may consist of an increment of one or more sorties.
Several missions may be accomplished in one sortie.
Mission Essential Ground Personnel (MEGP)—Military members not authorized AOs who are tasked
to perform unique ground support duties directly related and essential to the particular aircraft or mission
being flown, e.g., a maintenance specialist required to perform routine maintenance or a security team
required to guard the aircraft at enroute or destination stops. MEGPs are further defined by MAJCOMs in
MAJCOM supplements to this instruction. The OG/CC (or equivalent) with operational control of the
mission being flown grants MEGP status. MEGPs are passengers and may only fly on aircraft capable of
carrying passengers IAW the provisions of DoD 4515.13-R.
Officer Service Date (OSD)—Effective date of service as a commissioned, warrant, or flight officer,
whether or not served on extended active duty. This is usually equivalent to total federal commissioned
service date backdated by any period served as a warrant or flight officer. For flight surgeons, the OSD
100                                                          AFI11-401_AFRCSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2005


includes constructive service granted medical officers in the computation of creditable service for basic
pay.
Operational Flying—Flying performed under competent orders by rated and CEA personnel (primarily
for mission, support, or training purposes) while serving in an assignment where basic flying skills
usually are maintained for performing assigned duties.
Operational Support Flier—An individual whose primary, full-time duty does not require flying. The
Air Force may require these individuals to fly on an occasional basis to perform a specific, essential
inflight duty that cannot be performed by an assigned aircrew member. Duties may include, but are not
limited to inflight test, operation, or inflight maintenance of specific aircraft systems or installed
equipment. Operational support fliers must be placed on aeronautical orders and complete prescribed
flying hour requirements in order for them to receive non-crew hazardous duty pay. Authorized
man-months are required prior to issuance of aeronautical orders.
Orientation Flight—Continuous flights in DoD-owned aircraft performed within the local flying area
and terminating at the point of origin.
Point-to-Point—Public Affairs travel. Point-to-point means flights that takeoff from one location and
land at a different location. Such flights require MAJCOM/CC or SECAF approval as specified in Table
1.1. of this instruction. Point-to-point orientation flights are not authorized.
Sortie—An AFTO Form 781 aircraft sortie begins when the aircraft begins to move forward on takeoff or
takes off vertically from rest at any point of support. It ends after airborne flight when the aircraft returns
to the surface and either of the following conditions occur: a) the engines are stopped, or the aircraft is on
the surface for five minutes, whichever occurs first; or, b) a change is made in the crew which enplanes or
deplanes a crewmember. For logging aircrew proficiency training, on missions where some crewmembers
deplane and the remaining crew from the original takeoff re-launch, this may be considered to be a
continuation of the original aircrew sortie. MAJCOMs may establish MDS-specific crew requirements
and procedures for aircrew continuation sorties.
STANAG 3526 AMD—Interchangeability of NATO Aircrew Medical Categories.
Supervisory Aircrew or Staff Member—Personnel in supervisory or staff positions (API 6, 8, B, and
D) who actively fly; or in positions (API 3, 4, C, and E) that require aircrew expertise but individuals are
not required to fly.
Training Level—Assigned to individuals based on the continuation training aircrew status (basic aircraft
qualification, basic mission capable, or mission ready/combat mission ready) they are required to
maintain.
Training Period—Any training period determined by the MAJCOM or Wing in which training
requirements are performed.
Unit Commander—When used in this instruction, "unit commander" refers to the squadron commander

INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING AFTO FORM 781, ARMS AIRCREW/MISSION FLIGHT DATA
                              DOCUMENT

A2.1. Purpose. The AFTO Form 781-series provides maintenance, inspection, service configuration,
and flight operations records for weapon or support systems. AFTO Form 781 is the source document for
recording and reporting operational flight or training device information for each individual authorized to
take part in a mission. This form is the primary record of both personnel and aerospace vehicle flying
hours. It is the official record to validate flight pay eligibility for rated, CEA, and other non-rated officer
and enlisted members required to fly. The original AFTO Form 781, ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight
Data Document, must be maintained in the HARM office that services the unit to which the aircraft is
assigned.

A2.2. Scope. These instructions apply to all rated, CEA, and other non-rated officer and enlisted mem-
bers authorized to log flight or training device time in an airborne duty or position for the purpose of
maintaining an official Air Force Individual Flight Record.

A2.3. Responsibilities. The AFTO Form 781 is established by TO 00-20-1. Maintenance personnel are
responsible for distributing and collecting these forms. Completing AFTO Form 781 and other forms in
that series is a joint responsibility of maintenance personnel and the pilot in command.
      A2.3.1. The crew chief or alternate ensures a sufficient number of copies of AFTO Form 781 are
      onboard the aircraft and completes items 2 through 5 on a sufficient number of copies to fulfill mis-
      sion requirements.
      A2.3.2. The pilot in command ensures the AFTO Form 781 is dated and properly completed to show
      all pertinent flight data and the flight time for all personnel who are authorized to take part in the
      flight. The pilot in command:
         A2.3.2.1. Before flight, reviews the aircraft status as indicated on AFTO Forms in the 781-series
         and then signs the exceptional release, if not previously signed by maintenance.
         A2.3.2.2. Documents all discrepancies observed before, during, and after flight on AFTO Form
         781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document.
         A2.3.2.3. After the flight is completed, fills in the required entries in item 10, Flight Condition
         Data (AFTO Form 781H, Aerospace Vehicle Flight Status and Maintenance Document) and
         initials item 38 of AFTO Form 781.
      A2.3.3. The completed AFTO Form 781 must be removed from the AFTO Form 781 binder after the
      information is entered at the maintenance debriefing and the form hand-carried to either the SARM or
      maintenance plans and scheduling office (MAJCOM option) and after ARMS update is hand-carried
      to the HARM.
      A2.3.3. (AFRC) Upon completion of maintenance review at debrief, hand-carry the AFTO Form 781
      to the SARM office. After audit procedures are performed, the 1C0X2 performing the audit proce-
      dures initials item 39 of the form and notifies maintenance plans and scheduling/debrief offices of any
      discrepancies. The REMIS/G081/CAMS computer database will be audited by both maintenance and
AFI11-401_AFRCSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2005                                                                    103


  operations personnel using the daily and monthly aircraft utilization reports (AUR). All aircraft time,
  landing and sortie discrepancies will be resolved in a timely manner.
  A2.3.4. Each unit operations officer:
     A2.3.4.1. Gives to the maintenance organization that services the aircraft assigned to that unit the
     necessary organization and location information to be entered in items 4 and 5 of AFTO Form
     781. This ensures completed forms are sent to the proper SARM or HARM for entry into ARMS.
     A2.3.4.2. Ensures a responsible individual audits the unit's AFTO Forms 781 for accuracy and
     legibility and initials in item 39 of the form in the before sending it to the HARM. Where local
     procedures establish the HARM as the auditing agency, the responsible individual from that office
     initials the form in item 39.
     A2.3.4.2. (AFRC) Ensures unit assigned 1C0X2 or civilian equivalent always audits and initials
     item 39 of the AFTO Form 781. Where local procedures establish the HARM as the auditing
     agency, the HARM personnel entering the AFTO Form 781 into ARMS will also initial item 39
     next to the unit initials (Unit Init/HARM Init) to confirm completion of audit. Audits will confirm
     information on flight authorizations and AFTO Forms 781 match.
         A2.3.4.2.1. (Added-AFRC) Unit assigned 1C0X2 or civilian equivalent will enter AFTO
         Form 781 data in the ARMS database unless a support agreement states the active duty HARM
         must enter the AFTO Forms 781 data in ARMS. If the HARM is to enter data into the ARMS
         database all AFTO Forms 781 must be audited by unit assigned 1C0X2 or civilian equivalent
         and a copy maintained at the unit level for subsequent auditing.
     A2.3.4.3. The original copy of the AFTO Form 781 must be provided to the HARM that services
     the unit to which the aircraft is assigned no later than 5 days after the end of the month in which
     the flights were performed. For example, the Form 781 for a flight flown in March must be turned
     in to the servicing HARM NLT 5 April.
     EXCEPTION: ARC units that track/maintain ACIP and CEFIP for their aircrew members may
     forward the AFTO Forms 781 to the servicing HARM not later than the first day following two
     months after the month in which the flight was performed. In the above example, the forms would
     not be required to be turned into the HARM until 1 June.
     A2.3.4.3. (AFRC) An unofficial copy should be maintained at the unit level for auditing valida-
     tions, verifying AFTPs and updating flying hours.
         A2.3.4.3.1. To prevent changes being made to an individual’s flight record in ARMS after the
         original was updated and sent to the HARM office, SARMs are not authorized to maintain
         duplicate copies of AFTO Forms 781 (including extracts). If changes are required after the
         flight information has been entered in ARMS and the form is at the HARM, the pilot in com-
         mand must contact the HARM office to make corrections.

           office that processes and files the original forms.
      5    The base of the unit of aircraft assignment.
AFTO FORM 781 ENTRIES (CERTIFIED BY THE PILOT IN COMMAND)
      1    Date. Use numerical digits for year, month, and day. The date must be the Greenwich Mean
           Time (GMT) date. Example- 20050325
      6    Mission number assigned for this leg of the mission (MAJCOM option).
      7    Authorized mission symbol for each flight. Aircrew may enter all flights on the same GMT
           date on a single AFTO Form 781.
      8    International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) code for the base or airport where the
           aircraft takes off. If a flight is continued from a previous entry, enter "INFL."
      9    Base ICAO code for the base or airport where the aircraft lands. If a flight is terminated
           without landing for a change in mission symbol, enter "INFL."
      10   24-hour GMT clock time. The takeoff time is when the aircraft begins to move forward on
           takeoff roll.
      11   24-hour GMT clock time. The landing is when the aircraft is on the ground after being
           airborne and any of the following conditions occur: (a) The engines are stopped and
           shutdown occurs at or before five minutes after touchdown. (b) The aircraft has been on the
           ground for five minutes after touchdown; however, a series of practice landings is
           considered one flight. (c) A change is made in the crew where a crewmember enplanes or
           deplanes.

           NOTE: When a flight starts before 2400 GMT and ends after GMT midnight (2400Z),
           record and report the flight on the date of takeoff. A separate AFTO Form 781 is not
           necessary.
      12   Subtract takeoff time from landing time, convert to hours and tenths, and enter the result.
           The conversion table for minutes to tenths of an hour is on the reverse of the form.
      13   Number of touch-and-go, full stop, and total landings.
      14   Number of sorties accomplished. A sortie covers a flight from first take off to landing as
           described in block 11; however, if any flight entry is split (INFL), the sortie will be recorded
           on the flight that lists final landing.
      15   Specified by MAJCOM.
AFI11-401_AFRCSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2005                                                                    105


ITEM       ENTER
   16      Unit designated to perform this mission (MAJCOM option).
TOTALS Total flight time, landings, and sorties at the end of the mission or day.
   17      Four-digit unit number to which the crewmember is assigned/attached for flying. Use
           leading zeros when the unit number has fewer than four digits.
   18      SSN of the crewmember. An error in this entry will result in time being lost or credited to
           another crewmember.
   19      Crewmember’s last name (printed).
   20      Flight Authorization (FA) Duty Code assigned on the FA to the crewmember for this
           mission. This code cannot be higher than the individual’s current qualification, but will
           indicate duties that the individual crewmember is scheduled to perform on the mission. For
           example, if the individual is an IP, but is scheduled to perform MP duties on a mission, the
           individual will be listed as an MP on the Flight Authorization. Refer to Table A2.3. for a
           complete list of duty codes. NOTE: The only time the FA code will not match the
           scheduled duties on the FA is for extenuating circumstances. The AC must document the
           reason in the remarks of the AFTO Form 781. For example, a pilot was scheduled to
           perform IP duties in conjunction with upgrade training for a second pilot; however, the
           upgrading individual was DNIF and did not fly, so the pilot only performed primary duties.
           MP is logged with primary time and the AC documents the reason in the remarks section.
           When using the FA more than one day, log FA Duty Code actually performed and annotate
           in remarks if different from the FA.
  21-26    Times in hours and tenths for each category as defined in Chapter 3 of this instruction. The
           total time in item 26 cannot exceed the grand total in item 12 column and total of items 21
           through 25 cannot exceed item 26.
   27      Total number of sorties for this crewmember. Entry is normally the grand total (see item 14,
           above).
  28-30    Hours and tenths of time performed in night, instrument, or simulated conditions, as defined
           in Chapter 3 of this instruction.
   31      Hours and tenths of time performed while wearing night vision goggles.
   32      Air Reserve Component Flight Duty Status Code for the crewmember, if applicable. If used:
           1=Active Duty, 2=Unit Training Assembly (Inactive Duty), 3=Flying Training Period
           (Inactive Period), 4=Civilian Technician, and 33=Inactive Duty.
   33      Log Combat Time in hours/tenths for each category as defined in Chapter 3 of this
           instruction.
   34      Number of Combat Sorties flown that meet requirements as defined in this instruction,
           Chapter 3.
   35      Log Combat Support Time in hours and tenths for each category as defined in Chapter 3 of
           this instruction.

         A2.3.4.4. (Added-AFRC) Provides the mission symbol for each flight . The mission symbol is a
         four-position alphanumeric code. The first two characters are as shown in Table A2.2. Mission
         symbols vary by aircraft type and unit. Operations identify the primary mission symbol on flight
         orders and/or mission directives. NOTE: AFRC units must use approved mission symbols listed
         on HQ AFRC/DOT web site under the subtitle, Flying Hours (https://wwwmil.afrc.af.mil/hq/do/
         doo/doom/default). The primary mission for reserve operational aircraft is training which nor-
         mally use a “T” coded mission symbol when flying on an AFRC mission identifier. When sup-
         porting an AMC transportation working capital fund mission, a “M” coded mission symbol with,
         an AMC mission identifier must be used. When AFRC “CA” coded aircraft support an AMC con-
         tingency or exercise a “C” or “L” code will be used as appropriate.

A2.4. Extract AFTO Form 781. Each individual on the form whose flight records are maintained by
another HARM prepares a data extract copy of the original AFTO Form 781 to be sent, usually within five
duty-days, to that member’s HARM. If more than one individual named on the form is serviced by the
HARM, a single data extract copy may be used. For example Captain Grengs, a pilot from Minot AFB,
flew a mission at Grand Forks AFB. A copy of the AFTO Form 781 is made, certified, and sent to the
HARM office at Grand Forks. Extracts at the same base for aircrew members serviced by the same
HARM are not authorized.
A2.4. (AFRC) Extract AFTO Form 781. Aircrew members assigned to AFRC deliver extract AFTO
Forms 781 to their unit of assignment. Improperly completed AFTO Forms 781 are returned to the indi-
vidual for corrections prior to ARMS update.
      A2.4.1. Individuals whose flight records have been closed out, to transfer custody must prepare a data
      extract form for each authorized flight during that period.
      A2.4.1. (AFRC) Aircrew members requiring an AFTO Form 781 extract will make an exact copy of
      the original and return it to home station.
      A2.4.2. The data extract AFTO Form 781 is an exact copy of the original AFTO Form 781.
      A2.4.3. Upon receipt of an extract, member's servicing HARM office personnel will lightly line
      through individual mission data lines of members not in the local ARMS database, leaving only the
      members they will enter in ARMS. The HARM office responsible for management of the original
      AFTO form 781 will have a line lightly drawn through members who were extracted (not from air-
      craft's home station).
      A2.4.4. The data extract form is so identified and certified, either by a commissioned officer (prefer-
      ably the pilot in command), or by the HARM Chief/Superintendent.
      A2.4.5. See Attachment 4 for an extract authorized for non-operational, long TDYs.

A2.5. Privacy Act Advisement for AFTO Form 781. Personnel who furnish personal information for
completing the AFTO Form 781 are advised to read the Privacy Act Statement on the back of the form.

A2.6. AFTO Forms 781 Series. The AFTO Form 781 is used to record operational flight data. Other
forms in the series, important to the pilot in command, give detailed information that concerns the status,
servicing, and configurations of the aircraft, or list symbols required to properly complete other forms in
the series. Although explained in detailed in TO 00-20-1, these forms are briefly reviewed to assist air-
crew personnel.
AFI11-401_AFRCSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2005                                                                       111


  A2.6.1. AFTO Form 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document. Used to document
  each discrepancy discovered by the pilot, other crewmembers, or maintenance personnel. It must be
  checked by the pilot before flight to provide a general status review of the aircraft. Use this form to
  enter any discrepancies discovered and not previously reported.
  A2.6.2. AFTO Form 781F, Aerospace Vehicle Flight Report and Maintenance Document. The
  cover sheet for AFTO Form 781-series folder or binder in each aircraft. The face gives information
  that concerns the vehicle including MDS, serial number, organization and location, station code, ser-
  vicing, and inventory data. The reverse of the form has valid airborne duty and position codes autho-
  rized by this instruction.
  A2.6.3. AFTO Form 781G, General Mission Classification-Mission Symbols. Lists the valid US
  Air Force mission symbols specified in Table A2.2.
  A2.6.4. AFTO Form 781H, Aerospace Vehicle Flight Status and Maintenance Document. Used
  for transcribing operational flight data needed by maintenance. Maintenance status and servicing
  information are documented to provide operating personnel with a ready reference as to the status of
  the aircraft or air launched missile. It shows the status and history of inspections related to the daily
  flight activity of the day involved. It is used by the pilot to document aerospace vehicle time, full stop
  and total landings, cartridge starts, and engine cycles for each flight. It is also used by the pilot to
  report functional check flights and to record flight condition data. The pilot in command must make
  sure the date entered in parts of AFTO Form 781H that apply to each flight agree with AFTO Form
  781 data for the corresponding flight line entry.
  A2.6.5. AFTO Form 781M, Status Symbols and Functional System Codes. Contains the system
  numbers, general grouping, and system title codes used by maintenance and aircrews that are required
  to complete other forms in the AFTO Form 781-series.

OPERATIONS NOTES:
1. For the P, R, and C mission symbols, use the following third character suffixes to identify
missions flown by specific MAJCOM: AMC use A, B, C; ACC use D, E, F; USAFE use G, H, I, J;
PACAF use K, L, M; AFSOC use N, O, P; ANG use Q, R, S; and AFRC use T, U, V; AETC use W,
X, Y and AFMC use Z. Guard and Reserve units will coordinate with their gaining MAJCOM to
determine if the Guard/Reserve or active duty MAJCOM suffix will be used. MAJCOMs will
provide HQ USAF/XOOT a copy of directives on the use of these mission symbols.
2. For all missions flown in designated combat areas, make the third character an A to differentiate
those combat missions where aerial delivery/recovery of airborne forces/equipment, ordnance
expended, or direct exposure to hostile fire occurred. The suffix B is used on designated combat

NOTES:
To meet OFDA, ACIP, CEFIP, or HDIP requirements, aircrew members must comply with the following:
         1. Log their flight time using both an aircrew certification code and position identifier valid to
            credit time (a "yes" in column 3).
         2. Log primary, secondary or instructor flight time. Evaluator flight time is also creditable when
            the evaluator is current in the aircraft. Otherwise the evaluator should use the aircrew certifi-
            cation code O or X.
         3. Be attaining or maintaining qualification in the aircraft.
         4. Operational support fliers must log primary time to meet the requirement for HDIP. When not
            performing primary duties, they will log other time.
         5. Inactive UAV time does not count towards OFDA and ACIP.
         6. Non-interference flyers other than (flying unit commanders) must receive HQ USAF/XOOT
            approval to log flying time on AFTO Form 781 and enter data into ARMS.

                             PREPARING AERONAUTICAL ORDERS

A3.1. Purpose Explained. AOs are:
   A3.1.1. Published on AF Form 1887, or on an approved computer output format, AOs or ARMS AO
   are used to validate individual qualification for aviation and parachutist service; to authorize and
   direct individual performance of duty that involves frequent and regular participation in aerial flight
   or parachute duties; and to establish or terminate individual entitlement to aviation career incentive
   pay (ACIP), career enlisted flyer incentive pay (CEFIP), and hazardous duty incentive pay (HDIP).
   HDIP for parachutists must specify static or HALO jump requirement authorized to perform and type
   of HDIP entitlement authorized. AOs initiating and authorizing aviation/parachutist service cannot be
   effective prior to being medically qualified.
NOTE: ARMS AOs are not considered “computer-generated” as stated in AFI 33-328, Administrative
Orders. HARMs evaluate products and process required changes in ARMS and an Aviation Resource
Manager generates the AO. ARMS no longer produces computer-generated AOs.
   A3.1.2. Maintained in individual FRFs/JRFs to provide a complete chronological history of each
   individual's aviation career. A record set will be maintained in the HARM office file system until
   moved to staging area.
   A3.1.3. Distributed according to Table A3.2.
   A3.1.4. Completed according to Table A3.1. through Table A3.4. (See Figure A3.1. for completed
   sample).
   A3.1.5. Signed by the wing Host Aviation Resource Manager (HARM). The wing HARM must be an
   Aviation Resource Management NCO (E-7 or above/civilian equivalent [GS-6] or E-7/GS-7 or above
   for ANG) with a seven (7) skill level, at least three years experience in the 1C0X2 career field, and a
   current CHARM qualification; and must have been awarded a CHARM SEI 066. Waiver to this
   requirement must be submitted to HQ USAF/XOOTF with full justification, proof of member’s qual-
   ification (copy of 1C0X2 training record AO task certification), and expected get well date.
      A3.1.5.1. The assistant CHARM may sign in the absence of the CHARM; however, the same
      qualification requirements above apply. Additionally, the statement “Signed for” must be written
      or typed above the signature block and the assistant CHARM signs their own name above the
      CHARM’s signature block.
NOTE: The only authentication stamp authorized is the CSAF on Department of the Air Force AOs.

A3.2. AOs Publication. Publish AOs for:
   A3.2.1. Officers and CEAs qualified for an aviation career (restricted to rated officers, officers in fly-
   ing training leading to award of an aeronautical rating, and the CEA designation) to:
      A3.2.1.1. Start or end the member's requirement to perform operational flight/jump duty.
      A3.2.1.2. Direct and record changes to ASC and incentive pay entitlement. When the AO initiates
      or terminates flight/jump pay at the same time as the ASC change, the bottom portion of the AO is
      completed and serves as a Military Pay Order (MPO) to start and stop flight/jump incentive pay.
122                                                          AFI11-401_AFRCSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2005


         HARMs will use a DD Form 114 to start and stop past or future entitlements based on qualifica-
         tions or actions not applicable to the current AO.
         A3.2.1.3. Establish the TSC for rated officers.
      A3.2.2. Members (officer and enlisted) not qualified for an aviation/parachutist career to:
         A3.2.2.1. Initiate or terminate member's requirement to perform regular and frequent flight (or
         jump) as a crewmember, parachutist, or operational support duties.
         A3.2.2.2. Direct and record changes to ASC, FAC 4, 5, 6, 8, and E duties and incentive pay enti-
         tlement.
         A3.2.2.3. Establish or terminate member's requirement to perform frequent and regular parachute
         jump duties as a parachutist member.
      A3.2.3. Award basic and advanced authorized ratings and badges. AOs that award aeronautical rat-
      ings, aircrew member badges, and parachutist ratings are single-action orders.
NOTE: AOs will not be published for qualified other US military or foreign service (unless in UFT)
members, professionally qualified civilian employees or government contractors to perform inflight
duties. These individuals will be placed on the unit’s flight authorization. (See paragraph 1.8.) Validate
US military and foreign service members have competent orders (AOs) from their respective service in
order to perform flying duties. HARMs may enter other US military, foreign service, or government civil-
ians members in ARMS for the purpose of tracking aircrew training and physical/physiological qualifica-
tions, when the member will perform flying duties on a frequent basis.

A3.3. General Instructions.
      A3.3.1. The HARM office prepares AOs IAW this instruction and inputs from unit HARMs, com-
      manders (including unit commanders) and HQ USAF/XOOT.
         A3.3.1.1. Number AOs in sequential order, starting with number one for each fiscal year. Cite,
         above the heading of the first order of a year, the number of the last order published the previous
         year. For example: FY02 Last AO was 1975.
             A3.3.1.1.1. A record set of AOs contains all orders published during a fiscal year, to include
             regular, amendment and revocation orders. Each order number must be accounted for (log
             required), from the first order through the last order published for that fiscal year. Multiple
             logs and numbers (with letters added) are not authorized.
             A3.3.1.1.2. A separate file of background material (from official sources), which supports
             each order’s publication, must be maintained for each fiscal year IAW AFMAN 37-139.
             Annotate (in ink) the background material in the lower right-hand corner (bottom margin of
             page) to show the order number to which it pertains. For example: Supporting document (or
             background material) for AO # 0469, dated 15 Dec 2002.
                 A3.3.1.1.2.1. Source documents are from personnel database interfaces, military identifi-
                 cation cards, finance system documents, re-enlistment papers, etc. Do not use documents
                 that transferred dates or information from one source document to another—use the
                 source. If using information logged on a member’s in-processing or out-processing check-
                 list, for example DDLDS or Effective Date of Duty to process AOs, the HARM must
                 request a MILPDS interface and validate the data for processing the AO.
AFI11-401_AFRCSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2005                                                                       123


         A3.3.1.1.3. Post each amendment or revocation to the HARM record set and FRF/JRF
         (amendment only) copy. Post in ink on the left margin of the original order. For example:
         Revoked by AO #2424, dated 18 Sep 02.
     A3.3.1.2. Confirm verbal orders (in writing) within three duty-days. Include in the written order
     the date and by whom the verbal order was issued and, if flying/jump status or aeronautical rat-
     ings/badges were affected, a statement why written orders were not issued earlier. For example,
     “The verbal orders of the commander on (date) are confirmed; circumstances prevented written
     orders in advance.”
  A3.3.2. Unit commanders send a letter to the HARM to request aviation or parachutist service actions
  that originate at the unit level. For example: Initiating aviation/parachutist service, non-interference
  flying, or operational support requests.
  A3.3.3. The host base Information Management (IM) office makes reproduction facilities available
  for publishing AOs when these facilities are not available within the HARM.
  A3.3.4. HARMs may publish a single aeronautical order affecting several members providing the
  action is exactly the same for each member. For group orders, mask information protected under the
  Privacy Act of 1974 (SSNs) to prevent unauthorized disclosure.
  A3.3.5. A single AO may be published directing several actions that pertain to an individual, pro-
  vided all actions have the same effective and termination dates. (EXCEPTION: AOs awarding basic
  or advanced aeronautical ratings or badges do not contain other actions.)
  A3.3.6. Use the AF Form 1887 or ARMS AO to amend or revoke a previous AO.
     A3.3.6.1. Amend AOs to correct minor administrative errors (erroneous SSN, improper grade,
     termination date, misspelled name, etc.), if the intent of the original order is unaffected by the cor-
     rection. The amendment order should contain the original effective date and only other required
     identifying data (name, grade, SSAN, and organization) and the amended data. Underline
     amended items. (An amendment makes the amended order read as it should have initially.) An AF
     Form 1887 is the recommended medium for amending AO because, as an automated system,
     ARMS automatically includes current information that may not be applicable for the effective
     period of the AO being amended. Using an AF Form 1887 avoids HARM system “work-arounds”
     that entail entering false date into ARMS. False data may interface with other Air Force systems
     and corrupt promotion or assignment processes. (NOTE following this paragraph remains
     unchanged.)
         A3.3.6.1.1. Each AO requiring correction must have a separate amendment.
         A3.3.6.1.2. Do not publish an amendment order to another amendment order. Revoke the
         incorrect amendment and publish a single correct amendment.
         A3.3.6.1.3. Amending a termination date is authorized, except on an AO published to change
         a termination date. In this case, the AO’s intent was incorrect from the beginning. When
         amending an AO, document in ink the AO number and request date of the amendment AO on
         the lower left-hand margin of the original AO in the record set and FRF being amended. For
         example: Amended by AO #13, dated 13 Oct 03.
         A3.3.6.1.4. HARM offices are not authorized to amend an AO to correct an effective date.
         Since the intent of a published AO is that the AO is valid from the beginning (effective date),
124                                                         AFI11-401_AFRCSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2005


             an incorrect AO effective date invalidates that AO from the beginning. HARM offices must
             revoke the AO and publish a new AO with the correct effective date and the required aviation
             service change.
NOTE: HARM offices are authorized to amend other HARM offices’ AOs (provide copy to original
office).
         A3.3.6.2. Do not rescind AOs. Action taken on a later AO supersedes only the same item on pre-
         vious orders. Previously awarded items on an order maintain the same effective date. Example:
         MSgt Jones', (ASC 9D) aeronautical order (AO) will terminate 27 December 2003. However,
         MSgt Jones reenlists on 15 Dec 2003, and is to remain on active flying status. An AO must be
         printed to reflect the new termination date based on the new DOS; the effective date of the AO
         will remain the same as the AO that placed MSgt Jones on flying status.
         A3.3.6.3. Revoke an order when it is void and without effect from the beginning. (A revocation
         deletes the order from the chronological history in the member’s FRF or JRF.) However, the
         revoked AO must be filed with the record set background material of AOs to support the AO being
         published. When an AO is revoked, it no longer exists as an official document. Do not revoke a
         revocaton; instead, publish a new order. For Example: When the HARM publishes AO #2424 to
         revoke AO #444. Remove AO #444 from the FRF and file AO #2424 in the HARM record set.
         Document revoked information on the lower left-hand side margin of the record set AO being
         revoked. For example: Revoked by AO #167, dated 18 Jan 03. HARMs must send a copy of both
         AOs to the member and HQ AFPC/DPMAOY. HQ AFPC/DPMAOY maintains a permanent file
         in member’s historical file to show all aviation service actions processed.
NOTE: If a revoked AO is the MPO source document, it may be moved to the MPO section of the FRF;
however, it will not be filed in the chronological AO portion of the FRF.

A3.4. Restrictions on Publication.
      A3.4.1. Do not publish an AO to authorize Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) or Air National
      Guard (ANG) personnel to take part in flight activity during short periods of EAD. EXCEPTION:
      AOs will be published for AFRC and ANG personnel while attending the Flight Screening Program.
      A3.4.2. The AO effective date cannot be before the date the member met all eligibility requirements.
      A3.4.3. Prior to publication of the AO terminating aviation service for non-CEA enlisted aircrew
      members, the HARM must ensure the member was given a 120-day notification before removal from
      aviation service. Receipt of assignment notification documentation from the MPF, as directed by AFI
      36-2102, Base-Level Relocation Procedures, verbal orders of the member’s unit commander (written
      confirmation must be received within three duty-days), or any official documentation received from
      HQ USAF/XOOT constitutes certification and will be noted in remarks of the published order. Place
      MPFs on distribution for all such AOs.
      A3.4.4. AOs should not be published later than the effective date if the action changes, initiates, or
      terminates incentive pay entitlement or OFDA, unless:
         A3.4.4.1. The AO confirms an ASC change as a result of PCS. In this case, the effective date is
         the day after the member signs out from the losing organization, as provided by the MPF. A retro-
         active statement is not necessary for this action. HARMs will verify DDLDS documented on the
         member’s in-processing sheet with MILPDS data.
AFI11-401_AFRCSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2005                                                              125


     A3.4.4.2. The AO involves circumstances where a directive establishes an effective date of AO.
     Cite the governing directive that applies as authority.

Table A3.1. Instructions for Preparation of the AF Form 1887, Aeronautical Order Aviation
Service.
Item #                Check appropriate blocks(s) and enter information as follows:
Item 1 (AO Action)    (Initiate Aviation Service Period.) When this item is entered for rated
                      officers who were previous fliers (except flight surgeons), include in item
                      15 the total number of months of operational flying as of the effective date
                      of the order (item 18). An aviation service period is initiated for rated
                      officers and CEA’s on entry into flying training that leads to an aeronautical
                      rating or badge and at each subsequent aviation career phase point (10, 12,
                      15, 18, and 20 years aviation service).
                      (Change Aviation Service Code From.) If member had no aviation
                      service code before the date of this order, enter “NA.”
                      (Revoke/Amend.) When AF Form 1887 is used to amend or revoke a
                      previous AO indicated the action taken, and the previous AO number
                      referenced. For example: “Amend AO 444.” “Revoke AO 222,” etc.
                      Complete item 16 as required.
                      (Establish ASD.) Used for all non-rated members who enter a course of
                      instruction leading to pilot, navigator, flight surgeon, or CEA rating.
                      (Aircraft Assignment.) Used to list aircraft each member is authorized to
                      obtain and maintain qualification and log flying time for entitlement to
                      incentive pays and OFDA.
                      (Authorized Temporary Flying Duty.) Used for cadets in special training
                      status.
                      (Authorized Noninterference Flying Duty.) Used for non-rated members
                      required to perform official specific tasks (more than once) who do not
                      meet the criteria to qualify for aircrew or operational support status.
                      (Other.) Used for all other reasons. Complete item 16 as required.
                       *Delete* NOTE: HARMs are not required to publish aircraft assignment
                      AOs. For officers not assigned directly to a flying unit (for example: wing
                      or group), at a base with multi-type aircraft, a letter approving attachment
                      for flying (coordinated through unit CC, DO, or DOV) documenting the
                      member’s primary aircraft to obtain/maintain aircrew qualification is
                      needed to process or validate active AOs. Letters approving crew
                      augmentation or authorization to perform mission-related observation or
                      evaluation duties in and aircraft (s) an aircrew member is not in crew
                      complement or obtaining/maintaining qualification in must also be filed in
                      the FRF in order to log time in an aircraft (IAW paragraph 3.3.).
                      Additionally, a letter of justification is required from the member's
                      MAJCOM to fly in non-USAF aircraft, IAW paragraph 1.11.. Letter (s) if
                      applicable must be permanently filed on the left-hand side of the member's
                      FRF. The letter will serve as the authorizing aircraft assignment action for
                      the member.

                      b. (Awarding Aeronautical Rating.) When awarding a basic aeronautical
                      rating, enter name of course completed, class designation or number, date
                      of completion and school location. For helicopter-only rated pilots, AO
                      remarks will reflect “Member is awarded helicopter-only pilot rating.”
                      Graduation from UFT or fixed wing qual constitutes award of fixed wing
                      rating.

                      ARMS AIRCREW/MISSION FLIGHT DATA EXTRACT

A4.1. Purpose. The AF Form 3520 is the source document for recording and reporting flight training and
space shuttle/space station information for each individual authorized to take part in missions. This form
is an alternate method to record individual flying hours for a member who is TDY and performs several
missions, in different aircraft, for different days, away from home unit/duty station. It is an official record
to validate flight pay eligibility for rated, CEA, and other non-rated officer and enlisted members required
to fly and use this extract to log time while TDY. The original AF Form 3520, ARMS Aircrew/Mission
Flight Data Extract, must be maintained in the HARM office that services the unit to which the member
is assigned.

A4.2. Scope. The instructions listed on the reverse side of the AF Form 3520 apply to all rated, CEA, and
other non-rated officer and enlisted members authorized to log flight time while attending training to
attain qualification in an aircraft or training device and to log authorized flights in non-USAF aircraft
(includes space shuttle and space station) for the purpose of maintaining an official Air Force Individual
Flight Record. Source documents used to transfer flight data from non-USAF aircraft are maintained as
source documents IAW AFMAN 37-139.

A4.3. Responsibilities. SARM/HARM personnel are responsible for distributing and collecting these
forms. Completing the AF Form 3520 is a responsibility of the aircrew member.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING AF FORM 4327, ARMS FIGHTER FLIGHT AUTHORIZATION,
          AND AF FORM 4327A, CREW FLIGHT AUTHORIZATION (FA)

A5.1. Purpose. Unit commanders will use the AF Form 4327 and 4327a to authorize the use of USAF
aircraft to perform a specific mission(s), and to authorize aircrew members required to perform in-flight
duties. Use the AF Form 4327 to authorize flights of fighter and trainer aircraft for missions that originate
and end at the same location. Use the AF Form 4327a to authorize all other aircraft missions and for fight-
ers/trainers (if desired). These are critical documents used during mission review to validate duties per-
formed/logged on the AFTO Form 781, and for reimbursement of temporary duty expenses.
      A5.1.1. Additional members authorized to fly, who are not required to perform aircrew duties (except
      for noninterference flyers on AOs, and ACMs and MEGP when specifically authorized [see paragraph
      A5.1.3]) must be listed on a passenger manifest.
      A5.1.2. The FA accounts for aircrew personnel required/authorized to perform in-flight aircrew
      duties and the passenger manifest lists all additional members approved to fly on the aircraft, but not
      performing specific aircrew duties on that mission. ACMs and MEGP may be listed on the FA, in the
      Remarks section; if not listed on the FA, these individuals will be placed on the passenger manifest.
      The FA and passenger manifest combined account for all personnel on the aircraft.

A5.2. Scope. These instructions apply to all flying unit commanders with operational control of USAF
aircraft who direct the use of aircraft and aircrews in support of command operations, and AE and parares-
cue unit commanders who publish AE/PJ flight authorizations for aircrew members assigned to their unit
that are required to perform aircrew duties on the mission.

A5.3. Responsibilities. The AF Form 4327 and 4327a are established by this instruction. Aviation
Resource Management personnel are responsible for publication of these forms, and performing Go/
No-Go validation (review of ARMS products and member’s AOs) for the operations officer during
pre-mission review.
      A5.3.1. When additional aircrew members are added after completion of the form, the authenticating
      official, aircraft commander, or flight lead must validate Go/No-Go requirements by validating
      ARMS training products and AOs prior to flight.
      A5.3.2. The completed FA will be used during post mission review with the AFTO Form 781 to
      ensure all aircrew members authorized to perform duties are documented. The aircraft commander
      will document deviations between scheduled duties on the FA (Duty Position) and actual duties per-
      formed in the remarks of the AFTO Form 781.
      A5.3.3. The completed FA is normally filed with the AFTO Form 781 and other mission paperwork.
      The Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) lists the minimum disposition requirements of this
      form. MAJCOM supplements may require the form to be maintained longer.

mander will submit the request for an extension/waiver prior to the 180-day limit expiring. If a waiver of
the 180-limit was previously approved IAW paragraph 1.3.2., the unit commander must obtain AF/XOO
waiver approval prior to the member exceeding 365 days in this status. AFI 11-402, Aviation and Para-
chutist Service, Aeronautical Ratings and Badges, provides applicable guidance for suspensions/disqual-
ifications.
1.4.2.1. Commanders will manage rated and CEA aircrew positions IAW AFI 11-412, Aircrew Manage-
ment.
1.4.2.2. Commanders will manage non-rated aircrew and parachutist positions IAW AFI 11-402.
1.4.2.2.1. DELETED.
1.5.1. Safely and effectively use available flying and parachute jump resources to obtain and maintain air-
crew or parachutist qualification when assigned to active flying or jump billets. See AFI 11-402 for guid-
ance pertaining to failure of members to attain/maintain aircrew or parachutist training requirements.
1.5.1.1. SARMs/TARMs must assign aircrew or parachutist training requirements in ARMS to all fliers/
jumpers assigned to active billets.
1.5.2. Accomplish an annual flight or jump records review in the HARM office (except for geographically
separated units [GSU]) to validate aviation/parachutist service actions and the record of flying or jump
accomplishments during the previous year. HARMs may mail annual record review documents to a GSU
for a member’s review and certification. Member will complete the review and sign the INDIVIDUAL
DATA SUMMARY (IDS) not later than the end of the member’s birth month. (Does not apply to cadets,
who do not have FRF/JRF requirements.)
1.5.3.3. Notify the HARM office of any permanent change of assignment (PCA), to include pending PCA
moves. The SARM/TARM will establish procedures to notify the HARM of PCA moves for assigned air-
crew/parachutist members. Provide gaining unit, effective date of assignment, and position number. The
HARM office must be advised if the position will require flying or jumping that will require an update to
the Aviation Resource Management System (ARMS) and the publication of any necessary AOs.
1.5.4. Pick up the Flight Evaluation Folder (FEF), FRF, or JRF before departing for PCS or flying/jump-
ing TDY (ref. para 3.1.4.1.). Member must ensure they have a current copy of AO, IDS, and ARMS train-
ing summary prior to departure on a jump/flying TDY. Members initiating parachutist status, scheduled to
attend jump school, must give the HARM a copy of their TDY orders to process initial AO authorizing
jump status at least 5 work-days prior to TDY.

1.6.1. During Time of War. Commanders (including unit commanders) may order Air Force members on
active duty to make flights in any aircraft. They are not entitled to incentive pay unless placed on active
AOs that require them to perform specific in-flight duties on a frequent and regular basis (to include air-
craft AOs) as defined in this instruction. Members are not entitled to such pay if the pay is suspended by
the President according to Title 37 U.S.C. 301(d) or 301a(c). They are entitled to flight credit IAW para-
graph 3.3. of this instruction based on the commander's tasking.
1.6.1.1. Members qualified on the aircraft in which they are tasked to perform in-flight duties log the air-
crew certification code IAW Table A2.3. of this instruction and flying hours associated with duties per-
formed.
1.6.1.2. Members not qualified on the aircraft in which they are tasked to perform in-flight duties log “O”
or “X” aircrew certification code (first character) and other time. If member obtains qualification while
deployed, and aircraft AOs are not processed prior to the flight, the flying unit commander may issue a
verbal order IAW paragraph A3.3.1.2.of this instruction.
1.6.2.2. Military members not on AOs, and not required to perform duties or obtain and maintain qualifi-
cation on the mission, must fly in passenger status, will be placed on a passenger manifest, and must fly
on commercial or military aircraft with adequate facilities for transporting passengers. Refer to para-
graphs 1.9.4.7.1.,2.12.5.., and applicable MDS-Specific guidance for further passenger guidance/restric-
tions.
1.8.1. Commanders (including unit commanders) issue written authorizations prior to all flights in Air
Force aircraft documenting all crewmembers required to perform aircrew duties on the mission. Units will
use AF Form 4327, ARMS Fighter Flight Authorization, or AF Form 4327a, Crew Flight Authoriza-
tion, as applicable to the unit aircraft. A commander's (including unit commanders) verbal authorization
may direct aircraft flight only when time constraints or administrative procedures prevent written authori-
zation. Written confirmation of this order must be issued within three duty-days. Once a flight authoriza-
tion has been signed, changes must be validated by a designated approving authority by placing the
approving authority’s initials by the line changed. The commander with operational control of the aircraft
will publish the flight authorization.
1.8.1.1. Validation of go-no-go qualification must be accomplished IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 2, Aircrew Stan-
dardization/Evaluation Program, prior to authorizing members to participate in aircrew or operational
support duties, IAW AFI 11-421. Once a flight authorization has been published, aircraft commanders are
responsible for validating aircrew or operational support members prior to authorizing them to fly and
adding them to the flight authorization. Validation may include ARMS products IAW AFI 11-421 (or
comparable database for USAFA airmanship programs), or a letter from the member’s unit validating the
individual’s qualification for authorization to fly on required missions. Once validated, members are
added to the aircraft flight authorization for that mission.
1.8.2. Once a flight authorization has been signed and a mission is later canceled, line through the can-
celed portion(s) of the flight authorization and annotate the reason for cancellation (e.g. weather or main-
tenance cancel).
1.8.3. Flight authorizations will only include personnel on AOs (or contract aircrew personnel on a mem-
orandum of agreement/contract) authorized to perform in-flight duties for that mission according to para-
graphs 1.10.and 3.3. of this instruction. Except for non-interference members, individuals on the flight
authorization should match those authorized to log time on the AFTO Form 781, ARMS Aircrew/Mis-
sion Flight Data Extract.

1.8.3.1. Personnel who are on the aircraft for point-to-point travel, an orientation/familiarization flight or
to only perform a proficiency jump (not performing aircrew duties for that mission), will be listed on the
passenger manifest.

NOTES:
1. “Orientation flights” are defined as continuous flights performed within the local flying area and termi-
nating at the point of origin (DoD 4515.13-R, Chapter 4). “Note 1 N/A,” means the category of flight is
not considered an orientation flight; however, it is included in the table as a consolidated reference source.
2. Requests for point-to-point travel must be specifically addressed and approved by SECAF. Retiring
members of Congress and retiring congressional staff members may be flown on orientation flights only
upon the written approval of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Legislative Affairs (ASD[LA]). (Ref.
DSD Memo, 23 Dec 1996.)
3. When aircraft are “chopped” or assigned to a gaining Combatant Commander, approval authority will
be the Commander Air Force Forces (COMAFFOR) or Theater Special Operations Command (SOC)
commander.
4. The USAFA Superintendent is the approval authority for USAFA aircraft flights.
5. Inform AF/CC/XO/XOO, if approved.
6. Flights involving foreign nationals must be reviewed for foreign disclosure requirements and political
concerns. Note: Foreign military “civilian equivalents” are comparable to DoD “civilian equivalents.”
a. Ensure foreign disclosure requirements and base visit requests are satisfied according to AFI 16-201,
Disclosure of Military Information to Foreign Governments and International Organizations.
b. Coordinate with the country director in the appropriate SAF/IA regional division (three-letter level),
before approval, to ensure no political concerns that would prevent the flight.
7. This authorization does not include transportation to or from the exercise area or supporting flights uti-
lized for logistics purposes only.
AFI11-401_AFRCSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2005                                                                      153


8. Does not include spouses of government personnel, non-DoD Federal officials, or members of Con-
gress and their staffs.
9. 34 TRW/CC is approval authority for USAFA.
10. For foreign students enrolled in USAF Academy or ROTC programs, ensure foreign disclosure
requirements (AFI 16-201) concerning visit authorizations and disclosure of USAF information are satis-
fied.
11. This is not intended to allow all Government contractor employees to fly. The contractors must be per-
forming work in direct support of the approving command (aircrew training system and aircraft main-
tenance contractors are the most frequent participants). Normally, the requirement for familiarization
flights should be specified in the government contract.
12. For public affairs flight purposes, a local flight is a continuous flight originating and ending at the
same location aboard aircraft assigned to that location. For aircraft permanently assigned to one location,
but temporarily deployed to another location, the commander with operational control of the aircraft at the
deployed location may approve local orientation flights at the deployed location, IAW the provisions of
this AFI and this Table.
13. For public affairs flight purposes, a non-local flight is a flight from one location to another
(point-to-point flight).
14. Foreign citizens are not included in DoD 4515.13-R as passengers eligible for orientation flights.
“Civic leaders” applies to U.S. civic leaders. See line 25. AF/CV approval is required. (Note 6 applies to
flights involving foreign nationals.)
15. For youth in Congressionally sanctioned, DoD-approved Youth Programs, program participants may
take part in no more than one orientation flight (Ref DoD 4515.13-R, Chapter 4). Parental and/or guardian
permission is required and the flight must be approved by SAF/PA.
16. Passengers on orientation flights under 18 years of age require parental approval in writing.
17. Travel, which is designed to improve relations, increase good will, or serve humanitarian purposes,
does not meet the criteria.
18. Requests for exception to policy must be submitted through command channels according to DoD
4515.13-R, Chapter 10, and AFI 24-101. NOTE: Exception to policy authority delegated from CSAF to
AF/CV IAW AFI 24-101.
19. Cadets and midshipmen are authorized orientation flights while on leave status.
20. Aircrew members in suspended (ASC 04) or DNIF status are not authorized familiarization/orienta-
tion or incentive flights without an approved waiver from HQ USAF/XOOT.
1.10.1. A person may not perform duties in Air Force aircraft unless specifically authorized, physically
qualified (member cannot be in DNIF status--commanders will not authorize any aircrew member in
DNIF status to be placed on the flight authorization to perform aircrew duties), and current in physiolog-
ical training (if applicable or on an approved waiver). IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 1, Aircrew Training, individ-
uals will not be scheduled to fly when they are delinquent in physiological training (when required IAW
AFI 11-403, Aerospace Physiological Training Program). Unit commanders must restrict individuals
from performing inflight duties in the unit assigned aircraft when such performance may adversely impact
safety, morale, or mission accomplishment. Commanders (including unit commanders) may authorize the

following to perform aircrew (as part of the authorized crew complement IAW AFI 65-503, U.S. Air
Force Cost and Planning Factors, or required for the mission according to paragraph 3.3. of this instruc-
tion) and operational support duties on board Air Force aircraft:
1.10.1.1. Qualified members of US military services who hold a current aeronautical rating, are on active
AOs (including aircraft AOs) to take part in frequent and regular flights, and are within the authorized
crew complement (AFI 65-503) for the aircraft or required for the mission. Aircrew members will per-
form duty associated with their current aeronautical rating and aircrew qualification. Flying solely for the
purpose of qualifying for incentive pay or Operational Flying Duty Accumulator (OFDA) credit is not
authorized. Documentation for those individuals not in the crew complement or not on aircraft AOs for
the specific aircraft must be on file in the member’s FRF IAW paragraph 3.3. prior to authorizing such
duties. The SARM/TARM office will keep a copy of member’s military service current AOs, including
aircraft AOs, on file.
1.10.1.2. Qualified non-rated officers and enlisted personnel of US military services who are on AOs
(including aircraft AOs) and who are required to perform mission essential inflight duties on a full time
basis.
1.10.1.3. Operational support fliers who are on AOs and who are required to perform essential specific
inflight duties on an occasional basis that cannot be accomplished by regularly assigned crew members,
and other non-rated members on non-interference AOs who fly occasionally to perform specific official
inflight tasks. Flying solely for the purpose of qualifying for Hazardous Duty Incentive Pay is not autho-
rized. The SARM office will keep a copy of member’s current military service AOs on file.
1.10.9. US Air Force Academy cadets and Air Force ROTC cadets enrolled in approved USAFA flying
programs are accorded aircrew status while actively participating in such programs. Cadets will be placed
on an AF Form 1887, Aeronautical Order, authorizing USAFA Airmanship Program flying status.
Cadets will not be added into an operational ARMS database, an Aviation Service Code (ASC) will not be
assigned, and an Aviation Service Date (ASD) will not be established. Neither flying incentive pay nor
flying duty credit are authorized.
1.10.2. Family members will not be assigned to airborne duty on the same aircraft for a given mission.
Family member is defined as spouse, brother, sister, parent, and child. MAJCOMs are authorized to waive
this prohibition on a case-by-case basis, only where unusual conditions dictate.
1.11.1. With MAJCOM approval, aircrew members in active flying positions, and authorized operational
support personnel, may perform appropriate duties in non-US Air Force aircraft if it is in the interest of
the US Government, approved by the authority that controls the aircraft, and the members are qualified
and, if applicable, licensed to perform such duties. Prior to authorizing these missions, MAJCOMs will
ensure a valid requirement for a USAF aircrew member to operationally fly exists, which cannot be
accomplished in USAF aircraft. For operational support flying, justification must show that qualified air-
crew or operational support personnel of other (non-US Air Force) services or applicable organizations
cannot perform such duties. Requests to fly solely for the purpose of qualifying for incentive pay or Oper-
ational Flying Duty Accumulator (OFDA) credit will not be approved.
1.11.1. NOTE: Performing these duties does not remove military personnel from line-of-duty determina-
tion status. When aircrew members are not assigned to API 7 or API G coded positions, MAJCOMs must
provide the member’s HARM office with a letter of justification authorizing the member to perform offi-
cial aircrew duties in non-US Air Force aircraft and log flying time IAW paragraph 3.3. and assign an
appropriate aircrew qualification code IAW Table A3.1.. In addition, Wing/CCs or equivalents (or higher,
AFI11-401_AFRCSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2005                                                                          155


as applicable with the member’s chain of command) must authorize orientation flights in non-USAF air-
craft for USAF aircrew members.
1.13.3. Foreign military personnel assigned or attached to a US Air Force or a joint staff organization,
whose duties require such flights as part of combined operations or exercises (such as Red Flag, Blue
Flag, etc.).

H                    Other. Reserved for use only when directed by HQ USAF/XOO.




2.4.1.3. Use the day after DDLDS from the losing organization for a PCS move that requires an ASC
change. This includes inactive officers who require active AOs to attend formal flying training TDY
enroute to PCS to an active flying assignment. EXCEPTIONS:
2.4.1.3.3. A previously rated officer or CEA returning to another UFT course will maintain their current
ASC until the UFT class-start date. For example: Captain Lopez, a rated navigator with a current ASC of
1A is selected to attend pilot UFT. Captain Lopez has a PCS assignment to Laughlin AFB to attend UPT
and departs Robins AFB on 5 Sep 02. The UFT class-start date is 15 Sep 02. Laughlin HARM changes
Captain Lopez’s ASC from 1A to 1U effective 15 Sep 02.
2.4.1.11. Parachutists. Only individuals assigned to authorized permanent (UMD “J” prefix or DAFSC
1C2X1, 1T2X1, and 13DX) positions, temporary or permissive jump status, or USAFA cadets, are autho-
rized to have AOs published. Commander requests to initiate jump status are processed IAW AFI 11-410.
Disqualification requests are processed IAW AFI 11-402.
2.6.2.2. The 1989 Act modified the required OFDA months rated officers must achieve for ACIP entitle-
ment. The new law established revised OFDA requirements of 9, 10, and 12 years from earlier require-
ment of 6, 9, and 11 years. The effective date for the new criteria was 1 October 1991. On 1 October 1991,
the USAF began transition to the new gate structure and rated members were assigned Transition Status
Codes (TSC) in order to determine their gate requirements. Rated officers with ASDs of 1 October 1985
and later were required to meet the 9, 10, and 12-year OFDA requirements under the ACIA of 1989. How-
ever, the FY96 NDAA again modified gate requirements.
2.6.4.1. Be assigned to primary or corollary duties that require flying and perform valid flying duties in
the current month or preceding three months which authorize OFDA credit.
AFI11-401_AFRCSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2005                                                                         157


2.6.4.2. Be assigned to rated/CEA in-flight or similar AVO duties in an FSC A, U, X, or Z for at least 15
days within each calendar month that he or she received operational flying credit from the current month
of creditable flying or previous three months of creditable flying duty. Rated officers or CEA members
assigned to an active flying billet pending a PCS assignment to an inactive assignment should ensure that
they sign out on or later than the 16th day of the month in order to receive OFDA credit. They must have
also performed OFDA-creditable flying within three months of the departure month.
2.7. OFDA Waivers. The Aviation Career Improvement Act of 1989 authorized the Secretary of the Air
Force (SECAF) to waive OFDA requirements for rated officers and CEAs who are unable to meet their
flying gates due to reasons beyond their control. Each year, MAJCOM commanders submit nominations
for Lieutenant Colonels and below to HQ USAF/XOOT or, for CMSgts and Colonels and above, to HQ
USAF/AFSLMO for staffing to SECAF. To implement this program the following procedures apply:
2.7.1.3. For gate waivers submitted from the MAJCOM or equivalent, and approved by SECAF after the
loss of continuous pay, members will be authorized AOs (continuous entitlement status) from the date the
member submitted to the MAJCOM or equivalent (if otherwise qualified).
2.7.8. MAJCOM commanders will forward OFDA waiver nominations to HQ USAF/XOOT for Lieuten-
ant Colonels and below, or to HQ USAF/AFSLMO for CMSgts, Colonels and above (include brief, indi-
vidual narratives, and individual’s current Aviation Audit worksheet).
2.7.9. Submit OFDA waiver requests no earlier than the year prior to loss of flight pay. Submissions will
be to the servicing HARM office and staffed to the MAJCOM. For members assigned to Headquarters,
USAF, submit waivers through the individual’s supervisory chain of command (DP, XO, XP, etc.), then to
XOOT or AFSLMO. For members not assigned to an Air Force MAJCOM (i.e. members assigned to
organizations such as USCENTCOM, USPACOM, or USSTRATCOM), individuals will submit packages
to their servicing Air Force HARM, which will staff requests packages to the HARM MAJCOM. As a
minimum, the submission will include the member’s dated request letter, Aviation Service Worksheet,
justification for OFDA request, Military Personnel Data System duty history (SURF), and any other doc-
uments to support justification. Packages forwarded to HAF for SECAF approval must also contain MAJ-
COM (or equivalent) indorsement.
2.7.9.2.1. If the rated officer requests waiver of the first gate, submit their name during the officer's 11th
year of aviation service; the 17th year of aviation service for a waiver of the second gate; and the 21st year
of aviation service for a waiver of the third gate.
2.7.11. After HQ USAF/XOOT or HQ USAF/AFLSMO verifies that the above criteria were met, HQ
USAF/XO and HQ USAF/DP staff representatives will review and forward nominations to SECAF for
consideration of an OFDA waiver (not to exceed minimum gate month requirement).
2.7.12.1. The MAJCOM OFDA waiver process must include Operations Staff (DO) and Personnel Staff
(DP) to ensure compliance with all regulations and laws. Prior to MAJCOM/CC approval, each waiver
may be sent to HQ USAF/XOOT or HQ USAF/AFSLMO for an informal review. Each submitted pack-
age must include a Staff Summary Sheet stating the case, any correspondences written by the individual
and/or their chain of command, a current Aviation Audit worksheet for the individual (obtained from indi-
vidual’s HARM), current ARMS IDS, and any other relevant background information on the case.
2.7.12.2. HQ USAF/XOOT or HQ USAF/AFSLMO will provide a recommendation to the submitting
MAJCOM staff stating their assessment of the validity of each case. This assessment may be used by the
MAJCOM staff to decide whether or not to forward a formal package.
158                                                         AFI11-401_AFRCSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2005


2.7.13. AFRC and ANG will develop initial MAJCOM procedures for reviewing OFDA waiver
packages. Following MAJCOM/CC approval, forward OFDA waiver packages to HQ USAF/XOOT or
HQ USAF/AFSLMO for processing and final action.
2.8.2.2. If special circumstances require rated officers to perform temporary in-flight non-rated or
non-crew (operational support duties) duties, HARMs change the member’s FAC to an 8 in ARMS. For
rated officers who were in inactive status, publish an AO, with the FAC 8, FSC J, and document in remark
section of AO: “Rated Officer assigned to perform in-flight non-rated (or non-crew) duties.” Officers per-
forming non-rated duties log aircrew certification code “Z” on the AFTO Form 781 and flight time does
not count towards OFDA or ACIP entitlement.
2.8.4. Reserve officers not on extended active duty (EAD) may be assigned to inactive rated positions
(API 3 or API 4).
2.10.2. Flight surgeons must be medically and physiologically (if applicable) qualified, and maintain
flight medicine credentials before being authorized active flying status. In addition, they must be assigned
to an API 5 unit manpower document (UMD) position with Duty Air Force Specialty Code (DAFSC)
48XX, or 40C0C with an additional AFSC of 48XX, be on active flying status AOs (including aircraft
AOs), and be qualified in the aircraft to receive conditional ACIP. IAW DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 7a,
Military Pay Policy and Procedures - Active Duty and Reserve Pay, flight surgeons are conditional fliers
and qualification for entitlement to conditional ACIP is earned by completing a prescribed minimum
number of operational flying hours per month, and by performing the minimum flying hour requirements
IAW the DoD FMR and AFI 11-421, Aviation Resource Management.
2.10.2.1. When flight surgeons are assigned to non-API coded “0” positions, AOs will be terminated and
members will be assigned ASC 8J. Inactive flight surgeons may be authorized to fly and log time without
ACIP on a noninterference basis with unit training and flying schedules. Flight surgeons not qualified in
an aircraft, on inactive AOs, or observing ground-based UAV aircrew will log only “Other” flight time
and document remarks on the reverse side of AFTO Form 781 (for example, “Inactive flight surgeon,” or
“Flight surgeon not qualified in aircraft”). Paragraphs 2.16.3.through 2.16.5. apply.
2.10.3. Pilot-Physician Procedures. AFI 11-405, The Pilot-Physician Program, prescribes procedures for
the US Air Force Pilot-Physician Program. Pilot-physicians remain conditional fliers for ACIP entitle-
ment and do not earn OFDA credit. Except as noted above, active flying pilot-physicians will be assigned
ASC 8A, FAC 9, and API 5, and hold the DAFSC of 48VX. Retain members in ESC 8 beyond 25 years of
aviation service. Credit flight time logged as a pilot towards advanced pilot and flight surgeon ratings
(only when member is assigned FAC 9) and ACIP entitlement.
2.12.4. NOTE (added): The frequency a member is required to perform tasks help commanders decide
whether or not to request AOs for non-interference fliers. Non-interference fliers not on AOs will be listed
on the passenger manifest.
AFI11-401_AFRCSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2005                                                               159

2.14.3.2. Colonel. MAJCOMs designate colonel active flying positions (API 8) by forwarding AF Form
480, Aircrew AFSC/Active Flying Justification, for review and approval to HQ USAF/AFSLMO (see
AFI 38-201, Determining Manpower Requirements). Colonel flying positions should only be for indi-
viduals who directly supervise aircraft flying operations, flight safety, standardization/evaluation pro-
grams, and operational readiness inspection programs. Should positions not warrant full time flying, there
may be justification for the individual to participate in the indoctrination flying program.
2.14.3.3. Lieutenant Colonel and Below. MAJCOMs designate Lt Colonel-and-below rated officer and
CEA positions that require active flying IAW AFI 38-201. If the position requires an AF Form 480, pro-
vide justification for flying on the form. Normally, API 8 positions are only authorized above wing level
(NAF/FOA/DRU/MAJCOM) in safety, inspector general, and standardization/evaluation functional areas
in which flying is a requirement associated with the position. On occasion, justification may exist for an
aircrew member to fly while in inactive status; see paragraph 2.16.
2.16.5. Obtaining or maintaining aircraft qualification while in inactive status is not authorized. Docu-
ment flights on the AFTO Form 781, ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document. Individuals fly-
ing in inactive status may not act as pilot in command and flights in single-place aircraft are specifically
prohibited. See paragraph 3.4.1.1.1. for information on logging flying time.
2.17. NOTE: (Added) SARMs are authorized to maintain/manage their unit members’ FRFs/JRFs only
when there is no established HARM office for the installation or locale. Requests for exceptions to this
policy must be submitted to HQ USAF/XOOT for approval prior to operating independent SARM offices.
2.17.2. Maintain all FRFs/JRFs according to this instruction, AFI 11-410, Personnel Parachute Opera-
tions, AFI 11-421, Aviation Resource Management, AFPD 37-1, Information Management, AFMAN
37-123, Management of Records, and dispose or records in accordance with the Air Force Records Dispo-
sition Schedule (RDS), located at https://webrims.amc.af.mil. Maintain all active, inactive and disquali-
fied (except ASC 06) aircrew member (including ARC personnel) FRFs/JRFs at the Air Force base
HARM office nearest to where the aircrew member maintains their personnel, finance, and if possible,
medical records. All records maintained by the HARM will be entered in the ARMS database. Request
exceptions to this procedure from HQ USAF/XOOT.
2.17.3. Work closely with the servicing flight medical facility to ensure immediate and accurate exchange
of flight management and flight medical data. Establish written procedures (either a memorandum of
agreement or include in supplement to this AFI) between the aircrew/parachutist member’s flight sur-
geon’s office and the HARM to ensure required documentation is received. As a minimum, this means:
AFI11-401_AFRCSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2005                                                                       161


2.17.4. Validate entitlement to flying/jump incentive pays with member’s finance office. Establish written
procedures (either a memorandum of agreement or include in supplement to this AFI) between the air-
crew/parachutist member’s finance office and the HARM to ensure required documentation is received to
validate flight/jump pay entitlement.
2.17.5. Validate personnel data changes with member’s unit orderly room. Contact the MPF to obtain a
UMD and a personnel listing to reflect member’s current assignment data. Establish written procedures
(either a memorandum of agreement or include in supplement to this AFI) between the aircrew/parachut-
ist member’s unit orderly room or personnel office and the HARM to ensure required documentation is
received. As a minimum, validate DAFSC, API, effective date of duty, unit manning position numbers
and active duty (AGR) or non-EAD status for ARC personnel.
3.1. Flight and Jump Records and Aviation Resource Management System (ARMS) Functional
Responsibility. The individual flight or jump record folders are the official source documents for deter-
mining incentive entitlement, current flying or jump status, and total experience. HARM offices will
maintain and enter in the ARMS database all aircrew/parachutist members’ FRFs/JRFs whose personnel
records are maintained by base Military Personnel Flight (MPF), Accounting Finance Office, (AFO), and
base flight surgeon office. FRFs/JRFs will be maintained by the Air Force HARM office closest to the
member’s MPF and AFO. Dispose of Air Force records in accordance with the Air Force Records Dispo-
sition Schedule (RDS), located at https://webrims.amc.af.mil, and this instruction.
3.1.2.1.3. FRFs/JRFs for disqualified aircrew or parachutists (entitlement status 0) are kept for five years
after such designation. After five consecutive years, return the FRF/JRF to the member. (EXCEPTION:
for UFT students disqualified from training and operational support fliers removed from flying for more
than one year, release the FRF to the member.)
3.3. Crediting Flight Time. Credit flying time as follows:
3.3.1. To credit flight activity, personnel must:
3.3.1.1. Be physically qualified (member cannot be in DNIF status).
3.3.1.2. Be physiologically qualified (if applicable for the aircraft).
3.3.1.3. Be on AOs to take part in frequent and regular flights as aircrew, to obtain aircrew qualification,
or as operational support members (IAW AFI 11-402).
3.3.1.4. Be under an approved aircrew qualification code (based on AF Form 8 qualification) and aircrew
position identifier (Table A2.3.) designated on a flight authorization for the aircraft.
3.3.1.5. Be part of the crew complement (AFI 65-503) authorized to perform aircrew duties in the aircraft
to obtain and maintain aircrew qualification or be required for the mission.
3.3.1.5.1. Individuals required for the mission that are not part of the crew complement may only log fly-
ing time when specifically authorized to augment the crew or perform mission-related observation or
evaluation duties. Written authorization for flight duty is required to be on file with the HARM office
prior to the mission. The commander with operational control of the aircraft will issue the authorization,
to include justification. The member’s HARM office will file the justification in the FRF to ensure a
source document is maintained to validate recording of flying time in aircraft in which the member does
not maintain qualification. Members must comply with all other applicable requirements to include med-
ical clearance and physiological training (if applicable).
162                                                          AFI11-401_AFRCSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2005


3.3.1.5.2. Non-aircrew members assigned to flying unit commander positions may log flying time in
assigned aircraft. Individuals will fly on a non-interference basis (paragraph 2.12.4.), will use crew posi-
tion “OX” (Colonel and above) or “XX” (Lt Col and below) IAW Table A2.3., and log other time on the
AFTO Form 781 for entry into ARMS.
3.3.2. Flights in any other capacity are to be considered familiarization and/or incentive orientation flights
(logging flight time on AFTO Form 781 is not authorized). Crewmembers and parachutists cannot credit
flights/jumps while on leave, permissive TDY, or nonflying/nonjumping TDY/Temporary Assignment
Duty (TAD), regardless of duration, or flying on an aircraft during point-to-point travel (not authorized or
required to perform aircrew duties). Aircrew members cannot log flying time when the purpose for flying
is to make a proficiency-sustaining jump.
3.4.1. Primary Flight Time. Time logged by a member occupying a designated duty station identified in
AFI 65-503, and actively performing the duty associated with their aircrew specialty. Only qualified air-
crew members, aircrew members obtaining qualification in the aircraft can log primary time when per-
forming in-flight duties. Non-rated aircrew members and operational support personnel who do not have
an established crew duty station will only log primary time when actually performing their in-flight duty.
For example: operating equipment or caring for medical evacuation patients.
3.4.1.1.4. Pararescue aircrew members assigned to authorized flying billets, on active flying AOs and
qualified in the MDS, who are required in addition to the normal aircrew complement to perform in-flight
duties for mass rescued aircrew member/personnel missions may log primary flight time when perform-
ing patient support duties on mass personnel recovery missions. Primary time is only authorized during
such time those in-flight duties are performed. During periods when the PJ is not performing in-flight
duties associated with the rescued members, or is non-current for that MDS, only Other flight time will be
logged.
3.4.2. Secondary Flight Time: Flight time logged by a crew member who is performing inflight duties
related to the crewmember’s specialty, but who is not controlling the function of that specialty. Except as
listed below, the total secondary time logged in each specialty may not exceed the total flight time. When
in excess to the crew complement, a remark will be placed in the remarks of the AFTO Form 781 depict-
ing the secondary duties performed by additional aircrew.
3.4.2.1. The member must be maintaining or obtaining qualification in the aircraft to log secondary time.
EXCEPTION: Crewmembers designated in AFI 65-503; and tasked to perform their primary duties on
aircraft other than their assigned aircraft (e.g., Flight Attendants tasked by TACC or HHQ to support Sil-
ver Bullet or DV missions) will log secondary time as long as crewmembers maintain currency in their
primary aircraft. The member’s aircrew certification code will reflect the current qualification. If not qual-
ified in the aircraft, the member will log “X” or “O” as the first character of the flight authorization code
IAW Attachment 2, Table A2.3.
3.4.2.3. For other aircrew specialties, log secondary time when actually performing inflight duties of the
specialty, but not at the primary duty station established for that specialty (for example, second navigator
during airdrop missions or additional PJs on AOs required to perform “in-flight duties” assisting mass air-
crew/personnel on a rescue mission) when dictated by mission requirements.
3.4.2.3.1 Annotate specific inflight duties performed and circumstances that require additional crewmem-
bers (in additional to basic crew complement) to perform the mission in the remarks section of the AFTO
Form 781.
AFI11-401_AFRCSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2005                                                                         163


3.4.2.5. Pararescue aircrew members assigned to authorized flying billets, on active flying AOs and qual-
ified in the MDS, who are required in addition to the normal aircrew complement to perform in-flight
duties for mass rescued aircrew member/personnel missions may log secondary time when performing
simulated patient duties or Mission Coordinator duties on mass personnel recovery training missions.
Secondary time is only authorized during such time those in-flight duties are performed. During periods
when the PJ is not performing “in-flight” duties associated with the rescued members or mission coordi-
nator, or non-current for that MDS, only Other flight time will be logged.
3.4.5. Other Flight Time. Flight time flown by members who are on the flight authorization, but not
occupying a designated duty station or conforming to the requirements of primary, secondary, instructor,
or evaluator time. For example: additional or extra crewmembers taking part in the flight, required for the
mission to augment the crew or perform mission-related observation or evaluator duties (not qualified in
the aircraft). Crewmembers will log other time during periods of crew rest or sleep.
3.4.6.2.1. Combat or combat support time will be logged from takeoff to landing when an individual
meets the requirements of combat/combat support flight time, is on active AOs, actively performs the
duty associated with the aircrew specialty, and is required for the mission IAW paragraph 3.3. of this
instruction. Do not combine mission symbols; use one symbol for the entire flight.
3.5. Flight Condition Time. The categories listed in paragraph 3.4. are the basis for accumulating flying
experience for all flying personnel. Record all flying time accrued on a mission in the appropriate cate-
gory. Provisions have been made to record, for historical purposes, a breakout of flight time by flight con-
dition: night, instrument, and simulated instrument. Primary time flown in more than one condition
simultaneously (for example, night and instrument) would result in entries under both of these categories
on the form. The type of time logged must be consistent with the flight condition actually encountered or
procedure accomplished. MAJCOMs may further restrict logging combinations that are inconsistent with
command policy or procedures. Use the following rules in logging flight condition time:
NOTE: DELETED.
3.5.2. Primary Instrument Time. The portion of primary, instructor, or evaluator flight time logged
when external conditions require that the aircraft attitude be maintained primarily by reference to the
flight instruments. Pilots only will log this time when performing duties in this flight condition.
NOTE: To log primary instrument time, an instructor or evaluator pilot must occupy a duty station with a
set of flight controls, but does not have to actively (hands-on) control the aircraft.
3.5.4. Night Vision Goggle Time. The portion of time logged by an aircrew member wearing night vision
goggles. Pilots, navigators, flight surgeons, and other crewmembers having NVG training requirements
specified by Air Force or MAJCOM aircrew training publications will log this time (simultaneously with
night time) when performing these duties.
3.10. Flying in Other Than Military Aircraft. Flight time logged according to paragraph 3.3. in other
than military aircraft is credited toward annual flying requirements only when directed by competent Air
Force AOs and such flying is inherent in the primary duty assignment of the person concerned. Aircrews
must document flight time on an AFTO Form 781 or AF Form 3250 and, except for CAP-USAF or
USAFA Introductory Flying Training missions, be in aircraft with 450 or more horsepower.

Aircrew. The total complement of rated (pilots, navigators, air battle managers, and flight surgeons),
career enlisted aviators (1AXXX Air Force Specialty Codes), and nonrated aircrew (K-, Q-, or X-prefixed
Air Force Specialty Code) personnel responsible for the safe ground and flight operation of the aircraft
and onboard systems, or for airborne duties essential to accomplishment of the aircraft’s mission. Includes
members in initial formal training for immediate assignment to an authorized operational flying position.
Individuals must be on aeronautical orders and assigned to an authorized position according to AFI
65-503, US Air Force Cost and Planning Factors, or nonrated aircrew not in an aircraft’s basic crew com-
AFI11-401_AFRCSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2005                                                                          165


plement, but required for the mission. Aircrew members perform their principal duties inflight and their
presence is required for the aircraft to accomplish its primary tasked mission. Duties must be essential to
operating the aircraft or mission systems and equipment used for completing a mission, or other duties
essential to the aircraft’s mission.
Mission Crew – DELETED.
Operational Support Flier--An individual whose primary, full-time duty does not require flying. The
Air Force may require these individuals to fly on an occasional basis to perform a specific, essential
inflight duty that cannot be performed by an assigned aircrew member. Duties may include, but are not
limited to inflight test, operation, or inflight maintenance of specific aircraft systems or installed equip-
ment. Operational support fliers must be placed on aeronautical orders and complete prescribed flying
hour requirements in order for them to receive non-crew hazardous duty pay; authorized man-months are
required prior to issuance of aeronautical orders.
Sortie--An AFTO Form 781 aircraft sortie begins when the aircraft begins to move forward on takeoff or
takes off vertically from rest at any point of support. It ends after airborne flight when the aircraft returns
to the surface and either of the following conditions occur: a) the engines are stopped, or the aircraft is on
the surface for five minutes, whichever occurs first; or, b) a change is made in the crew which enplanes or
deplanes a crewmember. A series of practice landings is considered one sortie; for a series of practice
landings, close out the flight after five minutes on the ground and begin a subsequent flight IAW Table
A2.1., but do not log a sortie until the final landing. For logging aircrew proficiency training, on missions
where some crewmembers deplane and the remaining crew from the original takeoff relaunch, this may be
considered to be a continuation of the original aircrew sortie. MAJCOMs may establish MDS-specific
crew requirements and procedures for aircrew continuation sorties.

ITEM     ENTER
8        International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) code for the base or airport where the
         aircraft takes off. If a flight is continued from a previous entry, enter "INFL."
9        Base ICAO code for the base or airport where the aircraft lands. If a flight is terminated
         without landing for a change in mission symbol, enter "INFL."
10       24-hour GMT clock time. The takeoff time is when the aircraft begins to move forward
         on takeoff roll.
11       24-hour GMT clock time. The landing is when the aircraft is on the ground after being
         airborne and any of the following conditions occur: (a) The engines are stopped and
         shutdown occurs at or before five minutes after touchdown. (b) The aircraft has been on
         the ground for five minutes after touchdown. (c) A change is made in the crew where a
         crewmember enplanes or deplanes. A series of practice landings is considered one
         sortie; for a series of practice landings, close out the flight after five minutes on the
         ground and begin a subsequent flight IAW item 10.
         NOTE: When a flight starts before 2400 GMT and ends after GMT midnight (2400Z),
         record and report the flight on the date of takeoff. A separate AFTO Form 781 is not
         necessary.
12       Subtract takeoff time from landing time, convert to hours and tenths, and enter the
         result. The conversion table for minutes to tenths of an hour is on the reverse of the

ITEM    ENTER
20      Flight Authorization (FA) Duty Code assigned on the FA to the crewmember for this
        mission. This code cannot be higher than the individual’s current qualification or what
        the individual crewmember will be performing on the mission. For example, if the
        individual is an IP, but is scheduled to perform MP duties on a mission, the individual
        will be listed as an MP on the Flight Authorization. Refer to Table A2.3. for a complete
        list of duty codes. NOTE: The only time the FA code will not match the scheduled
        duties on the FA is for extenuating circumstances. The AC must document the reason in
        the remarks of the AFTO Form 781. For example, a pilot was scheduled to perform IP
        duties in conjunction with upgrade training for a second pilot; however, the upgrading
        individual was DNIF and did not fly, so the pilot only performed primary duties. MP is
        logged with primary time and the AC documents the reason in the remarks section.
        When using the FA more than one day, log FA Duty Code actually performed and
        annotate in remarks if different from the FA.

OPERATIONS NOTES:
1. For the P, R, and C mission symbols, use the following third character suffixes to identify
missions flown by specific MAJCOM: AMC use A, B, C; ACC use D, E, F; USAFE use G, H, I, J;
PACAF use K, L, M; AFSOC use N, O, P; ANG use Q, R, S; and AFRC use T, U, V; AETC use W,
X, Y and AFMC use Z. Guard and Reserve units will coordinate with their gaining MAJCOM to
determine if the Guard/Reserve or active duty MAJCOM suffix will be used. MAJCOMs will
provide HQ USAF/XOOT a copy of directives on the use of these mission symbols.
2. For all missions flown in designated combat areas, make the third character an A to differentiate
those combat missions where aerial delivery/recovery of airborne forces/equipment, ordnance
expended, or direct exposure to hostile fire occurred. The suffix B is used on designated combat
missions established by HQ USAF that result in personnel tour curtailment or other personnel
actions.

NOTES: To meet OFDA, ACIP, CEFIP, or HDIP requirements, aircrew members must comply with the
following:
1. Log their flight time using both an aircrew certification code and position identifier valid to credit time
(a "yes" in column 3).
2. Log primary, secondary or instructor flight time. Evaluator flight time is also creditable when the eval-
uator is current in the aircraft. Otherwise the evaluator should use the aircrew certification code O or X.
AFI11-401_AFRCSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2005                                                                      175


3. Be attaining or maintaining qualification in the aircraft.
4. Operational support fliers must log primary time to meet the requirement for HDIP. When not per-
forming primary duties, they will log other time.
5. Inactive UAV time does not count towards OFDA and ACIP.
6. Non-interference flyers other than (flying unit commanders) must receive HQ USAF/XOOT approval
to log flying time on AFTO Form 781 and enter data into ARMS.
A3.3.6.1. Amend AOs to correct minor administrative errors (erroneous SSN, improper grade, termina-
tion date, misspelled name, etc.), if the intent of the original order is unaffected by the correction. The
amendment order should contain the original effective date and only other required identifying data
(name, grade, SSAN, and organization) and the amended data. Underline amended items. (An amendment
makes the amended order read as it should have initially.) An AF Form 1887 is the recommended medium
for amending AO because, as an automated system, ARMS automatically includes current information
that may not be applicable for the effective period of the AO being amended. Using an AF Form 1887
avoids HARM system “work-arounds” that entail entering false date into ARMS. False data may interface
with other Air Force systems and corrupt promotion or assignment processes. (NOTE following this para-
graph remains unchanged.)
A3.3.6.1.1. Each AO requiring correction must have a separate amendment.
A3.3.6.1.2. Do not publish an amendment order to another amendment order. Revoke the incorrect
amendment and publish a single correct amendment.
A3.3.6.1.3. Amending a termination date is authorized, except on an AO published to change a termina-
tion date. In this case, the AO’s intent was incorrect from the beginning. When amending an AO, docu-
ment in ink the AO number and request date of the amendment AO on the lower left-hand margin of the
original AO in the record set and FRF being amended. For example: Amended by AO #13, dated 13 Oct
03.
NOTE: HARM offices are authorized to amend other HARM offices’ AOs (provide copy to original
office).

Item 1 (AO Action)     (Initiate Aviation Service Period.) When this item is entered for rated
                       officers who were previous fliers (except flight surgeons), include in item 15
                       the total number of months of operational flying as of the effective date of
                       the order (item 18). An aviation service period is initiated for rated officers
                       and CEA’s on entry into flying training that leads to an aeronautical rating or
                       badge and at each subsequent aviation career phase point (10, 12, 15, 18, and
                       20 years aviation service).
                       (Change Aviation Service Code From.) If member had no aviation service
                       code before the date of this order, enter “NA.”
                       (Revoke/Amend.) When AF Form 1887 is used to amend or revoke a
                       previous AO indicated the action taken, and the previous AO number
                       referenced. For example: “Amend AO 444.” “Revoke AO 222,” etc.
                       Complete item 16 as required.
                       (Establish ASD.) Used for all non-rated members who enter a course of
                       instruction leading to pilot, navigator, flight surgeon, or CEA rating.
                       (Aircraft Assignment.) Used to list aircraft each member is authorized to
                       obtain and maintain qualification and log flying time for entitlement to
                       incentive pays and OFDA.
                       (Authorized Temporary Flying Duty.) Used for cadets in special training
                       status.
                       (Authorized Noninterference Flying Duty.) Used for non-rated members
                       required to perform official specific tasks (more than once) who do not meet
                       the criteria to qualify for aircrew or operational support status.
                       (Other.) Used for all other reasons. Complete item 16 as required.
                        *Delete* NOTE: HARMs are not required to publish aircraft assignment
                       AOs. For officers not assigned directly to a flying unit (for example: wing or
                       group), at a base with multi-type aircraft, a letter approving attachment for
                       flying (coordinated through unit CC, DO, or DOV) documenting the
                       member’s primary aircraft to obtain/maintain aircrew qualification is needed
                       to process or validate active AOs. Letters approving crew augmentation or
                       authorization to perform mission-related observation or evaluation duties in
                       and aircraft (s) an aircrew member is not in crew complement or obtaining/
                       maintaining qualification in must also be filed in the FRF in order to log time
                       in an aircraft (IAW paragraph 3.3.). Additionally, a letter of justification is
                       required from the member's MAJCOM to fly in non-USAF aircraft, IAW
                       paragraph 1.11.. Letter (s) if applicable must be permanently filed on the
                       left-hand side of the member's FRF. The letter will serve as the authorizing
                       aircraft assignment action for the member.

Attachment 5
INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING AF FORM 4327, ARMS FIGHTER FLIGHT AUTHORIZATION,
AND AF FORM 4327a, CREW FLIGHT AUTHORIZATION (FA)
A5.1. Purpose. Commanders will use AF Forms 4327 and 4327a to authorize the use of USAF aircraft to
perform a specific mission(s), and to authorize aircrew members to perform in-flight duties. AF Form
4327 will be used to authorize flights of fighter and similar trainer aircraft for missions that originate and
end at the same location. AF Form 4327a will be used to authorize all other aircraft missions.
A5.1.1. The FA will also be used for accountability of aircrew personnel, to validate duties performed/
logged on the AFTO Form 781, and for reimbursement of temporary duty expenses.
A5.1.2. Additional members authorized for the mission, who are not authorized to perform aircrew duties
or non-interference flying, are listed on a passenger manifest or remarks section per MAJCOM guidance.
AFI11-401_AFRCSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2005                                                                   185


A5.2. Scope. These instructions apply to all flying unit commanders with operational control of USAF
aircraft who direct the use of aircraft and aircrews in support of command operations.
A5.3. Responsibilities. The AF Form 4327 and 4327a are established by this instruction. Aviation
Resource Management personnel are responsible for publication of these forms, and performing Go/
No-Go validation (review of ARMS products and member’s AOs) for the operations officer during
pre-mission review.
A5.3.1. When additional aircrew members are added after completion of the form, the authenticating offi-
cial, aircraft commander, or flight lead must validate Go/No-Go requirements by validating ARMS train-
ing products and AOs prior to flight.
A5.3.2. The completed FA will be used during post mission review with the AFTO Form 781 to ensure all
aircrew members authorized to perform duties are documented. The aircraft commander will document
deviations between scheduled duties on the FA (Duty Position) and actual duties performed in the remarks
of the AFTO Form 781.
A5.3.3. The completed FA is normally filed with the AFTO Form 781 and other mission paperwork. The
Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) lists the minimum disposition requirements of this form.
MAJCOM supplements may require the form to be maintained longer.

1.4.2.3. Commanders will ensure a process is in place for aircrew and parachutist members and/or unit
orderly rooms to notify the base HARM office of all non-flying TDYs, projected PCS, RET, or SEP
actions. This requirement can be met by having the flying or jump unit orderly room forward copies of all
aircrew/parachutist members’ TDY, PCS, RET, or SEP orders to the base HARM to process required AO
or ARMS actions.
1.4.2.3.1. Commanders will establish procedures to ensure aircrew/parachutists pick up the FRF/JRF
from the HARM office prior to outprocessing members from their unit for PCS assignments.
1.4.2.3.2. Commanders will establish procedures to ensure aircrew/parachutist members and/or unit
orderly rooms notify the HARM office prior to a PCA action to another unit, so HARM office personnel
can accomplish any necessary AO or ARMS actions.
1.5.2.1. Certification is acknowledgement by the member that the flying/jump data is correct. Information
maintained in the FRF or JRF will not be changed without official source documentation. For example an
AFTO Form 781 or AF Form 3520 for missing flights and sorties, AETC Form 240-5 for student hours,
an AF Form 922 or AF Form 4323 for missing jumps, Military ID or re-enlistment paperwork for date of
separation change and personnel data that did not interface to ARMS, etc. In the absence of source docu-
ments, the member may submit a DD Form 149 to the Air Force Board for Corrections to Military
Records (AFBCMR) IAW Air Force Pamphlet 36-2607, Applicant’s Guide to the Air Force Board for
192                                                        AFI11-401_AFRCSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2005


Correction of Military Records (AFBCMR). HARMs must ensure all flying hour corrections (especially to
career totals) are accounted for by a source document. A copy of the DD Form 149 or flying hour log
book or letter (submitted under previous Air Force policy) must be filed on the left side of the FRF IAW
AFI 11-421, Aviation Resource Management.
1.5.2.2. Inactive aircrew/jump personnel must accomplish a records review within 120 days prior to
departure and not later than 120 days following their arrival at a new duty station. They are not required
to accomplish annual reviews of their FRF/JRF.
1.5.4. Pick up the Flight Evaluation Folder (FEF), Flying History Report (FHR), FRF or JRF before
departing for PCS or flying/jumping TDY (ref. para 3.1.4.1.). Members must ensure they have a current
copy of AO, IDS, ARMS training summary, and AF Form 142, Aviation Service Audit Worksheet, prior
to departure on a jump/flying TDY. Members initiating parachutist status, scheduled to attend jump
school, must give the HARM office a copy of their TDY orders at least 5 work-days prior to TDY, to
allow processing of the initial AO authorizing jump status.
1.5.5. Turn in the FRF or JRF to the proper HARM office (or notify the HARM office that the record was
mailed) within 10 duty-days after arriving at a new duty station (includes flying TDY). FRF/JRF must be
reviewed by the member within 30 days after arrival at a new permanent duty station. Inactive aircrew
members must also turn in the FRF and Flight Evaluation Folder (FEF) within 10 duty days. If a member
does not turn in the FRF within the 10 workday limit, aviation career incentive pay (ACIP), career
enlisted flyer incentive pay (CEFIP), or hazardous duty incentive pay (HDIP) will be suspended (via a
Military Pay Order [MPO]) until receipt of the FRF for validation of qualification. HARMs will consider
mailed records as “turned in” and will not suspend incentive pay on these members. HARMs will make
every effort to contact the member prior to stopping incentive pay. HARMs will ensure FRF/JRFs are
inprocessed to the ARMS database NLT 10 days after receipt of the records.
1.5.5.1. Fliers assigned to an inactive API code/duty position (after an active flying assignment) will turn
in their FEF to the HARM office within five duty days of assignment to an inactive API code/flying posi-
tion (i.e. API-6 flyer is placed in an API-3 position, etc.). The HARM office will file the FEF inside the
member's FRF. If the member returns to active flying status, forward the FEF to the member's flying unit.
1.5.8. Members will sign out their AF Form 702, Individual Physiological Training Record (original),
and AF Form 1042, Medical Recommendation for Flying or Special Operational Duty (copy) from
the HARM office prior to attending physiological/centrifuge training. Upon completion of training, return
forms to the HARM office within 5 duty days after arrival at home station.
1.5.9. Provide the SARM office a copy of TDY orders at least 5 days prior to departure (when possible).
1.5.9.1. Squadron Aviation Resource Management, Tenant Aviation Resource Management offices, or
flight medicine elements will establish procedures to notify HARM offices for aircrew/parachutists mem-
bers assigned to their units to validate deployments to support flying operations and non-fly/jump TDYs
(in lieu of sending TDY orders). The HARM office will use the TDY notification to ensure no flight/jump
credit is authorized for non-flying/jumping TDY assignments (including Air Force Educational Leave of
Absence, other academic classes, and other non-fly/jump TDYs) and to note that a member may have
flight time pending turn in which may affect pay entitlements.
1.5.9.2. Inactive aircrew members will notify the HARM office at least 10 days prior to departing on an
authorized flying TDY (includes requalification courses).
AFI11-401_AFRCSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2005                                                                         193


1.5.9.3. HARMs/SARMs will establish procedures to validate flights/jumps performed during non-fly-
ing-jumping TDY are not counted toward ACIP, CEFIP, or HDIP flight/jump requirements.
1.5.10. When permanently changing station or unit of assignment, ensure sign-out from unit/base does not
negatively affect OFDA credit. Aircrew members permanently changing station or unit of assignment
require 15 days or more on active flying status for that month for valid AOs and to receive credit towards
OFDA totals.
1.5.10.1. Aircrew members assigned to an active flying billet who are being reassigned to an inactive bil-
let should make every effort to outprocess their unit/base after the 15th of the month to provide an oppor-
tunity to obtain the last month of OFDA credit (if flight requirements are also met).
1.5.10.2. Aircrew members assigned to an inactive billet who are being reassigned to an active billet
should outprocess their unit/base before the 15th of the month to provide an opportunity to obtain OFDA
credit for the first month of assignment (if flight requirements are also met).
1.6.2.1. Military aircrew members who are properly qualified, meet the criteria of this instruction and AFI
11-402 for initiating aviation service, and are directed to perform specific inflight duties on a frequent and
regular basis, will be placed on AOs and a flight authorization.
1.6.2.1.1. Members not listed in an AFI 65-503 crew complement, who are not obtaining or maintaining
aircraft qualification, and who do not have current aircraft AOs, may be authorized to fly IAW paragraph
3.3. of this instruction when required for the mission. Written authorization for flight duty must be pro-
vided to the HARM office.
1.6.2.1.1.1. If the member obtains qualification in the aircraft while TDY, and aircraft AOs cannot be pro-
cessed prior to the flight, the flying unit commander or flying unit flight authorization authenticating offi-
cial may issue a verbal order IAW paragraph A3.3.1.2. of this instruction, authorizing the flight. The
member will log the appropriate aircrew certification code (first character) and primary, secondary, or
appropriate time applicable to the inflight duty performed.
1.6.2.1.1.2. If the member does not obtain qualification in the aircraft, the member may log “O” or “X”
aircrew certification code (first character) and other time only.
1.6.2.2. Members who are properly qualified and directed to perform specific inflight non-interference
duties will be placed on AOs and the flight authorization but will not be placed on the AFTO Form 781,
ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document. Refer to paragraph 2.12.4. for additional guidance.
1.6.2.3. Military members not on AOs, and not required to perform duties or obtain and maintain qualifi-
cation in the aircraft, must fly in passenger status, will be placed on a passenger manifest, and must fly on
commercial or military aircraft with adequate facilities for transporting passengers. Refer to paragraphs
1.9.4.7.1., 2.12.5., and applicable MDS-Specific guidance for further passenger guidance/restrictions.
1.6.2.4. Commanders (including unit commanders) may detail (by written orders) personnel under their
command to take part in aircraft flights operated by any foreign government accredited by the United
States, provided the flights do not add additional expense to the US Government, and provided personnel
are on AOs that require them to take part in frequent and regular flights.
1.6.2.5. Military members not authorized AOs (as specified above) tasked to perform unique ground sup-
port duties directly related and essential to the particular aircraft or mission being flown, e.g., a mainte-
nance specialist required to perform routine maintenance or a security team required to guard the aircraft
at enroute or destination stops, may fly as Mission Essential Ground Personnel (MEGP) as defined by
194                                                       AFI11-401_AFRCSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2005


MAJCOMs in MAJCOM supplements to this instruction. See paragraphs 1.8.4.2. and 1.12.2.2. for addi-
tional guidance.
1.6.2.5.1. The OG/CC (or equivalent) with operational control of the mission being flown authorizes
MEGP status. MEGP may only fly on aircraft capable of carrying passengers IAW the provisions of DoD
4515.13-R. EXCEPTION: Under exceptional conditions (e.g. national emergency, severe weather, earth-
quake, flood) MEGP may be flown on non-passenger carrying aircraft if their duties are essential to the
maintenance of the aircraft at the recovery base. All steps should be taken to pre-deploy these personnel
via other means of transportation, if adequate time permits.
1.6.2.6. MAJCOMs may designate aircrew members to travel in Additional Crewmember (ACM) status.
ACMs will be defined by MAJCOMs in MAJCOM supplements to this instruction. See paragraphs
1.8.4.2. and 1.12.2.2. for additional guidance.
1.6.2.6.1. The OG/CC (or equivalent) with operational control of the mission being flown grants ACM
status. ACM may only fly on aircraft capable of carrying passengers IAW provisions of DoD 4515.13-R.
1.8.1. Prior to all flights in Air Force aircraft, commanders (including unit commanders) issue written
authorizations documenting all crewmembers required to perform inflight duties on the mission. Units
will use AF Form 4327, ARMS Fighter Flight Authorization, or AF Form 4327a, Crew Flight Autho-
rization, as applicable to the unit aircraft. A commander's (including unit commanders) verbal authoriza-
tion may direct aircraft flight only when time constraints or administrative procedures prevent written
authorization. Written confirmation of this order must be issued within three duty-days. Once a Flight
Authorization (FA) has been signed, changes must be validated by a designated approving authority by
placing the approving authority's initials by the line changed. The commander with operational control of
the mission is responsible for the publication/maintenance/retention of the aircraft FAs for each mission
flown by the aircraft. Only commissioned officers are authorized to be authenticating officials for Flight
Authorizations.
EXCEPTION: Aeromedical (AE) and Pararescue (PJ) unit commanders with aircrew members may
accomplish a FA for assigned aircrew members that are required to perform aircrew duties on the mission.
Commanders must ensure all members listed meet go-no-go criteria prior to authenticating the FA. The
FA is not a stand alone document and must be attached to the aircraft FA for the mission on which aircrew
members were required to perform in-flight duties. If the AE or PJ crew is scheduled to perform aircrew
duties on more than one mission, a remark will be placed on the FA to depict variations. As a minimum,
the information in blocks 11 through 18 must be documented on the flight authorization. In the Remarks
section of the aircraft FA, annotate the AE/pararescue FA number, date, and unit designation. The FA is a
critical document used to validate aircrew member’s duties/flight time logged on the AFTO Form 781.
1.8.1.1. Validation of go-no-go qualification must be accomplished IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 2, Aircrew Stan-
dardization/Evaluation Program, prior to authorizing members to participate in aircrew or operational
support duties. Once a FA has been published, the pilot in command is responsible for validating go-no-go
status for additional aircrew or operational support members prior to authorizing them to fly and adding
or attaching them to the flight authorization. Validation may include ARMS products IAW AFI 11-421 (or
comparable database for USAFA airmanship programs), a flight authorization from an AE or Pararescue
unit commander (or designated representative), or a letter from the member's unit validating the individ-
ual's qualification to fly on required missions.
NOTE: When preparing flight authorizations for flying on future dates, the 1C0X2 or designated repre-
sentative (responsible for go-no-go validation) must confirm the member's aeronautical order status, cur-
AFI11-401_AFRCSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2005                                                                         195


rency (to include flight physical and physiological training), and qualification will remain valid through
those future dates. Once the FA is published, if the pilot in command is not available, the FA authenticat-
ing official may validate go-no-go status.
1.8.3. The flight authorization must include (minimum requirements):
1.8.3.1. A designated pilot-in-command, or formation flight leader of each flight or flight element.
1.8.3.2. Name, grade, and flight authorization duty code (Table A2.3.) of each crewmember, operational
support flier, or any other official personnel (use the position designation established by the MAJCOM)
required for the mission or flight.
1.8.3.3. Type, serial number, and call sign of aircraft or formation and mission symbol.
1.8.3.4. Place from which the flight will depart plus "on-or-about" departure date.
1.8.3.5. An itinerary and the phrase "Variations in itinerary authorized."
1.8.3.6. Provisions of AFI 65-103, Temporary Duty Orders, apply to temporary duty performed incidental
to authorized flights. Include a statement to this effect on the flight authorization.
1.8.4. Flight authorizations will only include personnel on AOs (or contract aircrew personnel on a mem-
orandum of agreement/contract) authorized to perform in-flight duties for that mission according to para-
graphs 1.10. and 3.3. of this instruction. Except for non-interference members, individuals on the flight
authorization should match those authorized to log time on the AFTO Form 781, ARMS Aircrew/Mis-
sion Flight Data Extract.
1.8.4.1. Personnel who are on the aircraft for point-to-point travel, an orientation/familiarization flight or
to only perform a proficiency jump (not performing aircrew duties for that mission) will be listed on the
passenger manifest. For fighter-type aircraft, when a passenger manifest is not prepared, list individuals in
the Remarks section of the Flight Authorization.
1.8.4.2. If ACMs or MEGPs are transported, IAW MAJCOM supplements, they may be listed on the
flight authorization in the Remarks section (only). ACMs or MEGPs will not be listed on the AFTO Form
781, will not log time, and will not accrue OFDA credit.
1.9.4.7.2. MAJCOMs, ANG, FOAs, and DRUs will administer this program according to DoD 4515.13-R
and the above guidelines. Secretary of Defense moratorium, “Civilian Visitors Operating Military Equip-
ment” (22 Feb 01), and CSAF memorandum, “Air Force Policy on Civilian Visitors Operating Military
Equipment” (20 Jul 01), apply. For approval authorities in Table 1.1., ANG will use equivalent positions,
as appropriate.

NOTES:
1. “Orientation flights” are defined as continuous flights performed within the local flying area and termi-
nating at the point of origin (DoD 4515.13-R, Chapter 4). “Note 1 N/A,” means the category of flight is
not considered an orientation flight; however, it is included in the table as a consolidated reference source.
2. Requests for point-to-point travel must be specifically addressed and approved by SECAF. Retiring
members of Congress and retiring congressional staff members may be flown on orientation flights only
upon the written approval of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Legislative Affairs (ASD[LA]). (Ref.
DSD Memo, 23 Dec 1996.)
3. When aircraft are “chopped” or assigned to a gaining Combatant Commander, approval authority will
be the Commander Air Force Forces (COMAFFOR) or Theater Special Operations Command (SOC)
commander.
4. The USAFA Superintendent is the approval authority for USAFA aircraft flights.
5. Inform AF/CC/XO/XOO, if approved.
6. lights involving foreign nationals must be reviewed for foreign disclosure requirements and political
concerns. Foreign government officials are equivalent to US Federal government officials and do not
include local government officials such as mayors, police chiefs, and other local officials who do not rep-
resent a foreign government at the national level. Foreign military "civilian equivalents" are comparable
to DoD "civilian equivalents ."
a. Ensure foreign disclosure requirements and base visit requests are satisfied according to AFI 16-201,
Disclosure of Military Information to Foreign Governments and International Organizations.
b. Coordinate with the country director in the appropriate SAF/IA regional division (three-letter level),
before approval, to ensure no political concerns that would prevent the flight.
7. This authorization does not include transportation to or from the exercise area or supporting flights uti-
lized for logistics purposes only.
8. Does not include spouses of government personnel, non-DoD Federal officials, or members of Con-
gress and their staffs.
9. 34 TRW/CC is approval authority for USAFA.
10. For foreign students enrolled in USAF Academy or ROTC programs, ensure foreign disclosure
requirements (AFI 16-201) concerning visit authorizations and disclosure of USAF information are satis-
fied.
11. This is not intended to allow all Government contractor employees to fly. The contractors must be per-
forming work in direct support of the approving command (aircrew training system and aircraft main-
tenance contractors are the most frequent participants). Normally, the requirement for familiarization
flights should be specified in the government contract.
12. For public affairs flight purposes, a local flight is a continuous flight originating and ending at the
same location aboard aircraft assigned to that location. For aircraft permanently assigned to one location,
but temporarily deployed to another location, the commander with operational control of the aircraft at the
deployed location may approve local orientation flights at the deployed location, IAW the provisions of
this AFI and this Table.
AFI11-401_AFRCSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2005                                                                     199


13. For public affairs flight purposes, a non-local flight is a flight from one location to another
(point-to-point flight).
14. Foreign citizens are not included in DoD 4515.13-R as passengers eligible for orientation flights.
"Civic leaders" applies to U.S. civic leaders. See line 25. AF/CV approval is required. (Note 6 applies to
flights involving foreign nationals.)
15. For youth in Congressionally sanctioned, DoD-approved Youth Programs, program participants may
take part in no more than one orientation flight (Ref DoD 4515.13-R, Chapter 4). Parental and/or guardian
permission is required and the flight must be approved by SAF/PA. Specific Public Law guidance applies,
including Title 10 United States Code (USC), Section 2012, and Title 32 USC, Section 508.
16. Passengers on orientation flights under 18 years of age require parental approval in writing.
17. Travel, which is designed to improve relations, increase good will, or serve humanitarian purposes,
does not meet the criteria.
18. Requests for exception to policy must be submitted through command channels according to DoD
4515.13-R, Chapter 10, and AFI 24-101. NOTE: Exception to policy authority delegated from CSAF to
AF/CV IAW AFI 24-101.
19. Cadets and midshipmen are authorized orientation flights while on leave status.
20. Aircrew members in suspended (ASC 04) or DNIF status are not authorized familiarization/orienta-
tion or incentive flights without an approved waiver from HQ USAF/XOOT.

1.10.1.1. Qualified members of US military services who hold a current aeronautical rating or aeronauti-
cal badge, are on active AOs (including aircraft AOs) to take part in frequent and regular flights, and are
within the authorized crew complement (AFI 65-503) for the aircraft or required for the mission. Aircrew
members will perform duty associated with their current aeronautical rating and aircrew qualification.
Flying solely for the purpose of qualifying for incentive pay or Operational Flying Duty Accumulator
(OFDA) credit is not authorized. Documentation for those individuals not in the crew complement or not
on aircraft AOs for the specific aircraft must be on file in the member’s FRF IAW paragraph 3.3. prior to
authorizing such duties. The SARM/TARM office will keep a copy of member’s military service current
AOs, including aircraft AOs, on file.
1.10.1.2. Qualified non-rated officers and enlisted personnel of US military services who are on AOs
(including aircraft AOs), are required to perform mission essential inflight duties on a full time basis, and
are within the authorized crew complement (AFI 65-503) for the aircraft or required for the mission. Air-
crew members will perform duty associated with their current aircrew specialty and aircrew qualification.
Flying solely for the purpose of qualifying for incentive pay is not authorized. Documentation for those
individuals not in the crew complement or not on aircraft AOs for the specific aircraft must be on file in
the member’s FRF IAW paragraph 3.3. prior to authorizing such duties. The SARM/TARM office will
keep a copy of member’s military service current AOs, including aircraft AOs, on file.
1.12.2. At no time will an individual who is not fully qualified in the specific type aircraft being flown
occupy any pilot’s seat (with a set of controls) with passengers on board the aircraft. For general officer
flying, waiver authority to this guidance is AF/CC, IAW AF/CV msg 091724Z Apr 04. (NOTE: This
message specifically precludes unqualified general officers from flying in the seat on aircraft deliveries
when passengers are on board the aircraft.) EXCEPTIONS:
1.12.2.2. In order to accommodate training objectives or mission requirements, pilots (including non-cur-
rent or unqualified pilots) who are authorized to obtain and maintain qualification in a particular MDS air-
craft may occupy a pilot's seat for purposes of conducting training or accomplishing mission requirements
when ACMs or MEGP are on board the aircraft.
1.12.2.2.1. During such times, if the pilot is non-current or unqualified, a current and qualified instructor
pilot will occupy the other pilot's seat.
1.12.2.2.2. Pilots who are not authorized to obtain or maintain aircraft qualification will not occupy a seat
with a set of controls with passengers, ACMs, or MEGP on board.

NOTES:
1. The FSC indicates if a member is assigned to an active or inactive flying position and the reason for
inactivity. Rated members assigned to mandatory rated flying duties must fly in an active status if other-
wise qualified. If the unit commander determines that no flying support capability exists for these officers,
assign them an inactive FSC. All rated aircrew members assigned to non-flying duties or non-rated flying
are restricted from active rated flying. MAJCOMs assign support-flying priorities according to paragraph
2.8. when adequate resources are lacking.
2. ARMS automatically generates an FSC change for ASC G; no AO is required.
3. Do not process non-performance AOs for rated officers after 18 years of aviation service or CEAs after
20 years of aviation service. Refer to AFIs 11-202, Vol 1, and 11-402 flying/aircrew evaluation board
requirement procedures, for members assigned to active flying positions who do not fly for extended peri-
ods for reasons within their control.
4. HARM offices will process an AO to assign FSC P or R effective the date of the separation or retire-
ment orders, update ARMS, and terminate flight pay (if applicable).
5. When nonrated/non-CEA members are assigned to a dual-coded flying/jump position, assign FSC D.
When no longer assigned to the dual-coded jump/flying position, change the member's FSC from D to J.
When a member is re-assigned from a dual-coded position to a jump DAFSC (or J prefixed position) only,
change the member's FSC to E.
2.4. Aviation Service Code (ASC) and Flying Activity Code (FAC) Effective Dates.
NOTE: HARM offices must verify UMD information to document that aircrew/parachutists are assigned
to an authorized flying/jump position prior to publishing AOs.
2.4.1.7. For officers required to perform air battle staff, airborne emergency actions officer, combat rescue
officer, mission crew commander, AVO, IIO, or other duties that do not fall under the operational support
program, use the effective and termination dates of the duty orders to authorize FAC 8. FAC 8 terminates
upon completion of flying duties. Process HDIP IAW AFI 11-421 for the duty period (if otherwise quali-
AFI11-401_AFRCSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2005                                                                       205


fied); OFDA and ACIP are not authorized for these duties. For rated officer, ASC remains unchanged; for
non-rated officer, assign ASC 9C.
2.4.1.13. Operational Support Members. Use the effective date authorized (IAW AFI 11-402) when
man-months are authorized, not to exceed a one-month period.
2.5. Transition Status Codes (TSC). TSCs allow the HARM office to track the OFDA requirements for
rated officers, after the Air Force transitioned from the Aviation Career Incentive Act of 1974 to the Avia-
tion Career Improvement Act of 1989 and the FY 1996 National Defense Authorization Act. TSCs became
effective on 1 Oct 1991 and remained in effect until 1 Oct 2003 (guidance may apply to certain fliers and
is retained in AFI). Table 2.7. defines the TSCs and Table 2.8. shows OFDA gate requirements.
2.10.4. Critical Care Air Transport Team (CCATT) Procedures. Both active and inactive flight surgeons
may be tasked to assist CCATTs with patients on a mission.
2.10.4.1. Active flight surgeons assigned to API 5 positions, with ASC 8A on current aircraft AOs, are
authorized to log crew position "FS" and primary time on all USAF aircraft missions based on their air-
craft qualification.
2.10.4.2. Inactive flight surgeons assigned to API 0 positions, in ASC 8J and tasked to perform CCATT
non-crew duties, are authorized to log "FZ" crew position and primary time on these missions. When
authorized, the member's HARM office will process the operational support AO. Assign FAC 8, and
include AO remarks: "Rated officer tasked to perform CCATT non-crew FAC 8 duties. Crew position FZ
and non-crew HDIP authorized." The member's ASC remains ASC 8J.
2.12.4. Other non-rated members who fly occasionally to perform specific tasks (e.g., administrative
duties, evaluation of equipment, maintenance, passenger escort, security for classified documents, crew
chiefs who perform duties on the ground at the final destination or points enroute and other duties not
authorized as operational support IAW AFI 11-402) may have AOs published according to this instruction
and MAJCOM directives. Members who fly occasionally to obtain familiarity with the flying environ-
ment or directed to perform specific inflight duties on an infrequent or irregular basis (Commanders
[including unit commanders], Operations Officers, and supervisory personnel) may do so under the guide-
lines of paragraph 1.6. Individuals in these categories will fly on a non-interference basis; neither flying
incentive pays nor OFDA credit are authorized; and flying is restricted to aircraft with adequate facilities
for transporting passengers (reference DoD 4515.13-R, which restricts passenger travel in aircraft, such
as, but not limited to, fighter aircraft, which are not designed or normally configured for passenger carry-
ing capability). Paragraphs 2.16.3. and 2.16.5. apply. EXCEPTION: Members who fly on non-interfer-
ence AOs will not be placed on the AFTO Form 781 (see paragraph 1.6.2.2.).
NOTE: The frequency a member is required to perform in-flight tasks must be considered when com-
manders request AOs for non-interference fliers. Non-interference fliers who are not on AOs will be listed
on the passenger manifest.

2.17.2. Maintain all FRFs/JRFs according to this instruction, AFI 11-410, Personnel Parachute Opera-
tions, AFI 11-421, Aviation Resource Management, AFPD 37-1, Information Management, AFMAN
37-123, Management of Records, and dispose of records in accordance with the Air Force Records Dispo-
sition Schedule (RDS), located at https://webrims.amc.af.mil. Maintain all active, inactive and disquali-
fied (except ASC 06) aircrew member (including ARC personnel) FRFs/JRFs at the HARM office nearest
to where the aircrew member maintains personnel, finance, and if possible, medical records. To ensure
proper aviation or parachutist incentive pay validation and prevent interruptions in the MilPDS to ARMS
interface, FRF/JRF management will not change for TDY periods of less than 90 days. (EXCEPTION:
Personnel attending formal flying courses within AETC will follow the guidelines established by Educa-
tion & Training Course Announcement (ETCA) located at https://etca.randolph.af.mil for FRF/JRF
management. For other formal courses where the member will accomplish flight/jump activity, ensure the
TDY unit is provided an electronic copy of the member’s FRF/JRF.) All records maintained by the
HARM office will be entered in the ARMS database. If the member’s personnel and finance records are
maintained at different locations, the HARM office located nearest to where the finance records are main-
tained will manage the member’s FRF. Request exceptions to this procedure from HQ USAF/XOOT.
3.1.2.1. The HARM office, supported by the standard ARMS, keeps FRFs/JRFs for all flying (active and
inactive) and jump personnel in the assigned HARM code established for that base. The Standard Systems
Group ARMS program manager will allocate one ARMS database code per base. The HARM Office must
be located in a securable area so that when HARM personnel are not present integrity of privacy act mate-
rial is properly maintained.
3.1.3. Initiate a Military Pay Order (MPO) (except for non-USAF members) within 5 work days when:
3.1.4.4. MAJCOMs will establish temporary sign-out procedures.
NOTE: HARM office personnel will not release the FRF/JRF to a member in suspended status.
3.3.1.5. Be part of the crew complement (AFI 65-503) authorized to perform aircrew duties in the aircraft
in order to obtain and maintain aircrew qualification, or be required for the mission.
3.3.1.5.1. Individuals required for the mission who are not part of the crew complement may log flying
time only when specifically authorized (e.g. AEs, CROs, PJs, combat camera, etc., required for the mis-
sion), or perform mission-related observation or evaluation duties. Except as noted in paragraph 3.4.1.6.,
written authorization for flight duty is required to be on file with the HARM office prior to the mission.
The unit commander with operational control of the mission or the flying unit flight authorization authen-
ticating official will issue the authorization, to include justification. (See Attachment 6 for example.
Contact SARM office for assistance with letter.) The mission requirement letter will be permanently filed
in the member’s FRF, as a source document to validate flying time logged. Members must comply with all
other applicable requirements to include medical clearance and physiological training (if applicable).
3.3.1.5.1.1. Members who do not have a specific aircraft listed on their current aircraft AOs, but who have
completed qualification requirements for that specific aircraft and are tasked to perform operational flying
duties in the specific aircraft, must provide to the HARM office a source document that authorizes the
member to perform inflight duties in the aircraft specified. A verbal order is authorized IAW paragraphs
1.6.2.1.1. and A3.3.1.2., but must be followed up with a written letter to the member’s servicing HARM
office within three duty-days. This letter is the source document for logging operational flying time on an
aircraft (in lieu of an aircraft AO) on an infrequent basis.
AFI11-401_AFRCSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2005                                                                         209


NOTE: Commanders must process an aircraft AO request IAW AFI 11-402, to add aircraft to the mem-
ber’s current operational aircraft authorization, for aircrew members obtaining and maintaining additional
aircraft qualification.
3.4.1.6. Nonrated aircrew members and flight surgeons on active flying AOs, who are qualified in specific
aircraft, but tasked to perform in-flight aircrew duties for a real-world mission in an aircraft in which they
are not current and qualified, are authorized to log aircrew certification code (first character of crew posi-
tion) "F" and primary time for that mission. Verbal orders of the unit commander may authorize such
duties; however, a letter from the unit commander with operational control of the mission or the flying
unit flight authorization authenticating official (See Attachment 6) must be provided to the member's ser-
vicing HARM office within three duty-days for filing in the member's FRF, validating the requirement
IAW paragraph 3.3..
3.4.1.6.1. The mission requirement letter (for real world missions) must include the statement, "The ver-
bal orders of the commander on (date) are confirmed; circumstances prevented written orders in
advance." Include a statement in the remarks section of the AFTO Form 781 validating the real-world
mission tasking and verifying that the member completed emergency egress training for that aircraft prior
to flight. This does not establish qualification for the aircraft unless all applicable qualification require-
ments have been accomplished as specified in applicable publications.
NOTE: For deployed operations every attempt should be made to submit the mission requirement letter
and AFTO Form 781 to the aircrew member’s servicing HARM office within seven duty-days.
3.4.3. Instructor Flight Time. Flight time logged by a designated and qualified instructor while actively
performing authorized instructional duties. (Includes "hands on" time during demonstration activities that
are part of instructional duties.) The instructor does not have to be occupying a primary duty station estab-
lished for that specialty but must be actually performing instructor duties. Except as provided for in AFI
65-503, the total instructor flight time for each aircrew specialty may not exceed the total flight time.
3.4.6.2.1. Combat or combat support time will be logged from takeoff to landing when an individual
meets the requirements of combat/combat support flight time, is on an active AO, is on the flight authori-
zation authorized to perform in-flight aircrew duties, and is required for the mission IAW paragraph 3.3.
of this instruction. Do not combine mission symbols; use one symbol for the entire flight.
3.5.1. Night Time. That portion of primary, secondary, instructor, or evaluator flight time logged between
the end of evening civil twilight and the beginning of morning civil twilight, as published in the American
Air Almanac. Crewmembers having night requirements (includes wear of NVG) specified by Air Force or
MAJCOM publications will log this time. For personnel assigned at latitudes above 60 degrees north
(May through August) or below 60 degrees south (November through February), night requirements are
waived when removal from active flying or PCS occurs during the summer months.
3.5.4. Night Vision Goggle Time. The portion of flight time logged by an aircrew member wearing night
vision goggles between the end of evening civil twilight and the beginning of morning civil twilight, as
published in the American Air Almanac. Crewmembers performing aircrew duties in a crew position with
NVG requirements will log this time while wearing NVGs. NVG time may also be logged by flight sur-
geons and aircrew members instructing or evaluating individuals who are performing crew duties where
NVGs are required and worn. NVG time will not exceed total night time logged.
3.10. Flying in Other Than Military Aircraft. Flight time logged according to paragraph 3.3. in other
than military aircraft is credited toward annual flying requirements only when directed by competent Air
Force AOs and such flying is inherent in the primary duty assignment of the person concerned. Aircrews
210                                                      AFI11-401_AFRCSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2005


must document flight time on an AFTO Form 781 or AF Form 3250 and, except for CAP-USAF or Intro-
ductory Flying Training missions, be in aircraft with 450 or more horsepower.

Terms
Additional Crewmember (ACM) —Aircrew members not required for a particular mission being flown,
but who are required for follow-on missions. ACMs are further defined by MAJCOMs in MAJCOM sup-
plements to this instruction. The OG/CC (or equivalent) with operational control of the mission being
flown grants ACM status. ACMs are passengers and may only fly on aircraft capable of carrying passen-
gers IAW the provisions of DoD 4515.13-R.
Aircrew—The total complement of rated (pilots, navigators, air battle managers, and flight surgeons),
career enlisted aviators (1AXXX Air Force Specialty Codes), and nonrated aircrew (K-, Q-, or X-prefixed
Air Force Specialty Code) personnel responsible for the safe ground and flight operation of the aircraft
and onboard systems, or for airborne duties essential to accomplishment of the aircraft’s mission. Includes
members in initial formal training for immediate assignment to an authorized operational flying position.
Individuals must be on aeronautical orders and assigned to an authorized position according to AFI
65-503, US Air Force Cost and Planning Factors, or nonrated aircrew not in an aircraft’s basic crew com-
plement, but required for the mission. Aircrew members perform their principal duties inflight and their
presence is required for the aircraft to accomplish its primary tasked mission. Duties must be essential to
operating the aircraft or mission systems and equipment used for completing a mission, or other duties
essential to the aircraft’s mission.
NOTE: US Air Force Academy (USAFA)/Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (AFROTC)
cadets enrolled in approved USAFA flying programs are accorded aircrew status while actively partici-
pating in such programs. Cadets will be placed on aeronautical orders authorizing USAFA Airmanship
Program flying status and will not be added in the operational ARMS database. An Aviation Service
Code (ASC) will not be assigned and an Aviation Service Date (ASD) will not be established. Neither
flying incentive pay nor flying duty credit are authorized.
Air Force Aircraft—US Government aircraft under US Air Force jurisdiction.
Authentication—The process that makes an administrative order official. Evidenced by proper signature
or seal that a document is genuine and official. The only seal authorized on AOs is on Department of the
Air Force (DAF) orders (For example: A DAF order that the CSAF awarded a pilot rating).
Authorized Aircrews—Aircrews authorized according to AFI 65-503, USAF Cost and Planning Fac-
tors, Attachment A36-1 (Authorized Aircrew Composition Active Forces), Attachment A37-1 (Autho-
rized Aircrew Composition Reserve Forces), and Attachment A38-1, (Authorized Aircrew Composition
Guard Forces).
AFI11-401_AFRCSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2005                                                                         215


Aviation Career Incentive Pay (ACIP)—Incentive pay for rated officers in an aviation career as autho-
rized in the Aviation Career Incentive Act of 1974, the Aviation Career Improvement Act of 1989, and the
FY 96 National Defense Authorization Act.
Aviation Service Date (ASD)—Effective date of the first aeronautical order to perform flight duties. For
rated officers, this date is set when the member first reports to the aviation activity that has aircraft in
which he or she will receive flight training leading to an aeronautical rating and is placed on aeronautical
orders (for example, class start date of SUPT, SUNT, or UPT-H class or Weapons Systems Training) or
date of commission, whichever is later. For flight surgeons, the ASD equals the date all requirements for
the flight surgeon rating were met, which is normally the date Course 50BY9351 or equivalent was com-
pleted. (EXCEPTION: The ASD for medical students who have completed Course 50BY9351 will be the
date post graduate medical training is completed, an unrestricted medical license is attained, AFSC 48XX
is awarded, and flight surgeon rating is assigned. All requirements must be accomplished for award of the
ASD.) For Air Battle Managers, the ASD is the date the crewmember enters formal ABM flying training
(class start date). For career enlisted aviators, the ASD is set when the member first reports to the aviation
activity that has aircraft in which he or she will receive flight training leading to career enlisted aviator
status and is placed on aeronautical orders. Rated ASDs and CEA ASDs are established separately. See
also AFI 11-402.
Career Enlisted Aviator (CEA)—Personnel in AFSCs 1AXXX and 8A000.
Career Enlisted Flier Incentive Pay (CEFIP)—Incentive pay for career enlisted aviators in an aviation
career as authorized in the FY 00 NDAA.
Civil Air Patrol - United States Air Force (CAP-USAF)—CAP-USAF is the Air Force agency that
coordinates or approves use of the Civil Air Patrol to carry out non-combat missions of the Air Force
(IAW AFI 10-2701).
Commander—When used in this instruction, "commander" refers to a wing commander (or comparable
level), or any level higher within the chain of command, of a flying unit to which an individual is assigned
or attached for flying. If an individual is geographically separated from the wing, authority may be dele-
gated to a group or squadron level.
Conditional Entitlement—The requirement for any aircrew member in an aviation status or career to
meet monthly flight requirements to receive ACIP, CEFIP, and HDIP.
Continuation Training—The continuation training program provides crew members with the volume,
frequency, and mix of training (flying and ground training) necessary to maintain proficiency in the
assigned qualification level. This training must be maintained in the ARMS database.
Continuous Entitlement—The condition under which rated officers and career enlisted aviators in an
aviation career are entitled to receive ACIP or CEFIP without regard to flight activity.
Flight—For the purpose of this instruction only, a flight is synonymous with a mission.
Flight Authorization (FA)—A single document used to identify all aircrew, operational support, and
authorized non-interference members on AOs, who are qualified and authorized to perform duties on spe-
cific aircraft for a scheduled mission. ACMs and MEGPs may be placed on the flight authorization, only
in the Remarks section. AE/PJ FAs are attached to the aircraft FA for the mission(s) on which they per-
formed duties.

Frequent and Regular—"Frequent and regular" is a DoD 7000.14-R, Volume 7A, Part Two, term which
establishes the minimum monthly flight requirements to be entitled to conditional Aviation Career Incen-
tive Pay (ACIP), Career Enlisted Flight Incentive Pay (CEFIP), or Hazardous Duty Incentive Pay (HDIP).
DoD 7000.14-R, Volume 7A, Part Two, sets the minimum at four hours for active duty (DoDFMR, Part
Two) and two hours for Air Reserve Components (ARC) per calendar month, or a prorated share for lesser
periods. By itself, the requirement to fly frequently and regularly is not justification to assign an individ-
ual to aircrew or operational support flier status. There must be a need to perform inflight duties.
Gate—Identifies a point in a rated officer’s or CEA’s aviation career at which utilization is measured
according to the Aviation Career Incentive Act of 1974, the Aviation Career Improvement Act of 1989,
the FY 96 National Defense Authorization Act, or the FY 00 National Defense Authorization Act. Utili-
zation is measured at the 12th and 18th year of aviation service for rated officers, and 10th, 15th, and 20th
years of aviation service for CEAs. A transition period was in effect for rated officers until 1 October
2003.
Government Aircraft—An aircraft owned, operated, or leased by the US Government.
Hazardous Duty Incentive Pay (HDIP)—Incentive pay authorized for personnel required to perform
flight duties on a frequent and regular basis.
Host Aviation Resource Management Office—The office responsible for ARMS, flight record, and
jump record management. The HARM office determines entitlement to ACIP, CEFIP, and HDIP.
Host Aviation Resource Manager—The sole approval authority (except for HQ USAF/XOOT) at each
flying base for determining entitlement and the starting and stopping of Aviation Career Incentive Pay
(ACIP), Career Enlisted Flier Incentive Pay (CEFIP), and Hazardous Duty Incentive Pay (HDIP) for fly-
ing and parachute duties; responsible for interpreting public law as it pertains to entitlement to these
incentive pays along with auditing and reconciliation of these incentive pays; and the single point of con-
tact for ARMS. These positions are inherently governmental.
Instrument Flight—Flight conducted when external conditions require that the aircraft attitude be main-
tained primarily by reference to the flight instruments.
Intent—For the purpose of publishing an Aeronautical Order, the intent of an AO validates individual
qualification for aviation and parachutist service, authorizes and directs frequent and regular participation
in aerial flight or parachute duties; and establishes or terminates individual entitlement to ACIP, CEFIP,
and HDIP. Intent also includes the effective date of the AO.
Interfly—The exchange and/or substitution of aircrews and aircraft between MAJCOMs.
Mission—For the purpose of this instruction only, mission is defined as a primary objective for which an
aircraft is operated (see Mission Symbols) and which may consist of an increment of one or more sorties.
Several missions may be accomplished in one sortie.
Mission Essential Ground Personnel (MEGP)—Military members not authorized AOs who are tasked
to perform unique ground support duties directly related and essential to the particular aircraft or mission
being flown, e.g., a maintenance specialist required to perform routine maintenance or a security team
required to guard the aircraft at enroute or destination stops. MEGPs are further defined by MAJCOMs in
MAJCOM supplements to this instruction. The OG/CC (or equivalent) with operational control of the
mission being flown grants MEGP status. MEGPs are passengers and may only fly on aircraft capable of
carrying passengers IAW the provisions of DoD 4515.13-R.
AFI11-401_AFRCSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2005                                                                          217


Officer Service Date (OSD)—Effective date of service as a commissioned, warrant, or flight officer,
whether or not served on extended active duty. This is usually equivalent to total federal commissioned
service date backdated by any period served as a warrant or flight officer. For flight surgeons, the OSD
includes constructive service granted medical officers in the computation of creditable service for basic
pay.
Operational Flying—Flying performed under competent orders by rated and CEA personnel (primarily
for mission, support, or training purposes) while serving in an assignment where basic flying skills usu-
ally are maintained for performing assigned duties.
Operational Support Flier—An individual whose primary, full-time duty does not require flying. The
Air Force may require these individuals to fly on an occasional basis to perform a specific, essential
inflight duty that cannot be performed by an assigned aircrew member. Duties may include, but are not
limited to inflight test, operation, or inflight maintenance of specific aircraft systems or installed equip-
ment. Operational support fliers must be placed on aeronautical orders and complete prescribed flying
hour requirements in order for them to receive non-crew hazardous duty pay. Authorized man-months are
required prior to issuance of aeronautical orders.
Orientation Flight—Continuous flights in DoD-owned aircraft performed within the local flying area
and terminating at the point of origin.
Point-to-Point—Public Affairs travel. Point-to-point means flights that takeoff from one location and
land at a different location. Such flights require MAJCOM/CC or SECAF approval as specified in Table
1.1. of this instruction. Point-to-point orientation flights are not authorized.
Sortie—An AFTO Form 781 aircraft sortie begins when the aircraft begins to move forward on takeoff or
takes off vertically from rest at any point of support. It ends after airborne flight when the aircraft returns
to the surface and either of the following conditions occur: a) the engines are stopped, or the aircraft is on
the surface for five minutes, whichever occurs first; or, b) a change is made in the crew which enplanes or
deplanes a crewmember. For logging aircrew proficiency training, on missions where some crewmembers
deplane and the remaining crew from the original takeoff re-launch, this may be considered to be a con-
tinuation of the original aircrew sortie. MAJCOMs may establish MDS-specific crew requirements and
procedures for aircrew continuation sorties.
STANAG 3526 AMD—Interchangeability of NATO Aircrew Medical Categories.
Supervisory Aircrew or Staff Member—Personnel in supervisory or staff positions (API 6, 8, B, and D)
who actively fly; or in positions (API 3, 4, C, and E) that require aircrew expertise but individuals are not
required to fly.
Training Level—Assigned to individuals based on the continuation training aircrew status (basic aircraft
qualification, basic mission capable, or mission ready/combat mission ready) they are required to main-
tain.
Training Period—Any training period determined by the MAJCOM or Wing in which training require-
ments are performed.
Unit Commander—When used in this instruction, "unit commander" refers to the squadron commander
(or comparable level) or higher level within the chain of command.

A2.3. Responsibilities. The AFTO Form 781 is established by TO 00-20-1. Maintenance personnel are
responsible for distributing and collecting these forms. Completing AFTO Form 781 and other forms in
that series is a joint responsibility of maintenance personnel and the pilot in command.
A2.3.4.3. The original copy of the AFTO Form 781 must be provided to the HARM that services the unit
to which the aircraft is assigned no later than 5 days after the end of the month in which the flights were
performed. For example, the Form 781 for a flight flown in March must be turned in to the servicing
HARM NLT 5 April.
EXCEPTION: ARC units that track/maintain ACIP and CEFIP for their aircrew members may forward
the AFTO Forms 781 to the servicing HARM not later than the first day following two months after the
month in which the flight was performed. In the above example, the forms would not be required to be
turned into the HARM until 1 June.
A2.3.4.3.1. To prevent changes being made to an individual’s flight record in ARMS after the original was
updated and sent to the HARM office, SARMs are not authorized to maintain duplicate copies of AFTO
Forms 781 (including extracts). If changes are required after the flight information has been entered in
ARMS and the form is at the HARM, the pilot in command must contact the HARM office to make cor-
rections.
Table A2.1. AFTO Form 781 Entries According to TO 00-20-5.


ITEM    ENTER
   2    MDS designator from AFTO Form 781F, item 3. Example F016A.
   3    Enter the aircraft serial number. Use the following format for entry in ARMS, last two
        digits of the year, followed by a dash, then the last four digits of the tail number.
        Example: 83-0142.
   4    Organization to which the aircraft is assigned. Show command designation in
        parentheses (for example, 52 FW (USAFE) and the four-letter code of the HARM office
        which serves that organization (obtain from the unit HARM/SARM Office). This will be
        the HARM office that processes and files the original forms.
   5    The base of the unit of aircraft assignment.
AFTO FORM 781 ENTRIES (CERTIFIED BY THE PILOT IN COMMAND)
   1    Date. Use numerical digits for year, month, and day. The date must be the Greenwich
        Mean Time (GMT) date. Example- 20050325
   6    Mission number assigned for this leg of the mission (MAJCOM option).
   7    Authorized mission symbol for each flight. Aircrew may enter all flights on the same
        GMT date on a single AFTO Form 781.
   8    International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) code for the base or airport where the
        aircraft takes off. If a flight is continued from a previous entry, enter "INFL."
    9   Base ICAO code for the base or airport where the aircraft lands. If a flight is terminated
        without landing for a change in mission symbol, enter "INFL."
   10   24-hour GMT clock time. The takeoff time is when the aircraft begins to move forward
        on takeoff roll.
AFI11-401_AFRCSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2005                                                                    219


ITEM   ENTER
   11  24-hour GMT clock time. The landing is when the aircraft is on the ground after being
       airborne and any of the following conditions occur: (a) The engines are stopped and
       shutdown occurs at or before five minutes after touchdown. (b) The aircraft has been on
       the ground for five minutes after touchdown; however, a series of practice landings is
       considered one flight. (c) A change is made in the crew where a crewmember enplanes
       or deplanes. NOTE: When a flight starts before 2400 GMT and ends after GMT
       midnight (2400Z), record and report the flight on the date of takeoff. A separate AFTO
       Form 781 is not necessary.
  12   Subtract takeoff time from landing time, convert to hours and tenths, and enter the result.
       The conversion table for minutes to tenths of an hour is on the reverse of the form.
  13   Number of touch-and-go, full stop, and total landings.
  14   Number of sorties accomplished. A sortie covers a flight from first take off to landing as
       described in block 11; however, if any flight entry is split (INFL), the sortie will be
       recorded on the flight that lists final landing.
  15   Specified by MAJCOM.
  16   Unit designated to perform this mission (MAJCOM option).
TOTALS Total flight time, landings, and sorties at the end of the mission or day.
  17   Four-digit unit number to which the crewmember is assigned/attached for flying. Use
       leading zeros when the unit number has fewer than four digits.
  18   SSN of the crewmember. An error in this entry will result in time being lost or credited
       to another crewmember.
  19   Crewmember’s last name (printed).
  20   Flight Authorization (FA) Duty Code assigned on the FA to the crewmember for this
       mission. This code cannot be higher than the individual’s current qualification, but will
       indicate duties that the individual crewmember is scheduled to perform on the mission.
       For example, if the individual is an IP, but is scheduled to perform MP duties on a
       mission, the individual will be listed as an MP on the Flight Authorization. Refer to
       Table A2.3. for a complete list of duty codes. NOTE: The only time the FA code will
       not match the scheduled duties on the FA is for extenuating circumstances. The AC
       must document the reason in the remarks of the AFTO Form 781. For example, a pilot
       was scheduled to perform IP duties in conjunction with upgrade training for a second
       pilot; however, the upgrading individual was DNIF and did not fly, so the pilot only
       performed primary duties. MP is logged with primary time and the AC documents the
       reason in the remarks section. When using the FA more than one day, log FA Duty Code
       actually performed and annotate in remarks if different from the FA.
 21-26 Times in hours and tenths for each category as defined in Chapter 3 of this instruction.
       The total time in item 26 cannot exceed the grand total in item 12 column and total of
       items 21 through 25 cannot exceed item 26.
  27   Total number of sorties for this crewmember. Entry is normally the grand total (see item
       14, above).
220                                                      AFI11-401_AFRCSUP1_I 1 MARCH 2005

  28-30    Hours and tenths of time performed in night, instrument, or simulated conditions, as
           defined in Chapter 3 of this instruction.
      31   Hours and tenths of time performed while wearing night vision goggles.
      32   Air Reserve Component Flight Duty Status Code for the crewmember, if applicable. If
           used: 1=Active Duty, 2=Unit Training Assembly (Inactive Duty), 3=Flying Training
           Period (Inactive Period), 4=Civilian Technician, and 33=Inactive Duty.
      33   Log Combat Time in hours/tenths for each category as defined in Chapter 3 of this
           instruction.
      34   Number of Combat Sorties flown that meet requirements as defined in this instruction,
           Chapter 3.
      35   Log Combat Support Time in hours and tenths for each category as defined in Chapter
           3 of this instruction.
      36   Number of Combat Support Sorties flown that meet requirements as defined in Chapter

           pilot in command initials for each sortie.
      39   Initials of the unit operations officer or Aviation Resource Manager (ARM) who verifies
           the accuracy and legibility of the form prior to entry into ARMS.
      40   Eight-digit date and initials of the ARM who processed and audited form.


A2.4.2. The data extract AFTO Form 781 is an exact copy of the original AFTO Form 781.
A2.4.3. Upon receipt of an extract, member's servicing HARM office personnel will lightly line through
individual mission data lines of members not in the local ARMS database, leaving only the members they
will enter in ARMS. The HARM office responsible for management of the original AFTO form 781 will
have a line lightly drawn through members who were extracted (not from aircraft's home station).

number combinations (such as AB) are authorized for events identified in other publications.
A2.6. AFTO Forms 781 Series. The AFTO Form 781 is used to record operational flight data. Other forms
in the series, important to the pilot in command, give detailed information that concerns the status, servic-
ing, and configurations of the aircraft, or list symbols required to properly complete other forms in the
series. Although explained in detailed in TO 00-20-1, these forms are briefly reviewed to assist aircrew
personnel.
A3.3.6.1.4. HARM offices are not authorized to amend an AO to correct an effective date. Since the intent
of a published AO is that the AO is valid from the beginning (effective date), an incorrect AO effective
date invalidates that AO from the beginning. HARM offices must revoke the AO and publish a new AO
with the correct effective date and the required aviation service change.
NOTE: HARM offices are authorized to amend other HARM offices’ AOs (provide copy to original
office).

of copies if the order applies to more than one individual. For example, the HARM gets 20 copies if the
order is for four individuals.
3. Enclose all orders imposing or revoking a suspension in a US Government Messenger Envelope or a
sealed envelope, before placing it in distribution channels.
4. Forward orders disqualifying an individual from aviation service or removing one from parachute jump
status.
5. Forward orders awarding the aircrew member badge and orders that medically or permanently disqual-
ify for aviation service only.
6. AOs used as MPOs to start and stop pay are forwarded to finance within 5 work days of AO request
date. HARMs should make every effort to process AO/MPOs on or before effective dates when the action
affects pay/OFDA entitlements.
A5.1. Purpose. Unit commanders will use the AF Form 4327 and 4327a to authorize the use of USAF air-
craft to perform a specific mission(s), and to authorize aircrew members required to perform in-flight
duties. Use the AF Form 4327 to authorize flights of fighter and trainer aircraft for missions that originate
and end at the same location. Use the AF Form 4327a to authorize all other aircraft missions and for fight-
ers/trainers (if desired). These are critical documents used during mission review to validate duties per-
formed/logged on the AFTO Form 781, and for reimbursement of temporary duty expenses.
A5.1.1. Additional members authorized to fly, who are not required to perform aircrew duties (except for
noninterference flyers on AOs, and ACMs and MEGP when specifically authorized [see paragraph
A5.1.3]) must be listed on a passenger manifest.
A5.1.2. The FA accounts for aircrew personnel required/authorized to perform in-flight aircrew duties and
the passenger manifest lists all additional members approved to fly on the aircraft, but not performing spe-
cific aircrew duties on that mission. ACMs and MEGP may be listed on the FA, in the Remarks section; if
not listed on the FA, these individuals will be placed on the passenger manifest. The FA and passenger
manifest combined account for all personnel on the aircraft.
A5.2. Scope. These instructions apply to all flying unit commanders with operational control of USAF
aircraft who direct the use of aircraft and aircrews in support of command operations, and AE and parares-
cue unit commanders who publish AE/PJ flight authorizations for aircrew members assigned to their unit
that are required to perform aircrew duties on the mission.

NOTES:
1. Only members on AOs, required to perform in-flight duties on that mission are authorized to be on
flight authorizations IAW paragraphs 1.6.2.1.. and 1.8.1.. of this instruction.
2. Since the AE/PJ flight authorization is not a standalone form, aircraft commanders must validate spe-
cific mission elements (blocks 1 thru 10) on AE/PJ flight authorizations match the aircraft’s flight autho-
rization for that specific mission.
3. As a minimum, AE/PJ flight authorizations must contain information in blocks 11-18.
4. Aircraft commanders must validate all aircrew members listed on the flight authorization(s), including
AE/PJ aircrew members, are required to perform aircrew duties or are required to perform specific tasks
(non-interference flyers on AOs) by initialing in Block 16.
5. AE/PJ flight authorizations must be filed with the aircraft flight authorization (mission paperwork) that
they performed specific in-flight aircrew duties on.
