SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This change provides new guidance regarding reenlisting in the United States Air Force. The
Selective Reenlistment Program prohibits commanders from denying reenlistment on the basis of
the same condition for which a MEB/PEB found an Airman fir for duty and clarifies
commanders must provide specific reason for denial of reenlistment. The AF Form 545, Request
for Career Job Reservation is deleted from the Air Force forms inventory and replaced by
memorandum when required. Provides eligible Airmen with approved retraining (B-quota)
Career Job Reservation (CJR) to reenlist in current skill in lieu of extending and establishes new
CJR Exception to Policy (ETP) procedures. The Selective Reenlistment Bonus (SRB) further
restricts Airmen from performing duties outside their SRB specialty more than 90 days in a 360
period, establishes termination and recoupment for unauthorized/erroneous SRBs. Delegates
repayment determinations to the AFPC/CC or AFPC/CD (in his/her absence), when Airmen are
paid a bonus under this directive. Reenlistment clarifies that Airmen retaining under
CAREERS/NCORP must be reenlistment eligible in order request cancellation of an extension
that has not been entered for immediate reenlistment, prohibits corrections items 2, 5, 8, 18b, 19b
and 19f to the DD Form 4, Enlistment/Reenlistment Document-Armed Forces of the United
States, requires civilian directors/commanders to submit an AF Form 418, Selective Reenlistment
Program Consideration within 7 calendar days when reenlistment is not approved, streamlines
High Year of Tenure (HYT) processing, waives HYT for FTA/TSgts receiving Zone A/E SRBs
to 10 and 22 years respectively; restricts Military Personnel Sections (MPS) from
removing/deleting an executed contract. Establishes a new Reenlistment Eligibility (RE) code of
3A and updates RE codes 4D/4E to meet new HYT policies, updates the authorized Term of
Enlistment (TOE) table and prohibits waiving obligated service for all reenlistments and
establishes 2-year reenlistments for 6-year initial enlistees reenlisting to HYT. Updates the
Conditions Authorizing Reenlistment table to include Post 9/11 GI Bill. Extensions establishes
minimum MPS grades to sign/approve extension documents, clarifies that Airmen in SRB skills
with at least a 3-level extending IAW Table 6.1 Rule 12, 13, 14, 16 and 29 may extend more
than required to qualify for an SRB. Establishes new procedures for Airmen medically
disqualified and within the final 6 months of service, clarifies that only Airmen in RE code 4K
may extend no more than 24 months for promotion, establishes the FSS commander as the
extension approval/disapproval authority in denial of extension cases, streamlines HYT
extension procedures, provides FTA/TSgt receiving a Zone A/E SRB to extend HYT to 10 and
22 years respectively and updates the Reasons for Extensions of Enlistment table. A margin bar

                                          Chapter 2

                    SELECTIVE REENLISTMENT PROGRAM (SRP)

2.1. SRP Objective. The SRP objective is to ensure the Air Force retains only Airmen who
consistently demonstrate the capability and willingness to maintain high professional standards.
The SRP applies to all enlisted personnel.
2.2. SRP Authority. Commanders have total SRP selection authority as long as no other
factors barring immediate reenlistment exist. Commanders may non-select any Airman for SRP
as long as the Airman is in his/her SRP window according to paragraph 2.4. The selection/non-
selection decision should not be based on Airman’s career intent and should be consistent with
other qualitative decisions. Commanders will not use the SRP to deny reenlistment when
involuntary separation is more appropriate. Commanders may reverse their selection/non-
selection decision at any time.
2.3. SRP and Airman Promotion Program Relationship. The objective of both programs is
to ensure the career force consists of highly qualified, professional noncommissioned officers
(NCO). SRP non-selection makes Airmen ineligible for promotion and automatically cancels
projected promotion line numbers.
2.4. SRP Roster/RIPS and Procedures. The MPS Career Development Section receives a
Master SRP Roster from the Personnel Systems Manager (PSM) NLT the 1st of each month.
This roster indentifies, First Term Airmen (FTA) who completed 33 months (4 year enlistees) or
57 months (6 year enlistees) on current enlistment; second term/career Airmen within 13 months
of ETS; and National Call to Service (NCS) Airmen who complete 33 months of current
enlistment. Two separate RIPs are also produced: one for the Airman and one for the Airman’s
supervisor. The RIPS notify the Airman of his/her SRP/CJR eligibility window and provides
instructions on reenlistment. Supervisor’s use the other RIP to provide a recommendation to the
commander in order to aid in the selection/non-selection decision.
   2.4.1. The MPS sends SRP consideration rosters and RIPs monthly to the unit commanders.
   Units use the roster to control/suspense RIPs to supervisors. The SRP Roster is separated
   into the following four parts:
       2.4.1.1. Part I (SRP Actions) identifies Airmen requiring SRP consideration or
       reconsideration. Part I also generates Reports on Individual Personnel (RIP) for airmen
       requiring SRP consideration (except for airmen with RE code 3B). The RIPs assist
       supervisors and commanders in evaluating airmen for continued service. Only
       supervisors wishing to recommend denial of reenlistment must initiate an AF Form 418,
       Selective Reenlistment Program Consideration. Commanders must take SRP action
       within 30 calendar days for Airmen whose ineligibility condition no longer exists.
       2.4.1.2. Part II (SRP Monitor) identifies Airmen with quality indicators (low EPR
       ratings, an Unfavorable Information File (UIF), etc.), who were already considered under
       SRP. Unit commanders use this product to determine if SRP reconsideration is
       appropriate. If so, the unit will initiate an AF Form 418 for selection/non-selection
       according to paragraph 2.7.
10                                                                 AFI36-2606 9 MAY 2011


     2.4.1.3. Part III (CJR Eligibility) identifies eligible FTA who have not yet applied for a
     CJR. RIPs advise Airmen and immediate supervisors of the CJR eligibility criteria and
     their responsibilities.
     2.4.1.4. Part IV (Reenlistment Ineligibility) identifies reenlistment-ineligible airmen.
     Refer to paragraph 5.16.
  2.4.2. Commanders review the SRP roster to consider whether members should be denied
  reenlistment, selected for reenlistment or to reverse previous non-selection. The commander
  only receives AF Form 418s non-recommending retention from supervisors. The supervisor
  initiates an AF Form 418 and completes Section I and II and forwards to the commander.
     2.4.2.1. If the commander agrees with the supervisor’s recommendation to non-select,
     the commander completes the Sections III and IV of the AF Form 418 and forwards to
     the MPS along with Part I of the SRP roster. See paragraph 2.7.
     2.4.2.2. If the commander disagrees on the non-selection, then the commander destroys
     the AF Form 418 and no further action is required. See paragraph 2.4.4.
     2.4.2.3. If the commander determines the Airman will not be selected for reenlistment,
     then the commander may direct the supervisor to initiate an AF Form 418 or he/she may
     initiate an AF Form 418 and forward to the MPS. See paragraph 2.7.
     2.4.2.4. Only the commander’s decision selects or non-selects the Airman for continued
     service.
  2.4.3. Commander’s should consider the following before making a decision:
     2.4.3.1. Enlisted Performance Report (EPR) ratings.
     2.4.3.2. Unfavorable information from any substantiated source.
     2.4.3.3. The Airman’s willingness to comply with Air Force standards (i.e. fitness,
     dress/appearance, timeliness etc.).
     2.4.3.4. The Airman’s ability (or lack of) to meet required training and duty performance
     levels.
     2.4.3.5. A fit for duty finding by a Physical Evaluation Board (PEB) does not
     automatically entitle an Airman to reenlist upon completion of their required active
     service. However, an Airman may not be denied reenlistment on the basis of the same
     condition for which a PEB found the Airman fit for duty.
  2.4.4. After 30 days (from date of SRP Roster), if the commander has not taken action to
  deny reenlistment (AF Form 418), then MilPDS automatically updates RE code to allow
  reenlistment. RE codes update as follows (See Table 5.1. for definitions):
     2.4.4.1. RE code 3C changes to RE code 1R.
AFI36-2606 9 MAY 2011                                                                          11


       2.4.4.2. RE code 1M changes to RE code 1K or 1P or 1Q
       (Note: If the PSM office hasn’t received the Master SRP Rosters [RRSRTR], they
       should confirm that EOM is configured to handle/distribute this roster. If your PSM
       office has verified the configuration and still has not received this roster by the 1st of
       month then they should contact the Operations Control Center [DSN 665-4393] to see if
       there is an issue with delivery/receipt of MILPDS products).
2.5. Delaying SRP Actions. When Airmen require SRP consideration upon arrival to the new
duty location, the gaining commander may delay SRP consideration for no more than 90
calendar days after Date Arrived Station (DAS).
   2.5.1. If the Airman received SRP consideration, the former MPS advises the gaining MPS
   of the selection or non-selection status and forwards the supporting documentation.
   2.5.2. If the Airman did not receive SRP consideration, the new commander may delay SRP
   consideration as outlined in paragraph 2.5.
2.6. When to use AF Form 418, Selective Reenlistment Program Consideration. The AF
Form 418 documents non-selection for continued service or reconsideration actions.
Commanders use the AF Form 418 when:
   2.6.1. Denying reenlistment during the SRP process.
   2.6.2. Airmen were initially ineligible for consideration during their SRP window for
   reasons in Table 5.2, Table 5.3 or Table 5.4, but later become eligible for consideration.
   Commander must initiate SRP consideration within 30 calendar days.
   2.6.3. Airmen previously denied reenlistment and commander reverses decision.
   2.6.4. Airmen require early SRP consideration (refer to paragraph 2.9.).
(Note: When removing negative RE codes (to include RE code 4K) for Airmen who are not in
their SRP window or not eligible for SRP consideration, update RE code 3C or 1M respectively.
These Airmen will appear on the SRP roster upon entering their SRP window. If the Airman is
in his/her SRP window, then update RE code to 3B and these Airmen will appear on Part I of
next month roster for SRP reconsideration).
2.7. Commander Action on AF Form 418: The commander places an "X" or initials in the
appropriate item of Section III and enters the specific reason(s) for non-selection in the remarks
area. The commander signs and dates the form and attaches any supporting documentation to
substantiate non-selection decision. Supervisor recommendation is optional. (Note: When
Airmen are TDY and will not return within 30 days of the decision date, commander includes the
following statement in the upper margin of the AF Form 418: "Airman is TDY until [expected
return date]").
   2.7.1. For Airmen non-selected under SRP:
       2.7.1.1. The commander should discuss the non-selection with the Airman’s supervisor
       before making final decision. The commander should discuss the following items with
       the Airman: specific reasons for non-selection, areas needing improvement, promotion
       ineligibility (to include automatic cancellation of projected promotion line numbers) and
       the possibility of future reconsideration and selection.
 12                                                                AFI36-2606 9 MAY 2011


      2.7.1.2. Counsel Airman on appeal process and ensure they understand they must
      acknowledge receipt of notification immediately, but they have 3 workdays to render an
      appeal intent.
      2.7.1.3. Ensure Airman completes Section IV to acknowledge receipt of notification of
      non-selection during the personal interview.
      2.7.1.4. Ensure Airman completes Section V to render appeal intent within 3 workdays
      of acknowledgment, if applicable.
      2.7.1.5. Provide Airman with a copy of the AF Form 418 and supporting documentation,
      maintains a copy of the package and sends the original to the MPS for processing.
      2.7.1.6. If appealing, directs the Airman to report to the MPS for counseling on appeal
      process and requirements.
   2.7.2. For Airmen reconsidered and selected:
      2.7.2.1. The commander places an "X" or initials in the appropriate item of Section II
      and commander signs and dates the form.
      2.7.2.2. Forwards AF Form 418 to MPS for update of appropriate RE code.
2.8. MPS Action with AF Form 418. Upon receipt of the AF Form 418 from unit, the MPS
will:
   2.8.1. Quality reviews the AF Form 418 and return to unit if incomplete. If the AF Form
   418 is complete, update Section VI by entering the Airman’s current RE code and new RE
   code (2X, 4J, etc) and date MilPDS was updated.
   2.8.2. Update appropriate RE code in MilPDS (2X, 4J, etc) upon receipt of the AF Form
   418, regardless of appeal intent.
   2.8.3. Review Section V to determine member’s intent to appeal. If member does not intend
   to appeal, forward the form for filing in Automated Records Management System (ARMS).
   If member intends to appeal refer to paragraph 2.10 through 2.11 for processing procedures.

       2.9.1.7. Pregnancy or childbirth.
       2.9.1.8. End of year early release.
       2.9.1.9. Miscellaneous reasons.
   2.9.2. Early separation programs directed by USAF. AFPC/DPSOS will announce the
   program and give the eligibility criteria and processing instructions. AFPC/DPSOAE must
   work with AFPC/DPSOS once the separation is loaded to change RE code to 3A or 2X for
   FTA and verify RE code has been changed to 1J or 2X for second term and career Airmen.
2.10. Processing SRP Non-selection Appeals. Airmen must submit an appeal to the MPS no
later than 10 calendar days from the day they complete AF Form 418, Section V. Written
requests to extend past the 10 calendar days may be approved by the FSS commander, if
circumstances warrant. FSS commanders limit the extension to 5 calendar days and only one
extension may be approved. The Airman must request the extension on or before the 10th
calendar day suspense. Airmen with unique and documented circumstances such as emergency
leave, illness or injury may be granted a delay to submit their appeal. In such cases, the Airman
must immediately advise the MPS of the circumstances and provide the MPS with supporting
documentation. The MPS will forward supporting documentation to AFPC/DPSOAE for review
and if approved, a new appeal suspense date will be established. Request submitted after the 10
calendar day period will be disapproved and the Airman is considered to have failed to submit
the appeal.     (Exception: If the 10th calendar day falls on a weekend or holiday, Airman may
submit an appeal on the following duty day). The MPS will:
   2.10.1. Suspense a copy of the AF Form 418 pending receipt of the appeal package.
       2.10.1.1. Appeals not received within the required time frame, complete Section VI by
       marking Airman’s appeal was ―not‖ received by the appeal date, date and signs the block.
       Forward the original for file in the ARMS and return a copy to the Airman’s commander.
       2.10.1.2. Appeals received within the required time frame, complete Section VI by
       marking Airman’s appeal ―was‖ received by appeal date, date and signs the block.
       Continue appeal processing.
   2.10.2. The MPS constructs a case file containing the AF Form 418, documentation
   submitted by the Airman and commander, the last 5 EPRs, a copy of AF Form 1137 (if
   applicable) and any other pertinent information. Legal reviews are not considered new
   information; and commander recommendations are not consider new information, unless the
   commander adds new documentation/information. (Note: Give Airmen 3 workdays to rebut
   any new information added to the case file after they submit their appeal).
       2.10.2.1. Reviewing officials must return cases to the MPS before forwarding up the
       chain when new documentation or comments are added to the case file by any reviewing
       official. (Note: This does not apply to commander recommendations based on existing
       documentation/matters or legal reviews).
14                                                                  AFI36-2606 9 MAY 2011


     2.10.2.2. The MPS will provide the Airman a copy of the added documentation and
     suspense the rebuttal. If the Airman fails to submit a rebuttal as required, the MPS will
     indicate ―The Airman failed to submit rebuttal remarks to the documentation dated,
     (insert date) as required in the remarks and forward the case file to the next reviewing
     level.
  2.10.3. Within 5 workdays, the MPS sends the case file to the base legal office for review
  and suspense’s for completion. The base legal office refers the case back to the MPS after
  legal review.
  2.10.4. Within 5 workdays of receiving the legal review, the MPS will forward the case file
  to the Airman’s appeal authority as outlined in paragraph 2.11. All packages must be routed
  through the Airman’s group commander when the appeal authority is the wing commander
  and routed through both the group and wing commanders when the appeal authority is
  Secretary of the Air Force (SECAF). Any commander in the reviewing chain may approve
  an Airman’s appeal. (Note: Once the case file has been sent to the appropriate approval
  authority it cannot be sent to the next level to have the decision overturned).
  2.10.5. When the SECAF is the appeal authority process the case as follows:
     2.10.5.1. After all routing is complete as outlined in paragraph 2.10.1 through 2.10.4; the
     MPS will maintain a copy of the case file and mail the original package to the Airman’s
     parent Major Command (MAJCOM)/Direct Reporting Unit (DRU)/Field Operating
     Agency (FOA) A1 for administrative accuracy and SRP eligibility verification.
     2.10.5.2. MAJCOM/DRU/FOA A1 will send the case file to MAJCOM/DRU/FOA legal
     office for review and the MAJCOM/DRU/FOA legal office includes legal advisory in
     case file.      If upon receipt of the MAJCOM/DRU/FOA legal review the
     MAJCOM/DRU/FOA A1 approves appeal, complete Section VII and the case is returned
     to the servicing MPS. If the MAJCOM/DRU/FOA A1 recommends disapproval, the
     MAJCOM/DRU/FOA A1 includes the MAJCOM/DRU/FOA legal review and
     MAJCOM/DRU/FOA A1 denial recommendation and forwards the case file to
     AFPC/DPSOAE for processing.
     2.10.5.3. AFPC/DPSOAE will send case file to AFPC/JA for legal review. Upon receipt
     of AFPC/JA legal review, AFPC/DPSOAE will forward to AF/A1PF for processing to
     the SECAF and for final decision. After receiving SECAF decision, AFPC/DPSOAE
     will notify and return the case (along with a copy of the SECAF memo) to the servicing
     MPS, and will send a copy of the SECAF memorandum to Airman’s MAJCOM/FOA A1
     and ARMS.
  2.10.6. Any commander in the reviewing chain may approve an Airman’s appeal. The
  appeal authority completes section VII of the AF Form 418. (Exception: SECAF memo
  constitutes completion of this section).
  2.10.7. Upon receipt of completed appeal case files, the MPS will provide a copy to the
  Airman’s commander. The commander notifies the Airman of the final appeal decision and
  ensures the Airman receives a copy of the SECAF memo.
AFI36-2606 9 MAY 2011                                                                       15


   2.10.8. Appeal approval at any level restores reenlistment eligibility effective back to the
   date of the commander’s disapproval. If the Airman was rendered ineligible for certain
   personnel actions (i.e. promotion consideration, reenlistment), these actions are given
   reconsideration based upon the date the commander signed the AF Form 418. MPS updates
   the appropriate RE code, forwards the AF Form 418 and/or appeal approval memorandum
   for filing in the ARMS, and maintains the case file in accordance with AF Records
   Information Management System Records Disposition Schedule.
   2.10.9. If the appeal is disapproved, the MPS verifies RE code 2X is updated and maintains
   the case file in accordance with AF Records Information Management System Records
   Disposition Schedule.
2.11. SRP Appeal Authority.
   2.11.1. First Term Airmen (FTA) or career Airmen who will complete 20 or more years
   Total Active Federal Military Service (TAFMS) on current Expiration Term of Service
   (ETS) appeal to their respective group commander. (Exception: These Airmen appeal to
   their wing commander, if the group commander made the SRP non-selection decision).
   2.11.2. Second term and career Airmen who will complete fewer than 16 years TAFMS on
   their current ETS appeal to their respective wing commander (Exception: These Airmen
   appeal to their MAJCOM/DRU/FOA A1, if the wing commander made the SRP non-
   selection decision).
   2.11.3. Career Airmen who will complete at least 16 years, but fewer than 20 years TAFMS
   on current ETS appeal to the SECAF.
   2.11.4. In the joint base construct, the wing commander level for appeal purposes must be an
   Air Force commander above the group level.

                                           Chapter 3

                    CAREER JOB RESERVATION (CJR) PROGRAM

3.1. CJR Program Eligibility. The CJR program objective is to prevent surpluses and
shortages in the career force. AFPC controls first term reenlistments by maintaining a career job
requirement file for each Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC).
   3.1.1. All First Term Airmen (FTA), regardless of AFSC, must have a CJR in order to
   reenlist. If the Airman does not receive a CJR during his/her window based on the CJR
   ―rank-order‖ process, they will not be allowed to compete for a CJR later in their career and
   he/she will be required to separate on their DOS.
       3.1.1.1. Four-year enlistees enter their CJR window on the first duty day of the month
       they complete 35 months, but not later than the last duty day of the month they complete
       43 months. (Example: SrA Jones enlisted on 27 June 2005 for 4 years. SrA Jones could
       receive a CJR as early as 1 May 2008, but no later than 31 January 2009).
       3.1.1.2. Six-year enlistees enter their CJR window on the first duty day of the month they
       complete 59 months, but not later than the last duty day of the month they complete 67
       months. (Example: SrA Smith enlisted on 27 June 2005 for 6 years. SrA Smith could
       receive a CJR as early as 1 May 2010, but no later than 31 January 2011).
       3.1.1.3. National Call to Service (NCS) enlistees enter their CJR window on the first
       duty day of the month they complete 35 months, but no later than the last duty day of the
       month they complete 38 months. (Note: Commanders and supervisors receive monthly
       computer generated products [refer to paragraph 2.4.1] identifying CJR-eligible Airmen
       who have not received an approval).
   3.1.2. FTA who requests a CJR in their secondary AFSC must complete a memorandum
   requesting a CJR in other than their CAFSC. Requests are submitted through the MPS to
   AFPC/DPSOAE via normal processing procedures.
3.2. CJR “Rank-order” Process. AFPC/DPSOAE uses a quality "rank-order" process to issue
CJRs to Airmen serving in constrained AFSCs. The rank-order factors are:
   3.2.1. Unfavorable Information File (UIF). Any UIF code puts the Airman at the bottom of
   their AFSC list. (Example: An SSgt with a UIF will be considered after all other Airmen
   who do not have a UIF [regardless of rank]).
   3.2.2. Top 3 Enlisted Performance Reports (EPR). (Note: EPRs are not added together, they
   are considered as individual factors).
   3.2.3. Grade (SSgt will be considered before SrA).
   3.2.4. Projected grade (SSgt selects will be considered before SrA).
   3.2.5. Date of Rank (DOR) (senior DOR will be considered first).
   3.2.6. Total Active Federal Military Service Date (TAFMSD) (senior TAFMSD will be
   considered first).
AFI36-2606 9 MAY 2011                                                                      17


3.3. CJR Waiting List. Airmen on the waiting list compete on a monthly basis within their
Control AFSC (CAFSC). The waiting list rank order number may fluctuate as information
changes or as new Airmen apply. (Example: If an Airman has received an UIF or if new Airmen
with projected promotions apply since the last board, the Airman moves down on the list).
Monthly notification RIPs advise Airmen and their supervisor of current waiting list numbers
and encourage retraining.
   3.3.1. Airmen receive final rank-order consideration during the 5th month prior to their
   DOS. If a CJR has not been approved by 5 months prior to their DOS, the Airman cannot
   reenlist in their current AFSC and will separate on their DOS. (Example: If an Airman’s
   DOS is 15 Nov 09, final rank-order consideration occurs through June 2009).
   3.3.2. Airmen will only meet CJR boards during their CJR eligibility window (35th – 43rd
   month for 4 year enlistees, 59th – 67th month for 6-year enlistees or 35th – 38th month for
   Nation Call to Service enlistees). Their CJR window will not be extended to match the new
   DOS from any extension. (Note: Airmen who extend their enlistments with approved CJRs
   will have their CJR expire on the new DOS. MPS must request AFPC/DPSOAE update CJR
   expiration date to reflect new DOS).
   3.3.3. Airmen who are on the CJR waiting list and whose AFSC is removed from the
   constrained list will receive a CJR. Airmen who are removed from the waiting list prior to
   the AFSC being removed (RE code 3I) will not receive supplemental consideration unless
   A1/A1PF provides further guidance.
3.4. Processing Wing or Senior Host Commander Override Requests. Airmen qualify for a
Commander Override if they were on the CJR waiting list, but are removed 5 months prior to
DOS (RE code 3I). When a Commander Override request is approved, AFPC/DPSOAE will
reduce the number of CJRs available in that AFSC during the next monthly CJR board. This
means that one Airman on the constrained wait list will not receive a CJR. Therefore,
commanders must ensure the Airman they recommend is deserving of a wing or senior host
Commander Override request. Commander Override approval authority rests with AFPC/CC.
   3.4.1. Wing or senior host commander may request a Commander Override in rare instances
   and only if the Airman meets all of the following:
       3.4.1.1. Not have a UIF or lost time on their current enlistment.
       3.4.1.2. No record of nonjudicial punishment (NJP) on current enlistment.
       3.4.1.3. All EPRs must be 5s-―Truly among the Best‖ in the overall performance
       assessment.
   3.4.2. Commanders process override requests to the wing or senior host commander through
   the MPS. Units include in the case file a:
       3.4.2.1. Memorandum signed by the Airman, to include an endorsement from the
       commander.
       3.4.2.2. Copies of all EPRs.
       3.4.2.3. Current SURF (AAD005-Active Amn Reenlistment SURF).
 18                                                                  AFI36-2606 9 MAY 2011


       3.4.2.4. Any other supporting documentation to be considered. (For example: Copy of
       approved decoration citations or additional awards the Airman has received (if
       applicable).
   3.4.3. The Chief, MPS will review the case file and process/route the case file to the wing or
   senior host commander for approval/disapproval. The MPS will return a Commander’s
   Override request to the originating unit that does not meet the minimum criteria in 3.4.1.1
   through 3.4.1.3.
   3.4.4. The wing or senior host commander will review the case file and indicate his/her
   decision. If the wing or senior host commander disapproves the request, the case file is
   returned to the Chief, MPS who will notify the Airman’s commander of the disapproval.
   3.4.5. If wing or senior host commander recommends approval, the commander will indicate
   his/her approval and return to the case file to the MPS. The MPS will forward approved case
   files to AFPC/DPSOAE in accordance with current processing instructions.
   3.4.6. AFPC/DPSOAE will review request and ensure all requirements are met. Case files
   not meeting the criteria or missing required documents will be returned to the MPS for
   correction. AFPC/DPSOAE will:
       3.4.6.1. Construct case file and forward to AFPC/CC for approval/disapproval.
       3.4.6.2. If the Commanders Override is disapproved, AFPC/DPSOAE will notify the
       MPS of disapproval action. The MPS will notify the commander of the disapproval.
       3.4.6.3. If the Commanders Override is approved, AFPC/DPSOAE will:
          3.4.6.3.1. Update CJR code ―C‖ in MilPDS.
          3.4.6.3.2. Notify MPS of approval action. The MPS will notify the unit commander
          of the approval.
          3.4.6.3.3. Reduce the number of CJRs available in that AFSC during the next
          monthly CJR board.
3.5. Actions on Receipt of Approved CJRs. Approved CJRs will not expire until the Airman’s
DOS. If an Airman extends his/her enlistment, the MPS must submit a request to
AFPC/DPSOAE to update CJR expiration to match the new DOS. Airmen can have an approved
CJR on file and an approved separation on file at the same time. MPS notifies the Airman who
receives approved CJRs while in TDY or patient status.
3.6. Actions Involving Retraining and Special Duty CJRs. Eligible FTA may apply for
Career Airman Reenlistment Reservation System (CAREERS) retraining even if they have
approved CJRs in their current skills or are on the CJR waiting list.
   3.6.1. MPS must notify AFPC/DPSOAE in accordance with current processing procedures
   (prior to reenlistment/extension) when individuals are selected for retraining. Once notified,
   AFPC/DPSOAE will update CJRs as follows:
AFI36-2606 9 MAY 2011                                                                          19


       3.6.1.1. AFPC/DPSOAE issues CJR in the retraining AFSC (reenlistment availability
       code "B") when the Airman can satisfy the retraining retainability requirement by
       extending. B-quota Airmen are not eligible to reenlist in the retraining-in AFSC until
       completion of technical training and must meet the criteria in paragraph 5.1. (Note:
       Eligible Airmen may reenlist in their current CAFSC in lieu of extending for retraining).
       Also see paragraph 4.10.
          3.6.1.1.1. If the Airman received an approved Base of Preference (BOP) in
          conjunction with retraining, the Airman must reenlist IAW AFI 36-2110,
          Assignments. Also see paragraph 4.10.
       3.6.1.2. AFPC/DPSOAE issues retraining CJR in the current AFSC (reenlistment
       availability code "K") when the Airman cannot satisfy the retraining retainability
       requirement by extending their enlistment. K-quota Airmen must reenlist within 45 days
       of CJR being issued and is not eligible to extend for the retainability. See paragraph 4.11
       for SRB eligibility.
   3.6.2. Airmen may request a CJR in their current skills, as an exception to the normal CJR
   eligibility criteria (paragraphs 3.1), if they were eliminated from retraining for reasons
   beyond their control or if the Air Force cancelled their retraining.
   3.6.3. Airmen who apply and are approved for a special duty assignment who do not have a
   CJR, may apply for CJR in the special duty or Reporting Identifier (RI) (8XXXX or 9F, 9L,
   9R or 9S only). If approved, the AFPC/DPSOAE will update the CJR in the special duty
   AFSC.
3.7. Processing CJR Exception to Policy (ETP) Request. Ordinarily, Airmen in constrained
AFSCs who were ineligible for a CJR during their CJR window will not have or be given
another opportunity to compete/apply for a CJR. However, AFPC/DPSOAE will consider
exceptions to policy request when reasons beyond the members control (FTA who did not have
their citizenship, pending Medical Evaluation Board (MEB), etc…) prevented them from being
eligible for a CJR during their normal window. MPSs will assist the Airman in applying for a
CJR as an ETP.
   3.7.1. Commanders are responsible for investigating allegations and disapproving
   unsubstantiated ETP requests. Substantiated requests will be processed to the MPS. The
   MPS will process the ETP to AFPC/DPSOAE via normal processing procedures.
   3.7.2. If an ETP is approved by AFPC/DPSOAE, the Airman will be supplementally ―rank-
   ordered‖ using their respective CJR window. If a CJR is earned, the quota will be taken from
   the overall quota in that constrained AFSC and the MPS notified. If the Airman did not rank
   high enough to earn a CJR, AFPC/DPSOAE will advise the MPS. The MPS shall advise the
   commander of AFPC/DPSOAE’s determination.

                                            Chapter 4

                SELECTIVE REENLISTMENT BONUS (SRB) PROGRAM

4.1. Purpose and Application. The Selective Reenlistment Bonus (SRB) Program is a
monetary incentive paid to Airmen serving in certain selected critical military skills who reenlist
for additional obligated service. The bonus is intended to encourage the reenlistment of
sufficient numbers of qualified enlisted personnel in military skills with either demonstrated
retention shortfalls or high training costs. Airmen can expect to serve in the SRB specialty for
the entire enlistment for which the bonus was paid. The SRB program set forth in this Chapter is
subject to authorization under 37 USC 308 for such bonuses. The combined CSRB and SRB
received during a career shall not exceed $200.000, unless specifically authorized as an
exception by the PDUSD(P&R). (Note: SRB computation is to a maximum of 24 years of
service for all SRB authorized specialties).
   4.1.1. Airmen do not qualify for the SRB if they reenlist or extend their enlistments for any
   purpose other than continued active service in the SRB skill. Prior service enlistees are not
   eligible for reenlistment bonuses; however, they may be eligible for a prior service enlistment
   bonus if there is a program currently in effect.
   4.1.2. Reenlist IAW paragraphs 5.1.2, 5.1.4; or extend IAW Table 6.1, Rules 12, 13, 14, 16
   and 29 (in one increment) in the Regular Air Force (RegAF) for at least 3 years. SRB
   designations are further broken down by Zones, which are determined by the Airman’s Total
   Active Federal Military Service (TAFMS) at the time of reenlistment or date he/she enters
   the extension. SRB eligibility zones are:
       4.1.2.1. Zone A is between 17 months and 6 years of service.
       4.1.2.2. Zone B is between 6 and 10 years of service.
       4.1.2.3. Zone C is between 10 and 14 years of service.
       4.1.2.4. Zone E is between 18 and 20 years of service.
           4.1.2.4.1. Airmen reenlisting/extending in Zone E will incur an Active Duty Service
           Commitment (ADCS) for a period equal to the term for which the SRB is paid. See
           paragraph 4.8.
   4.1.3. Eligible Airmen may receive an SRB in each zone, but only one SRB per zone. The
   SRB multiple indicates the severity of the retention problem and the level of pay authorized
   to deal with the problem. The maximum SRB payable is $90,000 per zone. Eligible Airmen
   may receive more than one zone at the same time. (Example: An Airman who reenlists and
   receives a Zone A SRB then reenlists again prior to the Zone A SRB expiring and is eligible
   for a Zone B, the Airman would receive both payments until they receive the last Zone A
   authorization).
4.2. SRB-Eligible AFSCs. AF/A1PF and career field managers review each Air Force
Specialty for award or adjustment of the SRB at least once per year. (Note: Reenlistments or
extensions of any length executed prior to the release of AF/A1PF announcement message are
valid and will not be cancelled or declared void for the purpose of qualifying for a SRB).
AFI36-2606 9 MAY 2011                                                                           21


   4.2.1. AF/A1PF may use one or more of the following criteria to designate SRB skills:
       4.2.1.1. Shortfalls in meeting current and projected retention objectives (retention rates
       and size of specific year groups, as well as adjacent year groups).
       4.2.1.2. Shortages in current and projected NCO (SSgt through MSgt) manning.
       4.2.1.3. High training investment and replacement cost for the skill.
       4.2.1.4. Expected improvement in retention resulting from designation as an SRB skill.
   4.2.2. AF/A1PF announces SRB changes (increases, decreases, additions and deletions).
       4.2.2.1. The effective date of increases and additions is as soon after the announcement
       date as possible.
       4.2.2.2. The effective date of decreases and deletions is at least 30 days from the
       announcement date.
4.3. General Eligibility Criteria.
   4.3.1. Airmen qualify for the SRB if they meet all the following:
       4.3.1.1. Are serving in the grade of A1C or higher.
       4.3.1.2. Are qualified and serving in an SRB skill in the appropriate zone and reflected
       on the current SRB authorized listing. Both CASFC and DAFSC must match SRB
       AFSC. See paragraph 4.10 through 4.12. (Note: The Airman must be performing
       (DAFSC) in the SRB AFSC and maintain a CAFSC in the SRB-AFSC. Any
       unauthorized/erroneous     SRB     will   necessitate    re-accomplishment     of    the
       reenlistment/extension documents and will be terminated and recouped).
       4.3.1.3. Are eligible to reenlist or extend.
       4.3.1.4. Reenlist or extend their enlistments (in one increment) in the RegAF, without a
       break in service of more than 24 hours, for a period of at least 3 years (refer to paragraph
       5.4).
       4.3.1.5. Extensions qualifying for an SRB begin payment on the day the extension is
       entered and SRB eligibility is based on the following:
           4.3.1.5.1. Zone is determined by the date the Airmen will enter the extension.
           4.3.1.5.2. AFSCs and multiples in affect (by Zone) on the date extension is approved
           determine the amount of SRB. Future changes to SRB skills list do not affect the
           Airman’s SRB entitlements. (Example: If an Airman extends while serving in the
           Zone A window, but will be in the Zone B window on the day the extension is
           entered, the Airman receives a Zone B bonus. Likewise if an Airman extends while
           serving in Zone A, but will be in Zone B, and there is no Zone B authorization, the
           Airman would not qualify for a SRB).
           4.3.1.5.3. Have not previously received readjustment pay, severance pay or
           separation pay.
 22                                                                   AFI36-2606 9 MAY 2011


   4.3.2. Airmen in Air Reserve components don’t receive the SRB if they enlist in the RegAF,
   following discharge from the Reserves, during or at the end of an active duty for training
   (ADT) period. Reservists on RegAF extended active duty (EAD) tours may receive an SRB
   if they enlist in the RegAF. They must meet all other eligibility criteria.
   4.3.3. Break-in service Airmen may receive the SRB if they reenlist in the Air Force within
   3 months after discharge or release from active duty (other than ADT).
   4.3.4. Former officers may receive the SRB if they reenlist in the RegAF within 3 months
   after release from active duty as officers, as long as they served as enlisted Airmen just
   before serving as officers. They must meet all other eligibility criteria.
4.4. SRBs when applying for Commission. Airmen are not eligible for an SRB if they reenlist
or enter an extension in order to get required retainability for a commissioning program after the
selection date. Airmen may be eligible for an SRB if they reenlist or enter an extension before
the selection date. In these cases, SRB payments does not occur pending official selection or
non-selection. See paragraph 4.4.3.
   4.4.1. Airmen selected for a commissioning program and need retainability are not
   authorized the SRB.
   4.4.2. Airmen selected for a commissioning program and are receiving SRB installment
   payments from previous reenlistment/extension will have their SRB suspended/terminated
   effective one day prior to class start date of commissioning program.
       4.4.2.1. AFPC/DPSIPS will provide AFPC/DPSOAE a class roster of all prior service
       commissioning program selectees, prior to each OTS class start date.
       4.4.2.2. AFPC/DPSOAE will take action to suspend/terminate future SRB installments
       via current processing procedure effective the class start date.
       4.4.2.3. Indianapolis (DFAS-IN) terminates payments effective the date of
       commissioning IAW Department of Defense Financial Management Regulation
       (DoDFMR) Volume 7A), and reinstates payments when commissioning does not occur
       and the Airman returns to duty in the SRB skills, minus unserved days.
   4.4.3. Airmen applied for commissioning program and results not announced. Airmen may
   reenlist and qualify for an SRB, but will not receive the SRB unless non-selected for the
   commissioning program. The following actions must occur:
       4.4.3.1. The MPS must advise member that SRB payment will be suspended pending
       selection/non-selection.
       4.4.3.2. The MPS must notify AFPC to request suspension of the SRB via current
       processing procedures.
       4.4.3.3. AFPC sends case file to DFAS citing Airman is pending selection/non-selection
       for a commissioning program and requests SRB payment suspension.
       4.4.3.4. The MPS must notify AFPC/DPSOAE via current processing procedures when
       results announced to release suspension (non-selected) or terminate SRB (selected).
       4.4.3.5. AFPC/DPSOAE will forward the case file to DFAS and request either release of
       suspension or termination of SRB as appropriate.
AFI36-2606 9 MAY 2011                                                                           23


   4.4.4. Airmen serving in SRB AFSCs who have applied (or within 12 months of applying)
   for a commissioning program or are awaiting selection results and do not have sufficient
   retainability to await the outcome of their selection board may request an extension IAW
   Table 6.1, Rule 28 of this AFI. The extension will not exceed 4 months after the board
   convenes and maximum total extension period is 12 months. The MPS will:
      4.4.4.1. Provide memorandum from the Airman and approved by the commander.
      (Note: Include the board convening date).
      4.4.4.2. Completed AF Form 1411 and cite ―To await OTS results‖ in the remarks.
      4.4.4.3. Counsel Airmen that exercising this option may affect future SRB Zone
      eligibility.
4.5. Zone A Eligibility. Airmen must be eligible according to paragraph 4.3 and all of the
following:

   waiver for retirement that is applicable is for ―hardship‖ as stated in AFI 36-3203, Service
   Retirements.
4.9. Special Conditions. Airmen with exactly 6 years of active duty on the date of reenlistment
or beginning of an extension of enlistment may be paid a Zone A bonus, if otherwise eligible and
if they have not previously received a Zone A bonus. If they have received a Zone A bonus or no

   portion of the bonus will be recouped and future payments terminated.
AFI36-2606 9 MAY 2011                                                                               25


4.10. Eligibility for Retrainees and Retraining-out (Voluntarily/Involuntarily) of SRB
Skills. Airmen attain SRB eligibility when they qualify for and serve in an SRB-designated
skill. When CAREERS retrainees must reenlist in accordance with paragraph 3.6.1.2 or second
term/career Airmen reenlist to obtain retraining retainability, their CAFSCs and retraining-in
AFSCs determine SRB eligibility and the multiple as indicated below:
   4.10.1. Airmen retraining from an SRB skill to another SRB skill with an equal multiple are
   eligible for the SRB at the same multiple.
   4.10.2. Airmen retraining from an SRB skill to another SRB skill with a higher or lower
   multiple are eligible for the SRB at the multiple for the current skill, or the retraining-in skill,
   whichever is lower.
   4.10.3. Airmen are not eligible for the SRB if they are retraining from a non-SRB skill to an
   SRB skill or from an SRB skill to a non-SRB skill.
   4.10.4. Second term/career Airmen retraining into a feeder AFSC are eligible for the SRB at
   the multiple for the current skill or the retraining-in skill, whichever is lower.
   4.10.5. Airmen will not normally be authorized to retrain out of the skill until they have
   completed the contract period for which they received the bonus. Airmen who received an
   SRB are identified by ALC-O.
       4.10.5.1. Voluntary Retraining (not CAREERS) - Airmen with ALC-O may volunteer as
       an ETP to retrain only if they have completed at least 50% of their current enlistment.
       No other request will be considered. AF/A1PF is the approval authority for these types
       of requests. There are several factors that will determine whether requests will be
       approved (manning, career field health, last SRB payment, etc.). If approved all
       unearned portions of the bonus will be recouped and all future/anniversary payments will
       be terminated. AFPC/DPSOAR will notify AFPC/DPSOAE via current processing
       procedures of affected Airmen in order to initiate termination/recoupment actions through
       DFAS.
       4.10.5.2. Involuntary Retraining - AFPC/DPSOAR will make every effort to prevent
       involuntary retraining Airmen with ALC-O. Airmen who are involuntary retrained as a
       result of the NCORP are not required to repay unearned portions of an SRB. However,
       they will not receive any future/anniversary payments. AFPC/DPSOAR will notify
       AFPC/DPSOAE via current processing procedures of affected Airmen in order to initiate
       termination of future payments through DFAS.
4.11. Eligibility for Airmen in Additionally Awarded SRB                         Skills    (Including
CONUS/Overseas Imbalanced SRB Skill into an awarded SRB Skill).
   4.11.1. Airmen with an assignment into an awarded SRB AFSC (other than their current
   CAFSC); or Airmen who are in a special duty and who have an assignment back into their
   SRB- CAFSC may reenlist in the SRB skill provided:
       4.11.1.1. Meet all reenlistment eligibility criteria.
       4.11.1.2. Receive official notification of an assignment into the SRB AFSC.
 26                                                                   AFI36-2606 9 MAY 2011


       4.11.1.3. Reenlist within 90 days of their departure date on Permanent Change of Station
       (PCS) or Permanent Change of Assignment (PCA) into the SRB skill. If they reenlist
       more than 90 days prior to departure, they will reenlist in their current CAFSC and will
       receive the corresponding SRB and multiple (if applicable).
   4.11.2. Airmen may be eligible to delay obtaining required PCS or PCA retainability in
   order to qualify for the SRB IAW Table 6.1, Rule 12, if they have a DOS prior to 90 days
   before the PCS or PCA projected departure date and are otherwise eligible. Also see AFI 36-
   2110, Assignments.
   4.11.3. Airmen can expect to serve in the SRB skills for the entire period of the enlistment.
   4.11.4. Airmen request reenlistment from a special duty back into their CAFSC. MPS
   process requests according to AFCSM 36-699, Military Personnel Flight (MPF)
   Management and Military Personnel Data System (MilPDS) User Guidelines, Volume 1,
   Chapter 3. MPS also advises Airmen regarding eligibility, estimated bonus amount, bonus
   recoupment if not fulfilling the term of enlistment or if not maintaining technical
   qualification, and the possibility of changes to SRB skills and multiples throughout the year.
4.12. Use of SRB Airmen. SRB recipients may not perform duty outside their SRB specialty
for more than 90 consecutive days in a 360 day period. (Note: This does not apply to
deployment taskings. Airmen in SRB skills may be tasked to deploy/fill non-SRB duties without
SRB interruption.)
4.13. Computing SRB Awards.
   4.13.1. Compute all SRB award amounts using one month’s base pay, times the years
   extending/reenlisting, times the SRB multiple. (Note: The Airman’s base pay on date of
   discharge is used to calculate the SRB. Therefore, if SSgt Jones was promoted on 1 May
   2009 and reenlisted on 1 May 2009, the SRB would be calculated on his/her base pay for the
   rank of SrA).
       4.13.1.1. Example of SRB award amount:
       One month’s base pay: $1,000
       Multiplied by 6 (number of years reenlisted): Equals $6,000
       Multiplied by x 3 (SRB multiple for Airman’s AFSC)
       Equals $18,000 (total bonus award)
       Divided by 2 equals $9,000 (50% lump sum initial payment)
       Divided by 5 (remaining number of annual installments)
       Equals $1,800 (equal annual installments)
AFI36-2606 9 MAY 2011                                                                           27


   4.13.2. Airman do not receive SRB for obligated service or any service exceeding 24 years
   TAFMS.
       4.13.2.1. Example of Zone E SRB calculation (when reenlistment will take Airman
       beyond 24 years TAFMS:)

(Note: Airmen will be paid the full years of the Term of Enlistment minus obligated service not
to exceed 24 years TAFMS).
4.14. Method of Payment.
   4.14.1. Initial payment: Airmen receive 50 percent of the total amount (less applicable taxes)
   on the reenlistment date or the day they enter an extension. Airmen with a break in service
   (prior service) of more than 24 hours do not receive payment until 30 days after arrival at the
   first permanent duty station following reenlistment.
   4.14.2. Installment payments: Airmen receive the remaining 50 percent of the SRB amount
   (less applicable taxes) in equal annual amounts on each anniversary of the initial payment for
   the term of the reenlistment or extension. An Airman receives three installment payments for
   a four-year reenlistment, four installment payments for a five-year reenlistment or five
   installment payments for a six-year reenlistment.
 28                                                                     AFI36-2606 9 MAY 2011


   4.14.3. Accelerated payments: Accelerated payments are installment payments made in
   advance of the normal anniversary dates to Airmen who can document that unexpected,
   unusual circumstances of an emergency nature have created or will create an extreme
   financial hardship. Airmen and MPS process accelerated payment cases as follows:
      4.14.3.1. The Airmen will prepare request for accelerated payments and include: copies
      of monthly leave and earning statements; complete documentation of hardship (copies of
      all monthly statements of debts, etc.), complete monthly expenditures that show monthly
      payments and total debts (rent or mortgage payments, electricity, gas, telephone, charge
      accounts, credit union, etc.); and documentation of other income or savings (spouse’s
      monthly income, investments, and other sources).
          4.14.3.1.1. The Airman forward’s the request to his/her unit commander who will
          investigate the request and recommend approval or disapproval. If the commander
          disapproves request, the commander will notify the Airman of the decision. If the
          commander recommends approval, the Airman forwards the request to the MPS.
      4.14.3.2. The MPS will:
          4.14.3.2.1. Review the request and if the Chief, MPS approves, forwards the request
          to AFPC/DPSOAE via current processing procedures for approval or disapproval.
          4.14.3.2.2. If Chief, MPS disapproves request, return package to unit.
      4.14.3.3. Upon receipt AFPC/DPSOAE will:
          4.14.3.3.1. Review the request and if approved, will advise DFAS-IN to issue the
          appropriate payment authorization.
          4.14.3.3.2. Coordinate with AFPC/DPSO on all recommendations for disapproval.
          4.14.3.3.3. Notify the MPS of disapproval via current processing procedures.
4.15. SRB Reduction or Termination Actions.
   4.15.1. Airmen serving in SRB skills announced for reduction or termination must extend or
   reenlist before the effective date of change in order to receive the bonus. (Note: Airmen
   may only reenlist if he/she has a service-directed reason or are within the reenlistment
   window as established by Air Force policy).
   4.15.2. Airmen approved for retraining or who are in a retraining status are only authorized
   the SRB multiple in effect at the time of approved retraining. Airmen whose SRB was
   reduced or terminated since approval for retraining must reenlist/extend (if authorized)
   within 30 calendar days after award of the 3-skill level and enter upgrade training for the next
   higher skill level to qualify for the SRB multiple level in effect when he/she received final
   approval. Failure to reenlist within the prescribed time period will result in loss of eligibility
   for the SRB at the previous multiple. (Note: The Airman must get retraining approval
   before the specialty termination or multiple reduction effective date and the Airman must be
   in the same SRB zone on the date of reenlistment).
   4.15.3. AF/A1PF announces SRB reduction or termination actions. MPS must notify all
   affected reenlistment eligible Airmen.
AFI36-2606 9 MAY 2011                                                                          29


   4.15.4. The MPS will:
       4.15.4.1. Ensure all reenlistment eligible Airmen acknowledge receipt of the
       information, render their option election, request SRB authorizations, and initiate
       reenlistment processing.
       4.15.4.2. Forward the original notification for filing in the ARMS and give the Airman a
       copy. (Note: MPS uses the memorandum in Figure 4.1 when RIPs fail to produce or
       when memorandums are more practical).
       4.15.4.3. When Airmen are TDY, the home station MPS requests the TDY location
       notify and counsel the Airman. The MPS at the TDY location notifies the home station
       MPS of the Airman’s intent and returns the signed notification for file in the ARMS. The
       MPS will refer to AFCSM 36-699, Volume 1, Chapter 3 for reenlistment processing
       requirements.
       4.15.4.4. For all projected reenlistments with an effective date on or after the effective
       date of the SRB listing, verify the SRB multiple against the new listing to see if the SRB
       has changed.
       4.15.4.5. If there is a change to the SRB multiple, correct the Airmen’s AF Form 901,
       Reenlistment Eligibility Annex to DD Form 4 to reflect the correct SRB multiple.
       4.15.4.6. If the SRB has changed, the SRB authorization currently on file in MilPDS
       must be deleted and a new authorization requested.
       4.15.4.7. If an E63/E6C has been accomplished, process an E64/E6D to change the
       projection on DFAS files after the SRB authorization has been changed in MilPDS.
       4.15.4.8. If the Airman’s reenlistment consummated on DFAS files with an incorrect
       SRB entitlement, process the correction to AFPC/DPSOAE via current processing
       procedure.
       4.15.4.9. For each AFSC where the SRB is decreased or deleted, contact all Airmen who
       are otherwise eligible for reenlistment and provide reenlistment options. Ensure
       reenlistment/extension eligible Airmen are aware of the date by which they must reenlist.
       (Note: Do not contact Airmen if not otherwise reenlistment eligible [i.e., outside the
       reenlistment eligibility window]).
4.16. Termination/Recoupment/Repayment of SRB. SRB termination also requires
recoupment of the percentage representing the unserved part of the additional obligated service.
Commanders cannot authorize termination without recoupment.               Airmen must remain
technically qualified for effective performance in the SRB skill and complete the full term of
enlistment or extension of enlistment in the SRB skill. Failure to do so may result in termination
and recoupment. SRB termination/recoupment/repayment will be processed as outlined in the
DoDFMR Volume 7A, Chapter 2.
   4.16.1. The AFPC/CC (AFPC/CD in the absence of the AFPC/CC) on a case-by-case basis,
   is delegated the authority to make repayment determinations consistent with the criteria set
   forth in DODI 1304.29, Administration of Enlistment Bonuses, Accession Bonuses for New
   Officers inCritical Skills, Selective Reenlistment Bonuses, and Critical Skills Retention
   Bonuses for Active Members for Airmen paid a bonus under this instruction.
 30                                                                   AFI36-2606 9 MAY 2011


4.17. SRB AFSC Disqualification. Airmen disqualified from SRB-authorized AFSCs will
have their future payments terminated and recouped, if applicable IAW the DoDFMR.
   4.17.1. AFPC/DPSIDC refers all AFSC disqualification cases (AFI 36-2101, Classifying
   Military Personnel [Officer and Enlisted]) to AFPC/DPSOAE for review/action.
       4.17.1.1. AFPC/DPSOAE will review all cases and refer those with SRB-authorized
       AFSCs to DFAS for termination and recoupment, if applicable IAW the DoDFMR.
       AFPC/DPSOAE will refer cases back to AFPC/DPSIDC when complete or if no SRB
       termination/recoupment action is required.
4.18. Combat Zone Tax Exclusion. The SRB (initial payment and annual installments) are not
taxable for Airmen who reenlist or extend (36 or 48 months) in a month during which they
qualify for combat zone tax exclusion. They must either reenlist or extend in the designated
combat zone, or at another location during the same month in which they served in the
designated combat zone. If the Airman sells leave in conjunction with reenlistment, only leave
days earned while in the deployed location are tax excluded.
4.19. Assignment Limitation Code (ALC)-O and SRBs. Second term and career Airmen
serving in SRB skills must have a SRB updated in MilPDS prior to reenlisting. ALC-O does not
update on second term or career Airmen unless the SRB is updated prior to the reenlistment
being updated. Refer to AFCSM 36-699 for update procedures. (Note: If this code is not
updated, future actions such as retraining, commissioning programs and approval into special
duties are affected).
4.20. SRBs and Airmen Approved for Special Duty/Reporting Identifiers (except
9S000). Airmen are not eligible for an SRB if they reenlist or enter an extension in order to get
required retainability for a special duty or reporting identifier (except 9S000). (Note: Airmen in
SRB AFSCs with approved special duty/reporting identifier (other than 9S000) will reenlist in
the CAFSC of the special duty/reporting identifier AFSC). See paragraph 4.12 for Airmen in
Additionally Awarded SRB Skills (Including CONUS/Overseas Imbalanced SRB Skill into an
awarded SRB Skill).
AFI36-2606 9 MAY 2011                                                                                31

MEMORANDUM FOR (Airman’s Rank/Name)
FROM: MPS /Office Symbol
      Street Address
      Base, State, Zip Code
SUBJECT: Termination/Reduction of Selective Reenlistment Bonus (SRB)
1. Your AFSC has been identified for SRB termination/reduction effective (enter date).
2. In order to receive the SRB at the current rate, you must reenlist (if eligible) before (effective
date), unless you are presently in a retraining status. If you are approved for retraining, or are in
a retraining status, you must reenlist within 30 calendar days after award of the 3-skill level if
otherwise eligible. Eligibility is based on current reenlistment policy in effect at the time.
Failure to reenlist within the prescribed time period will result in loss of eligibility for the SRB at
the previous rate.
3. The SRB list in effect on the date you were approved for retraining applies. If you have
retrained into an SRB AFSC and are currently qualified in the SRB AFSC (awarded 3-skill
level), you must reenlist before (effective date) to receive SRB multiple indicated on the
Retraining Counseling Statement.
4. If you are a Second Term or Career Airman, you may be eligible to extend your enlistment

service-directed requirements, such as PCS retainability. Also, the extension must be for a
period between 36-48 months. You must sign the extension before (effective date). The SRB
will be paid on the date of entry into the extension of enlistment.

                                            Chapter 5

                                       REENLISTMENT

5.1. Eligibility.
   5.1.1. Airmen may be eligible to reenlist if they meet all of the requirements:
       5.1.1.1. Are eligible for immediate reenlistment according to Table 5.1.
       5.1.1.2. Can fill a specific requirement in their skill or another skill through retraining.
       5.1.1.3. Are selected by their commander under the Selective Reenlistment Program
       (SRP) (refer to Chapter 2).
       5.1.1.4. Meet a condition listed in Table 5.7.
       5.1.1.5. To qualify for an SRB is not a reason to reenlist.
   5.1.2. In addition to the above basic eligibility criteria, FTA may reenlist if they have an
   approved CJR and are:
       5.1.2.1. Four-year enlistees with at least 36 consecutive months on their current
       enlistment, are at least in the grade of A1C with 12 months time in grade (TIG) and
       eligible according to Table 5.7. Also see Table 5.5.
       5.1.2.2. Six-year enlistees with at least 60 consecutive months on their current
       enlistment, serving in the grade of SrA or higher and eligible according to Table 5.7.
       Also see Table 5.5.
       5.1.2.3. National Call to Service (NCS) enlistees with at least 36 consecutive months on
       their current enlistment, serving in the grade of A1C/E-3 or higher and eligible according
       to Table 5.7. Also see Table 5.5.
   5.1.3. FTA may reenlist in a retraining status if they are eligible according to Table 5.7,
   complete retraining and possess the 3-skill level in the new AFSC.
   5.1.4. Second term and career Airmen must already possess another awarded AFSC with a
   skill level commensurate with their current grade in order to reenlist in the retraining AFSC
   at the 3-skill level, be within 90 days of ETS or have a service directed reason. (Note:
   Airmen must project reenlistment NLT 120 days prior to their DOS or they will be projected
   for separation).
   5.1.5. The MPS will project all reenlistments in-system upon receipt of approved AF Form
   901, Reenlistment Eligibility Annex to DD Form 4 or no later than 120 days before DOS,
   whichever comes first. Failure to project reenlistment automatically causes MilPDS to
   project the Airman for separation, and will cancel other personnel actions. The MPS will
   refer to AFCSM 36-699, Volume 1, Chapter 3, for procedures for projecting reenlistments
   and requesting CJR/SRB authorizations. (Note: Air Force Reserve (AF Reserve) and Air
   National Guard (ANG) personnel are not authorized to enlist, reenlist, or extend under this
   AFI unless recalled to Extended Active Duty under 10 USC §12301 voluntary or involuntary
   recall. Enlisted personnel who wish to apply under 10 USC §12301(d), voluntary recall,
   must apply through AFPC/DPSOAA Enlisted Accessions. EAD orders will indicate recall
 34                                                                 AFI36-2606 9 MAY 2011


   authority. Contact AFPC/DPSOAA for guidance and instructions or refer to AFI 36-2002,
   Regular Air Force and Special Category Accessions).
5.2. Term of Reenlistment.
   5.2.1. Term of Enlistment (TOE). The minimum TOE is four years unless the Airman has
   more than 24 months of obligated service or is reenlisting to reach High Year Tenure
   (HYT). Under no circumstances will the reenlistment, along with combined obligated
   service exceed 72 months or exceed the Airman’s HYT plus 1 month.
      5.2.1.1. Airmen do not have the option to add additional months to the reenlistment
      contract (refer to Table 5.7, Authorized Terms of Enlistment). Regardless of the number
      of years authorized, a reenlistee’s new DOS must always equal or exceed the previous
      DOS. (Note: An Airman may only reenlist for 6 years if they are within 29 calendar days
      of DOS. Similarly, Airmen can reenlist for 5 years only if they have 12 months or less of
      obligated service).
      5.2.1.2. If an Airman has between 25 and 36 months of remaining obligated service, they
      can reenlist for 3 years plus obligated service.
      5.2.1.3. Airmen reenlisting to reach their HYT may not exceed their HYT month. For
      Airmen reenlisting to HYT who are eligible for an SRB, their SRB will be calculated
      based only on TOE years (must be a minimum of 3 years). If the TOE is less than 3
      years, the Airman is ineligible for an SRB. Also see Table 5.6.
      5.2.1.4. Airmen with more than 36 months of obligated service are not authorized to
      reenlist.
   5.2.2. Annotate the TOE on the DD Form 4/1, Enlistment/Reenlistment Document – Armed
   Forces of the United States, section 8 to reflect the TOE in years and months. (Note: The
   MPS must line through ―weeks‖ and type in ―months.‖ Annotate the number of months
   needed to satisfy the full enlistment. The Airman will initial the change to the reenlistment
   document).
   5.2.3. Obligated service. Includes remaining obligated service (in excess of 29 calendar
   days) into the reenlistment.
      5.2.3.1. Obligated service is that time in excess of 29 calendar days from the Date of
      Enlistment (DOE) to the Date of Separation (DOS). Any partial month of 29 calendar
      days or less will not be considered in the total obligated service.
      5.2.3.2. SrA who cannot reenlist to their HYT may be eligible to extend under Table 6.1,
      Rule 27.
   5.2.4. Constructive Reenlistments. The Chief, Operations Division, Air Force Personnel
   Center is delegated authority to approve a constructive reenlistment when determined a
   constructive reenlistment is appropriate (i.e., for Airmen to reach his/her HYT) under the
   authority of 10 USC 1552 (a) (2) without consideration by the Air Force Board for
   Correction of Military Records. (Department of Defense Instruction 1332.41, Boards for
   Correction of Military Records (BCMRs) and Discharge Review Boards (DRBs); USC 1552.
      5.2.4.1. Airmen submit these requests through his/her commander to AFPC/DPSOAE
      for review/processing.
AFI36-2606 9 MAY 2011                                                                           35


       5.2.4.2. For example: I request a constructive reenlistment to obtain 13 months
       retainability to retire at my HYT. I am ineligible to reenlist based on HYT and I cannot
       extend since I have already extended 42 months of the 48-month maximum.
   5.2.5. Airmen scheduled for reenlistment within 7 calendar days of their DOS, must
   complete the following statement during reenlistment processing: "I intend to reenlist
   immediately after separation. I hereby authorize my retention in service for a period not to
   exceed 7 calendar days beyond my date of separation (DOS), to complete separation
   processing, should I, immediately before or after separation, and before reenlistment,
   decline to reenlist." Retain this statement with the reenlistment package until reenlistment
   occurs. Airmen may not request reenlistment once they enter the 7-calendar day extension
   period; this extension is for separation processing only. Do not complete AF Form 1411 for
   this extension, and do not complete this statement for Airmen scheduled to reenlist more than
   7 calendar days before their DOS.
5.3. CAREERS/NCORP Retrainees. Airmen who retrained under CAREERS/NCORP may
request cancellation of an extension obtained for retraining that has not been entered contingent
upon immediate reenlistment. Airmen must be reenlistment eligible IAW paragraph 5.1 and may
only request cancellation of the extension within 30 days after class grad date. Airmen who ask
for cancellation after 30 days must submit an ETP to have their request granted. All other
extensions will be considered as obligated service. See paragraph 5.1 for reenlistment eligibility.
(Note: Extension cancellation and reenlistment must occur the same date).
   5.3.1. The MPS will:
       5.3.1.1. Ensure extension has not been entered and the cancellation is within 30 days
       after class graduation.
       5.3.1.2. Ensure only the extension authorized for CAREERS/NCORP retraining is
       cancelled. (Example 1: Airmen extends 23 months for CAREERS/NCORP retraining; all
       23 months may be forgiven if not entered). (Example 2: Airman extends 7 months for an
       assignment and 16 months for CAREERS retraining, only the 16 months for CAREERS
       retraining could be forgiven if not entered).
       5.3.1.3. Complete Section VIII of the AF Form 1411, Extension or Cancellation of
       Extension of Enlistment in the Regular Air Force/Air Force Reserve/Air National Guard.
       5.3.1.4. Project the reenlistment in MilPDS and cancel the extension upon receipt for
       completed reenlistment documents.
       5.3.1.5. Extensions obtained for CAREERS/NCORP retraining that has been entered will
       not be forgiven and will be considered as obligated service. Airmen will reenlist under
       the rules of this AFI.
5.4. Reenlistment Ceremony. Commanders will honor all reenlistees through a dignified
reenlistment ceremony, without special gimmicks or publicity stunts. MPS will refer
questionable cases to AFPC/DPSOAE.
 36                                                                   AFI36-2606 9 MAY 2011


   5.4.1. Airmen may request any commissioned officer (active, reserve, guard or retired) to
   perform the ceremony and invite guests. The reenlistee and the officer administering the
   oath must be physically collocated during the ceremony. Reenlistments can be conducted on
   any day of the year. Conduct the ceremony in any place that lends dignity to the event. The
   US flag must form a backdrop for the participants.
   5.4.2. Reenlistee and reenlisting officer must wear an authorized uniform for the ceremony.
   (Exception: The uniform requirement is optional for retired officers).
5.5. Who May Administer the Oath of Enlistment. The oath may be taken before the
President, the Vice-President, the Secretary of Defense, any commissioned officer, or any other
person designated under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense. Active duty,
reserve, guard or retired commissioned officers of the US Armed Forces may administer the
oath. Officers who resigned their commissions, and were transferred to the Obligated Reserve
Section (ORS) or the Nonaffiliated Reserve Section (NARS), may not administer the oath.
(Exception: Commissioned warrant officers in the grade of CW2, CW3 and CW4 may also
administer the oath).
5.6. Active Duty Oath of Enlistment. All Airmen enlisting or reenlisting must take the
following oath:
―I, (State your full name), do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the
Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true
faith and allegiance to the same; and that I will obey the orders of the President of the United
States and the orders of the officers appointed over me, according to regulations and the Uniform
Code of Military Justice. So help me God.‖ (Note: Airmen may omit the words ―So help me
God‖, if desired for personal reasons).
5.7. Processing and Place of Reenlistment. Airmen must reenlist at their home station unless
they are absent due to deployment, hospitalization or are in a pipeline status (school, overseas
returnee, etc). Airmen must be present for duty and will not reenlist while on leave, while in a
separation status or after departing their unit of assignment on terminal leave for separation.
   5.7.1. MPS gives Airmen departing on deployment a reenlistment package if they desire to
   reenlist and their ETS or DOS will expire while deployment. The package will include, at a
   minimum, the new DD Form 4/1 and 4/2, Enlistment/Reenlistment Document-Armed Forces
   of the United States and the Airman’s copy of the AF Form 1089, Leave Settlement Option.
       5.7.1.1. The home station MPS:
           5.7.1.1.1. Obtains the Airman’s signature on AF Form 901, Section III.
           5.7.1.1.2. Retains the forms and ensures the commander completes Section IV.
           (Exception: If the commander will be the on-site commander at the deployed
           location, include the AF Form 901 in the reenlistment package. The Personnel
           Support for Contingency Operations (PERSCO) at the deployed location will assist
           the reenlistee).
           5.7.1.1.3. Coordinates with the MPS at the deployed location to ensure proper
           completion of the reenlistment documents.
AFI36-2606 9 MAY 2011                                                                         37


   5.7.2. The MPS/PERSCO at the deployed location:
       5.7.2.1. Gives the Airman their copy of the DD Form 4/1 and AF Form 901, if more than
       30 calendar days will expire between the reenlistment date and the date the Airman will
       return to home station.
       5.7.2.2. Mail all remaining copies to the home station MPS for final processing.
5.8. Reenlistment Documents. The completed DD Form 4 and the AF Form 901 formally
document a reenlistment and represent a legally binding contract between the Air Force and
reenlistee. The MPS completes the DD Form 4 IAW DODI 1304.02, Accessions Processing
Data Collection Forms and AF Form 901 IAW current Air Force guidance. The information
contained hereon and any associated annexes becomes a part of the Airman’s military personnel
record and is used to document specific pay, enlistment bonuses, incentives, promotion,
assignment and reassignment, training, medical support and other personnel management
actions. Incomplete or inaccurate documents are returned to the Airman’s servicing MPS for
corrections or re-accomplishment and can result in an erroneous reenlistment agreement,
possible loss of payment of SRB entitlement, etc. Any unauthorized/erroneous SRB will
necessitate re-accomplishment of the reenlistment/extension documents and will be terminated
and recouped.
   5.8.1. Special care shall be taken to ensure all items are completed correctly without errors.
   White-out or correction tape or fluid shall not be used on these forms. Corrections in items
   2, 5, 8, 18b, 19b and 19f will necessitate the deletions and re-creation of the DD Form 4.
   5.8.2. The forms shall only be signed in black, blue or blue-black ink when completed
   manually (non-digitally signed).
5.9. Reenlistment Agreements. The MPS documents only approved/authorized Air Force
reenlistment agreements on AF Form 901. (Note: All reenlistment agreements must be
identified on the AF Form 901. If the Airman has no reenlistment agreement(s), the MPS will
mark the block indicating no reenlistment agreement(s).
   5.9.1. Authorize only the following guarantees on AF Form 901:
       5.9.1.1. Approved retraining.
       5.9.1.2. Approved Airman for training program that leads to an Air Force commission.
       5.9.1.3. Approved Base of Preference (BOP) or in-place BOP (for FTA only).
       5.9.1.4. Other approved agreements authorized by current Air Force reenlistment policy.
       (Note: The MPS will specify the approved agreement in the area provided).
5.10. Discharge for the Purpose of Immediate Reenlistment. Discharge always occurs before
Airmen reenlist. However, the discharge is conditional because it is without effect if the Airman
does not reenlist within 24 hours. MPS will not give the completed AF Form 901 to the Airman
until reenlistment occurs. Do not use the AF Form 901 for prior service enlistments or for
former officer entering the Air Force in enlisted status. (Note: Commanders or civilian directors
holding the position may not refuse to sign AF Form 901, Section IV and then permit Airman to
remain otherwise eligible for reenlistment. In such cases commanders will immediately notify
the MPS of the specific circumstances in writing and submit the required documentation (AF
Form 418, etc.) within 7 calendar days).
 38                                                                   AFI36-2606 9 MAY 2011


   5.10.1. The AF Form 901, Section V, documents discharge for the purpose of immediate
   reenlistment.
   5.10.2. The Chief, MPS or designated representative authenticates the AF Form 901, Section
   V. Designated representatives must be assigned to the MPS or GSU personnel function and
   in the grade of TSgt, GS-6, or higher.
   5.10.3. MPS ensures the commander or civilian director holding the position documents
   certification on AF Form 901, Section IV, and returns them in time for authentication on or
   before the discharge date (refer to Table 5.6, step 8). (Note: DD Form 256AF, Honorable
   Discharge Certificate will not be issued to Airmen to be discharged for the purpose of
   immediate reenlistment within 24 hours).
5.11. Leave Settlement. Airmen may sell a maximum of 60 days accrued leave during their
career. Accrued leave may be sold upon reenlistment or entering into the first extension of
enlistment, to include subsequent reenlistments. The Airman’s base pay on date of discharge
determines the payment. Airmen document their leave sell option (each reenlistment and first
extension of enlistment) on an AF Form 1089. MPS ensures Airman documents any changes on
a new AF Form 1089. MPS will refer to AFCSM 36-699, Volume 1, Chapter 3 for DJMS-AC
update instructions.
   5.11.1. Airmen may change their leave settlement election provided:
       5.11.1.1. Airmen extending must do so NLT 10 calendar days prior to entering into the
       extension of enlistment.
       5.11.1.2. Airmen reenlisting must do so at any time before they reenlist.
5.12. Informed Decision (ID) Program. The Career Assistance Advisors (CAA) at every
installation will publicize and conduct an ID seminar. This seminar is an educational experience
specifically designed to enhance one’s knowledge of Air Force benefits, highlight program
requirements and processes. All first term and second term Airmen are required to attend unless
pending involuntary separation. See AFI 36-2624, The Career Assistance Advisor, First Term
Airmen Center and Enlisted Professional Enhancement Programs.
5.13. Airmen Reenlisting for the Purpose of Obtaining an Air Force
Commission. Publications governing selection for a program leading to an Air Force
commission take precedence over reenlistment restrictions imposed by this publication.
   5.13.1. Airmen may reenlist to get the service retainability required for the particular
   commissioning program. This includes FTA who have not completed 36 months TAFMS on
   their current enlistment (60 months for 6-year enlistees).
   5.13.2. MPS updates reenlistment eligibility (RE) code 3A for FTA selected for Air Force
   commissioning programs who have not reached the SRP consideration point. MPS updates
   RE code 1J for all other Airmen selected for commissioning programs. (Note: MPS cannot
   update RE code 1J or 3A until the Airman is projected for separation).
   5.13.3. Refer to paragraph 4.4 for restrictions pertaining to Airmen serving in SRB skills.
AFI36-2606 9 MAY 2011                                                                           39


5.14. Reenlistment of Non-US Citizens. Non-US citizens, enlisting on or after 1 November
1982, must become US citizens during their initial enlistment before they are eligible to reenlist.
Airmen may be eligible to extend under paragraph 6.5.4. (Exception: Citizens of Micronesia
and Palau may be eligible for reenlistment even if they do not have their citizenship. These cases
will be worked through AFPC/DPSOAE to AF/A1PF for approval). Non-US citizens who
obtain US citizenship and whose RE code is 2I must have SRP consideration completed to
remove the RE code of 2I and reenlist. Non-US citizens who fail to obtain US citizenship during
their initial enlistment will separate with RE code 2I.
5.15. Reenlistment of Sole Surviving Sons or Daughters. Airmen who qualify as sole
surviving sons or daughters waive any right to claim discharge or assignment limitations as sole
surviving sons or daughters upon their reenlistment. They may request reinstatement of their
sole survivor status through assignments at any time. If approved, they may again qualify for
assignment limitation, but not for discharge or release from active duty.
5.16. Identifying and Notifying Reenlistment-Ineligible Airmen. MPS uses the SRP roster to
identify first term, second term and career Airmen ineligible to reenlist. MPS sends the
commander a monthly list of ineligible Airmen for informational purposes only.
5.17. High Year of Tenure (HYT) and Age 55 Restrictions. The reenlistment terms outlined
in Table 5.7 prevent Airmen from violating the HYT and age 55 restrictions discussed below.
Request for HYT adjustments/corrections will be sent to AFPC/DPSOR or AFPC/DPSOS via
current processing procedures. (Note: Under no circumstances will any reenlistment or
extension exceed the Airman’s HYT.).
   5.17.1. Airmen with a HYT date of 20 or more years TAFMS may not reenlist if their new
   DOS will exceed the month following their HYT date; however, they may qualify for an
   extension of enlistment to establish a DOS at HYT (refer to paragraph 6.13 and Table 6.1).
   5.17.2. First Term Airmen may not reenlist if the new DOS will exceed the year and month
   during which they will reach HYT. Also see paragraph 5.17.2.2. However, they may qualify
   for an extension of enlistment to establish a DOS at HYT (refer to paragraph 6.13.1 and
   Table 6.1). This restriction does not affect SrA with 16 or more years TAFMS. These
   Airmen may receive an HYT date of at least 20 years TAFMS.
       5.17.2.1. SSgts may not reenlist if the new DOS will exceed the year and month during
       which they will reach HYT. Also see paragraph 5.17.2.2. However, they may qualify for
       an extension of enlistment to establish a DOS at HYT (refer to paragraph 6.13.1 and
       Table 6.1). This restriction does not affect SSgt with 16 or more years TAFMS. These
       Airmen may receive an HYT date of at least 20 years TAFMS.
       5.17.2.2. Reenlistment eligible FTA in SRB skills authorized to receive a Zone A SRB,
       may reenlist for periods exceeding their HYT date, provided the reenlistment occurs
       before they complete 6 years TAFMS and don’t establish a DOS exceeding 10 years
       TAFMS. See paragraph 4.5 for additional eligibility criteria.
       5.17.2.3. Airmen in the grade of TSgt authorized to receive a Zone E SRB, may reenlist
       for periods exceeding their HYT dates, provided the reenlistment authorizes the Airman
       the Zone E SRB and don’t establish a DOS exceeding 22 years TAFMS. See paragraph
       4.8 for additional eligibility criteria.
 40                                                                   AFI36-2606 9 MAY 2011


       5.17.2.4. Critical Skills Retention Bonus (CSRB) – For Airmen authorized a CSRB, the
       HYT reduction policy is waived for TSgts and MSgts who accept the CSRB, up to 25
       years of service only. The HYT will be adjusted to 25 years after the CSRB contract is
       processed.
   5.17.3. Airmen may not reenlist if the new DOS exceeds the month following their 55th
   birthday month. Airmen must get an approved waiver in order to reenlist for a period that
   exceeds the month following their 55th birthday month. (Exception: Airmen may reenlist for
   a period that permits them to serve at least 20 years TAFMS. Approved HYT waivers also
   constitute waivers of the age 55 restriction).

   5.17.4. For HYT waivers for CMSgts (and Chief selects), refer to the Chief’s Handbook for
   instructions and requirements.
       5.17.4.1. For HYT waivers for SMSgts and below, contact AFPC/DPSOR or
       AFPC/DPSOS for instructions and additional information/processing instructions and
       requirements.
       5.17.4.2. AFPC/DPSOR or AFPC/DPSOS will advise the MPS of approved/disapproved
       waivers via current processing procedures.
   5.17.5. Airmen removed from the Temporary Disability Retirement List (TDRL) may not
   reenlist for a period that violates the HYT and age 55 restrictions, unless otherwise directed.

5.18. Air Force Fitness Program, Airmen Medically Disqualified and Airmen in Reporting
Identifier (RI) 9A000/9A100/9A200/9A300. Commanders may review and determine
reenlistment eligibility for Airmen who are in the poor category for less than 6 months and will
review and determine reenlistment eligibility for all Airmen who remain in the poor category for
6 months or more.
   5.18.1. Successfully reaching good fit category does not automatically restore reenlistment
   eligibility. The commander may remove the reenlistment ineligibility condition by
   completing an AF Form 418 or continue the ineligibility until after the Airman’s next fitness
   test. See paragraph 2.6 through 2.7. The commander documents the decision on AF Form
   108, Fitness Program Improvement Processing. Ineligible Airmen (RE code 4J) requiring
   retainability to reach the good fit category may request an extension of enlistment according
   to Table 6.1, Rule 18. If eligibility for reenlistment is denied, Airmen will be placed in RE
   Code 2X and will not be eligible to extend or reenlist (except to appeal the non-selection). If
   the Airman is later made reenlistment eligible then the commander will complete an AF
   Form 418 and the MPS or equivalent will update the RE code to a more applicable code.
   Refer to AFI 10-248, Fitness Program for additional information.
AFI36-2606 9 MAY 2011                                                                          41


   5.18.2. Airmen in RE code 4K may not reenlist when pending evaluation by a Medical
   Evaluation Board (MEB) or Physical Evaluation Board (PEB) unless waiver is approved.
   See Table 5.5, Item 2.
       5.18.2.1. Airmen in RE code 4K may voluntarily extend their enlistment under Table 6.1
       Rule 9 of this AFI. Limit extensions to a period outlined/recommended by the PCM, not
       to exceed a maximum 24 months. See Chapter 6.
   5.18.3. All Airmen disqualified from their AFSC and in RI of 9A000, 9A100, 9A200 or
   9A300 are updated to RE code 4G. Commanders may not waive Airmen in RE code 4G to
   permit reenlistment unless the Airman has been selected and approved for retraining or
   Special Duty. In these cases the commander will take action as outlined in paragraph 2.6 and
   2.7.
       5.18.3.1. Airmen disqualified and in RI 9A000 or 9A100 may execute a one-time
       extension in order to remain on active duty for a total period of 12 months to
       qualify/compete for retraining/Special Duty. Under no circumstances will the extension
       period combined with the remaining obligated service exceed 12 months. The length of
       the extension, if any is based on the date of the formal disqualification approval not to
       exceed 12 months. Airmen will extend IAW Table 5.1, Rule 28 of this AFI. If the
       Airman is not approved for retraining or Special Duty during this period, he/she will
       separate on their DOS.
       5.18.3.2. Airmen in RI 9A200/9A300 will remain in RE code 4G and separate on DOS
       unless the commander initiates early separation or subsequently completes retention
       versus separation package and retain the Airman.
5.19. Erroneous Reenlistment Documents and Enlistment Documents Returned for
Correction. This paragraph applies to the DD Form 4 and AF Form 901. There are two types
of erroneous reenlistment documents. The first consists of contractual errors made in violation
of this publication, such as the reenlistment of ineligible Airmen or Airmen not issued a CJR and
erroneous or incorrect SRB. Only AFPC/DPSOAE authorizes correction of contractual errors.
MPS will not remove or delete executed reenlistments documents from any system of record
without prior approval from AFPC/DPSOAE. (Note: Executed documents are finalized
contracts where the Airman has taken the oath of enlistment, both parties have signed the DD
Form 4, Section E and the MPS has received the document for update in the system of record).
The second is administrative, involving typographical errors, strikeovers, misspellings, erroneous
computation of required retainability, etc.
   5.19.1. Contractual Errors. The MPS processes a case file to AFPC/DPSOAE according to
   the following guidance. The Airman will:
       5.19.1.1. Complete and sign a memorandum which must include their SSAN and
       outlines the facts of the situation as well as their desires.
       5.19.1.2. Route the memorandum through their commander for signature.
       5.19.1.3. Forward the signed memorandum to the MPS for further action.
   5.19.2. The MPS will:
       5.19.2.1. Review the memorandum and ensure it contains all required data.
42                                                                AFI36-2606 9 MAY 2011


     5.19.2.2. The MPS Career Development Section will have the memorandum endorsed by
     the Chief, MPS.
     5.19.2.3. Once the memorandum is completed, the MPS Career Development Section
     will scan all documents and email the memorandum, the reenlistment contract, and
     current AAD005 SURF, to AFPC/DPSOAE for approval/disapproval.
  5.19.3. AFPC/DPSOAE will:
     5.19.3.1. AFPC/DPSOAE resolves each case in the Air Force's best interest and will
     either declare the contract valid or erroneous and without effect.
     5.19.3.2. The MPS will be notified via current processing procedures of the
     approval/disapproval.
     5.19.3.3. The Airman may petition the AFBCMR if they do not agree with the final
     decision.
  5.19.4. Administrative Errors. MPS will not correct administrative errors discovered in
  items 2, 5, 8, 18b, 19b and 19f of the DD Form 4. Administrative errors in these items will
  necessitate the deletions and re-creation of the DD Form 4. Also see paragraph 5.19.5.3.1.
  Administrative errors (non-SRB related) may be corrected on the AF Form 901, if the
  Airman and Air Force agree. Any unauthorized/erroneous SRB will necessitate re-
  accomplishment of the document(s) and will be terminated and recouped. The MPS will
  process case files according to paragraph 5.19.1 and 5.19.2 when there is disagreement. If
  the Airman and Air Force agree, the MPS makes corrections on all copies of the forms before
  distribution, or on the ARMS copy after distribution and initial each correction. If the
  corrections were made on the forms, stamp ―Corrected Copy‖ in the upper margin of the
  corrected pages and make a photocopy of the corrected forms for the Airman. The MPS
  corrects MilPDS and DJMS-AC, as appropriate and distributes the documents IAW Table
  5.8.
  5.19.5. Documents Returned to MPS for Correction(s). AFPC/DPSOAE will return
  enlistment contracts for correction (Example: Missing signatures, when dates don’t match
  reenlistment date on DD Form 4 and/or AF Form 901, incomplete contracts, missing pages,
  or incomplete forms, etc.) to servicing Chief, MPSs for action. The MPS will make
  appropriate corrections to the contract(s) and return the contracts and transmittal to
  AFPC/DPSOAE by the established suspense. Also see paragraph 5.19.4.
     5.19.5.1. The Airman and the MPS representatives must initial each correction. Stamp
     ―CORRECTED COPY‖ in the upper margin of the corrected pages. Make a photo copy
     of the corrected forms and comply with the disposition instructions in Table 5.8.
     5.19.5.2. Do not make corrections to the form stamped ―DO NOT CORRECT THIS
     COPY‖ unless there is no ARMS copy and the Airman does not have a copy.
         5.19.5.2.1. In those situations, correct the copy stamped ―DO NOT CORRECT THIS
         COPY‖ and type ―Only Available Copy‖ in the upper margin of the corrected pages.
         Make a photo copy of the corrected forms and comply with the disposition
         instructions in Table 5.8.
AFI36-2606 9 MAY 2011                                                                          43


       5.19.5.3. Reaccomplish the DD Form 4/1 and AF Form 901, if there is no, ARMS copy
       or the Airman does not have a copy. (Note: The Airman’s current commander or
       civilian director holding the position will sign the corrected form(s) and the current date
       will be used).
           5.19.5.3.1. If contract must be reaccomplished, stamp ―RECONSTRUCTED COPY‖
           in the upper margin of the new contract. The forms will be dated using the current
           date and signed by the Airman’s current commander. Make a photo copy of the
           corrected forms and comply with the disposition instructions in Table 5.8. (Note:
           Commanders may not refuse to re-accomplish these documents or deny reenlistment).
           5.19.5.3.2. The MPS sends the original documents to AFPC/DPSOAE for review as
           outlined in Table 5.8 and corrects MilPDS and DJMS-AC, as appropriate.
5.20. Reenlistment Eligibility (RE) Codes. Accurate RE codes are vital to ensure the Air
Force retains and reenlists only those Airmen selected for continued service and prevents
ineligible Airmen from continued service. The MPS will update, monitor, and maintain accurate
RE codes in MilPDS. Incorrect codes can prevent or allow the selection of Airmen for
reenlistment, promotion, separation, retirement and reassignment. The MPS will:
   5.20.1. Update RE codes in MilPDS using the following hierarchy: 2#, 4#, 3#, and 1#.
   (Note: No RE code will take precedence over RE codes in 2#, to include pending MEB/PEB.
   MPS will re-update RE code to ―2#‖ in such cases.
   5.20.2. Update the appropriate RE code according to the hierarchy in paragraph 5.20.1 in
   MilPDS when two or more RE codes apply.
   5.20.3. Update the appropriate RE code with the longest duration in MilPDS when two or
   more RE codes in the same series apply.
   5.20.4. Leave RE code 2X in MilPDS unless SRP selection occurs or RE code 2X is being
   replaced by a higher priority code.
   5.20.5. Verify RE codes in MilPDS NLT 60 days for all Airmen separating. Incorrect or
   inappropriate RE codes will be corrected as required. Refer requests for corrections to
   AFPC/DPSOAE via current processing procedures. (Note: See Tables 5.1 - 5.4).
5.21. Waiver of Reenlistment Ineligibility Conditions (Lost Time and Civil Court
Convictions). Airmen may request waivers to reenlist or extend to their unit commander
because they have 5 or more days lost time, or have a civil court conviction (Table 5.4, item 5 or
13). (Note: Civil court convictions automatically render Airmen ineligible for the length of the
maximum allowable Manual for Courts Martial (MCM) confinement period for the same or most
closely related offenses. The MPS must contact the base legal office to determine the MCM
confinement period).
   5.21.1. Airmen must request a waiver to reenlist or extend. The Airman’s supervisor will
   complete an AF Form 418, Selective Reenlistment Program Consideration. Refer to
   paragraph 2.6 through 2.8 for processing the AF Form 418.
       5.21.1.1. If the waiver is approved, the commander ensures the Airman acknowledges
       receipt, and then sends the AF Form 418 to the MPS for processing. The MPS updates
       RE code 1A (can only be updated immediately before Airman reenlists or extends) and
       sends the waiver for file in ARMS.
 44                                                                   AFI36-2606 9 MAY 2011


           5.21.1.1.1. When Airmen receive approved waivers and reenlist, the reenlistment
           ineligibility condition no longer applies.
           5.21.1.1.2. When Airmen receive approved waivers to extend their enlistment, the
           MPS will re-update the ineligibility conditions after updating the extension. Waivers
           are only valid for one extension.
           5.21.1.1.3. When Airmen elect separation after receiving approved waivers, the MPS
           re-update the ineligibility condition, unless a higher priority code applies.
    5.21.2. If disapproved, the commander ensures Airman acknowledges receipt. The Airman
    may elect to appeal the disapproval decisions. Process the appeal as outlined in paragraph
    2.10 through 2.11.
5.22. Prisoners Returned to Duty Program (RTDP). A returned prisoner is an Airman
sentenced by court martial to a dishonorable or bad conduct discharge (including those whose
sentences didn’t include confinement) which was suspended or remitted, or an Airman sentenced
to a period of confinement, with or without discharge, and later returned to duty from a DoD
regional confinement facility under the direction of AFSFC/SFC. Returned prisoners cannot
reenlist unless they serve at least 6 months after returning to duty, are otherwise eligible, and
their unit commanders select them for reenlistment under the SRP or approve reenlistment
waivers (refer to paragraph 5.21).

 3       receiving a PCS assignment that requires       FTA who is unable to extend to
         the Airman to reenlist immediately             qualify for the assignment. (The
         following completion of technical school       Chief, MPS at the technical training
         retraining;                                    location is the approval authority for

 NOTES:
 1. Update RE code 1A in MilPDS before executing the extension or reenlistment. RE code
 1A is only applicable to FTA who previously had an approved CJR and the CJR was later
 suspended. FTA who did not receive an approved CJR during their CJR window are
 ineligible to request a CJR while holding RE code 1A and; therefore, cannot reenlist.
 Remove RE code 1A from MilPDS immediately following update of the extension or
 immediately following the Airman’s reenlistment (refer to paragraph 4.20.) and update to a
 more applicable RE code.
 2. Airman must meet all other eligibility requirements for reenlistment or an extension of
 enlistment.
 3. The commander may waive two or more ineligibility conditions at the same time, but
 must waive all conditions. The commander may not grant a waiver to any Airman who
 possesses another ineligibility condition for which there is no waiver provision.

4. An Airman who has lost time or has been in confinement is not eligible to extend until
their lost time has been computed and corrected.
5. To qualify, the Airman must be currently performing in the SRB skills (C/DAFSC), must
not be assigned in a patient status (9P000), medical condition must be stable as determined
by medical authorities and otherwise be eligible to reenlist. The Airman/commander will
submit the following documents to the MPS:
a. Commander recommendation: Certifying the Airman is performing duties within the
AFSC and specify any duties the Airman is unable to perform (if applicable).
b. Primary Care Memorandum (PCM): PCMs assess the Airman’s capabilities and
limitations with respect to performing core task within his/her AFSC, state whether the
Airman’s condition is stable and prognosis for continued improvement.
c. Provide Business Case Analysis: Describe how the Airman’s utilization within the AFSC
fills valid Unit Manning Document (UMD) requirement and benefits the overall community.
d. Waiver processing procedures: The MPS will review the case file for completeness and
return all incomplete requests to the unit. Complete case files will be forwarded to
AFPC/DPSOAE via current processing procedures. AFPC will review for completeness and
forwards to AF/A1PF. AF/A1PF will obtain Functional Manager (FM) and Career Field
Manager (CFM) recommendation and obtain AF/A1 review and final determination.
AF/A1PF notifies appropriate parties of the final decision. The MPS will advise the unit
commander on the final decision. If approved to reenlist through the waiver process, the RE
code 4K will be temporarily removed to allow update of the reenlistment, but the MPS will
re-update the Re code to 4K once the reenlistment consummates. (Note: In all cases,
Airmen will retain the RE code 4K until medically cleared for duty).
6. To qualify, the Airman must be currently performing in the AFSC (C/DAFSC), must not
be assigned in a patient status (9P000), medical condition must be stable as determined by

d. Waiver processing procedures: The MPS will review the case file for completeness and
return all incomplete requests to the unit. Complete case files will be forwarded to the
FSS/CC for approval/disapproval. If approved to reenlist through the waiver process, the RE
code 4K will be temporarily removed to allow update of the reenlistment, but the MPS will
re-update the RE code to 4K once the reenlistment consummates. (Note: In all cases,
Airmen will retain the RE code 4K until medically cleared for duty).

                 reenlisting and the combination must not exceed 6 years (72 months).
                 3. If an Airman has between 25 and 36 months of remaining obligated
                 service, they can reenlist for 3 years.
                 4. Current HYT rules apply.
                 5. Airmen with more than 36 months of obligated service are NOT
                 authorized to reenlist.
                 6. All Airmen reenlist IAW rules 1 - 3 above and may later extend as needed
                 to reach HYT month per Table 6.1, Rule 27 (separation) or Table 6.1, Rule 3
                 (retirement). Paragraph 5.2.1.1 applies.

                                          Chapter 6

                              EXTENSIONS OF ENLISTMENT

6.1. Extension Approval Authority. AFPC/DPSOAE reserves authority to approve extensions
of enlistment under certain conditions specified in Table 6.1. Otherwise, base-level officials
resolve all requests for extensions and extension cancellation. (Note: Air Force Reserve [AFR]
and Air National Guard [ANG] personnel are not authorized to enlist, reenlist, or extend under
this AFI unless recalled to Extended Active Duty under 10 USC §12301 voluntary or involuntary
recall. Enlisted personnel who wish to apply under 10 USC §12301[d], voluntary recall, must
apply through AFPC/DPSOAA Enlisted Accessions. EAD orders will indicate recall authority.
Contact AFPC/DPSOAA for guidance and instructions or refer to AFI 36-2002).
   6.1.1. The Chief, MPS or their designated representatives may approve or disapprove
   extension or extension cancellation requests (AF Form 1411). Designated representatives
   must be assigned to the MPS or GSU personnel functions, and possess the grade of TSgt,
   GS-6, or higher. The MPS ensures the commander holding the position is on G-series orders
   and documents their recommendation on the AF Form 1411, Section VI.
   6.1.2. Personnel specified in paragraph 6.1.1 will review extensions executed for the sole
   purpose of mobility or deployment exercises. (Note: Do not update extensions in MilPDS
   produced for the sole purpose of an exercise).
   6.1.3. If deployment occurs, MPS updates these extensions in MilPDS and distributes the
   forms according to Table 5.8. If deployment does not occur, MPS destroys the AF Form
   1411 at the end of the exercise.
6.2. Extension Limitations.
   6.2.1. The MPS will limit extensions to the minimum number of months needed to achieve
   the intended purpose. Airmen extend in whole month periods only. Only Airmen in SRB
   AFSCs may extend for 36 or 48 months to qualify for an authorized SRB even though less
   retainability is required. When enlistments or reenlistments begin on the first day of a
   month, the extended DOS is always the last day of the month). (Example: If Airman’s date
   of enlistment is 1 May, and the DOS is 30 April, then a 1-month extension would result in a
   31 May DOS).
   6.2.2. Voluntary extensions for all Airmen are limited to a maximum of 48 months per
   enlistment. In the event AFSCs are constrained, Air Staff may limit FTA extensions to a
   specified period. (Note: Otherwise, there is no limit to the number of valid extensions.
   Involuntary extensions (for example, extensions for STOP LOSS and
   administrative/disciplinary hold) do not count towards the maximum number of months an
   Airman can extend). See paragraph 6.16.
   6.2.3. Refer to paragraph 6.13 for information on HYT and age 55 extension restrictions.
   6.2.4. The MPS will not authorize Airmen to cancel a previously approved extension for the
   purpose of combining it with additional extensions, reenlist rather than extend, or to enhance
   SRB entitlements.
 58                                                                    AFI36-2606 9 MAY 2011


6.3. Extensions for Lengthy-Service Airmen. Attachment 1 contains the definition of lengthy-
service Airmen. Refer to 10 USC §1176(a) for background information.
   6.3.1. The extension approval authorities specified in paragraph 6.1 will not deny extensions
   requested by lengthy-service Airmen if the extension period will not exceed 20 years, 1
   month of TAFMS, and the Airman is otherwise eligible for the extension. This restriction
   applies even if the requested DOS will not permit the Airman to complete 20 years TAFMS.
   (Example: If a lengthy-service Airman will complete 18 years, 6 months on DOS, and
   requests a 4-month extension to obtain a passing fitness score, approval authorities cannot
   deny the extension request).
   6.3.2. Commanders may not request extension cancellation if the affected Airman is a
   lengthy-service Airman (refer to paragraph 6.12.1). The MPS will return request to
   commander without taking further action.
6.4. Extensions for Service-Directed Requirements. Airmen may, if otherwise eligible,
reenlist according to Table 5.1, 5.6 and 5.7 or extend their enlistments according to Table 6.1 for
the minimum number of months required.
   6.4.1. Eligible Airmen serving in SRB skills, who hold a 3-skill level or higher in the SRB
   skill, may extend their enlistments in one increment for a minimum period of 36 months up
   to, and including, a maximum period of 48 months. Airmen may use this provision only if
   they are extending according to Table 6.1., Rules 12, 13, 14, 16 and 29 and have not already
   extended for a total period of 12 or more months. Airmen may use this extension option
   even if they require less retainability.
       6.4.1.1. Airmen qualify for an SRB entitlement on the day they sign the extension but
       will not receive the SRB payment until the day they enter the extension provided they
       remain qualified.
       6.4.1.2. The MPS will review the current SRB skills list to ensure Airmen are serving in
       SRB skills (CAFSC and DAFSC) or when requesting extensions. The day the Airman
       enters an extension will determine the SRB Zone. (Example: If an Airman extends
       while serving in the Zone A window, but will be in the Zone B window on the day the
       extension is entered, the Airman receives a Zone B bonus if eligible according to
       paragraph 4.6. The day the Airman signs the extension determines the SRB multiple
       level. Future changes to the SRB skills list do not affect SRB entitlements). (Note: The
       MPS must accurately review the current SRB authorization listing and accurately
       calculate the Airman TAFMS to determine the SRB zone the Airman will be in upon
       entering the zone).
6.5. Extensions for Reenlistment-Ineligible Airmen. The MPS may approve extensions for
reenlistment-ineligible Airmen as indicated below. (Note: MPS will not permit Airmen to
extend while SRP reconsideration [RE code 3B] is pending). Commanders must conduct SRP
consideration within 30 days when the ineligibility condition no longer exists. See paragraph
2.4.1.1.
   6.5.1. Career Airmen ineligible to reenlist who hold RE codes 2R through 2U may request
   extensions according to Table 6.1, Rules 3 or 4, provided they have not refused to obtain
   service-directed retainability or cancelled an extension for the purpose of separation.
AFI36-2606 9 MAY 2011                                                                        59


   6.5.2. FTA who have the RE code 3C who require additional retainability may request
   extensions according to Table 6.1, if otherwise qualified. FTA do not need approved CJRs in
   order to extend.
   6.5.3. Reenlistment ineligible Airmen may only request extensions if ineligibility conditions
   allows for an extension in Table 6.1. For example, Airmen may not extend to obtain
   retainability for promotion under Rule 1, if RE code is 4J.
   6.5.4. First term non-US citizens (RE code 2I) may request extensions to attain citizenship
   according to Table 6.1, Rule 25, provided they have already applied for citizenship and are
   within 120 days of their DOS. The requested extension period may not exceed their
   projected swear-in date plus 30 days, or 6 months, whichever is sooner. The MPS may
   authorize additional 6-month extensions as required (not to exceed 48 months total). If
   citizenship is not granted prior to the end of Airman’s 48 cumulative extension months,
   waivers will not be granted and the Airman will separate on their DOS.
   6.5.5. Airmen who appeal SRP non-selection (RE code 2X) may request extensions of
   enlistment according to Table 6.1, Rule 23, to await the outcome. When the appeal authority
   is at the Wing or below, the MPS approves extensions in one-month increments until the
   Airman’s appeal is finalized. When the appeal authority is the SECAF, the MPS approves
   extensions in three-month increments until the Airman’s appeal is finalized. (Note: MPS
   must contact AFPC/DPSOAE three months prior to ETS, if appeal is still being processed
   and member has already extended 45 months on current enlistment).
   6.5.6. Lengthy-service Airmen who are non-selected under the SRP may request extension
   of enlistment in order to obtain minimum retirement eligibility (refer to paragraph 6.3 and
   Table 6.1, Rule 4).
   6.5.7. Constructive Reenlistment. See paragraph 5.2.4.
6.6. Extensions for Airman Medically Disqualified (Medical Hold). AFPC/DPAMM is the
sole approval authority for Assignment Limitation Code-C (ALC-C), Medical Hold and non
emergent elective surgery during an active duty service member’s final six months of service.
Medical Hold is a method of retaining a service member beyond an established retirement or
separation date for reason of disability processing, for conditions when presumption of fitness
does not apply. It is not used for the purpose of evaluating or treating chronic conditions,
performing diagnostic studies, elective treatment of medical defects, non-emergent elective
surgery or its subsequent convalescence. Extensions approved under this paragraph are subject
to age, HYT and the maximum length limitations/restrictions imposed by paragraphs 6.2 and
6.13. (Note: Commanders may not disapprove.)
   6.6.1. The MPS will:
       6.6.1.1. Receive verification from AFPC/DPAMM outlining the number of months of
       the approved medical hold extension.
          6.6.1.1.1. Process the extension IAW current Air Force procedures. See Table 6.1,
          Rule 9.
          6.6.1.1.2. Airmen cannot be forced to remain in service beyond their ETS. They
          must agree in writing to a medical hold and execute the AF Form 1411.
 60                                                                AFI36-2606 9 MAY 2011


          6.6.1.1.3. Airmen extending under this rule may immediately reenlist once medically
          cleared and obligated service (Medical Hold portion) is waived.
          6.6.1.1.4. Airmen who have not entered the extension may request cancellation. The
          request must be within 30 days of the MEB/PEB return to duty adjudication.
          6.6.1.1.5. Airmen extending under this rule and later removed from medical hold or
          who declines continued medical hold or MEB/PEB in writing will have their DOS
          established by AFPC/DPSOS.
   6.6.2. Airmen in RE code 4K may voluntarily extend their enlistment under Table 6.1 Rule 1
   of this AFI when additional retainability is required for promotion. (Note: In all cases,
   Airmen will retain the RE code 4K until medically cleared for duty). Limit extension period
   to a maximum of 24 months.
       6.6.2.1. Airmen extending under this rule may immediately reenlist once medically
       cleared and obligated service is waived.
       6.6.2.2. Airmen who have not entered the extension may request cancellation. The
       request must be within 30 days of the PCM determination to return to duty.
   6.6.3. Limit pregnancy extensions (Airman or spouse) to the minimum number of months
   required to establish a DOS of delivery date plus one month. See Table 6.1, Rule 10.
6.7. Extensions for National Call to Service (NCS) Airmen. The Bob Stump National
Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year (FY) 2003 amended Chapter 31 of 10 USC which
provides the Department of Defense with a short-term enlistment program designed to promote
and facilitate military enlistment in support of national service. This amendment authorizes a
menu of incentives for a 15-month enlistment term to begin upon completion of Basic Military
Training (BMT) and Technical Training School (TTS) followed with additional service on active
duty, in the Reserve Components, or in a national service program. See AFI 36-2002 for
additional guidance.
   6.7.1. A NCS Airman who chooses to remain on active duty will be extended for one 24-
   month period under Table 6.1, Rule 28 (Rule 28 will be approved by AFPC/DPSOAE). NCS
   Airmen are the only Airmen who are authorized to extend for 24 months. NCS Airmen may
   request extension no earlier than 6 months prior to DOS and no later than 4 months prior to
   DOS. (Note: MilPDS will reject any system update outside the established time frame listed
   above. If the NCS is beyond the 4 months prior to DOS, an exception to policy will be
   completed by the NCS Airman and signed/approved by the commander to request the 24
   month extension. Forward the approval letter and AF Form 1411 to AFPC/DPSOAA,
   Enlisted Accessions for update).
   6.7.2. NCS Airmen who reach the first day of the 35th month of service, and if otherwise
   eligible, will be automatically considered for a Career Job Reservation (CJR).
   6.7.3. NCS Airmen will not be authorized additional extensions beyond the initial 24 month
   extension. A NCS Airman who does not receive a CJR or is ineligible to reenlist will

6.8. Extension Reasons. Table 6.1 lists the approval conditions for voluntary extensions of
enlistment. MPS will not approve extensions requested for the purpose of:
   6.8.1. Personal convenience or monetary advantage, except as specified under Table 6.1,
   Rule 28.
   6.8.2. Increasing bonus entitlement (not applicable to paragraph 6.4.1).
   6.8.3. Providing additional time to make a career decision or deferring separation to coincide
   with civilian plans.
   6.8.4. Applying for a CJR or requesting retraining.
6.9. Leave Settlement. Airmen may sell leave only upon entry into the first voluntary
extension of their current enlistment
   6.9.1. Leave is sold once Airman enters the extension, not upon the date of signature on the
   AF Form 1411. If the Airman enters the extension in a different FY from when they signed
   the form, ensure the Airman understands leave may be lost. Airmen cannot sell leave if they
   have already sold 60 days in their career or are entering a second or subsequent extension of
   enlistment. The Airman’s base pay on ETS determines the payment. Airmen eligible to sell
   leave complete AF Form 1089. Airmen may change their leave settlement elections at any
   time prior to the 10 day calendar period of the effective date of entry into the extension of
   enlistment. The MPS ensures Airmen document changes on a new AF Form 1089. The MPS
   will refer to AFCSM 36-699, Volume 1, Chapter 3, for DJMS-AC update instructions.
6.10. How to Complete and Process Extension of Enlistment Requests: The MPS uses AF
Form 1411 to document all extension and extension cancellation requests.
   6.10.1. The MPS completes the AF Form 1411 and verifies RE codes by MilPDS inquiry
   before initiating AF Form 1411 and enters the RE codes in Section I. The MPS ensures the
   requests comply with all general limitations and requirements.
   6.10.2. The commander makes recommendations by completing AF Form 1411, Section VI,
   enters disapproval rationale in the remarks section or on a separate sheet and sends the form
   and any attachments to the MPS.
   6.10.3. The MPS personnel identified in paragraph 6.1 will take the following actions:
       6.10.3.1. The commander recommends approval of the extension by completing Section
       VI. Refer to paragraph 6.3 for restrictions concerning lengthy-service Airmen. The
       extension is approved/disapproved once the extension action has been updated in
       MilPDS.
          6.10.3.1.1. Update approved extensions in MilPDS (refer to AFCSM 36-699,
          Volume 1, Chapter 3), verify DFAS file (take appropriate action if needed), and

6.12. Extension Cancellation.
   6.12.1. Extensions may not be cancelled if, at a minimum, any of the following apply. Other
   reasons may preclude cancellation of an extension and will be processed according to
   paragraph 6.11.1. (Note: RE code 4K Airmen later cleared may cancel if not entered or
   reenlist immediately with obligated service waived, if entered).
      6.12.1.1. The Airman has entered the extension.
      6.12.1.2. The Airman extended under Table 6.1, Rule 28 (Exception: If Airman
      extended as a nominee for the 12 Outstanding Airmen of the Year).
      6.12.1.3. The Airman extended for elective surgery.
      6.12.1.4. The duration of the obligation is changed by the Air Force (Example: Airman
      extended for a four year controlled tour and after arrival, the controlled tour is changed to
      a three year tour).
      6.12.1.5. The Airman extended for an assignment (to include to accept retraining or a
      special duty) and departed for that (or any other) location.
      6.12.1.6. This does not preclude early separation if Airman applies for voluntary
      separation or is involuntarily discharged.
   6.12.2. The commander may request extension cancellation if a reenlistment ineligibility
   condition in Table 5.2 and/or Table 5.4 causes cancellation of the reasons for which Airman
   extended. (Note: Commanders cannot request extension cancellation if the affected Airman
   is a lengthy-service Airman (refer to paragraph 6.3), the extension reasons were fulfilled or
   still exist, or the Airman extended according to Table 6.1, Rules 17 through 24).
      6.12.2.1. The commander notifies the Airman, in writing, of their intent to request
      extension cancellation, and advises the Airman they may submit a statement on their own
      behalf within 3 workdays of acknowledgment. The commander completes AF Form
      1411, Section VIII, attaches their intent letter and the Airman’s statement then sends the
      documents to the Chief, MPS for approval or disapproval. (Note: Document extension
      cancellation on the ARMS copy of the original extension).
      6.12.2.2. If the Chief, MPS approves the extension cancellation, complete AF Form
      1411, Section IX:
          6.12.2.2.1. The MPS attaches any supporting documentation to the ARMS copy of
          AF Form 1411, deletes the extensions from MilPDS, verifies DFAS files (take
          appropriate action if needed) and disposes of the forms according to Table 5.8. MPS
          then sends the Airman copies of the AF Form 1411 and the initial notification letter to
          the commander.
AFI36-2606 9 MAY 2011                                                                         65


         6.12.2.2.2. The commander ensures Airman indorses the initial notification letter,
         acknowledging receipt of the decision and that an appeal may be submitted in
         accordance with paragraph 6.15. The commander will ensure the Airman documents
         appeal intent before returning the letter to the MPS for processing according to
         paragraph 6.15.
     6.12.2.3. The Chief, MPS disapproves extension cancellation request by completing AF
     Form 1411, Section VII, and enters their rationale in the remarks section:
         6.12.2.3.1. The MPS sends the Airman’s copy of the AF Form 1411 and the initial
         notification letter to the commander and suspense’s the remaining copies of the forms
         pending receipt of the Airman’s acknowledgment.
         6.12.2.3.2. The commander ensures the Airman indorses the initial notification letter,
         acknowledging receipt of the decision, and returns the letter to the MPS.
         6.12.2.3.3. The MPS attaches the letter to the ARMS copy of AF Form 1411 and
         disposes of the forms according to Table 5.8.
  6.12.3. Airmen may request extension cancellation to immediately reenlist due to unique and
  unusual circumstances or when other reasons for cancellation were not used or are
  inappropriate and when fulfilling the extension would result in an injustice. The Airman may
  request extension cancellation under this provision only when the extension has not been
  executed. Extension cancellation and reenlistment must occur on the same day. (Note:
  Non-receipt of an SRB is not an injustice). (Note: Document extension cancellation on the
  ARMS copy of the original extension).
     6.12.3.1. The MPS assists the Airman in completing AF Form 1411, Section VIII and
     suspense’s the form pending final action. Refer to paragraph 6.10 for general processing
     instructions. Chief, MPS may disapprove the request, but AFPC/DPSOAE is the
     approval authority.
     6.12.3.2. The MPS completes AF Form 1411, Section IX to document approval or
     disapproval, attaches copies of the correspondence to each copy of the AF Form 1411,
     and disposes of the form according to Table 5.8. MPS deletes extension from MilPDS as
     appropriate.
  6.12.4. The Airman may request cancellation of extensions initiated according to Table 6.1,
  Rules 12 through 16, if the reason for the extension was cancelled, or no longer exist. Airmen
  must request cancellation no later than 30 calendar days following notification that the
  original reason for the extension was cancelled or no longer exist. The Air Force will
  consider failure to cancel the extensions within this time period as willingness on the part of
  the Airman to serve out the extension. (Example: An Airman extended to qualify for a
  CONUS PCS assignment, but was notified of assignment cancellation before entry into the
  extension. The Airman must submit the cancellation request within 30 calendar days of
  assignment cancellation notification). (Note: Request for extension cancellation after the 30
  calendar day period will be denied by the MPS and will not be forwarded to AFPC/DPSOAE
  for consideration; however, the Airman may petition the AFBCMR for relief).
 66                                                                 AFI36-2606 9 MAY 2011


       6.12.4.1. The MPS enters the authority for cancellation and a brief explanation in the
       remarks section of the AF Form 1411 as follows: "Assignment cancelled per
       AFPC/DPAAD email, dated 15 Jun 09."
   6.12.5. When an existing extension (not yet entered) is subject to cancellation according to
   paragraphs 6.12.2 or 6.12.3 and is to be replaced by an extension of a shorter duration, MPS
   administratively corrects the contract according to paragraph 6.11.4.
   6.12.6. CAREERS/NCORP retrainess may request cancellation IAW paragraph 5.3 of this
   AFI.
6.13. High Year of Tenure (HYT) and Age 55 Restrictions. The restrictions outlined in
paragraph 5.17 also apply to extensions. Request for HYT adjustments/corrections will be sent
to AFPC/DPSOR or AFPC/DPSOS via current processing procedures. (Note: Under no
circumstances will any reenlistment or extension exceed the Airman’s HYT, unless otherwise
provided).
   6.13.1. Airmen may extend to establish a DOS at their HYT or age 55, provided they are
   otherwise eligible and are within 2 years of their HYT date or age 55 (Table 6.1, Rules 3 and
   27).
   6.13.2. TSgts who wish to serve 6 months time-in-grade before HYT retirement may qualify
   for extensions according to Table 6.1, Rule 1.
   6.13.3. Second term and career Airmen demoted to the grade of A1C or below who need
   additional time for separation processing may qualify for extensions according to Table 6.1.,
   Rule 26, if otherwise eligible.
   6.13.4. Airmen must get an approved waiver in order to extend enlistment beyond the month
   following the 55th birthday month. (Exception: Airmen do not need a waiver if extending
   enlistment to retire with 20 years TAFMS [refer to Table 6.1, Rule 4]).
       6.13.4.1. For HYT waivers for CMSgts (and Chief selects), refer to the Chief’s
       Handbook for instructions and requirements.

           ENLISTED CRITICAL SKILLS RETENTION BONUS PROGRAM

7.1. Background: The Enlisted Critical Skills Retention Bonus (CSRB) is an Office of the
Secretary of Defense (OSD)-driven requirement.
7.2. Program Overview: This is a financial incentive paid to Airmen who reenlist or agree to
continue serving on active duty for at least one additional year in a military skill designated as
critical by the Principal Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness
PDUSD(P&R). The intent of the bonus is to provide a financial incentive to influence retention
decisions of Service Airmen in designated CSRB-AFSCs taking into consideration current or
projected manning shortages, skill imbalances, and high training costs or high replacement costs,
in cases where less costly methods are inadequate or impractical. The CSRB program set forth in
this Chapter is subject to authorization under 37 USC Section 355 and DoDI 1304.29, for such
bonuses. The combined CSRB and SRB received during a career shall not exceed $200,000
unless specifically authorized as an exception by the PDUSD(P&R).
7.3. Eligibility Criteria/Qualifications:
   7.3.1. At a minimum, NCOs must possess the pay grade of TSgt (E-6) and above; and must
   have completed at least 19 years of service in a CSRB-authorized skill.
   7.3.2. Eligible Airmen are authorized to reenlist at any time during their current enlistment
   and the remaining obligated service is waived. Airmen are allowed to project their
   reenlistment 6 months in advance provided the reenlistment occurs on the actual day the
   Airmen reaches 19 years of TAFMS. (Example: Airman has exactly 19 years of TAFMS
   and has 24 months of obligated service remaining on their current enlistment. The 24 months
   obligated service will be waived).
   7.3.3. Contracts must be no less than 1 year and not more than 6 years.
   7.3.4. Eligible Airmen are authorized to extend to receive this bonus, provided the Airman
   has a service-directed reason to extend as shown in Table 6.1. (Note: Airmen will not
   receive the bonus until they enter their extension).
   7.3.5. Airmen will serve in the CSRB skill for the full period of the reenlistment or extension
   contract agreement, and incur an Active Duty Service Commitment (ADSC) for that
   reenlistment or extension contract. The ADSC will be based on the years reenlisting.
   7.3.6. HYT policy for mandatory retirements may be waived for TSgts/MSgt(E-6/E-7) who
   accept CSRB up to 25 years of service only. Once the Airman has completed the appropriate
   contract, the MPS or equivalent will be required to email AFPC/DPSOAE requesting the
   Airman’s HYT be adjusted to 25 years. AFPC/DPSOAE will coordinate with AFPC/DPSOR
   for approval. Once HYT has been adjusted by AFPC, the MPS or equivalent can then
   process the reenlistment/extension.
   7.3.7. Airmen may withdraw their retirement to reenlist and accept this bonus provided PCS
   funds were not expended.

7.4. Required Documentation:
   7.4.1. Reenlistment: The AF Form 901 documents the CSRB participation and entitlement.
   (See Table 7.1).
   7.4.2. Extension: The AF Form 1411 documents the CSRB participation and entitlement.
   The MPS documents the remarks Section X by inserting ―Airman is authorized $___ (insert
   specific dollar amount of bonus from Table 7.1) in conjunction with the Critical Skills
   Retention Bonus Program.‖
   7.4.3. The MPS will:
      7.4.3.1. Forward all requests (to include the required documentation) to AFPC/ADSC
      OPS via current processing procedures. Follow contract disposition schedule as outlined
      in Table 5.8
      7.4.3.2. Select ―Critical Skills Ret Bonus (Enlisted)‖ for case type.
      7.4.3.3. Annotate in the remarks ―Member is authorized $_____ in conjunction with the
      Enlisted CSRB Program.‖ The MPS will also state whether Airman requested lump sum
      or installments.
      7.4.3.4. Indicate the ADSC end date. This date will equal DOE plus TOE years (months
      are not added).
      7.4.3.5. Include current reenlistment date and whether the Airman was in a combat zone
      during the month in which the reenlistment took place.
7.5. Recoupment: When conditions warrant, any unearned CSRB may be recouped,
terminated, or suspended, as applicable, applying rules in DoDFMR.
7.6. Active Duty Service Commitment: Once an Airman accepts the CSRB program,
AFPC/ADSC OPS will update ADSC 69. AFPC/ADSC OPS will forward to AFPC/DPSOAE
for verification and processing to DFAS. The only ADSC waiver for retirement that is
applicable is for ―hardship‖ as stated in AFI 36-3203, Service Retirements.
