                                            Chapter 1

                                 GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. General. The 437 OSS/OSW, Weather Flight (WF), is part of the 437th Operations Group
which is part of the 437th Airlift Wing and provides and/or arranges for weather support to the
437th Airlift Wing, 628th Air Base Wing, 315th Airlift Wing and associate units assigned to
Joint Base Charleston (JB CHS), SC. JB CHS consists of 4 geographically separate areas, 1)
Charleston Airfield - KCHS, 2) North Auxiliary Airfield - KXNO, 3) Naval Weapons Station, 4)
Short Stay Recreation Area. Support to JB Charleston will be provided by multiple agencies.
The 26 OWS, in Barksdale, will issue all Watches, Warnings and Advisories for North Auxiliary
Field, Naval Weapons Station and Short Stay Recreational Area. Additionally, they will provide
Watch, Warning and Forecasted Advisory support for Charleston Airfield. The WF will provide
Observed Advisory support for Charleston Airfield. The FAA is responsible for taking weather
observations and the National Weather Service provides TAF support for Charleston Airfield.
The 618 TACC/XOW will provide aircrew mission support for local training sorties and down
range missions. The 437 OSS/OSW will serve as the focal point for all weather-related issues
and will coordinate support, as required, with the appropriate agency. This instruction establishes
requirements and procedures pertaining to weather support during peacetime operations. This
instruction will be reviewed biennially and updated as required.
1.2. Background.
   1.2.1. According to the AFI 15-128, Air Force Weather Roles and Responsibilities, an
   Operational Weather Squadron (OWS) will provide resource protection, terminal aerodrome
   forecasts, regional and operational-level weather products and information, meteorological
   watch (METWATCH) services, Pilot-to-Metro Service (PMSV), and flight weather briefing
   support for Air Force locations within designated geographic regions.
   1.2.2. The 26 Operational Weather Squadron (OWS) at Barksdale AFB, LA will provide
   regional and operational-level weather products and information to Air Force and Army units
   in the Southeast region of the Continental United States (CONUS).
   1.2.3. The WF at each Air Force location will focus on providing tactical-level weather
   products and information needed for mission execution and provide weather products and
   information to the commander of deployed forces during wartime, contingency, and exercise
   operations.
   1.2.4. The 618 TACC/XOW will provide briefing support to all local training sorties and
   real-world missions departing JB CHS. Additionally they will perform Flight and Route
   MISSIONWATCH for those missions.
1.3. Responsibilities.
   1.3.1. General responsibilities of the OWSs, TACC and WFs are outlined in AFI 15-128.
   Specific responsibilities of the 26 OWS and Charleston’s WF are defined in an Installation
   Data Page (IDP) between the 437 OSS/OSW and 26 OWS and in this instruction.
   1.3.2. The 26 OWS issues forecasted weather warnings, watches, advisories, and will
   provide flight weather briefings to transient aircrews passing through Charleston that cannot
   be supported by the WF.

     1.3.3. The WF will issue all observed advisories and warnings and create tailored weather
     products focused on the local mission, when required. Additionally, the WF will support the
     base in educating agencies on the purpose and applicability of weather products as required
     by regulations (AFI 10-2501) or directed by the 437 AW/CC or designated representative.
     1.3.4. The WF will inform the 618 TACC/XOW of significant mission limiting conditions
     are observed by the FAA or forecasted by the National Weather Service at Charleston
     Airfield. Specific conditions are defined in Table 4.2 of this instruction.
1.4. Duty Priorities.
     1.4.1. 26 OWS Duty Priorities. 26 OWS duty priorities listed in Table 1.1 exist to match and
     balance limited manning and mission critical tasks.
        1.4.1.1. Duty priorities focus efforts during peak work periods prone to task saturation
        and priority conflicts.
        1.4.1.2. Weather operators will use good judgment in complying with these duty
        priorities, especially when there is imminent danger to life and/or property.

        13           Conduct mission essential training
        14           Accomplish Administrative and Other Duties
1.5. Operational Hours. The WF is open from 0700L to 1630L Monday through Friday. The
station is closed from 1631L to 0659L Monday through Friday and on weekends and holidays.
During periods of closure the WF will maintain forecasters on standby to respond during severe
weather or when directed by the 437 AW/CC or designated representative. The standby weather
forecaster can be recalled through the 628 ABW/CP; on call response time is 30 minutes. When
the WF has to evacuate to the Alternate Operating Location (AOL), services may not be
immediately available.
   1.5.1. Resumption of 24-hour operations. The WF will resume 24-hour operations when:
       1.5.1.1. A tropical storm or hurricane will produce sustained winds of 35 knots or greater
       at JB CHS or when CAT is activated in lieu of potential tropical storm/hurricane impacts
       to the JB CHS complex.
       1.5.1.2. The 26 OWS suffers a total communications outage and cannot provide WWA
       support for the JB CHS complex.

       etc)
   1.5.2. Flight leadership will coordinate and establish the periods when the weather flight will
   be closed and develop a stand-by schedule when necessary. The 26 OWS and 628 ABW/CP
   will be formally notified and provided with a list and schedule of standby WF members.
   1.5.3. Changes to regularly scheduled operating hours published in the FLIPs must be
   published in NOTAMS by coordinating with 437 OSS/OSA Airfield Management to include
   remarks permanently. Notification may be by either Memo or e-mail.
 10                                          JBCHARLESTONI15-101 7 NOVEMBER 2013


1.6. Assumptions, Shortfalls, and Limitations.
   1.6.1. 26 OWS Assumptions. Adequate resources and communications will be available to
   execute the Installation Data Sheet (IDS) and sufficient weather intelligence will be available
   from various sources on which to base weather operations and production.
   1.6.2. WF Assumptions. Weather support can only be provided if the appropriate facilities,
   funding, communications, personnel, and indigenous support are available.
   1.6.3. WF Shortfalls: Some services may not always be available (e.g., out of station
   briefings) due to WF manning, station evacuation or other higher priority missions.
   1.6.4. WF Limitations.
       1.6.4.1. Lightning. Lightning may not be seen due to distance, low clouds, or poor
       visibility. Thunder may not be heard because of flight-line noise. Lightning detection is
       accomplished using the Lightning Tracking Software (LTS) manufactured by VAISALA.
       The LTS detects lightning across all of North America.
1.7. Alternate Operating Location (AOL). In the event of a building evacuation, weather
services will move to Building 506 (437 OSS/OSL) 843-963-4286/DSN 673-4286. The flight
will continue operational support and the WF’s “eyes forward” responsibilities for the 26 OWS.
   1.7.1. Access to Charleston Airfield observing equipment readouts will be lost and backup
   equipment use will be implemented, if needed. Access to North Auxiliary Field observing
   equipment readouts will be maintained using JET. WF members will follow duty specific
   SOPs and Weather Flight Evacuation Checklists (including a list of required backup
   equipment) and resume services at the AOL as soon as possible. See paragraphs 9.2 and 9.3
   for information on dissemination backup procedures.
   1.7.2. Most WF services/support will be able to be provided, but will require a case-by-case
   assessment dependent on communication line status, equipment status, etc. Expect most
   services to be somewhat degraded (weather products, pilot briefings, etc) due to limited
   facilities and loss of dedicated data services, including sensors and various data types
   (Metsat, radar imagery, etc). See paragraph 11.5.1 for more details on the AOL. All Staff
   Support services will relocate to the AOL as well.
   1.7.3. To ensure resource protection is maximized, the WF will not evacuate for exercises
   when severe weather is imminent or when in any HURCON/HUREVAC threat level.
1.8. Release of Weather Information to Non-DoD Agencies and Individuals. Weather
information will not be released to non-DoD agencies or the general public without prior
approval from 628 ABW/PA. Contractors employed by DoD on Joint Base Charleston will be
supported; any questions and/or clarifications will be coordinated through the WF Chief and/or
NCOIC.
1.9. Mishap Procedures. WF members and the 26 OWS have a role when the airfield is
advised of an emergency or mishap. In general, the WF will ensure applicable data used in the
development of any weather information, products, and/or services provided is saved for the
possibility of an impending investigation.
   1.9.1. The WF will coordinate with 26 OWS and 618 TACC/XOW to save all applicable
   data and products. The WF will also specify to both agencies what data needs to be saved. If
JBCHARLESTONI15-101 7 NOVEMBER 2013                                                  11


  the WF used products from other OWSs to support missions crossing AORs, they must
  coordinate with all applicable OWSs to initiate a data save.
  1.9.2. If 618 TACC/XOW provided the flight weather MWP or other products, they will
  coordinate the data save with all AFW units involved. The WF will coordinate with Air
  Force Weather Agency (AFWA) Operations to save any applicable data and products not
  available locally.
  1.9.3. The WF at the departure installation and the mishap location (if on a military
  installation) will follow the Aircraft Mishap procedures in AFMAN 15-129V2, Chapter 3.

                                          Chapter 2

                                   AIRFIELD SERVICES

2.1. General. Airfield services include those actions that affect the Charleston aerodrome
(defined within 5NM of the airfield) or the base as a whole. Examples include FAA weather
observations, PMSV, and resource protection. Resource protection will be addressed in Chapter
8.
2.2. Observations. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is responsible for weather
observations at Joint Base Charleston/International Airport, through a subcontractor. All
observations for Charleston Airfield are taken in accordance with the FMH-1B and not the
AFMAN 15-111.
   2.2.1. Joint Base Charleston/International Airport
       2.2.1.1. The official weather observation is taken by an FAA owned Automated Surface
       Observing System (ASOS), and augmented by a certified FAA weather observer who
       ensures the accuracy of the ASOS observations.
       2.2.1.2. The official weather hourly, special, and local observations are disseminated 24
       hours a day, 7 days a week, as required by FAA Order 7900.5B. The ASOS equipment is
       located in the center of the airfield adjacent to runway 33.
       2.2.1.3. METAR (Meteorological Aviation Routine Weather Report). Note: METAR
       observations are taken and disseminated every hour between 55 and 59 minutes after the
       hour. A METAR observation could also indicate that special weather criteria were met
       during the observing period. See Attachment 3 for special observing criteria. METAR
       observations are disseminated both locally and longline.
       2.2.1.4. SPECI (Aviation Selected Special Weather Report). SPECI observations are
       taken whenever certain weather events, defined in Attachment 3, occur. These
       observations are disseminated both locally (ATC) and longline.
       2.2.1.5. LOCAL (Aviation Selected Local Weather Report). LOCAL observations are
       taken when certain criteria, not meeting special observation requirements, occur. LOCAL
       observations are only transmitted to the FAA Control Tower. Attachment 3 contains all
       local observing requirements established by the FAA for JB CHS.
   2.2.2. North Auxiliary Field
       2.2.2.1. The official weather observation is taken by an FMQ-19 ASOS, and augmented
       by a certified weather observer who ensures the accuracy of the ASOS observations.
       2.2.2.2. The official weather hourly, special, and local observations are disseminated 24
       hours a day, 7 days a week, as required by AFMAN 15-111. The FMQ-19 equipment is
       located to the right of the 050 end of the assault runway.
       2.2.2.3. METAR (Meteorological Aviation Routine Weather Report). Note: METAR
       observations are taken and disseminated every hour between 55 and 59 minutes after the
       hour. A METAR observation could also indicate that special weather criteria were met
JBCHARLESTONI15-101 7 NOVEMBER 2013                                                           13


       during the observing period. See Attachment 3 for special observing criteria. METAR
       observations are disseminated both locally and longline.
       2.2.2.4. SPECI (Aviation Selected Special Weather Report). SPECI observations are
       taken whenever certain weather events, defined in Attachment 3, occur. These
       observations are disseminated both locally (ATC) and longline.
2.3. Observing Limitations. The official Charleston Airfield/Int’l Airport weather observations
are augmented by MacAulay Brown Inc., the FAA subcontractor.
   2.3.1. Joint Base Charleston/International Airport
       2.3.1.1. Changes to support must be coordinated through several agencies. Therefore,
       agencies requiring changes to SPECI or local weather observation criteria outlined in this
       instruction should provide 60 days advance notice prior to desired date of change.
       2.3.1.2. The WF has no direct input toward the official weather observation. However,
       we are able to contact the official observer via telephone.
       2.3.1.3. FAA observations do not include local Runway Visual Range (RVR) readings.
       This information can be obtained by contacting the Control Tower.
       2.3.1.4. There are some subtle differences           between    the   FAA     observation
       rules/regulations and Air Force guidance:
       2.3.1.5. The ASOS uses a laser cloud height detection system to accurately measure
       cloud bases up to 12,000 feet. To measure a cloud base, the cloud must be directly over
       the laser projector. An observer verifies all sensor readings to determine whether a true
       ceiling exists or if a there is only a small patch of clouds over the sensor’s beam. Even
       though the ASOS is augmented by a certified weather observer, it is not unusual for the
       official observation to report a sky condition of “CLR” (clear) when there are clouds
       above 12,000 feet.
       2.3.1.6. Wind measurements reported are a 2-minute average of direction and speed.
       Gusts are a five second average of five one second measurements.
       2.3.1.7. Due to equipment limitations the ASOS does not take a special observation for
       3/8-mile visibility (Minimum ILS approach runway 15).
       2.3.1.8. The ASOS does not have the capability to take a SPECI observation when
       precipitation begins or ends, apart from those phenomena listed in Attachment 3,
       A4.2.6.4.
       2.3.1.9. The 437 OSS/OSW is not responsible for providing RCR IAW AFMAN 15-111.
       In addition, neither the ASOS nor Airfield Management is equipped or augmented to
       provide this information.
   2.3.2. North Auxiliary Field
       2.3.2.1. Changes to support must be coordinated through 628 CS/SCOA. Therefore,
       agencies requiring changes to SPECI or local weather observation criteria outlined in this
       instruction should provide 60 days advance notice prior to desired date of change.
       2.3.2.2. Observations are taken by a fully automated system, FMQ-19, with no human
       intervention.
 14                                           JBCHARLESTONI15-101 7 NOVEMBER 2013


       2.3.2.3. The ASOS uses a laser cloud height detection system to accurately measure
       cloud bases up to 12,000 feet. To measure a cloud base, the cloud must be directly over
       the laser projector. An observer verifies all sensor readings to determine whether a true
       ceiling exists or if a there is only a small patch of clouds over the sensor’s beam. It is not
       unusual for the official observation to report a sky condition of “CLR” (clear) when there
       are clouds above 12,000 feet.
       2.3.2.4. Due to the location of the FMQ-19, adjacent to the 50 end of the assault runway,
       conditions maybe slightly different when using the 06/24 long runway or the 23 end of
       the assault runway.
2.4. Continuous Weather Watch. A continuous weather watch is the process by which
weather personnel continuously watch weather conditions without performing any other duties.
The FAA contract observers perform a continuous weather watch at Charleston Airfield.
2.5. Cooperative Weather Watch (CWW). This is a program wherein qualified non-weather
personnel assist the weather observer in monitoring the weather conditions for the occurrence of
previously unreported weather conditions which could affect flight safety or which could be
critical to the safety or efficiency of other local operations and resources.
   2.5.1. At Charleston Airfield, a Cooperative Weather Watch is in effect between FAA
   weather observers and FAA air traffic control tower personnel; US Military forces do not
   have a direct role in the aviation portion of the CWW. There is however a standing letter of
   agreement between the FAA and 437 OSS/OSA Airfield Management to pass on urgent
   weather reports. These reports will be channeled from Airfield Management to the Weather
   Flight. Security Forces personnel are encouraged to report any weather conditions impacting
   the safety of local operations and resources to the WF. Maintenance SOF is also encouraged
   to relay reports from flight line personnel related to changes in weather conditions that are
   not currently being reported or forecasted to occur at Charleston Airfield to the WF.
   2.5.2. Due to the fact that weather technicians assigned to JB CHS do not take surface
   observations, a Basic Weather Watch (BWW) IAW AFMAN 15-111 is not required.
2.6. METWATCH. METWATCH provides an organized approach for weather personnel to
maintain situational awareness of the current/future meteorological situation within a designated
area(s). This process involves notifying supported units and updating any forecast products when
pre-established weather conditions or unforecasted changes (timing, location, or forecast values)
in weather occur or are expected to occur. All on-site meteorological and commercial data
sources (weather satellite, weather radar, websites, NOAA weather radio, etc.) may be used to
accomplish this task.
   2.6.1. The 26 OWS will perform a threat based METWATCH for JB CHS. WF personnel
   will act as the “eyes forward” for the 26 OWS by providing immediate feedback on current
   or short-term anticipated changes in weather conditions.
   2.6.2. 26 OWS will also perform Flight and Route MISSIONWATCH for transient flights
   they briefed that are departing from Charleston Airfield.
   2.6.3. 618 TACC/XOWwill perform Flight and Route MISSIONWATCH for all local
   training flights departing Charleston Airfield that were briefed by 618 TACC/XOW
JBCHARLESTONI15-101 7 NOVEMBER 2013                                                          15


   personnel. Transient missions (cross-country, trans-Atlantic, etc) are not considered “local”
   though the mission’s origins may have started/ended at Charleston Airfield.
2.7. Eyes Forward Process/Procedure. The WF will relay significant, time-sensitive
meteorological information not found in coded meteorological reports to the 26 OWS to assist in
characterization operations. Additionally, the WF will retain an eyes forward role with the 26
OWS for resource protection products. The FAA issues the observation and provides eyes
forward role to the National Weather Service concerning the aerodrome forecast.
2.8. PMSV Support. Weather information is available via Pilot-to-Metro-Service (PMSV)
from 0700L to 1630L Monday thru Friday via phone call/phone patch at DSN 673-3016/Comm
843-963-3016. Given the one-deep manning of the WF, there may be short periods of time
(physical requirements, Staff Briefings, etc) where the PMSV support will not be continuously
monitored.
2.9. Weather Sensors. There are two airfields associated with Joint Base Charleston. The FAA
maintains the ASOS at the Charleston Airfield (KCHS). At the North Auxiliary Airfield
(KXNO), located approximately 80 miles northwest of Charleston near Orangeburg, a JB CHS
owned, FMQ-19 is in use as a fully automated system with no human intervention.

                                     MISSION SERVICES

3.1. General. Mission services are those actions directly related to completing each customer’s
daily mission(s). The Mission Weather Product (MWP) is the primary tool used to accomplish
these tasks. MWPs are tailored to individual customer requirements and may be anything from a
web-based flight weather briefing to a change-of-command weather forecast. Charleston’s
primary MWPs are the 3-day AOD planning weather product and 5-day forecast. Both products
are posted electronically by 0800L. Any event, both flying and non-flying, that will be affected
by weather normally requires a MWP to meet the size, scope, and needs of the customer.
3.2. Operational Hours. The WF is open from 0700L to 1630L Monday through Friday. The
station is closed from 1631L to 0659L Monday through Friday and on weekends and holidays.
During periods of closure the WF will maintain forecasters on standby to meet 437th and 315th
Airlift Wing mission requirements and to respond during severe weather.
3.3. Terminal Aerodrome Forecasts (TAF). Used by DoD and National Weather Service
(NWS) weather forecasters to encode and decode forecasts. See Table 4.1 below for an example
TAF. AFPAM 11-238 gives instructions on how to decode the TAF. Unless otherwise specified,
the forecast weather elements in the main body of the forecast text (clouds, weather, wind, etc.)
apply to the area within a 5NM radius of the Charleston Airfield complex. Forecast elements
represent the most probable conditions expected during the forecast period. The term vicinity
(VC) may be used and normally refers to the area between 5 and 10 NM from the center of the
runway.
   3.3.1. The Charleston NWS issues the 24-hour TAF for Joint Base Charleston under the
   International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) identifier KCHS. TAFs are issued four (4)
   times daily at the following times: 0000 UTC, 0600 UTC, 1200 UTC and 1800 UTC.
   3.3.2. TAF Amendments. Charleston NWS will ensure the TAF is representative of expected
   or actual conditions and will amend the TAF for the criteria listed in Attachment 4.
3.4. Mission Weather Product (MWP). MWPs are essentially mission-specific forecasts that
are developed using a 8-step process outlined in AFMAN 15-129V2 Chapter 2, and may be
provided by a number of methods (web-based, verbally, person-to-person, etc). Due to Mission
Weather Services Implementation on 2 August 2010, the WF no longer produces daily
operational MWPs, but does produce a detailed, 3-day planning MWP for most commonly used
ARs and drop zones (ARs include 202, 207, & 216; drop zones include North Auxiliary
Airfield). The weather flight will be responsible for producing daily MWPs whenever TACC is
unable to provide support; normally a notice to the field will be issued informing the WF of an
outage that is expected to be prolonged. During this process, the WF will fuse and tailor
products created by strategic and theater weather centers, as well as information supplied by
local units (e.g., flying schedules) and agencies. The end result is a product/information designed
to provide timely, accurate, and relevant weather intelligence to various customers by whatever
means proves most effective. MWP products will be horizontally consistent with products
produced by OWSs and AFWA. When significant deviations between the MWP and
OWS/AFWA products exist, the WF will make every effort to collaborate with these agencies to
resolve disagreements. During rapidly changing conditions, emergencies, or when conditions
JBCHARLESTONI15-101 7 NOVEMBER 2013                                                              17


threaten resource protection, the WF may produce/amend MWP products to accurately reflect
conditions and back-brief the OWS/AFWA when time permits.

   3.4.1. Flight MWPs. Flight MWPs are the primary forecast products generated by the Charleston
   WF during back-up operations. The 618 TACC/XOW at Scott AFB is the primary source for the
   Flight MWP via GDSS. The Flight MWP is a unique product incorporating requirements from
   all Charleston-based flying units into a common format. Flight MWPs include forecast take-off
   weather, winds and hazards en-route, air-refueling route forecasts, landing weather, and aircraft
   specific weather elements. In addition, space weather products are used to predict performance
   of HF, UHF, and GPS systems in the MWP.
   3.4.2. C-17 Planning MWPs. These planning MWPS are generated by the forecaster for
   North Auxiliary Airfield, AR202, AR207 and AR216 and are valid for the following day.
   Flight planning products are located at the following link: https://globalreach.amc.af.mil/
   User/WeatherInformation/index.cfm. This link will take you to the web homepage; on left
   side of page, select ‘AOD Mission Planning Weather’. A .pdf file will display the AOD 3

   https://weather.af.mil/confluence/display/AFWWEBSTBT/Space+Weather+Main+Page
   3.4.5. Follow-Up Support. Aircrews are welcome to contact the WF for any post-mission
   information and/or follow-up support.
   3.4.6. Transient Aircraft Weather Briefings. Weather personnel will provide verbal briefings,
   full flight MWPs (when required), and/or updates to traditional Flight Weather Briefings
   (DD Form 175-1) to aircrews as requested, following the flight’s duty priorities listed in
   Table 1.2.
      3.4.6.1. Transient briefings will be at the weather flight or via fax/ phone.

         3.4.6.2. When higher priority tasks prohibit the WF from providing transient aircrew
         briefings, the WF will arrange for briefing support with the OWS.
    3.4.7. Mission Types and Thresholds. JB CHS has many different organizations and
    missions. All systems, missions, and aircrews are limited by some weather parameters. This
    section will identify the local weapons system, the most common missions and operating
    areas, and weather sensitivities associated with the organization, weapons system, missions,
    and aircrews.
    3.4.8. Supported Organization/Missions/Requirements. The WF provides weather support to
    the following organizations (and their associated units) with the accompanying missions and
    requirements:

    3.4.9. Back-up Support. The WF provides back-up weather support for Mission Weather
    Services (MWS) and Integrated Flight Management (IFM) missions during 618 TACC/XOW
    outages.
    3.4.10. Geographic Area of Responsibility. The 618 TACC/XOW and the WF provides
    mission-tailored weather support for flying areas used by assigned or attached units to JB
    CHS. Given the global-reach mission of air mobility, our AOR usually encompasses the
    entire globe.
    3.4.11. Airframe-Specific Weather Limitations. The following tables provide the general
    airframe weather limitations based on AFI 11-(series).

       3.4.13. Training Missions, Operating Areas, and Weather Sensitivities. Due to the fact our
       mission ranges throughout the entire world, there are very few instances when weather will
       make an operating area completely unusable. Pilot discretion is used to determine mission
       go/no-go regardless of the weather phenomena listed in the MWP or briefing.
       3.4.14. Primary Warfighter Weather Limitations. 437 OSS/OSW gains weekly exposure to
       Charleston’s primary warfighter leadership through Wing and Group staff meetings.
       Increased awareness of mission limitations is necessary for proper tailored weather support.
       The following tables provide primary organizational weather limitations:

   3.5. MISSIONWATCH. This term is used to describe the process by which weather personnel
   monitors the weather for all local customer missions. The weather flight will be responsible for
   performing MISSIONWATCH for all MWPs that are briefed by the WF. The 618 TACC/XOW
   will MISSIONWATCH all MWPs they produce and provide to JB CHS aircrews.
       3.5.1. WF personnel will utilize military data sources (weather satellite, weather radar,
       websites, etc.). If data cannot be found using a military source, then personnel will use
       government and commercial meteorological data sources.
       3.5.2. During rapidly changing weather, the WF will amend/update the MWP as required
       and contact the 628 ABW/CP to pass on critical changes.
   3.6. 618 TACC/XOW. Normally, missions leaving Charleston Airfield are TACC-controlled;
   either as Integrated Flight Management (IFM) or Mission Weather Services (MWS)
   sorties/missions. As such, TACC will be the Lead Weather Unit (LWU) for these missions. The
   WF will:
       3.6.1. Update takeoff weather as needed.
       3.6.2. Notify TACC if the takeoff update includes any of the criteria listed in Table 3.7.
       3.6.3. Consult/coordinate with TACC as required in resolving any aircrew concerns/issues
       with any mission.
JBCHARLESTONI15-101 7 NOVEMBER 2013                                                              23


    3.6.4. The WF will consult/coordinate with IFM or MWS as required in resolving any
    aircrew concerns/issues with the GDSS-II MWP. Facilitate discussions between aircrew
    members and TACC/XOW to elaborate on weather impacts and/or answer aircrew questions.
    TACC/XOW is the final arbiter for weather issues involving local training sorties/missions.
    3.6.5. The WF will also provide feedback to TACC provided by local aircrew related to
    weather packages.
    3.6.6. TACC provides Operational Risk Management (ORM) outlooks for key areas related
    to training missions. The WF will participate in monitoring the ORM areas and notify local
    mission planners, aircrew and/or TACC if flight safety or mission completion becomes an
    issue.

                               STAFF WEATHER SERVICES

4.1. General. Staff services are those services provided primarily by WF leadership. These
briefings are a specialized type of MWP focused on a particular event/audience. Examples
include, but are not limited to, Mission Update Meetings (MUM), Crisis Action Team (CAT)
briefings, and Flight Safety briefings, as requested.
4.2. Operational Hours. The majority of briefs are provided during normal duty hours (0730-
1630 local). Contingency, emergency, and exercise briefings are provided as required.
4.3. Staff Briefings. Staff weather briefings for 437 AW (Wing Stand-up) will be provided as
required. Standard information includes satellite, a 5-day outlook, and slides covering the
European and the Middle Eastern AORs. Additional slides may be required, such as tropical
weather updates, when applicable.
4.4. Air Traffic Control (ATC) Limited Observation Training. ATC Limited Observing
Training is provided by a contractor of the FAA and not the WF. This training is conducted
annually by all ATC personnel.
4.5. IRC Briefings. IRC briefings for Joint Base Charleston are PowerPoint based
presentations that have eliminated the requirement for a WF forecaster to provide instruction. If
the 437 AW or 315 AW desire the WF to participate in their IRC programs the WF will require 3
duty days notice in order to ensure a weather briefer will be available.
4.6. CAT Briefings. The WF will provide weather briefings as required for CAT briefings.
This includes real-world emergency, exercise, and deployment briefings. Each briefing will be
tailored to provide the appropriate weather intelligence required by wing leadership.
4.7. Climatology Briefings. Climatology information will be provided as requested.
4.8. Flight Information Publication (FLIP) Weather Updates. The WF is responsible for
ensuring all weather information in the FLIP is accurate.
   4.8.1. All weather related updates will be requested through the Airfield Management FLIP
   Manager, 437 OSS/OSA. The FLIP Manager will process the information to AFFSA/OL-D.
   Updates will fall in one of three categories: revisions, changes, or corrections.
   4.8.2. Items reviewed include contact numbers for the WF and OWS, WF hours of
   operation, PMSV frequency/availability, and the approach minimums for Charleston Airfield
   and North Auxiliary Airfield.
4.9. Pre-deployment Planning Briefings. The WF will provide pre-deployment weather
briefings when requested for deploying units. The content of the briefing will vary depending on
the customer’s requirements. For example, an aviation unit will receive weather impacts at the
deployed location on their flying mission in addition to the standard surface weather information
usually presented to ground units. A ground-based unit, such as Security Forces, will receive a
briefing on potential weather impacts to their mission, such as: surface temperatures, wind speed,
potential for blowing sand and dust, and precipitation.

                      SPACE WEATHER SUPPORT AND SERVICES

5.1. General. Many of our weapons and communications systems use satellites and radio waves
(High Frequency (HF), Very High Frequency (VHF), Ultra High Frequency (UHF), and Satellite
Communications (SATCOM)), that can be rendered useless by electro-magnetic radiation from
the sun. This chapter contains some brief information regarding space weather limitations, alerts
and warnings, and products available to JB CHS personnel.
5.2. Limitations. Like terrestrial weather, there are numerous factors that influence space
weather. One of the biggest limitations we have in identifying and forecasting space weather is a
lack of sensors. Additionally, given the speed of solar wind and light, our ability to provide lead-
times for significant space events is extremely limited. C-17 aircraft have been identified as
having communications disruption susceptibility at the HF frequency. Accordingly WF
forecasters will ensure HF space forecast products are checked for all locally created mission
packages.
5.3. Space Weather Alerts and Warnings. JB CHS’s missions have a wide variety of parameters
that could possibly be affected by various space weather conditions (HF and UHF communication).
Broad coverage CONUS-based space weather products (graphics) are available at
https://weather.af.mil/confluence/display/AFWWEBSTBT/Space+Weather+Main+Page. (See
figure 5.1.) These products will be used to update the Space Weather portion (HF, UHF, and GPS)
of Flight MWPs that are provided by the WF.

5.4. Products. Numerous space weather products are available from AFW-WEBS. Most Space
Weather products from the strategic center are “now-casts” and/or very short-term forecasts (6-
hour periods), so the duty forecaster will check for updated products whenever preparing and
updating a Flight MWP. For more information concerning these products please contact the 2
WS/WXZ at DSN 272-8087 or Comm 402-232-8087.
JBCHARLESTONI15-101 7 NOVEMBER 2013                                                           27

                          SPECIAL MISSION REQUIREMENTS

6.1. General. This chapter contains all of the specific local requirements submitted by various
organizations throughout JB CHS, and verified by the WF leadership. The requirements will be
reviewed annually by the requesting unit and updated as required. If the MWP, a watch, warning,
or an advisory does not cover a specific local weather requirement, extra effort will be made
(time permitting) to contact the individual unit to advise of the condition. In turn, the unit is
responsible for contacting the WF should their requirements change.
6.2. All flying units (437 AW and 315 AW). WF will provide services as outlined throughout
this publication.
   6.2.1. Alert Missions. WF provides support via an automated online weather briefing
   package designed specifically for Alert Missions. Weather Information page is located at:
   https://globalreach.amc.af.mil/User/WeatherInformation/?FileID=200.
6.3. Special requests. With sufficient advance notice (at least 3 working days), WF will
provide any special operational, climatological, or flight safety briefing.
6.4. Weapons Station Dispatch. WF will provide or arrange for services for the Naval
Weapons Station. The Naval Weapons Station Dispatch Office will be notified via IWWC
when specific criteria outlined in Chapter 8 of this document are forecasted to occur or are
occurring on the Naval Weapons Station. All Watch, Warning and Advisory services are
provided to the Naval Weapons Station section of JB CHS, are provided by the 26 OWS,
Barksdale AFB, LA.

                              RESOURCE PROTECTION SERVICES

7.1. General. This chapter contains details on weather watches, warnings, and advisories.
Resource protection is accomplished through a joint effort between the 26 OWS and the
Charleston WF. The 26 OWS is responsible for issuing all forecasted products including weather
watches, warnings and advisories. The WF acts as the “eyes forward” for the 26 OWS, and is
responsible for issuing all observed warnings and advisories. However, the WF can issue any
forecasted warning if there is an immediate threat to life and/or property. In these cases, the WF
will back brief the 26 OWS when time permits and will also be responsible for dissemination to
local supported agencies. Conversely, the WF will act as the alternate dissemination/notification
source for the OWS. The goal is to provide the best possible resource protection to JB CHS.
7.2. Weather Watches. A weather watch is a special notice sent to customers indicating that
conditions are favorable for the development of a particular type of weather phenomena (e.g.
tornadoes, hail, etc.). Watches are issued for a 5 nm radius of the center-point of the KCHS &
KXNO airfields, for the Naval Weapons Station at 32.57.30N 79.56.00W & for Short Stay
Recreational Area at 33.15.00N 79.59.00W. Table 8.1 contains all of the weather watches and
desired lead-times for the different portions of JB CHS.

Note: * Denotes change from standard weather watch criteria listed in AFMAN 15-129V1 Chapter 4.
Deviations are coordinated during the Severe Weather Response meeting and approved by the ABW/CC
or representative. Strong winds is not one of the mandatory watches but has been requested by the Short
Stay Recreation Area for boating safety. Standard watch for snowfall is normally issued for greater than
2 inches accumulation in 12-hrs. Locally there are no watches for blizzard conditions, dust storms, and
sandstorms as these phenomena don’t occur locally.

7.3. Weather Warnings. Weather warnings are special notices sent out to customers alerting
them that a predefined weather event, which will pose a threat to life or property, is expected to
occur. Warnings are issued for a 5 nm radius of the center-point of the KCHS & KXNO airfields,
for the Naval Weapons Station at 32.57.30N 79.56.00W & for Short Stay Recreational Area at
33.15.00N 79.59.00W. Forecasted warnings, with their desired lead-times, are contained in Table

Note: * Denotes change from standard weather warning criteria listed in AFMAN 15-129V1 Chapter 4.
Deviations are coordinated during the Severe Weather Response meeting and approved by the ABW/CC
or representative. Strong winds is not one of the mandatory watches but has been requested by the Short
Stay Recreation Area for boating safety. Standard watch for snowfall is normally issued for greater than
2 inches accumulation in 12-hrs. Locally there are no watches for blizzard conditions, dust storms, and
sandstorms as these phenomena don’t occur locally.

7.4. Observed Weather Warnings (IAW AFOSH Standards 91-66 & 91-100). Lightning
warnings are one type of observed warning issued on Joint Base Charleston. They extend 5 nm
in all directions from the center point of the airfield runways, for the Weapons Station at
32.57.30N 79.56.00W and centered on the Short Stay Recreation Area campground. Lightning
warnings are not issued until lightning is observed, either visually or via the National Lightning
Detection Network.
    7.4.1. The lightning warning will remain valid until lightning has not occurred in the area for
    at least 15 minutes. For safety reasons, a lightning warning that is in effect will not be
    cancelled if a thunderstorm is still present within 5nm, as determined by the duty forecaster,
    even if lightning is not present.
    7.4.2. The WF will provide timely notification using the Joint Base Charleston notification
    process to all supported units upon issuance and expiration of a lightning warning.
7.5. Weather Advisories. A weather advisory is a special notice sent to customers alerting
them that a predefined weather phenomenon, which may impact operations, is occurring or
forecast to occur on Joint Base Charleston. Joint Base Charleston Weather advisories can be
found in Table 8.3.

 Note: * Denotes a non-standard weather advisory criteria. Deviations are coordinated during the Severe
 Weather Response meeting and approved by the ABW/CC or representative. The Observed Lightning
 within 10NM advisory is requested by Naval EOD.

7.6. Format. Advisories, watches, and warnings are disseminated in a format described in
Attach 6.
7.7. Upgrades/Downgrades. Advisories and warnings will be upgraded (i.e. winds increase
from 35 knots to 50 knots) or downgraded as required. Upgrades should meet the desired lead-
times specified above.
   7.7.1. Only one forecasted warning may be in effect at one time with the exception of
   lightning within 5NM as it will always be a stand-alone warning.
   7.7.2. If a warning is issued for one criterion, and it becomes necessary to warn for another
   criterion, a new warning, with a new number, will be issued immediately to include all
   criteria expected. A separate valid time may be specified for each criterion, if necessary.
   7.7.3. Downgrades will follow the same rules outlined above with the exception of desired
   lead times do not apply.
7.8. Amendments. Amendments to weather warnings and watches will only be issued to
change the valid time and will be issued before the original watch or warning expires. New
warnings and watches will be issued for any change in weather criteria.
7.9. Cancellation. Warnings and watches may be cancelled when the weather phenomena are
no longer occurring or expected to occur. Observed advisories will be canceled when the criteria
is no longer occurring and is not expected to occur again in the next hour. See para 8.4 for
cancellation of observed lightning warnings.
7.10. Severe Weather Action Procedures (SWAP). The SWAP is in place to ensure sufficient
personnel are available during potential/actual severe weather events or during meteorological
and/or operational events critical to mission success. For the purposes of these procedures,
severe weather is defined as tornadoes/funnel clouds, surface winds > 50 knots, hail > 1/2 inch
diameter, freezing precipitation (any type/amount), and snowfall (Trace or greater < 12 hours). It
is imperative that timely and accurate weather watches, warnings, and advisories are
disseminated to all JB CHS agencies to ensure personnel and resource protection. These
procedures document a two-tier system with the 437 OSS/OSW and the 26 OWS sharing
responsibilities for SWAP and resource protection.
   7.10.1. WF Responsibilities. Will perform the WF SWAP responsibilities as defined in
   AFMAN 15-129V1, AFMAN 15-129V2 and this publication. More specifically, the WF will
   accomplish the following procedures:
 32                                                JBCHARLESTONI15-101 7 NOVEMBER 2013


        7.10.1.1. Notification. The forecaster on duty or on-call will notify or be notified
        respectively of conditions requiring activation of the SWAP according to the guidance
        below and in Table 8.4.
            7.10.1.1.1. During normal duty hours (0730 to 1630 local, Monday through Friday,
            except federal holidays/authorized down days) the duty forecaster will implement
            SWAP by notifying the WF Chief and/or NCOIC whenever one or more conditions in
            Table 8.4 are met.
        7.10.1.2. Standby/Recall Procedures. Whenever the WF is closed an on-call standby
        forecaster will be ready to respond to severe weather. The 628 ABW/CP will notify the
        on-call standby forecaster when conditions in Table 8.4 are met. Command Post will be
        notified of these conditions by the OWS via IWWC telephone notification.
            7.10.1.2.1. The on-call standby forecaster is then responsible for notifying the WF
            Chief and/or NCOIC in a timely manner to ensure all applicable SWAP actions can
            be accomplished to maximize resource protection.

Table 7.4. Conditions Requiring Notification/Activation of SWAP standby member.
                                           Weather Conditions
1. One of the following weather watches is issued by 26 OWS:
Tornado
Severe Thunderstorm
Damaging Winds
Measurable Snowfall (Trace or greater < 12 hours)
Freezing precipitation
2. One of the following weather warnings is issued by 26 OWS:
Tornado
Severe Thunderstorm
Damaging Winds
Measurable Snowfall (Trace or greater < 12 hours)
Freezing precipitation
Note: Personnel safety is imperative. WF personnel will respond immediately for all Weather Watches
requiring recall. If, in the opinion of WF personnel, there is a significant hazard to life or limb (active
Tornado Warning) personnel will delay reporting to the WF until deemed safe. WF personnel will keep
in contact with the OWS and during the delay.

        7.10.1.3. Activation. The duty forecaster will discuss the meteorological situation,
        manning requirements, and the recall of additional personnel (or place on standby)..
            7.10.1.3.1. Given the manning construct within the 437 OSS/OSW, there is only one
            person available for recall, usually the WF Chief or NCOIC. If deemed necessary the
            member will report to the weather station as soon as possible after notification by the
            duty forecaster.
JBCHARLESTONI15-101 7 NOVEMBER 2013                                                             33


          7.10.1.3.2. Once the SWAP member has arrived, if available, they will assist in
          evaluating the situation, determine the need/availability to recall additional personnel,
          and execute the member/team chief duties/responsibilities..
       7.10.1.4. Post Event Procedures. If severe weather occurs the following procedures will
       be executed as necessary:
          7.10.1.4.1. 437 OSS/OSW personnel’s home and cell phone numbers will be
          reviewed monthly or when a change in personnel occurs to ensure the most current
          numbers are available for SWAP.
   7.10.2. 26 OWS Responsibilities. 26 OWS will accomplish the following procedures when
   severe weather is determined likely:
       7.10.2.1. Activate the SWAP to include: Floor Manager (FM), RADAR Operator, and
       other required individuals when required.
   7.10.3. Post Event Procedures. If severe weather occurs, accomplish the following:
       7.10.3.1. The 26 OWS SWAP leader will perform a “data save” and provide all pertinent
       information to the 437 OSS/OSW flight leadership. The 26 OWS flight leadership will
       compile the information and provide a summary to the 26 OWS/DO.
   7.10.4. OPREP-3/Severe Weather Reporting Procedures. Following an event in which one of
   the following severe elements occurred (wind > 50 knots, hail > 3/4 inch, tornadoes,
   lightning strikes, and snow storms) and damage was reported, the 437 OSS/OSW will
   provide information detailed in Attachment 2 to the 628 ABW/CP.
       7.10.4.1. Provide the 628 ABW/CP with the following information required for inclusion
       in an OPREP-3 report produced by the Joint Base Charleston Commander:
       7.10.4.2. Actual severe weather experienced.
       7.10.4.3. Terminal Aerodrome Forecast (TAF) valid at the time of occurrence.
       7.10.4.4. Any watches, warnings and/or advisories issued to include actual and desired
       lead-time.
       7.10.4.5. Operational status of meteorological equipment.
       7.10.4.6. Notify 26 OWS and AMC/A3AW of the OPREP-3 report and information
       submitted for inclusion.
       7.10.4.7. 437 OSS/OSW will provide the 26 OWS severe weather reports not normally
       available through standard observations.
          7.10.4.7.1. Reports will be passed immediately after fulfilling any local distribution
          requirement. If this is not possible, WF will pass the reports as soon as possible so the
          26 OWS can use the reports during post-analysis and verification.
7.11. Chemical Downwind Messages (CDM)/Effective Downwind Messages (EDM). The WF is the
primary unit for providing CDM/EDM support. CDM bulletins can be found on the OWS website at:

   7.11.1. They are used to determine the spread of chemical and biological agents that are
   released. The EDM bulletin is produced by AFWA twice a day based on 00Z and 12Z
   weather data and is used for forecasting threat areas for fallout from a nuclear detonation.
   7.11.2. WF is responsible for providing only meteorological data towards the calculation of
   Toxic Corridor products. The OWS may also supplement the WF with this weather data-only
   support, if required.
   7.11.3. 628 CES/CEX and/or 628 CES/CEF have the primary responsibility for producing
   the Toxic Corridor.
7.12. Tropical Monitoring. The Weather Flight will monitor the Atlantic Ocean, the Caribbean
Sea and the Gulf of Mexico for tropical disturbances throughout Hurricane season. The National
Hurricane Center, a division of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) will
identify and categorize threat areas on the following product: Graphical Tropical Weather
Outlook. The WF will use this product to posture for additional Hurricane support for Joint Base
Charleston.
7.13. Hurricane Advisory Support.
   7.13.1. The WF receives the National Hurricane Center (NHC) tropical cyclone forecasts.
   These forecasts are issued as military and public advisories, and include information
   describing the initial and forecast locations, movement, intensity, and horizontal dimensions
   of significant winds. Forecasts, which could change Hurricane Conditions, will be relayed to
   Command Post and/or the 628 ABW CAT.
       7.13.1.1. The WF will not deviate from the official NHC forecast position, track,
       movement, maximum wind speed, or intensity. However, the WF can provide tailored
       weather forecasts for JB CHS based on the NHC forecast.
       7.13.1.2. The tailored forecasts for JB CHS will be collaborated with the 26 OWS in the
       form of a Tropical Cyclone Threat Assessment Product that is posted to the 26 OWS
       webpage when a tropical system poses a threat to the 26 OWS AOR.

                     WEATHER INFORMATION DISSEMINATION

8.1. General. Forecasts, observations, and weather alerts (warnings, watches, and advisories)
are useful only if the customers have access to them. Timely and efficient dissemination of
weather information is crucial to the success of the wing mission and resource protection. Most
organizations will receive this information via our primary dissemination system (JET/IWWC)
in order to allow the WF to focus on incoming weather phenomena. This chapter describes the
weather dissemination systems, dissemination procedures, and back-up systems and procedures.
8.2. Dissemination Systems and Back-ups.
   8.2.1. JET / IWWC. Currently the WF uses the JET platform as its primary method of
   disseminating warnings, watches, and advisories. JET consists of a local server connected to
   the internet with an integrated telephone system. JET is a web based interface accessible
   through Internet Explorer. Agencies will receive critical weather information via automated
   telephone dissemination and then pass it through their unit’s own dissemination system (e.g.
   Pyramid Alert Recall, Unit Control Center, etc). During JET outages, the WF will make
   manual telephone calls to Command Post and Airfield Management for warnings, watches,
   and advisories covering Charleston Airfield. During JET outages, the OWS will notify the
   Weapons Station Dispatch and Short Stay Recreation Area for products covering those
   locations.
JBCHARLESTONI15-101 7 NOVEMBER 2013                                                      37


Figure 8.1. OWS (IWWC) to Base WWA Notification Pyramid Structure Diagram.




NOTE: Airfield Management utilizes the Crash Net to disseminate watch, warning, and advisory
notices. This is a pre-programmed system, used for a variety of emergency functions, and may
create a redundancy in notifications with Command Post.

   8.2.2. Web Based Viewing: All JB CHS WWAs will be viewable by anyone with NIPR access
   to the 26 OWS website. The following link shows all valid WWAs issued for JB CHS:
   https://ows.barksdale.af.mil/By_Type/wwa/index.cfm?fuseaction=opsii_wwa&sites=&ic
   ao=KIGC&wwa_icao=KIGC&UID=72&BW=H&UF=O&AOR=1&USEHF=1
   8.2.3. Local Area Network (LAN). The LAN is the primary method used for disseminating
   web-based MWPs. Additionally, it is used as the backup system for disseminating (longline
   only) and receiving all weather information. In the event of a LAN outage, web-based MWPs
   will be faxed to requestors or may be verbally updated.
   8.2.4. Hotlines. Hotlines have been installed between WF and other agencies for the sole
   purpose of rapidly exchanging weather data. Normal phone lines will be used in the event of
   a hotline outage. Hotlines are installed between the WF and the following agencies (DSN
   prefix 673, commercial prefix 963):
      8.2.4.1. 628 ABW/CP.
      8.2.4.2. North Auxiliary Airfield ATC.
   8.2.5. Climatic Data Requests. Upon request from an authorized agency (as deemed
   appropriate by flight leadership and 628 ABW/PA), provide climatology data for JB CHS
   and other locations. Requests may be made by phone, e-mail, letter or in person.
8.3. Tornado Warnings. The 628 ABW/CP has the primary responsibility for sounding the
base siren in the event of a tornado warning issuance.
8.4. TAFs.
   8.4.1. Charleston Airfield. The National Weather Service has primary responsibility for
   disseminating the TAF for Charleston Airfield via non-military systems.
      8.4.1.1. TAFs can be viewed at the following link by typing KCHS into the Obs & TAFs
      field:

   8.4.2. North Auxiliary Field. North Auxiliary Field does not have a TAF.
8.5. Observations.
   8.5.1. Charleston Airfield. The FAA has primary responsibility for disseminating the
   observation for Charleston Airfield via non-military systems.
   8.5.2. North Auxiliary Field. The FMQ-19, a non-augmented automated military system
   automatically transmits the observations for North Auxiliary Field.

9.1. General. This chapter provides a brief description of the meteorological and
communications equipment used by the WF. Additionally, it provides information on backup
systems, maintenance, and restoring priorities.
9.2. Meteorological Equipment. The official weather observation at JB CHS is taken by an
Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS) and augmented by a certified FAA weather observer
who ensures the accuracy of the ASOS observations. The WF uses the FMQ-19, Automated
Observing System, as the primary system at North Auxiliary Airfield to determine the current state of
the atmosphere. Note: TMQ-53 is a tactical automated observing system that is used by the WF
during contingency and exercise operations. The TMQ-53 provides a capability that is very similar
to the FMQ-19. The following is a list of the meteorological systems used by the WF:
   9.2.1. FMQ-19. The FMQ-19 samples, measures, and reports: temperature, wind speed and
   direction, visibility, cloud base height and amount of coverage, pressure, liquid equivalent
   precipitation accumulation, and ice accretion during freezing precipitation. These
   measurements are processed to create properly formatted, fully automated observations that
   comply with applicable various reporting standards and protocols defined in the Federal
   Meteorological Handbook (FMH-1), the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the
   Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), National Weather Service (NWS), and military
   reporting standards.
   9.2.2. TMQ-53. The TMQ-53 is a tactical system that samples, measures, and reports:
   temperature, wind speed and direction, visibility, cloud base height and amount of coverage,
   pressure, and liquid equivalent precipitation accumulation. During FMQ-19 outages, the WF
   will deploy the TMQ-53 to North Auxiliary Field to provide weather data to tower personnel.
   9.2.3. FAA ASOS. The ASOS samples, measures, and reports: temperature, wind speed and
   direction, visibility, cloud base height and amount of coverage, pressure, liquid equivalent
   precipitation accumulation, and ice accretion during freezing precipitation. These
   measurements are processed to create properly formatted, fully automated observations that
   comply with applicable various reporting standards and protocols defined in the Federal
   Meteorological Handbook (FMH-1), the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the
   Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and National Weather Service (NWS).
   9.2.4. Lightning Detection. The WF uses an Internet based communication system that
   retrieves lightning data from the National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN) for the
   entire United States. This system is augmented by a web-based application on the AFW-
   WEBS site.
   9.2.5. Gibson Ridge. The Gibson Ridge software is our primary weather radar. The 26 OWS
   website, commercial weather service WeatherTap and the NWS homepage provides our
   backup sources of radar information.
9.3. Communications Equipment. Just as vital as meteorological equipment, communications
equipment allows the WF to get the right information to the right customer. The following
systems are the backbone of the WF communications network.
JBCHARLESTONI15-101 7 NOVEMBER 2013                                                            41


   9.3.1. JET. As discussed in Chapter 9, this is our primary system for disseminating
   warnings, watches, and advisories. Telephones are used as a backup for key agencies.
       9.3.1.1. The JET is the Primary system for disseminating observations from the FMQ-19
       at North Auxiliary Field and the TMQ-53 when in use as the backup to the FMQ-19.
   9.3.2. PMSV. The Pilot-To-Metro-Service allows the WF to communicate with aircrews,
   both on the ground and flying. During non-duty hours aircrews can contact the 26 OWS via
   phone patch (where possible) and/or the following locations:
       Base                   PMSV Frequency         Base                   PMSV Frequency
       Pope AFB, NC           344.6                  Robins AFB, GA         349.85
       Hunter AAF, GA         309.0                  Shaw AFB, SC           342.5


   9.3.3. Phones/Hotlines. Phones and hotlines primarily serve as backup system as well as for
   passing along critical, time-sensitive information rapidly.
   9.3.4. LAN. The WF relies heavily on the local area network to improve the timeliness and
   accuracy of weather intelligence to our customers. Much information can be obtained
   through other methods (e.g. satellite imagery, lightning data, etc.) but is far less efficient.
9.4. Maintenance.
Organization                                        Equipment
628 CS/SCOA (METNAV 963-2666)                       FMQ-19 (All Sensors)

628 CS/SCOS (Help Desk 963-2666)                    LAN/Internet Connectivity


9.5. Restoring Priorities Priorities for restoring critical systems have been established in the
event natural disasters, or any other anomaly, simultaneously impact systems base-wide.
Significant indicates a situation where the equipment is completely inoperative while minimal
means the equipment is in limited operation. The priorities for weather equipment are listed
below (priorities may be adjusted based on incoming weather):
Equipment                       Organization                      Response Times
                                                                  Significant/Minimal
ASOS                            FAA maintenance                   3 hours/Never
FMQ-19                          628 CS/SCOA                       6 hours/24 hours
JET Server                      628 CS/SCOO                       3 hours/24 hours
LAN/Internet Connectivity       628 CS/SCOS                       3 hours/Never

9.6. Outages. A NOTAM will be issued for all equipment outages expected to last greater than
12 hours.

                                          Chapter 10

                               OWS/WF BACK-UP SUPPORT

10.1. 26 OWS Outages. The 26 OWS is heavily dependent upon communication and
communication equipment; therefore, the 26 OWS is susceptible to a multitude of system
outages that could cause a wide range of changes in mission capability. The 26 OWS has
established back-up procedures that are flexible and designed to meet the requirements identified
in AFMAN 15-129V2.
10.2. Three-Tier Back-Up Support. IAW AFMAN 15-128 the 26 OWS will back-up the
following products and services in prioritized order: Tier 1, Tier 2 and Tier 3. The criteria
defined for each tier is listed below.
   10.2.1. Tier 1 products and services supporting wartime, contingency and/or force protection
   missions that must be backed up via immediate transfer to backup organization, including:
   Combined/Joint Operations Area Forecast (C/JOAF); forecast weather watches, warnings
   and advisories, and space warnings; flight weather briefings; military operating area forecasts
   (MOAF); Controlling Mission Weather Products (CMWP); flight weather hazards in the
   combatant command AOR; TAFs; CBRN hazard products (CDMs/EDMs); classified
   products and services.
       10.2.1.1. Tier 2 products and services supporting peacetime and/or exercise missions that
       will be backed up to the greatest extent possible after satisfying Tier 1 requirements
       including CONUS JOAFs, flight weather briefings, MOAFs, CMWPs, flight weather
       hazards, TAFs and other products and services.
       10.2.1.2. Tier 3 products and services supporting peacetime mission planning that will be
       backed up as resources permit after satisfying Tier 1 and Tier 2 requirements, including
       long range forecasts, space weather, climatology, staff support and other products and
       services.
10.3. Alternate Sources of Weather Information. The 26 OWS has established an agreement
with 15 OWS to host an alternate 26 OWS website (https://ows.scott.af.mil/
index.cfm?fuseaction=main&UID=&BW=H&UF=B&AOR=26&USEHF=1) that contains a
select package of key products. Additionally, supported units may access JAAWIN, other OWSs,
or the National Weather Service websites for weather products.
10.4. Contact with WF. When the 26 OWS implements back-up procedures due to mission
capability loss/degradation, it will contact each WFs primary 24-hour POC or alternate if
necessary and provide a brief description of the problem(s) and impacts. The 26 OWS will also
notify WFs when mission capability is restored.
10.5. Power/Communication Outages at Charleston WF. When an outage on JB CHS affects
WF support, the WF will notify the 26 OWS. The WF will request backup support as needed to
meet mission requirements.
   10.5.1. Alternate Operating Location (AOL). The WF will notify the 26 OWS in case of
   evacuation/relocation to an AOL and again immediately upon arrival at the AOL. The WF
   will also identify any changes to the weather warning and advisory dissemination procedures.
   The WF AOL is located in Bldg 506.
JBCHARLESTONI15-101 7 NOVEMBER 2013                                                         43


  10.5.2. Operational Impacts at AOL. Expect most services to be somewhat degraded
  (weather products, pilot briefings, etc) due to limited facilities and loss of dedicated data
  services, including sensors and various data types (Metsat, radar imagery, etc).

             FORECAST SPECIFICATION AND AMENDMENT CRITERIA

A4.1. Specification Criteria. The TAF will specify the time of occurrence, the duration, and
the intensity (if applicable) of expected weather conditions. The following weather criteria will
be specified in Charleston Airfield TAF if expected to occur during the forecast period by the
National Weather Service. North Auxiliary Airfield, Naval Weapon Station and Short Stay
Recreational Area do not have a TAF. NOTE: The TAF for Charleston Airfield is created by the
NWS following the National Weather Service Instruction 10-813. While close to USAF
procedures, there will be variations between USAF and NWS criteria. Support requirements are
coordinated between the NWS and the WF but final criteria determinations are at the NWS
discretion.
   A4.1.1. Ceiling is forecast to decrease less than, or if below, is forecast to equal or exceed
   any of the following levels:
      Ceiling
      3000 feet
      2000 feet
      1000 feet
      600 feet
      200 feet

   A4.1.2. Visibility is forecast to decrease, or if below, is forecast to increase to equal or
   exceed any of the following value.
        Visibility
        5 miles
        3 miles
        2 mile
        1 mile
        ½ mile

   A4.1.3. A change in wind speed of 10 knots or more, or a change in wind direction greater
   than 30 degrees when the predominant wind speed or gust is expected to be in excess of 15
   knots.
   A4.1.4. Icing and/or turbulence at or below 10,000 feet are not specified for by the NWS.
   A4.1.5. Precipitation.
   A4.1.6. Any weather warning or advisory criteria that can be specified in the TAF. Due to
   differences between the NWS and AF criteria, lead times may not be the same as 437
   OSS/OSW or 26 OWS warnings.
JBCHARLESTONI15-101 7 NOVEMBER 2013                                                             59


   A4.1.7. Thunderstorms.
   A4.1.8. Non-convective low-level wind shear.
A4.2. TAF Amendments. Forecasters will ensure the TAF is representative of expected or
actual conditions. Forecasters will amend the TAF:

   last more than 30 minutes, and is not correctly forecasted by the next whole hour from the
   time of the occurrence.
   A4.2.2. Anytime a forecast condition does not occur by the specified hour and is not
   expected to occur within the next 30 minutes.
A4.3. Amendment Criteria. The TAF will be amended by the NWS for the criteria listed
below.
   A4.3.1. When the ceiling or visibility is observed, or later forecast, to increase to or exceed,
   or decrease to less than any of the following levels, and was not specified in the TAF:

       2000 feet    3 miles
       1000 feet    2 mile
       600 feet     1 mile
       200 feet     ½ mile

   A4.3.2. When a change in wind speed of 10 knots or more, or a change in wind direction
   greater than 30 degrees when the predominant wind speed or gust is expected to be greater
   than 15 knots.
   A4.3.3. Precipitation when:
      A4.3.3.1. Unforecasted freezing precipitation begins or ends.
      A4.3.3.2. The beginning or ending of precipitation causes local NWS weather warnings
      or advisories, that can be specified in the TAF, to be issued, canceled, or amended.
   A4.3.4. Non-convective low level wind shear:
      A4.3.4.1. Is occurring and expected to continue, or is expected to begin, but is not
      specified in the forecast.

    A5.1.1. Station identifier – also called the ICAO. This code identifies the location of the
    observation (in this case KCHS and KXNO).
    A5.1.2. Type of observation. There are three types of observations as described below:
          A5.1.2.1. Aviation Routine Weather Report (METAR). An observation taken each hour,
          between H+55 and H+59.
          A5.1.2.2. Special Observation (SPECI). An observation taken as a result of one of the
          special criteria (listed in attachment 3) being met.
          A5.1.2.3. Local Observation (LOCAL). An observation taken as a result of one of the
          local weather criteria (listed in attachment 3) being met.
    A5.1.3. Time. This is the time, in Zulu, or GMT, that the last element of the observation was
    observed.
    A5.1.4. Wind. This portion of the observation provides the wind direction (first 3 numbers,
    VRB for variable, or 000 for calm), sustained wind speed (next 2 or 3 numbers), and wind
    gusts (any numbers following the G, if there have been any) measured in knots. One knot
    equals 1.14 miles per hour.
    A5.1.5. Visibility. The furthest predominant distance (at least 50% of the aerodrome) that
    can be seen from the airfield, reported in statute miles. The most common visibility reported
    is 7 miles.
    A5.1.6. Present weather. Any weather phenomenon that is occurring on the airfield. This is
    mandatory anytime the visibility is less than 7 miles. The table below lists the present
    weather codes.

        into the fog can be seen.
        A5.1.7.7. FEW000 – Surface based obscuration
     A5.1.8. Cloud Height. Three-digit number which provides the height of the base of the cloud
     in hundreds of feet (e.g. 015 equals 1500 feet). The CB and TCU descriptors may be
     appended to the cloud height to indicate that the cloud is a cumulonimbus or towering
     cumulus.
     A5.1.9. Temperature and Dew Point. Can be in either degrees Fahrenheit or Celsius.
     A5.1.10. Altimeter Setting. The current value that aircraft altimeters must be set at to read an
     elevation of zero. The altimeter is measured in inches (INS) of mercury.

   A5.2.1. The forecast follows the same general format as the observation with the following
   exceptions:
       A5.2.1.1. Valid Date/Time. Forecasts are valid for a 24-hour period when produced by
       the National Weather Service and 30-hours for AF TAFs.
       A5.2.1.2. Max Temp/Min Temp. T31 indicates a maximum temperature in Celsius to
       occur on the 31st at 20Z. T18 indicates a minimum temperature of 18 Celsius to occur on
       the 1st at 08Z Note: M indicates a minus sign in front of the number: M05 = -5 C).
       National Weather Service TAFs will not have a Max/Min temp group.

      A5.2.1.3. BECMG. This is a code to indicate that the predominant condition of the sky
      will change to (or become) the conditions listed in that line of the forecast. The
      conditions will change during the time period that follows the BECMG code.
      A5.2.1.4. TEMPO.
         A5.2.1.4.1. National Weather Service TAFs: Temporary fluctuations in forecast
         meteorological conditions which are expected to last less than one (1) hour in each
         instance and, in the aggregate, to cover LT half of the indicated period. The period of
         time covered by a TEMPO group should be the minimum necessary, not to exceed 4
         hours. Use TEMPO groups for high probability (greater than 50%) expectations only.
         A5.2.1.4.2. AF TAFs: Conditions described by the TEMPO group must occur once
         during the specified time-period indicated by the date YY and time GG to the date
         YY and time GeGe, for less than 30 consecutive minutes or occur for an aggregate
         total of less than 30 minutes of every cardinal hour and cover less than half of the
         period indicated by the date YY and time GG to the date YY and time GeGe.
         Exception: Organizations will allow 45 minutes for thunderstorms. The extra 15
         minutes provide for the 15-minute period between the time thunder is last heard and
         the time the thunderstorm is officially ended. If forecast conditions in the TEMPO
         group last more than 30 consecutive minutes or are expected to last more than half of
         the period indicated by the time YYGG to YYGeGe, then the temporary condition
         will be considered to be predominant and entered in the initial forecast period or
         following a FMYYGGgg or BECMG group.
      A5.2.1.5. FM (From).
         A5.2.1.5.1. National Weather Service only. The FM change indicator group
         (FMYYGGgg) will be used to indicate when prevailing conditions are expected to
         change significantly over a period of less than one hour. In these instances, the
         forecast will be sub-divided into time periods using the contraction FM followed,
         without a space, by four digits indicating the time (in hours and minutes in UTC) the
         change is expected to occur. While the use of a four-digit time in whole hours (e.g.,
         2100) is acceptable, if a forecaster should make every effort to forecast changes with
         higher temporal resolution. All forecast elements following FMYYGGgg will relate
         to the period of time from the indicated time (GGgg) to the end of the valid period of
         the terminal forecast, or to the next FMYYGGgg if the terminal forecast valid period
         is divided into additional periods.
