                                             Chapter 1

 RESPONSIBILITIES OF ALL AGENCIES INVOLVED IN THE AIRFIELD DRIVING
                             PROGRAM

1.1. Concept.
     1.1.1. The objective of this Operating Instruction (OI) is to ensure a safe airfield operating
     environment for aircraft and motor vehicle traffic. To help achieve this goal, unit
     commanders will ensure personnel assigned to their units are thoroughly familiar with the
     rules for operating on the airfield. Carelessness, haste, and a disregard for established safety
     standards are the primary reasons of aircraft/vehicle collisions and/or incidents involving
     motor vehicles on the airfield. All references to training for airfield drivers extend to those
     using any mode of motorized or self-propelled transportation. Personnel assigned duties on
     the airfield will be knowledgeable of AFI 13-213 and GFAFBI 13-213.
     1.1.2. The 319 OSS/OSAA is responsible for the Grand Forks AFB Airfield Driving
     Training Program (ADTP). Airfield Management trains and certifies the Unit Airfield
     Driving Program Managers (UADPMs). The UADPMs train and certify unit personnel who
     have a requirement to drive on Grand Forks AFB airfield. All base assigned, tenant units,
     TDY/Contractor, and all other assigned units to GFAFB that operate a vehicle on the airfield
     must complete all training and testing requirements. Airfield experience (i.e. operating
     vehicles or aircraft) is not a substitute for completion of airfield driving training and testing
     requirements.
1.2. Responsibilities
     1.2.1. 319th Air Base Wing Commander (319 ABW/CC)
        1.2.1.1. Designate personnel and agencies to support the airfield driving program (ADP).
        1.2.1.2. Has waiver authority for policies in this instruction and the authority to reinstate
        airfield driving privileges in writing to perform mission essential duties following
        suspension/revocation of base driving privileges. Unit Airfield Driving Program
        Managers (UADPM) must coordinate with the Deputy Airfield Manager (DAFM) to
        finalize reinstatement. UADPM must provide a copy of the 319 ABW/CC approval letter
        for record. Authority must not be delegated.
        1.2.1.3. Approves publication of the Airfield Driving Instruction (ADI).
        1.2.1.4. Requests an Air Force Runway Safety Action Team (AFRSAT) through the
        MAJCOM if there are recurring problems with Controlled Movement Area Violations
        (CMAV). Reference AFI 13-204, Volume 2, Airfield Operations Standardization and
        Evaluations for additional information.
        1.2.1.5. Reviews CMAVs incidents and corrective actions taken.
     1.2.2. 319th Mission Support Group Commander (319 MSG/CC)
        1.2.2.1. Reviews CMAVs and corrective actions taken.
GRANDFORKSAFBI13-213 30 NOVEMBER 2012                                                      7


    1.2.2.2. Implements and chairs a Runway Incursion Prevention Working Group
    (RIPWG) if there are more than two runway incursions within a six month period. Note:
    The RIPWG shall convene within 30 days after the second runway incursion.
       1.2.2.2.1. The RIPWG will include OSS/CC, AOF/CC, Airfield Manager (AFM),
       Wing ADPM, Tower Chief Controller, Wing Safety, Unit Commanders and/or unit
       ADPMs, and other organizational leadership as determined locally. RIPWG shall
       take the following actions:
           1.2.2.2.1.1. Analyze each runway incursion and corrective actions taken.
           1.2.2.2.1.2. Evaluate the airfield driving operating procedures/standards and
           airfield configuration (to include signs/marking/lighting) to determine if

   suspend/revoke airfield driving privileges by unit commanders and unit ADPMs are limited
   to their unit personnel only. Note: The difference between a suspension and revocation is the
   duration. A suspension is 30 days or less, whereas a revocation is more than 30 days. See
   Table 3.1.
   3.2.4. As a minimum, entering the runway and/or CMA without contact and/or approval
   from the Control Tower will result in an automatic 30-day suspension of airfield driving
   privileges. Retraining must be accomplished. Note: Certain situations may dictate a longer
   suspension/revocation of license.
   3.2.5. The authority making the temporary suspension must immediately notify AM and
   explain the circumstances that led to the suspension. Upon receipt, AM determines whether
   or not to continue the suspension, revocation, or reinstate the individual‘s airfield driving
   privileges.
   3.2.6. All personnel assigned to AM are authorized to confiscate the AF IMT 483 along with
   suspending/revoking the airfield driving privileges of anyone who is in violation of the
   airfield driving rules. The details of any suspension/revocation will be recorded and
   forwarded to the respective unit commander and the ADPM. The driver will also be informed
   that he/she must immediately leave the airfield, or have an authorized airfield driver drive
   his/her vehicle.
   3.2.7. Anyone with the authority to temporarily suspend/revoke an individual‘s airfield
   driving privileges must be an authorized airfield driver.
   3.2.8. Provide AM with all relevant facts surrounding the incident that explains the who,
   what, where, and when of the incident. Further, any statement must be made within 1 duty
   day of the incident that prompted the recommendation.

                             OPERATING ON THE AIRFIELD

4.1. Speed Limits on the Airfield.
   4.1.1. All vehicles within 25 feet of aircraft: 5 MPH.
   4.1.2. Special purpose vehicles (e.g. bobtail, tug, k-loader): 10 MPH.
   4.1.3. Night Vision Device (NVD) wearers/blackout operations: 15 MPH.
   4.1.4. General purpose vehicles and POVs: 15 MPH (30 MPH on all Taxiways and 45 on the
   Runway).
   4.1.5. Speed limits for towing aircraft, equipment, and trailers.
       4.1.5.1. Aircraft tow vehicle: 5 MPH.
       4.1.5.2. The maximum towing speed for Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE) such as
       compressors, ground power units, oxygen carts, and similar equipment: 15 MPH.
       NOTE: General purpose vehicles will not be used to tow this equipment unless properly
       equipped with hitches designed for that purpose. Pintle hook safety or cotter pins will be
       used during all towing operations. Safety chains are not required to tow AGE. Towing
       allowances (number/type of AGE) will be IAW AFOSHTD 91-100, Aircraft Flightline
       Ground Operations and Activities.
       4.1.5.3. Do not use ropes, chains, cables or other flexible means of towing ground
       servicing equipment.
       4.1.5.4. AGE towing vehicles may be placed in neutral and left running while the driver
       completes hook-up operations. This facilitates movement of the AGE towing vehicle by
       hand to align the pintle and hook. Drivers must shut off the vehicle, set the parking brake,
       and place the vehicle in park or reverse if the AGE equipment will not be towed
       immediately following hook-up.
   4.1.6. Drivers will use good judgment during inclement weather and snow operations.
   4.1.7. When passing an extremely slow-moving vehicle on the airfield, your overtaking
   speed must not exceed the authorized speed limit imposed for your vehicle type.
   4.1.8. Speed limit exceptions - The following vehicles may exceed speed limits only when
   personnel and property are not endangered (will travel at a safe rate of speed). Drivers will
   use good judgment (not all emergencies require exceeding the speed limit) when exceeding
   the speed limit and will use any/all emergency lights and sirens to help alert nearby drivers.
       4.1.8.1. Emergency response vehicles responding to real-world emergencies.
       4.1.8.2. Snow removal vehicles performing snow removal operations.
       4.1.8.3. ―Follow Me‖ vehicles to accommodate the optimum safe taxiing speed of
       aircraft.
       4.1.8.4. AMOPS, 319 ABW/CC, and 319 MSG/CC vehicles in the performance of
       official duties.
 30                                       GRANDFORKSAFBI13-213 30 NOVEMBER 2012


      4.1.8.5. Any vehicle when the Control Tower advises you to ―expedite‖ or uses the term
      ―immediately.‖
4.2. Right of Way Procedures.
   4.2.1. Vehicle operators will yield to aircraft, either taxiing or being towed, by moving to a
   position clear of the intended path of the aircraft.
   4.2.2. Under no circumstances will vehicles halt in front of, drive between, or drive into the
   path of taxiing aircraft.
   4.2.3. Airfield drivers must be cautious for aircraft with engines operating, and scan the
   immediate area for the presence of a marshaller. At no time will any vehicle pass between an
   aircraft and a ground marshaller in position.
   4.2.4. Vehicles in traffic lanes will have right of way over other non-emergency vehicles.
   4.2.5. Vehicles responding to an emergency have the right of way over all non-emergency
   vehicles. The Control Tower may notify ground traffic to "HOLD POSITION" when
   emergency (crash) equipment moves out to cover the emergency. AM vehicles are exempt
   from this restriction but must give way to Emergency Vehicles. Normally, ground operations
   will resume after the emergency has been terminated. Ground movements may be approved
   on a case-by-case basis, such as snow removal operations, prior to emergency termination
   after coordination with the on-scene commander/fire chief. These requests may be made by
   AM, Snow Control or Control Tower.
   4.2.6. During snow removal operations all vehicles must yield the right-of-way to, and
   remain clear of Snow removal equipment and the AM vehicle while RSC/RCR checks are in
   progress.
   4.2.7. Proximity to Aircraft (including helicopters).
      4.2.7.1. Vehicles will not be backed, parked, or driven closer than 25 feet in front of or
      200 feet to the rear of any aircraft, except as authorized for operations such as loading or
      unloading, servicing, towing, or as prescribed in the applicable aircraft handbook.
      4.2.7.2. Helicopter operations. A clear zone of 200 feet either side of helicopter
      operations is required to permit a safe departure or approach route. A minimum clearance
      of 100 feet should be maintained around helicopters that are parked with rotors turning.
          4.2.7.2.1. Personnel will avoid operating vehicles in the vicinity of the helicopter
          landing areas because of the inherent hazards involved (e.g. high velocity down wash
          and small rotor blade to ground clearance). Personnel outside of vehicles with no eye
          or hearing protection are more vulnerable when near operating helicopters.
          4.2.7.2.2. Anytime an airfield vehicle operator observes a helicopter landing or
          departing, or preparing to depart, they will immediately stop to determine its intended
          direction/intentions. Vehicle operators may turn on their emergency flashers to
          indicate to the helicopter pilot that the driver has observed the helicopter. Under no
          circumstances will vehicles drive under or across the flight path of a departing or
          arriving helicopter. If in doubt as to what a helicopter is doing, always err on the side
          of caution and choose another route that will take you away from it.
GRANDFORKSAFBI13-213 30 NOVEMBER 2012                                                            31


   4.2.8. Vehicles will operate right of taxiway centerline in reference to the direction of travel.
   Remain on concrete portion between centerline and asphalt shoulders.
   4.2.9. Under no circumstances will vehicles park, block, or drive in the path of taxiing
   aircraft or one that is being towed. When a vehicle must avoid interfering with the progress
   of a towed or taxiing aircraft, they will reverse direction or pull onto the nearest available
   access road and remain behind the wing tip safety clearance lines/vehicle stop sign. As a last
   resort, vehicles should be driven off paved surfaces to ensure adequate wingtip clearance
   (200 feet from the taxiway centerline) for the aircraft. Note: Vehicles leaving paved surfaces
   must complete a rollover FOD check immediately upon reentering to the paved surface.
4.3. Vehicle Operations and Safety Procedures. Vehicles will not be parked in the immediate
vicinity of any aircraft, except as authorized for support. A spotter will be used when a vehicle is
backed towards an aircraft. Pre-positioned wheel chocks will be used to prevent vehicles from
being backed into aircraft. Vehicles will be parked in a manner to allow departure without
backing unless a spotter is used.
   4.3.1. Vehicles shall only park in non-designated areas when the mission requires it. All
   vehicles parked in non-designated areas must ensure vehicles do not impede the flow of
   traffic and be parked only long enough for the occupants to perform necessary actions.

   the aircraft.
   4.3.3. All personnel will use seat belts/shoulder harness (when provided) while the vehicle is
   in motion.
   4.3.4. Military and Department of Defense (DOD) civilian personnel will not ride in the
   back of or in/on other areas of any vehicle not normally intended for occupants. However, in
   unique situations where military necessity dictates, personnel may ride in these areas
   provided the following rules are complied with:
   4.3.5. Remain seated while the vehicle is in motion and keep arms and legs within the
   vehicle body.
       4.3.5.1. Do not ride in the doorways or sit on the engine cover of metro vans (also called
       step vans or bread trucks). Rear door nets will be in place while passengers are
       transported while the doors are open.
       4.3.5.2. Keep side doors on passenger vans closed when the vehicle is in motion.
       4.3.5.3. Do not ride on tugs or towing vehicles unless a suitable seat with back and side
       guard or other safety device is installed.
       4.3.5.4. All cab positions with seat belts will be occupied before anyone is placed in the
       utility box.
       4.3.5.5. Before personnel sit in the bed of a pickup truck, they will ensure any objects
       that might cause unsafe footing are removed. All occupants will sit only on the floor of
       the bed with their backs against the cab, or the sides of the bed (not against the tailgate).
       No portion of any occupant‘s body will overhang the vehicle‘s sides or rear.
   4.3.6. Using the airfield for convenience is prohibited.

   4.3.7. Vehicles will not pass an aircraft that is taxiing or being towed.
   4.3.8. Vehicle operators will not drive/park beneath any portion of an aircraft, unless
   required for the performance of duty. Exception: Operation of Bobcats for snow removal
   under and around aircraft. Use of a spotter for these vehicles is mandatory. When backing a
   vehicle during loading or unloading, a spotter must be used and pre-positioned wheel chocks
   will be placed between the aircraft and approaching vehicle to prevent vehicles from striking
   the aircraft.
   4.3.9. Vehicle operators will not operate a vehicle within 50 feet of any fueling or defueling
   operation unless specifically authorized by MAJCOM directives, and never if a fuel spill has
   occurred.
   4.3.10. Airfield drivers must be vigilant for aircraft with engines operating and scan the
   immediate area for the presence of a marshaller. At no time will any vehicle pass between an
   aircraft and a ground marshaller in position or between an aircraft and ―Follow Me‖ vehicle.
   4.3.11. Under no circumstances will vehicles halt in front of, drive between, drive past, or
   drive into the path of taxiing aircraft. Transient Alert ―Follow Me‖ vehicles may drive in the
   path of taxiing aircraft during the performance of their duties.
   4.3.12. Vehicles will not be backed, parked, or driven closer than 25 feet in front of or 200
   feet to the rear of any aircraft, except as authorized for operations such as loading or
   unloading, servicing, towing, or as prescribed in the applicable aircraft handbook.
   4.3.13. At any time when approaching an aircraft, operators will position the driver‘s side of
   the vehicle closest to the aircraft. A spotter will be used when a vehicle is backed towards an
   aircraft. Pre-positioned wheel chocks will be used to prevent vehicles from being backed into
   aircraft.
4.4. Unattended Airfield Vehicles.
   4.4.1. The vehicle must be turned off, the keys left in the ignition, and doors unlocked.
   4.4.2. Vehicles will not be left unattended with the engine running with the exception of
   maintenance vehicles under the following circumstances:
      4.4.2.1. Personnel will actively be performing aircraft maintenance.
      4.4.2.2. The ambient air temperature, not the wind chill, is zero degrees Fahrenheit or
      colder.
      4.4.2.3. The vehicle is in park.

   power shall:
       4.5.1.1. Make every effort to move vehicle from blocking the flow of traffic.
       4.5.1.2. Use all available means to alert taxiing aircraft that the vehicle has broken down
       if it is located in an area of the airfield where it may impede the progress of taxiing/towed
       aircraft.
       4.5.1.3. Leave the vehicle parking lights or emergency flashers on if a malfunction
       occurs.
       4.5.1.4. Immediately use any means available (two-way radio, cell phone, etc.) to contact
       your duty section and AM, state the nature of the problem and your location on the
       airfield.
       4.5.1.5. Stay with the vehicle and try to flag down another vehicle for assistance.
       4.5.1.6. If the vehicle has two-way radio capability, make the following transmission:
       “All parties BREAK, BREAK-This is (call sign) with an emergency for Airfield
       Management, Tower, and Maintenance Operations Center”. State the nature of the
       problem and report your position on the airfield.
4.6. Jet Blast. Watch for jet blast/rotor hazards due to parked aircraft with their engines
running. Propeller/rotor wash and jet blast can propel debris and objects causing damage to other
aircraft, vehicles or injuring personnel. When aircraft engines are operating or being started, no
vehicle will be parked or driven closer than 25 feet in front of or 200 feet to the rear of any
aircraft, except as prescribed in the applicable aircraft handbook. Vehicles parked at the side of
the aircraft will be located clear of the wingtips, clearly visible to personnel in the aircraft
cockpit.
4.7. Restricted Visibility.
   4.7.1. When visibility is less than 300 feet, refueling and explosive loaded (laden) vehicles
   will not be operated unless directed by the wing or installation commander.

             CONTROLLED MOVEMENT AREA (CMA) PROCEDURES

7.1. Runway Access Procedures.
   7.1.1. Driving procedures will be IAW GFAFBI 13-213, Airfield Driving. The CMA (see
   Attachment 12) consists of:
      7.1.1.1. The runway and overruns.
      7.1.1.2. All areas between the runway and the VFR hold lines/signs.
      7.1.1.3. The first 185ft of all vehicle access roads leading from the west edge of the
      runway, defined by a white ―stop bar‖ painted on the access road and a ―STOP, CMA‖
      sign located adjacent to the stop bar.
      7.1.1.4. The first 400ft of the vehicle access leading from the north overrun, defined by a
      ―stop bar‖ and a ‗STOP CMA‖ sign. NOTE: Drivers reporting off the runway when
      leaving the overrun must also report off the CMA.
      7.1.1.5. The southern boundary is located just north of the south localizer support shelter
      (1,900ft from end of runway) and is marked with a white ―stop bar‖ and ―STOP, CMA‖
      sign.
         7.1.1.5.1. A white stop bar is also located just off the south end of the south overrun.
         This stop bar is for FOD checks and is marked with a ―Check for FOD‖ sign.
         NOTE: Vehicles that report ―OFF THE RUNWAY‖ at the south overrun are still in
         the controlled movement area. Drivers who report off the runway but remain in the
         CMA must request and receive permission from the tower before proceeding back on
         to the runway/overrun.
      7.1.1.6. The boundaries of the CMA in the grassy areas will be defined as a line parallel
      to the runway located at the same distance as the VFR hold lines on the east side of the
      runway, and the stop bars located on the vehicle access roads on the west side. This line
      will extend beyond the end of the runway and terminate at a point adjacent to the stop
      bars located on the north/south vehicle access roads. See airfield/CMA diagram on
      Attachment 9 which is depicted as the shaded area.
      7.1.1.7. All vehicles/personnel requesting entry onto the runway from Taxiways Charlie,
      Delta, Echo, Foxtrot, and Golf will remain east of the runway VFR hold lines. For
      vehicles entering the CMA from access roads will remain behind the white Stop Bars.
      Establish radio contact with the Control Tower via the airfield FM ―Ramp‖ net. Fire
      Department vehicles are permitted to use the ―crash‖ FM net. Specific Control Tower
      approval is required for runway access. Only the Control Tower can give approval for
      access. When communicating with the Control Tower, airfield drivers will clearly state
      their request, and read back all Control Tower instructions verbatim. Airfield drivers
      must ensure they wait for confirmation and approval from the Control Tower before
      entering the runway.
      7.1.1.8. Maintain radio contact with the Control Tower the entire time while operating
      within the CMA. Monitor the radio to ensure that radio failure has not occurred. If radio
GRANDFORKSAFBI13-213 30 NOVEMBER 2012                                                          39


      contact is lost, vehicle operators will exit the CMA immediately and will stay out of the
      CMA until communication with the Control Tower is restored. A request for approval
      back into the CMA is required.
      7.1.1.9. Notify the Control Tower as soon as vehicles, personnel, and/or equipment have
      departed the CMA.
   7.1.2. Emergency signals/procedures to exit the runway.
   7.1.3. When the Control Tower needs a vehicle to depart the runway and the vehicle is
   unresponsive to radio calls/Tower light gun signals, the Control Tower will apply the
   following procedures:
      7.1.3.1. When the runway lights are on, increase and/or decrease brightness by one or
      more steps and then return them to the original setting.
      7.1.3.2. When the runway lights are off, turn them on and then turn them off again.
      7.1.3.3. Upon observing the above procedures, vehicles/personnel will immediately
      depart the runway via the nearest taxiway, taking any equipment with them, and remain
      behind the hold line. Once the vehicle/personnel are safely off the runway, contact with
      the Control Tower or Airfield Management. Do not delay exiting the runway in order to
      find out ―why.‖
   7.1.4. If the vehicle operator exits a vehicle while on the runway or within the CMA, a
   portable hand-held radio will be used for monitoring at all times.
   7.1.5. Entering the CMA and crossing the runway merely for convenience is strictly
   prohibited.
   7.1.6. Maintenance crews may work in the grass infield areas with prior coordination with
   AM, but must request approval to proceed within 225 feet east side of the runway and 185
   feet west side of the runway pavement edge from the Control Tower. Direct two-way radio
   communication with Control Tower must be maintained at all times.
   7.1.7. Non-controlled movement area consists of all remaining portions of the airfield (i.e.,
   taxiways the parking ramps and perimeter road). Control Tower approval is not required to
   operate in these areas.
7.2. Radio Communications with the Control Tower.
   7.2.1. Vehicle operators shall look both ways for aircraft landing, departing, or taxiing prior
   to calling the Control Tower.
   7.2.2. Normal communications to the Control Tower will be initiated. Note: The Control
   Tower is often busy on other frequencies and may take some time to respond. Vehicle
   operators should be patient and pause before repeating initial call up. When proceeding onto
   a movement area, vehicle operators must advise the controller of three things: WHO you are,
   WHERE you are, and WHAT your intentions are.
   7.2.3. All vehicle operators will ensure the Control Tower uses their exact call sign. Hearing
   the correct location of your vehicle but the wrong call sign does not give approval for your
   request. For example, if your vehicle‘s call sign is OPS 1 and you are requesting access on
   the runway or CMA and the Control Tower gives approval for OPS 4 to proceed on runway,
40                                       GRANDFORKSAFBI13-213 30 NOVEMBER 2012


  you would not have approval to enter the runway until the Control Tower states the correct
  call sign, even if it appears obvious that you are the only vehicle at that location.
  7.2.4. Prior to moving the vehicle, operators must repeat all instructions verbatim.
  7.2.5. Due to the complexity of air traffic control, other instructions may also be given, so it
  is imperative that vehicle operators listen carefully and repeat exactly the instructions they
  are given.
  7.2.6. The only word that authorizes a vehicle to operate near or enter the controlled
  movement area or runway is ―PROCEED‖. The word ―PROCEED‖ may be accompanied
  with other words or phrases.
  7.2.7. ―HOLD‖ will indicate disapproval of an operator‘s request. ―HOLD‖ may be
  accompanied with other words or phrases; however, if this word is used, the vehicle
  operators will NOT ENTER the runway or CMA, will read back hold instructions, and will
  standby until approval is granted. Note: Operators must transmit what they are holding short
  of e.g. ―HOLD SHORT OF RUNWAY‖. Simply saying ―HOLD SHORT‖ alone is not
  enough.
  7.2.8. When reporting off the runway, the vehicle operator will ensure receipt of a response
  indicating the Control Tower understands they are no longer on the controlled movement
  area or runway.
  7.2.9. To help eliminate miscommunication and possible compromise of safety, it is
  imperative that proper radio phraseology be adhered to. At no time will personnel use the
  words “CLEAR,” “CLEARED” or “CLEARANCE.”
  7.2.10. When a vehicle operator experiences a radio failure on a runway or taxiway, they
  must vacate the runway as quickly and safely as possible and contact the ATCT or AM by
  other means, such as a cellular telephone to advise of the situation. If this is not practical,
  then the driver, after vacating the runway, should turn the vehicle toward the tower and start
  flashing the vehicle headlights and wait for the controller to signal with the light gun. For
  light gun signals and meanings see paragraph 7.5. and 7.6..
  7.2.11. The following is the proper sequence of communication with Control Tower:
     7.2.11.1. Airfield Driver: State who you are calling and your call sign. Example:
     ―Tower, Airfield 4‖.
     7.2.11.2. Control Tower: Acknowledges you and states their call sign. Example:
     ―Airfield 4, Tower‖.
     7.2.11.3. Airfield Driver: State where you currently are and your request (what you need
     to do/where you need to go). Example: ―Tower, Airfield 4 request permission on to
     Runway 35 from Taxiway Charlie‖.
     7.2.11.4. Control Tower: Approves request or communicates other instructions.
     Example: ―Airfield 4 proceed on Runway 35, advise when off‖.
     7.2.11.5. Airfield Driver: Read back verbatim Tower instructions. Example: ―Tower,
     Airfield 4 copies approved on Runway 35, will advise when off‖.
GRANDFORKSAFBI13-213 30 NOVEMBER 2012                                                               41


   7.2.12. Control Tower will advise you to HOLD SHORT of the runway if your request is not
   approved due to aircraft traffic or other circumstances. Driver must read back hold short
   instructions: ―Tower, Airfield4 copies, hold short at taxiway Charlie‖. They will advise you
   when to proceed as per your request.
       7.2.12.1. Once off the runway and across the runway VFR hold line; call the Control
       Tower and report off the runway. Example; Airfield Driver: ―Tower, AFLD 1, is off the
       runway at Taxiway Golf‖
       7.2.12.2. The Control Tower may not respond right away due to communications with an
       aircraft.
       7.2.12.3. If at any time you do not hear or understand Control Tower instructions,
       request the tower to repeat them. Example; Airfield Driver: ―Tower, AFLD 1, say again.‖
       NOTE: The response ―Understand Approved‖ is not an acceptable response to Control
       Tower giving authorization onto the Runway/CMA.
       7.2.12.4. Always repeat the Control Tower‘s directions verbatim.
7.3. Escort Responsibilities for Runway and CMA Access.
   7.3.1. The escort will brief drivers on route, speed, procedures, etc.
   7.3.2. Vehicles or persons without two-way radio communication with the Control Tower
   must be escorted by an individual who is certified and has the proper radio equipment.
   7.3.3. The escort will obtain proper permission for all vehicles/personnel from the Control
   Tower prior to proceeding on or across the runway or CMA.
   7.3.4. The escort should say the word, ―plus‖ and the number that will be accompanying, for
   example: ―Tower, Airfield 4 Plus 5 request to proceed north on Runway 35 from Taxiway
   Charlie‖.
   7.3.5. Escorts shall maintain a close formation at all times and the escort will remain with
   the other vehicles/personnel while on the runway or within the CMA. The escort will
   maintain positive control of the other vehicles/personnel and ensure all vehicles have exited
   Runway/CMA before calling off.
7.4. Phraseology. Radio communication with the Control Tower will be repeated verbatim
while operating on, or requesting to operate within the CMA or the runway.
   7.4.1. The following radio phraseology, definitions and terminology will be used when
   communicating with the Control Tower:

          8.1.8.5.3. Direction Signs. Direction signs have a yellow background with a black
          inscription (Figure 8-4)
              8.1.8.5.3.1. The inscription identifies the designation(s) of the intersecting
              taxiway(s) leading out of the intersection that a pilot would normally be expected
              to turn onto or hold short of. Each designation is accompanied by an arrow
              indicating the direction of the turn.
          8.1.8.5.4. Direction signs are normally located on the left prior to the intersection.
          When used on a runway to indicate an exit, the sign is located on the same side of the
          runway as the exit.

8.2. Airfield Lighting.
   8.2.1. Grand Forks AFB airfield is illuminated by a variety of lights (ramp lighting, taxiway,
   runway, etc). Two lights you will encounter while driving at night on the CMA are taxiway
   lights and High Intensity Runway Lights (HIRL). Taxiway lights are used to outline the
   edges of taxiways during reduced periods of darkness and/or restricted visibility. They emit
   a blue color. HIRL‘s are used to outline the edges of the runways. HIRL‘s emit a white light
   and are evenly spaced the full length of the runway. The following are examples of taxiway
   and runway lights airfield drivers will see while operating on Grand Forks AFB CMA:

8.3. Lateral Distance Requirement for Mobile Obstacles.
   8.3.1. An obstacle is anything that poses a threat to aircraft movement. Obstacles pose an
   immediate hazard to aircraft taxiing and towing operations. Identifying these hazards is
   essential to ensuring the safety of aircraft.
   8.3.2. The lateral clearance distance from taxiway centerline to parked or moving vehicles is
   200 feet. When operating off the edges of a taxiway do not park or operate a vehicle within
   200 feet of the taxiway centerline. No vehicle will be parked and left unattended within 200
   feet of the taxiway centerline without an AMC MAJCOM approved waiver.
   8.3.3. The lateral clearance distance from the edge of all ramps and aprons to a mobile
   obstacle is 50 feet from the wingtip of any aircraft. When operating off the edges of a ramp
   or apron do not park or operate a vehicle within 50 feet of a moving aircraft. To ensure
 50                                        GRANDFORKSAFBI13-213 30 NOVEMBER 2012


   separation from any aircraft, vehicles should park a minimum of 135 feet from the edge of
   taxiway/apron pavement.
   8.3.4. The lateral clearance distance from the runway centerline is 1000 feet. This area is
   located within the CMA and radio contact with ATCT must be established and maintained at
   all times. When operating within this area, do not park and leave a vehicle unattended.
   8.3.5. Mobile ground support equipment can normally be positioned on the airfield
   (taxiways, aprons, arm/de-arm areas, etc.) no sooner than three hours before an arrival and
   must be moved no later than three hours after a departure.
8.4. Precision Obstacle Free Zone (POFZ).
   8.4.1. Precision Obstacle Free Zone (POFZ). This zone is an 800 ft wide by 200 ft long
   rectangular area centered on the runway centerline, beginning at and extending outward from
   the end of runway, designed to protect aircraft flying precision approaches from ground
   vehicles and other aircraft when the ceiling is less than 300 ft, or the visibility is less than 3/4
   statute mile.
   8.4.2. The only portion of the POFZ affected at GFAFB is the northwest corner of the
   hammer head on Taxiway Golf. There are no identifying marks or signs to indicate the
   boundaries of the POFZ. However, the TACAN Check Point sign is a visual indication that
   you are outside the POFZ.
   8.4.3. When the ceiling is less than 300 ft or the visibility is less than 3/4 statute mile, no
   vehicles over 10 ft high or any vertical aircraft surfaces may penetrate this area when an
   aircraft is less than 2 miles on the final approach course to Runway 17. Horizontal aircraft
   surfaces such as wings may penetrate this surface with no restrictions.
   8.4.4. Vehicles more than 10 ft high must be in radio contact with the Tower when inside the
   POFZ and weather conditions dictate the POFZ will be protected.
   8.4.5. Tower will advise drivers to hold at or behind the TACAN Check Point sign until
   inbound aircraft have landed. IAW FAAO JO 7110.65, Tower will advise aircraft on final
   approach to Runway 17 when vehicles or aircraft are unable to exit the POFZ.

                                          Chapter 9

                            MISCELLANEOUS PROCEDURES

9.1. Temporary Restricted Areas and Entry Control Point (ECP).
   9.1.1. Grand Forks AFB has three aprons with temporary restricted area markings. These
   areas are identified with permanent red lines painted on the pavement. Areas are considered
   restricted only when aircraft are present. Entry into these areas is by crossing the ―Entry
   Control Point‖ box painted on the taxi lead-in lines. They are located on Bravo Ramp,
   Charlie Ramp, and Golf Taxiway (hammerhead), see Attachment 9.
   9.1.2. Access to restricted areas is limited to holders of a restricted area badge authorizing
   entry. Unless one has the appropriate area identified on his/her restricted area badge these
   areas will be avoided unless accompanied by an escort.
   9.1.3. Crossing restricted areas lines may only be accomplished after coordinating and
   obtaining approval from SFS (breaking red).
9.2. Night Vision Devices (NVD)/Blackout Operations.
   9.2.1. Grand Forks AFB does not conduct NVD/Blackout Operations.
9.3. Visual and Radio Blind Spots.
   9.3.1. Visual Blind Spots. The three main areas on the airfield that Tower is unable to
   visually observe (see Attachment 9) are:
      9.3.1.1. South of BRAVO Ramp hangars.
      9.3.1.2. South-facing sides of Nose Docks.
      9.3.1.3. North of 3-Bay Hangar.
   9.3.2. Radio Blind Spots. There are no radio/communication blind spots on the airfield.
9.4. Wear of Hats.
   9.4.1. In accordance with GRANDFORKSAFBI 21-1012 and AMC Supplement 1 to AFI
   21-101 Aerospace Equipment Maintenance Management, uniform hats and organizational
   baseball caps are not authorized for wear on the flight line. However, cold weather gear is
   authorized per AFI 36-2903, Dress and Appearance of Air Force Personnel.
      9.4.1.1. To minimize the risk of a potential FOD hazard, common sense will prevail
      when wind conditions exist that increases the possibility of hats being blown off an
      individual‘s head.
      9.4.1.2. Cold weather hats will be removed and secured within 50 feet of operating
      aircraft engines.
      9.4.1.3. Distinguished visitors and their escorts will not be required to remove metal
      insignia prior to entering the ramp, but will comply with the rules when they are within
      50 feet of operating engines.
 52                                      GRANDFORKSAFBI13-213 30 NOVEMBER 2012


9.5. Procedures for vehicles equipped with supplemental traction devices.
   9.5.1. Tire chains are prohibited on the airfield, with the exception of mission essential
   aircraft tow vehicles. The use of tire chains will be determined by Civil Engineering
   Technical Data.
9.6. Cell Phone Use on the Airfield.
   9.6.1. Vehicle operators on a DoD installation and operators of government owned vehicles
   will not use cell phones unless the vehicle is safely parked or using a hands free device while
   on the airfield. Phone use should only be done when the vehicle is safely parked and for
   official/business use only.
   9.6.2. The wearing of other portable headphones, earphones, or other listening devices
   (expect for hands free cellular devices) while operating a motor vehicle is prohibited. Use of
   these devices impairs driving and prevents recognition of aircraft operations, emergency
   signals, alarms or radio calls.
9.7. Smoking Areas.
   9.7.1. Smoking is prohibited on the airfield.
9.8. Emergency Response Procedures.
   9.8.1. All emergency response vehicles must have approval from the ATCT or authorized
   vehicle escort, prior to entering the CMA.
   9.8.2. Follow-on/support response agencies are required to standby in a designated area (e.g.
   ramp, taxiway, etc.) until called forward by the Fire Chief or incident commander. ATCT
   approval is a must prior to entering the CMA. NOTE: When responding to emergencies on
   the active runway Fire Department will be the initial responder.
