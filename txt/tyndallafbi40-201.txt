SUMMARY OF CHANGES

Responsibilities were expanded to include specific requirements for contract use of radioactive
materials. Definitions for radiation safety officer, ionizing and non-ionizing radiation were
added. TAFBI was shortened to prevent significant overlap between this instruction and
complementary Air Force Instructions. This TAFBI also combines information/requirements
from rescinded TAFBI 40-201 and TAFBI 40-202. Complete description of the ALARA
philosophy and management commitment was added. This TAFBI removed the old requirement
for General Licensed Device’s (GLD) to be registered with the Radioisotope Committee (RIC).

1. INTRODUCTION. The control of ionizing and non-ionizing radiological health hazards by
the Bioenvironmental Engineering Flight (325 AMDS/SGPB) is directed toward safeguarding
the health of persons working or living in the vicinity of Tyndall AFB. The effectiveness of the
program depends on the personnel responsible for organizing and implementing the program.
Specifically needed are the consistent and conscientious efforts practiced by the individual who
uses, and the supervisor who guides the use of, materials or machines producing ionizing and
nonionizing radiation.
     1.1. As Low As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA) philosophy. (The formal definition of
     ALARA is provided in paragraph 3.1.) The ALARA concept was developed in response to
     scientific evidence suggesting that no level of radiation exposure is entirely risk-free. It is a
     policy which states that although there are acceptable, conservative levels of radiation
     exposure specified by federal regulations which offer a low risk of adverse health effects
     compared to the other hazards of life and occupation, it is prudent to make every effort to
     reduce exposures to the lowest levels reasonably achievable, thereby lowering the health risk
     associated with that exposure. In fact, individual and cumulative radiation exposures must be
     maintained as close to zero as possible given the type of activities involved, the state of
TYNDALLAFBI40-201 1 MARCH 2011                                                                 3


   technology, the risk to the individuals exposed and the benefit to society from the activity
   being accomplished. The guidance contained in this instruction provides the basis for
   conducting an effective ALARA program.
   1.2. The base Radiation Safety Officer (RSO) manages the radiation safety program at
   Tyndall AFB (TAFB). TAFB is committed to the concept of ALARA. The ALARA
   commitment is summarized below:
      1.2.1. Management of TAFB is committed to the ALARA program for maintaining
      individual and collective radiation doses ALARA.
      1.2.2. Management will authorize modifications to operating and maintenance
      procedures and to equipment and facilities if they will reduce exposures unless the cost is
      considered unjustified.

  material in each waste container. Waste containers will be marked with labels bearing the
  radiation symbol and the words “RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL,” and tagged to indicate the
  nature of the contents. Each directorate or staff office will maintain serialized control (with
  number sequence controlled at a central point) of each waste container and a log stating the
  location and number of each container. The supervisor will report any lost or misplaced
  containers/material immediately to the Installation RSO. Under no circumstances will one
  using-organization accept radioactive waste from another without written concurrence from
  the Installation RSO.
     5.7.1. Using organizations will:
         5.7.1.1. Dispose of radioactive waste in accordance with guidance provided by the
         Installation RSO.
         5.7.1.2. Attach warning labels bearing the radiation symbol and the words,
         “RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL,” to the container. The labels will be affixed so that
         at least one is visible from any direction of approach.
         5.7.1.3. Monitor containers for radiation intensity and take swipe samples to
         determine if there is any removable contamination.
         5.7.1.4. Forward waste information as requested by the Installation RSO.
     5.7.2. Excess Permitted or Licensed Radioactive Material (RAM). Excess RAM
     permitted or licensed will be shipped to Bldg. 269 for storage pending disposal upon

  applicable.
TYNDALLAFBI40-201 1 MARCH 2011                                                               11


     5.9.1. In the absence of certification indicating a test had been made within six months
     prior to the transfer, the sealed source will not be put in use until tested.
     5.9.2. The test will be capable of detecting the presence of 0.005 microcuries or more of
     radioactive material on the test sample.
     5.9.3. Each sealed source the permittee uses (containing by-product material or any other
     radioactive material with a half-life greater than 30 days and in any form other than gas)
     will be tested for leakage and contamination at intervals of six months, unless otherwise
     specified in the permit. Exception: each sealed source designed for the purpose of
     emitting alpha particles will be tested at intervals of three months.
     5.9.4. If the above tests reveal the presence of 0.005 microcuries or more of removable
     contamination, the permittee will immediately notify the RSO and withdraw the sealed
     source from use.
     5.9.5. Sources are to be leak tested before and after long-term storage.
  5.10. PERSONNEL DOSIMETRY PROGRAM
     5.10.1. Requests for dosimetry service will be completed before personnel are assigned
     duties involving ionizing radiation. The area supervisor will have the individual report to
     325 AMDS/SGPB, Building 1465. When personnel are relieved from duties involving
     ionizing radiation, the supervisor will submit a written notice to 325 AMDS/SGPB so
     indicating.
     5.10.2. All workers entering radiation areas will wear TLDs, as directed by the RSO.
     The designated POC for work areas where TLDs are used will take the dosimeters to
     Bldg. 1465 for periodic exchange. The 325 AMDS/SGPB TLD monitor will notify the
     POC of the appropriate exchange interval and procedures for TLD return.
     5.10.3. TLDs will be worn on the part of the body most likely to receive the greatest
     exposure to radiation. If one badge is issued it will be worn outside of any protective
     equipment such as a lead apron. When two badges are issued, the badge designated as
     the collar badge will be worn outside any protective equipment on or near the collar. The
     body badge will be worn under the protective equipment.
     5.10.4. Never place the badge inside the pocket or behind cloth, cigarettes, coins, or any
     personal obstruction whatsoever.
     5.10.5. Tampering with TLDs is prohibited. If these devices are accidentally damaged or
     exposed, the wearer must immediately return them to 325 AMDS/SGPB for exchange
     and subsequent evaluation. The wearer will explain the nature of the accident to aid in
     evaluation of the TLD.
     5.10.6. Personnel working with industrial x-ray equipment or adjacent to high radiation
     areas will wear two self-reading pocket dosimeters or one digital alarm dosimeter (DAD)
     as prescribed by the Installation RSO. This will permit frequent reading of the
     dosimeters during hazardous procedures. Pocket dosimeters should be worn clipped on
     the breast pocket of the outer garment. Never place dosimeters behind dense materials in
     the pocket.
 12                                                TYNDALLAFBI40-201 1 MARCH 2011


      5.10.7. When visitors enter a radiation area, they are required to register with the
      supervisor before entry. The supervisor will issue pocket dosimeters to the visitor and
      maintain an AFTO Form 115, Pocket Dosimeter Results Log, with the visitor's name,
      address, date, time in and out, pocket dosimeter or DAD number, and the initial and final
      readings on the pocket dosimeter/DAD. The Installation RSO will designate those areas
      and circumstances in which visitors will wear TLDs in addition to the pocket
      dosimeter/DAD.
      5.10.8. Allowable limits for occupationally exposed individuals, as well as those for the
      general public, and action/investigational levels are documented in the following table:

   of the risks to the unborn.
      5.11.1. A woman must voluntarily declare her pregnancy in writing and provide the
      estimated date of conception, for the radiation exposure limits of the embryo/fetus to be
      applied.
TYNDALLAFBI40-201 1 MARCH 2011                                                               13


     5.11.2. The Installation RSO may recommend to the referring physician that specific
     duties of a declared pregnant female be limited if the individual may receive a whole
     body exposure greater than 500 mrem during the gestational period.
     5.11.3. If the Installation RSO determines it is unlikely that the declared pregnant female
     would receive a total exposure during the term of the pregnancy (including the period
     preceding the confirmation of the pregnancy) in excess of 500 mrem, she may continue in
     her radiation-related duties. However, if the individual is not on the Air Force personnel
     dosimetry program, she will be enrolled for the duration of her pregnancy.
     5.11.4. Special consideration will be given when a declared pregnant worker's radiation
     duties involve the operation of high output sources or the use of unsealed radioactive
     materials. Pregnant workers will not continue in duties involving these sources without
     the concurrence of HQ AFMOA. When a pregnancy is suspected and reported to the
     immediate supervisor, women working with such sources or materials will receive a
     prompt evaluation by the Installation RSO (within five workdays after receipt of the
     consult request) and, if warranted, actions such as restrictions or removal may be taken
     even prior to confirmation of the pregnancy.
  5.12. TRAINING. Personnel will be provided radiation safety training commensurate with
  their duties.
     5.12.1. Training will be provided to individuals who in the course of their duties are

8. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES.
  8.1. Emergencies include any unusual occurrences that result in contamination of facilities
  or environment, or that may result in the exposure of personnel to hazardous levels of
  radiation. The RSO must be notified immediately of all emergencies involving radiation.
  8.2. The Installation RSO will conduct an investigation to determine and evaluate the extent
  of exposures from all sources of radiation. All reporting and investigations will be IAW the
  applicable sections of AFI 91-202, The US Air Force Mishap Prevention Program; AFI 91-
  204, Safety Investigations and Reports; and AFI 40-201, Managing Radioactive Materials in
  the US Air Force. Reporting under AFI 91-204 does not negate the reporting requirements of
  AFI 40-201 and the NRC.
  8.3. Treat any radioactive material spill as a major spill until monitoring can be
  accomplished to determine the actual intensity of the radiation exposure.
  8.4. Basic fire-fighting procedures are as follows:
     8.4.1. The fighting of fires, which may occur in buildings, must be accomplished in such
     a manner that exposure of personnel to radiation is held to a minimum and the spread of
     radioactive contamination is avoided. The supervisor will forward to the Fire
TYNDALLAFBI40-201 1 MARCH 2011                                                                   17


      Department (325 CES/CEF) a set of floor plans showing the locations of radiation areas
      and isotope storage areas.
      8.4.2. As a general rule, when using fire hoses, water fog is preferable to solid stream
      application to avoid excessive runoff of water that may spread contamination.
      8.4.3. Should a fire ignite, sound the evacuation alarm, call 911, and notify 325
      AMDS/SGPB of its location. If no immediate radiation hazard exists and the potential
      for sustaining injuries is remote, combat the fire using the nearest fire extinguisher, sand,
      or water. If there is sufficient time, personnel who are using isotopes and are not in the
      fire area should quickly place their isotopes into storage containers, transport containers
      from the area, then close the windows and doors, and shut off the ventilation system
      before leaving the area.
      8.4.4. Firefighters must wear protective clothing and respiratory equipment even though
      there is no evidence of immediate radiation danger. If possible, fire fighting should be
      conducted from the upwind side of the blaze.
   8.5. INGESTION OR INHALATION OF RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL. Any cases
   involving the suspected inhalation or ingestion of RAM must be reported immediately to the
   Installation RSO for guidance.
9. CONSULTANT SERVICES.                 325 AMDS/SGPB is available to all base and tenant
organizations for consultant services regarding radiation related issues.
10. RECORDS.

      10.1.1. The owner, user, and 325 AMDS/SGPB will maintain records on all Air Force
      permits and on all materials licenses, as required by Title 10, Code of Federal
      Regulations and AFI 33-364, Records Disposition - Procedures and Responsibilities.
      10.1.2. The records will have the specific radionuclide, date of original activity, serial
      number, physical nature (solid, liquid, or plated), amount of original activity; and, if a
      liquid, the volume and concentration.
   10.2. Personnel exposure records will be kept on AF Form 1527, History of Occupational
   Exposure to Ionizing Radiation.
   10.3. 325 AMDS/SGPB will maintain records of routine surveys.
   10.4. Area supervisors are responsible for keeping waste disposal records on the contents of
   radioactive wastes accumulating within their areas. These records will include the isotope
   identity, estimated activity, radiation level at surface of container, and the instrument used to
   determine surface radiation level.
