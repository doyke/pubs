1. General

    1.1. In-flight or ground emergencies involving aircraft require prompt, coordinated actions
    from many agencies to prevent unnecessary loss of life, damage to equipment, or
    interference with other flying operations. This instruction is not intended to replace detailed
    guidance given by technical orders, other instructions, or regulations, but rather to serve as a
    coordination tool to ensure all agencies are aware of their responsibilities during aircraft
    emergency situations.

    1.2. Only required vehicles and personnel will respond to aircraft emergencies (with Ultra
    High Frequency (UHF) and Very High Frequency (VHF) radios if available). Responding
    vehicle operators must be certified to drive on the USAFA airfield and possess a valid
    USAFA airfield driverâ€™s license. Vehicles will position themselves behind responding crash
    vehicles and not impede movement or vision. In addition, only authorized agencies may
    operate on the crash net. Personnel not required to respond will clear the area so as not to
    interfere with emergency operations. If necessary, the Senior Fire Official (SFO) or
    Incident Commander (IC) will direct the Security Forces to clear the area of non-essential
    personnel.

    1.3. During initial response to an aircraft emergency, the SFO is the IC and will determine
    if the aircraft is safe prior to releasing the aircraft for maintenance, recovery, or safety
    investigation (if required). Until the aircraft has been released by the IC, no one will
    approach the aircraft without direction from the IC. All vehicles, except Fire Department
    vehicles, will remain clear of the aircraft. This does not prohibit essential vehicles (such as
    tow vehicles) from positioning themselves nearby for immediate use. The IC must release
    the aircraft or direct specific actions before any vehicles, other than a Fire Department
    vehicle, approach the aircraft. This restriction does not prevent emergency actions prior to
    Fire Department arrival.

    1.4. All response vehicles (except Fire Department and crash recovery vehicles) and non-
    essential vehicles will remain clear of emergency aircraft until Fire Department and crash
    recovery actions are complete.

    1.5. Rapid Removal of Aircraft on a Runway or Taxiway. During normal flying periods,
    disabled aircraft will be removed as quickly and safely as possible after touchdown.
    Damaged aircraft will be removed as soon as possible depending on structure condition,
    equipment requirements, etc. Damaged aircraft will be removed from the runway in a
    minimum time period consistent with the following:

        1.5.1. Personnel safety.

        1.5.2. Prevention of unnecessary secondary damage.

        1.5.3. Prevention of destruction of evidence for accident investigation.
USAFAI21-101 10 FEBRUARY 2009                                                                   3

    1.6. The 10 ABW Crash Recovery program is a combined effort of the contract aircraft
    maintenance provider, 306 FTG, 10 ABW, and USAFA. Each organization provides
    manpower and expertise within its respective specialties that recover, and if necessary,
    reclaim mishap aircraft.

        1.6.1. Contract aircraft maintenance provider and the 306 FTG is limited to general
        crash recovery procedures for 306 FTG assigned aircraft. Crash recovery equipment
        will be provided by the government. If a crane or other specialized equipment is
        needed, local rental/lease will be contracted by 10 MSG/LGC Contracting Division if it
        cannot be provided by the 10 ABW. The 10 MSG/LGC Contracting Division will have
        established lease agreements on hand with local supplier for a crane.

    1.7. For mishaps, the Emergency Operations Center (EOC) director at USAFA will contact
    the appropriate agencies required to respond to an aircraft mishap. 10 ABW Command Post
    is the primary point of contact on USAFA (719-333-2633/2634) with 24-hour coverage.
    The IC will coordinate response from required base elements. If the IC determines recovery
    is beyond the scope of 10 ABW capabilities, due to lack of specific Mission Design Series
    (MDS) equipment or airframe expertise, he or she will notify the Command Post for
    coordination with owning Major Command/Unit for assistance.

2. Declaration of Emergencies

    2.1. The aircrew is primarily responsible for declaring ground or in-flight emergencies.
    Emergencies may also be declared by air traffic control personnel or officials responsible for
    the operation of the aircraft, e.g. Supervisor of Flying (SOF).

    2.2. Individuals who become aware of aircraft emergency situations will use any means
    available to relay the necessary information to any agency capable of initiating emergency
    procedures (Tower, SOF, Fire Department, Command Post, Airfield Management, etc.).

    2.3. Persons declaring emergencies (ground or in-flight) should provide the following
    information, if time and conditions permit:

        2.3.1. Aircraft identification and type.

        2.3.2. Nature of emergency.

        2.3.3. Pilot's desires/intentions.

        2.3.4. Aircraft altitude, position, and estimated time of arrival, or location on airfield
        for ground emergencies.

        2.3.5. Number of people on board.

        2.3.6. Fuel remaining (in-flight emergencies only).
4                                                       USAFAI21-101 10 FEBRUARY 2009



        2.3.7. Number and type of ordnance on board.

Note: Pass information available, including ordnance on board. Do not delay declaring the
emergency.

    2.4. Ultimately, emergency information must be passed to the Control Tower to activate the
    Primary Crash Alarm System (PCAS). If unable to contact Control Tower, notify Airfield
    Management (AM), who will activate the Secondary Crash Net. Airfield Management will,
    in turn, notify the Control Tower by landline.

     provide their own CDDAR training plan approved by the aircraft maintenance provider
     training section and the 306 FTG/QAE. Training will incorporate any environmental,
     safety, and health hazards present in aircraft recovery operations that could affect
     government personnel or property. CDDAR training will be documented in training
     records.

     7.2. Contract aircraft maintenance provider personnel designated as CDDAR Team Chief or
     member, will be qualified on basic equipment operation and have training records
     documented reflecting training received. The special certification roster will be used to
