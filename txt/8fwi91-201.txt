1. Program Description
   1.1. The 8 FW Weapons Safety Office (SEW) will coordinate all weapons safety
   requirements for Kunsan AB. All tenant units must align their weapons safety programs with
   8 FW/SEW.
   1.2. General Explosive Safety Standards.      Air Force explosive safety standards are in
   AFMAN 91-201.
2                                                             8FWI91-201 25 OCTOBER 2013


    1.3. Explosives Safety Program. A comprehensive program developed to actively manage
    all aspects of safety involving all materials under the definition of explosives. The wing and
    tenant units must equally share implementation of an effective explosives safety program and
    all levels of management, supervision, and operations must support the program.
    1.4. Developing Explosive Operating Instructions. If technical orders or safety briefings
    cover all information listed in AFMAN 91-201, para. 7.2 and 7.3, locally developed
    instructions are not required. However, Additional Duty Weapons Safety Representatives
    (ADWSR) must ensure locally written instructions are approved and signed by the
    commander.
       1.4.1. These instructions will be maintained at the operating location.
       1.4.2. Coordinate all locally developed instructions through 8 FW/SEW prior to use and
       annually thereafter.
       1.4.3. Provide 8 FW/SEW an electronic copy of all unit locally developed instructions.
    1.5. Explosive Facility License. Units requiring storage of ammunition and explosives to
    support a specific explosives operation or mission must obtain approval from 8 FW/SEW.
       1.5.1. 8 FW/SEW will assist the ADWSR with preparation of the AF Form 2047,
       Explosive Facility License, IAW AFMAN 91-201, para. 11.7. The ADWSR will
       complete the coordination process.
       1.5.2. The license will require unit commander approval and coordination through
       Security Forces Squadron (Resource Protection), Base Civil Engineering Squadron (Fire
       Department), and Munitions Accountable Systems Officer (MASO) prior to 8 FW/SEW
       approval. The MASO must ensure that all units requesting munitions have a properly
       licensed or sited location to store munitions prior to approving issues.
       1.5.3. Licensed locations where unpackaged electrically initiated explosives (i.e. impulse
       cartridges) are handled will be equipped with a static bus bar or equivalent to dissipate
       static electricity. Provide appropriate grounding and bonding in accordance with AFI 32-
       1065, Grounding Systems, Table 1, line 12b.
    1.6. Explosive Safety Training. Host and tenant unit requirements listed in AFI 91-202, The
    US Air Force Mishap Prevention Program, para. 9.11.2 will be managed by the appointed
    ADWSR or through a formal course. Additionally, commanders will be responsible for the
    following:
       1.6.1. Ensure unit personnel whose duties involve handling, storage, functioning,
       transporting, or using explosives are trained and qualified in the tasks performed.
       Training will be conducted and documented initially upon assignment and annually
       thereafter.
       1.6.2. Ensure units are developing and using lesson plans and guides to conduct required
       training. See AFI 91-202 and AFI 91-202/PACAFSUP1, Ch 10.
       1.6.3. Provide 8 FW/SEW an electronic copy of all unit explosive lesson plans and tests.
    1.7. Local Purchase of Munitions. Local purchase of commercial explosives or munitions
    items is prohibited unless approved through the Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) program.
    Contact the Munitions Flight (8 MXS/MXMW) for guidance.
