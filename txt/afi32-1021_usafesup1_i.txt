                                                 Chapter 1

                               PRINCIPLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

1.1. Facility Project Planning and Programming Objective. The objective of facility project planning
and programming is to provide facilities needed to perform the Air Force mission. All commanders shall
support this objective by ensuring project requests meet validated requirements; are in compliance with
all applicable standards; are programmed at the lowest life cycle cost; achieve optimum resource effi-
ciency and minimize damage to the natural and human environments; and are within authorities and avail-
able resources.

1.2. Principles. Planning and programming facilities follows these principles.
    1.2.1. Facility Project Planning. Facility project planning identifies facilities needed to satisfy cur-
    rent and future mission requirements and determines the most economical means of providing those
    facilities. This determination shall always begin with an evaluation of existing facilities for their suit-
    ability to satisfy mission requirements.
    1.2.2. Military Construction (MILCON) Programming. MILCON programming is the process of
    acquiring both the authority and resources necessary to provide facility requirements identified by the
    planning process. A construction project with an estimated cost greater than $750,000 is normally
    funded through the MILCON Program.

1.3. Responsibilities.
    1.3.1. Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Air Force (Installations), SAF/IEI. Provides Air Force
    policy development and oversight; and advocates for the MILCON program through the Office of the
    Secretary of Defense (OSD), Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and Congress.
    1.3.2. The Civil Engineer, HQ USAF/ILE. Formulates policy governing the Air Force MILCON
    program, directs development of Air Force capital investment strategies, and advocates for resources
    through the Air Force Corporate Structure, OSD, OMB, and Congress.
    1.3.3. The Engineering Division, HQ USAF/ILEC. Formulates policy and procedures governing
    the Air Force MILCON program, develops Air Force capital investment strategies, and validates and
    integrates Total Force (Active Air Force, Air National Guard, Air Force Reserve) facility project
    requirements into a corporate Air Force MILCON program. Advocates for MILCON resources
    through the Air Force Corporate Structure, OSD, OMB, and Congress. Coordinates construction pro-
    grams requiring interagency approvals, such as defense access roads, medical facilities, defense fuels,
    and energy conservation.
    1.3.4. US Air Force Reserve Installations and Logistics Directorate, HQ USAF/REL. I s s u e s
    guidance to Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) for submitting its MILCON program, reviews and
    validates the submittal, assists Air Staff in determining size and content of their MILCON program,
    and advocates for AFRC MILCON program through OSD and Congress.
    1.3.5. Air National Guard, ANG/CE. Provides instructions to ANG installation commanders for
    planning and preparing construction programs, reviews and validates cost estimates, validates and pri-
    oritizes facility requirements, reviews and validates cost estimates, and program documents. Prepares

  issued by HQ USAF, and all applicable Air Force Instructions. Provide instructions and guidance to
  installation commanders for planning and submitting MILCON programs, to include review and vali-
  dation of cost estimates, and validation and prioritization of all facility requirements. Coordinate with
  the MAJCOM/SC to verify all communication requirements are documented and cost estimates are
  accurate.
  1.3.7. Installation Commanders. Identify, plan, and program facilities to support their assigned mis-
  sions. Determine whether existing facilities are available to meet the requirement (see AFI 32-9001,
  Acquisition of Real Property); ensure existing facilities are used economically and efficiently and that
  excess space is evaluated for demolition. Prioritize and submit MILCON programs to their MAJ-
  COMs.
  1.3.8. Host, Tenant, and Supported Unit Responsibilities. The host installation will provide ser-
  vices to tenant and supported units in accordance with AFI 25-201, Support Agreement Requirements
  and AFI 65-601, Vol 1, Budget Guidance and Procedures. These services include, but are not limited
  to, preparing program documents, obtaining required certifications, and providing Base Civil Engi-
  neer services.
     1.3.8.1. Projects for On-Base Tenants and Supported Units. Host installations will provide
     facilities and/or space needed by on-base tenants or supported units from existing assets, if avail-
     able. If adequate existing facilities are not available, or if the tenant otherwise requires construc-
     tion or renovation of facilities for its sole use, the host installation will prepare program-related
     project documentation on behalf of the tenant or supported unit's mission. The host installation
     will then forward documentation concurrently to the host MAJCOM’s and tenant or supported
     MAJCOM’s Civil Engineers. Any MILCON requirements and siting programmed or planned by
     other organizations must be coordinated by the host base MAJCOM/CV. This level of authority
     will not be delegated below the host MAJCOM/CV. Additionally, for mission beddown MILCON,
     the host base MAJCOM must participate in the beddown planning and the host MAJCOM/CV
     will coordinate on the beddown plan. The tenant or supported unit’s command will validate the
     project, establish its priority, and submit the project as part of its MILCON submittal to HQ
     USAF/ILEC. ANG should reference AFI 32-1012, Reserve Component Facilities Programs.
     1.3.8.2. Air Force Reserve Command Units. Host Installations will follow AFI 25-201, Sup-
     port Agreements Requirements, on host-tenant relationships when reserve component units are
     tenants on Air Force installations.
     1.3.8.3. Joint Use of Installations with Other Agencies. Host installations will follow AFI
     25-201, Support Agreements Requirements, in cases where units of other government agencies,
     departments, or military services use facilities or portions of an Air Force installation. Each MIL-
     CON project must be reviewed for joint use potential and certified in the certificate of compliance
     and stated on the DD Form 1391. (See Chapter 2.)
     1.3.8.4. Installations in Foreign Countries. In foreign countries, installations will follow guide-
     lines outlined in status of forces or country-to-country agreements.

                       MILITARY CONSTRUCTION PROJECT PLANNING

2.1. Planning. Effective planning establishes facility requirements critical for mission accomplishment
and proposes the most effective and economical means of satisfying those requirements.

2.2. Planning Actions.
    2.2.1. Determine Requirements. Installations identify facility needs and determine which needs
    cannot be met with existing facilities. Installation commanders review, validate, and prioritize instal-
    lation MILCON facility requirements. Requirements shall be based on Air Force Handbook 32-1084,
    Facility Requirements, which provides typical requirements for a given facility type. Reference to
    other Air Force or DoD publications or a detailed study of unique user requirements may also be nec-
    essary to determine complete needs.
    2.2.2. Evaluate Alternative Solutions. Installations evaluate existing assets and determine the most
    economical and effective means of satisfying facility needs. New construction may require justifica-
    tion based on an economic analysis performed in accordance with AFI 65-501, Economic Analysis.
    2.2.3. Initiate Programming Actions. When it is determined a facility shall be constructed or
    upgraded, the Base Civil Engineer (BCE) will prepare and submit DD Forms 1391, and all other
    applicable documentation, and enter the project into the Automated Civil Engineering System –
    Project Management module (ACES-PM). Documentation (typically obtained from facility users)
    shall include a fully justified, indisputable case for accomplishing the project.

2.3. Certificate of Compliance. Installations shall accomplish several planning actions for every MIL-
CON project. A Certificate of Compliance (as shown in Figure 2.1.) signed by the installation com-
mander, documents completion of these actions. MAJCOMs review these certificates to ensure
installations have fulfilled all compliance requirements, and retain them for future reference and use.
Although this certificate is only completed once, MAJCOMs shall ensure required actions take place
when and as needed. The following paragraphs, listed in the same order on the certificate, briefly describe
the actions being certified. If more detailed information is required to ensure compliance, referenced doc-
uments should be reviewed.
2.3. (USAFE) Certificate of Compliance. Guidelines for Critical Planning Actions in USAFE. Installa-
tions shall prepare and submit to The USAFE Civil Engineer (HQ USAFE/A7C), USAFE IMT 320, Cer-
tificate of Compliance for Critical Planning Actions, signed by the installation commander that
certifies these planning actions have been accomplished. The USAFE IMT 320 must be submitted prior to
HQ USAFE/A7C submitting projects to HQ USAF for inclusion in USAFE’s MILCON program. NOTE:
USAFE will not submit projects to HQ USAF for funding without a completed USAFE IMT 320 signed
by the installation commander. Installations shall not award any MILCON construction contract until the
certificate of compliance and all necessary siting approvals have been obtained. HQ USAFE/A7C shall
review these certificates to ensure installations have fulfilled all compliance requirements and retain them
for future reference and use. Although each certificate is only completed once, HQ USAFE/A7C ensures
required actions take place. The following paragraphs, listed in the order of the certificate of compliance
items (USAFE IMT 320), direct personnel to the USAFE applicable documents.

  2.3.1. Environmental Impact Analysis Process. (Figure 2.1., Item 1). Installations shall complete
  the environmental impact analysis process (EIAP), or have it underway, for each MILCON project
  submitted to HQ USAF. See AFI 32-7061, The Environmental Impact Analysis Process.
  2.3.1. (USAFE) Environmental Impact Analysis Process. USAFE IMT 320, Item 7--AFI 32-7061,
  Environmental Impact Analysis Process, and the USAFE Supplement 1 thereto, and USAFEI
  32-7066, Environmental Baseline Surveys in Real Estate Transactions contain procedures for inform-
  ing decision makers of environmental considerations when authorizing major DoD actions at installa-
  tions. Maintain and dispose of form according to Air Force Records Disposition Schedule, Table 32-6,
  Rule 6.00.
  2.3.2. Wetlands. (Figure 2.1., Item 2). Before MILCON projects are submitted to the MAJCOM,
  they shall comply with Executive Order 11990, Protection of Wetlands and Guidelines of the US
  Water Resources Council. See also AFI 32-7064, Integrated Natural Resources Management. Projects
  with potential impact to wetlands may require special permits and authorizations. Installation program
  managers shall consult with the US Army Corps of Engineers, Regulatory District Office for their
  region prior to initiating any actions affecting wetlands. Additionally, before undertaking any projects
  in or adjacent to wetlands, installations shall prepare a “Finding of No Practicable Alternative
  (FONPA),” based on qualified expert opinion. The FONPA shall be submitted and signed by the MAJ-

                          MILITARY CONSTRUCTION PROGRAMMING

3.1. MILCON Programming. Programming is the process of developing and obtaining approval and
funding for Military Construction (MILCON) projects. Installations identify, develop, and validate MIL-
CON projects, and MAJCOMs compile, validate, and submit command MILCON programs according to
this AFI and instructions provided in HQ USAF MILCON program call letters. HQ USAF/ILEC inte-
grates MAJCOM inputs in the development of the Air Force-wide MILCON Program and advocates for
MILCON resources through the Air Force Corporate Structure, OSD, OMB, and Congress while the Air
Force Panels advocate for specific MILCON requirements. ANG/CE and AF/REL establish submittal
dates and issues annual guidance to ANG and AFRC installations for the separate submittal of their MIL-
CON programs to OSD.

3.2. Definition of MILCON. Military Construction, as defined in 10 U.S.C. 2801, includes any con-
struction, development, conversion, or extension of any kind carried out with respect to a military instal-
lation. MILCON includes construction projects for all types of buildings, roads, airfield pavements, and
utility systems costing $750,000 or more. The Air Force MILCON program objective is to provide quality
facilities to support Air Force missions. A MILCON project includes all construction work necessary to
produce a complete and usable facility or complete and usable improvement to an existing facility. Addi-
tionally, instances may occur when maintenance and repair work will be accomplished as MILCON,
either because it is part of a large project or a decision has been made to use MILCON instead of O&M
funds.
   3.2.1. Project Authority. Authority to carry out a MILCON project includes authority for surveys
   and site preparation; acquisition, conversion, rehabilitation, or installation of facilities; acquisition
   and installation of equipment and appurtenances integral to the project; acquisition and installation of
   supporting facilities (including utilities) and appurtenances incident to the project; and planning,
   supervision, administration, and overhead incident to the project.
   3.2.2. Project Limitations. Each MILCON project shall result in a complete and usable facility or a
   complete and usable improvement to a facility. Avoid combining work on multiple facilities of differ-
   ent types into a single project. Combining multiple projects into a single, “lump sum” request is pro-
   hibited, except when each project is in the same general facility category (i.e. supply facilities,
   maintenance and production facilities, etc.) and the required completion date of each facility necessi-
   tates programming all of them in the same fiscal year.

3.3. MILCON Project Development. Project development is one of the most important actions in MIL-
CON programming and is documented using a DD Form 1391. The DD Form 1391, by itself, shall
explain and justify the project to all levels of the Air Force, OSD, OMB, and Congress. Justification data
shall clearly describe the impact on mission, people, productivity, life-cycle cost, etc., if the project is not
accomplished.
   3.3.1. Automated Civil Engineer System – Project Management Module (ACES-PM).
   ACES-PM is the single official Air Force-wide database management system used to create, store,
   retrieve, and update MILCON project records. It is used to develop the Air Force MILCON program
   from MAJCOM submittals, support the MILCON submittal to Congress, answer Congressional
   inquiries, provide an audit trail and historical record of project activity, and as an information source
26                                                          AFI32-1021_USAFESUP1_I 24 JUNE 2005


     for Air Force managers. Program managers will use the data in ACES-PM to update and monitor
     project progress, cost, and schedule. This unique and essential relational database requires all
     ACES-PM users ensure project data for which they are responsible is accurate and current. ACES-PM
     does not currently apply to the ANG and AFRC.
     3.3.2. Project Identification. With the exception of HQ USAF-directed projects, installation com-
     manders determine which facility needs cannot be met with existing facilities. Installation command-
     ers review, validate, and prioritize installation MILCON facility requirements. In accordance with
     schedules established by the MAJCOM, the BCE prepares and submits the DD Forms 1391 with all
     supporting documents and enters the project into the ACES-PM system. For ANG projects, the BCE
     submits DD Forms 1391s/1390s to ANG/CEP. AFRC submits forms to AF/REL.
     3.3.3. Project Validation. HQ USAF, MAJCOMs, and installations shall validate each MILCON
     project by verifying the requirement that creates the need for the proposed project and confirming the
     proposed project is the most cost effective means of satisfying the requirement. Projects justified on
     an economic basis, and all projects costing over $2 million, require an economic analysis in accor-
     dance with AFI 65-501, Economic Analysis. The MAJCOM/CEP or equivalent confirms DD Form
     1391 data is accurate and complete by signing the form in block 9.
     3.3.4. Project Cost Estimates. Accurate project cost estimates are essential to successful MILCON
     project development and execution. Cost estimates must be closely scrutinized to ensure they are
     in-line with the OSD Pricing Guide or fully justified with historical cost data. Installations and MAJ-
     COMs should prepare cost estimates using parametric estimating tools (defined as being equivalent to
     15% design completion) or based on 35% conventional design. The basis for parametric project cost
     estimates shall be a completed Requirements Document, as defined by the USAF Project Manager’s
     Guide for Design and Construction. Use the Tri-Service Parametric Cost Engineering System
     (PACES) as a tool to develop parametric cost estimates; however, PACES cost estimates for primary
     facilities shall be consistent with unit prices published in OSD Pricing guide or AFCESA Historical
     Construction Cost Handbook. Major differences between PACES and the OSD Pricing Guide (e.g.,
     clay tile roof versus standing seam metal roof) shall be fully justified to HQ USAF/ILEC. Capture
     unique requirements of a project as separate line items under Primary or Supporting Facility cost. The
     cost of force protection within the facility should be identified under Primary Facility as “Antiterror-
     ism Force Protection” and outside the facility identified under Supporting Facilities as “Passive Force
     Protection Measures”.
     3.3.5. Design Schedules. MAJCOMs shall document design and construction schedules in Block 12
     of the DD Form 1391 for each MILCON project. The schedule shall show design will be complete in
     time to award the construction in the fiscal year that funding is requested. Projects not achieving this
     status at the time of the Budget Estimate Submission (BES) by HQ USAF/ILEC risk being deleted
     from the program.
     3.3.6. Demolition. Demolition funded as part of a MILCON project shall be directly related to the
     project (e.g., in the footprint of the new construction or no longer needed as a result of the new con-
     struction). Once the project is appropriated and authorized by Congress, the scope of demolition work
     (total square meters/footage) identified shall be accomplished to complete the project.
     3.3.7. MAJCOM MILCON Program Submittals. MAJCOMs shall prioritize validated projects
     and submit their Commander-approved program in accordance with MILCON program call letters
     issued by HQ USAF/ILEC. AFRC and ANG shall submit projects to their respective Joint Service
AFI32-1021_USAFESUP1_I 24 JUNE 2005                                                                     27


   Reserve Component Facility Board in accordance with instructions found in AFI 32-1012, Reserve
   Component Facilities Programs.

3.4. MILCON Program Development. HQ USAF/ILEC, in conjunction with other HQ USAF func-
tional offices, will review each MILCON project in detail and validate the need, engineering feasibility,
economic benefits, compliance with Air Force objectives, and project cost. In developing the MILCON
program, HQ USAF/ILEC integrates projects from the MAJCOMs and lists projects in priority order, in
accordance with “Fact-of-Life” requirements, Corporate Adjustments, and the MILCON Investment
Strategy Scoring Model (ISSM).
   3.4.1. “Fact-of-Life” Projects. Fact-of-Life projects are required to achieve compliance with laws,
   treaties, and international agreements. Projects are intended solely to fund initial construction, modi-
   fication, or upgrade of a facility, system, or component(s) to comply with new Federal and/or State
   environmental laws or regulations. Other infrastructure projects must compete for MILCON or O&M
   funding as applicable on their own merits. MAJCOMs should include environmental projects in a fis-
   cal year MILCON program early enough to prevent non-compliance. Project narrative and data shall
   identify project requirements and justify them as Level I, “Fact of Life” requirements, and include
   information on violations (see AFI 32-7001, Environmental Budgeting).
   3.4.2. Corporate Adjustments. Corporate Adjustments are projects approved and placed in the
   MILCON program by Chief of Staff of the Air Force (CSAF) or the Secretary of the Air Force
   (SECAF) due to their overriding importance to the Air Force. Examples include Quality of Life
   requirements from the Dormitory and Fitness Center Master Plans. These projects are so necessary
   that they are considered “must pay” bills and do not compete with other MAJCOM requirements.
   MAJCOM/CCs and HAF Directors with MILCON requirements that cannot be met through the nor-
   mal MAJCOM scoring and prioritization process may submit a written request to CSAF or SECAF
   for a Corporate Adjustment. Since Corporate Adjustments impact the TOA available for scored
   projects, the requesting MAJCOM must indicate where the corporate-adjusted project fits into the
   MAJCOM’s existing priorities of previously submitted projects.
   3.4.3. The MILCON Investment Strategy Scoring Model (ISSM). For all validated projects other
   than Fact-of-Life and Corporate Adjustment projects as identified in 3.4.1. and 3.4.2. above, HQ
   USAF/ILEC calculates project rankings (or priorities). Numerical scores are derived from the MAJ-
   COM commander’s project priority, the HQ USAF MILCON ISSM, Air Force Corporate Structure
   mission panel points, and MILCON IPT points. The MILCON ISSM considers each project for its
   mission category and mission impact. Mission panel points are assigned based on the merit of individ-
   ual projects and whether they shall be funded or should be funded in the programmed year. The MIL-
   CON IPT points address efficiencies, mission timing, demolition, and overseas presence.
   3.4.4. The Integrated Priority List (IPL). All MILCON projects are integrated into a single Total
   Force list, which includes active Air Force, ANG, and AFRC. After Fact-of-Life and Corporate
   Adjustment projects are determined, the remaining project rankings are derived from ISSM scores.
   Based on the MILCON budget authority available, projects on the IPL are included in the MILCON
   program in descending order beginning with the highest ranking IPL project.
   3.4.5. Changes to the Integrated Priority List. After the Air Force Civil Engineer approves the
   IPL, changes to project priority, scope, and cost must be approved by the Air Force Corporate Struc-
   ture. Project substitutions will not be accepted. Projects that cannot be executed at the programmed
28                                                         AFI32-1021_USAFESUP1_I 24 JUNE 2005


     amount (PA) will be deferred unless the increase in PA is offset at the expense of other MAJCOM
     projects.

3.5. MILCON and Program Objective Memorandum Schedules. The Air Force submits a biennial
MILCON budget (two fiscal years at one time) to OSD and Congress each even numbered fiscal year.
OSD reviews both years in detail and issues decisions on each. Congress, however, does not normally
review the second year program, and therefore, that program is resubmitted by the Air Force to OSD the
next year as an amended program. OSD reviews the amended program, and after approval, it is submitted
to Congress as part of the President's Budget (PB) for that respective year. Additionally, each even num-
bered year, a six-year MILCON program or Future Year Defense Program (FYDP) is developed for the
Program Objective Memorandum (POM), which outlines the forces and resources proposed for the next
six years. Scheduling of these submittals is subject to change and is provided annually by HQ USAF.
     3.5.1. Office of the Secretary of Defense Budget Review. The Air Force submits the MILCON
     budget to OSD by facility category (such as operations and training facilities, maintenance and pro-
     duction facilities, research and development facilities, etc.). OSD reviews every project submitted and
     issues Program Budget Decisions (PBDs) that transmit their proposed decision on every project
     (approve, disapprove, revise, or defer to a future year). OSD provides reasons for their decisions. If
     the Air Force is not satisfied with these decisions and a strong case can be made to rebut the proposed
     decision, a reclama is developed and submitted. OSD review and consideration of these reclamas,
     along with senior level negotiations, determine the final PBD decision and ultimately the content and
     size of the MILCON program to be included in the President's Budget. The total Air Force budget
     goes through a similar process. After approval by OMB and the President, the budget is submitted to
     Congress.
     3.5.2. Congressional Review. The Secretary of Defense submits the MILCON portion (for all ser-
     vices and DoD Agencies) of the President's Budget to Congress in listings aggregated by country and
     state. The Secretary of Defense requests both authorization and appropriation from Congress.
        3.5.2.1. Congressional Authorization. Authorization of MILCON projects is provided by the
        Defense Authorization Bill that includes authorization requests for other Defense accounts such as
        Procurement; Research, Development, Test and Evaluation; Operations and Maintenance; and
        Military Personnel. Normally, all projects that comprise the MILCON total obligation authority
        are included in the authorization request. However, items authorized in a prior year for which only
        appropriation is being requested are not included in the authorization request. They are included in
        the appropriation request only.
            3.5.2.1.1. Armed Services Committees: The House and Senate Armed Services Committees
            review the MILCON authorization request and hold hearings attended by witnesses from each
            service. These two committees then issue reports detailing their recommendations. The full
            House and Senate then act on the committees’ recommendations and each passes its own ver-
            sion of the authorization program (referred to as committee marks).
            3.5.2.1.2. Congressional Authorization Conference Actions : Differences between the
            House and Senate versions are resolved by an Armed Services Conference Committee which
            also issues a report that shows how the differences were resolved. Congress then passes the
            authorization program approved by the conference that becomes the authorization act. After
            the act is signed by the President, it becomes law (National Defense Authorization Act).
AFI32-1021_USAFESUP1_I 24 JUNE 2005                                                                       29


          3.5.2.1.3. Authorization Expirations : If no obligation is made for a project within three
          years after an authorization act becomes law, the authorization for that project will expire,
          unless an authorization extension is included in the authorization act passed at the end of the
          third year. MAJCOM staffs shall submit requests for extensions to HQ USAF/ILEC describing
          the circumstances that prevented obligation. HQ USAF/ILEC will validate the request and ask
          OSD, through SAF/IEI, to include requests for the extension in the authorization bill submit-
          ted to Congress.
          3.5.2.1.4. Other Matters Included in Authorization Request : The authorization request
          may include proposed changes to the existing United States Code that the Secretary of Defense
          submits for legislative consideration. MAJCOMs can propose legislative changes to HQ
          USAF/ILEC for consideration and staffing through SAF/IEI to OSD.
       3.5.2.2. Congressional Appropriation. The Secretary of Defense requests, for all services,
       appropriations for all items in the MILCON total obligation authority. The MILCON appropria-
       tion is a separate bill from all other DoD appropriations. The House and Senate Appropriations
       Committees follow the same procedure outlined for the Armed Services Committees in Paragraph
       3.5.2.1. in reviewing the appropriation request. After the bill is signed by the President, it becomes
       law (Military Construction Appropriations Act). MILCON appropriations expire five years after
       they are appropriated; however, from time to time, general reductions and rescissions reduce funds
       available in prior years. See AFI 32-1023, Design and Construction Standards and Execution of
       Facility Construction Projects, for additional information on MILCON appropriation expiration.
   3.5.3. Construction of Projects. After both the authorization and appropriation acts are signed, HQ
   USAF/ILEC will arrange funding for construction of projects on a project-by-project basis. See AFI
   32-1023, Design and Construction Standards and Execution of Facility Construction Projects (Chap-
   ter 5 and Chapter 6).

3.6. Project Files. Installations, MAJCOMs, and HQ USAF/ILEC should maintain MILCON project
files according to AFMAN 37-139, Records Disposition Schedule.

3.7. Special Military Construction Authorities.
   3.7.1. Defense Medical MILCON.
       3.7.1.1. Authority. This program is managed by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense
       for Health Affairs, OASD(HA), and is funded by the Defense Health Program, not the Air Force
       Total Obligation Authority (TOA). This section applies to all active Air Force medical and medi-
       cal related facilities; it does not apply to ANG medical facilities. The following directives apply:
       DoD Directive 6015.16, Department of Defense Policies for the Acquisition of Military Health
       Facilities; DoD Instruction 6015.17, Procedures for the Planning, Programming, Budgeting and
       Execution for Construction of Military Health Facilities; and MIL-HDBK-1191, Department of
       Defense Medical and Dental Treatment Facilities Design and Construction Criteria.
       3.7.1.2. Project Justification, Submittal, and Program Development. OASD(HA) issues an
       annual call to the services for medical MILCON projects. Installations, with assistance from the
       Regional Health Facility Office (RHFO), develop MILCON requirements. The RHFO, with assis-
       tance from the Medical Treatment Facility Commander (MTF) and the BCE, develop DD Forms
       1391. The BCE prepares supporting documents in accordance with Chapter 2 of this Instruction.
30                                                          AFI32-1021_USAFESUP1_I 24 JUNE 2005


        Installations forward completed DD Forms 1391 to the MAJCOM Civil Engineer and Surgeon
        General. They, in turn, jointly validate and prioritize all projects, and submit them to the Air Force
        Medical Support Agency (HQ USAF/SGSFW) with information copies to the Air Force Center
        for Environmental Excellence (HQ AFCEE/CMM) and HQ USAF/ILEC. HQ USAF/SG priori-
        tizes the MAJCOM projects, develops the DoD Medical MILCON Program, and forwards the
        projects to OASD(HA) as part of the unified medical POM submission.
        3.7.1.3. Medical Unspecified Minor Construction Requirements. Installations and MAJ-
        COMs shall process Medical Unspecified Minor Construction (UMC) requirements in the same
        manner as medical MILCON projects. OASD(HA) funds approved projects from the Defense
        Health Program. Projects programmed under the unspecified minor construction authority shall
        comply with DoD Instruction 6015.17. UMC programming further is described in Chapter 4 of
        this Instruction.
        3.7.1.4. Medical Relocatable Facilities. Medical relocatable facilities are provided in accor-
        dance with guidance in Chapter 6 of this Instruction.
     3.7.2. Defense Access Road (DAR) Program.
        3.7.2.1. General. This program provides a means for DoD to contribute funding to improve pub-
        lic highways serving defense installations and activities. The program is authorized by 23 U.S.C.
        210, Defense Access Roads, and implemented by Army Regulation 55-80, Highways for National
        Defense. The DAR Program is managed by Military Traffic Management Command (MTMC),
        Department of the Army, and co-administered by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA),
        Department of Transportation. The FHWA is the link to State and local transportation agencies
        that normally execute the projects.
        3.7.2.2. DAR Project Justification and Submittal. The DoD expects State and local transporta-
        tion agencies to develop and maintain public highways that serve permanent defense installations.
        Before requesting funds through the DAR Program, an installation shall first request the jurisdic-
        tional authority to fund and accomplish the required improvements. However, some defense-gen-
        erated impact may be too sudden or unusual to be incorporated into normal civil highway
        improvement programs. Such impacts could include traffic increases due to major on-base facility
        expansions, addition of a new entrance gate, a requirement to move unique defense vehicles on
        low-volume roads, or realignment of public roads due to new facility development (e.g., runway
        extension). When it is understood that State and local authorities cannot or will not fund the nec-
        essary improvements, installations shall submit an Access Road Needs Report through their MAJ-
        COM to HQ USAF/ILEC for requirement validation.
        3.7.2.3. DAR Project Programming and Execution. Upon validation, HQ USAF/ILEC will
        coordinate the requirement with MTMC for eligibility determination and certification that the
        road is important to national defense. With HQ USAF/ILEC validation and MTMC certification,
        the MAJCOM shall include the project in the next command MILCON submittal, and clearly
        identify the requirement on the DD Form 1391 as a DAR project. Air Force funds are transferred
        to the FHWA via Standard Form 1151, Non-expenditure Transfer Authorization, to proceed with
        project design and construction.
     3.7.3. Energy Conservation Program. Public law 10 U.S.C. 2865 allows the installation to share in
     savings from energy reductions. One-half of the savings remain at the installation to be used for main-
     tenance and repair; minor alterations to existing military family housing units (with family housing
AFI32-1021_USAFESUP1_I 24 JUNE 2005                                                                  31


  energy savings); unspecified minor construction projects that enhance quality of life; or morale, wel-
  fare, or recreation (MWR) facilities/services that can be supported with appropriated funds. The other
  half of the savings is to be used for additional energy conservation measures. This portion is to be
  accumulated and managed by the MAJCOM.
     3.7.3.1. Normal MILCON. Energy projects may be MILCON-funded as outlined in paragraph
     3.4. of this Instruction.
     3.7.3.2. Energy Conservation Investment Program (ECIP). ECIP is a special MILCON pro-
     gram centrally managed by OSD for all services. The program is submitted to Congress by OSD
     as a lump sum amount without base or project identification. The services compete for portions of
     the lump sum amount by submitting candidate projects with detailed justifications to OSD. The
     program is intended to provide projects that reduce energy consumption and utility costs. OSD
     reviews the projects, determines which are to be funded, and transfers funds to the service for
     project accomplishment. HQ USAF and the Air Force Civil Engineering Support Agency (AFC-
     ESA) issue annual guidance letters to MAJCOMs for implementing this program.
  3.7.4. Liquid Fuels Facilities. Liquid fuels facilities handling Defense Energy Support Center
  (DESC) owned product are the responsibility of the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) for MILCON
  funding and advocacy. MAJCOMs submit MILCON fuels projects to DESC, documented in accor-
  dance with 30 AM 4270.1, DLA Facilities Projects Manual. Also, see ETL 01-15, Programming
  Fuels Projects, for additional guidance. Submit information copies to HQ USAF/ILEC/ILEV/ILSP.
  3.7.5. Productivity Investment Fund (PIF).
     3.7.5.1. Fund Description. Air Force TOA allocated for the PIF program may be used to fund
     MILCON projects that result in hard savings or cost avoidance in operations and maintenance
     (O&M) and manpower. Normally, only projects with a payback period of less than two years are
     approved and funded.
     3.7.5.2. Project Justification and Submittal. Air Force Productivity Investment Funds may be
     used to fund MILCON projects meeting the criteria established in AFI 38-301, Productivity
     Enhancing Capital Investment Programs. HQ USAF/XPMR issues special guidance on submittal
     of PIF projects. MAJCOMs submit MILCON projects to HQ USAF/XPMR in response to their
     call for PIF candidates, and shall provide an information copy to HQ USAF/ILEC clearly marked
     as PIF. HQ USAF/XPMR and ILEC review PIF candidates and determine whether PIF funding
     can be anticipated. Commands shall not include PIF projects in their command MILCON submit-
     tals. If warranted, HQ USAF/ILEC will authorize design. No design funds are provided in the PIF
     program, therefore, MAJCOMs shall fund design of PIF projects from funds made available for
     MILCON design. Upon HQ USAF approval, the PIF funds will be transferred and the project will
     become part of the MAJCOM’s MILCON program.
  3.7.6. Land Acquisition. Land acquisition is accomplished in one of two ways:
     3.7.6.1. Land Acquisition Only. Land acquisitions not associated with any facility construction
     and estimated to cost more than $500,000 are programmed as separate MILCON projects. Exam-
     ples include lands purchased for Air Installation Compatible Use Zones (AICUZ) or for explosive
     quantity/distance safety zones.
     3.7.6.2. Land Acquisition with Facility Construction. When land acquisition is required in
     conjunction with facility construction, the land acquisition is programmed one of two ways:

     3.7.6.2.1. If the estimated land cost is greater than 30 percent of the estimated total project
     cost (land plus facility construction), land acquisition is programmed as a single and separate
     MILCON project from the construction project.
     3.7.6.2.2. If the estimated land cost is 30 percent or less of the estimated total project cost, the
     project is programmed together with the construction and the words "land acquisition" are
     included in the project title on the DD Form 1391.

                                                Chapter 4

                  UNSPECIFIED MINOR CONSTRUCTION PROGRAMMING

4.1. Unspecified Minor Construction. Unspecified minor construction (UMC) projects are authorized
by 10 U.S.C. 2805, Unspecified Minor Construction, and DoD Directive 4270.36, DoD Emergency, Con-
tingency, and Other Unprogrammed Construction.

4.2. Minor Construction Project Criteria. UMC projects are MILCON projects having a funded cost
between $750,000 and $1,500,000. However, if the UMC project is intended solely to correct a life-threat-
ening, health-threatening, or safety-threatening deficiency, the funded cost is between $1,500,000 and
$3,000,000. These projects are funded from the P-341 account. AFI 32-1032, Planning and Programming
of Real Property Maintenance Projects, describes minor construction (funded from the O&M account)
projects costing less than $750,000 (or less than $1,500,000 where the project corrects a life-, safety-, or
health-threatening deficiency).
   4.2.1. Types of Projects. UMC includes constructing, erecting, or installing a new facility or system;
   work that expands the current size of an existing building by constructing additional functional space
   (e.g., by constructing a building addition or adding an additional level); converting a building from
   one primary function to another; and repair-type work that exceeds 70 percent of a building's replace-
   ment cost. Note: when the estimated cost to repair a building exceeds 70 percent of the replacement
   cost, a replacement building should normally be programmed through the MILCON process. How-
   ever, when other factors dictate retention and restoration of the existing building (e.g., in the case of a
   building on the National Register of Historic Places), such repair-type work is referred to as rehabili-
   tation and is programmed as construction class work. SAF/IEI may approve exceptions to this on a
   case-by-case basis. Repair work in the same facility may be programmed as a separate project and
   executed with the UMC project. The programming documents for both projects shall be cross-refer-
   enced and Congress shall be notified of intent to proceed with an UMC project and companion repair
   work.
   4.2.2. Project Limitations. Unspecified minor construction requirements should be unforeseen and
   so urgent it cannot wait for the next MILCON program submittal. Each project shall provide a com-
   plete and usable facility or improvement to an existing facility. Splitting requirements to keep project
   costs below the UMC threshold is prohibited. An UMC project shall not be accomplishment concur-
   rently with a MILCON project in the same facility. Combining UMC funds with other fund types to
   accomplish a single requirement is prohibited. An UMC project may precede a MILCON project for
   a new mission requirement when the UMC will provide a complete and usable facility to meet a spe-
   cific need during a specific time frame. An UMC project may follow a MILCON project when new
   mission requirements are identified after the MILCON project was completed.

4.3. Project Justification and Submittal. MAJCOMs submit project requests under the UMC authority
to HQ USAF/ILEC using a DD Form 1391. Project requests shall describe the requirement; explain the
project urgency; why it was not included in a prior year MILCON program; and why it cannot wait for the
next MILCON program. Each project request shall explain how the new requirement is to be satisfied in
the interim. Requests shall identify any land acquisition and temporary facilities; indicate the date when
the requirement was first known; and identify unit or activity relocations in submittal documents. Provide
the required completion date and justification for that completion date. Include a schedule of related
34                                                          AFI32-1021_USAFESUP1_I 24 JUNE 2005


equipment delivery and any steps taken to expedite design and construction. If requesting minor construc-
tion funding for a project previously denied by Congress, provide new information justifying the urgency
and what changed since the original request. Describe all actions taken to satisfy the requirement and
identify all other reasonable alternatives considered. Explain why the alternatives were not adopted. Iden-
tify any O&M funded work associated with the total project scope and provide copies of DD Form 1391
for any companion O&M project and cross-reference DD Forms 1391 to each other. The MAJCOM/CEP
shall sign the following statement, included on the DD Form 1391, for all projects submitted to HQ USAF
for authority approval: “I have reviewed the DD Form 1391 and assure the document is complete and
accurate, and have validated the primary and supporting costs. The scope has been fully coordinated with
the user and the Civil Engineer Squadron Commander.” In the submittal, include a Certificate of Compli-
ance (Figure 4.1.) signed by the host installation commander and endorsed by the MAJCOM commander,
or designated representative.

4.4. Project Approval. HQ USAF/ILEC validates UMC projects and submits validated projects to SAF/
IEI for approval. SAF/IEI (together with the OSD Comptroller) approves the projects and notifies the
House and Senate Armed Services and Appropriations Committees of the intent to accomplish the
project. If no committee raises an objection within 30 calendar days after notification, the notification pro-
cess is complete, and HQ USAF/ILEC advises the MAJCOM to proceed with the project. For the Air
Force Reserve component, AFRC/CE and ANG/CE have unspecified minor construction project approval
up to $1,500,000. Projects exceeding $1,500,000 require SAF/IEI approval and the same Congressional
notification.

                                                 Chapter 5

               EMERGENCY, DAMAGED OR DESTROYED, AND CONTINGENCY
                            CONSTRUCTION PROGRAMS

5.1. Purpose of Chapter. This chapter provides guidance for obtaining MILCON projects under certain
special emergency program authorities. This chapter implements United States Code and DoD Directive
4270.36, Emergency, Contingency, and Other Unprogrammed Construction.

5.2. Special Emergency Programs Available. Special programs include: Emergency Construction (10
U.S.C. 2803), Restoration or Replacement of Damaged or Destroyed Facilities (10 U.S.C. 2854), Secre-
tary of Defense (SECDEF) Contingency Construction (10 U.S.C. 2804), and Construction Authority in
Event of Declaration of War or National Emergency (10 U.S.C. 2808). MAJCOMs should submit projects
costing more than $1,500,000 for these programs. Use the procedures in Chapter 4 for requirements cost-
ing less than $1,500,000, but more than $750,000. If minor construction cannot be used, MAJCOMs will
explain the circumstances in their submittal.
     5.2.1. Emergency Construction (10 U.S.C. 2803). This provision is used for projects vital to
     national security or for the protection of health, safety, or the quality of the environment, so urgent
     they cannot be deferred to the next MILCON submittal.
        5.2.1.1. Project Justification and Submittal. MAJCOMs submit project justifications to HQ
        USAF/ILEC. The submittal shall include all DoD Directive 4270.36 requested information, a DD
        Form 1391, and a DD Form 1391c. The urgency of the project shall be explained, including the
        date the emergency arose and why it was not known in time for inclusion in the MILCON budget
        currently before Congress. The submittal shall also explain the impact on the installation mission
        if the urgent requirement is deferred until the next MILCON budget submission. Include design
        and contract award schedule data showing project award will be prior to availability of the next
        year's MILCON funds.
        5.2.1.2. Funding. Emergency construction projects are funded from unobligated balances made
        available from authorized and appropriated MILCON programs. MAJCOMs will identify and use
        the oldest savings and cancellations from their MILCON projects, first. If these funds are insuffi-
        cient to cover the cost of the emergency project, HQ USAF/ILEC will work to identify the balance
        of the requirement.
        5.2.1.3. Approvals Required. HQ USAF/ILEC validates the requirement and submits projects to
        SAF/IEI for approval and notification to the appropriate congressional authorization committees.
        Simultaneously, HQ USAF/ILEC, through SAF/FMB, requests OSD Comptroller seek approval
        from the Senate and House Appropriations Committees to reprogram the identified offsets to the
        emergency project. Correspondence is delivered to all committees simultaneously. A project may
        be carried out only if: (1) no objection is raised by the Armed Services Committees within 30 cal-
        endar days after they were notified, and (2) approval from the Appropriations Committees is
        obtained for reprogramming funds. Emergency projects shall be accomplished within approved
        funds. If variations in cost occur that could not have been anticipated at the time of approval, the
        cost flexibility provision under 10 U.S.C. 2853 applies.
     5.2.2. Restoration or Replacement of Damaged or Destroyed Facilities (10 U.S.C. 2854). T h i s
     authority is used for facilities damaged or destroyed by fire, flood, wind, crashes, explosions, torna-
AFI32-1021_USAFESUP1_I 24 JUNE 2005                                                                      37


  does, hurricanes, volcanoes, earthquakes, typhoons, etc. 10 U.S.C. 2854 provides authorization only
  (no appropriations). There is no annual dollar limit.
     5.2.2.1. Criteria for Projects. The destroyed or damaged facility shall have been in use or
     planned for use at the time of the damage or destruction. Restoration or replacement shall not pro-
     vide larger facilities than those damaged or destroyed, except that MAJCOMs may provide for
     limited increases as a result of economy of design or compliance with new criteria. MAJCOMs
     cannot use these projects to correct space deficiencies.
     5.2.2.2. Operations and Maintenance Funds for Clean Up. MAJCOMs may clean up the dam-
     age and minimally restore the facility with Operations and Maintenance funds, provided construc-
     tion class work does not exceed $750,000. MILCON funds, if subsequently approved for
     restoration or replacement of the facility, will not reimburse Operations and Maintenance
     accounts.
     5.2.2.3. Project Justification and Submittal. The submittal process for MAJCOMs is the same
     as for emergency projects (see paragraph 5.2.1.1.). In addition, the submittal shall explain the
     urgency and indicate, for each facility, the cause of damage or destruction. Include the building
     number, name, value before damage or destruction, size, and construction type. MAJCOMs shall
     certify the project is for restoration or replacement of facilities damaged or destroyed, and any
     scope increase is a result of economy of design or compliance with new criteria.
     5.2.2.4. Funding. Project funding is accomplished under the same procedures as for emergency
     construction projects (see paragraph 5.2.1.2.).
     5.2.2.5. Project Approval and Cost Limits. The approval process and limits on project cost are
     the same as for emergency projects (see paragraph 5.2.1.3.).
  5.2.3. Secretary of Defense Contingency Construction (10 U.S.C. 2804). Use of this authority is
  rare and requires a determination that the project is so urgent that use of other authorities is inconsis-
  tent with national security.
     5.2.3.1. Project Justification. The Air Force shall first consider using its Emergency Construc-
     tion Authority (10 U.S.C. 2803) and provide reasons to the Secretary of Defense why that author-
     ity cannot be used. Use of Contingency Construction Authority does not require identification of
     funding from project cancellations or savings since appropriations are provided to the Secretary of
     Defense for this authority.
     5.2.3.2. Project Submittal. MAJCOMs shall submit requests according to DoD Directive
     4270.36. Requests should include the same information as required in paragraph 5.2.1.1. In addi-
     tion, requests shall include Unified and Specified Commander's certification the project is vital to
     US Security. Factors making the project vital to the security of the United States shall be described
     in detail. Reasons the project cannot be programmed in accordance with established planning, pro-
     gramming, and budgeting system procedures, or accomplished using Air Force emergency con-
     struction authority shall be listed. Also, provide anticipated contract award and design completion
     dates.

     5.2.4. Construction Authority in the Event of Declaration of War or National Emergency (10
     U.S.C. 2808). The Secretary of Defense may authorize the services to undertake military construction
     projects not otherwise authorized by law. The Air Force may undertake these projects only within the
     amount of funds appropriated. The Secretary of Defense will provide guidance at the time this author-
     ity is needed.

                                                 Chapter 6

                         RELOCATABLE AND TEMPORARY FACILITIES

6.1. Relocatable and Temporary Use Facilities Background. This chapter pertains to relocatable and
temporary use facilities purchased or leased as equipment. For the purpose of this chapter the terms “tem-
porary” and “relocatable” are used interchangeably. The temporary facility-use (relocatable) authority
was a concession on the part of Congress to provide the DoD a way to satisfy (for very short periods with
unsubstantial buildings) requirements that were so urgent they could not wait for normal processes to
obtain construction. Over time, temporary structures were erected that were more like permanent facilities
than austere, relocatable structures. Austere refers to both the exterior and interior appearance and is
defined as the basic structure without ornamentation or luxury and without the appearance of permanence.
Current DoD and AF policy is to keep temporary facilities to an absolute minimum; as short-term as pos-
sible; and only in use until the permanent facility is built or the mission no longer requires their use. This
chapter provides guidance on satisfying interim facility requirements using relocatable or temporary facil-
ities. Interim facilities are requirements resulting from transitory or peak military missions, deployments,
contingency operations, disaster relief operations, or urgent requirements pending approval and construc-
tion of permanent facilities through the normal MILCON process.

6.2. Relocatable Facilities. DoD Instruction 4165.56, Relocatable Buildings, authorizes the purchase or
lease of relocatable buildings to meet interim facility requirements. It provides the authority to acquire,
store, and use relocatable facilities when they are the most feasible and economical means of satisfying
interim facility requirements.
   6.2.1. Definition. Relocatable facilities are designed to be erected, disassembled, stored, readily
   moved, and reused. They can be reused by another organization at the same site or at another site on
   another installation. Approval is required for each use and reuse. Trailers suitable for offices and stor-
   age space can serve as relocatable facilities.
   6.2.2. Approval Authority. SAF/IEI delegated authority to The Civil Engineer, HQ USAF/ILE, to
   approve the use of relocatable facilities longer than three years for interim, transitory, or peak situa-
   tions. Relocatable facilities may be approved for and granted extensions of use for longer than five
   years. HQ USAF/ILE further delegated this authority to the MAJCOM/CE (including ANG/CE). This
   authority may not be further delegated.
   6.2.3. Restrictions on Relocatable and Temporary Facilities. MAJCOMs shall keep temporary
   and relocatable facilities to a minimum. MAJCOMs shall ensure these facilities are neat in appear-
   ance, functional yet austere, and readily removable. There shall be no appearance of permanence, such
   as brick exteriors, brick building signs, automatic sprinkler systems, or extensive landscaping. Paint-
   ing is permitted.
   6.2.4. Facilities Not Classified as Relocatable. The following facility types are not classified as
   relocatable:
       6.2.4.1. Facilities required solely for military training associated with facility use and assembly.
       6.2.4.2. Buildings that are part of organizational unit mobility equipment, War Reserve Material
       (WRM), or an integral part of a mobile equipment item such as shop, communications, and instru-
       mentation vans or trailers.
40                                                          AFI32-1021_USAFESUP1_I 24 JUNE 2005


        6.2.4.3. Portable facilities that can be moved intact (such as shelters for workmen), skid-mounted
        bus shelters, contractor owned construction project offices, small storage sheds not connected to a
        utility system, and unconnected sanitary facilities or sentry shelters.
            6.2.4.3.1. Stress tension shelters or fabric covered structures having a rigid frame cannot be
            purchased as equipment by specific direction of Congress. Therefore, they cannot be pur-
            chased with O&M or 3080 funds for temporary or short-term requirements, under the relocat-
            able authority. However, stress tension shelters can be leased to meet interim facility
            requirements. If stress tension shelters are purchased as facilities, the shelters, foundations,
            utilities, and site preparation shall be completely funded as construction (MILCON, P341, or
            O&M funded minor construction).
     6.2.5. Program Management. To improve visibility of peak and short-term facility management, all
     MAJCOMs shall submit a comprehensive list of short-term facilities highlighting those approved for
     longer than five years or which have been on the installation less than five years, but were granted an
     extension to exceed five years. This list shall be submitted to HQ USAF/ILEC no later than 15
     November each year. HQ USAF/ILEC shall consolidate and submit this report to SAF/IEI by 15 Jan-
     uary each year. RCS: HAF-ILE(A)0211. This report has been designated emergency status code C-2.
     Continue normal reporting during emergency conditions. The program management procedures out-
     lined in this instruction apply to all relocatable facilities purchased or leased as equipment.
        6.2.5.1. Approval for Relocatable Facilities Interim to MILCON. The requiring MAJCOM
        shall identify the permanent MILCON or UMC project for which the relocatable facility is
        interim. The MILCON project shall be identified in the next available MILCON budget submittal
        to HQ USAF/ILEC.
        6.2.5.2. Approval of Relocatable Facilities for Peak or Transitory Purposes. I n s t a l l a t i o n s
        shall submit requests for use of relocatable buildings for peak or transitory purposes to MAJ-
        COMs. The MAJCOM validates the requirement, and if warranted, the MAJCOM/CE approves
        the purchase or lease. The Command shall identify the mission for which the temporary relocat-
        able facility is required.
     6.2.6. Acquisition of Relocatable Facilities. Installations shall submit a DD Form 1391 to the MAJ-
     COM for acquisition of a relocatable facility showing all costs (funded and unfunded) associated with
     the purchase or lease, with a separate entry for the construction support costs. An economic analysis
     (see paragraph 6.2.6.3.) and “20 percent rule” calculations (see paragraph 6.2.7.) shall be included in
     the submittal.
        6.2.6.1. Funded Costs (Non-recoverable costs). Funded costs may not exceed $750,000 for
        either purchased or leased relocatable facilities. These costs cannot be included in a lease; they
        shall be funded as a Minor Construction project. Funded (Non-recoverable) facility components
        include, but are not limited to; foundations, concrete mounting slabs, site preparation, utility con-
        nections, stairways, porches or breezeways between units, extra wall covering and paneling,
        ceramic works, lighting and sound systems, and other interior and exterior finishes and features
        not included in the original facility package or unit. Non-recoverable facility components also
        include estimates for the cost of disassembly, repackaging, and normal component repair and
        refurbishment.
        6.2.6.2. Unfunded Costs (Acquisition Costs). Unfunded costs include relocatable facility acqui-
        sition, leasing, delivery to the site, erection, assembly, disassembly, packaging, transporting,
AFI32-1021_USAFESUP1_I 24 JUNE 2005                                                                      41


     maintenance, operation, and refurbishment. Relocatable facilities are purchased as equipment
     using Other Procurement funds (3080) or with Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation
     (RDT&E) funds (3600) when appropriate. When relocatable facilities are leased, installations and
     MAJCOMs will lease them as equipment with Operations and Maintenance funds (3400) (3830
     and 3730 for ANG and AFRC, respectively) or RDT&E funds (3600).
     6.2.6.3. Economic Analysis Requirement. Installations shall prepare an economic analysis to
     support acquisition of relocatable facilities according to the guidelines in AFI 65-501, Economic
     Analysis. Prior to exercising annual options to continue leasing interim facilities, the economic
     analysis shall be updated and revalidated.
     6.2.6.4. Engineering Evaluation Requirement. An engineering evaluation shall be performed
     to ensure the relocatable facility meets safety requirements and normal construction standards
     established by the Air Force.
  6.2.7. The 20 Percent Rule. Prior to approving a request for a relocatable facility, MAJCOMs shall
  calculate the percentage of non-recoverable (funded) costs to facility acquisition (unfunded) costs.
  This percentage shall not exceed 20 percent. The 20 percent calculation equals "non-recoverable facil-
  ity component cost" divided by "facility acquisition cost" times "100". If the facility is not new
  (including facilities acquired from other governmental agencies), apply the "20% rule" to the current
  cost of a similar new facility instead of the original cost of the facility or its current cost to the Air
  Force. The 20% calculation shall also be performed for leased relocatable facilities (obtain appropri-
  ate data from the lessor). If the calculation results in a percentage greater than 20%, consider a differ-
  ent type of relocatable that complies with the 20% rule.
  6.2.8. Conversion to Real Property. Conversion of a purchased or leased relocatable building to Air
  Force real property requires SAF/IEI approval.
     6.2.8.1. Conversion of Purchased Relocatable Facilities Where Funded and Unfunded Costs
     Exceed $750,000. MAJCOMs shall submit a DD Form 1391 to HQ USAF/ILEC describing the
     project and showing all costs. ILEC will request SAF/IEI approval. SAF/IEI approves the project
     and notifies the House and Senate Armed Services and Appropriations Committees of the AF’s
     intent to convert the facility. If no committee raises an objection within 30 days after notification,
     the notification process is complete, and HQ USAF advises the MAJCOM to proceed with the
     project. HQ USAF/ILEC will resolve any objection, if raised, prior to proceeding. ANG installa-
     tions will submit documentation described above to ANG/CE for processing to SAF/IEI.
     6.2.8.2. Conversion of Purchased Relocatable Facilities Where Funded and Unfunded Cost
     is Less than $750,000. MAJCOM staffs shall submit detailed justifications, including data on
     funded and unfunded costs, to HQ USAF/ILEC for conversion approval. HQ USAF/ILEC will
     notify commands of approval or disapproval. ANG installations will submit documentation
     described above to ANG/CE for approval.
     6.2.8.3. Conversion of Leased Relocatable Facilities. This type of conversion involves com-
     plex fiscal and legal procedures and should rarely arise. MAJCOM staffs shall submit requests for
     such conversions to HQ USAF/ILEC for appropriate processing.
  6.2.9. Maintenance of Relocatable Facilities. Purchases or leases of relocatable facilities, as equip-
  ment and not real property, dictate O&M funds or RDT&E funds pay the cost of maintenance. When
  leased, the lease can stipulate that the lessor provides maintenance. The using organization is respon-
  sible for funding the maintenance cost of their relocatable facilities. The BCE is responsible for fund-
42                                                           AFI32-1021_USAFESUP1_I 24 JUNE 2005


     ing the maintenance cost of the real property associated with the relocatable (e.g., the foundations, site
     preparation, and utility connections). The BCE can perform maintenance on the remainder of the
     facility, on a reimbursable basis.
     6.2.10. Inventory, Reuse and Disposition of Relocatable Facilities. Purchased relocatable facili-
     ties are accounted for as equipment. MAJCOMs shall keep an accurate and current inventory of pur-
     chased, stored, and inactivated relocatable facilities. Installations shall determine if a suitable
     relocatable asset is available through the MAJCOM before purchasing any new relocatable building.

6.3. Temporary Facilities Incident to MILCON. These are short-term facilities required to accommo-
date activities displaced by an approved and funded MILCON project during the period of project execu-
tion. Facilities shall be of non-permanent construction and removed when the MILCON project is
completed and the permanent facility occupied. Relocatable facilities can be used to satisfy these tempo-
rary requirements. The cost of temporary facilities (building, foundations, site preparation, and utilities) is
a funded cost and shall be included as a supporting facility on the DD Form 1391 for the MILCON
project. If leased, the full cost of the lease shall be included on the DD Form 1391. The lease cost will
reflect the period when the facility being constructed will not be available. If the requirement for tempo-
rary facilities arises after award of the MILCON project, it must be handled as a construction modification
action. Temporary facility costs shall be included in the project life cycle cost analysis used to validate the
construction project.

Terms
Funded and Unfunded Costs—Definitions of funded and unfunded costs are as follows:
Funded Project Costs—Costs incurred during the construction phases are funded costs and are funded
from MILCON appropriations or O&M funded minor construction accounts. Funded costs include, but
are not limited to, the following:
Materials—All materials, supplies, and services applicable to the project.
Equipment—All items of installed capital equipment.
Transportation—Transportation costs applicable to materials, supplies, installed capital type equipment,
and government-owned equipment.
Labor—All civilian labor costs including labor costs of construction units composed of foreign nationals.
These funded civilian labor costs for a project are determined by the accounting system in Work
Information Management System (WIMS)/ACES that uses the appropriate shop rate in its calculation.
Installation staffs shall not use any method other than this WIMS/ACES accounting procedure to compute
civilian labor funded costs. Otherwise, incomplete project costs and subsequent non-compliance with
minor construction funding limits might occur.
Overhead—That portion of installation overhead or support costs that can be identified as representing
additional costs incurred as a result of the project.
Supervision, Inspection and Overhead—The costs charged by the Corps of Engineers, the Naval
Facilities Engineering Command, and the Air Force when serving as the design and/or construction agent.
Travel—All travel and per diem costs.
Equipment Operation—That portion of costs applicable to the operation and maintenance of
government-owned equipment. Such costs shall be computed on an hourly rate (shown in AFI
65-601V1).
Unfunded Costs—Some efforts in support of military construction are identified as unfunded costs.
Unfunded costs are those that (a) are part of the construction effort associated with a military construction
or O&M funded minor construction project, (b) are financed from appropriations other than MILCON or
O&M funded minor construction, and (c) are not reimbursed by appropriations available for MILCON.
Unfunded costs are capitalized as part of the real property investment and include the following:
   Military Labor—Military labor costs used for a project are unfunded. These unfunded military labor
   costs are determined by the accounting system in WIMS/ACES that uses the shop rate in its
48                                                        AFI32-1021_USAFESUP1_I 24 JUNE 2005


     calculation. Installation staffs shall not use any method other than the WIMS/ACES accounting
     procedure to compute these unfunded military labor costs. Otherwise, incomplete project costs and
     subsequent noncompliance with minor construction funding limits might occur.
     RED HORSE and Prime BEEF Units—The labor costs of Red Horse and Prime Beef units are
     unfunded. These are costs for all labor performed by these units on a project. These costs are
     computed directly from the labor performed and use of the shop rate is not applicable.
     Depreciation—Costs applicable to the depreciation of government-owned equipment in accordance
     with hourly rates determined in Chapter 26 of DoD Manual 7220.9-M, "Asset Use Charge."
     Materials—Materials, supplies, and items of installed capital equipment obtained specifically for a
     project on a non-reimbursable basis, either as excess distributions from another Military Department
     of Defense Agency or as excess distributions from other Government agencies. A military
     Department of Defense Agency is precluded from using materials, supplies, or items of installed
     capital type equipment on its own minor construction projects on a non-reimbursable basis.
     Fringe Benefits—Unfunded civilian fringe benefit rates as prescribed in Chapter 26 of AFI 65-601,
     Volume I, for DoD civilian personnel.
     Gifts—Gifts from private parties.
