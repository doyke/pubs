This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 40-7, Medical Support to Family
Member Relocation Clearance and Exceptional Family Member Program (EFMP). It describes
the responsibilities of AF personnel with regard to the Exceptional Family Member Program-
Medical (EFMP-M) process, in Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs), the Air Force Personnel
Center (AFPC), and in other agencies that are instrumental to the implementation and operation
of the Air Force EFMP process. EFMP-M encompasses the medical and educational review
functions that support accompanied military assignments, the EFMP and Department of
Defense’s Educational and Developmental Intervention Services (EDIS). This instruction
supports portions of Air Force Instruction (AFI) 36-2110, Assignments, AFI 36-3020, Family
Member Travel, and AFI 36-2102, Base-Level Relocation Procedures. This instruction applies
to all military and civilian personnel and their family members entitled to receive medical care in
MTFs as specified in AFI 41-210, TRICARE Operations and Patient Administration Functions.
It also applies to Department of Defense (DoD) civilian employees with regard to seeking
information about availability of services overseas for family members with special needs. This
instruction does not apply to dependent parents and parents-in-law, as they are not entitled to
TRICARE benefits in accordance with (IAW) AFI 41-210. The Air National Guard (ANG) and
Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) do not have separate systems to determine services
availability. Family members of Reserve Component members who are on Active Duty for more
than 30 days may be eligible for supportive services upon request. ANG and AFRC personnel
agencies are responsible for screening all Air Reserve Component (ARC) members with
 2                                                                             AFI40-701 19 NOVEMBER 2014

                                            Chapter 1

                                    PROGRAM OVERVIEW

1.1. Exceptional Family Member Program-Medical Component (EFMP-M). The mission
of the EFMP-M is to identify medical and educational service requirements of family members
in support of Regular AF (RegAF) sponsor reassignment and civilian employment overseas. The
EFMP-M proactively identifies those family members who have special needs in order to
coordinate accompanied travel orders and family relocations IAW DoD Instruction (DoDI)
1315.19, Authorizing Special Needs Family Members Travel Overseas at Government Expense.
DoDI 1315.19 implements federal laws protecting persons with disabilities. EFMP implements
DoD policy by providing assignment considerations for RegAF sponsors where special medical
and educational conditions of family members have been identified. Enrollment in EFMP is
mandatory for RegAF members where family member conditions are identified that meet
enrollment criteria, as specified in DoDI 1315.19. Assignment coordination activities for those
family members with medical needs that do not meet the DoD definition of special needs are also
described in this instruction. EFMP families may be entitled to further community support
services, beyond medical/educational capability determinations, which are described separately
in AF policy. Additionally, the AF EFMP-M provides for coordination of medical care to
families enrolled in EFMP.
     1.1.1. AFPC operates the EFMP IAW AFI 36-2110, Attachment 25, and with personnel
     regulations pertaining to accompanied permanent change of station (PCS) travel. EFMP-M
     functions include the collection of health and educational information needed by medical and
     educational authorities to recommend assignment considerations in support of EFMP
     reassignments. EFMP-M supports routine PCS actions for EFMP sponsors and for others
     with needs for specialized medical support or special education services.
     1.1.2. DoDI 1315.19, Enclosure 4 defines “special medical needs” and “special educational
     needs” as the needs of family members who meet DoD criteria for identifying a family
     member with special needs. Enrollment into EFMP is mandatory for family members who
     meet the criteria. The AF uses these definitions for all accompanied assignment actions, in
     the Continental United States (CONUS) and outside the Continental United States
     (OCONUS). Family members who are identified with conditions that meet DoD criteria as
     special needs are registered in AF-sanctioned databases in order to expedite the consideration
     of service needs during relocation.
     1.1.3. Identification of special needs in family members of DoD civilians may not be
     considered in the hiring process. OCONUS, per DoDI 1315.19, Enclosure 6, DoD civilians
     may voluntarily disclose the existence of family members with special needs to the hiring
     agent prior to initiating family member travel OCONUS at government expense. As outlined
     in DoDI 1315.19, Enclosure 6, the hiring authority shall query the selectee to determine
     whether any member(s) of the selectee’s family has one or more special need(s), when a
     pending appointment for an overseas position has been made. To allow the civilian
     employee to make an informed choice of accepting the position, the hiring authority shall
     provide the employee comprehensive information on the availability of medical, dental and
     educational services at the gaining location to include a point of contact for the employee to
     query about specific special needs or access concerns. The hiring authority will inform
AFI40-701 19 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                     5


  employees of Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) requirements under DoDI
  1342.12, Provision of Early Intervention and Special Education Services to Eligible DoD
  Dependents, and DoDEA Regulation 1342.13, Eligibility Requirements for Education of
  Elementary and Secondary School-age Dependents in Overseas Areas. Additionally they
  will be informed that if they bring a family member that requires medical or dental care to an
  overseas location, the employee will be responsible for obtaining and paying for such care, to
  include any necessary transportation. Access for civilian employees and their families to
  military medical and dental treatment facilities is on a space-available and reimbursable basis
  only. (T-0).
     1.1.3.1. The selectee is encouraged to voluntarily participate in the Family Member
     Relocation Clearance (FMRC) process to better determine the availability of medical,
     educational, and early intervention resources and services for his/her specific needs and
     allow the civilian employee to make an informed choice of accepting the position.
  1.1.4. The EFMP-M implements Air Force responsibilities under Title 10, United States
  Code, for medical entitlements of military family members, the Individuals with Disabilities
  Education Act (IDEA) to support access to special education services, the Joint Federal
  Travel Regulation for family member travel allowances and household goods shipment, and
  DoDI 1315.19. The goals of the EFMP-M FMRC process are to prevent RegAF assignment
  failures due to unavailable resources for family members, to support DoD civilians through
  the provision of information about services availability OCONUS, and to enhance access to
  medical and educational resources for all family members through the relocation process.
  These actions support mission readiness. Successful relocation reduces stress for sponsors,
  family members, and units. Coordinated relocation prevents the unnecessary loss of
  allocated fiscal resources and supports equitable use of finite medical resources.
     1.1.4.1. All RegAF sponsors requesting family member travel at government expense to
     an accompanied OCONUS assignment, or are requesting family member travel at
     government expense to a CONUS location with family members identified as having
     special needs, may initiate the FMRC process at the EFMP-M office within the
     appropriate timeline, specified by type of assignment as outlined in Chapter 3 of this
     publication. DoD civilians accepting overseas employment who report special needs in
     family members and who request information about capabilities in the gaining location
     are supported using the same methods as those provided to families of RegAF members.
     (T-0).
         1.1.4.1.1. All RegAF sponsors requesting family member travel at government
         expense to a CONUS or OCONUS location, with family members identified as
         having special needs must have a Facility Determination Inquiry (FDI) sent to the
         gaining servicing AF EFMP-M office for review and family member travel
         recommendation. See Chapter 3 of this publication for additional guidance on FMRC
         processing.
     1.1.4.2. In no way will the EFMP-M FMRC process affect offers of employment to DoD
     civilians. DoD civilians IAW DoDI 1315.19, Enclosure 6, may voluntarily disclose the
     details of special needs of family members to the hiring agent prior to initiating family
     member travel OCONUS at government expense. Civilians request completion of DD
     Forms 2792, Family Member Medical Summary, and DD Forms 2792-1, Family Member
 6                                                         AFI40-701 19 NOVEMBER 2014


       Educational Summary, from their qualified service providers. These disclosures are used
       to advise civilian sponsors about availability of needed services. Decision-making about
       travel resides with the civilian sponsor. (T-0).
1.2. Additional Administrative Elements. To ensure effectiveness a Wing Supplement to AFI
40-701 is published for implementation of all EFMP-M processes. The installation commander
ensures all involved agencies develop, coordinate, and publish an installation directive, which
may integrate several topics outlining interagency support to families. (T-1).
AFI40-701 19 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                   7

                       OPERATING PROCEDURES AND STANDARDS

3.1. Identification.
   3.1.1. In the course of routine medical care: All medical staff will refer family members to
   the EFMP-M office when conditions are identified that meet EFMP eligibility criteria as
   specified in DoDI 1315.19, Enclosure 4. Enrollment of the family member in EFMP is
   mandatory once eligibility is established, and does not require consent of family members or
   sponsors. Medical providers work collaboratively with the SNC to explain the EFMP to
   families and to elicit their cooperation.
   3.1.2. Upon sponsor in-processing: The EFMP-M staff members within the MTFs (SNC and
   FMRCCs) collaborate with Medical In/Out-Processing POCs to establish procedures to
   ensure prompt identification of families with special needs during base in-processing.
   Existing base or medical in-processing forums (such as “Right Start”) may be used.
       3.1.2.1. If necessary, the FMRCC contacts the losing base to obtain an existing SN file.
       3.1.2.2. The FMRCC ensures updated contact information is entered into Q-base.
   3.1.3. Upon notification of assignment action: The orders issuing agent (installation MPS
   outbound assignments offices, CSS, or AFPC through central orders processing functions)
   will query sponsors and data systems to determine if special needs exist in family members
   as soon as an assignments is identified (“RIP” generation), regardless of gaining location. (T-
   1).
3.2. Enrollment. When special needs that meet DoD criteria are identified the following forms
and documents are used as appropriate to initiate enrollment of RegAF sponsors in EFMP.
   3.2.1. AF Form 2523, Family Member Program-Medical (EFMP-M) Information Form.
   3.2.2. DD Form 2005, Privacy Act Statement – Health Care Records.
   3.2.3. DD Form 2792, Family Member Medical Summary, with copies of supporting medical
   documentation specifying the conditions(s).
       3.2.3.1. The DD Form 2792 is only required for enrollment when the identified condition
       meeting enrollment criteria is medical in nature.
   3.2.4. DD Form 2792-1, Special Education/Early Intervention Summary, with copies of
   supporting educational documentation specifying the condition(s).
       3.2.4.1. The DD Form 2792-1 is only required for enrollment when the identified
       condition meeting enrollment criteria is educational in nature.
   3.2.5. Special Needs Coordinator’s memorandum to the MPS where sponsor’s personnel
   functions are managed (referred to as the servicing MPS), requesting initiation of an ALC
   “Q”, also known as Q-code.
       3.2.5.1. All EFMP enrollment or disenrollment actions addressed to AFPC or the
       servicing MPS must be signed by the appointed SNC at the base where the sponsor’s
       personnel functions are managed.

  3.2.6. All forms listed above are adopted for use in the EFMP-M and are described in their
  proscribing publications and are maintained in the SN file.
  3.2.7. The SNC:
     3.2.7.1. Conducts assessments of family members of RegAF sponsors to determine if
     special medical and/or education conditions exist that require enrollment. These
     assessments include interviews with family members and review of medical records or
     other medical documentation. (T-1).
         3.2.7.1.1. Where special medical needs are identified that meet DoD criteria for
         EFMP enrollment (see para 1.1.2.), the SNC will ensure the completion of the DD
         Form 2792 for each eligible family member. (T-1).
            3.2.7.1.1.1. Copies of the DD Form 2792 pertaining to minor dependents may be

            followed. Ages of majority for consent to release protected health information
            may vary according to the types of treatment sought. The SNC consults with the
            SJA as needed to determine when written consent of the minor must be obtained
            prior to release of the DD Form 2792 to the sponsor, parent, or legal guardian. (T-

            DoD healthcare network, including to the sponsor.
         3.2.7.1.2. Where special educational needs and/or developmental delays are
         identified in a child age birth to high school graduate (or General Equivalency
         Diploma), the SNC ensures the completion of the DD Form 2792-1 by qualified early
         intervention or school personnel. Any child that requires special education services
         beyond secondary education are also required to submit a DD Form 2792-1. (T-0).
     3.2.7.2. Ensures a case entry is established in Q-base indicating the sponsor’s current

           reason for the decision is entered in the medical record of the identified family
           member. (T-1).
3.3. Disenrollment. Removal from EFMP is accomplished through retirement of the RegAF
member, majority age of the identified child in which they no longer qualify as a dependent,
divorce of the identified spouse, death of the family member with special needs, or change in
circumstance in which the identified special need no longer exists.
   3.3.1. To initiate disenrollment from EFMP, the RegAF sponsor or adult family member
   submits documentation of the change in status or condition to the SNC at the base of
   sponsor’s personnel management function, who validates the change and that there are no
   other family members who have special needs.
       3.3.1.1. This documentation may be in the form of court documents, DD Form 2792, DD
       Form 2792-1, updated medical summary from the treating specialist/provider or other
       official/validated forms.

government sponsored family member travel with the exception of training courses over 90 days
that are performed en route and required by gaining assignment, as well as Embassy/Attaché
assignments.      These reviews must be initiated in accordance with the training
requirements/reporting. This is to ensure the most recent medical and educational information is
available to the review authorities. Follow up Embassy/Attaché FDIs are permitted up to 8-
months in advance of sponsor’s RNLTD to the OCONUS location. The sponsor must notify the
SNC at the base of current assignment of any changes in family member conditions or in needed
services that are identified after the initiation of the clearance process and before initiation of
family travel.
   3.4.1. Family members of RegAF sponsors requesting family member travel at government
   expense to an OCONUS location, and CONUS location when there are family members with
   special needs, must participate in the FMRC. Required documentation and attendance at the
   FMRC will vary depending on location of the gaining assignment and family composition.
   3.4.2. When family members are geographically separated from their sponsors
   (unaccompanied tours or other reasons for family separation), the EFMP-M office at the
   sponsor’s servicing base is responsible for coordinating all EFMP-M functions.
       3.4.2.1. When it is necessary to accomplish EFMP-M functions involving the family
       members the sponsor’s servicing EFMP-M office may request assistance from the
       EFMP-M office nearest to the family (referred to as the supporting base). (T-2).

     3.4.2.2. If the family members are geographically separated from the MTF conducting
     the FMRC, they may be seen by a civilian provider or a provider at a sister Service MTF.
     The provider or the MTF with the most recent information available about family care
     needs provides the needed information to support the review. In these cases the SNC and
     the MRO may communicate with the provider interviewing family members to ensure
     understanding of the purpose of such screening, the limitations of service availability in
     many locations, and the documentation needed to support the gaining installation in
     making travel recommendations.

3.7. Types of FMRC and FDI:
   3.7.1. Base to Base. Base to Base FMRCs and FDIs are appropriate when the member has a
   typical assignment from one base to another.
      3.7.1.1. For typical OCONUS assignments: The FMRC process is initiated for all RegAF
      sponsors requesting government funded travel of family members to OCONUS
      locations, regardless of prior EFMP status. All family members requesting government
      sponsored travel in conjunction with an accompanied PCS action to an OCONUS
      location must be present for the FMRC interview. Family members who travel overseas
      without command sponsorship are at risk of reduced or non-available medical care, loss
      of benefits such as base privileges or housing, and may incur significant personal expense
      if further relocation is needed. All sponsors who intentionally bypass the clearance
      process or who falsify information risk disciplinary action.
         3.7.1.1.1. The FMRC package for a typical OCONUS assignment, consists of one
         AF Form 1466 per family (permissible, but not required for DoD civilian families),
         the AF Form 1466D for every family member 2 years of age and older, the DD Form

        will include the original Q-code letter (if Q-coded), the AF Form 1466, and the DD
        Form 2792, DD Form 2792-1, and/or AF Form 1466D as appropriate for only those
        family members requiring review and travel recommendation by the gaining location.
        3.7.1.1.3. Once a complete FDI package is received, the gaining installation EFMP-
        M office has 14 calendar days to review all specified needs and provide a travel
        recommendation based on service availability to the losing installation EFMP-M
        office.
           3.7.1.1.3.1. When an FDI requires additional review by the OCONUS MAJCOM
           following an initial denial from the gaining OCONUS installation MTF, the
           MAJCOM review does not count against the 14 day timeframe.
        3.7.1.1.4. When the gaining installation SGH determines travel is recommended for
        all family members during an FDI, the gaining FMRCC ensures the Caring for People
        forum task 12.24, letter template is completed and included in the response to the
        losing EFMP-M office via Q-base. (T-1). The losing FMRCC ensures the sponsor or
        adult family member receives the document. (T-1).
        3.7.1.1.5. When the gaining installation SGH determines travel is not recommended
        for all family members, the gaining FMRCC ensures the AFMOA-developed Medical
        Information Sheet is included in the response to the losing EFMP-M office via Q-
        base. (T-1).
     3.7.1.2. For typical CONUS assignments: The FMRC process is required for RegAF
     sponsors who have an ALC “Q”, also known as Q-coded.
        3.7.1.2.1. The only family members required to attend the FMRC for a typical
        CONUS assignment are those identified as having a special medical and/or
        educational need. At the discretion of the SGH, the FMRC may additionally be
        completed where medical conditions are known to the MTF that are determined to be
        a risk for family member travel to the identified location, but that do not meet DoD
        criteria for enrollment. This includes temporary conditions (such as high risk
        pregnancy), or conditions that are mild in the current location but are expected to
        exacerbate in the environment of the proposed location.
        3.7.1.2.2. The FMRC package for typical CONUS assignments consists of one AF
        Form 1466 per family, the DD Form 2792 (only if the special need is medical in
        nature) and/or the DD Form 2792-1 (only if the special need is educational in nature).
        All forms must be in the most current published version. All forms must be signed by
        a qualified medical authority and/or educational authority when DD Form 2792-1 is
        required), and the AF Form 1466 must be signed by the appointed SGH at the
        sponsor’s servicing AF MTF.
        3.7.1.2.3. When an FDI is required at the conclusion of the FMRC, the FDI package
