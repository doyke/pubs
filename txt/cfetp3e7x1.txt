                                           PREFACE

This Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) is a comprehensive education and
training document that identifies life-cycle education/training requirements and training support
resources for the Fire Emergency Services specialty. The CFETP will provide our people with a
clear career path to success and instill rigor in all aspects of our career field training.

The CFETP consists of two parts used by the supervisor to plan, manage, and control training
within the career field.
Part I provides information necessary for overall management of the specialty.
   •   Section A provides general information about how the CFETP will be used.
   •   Section B identifies career field progression information, duties and responsibilities,
       training strategies, and the career field path.
   •   Section C associates each skill-level with specialty qualifications (knowledge, education,
       and training).
   •   Section D indicates resource contraints.
   •   Section E identifies transition training guide requirements for SSgt through MSgt.
Part II includes the following:
   •   Section A identifies the Specialty Training Standard (STS) to include duties, tasks, and
       technical references to support Air Education and Training Command (AETC) conducted
       training, wartime course, and correspondence course requirements.
   •   Section B contains the course objective list and training standards supervisors will use to
       determine if an Airman has satisfied training requirements.
   •   Section C identifies available support materials.
   •   Section D identifies a training course index supervisors can use to determine resources
       available to support training. Included here are both mandatory and optional courses, and
       exportable courseware.
   •   Section E identifies MAJCOM-unique training requirements supervisors can use to
       determine additional training required for the associated qualification needs.
   •   Section F identifies home station training references and courses material required for
       this specialty in support of contingency/wartime training.

Using guidance provided in the CFETP will ensure individuals in this specialty receive effective
and efficient training at the appropriate point in their careers. This plan will enable us to train
today’s work force for tomorrow’s jobs. At the unit level, supervisors and trainers will use Part
II to identify, plan, and conduct training commensurate with the overall goals of this guide.

identified training.

A2.2. MFMs will ensure their training programs complement the CFETP mandatory initial,
upgrade, qualification, and proficiency training requirements and identify requirements that can
be satisfied by OJT, resident training, contract training, or exportable courses. MAJCOM-
developed training to support this AFS must be identified for inclusion into the plan.

A2.3. Unit Education and Training managers and supervisors must ensure each individual
completes the mandatory training requirements (including MAJCOM supplemental
requirements) for the upgrade training specified in this plan.

A2.4. Each individual will complete mandatory training requirements specified in this plan. The
list of courses in Part II of this CFETP will be used as a reference to support training.

A3. Coordination and Approval. The AFCFM is the approval authority for the CFETP.
MAJCOM representatives and AETC personnel will identify and coordinate on the career field
training requirements. The AETC training manager for this specialty will initiate an annual
review of this document by AETC and MFMs to ensure currency and accuracy. Using the list of
courses in Part II, they will eliminate duplicate training.

B3. Training Decisions. The CFETP uses a building block approach (simple to complex) to
encompass the entire spectrum of training requirements for the fire protection career field. The
spectrum includes a strategy for when, where, and how to meet the training requirements. The
strategy must be apparent and affordable to reduce duplication of training and eliminate a
disjointed approach to training.

B4. Community College of the Air Force (CCAF) Academic Programs. Airmen are
automatically enrolled in CCAF upon completion of basic military training. CCAF provides the
opportunity to obtain an Associates in Applied Sciences Degree. In addition to its degree
program, CCAF offers the following:

B4.1. CCAF Instructor Certification (CIC) Program. The CIC is a professional credential
that recognizes the instructor's extensive faculty development training, education and
qualification required to teach a CCAF course, and formally acknowledges the instructor's
practical teaching experience. Qualified instructors who teach CCAF collegiate-level credit
awarding courses at a CCAF affiliated school. Qualified officer, enlisted, civilian and other
service instructors are eligible for this certification. Once an instructor leaves CCAF instructor
duty, they are no longer eligible for the CIC and the three-levels of this program consisting of
CIC-I/II/III.                Complete            details      can         be        found       at
https://augateway.maxwell.af.mil/ccaf/certifications/cic/.

B4.2. The Professional Manager Certification (PMC). This professional credential is
awarded by CCAF and formally recognizes an individual’s advanced level of education and
experience in leadership and management, as well as professional accomplishments. The PMC
is primarily designed for Air Force SNCO’s. However, any enlisted Airmen who meet all
program requirements may be nominated and awarded the PMC. Once an individual retires,

found at https://augateway.maxwell.af.mil/ccaf/certifications/pmc/.

B4.3. CCAF offers the Instructional Systems Development (ISD) Certification. This
program is for qualified course/curriculum developers, writers and managers who are formally
assigned to affiliated schools to develop/write and manage CCAF collegiate-level credit
awarding courses. The ISD Certification is a professional credential that recognizes the
course/curriculum developer/writer’s or managers extensive training, education, qualifications
and experience required to develop/write and manage CCAF courses. The certification also
recognizes the individual’s ISD qualifications and experience in planning, developing,
implementing and managing instructional systems. The program is designed to broaden faculty
and professional development. Qualified officer, enlisted, civilian and other service curriculum
writers and managers are eligible. Once an individual leaves curriculum writer or manager duty,
they are no longer eligible for the ISD Certification. Complete details can be found at
https://augateway.maxwell.af.mil/ccaf/certifications/systems/.

B4.4. Trade Skill Certification. When a CCAF student separates or retires, a trade skill
certification is awarded for the primary occupational specialty. The College uses a competency-
based assessment process for trade skill certification at one of three proficiency levels:
Apprentice, Journeyman, Craftsman/Supervisor. All are transcribed on the CCAF transcript.

B5.1. CE Occupational Badge. The Civil Engineer badge reflects a great history and tradition.
By wearing it, you will be recognized by your fellow airmen as having achieved an expected
level of competence. The multitude of engineers before you established this expectation through
excellent service in both peace and war. Eligibility criteria for award and wear of AF
occupational badges can be found in AFI 36-2923 Aeronautical, Duty, and Occupational
Badges.

B5.2. CE Badge Heraldry. The gear wheel and compass have historically been used to
represent the engineering profession, in both the military and civilian sector. The gear represents
the essence of engineering: applying scientific principles and technology to practical ends. To
Air Force engineers, the gear symbolizes an element (representing the built environment) that
meshes with other environments (weapon systems and trained personnel) to enable the Air Force
to perform its mission. The compass is a precision tool historically used by engineers in
designing and constructing facilities and equipment. The gear and compass together symbolize
all the diverse specialties within Air Force civil engineer. Finally, the wings help to portray the
fundamental linkage between the engineering and aviation components; and that the built
environment is the foundation supporting Air Force mission and people.

                                  B5.2.1. Basic Badge. The basic badge is awarded upon
                                  successful completion of the apprentice course.




                                  B5.2.2. Senior Badge. The senior badge adds a star to the top
                                  of the badge. Wear the senior badge after award of the 7-skill
                                  level.




                                  B5.2.3. Master Badge. The master badge adds a wreath
                                  around the star. The Master Badge is awarded to master
                                  sergeant or above with 5 years in the specialty from award of
                                  the 7-skill level.

                    SECTION E – TRANSITIONAL TRAINING GUIDE

“There are no transition training requirements for the Fire Protection Specialty. This section is
reserved.”

                                             PART II

                    SECTION A - SPECIALTY TRAINING STANDARD

A1. Implementation. This STS will be used for technical training provided by AETC for
Apprentice Fire Protection Specialist course with class beginning 08 January, 2015 and
graduating 15 April, 2015.

A2. Purpose. As prescribed in AFI 36-2201, this STS, Air Force Training Program, and in
collaboration with the Civil Engineer, Air Force Career Field Manager (AFCFM), it is
mandatory for all civil engineers, regardless of duty assignment, to use an automated training
record. The automated training record currently being utilized to document upgrade and
qualification training is an application located on the CE-VLC.

A2.1. Column 1 (Tasks, Knowledge, and Technical References). Lists the most common tasks,
knowledge, and supporting technical references (TR) necessary for Airmen to perform duties in
the 3-, 5-, and 7-skill level.

A2.2. Column 2.

A2.2.1. (Core Tasks). Identifies core tasks (specialty-wide training requirements) by an asterisk
(*) in the appropriate skill level sub-column. As a minimum, trainees must complete hands-on
certification on all core and critical tasks for skill level upgrade.

A2.2.2. Wartime Tasks. All tasks in the 3-level course column are considered wartime tasks.
In response to a wartime scenario, these tasks will be taught in the 3-level course in a streamlined
training environment.

A2.3. Column 3 (Certification for OJT). Used to record completion of tasks and knowledge
training requirements. Use the automated training record application to document individual
qualifications. Task certification of core and critical tasks require a training completion date



                                                39
                                                                    CFETP 3E7X1, 11 August 2014


and initials of the trainee, trainer, and certifier. All non-core tasks require training completion
date and initials of the trainee and trainer only.

A2.4. Column 4 (Proficiency Codes Used to Indicate Training/Information Provided).
Indicates formal training and correspondence course requirements. It shows the proficiency to
be demonstrated on the job by the graduate as a result of training on the task, knowledge and the
career knowledge provided by the initial skills training course, correspondence course, and read-
ahead material. See CADRE/AFSC/CDC listing maintained by the unit education and training
manager for current CDC listings.

A2.5. Qualitative Requirements. Contains the proficiency code key used to indicate the level
of training and knowledge provided by WBT, resident training and career development courses.

A2.6. Job Qualification Standard (JQS). The STS becomes the JQS for OJT when placed in
the automated training application and used according to AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training
Program. When used as a JQS, the following requirements apply:

A2.6.1. Documentation. Document and certify completion of training.

A2.6.1.1. Duty position. Duty position titles and task requirements for each position will be
developed/identified by the Assistant Chief for Training or section supervisor in the automated
training application. Ensure the correct duty position title is listed under trainees Profile I section
of the trainee’s automated training record.

A2.6.1.2. Duty position change. To change a trainee duty position title select the Profile
section under the trainee record and select the new duty position from the dropdown box, entry
the date entered new duty position and save the update. Under the trainee JQS section you will
see the new tasks associated with the selected duty position. The trainee and trainer/certifier will
need to sign off the tasks associated with the new position.

A2.6.1.3. Transcribing from previous versions to the new CFETP. Most items should
transcribe automatically during the update of the new CFETP. The UTM and supervisor must
conduct a review of the new STS to identify any new core or non-core tasks and add those tasks
to their duty positions.

A2.6.1.3.1. Previous training certification not listed If previous training certification is not
listed in the individual record, select the parent task to be transcribed, check the task title(s)
block, and click on the transcribe button. Enter the date of the original certification and sign off
the task(s). The trainee will then sign off the task(s) to finalize the transcription of previous
training certification. The automated application will place an entry into the trainee 623a and
must be acknowledged by the transcriber and trainee.

A2.6.1.3.2. Transcribing external training certification. If a trainee attended a formal
training course and received appropriate accreditation, select the 623 III section of the user
automated training record and locate the course title in the master task list, then enter the
completion date. If the course title is not listed, contact the UTM to have it loaded from the



                                                  40
                                                                 CFETP 3E7X1, 11 August 2014


master catalog. If it is not listed in the master catalog contact the Force Development Manager at
AFCEC to have it loaded in the master catalog.

A2.6.2. Documenting Career Knowledge. When a certification course is not available, the
supervisor identifies STS training references that the trainee requires for career knowledge IAW
AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program and ensures, as a minimum, that trainees cover all
mandatory items specified in AFI 36-2101, Classifying Military Personnel (Officer and
Enlisted).

A2.6.2.1. Two-time certification course exam failures. Because firefighter certification courses
are part of a national certification system that has been accredited by the International Fire
Service Accreditation Congress operated by Oklahoma State University, the waiver authority for
two time certification course failures for this career field rests with the AFCFM located at
AFCEC. See AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program, Table 6.1, note 1 for specific waiver
procedures.

A2.6.2.2. Certification course waiver packages must be fully justified and be approved by the
applicable training and fire protection representatives at the squadron, wing, and MAJCOM
levels prior to being forwarded to AFCEC for final approval/disapproval. See AFI 36-2201, Air
Force Training Program for specific waiver procedures. For two time certification course
exam failures, supervisors identify all STS items corresponding to the areas covered by the
certification course. The trainee completes a study of STS references, undergoes evaluation by
the task certifier, and receives certification on the STS after successful completion of the task.
NOTE: Career knowledge must be documented prior to submitting a certification course
waiver.

A2.6.3. Decertification. When an Airman is found to be unqualified on a task, the supervisor
shall identify the task in the JQS and check the box next to the task title. The supervisor shall
select the Decertify button on the screen menu and enter a 623a comment explaining why the
task was decertified, and then enter the Airman into qualification training. The individual is
recertified using the normal certification process.

A2.6.4. Recertification. When an Airman is required to be recertified on a previous task due to
annual or bi-annual requirements. The supervisor shall identify the task in the JQS and check the
box next to the task title and select the Recertify button on the screen and entry the dates the
recertification was completed.

A2.6.5. Training Standard. Tasks are trained and certified to the “go” level. Go means the
individual can perform the task without assistance and meets the local requirements for accuracy,
timeliness, and correct use of procedures. This equates to a 3c in the proficiency code key.
Local requirements for accuracy, timeliness, and use of procedures shall be applied accordingly.

A2.7. Specialty Training Standard. The STS is a guide for development of promotion tests
used in the Weighted Airman Promotion System (WAPS). Specialty Knowledge Tests are
developed at the USAF Airman Advancement Division by senior NCOs with extensive practical
experience in their career fields. The tests sample knowledge of STS subject matter areas judged

by test development team members as most appropriate for promotion to higher grades.
Questions are based upon study references listed in the Enlisted Promotions References and
Requirements Catalog. Individual responsibilities are in AFI 36-2605, AF Military Testing
System. WAPS is not applicable to the Air National Guard or Air Reserve Forces.

Explanations
* A task knowledge scale value may be used alone or with a task performance scale value to define a level of knowledge for a specific task. (Example: b and 1b)

** A subject knowledge scale value is used alone to define a level of knowledge for a subject not directly related to any specific task, or for a subject common to
several tasks.

- This mark is used alone instead of a scale value to show that no proficiency training is provided in the course or CC.

X Training is required but not given due to limitations in resources.

Specific tasks not identified with a symbol or proficiency code key (blank) indicates that no training is provided in the course or CC. Major commands and /or
units may establish scale values and combat training as dictated by mission requirements.

Note 1: Trainers are responsible for annotating references to identify current sources pending STS revision.
Note 2: Underlined training references are commercial publications or other publications essential for enlisted specialty training and mission
accomplishment.
Note 3: Items located in column 4 of the STS that list an NFPA standard as a technical reference, the supporting knowledge/tasks, and their associated
behaviors are found in the referenced NFPA standard. These items will not include a proficiency code, but will be trained in the resident course or
certification course to a level that meets minimum NFPA requirements as defined by AFCEC/CXF and as authorized by the MAJCOMs. Note 3 is
referenced as N3 in the STS.
Note 4: When a knowledge/task in a referenced NFPA standard cannot be taught in a resident course, the affected knowledge/task will be identified in
this training standard using the standard proficiency code key found on the previous page.
Note 5: NFPA knowledge/tasks that are requirements for a previous certification level will normally not be repeated in a resident course.
Note 6: All STS knowledge/tasks listed in the 3-level residence column are considered core/war tasks and will be taught in a 3-level wartime course. When an
item lists an NFPA standard as a reference, all supporting knowledge and tasks are trained in the resident wartime course unless otherwise noted.
Note 7: Specialized courses are designed and specifically geared towards duty position qualifications. Although they are listed in the five skill level column, these
courses are applicable for people filling 5-, 7-, 9- and CEM skill level duty positions. For example, an Assistant Chief for Operations must be certified at the Fire
Officer III, Fire Instructor II, Fire Inspector II and HAZMAT Incident Commander levels. Applicable duty position certification requirements are listed in Part II
of the CFETP.

                     SECTION B - COURSE OBJECTIVE LIST (COL)

B1. Measurement. Measurement of each objective is indicated as follows:

B1.1. Written Test (W) indicates task or subject knowledge that is measured using a written test.

B.1.2. Performance Test (P) indicates required task performance that is measured with a
performance progress check.

B1.3. Progress Check (PC) indicates separate measurement of both knowledge and performance
elements using a written test and a performance progress check.

B2. Standard. The standard is 65% on written examinations. Standards for performance
measurement are indicated in the objectives and delineated on the individual progress checklist.
Instructor assistance is provided as needed during the progress check or performance test, and
students may be required to repeat all or parts of the behavior until satisfactory performance is
attained.

B3. Proficiency Level. Most task performance is taught to the “2b” proficiency level, which
means the student can do most parts of the task, but does need assistance on the hardest parts of
the task (partially proficient). The student can also determine step-by-step procedures for doing
the task.

B4. Course Objective List. These objectives are listed in the sequence taught by Blocks of
Instruction. A detailed listing of the initial skills course objectives may be obtained by written
request to the Louis F. Garland Fire Academy, 312 TRS/DOF, 301 Comanche Trail,
Goodfellow AFB, TX 76908-4213.

                           SECTION C - SUPPORT MATERIAL

C1. CerTest. CerTest is a computer-based program designed to test, evaluate, and certify a
student's knowledge of principles and procedures on various job-related subjects. CerTest does
not replace hands-on training. It is designed to augment and enrich a variety of training
requirements to ensure our people are trained and qualified to accomplish their duties. See the
CerTest Procedural Guide for specific program requirements and features.

C2. General Information. The Firefighter Certification System certification courses do not
have volume review exercises. CerTest gives us the ability to measure a student’s knowledge,
build confidence, and effectively prepare a student to take the certification course final exam by
allowing the student to take a series of interactive computer-based tests. It can be used to find
the strengths and weaknesses in an individual's training and experience. CerTest automatically
records and updates all test results. The training manager can copy records to a disk so that an
individual can bring current, accurate training information to a new unit; thereby helping the
gaining supervisor evaluate the trainee's knowledge and experience. See the CerTest Procedural
Guide for additional guidance.

C2.1. CerTest has been adopted as the Air Force platform for electronic certification
course testing. Air University Directorate of Education Logistics and Communication, A4/6
began using E-Exam on 1 June 2000. Currently, all CE AFSs are allowed to use E-Exam on
installations where Base Test Control Facilities (TCFs) are equipped. See your UETM for
further information.

C3. Air Force Qualification Training Packages. For up-to-date course status see the
Firefighter Certification System Procedural and Policy Guide at http://www.dodffcert.com/.

                   SECTION E – MAJCOM UNIQUE REQUIREMENTS

E1. Purpose. This section of the CFETP identifies MAJCOM unique training requirements
available for the fire protection specialty. Refer to Civil Engineer Virtual Learning Center (CE-
VLC) for information on the courses.

E2. MAJCOM-Unique Training Courses.

Course Title                                                              MAJCOM
Spacelift Firefighting Course                                             AFSPC
Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) Firefighting Course             AFGSC

                        SECTION F - HOME STATION TRAINING

F1. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to identify the tasks, training references, and
training sources available in support of contingency/wartime training. Civil Engineer forces will
train to meet the full range of tasks expected in the contingency environment. Training ranges
from knowledge-type training conducted in a classroom, to task-oriented hands-on training
conducted in the field. These training requirements, frequencies, and sources are listed in AFI
10-209, RED HORSE Program and AFI 10-210, Prime Base Emergency Engineer Force (BEEF)
Program.

F2. Home Station Training (HST). HST is knowledge-based and hands-on training that is
conducted at the individual’s home station for contingency operations. The CE Commander
ensures training is provided and documented and arranges for subject matter experts to conduct
training as required.

F3. Combat Skills Training (CST). CST must be institutionalized as an integral part of any
HST program. Lessons learned from operations such as IRAQI FREEDOM have taught us the
importance of maintaining a higher level of combat readiness. Although the inclusion of combat

skills-focused training into HST does not fully prepare CE personnel to work in a high threat
combat environment, the steps taken to enhance training will help elevate units to a readiness
level capable of supporting safe and effective operations in low to medium risk combat
environments.

F4. Mission Essential Equipment Training (MEETS). Wartime or contingency environments
often involve the use of specialized and unique mission-essential equipment that civil engineers
do not use in their day-to-day operations. Due to the cost and complexity, mission essential
contingency equipment and trainer expertise are not commonly found at CONUS installations.
Personnel must be hands-on certified and the certification documented in their CFETP. AFI 10-
210, Attachment 4, identifies minimum number of personnel to be trained, positions by specialty,
frequencies and locations of training sites. Inadequate training on these key equipment items can
negatively impact Air Force contingency operations.

F5. AF Expeditionary (ES) Training Requirement. AETC, as lead MAJCOM for AF ES
training, revamped ancillary home-station and advanced (mission specific) expeditionary skills
training plans to standardize and synchronize training across the force. The AF ES training is
described as Tier 2 and Tier 3 training below:

F5.1. Tier 2: deployment-ready expeditionary skills training. ES for all Airmen delivered at the
wing level in alignment with assigned AEF band. Completion of this training is a requirement to
maintain mission-ready status to produce a deployment-ready Airman, up to and including a
major combat operation. Tier 2 is designed to ensure every Airman maintains ES proficiency
and sustains readiness currency for deployment. Tier 2 curriculum is centrally maintained, but
executed at the local level to afford commanders maximum flexibility. Tier 2 is divided into two
categories; 2A: ES proficiency training (mostly CBT), and 2B: home-station pre-deployment
training.

F5.2. Tier 3: advanced ES training (mission specific). Enhanced ES for selected Airmen as
determined by factors including deployment location, threat assessment, specific mission, duty
assignment, role, operation, or special requirement. Tier 3 training provides mission specific ES
for the individual Airman and/or team and includes courses designed in response to organic Air
Force need or combatant commander-directed theater-specific requirements. Airmen will attend
Tier 3 training such as combat Airmen skills training (CAST) when identified through the force
generation process and directed in appropriate line remarks/reporting instructions.

F6. Training References.

F6.1. AFI 10-210, Prime Base Engineer Emergency Force (BEEF) Program, Chapter 4 and
Attachments 2-5 identifies the Prime BEEF recurring training requirements.

F6.2. Web-based Products. Web-based products are available on the CE Virtual Learning Center
(VLC) website at https://afcesa.csd.disa.mil/kc/login/login.asp. Personnel completing these
courses can receive credit for HST. CBT products can be used in a classroom setting to train as
many personnel as possible. Attendance must be documented on a sign-in roster. The sign-in
roster must be maintained IAW AFI 10-210.
