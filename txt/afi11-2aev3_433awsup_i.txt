                                           Chapter 1

                                 GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. General.
   1.1.1. This Air Force Instruction (AFI) provides policy for Aeromedical Evacuation (AE)
   Operations. It is an original source document for many areas but, for efficacy, restates
   information found in aircraft flight manuals, flight information publications (FLIP), and other
   Air Force directives. When guidance in this AFI conflicts with another basic/source
   document, that document takes precedence. For matters where this AFI is the source
   document, waiver authority is in accordance with (IAW) paragraph 1.4.2 For matters where
   this AFI repeats information in another document, follow waiver authority outlined in the
   basic/source document.
   1.1.2. Unit commanders (AE and MTF) and Command and Control (C2) agency directors of
   Patient Movement Requirements Center (PMRC), Tanker Airlift Control Center (618
   TACC), and Airlift Operations Center (AOC) shall make current copies of this AFI available
   to appropriate personnel. Transportation and base operations passenger manifesting agencies
   will maintain a current copy of this AFI. This AFI will be used by all units and agencies
   involved in or supporting AE operations. Copies will be current and available to planning
   staff from HQ to aircrew level.
   1.1.3. Airlift Resources. The primary USAF aircraft supporting intratheater AE are the C-
   130 Hercules, C-17 Globemaster, C-21 and the KC-135 Stratotanker. Overseas theater
   commanders have operational control of theater-assigned or attached aircraft through the
   Airlift Operations Center (AOC), who allocates those airframes as required to meet
   operational mission requirements. Primary intertheater aircraft are KC-135 Stratotanker, C-
   17 Globemaster. Additionally, the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) can be used when tasked
   through activation.
   1.1.4. Opportune Airlift. Opportune airlift is preferred to launching a special airlift aircraft.
   C-5 Galaxy and the KC-10 Extender can be used when available and if suitable to meet
   patient requirements. The C2 agency should direct the move. Use of opportune airlift is
   considered an unscheduled AE mission, and managed/reported in the same manner as any
   other AE mission, to include the change of the mission number when patient(s) is/are
   onboard. Aeromedical Evacuation Crewmembers (AECMs) on these missions will be
   universally qualified and follow quick response training IAW AFI 11-2AE V1, Aeromedical
   Evacuation Aircrew Training.
   1.1.5. Patient Preparation. A validating flight surgeon (FS), will determine the patient's
   suitability for AE. Medical authorities requesting the patient's evacuation must be informed
   of the impact of in-flight physical stresses on the patient. In the event the Medical Crew
   Director (MCD) has determined a patient is not stable/stabilized, is at significant risk for
   flight, or requires care beyond the scope of the AE crew, the MCD will coordinate with the
   PMRC and one of the following: 618 TACC, or AOC before refusing the patient. Depending
   on the contingency/tactical environment, refusing a patient for flight may not be applicable.
AFI11-2AEV3_433AWSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2013                                                        13


   1.1.6. In determining the risk for the patient in flight versus remaining in place,
   consideration must be given to the medical capability of the sending facility, the receiving
   AE crew, and the current operational situation.
   1.1.7. Determining Factors. Consider the following factors when transporting patients on
   aircraft; patient's diagnosis, condition, equipment, oxygen requirements, in-flight time, in-
   flight patient care requirements, and the number of medical personnel required. Emphasis
   must always be on providing quality, safe and appropriate care while minimizing potential
   risks during transport.
   1.1.8. Patient Load Planning Factors. The tasking C2 agency (PMRC, 618 TACC, etc.)
   determines the size/composition of the patient load on AE missions IAW this instruction and
   AFI 11-2AE V3 Addenda A, Aeromedical Evacuation Operations Configuration/Mission
   Planning.
   1.1.9. Mission. The mission of the worldwide AE system is to provide fixed-wing movement
   of regulated casualties using organic and/or contracted mobility airframes with AE aircrew
   trained explicitly for this mission. AE forces can operate as far forward as fixed-wing
   aircraft are able to conduct airland operations and may be tasked across the spectrum of
   military operations.
   1.1.10. AECMs prepare for the AE mission during peacetime by:
      1.1.10.1. Organizing, training and equipping assigned personnel.
      1.1.10.2. Instructing Department of Defense (DoD) medical treatment facilities on the
      use of the AE system.
      1.1.10.3. Exercising and evaluating contingency AE capabilities.
      1.1.10.4. Identifying medical and support equipment necessary to meet mission
      requirements.
   1.1.11. Aircraft Availability. AE missions are supported by:
      1.1.11.1. Dedicated aircraft (scheduled or designated channel missions).
      1.1.11.2. In system select (ISS - opportune aircraft).
      1.1.11.3. Patient/cargo mix missions.
   1.1.12. In all cases, use of specific aircraft are based on:
      1.1.12.1. Specific clinical requirements.
      1.1.12.2. Specific AE equipment needs.
      1.1.12.3. Timeliness of patient movement.
      1.1.12.4. Airfield constraints.
      1.1.12.5. Aircraft availability.
      1.1.12.6. Financial constraints.
1.2. Applicability. This AFI applies to aircrew members, support personnel, and managers
involved with employing Aeromedical Evacuation.

                                          Chapter 2

                               COMMAND AND CONTROL

2.1. General. The Mobility Air Forces (MAF) command and control (C2) network consists of
multiple C2 centers. The 618th Tanker Airlift Control Center (618 TACC) serves as the
AFTRANS Air and Space Operations Center (AOC) providing global C2 for AMC-assigned
inter-theater air mobility missions. Theater AOC's such as the Air Forces Pacific (AFPAC) 603
AOC and the Air Forces Europe (AFEUR) 613 AOC, through their respective Air Mobility
Division's (AMD), provide C2 for intra-theater-assigned air mobility missions and coordinates
with the 618 TACC on inter-theater missions transiting their theaters. Additional C2 centers
involved in the process are the Air National Guard (ANG) Readiness Center, Air Force Reserve
Command (AFRC) Command Center, Joint Operational Support Airlift Center (JOSAC), Unit
Command Posts, Air Mobility Control Centers (AMCC), Contingency Response Groups (CRG),
Contingency Response Elements (CRE), and Special Tactics Teams (STT). C2 centers are
action agents for the MAF commander with execution authority (operational control) over
mobility missions/forces.
   2.1.1. HQ AMC is the lead command for worldwide AE. HQ AMC Directorate of
   Operations (AMC/A3) is the executive agent for operational AE missions.
   2.1.2. AE crewmembers serve in the following commands: Air Mobility Command (AMC),
   United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE), Pacific Air Forces (PACAF), Air Force
   Reserve Command (AFRC), and National Guard Bureau (NGB). AMC is the gaining
   MAJCOM for all non-theater assigned AE forces.
       2.1.2.1. HQ AMC/A3 establishes, in coordination with the AFRC, NGB and other
       MAJCOMs, the standards for system-wide organization, equipage and training of the AE
       force.
       2.1.2.2. Total Force, multi-command coordination ensures standards for system-wide AE
       crew and AE mission support training requirements, for clinical and in-flight care, and
       for AE crew performance.
       2.1.2.3. HQ AMC Command Surgeon (AMC/SG) is responsible for providing clinical
       standards and procedures concerning the treatment of patients in-flight.
2.2. Execution Authority. Headquarters commanders with command authority over MAF
resources hold execution authority for directed missions. Commanders with execution authority
formulate plans, allocate assets, and approve missions through a local command post or C2
element. OG/CCs serve as execution authority for local training missions. The PIC will execute
missions operating outside normal communication channels (use last known mission orders or
best course of action). C2 of AE missions is the same as for any other airlift missions.
2.3. Pilot in Command (PIC)/Aeromedical Evacuation Crew (AEC) Responsibility and
Authority. SQ/CCs shall designate an aircraft commander (AC), instructor pilot (IP), evaluator
pilot (EP) as the PIC for all flights, on a flight authorization form, IAW AFI 11-401, Aviation
Management, and applicable supplements. An unqualified or non-mission ready pilot may not
be designated as PIC.
   2.3.1. PICs are:
AFI11-2AEV3_433AWSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2013                                                            17


      2.3.1.1. In command of all persons aboard the aircraft.
      2.3.1.2. Vested with authority to accomplish the assigned mission. The PIC shall only
      fly events authorized in the mission tasking unless, in the PIC’s judgment, an emergency
      condition demands otherwise. Fly unscheduled training events (for example, air
      refueling (AR) or transition training) after obtaining approval of the execution authority.
      2.3.1.3. The final mission authority and will make decisions not assigned to higher
      authority.
      2.3.1.4. The final authority for requesting or accepting aircrew or mission waivers.
      2.3.1.5. Responsible for passing mission progress reports (at least daily) to C2 agents.
      2.3.1.6. Responsible for interaction between aircrew members and mission support
      personnel and will establish a point-of-contact (POC) with the appropriate C2 agent prior
      to entering crew rest. Local C2 agents are responsible for coordinating mission support
      requirements on the PIC’s behalf.
      2.3.1.7. Responsible for the welfare of aircrew members, Mission Essential Personnel
      (MEP), passengers, and the safe accomplishment of the mission.
   2.3.2. SQ/CCs shall designate a MCD on a flight authorization form, IAW AFI 11-401,
   Aviation Management, and applicable supplements.
      2.3.2.1. MCD is a qualified flight nurse responsible for the overall supervision of patient
      care and management of AEC assigned to AE missions. He/she advises the PIC on
      patients’ conditions and the use of medical equipment that may affect aircraft operations.
      The MCD is directly responsible for the safety and medical well-being of patients on the
      aircraft and coordinates enplaning and deplaning procedures with supporting agencies. In
      matters of patient care, the decisions of the MCD are final.
      2.3.2.2. Charge Medical Technician (CMT) is a qualified Aeromedical Evacuation
      Technician (AET) responsible for the supervision and management of AETs assigned to
      perform duties on the mission. The CMT will ensure that medical supplies and
      equipment are on the aircraft and installed equipment is operational.
2.4. Not Used.
2.5. Operational C2 Reporting. AMC C2 facilities will normally transmit arrival, departure,
and advisory messages to the 618 TACC as appropriate. Aircrews on AMC 618 TACC-
controlled missions are responsible for transmitting these messages via L-Band SATCOM, HF,
DSN, etc., when transiting stations without an AMC C2 (fixed or mobile) presence. Crews on
missions not controlled by the AMC 618 TACC will report to their appropriate controlling
agency.
   2.5.1. Stations with MAF C2 Agency. Local MAF C2 agents will enter mission data
   (arrival, departure, and advisory messages) in the MAF C2 system.
      2.5.1.1. Crews not on AMC missions will report to their appropriate C2 agency, i.e.
      AOC/AMD.
   2.5.2. Stations without MAF C2 Agency. Transmit mission data to the controlling C2
   agency by any means available (i.e. DSN, HF, iridium phone, and L-Band SATCOM, etc.).

   HF Radio is the primary method of communication for routine mission information. For
   critical C2 communications, i.e. aircraft waiver request, maintenance delay, etc., voice
   communications are the primary method with L-Band SATCOM as the backup.
   2.5.3. Enroute Reporting.
       2.5.3.1. Make the following enroute calls to 618 TACC:
          2.5.3.1.1. Airborne call when departing from a location without an AMC presence.
          2.5.3.1.2. Maintenance call whenever aircraft alpha status changes to code 3.
          2.5.3.1.3. On AE missions, no later than 1 hour prior to landing, to update arrival
          time.
       2.5.3.2. CONUS. Periodic “ops normal” calls/transmissions are not required; however,
       the controlling C2 agency may increase reporting requirements.
       2.5.3.3. OCONUS. MAJCOM C2 agencies will specify increased reporting procedures
       through a communications plan in the Operation Plan (OPLAN), Operation Order
       (OPORD), Fragmentation (FRAG), Mission Directive, or FLIP. Aircrews will maintain
       listening watch in accordance with the communications plan within aircraft equipment
       capabilities (e.g. HF-Automatic Link Establishment (HF-ALE), L-Band SATCOM).
2.6. Not Used.
2.7. Not Used.
2.8. C2 Agency Telephone Numbers. Units should publish a listing of telephone numbers to
assist crews in coordinating mission requirements through appropriate C2 agencies. It should be
made readily available to crews and published in the FCB, Read File, or other appropriate
publication. Table 2.1 contains a list of 618 TACC phone numbers. Crewmembers may also use
the 618 TACC toll-free number, 1-800-AIR-MOBL, to contact other offices within the 618
TACC, including flight managers.
2.8. (433AW)C2 Agency Telephone Numbers. Command and control (C2) agency telephone
numbers will be published in the Flight Crew Bulletin (FCB) and placed in the mission kits.

2.11. Enroute Maintenance Support. 18 AF 618 TACC/XOCL will support all mobility
aircraft requests for parts and/or maintenance assistance regardless of type of mission or
component. Refer to paragraph 2.8 for 18 AF 618 TACC telephone numbers.
2.12. (Added-433AW) When commercial transportation is required to return to home
station, the Medical Crew Director (MCD) should first contact the C2 agency with
operational control of the mission, then contact 433 AW Command Post (CP) at Defense
Switched Network (DSN) 945-4330 or Commercial (210) 925-4330 to notify 433 Flight
Operations personnel.
   2.12.1. (Added-433AW) If AECMs must depart the mission en route, the MCD will contact
   the C2 agency with operational control of the mission, then notify 433 AW/CP. The
   Command Post will contact 433 Flight Operations personnel for additional instructions
   regarding changes to the flight authorization (e.g. remarks coding), pay documentation, etc.
   2.12.2. (Added-433AW) MCDs will prepare Air Force Technical Order (AFTO) Form 781,
   ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document, and submit this extract to the Pilot in
   Command (PIC) to be included on the mission’s original AFTO Form 781. The MCD
   designated as “lead” (normally the forward MCD) will complete the official AFTO Form 781
   extract when flying tandem training missions. The “secondary” will prepare a copy of the
   AFTO Form 781 extract for training purposes only.
   2.12.3. (Added-433AW) The AFTO Form 781 extract will include all AECMs, Operational
   Support Flyers (OSFs) and any additional required comments. OSFs will provide their home
   station Host Aviation Resource Management (HARM) office/ Squadron Aviation Resource
   Management (SARM) phone and fax numbers for the comments section.
   Instructors/evaluators will sign currency statements on both the original and the extract
   AFTO Form 781 prior to departing the aircraft. The MCD should ensure that the flight deck
   crew has completed all items in Section 1 of the AFTO Form 781 and that it has been signed
   by the PIC.
   2.12.4. (Added-433AW) The AFTO Form 781 extract will serve as a temporary document
   until a copy of the original has been received from the supporting flying unit’s HARM office.
   During training missions, the mission officer in charge (OIC) will review the completed
   AFTO Form 781 extract for accuracy completeness prior to releasing AECMs from duty.

                       AIRCREW COMPLEMENT/MANAGEMENT

3.1. General. This chapter provides guiding principles to form/manage mobility aircrews.
Commanders at all levels shall follow this policy to form aircrews and to develop aircrew related
work/rest schedules that optimize efficiency of mobility forces engaged in worldwide operations.
3.2. Aircrew Complement. SQ/CCs shall form aircrews based on fragmentation order/mission
directive, Crew Duty Time (CDT) and Flight Duty Period (FDP) requirements, aircrew member
qualifications, and other constraints to safely accomplish the mission tasking. NOTE:
Augmented aircrew members must be current, qualified and Mission Ready (MR) in accordance
with AFI 11-2AE, V1, Aeromedical Evacuation Aircrew Training. In those situations requiring
augmentation, the crew will be augmented from the start of the duty period. MAJCOM/A3
approval is required for crewmembers to join the mission en route for augmentation. If
augmentees join the mission en route, the crew’s FDP will be computed based on the FDP of the

NOTES:

(1) AFSC’s and number of additional AECMs may vary for supplemented patient acuity.
For guidance on AE crew supplementation see paragraph 3.7.1.3.

     3.2.1. Aircrew or Crew. The full complement of officers and enlisted members required to
     complete an assigned mission. AFI 11-401, Aviation Management, and this AFI validate
     AECM requirements for flight and define crew complement.
     3.2.2. Basic AE Crew. AE crew positions are required for the mission as explained in AFI
     11-401 and this AFI.
        3.2.2.1. A basic AE crew consists of two FNs and three AETs. NOTE: For deployments
        and Aeromedical Readiness Missions (ARMs), basic AE crew will be tasked.
        EXCEPTION: Refer to para 3.2.2.2 for C-21 missions.
            3.2.2.1.1. Chief Nurse Executive (CNE) may reduce/increase the crew complement
            based on Operational Risk Management (ORM) Worksheet. Minimum AE crew
            complement will consist of no less than one (1) Flight Nurse (FN) and two (2) AETs.
AFI11-2AEV3_433AWSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2013                                                               21


          Notify controlling C2 agency if crew complement differs from fragmentation
          order/mission directive.
       3.2.2.2. Basic AE Crew (C-21). The basic crew complement for a C-21 mission is one
       (1) FN and one (1) AET.
          3.2.2.2.1. For C-21 transports with a Neonatal or Critical Care Air Transport Team
          (CCATT), the AE crew may be limited to one (1) AECM due to weight and space
          limitations.
3.3. Aircrew Member Qualification. An aircrew member will be qualified or in qualification
training to perform duties as a primary aircrew member.
   3.3.1. Aeromedical Evacuation Crewmember. An individual who meets all the following:
       3.3.1.1. Is a non-rated aircrew member as explained in AFPD 11-4, Aviation Service,
       specifically trained to operate safely during ground and flight operations of the aircraft
       and is proficient with onboard emergency procedures and operation of emergency
       equipment. Individuals must be on aeronautical orders and perform their principal duties
       in-flight. Duties must be essential to performing patient care and operating associated
       equipment used for completing a mission.
       3.3.1.2. Is required for the mission as described in AFI 11-401.
       3.3.1.3. Is designated on the flight authorization to fulfill specific aeronautical tasks.
3.4. Not Used.
3.5. Not Used.
3.6. Not Used.
3.7. Aircrew Management. SQ/CCs and en route C2 agents shall ensure work/rest cycles are
adequate to permit an aircrew time to safely accomplish mission duties and personal time for
rest.
   3.7.1. FDP. FDP is the time period starting at mission report time and ending immediately
   after the aircrew completes the final engine shutdown of the day. SQ/CCs shall form aircrews
   based on worst-case FDP in the mission directive. Once en route, the mission directive or C2
   agent will inform the MCD of expected FDP at show time.
       3.7.1.1. Basic Crew FDP. The maximum FDP for a basic aircrew is 14-16 hours (see
       Table 3.2). Once an aircrew begins a basic FDP, only MAJCOM/A3 may extend to
       augmented day regardless of aircrew composition (MAJCOM/A3 shall augment basic
       crew to extend FDP).
          3.7.1.1.1. When extended en route ground times, non-optimum routing/winds,
          weather delays or other extenuating circumstances will increase a basic to an
          augmented FDP, the PIC with an augmented crew may accept an augmented FDP as
          long as:
          3.7.1.1.2. The C2 agent or PIC discovers the extenuating circumstances before the
          first takeoff of the day.
 22                                         AFI11-2AEV3_433AWSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2013


           3.7.1.1.3. The PIC verifies all augmenting aircrew members can get adequate rest en
           route.
           3.7.1.1.4. The PIC with a basic crew may seek MAJCOM/A3 (mission execution
           authority) approval to extend the FDP as much as 2 hours to complete a scheduled
           mission. Only use this provision to recover from unscheduled/unplanned en route
           delays. C2 agents shall not ask the PIC to exercise this option.
        3.7.1.2. Augmented Crew FDP. Maximum FDP for an augmented aircrew is 18-24 hours
        (see Table 3.2).
           3.7.1.2.1. CC/Operations Officer or CNE will augment an aircrew when FDP
           exceeds 16 hours and the mission profile will allow augmenting aircrew members
           adequate time to rest en route. Two additional litter spaces will be reserved for crew
           rest purposes when crew augmentation is required.
           3.7.1.2.2. Physicians, nurses, medical technicians, or other personnel designated as
           medical attendants (i.e. CCATT members) assigned to specific patients do not
           constitute an augmented AE crew and will not extend crew duty time. NOTE: AFTO
           Form 781 Documentation Procedures: When AE crews are augmented for time, only
           five personnel will log primary time when accomplishing flight duties. When
           crewmembers are in rest cycles, log other time. Reference AFI 11-401 for further
           guidance.
        3.7.1.3. Supplemented Crew (N/A for C-21). The CNE may adjust the crew complement
        to meet patient acuity and en route nursing care requirements based on ORM Worksheet.
        If the AE crew must be supplemented due to patient acuity or large patient loads,
        additional AECMs will be added. Number of AECMs and AFSC may vary. For example,
        an additional FN and AET may be added for large patient loads or 2 additional FNs may
        be added to assist with increased medication administration requirements. Notify
        controlling C2 agency if additional AECMs are required.
        3.7.1.4. Basic or augmented crews may be supplemented. NOTE: AFTO Form 781
        Documentation Procedures: When AE crews are supplemented for patient acuity, all
        personnel will log primary time. Reference AFI 11-401 for further guidance.

   3.7.2. CDT. CDT is that period of time an aircrew may perform combined ground/flight
   duties. Plan the mission so aircrew members may complete post-mission duties within
   maximum CDT. An aircrew member may perform mission-related duties for other missions
   when approved by member’s home station SQ/CC or equivalent. See Table 3.2 for MDS
   specific maximum CDT for a basic aircrew.
   3.7.3. Except as outlined below, CDT/FDP begins 1 hour after aircrew alert notification.
   SQ/CC or equivalent may task aircrew members to perform other duties before they begin
   flight-related duties or MAJCOM/A3 may authorize a C2 agent to alert an aircrew member
   early: begin CDT/FDP when the first aircrew member reports for those duties. For AECMs,
   CDT ends when the patients have been delivered to the receiving medical representative
   and/or when aircraft medical equipment has been secured, whichever is later. If the mission
   will Remain Over Night (RON), the PIC and MCD will coordinate alert/take-off time based
   on the latest crewmember CDT end point.
       3.7.3.1. For self-alerts, the PIC shall coordinate early individual/crew mission report
       times with C2 agents. Begin CDT/FDP when the first aircrew member reports for duty.
       3.7.3.2. ANG and AFRC crews may perform mission-related events on local training
       missions provided their time from start of duty does not exceed 16 hours and actual flight
       duty does not exceed 12 hours. NOTE: (AFRC/ANG) CDT/FDP includes both military
       and civilian work. It begins when the individual reports for his or her first duty period
       (military or civilian).
       3.7.3.3. CDT/FDP Extensions. See AFI 11-202V3, General Flight Rules.
   3.7.4. Deadhead Time. Deadhead time is the time computed traveling in passenger status.
   MAF aircrew members may deadhead for the purpose of positioning or de-positioning to
   perform a mobility mission or mission support function. Crew members may deadhead for a
   maximum of 24 hours. OG/CC or equivalent may approve crewmembers to deadhead in
   excess of 24 hours. Current/qualified aircrew members may perform primary aircrew duties
   after deadheading, provided they do not exceed a basic FDP (FDP starts at report time for
   deadhead flight).
       3.7.4.1. Aircrew members may fly in deadhead status after performing primary crew
       duties for a maximum of 24 hours from the time the crewmembers FDP began.
   3.7.5. Aircrew Member Support of Aircraft Generation Activities (Pre-flight, cargo up-/off-
   load, start, and taxi aircraft). Crew rest is required IAW AFI 11-202V3, paragraph 9.7.2. The
   duty day begins when the aircrew member reports for official duties.
3.8. Scheduling Restrictions. SQ/CCs shall not schedule an aircrew member to fly nor will an
aircrew member perform aircrew duties (PICs shall not violate any of the following restrictions
with an early takeoff):
   3.8.1. When the flight will exceed maximum flying time limitations of AFI 11-202V3,
   General Flight Rules.
   3.8.2. Within 12 hours of consuming alcoholic beverages (based on scheduled takeoff or
   ALFA/ BRAVO standby force legal for alert time) or while under the influence of alcohol.
   3.8.3. Within 12 hours following a hypobaric (altitude) chamber flight above 25,000 feet
   MSL. Aircrew members may fly as passengers during this period provided the mission is
 24                                          AFI11-2AEV3_433AWSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2013


   planned for no more than a 10,000 foot MSL cabin altitude. An aircrew member who
   participates in an altitude chamber flight to, at, or below 25,000 feet may fly without delay
   (primary/deadhead) as long as subsequent cabin altitude does not exceed 15,000 feet.
   3.8.4. Within 24 hours after compressed gas diving (scuba or surface supplied diving), a
   hyperbaric (compression) chamber mission, or aircraft pressurization checks that exceed 10
   minutes. Aircrew members will not perform multiple pressurization checks.
   3.8.5. Within 72 hours of donating blood. Aircrew members in mobility positions or subject
   to flying duties within 72 hours may donate blood with SQ/CC approval (donation requires a
   72 hour Duties Not to Include Flying (DNIF) period).
   3.8.6. When taking oral/injected medication unless the Command Surgeon grants an
   individual medical waiver. Except as noted in AFI 48-123, Medical Examinations and
   Standards, aircrew members will not self-medicate. An aircrew member may use the
   following medications without medical consultation as long as he/she understands the root
   cause of the ailment and that root cause will not impact flight duties:
      3.8.6.1. Skin antiseptic, topical anti-fungal, 1 percent Hydrocortisone cream, or benzyl
      peroxide for minor wounds and skin diseases which do not interfere with the performance
      of flying duties or wear of personal equipment.
      3.8.6.2. Single dose of over-the-counter aspirin, acetaminophen or ibuprofen to provide
      analgesia for minor self-limiting conditions that do not impede performance of aircrew
      duties.
      3.8.6.3. Antacid for mild isolated episodes of indigestion.
      3.8.6.4. Hemorrhoidal suppositories.
      3.8.6.5. Bismuth subsalicylate for mild cases of diarrhea.
      3.8.6.6. Multivitamin (one per day).
      3.8.6.7. An aircrew member shall only use dietary/herbal supplements following consult
      and approval of a FS. The FS should consider aeromedical implications and probability
      of the supplement to actually enhance performance.
      3.8.6.8. An aircrew member may use oxymetazoline or phenylephrine nasal sprays
      following an unexpected ear or sinus block during flight. Do not use these products to
      treat symptoms of head congestion that exist before flight.
   3.8.7. Immunizations: Crewmembers are not DNIF after receiving immunizations. However,
   a standard observation period is required. If adverse reaction occurs, the individual is
   considered DNIF until cleared by a flight surgeon to fly.
3.9. Counter Fatigue Management Program.
   3.9.1. The counter-fatigue management program for mobility aircrew consists of a range of
   options. First, aircrew should follow a healthy lifestyle to include proper diet, vigorous
   exercise, and most importantly take personal responsibility to get adequate rest. Second,
   leaders at all levels should set up flight schedules that permit aircrew opportunities to rest.
   Additionally, en route or deployed commanders and stage managers should ensure aircrew
   access to timely and nutritious meals and provide quiet, cool, and darkened billeting quarters.
AFI11-2AEV3_433AWSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2013                                                           25


  Finally, aircrew may use medications (with prior approval) that enhance natural rest during
  off-cycle crew rest periods. This section provides guidance with regard to the use of No-Go
  pills (prescriptions) that help aircrew initiate and maintain restful sleep during off-cycle crew
  rest periods. Go-Pills are not approved for use in flight.
  3.9.2. It is USAF policy that aircrew shall never use No-Go pills as a first choice counter-
  fatigue management tool. Unit commanders should plan missions to allow aircrew crew rest
  during their normal nighttime sleep cycle. This program permits commanders and unit flight
  surgeons an avenue to educate, test, and provide No-Go pills to individual fliers. No-Go Pills
  can provide a benefit for aircrew members to obtain satisfactory rest during off-cycle crew
  rest periods.
  3.9.3. Responsibility for counter-fatigue management of aircrew medicinal products rests
  with the home station FS, OG/CC, and with each individual aircrew member. To minimize
  potential for harmful interaction, the FS will judge whether or not each aircrew member may
  use No-Go pills with any another medication, to include nutritional supplements and over the
  counter (non-prescription) medications.
  3.9.4. Unit ORM programs shall include use of No-Go medication with OG/CC and FS
  oversight.
  3.9.5. A home station or deployed FS trained using the AMC/SG-approved (lead command)
  counter fatigue program is the point of contact for No-Go prescription. Upon request, the FS
  will advise/assist the local OG/CC to identify missions that may impair crew rest caused by
  duty day length, departure and arrival times, and other mission timelines.
  3.9.6. Aircrew members on Personnel Reliability Program (PRP) status will follow PRP
  notification procedures if prescribed No-Go Pills.
  3.9.7. The OG/CC shall establish a system to inform the FS when missions fall into any of
  the following categories (may cause sleep disruptions and are therefore candidates for No-Go
  medications):
     3.9.7.1. Home station night launch missions greater than four hours duration.
     3.9.7.2. Crew rest facilities lacking an optimal sleeping environment (quiet, cooled, and
     darkened).
     3.9.7.3. Off-station missions that are four or more time zones from home station.
     3.9.7.4. Rotating schedules (stair-stepped flying schedules) with greater than 6-hour
     flight time duration.
     3.9.7.5. Missions that run consistently near a 14-hour (or greater) duty day.
  3.9.8. SQ/CC will not schedule crewmembers to fly or perform crew duties within 12 hours
  of consuming No-Go Pills.
  3.9.9. Aircrew member’s responsibilities:
     3.9.9.1. Aircrew members shall not take No-Go-pills within 12 hours of consuming
     alcohol.
     3.9.9.2. Aircrew members shall not operate equipment within 12 hours after consuming a
     No-Go pill. EXCEPTION: Commanders may reduce the 12 hour timeline after consult
 26                                          AFI11-2AEV3_433AWSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2013


       with a flight surgeon to confirm prescribed No-Go pills have short duration effect. In no
       case will crewmember consume No-Go pills on a timeline where they are under the effect
       of medication while they operate equipment.
       3.9.9.3. Aircrew will inform the FS of any other medications (including nutritional
       supplements and over the counter medications) they are taking so the FS can evaluate
       potential interactions.
3.10. Crew Rest/En route Ground Time. OG/CCs shall establish procedures to place crew
members in crew rest. Mission planners/schedulers shall create mission itineraries that afford
aircrew members sufficient time to perform aircrew-related ground duties and still meet
physiological needs (relax, sleep, and/or dine). MAJCOM/A3 may waive any portion of the crew
rest period or ground time as needed to meet mission tasking.
   3.10.1. Home-station Pre-departure Crew Rest. For all missions crewmembers will enter
   crew rest 12 hours prior to reporting time. This 12-hour period is inviolate; no official duties
   may be performed. Infringement of the inviolate crew rest period will require the start of
   another 12 hour inviolate crew rest period. For missions that will keep aircrew members
   away from home station for more than 16 hours, unit commanders will enter primary and
   deadhead aircrew members into pre-departure crew rest 24 hours before they are legal for
   alert time. Aircrew members may perform limited non-flying duties (mission planning,
   launch/recovery) during the first 12 hours of pre-departure crew rest. OG/CCs may waive
   any portion of the first 12 hours of pre-departure crew rest. Do not manifest deadhead
   aircrew members as passengers to deny pre-departure crew rest.
   3.10.2. Off-station/En route Crew Rest. The minimum en route crew rest period is 12 hours
   before legal for alert or scheduled report time when self-alerting.
       3.10.2.1. Except during emergencies or as authorized by MAJCOM/A3, C2 agents shall
       not disturb an aircrew member in crew rest. When necessary to interrupt aircrew
       members’ crew rest period, re-enter that aircrew in a subsequent minimum 12 hour crew
       rest period after they complete official duties.
       3.10.2.2. Do not enter aircrew members into crew rest until they complete official post-
       flight duties. Those duties may include, but are not limited to, storing medical
       equipment/kits, update C2 on patient/mission status, aircrew arming, or mission
       debriefing.
   3.10.3. Off-station/En route Ground Time. Mobility planners shall provide aircrews allotted
   ground time between engine shutdown and subsequent takeoff IAW MDS specific Vol 3.
       3.10.3.1. Mission planners, PICs, MCD, or C2 agents may modify ground time as
       follows:
          3.10.3.1.1. In the interest of safety.
          3.10.3.1.2. To start (mission reporting time) no earlier than 12 hours from the time
          the aircrew entered crew rest. Before reducing ground time, PICs will consider time
          to complete mission planning, cargo up-/off-load, and non-standard mission related
          duties. C2 agents will not ask PICs/MCD to accept less than allotted ground time.
       3.10.3.2. Mobility planners should construct mission itineraries with en route ground
       times longer than allotted hours to afford aircrew members opportunities to recover from
AFI11-2AEV3_433AWSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2013                                                         27


     the cumulative affects of fatigue caused by flying on several consecutive days or due to
     transiting several time zones. If practical, make the en route ground time 36 hours
     (maximum) after three consecutive near maximum FDPs.
  3.10.4. Crew Enhancement Crew Rest (CECR). CECR is not an alternative to a safety-of-
  flight delay but provides PICs/MCDs a means to minimize the adverse effects of a crew alert
  and report period outside normal duty time. CECR periods should be of minimum duration
  and are normally used during de-positioning legs. Tasking authorities shall approve
  PIC/MCD requests to delay alert time to normalize the work-rest cycle or increase messing
  options when mission allows. When requests are disapproved, the C2 agent will inform the
  PIC/MCD of the reason for disapproval.
  3.10.5. Post Mission Crew Rest (PMCR). SQ/CCs shall give aircrew members returning to
  home base sufficient time to recover from cumulative effects of the mission and tend to
  personal needs. PMCR begins upon return to home base. (Not applicable to ANG and AFRC
  when returning to civilian status).
     3.10.5.1. For missions that keep an aircrew off station 16 or more hours, the SQ/CC shall
     provide 1 hour (up to 96 hours) PMCR for each 3 hours off-station. Do not enter aircrew
     members in pre-departure crew rest until the PMCR period expires.
     3.10.5.2. PMCR is not applicable to continuing missions and MAJCOM/A3 may
     suspend PMCR during contingency operations.
     3.10.5.3. OG/CCs (or equivalents) are PMCR waiver authority.
  3.10.6. Not Used.
  3.10.7. The lead USAF component will publish MAJCOM/A3 approved crew rest criteria in
  the Exercise or Contingency OPORD, OPLAN or Concept of Operations (CONOPs).
  3.10.8. Air Crew billeting. Prime Knight is designed to minimize the time aircrews spend
  getting into billeting at crew rest locations. Billeting success depends on the accuracy of the
  aircrew information. The ultimate responsibility for ensuring billeting requirements are
  passed rest with the PIC; however, the C2 agency will assist the PIC as much as possible.
  The following guidance applies to all aircrews and C2 agencies:
     3.10.8.1. C2 agency Notification Responsibilities. MAJCOM C2 will ensure current
     aircrew orders are transmitted to the next crew rest station's C2 agency NLT 30 minutes
     after the mission departs.
         3.10.8.1.1. (Added-433AW) In order to avoid unnecessary delays and maximize
         crew rest, the 433 AES Flight Operations Manager will confirm billeting
         arrangements for off-station missions with the host billeting office within 24 hours of
         scheduled take-off time. A corrected AF Information Management Tool (IMT)
         4327A, Crew Flight Authorization (FA), will also be faxed to the appropriate billeting
         office within 24 hours of scheduled take-off time if significant changes have been
         made to the crew complement.
     3.10.8.2. Aircrew Responsibilities. If a mission is departing from a non-AMC facility,
     the aircrew will call the next crew rest station, when able, to pass crew count/make-up,
     expected arrival time, number of officers, number of enlisted, male and female, etc.
 28                                          AFI11-2AEV3_433AWSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2013


       3.10.8.3. Units must ensure the fund cite is clearly indicated on the orders for
       reservations to be made in advance. Lack of a fund cite will require the aircrew to make
       their own advance reservations through use of a government credit card.
       3.10.8.4. AE units will fax a copy of the AEC’s AF Form 4327a, Crew Flight
       (FA)Authorization to local C2 agency where the AE mission is staging from, or will
       RON, and 618 TACC (as applicable) NLT 24 hours prior to scheduled mission date. This
       fax copy will notify C2 agencies of mission dates, AE POC (MCD) and assist with
       billeting arrangements. At a minimum, include the following:
          3.10.8.4.1. Where the AE mission is staging from and/or RON locations.
          3.10.8.4.2. Identify the MCD.
          3.10.8.4.3. Mission number.
          3.10.8.4.4. Mission date(s).
          3.10.8.4.5. AE Crew names/ranks/gender.
       3.10.8.5. The local C2 agency will provide PIC/MCD AE mission information when
       he/she checks on mission status. The Local C2 agency will be the link between the AE
       crews and the PIC, thus permitting mission status updates to both parties without
       interruption of crew rest.
       3.10.8.6. The MCD will interface with local C2 agencies for all AE missions. The MCD
       will ensure:
          3.10.8.6.1. Orders have been received.
          3.10.8.6.2. C2 agencies have MCD’s contact information.
          3.10.8.6.3. Any mission irregularities are discussed. This will occur prior to crew
          rest, at en route mission stops, and at AE mission termination.
       3.10.8.7. In coordination with MCD, the PIC may modify normal ground time (with
       concurrence of controlling agency):
          3.10.8.7.1. In the interest of safety.
          3.10.8.7.2. To no less than 12 hours from the start of crew rest until mission
          reporting. Before reducing normal ground time consider mission preparation time,
          time to load patients and cargo, and other factors peculiar to the mission. The
          controlling C2 agency will not ask the PIC to accept less than a normal ground time.
          Waivers for exercises and contingencies are IAW AFI 11-202V3.
          3.10.8.7.3. To a maximum of 36 hours, when the crew has completed three
          consecutive near-maximum FDPs. NOTE: Flight crews should be afforded crew rest
          times in excess of the minimum at en route stations, when possible, to give crews the
          opportunity to overcome the cumulative affects of fatigue while flying on several
          consecutive days or transiting several time zones.
3.11. Alerting Procedures. MAJCOM C2 agents shall establish a legal for alert time with the
PIC and when appropriate, the MCD of AE crews. C2 agents will inform PICs and MCDs of
AFI11-2AEV3_433AWSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2013                                                         29


aircraft status, expected patient up load time, and other pertinent mission details that will
streamline mission launch.
   3.11.1. Crew alerts will be per applicable MDS. Alert times usually allow 1 hour for
   reporting and an adequate number of hours for mission preparation. Refer to Table 3.3
   EXCEPTION: Crew alerts for local training sorties will be per applicable AFI 11-2MDS V3
   and local operating procedures. Self-alert procedures may also be used for normal local
   training missions.

Table 3.3. AE Crew Alert Times.
Aircraft        Alert Time
C-21            3 + 00
C-130           3 +15
C-17            3 + 45
C-5             4 +15
KC-135          4 +15
KC-10           4 +15

        3.11.1.1. For AMC missions, AMC C2 agency will alert the PIC/MCD. The MCD will
        alert the medical crew. The goal is to link the primary PIC, local AMC C2 agency and the
        MCD before mission execution.
        3.11.1.2. When the AE crew is staged separate from the front-end crew, the MCD will
        contact AMC local C2 agency and establish alert, showtime, etc. with the C2 agency. The
        MCD will make every effort to communicate with the front-end crew any mission
        irregularities prior to crew rest. Utilize local AMC C2 agency to leave messages for non-
        emergencies. Crew rest will be based on scheduled launch time. Do not violate crew rest.
        3.11.1.3. AE mission requirements can change depending on clinical status of the
        patient(s) and aircraft availability. There will be occasions when aircraft cannot depart
        (i.e. maintenance problems) or emergency patient movement that may separate an AE
        crew from the front-end crew. The MCD is responsible for communicating these changes
        with the PIC and local AMC C2 agency to de-conflict problems.
        3.11.1.4. C2 agents shall not alert outbound crews when inbound aircraft is on A-2 or A-
        3 status until maintenance technicians determine required parts are available and the
        aircraft will be repaired within the target ground time.
        3.11.1.5. Self-Alerts. Crews will self-alert at locations without a C2 agency, but must
        coordinate with controlling C2 agency. The PIC may elect to self-alert on operational
        missions at locations with a C2 agency. Coordinate the alert time with local C2 agents to
        avoid FDP limitations that result from unexpected changes in the mission.
        3.11.1.5. (433AW) AECMs self-alert for training missions and will routinely report in
        sufficient time to complete pre-mission requirements. Students, instructors, and
        examiners should allow adequate time to fulfill pre-mission requirements associated with
        instruction and evaluation activities.
 30                                            AFI11-2AEV3_433AWSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2013


             3.11.1.5.1. (Added-433AW) Changes to the flight schedule and stated mission
             report/brief times will be updated on the 433 AES Flight Operations answering
             machine. Short notice changes generated by weather, aircraft maintenance, or flight
             deck crew issues will be communicated to 433 Flight Operations section and the
             assigned MCD(s) via 433 AW/CP. 433 AES Flight Operations section will notify
             individual AECMs by telephone. AECMs will provide current contact information to
             Flight Operations section.
      3.11.2. The aircrew release policy is as follows:
         3.11.2.1. On the aircrew’s initial entry or re-entry into crew rest, the controlling C2
         agent, or PIC during self-alerts, will establish an expected alert time.
         3.11.2.2. For all missions, the latest allowable alert time is 6 hours after the expected
         alert time. The PIC may extend that window to 8 hours when flying as primary crew or
         12 hours when deadheading. The controlling C2 agent will not ask the PIC to accept
         more than the 6 hour window. ANG/AFRC aircrew members may extend the window as
         necessary to deadhead to home station to meet the Firm Scheduled Return Time (FSRT).
         3.11.2.3. When a C2 agent determines circumstances will not allow for aircrew alerting
         during the legal for alert window, at that time but not earlier than the expected alert time,
         he/she will contact the PIC and establish a new expected alert time at least 12 hours from
         the time of notification.
         3.11.2.4. At the end of the legal for alert window or if the mission risk becomes elevated
         and the aircraft commander determines the overall risk of the mission prohibits safe
         continuation, he/she will contact a C2 agent and establish a new expected alert time.
3.12. Stage Management.
   3.12.1. Stage Posture. Stages operate on a positive launch principle. C2 agents shall alert
   aircrews using the following priority/hierarchy:
         3.12.1.1. Aircrews that require an emergency return to home station.
         3.12.1.2. De-positioning stage crews will be prioritized by their SRTs.
         3.12.1.3. Aircrews in sequence of arrival time.
         3.12.1.4. If the stage manager returns an aircrew in the stage to crew rest because of a
         mission delay or abort, that aircrew becomes first out when legal for alert.
3.13. Standby Force Duty. MAJCOM C2 Agents shall task units for Standby Force Duty not
later than 18 hours prior to Legal for Alert time. This allows crewmembers 6 hours for pre-flight
duty and 12 hours of pre-standby crew rest. When aircrews are unable to complete all preflight
duties within 6 hours of crew show time, provide an additional 12-hour pre-standby crew rest. If
MAJCOM C2 agents are unable to provide 18 hours prior notification, SQ/CC shall place the
pre-standby crew in 12 hour crew rest. SQ/CC may keep an aircrew in ALPHA and BRAVO
status up to 48 hours. MAJCOM/A3 may extend this period for contingencies. After 48 hours,
launch, release, or re-enter aircrew into 12 hour pre-departure crew rest. ALPHA/BRAVO
Standby Force status is inviolate; no official duties may be tasked. Infringement of the inviolate
standby force status will require the start of another 12 hour inviolate crew rest period. OG/CCs
may provide additional local procedures for management of Standby Force Duties.
AFI11-2AEV3_433AWSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2013                                                            31


   3.13.1. ALPHA Standby Force. When tasked, SQ/CC shall posture an aircrew as an ALPHA
   Standby Force able to launch within 1 hour. Once SQ/CC forms an ALPHA Standby Force,
   that aircrew will accomplish follow-on pre-flights required by technical manuals. Follow-on
   pre-flights done during normal waking hours do not interrupt crew rest. Begin CDT/FDP
   when C2 agent directs the aircrew to launch from crew rest or while performing pre-flight
   (begin CDT/FDP when the aircrew arrived at the aircraft to do the pre-flight).
       3.13.1.1. (Added-433AW) Standby Force Procedures. Aircrews will accomplish the
       items listed in Table 3.4 to prepare for ALPHA standby.

and narcotics kit.
Secure all medications in a secure Logistics
Storage area.
          3.13.1.1.1. (Added-433AW) Mission kits and packages will be sealed for an
          ALPHA alert departure. Medications and narcotics from Wilford Hall Ambulatory
          Surgical Center (WHASC) will be inventoried, sealed, and secured in a secure storage
          area.
          3.13.1.1.2. (Added-433AW) ALPHA crews will normally be quartered in Lackland
          billeting upon entry into crew rest. Released crews will accomplish medication and
          narcotics inventory before returning medications to WHASC. AE In-flight Kits and
          equipment will be inspected, restocked, and signed in according to local policy.
   3.13.2. BRAVO Standby Force. When tasked, SQ/CC shall posture an aircrew in BRAVO
   Standby Force to permit launch within 3 hours. EXCEPTION: C-21 aircraft launch in 2
   hours. Follow-on pre-flights, if required, interrupt crew rest. Begin CDT/FDP when aircrew
   shows for duty.
   3.13.3. CHARLIE Standby Force. When tasked, SQ/CC shall posture aircrews as a
   CHARLIE Standby Force ready to enter crew rest within 2 hours. Tasked aircrews will be
   legal for alert 12 hours after entering crew rest. SQ/CC may keep aircrews in CHARLIE
   status up to 72 hours. After 72 hours, release aircrews from CHARLIE Standby or enter them
   into 12 hours crew rest for directed mission, training mission, or subsequent Standby Force
   duty.
   3.13.4. Wing Standby Force. OG/CC may place aircrews in Wing Standby status. After a 12
   hour pre-departure crew rest period, aircrews are legal for alert for 12 hours and must be able
   to launch within 3+15 hours. After 12 hours, launch, release, or re-enter aircrews in 12 hour
   crew rest period before subsequent 12 hours Wing Standby duty.

   3.13.5. Post-Standby Missions. On completion of standby duty, aircrew members may be
   dispatched on a mission. If started, post-standby crew rest must be completed before the start
   of pre-departure crew rest. If an aircrew member is dispatched on a mission, compute the
   post-mission crew rest time on standby time plus mission time.
   3.13.6. Post Standby Crew Rest. Aircrew members not dispatched on a mission following
   standby duty will receive post-mission standby crew rest as follows:
         3.13.6.1. If standby duty is performed away from normal quarters, crew rest time is
         computed from this standby time on the same basis as for mission time.
         3.13.6.2. If standby duty was performed in normal quarters, no crew rest time is
         authorized.
3.14. Orientation Flights and Incentive Flights. Refer to DoD 4515.13-R, Air Transportation,
AFI 11-401, and the appropriate MAJCOM supplement.
3.15. Interfly. Interfly is a temporary arrangement between OG/CCs or equivalent to permit the
exchange or substitution of aircrew members and/or aircraft between mobility units to
accomplish flying missions. Normally, interfly should be limited to specific operations,
exercises, or special circumstances. However, it may be used for events of longer duration such
as unit conversion to another MDS. Participating aircrews shall use guidelines established by
the lead command or as specified in the OPLAN or CONOPS. EXCEPTION: AE
crewmembers are exempt from interfly requirements. Conduct interfly operations as follows:
      3.15.1. Aircrew members shall be current and qualified.
   3.15.2. Aircrew members will follow operational procedures established by the lead
   command. The Mission Commander or PIC will brief MAJCOM-specific items.
   3.15.3. Each effected group commander who commits resources (personnel or aircraft) must
   concur with interfly proposal.
   3.15.4. Not Used.
   3.15.5. (Added-433AW) Attached Flyers. Non-squadron AECMs requesting attachment
   for flying duties will follow procedures outlined in AFI 11-401, Aviation Management.
   Attached AECMs will assume the 433 designation for purposes of flying documentation
   (e.g. AFTO Form 781).
         3.15.5.1. (Added-433AW) Attached AECMs will be certified IAW local procedures
         before performing instructor or evaluator duties. Attached AECMs will not normally be
         evaluators. Attached AECM instructors and evaluators will coordinate duties with 433
         AES Training Office (DOT) and/or Standardization/Evaluation Office (DOV).
3.16. Additional Crewmembers (ACM). Crewmembers qualified in mobility aircraft are
authorized ACM status on any mobility aircraft to pre/de-position in support of mobility
operations. MAJCOM designated crewmembers who are assigned or authorized to accompany
the normal crew complement are allowed ACM status.
   3.16.1. Crewmembers in ACM status are not authorized to:
         3.16.1.1. Displace manifested passengers.
         3.16.1.2. Maintain currency and/or log flying time.
AFI11-2AEV3_433AWSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2013                                                        33


       3.16.1.3. Use for transportation while on leave. EXCEPTION: ANG/AFRC Air
       Technicians may be in a civilian leave status while traveling en route to perform in a
       military duty status.
       3.16.1.4. Travel on Special Air Missions/Command Support Mission (SAM/CSM)
       aircraft unless authorized by HQ AF/CVAM through the PIC.
       3.16.1.5. Travel on Special Assignment Airlift Missions (SAAM) when specifically
       restricted by the mission directive (AF Form 59).
       3.16.1.6. Travel on Operational Support Airlift (OSA) aircraft unless authorized by Joint
       Operational Support Airlift Command (JOSAC) through the PIC.
   3.16.2. All ACMs require valid travel/flight orders or supporting message authorizing ACM
   status. OG/CCs may authorize ACM status for their mobility aircrews.
   3.16.3. ACMs normally travel in the crew compartment. If the number of ACMs desiring
   travel exceeds the capacity of the crew compartment, the C2 agency will notify the ATOC,
   who in turn will coordinate with the passenger terminal; seats not previously assigned may be
   used for ACMs.
   3.16.4. The PIC or designated representative will brief ACMs on seat assignment,
   appropriate mission information, emergency procedures including egress, and armed
   crewmembers. The PIC may assign an ACM aircrew related duties for which the ACM is
   qualified.
   3.16.5. ACMs will coordinate their travel with the appropriate C2 agency prior to travel.
   They will process through the C2 agency as early as possible but NLT 3 hours prior to
   planned block time.
3.17. Mission Essential Personnel (MEP). Procedures and policies regarding MEP are
contained in AFI 11-401 and AMCI 11-208, Tanker/Airlift Operations. PICs will ensure
personnel traveling in this status are properly authorized.
3.18. Mission Mobility Observers (MMO). MAJCOM supplements or additional directives
may establish programs authorizing senior military and civilian personnel to fly for mobility
mission familiarization. For AMC MMO information reference AMCI 11-208.
3.19. Flight Attendants on Distinguished Visitor Missions. Flight attendants may fly as
primary crewmembers on designated C-17 missions. They fall under the authority of the PIC, or
MC (if assigned), throughout the mission. An egress briefing will be given to the flight
attendants prior to the first mission leg.
3.20. Policies Governing Attendants.
   3.20.1. If an attendant is determined to be unacceptable, the MCD contacts the C2 agency
   for resolution.
   3.20.2. Medical Attendants (MA) provide patient care, documentation, and support under the
   direction and supervision of the MCD.
   3.20.3. MAs and Non-Medical Attendant (NMAs) accompany patients from point of origin
   to point of destination MTF. AECMs should offer relief to MAs/NMAs when mission
34                                         AFI11-2AEV3_433AWSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2013


  requirements allow. NOTE: AE system is not responsible for returning attendants to their
  originating location.
  3.20.4. A CCATT/specialty team will fly with an AE crew. CCATT members are classified
  as Operational Support Flyers and will only fly missions with an assigned AE crew.
  3.20.5. Attendants (except flight surgeons, CCATT) do not log any type of flight time.
  3.20.6. Guards of Prisoner Patients:
     3.20.6.1. Accompanies assigned prisoner-patients to their destination facility.
     3.20.6.2. Turns in weapons and ammunition to the PIC/Loadmaster (LM)/Boom
     Operator (BO), as required by appropriate AFI 11-2MDS V3 instructions.
     3.20.6.3. Coordinates with the MCD when handcuffs (if applicable) may be removed
     from the prisoner-patient while the aircraft is airborne.
     3.20.6.4. Prohibited from handcuffing prisoner patients to any portion of the aircraft.
  3.20.7. Enemy Prisoners of War (EPW). When/if EPWs are moved through the AE system,
  originating medical facilities will coordinate/arrange for appropriate host support agencies to
  provide guards for prisoners on AE missions. The AE system does not have the capability to
  provide guards, and prisoners will not be accepted into the AE system without guards.
  Guards assigned to medical prisoners must accompany them to the destination facility.
  AECMs will not accept custody of prisoners. The AE system is not responsible for returning
  guards to the originating location.
  3.20.8. Detainee Transport. Detainee missions fall under the responsibility of Security
  Forces and are politically sensitive. Providing AE medical support for detainee missions will
  not normally be practiced unless detainees require in-flight medical care. AECMs will follow
  Security Force guidelines if supporting a detainee mission.

                  AIRCRAFT MEDICAL EQUIPMENT OPERATIONS

4.1. Objective.
   4.1.1. Some medical equipment is incompatible with the airborne environment. AE approved
   medical equipment is identified in AFI 10-2909, Aeromedical Evacuation Equipment
   Standards.
   4.1.2. All medical equipment will be tested, deemed airworthy and approved for use through
   HQ AMC/A3VM. A specific test protocol establishing test and evaluation methods is
   developed for each piece of equipment. Tests include altitude/rapid decompression,
   vibration, electromagnetic interference and in-flight performance. In addition, explosive
   vapor testing has been added to all applicable equipment to ensure safety of operation in Fuel
   Vapor Bearing Area (FVBA) i.e. KC-135 aircraft. All applicable equipment listed in AFI 10-
   2909, Aeromedical Evacuation Equipment Standards, has passed explosive vapor testing.
   WARNING: The Airdyne 3500 Air Compressor® is not approved for use on the KC-135.
   4.1.3. Medical equipment and supplies are vital to the AE mission. There are many hazards
   associated with the changing in-flight environmental conditions that are not encountered in
   fixed facilities. Equipment used onboard AE aircraft must continue to operate properly under
   flight conditions. It is essential AECMs know the capability and performance limitations of
   each specific equipment item.
   4.1.4. HQ AMC/A3VM ensures standardization for equipment used system wide to enhance
   AECM equipment training, and provide for better equipment management.
4.2. Not Used.
4.3. Waiver Protocol. HQ AMC/A3VM is the waiver authority for non-certified/non-standard
medical equipment required for patient moves. Waiver requests will be routed as follows:
hospital/MTF will notify appropriate Patient Movement Requirements Center (PMRC). The
validating flight surgeon makes the medical recommendation for use of non-certified equipment.
PMRC will contact appropriate Command and Control (C2) agency, C2 agency will contact
Tanker Airlift Control Center (618 TACC) AE Cell, and AE Cell will contact A3VM. A3VM
will consult with 77AESG/TFL (AE Equipment Lab) during their hours of operation. Further
consultation on clinical impact will occur with the GPMRC/ TPRMC FS on duty.
Approval/disapproval is sent back to the AE C2 through the 618 TACC AE Cell. The AE C2
then makes the following notifications: PMRC, AEC and CCATT, as applicable flying the
mission and supporting ground medical elements. The attending physician must be advised of
the known operational limitations of the equipment and the possible effect this equipment may
have on the patient’s status in-flight. PMRC will input waiver information into the
TRANSCOM Regulating and Command and Control Evaluation system (TRAC2ES).
   4.3.1. Waiver will be obtained prior to use of non-certified/non-standard equipment onboard

   equipment brought to the aircraft from originating hospitals is airworthiness approved for in-
   flight use.
4.11. Special Considerations:
   4.11.1. Certain items, such as anti-shock trousers, will require special precautions when
   taken to altitude. Altitude restrictions may possibly be imposed or patient transfer delayed.
   The Validating FS will be consulted when such items are required. The Validating FS will
   advise on any special nursing care requirements and the best method to affect the transfer.
   4.11.2. All air filled balloon devices (e.g. ET tubes, foleys, etc.) will usually be filled with
   normal saline by the originating MTF to avoid the repeated pressure exposure by
   expansion/contraction of the balloons during changes in altitude. AECMs will check to
   ensure this precaution has been accomplished to prevent soft tissue damage and/or irritation.
   The C2 agency will also coordinate with the MTF. NOTE: The CCATT physician may elect
   to fill endotracheal and tracheostomy tube cuffs with air and then attach to a cuff pressure
   monitor to minimize tissue trauma and complications of reintubation.
   4.11.3. Water seal drainage systems, which use fluid to establish suction, will be checked
   frequently to ensure evaporation/changes in pressure does not reduce suction.
   4.11.4. Emergency drug kits will contain current Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS)
   Algorithms.
   4.11.5. At RON stations without an AE element/detachment, MCD/CMT will accomplish
   the following:
      4.11.6.1. Ensure there are adequate and secure storage facilities for medical equipment.
      4.11.6.2. The mission assigned AE crew is responsible for the actual cleaning of the
      medical equipment. If the AE crew is required to clean any AE medical equipment, the

   4.12.1. AECMs are responsible for all AE medical supplies and equipment.
   4.12.2. AE In-Flight Kit, Packaging Guide/Allowance Standard establishes a standardized
   packaging guide for all medications, supplies, and equipment carried in the AE In-flight Kit.
   Each unit is provided a minimum of two operational in-flight kits (increments one and two).
   Increment one supports 1-25 patients. Increment two is added to support 26-50 patients. The
   CNE is the final authority to determine which increments will best meet patient care
   requirements.
   4.12.3. Personnel will use the Allowance Standard to inventory the kit and when completed,
   turn in the completed form to the AE equipment management section. Units will not deviate
   from the equipment standard without concurrence from HQ AMC/A3VM. Unit procedures
   will be established to replenish medications, equipment, and supplies and ensure proper
   equipment maintenance at home and RON stations. Units will download most current AE
   Packaging Guide on the first day of each quarter (Jan, Apr, Jul, and Oct).
      4.12.3.1. (Added-433AW) The AE In-Flight Kit Packaging Guide/Allowance Standard
      887A may be accessed on the Fort Detrick Medical Logistics site. Users are required to
      establish an online account and password.
      4.12.3.2. (Added-433AW) 433 AES Mission Launch and Recovery (ML&R) Section
      will attach an inventory list to each bag of the AE In-Flight Kit based on the current web-
      based AE In-Flight Kit Packaging Guide/Allowance Standard. The Charge Medical
      Technician (CMT) or assigned AECM will ensure that the AE InFlight Kit has been
      inventoried IAW ML&R procedures to assist with restocking.
   4.12.4. When the in-flight kit is formally tasked for deployment, both increments will be
   deployed.
   4.12.5. Each mission has unique equipment requirements based on aircraft type, available
   aircraft systems, distances/times and the types of patients being airlifted and the frequency of
   urgent patient movement requests. In order to ensure a minimum level of equipment on all

135. All aircraft discrepancies observed by AECMs will be reported for inclusion on the AFTO
Form 781A.
6.24. Aircraft Servicing and Ground Operations.
   6.24.1. Aircraft Refueling. Refueling normally begins after deplaning patients are off the
   aircraft and prior to enplaning that station's patients.
       6.24.1.1. Simultaneous fuel and oxygen servicing is not authorized.
       6.24.1.2. If cabin lights, electrical power to operate medical equipment, and aircraft
       inter-phone are operating prior to refueling, use may be continued during servicing
       operations provided it does not radiate energy. (Do not turn electronic equipment on or
       off during refueling.) EXCEPTION: Only those systems, switches or electrical circuits
       needed to operate equipment to sustain life, may be turned on and used during refueling.
   6.24.2. Concurrent Ground Operations. Concurrent servicing (CS) is the simultaneous
   servicing of fuel or oxygen with or without patients on board while cargo loading/unloading
   or maintenance operations are being performed.
       6.24.2.1. The PIC and Chief Servicing Supervisor (CSS) shall ensure aircrew members
       and servicing personnel accomplish Concurrent Servicing (CS) per AFI 32-2001 The Fire
       Protection Operations and Fire Prevention Program and TO 00-25-172. The CSS will
       coordinate with all personnel involved prior to beginning concurrent operations.
       6.24.2.2. CS may be accomplished with patients onboard the C-17 and C-130. CS will
       not be accomplished on the C-5, KC-10 and KC-135. For C21 aircraft, utilize MDS-
       specific guidance for CS per para 6.24.4.
          6.24.2.2.1. Prior to starting concurrent servicing, the total number of patients,
          passengers, and crew on board the aircraft will be given to the fire department.
          6.24.2.2.2. A current and qualified crewmember for the type of aircraft being
          serviced will be appointed as a Passenger Compartment Monitor (PCM) and shall
          continuously monitor patients/passengers during CS. PCMs will not perform other
          duties during servicing. EXCEPTION: see MDS guidance below. AECMs and
          passenger service representatives will not serve as PCMs.
          6.24.2.2.3. The PCM will brief patients on emergency egress, exit prohibitions, and
          hazards. Ambulatory patients will remain seated but will not wear seatbelts during
          CS. When possible, the PCM should conduct the briefing prior to servicing.
          6.24.2.2.4. Loading ramps/stairs are in place for immediate use and exits (excluding
          the overhead escape hatches) are opened for egress.
52                                            AFI11-2AEV3_433AWSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2013


            6.24.2.2.5. At least two qualified AECMs (one must be a FN) will remain onboard to
            observe patients and assist patients in the event of an egress.
            6.24.2.2.6. The PIC, designated aircrew representative, or CSS will advise PCMs and
            AECMs when to evacuate patients.
            6.24.2.2.7. Patients will not enter or exit the aircraft during servicing. Crewmembers
            may enter or exit the aircraft only when performing essential duties associated with
            the concurrent servicing operation. Individuals must properly ground themselves
            before boarding the aircraft.
            6.24.2.2.8. Activities around the aircraft will be kept to a minimum during the
            refueling process. Onload/Offload patient and passenger baggage prior to or after
            refueling.
            6.24.2.2.9. The PCM will set the interior lighting as bright as possible to suit the
            combat environment.
            6.24.2.2.10. Do not use the on board toilet facilities during servicing.
  6.24.3. Crash/Fire/Rescue (CFR).
        6.24.3.1. When concurrent fuel servicing with patients/passengers on board a major
        aircraft, rescue and fire vehicle will be available to respond within three minutes or as
        determined by the base Fire Chief. (NOTE: When servicing with JP-4 or Jet B Fuel, a
        major aircraft rescue and fire vehicle will be positioned at the aircraft).The flight crew
        will coordinate CFR requirements.
        6.24.3.2. At non-AMC bases, non-U.S. military bases, and civilian airfields, the
        controlling agency will coordinate CFR coverage, as necessary. The request for CFR
        vehicle coverage may be denied. This will not prevent refueling operations from
        occurring.
     6.24.4. C-21 Aircraft.
        6.24.4.1. IAW Interim Operational Supplement T.O. 00-25-172S-3, concurrent servicing
        is authorized for the C-21. However, the decision to refuel with patients on board must be
        made judiciously and only after the PIC briefs the MCD and the patient, on the
        emergency evacuation plan prior to commencing refueling operations. Concurrent
        servicing is only authorized under the following conditions:
            6.24.4.1.1. If deplaning a critical patient would increase risk by an additional move
            off and back on the aircraft, or
            6.24.4.1.2. If there is no suitable location on the airfield to house the patient during
            the refueling, or
            6.24.4.1.3. If no suitable transportation (ambulance) is available to move the patient
            from the aircraft, or
            6.24.4.1.4. If the patient would be exposed to inclement weather.
            6.24.4.1.5. The aircraft door will remain open during all phases of the refueling
            operation with patients onboard. External power may be applied and cockpit
            aeromedical switches may be placed to the ON position prior to the start of refueling
AFI11-2AEV3_433AWSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2013                                                               53


           operations. Medical life support equipment may also be operated on battery power
           during refueling operations.
           6.24.4.1.6. As an additional safety measure, one C-21 pilot must remain at the
           aircraft at all times during refueling. Stable, ambulatory patients will routinely be
           deplaned during refueling if there is a suitable area to provide them shelter.
6.25. Not Used.
6.26. Aircrew Life Sustaining Equipment Requirements. Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE)
includes those systems, subsystems, emergency survival equipment, and techniques that will
sustain life in-flight, afford varying degrees of protection and enhance survival potential during
and after in-flight emergencies, crash landing, or ditching.
   6.26.1. AFE requirements are in AFI 11-301, Volume 1, Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE)
   Program. Emergency/aircrew life sustaining equipment required onboard AE missions are
   contained in the AECM Support Kit. Each kit contains 7 Survival Vests, 7 Aircrew Body
   Armor, 7 Anti-Exposure Suits, and 7 LPU-10/P Life Preservers.
       6.26.1.1. For C-5, C-17, C-130, KC-10 and KC-135 missions, the LM/BO is responsible
       for checking AFE. The CMT must coordinate with the LM/BO to determine that
       sufficient aircrew life sustaining equipment is onboard prior to departure. The CMT must
       ensure all AFE is distributed and immediately available to all patients before mission
       departure. The LM/BO is responsible for noting unserviceable/missing aircrew life
       sustaining items on the AFTO Form 46, Preposition Life Support Equipment. For C-21,
       the PIC is responsible for checking AFE.
       6.26.1.2. The MA-1 portable walk-around bottle is the primary emergency oxygen
       source for AECMs. EXCEPTION: Given the shortage of MA-1 portable walk-around
       bottles, the Protective Breathing Equipment (PBE) may be used as a primary oxygen
       source while performing crew duties.
       6.26.1.3. The A-21 regulators of some MA-1 bottles are modified to restrict flow of
       oxygen during servicing. The modification is designed to reduce risk of fire when
       servicing bottles off aircraft. Restricted flow increases on-aircraft fill time from 30-45
       seconds (unmodified regulator) to as much as 3.5 minutes (modified regulator). Under
       certain conditions, bottles are depleted faster than they can be refilled.
           6.26.1.3.1. Identification. Regulator type is determined by viewing the inside of the
           fill nozzle. Unmodified regulators have a push valve inside the nozzle resembling a
           standard tire valve stem. Modified regulators have a brass plate/filter covering inside
           of nozzle. Modified 2 regulators have a brass plate/filter covering inside of the
           nozzle and no valve stem is visible.
           6.26.1.3.2. Basic Operation. Except for fill times, operation of bottles are identical
               6.26.1.3.2.1. AECMs will check regulator type during pre-flight. Modified,
               modified 2, or unmodified MA-1 bottles may be used. If an AECM is using a
               modified bottle, they must ensure it is full at mission preflight. If emergency
               oxygen is required during flight and the walk-around bottle is depleted, the
               AECM will don a Protective Breathing Equipment (PBE) as the second source of
               emergency oxygen. Once the PIC has determined it is safe to move about the
 54                                         AFI11-2AEV3_433AWSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2013


             cabin and AECMs may remove emergency oxygen, AECMs will check the
             patients. After all patients’ needs are met AECMs will refill their MA-1 bottle.
             Should emergency oxygen be required before the walk-around bottle is refilled, a
             PBE will be used. If a PBE is not available and the Emergency Passenger
             Oxygen System (EPOS) is the only available source, the AECM will cease crew
             duties and be seated until the PIC has directed crew members to remove
             emergency oxygen.
      6.26.1.4. AECMs will not remove the LM/BO emergency equipment (cargo
      compartment quick dons/smoke masks) for use.
      6.26.1.5. AE units will not service MA-1 portable oxygen bottles. Dash 21/Alternate
      Mission Equipment (AME) shops will ensure MA-1 portable oxygen bottles are
      serviceable and properly maintained. NOTE: If a MA-1 bottle is accidentally left open
      or the system is depleted and not recharged within two hours, bottles will be purged as
      follows:
          6.26.1.5.1. Fill the bottle using oxygen recharger hose until full (300 psi [+/- 25 psi]).
          6.26.1.5.2. Turn MA-1 bottle upside down and turn to “EMERGENCY” setting until
          empty.
          6.26.1.5.3. Repeat for a total of three times.
      6.26.1.6. EPOS will be distributed and their use demonstrated prior to flight. Ensure
      EPOS are readily available for litter patients.
      6.26.1.7. Crewmembers will check their emergency oxygen equipment during the
      preflight inspection. Oxygen equipment will be immediately available at each crew
      position, individual masks will not be disconnected until all patients/attendants have
      deplaned.
          6.26.1.7.1. MA-1 portable walk-around bottle preflight (PRICE Check).
             6.26.1.7.1.1. P- Pressure: Ensure portable walk-around bottle indicates 300 psi
             +/- 25 psi.
             6.26.1.7.1.2. R- Regulator: Ensure there are no signs of visible damage to the
             regulator gauge, and view inside of the fill nozzle to identify if bottle is modified
             or unmodified.
             6.26.1.7.1.3. I- Inspection: Ensure Quick-don Mask and goggles are properly
             secured and clean. Check for holes, tears, cuts or abrasions. Inspect bottle for
             signs of damage.
             6.26.1.7.1.4. C- Connections: Ensure Quick-don Mask is connected to O2 bottle.
             Adjust harness to expedite donning in emergency. If connected to aircraft
             communication system, confirm communication capability.
             6.26.1.7.1.5. E- Emergency: Don mask with goggles, pull purge valve, rotate
             through all settings (Normal – Emergency). Oxygen should be felt inside
             goggles. Leave purge valve in the OPEN (pulled out) position for flight.
EXCEPTION: Where smoke or fumes are not present and goggles are not required, push the
AFI11-2AEV3_433AWSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2013                                                          55


pin in the CLOSED (pushed in) position.

NOTE: AECMs will adjust and fit leg straps to ensure inadvertent swinging of the bottle when
used in an emergency situation.

EXCEPTION 1 - The 3AET may disconnect and off load his/her mask if duties require him/her
to depart the flight line.

EXCEPTION 2 - If all patients and attendants have been deplaned and the AECMs are
deplaning at that station; AECMs may remove oxygen masks if the passengers will be supervised
by the flight crew.
   6.26.2. PBE, if available, is excellent for use in smoke, fume, or fire environments. They
   need not be limited to “escape” only conditions; these devices can be used as an oxygen
   source in a rapid or slow decompression.
   6.26.3. Rafts. On over water flights do not carry more patients, passengers, and
   crewmembers than on board life rafts will accommodate.
   6.26.4. LPUs. The loadmaster/BO/AEC will place an LPU within easy reach of each patient
   (litter/ambulatory)/medical attendants and aircrew member prior to takeoff on over water
   flights. Crewmembers will fit and adjust LPUs (if applicable) for over water flights and will
   wear them on over water missions below 2000 feet. (EXCEPTION: LPUs do not need to be
   worn for takeoffs, landings, or approaches). Ensure the appropriate number of LPU-6/P’s are
   aboard for over water missions carrying infants. Use the Adult/ Child life preserver for litter
   patients. The use of the LPU-6/P Infant Cot is limited to infants 18 months of age or less and
   up to 30 lbs.
6.27. Fleet Service. Ensure the required fleet service items are aboard the aircraft early enough
to permit inventory prior to engine start.
6.28. Not Used.
6.29. Airlifting Hazardous Cargo.
   6.29.1. Cargo may be carried with patients unless a clear detriment to the health and well
   being of the patient or passengers can be demonstrated. EXCEPTION: Cargo will not be
   carried on the KC-135 with patients onboard. The decision will be made by the MCD and
   PIC, considering the need for maximum utilization of the aircraft. Refer to AFMAN 24-204,
   Preparing Hazardous Materials for Air Shipments for hazardous product special provisions
   rating. P4 and P5 rated hazardous material have no AE restrictions. Conflicts will be referred
   to the respective tasking AE command element for decision.
6.30. Handling of Classified Cargo, Registered Mail, Not Mission Capable Supply
(NMCS), Very, Very Important Part (VVIP), Forward Supply System (FSS) Shipments,
and Courier Material.
   6.30.1. NMCS/VVIP/FSS shipments should not be moved on AE missions without the
   consent of the 618 TACC AE Cell for CONUS and intertheater AE missions or the
   respective theater Air Operations Center (AOC) for AE missions within the overseas theater.

Section 6D— Departure

6.31. On Time Takeoffs. Mission departures are on time if the aircraft is airborne within -
20/+14 minutes of scheduled takeoff time or as specified in a MAJCOM supplement.
   6.31.1. Early Departures. Early departures are authorized to prevent a delay due to weather,
   ATC restrictions, airfield or aircraft operational limitations, to adjust mission flow during a
   large-scale operation, or if approved through C2 channels provided the impact on local and
   downrange facilities and crew duty is evaluated.

Section 6G— Miscellaneous

6.48. Not Used.
6.49. Not Used.
6.50. Aircrew Flight Equipment and Dash 21 Equipment Documentation. The PIC or
designated representative will:
   6.50.1. Before departing home station or en route stations, ensure appropriate serviceable
   protective clothing, aircrew life sustaining equipment, and Dash 21 equipment for the entire
   or remainder of the mission are aboard the aircraft.
   6.50.2. Before departing home station and following en route crew changes, review AF
   Form 4076, Aircraft Dash 21 Equipment Inventory, to ensure all required Dash 21 equipment
   has been certified as installed by maintenance. Ensure the initial check has been signed by
   maintenance, and configuration documents match mission requirements.
   6.50.3. Before departing home station and following en route crew changes, review, sign,
   and date the AFTO Form 46, Prepositioned Life Support Equipment, to ensure all required
   protective clothing and aircrew life sustaining equipment have been certified as installed by
   AFE personnel and that configuration documents match mission requirements. Ensure
   appropriate number and type of life preservers are aboard for over-water missions carrying
   children and infants.
   6.50.4. Missing Equipment. AECMs discovering equipment missing will notify LM/BO.
6.51. Passenger Restrictions. No-show patient or passenger baggage or baggage of patients or
passengers removed from flight will be off-loaded prior to departure.
6.52. Apparent Patient Death in Flight. When a suspected death occurs in-flight, the planned
itinerary will not be interrupted if the next scheduled stop is that patient’s destination. If the next
stop is not the patient’s destination and the aircraft is not in a critical phase of flight, the MCD
may contact the AE C2 agencies to discuss options. If the aircraft is in critical phase of flight or
has landed the MCD will contact AE C2 agencies and make arrangements to have physician
meet the aircraft if appropriate and pronounce the patient dead. Once pronounced, the patient
will be off-loaded.
   6.52.1. When notified by the MCD that a suspected death has occurred, the PIC should
   immediately provide C2 agencies with the following information: “A suspected death has
   occurred on mission number________. ETA to ________ is __________Z, patient cite
   number______.” The PIC relays this information to the controlling agency for relay to the
   appropriate C2 agencies. NOTE: No personal data such as name, SSN, etc. will be
   transmitted, to preclude premature release prior to notification of the next of kin.
   6.52.2. If a physician is onboard during the flight he/she may pronounce death in-flight. The
   MCD will document time of pronouncement in “Z” time and the physician will co-sign the
   DD Form 602 or AF Form 3899. The MCD will contact C2 agencies to alert them of
 58                                           AFI11-2AEV3_433AWSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2013


   situation to determine destination. Records, medication, baggage, and physical effects will
   be inventoried prior to offloading and documented on AF Form 1053, Record of Patients
   Storing Valuables.Document the event on the AF Form 3829 and the AF Form 2852.
   6.52.3. If a patient expires on an AE mission, the MCD has several decision points. First, if
   the next destination is the deceased deplaning point, the body will be off-loaded at that
   destination regardless if military or civilian. The MCD will contact the deplaning airfield’s
   Air Transportation Operations Center (ATOC) and request mortuary affairs at military
   installations or, civilian coroner at civilian airfields. Once the aircraft has landed, follow that
   airfield’s guidelines for death certificate and body removal. Once the patient has been
   pronounced deceased, airlift ceases, unless the MCD/PIC contact C2 authorities for unique
   situations. Do not continue airlift without a death certificate.
   6.52.4. Home Station. In the event of patient death in flight or patient death within 24 hours
   of flight, upon mission completion the AES/CC shall ground the involved AEC and conduct
   an investigation to determine if the AEC followed all aircrew procedures. If necessary,
   appropriate actions will be taken to resolve any digressions (AF Form 8, Certificate of
   Aircrew Qualification, retraining, etc.) prior to returning individual(s) involved to flying
   status. AE unit commander shall notify Operations Group Commander who will notify the
   MAJCOM A3 of incident and actions taken.
   6.52.5. Deployed AECMs. Detachment Commander or detachment Operations Group
   Commander with operational control of the mission will be notified of the incident by the C2
   agency. If the AEC is in the mobility system, the AE detachment commander where the
   crew disembarks the aircraft will conduct the investigation to determine if the AEC followed
   all aircrew procedures. In the event AECMS are in deadhead status, AECMs will return to
   deployed/staged unit.
6.53. Airlift of Human Remains. Remains of deceased personnel will not normally be carried
on AE missions. However, in the interest of timely movement or other factors, which cannot
otherwise be satisfied by subsequent airlift, transportation of remains may be authorized. For 618
TACC controlled missions, submit requests for movement of remains on aeromedical aircraft to
the 618 TACC/APCC. The 618 TACC/XOZ, will provide approval. Approval authority will not
be delegated below the 618 TACC/XOZ level. For non-618 TACC controlled mission contact
appropriate C2 agency. If approval is granted to move remains on aeromedical mission, the
ATOC chief will ensure loading or offloading is accomplished discreetly; not concurrently with
passenger and patient loading or offloading. In such cases, the PIC will ensure the on-load,
position, and off-load are conducted in a discrete manner. In most situations, a ceremony will be
conducted to pay respect and honor to the deceased member.
6.54. Patients Requesting Release from AE System.
   6.54.1. The MCD may release active duty patients/attendants only upon a competent medical
   authority's recommendation and with the concurrence of the active duty member's
   commander.
   6.54.2. The MCD will ensure AF Form 3841, Certificate of Release, is completed when a
   non-active duty patient/attendant requests release from the AE system during a mission. If
   the patient is under the age of 18 years, the patient’s legal guardian must sign the form prior
   to the patient’s release.
AFI11-2AEV3_433AWSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2013                                                         59


     6.54.2.1. Whenever completing this form, ensure proper AE C2 agency is informed
     immediately.
     6.54.2.2. Prior to obtaining the signature of the requesting individual, the MCD
     determines if the individual is sufficiently competent to understand the purpose of the AF
     Form 3841. If not, the MCD requests advice from a medical authority or the staff judge
     advocate at the place of requested debarkation, if such personnel are available. In all
     instances, guidance from the C2 agency should be requested.
  6.54.3. Prepare the AF Form 3841 in triplicate. The original will be placed in the patient’s
  medical record; one (1) copy will be attached to the AF Form 3829, (or TRAC2ES
  equivalent) to be filed upon termination of the mission; one (1) copy will be given to the
  individual requesting release from the AE system. Also, complete DD Form 2852.
  6.54.4. When a patient, or their authorized representative, requests release from further
  airlift, the MCD advises the individual requesting release, that the purpose of the AF Form
  3841 is to release the U.S. Government, its’ agents, and employees from all responsibility for
  further aeromedical airlift services arising pursuant to the patient’s movement and any and all
  liability from resulting damages. The MCD also advises the patient, or their authorized
  representative, of any risks which may arise from the patient’s request for release from the
  AE system. These risks are annotated on the AF Form 3841. Patients requesting release from
  the AE system should be advised that signing the AF 3841 does not prohibit the individual
  from receiving future AE services. NOTE: The individual's signature on the AF Form 3841
  indicates release of the AE system from responsibility and liability for the patient requesting
  release from the AE system.
  6.54.5. Refusal to sign the AF Form 3841 is annotated in the patient’s medical record.
  6.54.6. Ensure the patient is aware they may not be reimbursed for travel expenses if their
  orders require AE transportation.

                                            Chapter 7

                                    AIRCRAFT SECURITY

7.1. General. This chapter provides guidance on aircraft security and preventing and resisting
aircraft piracy (hijacking) of aircraft. AFI 13-207, Preventing and Resisting Aircraft Piracy
(Hijacking), AFI 31-101, The Air Force Installation Security Program, and specific MAJCOM
security publications contain additional guidance. Aircrews will not release information
concerning hijacking attempts or identify armed aircrew members or missions to the public.
7.2. Security. Aircraft security at non-United States military installations is the responsibility of
the controlling agency. See applicable AFI 11-2MDSV3 guidance.
7.3. Air Force Installation Security Program. The following security procedures will
implement AFI 31-101, The Air Force Installation Security Program, requirements for each
aircraft:
   7.3.1. The aircraft will be parked in an established restricted area and afforded protection via
   a roving patrol, a two-person Internal Security Response Team (ISRT), with immediate
   response not to exceed 3 minutes, and a two-person External Security Response Team,
   (ESRT) with response capability within 5 minutes.
   7.3.2. When no permanent or established restricted area parking space is available, establish
   a temporary restricted area consisting of a raised rope barrier, and post with restricted area
   signs. Provide a one-person mobile patrol, supported by a two-person ISRT capable of a
   5minute response. Portable security lighting will be provided during the hours of darkness if
   sufficient permanent lighting is not available.
   7.3.3. At non-United States military installations, the PIC determines the adequacy of local
   security capabilities to provide aircraft security commensurate with this chapter. If he or she
   determines security to be inadequate, the aircraft will depart to a station where adequate
   security is available.
   7.3.4. The security force must be made aware of all visits to the aircraft. The security force
   POC must be identified to the PIC.
   7.3.5. Security support is a continual requirement and is not negated by the presence of
   aircrew or ground crew members. Security force support terminates only after the aircraft
   doors are closed and the aircraft taxis.
   7.3.6. Locking and Sealing. Lock or seal the aircraft during a “Remain over night” (RON)
   on non-secure ramps (see paragraph 7.5.1.).
7.4. Standby Aircraft Security. Ensure aircraft hatches and doors are secured to show
unauthorized entry; seal the crew entrance door with a lock box, or other controllable device,
which will prevent entry without damaging the door or lock. The PIC shall notify the C2 agency
the aircraft is sealed and provide them a means to access the aircraft in an emergency. Annotate
the forms with the time the aircraft was sealed. The C2 Senior Controller may grant access to a
sealed aircraft, shall document time of entry and ensure it remains launch capable. The PIC or
designated representative must be present if access to the aircraft is required and will ensure the
aircraft is resealed. The aircrew pre-flight portion will remain valid if performed by one aircrew,
AFI11-2AEV3_433AWSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2013                                                             61


sealed, and flown by another aircrew. NOTE: WG/CCs should develop local procedures for
documentation and management IAW TO 00-20-1 and MAJCOM Supplement.
7.5. En Route Security. The planning agency must coordinate with the execution agency to
ensure adequate en route security is available. The PIC will receive a threat assessment and en
route security capability evaluation briefing for areas of intended operation prior to home station
departure and should request updates from en route C2 as required. If required, a PHOENIX
RAVEN team will be assigned to the mission.
   7.5.1. The PHOENIX RAVEN team will consist of three US Air Force security force
   members, but may include more depending on security requirements. The team's travel
   status is determined by MAJCOM. The team travels in MEP status and is responsible to the
   PIC at all times. In turn, the PIC is responsible for its welfare (transportation, lodging, etc.).
   Ensure security team members receive a mission briefing, aircraft egress/passenger briefing
   (as appropriate).
   7.5.2. Arrival. On arrival, the PIC will assess the local situation and take the following
   actions as required:
       7.5.2.1. Area patrol. Request area security patrols from local security forces. If local
       authorities request payment for this service, use AF Form 15.
       7.5.2.2. Aircrew surveillance. During short ground times, direct armed crew members to
       remain with the aircraft and maintain surveillance of aircraft entrances and activities in
       the aircraft vicinity.
       7.5.2.3. Inadequate Security. If, in the opinion of the PIC, airfield security is inadequate
       and the PIC determines the safety of the aircraft is in question, the PIC may waive the
       FDP limits and crew rest requirements and depart as soon as possible for a base
       considered reliable. Report movement and intentions to the controlling agency as soon as
       practical. If a departure is not possible, the aircrew must secure the aircraft to the best of
       their ability. In no case, will the entire crew leave the aircraft unattended. Crew rest
       requirements will be subordinate to aircraft security when the airframe may be at risk.
       The PIC should rotate a security detail among the crew to provide for both aircraft
       protection and crew rest until relief is available. Request security assistance from the
       nearest DoD installation, US Embassy, local military or law enforcement agencies as
       appropriate.
   7.5.3. Entry Control Procedures. Unescorted entry is granted to aircrew members and
   support personnel assigned to the mission who possess their home station AF Form 1199, Air
   Force Entry Control Card, supported by an Entry Access List (EAL) or aircrew orders.
   Aircrew members and assigned crew chiefs are authorized escort authority.
       7.5.3.1. Normally, non-United States nationals, such as cargo handlers, can perform their
       duties under escort and should not be placed on the EAL.
       7.5.3.2. Personnel not on the EAL or aircrew orders must be escorted within the area.
7.6. Detecting Unauthorized Entry.
   7.6.1. When parking on a secure ramp, the aircraft will normally be left unlocked/unsealed
   to allow ground personnel immediate access. If, in the PIC’s judgment, the aircraft needs to
   be locked and sealed in order to detect unauthorized entry, then:
 62                                          AFI11-2AEV3_433AWSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2013


      7.6.1.1. Use available aircraft ground security locking devices.
      7.6.1.2. Secure the doors in a manner that will indicate unauthorized entry (e.g., tape
      inside of doors to airframe so that entry pulls tape loose).
      7.6.1.3. Close and seal the crew entrance door (box car seal).
      7.6.1.4. Wipe the immediate area around lock and latches clean to aid in investigation of
      a forced entry.
      7.6.1.5. Report any unauthorized entry or tampering to the Office of Special
      Investigation (OSI), security forces or local authorities, and the C2 agency. Have aircraft
      thoroughly inspected prior to flight.
   7.6.2. Security awareness is crucial to effective mission accomplishment. Aircrews must
   always remain vigilant to their surroundings, especially at high threat, low security locations.
   In addition to normal preflight activities, aircrews must inspect areas of the aircraft not
   covered by normal preflight duties, to include: inside main landing gear pods, and
   crew/troop O2 service panels, for personnel or other unfamiliar devices. Report any
   suspicious items to host security forces. Aircrews will maintain a heightened security
   posture throughout all pre-takeoff activities.
7.7. Preventing and Resisting Hijacking.
   7.7.1. The Air Transportation Act of 1974 and the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as
   amended, vest the FAA Administrator with exclusive responsibility for the direction of law
   enforcement activity in aircraft hijacking situations involving all aircraft (civil and military)
   in-flight in the United States.
   7.7.2. In taking action during an aircraft hijacking situation, military forces will act under
   military command within the scope of their duties.
   7.7.3. In the event an aircraft involved in an aircraft hijacking situation is carrying
   documents, equipment, or material that DoD has determined to be highly sensitive, or
   weapons of mass destruction, DoD will provide FAA, and where appropriate, the Federal
   Bureau of Investigation (FBI) with all pertinent information. Where possible, the FAA will
   consult and cooperate with DoD prior to directing any law enforcement activity.
   7.7.4. An aircraft is most vulnerable to hijacking when the aircrew is aboard and the aircraft
   is operationally ready for flight.
   7.7.5. A concerted effort must be made to prevent the hijacking of military or military
   contract aircraft by detecting potential hijackers before they board the aircraft.
   7.7.6. Should preventive efforts fail, any actual attempt to hijack a military aircraft must be
   resisted in a manner appropriate to the situation.
   7.7.7. Since air piracy may be committed by political terrorists or by individuals to whom
   the threat of death is not a deterrent but a stimulus, ordinary law enforcement procedures may
   be ineffective. Thus, successful conclusion of a hijacking situation and apprehension of the
   hijackers may require use of specialized law enforcement techniques and procedures.
   7.7.8. Delaying actions have been most successful in overcoming hijackings without loss of
   life or property.
AFI11-2AEV3_433AWSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2013                                                               63


   7.7.9. In the case of an aircraft carrying passengers, the primary concern is the safety of the
   passengers.
   7.7.10. Assistance to hijacked civil or military contract aircraft will be rendered as requested
   by the pilot in command of the aircraft and the authority exercising operational control of the
   anti-hijacking effort.
7.8. Preventive Measures. Commanders at all levels must ensure preventive measures are
taken to minimize access to the aircraft by potential hijackers.
   7.8.1. Preventive measures include the following: The host station passenger processing or
   manifesting facility should conduct anti-hijacking inspections. Do not board passengers until
   the PIC is fully satisfied with inspection results. In the absence of qualified passenger
   service representatives, the PIC will ensure the anti-hijacking inspection of passengers and
   baggage is accomplished.
      7.8.1.1. The Transportation Security Administration provides the latest guidance on
      passenger screening and carry on allowances. The latest guidance can be downloaded
      from www.tsa.gov/press/happenings/index.shtm.
          7.8.1.1.1. Aircrew must ensure that thorough screenings are accomplished when
          processing passengers at locations without an AMC Passenger Terminal.
          7.8.1.1.2. Carry-on restrictions apply to all passengers required to process through
          the passenger terminal, or equivalent when at a non-AMC location. Carry-on
          restrictions do not apply to those not required to process through the passenger
          terminal, or equivalent when at a non-AMC locations. This includes:
              7.8.1.1.2.1. Aircrew members listed on the Flight Authorization for that mission.
              7.8.1.1.2.2. MEPs for that mission.
              7.8.1.1.2.3. OSA/VIPSAM passenger not required to process through the
              Passenger Terminal (primary DV, spouses/party, aides, and security details only).
              7.8.1.1.2.4. Duty passengers on ANG/AFRC mission numbers.
          7.8.1.1.3. Consider baggage contained in areas not readily accessible in flight as
          checked baggage, even if carried to the aircraft by the passengers. This includes, but
          is not limited to: segregated baggage compartments, floor loaded baggage tied down
          with cargo straps/chains, palletized baggage, baggage in baggage bins, and baggage
          in the aft baggage compartment of C-21.
          7.8.1.1.4. Brief non-exempt passengers that baggage in these areas is not to be
          accessed in flight. If any non-exempt passenger attempts to access checked baggage
          in-flight, land the aircraft at the nearest suitable airport (preferably a military facility)
          with appropriate law enforcement personnel. Request assistance in removing the
          passenger(s) and accompanying baggage from the aircraft. Comply with all law
          enforcement direction.
   7.8.2. Medical facility commanders are responsible for anti-hijacking inspection of patients.
   When patients are delivered to the aircraft by civilian sources, the aircrew will perform
   required inspections prior to loading.
 64                                            AFI11-2AEV3_433AWSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2013


         7.8.2.1. For aeromedical evacuation (AE) missions, the Medical Crew Director (MCD) is
         the final authority for determining what items can be carried by/for AE patients.
   7.8.3. During exercises or contingencies in support of combat operations involving the
   movement of large groups of personnel, the unit being supported should manifest passengers
   and perform anti-hijacking inspections.
   7.8.4. Passengers will not carry weapons or ammunition on their person or in hand-carried
   baggage aboard an aircraft. EXECPTION: Special agents, guards of the Secret Service or
   State Department, RAVEN Team Members, and other individuals specifically authorized to
   carry weapons.
         7.8.4.1. Troops or deadhead crewmembers will not retain custody of ammunition on an
         aircraft. They will turn it in to the troop commander or PIC. Troops may carry unloaded
         weapons and ammunition aboard the aircraft during combat operations. When the
         tactical situation dictates (in coordination with the aircrew), weapons may be loaded at
         the order of the troop commander or team leader.
         7.8.4.2. Dummy clips that can be easily identified may be loaded for training at the order
         of the team leader in coordination with the aircrew.
         7.8.4.3. RAVENs will only be armed in-flight on specifically designated missions
         identified on the mission “frag” as “RAVEN in-flight arming required.”
      7.8.5. If weapons must be cleared, instruct the individual(s) to:
         7.8.5.1. Move to a safe, clear area at least 50 feet from any aircraft, equipment, or
         personnel before un-holstering or un-slinging their weapons.
         7.8.5.2. Clear weapons in accordance with standard safety procedures.              Ensure
         troop/aircraft commander retains ammunition IAW paragraph 7.8.4.1.
7.9. Initial Response. When an act of air piracy involves an Air Force installation or aircraft
within the United States, response will be according to the following guidelines until such time
as FAA assumes active direction of anti-hijacking efforts. Resist all attempts to hijack a military
aircraft. Resistance may vary from simple dissuasion, through deception and subterfuge, to
direct physical confrontation, including the prudent use of weapons.
   7.9.1. The following guidelines should be used to counter a hijacking, actual or threatened,
   while the aircraft is on the ground:
         7.9.1.1. Delay movement of the aircraft to provide time for ground personnel and the
         aircrew to establish communication and execute coordinated resistance actions.
         7.9.1.2. The authority for determining when ground resistance will be discontinued is
         vested in the highest available level of command. When adequate communication cannot
         be established, or when time does not permit, this authority is delegated in the following
         order:
             7.9.1.2.1. MAJCOM commander exercising operational control of the aircraft.
             7.9.1.2.2. MAJCOM commanders in whose AOR the airfield lies.
             7.9.1.2.3. Senior operational commander on scene.
AFI11-2AEV3_433AWSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2013                                                           65


           7.9.1.2.4. PIC in compliance with MAJCOM directives.
   7.9.2. A hijacked aircraft carrying weapons of mass destruction will not be allowed to
   takeoff. Refer to DoD 5210.41M, paragraph 9B (3), for additional guidance.
7.10. In-Flight Resistance. After airborne, success in thwarting a hijacking depends on the
resourcefulness of the aircrew. Many variables of a hijacking preclude use of any specific
counter-hijacking procedure. Some key factors should be evaluated before deciding a course of
action to be taken, including the nature of the threat, danger to life or crippling damage to the
aircraft in-flight, destination indicated by the hijacker, and the presence of sensitive material
onboard. Some counter-hijacking actions the aircrew may consider are:
   7.10.1. Engage the hijacker(s) in conversation in an attempt to calm them and to evaluate
   what course of action might be effective.
   7.10.2. Dissuade the hijacker.
   7.10.3. Use facts or subterfuge to convince the hijacker intermediate stops are necessary.
   7.10.4. Propose more favorable alternatives, such as landing in a neutral, rather than a
   hostile, country.
   7.10.5. Exploit any reasonable opportunity to incapacitate or overcome the hijacker
   physically, including the prudent use of firearms.
7.11. Communications Between Aircrew and Ground Agencies. Crews facing a hijacking
threat will transmit an in-the-clear notification of hijacking to ATC. Notify ground as soon as
practical and follow-up with situation reports as circumstances permit. Covert signals are no
longer to be used as per FAA guidance.
7.12. Not Used.
7.13. Arming of Crew Members. When crews are directed to carry weapons, at least one flight
engineer and one loadmaster will be armed. All crew members should know who is armed. The
following procedures apply when arming is directed:
   7.13.1. Weapons Issue. Before departing home station, obtain weapons, ammunition, box,
   lock and key. Crew members will be armed according to AFI 31-207, Arming and Use of
   Force by Air Force Personnel and MAJCOM publications. If an armed crew member must
   leave the crew en route, transfer the weapon to another authorized crew member using AF
   Form 1297.
   7.13.2. Wearing of Weapons. Wear weapons in a holster, concealed at all times to prevent
   identifying armed crew members. Do not wear weapons off the flight line except to and
   from the C2, armories, and other facilities associated with aircrew activities. Refer to the
   OPORD/SPINS for theater specific guidance and procedures.
       7.13.2.1. AMC Passenger Terminal Procedures. Armed crewmembers must discreetly
       identify themselves to AMC passenger service personnel upon arrival at security
       checkpoints. One crewmember will present a valid set of crew orders, military
       identification card, and AF Form 523, USAF Authorization to Bear Firearms, authorizing
       the carrying of concealed weapons. Once terminal personnel verify this, they will allow
       the crewmember to vouch for the remaining crewmembers. The entire crew will then

       proceed through the magnetometer without removing objects from their pockets. This
       will prevent passengers from determining which crewmembers are armed.
   7.13.3. Weapons Storage In-Flight. Crew members will be armed before beginning preflight,
   on-load or off-load duties and until completion of all post-flight duties. When no passengers
   are aboard, weapons may be stored in the gun box in-flight after a satisfactory stowaway
   check. Crew members will rearm before landing. Weapons need not be unloaded before
   placing them in a gun box.
   7.13.4. Weapons Storage on the Ground.
       7.13.4.1. Aircrews, including stage crews, will store weapons and ammunition in the
       most secure facility available, normally the base armory.
       7.13.4.2. Non-stage aircrews may store weapons and ammunition in the aircraft gun box.
   7.13.5. When storing weapons in the gun box:
       7.13.5.1. Weapons should normally not be unloaded.
       7.13.5.2. Inform C2 which crew member has the gun box key.
   7.13.6. Crew members will ensure they are reissued the same weapon until mission
   termination at home station.
   7.13.7. Loading and Transfer of Weapons. Load and unload weapons at approved clearing
   barrels if available. Do not use a hand-to-hand transfer of loaded weapons to another crew
   member; place the weapon on a flat surface.
7.14. Force Protection. Crews must be alert to possibility of terrorist activities at all times.

9.2. Aeromedical Readiness Mission (ARM) Equipment Requirements. Aeromedical
Readiness Missions (ARMs) are the primary means of preparing for AE airlift. These missions
can be diverted to fulfill “real” versus “simulated” patient airlift requirements, therefore, all
medical equipment/kits will be kept operationally ready at all times. In addition to items listed in
Table 4.1, the ventilator will also be carried.
   9.2.1. For ARMs, controlled medications are optional at the discretion of the Chief Nurse.
9.3. Contingency Exercise Training Mission (CETM). A training mission conducted during a
Wing/MAJCOM/DOD sponsored exercise, JRTC, AECOT, or IG Inspection. Crew compliment
is based on scenario requirements and Table 3.1 All crewmembers will be current and qualified.
Upgrade training/evaluations are prohibited on CETM flights. A trained MCC is not required for
the mission. AECMs can only take credit for specific events identified in AFI 11-2AE V1,
Aeromedical Evacuation Aircrew Training. A CETM mission has no required flight time.

      AIRCREW OPERATIONS IN CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL,
        NUCLEAR, AND HIGH-YIELD EXPLOSIVE THREAT ENVIRONMENT

10.1. Overview. The proliferation of Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN)
weapons and the means to deliver them present serious security threats to the global operations
of air mobility forces. This chapter describes the CBRN threat, passive defense measures to
mitigate that threat, and guidance for ground and flight operations in a contaminated
environment.
   10.1.1. It is United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) policy that patients
   personnel, or casualties with known or suspected contamination from chemical, biological, or
   nuclear warfare agents will not be transported within the aeromedical patient movement
   system. Decontamination must be performed prior to transport to prevent the potential
   spread of contamination. In rare cases, transport may be essential to preserve life or continue
   critical missions. If such transport is deemed essential, all efforts must be made to prevent
   the spread of contamination. In these cases, prior approval must be given by the involved
   geographic combatant commanders, Commander USTRANSCOM, and the Secretary of
   Defense (SECDEF) in consultation with Department of Defense medical authorities.
   10.1.2. Patients with known or suspected or highly contagious disease will not be
   transported within the patient movement system. These include infections with any agent
   that may pose a potential threat to national security, require special public health actions,
   and/or have the potential to cause public panic and social disruption. Patients known or
   suspected to be infected with a highly contagious disease should be treated “in place” or with
   minimal transportation to medical authorities. In extreme circumstances there may be a
   requirement to move index cases (approximately two) for evaluation or critical medical care.
   If patient movement is required, prior approval must be given by the involved geographic
   combatant commanders, Commander USTRANSCOM, and SECDEF in consultation with
   medical authorities.
   10.1.3. AMC will train and equip Aeromedical evacuation crews and stage required
   equipment at key hubs to carry out these limited missions for movement of contaminated and
   contagious patients.
10.2. Understanding the CBRN Threat.
   10.2.1. Chemical Weapons. Militarily significant chemical weapons include nerve, blister,
   choking, and blood agents. A key point for aircrew members to remember is that time is on
   your side. The ultra-violet (UV) rays of the sun, high temperatures, and high absorption rates
   of chemicals all decrease their lethality. Most chemical agents will either evaporate or
   absorb into surfaces. For decontamination, cleaning with hot soap and water and/or a 5
   percent bleach solution currently appears to be the best and most practical method of
   removing chemical agents that may remain as a contact hazard on glass, and unpainted metal.
   Currently, the only decontaminate authorized for use on aircraft is soap and water. NOTE:
   Recent tests indicate that as a decontaminated aircraft dries, the absorbed chemical warfare
   agent (CWA) may resurface from painted surfaces causing contact and vapor hazards.
AFI11-2AEV3_433AWSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2013                                                             71


   10.2.2. Biological Weapons. Biological warfare agents (BWA) are normally divided into
   three areas: bacteria (i.e., Anthrax) that live outside the cell, reproduce, and are normally
   susceptible to antibiotics; toxins (i.e., Ricin), that are poisons produced by living organisms
   or plants; and viruses (i.e., Smallpox) that normally require the host of a living cell to survive
   and reproduce. Viruses and toxins do not respond to antibiotics. It is probable that the
   medical community would be the first to recognize that an upsurge in “flu-like symptoms” is
   actually a bio attack. Although BWA are degraded by UV rays, humidity and high/low
   temperatures, some BWA (i.e., Anthrax spores) may have a long life, lasting decades under
   the right conditions. Current immunizations and good personal hygiene help prevent
   infection.
   10.2.3. Radiological Weapons. The radiation dispersal device (RDD), or so-called “dirty
   bomb,” is the typical radiological weapon. RDD is any device that disseminates radioactive
   material without using a nuclear detonation. Key points to remember are that shielding and
   distance are the best defenses against radiation exposure.
   10.2.4. Nuclear Weapons. The threat from a nuclear device is from the initial blast, heat,
   and radiation. In addition, the Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) from a nuclear detonation can
   damage electronic equipment. The best protection is a combination of shielding, distance
   from the blast, and limited time of exposure.
10.3. CBRN Passive Defense Measures. Passive defense measures are those activities
conducted to negate, contain, and manage the effects of CBRN attack. Passive defense measures
include pre, trans, and post-attack actions designed to mitigate the CBRN threat through
contamination avoidance, protection, and contamination control.
   10.3.1. Contamination Avoidance. Contamination avoidance is the most important passive
   defense measure. Techniques for contamination avoidance include: in-flight diversion,
   survival launch, and minimizing exposure to contaminated cargo, aerospace ground
   equipment (AGE), and material handling equipment (MHE).
       10.3.1.1. In-flight Diversion. When advised that a destination airfield is under CBRN
       attack or has been contaminated, the aircrew will divert to an uncontaminated airfield, if
       at all possible. Authority to land at a contaminated airfield will be specified in the
       controlling OPORD.
       10.3.1.2. Survival Launch. If caught on the ground during attack warning, every
       reasonable effort will be made to launch to avoid the attack. Upon proper clearances,
       aircrew may launch to survive if they have sufficient fuel and unrestricted, safe access to
       the runway. In practice, this option may only be practical for aircraft that have just
       landed or aircraft at or near the end of the runway. If launch is not possible, shut down
       engines and avoid running environmental control systems.                   Close aircraft
       doors/hatches/ramps, don Individual Protective Equipment (IPE), and seek personal
       protective cover on the base. If time does not permit using base facilities, remain in the
       sealed aircraft for a minimum of one-hour after the attack and/or follow host-base
       guidance.
       10.3.1.3. Avoiding Cross Contamination from AGE, MHE, and Cargo. All formerly
       contaminated equipment and cargo must be marked to facilitate contamination avoidance
       and the use of protective measures. Additionally, the air shipment of formerly
72                                         AFI11-2AEV3_433AWSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2013


     contaminated cargo requires special precautions and must be specifically authorized by
     the senior transportation commander.
  10.3.2. Protection. When exposure to chemical and/or biological agents cannot be avoided,
  protection provides the force with the ability to survive and operate in a CBRN environment.
  Protection is afforded by individual protective equipment, collective protection, and
  hardening of facilities.
     10.3.2.1. Individual Protective Equipment. The current in-flight protective gear for
     aircrew members is the Aircrew Chemical Defense Ensemble (ACDE). The ACDE
     includes the CWU-66/P or CWU-77/P Integrated Aircrew Chemical Coverall (IACC).
     The Ground Crew Ensemble (GCE) consists of the protective mask, C2 series canister (or
     filter element for MCU-2A/P protective mask), and over garment, boots, and gloves. The
     ACDE and GCE provide protection against chemical and biological agents. They do not
     provide blast or radiation protection from an RDD or nuclear detonation. The ACDE
     requires care during donning using "buddy dressing" procedures and Aircrew Flight
     Equipment (AFE) expertise during processing through the Aircrew Contamination
     Control Area (ACCA). (NOTE: AECMs will utilize the MCU-2A series mask).
         10.3.2.1.1. ACDE/GCE Issue. Aircrews will be issued sized ACDE and GCE at
         home station. Aircrews will ensure their ACDE and GCE are available at all times
         while in a CBRN threat area. Aircrew members will confirm the mobility bag
         contents and correct sizes.
         10.3.2.1.2. ACDE Wear During Ground Operations. Because aircraft contamination
         is unlikely to occur during flight, ground operations can represent the highest threat to
         aircrew safety. Protection from enemy attacks and exposure to liquid chemical agents
         is paramount. Aircrew should limit activities to essential duties only, and separate
         ground duties from air duties.
     10.3.2.2. Collective Protection. Collective protection provides a temperature-controlled,
     contamination-free environment to allow personnel relief from continuous wear of IPE
     such as the ACDE. The basic concept for most facility collective protective solutions is
     to employ overpressure, filtration, and controlled entry/exit. The intent is to provide rest
     and relief accommodations, as well as provide medical treatment in contamination free
     zone. All pressurization systems should be shut down and doors sealed if the crew finds
     itself in need of immediate protection. Crewmembers should avail themselves of
     facilities, if provided, on the airfield.
     10.3.2.3. Hardening. Permanent and expedient hardening measures are used to
     strengthen buildings and utility systems or provide barriers to resist blast effects. To
     reduce the potential of vapor exposure, personnel should consider the use of facilities
     above the first floor.
  10.3.3. Contamination Control. In the post-attack environment, contamination control
  measures limit the spread of chemical, biological, and radiological contamination through
  disease prevention measures, decontamination, and use of Exchange Zone (EZ) operations.
  Effective contamination control helps sustain air mobility operations by minimizing
  performance degradation, casualties, or loss of material.
AFI11-2AEV3_433AWSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2013                                                            73


      10.3.3.1. Disease Prevention. Up-to-date immunizations, standard personal hygiene
      practices, and the use of chemoprophylaxis are effective biological warfare defensive
      measures.
      10.3.3.2. Decontamination.
          10.3.3.2.1. In-flight Decontamination.           Air washing is a useful in-flight
          decontamination technique for removing most of the liquid agent from aircraft metal
          surfaces. However, vapor hazards may remain in areas where the airflow
          characteristics prevent complete off-gassing (i.e., wheel wells, flap wells, rivet and
          screw heads, joints, etc.). Flights of at least 2 to 4 hours are recommended, and lower
          altitudes are more effective than higher altitudes. Fly with the aircraft configured
          (gear, flaps, and slats extended) as long as possible to maximize the airflow in and
          around as many places as possible. Be advised that exterior contamination may seep
          into the aircraft interior creating a vapor hazard for aircrews. Use of ACDE is
          recommended.
          10.3.3.2.2. Limits of Decontamination. Complete decontamination of aircraft and
          equipment may be difficult, if not impossible, to achieve. Formerly contaminated
          assets will be restricted to DOD-controlled airfields and not released from US
          government control.
      10.3.3.3. Exchange Zone (EZ) Operations. The AMC Concept for Air Mobility
      Operations in a Chemical and Biological Environment (CB CONOPS) describes a
      method for continuing the vital flow of personnel into a contaminated airfield while
      limiting the number of air mobility aircraft and personnel exposed to the contaminated
      environment. The purpose of the EZ is to minimize the spread of contamination within
      the air mobility fleet, preserving as many aircraft as possible for unrestricted international
      flight. The EZ is an area (located at uncontaminated airfield) set aside to facilitate the
      exchange of uncontaminated (clean) cargo/passengers to a contaminated (dirty) airframe,
      or vice versa, without cross-contamination. Additional information on the EZ is available
      through HQ AMC/A3X.
10.4. Flight Operations.
   10.4.1. Mission Planning. Aircrews must be mentally prepared to face the dangers of CBRN
   weapons. Flight/mission planning must be thorough. Aircraft commanders should
   emphasize ACDE wear, crew coordination, CBRN hazards and countermeasures, in-flight
   diversion, plans for onload/offload in the event of a ground attack, and plans for the return
   leg in the event of aircraft contamination. Alternative scenario plans should also be
   considered in the event MOPP conditions change.
   10.4.2. Establishing the Threat Level. Aircrews should monitor command and control
   channels to ensure they receive the latest information concerning the destination's alert
   condition. Diversion of aircraft to alternate "clean" locations may be required, unless
   operational necessity otherwise dictates. The 618 TACC or theater C2 agency (normally
   through the controlling OPORD) will direct aircrew pre-exposure activities such as medical
   pre-treatment for chemical/biological exposure.
   10.4.3. Fuel Requirements. Extra fuel may be needed to compensate for altitude restrictions
   as the result of CB agent exposure. During purge periods, the aircraft will be unpressurized.
 74                                          AFI11-2AEV3_433AWSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2013


   Although the aircrew can use the aircraft oxygen systems, passengers wearing GCE cannot,
   thus restricting the aircraft cruise altitude and increasing fuel requirements accordingly.
   10.4.4. Oxygen Requirements. Operating a contaminated aircraft will increase oxygen
   requirements. Aircrew wear of ACDE will require use of the aircraft oxygen system to
   counter actual/suspected contamination. Using the 100 percent oxygen setting offers the
   greatest protection in a contaminated environment. Appropriate oxygen reservoir levels must
   be planned to meet higher consumption rates. Use the aircraft Dash 1 charts to calculate the
   required reservoir levels.
   10.4.5. Donning Equipment. Aircrew will don ACDE based on the alarm condition IAW
   AFMAN 10-100, Airman’s Manual. Use the "buddy dressing" procedures, and refer to
   AMCVA 11-303, AERP Donning Checklist and AMCVA 11-304, ACDE Donning Checklist,
   to ensure proper wear. When wearing the ACDE, Atropine and 2 PAM Chloride auto
   injectors will be kept in the upper left ACDE pocket. If the integrated survival vest/body
   armor is worn, the Atropine and 2 PAM Chloride auto injectors may be kept in the lower
   right flight suit pocket. This standardized location will enable personnel to locate the
   medication should an individual be overcome by CWA poisoning. M-9 paper on the flight
   suit will facilitate detection of liquid chemical agents and ACCA processing. M-9 paper
   should be placed on the flight suit prior to entering the CBRN threat area or when an alarm
   “yellow” or higher has been declared. When inbound to a CBRN threat area, prior to
   descent, the aircraft commander will ensure crew and passengers don appropriate protective
   equipment IAW arrival destination's MOPP level and brief aircrew operations in the CBRN
   threat area. As a minimum, this briefing will include: flight deck isolation, oxygen
   requirements, air conditioning system requirements, IPE requirements, ground operations,
   and MOPP levels. Aircrew members must determine if the wear of the integrated survival
   vest/body armor and LPUs will restrict dexterity and mobility to the point that it becomes a
   safety issue. If the aircrew deems the equipment to create a safety of flight concern, then the
   items may be pre-positioned (instead of worn) on the aircraft to be readily available to the
   aircrew.
   10.4.6. Communicating Down-line Support. Pass aircraft and cargo contamination
   information through command and control channels when inbound. This information will be
   used to determine if a diversion flight is required or decontamination teams are needed.
   Report the physical condition of any crew/passengers who are showing agent symptoms and
   whether they are wearing chemical defense ensembles.
10.5. Ground Operations.
   10.5.1. Crew Rest Procedures. Operational necessity may require the aircrew to rest/fly in a
   contaminated environment. If the mission is not being staged by another aircrew or pre-
   flight crews are not available, the aircrew may pre-flight, load, and secure the aircraft prior to
   entering crew rest. The departing aircrew will perform necessary crew preparations and pre-
   flight briefings. Then, they will report to the ACCA for processing and ACDE donning with
   assistance from AFE personnel. If possible, aircrew transport should be provided in a
   covered vehicle. Aircrews should avoid pre-flighting the aircraft prior to departure to
   prevent contamination spread to them and/or the aircraft. As aircrews proceed to fly, they
   will require assistance from ground support personnel in removing their aircrew protective
   overcape and overboots prior to entering the aircraft.
AFI11-2AEV3_433AWSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2013                                                          75


  10.5.2. Onload and Offload Considerations. Extreme care must be exercised to prevent
  contamination spread to the aircraft interior during ground operations, particularly to the
  flight deck area. Reduce the number of personnel entering the aircraft. Contaminated engine
  covers, safety pins and chocks will not be placed in the aircraft unless sealed in clean plastic
  bags. Aircrew members entering the aircraft will remove plastic overboots and overcape
  portions of the aircrew ensemble and ensure flight/mobility bags are free of contaminants and
  placed in clean plastic bags. Prior to entering the aircraft all personnel should implement
  boot wash/decontamination procedures. Aircrew exiting aircraft into a contaminated
  environment will don plastic overboots and overcape prior to leaving the aircraft.
  10.5.3. Communications. Conducting on/offloading operations, while wearing the complete
  ACDE, complicates communications capability. Use the mini-amplifier/speaker or the
  aircraft public address system and augment with flashlight and hand signals, as required.
  10.5.4. Airlift of Retrograde Cargo. Only CRITICAL retrograde cargo will be moved from
  a contaminated to an uncontaminated airbase. Critical requirements are pre-designated in
  theater war plans. Onload cargo will be protected prior to and while being transported to the
  aircraft. If contaminated, protective cover(s) will be removed/replaced just prior to placing
  the cargo on the aircraft. It is the user's responsibility to decontaminate cargo for air
  shipment. The airlift of contaminated or formerly contaminated cargo requires the approval
  of the senior transportation commander.
  10.5.5. Passenger/Patients. A path should be decontaminated between the aircraft and the
  ground transportation vehicle to reduce interior contamination when loading/unloading
  passengers/patients. Normally, externally contaminated patients and those infected with
  contagious biological agents will not be transported onboard AMC or AMC-procured
  aircraft. The AMC/CC is the waiver authority to this policy. (NOTE: An altitude below
  10,000 feet is recommended due to AECM use of the ground chemical mask.)
  10.5.6. Physiological Factors. Aircraft commanders must be very sensitive to the problems
  resulting from physical exertion while wearing ACDE. The aircraft commander should
  consider factors such as ground time, temperature and remaining mission requirements when
  determining on/offload capabilities. Individuals involved should be closely monitored for
  adverse physiological effects.
  10.5.7. Work Degradation Factors. Work timetables need to be adjusted to minimize
  thermal stress caused by wearing the ACDE. Aircrews must weigh all factors when
  performing in-flight and ground duties. The following are degradation factors for wearing
  full GCE, and may also be used to represent the Task Time Multipliers for the ACDE. To
  estimate how much time it takes to perform a task or operation, (1) take the Task Time
  Multiplier (Figure 10-1) for the appropriate Work Rate and ambient air temperature and (2)
  multiply it by the time it normally takes to perform the task. For example, given a heavy
  work rate and an air temperature of 70F, the crewmember should expect a normal one hour
  task to take 2.1 hours while wearing ACDE. A more extensive discussion of this subject is
  found in AFMAN 32-4005, Personnel Protection and Attack Actions.

Figure 10.1. Task Time Multipliers.




   10.5.8. Outbound with Actual/Suspected Chemical Contamination. Once airborne with
   actual/suspected vapor contamination, the aircraft must be purged for 2 hours using Smoke
   and Fume Elimination procedures. To ensure no liquid contamination exists, a close
   inspection of aircrew, passenger ensembles, and cargo will be conducted using M-8 and M-9
   detection paper. Detection paper only detects certain liquid agents and will not detect vapor
   hazards. Above the shoulder ACDE should only be removed if there is absolutely no vapor
   hazard. Be advised that residual contamination (below the detectable levels of currently
   fielded detection equipment) may be harmful in an enclosed space. The aircrew must take
   every precaution to prevent spreading of liquid contaminants, especially on the flight deck
   area. The best course is to identify actual/suspected contamination, avoid those areas for the
   remainder of the flight, and keep the cargo compartments cool. If an aircrew member or
   passenger has been in contact with liquid contaminants, all personnel aboard the aircraft will
   stay in full ACDE/GCE until processed through their respective contamination control area
   (CCA). Upon arrival, the contaminated aircraft will be parked in an isolated area and
   cordoned to protect unsuspecting ground personnel.
   10.5.9. Documenting Aircraft Contamination. When it is suspected or known that an
   aerospace vehicle or piece of equipment has been contaminated with a radiological,
   biological or chemical contaminant, a Red X will be entered and an annotation will be made
   in historical records for the lifecycle of the equipment.
   10.5.10. 10-Foot Rule. The 10-foot rule was developed in order to provide guidance for
   protecting personnel using or handling contaminated resources (such as pallets) or working in
   locations with materials that might retain a residual chemical. The 10-foot rule embodies a
   safety factor that goes beyond current OSD guidance (which allows removal of IPE
   whenever detectors no longer detect a chemical agent vapor hazard). There are two phases
   associated with the 10-foot rule.
      10.5.10.1. Initial Phase. During the initial phase, personnel will remain in MOPP 4
      whenever they stay within 10 feet of the contaminated equipment for more than a few
      seconds. This MOPP level provides personnel the maximum protection from the
      chemical agent as it transitions from a contact and vapor hazard to a vapor hazard only.
      10.5.10.2. Follow-on Phase. In the follow-on phase, personnel will use gloves of a sort
      (i.e. leather, rubber, cloth, etc.) when operating on or handling the contaminated
      equipment. Although a contact hazard is unlikely, relatively small amounts of the agent
      may still be present. The use of gloves will ensure that unnecessary bare skin contact
      with agent residue is avoided.
AFI11-2AEV3_433AWSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2013                                                          77


      10.5.10.3. Figure 10-2 shows times associated with initial and follow-on phases of the
      10-foot rule. To simplify response processes, commanders may choose to use the worst
      case scenario as the foundation for all 10-foot rule actions, i.e., 24 hours for the initial
      phase and all periods of time greater than 24 hours for the follow-on phase.

FLIGHT NURSE AND AEROMEDICAL EVACUATION TECHNICIAN PROCEDURES

13.1. General. The primary duty of the FN and AET is to conduct AE operations. Primary
duties include mission planning, coordinating and supervising enplaning and deplaning of
patients and special medical equipment, and providing in-flight patient care and assistance to
patients. The FN and AET:
      13.1.1. Are specialists in nursing care of patients in a hypobaric environment.
   13.1.2. Have advanced training in the operation of specialized medical equipment designed
   and approved for use at altitude.
   13.1.3. Are trained and current in the aircraft systems and configurations required for safe
   AE operations.
   13.1.4. Provide in-flight assistance to medical attendants as situations dictate.
13.2. Mission Planning
   13.2.1. Aircraft seats identified in applicable T.O.s or AFI 11-2AE V3 Addenda A as ACM
   seats will not be used for patient passenger seating.
   13.2.2. The MCD may reserve get-down litters as mission needs dictate. For mission legs
   exceeding four hours in length; a minimum of two litters should be set up for ambulatory
   patient use. An emergency litter will be set up on all AE missions. When required/mission
   load permits, a minimum of one seat will be reserved for every three litter patients on all AE
   missions. EXCEPTION: An emergency litter is not required for ambulatory patient
   movement on C-21 missions.
   13.2.3. Patients and/or attendants will not be relocated to litters, in order to make seats
   available for passengers. Regardless of age, all patients and attendants will have their own
   assigned seat and will not be required to give up their seat for passengers. In-lap seating of
   patients and/or attendants to accommodate passengers is prohibited on AE missions.
   13.2.4. For planning purposes, critical care patients should have an entire tier to
   accommodate patient care and additional medical equipment. EXCEPTION: During
   contingency/humanitarian missions, maximize the aircraft capability for all litter patients
   13.2.5. A five (5) high configuration using the litter stanchions is approved for all C-130 AE
   missions.
   13.2.6. When cargo requirements permit, the seat and litter stanchion ladder will be installed
   for all C-130 AE missions.
   13.2.7. Ensure adequate space for in-flight treatment of litter patients. The vertical distance
   between each loaded litter will not be less than 21 inches (18 inches on C-130 when loading
   5-high). NOTE: When litter patients are wearing personal gear (i.e. web belts, canteen,
   helmets, flak vests, etc.), consider loading four (4) high versus five (5) high in the center seat
   and litter stanchions, to increase space between litters to accommodate gear. If situation
   requires/permits, remove personal gear from patients and secure on ramp or in a designated
   area.
AFI11-2AEV3_433AWSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2013                                                           81


   13.2.8. Available litter spaces and ambulatory seating will depend on the aircraft cabin’s
   mission configuration. (i.e. life support storage containers and tool box stowage).
   13.2.9. Patient/Cargo Mix.
       13.2.9.1. When transporting both cargo and litter patients, litters will be transported
       forward of the cargo pallets, if possible. No cargo will be transported with patients on the
       KC-135.
       13.2.9.2. If not possible, and the PIC and MCD agree, patients may be transported aft of
       the cargo. The LM must make every effort to stay in the vicinity of the crew and
       patients in-flight, and during critical phases of flight.
       13.2.9.3. Cargo will not be bumped except in very unusual/abnormal cases, and only
       after the PIC/MCD contacts 618 TACC or appropriate C2 agencies.
13.3. Preflight Duties.
   13.3.1. Ground support crew, consisting of at least one qualified AECM, may preflight the
   aircraft for an AE mission. It is the responsibility of the CMT to ensure the aircraft has been
   correctly configured/preflighted before accepting the aircraft for patient transport. A
   qualified AECM from the ground support crew will brief and conduct aircraft walk through
   with the CMT on completed abbreviated checklist items prior to the flight crew assuming
   responsibility.
   13.3.2. Roller conveyors will be removed from all aisle way, walkway, and AE litter patient
   positions.
       13.3.2.1. (C-17) On the ramp, roller conveyors will be stowed unless the baggage pallet
       or LSAS are in position. Before enplaning/deplaning procedures, the LSAS will be
       secured in the Aerial Delivery System (ADS) Rails in position 10. All rollers in position
       11 will be stowed. (C-130) Patient and crew safety will be evaluated prior to
       enplaning/deplaning of patients. If safety concerns exist and time permits, roller
       conveyors will be removed from the ramp. As mission dictates, rollers required to remain
       on the ramp during enplaning and deplaning will be positioned as close to the ramp edge
       as possible.
   13.3.3. If the aircraft is configured with airline seats, the CMT will check the security of all
   patient/passenger seats by lifting upward on the front of the seat frame and gently pushing
   and pulling on the seat backs. Minimal movement is acceptable.
   13.3.4. Oxygen and Electrical. Lines may be run together (parallel) throughout the aircraft
   cabin. Electrical outlets with electrical equipment plugged into them will not have an oxygen
   flow meter within 12 inches of that outlet. Do not secure any oxygen and/or electrical lines
   on the floor, across aisles or areas where they will be walked on. EXCEPTION: When
   patients are floor-loaded, oxygen and or electrical lines may be secured on the floor.
       13.3.4.1. Attach/secure oxygen and electrical lines to litter clamps, or secure with hook
       and pile type strapping, or on procured/developed equipment securing devices located in
       the in-flight kit. When securing oxygen and/or electrical lines in litter brackets, inspect
       the bracket for visible wear on the rubber pad of the bracket. If the bracket’s rubber pad
       is worn, pad the bracket with available material. Do not use tape. All brackets without
       rubber pads will be annotated on applicable AFTO IMT 781A, for turn-in to maintenance
 82                                           AFI11-2AEV3_433AWSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2013


      for repair or replacement. WARNING: The only acceptable options to run oxygen and
      electrical lines without the concurrence of the LM/BO is to utilize the stanchion poles,
      stanchion straps, C-17 fuselage or PSP securing devices. Crews must coordinate with the
      LM/BO prior to securing oxygen/electrical lines outside of these parameters. Lines
      looped over moving parts jeopardize the safety of the aircraft, medical equipment and
      crew.
      13.3.4.2. AECMs will wear gloves when making electrical connections, during
      configuration and patient loading to prevent personal injury.
      13.3.4.3. Equipment will not be plugged in until after the aircraft electrical system has
      been turned on.
      13.3.4.4. Electrical lines will be positioned/secured and a completed functional check of
      medical equipment performed on the aircraft prior to enplaning patients. EXCEPTION:
      May be modified as situation dictates for operational contingency/combat missions.
      13.3.4.5. Flight gloves will not be worn when handling oxygen equipment devices.
      Hands will be clean and free from oils, lotions, paints, grease, or similar materials.
      13.3.4.6. Oxygen lines will be secured prior to enplaning patients. EXCEPTION: For
      operational contingency/combat missions, oxygen lines will be secured prior to take-off.
      13.3.4.7. “Oxygen available” means oxygen can be made quickly available to the
      patients. Positioning of a flow meter, O2 adapter and unopened mask or nasal cannula
      somewhere in the vicinity of the patient, meets this requirement. NOTE: The AE crew is
      not required to have therapeutic oxygen immediately available for space available
      passengers.
13.4. Ground Operations. The CMT is responsible for all ground operations. The CMT, in
coordination with the LM/BO, is responsible for vehicle movement/positioning around the
aircraft. Refer to section 20.3. for vehicle operations.
   13.4.1. At locations where there is AE ground support, the CMT will coordinate
   enplaning/deplaning procedures with the ASF/CASF and LM/BO prior to
   enplaning/deplaning patients. At locations without AE ground support, the CMT will
   coordinate enplaning/deplaning procedures with the sending/receiving facility and LM/BO.
   NOTE: Medical facility support personnel on the aircraft will be kept at a minimum during
   ground operations prior to enplaning/deplaning. A maximum of 3 personnel from each
   facility can be utilized to brief/receive patient report.
   13.4.2. Patient Preparation for Enplane.
      13.4.2.1. The CMT will verify with the FN receiving report that anti-hijacking
      procedures were accomplished prior to enplaning. Perform anti-hijacking procedures if
      not accomplished.
      13.4.2.2. The CMT is responsible to brief mission expectations and assess all patients
      prior to enplaning.
      13.4.2.3. Identify patients requiring assistance. Litter patients may be enplaned/deplaned
      as ambulatory if in the professional judgment of the FN no contraindications exist (e.g.
      doctor’s order for bed rest, inability to climb stairs or walk long distances, etc.).
AFI11-2AEV3_433AWSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2013                                                              83


       13.4.2.4. Distribute hearing protection to all enplaning patients and attendants.
       13.4.2.5. The CMT will check litter patients for security to include approved litter, strap
       placement, and proper backrest placement prior to enplaning. However, all AECMs will
       monitor for safe litter strap placement. Ensure all patient personal items located on litter
       are secured prior to patient movement.
       13.4.2.6. Ensure that all ambulatory patient personal belongings, to include medications
       if self-medicating, are in their possession. NOTE: Patients/passengers may be allowed to
       use canes, crutches, or walkers for enplaning at the discretion of the MCD/FN.
   13.4.3. Patient Preparation for Deplane:
       13.4.3.1. The 2AET will check litter patients for security to include litter strap and
       backrest placement prior to deplaning. AECM’s will ensure all equipment used on the
       patient is disconnected from aircraft systems. All patient medical devices and personal
       items located on the litter will be secured prior to patient movement.
       13.4.3.2. Ensure that all ambulatory patient personal belongings, to include medications
       if self-medicating, hand carried bags, and medical supplies are in their possession.
       NOTE: Patients/passengers may be allowed to use canes, crutches, or walkers for
       deplaning at the discretion of the MCD/FN.
       13.4.3.3. Soiled linen and sharps containers are collected for removal from the aircraft.
       13.4.3.4. All contaminated items are collected, bagged, and labeled for removal from the
       aircraft as specified in AFI 41-307, Aeromedical Evacuation Patient Considerations and
       Standards of Care.
13.5. Transfer of Patient Care. In the AE system, transfer of patient care occurs between AE
representatives of the MTF, AE staging facilities, or external agencies to/from the AEC.
Transfer of physical care is complete once the patient enters or exits the ground vehicle of
transportation. NOTE: Enplaning/deplaning during patient report is highly encouraged. Final
approval is at the discretion of the MCD.
   13.5.1. Transfer of care will be to a comparable or higher level of care capability. Time will
   be allotted for the ground healthcare provider and AECM to have an opportunity to ask and
   respond to questions as needed. A verbal report will include, but is not limited to:
       13.5.1.1. Patient’s current condition, ongoing treatment, recent changes in condition, and
       any possible changes or complications to watch out for while the patient is in the AE
       system.
       13.5.1.2. The type and amount of IV fluids/medication ordered and/or received, current
       settings of medical devices including PCA pumps, and total intake & output for the
       mission.
       13.5.1.3. AECM’s will ensure the AF Form 3899, Patient Movement Record series is
       complete and supports transfer of care communications between the AEC and the AE
       representative.
NOTE: Enlisted personnel may only take control of narcotics, or other controlled medications if
they have been trained and appointed by the MTF commander.
 84                                           AFI11-2AEV3_433AWSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2013


NOTE: If any patient condition is questionable or exceeds the capabilities of the AEC, notify
the MCD. The MCD may refuse a patient for AE transport if the patient’s behavior is
determined to be detrimental to self and others, the patient has not been adequately prepared for
AE movement, or medical/therapeutic interventions are ineffective. Document on AF Forms
3829/3830/3899 or DD Form 602 information related to refusal of patient. Notify 618
TACC/AOC or PMRC at time of refusal.
   13.5.2. Medical attendants will accompany patients to the destination medical facility. FNs
   must exercise good judgment in determining the need for an AECM to accompany patients to
   the destination medical facility. NOTE: This will extend CDT.
   13.5.3. At scheduled RON stations, when an ASF/ASTS/MTF nurse is not available to
   receive report on the flight line, an AECM is responsible for accompanying patients to the
   facility if the patient’s medical condition warrants clinical observation during transport.
   13.5.4. All female litter psychiatric patients should be provided with a female attendant
   during movement between the aircraft and the destination facility. If accompanied by a
   responsible adult female, attendant, another non-psychiatric female patient, or military
   sponsor, there is no need for an additional attendant to escort the patient.
13.6. Enplaning/Deplaning Procedures. The MCD and CMT have direct and final authority
over all patient enplaning and deplaning activities. AECMs are responsible to oversee all
activities involved with patients in and around the aircraft.
   13.6.1. During enplaning/deplaning of patients, the MCD or designated AECM will control
   operations from the aircraft ramp. Position on the ramp is at the discretion of the AECM.
   NOTE: On the ramp, only wireless headsets are approved during enplaning/deplaning
   operations.
       13.6.1.1. All aircrafts should have engines shut down during enplaning and deplaning of
       patients unless conducting ERO procedures IAW section 13.6.7. Safe, smooth enplaning
       activities depend on the coordinated efforts of the AECMs and the MTF. Consideration
       of climate conditions, ground support capability to include manpower and vehicular
       support, all play a role in safe operations.
       13.6.1.2. Keep ambulatory patients grouped together.
       13.6.1.3. Patients will not walk under aircraft wings.
       13.6.1.4. Monitor patient use of aircraft stairs/Patient Loading System (PLS).
       13.6.1.5. Ensure all patients keep one hand free for grasping the handrail. NOTE:
       Attendants may carry infants on and off the aircraft. Infants may be carried in a chest or
       back carrier.
       13.6.1.6. Patients will not be seated in seats that do not lock in the full upright position or
       secure into applicable aircraft track.
   13.6.2. Enplaning/Deplaning Communication:           When multiple litter patients are being
   loaded, hand signals will be used.
       13.6.2.1. The “THUMBS UP” signal indicates to the litter bearers the aircrew is prepared
       for litter enplaning/deplaning. An exaggerated motion, raising the whole arm above the
       head, must be used during ERO procedures.
AFI11-2AEV3_433AWSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2013                                                            85


       13.6.2.2. . Extending crossed arms above the head indicates a “STOP” signal to the litter
       bearers to stop all movement.
       13.6.2.3. The “SLOW DOWN” signal indicates to the litter bearers to gradually slow the
       pace until the signal is ceased. The signal is given by extending arms outward and
       raising and lowering the arms from shoulder to waist with palms facing the ground.
       13.6.2.4. AECMs will direct and signal litter bearers to the proper litter tier as they enter
       the aircraft. This is done using exaggerated hand motions.
       13.6.2.5. AECMs will physically reach out and identify the litter arm or litter bracket on
       the stanchion where the litter will be placed. This allows litter bearers to visualize the
       position before they reach the litter tier.
       13.6.2.6. The AECM at the forward end of the litter will give the command to lift the
       litter into the litter brackets. The AECM at the forward end of the litter will ensure
       everyone is prepared to lift using the preparatory command “READY TO LIFT”, if no
       indication of a negative response, give the execution command “LIFT”.
   13.6.3. General Litter Loading Considerations. Safety is the primary concern during litter
   transfers. Proper lifting techniques should be used at all times. At no time should patient
   safety be compromised. In the event of large litter loads, ensure workload is distributed
   among numerous litter bearers, when available.
WARNING: Litters lifted above waist level will first be brought to chest level and then lifted
into place by no less than four-persons.

NOTE: Patients should have minimal exposure to the elements during enplaning/deplaning.
Patients will not be staged/positioned on the aircraft ramp or flight line during inclement
weather. Setting patients on either platform should be avoided.

NOTE: CCATT patients may be positioned with their head towards the flight deck if the
CCATT physician determines patient condition warrants head first placement.
       13.6.3.1. On the C-17/C-130 litter patients will be enplaned feet first and deplaned head
       first due to minimal degree of ramp incline. This eliminates the need to turn litter patients
       around on the cargo ramp prior to placing them in the litter tier. On the KC-135 litter
       patients will be enplaned head first to eliminate the need to turn litter patients around
       once on the aircraft.
       13.6.3.2. When the cargo ramp is unavailable or if cargo is already on the aircraft prior
       to enplaning/deplaning litter patients, litters may be loaded through the paratroop
       doors/crew entrance door.
       13.6.3.3. When enplaning/deplaning litters through the paratroop doors/crew entrance
       door on the C-130, at least four (4) people must be employed on the ground with an
       additional two (2) to three (3) people inside the aircraft.
       13.6.3.4. On the C-17, to load through the paratroop doors or the forward emergency
       escape door, a minimum of six people on the ground to lift over the head and four on the
       aircraft is required.
86                                             AFI11-2AEV3_433AWSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2013


        13.6.3.5. Position personnel in a way that they can safely hand the litter off to others as
        needed.
        13.6.3.6. When a comfort pallet is in place (C-17) first determine if there is adequate
        clearance to safely enplane/deplane the litter and any medical support equipment.
        WARNING: The preferred method to enplane/deplane ambulatory patients on the KC-
        135/KC-10/C-5 is the air stairs. The air stairs will not be used to enplane/deplane litter
        patients. If there is no other option available, the MCD will contact the appropriate C2
        agency for A3VM waiver.
        13.6.3.7. Both litter/ambulatory patients will enplane/deplane, using the patient loading
        system (PLS) or High Deck Loading Platform (HDLP). Maximum PLS weight capacity
        is 1500 lbs distributed and is rated to withstand 40 knot winds.
        13.6.3.8. If the PLS/HDLP is not available, request a or Hi-lift truck, Halverson Lift,
        Tunner (K-Loader), for patient enplaning/deplaning. Ensure one AECM accompanies the
        patient (s).     WARNING: Ensure all safety precautions are utilized when
        enplaning/deplaning patients on a K-Loader. One AECM should be directing patients
        during enplaning/deplaning. AECM’s should coordinate with BO to utilize ramps to
        cover gap between aircraft and K-Loader to prevent personnel from injury.
        13.6.3.9. Rollers on alternate platforms such as the Tunner will be turned over before
        beginning enplaning/deplaning operations. WARNING: Patients and medical equipment
        will not be placed on the patient support pallet (PSP) during pallet loading or off-loading.
        13.6.3.10. Litter stanchion arms on the C-17 and PSP are designed for non-sequential
        loading.
        13.6.3.11. AECMs will always secure the outside litter bracket immediately after loading
        a litter into a litter position. The inside bracket can be secured if time permits but will be
        secured prior to take-off.
        13.6.3.12. When only one (1) patient occupies a litter tier, the patient will be placed at a
        level that optimizes medical care, and allows the patient to easily get on and off the litter.
        13.6.3.13. When a litter, occupied or unoccupied, is placed in the lowest litter tier, a litter
        must be secured at waist level above it to prevent a tripping hazard. CAUTION:
        AECMs will be mindful of the potential strike hazard unoccupied litter stanchion arms
        (C-17 or Patient Support Pallet) present. To help eliminate the hazard: remove litter
        stanchion arms and store in a secure location on the aircraft. If a secure location is not
        available, place an empty litter in a vacant position or cover empty litter stanchion arms
        with blankets and secure with litter straps.
     13.6.4. C-130 aircraft litter loading procedures.
        13.6.4.1. It is the MCD/CMT discretion either to use a four or two person carry for C-
        130 enplaning/deplaning.
        13.6.4.2. The four to two person switch may be performed on or off the aircraft.
        13.6.4.3. The two AECMs actually loading will protect the patient from litter support
        brackets at all times.
        13.6.4.4. Loading into the centerline #5 and #4 litter positions:
AFI11-2AEV3_433AWSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2013                                                             87


        13.6.4.4.1. AECMs will hold the litter support straps to the outside of the litter area.
        13.6.4.4.2. Litter bearers will bring the litter into the litter tier area.
        13.6.4.4.3. Without setting the litter down, the AECMs will take the outside litter
        pole and then direct the litter bearer to take the inside pole.
        13.6.4.4.4. The AECMs will secure the outside bracket.
        13.6.4.4.5. Once the litter is in place, the litter bearers will be directed to exit the
        aircraft. If only one side of the aircraft is being used, litter bearers should be directed
        around the other side of the aircraft to avoid congestion. If loading both sides
        simultaneously (cross-loading), litter bearers should be sent back down the same side
        aisle but kept to the outside.
     13.6.4.5. Loading into the centerline #3 litter position:
        13.6.4.5.1. AECMs will secure the strap onto the #4 litter.
        13.6.4.5.2. The litter bearers will bring the litter into the litter tier area. NOTE:
        AECM may need to direct the first litter bearer to bend slightly in order to walk under
        litter #4 depending on the configuration.
        13.6.4.5.3. At the direction of the forward AECM, the litter bearers will set the litter
        into the inside stanchion bracket.
        13.6.4.5.4. AECMs will position the outside bracket under the litter pole and secure
        the outside litter bracket. Direct litter bearers to exit the aircraft.
     13.6.4.6. Loading into the centerline #2 and #1 position:
        13.6.4.6.1. The AECMs will place the litter support strap on the litter above the
        position to be loaded.
        13.6.4.6.2. The litter bearers will come on board and set the litter down in the aisle
        next to litter tier.
        13.6.4.6.3. The AECMs will take the inside litter pole and direct the litter bearers to
        take the outside litter pole. NOTE: When loading litter position #1, it is the AECMs
        discretion either to use a four or two person lift into the litter brackets. If AECMs
        decide to use a two person lift, release the litter bearers immediately.
        13.6.4.6.4. After the litter is placed in the inside litter bracket, the AECM will move
        the outside litter bracket into place and secure. Direct litter bearers to exit the
        aircraft.
     13.6.4.7. Loading into the sidewall/litter track extenders #4 and #3 litter position:
        13.6.4.7.1. The AECMs will hold the litter support strap to the outside of the litter
        tier.
        13.6.4.7.2. The litter bearers will bring the litter on board and into the litter tier area.
        13.6.4.7.3. Without setting the litter down, the crewmember will take the outside
        litter pole and then direct the litter bearer to take the inside pole.
88                                             AFI11-2AEV3_433AWSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2013


            13.6.4.7.4. Once the AECMs secure the outside brackets, direct the litter bearers to
            exit the aircraft.
        13.6.4.8. Loading into the sidewall/litter track extenders #2 and #1 litter position:
            13.6.4.8.1. The AECMs will place the litter support strap in the litter above the
            position to be loaded.
            13.6.4.8.2. The litter bearers will come on board and stop in the aisle by the litter tier.
            13.6.4.8.3. Without setting the litter down, the AECMs will take the outside litter
            handle and direct the litter bearers to take the inside litter handle.
            13.6.4.8.4. The AECM at the forward end of the litter will give the command to lift
            the litter into the brackets.
            13.6.4.8.5. AECMs will position the outside bracket under the litter pole and secure
            the outside litter bracket. Direct litter bearers to exit the aircraft. NOTE: Litter
            support straps (C-130) will be secured to the aircraft floor prior to take-off. If litters
            are not in the tier, loose litter support straps will be secured in a top and bottom litter
            support bracket on the litter stanchion. This will prevent a free-swinging strap from
            becoming a hazard.
        13.6.4.9. Procedures for C-130 aircraft litter off-loading. Off-loading procedures are the
        reverse of the loading procedures for each litter position. AECM positioning will remain
        the same.
     13.6.5. C-17 aircraft litter loading procedures.
        13.6.5.1. When on/offloading patients, pay attention to the elevated area around the edge
        of the Litter Station Augmentation Set (LSAS) (this area could be a potential tripping
        hazard). Spotter(s) should be used to ensure litter bearers are aware of the hazard. When
        on/offloading patients of excessive weight or with excessive equipment requiring more
        than a four-person carry, extra caution should also be used.
        13.6.5.2. The LSAS will remain onboard the aircraft during patient loading/offloading.
        Exception: in the rare event that a specific patient's condition, equipment needs or size
        raises serious safety concerns, the LSAS box may be removed from the aircraft for
        increased clearance. The PIC, with coordination between the MCD and LM, is the final
        authority in determining if the LSAS should be removed to facilitate patient
        on/offloading. MCD should request ground handling equipment, as required, on the
        offload message.
        13.6.5.3. Litter arms should be positioned and secured with brackets open on all
        identified litter tiers. When configured to an AE-2 with the LSAS positioned on the ramp
        in the aerial delivery system (ADS) rails, the most aft litter arms can be removed before
        loading if they present a safety hazard. Reposition the removed litter arms prior to
        loading that specific litter tier.
        13.6.5.4. A four person carry can be utilized throughout the C-17 cargo compartment.
        WARNING: To ensure patient safety when loading/unloading litter stations, two
        AECMs will maintain control of the litter until it is safely locked into the stanchion or
        cleared the stanchion for deplaning.
AFI11-2AEV3_433AWSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2013                                                                89


     13.6.5.5. When loading CCATT/oversized litters up to a 6 person carry can be utilized.
     It is at the AECMs discretion not to release any of the litter bearers to assist with loading.
     AECMs are responsible for control and verbal commands of litter loading.
     13.6.5.6. Litter position at or above waist level:
        13.6.5.6.1. AECMs will direct the litter bearers to the litter station.
        13.6.5.6.2. Without setting the litter down, the AECMs will take the inside litter
        handle and then direct the litter bearers to take the outside handle.
        13.6.5.6.3. The AECMs will secure the outside bracket. Direct litter bearers to exit
        the aircraft.
     13.6.5.7. Loading into litter positions below waist level:
        13.6.5.7.1. AECMs will direct the litter bearers to the litter station.
        13.6.5.7.2. Direct litter bearers to lower litter to the floor next to the litter station.
        13.6.5.7.3. AECMs will take the inside litter handle and then direct the litter bearer to
        maintain outside litter handles.
        13.6.5.7.4. After the litter is placed in the litter arms, the AECMs will secure the
        outside litter bracket. Direct litter bearers to exit the aircraft.
     13.6.5.8. Procedures for C-17 aircraft litter off-loading. Off-loading procedures are the
     reverse of the loading procedures for each litter position. AECM positioning will remain
     the same.
  13.6.6. KC-135/PSP Loading Procedures.
     13.6.6.1. Litter stanchion arms should be positioned and secured with brackets open on
     all identified litter tiers.
     13.6.6.2. For KC-135 operations, a four to a two person switch is performed once all
     litter bearers are on board. The released litter bearers will exit using the Patient Loading
     System (PLS) or return to the loading platform to allow for unobstructed movement of
     the two litter bearers.
     13.6.6.3. Litter position at or above waist level:
        13.6.6.3.1. AECMs will direct the litter bearers to the litter station.

            13.6.6.4.4. After the litter is placed in the litter arms, the AECM will secure the
            outside litter bracket. Direct litter bearers to exit the aircraft.
         13.6.6.5. Procedures for KC-135 aircraft litter off-loading. Off-loading procedures are
         the reverse of the loading procedures for each litter position. AECM positioning will
         remain the same.
      13.6.7. Engines Running Onload (ERO).
         13.6.7.1. For AE missions, an ERO is authorized for contingency operations or during
         non-contingency AE missions when requirements dictate minimum ground time. EROs
         will not be used in a non-contingency environment unless mission essential. ERO
         procedures may be practiced/trained during ARMs, joint training operations, exercises,
         etc. Refer to 13.6.2 for proper hand signals.
WARNING: Eye protection will be worn outside the aircraft during all ERO procedures.

EXCEPTION: For the C-17, eye protection is not necessary, except when operating in parking
areas where flying debris could be picked up from engine exhaust.
         13.6.7.2. C-5, C-21, KC-10, and KC-135 Aircraft. AE EROs are not conducted on these
         aircraft for AE missions.
         13.6.7.3. AECM’s may exit the aircraft to conduct ground duties if not contraindicated
         by Intel/SPINS (Special Instructions).
         13.6.7.4. The LM will be positioned at the foot of the ramp on the left side of the aircraft
         and on headset during actual onload procedures. The LM will observe for aircraft threats,
         and will enforce compliance with safety requirements.
         13.6.7.5. A spotter is provided by the ground AE element and is positioned 50 feet aft of
         the aircraft ramp.
            13.6.7.5.1. The spotter’s primary responsibility is to indicate to the ground element
            when the AEC are ready for patient loading, and to start/slow/stop the flow of
            patients as needed.
            13.6.7.5.2. The spotter monitors the litter-bearers to determine if assistance is needed
            and to ensure safe practices are maintained around the aircraft (i.e. prevent litter
            bearers from entering the prop wash/jet blast etc.)
         13.6.7.6. Crossloading. Patients will normally be cross loaded during EROs depending
         on the aircraft configuration and cargo requirements.
         13.6.7.7. For the C-130, litters will be brought onboard as safety considerations allow
         and loaded forward to aft/top to bottom.
         13.6.7.8. Baggage will be loaded on the aircraft ramp and will not impede emergency
         egress.

      13.6.8.1. Accompanied patient baggage will receive expeditious handling and will be
      processed separately from passenger baggage. Anti-hijack inspection of all persons and
      hand-carried articles transported in the AE system is required. While this is normally
      accomplished by the originating MTF, the MCD will ensure anti-hijacking statement is
      included on AF IMT 3851. All baggage requires inspection.
      13.6.8.2. The 3AET will ensure all baggage is tagged with a DD Form 600 and reflected
      on the original baggage manifest. The original baggage manifest will be given to the
      MCD at the end of the mission and filed with mission paperwork.
      13.6.8.3. Due to space limitations onboard the aircraft, all patients and attendants are
      limited to one hand-carried item. If hand-carried baggage will not fit under the patient’s
      seat and is stored in the cargo compartment, a DD Form 1839 will be accomplished.
      13.6.8.4. Patients will not be permitted access to checked baggage.
   13.6.9. Baggage Restrictions. Special care will be exercised by all AE agencies to ensure
   that stowed and hand-carried baggage does not contain unauthorized weapons, explosive
   devices, or unauthorized drugs.
      13.6.9.1. Stowed baggage will be restricted to suitcases, duffel bags, hand bags, B-4
      bags, A-2/3 bags, foot lockers, garment bags, or strong, durable cardboard boxes capable
      of withstanding frequent handling during transportation. Articles having dimensions
      exceeding 62 inches in one direction, exceeding overall dimensions of 100 inches (length
      plus width plus height), or exceeding 100 pounds will not be accepted as stowed baggage.
      NOTE: On the C-21, patients and attendants will be limited to one stowed bag not
      exceeding 30lbs. In addition one hand carried article (brief case, laptop case , purse) may
      be carried. If extra baggage is carried, it will be processed by the sending facility into the
      Traffic Management System.
      13.6.9.2. Total baggage weight for each patient or attendant will not exceed 100 pounds.
   13.6.10. Patient/Attendant Unaccompanied Baggage. Unaccompanied baggage will not be
   transported onboard AE aircraft.
      13.6.10.1. No-show patient/attendant baggage or baggage of patients/attendants removed
      from flight will be off-loaded prior to departure.
      13.6.10.2. Aircrew will not accept unaccompanied baggage unless the baggage has been
      processed through traffic management office (TMO) or installation transportation office
      (ITO) and arrives to the aircraft as freight.
      13.6.10.3. Baggage that becomes separated from the owner becomes freight. Direct
      personnel to turn unaccompanied baggage over to TMO/ITO for proper manifesting.
13.7. En Route Duties
   13.7.1. AECMs are responsible for properly securing aeromedical equipment, hand-carried
   baggage, and any other miscellaneous items in the aircraft cabin. Ensure all seat belts and
   litter straps are securely fastened; and that the cabin area is properly prepared for takeoff or
   landing. Unsecured items are a hazard in the event of rapid decompression or aircraft
   emergency. NOTE: Before advising the MCD of “Cabin Secure” IAW the AECM checklist,
   the appropriate AET must complete a final check of the cabin to ensure all loose items are
92                                            AFI11-2AEV3_433AWSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2013


  secured; seat backs are in the full upright position (if applicable), all seat belts and litter
  straps are securely fastened; and the cabin area is properly prepared for takeoff/landing.
  13.7.2. LM/BOs, or other members of the flight crew, are responsible for ensuring
  information briefings highlight the following areas:
        13.7.2.1. Emergency signals and passenger evacuation.
        13.7.2.2. Use of emergency oxygen equipment.
        13.7.2.3. Location of restroom. NOTE: The AEC are not passenger monitors. When

            Emergency Escape Breathing Device (EEBD), , Emergency Passenger Oxygen
            System () and life preserver, when available, to conduct their patient, passenger, and
            Mission Essential Personnel (MEP) briefings. Air Mobility Command Visual Aid
            (AMCVA) 11-302, Emergency Passenger Oxygen System (), should be used to
            conduct briefings.
     13.7.3. Mission Delays. To preclude unnecessary patient holding on the flight line, aircraft
     departure times are not established on the basis of an estimated time in commission (ETIC).
     Departure times will be scheduled only on the basis of Fully Mission Capable (FMC).
        13.7.3.1. The MCD must be cognizant that guidelines are not a substitute for sound
        judgment. Decisions should be put into action only after making a thorough assessment
        of the patient’s medical needs and considering surrounding circumstances. With this in
        mind, the following guidance is offered:
            13.7.3.1.1. If the delay exceeds 1 hour, ambulatory patients should be deplaned to a
            rest area such as a lounge or terminal facility. These patients remain the responsibility
            of the AECMs. If feasible, litter patients should be evaluated and appropriate action
            taken for their care. Meals may be obtained for patients by utilizing AF IMT 15,
            United States Air Force Invoice. Keep patients informed of the current situation.
            13.7.3.1.2. Once the mission is in delay and the aircraft ETIC is more than 3 hours
            after scheduled departure, consider moving all patients to the nearest medical facility
            capable of supporting patient requirements. Before the actual movement of patients
            takes place, contact the FCC at the appropriate C2 agency for consultation and
            assistance. The C2 agency must be promptly notified of the problem as the facts are
            known. NOTE: Ground transportation time to the MTF should be considered.
 13.7.4. Unscheduled RON Procedures. Normally, AE missions will remain overnight at
 bases where ASFs/ASTSs are located. Exceptions may occur due to weather, equipment
 failure, or patient needs. In these instances, the following procedures apply:
        13.7.4.1. Coordinate with the appropriate C2 agency to ensure that the medical facility
        selected for patient care has the capability to meet patient needs.
        13.7.4.2. On military installations, if appropriate medical personnel are not available for
        transfer of care, the MCD or FN is responsible for accompanying all patients to the
AFI11-2AEV3_433AWSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2013                                                            93


      medical facility and provide report to the staff that will take charge of interim patient care
      responsibilities.
      13.7.4.3. Remain with patients until assured of their acceptance into the appropriate
      medical service and that adequate arrangements for care have been made. Include patient
      disposition in end of mission report to appropriate C2 agency.
      13.7.4.4. If care is transferred to a civilian medical facility, the MCD or FN will
      accompany all patients to and from the civilian medical facility and assume responsibility
      for the following items:
          13.7.4.4.1. Coordinate with the Director of Patient Administration, or equivalent,
          indicating the number of patients involved and their nursing care requirements.
          Problems encountered during the admission process will be managed tactfully,
          emphasizing patient necessity. If personnel at the facility resist the recommendation,
          the MCD will refer the matter to the appropriate C2 agency.
          13.7.4.4.2. Furnish a      complete    clinical   report   to   the   receiving   facility
          nursing/physician staff.
          13.7.4.4.3. Remain with patients until assured of their acceptance and that adequate
          arrangement for care have been made with the appropriate medical service.
      13.7.4.5. Whether military or civilian facility, AECMs will be responsible for care of
      their patients whenever hospital staffing is unable to provide adequate support. The
      appropriate C2 agency will be notified immediately when this occurs in order to task an
      additional AEC to complete the mission.
      13.7.4.6. The MCD will ensure that all drugs and medical supplies are adequately
      secured. Narcotics will be placed in the custody of the MTF pharmacy section.
      13.7.4.7. AETs are responsible for obtaining adequate patient baggage storage. Based on
      local situations and/or patient status, bags may be stored centrally or may be given to the
      RON patient. Regardless of process used, patients will be allowed immediate access to
      their baggage while staying in RON facilities at a military installation.
      13.7.4.8. The MCD will coordinate all aspects of mission departure for the following
      day.
      13.7.4.9. The MCD will ensure arrangements are made for ordering in-flight meals.

   aircraft, blackout/low-light conditions and inclement weather.
   20.2.2. No Smoking is allowed within 50-feet of the aircraft.
20.3. Guidelines for Vehicle Drivers. Vehicle operators will follow the guidelines prescribed
in AFJMAN 24-306, Manual for the Wheeled Vehicle Driver, and AFH 41-318, Ambulance Bus
(AMBUS) Training Standards, and the following when enplaning/deplaning patients. Vehicle
supervision, movement, and placement in and around the aircraft are the responsibility of the
CMT with concurrence of the LM/BO, or PIC (as applicable).
   20.3.1. All vehicular movement around the aircraft must maintain the 10-foot “circle of
   safety” from the nose, tail and wingtips of the aircraft. Any movement required within this
   circle will be directed by the CMT with concurrence of the LM/BO.
   20.3.2. All vehicles approach parked aircraft with the driver side of the vehicle toward the
   aircraft.
   20.3.3. The spotter pre-positions wheel chocks between the aircraft and vehicle within the 10
   foot “circle of safety”, to prevent vehicles from damaging the aircraft. Additional vehicles
   can be parked without chocks (no closer than 10 feet to the aircraft) providing a chocked
   vehicle is between the un-chocked vehicle and the aircraft. Chocks will remain in position
   until the vehicle(s) are ready for movement.
   20.3.4. Vehicles parked on the flight-line will remain unlocked with the key in the ignition.
   If the vehicle driver does not remain in the drivers’ seat after parking, the ignition must be
   turned off and the parking brake applied. In addition, the gear lever will be placed in a gear
   on vehicles with standard transmission, park for vehicles with automatic transmission. These
   requirements are not necessary if a driver remains behind the wheel at all times.

   20.3.5. Only vehicles required to enplane/deplane patients or passengers or service the
   aircraft are permitted to approach the aircraft after it has blocked in. All vehicles will stand
   clear until directed to proceed towards aircraft. More than one vehicle may be positioned in
   the vicinity of the aircraft; however, only one vehicle may be in motion toward the aircraft at
   any one time.
   20.3.6. AE ground support vehicles will be marshaled to the aircraft for aircraft set up,
   deplaning of AE medical equipment/supplies, and patient baggage by a qualified AECM.
   20.3.7. The AMBUS and/or ambulances will be positioned near the ramp entrance.
   Additional AMBUSs and/or ambulances may be marshaled towards the aircraft and be
   parked next to the first AMBUS and/ or ambulance, to expedite enplaning/deplaning patients.
20.4. Emergency Exits and Safety Aisles.
   20.4.1. When patients are seated in side facing seats, the LM/BO will ensure there is
   sufficient space between the cargo and the seats to permit patients leg room.
       20.4.1.1. When the load consists of palletized netted cargo or is secured with straps or
       chains, a 30-inch space will be maintained between the cargo and the nearest forward
       litter or occupied seat. EXCEPTION: N/A on KC-135 and KC-10.
       20.4.1.2. At least one unobstructed emergency exit is available for each 20 patients /
       troops. (This does not restrict over water flights if the three overhead escape hatches are
       available for egress.). Litters and seats erected across an emergency exit are not
       considered an obstruction. WARNING: For KC-135, PSPs and litters cannot be placed
       in front of hatches. Use appropriate PSP extensions to ensure egress route is
       unobstructed.
       20.4.1.3. Do not secure aircraft or medical equipment adjacent to an emergency exit in a
       manner that will prevent or impede egress.

       containing integral wheels. EXCEPTION: An occupied neonatal transport system
       (NTS) may be rolled up or down ramps due to the weight of the NTS. Ensure the infant is
       properly secured inside the incubator. Four or more people will enplane/deplane the
       NTS. The MCD and CMT should use good judgment and common sense to carry out
       this operation in a safe manner. Occupied or unoccupied NTS will not be rolled up or
       down PLS, jarring may damage components.
       20.5.1.3. Unoccupied ambulance-type stretchers/gurneys.
       20.5.1.4. Air compressors with integral wheels.
AFI11-2AEV3_433AWSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2013                                                          103


     20.5.1.5. Stryker Frame base.
     20.5.1.6. Any other item that has integral wheels and is required to support a mission.
     20.5.1.7. Pressurized gas cylinders secured to wheeled dollies. NOTE: Regulators must
     be removed and cylinders capped prior to enplaning/deplaning. Only cylinders with caps
     are accepted. EXCEPTION: Cylinders carried as part of a system (transport incubator,
     etc.) with cylinders in their applicable transport compartment do not need to be capped.
     20.5.1.8. Compressed gas cylinders may be utilized as a source to provide oxygen or
     other compressed gas on any AE mission. These cylinders provide the drive pressure and
     gas mixes for ventilator patients and supplemental oxygen as required. When a patient is
     delivered to their final destination and the cylinders are deplaned, they will be prepared
     for return shipment as hazardous cargo per AFJMAN 24-204, Preparing Hazardous
     Materials for Military Air Shipment. When the same aircraft returns to home station
     where the cylinders originated, they may remain onboard as aeromedical equipment.
     Always have the regulator removed and the cylinder capped when returning cylinders.
         20.5.1.8.1. H-Tank securing procedure. To secure H-size compressed air cylinders
         on-board the aircraft, the following components are required: two cargo tie-down
         straps per “H” tank, one piece of ¾” plywood sheet (20”X14”) or milk crate to utilize
         as shoring.
         20.5.1.8.2. Place ¾” plywood or milk crate on the cargo floor or PSP. A blanket is
         not adequate for shoring.
         20.5.1.8.3. The H-tank should be placed securely against the inner aspect of the
         stanchion. Use non-conducting material (i.e. cotton blankets) to prevent metal to
         metal contact.
         20.5.1.8.4. Secure the H-tank with two cargo tie-down straps placed on the upper and
         lower portion of the H-tank.
         20.5.1.8.5. H-tanks will be capped prior to transport on and off the aircraft.
  20.5.2. Minimum of a four (4) person carry is required for enplaning/deplaning the
  following:
     20.5.2.1. . Lifting a litter patient above waist level.
     20.5.2.2. Litter patients of excessive weight or those required to be carried for long
     distances.
     20.5.2.3. Occupied civilian ambulance type stretchers/gurneys.
         20.5.2.3.1. Prior to placing a patient on or removing a patient from an ambulance
         gurney/stretcher, ensure the gurney/stretcher is in the lowest position, side rails are
         down, and wheels are locked or a member from the ambulance team has control of
         the gurney/ stretcher.
     20.5.2.4. Transport incubators with infants. (See exception in 20.4.1.2).
         20.5.2.4.1. Infant transport incubators are placed in any litter tier in the middle
         position. The infant’s head is positioned forward or aft within the incubator
104                                          AFI11-2AEV3_433AWSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2013


         according to the manufacturer’s instruction. At least two (2) securing straps will be
         connected around the infant for takeoff, landing and in flight.
      20.5.2.5. Patients on Stryker Frames.
      20.5.2.6. When inclement weather creates a hazardous condition (e.g., icy or wet ramp).
      20.5.2.7. Whenever determined by the crew to be the safest method for
      enplaning/deplaning based on conditions. NOTE: Due to the limited aisle width onboard
      most aircraft, a switch to a two (2) person carry may be conducted in the interest of
      safety. Use good judgment prior to the switch, to prevent undue injury or strain to the
      two (2) person carry team. AECMs will switch back to 4-persons if lifting above waist
      level into litter stanchions. Ensure ramp extenders are placed/spaced to facilitate the safe
      loading/unloading of patients in the given operating environment (contingency, low-light,
      inclement weather etc.) Position spotters as required to ensure safe operations.
  20.5.3. A minimum three (3) person carry is required for the following:
      20.5.3.1. Enplaning/deplaning a litter patient with a backrest. Two individuals are at the
      head of the litter and the third at the foot of the litter. Per the NOTE above, AECMs may
      revert to a two (2) person carry once inside the aircraft. Backrests will not be in the 90-
      degree position during enplaning/deplaning or during take-off and landing. The backrest
      may be changed to the 90-degree angle in-flight for patient comfort and care.
  20.5.4. Lifting litter patients into or out of an ambulance, AMBUS or a vehicle that does not
  have a ramp.
      20.5.4.1. Position one person at the foot of the litter and two persons on either side of the
      litter at the door of the vehicle to lift and assist in moving the litter.
      20.5.4.2. Vehicle doors will be physically secured or manually held in the open position
      when litter patients are being loaded/unloaded.
      20.5.4.3. As the litter is pulled out of the vehicle, the 2 individuals positioned at the sides
      of the litter will grasp the litter with one hand at or above the patient’s waist and one hand
      at the patient’s head. Position personnel in a way that they can safely hand the litter off
      to others as needed.
  20.5.5. Wheelchair patients/transporting battery powered wheelchairs.
      20.5.5.1. Position one (1) individual behind and two (2) forward of the patient in the
      wheelchair.
      20.5.5.2. Locate space in the aircraft cabin to secure the wheelchair. NOTE: When a
      wheelchair patient is scheduled for transport, the tasking C2 agency will ensure adequate
      space is available for wheelchair storage.
      20.5.5.3. Secure the wheelchair upright in the aircraft cabin. Ensure the wheelchair does
      not interfere with emergency egress or pose a safety hazard. To prevent wheelchair
      damage, do not over tighten cargo tie-down straps.
      20.5.5.4. Deactivate the battery. Remove the connection at the battery terminals or
      otherwise disconnect power source. WARNING: Do not charge the battery or electric
AFI11-2AEV3_433AWSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2013                                                         105


     wheelchairs via the aircraft electrical system. Ensure the battery is securely attached to
     the wheelchair. Do not remove the battery from the wheelchair.
  20.5.6. Neonatal Transport System (NTS) securing procedures. The NTS will be secured on
  cargo aircraft and the PSP for transport. Position wooden blocks under the NTS frame to
  elevate the unit’s wheels off the cargo floor/PSP. (The wooden blocks prevent stress/pressure
  from being placed on the NTS wheels during transport.)
     20.5.6.1. Use four cargo tie-down straps to secure the NTS to the cargo floor/PSP. The
     clip-hook of each strap will be attached to the hole at each corner of the NTS upper
     handles. The other end of the four cargo tie-downs will be secured to D-rings on the
     cargo floor or in the PSP seat tracks.
     20.5.6.2. Two AECMs are required when tightening the cargo tie-down straps, one on
     each end. Use caution not to over tighten the straps.
  20.5.7. Transport of PTLOX. The PTLOX system will be transported per provisions in
  AFJMAN 24-204, Preparing Hazardous Materials for Military Air Shipment. These units
  will be maintained per T.O. 15X-2-8-1.
     20.5.7.1. HQ AFMC-24-204-97-12 waiver allows shipment of up to twenty-five 10-liter
     units on military aircraft without establishing a means for overboard venting.
     EXCEPTION: This waiver does not apply to C-21. To enhance safety, when shipping
     more than six PTLOX containers as cargo, do not cover the PTLOX pallet with plastic;
     this may create accumulation of high oxygen concentrations. Ensure the cargo floor is
     free from any oil or other petroleum based products.
     20.5.7.2. An exception to policy to AMCI 24-101 V11, Cargo and Mail Policy, allows
     AECs to carry PTLOX as professional gear when positioning and depositioning for
     operational AE missions and contingency support operations. The exceptions to policy
     are:
         20.5.7.2.1. The PTLOX does not require HAZMAT certification.
         20.5.7.2.2. Venting is not required.
         20.5.7.2.3. Processing through Aerial Port is not required.
     20.5.7.3. AECMs will:
         20.5.7.3.1. Be in additional aircrew (ACM) status.
         20.5.7.3.2. Inform command post of the amount of equipment and PTLOX to be
         carried on the aircraft. Command post will advise the ATOC.
         20.5.7.3.3. Notify the PIC and LM/BO that PTLOX will be transported.
         20.5.7.3.4. Determine proper placement of PTLOX on the aircraft with direction
         from the PIC and LM/BO.
  20.5.8. Defibrillation Procedures. To safely defibrillate a patient positioned on the aircraft
  floor, place a dry, woolen/cotton blanket under the patient. If any part of the patient contacts
  the floor, the distribution of current may be affected, resulting in the patient receiving less
  than the programmed amount of defibrillating current and/or possible skin burns. When
 106                                        AFI11-2AEV3_433AWSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2013


   monitoring electrodes are attached to the patient, the ground electrode possesses a ground
   potential.
       20.5.8.1. Patients may be defibrillated on litters with aluminum handles. Normal safety
       precautions must be followed (i.e., avoid direct contact with the patient or any portion of
       the litter during the procedure).
20.6. In-Flight Safety Procedures.
   20.6.1. All patients, regardless of age, will be assigned a seat. The parent or guardian has
   the option to hold the infant or place them in an FAA approved infant car seat (ICS) in the
   assigned seat.
       20.6.1.1. The FAA has banned the use of booster seats, harness and vest child restraints.
       20.6.1.2. When a parent or attendant holds a child/infant, the seat belt is never placed
       around both the parent/attendant and the child/infant.
       20.6.1.3. In the event of turbulence, the weight of the adult against the child/infant could
       result in injury to the child/infant. The attendant will secure the seat belt around their
       waist, with the seat belt securing mechanism secured to the aisle side of the attendant (if
       possible) to prevent the child/infant from sitting on the securing mechanism. A litter
       strap is placed through the seat belt, around the child/infant, and then secured. Additional
       padding should be placed between the child and the litter strap buckle.
       20.6.1.4. When a small child occupies a seat, a pillow (if available) or some type of
       padding (i.e., blanket) should be placed between the child and the seat belt securing
       mechanism. Acceptable child/infant safety seats/restraints may be used during all phases
       of flight in forward or aft facing seats. NOTE: These types of seats/restraints will not
       normally be used in side facing (web type) seats, to transport patients or attendants.
       Passenger Services has approved the transport of passengers requiring child/ infant safety
       seats/restraints in side facing (web type) seats.
       20.6.1.5. If the aircraft is equipped with airline type seats, seat children/infants in
       child/infant seats/restraints by the fuselage with an adult in the aisle or middle seat.
       20.6.1.6. An adult must be able to reach emergency oxygen/life vest under all
       circumstances.
       20.6.1.7. Never seat young children where they are required to distribute oxygen masks.
       Ensure parents with young children can reach the oxygen mask container.
       20.6.1.8. Pregnant patients will be secured with a small pillow (if available) or some type
       of padding (i.e., blanket, etc.) between their lower abdomen and the seat belt. The seat
       belt is secured under the abdomen, across the hips.
   20.6.2. Crewmembers should keep one hand free in-flight, if possible, to allow for
   stabilization in the event of turbulence.
   20.6.3. Smoking in aircraft lavatories is a federal offense. Patients or passengers smoking in
   lavatories or tampering with detectors (if applicable) will be deplaned, medical condition
   permitting, at the next en route stop. Local authorities will be alerted of the offense. Notify
   tasking AE C2 agency for patient offenses, 618 TACC for passenger offenses and document
   actions/details on AF IMT 3829, (or TRAC2ES equivalent).
AFI11-2AEV3_433AWSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2013                                                         107


   20.6.4. AECMs should escort patients to the latrine. Same sex AECM should accompany
   mental health patients to the latrine to provide supervision.
   20.6.5. When required to perform crew duties for a litter patient during takeoff and/or
   landing, FNs, AETs, or MAs will be properly secured to the litter. Three (3) litter straps are
   required for the following procedure:
      20.6.5.1. One (1) litter strap must be placed through the stirrups on each end of the litter
      and attached securely through a litter strap placed around the waist of the person
      standing.
      20.6.5.2. The person standing should be positioned on the aisle of the litter.

channel missions because of the unusual nature, sensitivity, or urgency of the cargo or that
requires operations to points other than the established channel structure.
Special Category Patients—A special patient is any patient who can be considered at
significant risk being aeromedically evacuated. To designate a patient as “special” is a matter of
judgment based on many factors. Among these are the patient’s clinical status and degree of
stability, amount of time between origination and destination MTF, and duration of individual
missions if more than one is needed to move. Special patients can be designated by the
MCD/FN, PMCC, VFS or responsible physician and must be coordinated through the PMRC.
Stage Management System— The AMC Stage Management System is activated by
TACC/XOZ when necessary to maximize airlift/air-refueling/aeromedical evacuation (AE)
capability. Staging aircrews at critical locations minimizes the time aircraft spend on the ground
awaiting rested aircrews. This is a force multiplier providing significantly increased airlift, air
refueling and AE capability.
Stations Time (Air Force)— Normally, 30 minutes prior to takeoff time for the KC-10, KC-
135, C-130, and OSA aircraft (45 minutes for C-5 and C-17). Aircrews will have completed their
preflight duties and be at their crew positions. Passengers will be seated and cargo will be
secured.

a. Notify loadmaster/boom operator/pilot (if origin of fire is in cabin) and aeromedical
evacuation crew of nature of emergency.
3. Fire combat as directed (AEC)

NOTE: The pilot/LM/BO will direct crewmembers to fight the fire as required. Crewmembers
not directly involved with combating the fire will proceed with their emergency procedures
checklist.

WARNING: Although Halon 1211 vapor has a low toxicity, its decomposition products can be
hazardous. On decomposition, Halon 1211 has a characteristic sharp, acrid odor, even in
concentrations of only a few parts per million. The odor provides a built-in warning system for
the agent and at the same time creates a noxious, irritating atmosphere for those who are in the
hazard area during and following a fire. Leave and/or ventilate area after fighting a fire.

NOTE: To use the Halon 1211 fire extinguisher, hold a vertical position, about eight feet from
the fire. Remove the pull-ring pin and aim nozzle at base of the fire. Squeeze lever and sweep
agent across base of fire.

4. Patients. Assist as necessary (AEC)
a. Assist patients in donning emergency oxygen equipment.
b. Relocate patients out of the vicinity of the fire.
c. Secure patients in preparation for Smoke and Fumes Removal procedures.

NOTE: Placing a wet towel or handkerchief over the nose and mouth or over the mask, when
utilized, affords better protection from smoke and fumes. Relocate the patients as necessary.
