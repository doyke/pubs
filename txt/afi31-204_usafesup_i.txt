This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 31-2, Law Enforcement. It assigns
responsibilities and establishes procedures for motor vehicle traffic supervision on Air Force installations
in the continental United States (CONUS) and overseas (OCONUS) areas. This includes, but is not lim-
ited to, granting, suspending, or revoking the privilege to operate a privately owned vehicle (POV); regis-
tration of POVs; administration of vehicle registration and driver performance records; driver
improvement programs; police traffic supervision; and off-installation traffic activities.

(USAFE) AFI 31-204, 14 July 2000, is supplemented as follows: This supplement applies to all United
States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) units. It applies to Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) and
National Guard (ANG) units. It also applies to all members of the United States (US) military assigned or
attached to Geographically Separated Units (GSU) located in Europe. It prescribes USAFE IMT 3, Driv-
ers License/Vehicle Registration Application (Germany Excluded), and USAFE IMT 374, USAFE
Driving Permit. C

SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This interim change eliminates the requirement for privately owed vehicles to be registered with the Air
Force or other DoD agency to be operated on an Air Force installation. The IC re-titles Chapter 3 from
“Motor Vehicle Registration” to “Privately Owned Vehicle Operation Requirements.” A bar ( | ) indicates
a revision from the previous edition.
Chapter 3, REPLACED. This chapter has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed.
(USAFE) This Interim Change (IC) rescinds the USAFE Form 374, USAFE Driving Permit. References
to the USAFE Form 374 are replaced with the Driving/Fuel Permit. Driver licensing in 3rd Air Force is
accomplished through the Security Forces Management Information System in the Registration, Pass and
ID module utilizing the Driving/Fuel Permit. Additionally, it deletes references to the USAFE Form 4,
Vehicle Registration Document. Vehicle registration is only required for concession vehicles and to
receive tax-free fuel using the Driving/Fuel Permit. References to the Pass and Registration are replaced
with the Permit Issuing Office responsible for tracking and issuing the Driving/Fuel Permit as this func-
tion does not always reside within Security Forces. A margin bar indicates newly revised material.

    fic accidents. If there is no installation traffic engineer, the installation commander may request sup-
    port services by contacting the Commander, Military Traffic Management Command, 5611 Columbia
    Pike, Falls Church VA 22041-5050.
    1.2.9. Mental Health Office. The mental health substance abuse control program provides alcohol/
    drug education, treatment, and rehabilitation to personnel identified with alcohol and/or drug abuse
    problems.

1.3. Delegation Of Authority. Installation commanders can delegate their authority under this instruc-
tion to their vice commander, support group commander, or other appropriate official. Those selected for
delegation must not occupy a law enforcement, investigative, or other position which might lead to a con-
flict of interest or the appearance of such conflict during their administration of the motor vehicle traffic
supervision program. Installation commanders must coordinate their letters of delegation through their
installation staff judge advocate

                                      DRIVING PRIVILEGES

2.1. Requirements for Driving Privileges.
   2.1.1. Driving a government owned vehicle (GOV) or POV on an Air Force installation is a privilege
   granted by the installation commander. If you accept that privilege, you must comply with the laws
   and instructions governing motor vehicle operation and registration on the installation. Consequently,
   everyone operating a motor vehicle on a military installation must produce, upon request from the
   security police, the following:
      2.1.1.1. Proof of vehicle ownership or registration if required by the issuing authority.
      2.1.1.1. (USAFE) (United Kingdom (UK) ONLY). Vehicle operators will produce the appropri-
      ate registration documents within 72 hours of request by proper authorities. Any of the following
      documents constitute proof of ownership for military purposes within the UK: a stateside title,
      British registration document (V-5 (DOT Form 386)), Declaration of Registration, 3AF IMT
      430, Military Registration and Certificate of Title of Motor Vehicle, or a properly completed
      3AF IMT 156/CE FM 941, Request for Delivery of Motor Vehicle Without Payment of Duty
      Value Added Tax and Car Tax (pink color).
      2.1.1.2. A valid state, overseas command, host nation, or international driver’s license and/or AF
      Form 2293, US Air Force Motor Vehicle Operator’s Identification Card, supported by a DD
      Form 2, US Armed Forces Identification Card. Locally determine acceptable identification
      media for civilian personnel and base contractors. Note: Each installation commander must deter-
      mine if international drivers licenses are recognized and accepted by the local (civilian) jurisdic-
      tion, and if so, will their use be authorized on the installation. As a general rule, most CONUS
      civilian jurisdictions will honor use of international drivers licenses for short periods of time by
      non-resident visitors and assigned military personnel. When practical, installation commanders
      should assimilate local policy to preclude conflicting policy.
      2.1.1.2. (USAFE) Motorcycle operators must provide proof of satisfactory completion of the
      Motorcycle Safety Foundation Beginner Rider’s Course (BRC) or Experienced Rider’s Course
      (ERC). Refresher training is required every three years from the date of issue on the Motorcycle
      Safety Foundation (MSF) completion card.
          2.1.1.2.1. (Added-USAFE) (UK ONLY). The Driving/Fuel Permit is the only license used
          to identify permanent party military personnel, Department of the Air Force (DAF) civilians,
          and their dependents on and off base. The Driving/Fuel Permit is valid for operation of a pri-
          vately-owned vehicle (POV) on and off the installation for members of the force, civilian com-
          ponent, and their dependents, as the terms are used in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization/
          Status of Forces Agreement (NATO SOFA); see para 3.2. In order to obtain a Driving/Fuel
          Permit, persons who hold a valid driver’s license (i.e., stateside, United States Army Europe
          (USAREUR), etc.) must successfully complete the required written driver’s test; Course II,
          Local Conditions; and, for all two-wheeled motorized POVs, Motorcycle Safety Foundation
          Basic Riders Course (BRC) or Experienced Riders Course (ERC), as applicable. A valid
          license needs only be current at the time the Driving/Fuel Permit, was issued and needs not
          be kept current in order for the Driving/Fuel Permit to remain valid. Persons governed by
8                                                       AFI31-204_USAFESUP_I 5 JANUARY 2006


         this directive who hold a full British license are also required to obtain a Driving/Fuel Permit
         in order to meet requirements to obtain tax-free fuel. These persons are exempt from complet-
         ing the written or electronic driver’s test; however, they mist still receive a briefing on
         tax-free fuel entitlements and concession restrictions and the Permit Issuing Office must have
         a USAFE Form 3, Drivers License/Vehicle Registration Application completed and placed on
         file in order to be issued the Driving/Fuel Permit. Additionally, persons governed by this
         directive who hold a full two-wheeled British driver’s license are required to attend the BRC
         or ERC in order to operate a two-wheeled motorized POV on-base. Prior to renewal of the
         Driving/Fuel Permit conduct a local check of the individual’s driving records to ensure the
         individual has not had his or her driving privileges suspended or revoked. British Road Act
         requires the following minimum ages for vehicle operation:

Table 2.1. (Added-USAFE) Minimum Ages For Vehicle Operation in the UK.


          Motorcycle                                                             16 years
          Passenger, small goods vehicle or agricultural tractor                 17 years
          Medium sized goods vehicle                                             18 years
          Other motor vehicles                                                   21 years

         2.1.1.2.2. (Added-USAFE) (UK ONLY). Do not issue a learner’s permit to any learner
         driver without the applicant first obtaining an UK provisional license (Learners Permit), from
         a British post office. Learner drivers must have a British “L” plate displayed on the front and
         rear of the vehicle while the learner is operating the vehicle. Learner drivers of four-wheeled
         vehicles must be supervised by someone who is 21years of age and has held a full UK driver’s
         license for at least 3 years. Learner drivers of two-wheeled vehicles must comply with British
         law regarding two wheeled vehicle operation. Applicants without a civilian license endorse-
         ment allowing operation of a two-wheeled vehicle must obtain such an endorsement or British
         learners permit prior to issue of a Driving/Fuel Permit. In any cases in which a British provi-
         sional license is the basis for issue of a Driving/Fuel Permit, overstamp the form “LEARN-
         ERS PERMIT” and show the UK provisional license number and expiration date. The form is
         valid for use only as long as the licensee operates in accordance with all UK requirements per-
         taining to the use of the provisional license.
      2.1.1.3. If required by the jurisdiction in which the vehicle is operated, a valid record of motor
      vehicle safety inspection, emission control test, or any other test, evaluation, safety inspection, or
      other documents required by local, state, or host nation law or agreement. Note: In some
      instances, a state or other governing jurisdiction in which a vehicle is registered may require, as a
      condition for keeping registration/plates issued by that state or jurisdiction, a safety or other
      inspection even when the vehicle is operated in another state or jurisdiction. Though not enforce-
      able (in another state), failure to comply may invalidate the vehicle registration leaving the owner/
      operator in a precarious legal position. In such cases, it becomes the owner's responsibility to
      comply with their "home state" or other issuing jurisdiction requirements in addition to host state
      requirements. Owners should secure host registration when unable to comply with licensing and/
      or registration requirements issued by their home state or other jurisdiction.
AFI31-204_USAFESUP_I 5 JANUARY 2006                                                                      9


      2.1.1.3. (USAFE) (UK ONLY). Vehicle operators have 72 hours after request to provide safety
      and registration documentation. All POVs registered on base will receive a one-time vehicle
      safety inspection prior to registration. Non-European Union vehicles less than 3 years old will
      undergo a one-time means-of-transportation (MOT) inspection. Vehicles over 3 years require an
      annual Ministry of Transport (MoT) inspection. The age of British specification vehicles is deter-
      mined from the date of registration on the Form V5. Determine the age of an imported vehicle,
      month and year, by the manufacture sticker on the driver’s door skin. If the age cannot be deter-
      mined, a full MOT inspection is required. Proof of a satisfactorily completed inspection must be
      presented upon registration.
      2.1.1.4. Proof of current vehicle insurance when required by state, host nation, or the installation
      commander.
      2.1.1.4. (USAFE) (UK ONLY). Vehicle operators will produce insurance documents within 72
      hours of request by proper authorities. All personnel will, at a minimum, maintain liability insur-
      ance coverage according to the requirements of the UK Road Traffic Act of 1988. No individual
      shall allow any other individual to operate his or her POV unless the vehicle and proposed opera-
      tor are properly insured and licensed.

2.2. Stopping and Inspecting Personnel or Vehicles.
   2.2.1. The security police may stop vehicles on military installations based on the installation com-
   mander's authority. The following principles govern the stopping of motor vehicles:
      2.2.1.1. In overseas areas, security police may stop, search, and detain vehicles on or off base as
      determined by host nation agreements and local command policy.
      2.2.1.1. (USAFE) In areas where off-base patrols are authorized, patrols will not engage in the
      enforcement of host nation laws against non-US personnel operating vehicles bearing non-US
      license plates.
      2.2.1.2. AFI 31-209, The Air Force Resource Protection Program, local command instructions,
      and policies established by the installation commander will detail stop, inspection, search, and
      impoundment of motor vehicles at CONUS installation entry gates and in Air Force restricted
      areas.
      2.2.1.3. On-base traffic stops and inspections (other than at entry gates and restricted areas) of
      POVs is authorized when there is a reasonable basis to believe it’s necessary to enforce a traffic
      regulation or when there is suspicion of criminal activity.
   2.2.2. MAJCOMs responsible for overseas military installations must provide their installation com-
   manders with written guidelines governing stop, inspection, search, and impoundment of vehicles.
   This guidance must reflect host nation agreements and pass appropriate legal review. Note: A theater
   commander or those commanding unified forces may direct policy covering all installations under
   their command. In this case, MAJCOMs must review those policies before issuing their guidance.
   2.2.2. (USAFE) Traffic stops and inspections (at entry gate and restricted areas) of POVs are autho-
   rized when there is a reasonable belief it is necessary to enforce a traffic regulation or when there is
   suspicion of criminal activity. Vehicles may be impounded when there is a safety hazard, as evidence,
   or as abandoned property. Coordinate all searches and impoundments with the local Staff Judge Advo-
   cate.

2.3. Implied Consent to Blood, Breath, or Urine Tests. Drivers give consent to evidential tests for
alcohol or other drug content of their blood, breath, and/or urine as a condition to accepting installation
driving privileges. This consent applies when lawfully detained, apprehended, or cited for any impaired
driving offense committed while driving or in physical control of a motor vehicle on an Air Force instal-
lation.

2.4. Implied Consent to Vehicle Impoundment. As a condition to accepting installation driving privi-
leges, drivers must give their consent for the removal and temporary impoundment of their POV if their
POV is: 1) Illegally parked for unreasonable periods; 2) Interferes with traffic operations; 3) Creates a
safety hazard; 4) Disabled by accident or incident; 5) Left unattended in, or adjacent to, a restricted, con-
trolled, or off-limits area; and 6) Abandoned. Drivers also agree to reimburse an authorized agency or
contractor for the cost of towing, storage, and disposal should a need arise to remove or impound their
motor vehicle because of a situation described above.
     2.4.1. Installation commanders define in local procedures or supplement to this instruction, the defi-
     nitions for "unreasonable periods," "abandoned," and other terms relevant to enforcement action
     under paragraph 2.4. Incorporate those instructions, procedures, and definitions into the local instal-
     lation traffic code and make them known to the general public.

2.5. Suspension or Revocation of Driving Privileges . Installation commanders may suspend or
revoke installation driving privileges and POV registration for lawful reasons both related and unrelated
to traffic violations or safe vehicle operations. Installation commanders must incorporate procedures gov-
erning suspension and revocation in local publications or supplement to this instruction. Make these
known to the general public.
2.5. (USAFE) Suspension or Revocation of Driving Privileges. (UK ONLY). Rules of the road and
installation traffic regulations should conform to the Road Traffic Act of 1988 to the greatest extent possi-
ble. British civilians employed on the installation, and guilty of a traffic offense, are referred to the Royal
Air Force (RAF) commander for disposition. After consultation with the RAF commander, the United
States Air Force (USAF) installation commander, or designee, is authorized to withdraw installation iden-
tification credentials in serious cases or in the event of repeated infractions. British civilians not employed
on the installation, and guilty of a traffic offense, are cautioned at the scene and released. Units will estab-
lish procedures to track the vehicle data and, if possible, the individual’s personal data. Notify the RAF
commander of repeat offenders upon accumulation of maximum points. In the event of an uncooperative
individual at the scene, security forces will escort the individual from the installation. British civilians
involved in serious traffic offenses (i.e., driving under the influence) can be detained and released to civil
authorities, through the Ministry of Defense Police (MDP), if available, for prosecution under the Crimi-
nal Justice Act. Civilians obstructing, hindering, or otherwise interfering with security force members
engaged in sentry, patrol or other duties related to controlling or securing prohibited areas, as defined by
the Official Secrets Act, Section 3, may be detained and released to civil authorities through the MDP.
     2.5.1. Suspensions.
        2.5.1.1. Installation commanders can suspend driving privileges for serious violations or when
        lesser measures fail to improve a driver's performance. The commander may also suspend or
        revoke licenses for up to 12 months if a driver continually violates installation parking standards,
        or habitually violates other standards considered non-moving in nature. Installation commanders
        determine suspension and revocation policy for non-moving violations, as well as what constitutes
AFI31-204_USAFESUP_I 5 JANUARY 2006                                                                    11


     a non-moving violation on their installation (i.e., performing unauthorized repair; failure to regis-
     ter; unauthorized modifications or alterations; failure to maintain safety standards, etc.). Make
     these standards part of the local installation traffic code and take reasonable steps to make them
     known to the general public.
     2.5.1.2. The installation commander has discretionary authority and may withdraw anyone's
     authorization to operate a government or privately owned motor vehicle on the installation.
     2.5.1.3. Installation commanders will immediately suspend installation GOV or POV driving
     privileges pending resolution of an intoxicated driving incident which involves active duty mili-
     tary personnel, their family members, retired members of the military service, and DoD civilian
     personnel. This applies regardless of the geographic location of an intoxicated driving incident.
     Installation commanders can only suspend privileges of non-DoD affiliated civilians for incidents
     occurring on the installation or in the areas subject to their military traffic jurisdiction. After a
     review of available evidence as specified in paragraph 2.6., suspend driver’s privileges pending
     resolution of the intoxicated driving incident under the circumstances outlined below:
         2.5.1.3.1. Refusal to take or complete a lawfully requested chemical test to determine blood
         alcohol content BAC) or breath alcohol content (BrAC) for alcohol or other drugs.
         2.5.1.3.2. Operating a motor vehicle with BAC or BrAC of 0.10 percent by volume or higher.
         2.5.1.3.3. Operating a motor vehicle with a BAC or BrAC below 0.10 percent blood alcohol
         by volume if the jurisdiction in which the vehicle is operated imposes a suspension for a BAC
         or BrAC level below 0.10.
         2.5.1.3.4. On an arrest report or other official document reasonably showing an intoxicated
         driving incident occurred.
     2.5.1.4. (Added-USAFE) (UK ONLY). Unit commanders may schedule personnel for remedial
     training (Traffic Safety Course V, Driver Improvement Program), whenever he or she feels the
     training would be beneficial to the individual. Notify the security forces of course completion by
     the base safety office and enter the completion date in the remarks section of the driver’s records.
     Address specific base requirements for remedial drivers’ training program in local instructions to
     this supplement. Consider an individual for remedial training when the individual is found to be at
     fault in any vehicle accident involving personal injury. Also consider remedial training when the
     individual is the subject of an accident investigation board, the unit commander determines that
     the individual needs the training, or prior to restoration of driving privileges following a suspen-
     sion or revocation period due to an accumulation of points, unless suspended strictly for non-mov-
     ing violations.
  2.5.2. Revocation.
     2.5.2.1. The installation commander will immediately revoke driving privileges for a period of
     not less than one year in the following circumstances:
         2.5.2.1.1. A person is lawfully detained for intoxicated driving and refuses to submit to or
         complete tests to measure blood alcohol or drug content as required by the law of the jurisdic-
         tion, installation traffic code, or this instruction.

            2.5.2.1.2. A conviction, nonjudicial punishment, or a military or civilian administrative action
            resulting in the suspension or revocation of a driver’s license for intoxicated driving. Official
            documentation is required as the basis for this type of revocation action.
            2.5.2.1.3. When a serious incident involving a motor vehicle occurs and the installation com-
            mander determines immediate revocation of driving privileges is required to preserve public
            safety or the good order and discipline of military personnel.
        2.5.2.2. The CSP develops plans and procedures to forward revocation, suspension, and driving
        records to gaining commanders and to initiate appropriate staff action when receiving similar
        records from losing commanders of inbound personnel.
        2.5.2.3. When temporary suspensions are followed by revocations, compute the revocation period
        from the original suspension date, exclusive of any period during which full driving privileges
        were restored pending resolution of charges.
        2.5.2.4. Installation commanders may impose multiple suspensions to run consecutively or con-
        currently.

2.6. Reciprocal Procedures.
     2.6.1. Air Force installation commanders will honor revocations issued by other installation com-
     manders regardless of service component affiliation. Revocations remain in effect during reassign-
     ment unless the issuing authority terminates the revocation before reassignment. Installation
     commander may honor suspensions as determined on a case by case basis. Anyone with suspended or
     revocated privileges may petition an installation commander for partial or limited driving privileges.

2.7. Administrative Due Process for Suspensions and Revocations.
     2.7.1. When considering suspending or revoking someone’s driving privileges, notify that person in
     writing and tell them what action you are taking and the reason for it. Coordinate this notice with the
     base legal office.
     2.7.2. Except for incidents outlined in para 2.5.1.3. and 2.5.2.1., do not suspend or revoke a person's
     driving privileges until they are notified (or reasonable attempts made) and offered an administrative
     hearing. Installation commanders determine when a suspension or revocation takes effect once mak-
     ing or attempting this written notice. Only in unusual circumstances should you make verbal notifica-
     tions. Unless an application for a hearing is made within the prescribed period, suspension or
     revocation takes place on the prescribed date and time. Installation commanders determine the time
     period for staying a suspension or revocation action after receiving a request for a administrative hear-
     ing. For offenses outlined in para 2.5.1.3. and 2.5.2.1., an installation commander will authorize an
     immediate preliminary suspension based on reliable evidence. Such evidence can include witness
     statements, a military or civilian police report, chemical test results, a refusal to complete chemical
     testing, video tapes, written statements, field sobriety test results, or other evidence.
        2.7.2.1. Installation commanders or their designee must conduct evidence reviews as soon as pos-
        sible, but no later than three duty days following final assembly of evidence.
        2.7.2.2. For active duty military personnel, send a written notice of preliminary suspension for
        intoxicated driving to their commander or reasonable equivalent. For non-installation, non-DoD
        affiliated civilians, present the written notice of preliminary suspension for intoxicated driving
AFI31-204_USAFESUP_I 5 JANUARY 2006                                                                      13


     either in person (preferred) or by certified mail. If the person is employed on the installation, send
     the notice to their commander or reasonable equivalent.
     2.7.2.3. Advise the individual of the following in the preliminary suspension notification for
     intoxicated driving:
         2.7.2.3.1. Suspension can be made a revocation under the authority of paragraph 2.5.2. of this
         AFI.
         2.7.2.3.2. The right to request restoration of driving privileges pending investigation or reso-
         lution of the incident (direct request letters to the installation commander or designee).
         2.7.2.3.3. The right of military personnel to present evidence and witnesses and be repre-
         sented by a civilian counsel (at their own expense) or assigned military counsel. Commanders
         determine the availability of specific (by name) military counsel requests.
         2.7.2.3.4. The right of DoD civilian employees to have a personal representative present at the
         administrative hearing in accordance with applicable laws and instructions.
         2.7.2.3.5. Amount of time the individual has to respond and request the administrative hearing
         before the preliminary suspension or revocation becomes permanent.
         2.7.2.3.6. Direction to sign the acknowledgment of receipt and to return the signed letter to
         the address shown in the letter.
         2.7.2.3.7. Requested hearings must take place within a reasonable period which is determined
         by the installation commander. A preliminary suspension for intoxicated driving remains in
         effect until the installation commander makes a final decision. However, if no decision is
         made within 30 days of the preliminary suspension or revocation, restore full driving privi-
         leges until the accused is notified of the final hearing results.
  2.7.3. Hearings for intoxicated driving will cover only the pertinent issues of whether: 1) The law
  enforcement official had reasonable grounds to believe the person was driving or was in physical con-
  trol of a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or other drugs; 2) The person was lawfully
  cited or apprehended for an intoxicated driving offense; 3) The person was asked to submit to a test for
  alcohol or other drug content of blood, breath, or urine and was informed of the consequences for
  refusing to take or complete such a test; 4) The person refused to submit to the test for alcohol, breath,
  or urine; failed to complete the test; submitted to the test and the result exceeded the amount of
  allowed blood alcohol content; results indicate the presence of other drugs for an on-installation
  apprehension or in violation of state laws for an off-installation apprehension; and 5) The testing
  methods used were valid and reliable, and the results accurately recorded and evaluated.
     2.7.3.1. For revocation actions under paragraph 2.5.2.1. for intoxicated driving, the revocation is
     mandatory on conviction or other findings that confirm the charge.
         2.7.3.1.1. The date of conviction or other findings that confirm the charge is the effective date
         of the revocation.
         2.7.3.1.2. You may place the notice that revocation is automatic in the suspension letter, or
         send a separate letter. Revocation is not effective until receipt of the written notice, or the
         showing that you made reasonable attempts to notify the individual.

            2.7.3.1.3. Revocations cancel any partial or restricted driving privileges previously granted.
            Once revocation is acknowledged, a person may petition for the restoration of all or partial
            driving privileges.

2.8. Alcohol and Drug Abuse Programs.
     2.8.1. Refer military personnel involved in any intoxicated (drug or alcohol) motor vehicle incident to
     Substance Abuse Office, Drug and Alcohol Control for evaluation.
     2.8.2. (Added-USAFE) The director of base medical services will notify security forces whenever
     competent medical authority has recommended an individual be medically disqualified from driving,
     or has been identified as a problem drinker or drug abuser to the extent which renders him or her inca-
     pable of safely operating a motor vehicle. The installation commander will consider such individuals
     for suspension or revocation.

2.9. Restoration of Driving Privileges on Acquittal. When an official report or finding determines
lack of guilt (not guilty) or when charges are dismissed or reduced to an offense not amounting to intoxi-
cated driving, vacate the suspension of driving privileges except when:
     2.9.1. The preliminary suspension was based on refusal to take a BAC test.
     2.9.2. Operating a motor vehicle with a BAC of 0.10 percent by volume or higher or in violation of
     the law of the jurisdiction that is bring assimilated on the military installation.
     2.9.3. The person was driving or in physical control of a motor vehicle while under another prelimi-
     nary suspension or revocation.
     2.9.4. The state or host nation authorities made an administrative determination to suspend or revoke
     driving privileges based on local law or pertinent regulations.
     2.9.5. The individual failed to complete a formally directed substance abuse or driver’s training pro-
     gram.

2.10. Restricted Driving Privileges or Probation.
     2.10.1. Unless prohibited by higher authority, host nation authority, or other publication, installation
     commanders may authorize partial or restricted driving privileges to those whose authority to drive on
     military installations was suspended or revocated by a military service authority. Ensure the individ-
     ual’s driving credentials (civilian state, international, host nation, etc.) are still valid.
     2.10.1. (USAFE) Requests to allow operation of a government vehicle during a period of suspension
     or revocation must be justified by the unit commander as mission essential.
     2.10.2. Without due cause, do not grant restricted driving privileges, probation, or reinstatement to
     any person whose civilian driver’s license is under suspension or revocation by a state, federal, or host
     nation licensing authority. If absolutely necessary to do so (and for on base privileges only), coordi-
     nate with the installation staff judge advocate. Note: This option applies only to installations exercis-
     ing exclusive military jurisdiction. Outline procedures for applying for partial or restricted privileges
     in the base supplement to this AFI or in another appropriate publication. Only consider requests in
     which there is extreme hardship and there are no other workable alternatives. Do not consider the
     granting of limited privileges as an alternative to administrative discharge action when discharge is
     the more appropriate action. Installation commanders must weigh heavily the potential liability
AFI31-204_USAFESUP_I 5 JANUARY 2006                                                                        15


   inherent when an individual with a suspended or revoked state, host nation, or other license is
   allowed to operate a motor vehicle on the installation. Administrative separation may be appropri-
   ate when the loss of driving privileges renders someone ineffective and incapable of performing their
   military duties, and a change in duty position is not reasonable.
   2.10.3. (Added-USAFE) When an individual is authorized restricted driving privileges, the individ-
   ual will provide a copy of the limitation letter to the security forces. The individual will keep a copy
   of the limitation letter with him or her or in the vehicle while operating it. This letter must be produced
   upon demand by proper authorities. Limited privileges must be specific, indicating type of limitation,
   and the date and time the privileges are reinstated. If the suspension or revocation was the result of
   host nation court action, close coordination is required with the Staff Judge Advocate’s office regard-
   ing any restricted driving privileges.

2.11. Extensions of Suspensions and Revocations.
   2.11.1. Increase by two years the suspension or revocation period when someone is discovered driv-
   ing in violation of their original suspension or revocation. The unit or installation commander may
   also take administrative or disciplinary action.
   2.11.2. Extend the suspension or revocation of installation driving privileges until the offender com-
   pletes an approved remedial driver training course, drug or alcohol program, or other program deemed
   necessary by the installation commander or local authorities.

2.12. Reciprocal State-Military Action.
   2.12.1. Statutory authority may exist within some host nations or states for reciprocal suspension and
   revocation of driving privileges. If so, the installation commander should honor the reciprocal agree-
   ments with the state or host nation driver licensing authorities. On receipt of written notice, the
   receiving party may suspend or revoke driving privileges as if the violations or incidents occurred
   within its own jurisdiction.
       2.12.1.1. Use the following procedures if statutory authority does not provide for formal military
       reciprocity:
          2.12.1.1.1. When such authority suspends or revokes a license, automatically terminate the
          individual’s installation GOV and POV driving privileges. Take only comparable military
          administrative actions (suspensions, revocation, or point assessment) for those off-base viola-
          tions reported by local, state, or host nation authorities.
          2.12.1.1.2. In the CONUS, notify the licensing authority of the state where a license is issued
          when revoking a person’s installation driving privileges (for a period of one year or more only)
          following final adjudication of an intoxicated driving offense or for refusal to submit to a
          BAC/BrAC test. Include in the notification the basis for the revocation and the BAC/BrAC
          level.
   2.12.2. Provisions of the applicable status of forces agreement (SOFA) and the law of the host nation
   concerning reciprocal suspension and revocation can affect OCONUS installation commanders.
   When permitted at a particular overseas installation and to the extent an agreement concerning reci-
   procity exists, the installation commander must have prior authorization to negotiate and conclude
   such an international agreement in accordance with applicable directives.

full British license are also required to obtain a Driving/Fuel Permit prior to registering a POV on US
military bases. Note: US contractors and contractor employees (“tech reps”) have no special status con-
ferred by the NATO SOFA or British domestic law regarding driving licenses. The Driving/Fuel Permit
issued to “tech reps” does not function as a valid British driving license. Issuing authorities will over-
stamp the Driving/Fuel Permit in red with the words “NOT A VALID U.K. DRIVING LICENSE.
   3.2.1. A valid state, overseas command, host nation or international driver’s license (within appropri-
   ate classification), supported by identification authorizing base entry.
   3.2.2. A certificate of state registration as required by the state in which the vehicle is registered.
   3.2.3. Proof of compliance with the minimum requirements of the automobile insurance laws or reg-
   ulations of the state, host nation, or command.

nel and vehicles on a temporary basis. It is issued to installation visitors who do not have the authorized
credentials needed for unescorted or unchecked entry to the base. Installation commanders determine the
use of AF Forms 75 on their installation and, if used, to what degree and to whom issued. Issue other
access credentials when a pass is needed for longer than one year. Installation commanders determine if
and how to retrieve passes once the visit is finished.

3.6. Handicapped Person Identification. Honor local and state-issued handicap decals, placards, signs,
etc. on all Air Force installations. The installation commander may authorize issue of a locally devised
card or form, which should contain an issue and expiration date. Issue and display per local procedure.

                                                  Chapter 4

                                  TRAFFIC PLANNING AND CODES

4.1. Traffic Planning
     4.1.1. Safe and efficient movement of traffic on an installation requires traffic supervision. A strong
     traffic supervision program includes sound traffic circulation planning, supervision, and control of
     motor vehicle traffic. Proactive publication and enforcement of traffic laws and regulations together
     with timely and professional investigation of motor vehicle accidents are also important. Finally,
     every successful program must include meaningful interaction, education, and communication with
     the general public.
     4.1.2. Installation commanders develop traffic circulation plans that provide for the safest and most
     efficient use of primary and secondary roads. A major focus of installation traffic planning is circula-
     tion control. The base traffic engineer, CSP, safety officer, and other concerned staff agencies develop
     the traffic circulation plan. Consult with highway engineering representatives from adjacent civilian
     communities to ensure the installation plan is compatible with plans developed by the state and sur-
     rounding local communities. As a minimum, your base traffic plan should consider the following:
        4.1.2.1. Normal and peak load routing based on traffic control studies.
        4.1.2.2. Effective control of traffic, using planned traffic flow patterns which include measures
        for special events and adverse road conditions.
        4.1.2.3. Point control at congested locations by law enforcement personnel or designated traffic
        directors or wardens, including trained school-crossing guards.
        4.1.2.4. Use of traffic control signs and devices.
        4.1.2.5. Efficient use of available parking facilities.
        4.1.2.6. Efficient use of mass transportation.
        4.1.2.7. Every installation commander should appoint a primary and alternate base traffic engi-
        neer. The engineer directs, develops, and staffs the base traffic circulation plan. This is normally
        a civil engineering responsibility and those considered for the position should have an infrastruc-
        ture planning and engineering background.
     4.1.3. Traffic control studies provide factual data on existing roads, traffic density and flow patterns,
     and points of congestion. The CSP and traffic engineer usually conduct coordinated traffic control
     studies to obtain the data. Accurate data helps determine major and minor routes, locations for traffic
     control devices, and special conditions requiring engineering or enforcement services.
     4.1.4. The Military Traffic Management Command Transportation Engineering Agency (MTMC-
     TEA) will help installation commanders solve complex highway traffic engineering problems. MTM-
     CTEA traffic engineering team services include:
        4.1.4.1. Traffic studies of lifted areas and other special situations.
        4.1.4.2. Complete studies of traffic operations of entire installations.
        4.1.4.3. Assistance in complying with established traffic engineering standards.
AFI31-204_USAFESUP_I 5 JANUARY 2006                                                                     19


   4.1.5. Installation commanders submit requests for MTMCTEA assistance in accordance with AFR
   75-88, Highways for National Defense.

4.2. Installation Traffic Codes.
   4.2.1. Installation commanders must establish a traffic code for operation of motor vehicles on the
   installation. Commanders in overseas areas establish a traffic code to the extent military authority is
   empowered to regulate traffic under applicable treaties or agreements. Installation traffic codes must
   contain the base rules of the road and will, to the degree possible, conform to the code of the state or
   host nation in which the installation is located. The CSP is responsible for developing the traffic code
   and for ensuring it meets all local and legal requirements, this AFI, and the standards published in the
   following:
       4.2.1.1. The National Highway Safety Program Standards, as published in 23, CFR 1230.
       4.2.1.2. Applicable portions of the Uniform Vehicle Code and Model Traffic Ordinance published
       by the National Committee on Uniform Traffic Laws and Ordinances, which is contained in 23,
       CFR 1204.
       4.2.1.3. DoDI 6055.4, DoD Traffic Safety Program.
       4.2.1.4. (Added-USAFE) (UK ONLY). Use the Road Traffic Act of 1988, Public Passenger Vehi-
       cles Act of 1981, and Transport Act of 1985 as guidelines for US base traffic codes.
   4.2.2. The installation traffic code must contain policy and procedures for the towing, searching,
   impounding, and inventorying of vehicles. Publish these provisions and ensure they contain the fol-
   lowing:
       4.2.2.1. Violations and conditions to tow or impound a vehicle.
       4.2.2.2. Procedures to notify the vehicle owner.
       4.2.2.3. Procedures for towing, storing, and protecting impounded vehicles.
       4.2.2.4. Procedures for disposing of vehicles after lawful impoundment.
   4.2.3. Where applicable, installation traffic codes must supplement the various basic provisions con-
   tained in the subparagraphs below:
       4.2.3.1. Motorcycles and mopeds. Operators must comply with special requirements when driv-
       ing motorcycles, mopeds, or other open two-, three-, and four-wheel vehicles powered by a motor-
       cycle-type engine. See paragraph 4.2.6. for information concerning off-road vehicle use.
       Installations should adopt local, state, or host nation guidance concerning the legal definition,
       operation, use, and control of mopeds, motorized bicycles, and other such devices on installation
       roadways. Such guidelines will be modified or restricted as necessary to ensure personal safety or
       the safe and orderly flow of installation traffic. Refer to AFI 91-207 for helmet, eye, and clothing
       safety requirements.
       4.2.3.2. Restraint systems.
          4.2.3.2.1. Operators and passengers of all vehicles operated on Air Force installations must
          wear restraint systems. In addition, operators and passengers of GOVs must wear restraint
          systems when driving or riding off the installation as well.
20                                                         AFI31-204_USAFESUP_I 5 JANUARY 2006


            4.2.3.2.2. All Air Force active duty and reserve component members on active duty must
            wear restraint systems while driving or riding in a POV whether on or off the installation.
            4.2.3.2.3. US Department of Transportation requires approved infant/child restraint devices in
            POVs for children 4 years old or under and not exceeding 50 pounds in weight.
            4.2.3.2.4. Cars manufactured after model year 1966 require a manufacturer-approved restraint
            system meeting federal traffic safety standards.
            4.2.3.2.5. Operators using vehicles equipped with air bags must still wear the manufacturer's
            primary restraint system (seat belts).
        4.2.3.3. Headphones and earphones. The wearing of headphones and earphones is prohibited
        while driving a motor vehicle on base. This does not negate wearing of hearing protection when
        conditions and good judgment dictate its use such as when driving in noise hazard areas. This
        restriction does not apply to intercom systems worn by motorcycle operators and their passengers.
     4.2.4. Take only administrative actions (reprimand, assessment of points, loss of installation driving
     privileges, etc.) for off-installation violations of the installation traffic code.
     4.2.5. At bases with concurrent or exclusive federal jurisdiction, make violations of state traffic codes
     applicable to base driving records when those violations are included in that state’s criminal offense
     code. This provision is covered under the authority of Title 18 United States Code 13 (USC).
        4.2.5.1. DoDD 5525.4, Enforcement of State Traffic Laws on DoD Installations, adopts the vehic-
        ular and pedestrian traffic laws of states where traffic law violations are not considered criminal
        offenses and cannot be assimilated under 18 USC. It makes these laws applicable to military
        installations having concurrent or exclusive federal jurisdiction. It also delegates authority to
        installation commanders to establish additional vehicular and pedestrian traffic rules and regula-
        tions for their installations. Those found guilty of violating traffic laws made applicable on instal-
        lations under provisions of DoDD 5525.4 are subject to a fine of not more than $50 or
        imprisonment for not more than 30 days or both for each violation. In those states where you can-
        not assimilate traffic laws, post an extracted copy of this paragraph and a copy of DoDD 5525.4 in
        a prominent place accessible to persons assigned, living, or working on the installation.
            4.2.5.1.1. Take only administrative actions in states where you cannot assimilate violations of
            traffic laws under either Title 18 USC 13 or DoDD 5525.4. Generally, this applies to installa-
            tions under part or full proprietary jurisdiction.
     4.2.6. Off-road vehicles usage: The installation commander or his or her designee determines if,
     when, and where off-road vehicles may be operated on base. In many areas, the operation of off-road
     vehicles is unregulated while other jurisdictions have strict requirements concerning age, safety train-
     ing, and vehicle equipment. Generally, some "on-street" safety practices such as reflective vests,
     gloves, headlight on, and goggles may not apply when operating off road in a recreational capacity.
     However, ensure full compliance with local, state, or host nation requirements. When necessary,
     develop additional procedures and guidance locally and publish in the installation traffic safety plan or
     supplement to this instruction. Ensure environmental considerations are reviewed prior to designating
     any off-road vehicle use area.

4.3. Traffic Law Enforcement Principles.
AFI31-204_USAFESUP_I 5 JANUARY 2006                                                                     21


   4.3.1. Traffic law enforcement should motivate drivers to operate vehicles safely within traffic laws
   and regulations and maintain an effective and efficient flow of traffic. Effective enforcement should
   emphasize selective enforcement and voluntary compliance by drivers. You can reach these goals by
   developing effective programs in the following areas.
      4.3.1.1. Publishing a realistic traffic code well known by all personnel.
      4.3.1.2. Adopting standard signs, markings, and signals in accordance with National Highway
      Safety Program Standards (NHSPS) and the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for
      Streets and Highways.
      4.3.1.3. Ensuring enforcement personnel establish courteous, personal contact with drivers, and
      act promptly when driving behavior is improper or when observing a defective vehicle in opera-
      tion.
      4.3.1.4. Maintain an aggressive program to detect and apprehend those who drive with suspended
      or revoked privileges.
      4.3.1.5. Use sound discretion and judgment in deciding when to apprehend, issue a citation, or
      warn the offender.
   4.3.2. Enforcement activities against intoxicated driving will include:
      4.3.2.1. Detecting, apprehending, and testing persons suspected of driving under the influence of
      alcohol or drugs.
      4.3.2.2. Training law enforcement personnel in special enforcement standards, detection tech-
      niques, and equipment standards unique to your location and jurisdiction.
      4.3.2.3. Enforcing blood-alcohol concentration standards (see paragraph 4.11.).
      4.3.2.4. Denying installation driving privileges to those whose use of alcohol or drugs prevents
      their safe operation of a motor vehicle.

4.4. Speed-measuring Devices. Use speed-measuring devices in traffic control studies and enforce-
ment programs. Post signs to indicate the use of speed-measuring devices.
   4.4.1. Equipment purchases. Installations located in states having a formal civilian police training
   and certification program for speed measurement should consider purchasing the same brand and
   model of equipment used by their civilian counterparts. Where possible, attend the same or similar
   certification courses used by local authorities.
   4.4.2. Training and certification standards.
      4.4.2.1. The CSP should strive to ensure operators of speed-measuring devices meet training and
      certification requirements prescribed by the state or jurisdiction where the installation is located.
      Obtain specific information on course dates, costs, and prerequisites for attending by contacting
      the state agency responsible for police traffic radar training. Notwithstanding the above informa-
      tion, the CSP may establish other local training and certification programs for operators of
      speed-measuring devices. If exercising this option, you must ensure your qualification and train-
      ing standards are admissible as evidence and considered reliable by both military and civil author-
      ities. This requirement applies to courts-martial, nonjudicial proceedings, and civilian courts used

        to prosecute civilian offenders. Coordination between the military staff judge advocate and attor-
        ney general (or equivalent) is necessary.
        4.4.2.2. Develop local training programs or attend a civilian institution or manufacturer's training
        program if security police are unable to attend local or state-sponsored radar certification courses.
        4.4.2.3. The objective of civilian or manufacturer-sponsored courses is to improve the effective-
        ness of speed enforcement through the proper and efficient use of speed-measurement radar. On
        successful completion, the course graduate must know how to:
            4.4.2.3.1. Describe the association between excessive speed and accidents, deaths, and inju-
            ries, and describe the traffic safety benefits of effective speed control.
            4.4.2.3.2. Describe the basic principles of radar speed measurement.
            4.4.2.3.3. Identify and describe Air Force speed measurement and speed enforcement policy
            and procedure.
            4.4.2.3.4. Identify the specific radar instrument used and describe the instrument’s major
            components and functions.
            4.4.2.3.5. Demonstrate basic skills in calibrating and operating the specific radar instru-
            ment(s).
            4.4.2.3.6. Demonstrate basic skills in preparing and presenting records and courtroom testi-
            mony relating to radar speed measurement and enforcement.
     4.4.3. Recertification. Certify operators every three years or more frequently when required by the
     state or governing jurisdiction. The CSP must document and maintain certification and training stan-
     dards in the unit training section. Forward records to gaining unit commanders when personnel PCS.
     4.4.4. Use the following sources in local training and certification programs:
        4.4.4.1. State or local training guides, plans, and procedures.
        4.4.4.2. Publish techniques for radar speed detection and legal aspects of speed-measuring
        devices by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the International Association
        of Directors of Law Enforcement Standards and Training.

4.5. Traffic Accident Investigation.
     4.5.1. Conduct detailed investigations of the following:
        4.5.1.1. All accidents involving a fatality or personal injury.
        4.5.1.2. Vehicle and private property damage over the amount specified by the installation com-
        mander. This applies to government as well as private vehicles and property damage; however,
        the installation commander may establish different damage amounts for each category.
     4.5.2. Conduct investigations of off-installation accidents involving military personnel according to
     local policy developed by the CSP and local police leaders.
NOTE: Generally, a detailed accident investigation includes, but is not limited to, an accident report
form, field sketch, scale diagram, and accident narrative.

4.6. Traffic Accident Investigation Reports.
AFI31-204_USAFESUP_I 5 JANUARY 2006                                                                       23


  4.6.1. Anyone involved in an on-base vehicle accident must immediately report the incident to the
  security police. Report off-base accidents to the security police if they involve injuries to military per-
  sonnel or damage to military property. The installation commander determines what agencies to notify
  and for what type of accidents to notify them. The CSP must develop a local notification matrix or
  other procedures that will ensure notification of appropriate base and civilian agencies. Develop and
  publish these notification procedures locally.
  4.6.1. (USAFE) (UK ONLY). When a vehicle accident occurs on base, except for notifying authori-
  ties, summoning medical aid, or receiving medical attention, all personnel involved in the accident
  will remain at the scene until released by security forces. Do not remove vehicles involved in the acci-
  dent unless they create a traffic hazard, endanger life, or are ordered moved by security forces person-
  nel.
  4.6.2. The security police will act as the focal point for gathering off-base accident information.
  Record the information in the security police desk blotter. When possible, obtain copies of major
  accident reports prepared by investigating civilian police agencies.
  4.6.3. Security police respond to all on-base major vehicle accidents (unless local conditions or poli-
  cies prohibit) to accomplish the following:
     4.6.3.1. Render first aid and arrange for medical assistance.
     4.6.3.2. Protect personal property.
     4.6.3.3. Normalize traffic.
     4.6.3.4. Identify witnesses and personnel involved.
     4.6.3.5. Conduct a formal investigation.
     4.6.3.6. The CSP determines (with installation commander approval) when and/or if minor vehi-
     cle accidents require investigation or a police response. He or she may delegate this authority to
     on-duty security police supervisory personnel. Develop policy in this area locally.
  4.6.4. Report minor accidents not involving a security police response to the security police within 72
  hours. Record accident information in the security police blotter. This information should include the
  accident type, time and date, location, name(s) of vehicle operator(s), unit (or address when civilian
  not affiliated with military), vehicle description, and license number(s). You should also include a
  brief summary of any damage and circumstances behind or causing the accident. A minor accident is
  any accident in which there are no fatalities/injuries or vehicle/property damage above the amount
  established by the installation commander. Consequently, a major accident is any accident involving
  a fatality, injury, or property damage above the amount established by the installation commander.
  The installation commander may set differing amounts for government versus private vehicle and
  property damage. The investigation of major accidents involve specialized accident investigative
  techniques to draw conclusions and opinions about how and why the accident occurred.
     4.6.4.1. Injury is defined as any one of the following caused or aggravated by a motor vehicle
     accident:
         4.6.4.1.1. Any condition requiring medical attention
         4.6.4.1.2. Complaint or report of pain or injury regardless if medical attention is sought
24                                                        AFI31-204_USAFESUP_I 5 JANUARY 2006


            4.6.4.1.3. Any visible injury. This includes bruises, contusions, cuts, scrapes, compression, or
            any other visible damage to the body.

4.7. Use of Traffic Accident Investigation Report Data.
     4.7.1. Analyze data derived from traffic accident investigations to determine accident causes. When
     frequent accidents occur in one area, analyze location conditions, type of accidents, and other factors
     in an attempt to isolate causes. With the exception of privacy act information, make accident data and
     trend analysis available to agencies requesting the data for reporting and analytical purposes. With the
     exception of requests filed under the Freedom of Information Act, the CSP determines the agencies
     cleared to receive accident and incident data.
     4.7.2. Law enforcement personnel and others who prepare traffic accident investigation reports will
     indicate if a seat restraint was used at the time of the accident, and where applicable, if air bags
     deployed.

4.8. Parking.
     4.8.1. Illegal parking contributes to congestion and slows traffic flow on the installation. Strong
     enforcement of parking rules results in better use of available parking while reducing traffic accidents
     and hazards. Combine enforcement with community education and awareness initiatives in areas
     where illegal parking is a problem. When education and awareness fail, installation commanders may
     authorize more serious enforcement measures such as towing and "booting" of vehicles. Do not use
     towing and booting if less severe means of enforcement such as warnings, ticketing, reprimands, revo-
     cations, etc., prove effective. When using towing and booting, follow the guidelines below:
        4.8.1.1. Publish operating instructions to control discretion of enforcers and limit towing or boot-
        ing to specific offenses.
        4.8.1.2. Focus on specific reasons for towing or booting. Booting is effective for immobilizing
        unsafe vehicles, or vehicles not inspected or registered. Use booting in high offense areas or to
        compel the presence of repeat offenders. Towing is more effective for moving vehicles that pose
        safety hazards. Some examples include double parking, and blocking fire hydrants and fire lanes.
        4.8.1.3. Notify drivers that certain violations or multiple violations may result in towing or boot-
        ing. Also, provide drivers a prompt opportunity to obtain release of their property.
        4.8.1.4. Warn drivers when a boot is attached to their vehicle and instruct them on how to have the
        boot removed without damaging the vehicle.
     4.8.2. Reserved Parking. When not addressed by MAJCOMs, installation commanders determine
     reserved parking policy for their installations. Number of available spaces, facility design and layout,
     traffic flow, and number of vehicles using facilities will help determine the number and location of
     reserved parking spaces. Make policy and procedures governing reserved parking a part of the instal-
     lation supplement to this instruction, separate traffic control instruction, or base parking plan. The
     publication must address approval, issue, control, and review of reserved parking and should give spe-
     cial consideration to bicycle, motorcycle, visitor, and car pool parking. Handicap parking is regulated
     under the uniform federal accessibility standards and applies to all Air Force installations.
        4.8.2.1. (Added-USAFE) Unless identified for specific individuals, post reserved parking at ser-
        vice facilities as General, Colonel, or Chief Master Sergeant.
AFI31-204_USAFESUP_I 5 JANUARY 2006                                                                       25


   4.8.3. You can use distinctive emblems, decals, stickers, etc., to control parking space assignments
   and to indicate authorized use of the parking slot. If this identification media is placed on a vehicle
   bumper, separate it from the vehicle registration identification. MAJCOMs (or installation command-
   ers if not addressed by the MAJCOM) may develop policy concerning the issue and control of the
   identification media discussed above.
   4.8.4. You can use parking wardens (unit personnel) to monitor and cite parking violators, especially
   within off-street parking facilities.

4.9. Traffic Violation Reports.
   4.9.1. Commanders should deal with most traffic violations occurring on Air Force installations
   within Air Force channels.
   4.9.2. You can refer traffic violations occurring on Air Force installations (within the United States or
   its territories) to the proper US Magistrate. Do not refer violations in the following circumstances:
       4.9.2.1. The operator is driving a government vehicle at the time of the violation.
       4.9.2.2. A US Federal Magistrate is either not available or lacks jurisdiction to hear the matter
       because the violation occurred in an area where the federal government has only proprietary legis-
       lative jurisdiction.
       4.9.2.3. Mission requirements make referral of offenders impractical.
       4.9.2.4. A US Magistrate is available, but the accused refuses to consent to the jurisdiction of the
       court and the US attorney refuses to process the case before a US district court.
   4.9.3. Issue traffic violators on military installations a DD Form 1408, Armed Forces Traffic Ticket,
   or a DD Form 1805, United States District Court Violation Notice. The CSP determines who is autho-
   rized to issue those forms and what training they must complete before issuing either form. The DD
   Form 1408 is issued to the following personnel: active duty personnel, Cadets/Midshipmen of the Mil-
   itary Academies to include the Coast Guard Academy, reservists on orders or performing inactive
   duty training including commuting to and from training, and guardsman in federal service under Title
   10 of the United States Code. Title 10 status is reflected on the guardsman’ s orders. Issue civilians the
   DD Form 1805, or the DD Form 1408 when a US Magistrate system is not available.”
   4.9.4. Installation commanders establish procedures for disposing of traffic violation cases through
   administrative or judicial action consistent with the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) and
   federal law. Additionally, forward a copy of all violation reports on military personnel and DoD civil-
   ian employees apprehended for intoxicated driving to the Substance Abuse Office, Drug and Alcohol
   Control.
   4.9.4. (USAFE) Military personnel arrested or apprehended by host nation police for traffic related
   offense must report this information to the security forces desk within 24 hours of the incident. Failure
   to report this contact is a violation of Article 92, UCMJ.
   4.9.5. Unless restricted under the provisions of para 4.9.2., use the DD Form 1805 to refer civilian
   violators of state and federal traffic laws to the appropriate US magistrate. Notify the commander,
   first sergeant, or supervisor when any military personnel or DoD civilian employees is cited with the
   DD Form 1805. If requested, locally reproduce a copy of the DD Form 1805 and make it available to
   the commander, first sergeant, or supervisor.

        4.9.5.1. Preparation of the DD Form 1805. This prenumbered form is issued through standard
        publication channels and is only accountable once it is issued to an offender. Before issuing this
        form, stamp (type) in black ink the specific address of the clerk of the US District Court (Central
        Violations Bureau) to which the violator must address the communication, on the reverse of the
        violator’s copy (manila card stock) of the four-part form. Determine the entry for the amount of
        the fine, mandatory court appearance of the offender, and the date of appearance according to
        guidance furnished by the governing district court.
        4.9.5.2. Identify the assimilation of state traffic laws by a specific state code reference in the
        CODE SECTION block of the DD Form 1805 or in a complaint filed with the US magistrate.
        4.9.5.3. Use the statement of probable cause on the DD Form 1805 according to local staff judge
        advocate and US magistrate court policy. The statement of probable cause is required by the fed-
        eral misdemeanor rules to support the issuance of a summons or arrest warrant.
        4.9.5.4. For cases referred to US magistrate, normal distribution of DD Form 1805 is as follows:
            4.9.5.4.1. The CSP forwards copy 1 (white) and copy 2 (yellow) to the US District Court
            (Central Violation Bureau).
            4.9.5.4.2. Security police file copy 3 (pink).
            4.9.5.4.3. Provide copy 4 (envelope) to the violator.
NOTE: Ensure unit personnel are notified IAW para 4.9.5. above.
        4.9.5.5. When DD Form 1408 is used, distribute the form as follows:
            4.9.5.5.1. Provide the pink copy to the violator with normal reporting instructions and rebuttal
            instructions as determined by the installation commander.
            4.9.5.5.2. Forward the white copy to the service member’s commander, to the commander of
            the family member’s sponsor, or to the civilian’s supervisor or employer for administrative
            action within the unit/organization.
            4.9.5.5.3. Forward the yellow copy to the security police administration branch for processing
            and tracking until the white "action copy" is returned by the unit commander, section com-
            mander, or first sergeant. When the white copy is received, review it for action taken, annotate
            the information in SPAS or the AF Form 1313, Driver Record, with the moving or non-mov-
            ing violation and any points assessed. File the white and yellow copies with the driver record.

4.10. Standards and Procedures for Processing Intoxicated Drivers.
     4.10.1. As a minimum, the CSP must train installation law enforcement personnel to do the follow-
     ing:
        4.10.1.1. Recognize signs of alcohol and other drug impairment in persons operating motor vehi-
        cles.
        4.10.1.2. Prepare DD Form 1920, Alcohol Influence Report, or other form which adequately
        documents sobriety and sobriety testing of an individual.
        4.10.1.3. Perform standard field sobriety tests. The standardized Air Force field sobriety test con-
        sists of the one leg stand, the walk and turn, and the horizontal gaze nystagmus. Also consider any
AFI31-204_USAFESUP_I 5 JANUARY 2006                                                                      27


      local, state, or host nation sobriety test requirements in addition to the above standard Air Force
      tests.
      4.10.1.4. Determine to a reasonable and practical degree when a person appears intoxicated, but
      is actually physically or mentally ill and requires prompt medical attention.
      4.10.1.5. Understand the operation of breath-testing devices.
   4.10.2. Each installation using breath-testing devices will ensure operators of these devices:
      4.10.2.1. Are chosen for integrity, maturity, and sound judgment.
      4.10.2.2. Meet installation, and where possible, state certification standards.
   4.10.3. Use only breath-testing devices listed on the approved NHTSA conforming products list pub-
   lished in the Federal Register. Ensure only trained personnel administer tests as specified in para-
   graph 4.13. and adhere to the procedures described in paragraphs 4.14. and 4.15. relating to voluntary
   and involuntary testing.
   4.10.3. (USAFE) Uses of non-portable breath testing devices, which are approved by the host nation
   and are equivalent to National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) standards, are autho-
   rized.
   4.10.4. Installations located in states or overseas areas with no formal training program will develop
   their own training program following material and guidance from selected civilian institutions or
   manufacturers of the equipment. Coordinate local training programs with the installation staff judge
   advocate and state's attorney general (or local equivalent) to ensure your program meets local require-
   ments for legal admissibility. Conduct refresher training at the intervals determined by the CSP and
   staff judge advocate.

4.11. Blood Alcohol Concentration Standards.
   4.11.1. Uniformly apply administrative revocation of driving privileges and other enforcement mea-
   sures to offenders driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs. When a person is tested per para-
   graph 2.3., evaluate the results of the test as follows:
      4.11.1.1. If the percentage of alcohol in the person’s blood is less than 0.05 percent, presume the
      person is not under the influence of alcohol.
      4.11.1.2. If the percentage is 0.05 but less than 0.10, presume the person is impaired. Consider
      this standard with other competent evidence in determining whether the person was under the
      influence of alcohol. Suspend driving privileges according to para 2.5. Note: The 0.10 threshold
      delineating impaired from intoxicated can be lesser level when assimilating a more stringent local,
      state, or host nation standard.
      4.11.1.3. If the percentage is 0.10 (or lesser amount when assimilating local, state, or host nation
      standards) or more or if tests reflect the presence of illegal drugs, the person is considered to have
      been driving under the influence of intoxicants. Suspend driving privileges according to para
      2.5.1.3.
   4.11.2. Percentages in paragraph 4.11.1. are percent of weight by volume of alcohol in the blood
   based on grams of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood. Installation commanders will modify military
28                                                         AFI31-204_USAFESUP_I 5 JANUARY 2006


     standards to agree with a more stringent state, local authority, or host nation standard. Refer to Assess-
     ment #3, Table 5.1.

4.12. Chemical Testing Policies and Procedures.
     4.12.1. Results of chemical testing are valid under this instruction only under the following circum-
     stances:
        4.12.1.1. Testing of blood, breath, urine, or other bodily substances using generally accepted sci-
        entific and medical methods and standards.
        4.12.1.2. Qualified personnel administer breath tests.
        4.12.1.3. Use of a nonportable breath-testing device approved by the state or host nation.
     4.12.2. If the state or host nation has not established procedures for use of breath-testing devices, then
     apply the following procedures if you use portable breath-testing devices: 1) During the initial traffic
     stop as a field sobriety testing technique in lieu of or in conjunction with other field sobriety testing
     techniques as long as the state or host nation does not prohibit such use, and 2) According to the man-
     ufacturer's operating instructions.
        4.12.2.1. Use nonportable evidentiary breath-testing devices as follows:
            4.12.2.1.1. Observe the suspected person for at least 20 minutes before collecting the breath
            specimen. During this time, the person must not drink, eat, smoke, chew tobacco, or ingest
            any substance.
            4.12.2.1.2. Verify calibration and proper operation of the instrument according to manufac-
            turer's specifications and any specific local, state, or host nation requirements.
            4.12.2.1.3. Comply with operational procedures in the manufacturer’s current instruction
            manual. Perform the preventive maintenance as required by the owner's manual.
     4.12.3. Chemical tests of personnel involved in fatal accidents.
        4.12.3.1. Installation medical authorities will immediately notify and brief the CSP upon death of
        any person involved in a motor vehicle accident. Subject to military jurisdiction, medical author-
        ities will examine anyone killed in an on-base motor vehicle accident or mishap. Conduct tests for
        the presence and concentration of alcohol or other drugs in the blood, bodily fluids, or tissues as
        soon as possible and where practical within eight hours of death. Include the test results in the
        medical reports.
        4.12.3.2. As provided by law and medical conditions permitting, obtain a blood or breath sample
        from any surviving operator whose vehicle is involved in a fatal accident.

4.13. Detection, Apprehension, and Testing of Intoxicated Drivers.
     4.13.1. Most of the time you will detect drunk drivers by observing unusual or abnormal driving
     behavior. Stop these drivers and determine the cause of their unusual driving behavior. If you reason-
     ably conclude that the individual in control of the vehicle is impaired, perform field sobriety tests.
     The DD Form 1920 is used in examining, interpreting, and recording results of such tests. Use the
     standard field sobriety tests outlined in para 4.10. Specific procedures for administering them can be
     found in AFH 31-227, Air Force Motor Vehicle and Traffic Control. Also see AFH 31-227 for proce-
AFI31-204_USAFESUP_I 5 JANUARY 2006                                                                      29


   dures and guidance concerning the use of traffic mazes, DWI checkpoints, and other drunk driving
   reduction measures.

4.14. Voluntary Breath and Bodily Fluid Testing Based on Implied Consent.
   4.14.1. Implied consent policy is explained in paragraph 2.3.
   4.14.2. Administer tests only when the following conditions are met:
       4.14.2.1. The person was lawfully stopped while driving or while in physical control of a motor
       vehicle on the installation.
       4.14.2.2. Reasonable suspicion exists to believe the person was driving under the influence of
       alcohol or drugs.
       4.14.2.3. A request was made of the person to consent and he or she was advised that failure to
       voluntarily submit to or complete a chemical test of bodily fluids or breath may result in revoca-
       tion of on-base driving privileges.
   4.14.3. The installation commander prescribes the type of chemical tests used. Advise the driver that
   the installation commander may revoke driving privileges if they fail to voluntarily submit to or com-
   plete a requested chemical test and that they do not have the right to have an attorney present before
   deciding if they will or will not take the test. Testing will follow policies and procedures in paragraph
   4.12. Also advise the driver that you can use the results of chemical tests conducted under the implied
   consent provisions of this instruction as evidence in courts-martial, nonjudicial proceedings under
   Article 15 of the UCMJ, administrative action, or civil court proceeding.
   4.14.4. Special rules exist for persons who have hemophilia, other blood-clotting disorders, or any
   medical or surgical disorder under treatment with an anticoagulant. Such people may refuse a blood
   extraction without penalty, but you can offer a breath or urine test, or both. You must outline these
   procedures and the type of medical conditions that qualify for nonpunitive refusal in readily available
   medical guidelines located in emergency rooms or other reasonable areas where blood samples might
   be drawn from those suspected of drunk driving. Valid refusals must have the concurrence of a med-
   ical doctor.
   4.14.5. If a person suspected of intoxicated driving refuses to submit to a chemical test, do not admin-
   ister a test except as specified in paragraph 4.15.

4.15. Involuntary Extraction of Bodily Fluids in Traffic Cases.
   4.15.1. These procedures pertain only to the investigation of individuals stopped, apprehended, or
   cited on a military installation for any offense related to driving a motor vehicle and for whom proba-
   ble cause exists to believe that such individual is intoxicated. Rule 312d, Military Rules of Evidence,
   and regulatory rules concerning requesting and granting authorizations for searches govern the extrac-
   tion of body fluids in furtherance of other kinds of investigations. Air Force policy on nonconsensual
   extraction of blood samples is further addressed in AFI 44-102, Patient Care and Management of
   Clinical Services.
   4.15.2. Involuntary bodily fluid extractions (blood or urine) require valid search and seizure authori-
   zations. A person subject to the UCMJ who does not consent to chemical testing, and who subse-
   quently refuses a lawful order to surrender to the test,. may nonetheless be forced to submit to an
   involuntary extraction of bodily fluids. As a general rule, forced extractions are considered only when
30                                                          AFI31-204_USAFESUP_I 5 JANUARY 2006


     an individual is involved in an accident in which there is a death, serious personal injury, or significant
     property damage. Probable cause must exist to believe the individual was driving or was in control of
     a vehicle while under the influence of an intoxicant. Conduct the extraction in accordance with the
     following procedures: 1) A search authorization by an appropriate commander or military magistrate
     obtained pursuant to Rule 315, Military Rules of Evidence, is required prior to such nonconsensual
     extraction; 2) A search authorization is not required under such circumstances when there is a clear
     indication that one will find evidence of intoxication and there is reason to believe that the delay nec-
     essary to obtain a search authorization would result in the loss or destruction of the evidence sought;
     and 3) Conduct warrantless searches only after coordination with the servicing staff judge advocate
     and attempts to gain authorization from an appropriate official fail because of the unavailability of the
     appropriate commander or military magistrate.
        4.15.2.1. If authorization from the military magistrate or commander proves unsuccessful (due to
        nonavailability), the commander of a medical facility is empowered by Rule 315(d), Military
        Rules of Evidence, to authorize such extraction from an individual located in the facility at the
        time an authorization is sought.
            4.15.2.1.1. Before authorizing the involuntary extraction, the commander of the medical facil-
            ity should, if circumstances permit, coordinate with the servicing staff judge advocate.
            4.15.2.1.2. The medical facility commander authorizing an extraction under Rule 315(d) need
            not be on duty as the attending physician. Any qualified medical person can perform the
            extraction.
            4.15.2.1.3. The authorizing official may consider his or her own observations of the individ-
            ual in determining probable cause.
     4.15.3. Authorization for the nonconsensual extraction of blood samples for evidentiary purposes by
     qualified medical personnel is independent of and not limited by provisions defining medical care,
     such as the provision for nonconsensual medical care pursuant to AFR 160-12. Only qualified medi-
     cal personnel administer extractions and use only reasonable measures to accomplish the procedure.
     Assistance to overcome an individual’s resistance to the extraction is normally provided by law
     enforcement personnel or unit personnel acting under orders from the member’s commanding officer
     or designee. Do not use any form of life endangering force to effect nonconsensual extractions.
        4.15.3.1. Nonconsensual extraction will not interfere with or delay proper medical attention.
        Medical personnel determine the priority given to involuntary fluid extractions when other medi-
        cal treatment is required.

4.16. Testing at the Request of the Apprehended Person.
     4.16.1. A person subject to tests under paragraph 2.3. can request additional testing. These tests are
     paid for by the requesting individual, and an approved facility such as an off-base hospital or research
     laboratory performs the tests. If they desire admissibility of other tests in a military or civilian court
     of law, they must ensure the state (or host nation when in an overseas area) approves the test and test
     method. Complete all tests as soon as possible, noting any delay on the resulting documents.
     4.16.2. If someone requests additional testing, the apprehending official may help make those
     arrangements. However, tests conducted under authority of the UCMJ remain valid when circum-
     stances prevent timely release of the individual, or for whatever reason additional testing is not com-
     pleted.

4.17. Off-installation Traffic Activities. Civil authorities enforce traffic laws in areas not under mili-
tary control. Likewise, the security police often investigate on-base accidents and incidents of interest to
local authorities. Consequently, the CSP must develop a program for the sharing and exchanging of infor-
mation with civil authorities. In overseas areas, these procedures are generally well documented in formal
agreements with the host nation. Local procedures must cover the receiving, processing, and securing of
traffic and related incident reports received from other investigative agencies.

4.18. Compliance With Local and State Laws.
   4.18.1. Installation commanders must ensure drivers comply with state and local traffic laws when
   operating government vehicles on or off base.
   4.18.2. Commanders coordinate with the proper civil law enforcement agency before moving gov-
   ernment vehicles or property that require special handling or exceed legal limits such as weight,
   length, width, or other standards.
   4.18.3. Installation commanders should maintain a close liaison with civil enforcement agencies and
   encourage the following:
       4.18.3.1. When possible, the prompt release of government vehicles and operators involved in
       accidents or incidents.
       4.18.3.2. Prompt notice to military authorities when military personnel or drivers of government
       motor vehicles are involved in traffic accidents or detained for serious violations of civil traffic
       laws.
       4.18.3.3. Prompt notice of any state, local, or host nation action to suspend, revoke, or restrict the
       driving privileges of personnel assigned to the installation.

4.19. Civil-Military Cooperative Programs.
   4.19.1. The State-Armed Forces Traffic Workshop Program is an organized effort to coordinate mili-
   tary and civil traffic safety activities throughout a state or area. Installation commanders should coop-
   erate and provide proper support and participation.
   4.19.2. The installation commander should establish a community-installation traffic workshop pro-
   gram to coordinate the installation traffic efforts with those of local communities. Sound and practical
   traffic planning depends on a balanced program of traffic enforcement, engineering, and education.
   Civilian and military legal and law enforcement officers, traffic engineers, safety officials, and public
   affairs officers should take part.

                    DRIVING RECORDS AND THE TRAFFIC POINT SYSTEM

5.1. Driving Records. Use SPAS or the AF Form 1313 to record vehicle traffic accidents, moving and
parking violations, suspension or revocation actions, and traffic point assessments involving military and
DoD civilian personnel, their family members, and other personnel operating motor vehicles on a military
installation. In filling out the form, use the following codes in the “accident classification” block:
     5.1.1. Identify individuals who are principals in a motor vehicle accident as “S” subject or “V” vic-
     tim.
     5.1.2. Identify accidents appropriately with “MVA” minor vehicle accident; “NLD” no liability deter-
     mined; “PD” property damage; “PI” personal injury; “G” government; “P” private; “V” vehicle; and
     “FO” fixed object.

Table 5.1. Suspension/Revocation of Driving Privileges (See Notes 1 and 2).
 Assessment: 1. Two-year revocation is mandatory on determination of facts by installation commander.
 Violation: Driving while driver’s license or installation driving privileges are under suspension or
 revocation.
 Assessment: 2. One-year revocation is mandatory on determination of facts by installation commander.
 Violation: Refusal to submit to or failure to complete chemical tests (implied consent).
 Assessment: 3. One-year revocation is mandatory on conviction.
 Violation:
 1. Manslaughter (or negligent homicide by vehicle) resulting from the operation of a motor vehicle.
 2. Driving or in physical control of a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor
 0.10% or greater. Note: Where state or local authority use a more stringent standard (i.e., 0.08 instead of
 0.10), Air Force units will assimilate the more stringent standard.
 3. Driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of any narcotic or while under the influence of any
 other drug (including alcohol) to the degree rendered incapable of safe vehicle operation.
 4. Use of a motor vehicle in the commission of a felony.
 5. Fleeing the scene of an accident involving death or personal injury (hit and run).
 6. Perjury or making a false statement or affidavit under oath to responsible officials relating to the
 ownership or operation of motor vehicles.
 7. Unauthorized use of a motor vehicle belonging to another, when the act does not amount to a felony.
 Assessment: 4. Suspension for a period of six months or less or revocation for a period not to exceed
 one year is discretionary.
 Violation:
 1. Mental or physical impairment (not including alcohol or other drug use) to the degree rendered
 incompetent to drive.
 2. Commission of an offense in another state which, if committed on the installation, would establish
 grounds for suspension or revocation.
 3. Permitting an unlawful or fraudulent use of an official driver’s license.
 4. Conviction of fleeing or attempting to elude a police officer.
 5. Conviction of racing on the highway.
 6. Excessive parking and other non-moving violations as covered under paragraph 2.5.1.1.

NOTES:
     1. When imposing a suspension or revocation because of an off-installation offense, the effective
        date is the same as the date of civil conviction or the suspension or revocation date of state or
        host nation driving privileges. This effective date can be retroactive.
       2. No points are assessed solely for revocation or suspension actions. Except for implied con-
          sent violations, base revocations on a conviction by a civilian court, military courts-martial,
          nonjudicial punishment under Article 15 of the UCMJ, or a separate hearing as otherwise
          addressed in this instruction. If revocation for implied consent is combined with another revo-
          cation such as one year for intoxicated driving, revocations may run consecutively (total of 24
          months) or concurrently (total of 12 months). Apply the installation commander’s policy sys-
          tematically and not on a case-by-case basis.

5.2. The Traffic Point System. The traffic point system provides a uniform administrative device to
impartially judge service personnel's driving performance. This system is not a disciplinary measure or a
substitute for punitive action. Further, this system is not intended to interfere in any way with the reason-
able exercise of an installation commander’s prerogative to issue, suspend, revoke, deny, or reinstate
installation driving privileges.

5.3. Point System Application. The use of the point system and procedures prescribed herein are man-
datory. The point system applies to civilian personnel operating government vehicles on and off the
installation and to their POVs driven on-base. It applies to military personnel operating GOVs and POVs
on or off the installation and to dependents, civilian employees, and all other individuals subject to this
instruction operating POVs on the installation. Unless an individual submits a rebuttal, assess points
according to the Table 5.2. Also assess points to individuals found guilty by a military or civilian court,
or upon payment of fine or forfeiture of pay and allowances, or posted bond or collateral. Do not use the
point system for non-moving violations.

Table 5.2. Point Assessment for Moving Violations (See Note 1).
Violation                                                                                 Points

instruments or to transmit simulated erroneous speed (prohibited on DoD installations).
Driver involved in accident is deemed responsible (only added to points assessed for           1
specific violations).

NOTES:
  1. When two or more violations are committed on a single occasion, assess the points for the offense
     having the greater value.
   2. Use this measure for other than minor vehicle safety defects or when a driver or registrant fails to
      correct a minor defect (for example, a burned out headlight not replaced within the grace period
      on a warning ticket).
   3. Applies to not using or improper use of a child restraint device, i.e., car seat, infant carrier, booster
      seat, belt/strap modification (when required by manufacturer) etc. Assess four points when no
      restraint system of any kind is used.

5.4. Point System Procedures.
   5.4.1. Reports of moving traffic violations recorded on DD Form 1408 or DD Form 1805 will serve
   as a basis for determining point assessment.
   5.4.2. On receipt of DD Form 1408 or other military law enforcement report of a moving violation
   (e.g., AFI 3545) the unit commander or designated supervisor will conduct an inquiry. The com-
   mander will take or recommend proper disciplinary or administrative action.
   5.4.3. Distribute citation copies and process point assessments IAW para 4.9.
   5.4.4. Installation commanders may require the following driver improvement measures as appropri-
   ate:
       5.4.4.1. Advisory letter through the unit commander or supervisor to any person who has
       acquired six traffic points within a six-month period.
36                                                        AFI31-204_USAFESUP_I 5 JANUARY 2006


        5.4.4.2. Counseling or driver improvement interview by the unit commander of any person who
        acquires more than six points but less than 12 traffic points within a six-month period.
        5.4.4.3. Referral for medical evaluation when a driver, based on reasonable belief, appears to
        have mental or physical limits that had, or may have, an adverse effect on driving ability.
        5.4.4.4. Attendance at driver improvement program (DIP) to improve driving skill, awareness, or
        attitude.
        5.4.4.5. Referral to an alcohol or drug treatment or rehabilitation facility for evaluation, counsel-
        ing, or treatment. This action is required for active duty military personnel in all cases in which
        alcohol or other drugs are a contributing factor to a traffic citation, incident, or accident.
     5.4.5. The installation commander may suspend or revoke driving privileges as provided by this
     instruction regardless of whether these improvement measures are accomplished.
     5.4.6. Notify in writing anyone whose driving privileges are suspended or revoked (for one violation
     or an accumulation of 12 traffic points within 12 consecutive months, or 18 traffic points within 24
     consecutive months). Installation commanders determine suspension and revocation periods for
     offenses not covered in Table 5.1.; however, any revocation must be for a period of 6 months or more.
     The installation commander may impose a longer suspension or revocation period (to include offenses
     in Table 5.1.) based on the person’s overall driving record. Consider the frequency, flagrancy, and
     severity of moving violations, and the response to previous driver improvement measures. In all
     cases, military members must successfully complete a prescribed course in remedial driver training
     before reinstatement of driving privileges.
     5.4.7. Points assessed against a person remain in effect for point accumulation purposes for 24 con-
     secutive months. Routinely review driver records to delete traffic points during records update while
     recording new offenses and forwarding records to new duty stations. Completion of a revocation
     based on points requires removal from the driver record of all points assessed before the revocation.
     5.4.8. Removal of points does not authorize removal of driving record entries for moving violations,
     chargeable accidents, suspensions, or revocations. Recorded entries will remain posted on individual
     driving records for the period of time indicated below.
        5.4.8.1. Chargeable nonfatal traffic accidents or moving violations--three years.
        5.4.8.2. Nonmandatory suspensions or revocations--five years.
        5.4.8.3. Mandatory revocations--seven years.

5.5. Disposition of Driving Records. Establish procedures to promptly notify the CSP when a person
assigned to or employed on the installation is transferred to another installation, released from military
service, or ends employment or affiliation with the installation.
     5.5.1. If persons transferred to another Air Force installation have valid points or other entries on
     their driving records, the CSP must forward the records to the CSP of the gaining installation. The
     gaining CSP should coordinate with applicable commanders and continue any Air Force suspension
     or revocation based on intoxicated driving or accumulation of traffic points. Traffic points for persons
     transferred will continue to accumulate as specified in para 5.4.7.
     5.5.2. Follow AFI 37-138, Records Disposition--Procedures and Responsibilities, and AFMAN
     37-139, Records Disposition Schedule, to maintain and destroy records of military personnel released
AFI31-204_USAFESUP_I 5 JANUARY 2006                                                                       37


  from active duty. Driving records remain active in the case of immediate reenlistment, change of
  officer component, or military and civilian retirement when continued vehicle registration is autho-
  rized. Retain or destroy according to AFMAN 37-139 records on civilian personnel who are terminat-
  ing on-base employment or on-base registration.
  5.5.3. Forward driving records of military family members containing point assessments or other
  entries to the sponsor’s gaining installation and review in the same manner as for service members.
  Retain driving records of retirees electing to retain installation driving privileges. Do not delete points
  accumulated or entries on the driver record regarding suspensions, revocations, moving violations, or
  chargeable accidents from the driver records except per para 5.4.7. and 5.4.8.

                                                  Chapter 6

                           IMPOUNDING PRIVATELY OWNED VEHICLES

6.1. General. This chapter provides the standards and procedures for law enforcement personnel when
towing, inventorying, searching, impounding, and disposing of POVs. This policy is based on:
     6.1.1. The interests of the Air Force in crime prevention, traffic safety, and the orderly flow of vehicle
     traffic movement.
     6.1.2. The vehicle owner's constitutional rights to due process, freedom from unreasonable search
     and seizure, and freedom from deprivation of private property.

6.2. Standards for Impoundment.
     6.2.1. You should not impound a vehicle unless it interferes with traffic, threatens public safety or
     convenience, is involved in criminal activity, contains evidence of criminal activity, or is stolen or
     abandoned.
     6.2.2. The impoundment of vehicles is inappropriate if other reasonable alternatives exist. When
     possible, attempt to locate the owner of the POV and have the vehicle removed. If reasonably feasi-
     ble, allow another responsible person to drive or tow the POV, if they first have permission from the
     owner, operator, or person empowered to control the vehicle. However in such cases, the security
     police (or towing contractor) is not responsible for safeguarding the vehicle.
     6.2.3. Impounding of POVs is justified when any of the following conditions exist:
        6.2.3.1. The vehicle is illegally parked:
            6.2.3.1.1. On a street or bridge, in a tunnel, or is double parked and interferes with the orderly
            flow of traffic.
            6.2.3.1.2. On a sidewalk, within an intersection, on a crosswalk, on a railroad track, in a fire
            lane, or is blocking a driveway so that the vehicle interferes with operations or creates a safety
            hazard to other roadway users or the general public.
            6.2.3.1.3. When blocking an emergency exit door of any public place.
            6.2.3.1.4. In a “tow-away” zone that is so marked with signs.
        6.2.3.2. The vehicle interferes with or is involved in one of the following:
            6.2.3.2.1. Street cleaning or snow removal operations after attempts to contact the owner fail.
            6.2.3.2.2. Emergency operations during a natural disaster, fire, or other emergency.
            6.2.3.2.3. The vehicle was used in a crime or contains evidence of criminal activity.
            6.2.3.2.4. The owner or person in charge of the vehicle is apprehended and therefore unable
            (or unwilling) to arrange removal of the vehicle.
            6.2.3.2.5. The POV is mechanically defective and is a menace to others using the public road-
            ways.
            6.2.3.2.6. The POV is disabled by a traffic accident and the operator is unavailable or physi-
            cally incapable of having the vehicle towed to a place of safety for storage or safekeeping.
AFI31-204_USAFESUP_I 5 JANUARY 2006                                                                      39


          6.2.3.2.7. Law enforcement personnel reasonably believe the vehicle is abandoned.

6.3. Towing and Storage.
   6.3.1. The Air Force or a contracted wrecker service may tow and store impounded POVs depending
   on availability of towing services and the local commander’s preference.
   6.3.2. The installation commander designates a securable enclosed area on the installation for use as
   an impound lot. You may use an impoundment area belonging to a contracted wrecker service pro-
   vided the area is reasonably secure. The CSP approves contractor impoundment areas and maintains
   keys for all on-base impoundment areas.
   6.3.3. Impound or tow POVs for appropriate violations of the installation traffic code or involvement
   in criminal activities under the direct supervision of law enforcement personnel.

6.4. Procedures for Impoundment.
   6.4.1. Unattended POVs.
      6.4.1.1. Conspicuously place DD Form 2504, Abandoned Vehicle Notice (See DODD 5525.4),
      on POVs considered abandoned or improperly unattended. Document this action with an entry in
      the security police blotter.
      6.4.1.2. Allow the owner three days from the date the POV is tagged to remove the vehicle. Have
      the vehicle towed if it's not moved within the allotted time. If a contracted wrecker service is used,
      complete a DD Form 2505 according to local procedures.
      6.4.1.3. After the vehicle is removed, security police or the contractor completes the DD Form
      2506, Vehicle Impoundment Report (See DODD 5525.4), as a record of action taken.
          6.4.1.3.1. Law enforcement personnel or the towing contractor conduct an inventory listing
          personal property. Do not open closed containers such as a suitcase unless necessary to iden-
          tify the owner or if the contents might present a danger to the public. In most cases, listing the
          container and sealing it with security tape will suffice.
          6.4.1.3.2. Place personal property in a secure area for safekeeping.
      6.4.1.4. Forward DD Form 2507, Notice of Vehicle Impoundment (See DODD 5525.4), by cer-
      tified mail to the address of the last known owner of the vehicle to advise the owner of the
      impoundment action and request information concerning the owner’s intentions concerning the
      vehicle.
   6.4.2. Stolen POVs or vehicles involved in criminal activity.
      6.4.2.1. Keep vehicles in Air Force custody when holding them for evidentiary purposes. Release
      recovered stolen POVs to the registered owner, unless held for evidentiary purposes, or to the law
      enforcement agency reporting the vehicle stolen, as appropriate.
      6.4.2.2. At times, civilian law enforcement or civilian government agencies will request the Air
      Force impound an on-base vehicle for reasons not related to military issues. Staff such requests
      through the Staff Judge Advocate and CSP. When appropriate, comply and support such requests
      and impound the vehicle for a reasonable period. Release the vehicle if civil authorities do not
40                                                         AFI31-204_USAFESUP_I 5 JANUARY 2006


        take custody of the vehicle within a reasonable period as determined by the installation com-
        mander.

6.5. Search Incident to Impoundment Based On Criminal Activity. Search of a POV in conjunction
with impoundment based on criminal activity will likely occur in one of the following general situations:
     6.5.1. The owner or operator is not present. This situation could arise during traffic and crime-related
     impoundments and abandoned vehicle seizures. Do not search the vehicle unless evidence or contra-
     band is in plain view or is readily discernible on the outside as evidence of criminal activity. When in
     doubt, obtain proper search authority before searching.
     6.5.2. The owner or operator is present. This situation can occur during a traffic or criminal incident
     or if the operator is apprehended for a crime or serious traffic violation and sufficient probable cause
     exists to seize the vehicle. In some cases, the operator is present but is unwilling, incapacitated, or
     otherwise unable to make adequate arrangements to safeguard the vehicle. As a general rule, you may
     search vehicles without search authority when there is a reasonable danger to police or public, there is
     a risk of loss or destruction of evidence, or the search is reasonable under rules governing search inci-
     dent to apprehension.

6.6. Disposition Of Vehicles After Impoundment.
6.6. (USAFE) Disposition of Vehicles after Impoundment. (UK ONLY). When the owner of a
tax-free vehicle can be identified, it is the responsibility of the owner to properly dispose of the tax-free
vehicle. If the owner of a tax-free vehicle cannot be identified or fails to claim the vehicle, the situation
will be treated as an irregular disposal as outlined in 3AFI 31-204, Control of Concession Vehicles within
the United Kingdom. Security forces operations must coordinate all efforts regarding impoundment of
vehicles with Permit Issuing Office to ensure tax-free vehicles are processed and disposed of properly.
     6.6.1. When a vehicle is impounded, hold it for as long as necessary for evidentiary, law enforcement,
     or other legal purposes. Unless directed otherwise by competent authority, release vehicles and prop-
     erty when no longer needed for one of the reasons stated above. Review Title 10, USC 2575, Dispo-
     sition of Unclaimed Property, and DoD Directive 4160.21-M, Defense Reutilization Marketing
     Manual, (when DRMO is used) before taking action to dispose of vehicles not claimed by the owner
     or an authorized agent.
     6.6.2. A vehicle is considered abandoned 60 days after making reasonable good faith efforts to con-
     tact the owner or when the owner is contacted and fails to take appropriate steps to assume responsi-
     bility for the vehicle. When owners decline to recover their vehicles, attempt to secure release of the
     vehicle by having the registered owners complete and sign the DD Form 2507. The 60-day waiting
     period does not apply when the owner releases the vehicle to the Air Force on DD Form 2507, signed
     letter, power of attorney, or other legally recognized document.
        6.6.2.1. Once the vehicle becomes the lawful possession of the Air Force, process the vehicle as
        abandoned property in accordance with local procedures. Unless otherwise directed, installation
        commanders have considerable latitude in determining the best use for, or disposal of, abandoned
        property. Scrap, auction, or use to support Morale, Welfare, and Recreation (MWR) activities are
        potential options. Consider local, state, or if applicable, host nation requirements. If you process
        vehicles through the Defense Reutilization Marketing Office (DRMO), follow applicable DRMO
        and DoD directives.
