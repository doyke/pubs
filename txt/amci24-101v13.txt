1. Scope. This volume contains procedures and guidance to control and monitor 463L pallet
and net assets throughout the AMC and Defense Transportation System (DTS). These
procedures apply to all AMC operated air terminals and DOD agencies including those
supporting deployed operations.
2. General Requirements.
   2.1. The unit commander or designated representative will appoint in writing a primary and
   alternate 463L asset manager.
       2.1.1. Appointment letters must include primary/alternate’s name, rank, DSN, (DEROS
       for overseas locations) and office symbol. Letters will be updated annually or anytime
       there are changes that deem the previous appointment letter to be obsolete. Appointment
       letters will be electronically sent and filed at the respective regional DOD Pallet and Net
       Distribution Center.
3. Authorized Uses for Pallets and Nets.
   3.1. Pallets, nets and associated 463L equipment will be used as intermodal assets only.
   These assets interface with the aircraft’s cargo restraint system within extremely limited
   tolerances. Assets are easily damaged when used for other than their intended purpose.
   Using them for any purpose other than the movement of cargo/baggage for airlift is therefore
   strictly prohibited.
   3.2. Intra or inter-theater surface (ground or sea) transportation of cargo-loaded pallets and
   nets (palletized) is restricted.
       3.2.1. Cargo may remain palletized if being moved over the road to another location for
       eventual airlift or delivery to the ultimate consignee or for ALOC/HHG movement.
       3.2.2. Units are permitted to palletize cargo for surface movement during
       inspections/exercises or for special programs.
       3.2.3. Units desiring surface transport of 463L pallets with loaded cargo must request a
       waiver through the COCOM Theater Asset Manager (TAM) or, Headquarters Air
       Mobility Command (HQ AMC/A4TR) DOD Operational Pallet and Net Manager.
           3.2.3.1. When over-the-road movement of built-up pallets is authorized, units must
           ensure adequate three-point dunnage is used as outlined in Technical Order (TO)
           35D33-2-2-2, 463L Air Cargo Pallets, Types HCU-6/E and HCU-12/E (Instruction
           with Parts Breakdown), paragraphs 2.7.
   3.3. Use of pallets, nets and associated equipment (operational or training) for long-term
   storage (more than three days) is prohibited. However, during non-contingency time periods,
   use of pallets and nets for pre-built mobility kits (see NOTE below) is permitted (refer to
   T.O. 35D33-2-2-2, para 2.1 for proper storage requirements). The DOD Operational
   Manager may restrict or edit this authorization during contingencies and periods of 463L
   asset shortages unless a unit desiring to pre-build cargo possesses a validated movement
   order.
NOTE: The term “Mobility kits” is meant to describe unit assets belonging to designated quick
response organizations such as a Contingency Response Group or War Readiness Spares Kit,
Mission Support Kit, etc. It is not the intent of this instruction to allow pallets to be used as

long-term storage for any/all UTCs in a functional area (e.g. maintenance, aerial port, supply,
etc.).
4. Ownership and Funding.
     4.1. Pallets and nets are funded and procured by Air Force Material Command (AFMC) and
     are Air Force property. Pallets and nets may be authorized and in the custody of any Service,
     DOD or Federal Agency.

9. Annual Revalidation.
     9.1. HQ AMC/A4TR will provide detailed guidance annually concerning revalidation
     requirements.
     9.2. All units/organizations with pallets and net authorization are required to submit an
     annual pallet and net revalidation letter, signed by the unit commander/designated
     representative. Units/organizations will submit letters to their MAJCOM POC who will in
     turn submit a consolidated letter to HQ AMC/A4TR NLT 15 September each year unless
     requested earlier by HQ AMC/A4TR at AMCA4TR.Plt.Equip@us.af.mil
     9.3. DOD Pallet and Net Distribution Center will ensure units, within their geographical
     area, submit their annual revalidation requirements to HQ AMC/A4TR.
NOTE: Annual revalidation demands organizations deliberately plan for operational pallet and
net requirements. Organizations must continuously refine pallet and net needs based on
experience and enhanced planning techniques. Air Force organizations will forward a letter with
their annual or updated requirements to the DOD Operational Manager (HQ AMC/A4TR) for
authorization approval. Annual revalidation letters will also detail the computation method used
to determine requirements and include a statement certifying the submission as the minimum
essential quantity needed to accomplish the mission.
10. Accountability.
     10.1. Organizations possessing pallets and nets must maintain a clear audit trail for assets
     that enter or leave their control. The following procedures apply:
     10.2. Account for operational and WRM assets using an adopted form (Overprint General
     Purpose AF Form 3132) as a 463L Asset Control Log (see Table 10-1). Record the types and
     quantities of equipment (e.g. pallets, nets, straps, etc.) released or received. Balance the
     control log at the end of every month. The 463L asset manager will ensure all 463L assets
     signed out in the control log are returned within 60 days of issuance. Maintain control log as
     working materials that can be destroyed once all items listed have been returned.
     10.3. Obtain an AF Form 1297, Temporary Issue Receipt for loaned pallets and nets. The
     463L asset manager will ensure that all 463L assets signed out are returned within 60 days of
     issuance.
Table 10-1. 463L Asset Control Log (Overprint General Purpose AF Form 3132)




                                             Overprint
AMCI24-101V13 30 JANUARY 2014                                                                   9


11. Requesting Pallets and Nets.
   11.1. Units will submit all requests to designated DOD Pallet and Net Distribution Center.
   11.2. DOD Pallet and Net Distribution Center will submit all requests to HQ AMC/A4TR
   amca4tr.plt.equip@us.af.mil
   11.3. AMC Deployed location will submit all requests for pallets and nets to respective
   TAM.
12. Reporting Requirements.
   12.1. Units will report on-hand assets as: available (empty serviceable assets awaiting use),
   in use (built up and ready for shipment, expected to move within 10 days), unserviceable
   (assets that have been inspected and determined either field reparable/depot
   reparable/modified), and uninspected (assets that have been delivered to your installation but
   not yet inspected for serviceability).
   12.2. Accurate reporting is essential in the accountability of all 463L assets within the DTS.
   Units are required to report all 463L assets in their possession and submit a weekly 8001
   asset report NLT 2100Z every Tuesday. Input 8001 data in GART using the following link:
   https://private.amc.af.mil/Gart/Login.aspx
       12.2.1. Units unable to report their weekly 8001 in GART, will e-mail their 8001 asset
       report to HQ AMC/A4TR amca4tr.plt.equip@us.af.mil with the same reporting
       timeline criteria as paragraph 12.2.
NOTE: GATES has the capability to produce an inventory report for 463L assets that your unit
has placed in Capped, Partial or Frustrated status. You will still need to do an inventory of
assets that are not being used or have not been reported in GATES.
13. Global Asset Reporting Tool (GART).
   13.1. GART will be utilized to report unit asset levels. Assets in GART include pallets, top
   nets, side nets, MB-1 (10,000 lbs) chains and devices, MB-2 (25,000 lbs) chains and devices,
   KC10 couplers, standard couplers, straps, etc.           Workload history will determine
   authorization on quantity of equipment (except pallets and nets). It is imperative that
   information updated in GART is accurate to ensure mission requirements are met. The
   Operational Manager utilizes GART to monitor asset levels throughout the DOD.
   13.2. Each unit is required to provide a written request to their respective MAJCOM or DOD
   Pallet and Net Distribution Center for unit personnel assigned a GART account for the
   purpose of submitting or viewing unit 8001 reports.           The written request should at a
   minimum list the name, rank, DSN, e-mail address, DEROS, and if they will be a submitter
   or viewer of the unit 8001 report. Requests will be signed by Flight/Section OIC or
   equivalent. Each unit is authorized no more than five GART accounts.
14. Repairing Pallets and Nets.
   14.1. Asset Repair. Repair of damaged pallets and nets is a critical part of overall mission
   success. IAW T.O. 35D33-2-2-2 responsible servicing Air Terminal Manager and Base
   Maintenance Officer shall, within existing facilities, capabilities and personnel allowances,
   determine the extent of damage repair, which shall be performed at the locations under their
   cognizance.
 10                                                      AMCI24-101V13 30 JANUARY 2014


   14.2. Pallets are reparable at the unit or depot level. Unit personnel can repair many types of
   pallet damage IAW TO 35D33-2-2-2. Do not dispose of unserviceable pallets at the unit
   level unless directed by the IM. Report unserviceable pallets in GART. TO 35D33-2-2-2,
   Chapter 5, further defines repair and condemnation criteria. Notify the DOD Operational
   Manager and IM of pallet field repair contracts initiated.
   14.3. Nets. Return all nets identified for installation level repair to serviceable condition as
   expeditiously as possible. TO 35D33-2-3-1, Section 3, outlines the criteria for net
   maintenance and repair. If field repair is not feasible, return the unserviceable nets to the
   depot. Upon initial inspection of nets which have been stored for any length of time and the
   presence of mold is identified, immediately stop inspection and contact the HQ AMC/A4TR
   for disposition instructions.
NOTE: Nets found to contain mold WILL NOT BE SHIPPED. Immediately contact HQ
AMC/A4TR and provide the amount of nets along with pictures. Once received, HQ
AMC/A4TR will forward the information to the WR-ALC/WNZDA Program Manager for final
disposition instructions. Upon final disposition instructions, units will contact their local
Bioenvironmental for assistance to properly dispose of the nets.
   14.4. Depot-Level Repair: Contact HQ AMC/A4TR (amca4tr.plt.equip@us.af.mil) for
   shipping instructions and fund citations for the transportation of all depot reparable pallets
   and nets. Prepare, mark, and label unserviceable pallets to be consigned to the depot repair
   facility IAW TO 35D33-2-2-2. Prepare and ship nets to the depot IAW TO 35D33-2-3-1.
   Ensure trailer data is entered in GATES when shipping pallets and nets to describe what is
   being shipped (such as 20 serviceable pallets, 300 unserviceable side nets, etc).
       14.4.1. Pallets. Do not allow unserviceable pallets (pallets that cannot be repaired at the
       unit level) to accumulate at installations. Do not ship or transfer unserviceable pallets
       without the proper condition tags. Identify them with the DD Form 1577, Unserviceable
       (Condemned) Tag-Materiel, Attachment 2 or DD Form 1577-2, Unserviceable
       (Reparable) Tag-Materiel, Attachment 2. Send large quantities of reparable pallets
       directly to the contractor’s repair facility using shipping instructions provided by the IM
       through the MAJCOM pallet and net manager. OCONUS, turn in reparable pallets IAW
       TO 35D33-2-2-2. Do not ship nets on pallets to the depot repair facility.
NOTE: For instructions on filling out DD Form 1577 Tags please see following link
www.apd.army.mil/pdffiles/p738_751.pdf
       14.4.2. Nets. The depot repair facility will handle all repairs not within the maintenance
       capability of the installation or unit. Ensure nets are dry before packing them for
       shipment. Enclose them in vapor proof barriers and ship to the depot repair facility.
       Attach the condition tag to an outer surface of the shipping container. Shipments to depot
       repair facility must be in a closed box truck to protect nets from the weather elements.
       Tri-walls of nets must be loaded and shipped on a wooden/plastic skid accessible by a
       standard 4K forklift. Do not ship nets on pallets to the depot repair facility and/or to any
       other DOD Agency.
15. Shipping.
   15.1. HQ AMC/A4TR or a DOD Pallet and Net Distribution Center will officially task units
   to ship 463L assets. The official tasking will include a tasking number, shipping address,
AMCI24-101V13 30 JANUARY 2014                                                                   11


   DODAAC, POC name and contact number at the receiving station, amount of 463L assets to
   be shipped, and the appropriate Transportation Account Code (TAC) authorized for use.
NOTE: Nets will be transported utilizing an enclosed Box Truck to protect nets from heat, direct
sunlight, moisture and humidity. Pallets shipped via surface transportation will be banded
together using 1-1/4 inch metal strapping, two on the 88” side and two on the 108” side, stacked
10-20 high without dunnage between each ten pallets to minimize shifting during over-the-road
transportation. Banding pallets in this manner will reduce unsafe conditions and/or personal
injuries during surface movements IAW TO 35D33-2-2-2, paragraph 5.5.3.
   15.2. TAC codes used are limited to:
   15.3. FPLT- CONUS surface movement of empty pallets and nets to the depot repair
   facility.
   15.4. QMRS- Air movement of empty 463L assets aboard AMC owned or controlled
   aircraft.
   15.5. QMRS and FPLT can only be used with permission from HQ AMC/A4TR.
   15.6. Units must respond to HQ AMC/A4TR or DOD Pallet and Net Distribution Center
   official taskings within 24 hours for CONUS locations, and within 72 hours for OCONUS
   locations. The response to HQ AMC/A4TR or DOD Pallet and Net Distribution Center
   official taskings must include the Transportation Control Number (TCN) and estimated ship
   date.
16. Inspecting Pallets and Nets.
   16.1. Accurate inspections are vital to maintaining proper levels of 463L assets. Each unit
   will inspect all 463L assets in their possession IAW TO 35D33-2-2-2 and TO 35D33-2-3-1.
17. Associated Equipment.
   17.1. Equipment that is identified by nomenclature and national stock number in DTR Part
   VI, Chapter 608, Table 608-1. Secure cargo to the aircraft floor using tiedown equipment
   stored on the aircraft or assets provided by the local air terminal. However, to secure cargo
   to pallets, units must procure and control their own pallet couplers, plastic coverings, tiedown
   equipment (less nets), dunnage, and shoring. It is not the responsibility of the local air
   terminal to provide tiedown equipment/463L assets to deploying units. For cargo moving via
   channel missions, tiedown equipment is subject to one-for-one exchange (from aircraft
   inventory) for serviceable items only. If one-for-one exchange is not feasible due to limited
   aircraft inventory enter required information on the 463L asset control log and contact cargo
   termination point to coordinate return of assets.
Note: TO 13C2-1-1, Cleaning, Repair and Test Instructions for Cargo Tie - Down Equipment,
provides cleaning and maintenance instructions for tiedown equipment.
   17.2. Units and shippers will program and fund the acquisition of tiedown equipment to
   move their shipments on pallets to preclude work stoppages, cancellation or delay of
   missions.
18. Subfloor Requirements.
 12                                                        AMCI24-101V13 30 JANUARY 2014


   18.1. HQ AMC/A4TR will provide pallets, chains, devices, and couplers when commercial
   aircraft are used to move rolling stock. Couplers will only be provided if needed to couple
   pallets together as a subfloor (i.e. rolling stock subfloored prior to aircraft arrival). Subfloors
   already installed on aircraft do not require couplers. The deploying unit will provide pallets,
   tiedown, and couplers for cargo not intended to be loaded as rolling stock.
   18.2. Record pallets and tiedown equipment issued to commercial aircraft as subfloors on
   the unit 463L asset control log with mission number, type aircraft, and APOD.
19. Modification of 463L Pallets and Nets.
   19.1. The IM may approve requests for modifications to pallets for specialized transportation
   purposes. Units must remove these permanently modified pallets from their inventory and
   discontinue accounting for them as pallets.
20. Return of Assets - Retrograde of pallets and nets.
   20.1. COCOM 463L TAMs will ensure proper retrograde plans are in place to support the
   return of pallets and nets to DOD Pallet and Net Distribution Centers, aerial ports, or repair
   facilities. 463L assets supporting sustainment operations will be returned to the nearest
   aerial port within three days of delivery at the forward operating base.
       20.1.1. The TAM will ensure the task of recovering retrograde 463L assets is included in
       operations/fragmentary orders as part of the routine base/camp procedures.
21. Contingency Assets Recovery Team (CART).
   21.1. The recovery of pallets and nets is a priority task in contingency operations. The
   recovery process involves the establishment of CARTs. The COCOM TAM is responsible
   for the establishment and management of the CART. See Table 21-1 for recommended
   CART structure. The CART will be a deployable team. The CART will recover pallets and
   nets from exercise, humanitarian, and contingency operations.
   21.2. The CART will be responsible for identifying 463L assets (including items such as
   specialized shoring kits), evaluating serviceability, arranging recovery, and reporting the
   status of identified but non-recoverable 463L assets to the TAM.
   21.3. The CART will not disassemble shelters, bunkers or other facilities to obtain pallet
   assets used in their construction. The team will direct others in such disassembly IAW this
   regulation, Joint Publications 3-35, 4-01, and TOs 35D33-2-2-2 and 35D33-2-3-1.
   21.4. 463L assets will be transported to the nearest aerial port by airlift or ground transport
   for insertion into the DTS.
   21.5. 463L assets leaving an overseas location will be cleaned to meet US Department of
   Agriculture guidance, the DTR Parts III and V requirements, and IAW this instruction. The
   CART or the owning agency will clean, stack, and prepare assets for movement as soon as
   possible. The CART will coordinate the return destination through the TAM with the DOD
   Operational Manager.
   21.6. The following technical publications apply in making serviceable and reparable
   decisions:
