tional Safety and Health Standard (AFOSHSTD) 91-100, Aircraft Flight Line-Ground Operations and
Activities, and AFOSHSTD 91-501, Air Force Consolidated Occupational Safety Standard. It establishes
procedures for the safe operation of mechanically end electrically operated hangar doors controlled by the
911 Airlift Wing (AW) and all collocated support activities. Specific procedures or technical orders,
which incorporate the requirements of AFOSHSTD 91-100, must be referenced during hangar door oper-
ation. A locally developed check list titled “Hangar Door Operation” must also be used during all aspects
of hangar door operation and training. Group commanders, squadron commanders, building custodians,
supervisors, and trainers are responsible for ensuring the contents of this instruction and other related doc-
uments are strictly complied with. This instruction is applicable to all personnel assigned to the 911 AW.


1. General.
   1.1. This instruction is designed to prepare 911 AW personnel to safely and effectively perform han-
   gar entry. Hangar Door Operation Qualification Training is mandatory for all personnel who operate
   hangar doors or require access through hangar doors, not personnel doors, in the performance of rou-
   tine duties, (work in hangar facilities, supply/equipment deliveries, aircraft cargo loading, 911 Civil
   Engineer Fire Protection Flight [911 MSG/CEF], 911 Security Forces Squadron [911 SFS], 911 CES
   Maintenance, Griffin Services, etc.). Hangar Door Awareness Training is given to those who need
   familiarization training as required. All personnel who routinely work in hangar facilities, regardless
   of Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) or duties, must receive awareness training.
   1.2. The 911 Maintenance Group hangar building managers with assistance of their immediate super-
   visors are responsible for publishing an operational hangar door checklist. This checklist must be
   posted at each electric hangar door control panel. This checklist will identify the safety and opera-
   tional issues of hangar door operation. Checklist format will be approved by [911 MXG/MXQ] and
   incorporated into a LCL format for distribution.

    mander. A signed copy of the letter will be kept in the work center.

6. Documentation.
    6.1. Three GO81 course codes will be used to identify and track hangar door training:
       6.1.1. Hangar Door Awareness: AFRC 001100
       6.1.2. Hangar Door Operation Qualification Training, Electric (Bldg 416 & 417): PIT 000007
       6.1.3. Hangar Door Operation Qualification Training, Electric with manual tail enclosures (Bldg
       129): PIT 000009.
    6.2. Personnel will document hangar door training on AF Form 797, Job Qualification Standard
    Continuation/Command JQS, AF Form 55, Employee Safety and Health Record, or locally
    developed computer product. Maintenance personnel will document hangar door training in GO81.
    6.3. The respective squadron commander will forward a letter to 911 AW/SE and 911 MXG/MXQ
    with a listing of all qualified personnel, stating what type of training they have received.
