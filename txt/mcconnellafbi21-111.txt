1. Definition
     1.1. A confidence flight (CF) is an “as required” flight, requested by the Maintenance Group
     Commander or Deputy Commander (MXG/CC/CD) or engineer disposition that is scheduled
     after major maintenance not requiring an FCF or OCF as outlined in -6 series technical order.
2. Responsibilities/Procedures
     2.1. The MXG/CC and Operations Group Commander (OG/CC) have joint responsibility for
     the FCF program. The decision to fly a full profile FCF will be at the discretion of the
     MXG/CC and OG/CC (or designated equivalent). It is the responsibility of all maintenance
     and operations personnel to ensure a safe and effective FCF, OCF, CF and HST check
     program. MXG Quality Assurance (QA) is the maintenance focal point for all FCF, OCF, CF
     and HST check matters. The OG/OGV will be the operations focal point.
     2.2. The applicable production supervisor (pro super) from the Aircraft Maintenance
     Squadron (22 AMXS, 931 AMXS) or Maintenance Squadron (22 MXS, 931 MXS) will:
        2.2.1. Coordinate with Maintenance Plans, Scheduling and Documentation (PS&D) for
        fuel configuration and required maintenance personnel for flight.
        2.2.2. Provide the PS&D section and QA with the required flight profile to accomplish
        the FCF, OCF, CF and HST Report 22 MXG Form 6 (Attachment 2).
        2.2.3. Coordinate with OG/OGV at least one week prior to scheduling an FCF flight.
        To ensure qualified crews are available to perform required checks.
        2.2.4. Evaluate all aircraft undergoing isochronal inspection, cannibalization,
        refurbishment (equipment excellence) or any unusual occurrence/aircraft discrepancy for
        an FCF, OCF, CF or HST check.
        2.2.5. Ensure minimum inspection requirements of a preflight or thru-flight inspection
        are accomplished prior to all FCF, OCF, CF and HST checks.
        2.2.6. Coordinate with QA to meet at aircraft one day prior to FCF, OCF, or HST check
        for an aircraft forms review.
     2.3. The PS&D section will:
        2.3.1. Coordinate the flight or taxi check with the OG to ensure qualified crews are
        available to perform required checks.
        2.3.2. Place a copy of 22 MXG Form 6 (Attachment 2) in the aircraft’s jacket file. This
        information will not be removed until replaced by the next package or 90 days,
        whichever occurs first.
        2.3.3. Inform QA if FCF, OCF, CF or HST check is rescheduled.
     2.4. QA will:

     2.4.1. Brief aircrew prior to and upon conclusion of each FCF, OCF, CF and HST check.
     2.4.2. Forward a copy of 22 MXG Form 6 (Attachment 1) to PS&D section.
     2.4.3. Keep a log of all FCF, OCF, CF and HST checks to include tail number, reason for
     flight and results of the flight.
  2.5. The 22 OG/OGV will:
     2.5.1. Maintain updated FCF checklists.
     2.5.2. Identify required aircraft configuration, special requirements, and provide
     additional information to PS&D.
     2.5.3. Sign-off all FCF, OCF, CF and HST checks in the AFTO Form 781A,
     Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document; when the operational checks are
     complete and satisfactory. If FCF, OCF, CF or HST checks fail, document the aircraft
     forms to reflect any and all pertinent information surrounding the failure.
     2.5.4. Complete the 22 MXG Form 6 (Attachment 2) and return both to QA at debrief.
