                                             Chapter 1

                                  GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. General.
     1.1.1. Pilot in Command Authority. The Pilot in Command (PIC) is responsible for, and is
     the final authority as to, the operation of the aircraft.
     1.1.2. This instruction is a common source of flight directives that includes:
        1.1.2.1. Air Force-specific guidance, and
        1.1.2.2. Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFRs) (formerly the Federal Aviation
        Regulations), the Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM), and
        1.1.2.3. International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Standards and Recommended
        Practices (SARPs).
     1.1.3. This AFI provides necessarily broad guidance and cannot address every conceivable
     circumstance. PICs will use their orders and best judgment to safely conduct the flight.
     1.1.4. Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) or Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) Applicability.
     With respect to compliance with flight rules, the USAF considers UAS/RPA to be no
     different than manned aircraft. Groups 4 and 5 RPA operations shall follow this AFI, while
     Groups 1-3 (―Small‖) UAS shall be governed by AFPD 11-5, Small Unmanned Aircraft
     Systems Rules, Procedures, and Service, and its derivative instructions.
1.2. Compliance. The PIC will ensure compliance with this AFI and the following:
     1.2.1. MAJCOM guidance and MDS-specific instructions, manuals and supplements.
     1.2.1. (AFMC) AFMC produces a three-volume set of Flight Test (FT) instructions
     containing attachments for each weapon system flown in AFMC. These instructions are
     numbered AFI 11-2FT Vol 1, 2, and 3 and will contain the training, evaluation criteria, and
     operations procedures, respectively, for each weapon system. AFMC uses these instructions
     in lieu of AFI 11-2 MDS-specific volumes for flying operations. In the absence of published
     guidance, AFMC units will coordinate with HQ AFMC/A3V for approval of locally
     developed guidelines. If possible, these guidelines should be consistent with similar guidance
     specified in the appropriate AFI 11-2 MDS-specific lead MAJCOM Volumes. In addition,
     aircraft on loan to AFMC undergoing short-term flight test programs will be flown according
     to the lead MAJCOM guidance if no AFMC guidance exists.
     1.2.2. The specific rules of each individual nation as published in Flight Information
     Publications (FLIP) planning documents and the Foreign Clearance Guide (FCG). Theater
     commanders must ensure the contents of FLIP accurately indicate the rules of each nation
     within their area of responsibility that differ from this instruction.
     1.2.3. Procedures and special notices in FLIP, Notices to Airmen (NOTAMs), aircraft
     technical orders, Air Force directives, MAJCOM directives, and Air Traffic Control (ATC)
     instructions. (See Attachment 1 for related publications.)
AFI11-202V3_AFMCSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2011                                                           9


   1.2.4. Combatant Commander's Special Instructions (SPINS), theater operational
   procedures, Air Tasking Orders, Airspace Control Orders, Air Operations Center
   instructions, and other associated directives IAW the Air Component Commander's
   objectives.
1.3. Operational Prerogative of Military Aircraft. In international airspace, when
operationally necessary, PIC's are authorized to conduct military flight operations with due
regard for the safety of navigation of civil traffic in accordance with (IAW) FLIP GP
―Operations and Firings over the High Seas.‖ Except for pre-planned missions, PIC's shall
consider such operations, in peacetime, as a flight rule deviation and will comply with the
reporting requirements in paragraph 1.7. MAJCOMs may authorize tactical operations for
training and to comply with paragraph 1.2.4.
1.4. MAJCOM Supplements and Command Relationships. The following restrictions apply
to MAJCOM supplements and MDS Specific, Volume 3 instructions subordinate to this AFI.
   1.4.1. MAJCOM guidance, in any form, unless specifically permitted, shall not be less
   restrictive than this instruction.
   1.4.2. Items in this AFI delineating MAJCOM responsibilities will be addressed in a
   MAJCOM supplement, the lead command-authored AFI 11-2MDS Volume 3, MDS
   Operations Procedures, or other published MAJCOM guidance.
   1.4.3. Lead and user MAJCOMs are not bound by, or authorized to operate under, the
   other’s waivers or exemptions.
   1.4.4. MAJCOM supplements to this instruction and MDS Specific, Volume 3 instructions
   must be coordinated through HQ AFFSA for USAF/A3O approval prior to publication IAW
   AFPD 11-2. Submit supplements for coordination to: HQ AFFSA/A3OF (AJW31AF),
   Building 4, Room 124, 6500 South MacArthur Blvd, Oklahoma City, OK 73169, (405) 739-
   9637, DSN 339-9637, email: hqaffsa.a3of@tinker.af.mil.
   1.4.5. (Added-AFMC) AFMC flying units may supplement only AFI 11-2FT Volume 3,
   Flight Test Operations Procedures, to incorporate additional aircrew procedures. Email unit
   supplements to the AFMC/A3V Workflow for review and approval prior to publication.
   Include AFMC/A3V and AFMC/A3O on the distribution list for approved supplements to
   AFI 11-2FT Volume 3.
1.5. Title 14 CFR Exemptions and FAA Authorizations. MAJCOMs will obtain FAA
exemptions or authorizations only through HQ USAF/A3O by contacting HQ AFFSA and
following the waiver guidance below. MAJCOMs should submit their CFR Exemption requests
a minimum of six months prior to execution for original requests and exemption renewals.
EXCEPTION: IAW AFI 13-201, Airspace Management, waivers for airshow issues (speed,
minimum safe altitudes, parachute jumping, etc.) should be submitted directly to the local Flight
Standards District Office. Operations of UAS in the U.S. National Airspace System (NAS)
outside of Warning and Restricted Areas require an FAA Certificate of Authorization or Waiver
(COA), to be obtained by the user unit through their MAJCOM.
1.6. Waivers. HQ USAF/A3O will provide waivers to this instruction only upon an official
MAJCOM request when an essential requirement makes a waiver necessary or compliance with
a flight rule creates a hazard.
10                                           AFI11-202V3_AFMCSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2011


  1.6.1. Waiver Process. HQ USAF/A3O will provide only written waivers with an
  expiration date. Revisions to this AFI do not automatically invalidate current waivers with
  respect to paragraph numbering, etc. Upon publication of a revision, HQ AFFSA shall
  coordinate with each MAJCOM to convert, rescind, or issue new waivers (when appropriate)
  resulting from revisions to this AFI. Units requiring a waiver to this AFI will follow this
  procedure:
     1.6.1.1. Units will forward their written request for a waiver to this instruction through
     their chain of command to the MAJCOM/A3. The unit’s detailed waiver request must
     clearly delineate if a FAA exemption is required, the operational requirement for the
     waiver and risk mitigation measures to be undertaken during operations under the waiver.
     1.6.1.2. MAJCOMs will review the request. If approved, the MAJCOM/A3 will endorse
     the request and forward it in memo or message format to HQ USAF/A3O, with a copy to
     HQ AFFSA/A3O, at least 30 days prior to the waiver requirement (if waiver also requires
     FAA exemption, see paragraph 1.5).                  Submit waiver requests to:
     afa3o.workflow@pentagon.af.mil (copy to: hqaffsa.a3of@tinker.af.mil). If approved,
     HQ USAF/A3O will send an approved waiver memo to the MAJCOM/A3.                    HQ
     USAF/A3O will review and respond in writing to all MAJCOM waiver requests.
     1.6.1.3. MAJCOMs shall track the currency of all approved waivers to ensure renewals,
     if required, are validated and then requested using the process above at least 15 days prior
     to the expiration date. HQ AFFSA retains renewal authority for existing waivers.
     Renewals should be requested by the MAJCOM Stan/Eval function.
  1.6.2. MAJCOM Commander Waiver Authority.
     1.6.2.1. MAJCOM commanders may unilaterally authorize any deviation from air traffic
     rules (this instruction, the CFRs, etc.), without prior approval from HQ USAF/A3O or the
     FAA, if doing so is ―essential to the defense of the United States‖ because of a military
     emergency or an urgent military necessity, and there is no time to obtain prior approval
     from HQ USAF/A3O or the FAA. Time permitting, the MAJCOM will notify HQ
     USAF/A3O (copy to HQ AFFSA) and the FAA (through HQ AFFSA) of its military
     intentions prior to deviating from the flight rules. MAJCOM commanders will notify HQ
     USAF/A3O within 72 hours of authorizing any waiver or deviation following the process
     in paragraph 1.6.1.2. Notification must include details of the waiver action to include
     expected date of return to normal operations.
     1.6.2.2. The MAJCOM/A3 is the waiver authority for operational procedure
     requirements in the MAJCOM supplement to this instruction and in the appropriate MDS
     Specific, Volume 3. Further delegation of waiver authority is at MAJCOM discretion
     and will be addressed in the relevant instruction.
     1.6.2.2. (AFMC) HQ AFMC/A3V is the waiver authority for this supplement, unless
     otherwise noted. All waivers will be routed through appropriate operations channels to
     flying unit commanders, and the Operations Group Commander (OG/CC), prior to
     submission to HQ AFMC/A3V. Use an AFMC Form 73, AFMC Flight Operations
     Waiver Request, to process the waiver. Email waivers to the AFMC/A3V Workflow for
     review and approval.
AFI11-202V3_AFMCSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2011                                                            11


       1.6.2.3. For the purposes of this instruction, flying MAJCOMS are: ACC, AETC,
       AFGSC, AFMC, AFRC, AFSPC, AFSOC, AMC, NGB, PACAF and USAFE.
       COMMAFFORs in the grade of O-9 or O-10 in Combatant Commands are considered
       MAJCOM commanders only for forces under their operational control.
1.7. Deviations. An ATC clearance is not authority to deviate from this instruction. A PIC may
only deviate from any flight rule or ATC clearance to protect life, for safety of flight or when an
in-flight emergency requires immediate action.
   1.7.1. Notification. When deviating from an ATC clearance, the PIC will notify ATC of the
   action taken as soon as possible.
   1.7.2. Post-Flight Actions. The following post-flight actions shall be taken in the event of a
   deviation from a flight rule and/or when given traffic priority by ATC in an emergency:
       1.7.2.1. The PIC will verbally report the incident to a supervisor and commander within
       24 hours of the incident, and shall make a detailed written record.
       1.7.2.2. The unit will keep a copy of that record for a minimum of 1 year from the date
       of the incident and be prepared to provide that record to the appropriate investigating
       authority.
1.8. Violations. A violation may result when a USAF aircraft deviates from flight rules. FAA
ATC facility deviation reports involving a USAF aircraft are processed IAW AFI 13-201. Air
Force air traffic control facility deviation reports involving USAF aircraft are processed IAW
AFI 91-202, The US Air Force Mishap Prevention Program. Violations that occur in the
airspace of foreign nations are handled IAW the procedures of that nation.
   1.8.1. The names of the crew will not be released to non-USAF agencies without the
   permission of the Air Force Representative to the FAA (AFREP), in coordination with
   MAJCOM/A3s or HQ USAF/A3O.
1.9. Dimensional Units. Visibility distances are in statute miles (SM). All other distances
referred to in this instruction are in nautical miles (NM) unless otherwise specified.

                                            Chapter 2

                               PREFLIGHT REQUIREMENTS

2.1. Preflight Planning. Before takeoff, the PIC will ensure the entire mission is planned to its
final destination in the greatest detail possible for each leg of the flight. For multi-leg flights,
before each departure, the PIC will obtain the latest weather and NOTAM information available
for the departure airfield, intended route, destination and alternate. The PIC will ensure aircrew
members know the appropriate procedures and have applicable information available to them for
the intended operation. These shall include, but are not limited to:
   2.1.1. Appropriate sections of the aircraft technical order (T.O.).
   2.1.2. NOTAMs (including Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) NOTAMs, and navigation
   database NOTAMS (e.g. Jeppesen NAVDATA), if applicable) and Temporary Flight
   Restrictions (TFRs).
   2.1.3. FLIP including appropriate sectional aeronautical charts, oceanic plotting charts or
   Portable Flight Planning System (PFPS)/Falcon View charts with FAA/ICAO airspace
   displayed for flight under Visual Flight Rules (VFR).
   2.1.4. Airfield Suitability and Restrictions Report (ASRR) including Supplemental Theater
   Information File (STIF), Special Departure Procedure (SDP) information and approved
   private vendor flight publications information IAW paragraph 2.2.
   2.1.5. Alternatives available if the flight cannot be completed as planned.
   2.1.6. Departure, en route, destination, and alternate weather observations and forecasts.
   2.1.7. Fuel requirements.
   2.1.8. Minimum safe altitudes and terrain type for the planned route and terminal areas.
   2.1.9. Takeoff and landing limitations, including low-visibility operations.
   2.1.10. AFI 11-2MDS-Specific, Volume 3, MDS Operations Procedures.
   2.1.11. Applicable MAJCOM mission-specific guidance (e.g. FCIF and FCBs).
   2.1.12. Spatial Disorientation and Alertness management strategies IAW Chapter 9 and
   MAJCOM guidance.
   2.1.13. Bird advisories and hazard information. See also paragraph 5.26.
   2.1.13. (AFMC) Unit Commanders will ensure Avian Hazard Advisory System (AHAS)
   and Bird Avoidance Model (BAM) are available and accessible to unit flight supervisors,
   supervisors of flying (SOF), scheduling offices, and aircrews. Aircrews will review the
   AHAS/BAM during mission planning for all low-levels. Aircrews will review the
   AHAS/BAM for all transient locations prior to departure from home field, and then at
   transient locations/bases to the maximum extent possible. The risk levels presented are
   standardized and may not necessarily impact the specific aircraft or mission. The Risk and
   BASH link at the AHAS/BAM Web site (http:// www.usahas.com/) should be consulted for
   more information on AHAS/BAM risk-level assignment. Units will develop procedures for
   risk assessment for bird hazards.
AFI11-202V3_AFMCSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2011                                                             13


   2.1.14. Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM) if any portion of the flight is to
   be conducted using GPS as primary source of navigation. See also paragraph 2.16.
   2.1.15. (Added-AFMC) Operational Risk Management (ORM) Worksheets. All AFMC
   flying units will use an ORM assessment worksheet to identify and manage risks associated
   with their flying mission. The assessment worksheet will have four areas: human, machine,
   mission, and media. Each area will have command defined elements (―AFMC Core
   Elements‖), and elements defined and tailored at the unit level. The worksheet will use a
   weighting/scoring system defined by the command, with a total that is used to determine the
   overall assessed risk for the flight. Commanders will establish threshold criteria; and for
   flights assessed at an elevated risk level above the threshold, the assessment will be reviewed
   by a unit designated operations supervision authority other than the aircraft commander prior
   to execution of that sortie. Worksheet data for all flights will be tracked and reviewed
   periodically by the OG/CC (Group Commander). Analysis of data by the unit from the
   worksheet assessments will be reported annually (Oct-Sep fiscal year) to AFMC/ A3V by 1
   Dec each year. Highlights and command summary of data will be reviewed at the annual
   Flight Operations conference.
2.2. Airfield Suitability.
   2.2.1. Each MAJCOM will establish MDS-specific guidance on how aircrews, mission
   planners and other personnel will access, use and employ ASRR/STIF, SDP and Jeppesen
   Military Chart Service information.
   2.2.1. (AFMC) For additional ASRR mission planning guidance and use of Jeppesen
   Military Chart Services see AFI 11-2FTV3.
       2.2.1.1. (Added-AFMC) AFMC aircrews will review the ASRR (and GDSS if
       required) when planning missions to other than local area airfields. A local area airfield is
       defined as an airfield (civil, military, or joint use) used by a unit for flight operations
       where local airfield information is known and routinely monitored by the operations
       supervision. A list of local area designated airfields will be approved by the Unit
       Commander and published in the unit local area procedures instruction. General ASRR
       restrictions (example: day only, VMC only, etc.) are applicable to all AFMC operations.
       Aircraft specific restrictions apply to AFMC users of like aircraft. The ASRR may not be
       used to grant relief from any guidance contained in an AFI or AFMC supplement. Waiver
       authority for restrictions in the ASRR is AFMC/A3V. Unit Commanders will ensure
       personnel are properly trained on how to access and use the ASRR and the AMC
       Internet-based airfield database. NOTE: The AMC airfield database is only accessible
       from military computers via the Internet.
   2.2.2. SDP and Jeppesen Military Chart Service (or other approved private vendor)
   information are available at commercial websites. The MAJCOM Standardization and
   Evaluation office may obtain usernames and passwords from HQ AFFSA/A3OF. Contact
   AMC Airfield Suitability office (DSN 779-3112 or airfield.helpdesk@amc.af.mil) for
   access to the ASRR.
2.3. Publications. Operational commanders are responsible for providing their crews with
access to appropriate flight publications. Aircrew members shall not be provided with, nor use,
 14                                             AFI11-202V3_AFMCSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2011


any publication in-flight which is out of date, incomplete, illegible or contains unfamiliar
procedures or a language barrier.
   2.3.1. The PIC will ensure current copies (electronic and/or paper) of the appropriate FLIP
   en route supplement, en route, oceanic plotting and/or terrain charts, Flight Information
   Handbook, and appropriate arrival, approach and departure procedures are on board the
   aircraft or immediately available in the UAS control station. If an electronic navigation
   system database is used, the PIC will ensure it is current. For Electronic Flight Bag (EFB)
   and paperless cockpit restrictions, see paragraph 2.17.
   2.3.1. (AFMC) Units will issue to all aircrew their assigned aircraft flight manual technical
   orders; electronic media is acceptable. Refer to AFI 11-2FTV3 and AFI 11-215 for additional
   publications requirements.
   2.3.2. Printed forms, charts or terminal procedures, used for en route or off-station
   navigation, must be printed in the original scale and in color (if appropriate), and be current
   with the latest Digital Aeronautical Information File (DAFIF) and Electronic Chart Update
   Manual (ECHUM). MAJCOMs may permit additional chart configurations to meet mission-
   specific needs.
   2.3.3. Aircrews will obtain FLIP and aeronautical navigation data (including charts) only
   from US Government sources. National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) data may be
   obtained at https://www.extranet.nga.mil.        US Government Terminal Procedures
   Publications (approach, departure charts and airfield diagrams, etc.) and an Aeronautical
   Chart Users Guide are available at: http://www.naco.faa.gov. See paragraph 8.4.5. for non-
   US Government procedure use rules.
2.4. Fuel Requirements. The PIC will ensure sufficient fuel is available on board the aircraft to
comply with the requirements of this instruction and safely conduct the flight. PICs shall use
MAJCOM-approved fuel-efficiency techniques and procedures to the maximum extent practical.
Before takeoff or immediately after in-flight refueling, the aircraft must have enough usable fuel
aboard to complete the flight:
   2.4.1. To a final landing, either at the destination airport or alternate airport (if one is
   required), plus the fuel reserves.
   2.4.2. To or between Air Refueling Control Points (ARCPs) and then to land at the
   destination (or a recovery base, if refueling is not successful), plus the fuel reserve.
   2.4.3. Alternate Airport Required. When an alternate is required, the weather conditions
   at the original destination govern the preflight fuel computation.
       2.4.3.1. Fuel required for an approach and missed approach must be included in the total
       flight plan fuel if visibility-only weather criteria (paragraph 8.6.3.2.) is used to determine
       the suitability of the original destination.
       2.4.3.2. Fuel required for an approach and missed approach is not required if the ceiling
       and visibility criteria is used to determine the suitability of the original destination.
   2.4.4. Fuel Reserve. The PIC must ensure the aircraft is carrying enough usable fuel on
   each flight to increase the total planned flight time between refueling points by 10 percent
   (up to a maximum of 45 minutes for fixed-wing or 30 minutes for helicopters) or 20 minutes,
AFI11-202V3_AFMCSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2011                                                          15


   whichever is greater. Compute fuel reserves using MAJCOM-defined consumption rates for
   normal cruising speeds or the following:
   2.4.4. (AFMC) Refer to AFI 11-2FTV3 for additional fuel requirements.
       2.4.4.1. For reciprocating engine aircraft and helicopters, use fuel consumption rates for
       normal cruising altitudes.
       2.4.4.2. For turbine-powered aircraft use fuel consumption rates that provide maximum
       endurance at 10,000 ft. Mean Sea Level (MSL).
       2.4.4.3. If the MAJCOM authorizes holding (instead of an alternate airport) for a remote
       or island destination, do not consider the prescribed holding time as part of the total
       planned flight time for computing fuel reserve.
       2.4.4.3. (AFMC) Holding (in lieu of an alternate airport) is authorized for a remote or
       island destination when the requirements of para 8.7.3, as supplemented, are met.
   2.4.5. Extended Operations (ETOPS). In the absence of MDS-specific guidance, PICs of
   USAF multi-engine aircraft operated for extended periods over large bodies of water (outside
   gliding distance to a suitable landing site) or desolate land areas shall, during preflight
   planning, calculate and plot on the appropriate navigational chart, an Equal Time Point (ETP)
   to a suitable alternate for that mission leg, and specifically plan contingency fuel
   requirements (e.g.: engine-out depressurized flight at an appropriate altitude from ETP to the
   suitable landing site).
   2.4.6. Minimum/Emergency Fuel Advisory. Pilots will declare minimum/emergency fuel
   to the appropriate controlling agency when in their judgment the aircraft may land at the
   intended destination with less than the minimum/emergency fuel reserve.
2.5. Flight Logs. When required by the MAJCOM, PIC’s will ensure the flight log documents
appropriate air navigation, oceanic crossing, and fuel planning information. The lead command
will approve flight-planning software to meet MDS training and operational requirements.
Approved flight logs include: AF Form 70, Pilot’s Flight Plan and Flight Log, Navigator’s
flight log, a MAJCOM-approved computer-generated flight log or form, or flight planning
computations annotated on a navigation chart.
2.5. (AFMC)Flight Logs. The Unit Commander may permit the use of a unit-developed flight
log. Submit unit-developed forms to HQ AFMC/A3V for approval. All lead MAJCOM
validated and approved flight planning software and systems are authorized. AFMC
crewmembers are responsible for ensuring correct entry of flight planning data. The Unit
Commander will ensure aircrews are properly trained to use authorized flight planning software.
2.6. Weather. For authorized weather sources, refer to AFH 11-203V2, Weather for Aircrews,
the Flight Information Handbook (FIH) or use a published MAJCOM-approved source. If
unable to obtain weather information, pilots may fly in VMC to a point where contact may be
established with an authorized weather source.
2.6. (AFMC)Weather. Aircrews will obtain required flight weather support from one of the
following sources (in priority order): Local military, base weather unit, or combat weather team
(CWT); servicing AF operational weather squadron (OWS); another military weather unit (AF
CWT or OWS, Navy, or Marine unit); FAA weather forecast or flight weather briefing agency
(or equivalent overseas). When military weather service is not available or incomplete, aircrews

will obtain weather by any means possible, to include nearest flight service station (FSS), foreign
military, civilian automatic terminal information service (ATIS), direct user access terminal
system, (DUATS), through fixed base operators, etc. If aircrews have any questions about
weather information obtained from an Internet source (OWS, CWT, or other), they will contact
that source or, if unavailable, contact a weather forecaster from one of the above sources.
2.7. Briefings. Prior to flight, the PIC must ensure each crewmember and passenger is briefed
on items affecting safety or mission completion. At a minimum, briefings will include:
   2.7.1. Emergency procedures.
   2.7.2. Aircrew and Passenger flight equipment/systems usage information (see para. 6.2.).
   2.7.3. Safety precautions and restrictions (including electronic device prohibitions).
   2.7.4. Special procedures and instructions for use during training, formation, or operational
   missions.
2.8. Printed Information Guides. Lead commands will supplement verbal briefings with
printed information guides for passenger use according to DoD 4515.13-R on all aircraft
designated as passenger-carrying. Printed guides do not substitute for verbal briefings.
MAJCOMs may exempt aircraft from this requirement if the printed guides create a safety
hazard.
2.8. (AFMC)Printed Information Guides. Passenger briefing guide requirements are listed in
AFI 11-2FTV3.
2.9. Electronic Devices. The PIC will prohibit the use of any device suspected of creating
interference with any system on the aircraft. Devices that transmit through an antenna are
prohibited from use during all phases of flight except as noted below. For the purposes of this
AFI, characteristics of ―portable‖ devices include items that: cannot be installed as standard
equipment, are carried/loaded onto the aircraft prior to flight, are removed after the flight is
completed, and the extent of the electrical interface with the aircraft is at most electrical power
and a data interface port (such as RJ-45). Lead or user MAJCOMs shall ensure that required
testing is conducted IAW MIL-STD 464 and MIL HANDBOOK 516. The following
prohibitions apply to each passenger and crewmember aboard a USAF aircraft or UAS control
station:
   2.9.1. Cellular Phones. The PIC will ensure that cellular phones, pagers, wireless internet
   capable devices and similar cell phone technology devices are turned off and stowed from the
   time the aircraft leaves its parking spot for departure until clear of the runway after landing.
   2.9.2. Medical Equipment. Normally, only medical equipment referenced in the aircraft
   flight manual or AFI 11-2MDS series is permitted. The 77 AESG/TFL Aeromedical Test
   Branch is responsible for certifying medical equipment for flight from both aircraft and
   patient safety standpoints. Their contact information is as follows: 77 AESG/TFL, 7980
   Lindberg Landing, Brooks-City Base TX 78235-5104, DSN 240-1187.
   2.9.3. Portable Non-transmitting Devices Authorized Anytime. The following devices
   that do not transmit a signal through an antenna may be used at any time: hearing aids, heart
   pacemakers, watches, hand-held calculators, electric shavers, and equipment certified IAW
   paragraph 2.9.6. Personal camera use is prohibited during solo flight.
AFI11-202V3_AFMCSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2011                                                           17


     2.9.3.1. (Added-AFMC) Fighter/Trainer/Attack Aircraft. The use of hand-held cameras
     in single-seat aircraft is prohibited. Cameras are authorized for photo chase mission in
     multiple seat aircraft (fighter/trainer/attack), provided the individuals authorized will not
     actively control the aircraft simultaneously. Only aerial photography personnel (AFSC
     3VXXX) can perform photographer duties, refer to AFI 11-2FTV1.
     2.9.3.2. (Added-AFMC) All Other Aircraft. The aircraft commander may approve the
     use of cameras in flight.
  2.9.4. Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC). The following conditions apply to
  the use of electronic devices other than cellular phones during flight in IMC:
     2.9.4.1. Portable Transmitting Devices. Portable transmitting devices such as hand-
     held radios and satellite phones not certified as part of the aircraft equipment shall not be
     operated at any time when in IMC.
     2.9.4.1. (AFMC) AFMC/A3V delegates approval to use portable transmitting devices in
     VMC that comply with the Mil Standards specified in Para. 2.9.6 of this instruction to
     Configuration Control Board (CCB) Authority of T-2 modifications. Forward copies of
     approvals via AFMC Form 73 to HQ AFMC/A3V. Forward other requests, not covered
     by CCB authority, to use portable transmitting devices to HQ AFMC/A3V for approval.
     The request will contain a justification for use; information-demonstrating compliance
     with the Mil Standards as specified in Para. 2.9.6 of this instruction, and the duration of
     the requirement. Refer to paragraph 2.9.3 above for use of photographic equipment (to
     include hand held cameras, video recorders and digital cameras).
     2.9.4.2. Portable Non-transmitting Devices above 10,000 ft. Above Ground Level
     (AGL). The PIC may authorize the use of: audio-visual recorders, digital cameras,
     computers and their peripherals, electronic entertainment devices, and antenna-connected
     receivers.
     2.9.4.3. Portable Non-Transmitting Devices below 10,000 ft. AGL. All devices that
     do not transmit through an antenna may be operated below 10,000 foot AGL when in
     IMC only when they have been certified as safe-to-fly IAW 2.9.6. The responsible
     AFMC aircraft program office must authorize the use of devices under this paragraph
     through the AF Form 1067 submittal process for flight authorization.
  2.9.5. Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC). MAJCOMs may approve the use of
  portable transmitting devices (other than cell phones) such as hand-held radios and satellite
  phones during flights in VMC if there is a valid operational need that cannot be met by any
  other means. MAJCOMs shall ensure that testing is conducted IAW MIL-STD 464 and MIL
  HANDBOOK 516 and will advise HQ AFFSA/A3O of any authorization provided under this
  paragraph. During VMC flight (other than takeoff or landing) the PIC may authorize the use
  of the following non-transmitting devices: audio-visual recorders, digital cameras,
  computers and their peripherals, electronic entertainment devices, and antenna-connected
  receivers.
  2.9.6. Testing Requirements. Devices that are not authorized for flight in the above
  paragraphs must be tested in accordance with MIL-STD-461F, ―Requirements for the
  Control of Electromagnetic Interference Characteristics of Subsystems and Equipment,‖ to
  determine their suitability for use in flight. Technical guidance, advice on testing

   afi11-202.emi.cert@wpafb.af.mil. ASC/ENAD maintains a General Certification Letter
   that lists devices of general interest that have been evaluated for flight. This letter is
   available at: https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/CoP/EntryCoP.asp?Filter=OO-EN-AS-14
2.10. International Destinations. The PIC will comply with international procedures in FLIP
GP, Area Planning (AP), and the FCG. See paragraph 2.16 and AFMAN 11-217, Volume 3, for
supplemental information on oceanic flight.
   2.10.1. The PIC shall enhance pre- and post-flight aircraft checks on all flights with a
   destination other than the country of departure. Checks will include the manifest of all
   personnel, cargo and likely areas aboard the aircraft where drugs, contraband, stowaways or
   other illegal substances may be concealed.
   2.10.2. Immediately report any suspected customs, agriculture or immigration violations to
   the proper authorities.
2.11. Mountainous Terrain. In the absence of other MAJCOM guidance, USAF aircrews shall
consider as mountainous: those areas defined in 14 CFR §95.11 for CONUS, Alaska, Hawaii
and Puerto Rico. For all other areas of operation, use a 500 ft surface elevation change over a ½
NM distance to define the location of mountainous terrain.
2.12. Hazardous Cargo. The PIC must ensure compliance with AFJI 11-204, Operational
Procedures for Aircraft Carrying Hazardous Materials.
2.13. Transport of Drugs. The PIC will not allow the transport of narcotics, marijuana,
controlled substances or other dangerous drugs on USAF aircraft unless such transport has been
pre-approved by a US Military, Federal, or State authority.
2.14. Foreign Object Damage (FOD) Hazards. MAJCOMs will provide guidance for aircrew
and passengers to ensure the wearing of jewelry (or other personal accoutrements) aboard the
aircraft, in a UAS control station and on the flight line do not create a FOD hazard.
2.14. (AFMC)Foreign Object Damage (FOD) Hazards. Crewmembers, maintenance
engineering support personnel (MESP), mission essential ground personnel (MEGP) and
operational support fliers will not wear finger rings, scarves, pins, wigs, hair pieces, ornaments,
barrettes, clips, earrings, and other hair fasteners made of leather, plastic, or metal while
performing crew duties in or around the aircraft. Additionally, these items are prohibited for all
occupants of ejection seat-equipped aircraft. Other items will be properly secured to minimize
foreign object damage (FOD) risk. PICs will ensure that passengers wearing these items do not
create a FOD hazard.
2.15. Equipment Required for Flight. USAF aircraft cockpits and RPA control stations must
always provide full-time attitude, altitude, and airspeed information and the capability to
recognize, confirm, and recover from unusual attitudes in all pilot positions.
   2.15.1. Flight Instrumentation. Lead commands will define display requirements for
   aircraft not certified or authorized for instrument flight. Displays must always be positioned
   and arranged in a manner to enable an effective crosscheck. UAS ground stations must
   provide the pilot equivalent information appropriate to the system’s autonomy. HQ
   USAF/A3O is the final authority and must endorse electronic and single medium displays
AFI11-202V3_AFMCSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2011                                                           19


   and standby or emergency instruments as a Primary Flight Reference (PFR) before the
   instruments are used as a stand-alone reference for instrument flight. HQ AFFSA must
   evaluate any changes to cockpit instrumentation. The following instrumentation must always
   be displayed to the pilot (and illuminated during night operations) in USAF cockpits and
   UAS ground stations:
   2.15.1. (AFMC) Submit endorsement requests for single medium displays to HQ
   AFMC/A3V for coordination.
       2.15.1.1. Climb/Dive Angle (or pitch and vertical velocity)
       2.15.1.2. Bank Angle
       2.15.1.3. Barometric Altitude
       2.15.1.4. Indicated or Calibrated Airspeed
       2.15.1.5. Prominent Horizon Reference
       2.15.1.6. Heading
       2.15.1.7. Appropriate fault indications (off flags) for instruments, PFRs and UAS lost
       communication links must be operative.
   2.15.2. Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC). Flights in IMC also require
   operational: pitot heat, anti-icing and/or de-icing equipment designed to cope with the type
   and severity of known or forecast icing conditions. Such equipment is not required for brief
   exposures when climbing or descending to an operating altitude above or below the icing
   condition.
   2.15.3. Night Flight. (N/A for UAS operations) In addition to the requirements of
   paragraphs 5.12. and 5.20., a pilot must not operate an aircraft at night unless it is equipped
   with cockpit lighting sufficient to allow crewmembers to view required instrument panels,
   controls, and read required charts, FLIP, instrument approach plates and other navigation
   materials. Each crewmember must have an operable flashlight.
       2.15.3.1. Use an authorized weather source, the latest version of the Air Almanac,
       MAJCOM-approved computer program or US Naval Observatory data to determine and
       calculate light and moon data. See glossary for definitions of night and civil twilight.
   2.15.4. Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) Equipment Requirements. RPAs must meet
   equipage requirements for the class of airspace for which they intend to operate. If not
   suitably equipped, the RPA may only be flown in appropriate special-use airspace or under
   the provisions of a COA.
2.16. Communications, Navigation and Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM)
Systems and Procedures. For flights that operate under instrument flight rules (IFR), the
aircraft must have a two-way radio and navigation equipment compatible with the airspace
where the operations occur. IAW AFPD 63-13, CNS/ATM and Navigation Safety Performance
for USAF Aircraft, CNS/ATM and navigation safety systems integrated on USAF aircraft must
provide an equivalent level of performance and safety to civil standards. The lead MAJCOM
and system developer ensures the aircraft is properly certified and operationally approved before
use.
20                                          AFI11-202V3_AFMCSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2011


  2.16.1. Certification. The term ―properly certified‖ indicates that performance of the
  aircraft systems has been assessed IAW AFI 63-1301, Assurance of CNS/ATM and
  Navigation Safety Performance, to ensure compliance with paragraph 2.15. and this section.
  Civil standards may be obtained from the HQ AFFSA/A3ON Community of Practice web
  site at: https://wwwd.my.af.mil/afknprod/affsa-a3on, or via aircraft certification matrices
  maintained by 853 ELSG/NT (https://igatm.hanscom.af.mil).
  2.16.1. (AFMC) NAV systems installed during aircraft production or fleet-wide (TCTO)
  modification, conforming to the specifications found in AFI 63-1301 are approved for use in
  enroute operations. Installation and use of other navigation systems requires coordination
  with the responsible Sustainment Group/Wing (ALC) and System Group/Wing (formerly
  known as System Program Office). Engineering and certification authority for test bed
  aircraft resides with the contractor and/or responsible test organization.
  2.16.2. Operational approval. Lead MAJCOMs approve operational use of CNS/ATM and
  navigation safety systems. MAJCOMs shall ensure that required aircrew and maintainer
  proficiency and training is maintained and documented, and that flight manuals, technical
  orders, and operating instructions are updated to include appropriate procedures and
  information on CNS/ATM use and functions. MAJCOMs must provide explicit guidance to
  aircrews defining what capabilities, qualifications, and restrictions apply to installed
  CNS/ATM equipment on all applicable MDSs, to include remote/oceanic operations (i.e.,
  GPS primary means, MNPS, RNP 10, RNP 4, etc), RNAV en route, terminal, and approach
  operations (i.e., Baro-VNAV, RNAV 2, RNAV 5/B-RNAV, RNAV 1/P-RNAV, etc),
  RVSM, etc. MAJCOMs should provide standard operating procedures for flight in oceanic
  (or applicable MNPS) airspace, including checklists for inflight use, as necessary.
  2.16.3. Navigation Specification. Aircraft must meet the navigation specification of the
  airspace or procedure being flown. Specific performance infrastructure requirements are
  defined for each navigation specification. An aircraft approved for a RNP or RNAV
  specification having a stringent accuracy requirement is not automatically approved for a
  navigation specification having a less stringent requirement (e.g., RNP 0.3 or RNAV 1 does
  not imply RNP 4 or RNAV 5 compliance) because different navigation specifications have
  different performance, equipage and infrastructure assumptions.
  2.16.4. GPS/RNAV Equipment. Air Force GPS/RNAV systems are divided into three
  basic categories: portable GPS units, mission enhancement systems and systems meeting
  FAA requirements for IFR use.
     2.16.4.1. Portable GPS Units (PGUs). PGUs include commercial hand-held GPS
     receivers, military precision lightweight GPS receivers (PLGRs), and PLGRs coupled
     with a laptop computer that incorporates moving map displays. They are intended to be
     used in aircraft as situational awareness tools only. MAJCOMs shall publish guidance on
     the use of PGUs, approve their software and develop programs to ensure aircrews receive
     proper training on these systems before permitting their use. PGUs are authorized for use
     with the following restrictions: PGUs shall not be used for IFR navigation, instrument
     approaches, or as a primary flight reference and will not be used as a substitute for any
     required flight equipment. PGUs must be tested IAW requirements of paragraph 2.9.6.
     2.16.4.1. (AFMC) Portable GPS Units (PGU) may be used in VMC conditions on
     AFMC aircraft. These systems will not replace existing navigation equipment and will
AFI11-202V3_AFMCSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2011                                                           21


     not be used as the sole means of navigation nor interfere with accomplishment of normal
     in-flight duties.
        2.16.4.1.1. (Added-AFMC) Software developed for use with PGUs containing
        moving map displays requires HQ AFMC/A3V approval. Submit supporting
        documentation with the approval request.
        2.16.4.1.2. (Added-AFMC) Units will develop a training program tailored to the
        specific PGU that will be used and submit to AFMC/A3V for approval. Document
        training with a memorandum for record in Section V of the individual’s aircrew
        training folder.
     2.16.4.2. Mission enhancement systems. These systems are intended to enhance
     mission capability when conducting tactical operations such as weapons delivery and
     airdrop. Systems that do not comply with the minimum standards of Technical Standards
     Order (TSO) C-129/C-129a will not be used for instrument navigation without specific
     MAJCOM approval. MAJCOMS that approve the use of these systems for en route
     navigation must publish specific usage guidance and restrictions. Mission enhancement
     systems will not be used for terminal operations except when they are part of a navigation
     system capable of self-contained instrument approaches as outlined in paragraph 8.17.6.
     2.16.4.2. (AFMC) Mission enhancement systems, when verified against other
     NAVAIDs, may be used to update the INS position for enroute instrument navigation.
     2.16.4.3. Systems Meeting Civil Requirements For IFR Use. The following guidance
     covers those systems that are properly certified and approved for operational use.
     Comply also with AFMAN 11-217 Volume 1, Instrument Flight Procedures, RNAV
     approach procedures.
        2.16.4.3.1. RAIM Prediction. Pilots shall always ensure RAIM availability prior to
        commencing an RNAV procedure (departure, arrival or approach) using any
        MAJCOM-approved RNAV equipment. If TSO-C129 equipment is used solely to
        satisfy the RNAV requirement, RAIM availability must be confirmed for the intended
        route of flight (route and time) using current GPS satellite information. Pilots may
        choose to monitor the status of each satellite in its plane/slot position, account for the
        latest GPS constellation NOTAMs, and compute RAIM availability using model-
        specific RAIM prediction software, by using an en route and terminal RAIM
        prediction      websites     such     as:       http://www.raimprediction.net           or
        http://augur.ecacnav.com/augur/app/home, or by contacting a flight service
        station. Receiver RAIM prediction capability may also be used. In the event of a
        predicted, continuous loss of RAIM, pilots should delay or re-route where RAIM
        requirements can be met if GPS is their only means of meeting the required RNAV
        performance. Pilots must continually assess their navigation capability in case of
        GPS failure. In the NAS only, if TSO-C145/146 equipment is used to satisfy the
        RNAV requirement, RAIM prediction need not be accomplished if Wide-Area
        Augmentation Service (WAAS) coverage is confirmed available along the route of
        flight.
        2.16.4.3.2. Flying RNAV Approaches. MAJCOMs must approve the use of Flight
        Mission Computers (FMC) or Flight Management Systems (FMS) guidance to fly
22                                      AFI11-202V3_AFMCSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2011


     approaches with or without ―GPS‖ or ―or GPS‖ in the title. Pilot using suitable
     RNAV equipment to fly an approach must extract the entire procedure from a current
     database, and may not alter the extracted procedure.
     2.16.4.3.3. RNAV Substitution. On procedures developed by a US TERPS
     authority (FAA/USAF/USN), or on WGS-84 compliant procedures reviewed by
     MAJCOM TERPS, MAJCOM-approved suitable RNAV systems may be used as a
     substitute means of navigation for a named fix, VOR, TACAN, NDB, DME or
     compass locator. In such terminal areas, following a successful predictive RAIM
     check, approved RNAV systems may be substituted for required NAVAIDS or
     named fixes on arrivals, departures, and non-localizer based instrument procedures.
     Any such substitution must be extracted from a current database. These operations
     are allowable even when a facility is explicitly identified as required on a procedure
     (e.g., ―Note ADF required‖), but not if the procedure is NOTAM’ed as NA. Pilots
     using approved RNAV systems as a substitute means of navigation guidance in lieu
     of an out of service NAVAID should advise ATC of this intent and capability. Pilots
     will tune, identify, monitor and display the appropriate ground-based NAVAIDs
     whenever practicable.
     2.16.4.3.4. Terminal Area Operations using RNAV Substitution. Using a
     MAJCOM-approved suitable RNAV system, pilots may determine aircraft position
     over or distance from a VOR, TACAN, NDB, compass locator, DME fix; or a named
     fix defined by a VOR radial, TACAN course, NDB bearing, or compass locator
     bearing intersecting a VOR or localizer course. Further, pilots may navigate to or
     from a VOR, TACAN, NDB, or compass locator, or hold over a VOR, TACAN,
     NDB, compass locator, or DME fix, or fly an arc based upon DME.
     2.16.4.3.5. RNAV Prohibitions. RNAV systems using DME/DME/IRU, without
     GPS or WAAS position input, may only be used as a substitute means of navigation
     when specifically authorized by a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) or other
     FAA/MAJCOM guidance for a specific procedure, NAVAID, or fix. The NOTAM or
     other FAA/MAJCOM guidance authorizing the use of DME/DME/IRU systems will
     also identify any required DME facilities based on an FAA assessment of the DME
     navigation infrastructure.   The following RNAV substitution operations are
     prohibited:
        2.16.4.3.5.1. Substitution of the navigational aid providing lateral guidance for
        the final approach segment of an instrument procedure without reference to the
        raw navigational data.
        2.16.4.3.5.2. Navigation on any localizer-based course without reference to raw
        localizer data.
        2.16.4.3.5.3. Navigation on procedures that are identified as not authorized
        (―NA‖) without exception by a NOTAM. For example, RNAV substitution
        allowances do not apply to a procedure affected by an expired or unsatisfactory
        flight inspection, or if a procedure is based upon a recently decommissioned
        NAVAID.
AFI11-202V3_AFMCSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2011                                                         23


         2.16.4.3.6. RNAV Navigation Augmentation. Space-Based Augmentation (SBAS)
         or Wide-Area Augmentation (WAAS) provide greater fidelity to GPS navigation data
         solutions.    MAJCOMs will approve the use of SBAS/WAAS for en-route and
         terminal operations. These systems must be ―properly certified‖ IAW TSO-C145A or
         TSO-C146A and installed IAW AC 20-130A. MAJCOMs must publish MDS-
         specific guidance and ensure pilots are appropriately trained and/or certified prior to
         authorizing the use of any augmented RNAV navigation solutions.
         2.16.4.3.6. (AFMC) RNAV Navigation Augmentation. Aircraft and equipment that
         have been certified by lead commands for operations with Space-Based
         Augmentation or Wide-Area Augmentation systems are approved for use in AFMC.
             2.16.4.3.6.1. Pilots must check airfield NOTAMs for status and level of service
             available. When the IAP is annotated with the W symbol, site-specific WAAS
             UNRELIABLE NOTAMs or Air Traffic advisories are not provided for outages
             in WAAS Lateral Navigation (LNAV) or Vertical Navigation (VNAV) and
             Localizer-Performance with Vertical Guidance (LPV) service. In this case, pilots
             will use LNAV weather minima, or Baro VNAV, if so equipped, for flight
             planning decisions at these locations.
             2.16.4.3.6.2. When using augmented avionics as the planned approach at a
             required (and otherwise qualified) alternate, pilots will base flight planning
             decisions on the RNAV (GPS) LNAV minima line. Upon arrival at an alternate,
             if SBAS/WAAS is available, then pilots may use vertical guidance to complete
             the approach using the displayed level of service.
  2.16.5. Minimum Navigation Performance Specifications (MNPS) Airspace. Pilots will
  not fly in MNPS airspace until their aircraft is properly certified and approved by the lead
  command.
     2.16.5.1. Aircraft meeting the North Atlantic Track (NAT) MNPS requirements meet the
     Canadian Minimum Navigation Performance Specifications (CMNPS) requirements.
     2.16.5.2. Pilots operating aircraft in NAT airspace designated as MNPS must comply
     with requirements specified in applicable FLIP area planning documents.
     2.16.5.3. Pilots operating aircraft in CMNPS airspace must comply with the
     requirements specified in FLIP AP/1, Chapter 3.
     2.16.5.4. HQ USAF/A3O, through HQ AFFSA, must approve waivers to the
     requirements of NAT MNPS and/or CMNPS airspace.
  2.16.6. Reduced Vertical Separation Minimums (RVSM) Airspace. Pilots will not fly in
  RVSM airspace unless their aircraft is properly certified by the lead command or unless ATC
  provides a clearance allowing entrance of a non-RVSM aircraft into RVSM airspace. Prior
  to operational approval, MAJCOMs will ensure pilots operating aircraft IAW RVSM criteria
  comply with requirements specified in FLIP GP and applicable AP guidance.
     2.16.6.1. Prior to entry into RVSM airspace, the following shall be operating normally:
         2.16.6.1.1. Two primary altitude measurement systems,
         2.16.6.1.2. One automatic altitude control system (autopilot),
 24                                            AFI11-202V3_AFMCSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2011


           2.16.6.1.3. One altitude alerting device, and
           2.16.6.1.4. An operational transponder.
       2.16.6.2. The PIC will notify the controlling agency as soon as possible should any of the
       equipment above fail after entering RVSM airspace.
   2.16.7. Required Navigation Performance (RNP) Airspace. Pilots will not operate in
   RNP airspace unless aircraft systems/equipment are certified IAW applicable civil standards
   and lead commands provide operational approval.
       2.16.7.1. MAJCOMs will ensure that crews are aware of any special conditions or
       limitations associated with operations in each level of RNP airspace.
       2.16.7.2. The applicable RNP level and any equipment conditions or limitations depicted
       on affected FLIP charts and procedures will be followed.
       2.16.7.3. Pilots will advise ATC if an equipment failure or other malfunction results in
       the loss of aircraft capability to continue operating in the designated RNP airspace.
       2.16.7.4. When a specified RNP level cannot be achieved, the pilot should revise the
       route or delay the operation until appropriate RNP level can be ensured.
   2.16.8. Operations within RNP-10 or Basic Area Navigation (BRNAV) Airspace. Pilots
   must ensure their aircraft systems are MAJCOM approved to fly in RNP 10 or RNAV 5/B-
   RNAV airspace. MAJCOM approval to fly in RNP-10 or BRNAV airspace is restricted to
   aircraft systems that are ―properly certified.‖
2.17. Electronic Flight Bags (EFB). Any device, installed or portable, used as an EFB must
provide an equivalent level of safety and performance to that provided by paper products. For
the purpose of this instruction, EFB products include, but are not limited to, laptop computers,
tablet PCs, electronic kneeboards, and tethered displays. See also paragraph 2.3. EFB systems
must comply with the testing requirements of paragraph 2.9.
   2.17.1. EFB Certification and Authorization. Prior to authorizing EFB operations, the
   User MAJCOM will (in coordination with Lead MAJCOM):
       2.17.1.1. Ensure EFBs comply with current guidance in FAA Advisory Circular AC 120-
       76. MAJCOMs should also reference the information stored on the HQ AFFSA
       CNS/ATM CoP: https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/a3on.
       2.17.1.2. Ensure EFB flight manual data (including checklists) is displayed IAW AFI 11-
       215.
       2.17.1.3. Ensure EFB terminal procedure data is displayed identically in format and size
       to the published paper version. The EFB must not require scroll or zoom to view the
       Instrument Approach Procedure (IAP). Alternate formats/sizes of IAPs require
       evaluation of software functionality and human factors by the aircraft program office and
       endorsement by the user/lead command. Forward endorsement through HQ AFFSA for
       HQ USAF/A3O approval.
       2.17.1.4. Ensure EFBs with moving map software or display of own ship position are not
       used as a primary means of navigation (applies to both airborne and ground
AFI11-202V3_AFMCSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2011                                                   25


     operations). This functionality will only be used as a tool to enhance situational
     awareness.
     2.17.1.5. Establish an aircrew training program to certify crews in use of EFBs, to
     include procedures for EFB failure in flight.
     2.17.1.6. Publish written approval prior to aircrew use of EFBs.
     2.17.1.7. Ensure paper publications are carried as a back-up unless paperless cockpit
     transition is complete.
  2.17.2. Paperless Cockpit Transition. Lead and User MAJCOMs transitioning an MDS to
  a paperless cockpit will develop a process which follows the recommended risk mitigation
  practices found in AC 120-76. A 6-month evaluation must be accomplished during which
  back-up paper products must be readily available onboard the aircraft. Following the
  evaluation period, a final reliability report must be submitted to the lead command for
  coordination through HQ AFFSA to HQ USAF/A3O for approval of paperless operations.

                    FLIGHT PLANS AND PASSENGER MANIFESTS

3.1. Flight Plan Requirements. A flight plan enables search and rescue (SAR) agencies to
search for an overdue aircraft. An IFR flight plan communicates the pilot’s desires to ATC.
Approved flight plans include those listed in FLIP GP, an FAA or ICAO Flight Plan form, or a
host nation or MAJCOM-approved form (including computer forms). The PIC will ensure a
flight plan is filed for any flight of a USAF aircraft.
3.1. (AFMC)Flight Plan Requirements. Units may develop a local use flight plan form if
desired. Forward draft forms to AFMC/A3V for review and approval. Flight authorization forms
will be per AFI 11-401 Aviation Management.
   3.1.1. Mission Command and Control (C2). When at a non-military installation and a
   Flight Service Station (FSS) or Air Traffic Control (ATC) are not reachable, the pilot will
   ensure flight following by providing the mission C2 agency the intended route prior to
   takeoff. Once airborne, the PIC will stay clear of Area Defense Identification Zones (ADIZ),
   Buffer Zones, and other restricted airspace, fly VFR in controlled airspace (or IFR IAW
   paragraph 4.6), and file a flight plan with a FSS or ATC facility as soon as practicable.
   3.1.2. Procedures for Units Without a Base Operations. When a written flight plan form
   is not processed through base operations, the flying unit must have a written agreement with
   airfield management outlining the procedures for handling flight movement, messages and
   identifying the agency responsible for flight following.
   3.1.3. Flight Plan Changes. The format for making changes to a flight plan is printed on
   the inside cover of the DoD Flight Supplement. Before takeoff, or while airborne, the PIC
   may make changes to the original filed flight plan without re-filing provided:
       3.1.3.1. The change does not penetrate an ADIZ.
       3.1.3.2. The controlling ATC agency approves the change for an IFR flight.
       3.1.3.3. The PIC ensures the facility providing flight following is notified of the change.
       Failure to ensure a FSS (or its overseas equivalent) is aware of the change may result in
       erroneous SAR efforts or an unannounced arrival at the destination.
       3.1.3.4. The change complies with applicable host-nation rules.
   3.1.4. Destination Notification. If unable to contact the command and control agency, the
   PIC will contact the FSS or equivalent as soon as practicable. The PIC will request the
   destination be advised of the departure time for flight following and to prevent an
   unannounced arrival.
   3.1.5. Closing the Flight Plan. If operating in the NAS on an IFR flight plan into an airport
   with a functioning control tower, the flight plan is automatically closed upon landing. In all
   other cases, the PIC will ensure an activated flight plan is closed through a FSS or ATC
   facility by any means of communication available. If necessary, call long distance collect.
3.2. Passenger Manifests and Crew Lists. List passengers on a DD Form 2131, Passenger
Manifest, or a MAJCOM-approved form. File the manifest and crew list with the flight plan, the
AFI11-202V3_AFMCSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2011                                                            27


passenger service facility, or other responsible agency. Notify C2 prior to departure if there is a
passenger manifest (or crew list) change. When able, process crew and manifest changes with
the original processing facility or with a responsible agency.
3.3. (Added-AFMC) Parachutist Manifests. All parachutists will be listed on DD Form
2131, Passenger Manifest, or AFMC Form 56, Parachutist Jump Schedule. Parachutists will
provide the aircrew with a copy of the manifest or AFMC Form 56, and the aircrew will file this
list with the mission paperwork.

   pertinent aspects of the planned flight, and the PIC of each aircraft in the formation possesses
   an instrument rating (Army and Navy Special and Instrument Ratings, and FAA
   Instrument/Airline Transport Pilot Ratings meet this requirement) if any portion of the flight
   is to be conducted in IMC or under IFR (see paragraph 4.2. above).
4.5. Additional Approval and Requirements.
   4.5.1. Use of Military and Joint Use Airports. Pilots may file to and land at US military
   and Joint-Use (e.g. MIL/CIV) fields unless restricted by the MAJCOM.
   4.5.2. Use of Civil Airports. MAJCOMs may authorize filing to or landing at civil airports.
   Use of civil airports not governed by agreement or law may result in landing fees or use fees
   charged to the pilot or the military unit.
AFI11-202V3_AFMCSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2011                                                           29


  4.5.2. (AFMC) Use of Civil Airports. OG/CCs may authorize operations at civil airports

  Consider items (not inclusive) such as government fuel contract, airfield landing fees, airfield
  entry control procedures, airfield surveillance, airfield security, and rescue/fire response.
  4.5.3. Use of Civil P Airports. Unless restricted by the MAJCOM, pilots may file to or
  land USAF aircraft at US civil airports (P-coded in the En route Supplement):
     4.5.3.1. In an emergency.
     4.5.3.2. When flying a helicopter or C-coded aircraft (e.g. C-130, C-12, C-40)
     4.5.3.3. When necessary in the recovery of active air defense interceptor aircraft.
     4.5.3.4. When this instruction requires an alternate and no other suitable airport is
     available.
     4.5.3.5. When the wing commander or higher authority approves the flight and the
     airport manager grants permission in advance.
     4.5.3.6. When a DoD tenant unit (e.g. ANG) is listed for the airport of intended landing
     and airport facilities or ground support equipment can support the aircraft concerned.
  4.5.4. UAS Airfields. MAJCOMs shall approve all airfields authorized for use by UAS.
  Operations at non-DoD airfields require an approved COA and appropriate Letters of
  Agreement (LOA) between the employing unit, ATC, and airfield management.
  4.5.4. (AFMC) The OG/CC will designate all UAS authorized airfields in the unit
  supplement to AFI 11-2FTV3. Prior to operating out of a new airfield, a site-survey will be
  conducted to review airfield layout, obstacles (close & distant) airspace requirements, and
  any local unique procedures. Notify HQ AFMC/A3V when a site survey has been completed
  and endorsed by the OG/CC.
  4.5.5. Volume Training, Airways and Civil Fields. Flying units shall coordinate with the
  appropriate ATC agencies and civil airport authorities before conducting volume training at
  any civil airports or along/through airways.
  4.5.6. (Added-AFMC) For flights originating and terminating away from home base, the
  Unit Commander will establish local aircrew reporting procedures to ensure monitoring of
  local and cross-country aircraft, crew status, location, and mission status.
  4.5.7. (Added-AFMC) All one-time flights of aircraft (including but not limited to un-
  airworthy/crash-damaged, flight envelop restricted, etc.) require HQ AFMC/A3 approval.
  Proposed flights with any engine or primary aircraft system affecting safety of flight
  inoperative, unless required under an approved test plan, require HQ AFMC/A3 approval (for
  example, landing gear, engines, IFR capability, hydraulic, electrical, fuel, or flight control).
  Maintenance downgrade of Red ―X‖ does not constitute operational approval. Submit
  requests for operational approval, to HQ AFMC/A3V for coordination. The package should
  include as a minimum aircraft history, engineering analysis/coordination, risk analysis, and
  flight restrictions.
  4.5.8. (Added-AFMC) Crew requirements: Table 4.1. lists pilot requirements and
  restrictions when flying AFMC aircraft. Civilian visitors may not operate a set of flight

NOTES:
1. Pilots in this column must be current and qualified.
2. Document OG/CC authorizations/waivers in writing (method determined locally).
3. Dual cockpit fighters and trainers have only one mandatory pilot position, the front cockpit.
Subject to the restrictions in AFI 11-401, Aviation Management, para 1.12.1, and this Table 4.1.,
specifically, OG/CC’s may authorize non-pilots to occupy a non-mandatory crew position. Two
seat fighters and T-38s are not considered dual controlled aircraft.
4.6. Clearance Authority.
    4.6.1. Uncontrolled Airspace. The PIC is the clearance authority for IFR or VFR flight in
    uncontrolled airspace.
    4.6.2. Controlled Airspace. The PIC shall obtain ATC clearance before an IFR departure
    (or as soon as practicable after departure, while maintaining VFR, if contact cannot be
    established on the ground). The PIC is the clearance authority for VFR flight (if allowed) in
    controlled airspace.

4.7. UAS Operations within the NAS. For operations outside special use airspace, the mission
tasking authority shall coordinate through HQ USAF/A3O to obtain a Certificate of
Authorization or Waiver (COA) from the FAA. PICs will verify the COA complies with the
requirements of JO 7610.4, Chapter 12, Section 9.
4.7. (AFMC)UAS Operations within the NAS. If Certificates of Authorization (COA) are
impractical due to characteristics of the Air Vehicle, submit waiver to HQ AFMC/A3V for
staffing to HQ AFFSA/A3OF.
4.8. (Added-AFMC) Aircraft Delivery. AFMC depot aircrews will accomplish aircraft
pickup and delivery to and from depot facilities to the maximum extent unit local mission
requirements allow.

                                GENERAL FLIGHT RULES

5.1. Professional Flying Standards.
   5.1.1. Reckless Flying. The PIC is responsible for ensuring the aircraft is not operated in a
   careless, reckless or irresponsible manner that could endanger life or property.
   5.1.2. Off-Station Training. Commanders will ensure that all off-station training flights
   meet valid training requirements and present a positive image of the Air Force. The PIC
   shall execute off-station training activities to achieve valid training requirements, present a
   positive view of the Air Force and shall ensure no appearance of government waste or abuse
   occurs.
      5.1.2.1. Aviation Into-Plane Reimbursement Card (AIR CARD) Responsibilities.
      The PIC shall use the AIR CARD only for fuel and required ground services. Refuel at
      military installations as a first choice, followed by contract fixed base operators (FBOs).
      Refuel at non-contract FBOs only if mission needs warrant servicing at such locations.
      Further information, including documentation procedures and updated lists of contract
      FBOs, is available at: https://www.airseacard.com.
   5.1.3. Unauthorized Flight Demonstrations.              Unauthorized or impromptu flight
   demonstrations, maneuvers, events or ―fly-bys‖ are prohibited. AFI 11-209, Air Force
   Participation in Aerial Events, addresses authorized flight demonstrations.
   5.1.4. Readiness for Duty. A person shall not act as a crewmember of an aircraft:
      5.1.4.1. While under the influence of alcohol or its after-effects. Aircrew members shall
      not consume alcoholic beverages within 12 hours of take-off.
      5.1.4.2. While using, or while under the influence of, any substance that affects the
      crewmember’s ability to safely perform assigned duties.
      5.1.4.3. Anytime physical or psychological condition is suspect or known to be
      detrimental to the safe performance of flight duty. Consult a flight surgeon at the earliest
      opportunity.
      5.1.4.4. While self-medicating except IAW AFI 48-123, Medical Examinations and
      Standards.       Air Force Surgeon General guidance is available at:
      https://kx.afms.mil/kxweb/dotmil/kjPage.do?cid=CTB_020686&functionalArea=Ae
      rospaceMedicine.
      5.1.4.5. Anytime the crewmember has not obtained the appropriate crew rest IAW
      Chapter 9.
   5.1.5. (Added-AFMC) Any assigned, attached, or temporary duty aircrew member
   involved in a Class A or B mishap will be administratively grounded by the OG/CC
   immediately following the mishap. Any aircrew member involved in a Class A mishap will
   not perform aircrew duties in AFMC assigned aircraft until re-authorized in writing by
   AFMC/A3. Forward copies of all grounding actions to AFMC/A3V and coordinate all return
   to flying status actions for Class A mishaps through AFMC/A3V for AFMC/A3 approval.
AFI11-202V3_AFMCSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2011                                                             35


   Any aircrew member involved in a Class B mishap will not perform aircrew duties in AFMC
   assigned aircraft until re-authorized in writing by the OG/CC. Copies of all relative actions
   will be maintained in section four of affected individual’s training folder.
5.2. Transporting Passengers Under the Influence. The PIC will ensure personnel suspected
to be under the influence of intoxicants or narcotics are not allowed to board a USAF aircraft
except in an emergency or when authorized by competent authority.
5.3. Crew at Stations. Crewmembers must occupy their assigned duty stations from takeoff to
landing, unless absence is normal in the performance of crew duties, or in connection with
physiological needs. Pilots shall not leave their duty station unless another qualified pilot
establishes control of the aircraft.
   5.3.1. While operating outside restricted or warning areas each RPA shall have dedicated
   pilots controlling/monitoring its flight.
5.4. See and Avoid. Pilots operating in VMC, under IFR or VFR, whether or not under radar
control, are always responsible to see and avoid other traffic, terrain, and obstacles.
   5.4.1. Standard IFR separation is provided between aircraft operating under IFR in
   controlled airspace. Within the NAS, ATC provides traffic advisories on VFR aircraft on a
   time-permitting basis. Outside the NAS, the crew should consult ICAO and country specific
   guidance outlined in the FCG and FLIP.
   5.4.2. For UAS operations to comply with see and avoid requirements, the RPA must have
   the capability to detect/sense other traffic in sufficient time to perform an avoidance
   maneuver.
       5.4.2.1. UAS operations that do not comply with paragraph 5.4. will be conducted under
       specific arrangements with appropriate aviation authorities (FAA, host nation, or military
       control). FAA COAs issued IAW JO 7610.4 (Chapter 12, Section 9) or arrangements
       with host-nation aviation authorities do not always waive the CFRs nor provide relief
       from ICAO Rules of the Air. JO 7610.4 outlines an equivalent level of safety
       comparable to see and avoid requirements for manned aircraft. UAS operations in
       compliance with an FAA COA, host-nation aviation authorization or in special use
       airspace are acceptable provided the appropriate equivalent level of safety measures are
       in place with controlling agencies and other airspace users.
5.5. Proximity of Aircraft. The PIC must not allow the aircraft to be flown so close to another
that it creates a collision hazard. Use 500 ft. of separation (well clear) as an approximate guide
except for:
   5.5.1. Authorized formation flights.
   5.5.2. Emergency situations requiring assistance from another aircraft. If an emergency
   requires visual checks of an aircraft in distress, the PIC must exercise extreme care to ensure
   this action does not increase the overall hazard. The capabilities of the distressed aircraft and
   the intentions of the crews involved must be considered before operating near another aircraft
   in flight.
   5.5.3. MAJCOM-approved maneuvers in which participants are aware of the nature of the
   maneuver and qualified to conduct it safely (i.e., interceptor attack training).
 36                                             AFI11-202V3_AFMCSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2011


5.6. Formation Flight.
   5.6.1. Transponder Operations During Air Refueling or Formation Flight. Unless
   otherwise specified in Allied Communications Publication 160, US Supplement 1:
       5.6.1.1. Only one aircraft (normally the lead) of a standard formation will squawk the
       assigned code.
       5.6.1.2. Unless otherwise directed by ATC, all aircraft within a non-standard formation
       flight will squawk the ATC-assigned Mode 3A/C beacon code until established within
       the assigned altitude block and closed to the proper en route interval. When aircraft
       interval exceeds 3 NMs, both the formation leader and the last aircraft will squawk the
       assigned Mode 3A/C beacon code.
       5.6.1.3. Unless otherwise directed, receivers squawk standby when <3NMs from the
       tanker.
   5.6.2. Non-standard Formation Flight. Non-standard formation flights may be conducted:
       5.6.2.1. When approved by ATC, or
       5.6.2.2. Operating under VFR in VMC, or
       5.6.2.3. Operating within an authorized Altitude Reservation (ALTRV), or
       5.6.2.4. Operating under the provisions of a Letter of Agreement (LOA), or
       5.6.2.5. Operating in airspace specifically designed for a special activity.
5.7. Right-of-Way. Each pilot must take whatever action is necessary to avoid collision,
regardless of who has the right-of-way. The yielding aircraft must not pass over, under, abeam,
or ahead of the other aircraft until well clear.
   5.7.1. Distress. Aircraft in distress have the right-of-way over all other air traffic.
   5.7.2. Converging. When converging at approximately the same altitude (except head-on or
   approximately so), the aircraft to the other's right has the right-of-way. Aircraft of different
   categories have the right-of-way in the following order of priority: balloons, gliders, aircraft
   towing or refueling other aircraft, airships, rotary- or fixed-wing aircraft.
   5.7.3. Approaching Head-On. If aircraft are approaching each other head-on or
   approximately so, each shall alter course to the right.
   5.7.4. Overtaking Aircraft. An overtaken aircraft has the right-of-way. The overtaking
   aircraft must alter course to the right.
   5.7.5. Landing. An aircraft established on final approach has the right-of-way over other
   aircraft on the ground or in the air, except when two or more aircraft are approaching to land.
   In this case, the aircraft at the lower altitude has the right-of-way but it shall not use this
   advantage to cut in front of or overtake the other.
5.8. Communication in Flight.
   5.8.1. Air Traffic Control Clearances. The PIC will comply with ATC clearances and
   instructions unless a deviation is necessary due to an in-flight emergency, to ensure safety of
   flight or to comply with a Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) resolution
AFI11-202V3_AFMCSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2011                                                             37


   advisory (RA). Pilots will use standard aviation terminology, in English, from the Pilot-
   Controller glossary, MAJCOM guidance and FLIP when communicating with ATC.
       5.8.1.1. Maintain two-way radio communications with the proper ATC facility or FSS
       IAW the procedures appropriate for the class of airspace as outlined in FLIP.
       5.8.1.2. If the pilot is unsure of any clearance, immediately obtain ATC clarification.
   5.8.2. Transponder Operations. The PIC will ensure an operable transponder is used IAW
   ATC instructions or host nation or MAJCOM directives, SPINS, or for any flight in
   controlled airspace (including MODE 4 when directed). In the NAS, transponders should be
   operated any time the aircraft is moving. For aircraft that are equipped with Mode S, the PIC
   must follow proper usage guidelines as outlined in GP. MAJCOMs will manage assigned
   codes to ensure no two aircraft are airborne with the same Mode-S address/code. Mode 4
   operations are restricted to those necessary, and as outlined in the Flight Information
   Handbook (See MODE 4 in glossary).
   5.8.3. Emergency Frequencies. If suitably equipped, aircrews will monitor at least one
   emergency frequency at all times as mission and operational conditions permit. Immediately
   report distress or ELT transmissions to ATC.
   5.8.4. Radio Frequency Restrictions. Unless specifically authorized by competent
   authority, USAF aircraft will not transmit on frequencies reserved for air navigation (115.95
   – 117.95 MHz, 328.6 – 335.4 MHz). Limit radio traffic on 118.0 – 137.0 MHz frequencies
   to ATC communications. Do not transmit secure voice/data communications on other than
   approved frequencies.
   5.8.5. ATC Communications Failure. Follow the communications failure procedures
   published in the FIH.
   5.8.6. UAS ATC Communications Requirements. For RPA operations in controlled
   airspace two-way radio communications will be the primary means of communications.
   When Ultra High Frequency (UHF)/Very High Frequency (VHF) radios are not available, a
   telephone may be used as a primary means of communication. The PIC shall ensure a
   MAJCOM-approved back-up means of communication is available while the RPA is
   airborne in controlled airspace. For limited range, short duration flights, the PIC may request
   relief from radio requirements from affected ATC agencies provided a suitable alternate
   communication means is available. All UAS units will maintain a current list of landline
   contact information for all ARTCCs, Radar Approach Controls, and Airfield Towers through
   which the RPA may transit on its flight-planned route as well as its planned lost-
   link/emergency route. UAS pilots will include the number of the Ground Control Segment
   (GCS) landline (solely dedicated for ATC use) in the remarks section of the flight plan.
5.9. Aircraft Speed.
   5.9.1. Supersonic Flight. The PIC will not allow the aircraft to operate at or above Mach l
   except as specified in AFI 13-201. Inadvertent flight above Mach 1 will be handled IAW
   AFI 13-201.
   5.9.2. In the NAS. The PIC will:
       5.9.2.1. Not allow their aircraft to exceed 250 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS) below
       10,000 ft. MSL unless the MAJCOM has approved a higher speed IAW paragraph 5.9.5.
 38                                          AFI11-202V3_AFMCSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2011


      5.9.2.1. (AFMC) AFMC approves use of higher speeds IAW paragraph 5.9.5.
      5.9.2.2. Not allow their aircraft to exceed 200 KIAS at or below 2,500 ft. AGL within 4
      NMs of the primary airport of a Class C or Class D airspace area unless authorized by
      ATC, or required to maintain the minimum safe maneuvering airspeed specified in the
      aircraft T.O.
      5.9.2.3. Not allow their aircraft to exceed 200 KIAS in the airspace underlying a Class B
      airspace area or in a VFR corridor designated through Class B airspace area, unless
      required to maintain the minimum safe maneuvering airspeed specified in the aircraft
      T.O.
   5.9.3. Outside the NAS. The PIC will not allow the aircraft to exceed 250 KIAS below
   10,000 ft. MSL unless: in international airspace and mission requirements dictate; ICAO or
   host nation rules permit or it is necessary to maintain the minimum safe airspeed in the
   aircraft T.O.
   5.9.4. Holding. Conduct holding at airspeeds prescribed in FLIP or MDS-specific guidance.
   5.9.5. FAA Speed Authorization. The FAA recognizes that certain military operations and
   training requirements cannot be met under the terms of the 14 CFR §91.117, Aircraft Speed,
   and has therefore granted a speed authorization to the USAF.
      5.9.5.1. Use of FAA Speed Authorization. In the NAS, PICs may operate USAF
      aircraft in excess of 250 KIAS, below 10,000 ft. MSL, only under the following
      conditions:
          5.9.5.1.1. Within restricted areas or Military Operating Areas (MOAs).
          5.9.5.1.2. Within DoD/FAA mutually developed instrument routes or DoD
          developed visual routes. (Do not exceed 250 KIAS on SR routes).
          5.9.5.1.3. Within unpublished joint MAJCOM- and FAA-designated areas or routes.
          This provision is intended to accommodate speed requirements, as necessary to
          accomplish the national defense mission, on an interim basis until the area/route can
          be published
          5.9.5.1.4. On MAJCOM-approved large exercises or short-term special missions
          with appropriate coordination to ensure awareness of the nonparticipating flying
          public.
          5.9.5.1.5. When the aircraft T.O. requires or recommends a higher speed in order to
          maintain safe maneuverability. If the safe maneuvering airspeed in the T.O. is listed
          as a range, fly the slowest speed practical in that range, based on weight and
          configuration. This provision is primarily to accommodate climbs/descents and
          terminal area operations. Airspeeds applicable to this exemption must be published
          in the aircraft T.O. (Dash-1). A MAJCOM supplement or MDS-specific Volume 3
          does not constitute the aircraft flight manual as referenced in the FAA exemption.
5.10. Large Scale Exercises. MAJCOMs will conduct large-scale exercises in permanent or
temporary special-use airspace established according to FAA Handbook 7400.2 and FAA JO
7610.4. When MAJCOMs approve large-scale exercises or short-term special missions they will
AFI11-202V3_AFMCSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2011                                                          39


ensure information on approved activities is available to the non-participating flying public and
coordinate these operations with:
   5.10.1. Affected non-participating military flying units.
   5.10.2. Affected FAA Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCCs).
   5.10.3. Affected FAA regions through the Air Force representative (AFREP).
   5.10.4. Other agencies, as appropriate.
5.11. Airport Operations.
   5.11.1. Ground Operations. Pilots shall comply with AFI 11-218, Aircraft Movement on
   the Ground, and locally-published procedures as applicable.
       5.11.1.1. UAS-specific Ground Operations.               In the absence of MDS-specific
       MAJCOM guidance, PICs must not taxi a RPA prior to takeoff, or after landing, from a
       control station that does not have a line-of-sight link with the RPA.
       5.11.1.2. In the absence of MAJCOM guidance, RPA will not taxi on a controlled
       surface without an escort present who is in continuous communication with the pilot.
       Exception: If the RPA lands at a divert location where no local procedures exist and ATC
       has an unobstructed view of the RPA, the controller may clear the RPA to taxi if deemed
       necessary to vacate its position.
       5.11.1.3. PICs will ensure the aircraft propulsion and all power sources are shut down as
       soon as practical after landing and clearing the controlled surface areas if at a location
       with no GCS and/or unit ground personnel.
       5.11.1.4. If no unit personnel are present to safeguard the RPA, the pilot will coordinate
       appropriate aircraft security until retrieval of the aircraft by military personnel.
       5.11.1.5. MAJCOMs must establish or approve hung ordnance, hot brakes, and other
       safety procedures to ensure the safety of ground personnel, to include diverts.
   5.11.2. Clearances. Obtain clearance from ATC before taxiing, taking a runway, or any
   takeoff or landing at an airport with an operating control tower.
   5.11.3. Taxi Clearance. If a taxi route requires crossing any runway, pilots will hold short
   until obtaining specific clearance to cross each runway. Do not taxi across or onto the
   assigned runway without clearance from ATC.
       5.11.3.1. Surface Movement Guidance and Control System (SMGCS). Pilots of USAF
       aircraft must obtain MAJCOM-directed training and certification before participating in
       actual SMGCS taxi operations. MAJCOMs shall publish MDS-specific guidance for
       aircrews required to operate at SMGCS locations in low visibility.
       5.11.3.1. (AFMC) Surface Movement Guidance and Control System (SMGCS). See
       AFI 11-2FT Vol 1 MDS attachment for specific guidance.
   5.11.4. Uncontrolled Field Procedures. Use the runway favored by the winds if no other
   factors make that runway unacceptable. Announce your activities on the appropriate
   frequency. (Refer to the Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM) and AFMAN 11-217,
   Volume 2, Visual Flight Procedures, for specific procedures.) In the absence of MAJCOM-

   specific guidance, UAS operations are prohibited at uncontrolled fields when other traffic is
   present.
   5.11.5. Land and Hold Short Operations (LAHSO). USAF fixed-wing pilots are
   prohibited from accepting LAHSO clearances.
      5.11.5.1. Pilots of USAF aircraft may passively participate in LAHSO (land or take-off
      when another aircraft has been given a LAHSO clearance). The PIC is the final authority
      whether to take-off, land or continue a touch-and-go when a merging aircraft has received
      a LAHSO clearance.
      5.11.5.2. MAJCOMs of units that require active LAHSO participation for mission
      accomplishment must contact HQ AFFSA/A3OF to ensure MDS-specific data is
      incorporated into FAA Order 7110.199 (Appendix 3).
   5.11.6. Reduced Same Runway Separation (RSRS). MAJCOMs may approve non-
   formation RSRS operations. Procedures are specified by affected ATC and user units.
   MAJCOM approval shall include MDS-specific RSRS criteria governing similar and
   dissimilar landing/touch-and-go/low approach operations.
   5.11.6. (AFMC) Reduced Same Runway Separation (RSRS) is authorized for AFMC
   aircrews per AFI 13-203 AFMC Sup 1.
   5.11.7. Turns after Takeoff, Low Approaches, or Closed Patterns. Do not turn after a
   takeoff, touch and go or low approach until at least 400 ft. above the Departure End of the
   Runway (DER) elevation, at a safe airspeed and past the end of the runway (if visible)
   unless: specifically cleared by the controlling agency or required by a published procedure.
   This restriction does not apply when executing a closed pattern.
   5.11.8. Traffic Pattern Procedures.
      5.11.8.1. At USAF installations fly the traffic pattern published in the local flying
      procedures publication or FLIP, unless otherwise directed.
      5.11.8.2. At other than USAF installations, fly traffic patterns as directed by the control
      tower or published in FLIP, CFR Part 91 Subpart B, or the AIM.
      5.11.8.3. At airports with no control tower, follow the standard light signals or visual
      indicators that prescribe the direction of traffic and landing runway. Departures must
      comply with the appropriate route for the airport. (Refer to AIM for more information.)
      5.11.8.4. Helicopters should avoid the flow of fixed-wing aircraft. Helicopters that
      maintain compatible airspeed may fly in the rectangular pattern with fixed-wing traffic.
   5.11.9. Helicopter Landing Areas. Helicopters may operate from/to other than established
   landing areas (i.e., fields, highways, parks, etc.) if conducting an operational mission or a
   military requirement exists and: the pilot receives permission to use the area for landing,
   safeguards exist to permit operations without hazard to persons or property and no legal
   objections are apparent.
5.12. Night Operations. See also paragraph 2.15.3. At night, the PIC will adhere to the
following guidance:
AFI11-202V3_AFMCSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2011                                                           41


  5.12.1. Fixed wing aircraft must not operate from a runway unless it is outlined with
  operable lighting and is clearly discernible. Covert Infrared runway lighting being used by
  qualified crews equipped with Night Vision Devices (NVDs) meets this requirement.
  Exception: MAJCOM/A3 may authorize their aircraft to operate from unlit runways or
  landing zones (or those using high-intensity runway reflective markers) with the following
  restrictions:
     5.12.1.1. Non-contingency operations are restricted to military airfields or civilian
     airports with an appropriate LOA; and,
     5.12.1.2. MAJCOM must issue MDS-specific operating instructions, including
     comprehensive risk mitigation measures (such as IR lighting requirements, NVD usage,
     non-participating aircraft procedures, NOTAM issuance, weather and lunar illumination
     requirements and Operational Risk Management (ORM) assessments); and,
     5.12.1.3. Aircraft authorized to operate to unlit landing areas must comply with external
     lighting requirements in paragraph 5.20.
     5.12.1.4. (Added-AFMC) Helicopter Night Operations. The OG/CC may authorize
     helicopters on high priority operational or test missions to operate into and from
     unlighted areas as long as all available terrain and obstacle information is studied and all
     available lighting is used. Consideration must be given for the use of parachute flares or
     prepositioning other forms of lighting. Running takeoffs and landings will only be made
     to a runway or taxiway that is clearly discernible by lights. On all other missions
     (training, routine operational, or test missions, etc.), landings into remote and operational
     sites between official sunset and official sunrise are permitted if the mission is authorized
     and accomplished according to an approved night vision goggle (NVG) program or under
     the following conditions: the area is outlined by discernible lights or parachute flares, the
     pilot is familiar with the landing area through review of the site folder, and a daytime
     landing or overflight is accomplished, if feasible.
  5.12.2. In Alaska, areas located north of 60° North latitude, Antarctica, and areas located
  south of 60° South latitude, aircraft may be operated to unlighted airports during the period
  of civil twilight.
  5.12.3. Night Vision Device (NVD) Operations. Aircrew will preflight NVDs prior to each
  use to ensure proper operation and optimum night visual enhancement. MAJCOMs will
  prescribe the use of NVDs during aircraft operations. See also paragraph 6.3.3.
  5.12.3. (AFMC) Night Vision Device (NVD) Operations. Operations and training
  requirements for NVD operations are specified in AFI 11-2FT, Vol 1 and 3.
  5.12.4. Night Approaches. MAJCOMs shall determine procedures governing the use of
  instrument approaches while operating in night VMC.
  5.12.4. (AFMC) Night Approaches. When operating in night VMC, except when mission or
  training requirements dictate otherwise, aircrew will land using precision glidepath guidance.
  This glidepath guidance can either be from a precision instrument approach or from a visual
  glide slope indicator. Additional information on visual glide slope indicators is contained in
  AFMAN 11-217, Volume 1. Aircrew should complete a thorough review of the point of
  intended landing and the surrounding terrain and obstacles prior to arrival.

5.13. Landing Gear Reporting Procedures. Pilots operating retractable gear aircraft must
report "gear down" to the ATC agency or runway supervisory unit after extending the landing
gear. This report shall be made during any approach to an airport prior to crossing the runway
threshold.
5.14. Altitude Requirements. Except for MAJCOM-approved aerial demonstrations/events or
during takeoff or landing, do not operate aircraft:
   5.14.1. Emergency Landing. Below an altitude that, should an emergency landing become
   necessary, creates undue hazard to persons or property.
   5.14.2. VFR. Above 3,000 ft. AGL under VFR at altitudes or flight levels other than those
   specified in FLIP. In airspace under FAA jurisdiction, these altitudes do not apply when
   turning or holding in a holding pattern of 2 minutes or less.
   5.14.3. Congested Areas. Over congested areas (i.e., cities, towns, settlements) or groups
   of people if the altitude does not ensure at least 1,000 ft. above the highest obstacle within a
   2,000-ft. radius of the aircraft. Pilots flying helicopters in FAA airspace or operating IAW
   host nation agreements may operate at lower altitudes and in closer proximity if they do not
   create a hazard to persons or property on the surface.
   5.14.4. Non-congested Areas. Over non-congested areas at an altitude of less than 500 ft.
   AGL except over open water, in special use airspace (SUA), or in sparsely populated areas.
   Under such exceptions, pilots must not operate aircraft closer than 500 ft. to any person,
   vessel, vehicle, or structure. Pilots flying helicopters in FAA airspace may operate at lower
   altitudes and in closer proximity if they do not create a hazard to persons or property on the
   surface.
   5.14.5. Flight over National Recreation Areas and Wildlife Refuges. Less than 2,000 ft.
   AGL (mission permitting) over: National Park Service monuments, seashores, lake shores,
   recreation and scenic river ways; US Fish and Wildlife Service refuges and ranges; and US
   Forest Service wilderness and primitive areas. This paragraph is not applicable to SUA, low-
   altitude tactical navigation areas and MTRs. Specific areas may require higher altitudes (see
   FLIP and sectional aeronautical charts).
   5.14.6. Disaster Areas. Within a designated disaster area unless the aircraft is: aiding the
   area, specifically cleared by ATC or can fly to or from an airport in the area without
   hampering or endangering relief activities. Pilots must check NOTAMS for disaster areas.
5.15. Altimeter Settings. Set altimeters according to FLIP GP, FIH and AP-series documents.
Use temperature correction tables when appropriate. Flight in IMC below FL 180 is not
permitted in any area where the barometric pressure is lower than 28 or higher than 31 inches of
mercury (See AIM 7-2-1 for more information).
5.16. Simulated Instrument Flight.
   5.16.1. Restrictions. The following restrictions apply to simulated instrument flight:
       5.16.1.1. The aircraft must be equipped with a functional two-way radio.
       5.16.1.2. A safety observer, able to see outside at all times, should accompany the flight,
       either as a crewmember or in a chase aircraft. If a chase aircraft is used, maintain
       continuous visual contact and two-way communications between aircraft. A safety
AFI11-202V3_AFMCSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2011                                                              43


      observer is defined as an instrument qualified pilot, a fighter weapons systems operator
      (or other MAJCOM-designated aircrew member) with access to a set of flight controls.
      5.16.1.3. MAJCOMs may authorize UAS to conduct simulated instrument flight
      provided the aircraft has sense and avoid capabilities as outlined in paragraph 5.4.2.
   5.16.2. Practice Instrument Approaches. Approaches conducted in other than actual IMC.
   The pilot must still be able to see the ground, surrounding terrain, and when established on
   the final segment of the approach, the airport environment. Practice instrument approaches,
   including approaches flown under VFR will be conducted IAW Chapter 8 of this instruction.
   Practice approaches may be conducted without a safety observer (as defined in paragraph
   5.16.1.2) if the pilot is instrument qualified and current in the type of approach flown. When
   flying a practice approach without a safety observer, the pilot must maintain a composite
   crosscheck that maintains situational awareness with terrain and other traffic. The pilot is not
   relieved of the responsibility to see and avoid other traffic, terrain and obstacles.
   5.16.3. Vision Restricting Devices. MAJCOMs must approve the use of vision restricting
   devices (e.g., hoods, Foggles, etc) and provide specific approval for their use during takeoffs
   and landings. Vision restricting devices will not be used without a safety observer.
   5.16.3. (AFMC) Use of vision restricting devices during takeoffs and landings is approved
   when required by a test plan. Observers will be pilot qualified in the aircraft flown, have
   direct access to the flight controls, have full view of the flight instruments, and be able to see
   outside.
      5.16.3.1. Maintain at least 2,000 ft of obstruction clearance when using vision restricting
      devices if the safety observer is in a chase aircraft, is not qualified as a pilot, or does not
      have full view of the flight instruments and access to the flight controls.
5.17. Simulated Emergency Flight Procedures:
   5.17.1. Restrictions. The following restrictions apply to simulated emergencies:
      5.17.1.1. Do not practice emergency procedures with passengers on board. Non-flight
      deck crewmembers may accomplish emergency procedures or medical emergency
      training with passengers on board provided there is no interference with the cockpit crew
      and mission requirements.
      5.17.1.2. Single pilot aircraft require day (including civil twilight), VMC.
      5.17.1.3. Multi-pilot aircraft in day IMC require weather conditions at or above
      published circling minimums for the approach to be flown.
      5.17.1.4. Multi-pilot aircraft at night require weather conditions at or above 1,000 ft.
      ceiling and 2 SMs visibility or circling minimums, whichever is higher.
   5.17.2. Simulated Flameout, Forced Landing, or Emergency Landing Patterns
   (SFO/ELP). At controlled fields where SFO/ELP maneuvers are conducted, the facility air
   traffic manager shall issue a letter of agreement with the appropriate military authority and
   adjacent facilities as required. The letter of agreement (LOA) shall conform to FAA Joint
   Order (FAA JO) 7610.4, chapter 9.
   5.17.3. MAJCOM Responsibilities.
 44                                             AFI11-202V3_AFMCSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2011


   5.17.3. (AFMC) Guidance for practicing emergency procedures is contained in AFI 11-
   2FTV3 and the MDS specific attachments. The OG/CC may approve exceptions only when
   required as part of an approved test plan. Document approval on the flight authorization.
       5.17.3.1. MAJCOMs must provide guidance for SFO/ELP approaches when: the T.O.s
       do not provide specific guidance; the approaches do not conform to the T.O. guidance;
       the approaches have not been coordinated with the ATC responsible for the airspace or
       the airport/landing area does not have: a prepared runway surface, an active tower/RSU,
       enough runway or proper crash/rescue equipment.
       5.17.3.2. MAJCOMs must provide guidance when an instructor pilot or flight examiner
       does not have immediate access to the aircraft controls.
       5.17.3.2. (AFMC) See AFI 11-2FTv3 for additional guidance.
       5.17.3.3. MAJCOMs must provide guidance to minimize actual engine shutdown when a
       reduction of power suffices.
       5.17.3.3. (AFMC) See AFI 11-2FTv3 for additional guidance.
       5.17.3.4. (Added-AFMC) The OG/CC may allow a Federal Aviation Administration
       (FAA) flight examiner to observe pilot or flight engineer performance for an airline
       transport pilot or flight engineer qualification evaluation given as part of an Air Force
       checkride. The FAA flight examiner will occupy an observer position only. All
       restrictions of this supplement apply. Field units will retain a copy of the written approval
       for 2 years. Refer to AFI 11-401 and DoD 4515.13-R for additional guidance.
5.18. Touch-and-Go Landings.
   5.18.1. MAJCOMs must authorize touch-and-go landings for command-operated aircraft.
   The authorization will include explicit guidance on operating conditions and qualifications.
   5.18.1. (AFMC) Touch-and-go landings are authorized in any command operated aircraft
   provided all requirements of AFI 11-2FTV3 and AFI 11-2FT Vol 1 are met.
   5.18.2. Touch-and-go landings are authorized if required by courses listed in the Air Force
   Education        Training        Course      Announcement          (ETCA)          database
   (https://etca.randolph.af.mil/).
5.19. Dropping Parachutists or Objects or Fuel Jettison. The PIC will not allow the
dropping of parachutists or objects, or jettison of fuel from the aircraft except in an emergency or
when required for mission accomplishment.
   5.19.1. MAJCOM Responsibilities. MAJCOMs will ensure airdrops comply with
   applicable directives.
   5.19.1. (AFMC) Parachutist airdrops will be conducted according to AFI 11-410, Personnel
   Parachute Operations. Other airdrops will be conducted under approved test plans or locally
   developed procedures.
   5.19.2. PIC Responsibilities. The PIC will:
       5.19.2.1. When jettisoning fuel and circumstances permit, notify the appropriate ATC or
       flight service facility of intentions, altitude, location, and when the operation is complete.
AFI11-202V3_AFMCSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2011                                                              45


       5.19.2.2. Drop chaff containing rope elements IAW AFI 13-201 and JO 7610.4.
       5.19.2.3. Report any accidental loss of equipment or aircraft parts or jettisoning of fuel
       or cargo IAW AFMAN 10-206, Operational Reporting, and AFMAN 91-223, Aviation
       Safety Investigations and Reports.
5.20. Aircraft Lighting.
   5.20.1. Reduced Lighting. MAJCOMs may authorize reduced or light-out operations in
   restricted areas, warning areas or host nation approved areas. Host nation approved areas
   may be documented in a LOA or host nation regulatory documentation.
   5.20.1. (AFMC) Reduced or light-out operations within restricted and warning areas are
   approved for AFMC aircraft when operational or test requirements dictate. OG/CC will
   establish policies for such lighting in the unit supplement to AFI 11-2FTV3.
   5.20.2. Aircraft Lighting During Formation Operations. MAJCOMs may authorize
   formation flights to vary their lighting configuration according to the aircraft type and
   mission requirement. The MAJCOM must provide guidance on this type of operation and
   ensure the guidance provides an equivalent level of visual identification as a single aircraft.
   5.20.2. (AFMC) When operating outside restricted or warning areas and in standard
   formation, one aircraft in the formation will display appropriate lighting. Others may operate
   with reduced lighting as safety, operational and test conditions permit. If a requirement exists
   to operate outside of restricted or warning areas with reduced lighting and not in standard
   formation, units must coordinate requests for a waiver through AFMC/A3V to HQ
   AFFSA/A3OF.
   5.20.3. Position Lights. Illuminate all position lights between official sunset and sunrise:
       5.20.3.1. Immediately before engine start and when an engine is running. Aircraft that
       do not have power available before start shall turn them on as soon as power is available.
       5.20.3.2. When parked in an area likely to create a hazard or while being towed, unless
       clearly illuminated by an outside source.
   5.20.4. Anticollision and Strobe Lights. Anticollision lights and strobe lights are not the
   same. For the purposes of this section, anti-collision lights are the primary flashing light
   system on the aircraft intended to attract the attention of others to enhance see and avoid
   operations, while strobe lights are systems such as wingtip strobes or other similar strobe
   light installations.
       5.20.4.1. Ground Operations. Aircraft equipped with anticollision lights will display
       these lights IAW AFI 11-218, Aircraft Operations and Movement on the Ground.
       5.20.4.2. Airborne Operations. Aircraft equipped with anticollision and strobe lights
       will operate these lights as follows:
          5.20.4.2.1. Anticollision lights must be on from takeoff to landing.
          5.20.4.2.2. Strobe lights shall be operated IAW MAJCOM or aircraft T.O. guidance.
          5.20.4.2.3. The PIC may turn off anticollision lights when required for safety.
 46                                           AFI11-202V3_AFMCSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2011


          5.20.4.2.4. The PIC may continue a mission with the failure of any light of the
          anticollision light system to the first practical stop where repairs can be made.
   5.20.5. Landing Lights. Aircraft must have at least one operable landing light. Helicopters
   equipped with a searchlight that provides sufficient light for landing may substitute that for
   an operable landing light. Covert landing lights meet this requirement during NVD use.
       5.20.5.1. Landing lights will be illuminated below 10,000 ft. MSL, day or night, within
       operational constraints.
       5.20.5.2. When mission requirements dictate, use of landing lights is optional during
       take-off/landing, if the aircraft is equipped with an operational sensor that provides a
       visual representation of the runway environment. Operations must comply with
       paragraph 5.12.1.
       5.20.5.3. When other aircraft are operating in the pattern, landing light off operations
       should be limited to specific training and operational requirements.
5.21. Aerobatics and Air Combat Tactics. Aerobatics, air combat tactics and air to ground
tactics which involve aerobatic type maneuvering must be performed in SUA, ATC-Assigned
Airspace (ATCAA), MTRs or host nation approved airspace IAW the guidelines in AFI 11-214,
Aircrew, Weapons Director, and Terminal Attack Controller Procedures for Air Operations.
Aircraft deployed or based at overseas locations will operate IAW applicable host nation
agreements or ICAO SARPs. If the aircraft operating requirements (altitude requirements,
maximum airspeeds, dropping of objects, etc) dictated in the host nation agreement are less
restrictive than USAF/MAJCOM guidance, the most restrictive guidance shall be used.
5.21. (AFMC)Aerobatics and Air Combat Tactics. Air Combat Tactics will adhere to
guidelines of AFI 11-2FTV3. Aerobatic maneuvers will not be performed below 5,000 feet
AGL. Exception: Flight maneuvers approved according to AFI 11-209, Air Force Participation
in Aerial Events, and applicable volumes of AFI 11-246, Air Force Aircraft Demonstrations, as
part of an authorized air show.
5.22. Participating in Aerial Events.
   5.22.1. The PIC will ensure compliance with AFI 11-209, when participating in aerial
   events, demonstrations, and static displays.
   5.22.2. When a NOTAM imposes a TFR during an airshow, major sporting event, natural
   disaster, etc, no aircraft may operate in the designated airspace except IAW the authorization,
   terms and conditions of the TFR.
5.23. Tobacco Use on USAF Aircraft. Tobacco use is prohibited on USAF or contract aircraft.
5.24. Landing With Hot Armament. MAJCOMs will ensure units develop procedures for
handling aircraft that land with live armament to ensure the safe conduct of such operations.
5.24. (AFMC)Landing with Hot Armament. Units that conduct operations with live
armament will publish procedures for live/hung ordnance in the unit supplement to AFI 11-
2FTV3, local airfield operations instructions, and in-flight guide.
   5.24.1. Before landing with hot armament or practice munitions at any airfield where such
   procedures are not known, the PIC must:
AFI11-202V3_AFMCSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2011                                                          47


       5.24.1.1. Advise the tower of the circumstances, and
       5.24.1.2. Advise transient alert and other appropriate agencies, and
       5.24.1.3. Request taxi instructions to a designated safe (de-arm) area.
   5.24.2. After landing, the PIC must:
       5.24.2.1. Avoid taxiing into an area that could threaten personnel or equipment, and
       5.24.2.2. Ensure the ground crew is aware of the armament on board, and
       5.24.2.3. Request assistance from the nearest Air Force facility, if necessary.
   5.24.3. (Added-AFMC) Aircraft will not be delivered to a contractor facility with hot
   armament on board unless delivery is specifically required by the contract and approved by
   the cognizant contract administration office.
5.25. Pilot Reporting Procedures. In addition to the reporting requirements listed elsewhere in
this instruction, AIM, AFMAN 11-217 series, or ICAO/host-nation instructions, pilots will
report:
   5.25.1. Position. Pilots will report their position as requested by ATC and as required by
   host-nation or ICAO flight procedures in uncontrolled airspace. Use the position reporting
   format found in the En route Supplement.
   5.25.2. Hazardous Laser Activity. Pilots will report any hazardous laser activity
   encounters IAW AIM 7-5-12 and AP/1. Laser encounters can be extremely perilous, see AFI
   11-301, Volume 4, Aircrew Laser Eye Protection, for specific aircrew actions and more
   information on protection from laser illumination.
   5.25.3. Pilot Reports (PIREPs). Pilots will immediately report hazardous weather
   conditions, volcanic activity, and large concentrations of birds or wildlife on or near the
   airport/airfield to the ARTCC, terminal ATC, or FSS. Additionally, pilots are urged to report
   any significant flight condition information. Pilots operating in warning areas should
   forward significant weather reports to the appropriate controlling agency (e.g., ARTCC,
   military radar unit, Airborne Warning and Control System, etc). In all cases, follow up with
   a report to a Pilot-to-Metro Service (PMSV) to ensure rapid dissemination to other using
   agencies. See PIREP procedures in the FIH.
5.26. Operations in the vicinity of hazards. Unless MAJCOM-approved, USAF aircraft will
not be operated in any forecast or actual severe condition (e.g. severe icing, turbulence, actual
Bird Watch Condition SEVERE, etc). See AFH 11-203 and AFI 91-202 for detailed information.
   5.26.1. Takeoff, Approach, and Landing. Pilots will not takeoff, land, or fly an approach
   at an airport where thunderstorms or other hazardous conditions are producing hail, strong
   winds, gust fronts, heavy rain, lightning, windshear, and (or) microbursts.
       5.26.1.1. Bird Watch Condition (BWC). In the absence of MAJCOM or MDS-specific
       BWC guidance, USAF pilots will comply with the following:
       5.26.1.2. BWC MODERATE: Operational commanders will consider restricting
       formation departures, approaches, and pattern work. To increase the chances of seeing
       and avoiding birds, PICs should avoid hard turns or excessive climb angles. During
       BWC Phase II periods, PICs will accomplish one approach to a full stop unless mission
48                                            AFI11-202V3_AFMCSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2011


     needs warrant additional approaches and sufficient fuel exists to divert if BWC changes
     to SEVERE.
     5.26.1.3. BWC SEVERE: PICs shall not conduct flight operations except in an
     emergency. Arriving aircraft will either hold awaiting a lower BWC, or will divert.
     Non-emergency landings in BWC SEVERE require risk acceptance approval by the
     operations group commander (or airbase wing commander if no OG/CC) responsible for
     the airfield’s flight operations.
     5.26.1.4. Civil or Foreign Fields. PICs will follow BWC MODERATE procedures if
     they receive a civilian ATC/ATIS hazard advisory to use caution for birds in the vicinity.
     5.26.1.5. PICs can expect NATO countries to comply with NATO STANAG 3879. Use
     this intensity conversion: 0-4: low, 5: medium, 6-8: severe. Risks warning updates for
     NW Europe can be obtained via: https://www.notams.jcs.mil/common/birdtam.html.
     5.26.1.6. (Added-AFMC) Supervisors will provide guidance on what techniques and
     procedures are used to fly in areas that have been forecasted or reported to have a bird
     advisory hazard of severe or greater. Some risk management tools that may be employed
     by aircrews include: Selecting another route during mission planning; planning an
     alternate mission if an alternate route shows the same threat; planning to enter the route
     during a period when the AHAS/BAM indicates a lower threat; changing the route or leg
     altitude to one less affected by the avian activity; planning to enter or exit at an alternate
     point if available; and avoiding flight near food sources (for example, water and
     landfills). As soon as practical, aircrews that encounter a bird hazard on low-level routes
     will broadcast (on the appropriate frequency) the location, altitude, and intensity of the
     hazard. Aircrews will also inform the supervisor of flying (SOF) or equivalent about bird
     hazards encountered as soon as practical.
  5.26.2. Thunderstorms. Pilots shall not intentionally operate into a thunderstorm except
  when operating on a MAJCOM-approved mission specifically requiring thunderstorm
  penetration. Damaging lightning strikes, electrostatic discharges and hail encounters can
  occur in apparently benign conditions. Pilots shall not fly in IMC in the vicinity of actual
  thunderstorms without operable radar, unless specifically approved by the MAJCOM.
  5.26.2. (AFMC) Missions requiring planned penetration of a thunderstorm require HQ
  AFMC/A3 approval.
  5.26.3. Flight Planned Route. When forecast, observed or reported hazardous weather
  activity (thunderstorm or other severe weather condition) affects the planned route, pilots
  will alter the route of flight to avoid the hazard, delay the scheduled mission or proceed to a
  suitable alternate. Pilots shall use all available information including ground and on-board
  radar, PMSV, and PIREPs to avoid hazardous or severe weather conditions.
  5.26.3. (AFMC) Thunderstorm avoidance procedures are listed in AFI 11-2FTV3.
  5.26.4. Wake Turbulence and Windshear. Pilots will:
     5.26.4.1. Report Wake Turbulence. Notify ATC when encountering wake turbulence.
     Pilots should observe wake turbulence avoidance criteria in AFMAN 11-217, Volume 3,
     Supplemental Flight Information, and FLIP.
AFI11-202V3_AFMCSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2011                                                            49


      5.26.4.2. Report Windshear. Immediately report a windshear or microburst encounter
      on takeoff, approach or landing to the most appropriate agency (e.g., control tower,
      approach control, PMSV) and if possible include: the altitude, loss or gain in airspeed or
      altitude, the type of aircraft and the location of occurrence (see AFH 11-203, Volume 1).
   5.26.5. Volcanic Activity. Unless conducting rescue operations or when authorized by the
   MAJCOM/A3, pilots of Air Force aircraft will not operate in an area of known or reported
   hazardous volcanic activity. MAJCOMS may issue MDS-specific guidance on ground and
   flight operations, including pilot actions for inadvertent ash encounters and ash avoidance
   criteria for areas of known or forecast hazardous volcanic ash concentrations. In the absence
   of MAJCOM guidance, pilots shall not plan to operate within 50 NM of any hazardous
   volcanic ash without MAJCOM/A3 approval. Consult an authorized weather source (see
   para. 2.6.) for current Volcanic Ash Advisory Center (VAAC) ash cloud information (or
   SIGMET). If unable to contact an authorized weather source, pilots will consider those areas
   identified on international VAAC depictions (or SIGMETs) as hazardous. In ground or flight
   operations, any encounters with volcanic ash should be reported as soon as possible to the
   appropriate controlling agency and aircraft maintenance authorities. In all cases, follow up
   with a report to a PMSV, or other applicable weather agency, to ensure rapid dissemination
   to other using agencies. See PIREP procedures in the FIH.
   5.26.6. Freezing Precipitation (Ice/Snow/Frost). Pilots will not takeoff with ice, snow,
   frost or other contamination adhering to the wings, control surfaces, propellers, engine inlets,
   or other critical surfaces of the aircraft, unless authorized by the program manager or flight
   manual.
      5.26.6.1. A thin coating of frost is permitted on the fuselage, provided the lettering
      and/or paint lines are visible.
      5.26.6.2. Light frost (up to 1/8 inch thick) caused by supercooled fuel is permitted on the
      lower wing surface (i.e., below the fuel tank area) if the fuselage and all other control
      surfaces are free of all icing. If deicing is required on any other aircraft surface, the
      underwing frost shall also be removed.
      5.26.6.3. Information on the removal and prevention of frozen precipitation is contained
      in AF T.O. 42C-1-2, Anti-Icing, De-Icing and Defrosting of Parked Aircraft available at
      https://www.toindex-s.wpafb.af.mil.
          5.26.6.3.1. Approved annual deicing/anti-icing holdover tables are available at the
          HQ AFFSA/A3OF website: https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/a3of.
5.27. Traffic Alerting and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS). Aircraft equipped with
TCAS shall operate in the TCAS mode that provides both Traffic Alerts (TAs) and Resolution
Advisories (RAs) unless the provisions of paragraph 5.27.2, MAJCOM guidance, mission
requirements or host nation agreements dictate otherwise.
   5.27.1. Response to TCAS Alerts. Pilots shall respond to all RAs as directed by the TCAS
   system unless doing so would jeopardize the safe operation of the aircraft (e.g., descent into
   obstacles).
      5.27.1.1. Pilots shall not deviate from an assigned ATC clearance based solely on TA
      information. Attempt to attain visual contact and maintain safe separation.
 50                                           AFI11-202V3_AFMCSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2011


       5.27.1.2. In the event of an RA, alter the flight path only to the extent necessary to
       comply with the RA.
       5.27.1.3. Pilots who deviate from an ATC clearance in response to an RA shall notify
       ATC of the deviation as soon as practical and promptly return to the current ATC
       clearance when the traffic conflict is resolved or obtain a new clearance.
       5.27.1.4. If a TCAS RA requires maneuvering contrary to ATC instructions, right-of-
       way rules, cloud clearance requirements, or other VFR/IFR flight rules, pilots are
       expected to follow the TCAS RA.
   5.27.2. Formation TCAS Operations.
       5.27.2.1. Formation leads (and last aircraft, when formation length exceeds 3 NMs) shall
       operate in TA mode unless otherwise required by ATC, host nation agreement or
       specified in the MDS specific guidance.
       5.27.2.2. During refueling operations the tanker aircraft will operate in TA mode.
   5.27.3. UAS TCAS Operations. RPAs equipped with TCAS shall only operate in TA
   Mode unless specifically authorized by competent authority.
5.28. Terrain Awareness and Warning Systems (TAWS). Pilots will comply with
appropriate flight manual procedures upon receipt of a Ground Proximity Warning System
(GPWS)/TAWS/Enhanced GPWS (EGPWS)/Ground Collision Avoidance System (GCAS)
warning. During day/VMC flight, terrain warnings need not be followed if the pilot can verify
the warning is false by visual contact with the terrain/obstacle.
   5.28.1. MAJCOMs will establish guidance on TAWS use during tactical operations.
   5.28.1. (AFMC) For operational, training and proficiency sorties, AFMC aircrew will
   follow basic and MDS specific guidance in AFI 11-2FTV3. Test sorties will follow specified
   guidance in an approved test plan, if different from AFI 11-2FTV3. In the event no guidance
   is published in AFI 11-2FTV3, refer to lead MAJCOM guidance if appropriate.
5.29. Navigation Procedures for Higher Latitudes. (See AFMAN 11-217, Volume 1)
5.29. (AFMC)Navigation Procedures for Higher Latitudes. AFMC aircraft capable of
displaying only magnetic heading will not operate north of 70 N latitude and south of 60 S
latitude.
   5.29.1. Aircraft capable of displaying only magnetic heading are prohibited from operating
   in designated Areas of Magnetic Unreliability (AMU). For areas north of 70 N and south of
   60 S that are not officially designated as AMUs, MAJCOMs will determine the highest
   allowable latitude for aircraft capable of displaying only magnetic heading.
       5.29.1.1. MAJCOMs must provide aircraft-specific operational approval prior to en route
       and terminal area operations using navigation aids oriented to true or grid.
       5.29.1.2. Outside of AMUs, aircraft unable to display true or grid heading may use
       navigation aids oriented to true or grid for en route navigation if allowed by MAJCOM.
   5.29.2. Unless otherwise restricted by aircraft flight manual or MAJCOM directives, USAF
   aircrews are authorized to fly true or grid approaches.
AFI11-202V3_AFMCSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2011                                                             51


       5.29.2.1. Except as noted in paragraph 5.29.2.2 aircraft must possess a true or grid
       heading source, and be able to display true or grid heading on appropriate navigation
       displays in order to fly terminal area true or grid instrument procedures in night or IMC.
       5.29.2.2. Aircraft without a true or grid heading source may fly true or grid RNAV
       (GPS) approaches and true or grid RNAV departure procedures at night or IMC provided
       the RNAV procedure includes all required magnetic course information.
5.30. UAS Abnormal Flight Operations. If ATC loses the RPA transponder signal or the
ability to determine the position or altitude of the RPA, the pilot will declare an emergency,
attempt to transmit IFF code 7700 (or 7600, if appropriate), terminate the mission, and proceed
to either home station or the nearest suitable DoD-controlled airspace/airfield for landing. The
pilot will state intentions to ATC and also provide ATC with position reports when requested for
tracking.
   5.30.1. In the event of a divert, the pilot will coordinate a route of flight and new clearance
   with ATC that minimizes any hazard to other air traffic and persons on the ground.
5.31. UAS Lost-Link Procedures. Upon confirmation of a sustained loss of command link, the
PIC will accomplish appropriate lost link procedures and notify ATC with the following
information: time of lost link, last known position, altitude, and programmed lost link routing.
The PIC shall confirm execution of appropriate lost link procedures with ATC or other means, if
practical.
   5.31.1. The PIC will ensure the RPA is programmed to follow a predictable route and
   altitude plan if it loses link. If practical, lost link routing will be programmed to maintain
   either the RPA’s last assigned clearance or include a delay to enable coordination with ATC
   prior to aircraft departing its approved working area. The PIC shall attempt to regain
   command link and will notify ATC of anticipated aircraft maneuvers. Lost link routing shall
   be planned to ensure that the aircraft has sufficient obstacle clearance and does not penetrate
   unauthorized airspace.
   5.31.2. Lost link routing will terminate in an area that provides the best chance to regain link
   or at a landing/recovery airfield. If unable to reestablish link, and in absence of MAJCOM-
   specific guidance, the PIC will inform ATC of the intended flight termination plan.

                       AIRCREW FLIGHT EQUIPMENT SYSTEMS

6.1. General Information. This chapter provides basic flight equipment guidance for aircrew.
   6.1.1. Indoctrination Course for Nonrated Flyers. Flying unit commanders must ensure
   nonrated personnel and civilians who perform in-flight duties receive an indoctrination
   course on MDS-specific: missions, emergency procedures, use of flight equipment and
   egress. A preflight briefing does not qualify as an indoctrination course.
   6.1.2. Passenger Briefing. The PIC will ensure each passenger is briefed before flight.
   Minimum briefing items must include: emergency signals and required emergency actions;
   the location and use of emergency exits; wear and use of parachutes; use of oxygen and other
   associated survival equipment.
6.2. Aircrew Flight and Survival Equipment. Each crewmember shall wear and use survival
and aircrew flight clothing and equipment IAW AFI 11-301 Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE)
Program, AFI 16-1301, Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape (SERE) Program, MAJCOM
guidance, SPINS and the aircraft T.O.
6.3. Spectacles, Sunglasses, Contact Lenses, Laser Eye Protection, and NVDs.
   6.3.1. Spectacles. Crewmembers who wear corrective spectacles while performing aircrew
   duties must use only Air Force-provided spectacles and sunglasses. Crewmembers must
   carry a spare set of clear prescription spectacles while performing aircrew duties.
   6.3.2. Sunglasses. All crewmembers of USAF aircraft shall wear only Air Force-provided
   sunglasses, based on the Aircrew Flight Frame (AFF), while performing in-flight aircrew
   duty. Individuals are authorized two pair every two years, obtained through individual
   equipment supply processes.
   6.3.3. Contact Lenses. Crewmembers who desire contact lenses must consult with the
   flight surgeon, meet criteria and follow guidelines outlined in AFI 48-123. While performing
   aircrew duty, comply with paragraph 6.3.1.
   6.3.4. Laser Eye Protection. MAJCOMs that permit aircrew laser eye protection will
   publish specific guidance on training and use prior to in-flight wear. Aircrew will follow
   AFI 11-301, Volume 4, or MAJCOM guidance, during and after hazardous laser encounters.
   6.3.4. (AFMC) Units will develop a training program tailored to the specific laser eye
   protection that will be used and submit to AFMC/A3V for approval. Document training with
   a memorandum for record in Section V of the individual’s aircrew training folder.
   6.3.5. NVDs. Crewmembers must undergo a MAJCOM-approved initial certification course
   IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 1, Aircrew Training, prior to their initial flight with NVDs. If
   wearing corrective lenses, clear AFF protective lenses, or laser eye protection with NVDs,
   conduct pre-flight adjustments wearing both.
6.4. Oxygen Requirements. (N/A for UAS ground control stations) The PIC shall ensure
sufficient oxygen for the planned mission (including contingencies) is available to all occupants
AFI11-202V3_AFMCSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2011                                                          53


before takeoff. Normally, aircrew will use supplemental oxygen anytime the cabin altitude
exceeds 10,000 ft MSL.
   6.4.1. Unpressurized Operations. When mission essential, aircrew trained IAW AFI 11-
   403, Aerospace Physiological Training Program, may operate aircraft unpressurized above
   10,000 ft. MSL without supplemental oxygen IAW MAJCOM guidance and the following
   restrictions:
      6.4.1.1. Total flight time (without supplemental oxygen) above 10,000 ft. MSL shall not
      exceed 1 hour if any portion of the flight above 10,000 ft. MSL is in IMC, at night, or
      when using NVGs, employing weapons, conducting airdrop or air-refueling, or
      performing high-g maneuvers.
      6.4.1.2. Maximum of 30 minutes (without supplemental oxygen) between 12,500 and
      14,000 ft. MSL.
      6.4.1.3. Supplemental oxygen must be used by all persons while above 14,000 ft. MSL.
      6.4.1.4. Any occupant, not trained IAW AFI 11-403, limits the cabin altitude to:
          6.4.1.4.1. 10,000 ft. to 13,000 ft. MSL for three hours without supplemental oxygen.
          6.4.1.4.2. 13,000 ft. MSL without supplemental oxygen.
      6.4.1.5. FL 250 shall not be exceeded even if occupants have oxygen (see paragraph 6.5)
   6.4.2. Pressurized Operations. Pilots flying pressurized aircraft maintaining a cabin
   altitude below 10,000 ft. will comply with Table 6.2. Each crewmember shall use
   supplemental oxygen anytime the cabin altitude exceeds 10,000 ft MSL.
   6.4.3. Procedures for Loss of Cabin Pressure. Initiate an immediate descent to the lowest
   practical altitude, preferably below 18,000 ft. MSL, but do not allow cabin altitude to remain
   above FL 250 unless occupants are wearing functional pressure suits. If any occupant lacks
   functioning oxygen equipment, descend to an altitude of 13,000 ft MSL or less (terrain
   permitting) and comply with paragraph 6.4.1.
      6.4.3.1. If cabin altitude exceeds 18,000 ft MSL following the unintended loss of cabin
      pressure, aircrew and passengers must be evaluated by a flight surgeon or other
      competent aviation medical authority prior to further flight. If cabin altitude cannot be
      determined, use the aircraft altitude at the time of the event. Report a loss of cabin
      pressurization IAW AFMAN 91-223.
   6.4.4. Decompression Sickness (DCS). If any occupant exhibits DCS symptoms, the pilot
   must descend as soon as practical and land at the nearest suitable installation where medical
   assistance can be obtained. Individuals suspected of DCS should be administered and remain
   on 100 percent oxygen (using tight-fitting mask or equivalent) until evaluated by competent
   aviation medical authority. Decompression sickness may occur up to 12 hours after landing.
   Aircrew will not fly after a DCS event without specific authorization from a flight surgeon or
   designated civil aviation medical examiner.
   6.4.5. Hypoxia. Should anyone on the aircraft experience hypoxia symptoms, the pilot will
   immediately descend to the lowest practical altitude and land at a suitable location to obtain
   medical assistance. Aircrew will not fly after a hypoxia event without specific authorization
   from a flight surgeon or designated civil aviation medical examiner.

6.5. High Altitude Operations. Without a functional pressure suit, the pilot shall maintain a
cabin altitude below FL 250 and adhere to the time limits in Table 6.1. For high-altitude airdrop
missions, use the oxygen requirements in AFI 11-409, High Altitude Mission Support
Procedures. If the aircraft lands between missions, and the time on the ground equals or exceeds
the time spent at or above a cabin altitude of FL 210, the time of allowable duration can be reset
to the maximum.

                                           Chapter 7

                              VISUAL FLIGHT RULES (VFR)

7.1. General Information. PICs may fly USAF aircraft under VFR when required for mission
accomplishment. Mission examples include: operational necessity, host nation requirements,
training, proficiency or evaluation sorties, aircraft equipment that precludes IFR flight; and ATC
or NAVAID gaps that preclude IFR flight. Unless specifically authorized by the MAJCOM/A3,
USAF fixed-wing multi-engine aircraft will not depart VFR without ensuring they can vertically
clear published IFR departure procedure restrictions along the planned departure route with one
engine inoperative. Comply with AFMAN 11-217, Volume 2, and the following:
   7.1.1. The PIC will utilize radar advisory, monitoring or control services when practical, and
   should ensure flight following by any available means (i.e. FSS or C2 agency).
   7.1.2. The PIC will conduct planning, at a minimum, IAW paragraph 2.1., as appropriate to
   the area of operations, to ensure VFR operations are authorized and properly planned.
   7.1.3. When conditions (e.g. weather, airspace, etc.) prevent continued flight under VFR, the
   PIC will alter the route and continue operations under VFR until: the destination, obtaining
   an IFR clearance or until landing at a suitable location.
   7.1.4. PICs conducting tactical operations should fly under VFR unless compliance degrades
   mission accomplishment.
   7.1.5. RPA pilots must comply with provisions of JO 7610.4 when operating under VFR.
   7.1.6. (Added-AFMC) VFR departures are authorized under the following conditions:
       7.1.6.1. (Added-AFMC) There is no authorized IFR departure procedure for the airport
       7.1.6.2. (Added-AFMC) When the aircraft is unable to depart using one of the IFR
       departure methods contained in AFI 11-217 or AFI 11-202 V3
       7.1.6.3. (Added-AFMC) When the sortie is planned as a VFR flight
   7.1.7. (Added-AFMC) Aircrew departing VFR along an IFR departure path will ensure
   they can meet applicable obstacle climb gradients, with all engines operating, to the
   appropriate VFR cruise altitude or minimum IFR altitude. Additionally, aircrew departing
   VFR are authorized to reduce applicable IFR climb gradients by up to 48'/NM for one engine
   inoperative performance planning. Note: This is applicable to obstacle climb gradients, not
   ATC climb gradients. If unable to determine whether a given climb gradient is obstacle or
   ATC, assume it is an obstacle climb gradient.
   7.1.8. (Added-AFMC) Aircrew departing VFR along an IFR departure path that cannot
   meet the applicable obstacle climb gradients require detailed planning to ensure obstacles and
   terrain are avoided. Operations IAW this guidance and authorization are to be used as a last
   resort when the mission justifies the increased risk and require OG/CC approval. Aircrews
   are authorized to depart VFR without meeting IFR departure procedure restrictions along the
   planned departure route with one engine inoperative while complying with the following
   guidance:
AFI11-202V3_AFMCSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2011                                                          57


       7.1.8.1. (Added-AFMC) Use radar advisory, monitoring, or control services when
       practical, and ensure flight following by any available means.
       7.1.8.2. (Added-AFMC) Consider reducing weight and/or delaying the mission until
       environmental conditions improve.
       7.1.8.3. (Added-AFMC) Crews must be knowledgeable of and comply with guidance
       in AFMAN 11-217 V2.
       7.1.8.4. (Added-AFMC) Crews are responsible for terrain and obstacle
       planning/avoidance and must climb to the minimum IFR or VFR cruise altitude as soon
       as practical.
       7.1.8.5. (Added-AFMC) Crews will use all available resources to mitigate risk. This
       includes but is not limited to supervisors, ORM, flight manual guidance, and aircraft
       commander discretion.
   7.1.9. (Added-AFMC) VFR departures not following an IFR departure path also require
   detailed planning to ensure obstacles and terrain are avoided. The PIC is ultimately
   responsible for ensuring aircraft performance and weather conditions allow for obstacle
   clearance along the planned departure (and emergency return) path with one engine
   inoperative.
7.2. Weather Requirements for Filing VFR. The forecast weather for the departure, planned
route of flight and arrival ( 1 hour of the Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA)) must comply with
the minima in Table 7.1. or 7.2. If transitioning to IFR, the pilot shall maintain appropriate
visibility and cloud clearance requirements to a minimum IFR altitude and until receipt of the
IFR clearance. If transitioning from IFR to VFR, the PIC must maintain the appropriate
visibility and cloud clearances as soon as the IFR cancellation is acknowledged by ATC.
   7.2.1. The forecast for helicopters must comply with Table 7.1. or Table 7.2.
   7.2.2. The forecast for fixed-wing must be equal to or greater than l,500 ft. ceiling and 3
   SMs visibility.
7.3. Flight Operations under VFR. PICs shall adhere to the weather minimums listed in Table
7.1. when in FAA airspace. When outside FAA airspace, PICs shall comply with guidance in
FLIP, FCG or the ICAO VFR weather minimums in Table 7.2. PICs of VFR aircraft must at all
times be able to control the aircraft by visual reference to a discernible horizon, regardless of
cloud clearance requirements.
   7.3.1. Cold Weather Operations. USAF pilots shall apply altimeter corrections to en route
   and terrain clearance altitudes, especially when operating VFR at night. See Chapter 8.
7.4. Special VFR (SVFR). USAF fixed-wing aircraft shall not fly under SVFR. MAJCOMs
may allow helicopter aircrews to fly under SVFR IAW 14 CFR §91.157 in FAA airspace, or
appropriate host-nation guidance. Helicopter PIC’s may request SVFR clearances at airports
with the designation ―NO SVFR‖ in the Airport Facilities Directory or on the sectional chart.
7.4. (AFMC)Special VFR (SVFR). Helicopter aircrews, including tilt-rotor when operating in
helicopter mode, are authorized to fly under SVFR in FAA airspace or IAW appropriate host-
nation guidance.

7.5. VFR Over-the-Top. PICs operating VFR above a ceiling shall comply with AFMAN 11-
217V2. See also paragraph 8.18 for VFR-on-Top.

                                           Chapter 8

                           INSTRUMENT FLIGHT RULES (IFR)

8.1. IFR Requirements. PICs will fly USAF fixed-wing aircraft under IFR to the maximum
extent possible without unacceptable mission degradation. Pilots shall fly under IFR if:
   8.1.1. Weather conditions do not permit flight according to VFR.
   8.1.2. Airspace rules require IFR flight (e.g. Class A airspace).
   8.1.3. Operating in excess of 180 KTAS within (not simply crossing) federal airways.
   8.1.4. Operating fixed-wing aircraft at night, unless the mission cannot be flown under IFR.
   8.1.5. (Added-AFMC) Military Authority Assumes Responsibility for Separation of
   Aircraft (MARSA). The unit OG/CC is authorized to develop agreements for special IFR
   operations according to the MARSA concept. See FAA Order JO 7610.4, Special Military
   Operations, and FLIP for further guidance.
8.2. Practice Instrument Approaches Under VFR. MAJCOM approval is required to practice
instrument approaches under VFR. The following restrictions apply:
8.2. (AFMC)Practice Instrument Approaches Under VFR. AFMC crews are authorized to
conduct practice instrument approaches under VFR in accordance with the guidance listed.
   8.2.1. Maintain VFR cloud clearances and visibilities IAW Chapter 7.
   8.2.2. Terminal radar service shall be used when available.
   8.2.3. Aircrews must make all position reports IAW AFMAN 11-217, Volume 2.
   8.2.4. Pilots must request ATC authorization to fly the published missed approach.
8.3. ATC Clearance. Pilots must obtain an ATC clearance before commencing any IFR flight
that originates in or penetrates controlled airspace.
8.4. Published Instrument Procedure. A ―published‖ procedure is defined as:
   8.4.1. An instrument procedure charted in US government FLIP by the DoD/National
   Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) or FAA/National Aeronautical Charting Office
   (NACO). USAF aircrews will use NGA or NACO products when available.
   8.4.2. A procedure developed IAW AFI 11-230, Instrument Procedures.
   8.4.3. Radar procedure with minimums published graphically or in FLIP Radar Instrument
   Approach Minimums section.
   8.4.4. A host nation or commercially produced procedure which is approved by the
   MAJCOM per paragraph 8.4.5.
   8.4.5. Non-US Government and Foreign Terminal Instrument Procedures
   (FTIP). USAF aircrews will not fly a non-US Government (USG) published instrument
   procedure (includes commercially-produced procedures like Jeppesen or Lido) that has not
   been reviewed to ensure conformance with accepted standards by the appropriate Terminal
   Instrument Procedures (TERPS) office. This validation must be a current TERPS review
AFI11-202V3_AFMCSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2011                                                         61


   letter (attached to the procedure or as published in the ASRR’s ―Giant Report‖) that informs
   the pilot of items that do not comply with US TERPS, ICAO PANS-OPS or NATO criteria
   (e.g. recognized obstruction clearance, weather/visibility minima, etc.). MAJCOMs shall
   establish a process to ensure initial (or update) review requests of non-USG or FTIPs are
   provided to the appropriate TERPS office 7 days prior to use.
   8.4.5. (AFMC) Approval of Non-DoD/NIMA and Local Use Procedures. Instrument
   procedures not published in either DoD or NGA FLIP require a formal TERPS review,
   followed by AFMC/A3 approval. The single point of contact for all requests is the AFMC
   TERPS office (HQ AFMC/A3O, DSN 986-0061/0123 commercial (937) 656-0060, fax 674-
   2620 commercial (937) 904-2620). Submit requirements directly to the TERPS office (HQ
   AFMC/A3O) immediately upon mission notification. Minimum 15 days advance notice is
   desired. Instrument procedures are approved for specific missions, not blanket use. PICs will
   comply with restrictions and recommendations contained in the TERPS evaluation.
   Approval request must include airfield name/ICAO, desired procedure(s), copy of approach
   plate (or Jeppesen page number), mission date, POC and phone number.
       8.4.5.1. Prior to use, pilots shall ensure the TERPS review is current. FTIPs
       (government or commercially produced), reviewed by one TERPS office, may be flown
       by aircrews from any other MAJCOM unless precluded by their own MAJCOM.
       8.4.5.2. MAJCOMs must ensure crews receive adequate training prior to the initial use
       of any non-USG instrument procedure. At a minimum, this training should include the
       differences in symbology, language or translation, weather minimums, host nation
       NOTAM retrieval, equipment and airspace requirements.
       8.4.5.3. Waiver of TERPS Review. During non-standard operations (defined as an
       urgent requirement to fly short-notice: humanitarian, contingency, medical evacuation,
       ―Special‖ Access and vital State Department missions), the TERPS review may be
       waived by the applicable MAJCOM/A3 (if an O-8 or above). The MAJCOM/A3 may
       also waive the TERPS review for non-USG procedures, for which the exact same USG
       procedure exists. If the A3’s grade is below O-8, then waiver authority will lie with the
       first O-8 in the MAJCOM’s operational chain of command. This waiver authority will
       not be further delegated. If this waiver authority is exercised, MAJCOMs will ensure the
       aircrew and the applicable TERPS office are aware that the provisions of paragraph 8.4.5.
       have been waived.
8.5. Destination Requirements for Filing Purposes. See Attachment 2 for a decision tree.
   8.5.1. Destination with a Published Approach Procedure. Pilots may file IFR to a
   destination with a published instrument approach capable of being flown with navigational
   equipment aboard the aircraft.
   8.5.2. Destination Without a Published Instrument Approach Procedure. If there is no
   compatible published approach at the destination, pilots may file a composite IFR/VFR flight
   plan to:
       8.5.2.1. A point en route where forecast weather at ETA (+ 1 hour) allows continued
       flight to the destination under VFR.

      8.5.2.2. A point served by a published approach procedure where forecast weather at
      ETA (+ 1 hour) allows the pilot to descend to VFR conditions and continue to the
      destination under VFR.
8.6. IFR Filing Weather Requirements. The following are the weather requirements for filing
to a destination:
   8.6.1. Temporary (TEMPO) Conditions. Pilots may file to a destination with a forecast
   that includes temporary (TEMPO) changes in ceiling and/or visibility lower than prescribed
   in 8.7.1., but an alternate may be required.
   8.6.2. UAS Weather Requirements. MAJCOMs may determine UAS weather limit
   requirements based on airspace rules, aircraft equipage, level of autonomy and crew
   qualifications/capabilities. In the absence MAJCOM guidance, UAS will follow weather
   requirements as published in this section.
   8.6.2. (AFMC) Refer to AFI 11-2FTV3 for specific UAS weather requirements.
   8.6.3. Fixed-Wing Aircraft. Weather for the ETA (±1 hour) at destination or recovery base
   must be at or above the lowest compatible published landing minimums for the aircraft
   concerned.
      8.6.3.1. MAJCOMs may waive this requirement when operational necessity dictates the
      use of a destination forecast to be below minimums, but MAJCOMs must establish
      alternate recovery procedures, such as the use of two or more alternate airports,
      additional holding fuel, etc.
      8.6.3.2. For a straight-in or sidestep approach, the forecast weather must meet only the
      published visibility requirements for that approach.
      8.6.3.3. For a circling approach, the forecast weather must meet both the ceiling and
      prevailing visibility requirements.
   8.6.4. Helicopters. PICs may use Category A minima, regardless of approach speed. PICs
   should fly a constant airspeed to comply with the stabilized approach concept. PICs may
   reduce the Category A visibility minima on Category I procedures by one-half, but no lower
   than 1/4 SM prevailing visibility (PV) or 1,200 feet runway visual range (RVR). PICs may
   not reduce the visibility minima on Copter procedures, Category II procedures or if
   ―Visibility Reduction by Helicopters NA‖ is annotated on the procedure. PICs will apply
   any inoperative approach lighting visibility correction before reducing minima. PICs will
   apply airspeed limitations IAW Table 8.1. For more information, see Chapter 7 in FAA-H-
   8261-1A,         ―Instrument        Procedures         Handbook,         available      at:

8.7. Required IFR Alternate. This section prescribes when an IFR alternate must be filed.
MAJCOMs will determine alternate airfield policies for UAS.
8.7. (AFMC)Required IFR Alternate. AFMC UAS alternate airfield policy will be IAW
Fixed-Wing Aircraft policy below.
   8.7.1. Weather. An alternate is required when the worst weather (TEMPO or prevailing) at
   the ETA (±1 hour) for the first point of intended landing (or each point of intended landing
   on a stopover flight plan) does not permit a VFR descent from the MIA and is less than:
      8.7.1.1. Fixed-Wing Aircraft: A ceiling of 2,000 ft. and a visibility of 3 SMs.
          8.7.1.1.1. Exception: MAJCOMs may lower this requirement to a ceiling of 1,000 ft.
          and a visibility of 2 SMs, if two or more suitable independent precision approaches
          are available and operable for the airport of intended landing at ETA (±1 hour).
      8.7.1.2. Helicopters. A ceiling of 1,000 ft. (or 400 ft. above the lowest compatible
      approach minimums, whichever is higher) and a visibility of 2 SM.
   8.7.2. Additional Conditions Requiring an Alternate. Unless forecast weather for the
   ETA (±1 hour) at the destination (or a point en route) exceeds the requirements of 8.7.1. and
 64                                             AFI11-202V3_AFMCSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2011


   permits a VFR descent from the Minimum IFR Altitude (MIA) to a VFR approach and
   landing, pilots must designate an alternate airport on all IFR flight plans when filing to a
   destination:
       8.7.2.1. Where all compatible approaches require radar.
       8.7.2.2. Where required NAVAIDs are unmonitored.
       8.7.2.3. When the destination has no weather reporting capability.
       8.7.2.4. When the point of intended landing’s lowest compatible approach weather
       minimums are greater than or equal to a 1,500 ft. ceiling or 3 SM visibility.
   8.7.3. Exception for Remote or Island Destinations. MAJCOMs may authorize holding
   for a specified time in lieu of an alternate for those remote or island destinations for which
   designating an alternate is not possible. MAJCOMs that authorize holding at a remote or
   island destination will prescribe weather criteria and recovery procedures.
   8.7.3. (AFMC) A remote or island destination is defined as any aerodrome, which, due to
   its unique geographic location, offers no suitable alternate (civil or military) within 2 hours
   flying time. Aircraft may hold at a remote or island destination, instead of designating an
   alternate airport, if all of the following conditions are met. There must be enough fuel on
   board, in addition to required reserves, to hold for at least 1 hour after arriving at the initial
   approach fix. From 1 hour before until 2 hours after estimated time of arrival, the worst
   weather is forecast to be at or above that required for an airport to qualify as an alternate. The
   forecast crosswind component corrected for runway condition reading (RCR) is within the
   recommended zone of the aircraft’s landing crosswind chart.
8.8. Selecting an Alternate. Except for TEMPO conditions for thunderstorms and snow/rain
showers, the worst forecasted prevailing weather conditions for an alternate airport (ETA ±1
hour) must meet or exceed:
   8.8.1. Alternate with a Compatible Published Instrument Approach Procedure:
       8.8.1.1. Fixed-Wing Aircraft. A ceiling of at least 500 ft. above the lowest compatible
       approach minima and a visibility of at least 2 SM or published visibility minima
       whichever is greater.
       8.8.1.2. Helicopters. A ceiling of at least 200 ft. above, and a visibility of at least 1 SM
       above, the lowest compatible published landing minimum.
   8.8.2. Alternate without a Published or Compatible Instrument Approach
   Procedure. Forecast weather for the ETA (±1 hour) must permit a VFR descent from the
   MIA to a VFR approach and landing, or, if the mission justifies the increased risk, under
   specific conditions, an otherwise unqualified airfield may be designated as an alternate by the
   MAJCOM/A3. MAJCOMs establish UAS alternate airfield policies.
       8.8.2.1. (Added-AFMC) Holding (instead of an alternate airport) is authorized for UAS
       operations. Fuel and weather requirements are the same as paragraph 8.7.3.
8.9. Airports That Do Not Qualify as Alternates. Except IAW paragraph 8.8.2, airports do
not qualify as alternates if:
   8.9.1. All compatible approaches require radar.
AFI11-202V3_AFMCSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2011                                                            65


   8.9.2. GPS is the only available NAVAID.
   8.9.3. The FLIP designation ―   A   NA‖ is displayed on all compatible approach plates.
   8.9.4. The FLIP A designation (without NA) is displayed on all compatible approach plates
   and an associated note applies. The A signifies that non-standard alternate minimums are
   published for that runway. While non-standard alternate minimums do not apply to USAF
   aircraft, there may be notes associated with the non-standard alternate minimums that do.
   Pilots must check for such notes whenever the A designation is shown on an IAP.
8.10. RVR Use, Applicability and Conversion. RVR reports, when given for a particular
runway, apply to all takeoffs, landings, and approaches to that runway, and always take
precedence over any other visibility report for that runway. RVR is normally reported in feet or
meters. Pilots will use the static RVR when available (regardless of reported variability). If only
a variable report is received and a static RVR cannot be determined, pilots will apply the lowest
reported RVR value. If necessary, pilots may convert the reported visibility from one format to
another (e.g. RVR to PV) only for takeoffs and straight-in approaches using the conversion
tables printed in the front of the Terminal Procedures Publication (TPP) booklet. For
conversions, use the higher of: the next higher value in the conversion chart, or the highest
published value from the IAP minima block; do not interpolate.
8.11. Minimum Takeoff Weather. Pilots shall not takeoff when existing weather is below the
landing minimums for their aircraft, unless specifically authorized by the MAJCOM, but in no
case less than 600 RVR (200 meters).
8.11. (AFMC)Minimum Takeoff Weather. Minimum Takeoff Weather. Command takeoff
alternate requirements for tanker/transport/bomber aircraft are listed in table 8.1. For
fighter/trainer/UAS aircraft, the OG/CC may authorize takeoff for operational requirements
when existing weather is below landing minimums if the visibility is at least 1,600 feet runway
visual range (RVR) or 1/4-mile and a suitable alternate is located within 30 minutes flying time.
The reported and forecast weather at the alternate must meet that required for an airport to
qualify as an alternate, and the forecast crosswind component corrected for RCR must be within
the recommended zone of the aircraft’s landing crosswind chart.

Table 8.1. (AFMC) Departure Minimums and Alternate Requirements for
Tanker/Transport/Bomber Aircraft.
If departure weather is:                                     A departure alternate is:
At or above authorized ceiling and visibility landing        Not required.
minimums.
Below either authorized ceiling or visibility minimums but
RVR is 1600 or greater (visibility ¼ mile or greater)        Required.
 -OR-                                                        (See Notes 1 and 2)
Below either authorized ceiling or visibility minimums but
RVR is 1200 or greater at the approach end and 1000 or
greater at the departure end and runway centerline lights
operational. (See Note 3)
NOTE 1: Alternate must be located within 30 minutes flight time with weather reported and
forecast at or above approach minimums or 200- ½ (RVR 2400), whichever is higher, for 1 hour
after takeoff.
 66                                           AFI11-202V3_AFMCSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2011


-OR-
Alternate must be located within 2 hours flight time with weather forecast to be at least 500-1
above approach minimums but no lower than 700-2 for a precision approach or 800-2 for a non-
precision approach for ETA at the alternate +/– one hour.
NOTE 2: Aircraft must be able to maintain minimum enroute altitude to the alternate if an
engine fails.
NOTE 3: Must have centerline lighting and dual RVR display slave readouts for both approach
and departure ends of the runway. For runways with triple RVR readouts, the pilot may use any
two consecutive readouts to determine if the runway is usable for departure (aircraft performance
permitting). For example, approach end RVR=800, midfield RVR=1700, departure end
RVR=1000. If aircraft performance and runway length will permit taking off at midfield, this
runway is usable for takeoff.
   8.11.1. RVR Requirements. (N/A for Helicopter) Minima below 1600 RVR are not
   authorized unless the runways are equipped with centerline lights, visible runway centerline
   markings, and two operative transmissometers. All reported RVR readings must meet or
   exceed minimum authorized values.
   8.11.2. MAJCOMs that permit takeoffs when weather is lower than the published landing
   minimums shall prescribe alternative takeoff minima and substitute recovery procedures.
   8.11.3. Civil contract carriers may operate from airports under USAF jurisdiction using the
   takeoff minimums approved by the FAA and published in the air carrier's operations
   specifications.
8.12. IFR Departures. Pilots of USAF aircraft must adhere to IFR departure procedures
guidance in this section and in AFMAN 11-217, Volume 1.
   8.12.1. MAJCOM Responsibility. Normally, MAJCOMs or COMAFFORs will ensure
   aircraft are tasked to takeoff at a weight that allows the PIC to comply with paragraph
   8.12.11.
   8.12.2. PIC Responsibility. The PIC will ensure the planned departure method, climb
   gradient, low close-in obstacles, route and emergency procedures are briefed to the crew
   prior to takeoff. See Attachment 3 for a decision tree.
   8.12.3. Authorized IFR Departure Methods. Obstacle Departure Procedures (ODP) and
   Standard Instrument Departures (SID) should be flown to the maximum extent possible.
   USAF aircraft will depart IFR using only these methods:
       8.12.3.1. Published ODP; textual or graphic, including Reduced Takeoff Runway Length
       (RTRL) and Visual Climb Over the Airport (VCOA) procedures. VCOA procedures may
       also be termed VCID (Visual Climb to Instrument Departure).
       8.12.3.2. SID.
       8.12.3.3. Specific ATC Departure Instructions.
       8.12.3.4. Diverse Departures (Omni-directional Departures-ICAO).
       8.12.3.5. Special MAJCOM Certification (authorized locations, pilots and aircraft only).
       See paragraph 8.12.9.
AFI11-202V3_AFMCSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2011                                                           67


  8.12.4. Obstacle Departure Procedures. Pilots will fly the published ODP               for the
  runway used. If issued other departure instructions, pilots should request clearance to fly the
  ODP or comply with 8.12.6.
     8.12.4.1. Visual Climb Over Airport. Pilots will not fly any VCOA procedure until
     completion of MAJCOM-specified training. The weather must be at or above the
     minimums published for the VCOA. Unless published, pilots will consider the VCOA’s
     visibility requirement as a ―remain within‖ distance, and will not exceed this radius from
     the center of the airfield while climbing to the specified altitude. Pilots will notify ATC
     (or other traffic) when planning to depart via the VCOA. Pilots without NVDs will not
     fly a VCOA at night, unless specifically authorized by the MAJCOM.
     8.12.4.1. (AFMC) Visual Climb Over Airport is not authorized in AFMC.
     8.12.4.2. Reduced Takeoff Runway Length ODP. Pilots using a published RTRL
     procedure shall ensure their aircraft can attain a safe liftoff speed and rotate prior to the
     distance remaining specified in the procedure. MAJCOMS should establish ad hoc
     RTRL request procedures for their aircrews. Ad hoc RTRL procedures will be
     considered a published ODP.
     8.12.4.2. (AFMC) Units requesting the use of a Reduced Takeoff Runway Length ODP
     will submit request via a Form 73 to AFMC/A3V.
     8.12.4.3. Sector Departure ODP. Pilots may fly ―sector‖ diverse departures as
     published.
  8.12.5. Standard Instrument Departures. PICs will comply with the routing, altitudes,
  and climb gradient (including notes) published on the SID (or in the , if not published on
  the SID). If the aircraft cannot comply with an ATC minimum climb gradient, coordinate
  with ATC prior to flying the procedure or obtain an amended clearance. The term SID
  includes other approved published instrument departure procedures (DP).
  8.12.6. Specific ATC Departure Instructions. ATC instructions refer to specific
  navigational guidance (e.g. heading, routing, altitude) issued with the clearance or by tower.
  Outside the NAS, in a non-radar environment, to be considered a valid instrument departure,
  the instructions must be issued with either a minimum climb gradient or confirmation that the
  climb gradient does not exceed 200 feet/NM. Unless issued with a minimum climb gradient,
  the instructions may not provide obstacle clearance below a minimum IFR altitude.
  Therefore, in all cases:
     8.12.6.1. If the departure runway has any published climb gradients, the PIC must meet
     or exceed the highest gradient when departing via ATC instructions.
     8.12.6.2. If unable to meet any ATC climb gradient, coordinate with ATC prior to flying
     the procedure.
     8.12.6.3. Pilots are never relieved of the responsibility for terrain and obstacle avoidance.
     The radio call ―Radar Contact‖ only means the aircraft has been identified on radar.
     Responsibility is shared between pilot and controller only after navigational guidance is
     issued.
     8.12.6.4. Outside the NAS, use caution when flying radar vectors. See paragraph 8.13.2.
68                                          AFI11-202V3_AFMCSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2011


  8.12.7. Diverse Departures (Omni-directional Departure). Pilots will track runway
  centerline to 400 feet above the DER before turning on course. PICs must ensure their
  aircraft will vertically clear applicable low close-in obstacles published in NOTAMs or the
  Takeoff Minima and Departure Procedures (              ) before turning on course. Diverse
  departures are not authorized when an obstacle departure procedure, climb gradient or non-
  standard takeoff weather minima are published for that runway. ―Sector‖ diverse departures
  are authorized.
  8.12.8. Special MAJCOM Certification. MAJCOMs may develop departure procedures
  for their aircraft at specific locations that allow safe aircraft departure. Pilots must meet
  MAJCOM-specified training or certification requirements before these procedures may be
  flown. Once developed, these departure procedures will be sent to HQ AFFSA/A3O for
  review and inclusion in the ASRR or other appropriate location.
  8.12.8. (AFMC) Units wishing to receive special MAJCOM certification for procedures at
  airfields for which only non-standard takeoff weather minimums are published must
  coordinate through AFMC/A3V via an AFMC Form 73.
  8.12.9. No Authorized IFR Departure Method. If the airport does not have one of the IFR
  departure methods described above, then an IFR departure is not authorized. Refer to
  Chapter 7.
  8.12.10. Required Climb Gradients. Regardless of the IFR departure method selected,
  PICs will climb at a minimum of 200 ft/NM unless a higher gradient is published for the
  departure runway (in a departure procedure or ). For specific ATC departure instruction
  climb gradients, see paragraph 8.12.6. When no departure procedure is published and a
  diverse departure is not authorized, coordination with MAJCOM TERPS specialists is
  required to determine the best departure method and required climb gradient prior to an IFR
  departure.
     8.12.10.1. Low Close-in Obstacles. In addition to complying with the published climb
     gradient, the PIC must also ensure that the aircraft can always vertically clear applicable
     published low close-in obstacles.
     8.12.10.2. Non-Standard Takeoff Minimums. Pilots will not depart an airfield using
     non-standard takeoff minimums in lieu of meeting the required climb gradient. When
     non-standard takeoff minima are published, with or without a climb gradient, the PIC
     may not take-off under the provisions of IFR established in paragraph 8.11. unless:
         8.12.10.2.1. The departure procedure authorizes ―standard‖ takeoff minimums with a
         climb gradient in lieu of the non-standard criteria and the requirements of paragraph
         8.12.10.4 or 8.12.10.5 below are met, or
         8.12.10.2.2. The aircraft is capable of being at or above the published non-standard
         takeoff minima ceiling requirement prior to crossing the departure end of the runway
         (for fixed-wing multi-engine, calculate this capability with One Engine Inoperative
         (OEI)) and can continue a climb profile that will vertically clear all obstacles.
     8.12.10.3. Unable to meet Required Climb Gradient. If unable to meet or exceed the
     required climb gradient and before reducing a published gradient with one of the methods
     listed below, MAJCOMs will ensure supervisors and PICs consider: reducing aircraft
AFI11-202V3_AFMCSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2011                                                        69


     gross weight, delaying the mission until environmental conditions improve, the crew’s
     familiarity with the departure area and the ability to increase performance by jettisoning
     external stores. If still unable to comply with the required gradient after exhausting the
     remedies in this chapter, an IFR departure is not authorized. Exception: If the mission
     justifies the increased risk, and if specifically authorized by the MAJCOM/A3, the pilot
     may depart any location, in VMC, without regard to the IFR climb gradient. Without
     such specific authorization, pilots will refer to Chapter 7.
     8.12.10.4. Single Engine Aircraft and All Helicopters. PIC’s will ensure the aircraft
     meets or exceeds the published climb gradient (or 200 ft/NM if a higher gradient is not
     published) for the selected departure to an appropriate minimum IFR altitude IAW
     paragraph 8.13.
         8.12.10.4.1. If unable to comply and when authorized by the MAJCOM, climb in
         VMC to an appropriate IFR altitude or fly VFR IAW Chapter 7.
     8.12.10.5. Multi-Engine Fixed Wing Aircraft. PIC’s will ensure the aircraft meets or
     exceeds the published climb gradient (or 200 ft/NM if a higher gradient is not published)
     for the selected IFR departure method, with One Engine Inoperative (OEI), to an
     appropriate MIA.
         8.12.10.5.1. If operationally necessary, the operations supervisor (or equivalent
         mission execution authority supervisor) may authorize the PIC to ensure the aircraft
         vertically clears all obstacles along the planned departure path OEI by subtracting up
         to 48’/NM from the published (or standard) climb gradient or the use of the departure
         runway’s SDP for OEI departure planning (IAW 8.12.11.).
         8.12.10.5.2. When using any method to reduce the required climb gradient, the PIC
         must still ensure the aircraft, with all engines operating (AEO), meets or exceeds the
         published climb gradient and all ATC or SID climb restrictions for the method
         selected.
  8.12.11. Special Departure Procedures (SDP). MAJCOMs may authorize SDPs for OEI
  departure planning when operationally necessary. The following guidance applies to the use
  of SDP’s or similar specifically designed departure procedures and/or routing for use in the
  event of the loss of an engine’s thrust. The term SDP refers to all such procedures/routing
  and not to any one particular product. All such products must be constructed from data and
  criteria specifically approved by HQ AFFSA/A3O. MAJCOMs must certify pilots prior to
  the use of SDPs. PICs must understand a SDP delivers as little as zero feet of obstruction
  clearance and must be flown exactly as published. PIC’s shall:
  8.12.11. (AFMC) Units wishing to develop SDPs must coordinate through AFMC/A3V via
  an AFMC Form 73. OG/CC’s may authorize the use of published SDP’s. Refer to AFI 11-
  2FT Vol 1 for guidance on developing training plans and documentation.
     8.12.11.1. Use only the most current procedure and brief the procedure prior to takeoff,
     8.12.11.2. Not exceed the maximum gross weight published for the procedure,
     8.12.11.3. Fly SDP routing that differs from clearance routing only in an emergency,
     unless approved by ATC.

8.13. Minimum IFR Altitude (MIA). This section is not applicable to climbs and descents
required for takeoff and landing or practice approaches.
   8.13.1. On Airways. Pilots shall not fly lower than the Minimum En route Altitude (MEA),
   Minimum Reception Altitude (MRA), Minimum Crossing Altitude (MCA) or Minimum
   Obstacle Clearance Altitude (MOCA) published for the airway.
      8.13.1.1. Pilots using the MOCA shall ensure that the altitude selected will provide
      suitable navigation facility and ATC radio reception.
   8.13.2. Off Airways. Pilots shall fly no lower than:
      8.13.2.1. The Off Route Obstacle Clearance Altitude (OROCA).
      8.13.2.2. The Off Route Terrain Clearance Altitude (ORTCA).
          8.13.2.2.1. Pilots using the OROCA or ORTCA shall ensure that the altitude selected
          will provide suitable navigation facility and ATC radio communication reception.
      8.13.2.3. An altitude that provides at least 1,000 ft. of clearance above all obstacles
      within 5 nautical miles of the course to be flown in non-mountainous terrain or 2,000 ft.
      in mountainous terrain (see paragraph 2.11. & Glossary).
      8.13.2.4. Descent below applicable MIAs, listed above, is only authorized under the
      following conditions:
          8.13.2.4.1. To an ATC-provided Minimum radar Vectoring Altitude (MVA) within
          the NAS from a suitably equipped and capable radar facility. For areas of
          responsibility outside the NAS, MAJCOMs will determine which radar facilities are
          not suitably equipped and capable.
              8.13.2.4.1.1. If there is any doubt as to whether the ATC-provided minimum
              vectoring altitude is providing adequate obstacle clearance pilots should not
              descend below the non-radar minimum altitudes listed above.
              8.13.2.4.1.2. In no case will the minimum altitude be below 1000 ft. AGL.
          8.13.2.4.2. When cloud clearance and visibility, IAW Tables 7.1/7.2 or MAJCOM
          direction, allow the pilot to maintain safe clearance from terrain and obstacles, or
          8.13.2.4.3. When a MAJCOM-approved self-contained navigation system (or
          approved Terrain Following/Terrain Avoidance system (TF/TA)) is used.
   8.13.3. Military Training Routes (MTR). Pilots operating on MTRs shall adhere to the
   minimum altitudes published in FLIP AP.
8.14. IFR Cruising Altitudes.
   8.14.1. Pilots should file requested altitudes for IFR flights in controlled airspace according
   to the cruising altitude diagram depicted on the appropriate en route chart.
   8.14.2. Pilots operating in uncontrolled airspace shall maintain altitude IAW the diagrams
   published on the appropriate en route chart.
8.15. IFR Enroute Navigation. Pilots shall fly along the centerline of the direct course
between NAVAIDS or fixes defining a published or unpublished route when operating in
controlled airspace under IFR unless:
AFI11-202V3_AFMCSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2011                                                            71


   8.15.1. Authorized by the controlling agency, or while operating in SUA or on MTRs.
8.16. In-Flight Communications.
   8.16.1. Position Reports. A pilot operating under IFR will continuously monitor
   appropriate ATC frequencies and follow FIH instructions for position reports, lost
   communications, and radio procedures.
   8.16.2. Navigation and Communication Equipment Malfunctions. When operating in
   controlled airspace under IFR, the PIC will immediately report to ATC the loss or
   impairment of navigational or air-to-ground communications capability according to
   instructions in the FIH.
   8.16.3. Cancellation of IFR Clearance. Pilots shall ensure compliance with Chapter 7 of
   this instruction before canceling IFR. VFR flight following requirements are not required if
   already in contact with the destination’s control tower.
8.17. Descent, Approach and Landing. Pilots will obtain the latest destination airport
conditions prior to beginning descent or commencing an approach. See paragraph 8.10.
   8.17.1. Prior to Descent or Approach. Pilots shall not begin an en route descent, arrival or
   published approach if the destination’s weather is below the required approach minimums.
      8.17.1.1. After Beginning Descent or Approach. If a pilot has begun the en route
      descent, arrival or published approach (or has received a radar vector for the approach)
      and subsequently determines the weather is below minimums (visibility for straight-in
      approaches or either ceiling or visibility for circling approaches), the pilot must not
      deviate from the last ATC clearance until obtaining a new or amended clearance. The
      pilot may request a clearance to a holding fix or alternate airport, or, unless restricted by
      the MAJCOM, continue the approach as published to the Missed Approach Point (MAP)
      and land if the aircraft is in a position to make a safe landing and the runway environment
      is in sight (See AFMAN 11-217, Volume 1).
   8.17.2. Determining Visibility Minimums for Approach and Landing. Prevailing
   visibility (PV) may be used when RVR is not reported. For circling approaches, PV shall be
   used. See paragraph 8.10. MAJCOMs shall determine suitable weather minima based on
   aircraft equipage, level of autonomy and crew proficiency.
      8.17.2.1. Operational Criteria for Arriving Aircraft. USAF pilots will not use
      published visibility minima below 2,400 feet (or ½ SM or 800m) unless touchdown zone
      (TDZ) and centerline lighting (CL) are available and operable. Helicopter PICs will use
      touchdown zone RVR to determine visibility requirements.
          8.17.2.1.1. Category I (1800 RVR or greater). MAJCOMs may authorize Category I
          Instrument Landing System (ILS) approaches to less than 2400 RVR at locations
          without TDZ/CL (or when such system is inoperative) provided the approach is flown
          using guidance from an approved flight director, heads-up display, or coupled to an
          autopilot flown to a Decision Altitude. In addition to MAJCOM approval,
          authorization must be stated on the IAP.
          8.17.2.1.2. Category II (1200 to less than 1800 RVR). Touchdown zone RVR will
          be used to determine if visibility is suitable for the instrument approach procedure.
          For RVR 1600 to less than 1800, mid/rollout RVR values will be used as advisory
72                                            AFI11-202V3_AFMCSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2011


         information. If RVR is less than 1600, rollout RVR (or mid RVR, if rollout RVR
         inoperative) is also required.
         8.17.2.1.3. Category III (RVR less than 1200). All installed transmissometers must
         be operational. MAJCOMs will publish Category III RVR requirements (i.e. in 11-
         2MDS V3), if applicable.
         8.17.2.1.4. (Added-AFMC) Cat II and Cat III operations in IMC below Cat I
         minimums are restricted to approved test plans only. Certification will be handled on
         a case-by-case basis. Submit requests to HQ AFMC/A3V.
     8.17.2.2. Straight-In or Sidestep Approach. Weather must only be at or above the
     published visibility minimums.
     8.17.2.3. Circling Approach. Weather must be at or above both the published ceiling
     and visibility minimums.
     8.17.2.4. Inoperative Approach Lighting System (ALS). Unless paragraph 5.12.1.4.
     applies, when the runway ALS (or any portion thereof), as depicted on the procedure, is
     inoperative, pilots shall increase the published visibility minimums of an instrument
     approach by one of the following:
         8.17.2.4.1. As directed by the inoperative components table in FLIP.
         8.17.2.4.2. As stated on IAP, NOTAMs, ATIS, or other airport information source.
         8.17.2.4.3. If no other guidance is provided, increase published visibility by ½ mile.
         8.17.2.4.4. This paragraph applies only to the ALS itself, not to Visual Approach
         Slope Indicator (VASI) or Precision Approach Path Indicator (PAPI).
  8.17.3. Conventional Approach. Pilots will fly conventional approaches IAW this
  instruction, AFMAN 11-217, Volume 1, MDS-series Volumes 3, and other governing
  directives (including the AIM, when appropriate) as defined by the MAJCOM.
  8.17.4. RADAR Approach. For pilots to fly a published radar approach or instrument
  approach procedure that requires radar to define a fix essential for flying the approach, a non-
  radar facility must provide a positive aircraft position within 25 NMs of the airfield. Pilots
  operating in Class A airspace may file to the nearest nonradar facility or fix (regardless of
  distance from the terminal) and request radar vector service to the terminal.
  8.17.5. Precision Runway Monitoring (PRM) Approach. Pilots shall not fly PRM
  approaches unless the pilot(s) and the aircraft are properly certified by the MAJCOM. Pilots
  unable to accept a PRM approach clearance must contact the Air Traffic Control System
  Command Center at 1-800-333-4286 to coordinate an arrival time. Without coordination,
  pilots should expect an ATC-directed divert to a non-PRM airport.
  8.17.5. (AFMC) PRM approaches are authorized for AFMC aircraft provided the aircraft is
  equipped with appropriate IFR equipment to include dual VHF radios, and aircrew training is
  accomplished and documented IAW AFI 11-2FT Vol 1.
     8.17.5.1. TCAS II equipped aircraft will fly the ILS PRM approach in TA/RA mode.
AFI11-202V3_AFMCSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2011                                                          73


     8.17.5.2. If an ATC breakout and a TCAS RA are received simultaneously, or shortly
     after one another, the pilot will respond to any turns required in the breakout instructions
     as well as the vertical correction required by the TCAS system.
  8.17.6. Self-Contained Approach (SCA). A MAJCOM-approved arrival procedure flown
  from a MIA to a landing surface using only the navigational equipment on board the aircraft
  (GPS, radar or other sensors). These procedures may be practiced in the NAS (or elsewhere
  with host-nation approval) under radar control, in conjunction with a published instrument
  approach procedure, in SUA or under VFR.
  8.17.6. (AFMC) The OG/CC may authorize the accomplishment of self-contained
  approaches as part of an approved test plan or FCF profile. Flight conditions will be day
  VMC unless the approach is TERPS-certified according to para 8.4., this supplement.
     8.17.6.1. Airborne Radar Approach (ARA). ARAs are instrument approaches
     conducted using navigational guidance provided by reference to the aircraft’s on-board
     radar system. ARA’s conducted in IMC shall be developed and approved by the
     MAJCOM TERPS office. For the purposes of filing under IFR, ARA approaches will be
     considered published if they meet the requirements of paragraph 8.4.
     8.17.6.2. SCA using GPS or other sensors. MAJCOMs will publish specific guidance
     and restrictions on the use of SCAs such as Self-Contained Navigation Systems (SCNS),
     Mission Computer Approaches, SCAs using FMS or other GPS-based systems (or other
     sensors) that have not been certified to civil IFR instrument approach standards. These
     procedures fall outside the construct of published instrument approaches and should be
     flown under VFR or closely follow a published instrument approach ground track.
     MAJCOMs that permit their pilots to fly SCAs in IMC during tactical operations must
     publish SCA guidance that includes, at a minimum:
         8.17.6.2.1. SCA weather minimums, minimum final approach segment dimensions,
         tracks, and minimum altitudes, based on aircraft equipage and capabilities. Along the
         planned ground track, a minimum of 300 feet (250 feet with TF/TA) of obstacle
         clearance must be observed between the MIA and the MDA/DA; and
         8.17.6.2.2. SCA missed approach procedures and ground tracks will be established
         and assessed for obstructions along the planned escape ground track, and require no
         more than a 200 ft/nm climb gradient; and
         8.17.6.2.3. SCA allowable course deviation standards, required actions when those
         standards are exceeded, aircraft equipage requirements, pilot certification and
         proficiency rules, landing surface marking/lighting requirements, and minimum
         standards of navigation system accuracy required to commence the procedure; and
         8.17.6.2.4. SCA guidance to ensure corrections (i.e. temperature, restrictions to
         visibility, NOTAM information, obstacle data, etc.) are applied to the procedure.
         Corrections will be applied to the MDA/DA and other altitudes using the best
         available data.
     8.17.6.3. (Added-AFMC) UAS platforms should fly the three-dimensional track of a
     published approach if an appropriate one is available. If no published approach is
     available, or if a valid operational requirement exists, self-contained approaches (SCA)
 74                                            AFI11-202V3_AFMCSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2011


       for UAS platforms will be constructed in accordance with the procedures outlined in AFI
       11-2FTV3. SCAs for use in IMC require OG/CC’s approval prior to executing the
       approach. Weather minima for these approaches are published in AFI 11-2FTV3.
   8.17.7. Temperature Correction. When the reported temperature at the altimeter setting
   source (normally the airfield), is lower than the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA)
   temperature, the aircraft’s actual altitude will be lower than the barometric altimeter
   indicates. It is critical that pilots flying aircraft equipped with FMS that compensate for cold
   temperatures be familiar with the conditions under which the FMS calculates cold weather
   altitudes. During all flight operations, to maintain obstacle clearance, pilots will use the FIH
   chart (or FMS calculations) to apply cold weather corrections to barometric altitudes on IAPs
   IAW Table 8.2.
       8.17.7.1. In lieu of MAJCOM guidance, while in IMC in mountainous terrain, pilots will
       plan to fly at least 1,000 ft above published minimum altitudes obtained from IFR
       enroute charts and terrain charts (e.g. MEAs, MOCAs, OROCAs or other minimum safe
       altitudes during low-levels, etc.) if the temperature at those altitudes is colder than 10°C
       below ISA.
       8.17.7.2. Pilots will not apply a temperature correction to an ATC assigned altitude, but
       may refuse a lower altitude if obstacle protection is in doubt.
       8.17.7.3. When applying corrections to IAP altitudes, pilots will advise ATC if any
       applied correction exceeds 80 feet.

   8.17.8. Determining DH/DA/MDA. Pilots shall determine minimum approach altitudes
   (DH, DA or MDA) with the barometric altimeter except when flying a Category II/III ILS
   approach. When flying a Category II/III ILS approach use the radar altimeter to determine
   DH and use the barometric altimeter as a supporting instrument. Pilots shall not fly Category
   II or III approaches unless the pilot(s) and the aircraft are properly certified by the MAJCOM
   IAW appropriate civil standards. MAJCOM should direct procedures for the use of radar
   altimeters during all other approach types, including during tactical operations.
       8.17.8.1. (Added-AFMC) For other than Category II/III Instrument Landing System
       approaches, radar altimeters should be set to HAT/HAA (unless other installed equipment
       and/or flight manual procedures direct otherwise). However, primary reference for
       MDA/DH is the barometric altimeter.
AFI11-202V3_AFMCSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2011                                                           75


   8.17.9. Descent Below DH/DA/MDA. Continuing an approach below DH/DA/MDA is not
   authorized until sufficient visual reference with the runway environment has been established
   and the aircraft is in a position to execute a safe landing. The term ―runway environment‖ is
   defined in the glossary and AFMAN 11-217, Volume 1.
   8.17.10. Executing the Missed Approach. If on arrival at the MAP or DH/DA (or at any
   time thereafter) any of the requirements in paragraph 8.17.9. are not met, the pilot shall
   immediately execute the appropriate missed approach procedure, ATC issued climb out
   instructions or other ATC clearance.
       8.17.10.1. To ensure obstacle/terrain clearance, the missed approach procedure may not
       be initiated until over the MAP/DH/DA, unless otherwise cleared by ATC. Climbing
       prior to the MAP/DH/DA is permitted but ATC should be advised as soon as practical.
       8.17.10.2. Prior to starting any instrument approach, pilots will ensure their aircraft can
       accomplish the missed approach. Unless a higher climb gradient is published or assigned
       by ATC, maintain a minimum climb gradient of 200 ft/NM during the missed approach.
       ―Copter Only‖ approaches require a minimum climb gradient of 400 ft/NM. If, during an
       emergency, an aircraft is unable to comply with the missed approach routing or climb
       requirements, pilots should coordinate for alternate climb out instructions to ensure the
       aircraft will vertically clear all obstacles.
8.18. IFR "VFR-on-Top. " Unless otherwise restricted by the MAJCOM, PICs may request
and fly IFR "VFR on Top" operations (IAW AFMAN 11-217V2 guidance) when the mission
requires such clearances. If the PIC cancels the IFR clearance, comply with Chapter 7.
8.19. Performance Specification Airspace. PIC’s will ensure their aircraft is properly
equipped, certified, and approved before operating in any performance specification airspace
(e.g. MNPS/RVSM/RNP-10/BRNAV, etc). See CNS/ATM requirements in Chapter 2.

      CREW REST, FATIGUE MANAGEMENT AND FLIGHT DUTY LIMITATIONS

9.1. Background Information. This chapter prescribes mandatory crew rest and maximum
Flight Duty Periods (FDP) for all personnel who operate USAF aircraft. Basic guidance for
fatigue management strategies and waiver authority procedures are also addressed.
9.2. Waiver Authority. Procedures in this chapter may be waived by:
   9.2.1. MAJCOM/A3 when an ORM assessment determines that mission requirements justify
   the increased risk. At MAJCOM/A3 discretion, waiver authority may be further delegated to
   no lower than the operations group commander (or equivalent). Waivers to crew rest and
   flight duty limitations may be published in MAJCOM guidance or on a case-by-case basis.
   Exception: when authorized by the MAJCOM/A3, the PIC may extend maximum FDP up to
   2 hours to compensate for unplanned mission delays, provided the mission requirements
   justify the increased risk.
   9.2.1. (AFMC) Waiver authority is delegated to AFMC/A3V.
   9.2.2. COMAFFOR (in the grade of O-8 or higher) for forces under his or her operational
   control during contingencies and impending or actual hostilities. Waiver authority may be
   delegated to no lower than Air Component Commander/A3 or equivalent level.
9.3. Fatigue Management Authorization. Regardless of authorized FDP, the PIC will restrict
duty time, extend crew rest periods or terminate a mission/mission leg if safety may be
compromised by fatigue factors.
9.4. Terms Explained.
   9.4.1. Aircrew or Crew. The full complement of military, civilian and contract personnel
   required to operate a USAF aircraft and to complete an assigned mission.
   9.4.2. Aircrew Member. An individual, designated on the Flight Authorization, who:
        9.4.2.1. Is an aircrew member as explained in AFPD 11-4, Aviation Service, AFI 11-402,
        Aviation and Parachutist Service, Aeronautical Ratings and Badges, and,
        9.4.2.2. Is assigned to a position listed in AFI 65-503, US Air Force Cost and Planning
        Factors, and,
        9.4.2.3. Is designated on orders to fulfill specific aeronautical tasks.
   9.4.3. Augmented Aircrew. A basic aircrew supplemented by additional aircrew members
   to permit in-flight rest periods IAW paragraph 9.4.8. If the basic aircrew requires only one
   pilot and a second qualified pilot (includes pilots enrolled in an AETC formal aircrew
   training course) is designated an aircrew member to augment pilot duties, the crew can be
   considered augmented.
   9.4.4. Basic Aircrew. Aircrew positions as defined in the aircraft T.O. (or MDS-specific
   AFI) for the normal operation of the aircraft or mission.
   9.4.5. Crew Rest Period. The crew rest period is normally a minimum 12-hour non-duty
   period before the FDP begins. Its purpose is to ensure the aircrew member is adequately
AFI11-202V3_AFMCSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2011                                                          77


   rested before performing flight or flight related duties. Crew rest is free time, and includes
   time for meals, transportation, and rest. Rest is defined as a condition that allows an
   individual the opportunity to sleep.
      9.4.5.1. (Added-AFMC) Time spent traveling (e.g., as a passenger or in a POV) to or
      from a TDY location does not count as crew rest for subsequent FDP.
      9.4.5.2. (Added-AFMC) USAF TPS students will not be scheduled for events, which
      would deny them 12 hours of crew rest. However, students may elect to use school
      facilities (i.e., computers, data reduction equipment and audio-visual equipment) so long
      as it does not interfere with the opportunity for at least 8 hours of uninterrupted rest
      during the 12 hours immediately prior to the beginning of the flight duty period. To
      ensure this happens, students will depart the USAF TPS no later than 1 hour before the 8
      hour window for uninterrupted rest begins (e.g., 12 hour duty day plus 3 additional hours
      at TPS are allowed).
   9.4.6. Flight Duty Period. FDP begins when an aircrew member reports for a mission,
   briefing, or other official duty and ends when engines are shut down at the end of the
   mission, mission leg, or a series of missions. FDP for UAS ends at final engine shut down,
   final in-flight handover briefing, or final crew swap, whichever occurs last.
      9.4.6.1. (Added-AFMC) For deployed crews, FDP normally begins upon arrival to the
      aircraft unless crew briefing occurs earlier. Aircraft commanders should apply judgment
      to adjust FDP start time to unique situations such as lengthy travel times from billeting.
      The crew chief is responsible to the pilot in command when deployed. IAW AFI 21-101,
      the pilot in command will determine how long the crew chief can safely perform aircraft
      maintenance actions. As a minimum, the crew chief must have the opportunity to sleep 8
      hours in each 24-hour period.
      9.4.6.2. (Added-AFMC) FCF/ACF, proficiency training, test sorties, test support
      sorties, and tactical events, must be completed during the first 12 hours of the FDP and
      are limited to a maximum of three sorties per day. Sorties are defined as stops for the
      purpose of refueling or stops with significant ground time/delay. FCF/ACF missions will
      be rescheduled if unexpected delays prevent completion of all required items within the
      normal flight duty period. Waiver authority for this paragraph is the OG/CC.
   9.4.7. ―Deadhead‖ Time. For crew rest purposes, ―deadhead‖ time is computed as FDP. If
   an aircrew member will perform in-flight or crew-specialty related duties (i.e., aircraft off-
   loading or performance data calculations) in conjunction with ―deadheading‖, paragraphs
   9.8., 9.11., 9.12. and Table 9.1 apply.
   9.4.8. Sleeping Provisions. Sleeping provisions are crew bunks or other MAJCOM-defined
   rest facilities aboard the aircraft. Rest facilities should provide adequate privacy and noise
   levels to obtain suitable rest.
9.5. Alert Duty. MAJCOMs establish alert and compensatory periods in keeping with mission
requirements and an ORM assessment.
9.5. (AFMC)Alert Duty. Not applicable to AFMC.
9.6. Maximum Flying Time. 56 hours flight time logged per 7 consecutive days, 125 hours
flight time logged per 30 consecutive days and 330 hours per 90 consecutive days.

9.7. Maximum FDP. (see Table 9.1)
   9.7.1. If official post-flight duties are anticipated to exceed 2 hours, commanders should
   consider reducing the FDP to ensure the safe completion of those duties.
   9.7.2. For single pilot aircraft or when only one pilot has access to the flight controls, the
   maximum FDP is 12 hours.
   9.7.3. (Added-AFMC) To minimize risk due to fatigue, supervisors at all levels may
   further restrict crew duty day for events such as flight test, practice takeoffs, emergency
   procedures, air refueling, low level operations, low approaches, touch-and-go landings, or
   night operations.
   9.7.4. (Added-AFMC) AFMC/A3 authorizes OG/CC to extend the flight duty period, as
   outlined in this chapter, up to 2 hours. The PIC is not authorized to extend flight duty period.
   For all other waivers to this chapter forward the request to HQ AFMC/A3V.

9.8. Crew Rest. Aircrew require at least 10 continuous hours of restful activities (including an
opportunity for at least 8 hours of uninterrupted sleep) during the 12 hours immediately prior to
the FDP. To ensure individual accountability and mission reliability, crewmembers should be
officially notified prior to entering a crew rest period. A crew rest period cannot begin until after
the completion of official duties.
   9.8.1. Crew rest is compulsory for any aircrew member prior to performing any of the
   following flight-related duties: preflight, load/unload, start, and taxi aircraft.
   9.8.2. Each aircrew member is individually responsible to ensure that he or she obtains
   sufficient rest during crew rest periods. Activities that would prevent the opportunity to
   achieve at least 8 hours of uninterrupted sleep are discouraged.
9.9. Crew Rest Interruptions. Any official business or duty that requires the active
participation of an aircrew member interrupts the crew rest period. This includes official
AFI11-202V3_AFMCSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2011                                                             79


business conducted on the telephone or other electronic means. If crew rest is interrupted so that
the individual cannot get an opportunity for at least 8 hours of uninterrupted sleep, the individual
must be afforded the opportunity for at least 8 more hours of uninterrupted sleep plus reasonable
time to dress, eat, travel, etc. Intentional crew rest interruptions shall only be made under the
most exceptional circumstances. The individual must consider unofficial interruptions so that
the intent of paragraph 9.8. is met. If crew rest is interrupted, individuals will inform a
supervisor and remove themselves from the flight schedule, when necessary.
9.10. Exceptions to the 12-Hour Minimum Crew Rest Period. For continuous operations
when basic aircrew FDPs are greater than 12 but less than 14 hours, subsequent crew rest may be
reduced proportionally to a minimum of 10 hours in order to maintain a 24-hour work/rest
schedule.
   9.10.1. Continuous operations means three or more consecutive FDPs of at least 12 hours
   duration separated by minimum crew rest.
       9.10.1.1. The 10-hour crew rest exception shall only be used to keep crews in 24-hour
       clock cycles, not for scheduling convenience or additional sortie generation.
       9.10.1.2. Any reduction from 12 hours crew rest requires pre-coordination for
       transportation, meals and quarters, so that crewmembers are provided an opportunity for
       at least 8 hours of uninterrupted sleep.
9.11. Scheduling Restrictions. Aircrews will not perform flight duties until the requirements of
paragraph 9.8 have been met.
   9.11.1. Aircrew members must maintain a medical clearance from the flight surgeon to
   perform in-flight duties. All medical or dental treatment obtained from any source must be
   cleared by a flight surgeon prior to reporting for flight duty.
   9.11.2. Use of any medication or dietary supplements is governed by AFI 48-123 and as
   approved by a flight surgeon. Aircrew members will not normally self-medicate. In the
   absence of other MAJCOM guidance, the following is a partial list of medications that may
   be used without medical consultation:
       9.11.2.1. Single doses of over-the-counter (OTC) aspirin, acetaminophen or ibuprofen to
       provide analgesia for minor self-limiting conditions.
       9.11.2.2. OTC skin antiseptics, topical anti-fungals, 1 percent hydrocortisone cream, or
       benzoyl peroxide for minor wounds and skin diseases which do not hinder flying duties
       or wear of personal equipment.
       9.11.2.3. OTC antacids for mild isolated episodes of indigestion.
       9.11.2.4. OTC hemorrhoidal suppositories.
       9.11.2.5. OTC bismuth subsalicylate for mild cases of diarrhea.
       9.11.2.6. OTC oxymetazoline or phenylephrine nasal sprays may be carried should
       unexpected ear or sinus block occur during flight. Aircrew may only use such sprays as
       ―get me downs.‖ Do not use to treat symptoms of head congestion prior to flight.

      9.11.2.7. For information on medication, see Aerospace Medicine policy letters at:
      https://kx.afms.mil/kxweb/dotmil/kjPage.do?cid=CTB_020686&functionalArea=Ae
      rospaceMedicine.
   9.11.3. Aircrew members will not fly:
      9.11.3.1. Within 24 hours of compressed gas diving (including SCUBA), surface
      supplied diving, hyperbaric (compression) chamber exposure or aircraft pressurization
      checks (to below sea level) that exceed 10 minutes duration (this restriction not
      applicable to UAS ground control station operations).
      9.11.3.1. (AFMC) AFMC/A3 waives the 24-hour restriction for aircraft pressurization
      checks that keep the aircraft cabin at or above sea level. The 24-hour flight restriction
      does apply for any aircraft pressurization checks that result in a cabin pressure below sea
      level for more than 10 cumulative minutes in a 24-hour period.
          9.11.3.1.1. Exceptions: Following HEEDS training, aircrew may only fly within the
          24 hour window if the aircraft’s maximum altitude remains below 10,000 ft. MSL.
          Pararescue aircrew personnel will follow guidelines IAW US Navy Diving
              Manual on flying and diving restrictions.
      9.11.3.2. Within 12 hours after completion of a hypobaric (altitude) chamber flight
      above 25,000 ft. MSL. Personnel may fly as passengers in aircraft during this period,
      provided the planned mission will maintain a cabin altitude of 10,000 ft. MSL or less.
      For altitude chamber flights to a maximum altitude of 25,000 ft. MSL or below, aircrew
      members may fly without delay as crewmembers or passengers if their cabin altitude
      does not exceed 15,000 ft. MSL (this restriction not applicable to UAS ground control
      station operations).
      9.11.3.3. Within 72 hours after donating blood, plasma or bone marrow. The flying unit
      commander must approve donations of blood, plasma or bone marrow by aircrew
      members.
      9.11.3.4. Within 12 hours of consuming alcohol or other intoxicating substance, or while
      impaired by its after effects. See also paragraph 5.1.4.
   9.11.4. MAJCOMs should establish scheduling restrictions for aircrew members who, for
   duty or personal reasons, transit multiple time zones less than 24 hours prior to reporting for
   flying duty.
9.12. Alertness Management Strategies. Commanders, mission planners, aerospace medicine
personnel and crewmembers share responsibility for alertness management.
   9.12.1. MAJCOMs will emphasize alertness management programs or procedures to
   minimize the risks associated with aircrew fatigue. These should include:
      9.12.1.1. Commander’s Responsibilities. Commanders use reasonable means to
      manage the health and welfare of their crew forces. Use aircrew and family education to
      emphasize the importance of aircrew fitness and alertness on duty performance.
      Consultation with aerospace medicine or other fatigue management experts is advisable.
      9.12.1.2. Fatigue Mitigation. Mechanisms to ensure that at all stages of the mission,
      commanders, mission planners and PICs assess the impact of reduced aircrew alertness.
AFI11-202V3_AFMCSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2011                                                        81


         9.12.1.2.1. Assessments should include the fatiguing effects of weather, extremes of
         temperature, nighttime operations and use of NVDs, poor sleeping conditions (due to
         both location and time of day), mission delays, and restrictive personal equipment.
            9.12.1.2.1.1. Commanders, mission planners, aerospace medicine personnel and
            PICs must continually execute ORM assessments and implement alertness
            management strategies such as: extending crew rest periods, pre-positioning
            crews, using sleep quarantine facilities, non-pharmacological countermeasures
            such as controlled cockpit rest, bright light or physical activity breaks;
            pharmacological agents (go and no-go pills), and fatigue management education
            and training.
         9.12.1.2.2. To combat cumulative fatigue, commanders should grant additional crew
         rest, or limit consecutive duty days, during surge, combat, max-effort, or operations
         near maximum FDPs.
     9.12.1.3. Fatigue Countermeasure Medications. MAJCOMs will provide guidance on
     the use of go and no-go medications IAW AF/SG policy. For more information see:
     https://kx.afms.mil/kxweb/dotmil/kj.do?functionalArea=AerospaceMedicine.This
     website contains policy letters, approved medications, forms, dosage and warnings for
     approved fatigue countermeasures medications. The website will be updated as required
     by AFMOA/SG3PF.
     9.12.1.3. (AFMC) Use of go and no-go medication will be in accordance with current
     AF/SG policy.
     9.12.1.4. Controlled Cockpit Rest. Unless further restricted in MAJCOM guidance or
     MDS specific Volume 3, controlled cockpit rest may be implemented when the basic
     aircrew includes a second qualified pilot. All cockpit crewmembers must remain at their
     stations. Cockpit rest shall be limited to 45 minutes, taken by only one crew member at a
     time and must be restricted to non-critical phases of flight between cruise and one hour
     prior to planned descent. More than one rest period per crewmember is permitted.
     Cockpit rest is not authorized with any aircraft system malfunctions that increase cockpit
     workload (e.g., Autopilot, Navigation Systems). The resting crewmember must be
     roused immediately if a situation develops that may affect flight safety. Cockpit rest
     shall not be a substitute for any required crew rest.
  9.12.2. Flight publications describe procedures for loss of pressurization, oxygen, cockpit
  temperature control, inoperative autopilot, and other in-flight malfunctions or emergencies
  that restrict flight duration and contribute to aircrew fatigue. Such limitations in flight
  publications take precedence over less restrictive standards in this instruction.

Terms
Some terms printed here are reserved for future use or are intended to define a common
vocabulary for HQ AFFSA, MAJCOM, USAF aircrew and industry users of this AFI.—
1090mHz Extended Squitter (1090 ES)—The most mature of the 3 ADS-B link options. A
―Squitter‖ provides a spontaneous transmission containing information about the aircraft’s
identification, position, altitude, velocity, and route of flight information. It uses the Mode S
transponders as a basis for operation.
8.33KHz spacing—Due to frequency congestion in the 118-137 MHz range (voice
communications) in Europe, the normal spacing between frequencies (25 kHz) was further
divided into three 8.33 kHz bands.
Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS—B)—Aircraft equipment that
automatically broadcasts routine messages which include its position (such as lat, long, altitude),
velocity, and altitude. Other information may also be included.
Aerobatics—Intentionally performed spins, vertical recoveries, and other maneuvers that require
pitch and bank angles greater than 90 degrees.
Air Force Flight Standards Agency (AFFSA)—HQ USAF Field Operating Agency (FOA)
charged with the development, standardization, evaluation and certification of procedures,
equipment and standards to support global flight operations. Centrally manages ATCALS, the
SDP program contract, performs combat flight inspection, and instructs the Air Force Advanced
Instrument School for USAF pilots. Central agency responsible for global USAF Terminal
Instrument Procedures. Headquartered at the FAA’s Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center in
Oklahoma City, OK.
Air Combat Tactics—A general term that includes basic fighter maneuvers, air combat
maneuvers, and air combat tactics.
AFI11-202V3_AFMCSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2011                                                             91


Civil Twilight—Evening Civil Twilight is the period that begins at sunset and ends in the
evening when the center of the sun’s disk is 6 degrees below the horizon. Morning Civil
Twilight begins in the morning when the center of the sun’s disk is 6 degrees below the horizon,
and ends at sunrise. Use an authorized weather source, the latest version of the Air Almanac,
MAJCOM-approved computer program or US Naval Observatory data to determine and
calculate light and moon data. Both periods of twilight are considered ―day‖, unless further
restricted by the MAJCOM.
Communication, Navigation, Surveillance, and Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM)—An
umbrella term used to describe the emerging avionics technologies and architecture of space- and
ground-based systems designed to bring about Free Flight. Examples include: RNAV/RNP,
RVSM, CPDLC, ADS-B, elementary and enhanced Mode S, 8.33 kHz radios, FM
Immunity, TCAS, and TAWS—Previously termed Global Air Traffic Management (GATM)
by the DoD.
Composite Flight Plan—A flight plan which specifies VFR operation for one portion of flight
and IFR for another portion.
Controller-Pilot Data Link Communications (CDPLC)—An ―email-like‖ data link between
pilots and ATC that will augment and may replace voice communications. The two
environments for CPDLC are currently Future Aeronautical Navigation System 1/A (FANS-1/A)
and the Aeronautical Telecommunications Network (ATN).
Critical Phase of Flight—For the purposes of this AFI, this term shall include: Terminal Area
operations including taxi, takeoff and landing, Low-level flight, Air Refueling, Airdrop, weapons
employment, flight using NVGs, tactical/air combat and formation operations (other than cruise)
and all portions of any test or functional check flight or any aerial demonstration.
(Added-AFMC) (AFMC) Critical Phase of Flight— This definition replaces the Critical
Phase of Flight definition in the basic instruction. For AFMC, Critical Phase of Flight is defined
as; Takeoff, low level (below MSA), airdrop, weapon delivery, air refueling, envelope-
expansion test points, in-flight emergencies, approach, and landing.
Day—The time between the beginning of morning civil twilight and the end of evening civil
twilight, as published in the Air Almanac, converted to local time.
Down link Aircraft Parameters (DAP)—This is data down-linked to the ground, via the Mode
S transponder, that provides information about the aircraft operations and planned route. The
three types of DAP are ―basic functionality‖ (flight ID, transponder capability, and flight status),
―enhanced‖ [EHS] and ―elementary‖ [ELS] surveillance features also provide flight intent
information.
Decision Altitude/Decision Height (DA/DH)—A specified altitude in the precision approach at
which a decision must be made to either continue the approach if the pilot acquires the required
visual references, or to immediately climb or execute a missed approach.   Outside the NAS,
Decision altitude is referenced to mean sea level and decision height is referenced to the
threshold elevation.
Diverse Departure—If the airport has at least one published approach, the absence of any non-
standard takeoff minimums and/or IFR departure procedures for a specific runway normally
indicates that runway meets diverse departure criteria. Pilots departing a diverse runway may
 92                                             AFI11-202V3_AFMCSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2011


climb runway heading to 400 ft. above the DER elevation and then turn in any direction provided
the aircraft maintains a minimum climb gradient of 200 ft/NM until reaching the appropriate IFR
altitude. Published ―Sector‖ diverse departures (i.e. ―Diverse Departure authorized 145° CW to
278° with min climb gradient of…) are authorized as an Obstacle Departure Procedure.
Embedded GPS/INS (EGI)—A military, self-contained navigation system that provides
positioning, velocity, and acceleration data for the aircraft. The EGI receives signals from GPS.
The EGI receiver tracks up to five satellites simultaneously.
Enhanced Surveillance (EHS)—Support of EHS consists of populating and maintaining three
Mode S transponder registers beyond those required for ELS: Selected Vertical Intention, Track
and Turn Report, and Heading and Speed Report.
Elementary Surveillance (ELS)—Support of ELS consists primarily of populating and
maintaining four Mode S transponder registers: Data Link Capability Report, Common-Usage
Ground Initiated Comm B (GICB) Capability Report, Aircraft Identification (Flight ID), and
Airborne Collision Avoidance System (ACAS) resolution advisory.
Extended Operations (ETOPS)—Those operations conducted over large bodies of water, or
desolate land areas, outside of gliding distance to a suitable landing site.
FAA Authorization—An authorization is an official written FAA document which provides the
petitioner relief from specified parts of the CFRs.
FAA Exemption—An exemption is an official written FAA document which provides the
petitioner relief from specified parts of the CFRs.
Fault Detection/Exclusion (FDE)—A GPS receiver capable of autonomously determining
which GPS satellite(s) is (are) causing the RAIM alert and then excluding the faulty satellite(s)
from the navigation solution. Flight in some civil airspace requires both RAIM and FDE.
Flight Mission Computer/Flight Management System (FMC/FMS)—An on-board computer
system that uses a database to allow routes and other navigation data to be preprogrammed. The
system is updated with respect to position accuracy by reference to conventional navigation aids.
Formation Flight—More than one aircraft which, by prior arrangement between the pilots,
operates as a single aircraft with regard to navigation and position reporting. Separation between
aircraft within the formation is the responsibility of the flight leader and the pilots of the other
aircraft in the flight. This includes transition periods when aircraft within the formation are
maneuvering to attain separation from each other to effect individual control and during joinup
and breakaway. Such a group is treated for ATC purposes as a single aircraft.
Free Flight—A safe and efficient operating capability under instrument flight rules in which the
pilot has the freedom to select routing, altitude, and speed in real time.
Fuel Reserve—The amount of usable fuel that must be carried on each aircraft, beyond that
required to complete the flight as planned.
Ground-Based Augmentation System (GBAS)—GBAS augments ground systems (typically at
an airport) with equipment similar in functionality to a GPS satellite. This augmentation allows
a properly equipped aircraft to increase the accuracy of the vertical/lateral GPS solution. The US
LAAS is a GBAS equivalent system.
AFI11-202V3_AFMCSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2011                                                          93


GNSS Landing System (GLS)—Hardware and software that augments the GPS SPS to provide
for precision approach and landing capability. Based on differential GPS concepts, the GLS
augments the basic GPS position data in order to increase the integrity, continuity, and accuracy
needed for a precision approach.
GPS-based Monitoring Unit (GMU)—An on-board monitoring and recording unit composed
of a GPS receiver, computer and flight deck windows antennae. An alternative to the ICAO
requirement of overflying a Height Monitoring Unit (HMU) as a means to check aircraft for
RVSM compliance.
Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)—An umbrella term adopted by ICAO to
encompass any independent satellite navigation system. GNSS provides suitably equipped
aircraft with en route/terminal navigation with non-precision approach and precision approach
capabilities. The U.S. system is GPS.
Global Positioning System (GPS)—A constellation of satellites that enables the user to receive
signals from six operational satellites nearly 100% of the time from most locations on Earth.
RAIM and FDE ensures the GPS derived solution meets the accuracy, availability, and integrity
requirements critical to flight safety
Differential GPS (GPS-D)—DGPS is a GPS augmentation that uses differential corrections to
the basic satellite measurements that are performed within the receiver. DGPS is based upon
accurate knowledge of the geographic location of Earth reference stations. This knowledge is
used to compute corrections to GPS parameters, error sources, and/or resultant positions. These
differential corrections are then transmitted to GPS users, either from a ground-based station
[e.g., LAAS] or from a satellite-based system [WAAS, EGNOS, GALILEO, etc]. GPS receivers
apply the corrections to their received GPS signals and compute a more optimum position. For a
civil user, differential GPS can improve accuracy from 100 meters to better than 10 meters.
Global Positioning System- Precise Positioning Service (GPS-PPS)—The military maintains
exclusive access to the more accurate "P-code" (pseudo random code). It is much more accurate,
much harder to jam and spoof. To provide better protection to military aircraft, the DoD has
encrypted the P-code to form Y-code. Horizontal accuracy is less than ten meters.
Global Positioning System Standard Positioning Service (GPS- SPS)—One of two levels of
GPS service used by both the military and civil aviation community in order to support aircraft
navigation and landing. Since a Presidential Order turned Selective Availability off, SPS
horizontal accuracy is about ten meters [vs. about 100 meters when SA is on].
GPS ―Overlay‖ Approaches—These are instrument approaches that were previously approved
for use with GPS based on an existing traditional instrument approach such as a VOR or NDB
approach. As most of the ―Overlay‖ approach locations now have RNAV (GPS) approaches,
there is no GPS ―Overlay‖ approach authorization from the FAA in the NAS.
Ground Control Element—Comprises the UAS ground control station, power generation units,
communications infrastructure and antenna arrays.
Height Monitoring Unit (HMU)—A passive, ground-based system that measures the geometric
height of an aircraft for comparison with the geometric height of the flight level at which it is
being flown. The HMU calculates altimetry system error using meteorological information and
the Mode-C/S height data. Overflight of an HMU satisfies the ICAO requirement to check

aircraft for RVSM compliance. Additional information on RVSM monitoring program can be
found at: http://www.tc.faa.gov/act-500/niaab/rvsm/naarmo_intro.asp
ICAO—The International Civil Aviation Organization (a UN Specialized Agency),
headquartered in Montreal, Canada, is the global forum for civil aviation that works to achieve
its vision of safe, secure and sustainable development of civil aviation through cooperation
amongst its member States. Promotes understanding and security through cooperative aviation
regulation.
Inertial Navigation System (INS)—A self contained, dead reckoning system that senses the
acceleration along the three axes of the aircraft and calculates the distance traveled from a
reference point. Accuracy of the system decreases with time.
Instrument Meteorological Conditions—Meteorological conditions expressed in terms of
visibility, distance from cloud, and ceiling less than the minima specified for visual
meteorological conditions.
Lateral Navigation (LNAV)—A function of RNAV equipment which calculates, displays, and
provides lateral guidance to a profile or path.
Land and Hold Short Operations (LAHSO)—Procedures developed to expedite traffic flow at
civil and joint-use airports needing additional tools to increase capacity. Allows civilian aircraft
to operate on intersecting runways simultaneously.
Low Close-in Obstacles—Those obstacles within the Initial Climb Area that require an
excessive climb gradient to a climb-to-altitude of 200 feet or less above the Departure End of
Runway elevation or alternate takeoff weather minima. These obstacles are published in
NOTAMs, on the SID chart or in the IFR Take-off Minimums and (Obstacle) Departure
Procedures section of the terminal procedure booklet. Typical chart notation is: ―NOTE: Rwy
17L, tree 5610' from DER, 212' left of centerline, 82' AGL/2723' MSL.‖
Minimum Fuel—Indicates that an aircraft's fuel supply has reached a state where, upon reaching
the destination, it can accept little or no delay. This is not an emergency situation but merely
indicates an emergency situation is possible should any undue delay occur.
Minimum IFR Altitude (MIA)—The lowest safe altitude permitted to be flown under IFR.
Normally, this is the lowest published IFR altitude (i.e. MEA, MOCA, OROCA, or ORTCA) for
a given area, not including any portion of an IAP. See paragraph 8.13.
Minimum Navigation Performance Specification (MNPS)—Implemented in the North
Atlantic region between FL285-420, it specifies a number of equipment, training, and procedural
requirements. MNPS navigation accuracy is equivalent to RNP 12.6. Dual long-range
navigation systems (LRNS) and dual long-range communication systems are required. RVSM is
mandatory in MNPS airspace. Aircraft that cannot meet dual LRNS requirements may be
accommodated on special routings ("Blue Spruce" routes). Aircraft that cannot meet RVSM
requirements are excluded from MNPS airspace unless operating on an ALTRV.
Mode 4—Transponder mode established to enable IFF (Identification Friend or Foe) functions
between military aircraft or military aircraft and military ground stations. Uses classified codes,
but operates on 1030 MHz and 1090 MHz, the same frequency pair used by the Air Traffic
Control Radar Beacon System that civil air traffic uses for Mode 3A/C, Mode S, and TCAS.
Mode 4 interrogation signals can suppress civil airborne transponders, therefore all Mode 4
AFI11-202V3_AFMCSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2011                                                            95


operations in the NAS require prior authorization through the Air Force Frequency Management
Agency (AFFMA): affma.cc@pentagon.af.mil.
Mode 5—Mode 5 is the performance upgrade to the current Mark XII IFF transponder
system. Mode 5 provides new waveforms, new cryptography, more data, and improved radio
frequency (RF) link margin to resolve many of the deficiencies identified with Mark XII. It will
eventually replace the analog Mode 4 IFF system with digital IFF message formats which embed
unprecedented combat relevant data.
Mode Select (Mode S)—The primary role of the Mode S transponder is to "selectively" respond
to interrogations [as opposed to responding to all interrogations] from a ground sensor or TCAS
to provide airborne data information including identification, equipage, and altitude.
Mountainous Terrain—Defined in 14 CFR §95.11 for CONUS, Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto
Rico. PANS-OPS defines mountainous terrain as an area over which the changes of surface
elevation exceed 900m (3,000 ft) within a distance of 18.5 km (10.0 NM), or 300 ft over a 1 NM
distance. AFFSA believes the PANS OPS definition is too restrictive, so instead chose to use the
definition from NATO’s ATP 56(B) (Part 3, Chapter 4) that defines mountainous terrain as 500
ft surface elevation change over a ½ NM distance.
National Airspace System (NAS)—The NAS is the common network of United States (U.S.)
airspace: air navigation facilities, equipment, services, airports or landing areas, aeronautical
charts, information/services, rules, regulations, procedures, technical information, manpower and
material. Included are system components shared jointly with the military. United States, in a
geographical sense, means (1) the States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the
possessions, including the territorial waters (within 12 nautical miles) and (2) the airspace of
those areas. Note: IAW ICAO Article 12 and Annex 2 and 11, the United States has accepted
responsibility for providing air traffic services within airspace overlying the high seas beyond 12
miles from the coast (also known as international airspace). These flight information regions of
international airspace include: Oakland Oceanic, Anchorage Oceanic, Anchorage Continental,
Anchorage Arctic, Miami Oceanic, Houston Oceanic and New York Oceanic. Aircrews should
be aware that although they are being provided air traffic services by the FAA, they are operating
in international airspace and ICAO SARPS, FLIP, and AFIs are applicable. (See paragraph 1.2)
Night—The time between the end of evening civil twilight and the beginning of morning civil
twilight, as published in the Air Almanac, converted to local time.
Non-Standard Formation—Operations under any of the following conditions:
       a. When the flight leader has requested and ATC has approved other than standard
       formation dimensions (≤1 NM lateral separation or ≤ 100 ft. vertical separation).
       b. When operating within an authorized altitude reservation (ALTRV) or under the
       provisions of a letter of agreement.
       c. When operations are conducted in airspace specifically designed for a special activity.
Obstacle Climb Gradient—FLIP products often provide different climb gradients, ATC and
Obstacle. Only the obstacle climb gradient need be considered for OEI (if applicable) IFR
departure planning. If no obstacle climb gradient is published, the aircraft must achieve a
minimum climb gradient of 200 ft/NM (or as specified in paragraph 8.12.6.), OEI (if
applicable), on all IFR departures. VFR departures must meet or exceed only any published
gradient, OEI (if applicable), to an appropriate VFR cruise altitude or a MIA.
 96                                            AFI11-202V3_AFMCSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2011


One Engine Inoperative—Multi-engine aircraft are typically certified as airworthy after
demonstrating satisfactory control authority and climb capability after suffering the loss of one
engine at the most critical moment on takeoff. USAF multi-engine aircraft must be operated so
the aircraft is capable of experiencing such an event and still vertically clear all departure path
obstacles (even at night or while IMC). Therefore, using civilian ―see and avoid‖ rules is
prohibited, unless specifically authorized by the MAJCOM/CC or as published in a Special
MAJCOM Certification procedure.
Operations Supervisor—This term is officially defined in AFI 11-418. MAJCOMS for which
that AFI does not apply (AFSOC/AMC/AFRC) should use an equivalent-level mission execution
authority position as the operations supervisor.
OROCA—An off-route altitude which provides obstruction clearance with a 1,000 ft. buffer in
non-mountainous terrain areas and a 2,000 ft. buffer in designated mountainous areas within the
United States. This altitude may not provide signal coverage from ground-based navigational
aids, air traffic control radar, or communications coverage.
ORTCA—An off-route altitude that provides terrain clearance with a 3,000 ft. buffer from
terrain. This altitude may not provide signal coverage from ground-based navigational aids, air
traffic control radar, or communications coverage. This altitude is used on en route charts
covering those areas outside the United States.
Passenger—An individual on board the aircraft who is not on the aeronautical orders IAW AFI
11-401. For the purpose of this AFI, MEPs are considered passengers.
P Airfield—Civil airport wherein permit covers use by transient military aircraft.
PANS-OPS—ICAO documents detailing specific procedures for the safety of air traffic
navigation agreed to by ICAO signatories.
Predictive RAIM (P-RAIM)—Using a standard set of algorithms, the availability of RAIM
may be determined based on the satellite coverage expected at an aircraft’s ETA. Due to terrain
masking and other factors (e.g. satellite fails after RAIM prediction made), P-RAIM does not
guarantee there will actually be sufficient satellite coverage on arrival. P-RAIM does not have
to reside in the GPS receiver. It can be provided by FAA Flight Service (US NAS only) and
other ground based RAIM algorithms.
Prevailing Visibility—The greatest horizontal visibility observed throughout at least half of the
horizon circle. It need not be continuous throughout 180 consecutive degrees.
PRM Approach—An instrument landing system (ILS) approach conducted to parallel runways
whose extended centerlines are separated by less than 4,300 ft. and the parallel runways have a
PRM system that permits simultaneous independent ILS approaches. See:
http://www.faa.gov/education_research/training/prm/.
Radar Required—This note on an instrument procedure indicates aircraft using the procedure
will be monitored by ATC radar during a particular phase of flight or throughout the entire
procedure, as applicable. Coordination with air traffic is necessary to ensure ATC capability and
agreement to provide these services before adding the note to any instrument procedure. Note:
Instrument procedures with radar requirements should be avoided whenever possible.
Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM)—RAIM is a two-step process used to
assess the integrity of the GPS signals in the receiver. First, the GPS receiver determines if five
AFI11-202V3_AFMCSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2011                                                             97


or more working satellites are above the horizon and in the proper geometry to make RAIM
available. Second, based upon the range solutions from those satellites it must determine if the
RAIM algorithm indicates a potential navigation error. Flight in some civil airspace requires
RAIM and FDE.
Reduced Lighting—External aircraft lighting that is less than that required by paragraph 5.20.
Reduced Same Runway Separation—Allows reduction of the normal ATC aircraft separation
standards during landing/touch-and-go and restricted low approach operations to increase the
airport/runway capacity.
Reduced Takeoff Runway Length Procedure—Method used by TERPS to reduce high IFR
climb gradients by shortening the available takeoff runway, thus increasing the distance to the
obstacle, spot elevation, or terrain feature. Normally printed in the IAP    section as: “…or
alternatively, w/ standard takeoff minimums and a normal 200'/NM climb gradient, takeoff must
occur no later than 2200' prior to departure end of runway.” Aircrews are NOT permitted to
compute climb gradients in this manner.
Remotely Piloted Aircraft—The aircraft portion of an unmanned aircraft system. Normally,
Group 4 and 5 unmanned aircraft are considered RPAs, and are flown by RPA Pilots.
Remote/Island Destination—In the absence of more restrictive MAJCOM guidance, pilots will
consider a remote/island destination as any aerodrome that, due to its unique geographic
location, offers no suitable alternate within two hours flying time.
Required Navigation Performance (RNP)—Prescribes the system performance necessary for
operation in a specified airspace, based on its required accuracy (RNP value). The basic
accuracy requirement for RNP-X airspace is for the aircraft to remain within X nautical miles of
the cleared position for 95% of the time in RNP airspace.
RNAV–Area Navigation—Rather than fly established airways from one ground NAVAID to
another, RNAV permits suitably equipped aircraft to operate on any desired course between
virtual waypoints.
Runway Environment—The runway environment consists of one or more of the following
elements: The approach light system (except that the pilot may not descend below 100 ft. above
the Touch Down Zone Elevation using the approach lights as a reference unless the red
termination bars or the red side row bars are also visible and identifiable), the threshold,
threshold markings or threshold lights, the runway end identifier lights, the touchdown zone
lights, the runway or runway markings, the runway lights, the visual approach slope indicator.
For more information, refer to AFMAN 11-217, Volume 1.
Runway Visual Range—The maximum distance in the direction of takeoff or landing at which
the runway, or the specified lights or markers delineating it, can be seen from a position above a
specified point on its center line at a height corresponding to the average eye-level of pilots at
touch down. This value is normally determined by instruments located alongside and about 14
ft. above the runway and calibrated with reference to the high-intensity runway lights.
Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum (RVSM)—Reduces the vertical separation between
properly equipped and certified aircraft to 1000 ft in special qualification airspace, normally
between FL290-410 inclusive.
 98                                           AFI11-202V3_AFMCSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2011


Self-Contained Approach—An arrival procedure, normally from a minimum IFR altitude, to a
runway, using only navigational equipment on board the aircraft (GPS, radar, or other sensors).
Single Medium Display—A single medium display is a Head-Up Display (HUD), Head-Down
Display (HDD), or Helmet-Mounted Display (HMD) presenting flight instrumentation on a
single display such as a HUD combiner, a ―glass‖ multifunction display, or a helmet visor.
Special Departure Procedure—A procedure designed to allow a safe takeoff for multi-engine
aircraft whose OEI climb rate would otherwise not meet the TERPS minimum climb gradient
requirement. The runway and all known obstacles along a chosen takeoff path are analyzed and
compared to the aircraft OEI takeoff and climb performance. The procedure provides a
maximum allowable takeoff gross weight for given environmental conditions that ensure vertical
and lateral obstacle clearance safety margins. The minimum allowable gross and net climb
gradients for SDPs are typically lower than TERPS standards. Unlike TERPS, the takeoff path is
selected to minimize obstacle clearance requirements and only those obstacles within the lateral
limits of the chosen flight path are considered. Pilots should understand that most SDPs allow
exactly zero feet of clearance between their aircraft and the offending obstacles, and provide no
safety factor for pilot technique, less than 100% engine thrust, etc. The term SDP encompasses
both the use of the textual obstacle data table information and the graphical departure
procedures.
Standard Formation—A formation in which no participating aircraft is more than 1 NM
horizontally and 100 feet vertically from the lead aircraft.
Stopover Flight—A flight where intermediate stops are planned en route to a final destination.
Tactical Operations—Flight operations consisting of maneuvers that are unique to the
employment of air power to: gain and maintain air superiority, prevent freedom of operation for
the enemy in the objective area, and to assist naval and ground forces in the attainment of their
objectives. Tactical operations must be specifically MAJCOM (or COCOM) defined, approved
and implemented. These operations are normally practiced only on training or exercise missions,
in a form of special use airspace or on designated training ranges or routes.
Terrain Alert Warning System (TAWS)—Generic term for any on-board system taking inputs
from terrain databases, radar altimeter, aircraft position sensors, etc. to activate a Ground
Proximity Warning System or Automatic Ground Collision Avoidance System (AGCAS).
Developed to help prevent Controlled Flight Into Terrain (CFIT) mishaps.
Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS)—An airborne system that functions
independently of the ground-based radar to provide collision avoidance protection between
suitably equipped aircraft. TCAS I provides proximity warnings to pilots in the form of traffic
advisories. TCAS II provides both traffic advisories and recommended vertical escape
maneuvers, known as resolution advisories.
AFI11-202V3_AFMCSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2011                                                             99


Terminal Area Operations—Terminal area operations are normally those flight phases
conducted within 30 NM of an airfield of intended departure or landing, or those operations on
charted Standard Instrument Departures, on charted Standard Terminal Arrivals (STARs), or
other flight operations between the last enroute fix/waypoint and an initial approach
fix/waypoint.
Unmanned Aircraft System—A control station, one or more unmanned aircraft, control and
payload datalinks, and mission payloads, designed or modified not to carry a human pilot and
operated through remote or self-contained autonomous control. A UAS must meet all applicable
requirements of a manned aircraft, unless specifically exempted. The term RPA is specific to the
Remotely Piloted Aircraft (the flying portion of the UAS).
Unmonitored Navigational Aid—Most NAVAIDs have internal monitoring systems that
provide automatic shutdown or notification when a malfunction occurs. Unmonitored
NAVAIDs lack the ability to immediately notify ATC when a malfunction occurs. The pilot
may still use the NAVAID for all types of navigation, including instrument approaches, but must
monitor the NAVAID for a loss of identification since no prior warning of operation may be
available from ATC.
Visual Meteorological Conditions—Meteorological conditions in which visual flight rules may
be used; expressed in terms of visibility, ceiling height, and aircraft clearance from clouds along
the path of flight. When these criteria do not exist, instrument meteorological conditions prevail
and instrument flight rules must be followed.
VFR-on-Top—ATC authorization for an IFR aircraft to operate in VFR conditions at any
appropriate VFR altitude (as specified in FLIP and as restricted by ATC). A pilot receiving this
authorization must comply with the VFR visibility, distance from cloud criteria, and the
minimum IFR altitudes specified in Chapters 7 and 8.
VFR- over-the-Top—VFR flight maneuver during which an aircraft on a VFR flight plan
climbs over a ceiling in VMC, maintains VMC above the clouds, then descends in VMC and
lands.
Vertical Navigation (VNAV)—A term that describes using GPS lateral and vertical guidance to
define the minimums for a GPS non-precision or precision approach.
Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS)—The U.S. implementation of Space Based
Augmentation System (SBAS), a satellite navigation system consisting of the equipment and
software which augments the GPS Standard Positioning Service (SPS).
