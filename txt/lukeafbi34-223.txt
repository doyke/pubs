   Welfare, and Recreation (MWR) Commercial Sponsorship policy.
   5.3. POs and unofficial activities/organizations may accept gifts and donations. These

   indicate that they are for a PO or an unofficial activity/organization and not the base or any
   official part of the Air Force. Donor/gift recognition may not be made publicly. Recognition

   donation/gift.

    5.5.1. Not violate U.S., Arizona, or City of Glendale city ordinances and comply with
    any applicable requirements of such laws, e.g., securing required licenses or permits,
    filing application documents and/or reports, and the like. Arizona State law requires the
    PO to have been in existence for five consecutive years and have an approved tax exempt
    status.
    5.5.2. Be for the benefit of DoD personnel or their family members. Raffles may not be
    authorized to raise money for local or national groups such as a regional or national Heart
    or Cancer Association whose funds would not benefit primarily DoD personnel or their
    family members.
       5.5.2.1. In evaluating PO raffle fundraising requests, 56 FSS/CC must consider the
       proposed use of the proceeds and may approve only those requests which serve a
       charitable, civic, or other community welfare purpose within the DoD community
       which directly benefits DoD personnel or their family members. For example,
       commanders may approve raffles when the proceeds would be used for new
       playground equipment at a child development center or new furnishings at a youth
       center; to fund scholarship programs for DoD personnel and their family members; to
       donate money to base scouting organizations; or to provide food, clothing, shelter, or
       other relief to needy DoD personnel or their families.
       5.5.2.2. Raffle requests to raise funds for purely social recreational, or entertainment
       purposes which benefit only individual PO members and/or their family members,
       such as to underwrite the cost of a weekend ski trip, a sight-seeing tour or a shopping
       excursion will not be approved.
       5.5.2.3. Request for approval to conduct raffles must identify the purpose for which
       funds are being raised and the intended beneficiaries of the proceeds. They must also
       identify how the PO will ensure the proceeds are used only for the purpose and those
       beneficiaries.
    5.5.3. Not be officially endorsed or supported except as permitted by section 3-210 and
    3-211 of the JER.
    5.5.4. Not be conducted in the workplace. With installation commander or designee
    approval, they may be conducted at public entrances and in community support facilities
    such as the lobby of the Base Exchange.
    5.5.5. Not be conducted by military members or civilian employees during their duty
    time. Military members may not conduct raffles while in uniform at any time. Air Force
    personnel may participate in PO fundraising raffles only in a purely personal, unofficial,
    volunteer capacity at authorized locations and in ways that do not imply official
    endorsement.
