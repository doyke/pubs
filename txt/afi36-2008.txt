This instruction explains how officers of the Air National Guard of the United States (ANGUS) and
United States Air Force Reserve (USAFR) enter on voluntary extended active duty (EAD). It doesn't
apply to officers applying for active duty training (ADT); volunteering for EAD in support of contingen-
cies or "code-named" operations; active duty under Title 10, United States Code (U.S.C.), Sections 265,
678, 8021, 8496, or Title 32, U.S.C., Section 708; or to graduates of Air Force Reserve Officer Training
Corps (AFROTC) for their initial tour of EAD, except for the grade in which they will be ordered to active
duty. It interfaces with Air Force Policy Directive 36-20, Accession of Air Force Military Personnel, and
implements Department of Defense (DoD) Directives 1312.2, 4 October 1989; 1312.3, 22 October 1985;
and 1320.7, 29 September 1993. Contingencies or war do not change the requirements in this instruction.
This instruction directs collecting and maintaining information subject to the Privacy Act of 1974 autho-
rized by Title 10, U.S.C., Section 8013. System of Records Notice F035 AF MP R, Application for
Appointment and Extended Active Duty Files, applies. See Attachment 1 for the Glossary of References,
Acronyms, Terms and Addresses.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This change incorporates interim change (IC) 2002-1 (Attachment 3). This change clarifies FY 2000
National Defense Authorization Act regarding Reserve officer promotions serving on Active Duty and
AF/DP policy on Reserve Officers serving on active duty under the Limited Period Recall Program. It
stipulates that officers recalled to active duty for 3 years or less remain on the Reserve Active Status List
(RASL). Officers on duty for more than 3 years meet promotions on the Active Duty List. Officers wish-
ing to remain on the RASL must have a 1-year break and return to the Reserve before performing another
3-year tour. See the last attachment of the publication, IC 2002-1, for the complete IC. A bar ( | ) indicates
revision from the previous edition.

               The HQ AFMPC/CC (or designee) approves.

9. Determining Grade for EAD Entry. Reserve officers are ordered to active duty in their Reserve
grades unless the criteria shown in Table 1. entitle them to higher grades. Determine current grade date of
rank (CGDOR) according to AFI 36-2604, Service Dates and Dates of Rank (formerly AFR 35-3).

10. Grade Restrictions. Approval of the Secretary of the Air Force is required to enter EAD at a grade
above major. EXCEPTION: HQ AFMPC/DPMM may approve EAD entry in the grade of lieutenant colo-
nel for medical officers in an approved specialty that has a staffing shortage. HQ AFMPC/DPMM gets
Senate confirmation before appointing medical officers to EAD as lieutenant colonels. Until confirmed by
the Senate, medical officers otherwise qualified for the grade of lieutenant colonel receive the grade of
major.

11. Determining Entry Grade Credit.
    11.1. Calculating Service Credit. Add the time between when an officer accepted the EAD appoint-
    ment (see AFI 36-2005) and actually started EAD to the total commissioned service.
    11.2. Adding Partial Credits. Add any partial credit according to these guidelines:
           Medical and dental officers get credit for all active commissioned time served (year-for-year).
           Chaplains get credit for active commissioned status not on EAD one-to-one up to 1 year.
           Calculate commissioned service on EAD on a year-for-year basis for officers other than chap-
           lains in Table 1. rules 7 through 10. Calculate active commissioned status other than EAD as
           1/2 year for each year.
           An officer, designated as a judge advocate or assigned as a legal officer in the Air Force Gen-
           eral Counsel's Honors Program who was appointed first lieutenant after 26 January 1982 with
           total service credit equal to at least 36 months, but less than 42 months gets additional service
           credit to equal 42 months on EAD date.

12. Passing the Physical. You must be physically fit for EAD. See the details in AFI 48-123, Medical
Examination and Medical Standards (formerly AFR 160-43).
AFI36-2008 5 NOVEMBER 2002                                                                                  7


   12.1. Applicants receive word that they must take a medical examination. The orders issuing activi-
   ties explain the entire process of what happens if they are tentatively accepted for EAD, including that
   the government will not pay for travel expenses.
   12.2. Applicants on active duty arrange for the examinations at their own installations. If they are not
   on active duty, they can take the physicals at any Air Force installation with appropriate medical facil-
   ities. If flying status is not involved, they can also take the physicals at a Military Entrance Processing
   Station (Recruiting Office), or at an Army or Navy medical facility.

13. Recalling Retired Officers to EAD.
   13.1. Permanently Retired Officers. The Air Force will not recall to EAD any officer who perma-
   nently retired for physical disability. If the officer retires for other than a physical reason, a waiver
   may occasionally be given if the Air Force needs the retiree's special skills. In such cases, the Air
   Force limits EAD to the minimum time needed to complete the specific assignment or to train another
   officer to do the job. If you are requesting this kind of waiver, include a full justification.
   13.2. Temporarily Disabled Retired Officers. Officers who were on the temporary disability
   retired list (TDRL) and are now physically able to continue military service may usually return to
   EAD. In such cases, recall depends on the needs of the Air Force when the officer becomes available.
   The Air Force usually does not recall from TDRL officers serving in a deferred promotion status.

14. Limited Period Call to EAD. Tours extended past the three-year point will move the officer to the
ADL. EAD tours of 3 years or less will keep the officer on the Reserve Active Status List (RASL). Con-
secutive LPRP tours are considered on a case-by-case basis. A request for a consecutive tour requires
reapplication and justification. Members meeting RASL eligibility who desire to stay on LPRP by volun-
teering for subsequent tours, move to the ADL or can return to the ANG/AFR for a minimum of 1 year
prior to returning to an LPRP tour to remain RASL eligible.

Section D—Application Procedures and EAD Orders

15. Documenting EAD Applications.
   15.1. All Applicants. Complete two copies of AF Form 125 and attach all documents to it. If you
   changed your name (through marriage, court order, etc.), include whatever documents prove the
   change. ( EXCEPTION: Apply for direct EAD appointment with immediate entry on AF Form 24,
   Application for Appointment as Reserves of the Air Force or USAF Without Component (AFI
   36-2005).
   15.2. Chaplains. Forward a letter to HQ USAF/HCS (Chief of Chaplains, Chaplain Support Ele-
   ment) from the appropriate ecclesiastical endorsing agency approving your entry to EAD.
   15.3. Judge Advocate General (JAG) Applicants. Include documents that prove you have been
   admitted to practice law before the bar of a federal court or the highest court of a state in addition to
   all documents required by AFI 51-101, Judge Advocate Accession Program (formerly AFR 36-7).
   15.4. LAF Officers. Include a brief biography summarizing your military service including active,
   ANGUS, and USAFR. Attach a resume detailing all periods of employment and unemployment since
   your release from EAD.

rescinds, or revokes EAD orders. Refer to Attachment 2 .

17. Withdrawing From, Declining, or Postponing EAD.
    17.1. Declining EAD. If you volunteer for EAD but change your mind, you can decline EAD without
    penalty anytime before you actually are selected, if you are not obligated to serve on EAD.
       17.1.1. Declining During the Grace Period. You have 14 calendar days (grace period) after you
       are selected for EAD to accept or decline it. If you decline it during that period, you accrue no pen-
       alty except that you may be denied EAD for one year from that date.
       17.1.2. Declining or Withdrawing for Other Reasons. If you did not decline during the 14-day
       grace period (see paragraph 17.1.1.), you may not withdraw your application subsequently except
       for extreme personal hardship that did not exist during the 14-day grace period. If the approving
       authority believes that your hardship is valid, they may postpone or cancel your EAD. CAUTION:
       If you try to withdraw from EAD and can't prove extreme personal hardship, you may be dis-
       charged under AFI 36-3209, Separation Procedures for Air Force Reserve Members (formerly
       AFR 35-41).
    17.2. Postponing EAD. You can defer your EAD entry date or withdraw your application without
    penalty if you are on an approved promotion list with an effective date of promotion after the sched-
    uled EAD date.

          IC 2002-1 TO AFI 36-2008, VOLUNTARY EXTENDED ACTIVE DUTY (EAD)
                      FOR AIR RESERVE COMMISSIONED OFFICERS


5 NOVEMBER 2002


SUMMARY OF REVISIONS


This change incorporates interim change (IC) 2002-1 (Attachment 3). This change clarifies FY 2000
National Defense Authorization Act regarding Reserve officer promotions serving on Active Duty and
AF/DP policy on Reserve Officers serving on active duty under the Limited Period Recall Program. It
stipulates that officers recalled to active duty for 3 years or less remain on the Reserve Active Status List
(RASL). Officers on duty for more than 3 years meet promotions on the Active Duty List. Officers wish-
ing to remain on the RASL must have a 1-year break and return to the Reserve before performing another
3-year tour. See the last attachment of the publication, IC 2002-1, for the complete IC. A bar (/) indicates
revision from the previous edition.

Certified by: HQ AFPC/DPP (Col Dale M. Vande Hey)


14. Limited Period Call to EAD. Tours extended past the three-year point will move the officer to the
ADL. EAD tours of 3 years or less will keep the officer on the Reserve Active Status List (RASL). Con-
secutive LPRP tours are considered on a case-by-case basis. A request for a consecutive tour requires
reapplication and justification. Members meeting RASL eligibility who desire to stay on LPRP by volun-
teering for subsequent tours, move to the ADL or can return to the ANG/AFR for a minimum of 1 year
prior to returning to an LPRP tour to remain RASL eligible.
