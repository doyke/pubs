1. Overview. DoDI 4150.07, DoD Pest Management Program, directs the Secretary of the Air
Force to “…maintain a large-area, fixed-wing, aerial pesticide application capability, including
specially trained air and ground crews, to control disease vectors, pest organisms, and vegetation,
and to treat oil spills in combat areas, on DoD installations, or in response to declared

emergencies.” This aerial application capability has been assigned to AFRC’s 910 Airlift Wing
at Youngstown ARS, Ohio. Due to the highly specialized nature of the Aerial Spray mission and
its exclusive execution by 910 AW, this Air Force Reserve Command Instruction (AFRCI) has
been developed and implemented to ensure continued AFRC oversight.
2. HQ AFRC Aerial Spray Board. The HQ AFRC Aerial Spray Board (ASB) is hereby
established under the commander’s authority to organize and employ assigned forces to support
wartime requirements and perform those peacetime requirements compatible with mobilization
readiness.
     2.1. Organization.

        2.1.2. Ancillary members. A3T, A3V, A4M, FMA, A5XW, SGP, SE and PA.
     2.2. Purpose. The purpose of the ASB is as follows:
        2.2.1. To analyze the wartime and peacetime requirements for the aerial application of
        insecticides, herbicides and oil dispersants;
        2.2.2. To recommend policies, procedures, standards, employment tactics and training
        requirements to safely and effectively execute the Aerial Spray mission as well as actions
        necessary to sustain or modernize the Modular Aerial Spray System (MASS) and/or
        spray-specific aircraft systems;

       following presidential declaration of an emergency are operational missions conducted
       under the OPCON of the geographic CCDR, viz., US Northern Command
       (USNORTHCOM), US Pacific Command (USPACOM) or US Southern Command
       (USSOUTHCOM); and

       under the ADCON of HQ AFRC;
   3.2.2. An Aerial Spray Mission Commander will be delegated for all training missions.
4. Aerial Spray Mission Sets. The mission of the 910 AW Aerial Spray Unit is to aerially
apply insecticides, herbicides and oil dispersants in combat areas, on federal installations or in
other areas. The request and approval process for each mission set can be found in AFI 32-1074,
Aerial Application of Pesticides. They are as follows:
   4.1. Contingency Areas. Insecticides and oil dispersants may be applied in combat areas
   IAW published Operations Plans (OPLANs) and Execute Orders (EXORDs). Herbicides
   may only be applied in combat areas when specifically approved by the president IAW
   Executive Order 11850.
   4.2. Declared Emergencies.
       4.2.1. Following presidential declaration of an emergency, insecticides and oil
       dispersants may be applied within the United States, its territories and possessions as
       Defense Support of Civil Authorities (DSCA) operations to mitigate the public health or
       economic effects of a natural or man-made disaster IAW the Stafford Disaster Relief and
 4                                                               AFRCI11-1074 14 APRIL 2014


        Emergency Assistance Act (Stafford Act), 42 U.S.C. §§ 5121-5207 and The Economy
        Act, 31 U.S.C. 1535.
        4.2.2. Following an emergency in non-U.S. territories, insecticides and oil dispersants
        may be applied at the request of the host nation as directed in DoDD 5100.46, Foreign
        Disaster Relief.
     4.3. Federal Installations. Insecticides and herbicides may be applied on federal installations
     to prevent or control pests and disease vectors that may adversely impact readiness or
     military operations by affecting the health of personnel, or by damaging structures, materiel,
     or property IAW DoDI 4150.07. Two types of federal mission sets exist; emergency and
     routine. In order for a federal project to be considered as a routine training opportunity, an
     Aerial Application of Pesticides Statement of Need must be submitted in addition to
     environmental impact issues addressed.
5. Aerial Spray Training Missions. Aerial Spray training missions fall into one of four
categories based on the authority under which the mission is conducted and whether pesticides or
water is being applied.
     5.1. Federal installations. Pesticides may be applied on Federal installations IAW AFI 32-
     1053, Integrated Pest Management Program and AFI 32-1074, Aerial Application of
     Pesticides.
     5.2. Innovative Readiness Training (IRT). Pesticides may be applied in addressing
     community and civic needs of the United States, its territories and possessions, and the
     Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, when such assistance is incidental to military training under
     the provisions of DoDD 1100.20, Support and Services for Eligible Organizations and
     Activities Outside the DoD, and AFI 36-2250, Civil-Military Innovative Readiness Training.
     5.3. Water. Training missions during which water is sprayed from a chemically
     uncontaminated spray system will be accomplished on federal property or over bodies of
     water large enough to adequately train for oil dispersal. Exceptions to the locations
     previously mentioned will be considered by AFRC/A3O on a case by case basis and only in
     support of scientific or public health communities. Training may be accomplished without
     the MASS or water loaded on the aircraft when taking place in cold weather environments
     where temperature prohibits the employment of water. The same location limitations
     previously stated within this paragraph apply.
     5.4. Testing. The 910 AW is tasked with operational testing of new pesticides, equipment,
     and techniques for aerial applications. Testing will be conducted on federal property.
     Exceptions will be considered by AFRC/A3O.
6. Approval of Aerial Spray Training Missions. Approval of Aerial Spray training missions
during which material other than water will be dispensed from the MASS consists of project
validation by the ASB and mission approval by the HQ AFRC Force Generation Center (FGC).
     6.1. Project validation.
        6.1.1. Federal Installations. Requests to apply pesticides as part of a federal installations
        integrated pest management program will contain the information and comply with the
        requirements prescribed AFI 32-1074, Aerial Application of Pesticides. When satisfied
AFRCI11-1074 14 APRIL 2014                                                                    5


       that the information and compliance requirements have been met, the ASB will validate
       the project.
       6.1.2. Non-DoD property. Requests to apply pesticides IAW the IRT program will
       contain the information and comply with the requirements prescribed in AFI 36-2250,
       Civil-Military Innovative Readiness Training. When satisfied that the information and
       compliance requirements have been met per IRT guidance, to include project approval by
       Secretary of the Air Force – Reserve Affairs (SAF/MRR), the ASB will validate the
       project.
   6.2. Mission approval. Prior to approving an Aerial Spray mission request in Single
   Mobility System (SMS), the FGC will confirm the spray project has been validated by the
   ASB. Project validation will be annotated in the remarks section of the SMS request.

Operational Control (OPCON)—Command authority that may be exercised by commanders at
any echelon at or below the level of combatant command. Operational control is inherent in
combatant command and may be delegated within the command. Operational control is the
authority to perform those functions of command over subordinate forces involving organizing
and employing commands and forces, assigning tasks, designating objectives, and giving
authoritative direction necessary to accomplish the mission. Operational control includes
authoritative direction over all aspects of military operations and joint training necessary to
accomplish missions assigned to the command. Operational control should be exercised through
the commanders of subordinate organizations. Normally this authority is exercised through
subordinate joint force commanders and Service and/or functional component commanders.
Operational control normally provides full authority to organize commands and forces and to
employ those forces as the commander in operational control considers necessary to accomplish
assigned missions; it does not, in and of itself, include authoritative direction for logistics or
matters of administration, discipline, internal organization, or unit training. (JP 1)
