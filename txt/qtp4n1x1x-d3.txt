                                             INTRODUCTION

1. This qualification training package (QTP) was developed to make a training aid available that will assist
Otolaryngology Surgical Technicians to develop technical skills essential to performing specialized tasks.
The tasks are broken down into teachable elements that help the trainer guide the trainee into becoming
proficient with the task. The QTP will also aid the task certifier when evaluating trainees for task
certification.

2. As a trainer, go through each module (lesson) and identify which QTP tasks are appropriate for the
trainee’s duty position, and then determine the order in which you want the trainee to learn about each
subject area. Direct the trainee to review the training references to better understand the objective of each
module. Go through the steps in the task performance with the trainee and allow for enough time to learn
each step; some objectives may take more time than others. Remember, the objective of the QTP is to
ensure the trainee can perform each task thoroughly. When the trainee receives enough training and is
ready to be evaluated on an objective, follow the evaluation instructions. Use the performance checklist as
you evaluate each objective. If the trainee successfully accomplishes the objective, document appropriately
in the individual’s training record. If the trainee does not accomplish the objective, review the areas
needing more training until the objective is met. Conduct a feedback with the trainee on each module.
After the trainer has ensured and documented that the trainee is qualified to perform the task, a certifier
should evaluate the trainee.

3. The goal of the developers of this QTP is to publish a useful document for trainers and trainees that will
meet Air Force needs under the concepts outlined in the Career Field Education and Training Plan
(CFETP). We value your expertise in meeting this goal. If you find discrepancies in this QTP, or have
suggestions for its improvement, or if you have suggestions for other areas that may benefit from a QTP,
please let us know about them. The subject-matter-expert for writing and developing this QTP was:

OBJECTIVE:                                   In a clinical setting, perform suture removal.

REMARKS/NOTES:                               There are various methods of suturing. Skin
                                             sutures can be broadly categorized as either
                                             interrupted (each stitch is tied and knotted
                                             separately) or continuous (one thread runs
                                             in a series of stitches and is tied only at the
                                             beginning and at the end of the run). Ensure
                                             trainee is familiar with each technique.

EVALUATION INSTRUCTIONS:

1. This QTP should be evaluated during actual performance of the tasks.

2. Since this task involves direct patient care, ensure the trainee understands the process, knows inherent
risk factors, and is closely supervised during the evaluation. The evaluator will STOP the procedure
immediately and correct the trainee if performance may compromise patient safety. Ensure the trainee
dons all personal protective equipment (PPE) required by current standards/precautions.

3. The trainee must satisfactorily perform all parts of the task with 100% accuracy, without assistance.

4. Use the appropriate checklist when evaluating the task to ensure all steps of the task are accomplished.

5. Document competency upon satisfactory completion of the evaluation. Initial evaluation should be
documented in the Specialty Training Standard (STS) of the trainee’s CFETP. All recurring evaluation
should be documented using AF Form 1098, Special Task Certification and Recurring Training, or using
an approved substitute record.

REMARKS/NOTES:                              There are several different types of drains used.
                                            two most common are the Penrose drain (has
                                            an open end that drains onto a dressing) and a
                                            closed drainage system (a drain connected to either
                                            an electric suction or a portable drainage suction.
                                            Ensure trainee is familiar with each technique.

REMARKS/NOTES:                                     Removing Internal nasal splints can cause a patient to feel
                                                      light headed, nauseous, and sometimes cause
                                                      fainting. Ensure trainee is familiar with procedures
                                                      regarding these complications.

EVALUATION INSTRUCTIONS:

1. This QTP should be evaluated during actual performance of the tasks.

2. Since this task involves direct patient care, ensure the trainee understands the process, knows inherent
risk factors, and is closely supervised during the evaluation. The evaluator will STOP the procedure
immediately and correct the trainee if performance may compromise patient safety. Ensure the trainee
dons all personal protective equipment (PPE) required by current standards/precautions.

3. The trainee must satisfactorily perform all parts of the task without assistance.

4. Use the appropriate checklist when evaluating the task to ensure all steps of the task are accomplished.

5. Document competency upon satisfactory completion of the evaluation. Initial evaluation should be
documented in the Specialty Training Standard (STS) of the trainee’s CFETP. All recurring evaluation
should be documented using AF Form 1098, Special Task Certification and Recurring Training, or using
an approved substitute record.

EVALUATION INSTRUCTIONS:

1. This QTP should be evaluated during actual performance of the tasks.

2. Since this task involves direct patient care, ensure the trainee understands the process, knows inherent
risk factors, and is closely supervised during the evaluation. The evaluator will STOP the procedure
immediately and correct the trainee if performance may compromise patient safety. Ensure the trainee
dons all personal protective equipment (PPE) required by current standards/precautions.

3. The trainee must satisfactorily perform all parts of the task without assistance.

4. Use the appropriate checklist when evaluating the task to ensure all steps of the task are accomplished.

5. Document competency upon satisfactory completion of the evaluation. Initial evaluation should be
documented in the Specialty Training Standard (STS) of the trainee’s CFETP. All recurring evaluation
should be documented using AF Form 1098, Special Task Certification and Recurring Training, or using
an approved substitute record.
