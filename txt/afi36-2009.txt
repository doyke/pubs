SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This change updates privacy information statement, office symbols, OPR, certifying official,
DCS/Manpower and Personnel, and makes small administrative changes. A margin bar ( | )
indicates newly revised material.
1. Special Instructions Regarding Delays :
     1.1. Educational Delays. The Air Force approves educational delays based upon Air Force
     needs, provided the delay does not preclude an officer from entering Extended Active Duty
     (EAD) before the officer’s 35th birthday.
        1.1.1. Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) classifications are projected against valid
        authorizations and are directly related to an individual’s advanced degree. Should Air
        Force needs change, an approved educational delay does not assure assignment to duties
        in or related to the individual's academic specialty.
     1.2. Immediate EAD. AFPC/DPSIP may terminate delays at any time and order officers to
     immediate EAD, if Air Force requirements so dictate.
        1.2.1. An approved delay does not relieve an officer from fulfilling their contractual
        agreement (AF Form 1056, Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps Contract).
        This includes serving on EAD when the person completes the delay, or sooner, if the Air
        Force orders it.
        1.2.2. AFROTC cadets enrolled as pilots or navigators are not eligible to apply for
        educational delays unless they seek an advanced degree in the legal (5YYY) or medical
        (7YYY) academic areas.
        1.2.3. AFPC/DPSIP withdraws AFROTC commissioning categories on pilots,
        navigators, or missile launch officer candidates who accept entry into the legal or medical
        advanced degree academic areas.
        1.2.4. When the Air Force disenrolls a person from an advanced degree program, it does
        not reinstate their previous commissioning categories.
     1.3. Unauthorized Delays. Delays are not granted to pursue less than a full-time course of
     instruction, study theology, work in the Peace Corps, accept civilian employment for
     hardship, obtain a second degree at the same academic level, or attend other than an
     accredited educational institution as defined in Attachment 1.
     1.4. Periods of Delay. See Table 1 (Delays Granted and Maximum Delay Periods) for the
     periods of delay.
     1.5. Involuntarily Terminating Delays. The Dean, Civilian Institutions Programs, AFIT, has
     the authority to terminate delays for failure to maintain acceptable academic or retention
     standards, or failure to comply with AFIT requirements.
        1.5.1. Reasons for involuntarily terminating delays include but are not limited to:
AFI36-2009 1 JUNE 1999                                                                        3

          1.5.1.5. Failure to obtain approval before changing graduate schools.
   1.6. Physical Qualifications. Officers must continue to meet the physical qualifications
   outlined in AFI 48-123, Medical Examinations and Standards, and have a current medical
   examination in order to qualify for EAD upon completing the delay.
      1.6.1. Requests for medical waivers will be submitted to Air Force Personnel Center,
      Directorate of Assignments, Medical Service Officer Management Division, Medical
      Standards Branch (AFPC/DPAMM) 550 C Street West, Suite 25, Randolph AFB TX,
      78150-4727.
      1.6.2. The Air Force orders an officer who fails to voluntarily complete a medical
      examination to a special active duty training tour of 15 calendar days to complete the
      medical examination. This period is for diagnostic purposes only and is not to correct
      disqualifying defects. The Air Force orders officers found physically qualified to EAD.
      1.6.3. An officer who develops a potentially disqualifying medical condition while on an
      educational delay must report the condition to AFIT/CIGD within 7 workdays from date

   detachment or Air Force base for a Reserve identification card (DD Form 2 Air Force
   Reserve (AFRES), Armed Forces of the United States Identification Card). The card
   includes unlimited base exchange privileges, but does not allow commissary privileges.

        licensing requirements (pass the bar examination and be admitted to the practice of
        law before the highest court of a state or Federal Court). Officers who do not complete
        legal licensing requirements perform other than judge advocate duties if called to EAD.

NOTES:
  1. Applicants for doctorate degrees who bypass a master’s degree program must provide a
     complete explanation. The explanation must include the estimated completion date.
     Applicants must clearly state their desires on the bypassed master’s program in case
AFI36-2009 1 JUNE 1999                                                                      13


      the doctorate program is denied. When no master’s program is offered, a confirming
      statement from a school official is required.
   2. Applicants may submit applications before graduate school acceptance only if final
      acceptance has not been received by the submission cutoff date. However, the
      application must include evidence that the applicant has been conditionally accepted for
      graduate school. If conditional acceptance has not been received, evidence that the
      applicant has made formal application must be included. Once formal acceptance
      notification is received, the applicant must promptly send the notification to
      AFIT/CIGD. After notification of graduate school acceptance, it is the responsibility of
      the student to notify AFIT/CGID of any changes to their school of acceptance.
      Failure to notify AFIT/CIGD may result in a delay of their processing.
   3. If the applicant cannot get a completed plan by the cutoff date for sending in the delay
      application, he or she must send a tentative plan or a detailed narrative description of
      the specialized study area the applicant intends to seek. The education plan must
      show enrollment in the first class beginning after appointment (summer enrollment is
      encouraged but not required).
   4. Applicants contact HQ USAF/JAX for an Air Force Lawyer Information Guide and
      interview forms to take with them on the SJA interview. Call toll-free 1-800-524-8723
      (1-800-JAG-USAF) to request the documents. The SJA submits the results of the
      interview directly to HQ USAF/ JAX.

1st Ind, AFROTC Cadet         (name)                                          (date)


TO: AFROTC Detachment


I understand that all cadets who formally indicate an intent to apply for an educational delay are
removed from the normal active duty assignment cycle. I also understand that if my
application for an educational delay does not reach AFIT/CIGD within 90 calendar days
before my projected date of commissioning, I automatically will be placed in the active duty
assignment cycle, and my name will be forwarded to HQ AFPC/DPPAO for active duty
assignment processing. If I decide not to accept an educational delay or if I fail to gain
acceptance to graduate school, I must notify the detachment commander of such change in my
educational delay status at the earliest possible time. I further understand that a change in status
made less than 5 months before my projected date of commissioning may result in a delay in
my accession to extended active duty. My educational delay status is (check one):
   I have decided that I do not desire an educational delay.
   I still wish to apply for an educational delay.
