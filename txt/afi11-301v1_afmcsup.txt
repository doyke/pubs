                   AFMC AFE QUALITY CONTROL (QC) PROGRAM

A3.1. (Added) General. The AFMC AFE QC program is a supplement to guidance previously
provided in this AFI. It encompasses most QC activity for the AFE program and ensures all
equipment and vital programs are adequately inspected. This ensures only the highest quality
equipment is provided to each aircrew member. As required, each unit will supplement these
guidelines to develop a viable quality control program that will assess, analyze, identify, and
address problem areas that may exist. Utilize this program to measure technician competence,
equipment serviceability, and overall program integrity.
   A3.1.1. (Added) Daily QCIs:
   NOTE: All required QCIs should be accomplished prior to being placed into service.
       A3.1.1.1. (Added) Daily QCIs will be performed on 100% of repack and/or functional
       inspections on the following items: Personnel recovery, drogue & cargo chutes, drag
       deceleration devices, restraint devices, survival kits, life preservers and life rafts. In
       addition, all equipment initial build-ups will receive a QCI prior to entering into service.
          A3.1.1.1.1. (Added) At a minimum, the survival kit QCI will include the following:
          component inspection, raft hook up and torque, and kit closure.
       A3.1.1.2. (Added) AFE items/periodic inspections not listed in paragraph A3.1.1.1. will
       receive a 25% daily QCI. All equipment should receive a QCI inspection over a 12-
       month period.
       A3.1.1.3. (Added) All items received from outside support agencies will receive 100%
       QCI. These agencies include, but are not limited to: TMDE, medical supply, and
       munitions.
       A3.1.1.4. (Added) QCIs will be performed on 100% of all 3-skill level work until the
       individual is task certified.
A3.2. (Added) Documentation of QCI. Upon completion of the inspection, the inspector will
document QCIs and ensure all pertinent information is gathered. The form will include, as a
minimum, the following information.
   A3.2.1. (Added) Item/equipment type, local control number, name of item inspector, date
   of QCI, discrepancy (if noted), name of QC inspector, and a suspense date for corrective
   action. Also, include areas for corrective action (EXAMPLE: Page and paragraph from
   T.O., date corrected, and initials of person correcting the discrepancy).
A3.3. (Added) Section NCOICs or assistants will conduct monthly training sessions on
negative trends identified from the QCI process. Trend analysis and resulting training or
corrective action will be documented and reported to AFES.
A3.4. (Added) Classification/Definitions of Discrepancies.
   A3.4.1. (Added) A major finding is defined as a condition that would endanger personnel,
   jeopardize equipment or system reliability, and affect safety of flight or warrant
   discontinuing the process or equipment operation.
AFI11-301V1_AFMCSUP 14 NOVEMBER 2011                                                          33


  A3.4.2. (Added) A minor finding is defined as an unsatisfactory condition that requires
  repair or correction, but does not endanger personnel, affect safety of flight, jeopardize
  equipment reliability, or warrant discontinuing a process or equipment operation. A minor
  discrepancy is one that will not affect the operation of the equipment but causes the
  equipment from being 100% compliant with current directives.
  A3.4.3. (Added) Units are authorized to track what is known as an administrative finding.
  An administrative finding is a documentation error that was overlooked that identifies critical
  information but has no effect on the operational process or use of the item.
