This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 36-30, Military Entitlements. It
provides guidance for 439th Airlift Wing (439 AW) Post Deployment Downtime in accordance
with Air Mobility Command Instruction (AMCI) 10-403, Air Mobility Command (AMC) Force
Deployment and use of military leave in accordance with AFI 36-3003, Military Leave Program.
The 439 AW continues to experience high Operations Temp (OPTEMPO) and while it is
important to remember that the wing’s support of on-going missions is our first priority, it is also
important to maintain the health and well being of our members by providing leave, passes, and
downtime as appropriate. This publication applies to all airmen assigned to the 439 AW while
performing active duty. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this
publication are maintained in accordance with AFMAN 33-363, Management of Records, and
disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at
https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61a/afrims/afrims/. Refer recommended changes and questions
about this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF Form 847,
Recommendation for Change of Publication; route AF Form 847 to 439 MSS/DPM, 100
Starlifter Avenue, Box 65, Westover ARB, MA 01022-1818.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This interim change revises the 439 AWI 36-3003 to coincide with AFI 36-3003 and AFRC/CV
memorandum guidance for regular and special passes. It also changes the allowable travel time
to eight hours from five. It removes all guidance on post-deployment downtime which is covered
in DODI 1327.06, AFI 10-402 and AFI 36-3003.

1. DELETED
2. Regular and Special Passes.
     2.1. It is imperative that all commanders comply with AFI 36-3003 when granting leave and
     passes to AGR, mobilized and non-mobilized Reserve members to ensure that Airmen are in
     an appropriate duty status in case of an emergency, injury, or death.
     2.2. A pass period is an authorized absence from duty for a relatively short time. Members
     must be able to return to Westover ARB within eight hours if recalled from their pass due to
     operational mission requirements; however, mileage restrictions do not apply. If members are
     traveling to a location that would not allow them to return to Westover ARB within eight
     hours, they should be in an ordinary leave status (chargeable leave). Airmen traveling to
     Canada or any other foreign country must be in a leave status regardless of the traveling time.
     2.3. There are two types of passes:
        2.3.1. Regular Pass—(liberty, aka, scheduled days off) starts after normal working hours
        on a given day and stops at the beginning of normal working hours on the next working
        day.
        2.3.2. Special Pass—unit commanders may award a 3 or 4 day special pass for special
        occasions or circumstances, such as reenlistment or for some type of special recognition
        or compensatory time off. Special passes should not be used on a regular basis in lieu of
        ordinary (chargeable) leave.
