(ANG) This Supplement clarifies OPSEC program requirements for all echelons of ANG units
no matter the gaining MAJCOM, with the basic tenant being that all ANG units/personnel, at all
levels of command, must plan and implement the OPSEC process. It specifies host-tenant
relationships and MOA requirements for specifying details of their working relationships and
mutual OPSEC supporting activities. Responsibilities for the Commander, Program Manager,
Signature Management Officer’s, OPSEC coordinators are defined/clarified to ensure effective
OPSEC program implementation, management, and execution. OPSEC products are required to
ensure the full process is executed. Following the addition of Signature Management (SM) in
AFI 10-701, this supplement integrates SM guidance and provides SM templates for
standardization across the ANG.

Management and OPSEC Process has been moved to Chapter 4. OPSEC measures have been
deleted from chapter 4 and are now reflected to read countermeasures (paragraph 4.6).
Acquisition planning has been removed from chapter 3, OPSEC Planning and placed within
chapter 8, OPSEC Contract Requirements. OPSEC Awareness Education and Training has been
moved to chapter 5, OPSEC Education and Training, and includes requirement to provide
awareness information to AF family members. OPSEC assessments has been moved to chapter
6 and titled Assessments. Additions to chapter 6 include web site link to the OPSEC Core
Capabilities Checklists (paragraph 6.1.5), requirements regarding the assessment of information
on AF public and private web sites (paragraph 6.5), and requirement to utilize the operations
security collaborations architecture (OSCAR) tool for annual assessments (paragraph 6.6.4). Air
Force OPSEC annual awards is located in chapter 7 and chapter 8 includes information regarding
OPSEC as a requirement within government contracts.

                                           Chapter 1

                                          GENERAL

1.1. Introduction: OPSEC is a military capability within Information Operations (IO). IO is
the integrated employment of three operational elements: influence operations (IFO), electronic
warfare operations and network warfare operations. IO aims to influence, disrupt, corrupt, or
usurp adversarial human or automated decision-making while protecting our own. IFO employs
the military capabilities of military information support operations (MISO), OPSEC, military
deception (MILDEC), counterintelligence operations, public affairs (PA) operations and
counterpropaganda operations to affect behaviors, protect operations, communicate
commanders’ intent and project accurate information to achieve desired effects across the
operational environment. OPSEC’s desired effect is to influence the adversary’s behavior and
actions by protecting friendly operations and activities.
1.2. Operational Context:
     1.2.1. Operational Focus. The OPSEC program is an operations function or activity and its
     goals are information superiority and optimal mission effectiveness. The emphasis is on
     OPERATIONS and the assurance of effective mission accomplishment. To ensure effective
     implementation across organizational and functional lines the organization’s OPSEC
     Program Manager (PM), Signature Management Officer (SMO), or coordinator will reside in
     the operations and/or plans element of an organization or report directly to the commander.
     For those organizations with no traditional operations or plans element, the commander must
     decide the most logical area to place management and coordination of the organization’s
     OPSEC program while focusing on operations and the mission of the organization. Figure
     1.2 illustrates the AF OPSEC functional structure.

Figure 1.1. OPSEC Functional Structure.
AFI10-701_ANGSUP 3 APRIL 2014                                                                    7


   1.2.2. Operational effectiveness is enhanced when commanders and other decision-makers
   apply OPSEC from the earliest stages of planning. OPSEC involves a series of analyses to
   examine the planning, preparation, execution and post execution phases of any operation or
   activity across the entire spectrum of military action and in any operational environment.
   OPSEC analysis provides decision-makers with a means of weighing how much risk they
   are willing to accept in particular operational circumstances in the same way as operations
   risk management allows commanders to assess risk in mission planning.
   1.2.3. OPSEC must be closely integrated and synchronized with other IFO capabilities,
   security disciplines, and all aspects of protected operations (see references listed in
   Attachment 1).
1.3. Purpose:
   1.3.1. The purpose of OPSEC is to reduce the vulnerability of Air Force missions by
   eliminating or reducing successful adversary collection and exploitation of critical
   information. OPSEC applies to all activities that prepare, sustain, or employ forces during all
   phases of operations.
   1.3.2. OPSEC Definition. OPSEC is a process of identifying, analyzing and controlling
   critical information indicating friendly actions associated with military operations and other
   activities to:
       1.3.2.1. Identify those actions that can be observed by adversary intelligence systems.
       1.3.2.2. Determine what specific indications could be collected, analyzed, and
       interpreted to derive critical information in time to be useful to adversaries.
       1.3.2.3. Select and execute measures that eliminate or reduce to an acceptable level the
       vulnerabilities of friendly actions to adversary exploitation.
1.4. Roles and Responsibilities:
   1.4.1. Air Force organizations must develop and integrate OPSEC into their mission
   planning to ensure critical information and indicators are identified. At a minimum, the Air
   Force will integrate OPSEC into the following missions: military strategy, operational and
   tactical planning and execution, military indoctrination, support activities, contingency,
   combat and peacetime operations and exercises, communications-computer architectures and
   processing, critical infrastructure protection, weapons systems, Research, Development, Test
   and Evaluation (RDT&E), Air Force specialized training, inspections, acquisition and
   procurement, medical operations and professional military education. Although the OPSEC
   program helps commanders make and implement decisions, the decisions are the
   commander’s responsibility. Commanders must understand the risk to the mission and then
   determine which countermeasures are required.
   1.4.2. The Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations, Plans and Requirements
   (AF/A3/5). The AF/A3/5 is the OPR for implementing DoD OPSEC policy and guidance.
   This responsibility is assigned to the Director of Cyber and Space Operations (AF/A3Z).
   AF/A3Z will:
       1.4.2.1. Establish an AF OPSEC program focused on senior leadership involvement
       using the management tools of assessments, surveys, training, education, threat analyses,
       resourcing, and awareness that, at a minimum, includes:
8                                                         AFI10-701_ANGSUP 3 APRIL 2014


          1.4.2.1.1. Assign a full-time AF OPSEC PM (O-4 or civilian equivalent).
          1.4.2.1.2. Establish AF OPSEC support capabilities that provide for program
          development, planning, training, assessment, surveys, operational support, and
          readiness training.

  the guidance found in paragraph 2.2 All units within the ANG will have an OPSEC
  program. Appointment letters will clearly state to which organization(s) the program
  manager is appointed. (See Attachment 3: Signature Management Officer Appointment
  Letter Template; and Attachment 4: OPSEC Coordinator Appointment Letter
  Template for NGB HQ Air Directorates and below wing level.) For installations with
  multiple units, all wing and above commanders, and geographically separated Group
  commanders will have their own OPSEC program that is tailored to their mission in addition
  to participating in the installation OPSEC process led by the host unit. This is especially
  important for those units that deploy separately from the host unit. (T-3)

     and to maximize training investments. It is highly recommended that commanders
     appoint full-time guard members, e.g. AGR or Title 5 Civilians as primary and alternate
     OPSEC PMs/SMOs due to amount of time required to administer the SM program.
     Additionally, because of the time required to build and maintain this program as an
     additional duty, it is highly recommended to limit the number of additional duties OPSEC
     PMs/SMOs have. Unit commander endorsed waiver requests will be submitted to
     ANG/A3CC for consideration. (see Attachment 5 Sample Waiver Memo). An
     approved waiver will be kept on file by the ANG OPSEC PM and the unit’s OPSEC PM
     in the OPSEC continuity book (see Attachment 6 STANDARDIZED ANG UNIT
     SM/OPSEC CONTINUITY BOOK). Units may be required to fund training, if an

        civilian equivalent, or an E-7. The alternate OPSEC PM will be an E-6 or above, or
        civilian equivalent. Under no circumstances will contract personnel be appointed as a
        primary or alternate OPSEC PM. At a minimum, OPSEC PMs will have a secret
        clearance (recommend Top Secret).
            1.4.15.2.1.1. (Added-ANG) Unit commanders may appoint more than one
            alternate OPSEC PM/SMO, SMNCO as unit size and mission dictates.
            Commanders may appoint more than one alternate SMO, SMNCO, OPSEC PM
            or OPSEC coordinator; however, these individuals must materially contribute to
            the program. Note: HQAF funds may not be available to train more than two
            SMOs/ PMs per unit and would require unit funds for additional SMOs/PMs, but
            only when training slots are available.
            1.4.15.2.1.2. (Added-ANG) Ensure continuity of operations by appointing
            replacement OPSEC PMs and coordinators at least one month prior to the

        will establish a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA), signed by the host and each
        tenant commander that specifies host/tenant roles and responsibilities. ANG host
        wings will lead an installation SM OPSEC effort and each wing and geographically
        separated units will have their own tailored program. If the ANG unit is a tenant to a
        non-ANG host, the ANG SMO/PM will seek out the host OPSEC PM/SMO and
        provide to the host the tenants appointment letter, CIL, and countermeasures. ANG
        wing SMOs will comply with ANG Supplement guidance, will implement their unit’s
        programs IAW ANG procedures and report to their HHQ, ANG OPSEC PMs. (T-3)

        1.4.16.3.4.3. (Added-ANG) Review plans annually and update as needed.
        Consider changes in the threat, vulnerability, impact to the plan, and assessments
        of the countermeasures MOEs and MOPs.
        1.4.16.3.4.4. (Added-ANG) As soon as the unit is notified of an operational
        deployment or overseas exercise contact the gaining command for its OPSEC
        requirements and the deploying unit can also pass their CIL to the gaining OPSEC
        PM. Obtain and disseminate the operations/exercise CIL and countermeasures.
        Brief the unit’s personnel on the OPSEC considerations and begin to protect the
        CI from day one of planning. Delaying the OPSEC training and implementation
        of countermeasures could allow important information to be compromised.
        Record these actions and show to IG upon request.

        through 30 Sep each fiscal year to HHQ according to MAJCOM guidance.
        1.4.16.3.11. (ANG) Each ANG wing will submit an Annual OPSEC Program Report
        to the ANG OPSEC PM based on a callout message that will be sent with each fiscal
        year’s reporting instructions and suspense. This callout message will be sent once the
        ANG OPSEC PM receives Annual Reporting instructions from the Air Force OPSEC
        PM. Wings’ will consolidate subordinate group/squadron reports into the wing
        annual OPSEC Program Report. To facilitate HHQ reporting requirements, do not
        send reports as an imaged PDF file, instead use Word’s “Save as a PDF file” option
        as this will permit text extraction/consolidation and HHQ reporting. Wing
        commander signatures may be imaged or e-signature. (T-3)
        1.4.16.3.12. OPSEC PMs will establish, train, and chair working groups to address
        OPSEC or signature management concerns and to assist with planning and execution
        of OPSEC plans and signature management activities.
        1.4.16.3.13. Conduct Staff Assistance Visits (SAV) as required or requested.

         1.4.16.3.14. (Added-ANG) Program OPSEC funds through established Center’s,
         wing’s, or unit’s budgeting and requirements process. Funds can be used for OPSEC
         awareness and education training promotional campaign incentives; budget, acquire,
         and distribute OPSEC educational materials.
         1.4.16.3.15. (Added-ANG) All OPSEC PMs, SMOs and OPSEC Coordinators must
         maintain an OPSEC Continuity Binder. Electronic format continuity binder/items are
         sufficient as long as they are readily accessible upon demand. (See Attachment 6
         STANDARDIZED ANG UNIT SM/OPSEC CONTINUITY BOOK.) (T-3)
         1.4.16.3.16. (Added-ANG) Modify OPSEC plans as applicable whenever any
         mission changes occur or current events dictate adjusting your procedures. Once an
         OPSEC plan has been approved, an annual review for currency is required by 1 Oct.
         Submit updated OPSEC plans to the ANG OPSEC PM annually by 15 Oct and within
         90 days of any updates/changes. See Attachment 2 OPSEC Plan for categories that
         need to be addressed in the OPSEC plan.
         1.4.16.3.17. (Added-ANG) Ensure OPSEC Risk Assessment, Threat Analysis,
         Vulnerability Analysis Assessment, and OPSEC Risk Summary Worksheets (see
         AFTTP 3.1 IO, OPSEC Annex) are developed for each operation, activity, and
         exercise whether it be planned, conducted or supported. These documents will be
         kept on file for a minimum of five years (hard or soft copy).
         1.4.16.3.18. (Added-ANG) Ensure OPSEC related briefings or presentations to be
         given outside the ANG are coordinated through the Air Force OPSEC PM, AF/A3O-
         QI, prior to the presentation date. Send a courtesy copy to the ANG OPSEC PM
         concurrently with the HQ AF coordination.
  1.4.17. All Air Force Personnel: OPSEC is everyone’s responsibility. Ideally, the AF uses
  OPSEC measures to protect its critical information. Failure to properly implement OPSEC
  measures can result in serious injury or death to our personnel; damage to weapons systems,
  equipment and facilities; loss of sensitive technologies; and mission degradation or failure.
  OPSEC is a continuous process and an inherent part of military culture. Failure to implement
  directed OPSEC measures will be considered by commanders/directors for appropriate
  disciplinary action. OPSEC must be fully integrated into the execution of all Air Force
  operations and supporting activities. All AF personnel (active duty, reserve, ANG, Air Force
  civilians, and DoD contractors) will:
     1.4.17.1. Be familiar with their organization’s critical information.
     1.4.17.2. Protect critical and/or sensitive information from disclosure.
         1.4.17.2.1. When publicly posting or publishing work-related information that
         potentially contains critical or sensitive information airmen are encouraged to solicit
         the advice of their immediate supervisor, security office and/or OPSEC
         PM/SM/coordinator. This will aid in preventing disclosure of critical and/or sensitive
         information within the public domain. Personnel that do not know what information
         is critical to an organization cannot reasonably conclude that posting or publishing
         information will not result in an unauthorized disclosure.
             1.4.17.2.1.1. This includes, but is not limited to letters, resumes, articles,
AFI10-701_ANGSUP 3 APRIL 2014                                                                21


            electronic mail (e-mail), web site postings, web log (blog) postings, internet
            message board discussions, or other forms of dissemination or documentation.
            1.4.17.2.1.2. Supervisors will provide guidance to personnel regarding critical
            and/or sensitive information to ensure it is not disclosed in public forums. Each
            organization’s OPSEC PM/SM/coordinator will advise supervisors on means to
            prevent the public disclosure of critical and/or sensitive information.
            1.4.17.2.1.3. Encryption serves as one measure to protect critical or sensitive
            information transmitted over unclassified networks. Encrypt all e-mail messages
            containing critical information, OPSEC indicators, and other sensitive
            information. (AFI 33-119, Air Force Messaging Paragraph 6.1.2)
        1.4.17.2.2. Do not publicly disseminate, or publish photographs displaying critical
        and/or sensitive information. Examples include but are not limited to: Improvised
        Explosive Device strikes, battle scenes, casualties, destroyed or damaged equipment,
        personnel killed in action (both friendly and adversary), and the protective measures
        of military facilities.
        1.4.17.2.3. Do not publicly reference, disseminate, or publish critical and/or sensitive
        information already compromised. This provides further unnecessary exposure of the
        compromised information and may serve as validation.
        1.4.17.2.4. Actively encourage others (including family members and family
        readiness groups) to protect critical and/or sensitive information.
        1.4.17.2.5. Destroy (burn, shred, etc.) critical and/or sensitive unclassified
        information no longer needed to prevent the inadvertent disclosure and/or
        reconstruction of this material.
        1.4.17.2.5. (ANG) Recommend a 100% shred and recycle policy for documents
        containing critical information. Examples include, but are not limited to: local/HHQ
        exercises, test schedules, training and equipment vulnerabilities and limitations,
        personnel availability and recall procedures, NGB funding, capabilities and long-term
        planning, and individual/unit travel itineraries and flight plans.
     1.4.17.3. Implement protection measures as ordered by the commander, director, or an
     individual in an equivalent position.
     1.4.17.4. Know who their organization’s OPSEC PM and Coordinator is and contact
     them for questions, concerns, or recommendations for OPSEC or signature management
     related topics.
     1.4.17.5. Consider attempts by unauthorized personnel to solicit critical and/or sensitive
     information as human intelligence (HUMINT) gathering and consider it a HUMINT
     incident.
        1.4.17.5.1. AF personnel who have been involved in or have knowledge of a possible
        incident will report all facts immediately to the nearest supporting AFOSI office as
        required by AFI 71-101, Vol 4, Counterintelligence.
        1.4.17.5.2. If these offices are not readily available, HUMINT incidents will be
        reported to the organization’s security manager or commander who will ensure that,

        without exception, reports are relayed as securely and expeditiously within 24 hours
        to the nearest AFOSI organization.
  1.4.18. (Added-ANG) Local AFOSI will provide local threat information needed for the
  requesting unit's OPSEC process.
  1.4.19. (Added-ANG) Local intelligence unit will provide mission related intelligence
  support needed for the requesting unit's OPSEC process.      Note: AFI 10-701 mandates
  each wing to establish a SM office. NGB cannot grant waivers to this requirement. (T-3)

                                SIGNATURE MANAGEMENT

2.1. Signature Management. Signature management (SM) utilizes a process of profiling day-
to-day observable activities and operational trends at installations and each of its resident units.
SM incorporates preparatory methodologies of OPSEC and MILDEC creating synergies and
resource efficiencies for both the OPSEC and MILDEC wing/installation programs. These
methodologies result in identified processes and details that can be used in efforts to defend or
exploit operational profiles resident at a given military installation. Defense of operational
profiles is accomplished by implementing protective measures to deny or mitigate adversary
collection of critical information. Development of protective measures is often accomplished
using MILDEC tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs). The TTPs used for protection of
operational profiles are collectively referred to as Deception in Support of OPSEC (DISO).
NOTE: The guidance in this chapter is intended for Signature Management personnel at the
wing/installation level. The Signature Management Officer (SMO) and Signature Management
NCO (SMNCO) take on the responsibilities of the OPSEC and Military Deception (MILDEC)
PM.
   2.1.1. Signature Management is administered through a wing or installation SMO/SMNCO.
   An SMO/SMNCO can be appointed the primary or alternate wing or installation OPSEC PM.
   When an air component commander’s MILDEC plan requires Air Force wings and
   installations to present specified observable activities, the air component commander’s
   MILDEC planner will determine the actions required by the supporting unit(s) and will
   communicate those requirements to the SMO/SMNCO.
       2.1.1.1. (Added-ANG) ANG Wing Commanders will adopt the SM concept and within
       60 days of the signing of this supplement and will appoint SMOs/SMNCOs. The SMOs
       will assume the duties of the OPSEC PM (AFI 10-701 Chapter 1), SMO (AFI 10-701
       Chapter 2). (T-3)
       2.1.1.2. (Added-ANG) ANG SMOs will oversee their GSU’s OPSEC PM/Coordinators
       and ensure they integrate with their host unit by participating in the host’s SMWG when
       possible. (T-3)
   2.1.2. Signature management, OPSEC, and MILDEC are a commander's responsibility. The
   SMO/SMNCO will define the local operating environment and capture process points that
   present key signatures and profiles with critical information value. This process, known as
   the Base Profiling Process (BPP), is the deliberate effort to identify functional areas and the
   observables they produce to contribute to the overall signature of day-to-day activities and
   operational trends. Once the BPP is complete, the results can be used to develop a wing level
   CIL and identify key process points for potential protection or exploitation. This ultimately
   provides commanders several options to exploit or deny operational signatures to ensure
   mission effectiveness.
   2.1.2. (ANG) SMOs will have direct unrestricted access to the wing/installation commander
   to ensure immediate relay of any actual real-world taskings, potential/actual OPSEC
   compromise, or critical issues. This arrangement will be communicated to the SMOs chain
   of command and Commander’s staff to streamline the execution of gaining
 24                                                     AFI10-701_ANGSUP 3 APRIL 2014


   MAJCOM/Combatant Commander exercise and operational tasking. The commander will
   consider this requirement when appointing the SMO. (T-3)
   2.1.3. (Added-ANG) The installation SMO will provide all new unit commanders a SM
   orientation briefing within 30 days of assuming commander duties. This orientation briefing
   will outline the installation SM program, to include SMWG membership, training and
   exercise requirements, base profiling process (BPP) requirements and status, and commander
   support responsibilities to ensure sustained SM program continuity and effectiveness. The
   SMO will document completion of unit commander SM orientation training in the SM
   Continuity Binder and retain documentation until the commander relinquishes command (see
   continuity book I 3 a.) (T-3)
2.2. Wing or installation commanders will:
2.2. (ANG)Wing or installation commanders will: ANG Wing Commanders will adopt the
SM concept and within 60 days of the signing of this supplement and appoint Signature
Management Officer (SMOs)/ Signature Management Non-Commissioned Officers (SMNCOs).
The SMOs/SMNCOs will assume the duties of the OPSEC PM (AFI 10-701 Chapter 1), SMO
(AFI 10-701 Chapter 2). Wing Commanders will follow the guidance in this section in addition
to the requirements in Chapter 1.4.15 of the AFI and this Supplement. (T-3)
   2.2.1. Appoint in writing a primary and alternate SMO/SMNCO who will function as the
   OPR for all SM activities. The primary SMO will be an O-3 or above, or civilian equivalent.
   The alternate SMO will be an E-6 or above, or civilian equivalent. Under no circumstances
   will contract personnel be appointed as a primary or alternate SMO/SMNCO. At a
   minimum, SMO/SMNCOs will have a secret clearance (recommend Top Secret) and have
   two years retainability in the position or as area tour length dictates (remote tours only).
   Organizations requiring appointment of an SMO/SMNCO for less than two years will
   request, in writing, a waiver through their MAJCOM OPSEC PM from AF/A3Z-CI.
   2.2.1. (ANG) Wing or installation commanders will: Wing Commanders will appoint
   SMOs to serve a minimum of two years from the time they attend the Signature Management
   Course (SMC) to ensure the health of the OPSEC program and to maximize training
   investment. It is highly recommended that commanders appoint full-time guard members as
   primary and alternate SMOs due to amount of time required to administer the SM program.
   Wing commander endorsed waiver requests will be submitted to NGB/A3CC for
   consideration. (See Attachment 5 Sample Waiver Memo). The approved waiver will be
   kept by the OPSEC PM in the continuity folder. Appointment letters for ANG wing SMOs
   and waiver requests for the two year requirement will be submitted electronically in an
   official MFR format by e-mail to the ANG OPSEC PM (see Attachment 3 Signature
   Management Officer Appointment Letter Template). The commander will not have the
   SMO or SMNCO position go vacant for more than three months, but will identify a
   replacement with sufficient program turnover time to facilitate continued program continuity
   and stability. If the SMO or SMNCO position will go vacant for more than 3 months, the
   commander must notify the ANG OPSEC PM with a get well date. (T-3)
       2.2.1.1. In the event that host and tenant organizations on a given installation are
       subordinate to different MAJCOMs, the host MAJCOM OPSEC PM will coordinate and
       document how SM using protective and exploitation countermeasures will be conducted
       on that installation.
AFI10-701_ANGSUP 3 APRIL 2014                                                                25


          2.2.1.1.1. All wings based on the installation, regardless of their MAJCOM
          affiliation, will have a SMO/SMNCO assigned. However, the host wing/installation
          SMO/SMNCO will act as the lead for all SM activities. This agreement will be
          stipulated on a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) and should carry the weight of
          each signatory Wing Commander on the MOA as the designated SMO/SMNCO
          executes their duties for the installation.
          2.2.1.1.1. (ANG) Although there are some installations with only one wing, the
          majority of installations now have more than one unit. Therefore installation does not
          mean wing. Installations that have multiple organizations shall have a MOA, signed
          by the host and all tenant commanders that specify host/tenant roles and
          responsibilities. Each wing is responsible for establishing and maintaining its own
          OPSEC program under the SM office tailored to its missions, activities, threats, and
          vulnerabilities. Each wing commander/GSU commander is responsible for risk
          analysis based on that unit’s mission. These may be different if one unit deploys
          while others remain in garrison. All hosts and tenants need to work together to share
          CILs, Countermeasures, Threat Analysis to help protect all the CI on the base
          regardless of ownership. ANG host wings will lead an installation SM/OPSEC
          program and each organization will have their own tailored program. If the ANG
          wing is a tenant to a non-ANG host, the ANG SMO will seek out the host OPSEC
          PM / SMO and provide to the host the unit’s appointment letter, CIL, and
          countermeasures. ANG wing SMOs will report to ANG OPSEC. Installation
          SM/OPSEC MOAs will be reviewed annually or within 30 days of a change of any
          one of the signatories. (T-3)
          2.2.1.1.2. The substance of this arrangement will be documented and kept on file for
          every installation for which this condition applies and incorporated into MAJCOM
          supplements to this instruction. A copy of the MOA will be forwarded to the
          MAJCOM OPSEC PM and AF/A3Z-CI.
   2.2.2. Submit request through servicing MPF for award of special experience (SEI) 9O or
   234 as appropriate for individuals appointed as SMO/SMNCOs who meet all qualifications
   as identified in the Air Force Officer and Enlisted Classification Directories.
   2.2.3. (Added-ANG) ANG considers working groups an essential part of the OPSEC
   process. Commanders will ensure SMOs form and maintain a working group and have that
   list of participants available for short notice planning and IG review. Commanders will
   ensure SMOs (wing level and GSUs) will designate in writing and maintain a working group.
   Ensure individuals are identified, trained, periodically exercised and prepared to respond to
   short notice SM planning requirements and/or taskings. SMWGs will be established at the
   wing and installation level and chaired by the appointed SMO/SMNCO. (T-3)

     2.3.1. Follow guidance in this instruction and when appointed/assigned for MILDEC, follow
     AFI 10-704, Military Deception Program.
     2.3.2. Advise the commander on all SM related matters, to include developing and
     recommending policy, guidance, and instructions. Review periodically for currency and
     update as necessary.
     2.3.2. (ANG) SMOs will ensure wing policy and guidance is reviewed annually or more
     often as required by changing threats, missions, and/or vulnerabilities.
     2.3.3. Use the base profiling process to develop and maintain a master checklist of all
     activities associated with the mission areas for the wing or installation (i.e., recall, mobility
     processing, aircraft generation, airlift load generation and marshaling, munitions, personnel
     and equipment deployment, etc.). The checklist will be modified, as required, to support
     tasks associated with supported commander’s requirements. Therefore, well-developed
     master checklists are mandatory.                              NOTE: MAJCOM subordinate
     organizations below the air component level are NOT required to develop supporting
     MILDEC tabs (C-3A) to combatant command plans or supporting air component plans.
         2.3.3.1. (Added-ANG) ANG units will develop a signature management master
         checklist that includes all activities/processes conducted by the installation/wing. (See
         Table 2.1 Standard Wing Activities for Base Profiling) lists the minimum
         activities/processes that most installations/wings engage in and will be used by the SMO.
         The wing and installation SMO will conduct the BPP on all wing activities over and
         above the minimum stated in this list based on your wing’s unique activities/processes. If
         a SMO determines their wing does an activity(ies) not on this list the SMO will identify
         the activity(ies) to the ANG OPSEC PM. (T-3)

        2.3.3.2. (Added-ANG) SMOs will use the BPP developed checklists to improve
        OPSEC plans, execution, and assessment. The detailed study of the activities/processes
        is useful to help identify CI, vulnerabilities, countermeasures and the MOEs/MOPs
        needed in the OPSEC process. (T-3)
     2.3.4. Develop and maintain a current commander approved CIL.
     2.3.4. (ANG) Strive to keep unit CIL(s) “UNCLASSIFIED” and not “FOR OFFICIAL
     USE ONLY.” CIL(s) are to assist with reminding personnel to protect related CI. If some CI
     is considered FOUO include that information in an FOUO OPSEC plan with associated
     countermeasures but do not include on the publically distributed list.
     2.3.5. Implement SM execution checklists as directed or authorized by their wing or
     installation commander, MAJCOM OPSEC PM, or the supported air component commander,
     as appropriate.
     2.3.5. (ANG) Use the format found in Attachment 9 for the signature management
     execution checklist.
     2.3.6. Identify key personnel involved in the planning and execution of each of the major
     functional mission areas, and select subject matter experts (SMEs) who can assist in the
     development, exercising, and execution of the protective or exploitation countermeasures and
     activities. Grant access to SM material and plans on the commander's authority alone (this
     may be delegated to the SMO/SMNCO for expediency as determined by the commander).
     2.3.7. Work closely with antiterrorism, force protection, information protection, PA, web
     administrators, and other officials designated by the commander who share responsibility for
     the protection and release of information to ensure critical information is protected.
     2.3.8. Answer questions, develop guidance and provide advice to PA and other information
     releasing officials concerning protecting critical information during reviews of public and/or
     private web pages.
     2.3.9. Attend the Air Force Signature Management Course within 90 days of appointment or
     by the next available class. If scheduling conflicts exist, MAJCOM OPSEC PMs must
     document and ensure SMO/SMNCOs are scheduled for the next available course not to
     exceed 180 days. If training is not completed within 180 days, MAJCOM OPSEC PMs must
     request a waiver from AF/A3Z-CI.

  2.3.9. (ANG) Approved waivers (see Attachment 5 Sample Waiver Letter) will be
  retained in the continuity book (see Attachment 6 STANDARDIZED ANG UNIT
  SM/OPSEC CONTINUITY BOOK) by the SMO. (T-3)
  2.3.10. Conduct SM exercises at the wing or installation as directed by the parent
  MAJCOMs supplemental guidance.
     2.3.10.1. (Added-ANG) ANG units will accomplish two SM Exercises each year. One
     of the SM exercises will focus on protective measures and One will focus on exploitation
     measures. All wings and installations, whether a host or tenant unit, are required to
     perform annual SM exercises. The SM exercise may be accomplished in conjunction
     with the host unit or tenant unit exercise as long as specific aspects of the unit’s
     operational indicators are exercised and their SMWG is exercised. Either a SM
     protective measures or SM exploitation measure exercise can be accomplished as a table-
     top exercise but the remaining SM measure will be fully exercised. This requirement
     also pertains to those organizations that have been identified as wing level equivalent
     units and required to implement and maintain their own SM effort. An operational Event
     Log will be completed during the exercise and will be used for internal “hot wash”
     assessments to improve the process. Retain the Event Logs in the SM Continuity book.
     (See Attachment 10 SIGNATURE MANAGEMENT EVENT LOG for example.) (T-
     3)
  2.3.11. Work with exercise evaluation teams to observe and evaluate mission profiles and
  signatures, as well as measures of effectiveness (MOE) and measures of performance (MOP)
  that assess the organizations ability to mitigate loss of critical information. Evaluate how
  organization personnel execute protection or exploitation measures. Any deficiencies or best
  practices will be submitted in after action reports and to the AF lessons learned database
  (https://www.jllis.mil/usaf/) when applicable. Lessons learned will be used to develop
  tactics improvement proposals (TIPs) IAW AFI 10-204 and AFI 11-260.
  2.3.11. (ANG) The wing commander and SMO will determine Exercise Evaluation Team
  involvement considering the event, activities, and close hold methods to be used. (T-3)
  2.3.12. Establish, train, and coordinate with the unit SM working group (SMWG) members
  to assist with planning and execution of SM activities.
  2.3.12. (ANG) The SMO is responsible for establishing the SMWG, training SMWG
  members and coordinating SMWG activities. The SMO will maintain a master SMWG
  roster, identifying all members. The master roster may also identify which members are
  assigned SME responsibilities for certain base processes, as OPSEC only duties, or if the
  member is responsible for SM planning and/or executing exploitative techniques (See
  Attachment 9). (T-3)
  2.3.13. Coordinate, facilitate, and serve as the focal point for all assessments in support of
  SM activities such as surveys, annual program reviews, and vulnerability assessments as
  listed in Chapter 6.
  2.3.14. Develop and forward annual program reviews/reports for the period of 1 Oct through
  30 Sep each fiscal year to HHQ according to MAJCOM guidance.
AFI10-701_ANGSUP 3 APRIL 2014                                                                   29


   2.3.14. (ANG) Each ANG wing will submit an Annual OPSEC Program Report to the ANG
   OPSEC PM based on a callout message that will be sent with each fiscal year’s reporting
   instructions and suspense. This callout message will be sent once the ANG OPSEC PM
   receives Annual Reporting instructions from the Air Force OPSEC PM. Wings’ will
   consolidate subordinate group/squadron reports into the wing annual OPSEC Program
   Report. To facilitate HHQ reporting requirements, do not send reports as an imaged PDF
   file, instead use Word’s “Save as a PDF file” option as this will permit text
   extraction/consolidation and HHQ reporting. Wing commander signatures may be imaged or
   e-signature. (T-3)
   2.3.15. (Added-ANG) When units deploy, a SMO or trained OPSEC coordinator should
   deploy with the unit to work with the receiving installation SMO and AF Component OPSEC
   PMs/planners. This collaboration should begin once the deploying unit is notified until it
   returns to home station to ensure OPSEC protective countermeasures are implemented pre-,
   during, and post deployment.
   2.3.16. (Added-ANG) Ensure OPSEC related briefings or presentations to be given outside
   the ANG are coordinated through the ANG OPSEC PM to the Air Force OPSEC PM,
   AF/A3O-QI, prior to the presentation date. Send a courtesy copy to the ANG PM
   concurrently with the HQ AF coordination. (T-3)
2.4. Signature Management Planning and Coordination. NOTE: Ensure proper security
guidelines are followed when planning and coordinating SM activities.
   2.4.1. Submit SM exercise concepts and execution checklists to their MAJCOM for
   coordination (refer AFI 10-704 and the MAJCOM Supplement for more details).
   2.4.1. (ANG) ANG units will forward the following documents to ANG/A3CC for each SM
   exercise/operation that focus on exploitation measures: (T-3)
      2.4.1.1. (Added-ANG) Before execution - Exercise Proposal Format. Submit no later
      than 60 days prior to proposed exercise/operation execution start date. (See Attachment
      8 for Exercise Proposal Format). (T-3)
      2.4.1.2. (Added-ANG) Before execution – ANG SM execution checklist. Submit
      within 30 days of exercise/operation execution. (See Attachment 8 Exercise Proposal
      Format and Attachment 9: Signature Management Execution Checklist.) (T-3)
      2.4.1.3. (Added-ANG) After execution – Submit SM Lessons Learned (L2) worksheet
      within 45 days after exercise/operation termination. Use the AFI 90-1601, Special
      Management Air Force Lessons Learned Program, Attachment 3, Observation or Lesson
      Learned Template.) (T-3) Note: The AF Lessons Learned Program (AFL2P) exists to
      enhance readiness and improve combat capability by capitalizing on the experiences of
      Airmen. A Lesson Learned (L2) is an Observation that, when validated and resolved,
      results in an improvement in military operations or activities at the strategic, operational,
      or tactical level and results in long-term, internalized change to an individual or an
      organization. Coupling L2 with past experiences should also assist senior leaders in
      programming, budgeting and allocating resources as well as making changes to doctrine,
      organization, training, materiel, leadership & education, personnel, facilities and policy
      (DOTMLPF&P). An L2 finding is not a compliance “report card” nor is it automatically
      accepted and implemented without the scrutiny of functional experts. An L2 is also not
30                                                      AFI10-701_ANGSUP 3 APRIL 2014


     “owned” by any one organization. Rather, the mandate for all organizations participating
     in the AFL2P is to coordinate activities and collaboratively exchange observations and
     lessons identified for the benefit of the total AF mission.
         2.4.1.3.1. (Added-ANG) When accomplishing the L2 worksheet follow the four
         fundamental L2 components listed in AFI 90-1601, Figure 1.1 Collection, Validation,
         Dissemination and Resolution.
         2.4.1.3.2. (Added-ANG) As the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) for SM
         issues the SMO/SMNCO will establish procedures for monitoring the status of
         Lessons identified and actions taken. The SM Office will ensure periodic updates are
         annotated in the SM Master Checklist and should observe corrective actions and be
         vigilant for similar repeat observations.
         2.4.1.3.3. (Added-ANG) L2 Validation and Resolution: The SMO will review L2
         observations for accuracy, applicability and completeness and that they are
         appropriately tracked to closure to ensure they become true L2 and not just forgotten
         or ignored.
         2.4.1.3.4. (Added-ANG) Classify L2 worksheet if required by AF or joint security
         classification guides.
     2.4.1.4. (Added-ANG) After execution – Submit SM After-Action Report (AAR)
     Worksheet within 45 days after exercise/operation termination. Use AFI 90-1601,
     Special Management Air Force Lessons Learned Program, Attachment 4, After Action
     Report Template. Submit a separate worksheet for each SM measure/event.               Note:
     Whereas the SMO/SMNCO may have multiple L2 worksheets (one for each observation)
     associated with a single SM measure/event the SMO/SMNCO will only have one AAR
     worksheet for the entire measure/event. AARs are intended to help SMOs/SMNCOs
     fight a smarter, more capable fight and to be shared with other SMOs/SMNCOs for
     appropriate cross tell. Timely submissions of AARs (and the individual Observations
     which comprise them) are the SMOs/SMNCOs responsibility and they are expected to
     submit a unit-level AAR for the event (deployment, contingency, exercise, etc.) for which
     they are responsible. Observations to be documented are those which result in
     improvements in military operations at the strategic, operational, or tactical level. AAR
     Observations should describe how the mission could be/was improved, potential risks to
     mission degradation and how to mitigate those risks. AARs are intended to be more than
     a summary or rollup of unit/tactical actions. Whenever possible, AARs should be
     submitted as soon as practical to permit timely action but NLT then 45 days after
     measure/event termination.
     2.4.1.5. (Added-ANG) Classify AAR worksheet if required by AF or joint security
     classification guides.
  2.4.2. Submit SM execution checklists supporting real-world operations to the appropriate
  tasking authority (e.g., supported air component commands or MAJCOM OPSEC PM).
  2.4.3. For SM activities utilizing exploitation countermeasures that require implementation
  outside of the installation, coordinate with the host wing/installation MILDEC POC (refer to
  AFI 10-704, Paragraph 2.4.3).
AFI10-701_ANGSUP 3 APRIL 2014                                                               31


   2.4.4. Request assistance from the intelligence organization at the next level of their
   administrative and/or operational chain of command when requiring intelligence that exceeds
   organic capability. Counterintelligence support will be requested from the unit's local
   AFOSI detachment.
   2.4.5. Organizations needing assistance from Air Staff will make their request through their
   MAJCOM OPSEC PM.
2.5. Exploitation Countermeasures (Refer to AFI 10-704, Paragraph 2 4.3 for additional
guidance).

                                     OPSEC PLANNING

3.1. General. This chapter provides direction for planners at wings, Air Force Component
Headquarters (AFFOR and AOC) to integrate OPSEC into plans. Air Force forces can be under
observation at their peacetime bases and locations, in training or exercises, while moving, or
when deployed to the field conducting actual operations. OPSEC methodology provides
systematic and comprehensive analysis designed to identify observable friendly actions that
could betray intentions or capabilities. Therefore, OPSEC principles must be integrated into
operational, support, exercise, and acquisition planning. All plans will be reviewed periodically
to ensure currency and updated when required.
   3.1.1. OPSEC PMs, SMO/SMNCOs, or Coordinators will assist organization planners to
   incorporate protection of critical information and indicators into supported operational plans
   (OPLANS) and supporting plans. They will also assist exercise planners in developing
   master scenario events listings (MSEL) and MOP to train organization personnel in the
   application or execution of countermeasures (See AFDD 2, Operations and Organizations,
   for more information concerning MOE and MOP.
   3.1.2. OPSEC Planners will follow guidance as outlined in AFI 13-1AOC, Volume 3,
   Operational Procedures-Air and Space Operations Center, and Chapter 3 of this document.
3.2. Operational Planning. OPSEC will be included in all OPLANs, concept plans
(CONPLANs), functional plans (FUNCPLANs), and operation orders (OPORDS), etc.. Planners
will use existing TTPs to develop Tab C to Appendix 3 to Annex C to the OPORD or OPLAN.
The planning staff will identify critical information and OPSEC indicators from all functional
areas requiring protection throughout each phase of the operation. Risk assessments will be used
to identify applicable countermeasures to mitigate any unacceptable operational risks. MOP and
MOE will be developed for each OPSEC measure.
   3.2.1. Operational planning is typically focused at the Air Force Component Headquarters
   (AFFOR and AOC), with reach-back support outside the theater when appropriate. When
   planning duties are split, all responsible entities will integrate OPSEC into their planning
   efforts (see also JP 3-13.3, Operations Security, Chapter 3). As the supported organization,
   the theater AOC will resolve debates and provide general guidance.
3.3. Support Planning. Integrate OPSEC into all wartime and contingency plans as well as
support plans, i.e., programming plans and in-garrison expeditionary site plans.
3.4. Exercise Planning. In order to enhance combat readiness and improve crisis response,
OPSEC will be included in all exercise plans (EXPLANs). Specific OPSEC and/or signature
management scenarios will be included in the exercise MSELs with MOE and MOP to assess the
proficiency of functional planners to mitigate loss of critical information and organization
personnel to execute countermeasures. Deficiencies or best practices will be submitted to the AF
lessons learned database (https://www.jllis.mil/usaf/) when applicable to assist in the
assessment of critical information being posting in public forums. Lessons learned will be used

   3.4.1. OPSEC measures will also be employed during exercises to minimize observations of
   sensitive training activities by adversary surveillance and treaty verification activities.
3.5. Acquisition Planning. OPSEC requirements will be determined for all acquisitions and
contractor-supported efforts beginning with operational capabilities requirements generation and
continues through design, development, test and evaluation, fielding, sustainment and system
disposal. When required to protect sensitive military operations, commanders will ensure
OPSEC requirements are added to contracts. Commanders will evaluate contractor-developed
and    proposed     OPSEC       programs    for    compliance      with    required   standards.
NOTE: For more detailed planning instructions, refer to AFI 10-400 series publications.

                                           Chapter 4

                                      OPSEC PROCESS

4.1. General: OPSEC is an iterative five-step process: 1) Identify critical information; 2)
Analyze threats; 3) Analyze vulnerabilities; 4) Assess risk; and 5) Apply countermeasures.
Although normally applied in a sequential manner the process during deliberate or crisis action
planning, dynamic situations may require any step to be revisited at any time.
4.2. Identify Critical Information:
   4.2.1. Critical information is a specific fact about friendly intentions, capabilities, and
   activities vitally needed by adversaries for them to plan and act effectively, so as to guarantee
   failure or unacceptable consequences for friendly mission accomplishment. The product of
   the first step in the OPSEC process is to record your critical information in a critical
   information list (CIL).
   4.2.2. Critical information is best identified by the individuals responsible for the planning
   and execution of the organization’s mission. A working group or staff planning team can
   most effectively accomplish this task. Once a CIL is developed, commanders must approve
   the list and then ensure their critical information is protected and/or controlled.
   4.2.3. Critical information will be identified at the earliest stages of planning an operation or
   activity and continuously updated as necessary to support mission effectiveness.
4.3. Analyze Threats:
   4.3.1. A threat is an adversary with the capability and intent to undertake action detrimental
   to the success of program activities or operations.
   4.3.2. The primary source of local threat information is your local AFOSI detachment. For
   mission related intelligence support, contact your local intelligence unit. Generic validated
   threat data is provided by the Defense Intelligence Agency via the OPSEC assessment tool,
   OSCAR.
   4.3.3. Intelligence organizations analyze the threat through research of intelligence,
   counterintelligence, and open source information to identify who is likely to disrupt, deny,
   degrade, or destroy planned operations.
   4.3.4. A threat assessment should identify adversaries, their goals, what they already know,
   their capability and intent to collect critical information, and potential courses of action.
4.4. Analyze Vulnerabilities:
   4.4.1. A vulnerability exists when the adversary is capable of collecting critical information
   or indicators, analyzing them and then acting quickly enough to impact friendly objectives.
   The vulnerability can be your procedures, a failure of traditional security, poor judgment on
   the part of leadership, the fact that we process critical information on data based systems, or
   the system’s design itself.
       4.4.1.1. An indicator is a friendly detectable action and open-source information that can
       be interpreted or pieced together by an adversary to derive critical information.
AFI10-701_ANGSUP 3 APRIL 2014                                                                  35


   4.4.2. A vulnerability exists when the adversary is capable of collecting critical information
   and/or indicators, correctly analyzing them, and then takes timely action. The adversary
   essentially uses your critical information to support their decision-making process. The
   adversary has then exploited your vulnerability to obtain an advantage over you.
   4.4.3. A vulnerability analysis is the examination of your processes, projects or missions to
   determine if you have inherent, naturally occurring or self-induced vulnerabilities or
   indicators that put your critical information and thus your mission at risk.
4.5. Assess Risk:
   4.5.1. A risk is a measure of the potential degree to which protected information is subject to
   loss through adversary exploitation. Risk is assessed as the probability an adversary will
   gain knowledge of your critical information and the impact (on your mission) if the adversary
   is successful. A working group or staff planning team must conduct a risk assessment and
   develop recommended countermeasures based on operational planning and current operating
   environment. A typical risk assessment will:
       4.5.1.1. Compare vulnerabilities identified with the probability of an adversary being
       able to exploit it in time to be useful to determine a risk level.
       4.5.1.2. Determine potential countermeasures to reduce vulnerabilities with the highest
       risk. The most desirable countermeasures are those that combine the highest possible
       protection with the least resource requirements and/or adverse effect on operational
       effectiveness.
4.6. Apply Countermeasures:
   4.6.1. Countermeasures are anything that effectively negates or mitigates an adversary’s
   ability to exploit vulnerabilities. Countermeasures may be both offensive and defensive in
   nature.
   4.6.2. Potential countermeasures, among other actions are, camouflage, concealment,
   deception (CCD), intentional deviations from normal patterns, and direct strikes against
   adversary collection.
   4.6.3. The working group or staff planning team through the OPSEC PM, SMO or
   Coordinator will submit recommended countermeasures for commander approval through the
   operational planning process for employment or through appropriate staffing process.
   Organizations that do not have or require a planning cell will submit recommended
   countermeasures to the commander through appropriate staffing process.
   4.6.4. Countermeasures must be synchronized with other components of IO to achieve
   synergies in efforts to influence the adversary’s perceptions and situational awareness. Care
   must be taken so that countermeasures do not become vulnerabilities or unacceptable
   indicators themselves.
   4.6.5. During the execution of countermeasures, the adversary’s reaction to the measures is
   monitored, if possible, to provide feedback that can be used to assess effectiveness or
   determine potential unintended consequences.
4.7. (Added-ANG) The wing SMO. The wing SMO will use the base profiling process to
produce the following products:

                           OPSEC EDUCATION AND TRAINING

5.1. General. All Air Force personnel (military and civilian) and contractors who have access
to mission critical information require a general knowledge of threats, vulnerabilities and their
responsibilities associated with protecting critical information. This is accomplished through
initial and annual OPSEC training. Standardized AF OPSEC awareness training located on the
AF Advanced Distributed Learning Service is the baseline training required for all personnel.
Organization specific training will be provided in addition to this training to ensure all personnel
in the Air Force are aware of local threats, vulnerabilities and critical information unique to their
duty assignment. OPSEC PMs/SMO/SMNCOs/Coordinators, and planners assigned to OPSEC
positions require more in-depth training designed to ensure proper management, planning, and
execution of organizational OPSEC programs.
5.1. (ANG)General. HQAF has clarified the requirement of 5.1 and 5.2.3 since publishing AFI
10-701. The OPSEC annual refresher awareness education requirement is satisfied by
completing the Information Protection block of training within The Advanced Distributed
Learning                       Service                       (ADLS)                     site
https://golearn2.csd.disa.mil/kc/login/login.asp?kc_ident=kc0001#. Refresher education is
basic information to reinforce the understanding of OPSEC policy and procedures, critical
information, and procedures covered in initial/localized OPSEC training. (T-3)
5.2. All Personnel:
   5.2.1. Awareness education will be provided to all personnel (military, civilian and
   contractors) upon initial entrance/accession into military service.
   5.2.2. Awareness education provided in accession programs will encompass what OPSEC is,
   its purpose, threat awareness and the individual's role in protecting critical information.
   5.2.3. Organization-specific initial OPSEC awareness training will be provided at each new
   duty location as part of in-processing and annually thereafter, at a minimum. Personnel must
   understand the scope of the threats, the nature of the vulnerabilities and their responsibility to
   execute countermeasures to protect critical information and organization specific OPSEC
   indicators. Annual training must include, at a minimum, updated threat and vulnerability
   information, changes to critical information and new procedures and/or countermeasures
   implemented by the organization.
   5.2.3. (ANG) Local organization-specific OPSEC awareness education is required when an
   individual processes into a new organization and/or when a commander determines the need
   for awareness education. This is considered event driven and not AF directed annual
   refresher training. Recommend including the OPSEC awareness education in the unit’s in-
   processing briefings (i.e., Right Start, etc.) to fulfill initial in-processing requirement. Ensure
   the OPSEC awareness training is appropriately tracked and the individual is given credit for
   the initial unit training. (T-3)
       5.2.3.1. In addition, commanders/directors shall encourage assigned personnel to share
       OPSEC awareness information with family members (both immediate and extended) and
       social network "friends". This will ensure family members and friends understand how
 38                                                      AFI10-701_ANGSUP 3 APRIL 2014


      adversaries can use public media sources such as but not limited to web sites, blogs,
      social networking sites, newspapers, and television to obtain critical information that can
      be used to target AF members and their families.
      5.2.3.2. Procurement of low value promotional and awareness aids such as pens, pencils,
      magnets, key chains, lanyards, etc., is authorized for the exclusive intent to promote
      OPSEC awareness and education in accordance with organizational missions. For
      Guidance, refer to AFI 65-601, Vol 1, Budget Guidance and Procedures.
   5.2.4. OPSEC PMs/SMO/SMNCOs/Coordinators will provide OPSEC training or training
   materials to contract employees within 90 days of employees’ initial assignment to the
   contract.
5.3. OPSEC PMs/SMO/SMNCOs/Coordinators, Planners, Inspection Teams:
   5.3.1. Formal OPSEC training. Formal OPSEC training is required for all OPSEC
   PMs/SMO/SMNCOs, and planners assigned to OPSEC positions. Formal OPSEC training is
   any in-residence course intended to support the AF OPSEC Program.
      5.3.1.1. Completion of the Air Force Signature Management Course is mandatory for
      OPSEC PMs (below MAJCOM level), SMO/SMNCOs and planners within 90 days of
      appointment and within 180 days of appointment for MAJCOM OPSEC PMs. If
      scheduling conflicts exist, MAJCOM OPSEC PMs must document and ensure
      SMO/SMNCOs are scheduled for the next available course not to exceed 180 days. If
      training is not completed within 180 days, MAJCOM OPSEC PMs must request a waiver
      from the AF OPSEC PM.
         5.3.1.1.1. (Added-ANG) For ANG units, if scheduling conflicts exist, a waiver will
         be sent to the ANG OPSEC PM signed by the wing commander. Waivers will be
         rejected from wings that fail to request SMC Training or those units that do not
         remain available for available training slots. Once a waiver is received, the ANG
         OPSEC PM will then request a waiver from the AF OPSEC PM. The approved
         waiver will be kept on file by the requesting and approving OPSEC PMs in their
         continuity books and maintained for three years. (T-3)
         5.3.1.1.2. (Added-ANG) Note that the AFI requires OPSEC PMs below MAJCOM
         level and SMO/SMNCOs to attend the Signature Management Course (SMC), the
         Interagency OPSEC Support Staffs (IOSS) OPSEC Analysis and Program
         Management Course (OPSE 2500), and the IOSS OPSEC and Public Release
         Decisions (OPSE-1500). These three course requirements are now fulfilled once an
         individual attends the SMC. ANG cannot “grandfather” PMs. Current OPSEC PMs
         who have attended the SMC but have not fulfilled OPSE-2500 or OPSE-1500 need to
         fulfill other course requirements within 90 days. (T-3)
         5.3.1.1.3. (Added-ANG) To schedule SMC attendance, individuals must complete
         and return a nomination form provided by the MAJCOM OPSEC PM. ANG receives
         an allotment of class seats that will be prioritized across the ANG.
      5.3.1.2. Completion of OPSE-2500, OPSEC Analysis and Program Management
      Course is required for all OPSEC PMs within 90 days of appointment. If scheduling
      conflicts exist, OPSEC PMs must document and ensure they are scheduled for the next
AFI10-701_ANGSUP 3 APRIL 2014                                                                39


      available course not to exceed 180 days. If training is not completed within 180 days,
      individuals must notify their HHQ OPSEC PM.
   5.3.2. OPSEC Orientation Training.          OPSEC Coordinators, planners, vulnerability
   assessment team, inspection team, and Operations Security Working Group (OWG) members
   are required to complete OPSEC orientation training within 30 days of assignment to OPSEC
   duties. The Interagency OPSEC Support Staff’s (IOSS) multimedia product “An
   Introduction to OPSEC (An Interactive Primer by the Department of Defense)” is the
   accepted method for completing OPSEC orientation. It is high recommended personnel seek
   out additional OPSEC training to assist in accomplishing their duties. Information regarding
   required and additional OPSEC training can be received from OPSEC PMs or
   SMO/SMNCOs.
   5.3.2. (ANG) To clarify, the ANG received an approved waiver for individuals to complete
   the IOSS multimedia product “OPSEC Fundamentals Course” (OPSE-1301) CBT in lieu of
   the IOSS multimedia product “An Introduction to OPSEC (An Interactive Primer by the
   Department of Defense)” as the accepted method for completing OPSEC orientation. This is
   the new and improved course and can be completed at https://www.iad.gov/ioss/. (T-3)
   5.3.3. OPSEC Planner Mission Readiness Training (MRT). Personnel working as OPSEC
   planners in an AOC require MRT that encompasses initial qualification training (IQT),
   mission qualification training (MQT), and continuation training (CT). IQT will consist of
   formal training (either SMC or OSPE-2500, OPSEC Analysis and Program Management
   Course). MQT will consist of mission specific training and will be documented via
   Stan/Eval processes. CT will be provided as needed. MRT will be accomplished during
   training exercises.
   5.3.4. Quality Assurance Evaluators (QAE) and Contracting Officer Technical
   Representatives (COTR) will complete OPSEC training designed for QAE and COTR duties
   provided by the OPSEC PM/SMO/SMNCO/Coordinator within 90 days of being assigned
   duties. OPSEC PM/SMO/SMNCO/Coordinators are encouraged to use the training located
   on Defense Acquisition University - "CLC 107, OPSEC Contract Requirements"
   https://learn.dau.mil/html/clc/Clc1.jsp along with any specific unit tailored OPSEC
   training.
   5.3.4. (ANG) To clarify, http://icatalog.dau.mil/onlinecatalog/courses.aspx?crs_id=422
   is the updated link that Contracting Officers are to complete training designed for COTR
   duties and training located on the Defense Acquisition University CLC 107, OPSEC Contract
   Requirements. (T-3)
   5.3.5. Web Site Administrators, Webmasters, and anyone (superiors, public affairs specialist,
   OPSEC coordinators, PMs, SMO/SMNCO, etc.) who has the responsibility to review
   information for public release will complete OPSEC training focused on reviewing
   information to be posted on Internet-based Capabilities. The IOSS OSPE 1500, OPSEC &
   Public Release Decisions and OPSE-3500, OPSEC & Web Risk Assessment are the AF
   acceptable training methods to fulfill this requirement.
5.4. Joint and Interagency OSPEC Support:
   5.4.1. Joint Operations Security Support Center. The Joint OPSEC Support Center (JOSC)
   provides direct support to the Joint Information Operations Warfare Command (JIOWC) and

  Joint Force Commanders through the integration of OPSEC into operations, plans, and
  exercises and by providing staff-level program development and training and OPSEC
  vulnerability assessments when directed. The JOSC serves as the OPSEC Joint Center of
  Excellence and provides OPSEC training and instruction in support of the Combatant
  Commands.
  5.4.2. Interagency Operations Security Support Staff. The Interagency OPSEC Support
  Staff (IOSS) supports the National OPSEC Program by providing tailored training, assisting
  in program development, producing multimedia products and presenting conferences for the
  defense, security, intelligence, research and development, acquisition and public safety
  communities. Its mission is to help government organizations develop their own, self-
  sufficient OPSEC programs in order to protect United States programs and activities. IOSS
  offers a multitude of OPSEC training aids available to all OPSEC professionals.
  5.4.3. Air Force personnel are welcome and encouraged to receive training from the JOSC
  and IOSS. The courses offered by the JOSC and IOSS provide a broader perspective of
  OPSEC at the joint and interagency level while Air Force OPSEC training is oriented
  specifically to an Air Force audience.

                                       ASSESSMENTS

6.1. General:
   6.1.1. Assessments are performed to achieve two specific purposes: To ensure required
   policies and procedures are in place to protect critical information and to gauge the overall
   effectiveness of countermeasures (See Table 6.1 for OPSEC assessment types).
   6.1.2. The      Air    Force       provides      several      tools    to      assist    OPSEC
   PMs/SMO/SMNCOs/Coordinators and planners to obtain information and data to perform
   risk analysis. These tools assist in assessing the level of exposure of critical information and
   operational indicators to adversary observation, surveillance, and intelligence sensors.
   OPSEC planners, PMs and Coordinators use assessment results within the risk management
   process to determine countermeasures which can mitigate or negate risk to operations.
   6.1.3. Assessment of program effectiveness is accomplished through the development of
   MOP and MOE. MOP are developed to measure how well an activity is performed via the
   execution of countermeasures. MOE measure how well an activity achieved its intended
   effect. Any deficiencies or best practices identified are documented in lessons learned and
   TIPs. Inspector General (IG) inspections are also used to assess organization compliance,
   operational readiness, and nuclear surety. Submit TIPs IAW AFI 11-260.
   6.1.4. OPSEC PMs, SMO/SMNCO and Coordinators will utilize the OPSEC risk assessment
   tool OSCAR to accomplish annual assessments and program reviews.
   6.1.5. For assistance in preparing for inspections and assessments, utilize the OPSEC Core
   Capabilities Checklists provided at the below link to the Air Force Inspection Agency’s
   (AFIA) web site. The AFIA checklists are divided into functional levels (wing, unit and
   AOC) and provide the basics for maintaining your OPSEC program. MAJCOM and AF IG
   teams      will     utilize   these      checklists    when     conducting       inspections.
   https://webapps.afrc.af.mil/afia/SearchChecklist.aspx?Command=AFIA&Type=CI&St
   ate=live&Dir=A3 .
   6.1.5. (ANG) To clarify, the updated link in preparing for inspections and assessments,
   utilize the OPSEC Core Capabilities Checklists located on the Management Internal Control
   Toolset (MICT) found at https://mict.us.af.mil/. ANG Wing Level units are required to
   complete OPSEC Program – (Below Wing Level Organizations) “OPSEC 4” and OPSEC
   Program – (Wing or Wing equivalent organizations) “OPSEC 5” Checklists. ANGRC Air
   Directorate OPSEC Coordinators are required to complete OPSEC Program – Headquarters
   Directorates/Staff Offices (MAJCOM, CNAF, AF DRU, AF FOA, and Wing “OPSEC 2
   Checklist. (T-3)
      6.1.5.1. (Added-ANG) ANG units are required to maintain a continuity book that
      includes the last three years of data. A program that indicates it was only created to “pass
      the inspection” and does not show sustained continuity of the program between
      inspections can be downgraded. Programs with PM/SMOs that do not meet AFI directed
      retainability may be downgraded at the discretion of the gaining MAJCOM IG with
      coordination of NGB/A3CC. (T-3)
42                                                     AFI10-701_ANGSUP 3 APRIL 2014


     6.1.5.2. (Added-ANG) ANG OPSEC PM approved OPSEC and SM checklists for IG
     use and self-inspection/self-assessment reside on the Management Internal Control Tool
     (MICT) web site. These ANG Compliance Inspection Checklists (CICs) are what will be
     used for IG inspections on all gaining MAJCOM gained units. The ANG OPSEC PM in
     coordination with the NGB IG will coordinate with other MAJCOM IG inspection
     checklists for ANG applicability and NGB IG is the final authority.
     6.1.5.3. (Added-ANG) ANG GSUs are designated below wing level and will use the
     OPSEC Program- Below Wing Level self-inspection checklist. (T-3)
  6.1.6. Any request for external assessments must be made through your respective HHQ
  OPSEC PMs.
  6.1.7. MAJCOM OPSEC PMs are the focal point for requesting and scheduling all external
  assessments and setting all priorities between command organizations.
6.2. Annual OPSEC Program Review:
  6.2.1. The Annual OPSEC program review is a continual processes that involve combining
  data collected from MOP, MOE, exercise after action reports, lessons learned, nuclear surety,
  operational readiness/compliance inspections, and annually conducted self-assessments/self-
  inspections. Annual program reviews will be accomplished utilizing OSCAR and report to
  the HHQ OPSEC PM.           This has been assigned Report Control Symbol (RCS) DD-
  INTEL(A) 2228.
  6.2.1. (ANG) Each ANG wing will submit an Annual OPSEC Program Report to the ANG
  OPSEC PM based on a callout message that will be sent with each fiscal year’s reporting
  instructions and suspense. This callout message will be sent once the ANG OPSEC PM
  receives Annual Reporting instructions from the Air Force OPSEC PM. Wings’ will
  consolidate subordinate group/squadron reports into the wing annual OPSEC Program
  Report. To facilitate HHQ reporting requirements, do not send reports as an imaged PDF
  file, instead use Word’s “Save as a PDF file” option as this will permit text
  extraction/consolidation and HHQ reporting. Wing commander signatures may be imaged or
  e-signature. (T-3)
  6.2.2. OPSEC PMs, SMO/SMNCOs, and Coordinators will conduct annual program reviews
  to ensure the health of their program, evaluate compliance with applicable policies and to
  identify short-falls and vulnerabilities.
  6.2.3. Annual OPSEC Program Reviews will provide information relating to the following
  areas:
     6.2.3.1. Executive Summary: Full-time OPSEC PM appointed, budget plan developed,
     level of importance within the organization.
     6.2.3.2. OPSEC Initiatives/Projects/Successes: How is the commander making OPSEC
     a priority? (Policy and guidance, social networking site reviews, etc.)
     6.2.3.3. OPSEC Training and Awareness: Has the commander assigned a fully trained
     SMO/SMNCO to the SMO/SMNCO position? How is OPSEC awareness education and
     training conducted in the organization? (Commander’s call, unit newsletter, incorporating
     OPSEC into exercises).
AFI10-701_ANGSUP 3 APRIL 2014                                                                43


       6.2.3.4. OPSEC in Operational Planning: How has the commander incorporated OPSEC
       into the unit’s operational plans? (Implementing OPSEC measures, unique tools used to
       incorporate OPSEC, integration efforts)
       6.2.3.5. Assessment/Surveys: Does the assigned OPSEC PMs have an established
       OSCAR account? Total number of assessments and surveys accomplished to determine
       the overall effectiveness of the unit’s OPSEC program?
   6.2.4. At MAJCOM-level, this report will be signed by the Director responsible for the
   MAJCOM’s OPSEC program or higher-level authority. At wing-level and below the
   commander or their designated representative will sign it.
   6.2.4. (ANG) ANG wing reports will be signed by the wing commander. (T-3)
6.3. Staff Assistance Visit (SAV):
   6.3.1. SAVs may be conducted as needed by HHQ OPSEC PMs, SMOs or other
   organization SMEs to assist organizations in repairing dormant, non-compliant, deficient
   programs or for any other reason deemed necessary by the commander. The organization
   will request such assistance through their respective chain-of-command and will fund travel.
   SAVs check for program compliance (i.e., Special Interest Items, Air Force Instructions,
   MAJCOM policies, etc.), identify and resolve shortfalls, and provide guidance to OPSEC
   PMs, SMOs, and Coordinators as required.
   6.3.1. (ANG) SAVs may be conducted as needed by HHQ OPSEC PMs or because of the
   large number of ANG wings; other wings may be requested to conduct a SAV. NGB/A3CC
   policy is to conduct a SAV only when specifically requested by the wing commander if time
   and funding permit. NGB/A3CC will not conduct SAVs within six-months preceding any
   inspection. SAVs requested by the unit may have to be funded by the unit.
6.4. Survey:
   6.4.1. An OPSEC survey is the application of the OPSEC methodology by a team of subject
   matter experts to conduct a detailed analysis of all activities associated with a specific
   organization, operation, activity, exercise, or support function by employing the known
   collection capabilities of potential adversaries. The purpose of an OPSEC survey is to
   determine if OPSEC countermeasures are effectively mitigating identified threats and
   vulnerabilities.
       6.4.1.1. The survey requires a team of experts to look at an activity from an adversary’s
       perspective to determine if critical information may be disclosed through normal
       operations and functions, to identify vulnerabilities, and propose countermeasures to
       mitigate them.
       6.4.1.2. Survey team members attempt to use the collection techniques and tools of
       known adversaries. Commanders/directors are encouraged to use OPSEC support
       capabilities (reference Paragraph 6.6) to assist in conducting surveys, if available.
6.5. Web Content Vulnerability Analysis:
   6.5.1. Web content vulnerability analysis is a formal, structured process of evaluating
   information posted on organizational public and private web sites. This analysis
   complements each organization’s requirement to have processes in place ensuring all
 44                                                       AFI10-701_ANGSUP 3 APRIL 2014


   information posted to publicly accessible web sites are reviewed and approved prior to
   posting.
   6.5.2. Organizations will conduct web content vulnerability analysis of content on their
   organization’s public and private web sites for its sensitivity (i.e., critical information, For
   Official Use Only, or other controlled unclassified information categories) or sensitivity in
   aggregate to determine potential vulnerabilities by adversary exploitation. Prior to
   conducting a web content vulnerability analysis, follow these guidelines:
      6.5.2.1. Ensure a legal review is conducted by the Judge Advocate (JA) of your web
      vulnerability analysis processes prior to conducting assessments of information on your
      organizational public and private web sites.
      6.5.2.2. Ensure automated key word searching software (i.e. web crawlers) are approved
      for use by the local Systems Integration organization prior to utilization.
      6.5.2.3. If using automated software to retrieve information from web sites, ensure it is
      used only to assess the owning organizations public and private web sites.
      6.5.2.4. Develop strict procedures regarding who can conduct assessments, when the
      assessments will be conducted, what will be done with the information retrieved, who can
      view the information, and how long the information will be maintained on file.
      6.5.2.5. Manage and dispose of information collected and analyzed in accordance with
      AFMAN 33-363, Management and Records and The AF Records Disposition Schedule
      (AFRIMS).
6.6. Support Capabilities:
   6.6.1. Telecommunication Monitoring Assessment Program (TMAP) involves the collection
   and analysis of information transmitted via unsecured and unprotected communications
   systems (email, radio, telephone, and internet-based capabilities) to determine if these
   systems are being used to transmit critical, sensitive or classified information. TMAP helps
   in evaluating an organization’s OPSEC posture and determining the amounts and types of
   information available to adversary collection entities. TMAP is accomplished only within
   certain legal parameters and may only be performed by authorized personnel. See AFI 10-
   712, Telecommunication Monitoring Assessment Program (TMAP) for further guidance.
   6.6.2. Information Operations Mobile Training Teams (IO MTT) provide a three-phased
   event conducted by the 57th and 177th Information Aggressor Squadrons (57/177 IAS) where
   they assess an organization's network security, physical security, and counter-HUMINT
   capabilities. The first phase is executed remotely through dot-com capabilities and the
   collection and exploitation of open source information; the second phase is accomplished at
   the installation itself and finally through replication of the attack, the 57/177 IAS trains the
   information owners and base personnel on the threat to USAF critical information and their
   responsibilities of securing it. IO MTT identify operation vulnerabilities, operational
   impacts, and exercise threat response procedures. OPSEC PM/SMO/Coordinators use
   information identified by the IO MTT to conduct the OPSEC process.
   6.6.3. HUMINT Vulnerability Assessments (HVA) are used to assess the types and amount
   of information being exposed to potential HUMINT collection with respect to your missions.
AFI10-701_ANGSUP 3 APRIL 2014                                                                                      45


         6.6.3.1. Results of these collection capabilities identify the possible level of exposure of
         critical information and operational indicators to adversary observation, surveillance, and
         intelligence sensors. Once analyzed, the information assists in the performance of risk
         assessments for blue forces to develop measures to counter the threat based on
         vulnerabilities identified.
   6.6.4. OSCAR is a web-based tool developed to provide a standardized process to assist the
   OPSEC community with assessing and quantifying risk to critical information allowing
   decision makers to make informed decisions on what countermeasures to implement to
   reduce the organization’s overall risk and vulnerabilities. OSCAR provides posture,
   vulnerabilities and risk level status, which can provide assistance in developing plans and
   management reports. It provides a platform for planners to test remediation options and
   scenarios and provides an expert knowledge base to assist in threat assessments. All OPSEC
   program managers are required to establish an OSCAR account. OSCAR accounts can be
   requested          by           going         to         the          following        link:
   https://register.dtic.smil.mil/wobin/WebObjects/RegLite?SiteID=OSCAR on SIPR.
   6.6.5. Organizations will request support through their SMO or OPSEC PM to their
   respective MAJCOM OPSEC PM. MAJCOM OPSEC PMs will submit TMAP requests to
   624 OC/CPD at 624OC/CPD@lackland.af.smil.mil; IO MTT request are submitted to HQ
   ACC/A3I at acc.xoz.iwd@langley.af.mil and HVA requests are submitted IAW procedures
   of your local AFOSI detachment.

                 AIR FORCE OPSEC ANNUAL AWARDS PROGRAM

7.1. General:
   7.1.1. The annual Air Force OPSEC Awards program provides recognition of Air Force
   OPSEC professionals and is a priority for the Air Force OPSEC program. This awards
   program runs concurrently on a fiscal year basis with the National OPSEC Awards program
   conducted by the IOSS. Only AF OPSEC awards submitted by the Air Force OPSEC PM
   will be considered by the IOSS for the National OPSEC Awards.
   7.1.2. Air Force organizations wishing to compete for AF OPSEC annual awards must
   submit nominations through their respective MAJCOMs to reach AF/A3Z-CI, NLT 31 Oct
   each year.
   7.1.2. (ANG) ANG units will submit award nominations through their wing to arrive at
   NGB/A3CC by 15 October each year.
   7.1.3. The Air Force does not award an AF-level award in the multimedia area. Any Air
   Force organization wishing to compete for the National OPSEC Multimedia Achievement
   Awards must submit nominations through their respective MAJCOM to reach AF/A3Z-CI,
   NLT 15 November to meet the IOSS suspense. Go to http://www.ioss.gov for further
   descriptions of the awards and nomination criteria.
   7.1.3. (ANG) ANG units wishing to compete for the National OPSEC Awards will submit
   the nomination through their wing to NGB/A3CC by 15 Oct each year.
   7.1.4. Requirements for AF OPSEC awards are listed in AFI 36-2807, Chapter 23,
   Headquarters United States Air Force Deputy Chief of Staff Operations, Plans and
   Requirements Annual Awards Program.
   7.1.4. (ANG) Requirements for AF OPSEC awards are listed in AFI 36-2807, Chapter 12,
   Headquarters United States Air Force Deputy Chief of Staff Operations, Plans and
   Requirements Annual Awards Program. These are separate from the IO awards found in
   Chapter 23.

                                            Chapter 8

                    OPSEC REQUIREMENTS WITHIN CONTRACTS

8.1. General:
8.1. (ANG)General: AFI 10-701, Chapter 8 establishes requirements for “the organization” to
include contract requirements. ANG adds these responsibilities to the ANGRC, wing, and GSU
commanders that have responsibility to establish and maintain an OPSEC program/SM office
and to his PM/SMO. The commander may designate, in writing, one or more individuals to
perform these roles for him but the responsibility remains with the commander. In the absence
of assigning the contractual requirements to another office, the OPSEC PM/SMO will be the
office responsible for carrying out the commander’s guidance on the Chapter 8 contractual
requirements. (T-3)
   8.1.1. Contractors for defense systems acquisition programs as well as other types of Air
   Force contracts will practice OPSEC to protect critical information for specific government
   contracts and subcontracts.
   8.1.2. It is the responsibility of the organization to determine what measures are essential to
   protect critical and sensitive information for specified contracts. Organizations should
   identify OPSEC measures in their requirements documents and ensure they are identified in
   resulting solicitations and contracts. The organization is responsible for ensuring the
   appropriate critical program information; OPSEC measures and costs are billed and tracked
   as a separate line item in all contracts.
8.2. Guidance and procedures:
   8.2.1. Organizations will consider OPSEC for all contractual requirements. They must first
   determine whether there is any form of critical or sensitive information or activities involved
   in the contract. It is the organization’s responsibility to inform the contracting officer when a
   determination has been made that there are no OPSEC requirements for the contract.
   8.2.2. If there are OPSEC requirements, the organization is responsible for conducting an
   OPSEC review of the Statement of Work (SOW) or Performance Work Statement (PWS)
   prior to the time the contracting officer publicizes the SOW or PWS. The SOW/PWS is a
   publicly released document that can reveal critical information or indicators of critical
   information. It is critical that the organization OPSEC PM or SMO identify OPSEC
   requirements in the scope of work.
   8.2.3. The organization will specify OPSEC requirements for classified contracts on DD
   Form 254, Department of Defense Contract Security Classification Specification. This form
   defines classification, regarding, downgrading, declassification, and OPSEC specifications
   for a contract. Though the DD Form 254 applies to classified contracts, and classified
   subcontracts, it may also be used for unclassified contracts to specify OPSEC requirements.
   For unclassified contracts, if the DD Form 254 is not used, the organization will define the
   specific OPSEC requirements in the contract and the SOW/PWS.
   8.2.4. The organization’s designated representative is responsible for preparation of the
   prime contract’s DD Form 254. Based on the classification guidance or OPSEC
   requirements in the prime contract, the prime contractor is responsible for preparation of DD
AFI10-701_ANGSUP 3 APRIL 2014                                                             49


  Forms 254 for any subcontracts. This should be done in coordination with the organization’s
  SMO or OPSEC PM and security manager.
  8.2.5. The organization will state OPSEC requirements on DD Form 254, contracts and
  SOW/PWSs with sufficient detail to ensure complete contractor understanding of the exact
  OPSEC provisions or measures required by the organization. If the OPSEC block is checked
  on the DD Form 254, the organization shall:
     8.2.5.1. Task the contractor to develop an OPSEC program plan to address how the
     contractor plans to protect critical and sensitive contracted information, and upon
     organization acceptance, implement the OPSEC program plan.
     8.2.5.2. Provide OPSEC guidance for the contractors to use in developing their own
     OPSEC plan.
  8.2.6. The organization will determine OPSEC requirements when the contract involves
  sensitive information. When it does, the organization will ensure that the contract and
  SOW/PWS include OPSEC requirements, which must include establishing an OPSEC
  training program to protect the organization’s critical information.
  8.2.7. For a contractor to effectively comply with OPSEC provisions of the contract, the
  organization must provide the following guidance:
     8.2.7.1. Organization’s critical information.
     8.2.7.2. Adversaries’ collection threat information as it applies to the organization’s
     mission and the contract.
     8.2.7.3. Operations security guidance (at a minimum, the organization will provide a
     copy of this instruction).
     8.2.7.4. Specific OPSEC measures the organization requires (as appropriate).

effectiveness; shorten the expected combat-effective life of the system; reduce technological
advantage; significantly alter program direction; or enable an adversary to defeat, counter, copy,
or reverse engineer the technology or capability. Includes information about applications,
capabilities, processes, and end-items; information about elements or components critical to a
military system or network mission effectiveness; and technology that would reduce the U.S.
technological advantage if it came under foreign control.

Indicator—Data derived from friendly detectable actions and open-source information that
adversaries can interpret and piece together to reach conclusions or estimates of critical or
classified information concerning friendly intentions, capabilities, or activities.
Influence Operations—The employment of capabilities to affect behaviors, protect operations,
communicate commander’s intent, and project accurate information to achieve desired effects
across the cognitive domain. These effects should result in differing behavior or a change in the
adversary decision cycle, which aligns with the commander’s objective.
Information Operations—Actions taken to affect adversary information and information
systems while defending one's own information and information systems.
Integrated Control Enablers—Critical capabilities required to execute successful air, space,

intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, network operations, predictive battlespace
awareness and precision navigation and timing.
Measures of Effectiveness (MOE)—Independent qualitative or quantitative measures assigned
to an intended effect (direct or indirect) against which the effect’s achievement is assessed. At
the direct effect level, MOEs answer such questions as, “was the intended direct effect of the
mission e.g., target destruction, degradation (to a defined point), or delay (for a given time)
created?” At the indirect level, they may answer things like, “has the enemy IADS been
degraded sufficiently to allow unimpeded air operations above 15,000 feet?” (AFDD 2)
Measures of Performance (MOP)—Objective or quantitative measures assigned to the actions
and against which the action’s accomplishment, in operations or mission terms, is assessed.
MOPs answer questions like, “were the weapons released as intended on the planned target?”
(AFDD 2)
Operations Security (OPSEC)—OPSEC is a process of identifying, analyzing and controlling
critical information indicating friendly actions associated with military operations and other
activities to: Identify those actions that can be observed by adversary intelligence systems;
Determine what specific indications could be collected, analyzed and interpreted to derive
 58                                                       AFI10-701_ANGSUP 3 APRIL 2014


critical information in time to be useful to adversaries; Select and execute measures that
eliminate or reduce to an acceptable level the vulnerabilities of friendly actions to adversary
exploitation.
OPSEC Assessment—An evaluative process, conducted annually of an organization, operation,
activity, exercise, or support function to determine if sufficient protection measures are in place
to protect critical information. An OPSEC program review may include self-generated program
reviews, Inspector General inspections, or higher headquarters reviews that specifically address
OPSEC.
OPSEC Compromise—The disclosure of critical information or sensitive information which
has been identified by the information owner (commander/director) and any higher headquarters
that jeopardizes the unit’s ability to execute its mission or to adequately protect its personnel
and/or equipment. Critical or sensitive information that has been compromised and is available
in open sources and the public domain should not be highlighted or referenced publicly outside
of intra-governmental or authorized official communications because these actions provide
further unnecessary exposure of the compromised information.
OPSEC Coordinator—Acts as an interface to direct and manage all relevant OPSEC matters
below the wing-level and reports to the SMO or OPSEC PM.
OPSEC Indicator—Friendly detectable actions and open-source information that can be
interpreted or pieced together by an adversary to derive critical information.
OPSEC Measure—Methods and means to gain and maintain essential secrecy about critical
information.
OPSEC Program Manager—Focal point for all OPSEC related matters at an organization
above the squadron level that is not a wing. Ensures OPSEC requirements are in compliance as
directed and reviews organizational plans to ensure OPSEC is appropriately considered.
OPSEC Planner—An individual who has been formally trained in the planning and execution
of OPSEC.
OPSEC Survey—An OPSEC survey is the application of the OPSEC methodology by a team of
subject matter experts to conduct a detailed analysis of all activities associated with a specific
organization, operation, activity, exercise, or support function by employing the known
collection capabilities of potential adversaries.
OPSEC Vulnerability—A condition in which friendly actions provide OPSEC indicators that
may be obtained and accurately evaluated by an adversary in time to prove a basis for effective
adversary decision making.
Risk—A measure of the potential degree to which protected information is subject to loss
through adversary exploitation.
Risk Analysis—A method by which individual vulnerabilities are compared to perceived or
actual security threat scenarios in order to determine the likelihood of compromise of critical
information.
Risk Assessment—A process of evaluating the risks to information based on susceptibility to
intelligence collection and the anticipated severity of loss.
AFI10-701_ANGSUP 3 APRIL 2014                                                                     59


Sensitive Information— Unclassified information requiring special protection from disclosure
that could cause compromise or threat to our national security, an Air Force organization,
activity, military member, AF civilian, DoD contractor, or family member.
Signature—Observable activities and operational trends that reveal critical information to
adversary intelligence collection.
Signature Management (SM)—the active defense or exploitation of operational profiles
resident at a given military installation. Defense of operational profiles is accomplished by
implementing protective SM measures to deny adversary collection of critical information.

detrimental to the success of program activities or operations.
Threat Assessment—an evaluation of the intelligence collection threat to a program activity,
system, or operation.
Vulnerability Analysis—In information operations, a systematic examination of an information
system or product to determine the adequacy of security measures, identify security deficiencies,
provide data from which to predict the effectiveness of proposed security measures, and confirm
the adequacy of such measures after implementation. See also information operations,
information system, security, and vulnerability.
Vulnerability Assessment—A process that examines a friendly operation or activity from the
point of view of an adversary, seeking ways in which the adversary might determine critical
information in time to disrupt or defeat the operation or activity.
Web Vulnerability Analysis—Process of evaluating information intended for release outside
the control of the organization, including release to the public, i.e., public and private web sites.
Working Group—Designated body representing a broad range of line and staff activities within
an organization that provides advice and support to leadership and all elements of the
organization. (This can be an OPSEC, SM, threat, or public affairs working group that addresses
OPSEC concerns)

MEMORANDUM FOR NGB/A3CC

FROM: {Wing/Unit}/CC

SUBJECT: Request for Waiver to Signature Management Officer (SMO) [Signature
Management NCO (SMNCO); OPSEC Program Manager (PM)] Retainability Requirement

1. AFI-10-701, ANG SUP Operations Security requires the SMO [SMNCO, Program Manager]
to have two years retainability from SMC Training date. This requirement is driven by training
costs, return on investment, as well as health of the program since high turnover negatively
affects the programs’ effectiveness.

2. I am unable to appoint a SMO [SMNCO or PM] that meets the retainability requirement for
the following reasons: [include rank, name of individual to be appointed with this waiver,
expected date of departure, reason for departure, why another individual cannot be appointed that
can meet the retainability requirement, and any other pertinent information.]

3. Request a waiver be granted to [unit requesting waiver] for [rank, name] until [estimated
date]. At that time I intend to meet the requirement by [state corrective actions that will bring
the units program into compliance].



                                                                             [Signature]

                                    TABLE OF CONTENTS
NOTE: Electronic continuity books are authorized and encouraged. The overall structure
(folder hierarchy) of the e-book should match this attachment. At the PM/SMO’s discretion,
hard copies of critical sections may be maintained. A hard-copy showing the network path/route
to the e-book is mandatory. (For example: \\lfi-cs-
fas01\shared\myopsecprogram\best%20continuity%20binder%20ever)
NOTE: If the file is not actually put in the continuity book (either hard copy or electronic
continuity book) then specify at the appropriate Tab the location of the file. This could be
because of the large size of the file/document or because its classification precludes including in
the unclassified book/e-book. Example for a hard copy file location might be “IV 2 Threat
Assessment (S) found in Safe #3, Drawer 2, OPSEC folder, documents 2-5”. An example of an
electronic file might be “IV 2 Threat Assessment (S) found in XP sharedrive O-- \\lfi-cs-

                             SMWG MASTER ROSTER (T-3)

A7.1. (ANG) Note: The SMWG roster that starts on the next page is a list of typical flying
wing’s subject matter experts (SMEs) that should be considered as part of the unit SMWG.
Although the list is based on a flying unit, ANG unit SM personnel need to remember to identify,
train, and exercise SMWG personnel from all non-flying support units and functions within the
wing as well to ensure a complete wing SM capability. Remember that the example list is not
all-inclusive and may need to be amended to suit your particular unit location, mission, or
organizational structure. You may not need to use each and every functional area SME for a
particular SM exercise/operation, but you should try to work through the lower echelon group
and squadron commanders to have them appoint someone as a SMWG member. The SMWG
roster should also include tenant units assigned on the host installation. Where the ANG unit is
tenant on a non-ANG base, the ANG unit’s SM personnel must include the host unit SM
personnel as part of the ANG units SMWG. The SMWG master roster will be maintained as a
FOUO document when filled in with personnel data. The following privacy act statement must
be added to the roster when filled in with personal data. “This document contains FOR
OFFICIAL USE ONLY (FOUO) information which must be protected under the Privacy
Act and AFI 33-332.”

MEMORANDUM FOR HQ NGB/A3CC

FROM: (Your Wing)

Subject: (Signature Management Training Exercise Supporting Exercise Camel Jockey) or
(Signature Management Quarterly Training Exercise, FY 12/1) (U)

   1. (Classification) Overall Situation: This paragraph will contain a brief synopsis of the
      actual exercise taking place that SM will support. List the objective(s) of this exercise
      (objectives are those of the actual exercises, not the SM objectives).

   2. (Classification) Critical Information: List the critical information associated with the
      supported exercise (if no supporting exercise, critical information associated with the
      Wig that requires SMC support).

   3. (Classification) SM Collaboration: This paragraph will identify the tactics, techniques
      and procedures that will be used to protect the critical information. (i.e. Hangar four will
      hide/cover the identity of the deploying force, face to face communications will protect
      the coordination process for the deploying force or uniforms will be changed to hide
      actual identity of forces (patches/hats).

   4. (Classification) Base Threat Assessment: List the current threats that are present in the
      area that possibly collect information on your base. Data of this type may be found in the
      Base Threat Assessment published by OSI at the following SIPRNET website:
      Http://www.afosi.af.smil.mil/threatcenter/

   5. (Classification) SM Working Group (Trusted Agent) Composition: List all members
      with a working knowledge of the protective or exploitation measure(s) and those that will
      be used to portray events to assist the plan.
AFI10-701_ANGSUP 3 APRIL 2014                                                                  73


   6. (Classification) Exercise Overview: Discuss how you envision the SM scenario to
      unfold, (i.e. cover story presented, backstopping done to reinforce the cover story).
      Attach a draft/working copy of the developed SM execution checklist.

   7. (Classification) Feedback. Develop Measures of Performance (MOP). List the
      Measures that will be used to judge the performance of the SM execution checklist. (i.e.
      Was the Hangar guard posted at the exact time indicated on the checklist?)

   8. (Classification) After Action Report (AARs): Will include an evaluation of all of the
      above and any ideas for improvement. MOPs should be evaluated as to if an action item
      was to happen at a certain time or location, and did it take place, and as planned. AARs
      will be submitted within 15 days following termination of the exercise.

9.      Cost estimates, if any, will include specific US dollar amounts for each person that
directly supports the SM activity (i.e. per diem, travel, rental vehicles, lodging, etc.)
               74                                                                         AFI10-701_ANGSUP 3 APRIL 2014

                             SIGNATURE MANAGEMENT EXECUTION CHECKLIST (T-3)



LEGEND:

 D-Day = Unnamed day on which a particular operation commences or is to commence. Examples D-5, D, D+10

 INDICATORS: clues that cause disclosure of critical information by attracting the adversary’s attention.

      Signatures = Uniqueness (reduces the number of other indicators that must be observed to confirm a single indicator’s significance)

     Observables = events, activities, or elements of information that can be “seen” (perceived) by the target and his supporting information
system.

      Critical Information = factual information about friendly activities or operations

      Associations = relationships of an indicator to other information

      Profiles = functional activities that create unique signatures and associations which form one unique profile

      Contrasts = any difference between standard profile and current actions; deviations attract interest; why is there a change?

     Exposure = when and how long; observed duration, repetition and timing – limiting exposure reduces observable detail and
associations

 Termination implications = Consider both favorable and adverse circumstances that may arise during the course of the exercise/operation

 MOP (Measures of Performance) = measurements to determine the performance of a system/operation. Determine whether the planned
tasks were executed in the correct manner, at the correct time.

 MOE (Measures of Effectiveness) = measurements to determine the result/effects of a system/operation. Critical to understanding
whether or not the desired result/effect was achieved
