                                 GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Delegation of Authority. HQ Air Force Flight Standards Agency (AFFSA) is the USAF’s
executive agent for terminal area airfield operations (air traffic control and airfield management)
matters. In this capacity, HQ AFFSA will take policy guidance from the Air Staff and work
airfield operations procedural, training, standardization, and integration issues with the FAA,
International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), Host Nation (HN), and other agencies.
1.2. Scope and Purpose of this Instruction. This instruction provides guidance on managing,
operating and evaluating Airfield Operations (AO) services and facilities. AO is comprised of
air traffic control (ATC) and airfield management (AM) services. All AO flight personnel shall
refer to this instruction for details regarding the technical aspects of their responsibilities. For
operations at contingency locations, refer to AFMAN 13-220, Deployment of Airfield
Operations.
   1.2.1. Contract Locations. This AFI applies to contract locations as specifically outlined in
   the contract Statement of Work (SOW) and/or Performance Work Statement (PWS). (See
   para 3.3.2.5.)
   1.2.2. Use of this Instruction, Supplementation, and Application of FAA ATC Directives to
   the USAF. HQ AFFSA sets standards and procedures for internal AO facility operations.
   MAJCOMs may supplement USAF standards and procedures specified in this instruction
   with prior HQ AFFSA approval. Applicable portions of FAA Order (FAAO) JO 7210.3,
   Facility Operation and Administration, and FAAO 1900.47B, Air Traffic Services
   Contingency Plan have been incorporated into this instruction.
   1.2.3. Overseas Locations. While HN or international regulations adopted for USAF use in
   overseas areas take precedence, every effort should be made to conform to this instruction.
       1.2.3.1. HN regulations and procedures apply to USAF controllers who augment a civil
       or foreign ATC facility.
       1.2.3.2. MAJCOMs must identify these procedures and any applicable international
       regulations in their supplement to this AFI.
1.3. Waivers and Recommended Changes.
   1.3.1. Waiver Authority. HQ AFFSA is the waiver authority for this instruction.
   1.3.2. AF IMT 4058, Airfield Operations Policy Waiver. Use AF IMT 4058 to request
   waivers to this instruction. If additional space is required, annotate on plain bond paper and
   submit along with the form. Number each comment with the corresponding block number.
   In addition, units will submit an Operational Risk Management (ORM) Assessment in
   accordance with AFPAM 90-902, Operational Risk Management (ORM) Guidelines and
   Tools or alternate risk mitigation procedures with all waiver requests.
       1.3.2.1. The Airfield Operations Flight Commander (AOF/CC) forwards the AF IMT
       4058 through the Senior Operational Commander (e.g., OG/CC) to the MAJCOM OPR
       for AO, who will then coordinate and send to HQ AFFSA.

        1.3.2.2. Submit additional data (e.g., Letters of Procedure (LOP), airspace maps, traffic
        patterns, airfield diagrams) to substantiate the waiver request as required.
        1.3.2.3. To ensure a periodic revalidation of waiver requirements, HQ AFFSA normally
        grants AO waivers for two year periods. MAJCOMs may only approve temporary
        waivers for procedural or operational issues which their units can resolve within 6
        months. MAJCOMs will send an information copy of all temporary waiver approvals to
        HQ AFFSA.
        1.3.2.4. Waiver renewal requests must reach HQ AFFSA NLT 30 days prior to
        expiration.

                 UNIT-LEVEL QUALITY ASSURANCE REQUIREMENTS

2.1. Unit Self-Inspection. AOFs will conduct annual self-inspections using published ATSEP
checklists and SIIs located on the HQ AFFSA ATSEP Community of Practice (CoP.) Unit
commanders should use this tool as an internal assessment of AO health and to identify and
correct flight safety hazards and airfield and air traffic system problems. Report and document
results/completion of self-inspections at the next scheduled AOB.
2.1. (AFMC)Utilize Attachment 5 as the format for completing unit self-inspection
Functional Area Checklists (FAC).
     2.1.1. Staff Assistance Visits (SAV). Units may request a SAV from the MAJCOM AO staff
     to help resolve specific problems within functional areas. A SAV will normally not be
     conducted on a unit within 6 months of an ATSEP.
        2.1.1.1. (Added-AFMC) SAV requests must be submitted in writing by the
        Unit/Squadron           commander         to        HQ           AFMC/A3O           at
        AFMC.A3O.Workflow@wpafb.af.mil. HQ AFMC/A3O will schedule/conduct SAVs
        at fixed bases and contingency locations upon request, MAJCOM workload permitting.
        Unit-requested SAVs are unit-funded. SAV requests should contain specific areas of
        concern the unit wishes to evaluate (i.e. ATC Training, Airfield Markings, etc.). Site
        visits are not considered SAVs, and may be coordinated for various reasons between HQ
        AFMC/A3O and the unit.
2.2. Cooperative Quality Assurance and Safety Programs.
     2.2.1. Base Level Evaluations. Several base-level programs are designed to periodically
     assess the AOF’s integrated participation with other agencies in supporting the wing mission.
     These include evaluations such as Operational Readiness Exercises/Inspections (ORE/ORI)
     and Base Exercise Evaluations. See AFI 13-204, Vol 3, Airfield Operations Procedures and
     Programs for specific AOF actions regarding exercises.
     2.2.2. The AOF will support Wing Safety programs such as the BASH and the Mid-Air
     Collision Avoidance (MACA) Programs. Refer to AFI 91-202, The US Air Force Mishap
     Prevention Program for details regarding these programs.
2.3. Safety Reports. AFMAN 91-223, establishes and provides guidance for reporting Class E
safety events. The intent of reporting these events is not only to identify potentially hazardous
aviation practices or procedures at a local unit, but to disseminate information which might
prevent similar hazardous conditions at other USAF locations.
2.3. (AFMC)Safety Reports. Coordinate with the Installation Safety Office for mishap,
incident and hazard investigation and reporting. Do not delay notification as events are time
sensitive.”
     2.3.1. CMAVs. Report CMAVs, runway incursions using the AF IMT 457, USAF Hazard
     Report in accordance with AFI 91-204 and AFMAN 91-223.
        2.3.1.1. Report airfield infractions caused by aircraft, vehicles, or pedestrians entering
        the CMA without specific control tower approval.
AFI13-204V2_AFMCSUP_I 24 APRIL 2013                                                              9


   2.3.2. HATRs. Report HATR events using the AF IMT 651, in accordance with AFI 91-
   202, AFI 91-204, and AFMAN 91-223.
       2.3.2.1. Report any air traffic or hazardous movement area occurrence that endangers the
       safety of an aircraft or UAS.
       2.3.2.2. If unit level AOF services are identified as contributory/causal to the HATR, the
       AOF/CC must provide comments in the final HATR message prepared by the wing
       safety office. If the AOF/CC concurs with the content of the HATR, simply state,
       "AOF/CC concurs." If the AOF/CC non-concurs, specific details of the disagreement
       must be identified. Comments may also be added to clarify events, for the benefit of
       cross-tell to other airfield operations locations.
   2.3.3. Runway Incursion Operational Categories. For trend and analysis purposes, all
   runway incursions (CMAV/HATR) are further classified into three operational categories
   (Operational Error, Pilot Deviation, Vehicle/Pedestrian) as defined in Attachment 1. The
   AOF/CC and Safety Office will work as a team to assign operational categories. The
   AOF/CC will ensure these classifications are annotated in the recommendations section of
   the AF IMT 457 or the narrative section of the AF IMT 651.
   2.3.4. Units will notify their MAJCOM AOs within 24 hours of a CMAV/HATR incident.
       2.3.4.1. (Added-AFMC) Unit         will  notify HQ     AFMC/A3O          at
       AFMC.A3O.Workflow@wpafb.af.mil of a filed AF IMT 651, Hazardous Air Traffic
       Report (HATR) and include the following:
          2.3.4.1.1. (Added-AFMC) Location, Date, Local and Zulu Time, Aircraft/Vehicle,
          Unit or Command involved (if known) and a brief summary of incident.

   nearest General Aviation District Office, Flight Standards District Office, Air Carrier District
   Office or equivalent HN agency in accordance with FAAO 8020.16, Air Traffic Organization
   Aircraft Accident and Incident Notification, Investigation, and Reporting.
2.4. Flight Inspections. The flight inspection program is established to verify the performance
of air navigation services and associated instrument flight procedures. Flight inspection
frequency, coordination requirements and profiles of procedures flown are described in AFMAN
11-225, United States Standard Flight Inspection Manual. In keeping with guidelines in FAAO
JO 7110.65, Air Traffic Control, flight inspection aircraft should be given appropriate
operational priority to accomplish required pattern work. Prompt and accurate coordination
between affected AO facility managers, Air Traffic Control and Landing Systems (ATCALS)
maintenance personnel and the affected flying community is critical to ensuring successful and
expedient flight inspection services. The AOF/CC will track flight inspection completion dates
and next periodic evaluation requirement for all ATCALS, and brief upcoming flight inspection
requirements at the AOB.
2.5. Air Traffic Control Specialist (ATCS) Certificate and Control Tower Operator
(CTO). Only those personnel that possess a valid Air Traffic Control Specialist Certificate

      ATSEP team requirements (i.e., office space, computer support, and phones), a request
      for any locally identified items requiring special attention and ATSEP questionnaires (as
      determined and created by the MAJCOMs) along with instructions for their distribution,
      completion and collection. Note: The OG/CC and MSG/CC will acknowledge receipt
      and advise MAJCOM, NLT 30 days prior to scheduled evaluation date, of any
      requirements that cannot be met.
      3.2.2.4. (AFMC) Under the AOCI construct, HQ AFMC/A3O will also notify base-
      level operations support, civil engineering, and communications unit/squadron
      commanders by including them on the 45-day Notification Letter.

      evaluation.
      3.2.2.8. Develop ATSEP team member training program to ensure all team members are
      properly trained to perform evaluation to MAJCOM specified standards.
3.3. Evaluations: ATSEP evaluations shall be conducted in accordance with the guidelines
established in this AFI. There are two types of evaluations; initial and follow-up.
   3.3.1. Initial Evaluation. An evaluation will normally be conducted at each location every
   24 months, plus or minus 12 months. Evaluation frequency may be adjusted to support
   reducing the evaluation team “footprint” if the ATSEP is combined with other
   inspection/evaluation programs and for operational reasons at the discretion of the
   MAJCOM.
   3.3.2. Follow-up Evaluation. A follow-up evaluation may be conducted as deemed
   necessary by the MAJCOM AO staff. Normally, this determination will be based on the
   number of system deficiencies and potential/actual impact to safety of operations.
 18                                              AFI13-204V2_AFMCSUP_I 24 APRIL 2013


       3.3.2.1. Team members will assess wing/unit progress in correcting deficiencies and
       offer further recommendations, as applicable, to assist with the closure process.
       Evaluators will review documented action taken to correct previously identified
       deficiencies and confirm closure for those deficiencies that have been resolved. Note:
       Should a functional area follow-up evaluation be required, only the specific functional
       area will be re-evaluated.
       3.3.2.2. Follow-up evaluations will be completed within 12 months of the ATSEP and
       may be accomplished by an on-site visit or desk audit.
       3.3.2.3. MAJCOMs will advise the Wing/CV at least 30 days prior to conducting an on-
       site follow-up evaluation.
       3.3.2.4. Completion of a follow-up evaluation does not reset the ATSEP cycle; next
       ATSEP will normally be 24 months after the initial ATSEP.
       3.3.2.5. Contract Locations. MAJCOMs will determine whether ATSEP or quality
       assurance visits by a Subject Matter Expert (SME) quality assurance evaluator is
       appropriate at contracted locations.
3.4. Team Composition and Duties. The ATSEP team composition and scope of the
evaluation will depend primarily on levels of USAF functional responsibility within that airfield
and air traffic system. MAJCOMs should coordinate teams with full representation of the
functional areas subject to evaluation. The ATSEP team must be able to conduct an in-depth
evaluation ranging from comprehensive analysis of all airfield and air traffic system components
to completion of the compliance checklists. Civil Engineering, Safety, and Weather personnel
should participate as necessary to ensure an in-depth evaluation of system support functions.
ATSEP team composition and responsibilities include one or more of the following:
   3.4.1. Team Chief – The team chief is the lead for the air traffic system evaluations. The
   team chief is normally a field grade officer or civilian equivalent. They provide daily briefs
   to squadron and/or group leadership, as determined locally, on the progress of the evaluation
   and provide the in and out-briefs of ATSEP results to the Wing CV (or designated
   representative) and concerned base agency representatives.

      Object Damage (FOD) Working Group, Airfield Driving Meetings, and Wing Facility
      Board (include Power-Point slides).
      3.5.2.6. (Added-AFMC) All paperwork on runway incursions, controlled movement
      area violations, and airfield driving violations [i.e., AF IMT 457, USAF Hazard Report,
      AF IMT 651, Hazardous Air Traffic Report investigations, and Wing/CC Reinstatement
      letters].
3.6. Briefings. At a minimum, in-briefs, daily briefs, and out-briefs will be presented as
follows:
   3.6.1. Team In-brief. The Airfield Operations Flight Commander (AOF/CC) will coordinate
   and schedule the in-brief. The AOB Chairperson will ensure mandatory board members
   attend the in-brief. The ATSEP Team Chief will provide information that covers at least the
   following topics:
      3.6.1.1. Introduction of team members.
      3.6.1.2. Overview of ATSEP evaluation and reporting.
      3.6.1.3. Applicable SIIs and the evaluation process.

       instructions and the tracking and closing processes.
3.7. ATSEP/Unit Self Inspection Functional Area Checklists (FAC). HQ AFFSA functional
staff will develop the FAC (with references) for use by ATSEP evaluators. Download available
FACs on the HQ AFFSA ATSEP CoP to evaluate compliance with established guidance and
standards. A FAC is not regulatory; it only restates or paraphrases existing compliance
requirements. HQ AFFSA will request MAJCOM AO staffs input in the development of FACs.
MAJCOMs will be notified via message when new checklists are posted on the HQ AFFSA
ATSEP CoP. Each FAC is dated and should be immediately available to units for self-inspection
purposes. These checklists are not all inclusive and may be supplemented. HQ AFFSA will
determine when a new FAC is effective for ATSEP evaluations, based on scheduling and
reference requirements. Units should complete a self-inspection using new FAC within 60 days
of publication.
   3.7.1. Each FAC item is identified as either satisfactory or unsatisfactory. All applicable
   checklist items should be evaluated; those that do not apply shall be marked “Not
   Applicable” (N/A). Checklist items that are applicable, but cannot be evaluated due to
   unforeseen circumstances (e.g., continual bad weather at a tower only location or time
   constraints) must be annotated as “Not Observed” (N/O) and, therefore, not included in the
   results section of the ATSEP report.
   3.7.2. Each FAC is structured with an operational, training, quality assurance and
   administration section. Compliance items are arranged into these sections based on
   subjective content and relative importance. Individual checklist items in the “Operations”
   section are generally more critical to mission success than others, e.g., those in the
   “Administration” section. Additional sections may be broken out in certain functions such as
   ATC Tower, ATC Radar, and Airfield Driving.
   3.7.3. (Added-AFMC) Utilize Attachment 5 as the format for completing unit self-
   inspection FACs.
3.8. Knowledge Testing. ATSEP evaluators may administer general knowledge tests to gauge
the comprehension level of the respective functional areas.
3.9. Evaluation Areas. Evaluators will assess airfield and air traffic systems, interview key
personnel from wing organizations and adjacent airports, review local airfield procedures and
documentation, Weather, CE and Safety Office support to the airfield and air traffic systems.
The following areas will be evaluated for overall safety of operations (System Evaluation) and
conformity to checklist criteria based on written instructions (Compliance Evaluation.)
   3.9.1. ATC operations.
 22                                                 AFI13-204V2_AFMCSUP_I 24 APRIL 2013


   3.9.2. Airspace Management and configuration.
   3.9.3. TERPS.
   3.9.4. Interface with adjoining air traffic facilities.
   3.9.5. Airfield safety and compliance.
   3.9.6. AM.
   3.9.7. Airfield Driving Program/CMAVs.
   3.9.8. ATCALS maintenance.
   3.9.9. CE support of ATC, AM, ATCALS, and TERPS requirements (i.e., CE maps, airfield
   obstruction/waiver program, airfield signs/markings, auxiliary power, facility grounding and
   lightning protection, etc...).
   3.9.10. Safety awareness programs: public relations, MACA and BASH programs, etc...
   3.9.11. Weather support (e.g., cooperative weather watch and tower visibility reporting).
   3.9.12. Specialized requirements (local directives).
   3.9.13. ATC Automation.
   3.9.14. AOM.
3.10. Deficiencies. Each ATSEP evaluator will confirm initial identification of any deficiency
and give the evaluated unit an opportunity to clarify and/or rebut those areas, thereby avoiding
misunderstandings and improving accuracy. Validation will be initiated at the team member
level. Once deficiencies are validated, they are identified as a problem (FAC or Off-Checklist
Problem (OCP) or an observation to the Team Chief.
   3.10.1. Functional Area Checklist (FAC) Problem. FAC problem is a deficiency identified
   during a compliance evaluation that was found unsatisfactory for compliance with
   established standards. Open problems will be tracked at AOBs. Requests for closure will be
   forwarded via memo to the MAJCOM AO staff for approval.
       3.10.1.1. A group of related, deficient checklist problems may also constitute an
       “observation”. Associate deficient checklist problems with the applicable observation in
       the ATSEP report (i.e. “See observation 09-XXX-001”).
   3.10.2. Off-Checklist Problem (OCP). An OCP indicates non-compliance with regulatory
   guidance, including basic AF, Unified Facility Criteria (UFC), ICAO, HN, and FAA
   regulations that are identified through a means other than the FACs. MAJCOM
   supplemental requirements that are additional to existing FAC references (rather than simply
   making a standard requirement more restrictive) are considered OCPs. An OCP is not, by
   nature, any less significant than a checklist problem derived from a FAC. The functional
   area the OCP pertains to will accompany the deficiency (See example: Attachment 2). If
   more than one function is responsible, include each function in the deficiency. It is important
   to inform the unit of these deficiencies and to track them for possible adverse trends. HQ
   AFFSA will analyze OCPs for trends and may add related checklist items to subsequent
   FACs. Open off-checklist problems will be tracked at AOBs. Requests for closure will be
   forwarded via memo to the MAJCOM AO staff for approval.
AFI13-204V2_AFMCSUP_I 24 APRIL 2013                                                             23


   3.10.3. Observation. An observation is a deficiency which indicates actual or potential
   flying mission impact or an adverse affect on flight safety. Observations are system
   deficiencies and may include compilation of multiple compliance checklist problems. Open
   observations will be tracked at AOBs. Requests for closure will be forwarded via memo to
   MAJCOM/A3 for approval.
       3.10.3.1. A statement will be included with all observations that describe the flight safety
       hazard created by the act or observation, as well as the potential consequences of that
       hazard. This statement is generally a single phrase that expresses the condition created
       and how that could endanger persons or property and/or impact the mission.
       3.10.3.2. Root Cause Code. All observations will be assigned a cause code (see Table
       3.1). In many cases more than one cause code may be applicable. Root cause code
       options will be provided in a drop-down menu in the ARG. Note: Root causes will not
       be identified in final ATSEP report and will be used solely for Air Force/MAJCOM
       trends and analysis purposes.

3.11. Special Interest Items. Special Interest Items (SIIs) focus attention and corrective action
on relatively common, significant safety issues on the airfield or in the air traffic system. HQ
AFFSA determines annual AF-level ATSEP SIIs using trend data from the previous year’s (CY)
ATSEP reports and/or anticipating emergent issues with potential mission impact. HQ AFFSA
will request MAJCOM AO staff’s input in the development of SIIs. SIIs will be rated either
satisfactory or unsatisfactory based on criteria in the checklist. Each unsatisfactory SII shall
result in a single, corresponding observation. New SII data will be published following review
of previous year’s trends and analysis report unless a specific trend dictates early guidance.
   3.11.1. Because some SII checklists must be evaluated subjectively, one or more
   unsatisfactory item(s) in the body of the checklist does not automatically render the entire SII
   unsatisfactory. The SII would only be unsatisfactory if the extent and gravity of deficiency
   have mission impact or safety of flight implications, i.e., justifies an observation.
   3.11.2. MAJCOMs may develop and manage MAJCOM-specific SIIs as deemed necessary;
   however, each must be developed based on the same evaluation criteria as AF-level SIIs, i.e.,
   an unsatisfactory SII merits and results in a corresponding observation. MAJCOM
   developed SIIs must be sent to HQ AFFSA for review prior to implementation.
   3.11.3. Obtain SII information via HQ AFFSA CoP, as needed. Wings/units not evaluated
   during the active period of an SII will include the SII during their annual self-inspection and
   report results to HQ AFFSA and their MAJCOM AO Division.
3.12. ATSEP Assessment. Overall health of the air traffic system is composed of a
combination of two criteria: (1) (checklist items) the conformity index score, which is the
numerical percentage of total checklist/off-checklist items evaluated divided by the number of
“satisfactory” items, and (2) the number of observations.
3.13. ATSEP Reports
   3.13.1. Automated Reporting Procedures.
       3.13.1.1. To improve the reporting and trend analysis processes, HQ AFFSA has
       developed the ATSEP Report Generator (ARG) database located on the HQ AFFSA
       ATSEP CoP. ATSEP team members will use ARG to conduct evaluations, generate draft
       ATSEP reports and create evaluation databases to the maximum extent possible.
       3.13.1.2. Evaluators collect all resultant evaluation data on the ARG. ARGs can be
       downloaded from the HQ AFFSA ATSEP CoP.
       3.13.1.3. Use the ARG to order and edit the basic report content. ARG automatically
       assigns observation and problem tracking numbers. It also provides dropdown menus for
       available cause codes.
       3.13.1.4. ARG will automatically provide conformity index scores for each functional
       area and an overall score based on satisfactory checklist times. Note: At locations where
26                                              AFI13-204V2_AFMCSUP_I 24 APRIL 2013


     TERPS responsibility resides outside the unit (e.g. AFIPC or MAJCOM), the TERPS
     conformity index score will not count towards the overall unit conformity index score.
     3.13.1.5. Use the ARG report feature to print a draft report or export to a document file
     for final editing. Do not make substantive changes to the ATSEP report (e.g., adding or
     deleting problems and observations or changes to tracking numbers) after exporting ARG
     data to a document file.
     3.13.1.6. In those unusual cases when system and compliance evaluations are conducted
     separately, do not include information in sections used for the other type evaluation.
     Normally SII observations would not be included in a compliance-only report . Issues
     that inadvertently become apparent and might otherwise warrant an observation should
     be addressed in the executive summary of compliance-only reports.
     3.13.1.7. ATSEP reports must be marked "FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY" when filled out
     and handled accordingly. The ARG automatically provides this marking.
     3.13.1.8. Do not use technical jargon other than equipment nomenclature followed by the
     equipment type/name.
  3.13.2. ATSEP Report Content. Normally, ATSEP reports will include: Section I, Executive
  Summary; Section II, SIIs and Observations; Section III, Checklist and OCPs; and Section
  IV, General Information.
  3.13.3. Section I, Executive Summary. Include, as a minimum, the following:
     3.13.3.1. Purpose and Scope. Use the purpose and scope statements from the sample
     report (Attachment 2) that are applicable to the evaluated system.
     3.13.3.2. Executive Summary. The Executive Summary must give the host operational
     commander an overview of the ATSEP team's perception of the air traffic system's
     capability to support the flying mission (system evaluation) and how well the AO and
     ATCALS maintenance personnel and facilities comply with established standards
     (compliance evaluation). It should also address significant base support functions, such
     as CE, that have a direct impact on mission accomplishment. Remarks should include
     comments on the sustainability of the air traffic system, summarized SII results (e.g., 5
     SIIs evaluated, 2 were unsatisfactory), an abbreviated list of observations and a summary
     of problems identified. Additionally, annotate problems that do not meet observation
     criteria but may lead to degradation of mission effectiveness if unresolved. Examples are
     limitations or proposals to the airfield or air traffic system that cannot be resolved locally
     or items that impact the air traffic system that are beyond the host operational
     commander's jurisdiction. Identify any significant positive influence on the air traffic
     system environment (a system capability--not individual personality).
  3.13.4. Section II, Special Interest Items (SII) and Observations.
     3.13.4.1. Special Interest Items (SII). List all applicable SIIs and their evaluation results.
     Every unsatisfactory SII must refer to a corresponding observation.
     3.13.4.2. Observations. This section includes all observations, problem statement with
     risk levels, discussion, and recommendation statements. Each observation must contain
     the following elements:
AFI13-204V2_AFMCSUP_I 24 APRIL 2013                                                          27


         3.13.4.2.1. Problem Statement. The observation statement must clearly state the
         deficiency and define the mission impact or safety of flight implications.
         3.13.4.2.2. Discussion. The discussion should contain information that supports the
         observation.. The discussion is also the appropriate place to include unit or wing
         input.
         3.13.4.2.3. Recommendation. The recommendation should indicate any possible
         means to correct the deficiency and specifically address the agency/office best able to
         correct the deficiency. Recommendations will be based on previous successful
         actions to close observations or best practices learned through experience.
         3.13.4.2.4. MAJCOM AO staff should coordinate with appropriate collateral staff
         agencies for assistance in determining correct resolutions regarding deficiencies
         outside their area of responsibility.
         3.13.4.2.5. Closely coordinate with MAJCOM/Wing leadership for observations that
         may result in suspension of aircraft operations on the airfield, runway, taxiway, or
         apron. This option shall be used if operational safety requires it and all other means
         for timely correction of an unsafe condition, or assuring safe aircraft operations,
         cannot be achieved.
     3.13.4.3. Observations will be identified by a unique tracking number consisting of the
     last two digits of the calendar year, the four-letter facility identifier and a sequence
     number (e.g., 03-EGUL-002). If a follow-up or sequential evaluation is conducted in the
     same year, add an alpha-character to the two-digit year portion for any new observations
     (e.g., 03A-EGUL-001).
     3.13.4.4. Any observation that remains open from previous ATSEP reports shall be
     included and identified as a repeat observation. Repeat observations retain the tracking
     number from the previous report. Restate the observation verbatim from the previous
     report and document progress made at the end of the recommendation section.
     Recommendations for resolution actions may be modified, if warranted, in this
     addendum. Repeat observations are not necessarily more significant than newer
     observations, but they are usually sequenced first in reports to emphasize the importance
     of timely resolution.
     3.13.4.5. An observation from a previous report that was officially closed but reoccurs is
     considered a new observation for the purpose of tracking and standardization. Assign a
     new tracking number and do not refer to it as a “repeat.”
  3.13.5. Section III, Checklist Problems and Off-Checklist Problems.
     3.13.5.1. Checklist Problems will be identified by a tracking number consisting of the
     last two digits of the calendar year, the four-letter aerodrome identifier, the function
     evaluated and the sequential order of the observation in the report (e.g., 03-EGUL-ATC-
     001). If a follow-up or sequential evaluation is conducted in the same year, add an alpha-
     character to the two-digit year portion (e.g., 03A-EGUL-ATC-004). The actual FAC
     number will be included on the same line as the tracking number (e.g. Checklist Item:
     ATC 007). The following identifiers must be used for specific functional area checklist
     items:
 28                                               AFI13-204V2_AFMCSUP_I 24 APRIL 2013

       3.13.5.2. Off-Checklist Problems. OCPs will be annotated in the ATSEP report
       following checklist problems in Section III. They will be tracked by assigning an OCP
       number (e.g., 03-EGUL-OCP-001). The functional area assigned the OCP will also be
       included on the same line as the OCP tracking number (e.g. Functional Area: CE).
       Appropriate compliance reference(s) shall be included with each problem statement.
Use identifiers listed above (para 3.14.5.1.) for OCPs to include the following: (Note: Others
may be used as applicable.)
CE--Civil Engineering

       3.13.5.3. A list of problems, unresolved from previous compliance evaluations but
       validated as closed during the current evaluation, may be included at the end of this
       section.
   3.13.6. Section IV, General Information.
       3.13.6.1. At locations where TERPS responsibility resides outside the unit, the TERPS
       executive summary and any TERPS deficiencies will be provided as FYI only. This will
       provide base leadership visibility on their TERPS procedures/deficiencies while not
       unfairly holding the unit accountable for a program outside their scope of responsibility.
       3.13.6.2. Reply Instructions. State unit responsibilities after receipt of the final report,
       including specific correspondence and resolution procedures not provided elsewhere
       (e.g., by MAJCOM supplement).
       3.13.6.3. Personnel Contacted. List key personnel who were interviewed, briefed or
       otherwise contributed to the report.
       3.13.6.4. Distribution. List all agencies/offices to receive copies of the report. Include
       the number of copies for each. Minimum list is in Attachment 2. (Contract locations:
       Send copy to contracting office).
3.14. Problem and Observation Closure Instructions. The Wing/CV or designated
representative shall convene the AOB within 30 days after receiving the ATSEP report to
address observations and actions taken to resolve deficiencies. The AOB is the primary forum
AFI13-204V2_AFMCSUP_I 24 APRIL 2013                                                            29


for resolving problems and observations. AOB meeting minutes shall reflect action taken or
planned for each observation and include the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) for each
reported item. Status of open observations and their estimated closure dates shall be reflected in
AOB meeting minutes until actions are complete. Official approval notification should be the
final AOB meeting minutes entry for each observation closed. AOB meeting minutes shall be
marked “FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY” when they include ATSEP report observations. Note 1:
A problem and observation cannot be closed until the core issues that warrant the write-up has
been fully resolved and management control has been taken to prevent recurrence of these
significant issues. Note 2: During the first AOB following receipt of final ATSEP report, units
complete a risk assessment and assign a risk level (extremely high, high, medium, or low)
associated with each observation using the below matrix and AFPAM 90-902, Operational Risk
Management (ORM) Guidelines and Tools to assess the severity and probability of risk.

   implementation and management control.
       3.14.1.1. Implementation. Explain the measures/activities accomplished to ensure
       appropriate resolution action was initiated and completed.
       3.14.1.2. Management Control. Explain the management control plan or action
       implemented to prevent recurrence of the conditions that warranted the deficiency.
   3.14.2. The AOF/CC shall initiate respective deficiency closure requests as directed by
   MAJCOM AO staffs. Most problems must be monitored for a sufficient time to ensure
   management controls prevent recurrence.

   3.14.3. The Wing will request MAJCOM AO staff’s approval for closure actions in a memo
   for all problems and OCPs. The Wing will request MAJCOM A3 approval for closure
   actions in a memo for all observations and SIIs.
      3.14.3.1. (Added-AFMC) AFMC Problem and OCP closure requests. Units are
      required to request AOCI closures utilizing the example spreadsheet in Attachment 6 of
      this supplement. For all problems and OCPs, update the AOCI Tracker Closure Request
      and submit to AFMC/A3O via e-mail at AFMC.A3O.Workflow@wpafb.af.mil.
      3.14.3.2. (Added-AFMC) AFMC          Observation      and     SII    closure  requests.
      Recommendations for observation closure will be noted in the AOB minutes. When AOB
      minutes include AOCI observations, the minutes must be marked ―FOR OFFICIAL
      USE ONLY. Official requests for closure will be staffed via official memorandum/e-SSS
      by      the   Wing/CC      and      forwarded        to     HQ        AFMC/A3O       at
      AFMC.A3O.Workflow@wpafb.af.mil. HQ AFMC/A3 is the closure authority for
      observations.
   3.14.4. Problems and OCPs remaining open from prior ATSEPs may be closed by
   MAJCOM AO staffs during a subsequent ATSEP if the ATSEP team finds the items
   satisfactory. Any problems closed out by this method will be identified in the final ATSEP
   report.
   3.14.5. MAJCOM or AFIPC, as applicable, will provide units or MAJCOMs quarterly
   updates on TERPS deficiencies identified at locations where TERPS responsibility resides
   outside the unit.
3.15. (Added-AFMC) Outstanding Performer Program. The purpose of this program is to
recognize unit’s junior members’ superior performance evaluated during an AOCI. This award
program is focused on an individual’s performance either in preparation for an AOCI or for
above-and-beyond duty performance witnessed by an evaluator during an AOCI. These
individuals will be formally recognized during out-brief presentation.

               AIR FORCE RUNWAY SAFETY ACTION TEAM (AFRSAT)

4.1. Program Objectives. AFRSATs provide an objective perspective runway safety issues
such as runway incursions/excursions to reduce imminent negative trends or unsafe conditions
identified through trend and analysis, mishap reports, HATR, or hazard reports. AFRSAT visits
may be directed by HAF or MAJCOM, or may be requested by individual units.
4.2. Program Scope. AFRSATs are used to analyze, report and determine corrective actions
for AO and support agencies for safety, compatibility and adequacy related to runway safety.
The AFRSAT functional experts will evaluate all pertinent areas that are a part of, or affect, the
negative trend or unsafe condition.
   4.2.1. Team Composition. Team composition will be based on the area(s) being evaluated.
   4.2.2. Qualifications. Individuals qualified to assume ATSEP team duties are also qualified
   to conduct AFRSATs. It is recommended AFRSATs members shadow regional FAA
   RSATs prior to conducting AFRSATs. MAJCOM AOs will coordinate with their respective
   FAA regional runway safety office.
   4.2.3. Scheduling AFRSAT Visits.
       4.2.3.1. MAJCOM AO staff will schedule AFRSAT visits based on results of data
       analysis identifying negative trends or unsafe conditions at locations under their
       oversight. Notify units a minimum of 45 days prior to AFRSAT visits. Schedule
       changes will be provided as they occur.
       4.2.3.2. Bases may request AFRSATs to visit their installations at any time, however a
       minimum of 45 days is needed to schedule the AFRSAT.
       4.2.3.3. In preparation for the AFRSAT visit, the team lead will obtain all applicable
       documents from the unit being evaluated a minimum of 15 days prior to the visit. In
       addition, all data (MISHAP/Accident/CMAV reports) pertaining to the AFRSAT visit
       will be analyzed and evaluated for trends.
       4.2.3.4. Prior to the AFRSAT departing, normally the team lead will hold a preliminary
       meeting with team members to discuss the AFRSAT visit and the strategy for the event.
       4.2.3.5. The AFRSAT will include an in-brief and out-brief to the Wing/CV or their
       designated representative. Members in attendance should include AO (AOF/CC, ATC
       Tower, Airfield Manager), Flight/Ground Safety, Radio Maintenance, flying unit
       representatives, and individual units as applicable.
   4.2.4. Evaluation. The AFRSAT will use the applicable checklist developed by HQ AFFSA
   found on the HQ AFFSA Standardization and Evaluation Division CoP.
   4.2.5. Plan. The AFRSAT will help the unit develop a plan to correct the negative trend or
   unsafe condition within 15 days of the visit. The plan will include:
       4.2.5.1. Overview of the negative trend or unsafe condition.
       4.2.5.2. Statistics/data supporting     the   negative    trend   or   unsafe    condition
       (Mishap/CMAV/ Accident reports).

     4.2.5.3. The current airport diagram displaying the location of the negative trend/unsafe
     condition, as applicable.
     4.2.5.4. A listing of problem areas and/or contributing causes to the individual events
     leading to the negative trend/unsafe condition. Each problem area discovered will
     include a recommendation to correct the problem.
     4.2.5.5. The designated unit within the wing who is responsible for tracking and
     monitoring the action items and for providing a status update to MAJCOM AO staff
     every 90 days or as requested.
     4.2.5.6. The plan will be properly designated “For Official Use Only.”
     4.2.5.7. MAJCOM AO staff will forward the plan to HQ AFFSA within 30 days of
     completion of the AFRSAT’s visit.
  4.2.6. MAJCOM AO staff will conduct follow-up within 6 months after the AFRSAT visit.
  A follow-up at a minimum will include a table-top review (teleconference) to discuss the
  status of all action items. If necessary, another site visit will be conducted. The table-top
  review will be documented and the results published to all attendees.
AFI13-204V2_AFMCSUP_I 24 APRIL 2013                                                           33

                                  TREND AND ANALYSIS

5.1. Responsibilities. HQ AFFSA will be responsible for producing an annual trend and
analysis report on the following programs: ATSEP, AFRSAT, HATR, CMAV, BASH, and
MISHAPs. The report shall be completed NLT 1 Apr of the following calendar year.
5.2. Objectives. As a means of translating the results of AF Safety Center information and
ATSEP reports into actionable information, a Trends and Analysis report will be compiled for
MAJCOM and HQ USAF/A3O review. Each functional area of responsibility will be addressed
to illustrate the primary topics of concern and should allow for AO personnel to assess those
areas at their own locations. By using the information provided, HQ AFFSA will develop SIIs
for future ATSEP evaluations. Reports will reflect the most recent three years worth of trend
information, and should represent a true picture of the health of the AF as a whole, and not just
the bases looked at during a single year of ATSEP evaluations.
   5.2.1. HQ AFFSA will conduct an in-depth trend analysis, assess the sufficiency of
   corrective actions to ATSEP observations and provide observation status and metrics on an
   annual basis in a Trend and Analysis Report to the MAJCOMs on behalf of HAF/A3O. The
   Executive Summary and Trends and Analysis Reports are exempt from RCS licensing in
   accordance with AFI 33-324, The Information Collection and Reports Management
   Program; Controlling Internal, Public, and Interagency Air Force Information Collections.
5.3. Trend & Analysis Sub-reports. HQ AFFSA will work with the AF Safety Center on the
following reports:
   5.3.1. HATR Report. Each HATR will be evaluated to determine the root causes and to
   evaluate the need for possible additional training.
   5.3.2. CMAV Report. CMAV reports will be monitored to identify emergent trends and
   identify corrective action.
   5.3.3. Wildlife/BASH Report. Wildlife/BASH reports will be monitored to detect trends
   on/around the airfield or in the air traffic system.
   5.3.4. Class A-E MISHAP Report. Class A-E MISHAP reports will include data from
   aircraft MISHAPs on the airfield or in the air traffic system.

Terms
Air Traffic System—All ATC, ATCALS, airfield and associated functions supporting the flying
mission at a particular location. Although normally centered on a single, terminal environment,
this may include enroute control, range complexes and multiple airfields.
Compliance Evaluation—The major component of ATSEP that evaluates specific functional
areas within the air traffic system for compliance with USAF, FAA and MAJCOM requirements.
Controlled Movement Area (CMA)—As defined in Airfield Operations Instructions, any
portion of the airfield requiring aircraft , vehicles and pedestrians to obtain specific Air Traffic
Control approval for access (normally via two-way radio contact with the control tower).
Controlled Movement Areas include but are not limited to areas used for takeoff, landing and as
required taxiing of aircraft. Note: This definition is used in lieu of "movement area" as defined
in the FAA Pilot Controller Glossary. Also called CMA.
Controlled Movement Area Violation (CMAV) Event—An airfield infraction caused by
aircraft, vehicles, or pedestrians entering the control movement area without specific control
tower approval. This definition includes runway incursions and infractions caused by
communication errors. Refer to AFMAN 91-223 for reportable HATR reporting procedures and
for reportable CMAV events.

Follow—up Evaluation—When deemed necessary by MAJCOM, a formal assessment,
conducted within 12 months of a previous ATSEP evaluation, of wing/unit progress in correcting
identified deficiencies.
Hot Spot—A runway safety related problem area or intersection on an airfield. Typically it is a
complex or confusing taxiway/taxiway or taxiway/runway intersection. A confusing condition
may be compounded by a miscommunication between a controller and a pilot, and may cause an
aircraft separation standard to be compromised. The area may have a history of surface incidents
or the potential for surface incidents.
Knowledge Testing—General knowledge tests administered by evaluators to gauge the
comprehension level of functional areas and for trend analysis purposes.
Observation— An observation is a deficiency which indicates actual or potential flying mission
impact or an adverse affect on flight safety. Observations are system deficiencies and may
include compilation of multiple compliance checklist problems.
Off—Checklist Problem—A deficiency identified during a compliance evaluation indicating
non-compliance with regulatory guidance (including additional MAJCOM requirements), but not
resulting from a standard functional area checklist.
Problem—A deficiency identified during a compliance evaluation that indicates a functional
area checklist item was found unsatisfactory for compliance with established standards
(including more restrictive MAJCOM requirements) at the time it was evaluated.
Runway Incursion—Any occurrence at an aerodrome involving the incorrect presence of an
aircraft, vehicle or person on the protected area of a surface designated for the landing and take-
off of aircraft. For the purpose of this instruction, the protected area is the same as the CMA.
These are further classified into three operational categories:
1) Operational Error (OE)—A failure of the air traffic control system that results in loss of
separation.
2) Pilot Deviation (PD)—The action of a pilot that results in the violation of ATC instructions,
AFIs and/or FARs.
3) Vehicle/Pedestrian Deviation (V/PD)—Any entry or movement on the controlled movement
area by a vehicle (including aircraft operated by non-pilots) or pedestrian that has not been
authorized by Air Traffic Control.
Repeat Observation—An observation that remains open from a previous report. This term is
not applied to a previously closed observation that recurs.
Special Interest Item—Subjective checklists used during a system evaluation to focus attention
and corrective action on emergent or relatively common and significant issues. By design, an
unsatisfactory special interest item results in a corresponding observation.
System Evaluation—The major component of ATSEP that evaluates, from an operational
viewpoint, the air traffic system for safety, compatibility and adequacy for all users.
Tracking Number—A unique, alphanumeric code assigned to each observation to facilitate the
resolution process and trend analysis.

EVALUATION PROGRAM REPORT



Blank AFB, 27-31 July 2009



FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY (when filled)



Section I - Executive Summary

Purpose and Scope:



This evaluation was conducted to provide an assessment of the quality, adequacy, and safety of
the air traffic system supporting flying operations at Blank AFB. It included an evaluation of:
airfield safety, air traffic system capability; air traffic and flight procedures; Airfield Operations
Management (AOM); Air Traffic Control (ATC); Airfield Management (AM); Airfield (AFLD);
Terminal Instrument Procedures (TERPS); ATC Automation; Air Traffic Control and Landing
Systems (ATCALS) support; Weather (WX) support; and Civil Engineering (CE) support .
Comprehensive checklists were used to evaluate ATC, AM, TERPS, and ATCALS maintenance
for compliance with published guidance. This report identifies two levels of deficiencies: (1)
Observations: Airfield and air traffic system deficiencies that indicate adverse flight safety or
flying mission impact, and (2) Problems: Unsatisfactory checklist items in specific functional
areas which reflect noncompliance with standards.



Executive Summary:
AFI13-204V2_AFMCSUP_I 24 APRIL 2013                                                               41


The Blank AFB air traffic systems provide safe, efficient service to all users. The Control
Tower, RAPCON, and Airfield Management facility interface well and work cohesively with
base agencies. Interviews with the aviation community and review of pilot questionnaires
revealed total satisfaction with the military airfield and air traffic system operation. The Mid Air
Collision Avoidance (MACA) program requires increased attention to ensure a safe flying
environment continues for military and civilian users.



Two Special Interest Items (SIIs) were evaluated; one was identified as unsatisfactory: Two
observations were written. One is a repeat major observation (still open) from the July 2005
evaluation about the alternate control tower facility and the other is an observation that concerns
qualifications of the AOF/CC.



AO facilities/functions and ATCALS maintenance were evaluated for compliance

with mandatory guidance and standards. Of 500 checklist items evaluated, 9 problems were
written. Additionally, one off-checklist problem was identified.



Section II – Special Interest Items (SIIs) and Observations

(These items affect or have the potential to affect the flying mission or flight safety)



A. Special Interest Items:



AF SII 200801 13MX Airfield Operations Officer Training and Ratings

Result: Unsatisfactory. See Observation 09-XXX-001.



AF SII 200802 Airfield Lighting

Result: Satisfactory



B. Observations:
 42                                               AFI13-204V2_AFMCSUP_I 24 APRIL 2013




(05-XXX-001)                                 REPEAT

The alternate control tower facility is unusable due to deteriorating window seals and
unserviceable communications equipment. The condition of the facility makes it unusable by
ATC controllers and can impact aircraft operations in the event of a tower evacuation.

Discussion: The Runway Control Structure (RCS) is designated as the alternate control tower in
the event the primary control tower is evacuated or becomes unusable. The RCS has not been
properly maintained. The multi-channel radios installed in the RCS are not capable of handling
mission essential communications during fixed facility evacuation periods.



Recommendation: XX OSS/OSA should:

a. Ensure a higher priority is placed on CE work requests and assist in developing a periodic
schedule for maintenance of the RCS.

b. Initiate a requirement for installation of fixed UHF/VHF radios and frequencies matching
those located in the fixed facility.



UPDATE 2008: Adequate multi-channel radios have been acquired and are ready to be installed;
however, the RCS structure has degraded to the point that a new facility is required. No viable
alternative sites are available and the estimated replacement cost is $500K. Discussion in AOB
minutes indicates that an alternate tower may no longer be required due to reduced mission
flying and availability of alternate airfields. The Wing/CV should determine the need for
alternate ATC facilities in accordance with AFI 13-204, Vol 3 and either proceed with a
replacement project or recommend closure.



(09-XXX-001)

The officer assigned to the AOF/CC position is not an AFSC 13MX and, therefore, is unable to
obtain/maintain AFI 13-204, Vol 1 certification or monitor requirements.

Discussion: AFSC 13MX officers are required to complete ATC and AM training as well as
facility ratings at Officers Training Program locations prior to any assignment as an AOF/CC or
AOF/DO. Without this in-depth education and training background, an officer is ill equipped to
assume the responsibilities associated with an AOF.
AFI13-204V2_AFMCSUP_I 24 APRIL 2013                                                             43


Recommendation: The OSS/CC is responsible for managing manpower authorizations and
ensuring qualified personnel are assigned. Immediate steps, through appropriate channels, should
be taken to request assignment action for a 13MX to fill the AOF/CC position.

SAMPLE AFRSAT REPORT

UNITED STATES AIR FORCE

RUNWAY SAFETY ACTION TEAM REPORT



Blank AFB, 27-31 July 2010



FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY (When filled)



Section I - Executive Summary



Purpose and Scope:

This AFRSAT visit was initiated as a result of Blank AFB having the third highest number of
runway incursions in 2009. It included: an evaluation of management of the airfield driving
program; air traffic and flight procedures; airfield infrastructure, Squadron Airfield Driving
Program Management (ADPM) and Wing Safety. This report includes recommendations
proposed to the Wing/CC to help reduce the number of runway incursions.

Overview: Blank AFB has adequate procedures in place to promote runway safety. All units and
agencies interviewed displayed a high level of experience and knowledge of the runway
incursion problem. Personnel expressed significant interest in reducing the number of runway
incursions, and welcomed any inputs by the team. Blank AFB is a 24/7 airfield, averaging more
than 55K runway operations per a year. There are multiple types of aircraft missions; helicopter
operations, unmanned aircraft, fighter and mobility operations. Assigned aircraft include C-130s,
and B-1s.



Wing Leadership: The Wing leadership is keenly aware of their runway incursion trend and have
aggressively implemented several measures that have already shown progress in reducing the
number of runway incursions. The following actions have been taken:
 50                                              AFI13-204V2_AFMCSUP_I 24 APRIL 2013


1.    Installed runway guard lights at taxiway Hotel at Runway 36 and repainted airfield
markings

2.    Created a Runway Incursion Board to evaluate runway incursions and make
recommendations for improvements.

3.     Initiated project to build perimeter road around the approach end of Runway 24.



Airfield Configuration: Blank AFB has three runways: runways 18R/36L, 18L/36R and 6/24.
Runway 6/24 is the primary instrument runway. Runway 6 and 36L cross each other at their
approach end. Aircraft must taxi across runway 36L on taxiway Hotel to get to the approach end
of Runway 6 and normally taxi down Runway 6 to takeoff the full length of runway 36L. This
particular intersection (36L & Hotel) contributed to 45% of all runways. Another “Hot Spot” for
runway incursions is access to the Army Ramp on the South side of the airfield. For vehicles to
get to where the Army helicopters are parked, drivers must cross the approach end of Runway
24. This crossing accounted for 30% of all runway incursions. See airfield diagram, Attachment
1.



Air Traffic Control: The control tower provides excellent view of all runways. The height of the
Control Tower, and it’s location from the runways are adequate. An almost constant flow of
aircraft and vehicular traffic emphasize the need for positive control and keen situational
awareness by the controllers. Controllers received additional training on Controlled Movement
Area Violations (CMAV) /Runway Incursions, and incorporated a “Lessons Learned” document
for all controllers to review in the facilities Recent Information File (RIF). Controllers are
keenly aware of the runway incursion potential and pay particular attention to runway crossing
procedures to ensure the safety of operations while meeting the flying mission requirements.



Airfield Management: Airfield Management is effectively managing the Airfield Driving
Training Program and airfield safety. The Airfield Manager and Deputy Airfield Manager have
taken positive steps to improve training of airfield drivers and improve airfield markings and
signs. Runway incursions are briefed at the Airfield Operations Board. The Wing’s Airfield
Driving Program is extremely large and challenging with 40 units. Currently, Airfield
Management tests all airfield drivers. On average more than 200 personnel are tested each
month. There were several areas discovered should be improved on the airfield to include
airfield markings and signs. The Airfield Driving Training Program was adequate, however
several changes are recommended to improve the overall management of the program and the
training of airfield drivers.
AFI13-204V2_AFMCSUP_I 24 APRIL 2013                                                                 51


Airfield Driving Program Managers: The team evaluated 20 unit airfield driving training
programs and found that 20% were not managing their program in accordance with local
guidance. More than 50 drivers were checked for AF IMT 483 and several drivers were
discovered did not have them. The units ADPMs were notified and an investigation into those
organizations found several problems with personnel in-processing, lack of supervision
involvement and program management.

Section II – Trend Analysis



A thorough analysis was conducted of all CMAVs and Hazardous Air Traffic Reports (HATRs)
runway incursions that occurred over the past five years (Figure A3.1). In 2009, Blank AFB had
a 9% increase in the number of runway incursions from 2008. Thus far in 2010, there have
already been 12 runway incursions with five months left in this year.

Figure A3.1. Blank AFB Runway Incursion Trends.




Historically, the months of June, September, and November are peak months for runway
incursions. These time frames appear to be high traffic periods due to scheduled exercises and
the influx of new and inexperienced airfield drivers significantly contributes to the increase in
incursions. (Figure A3.2)
 52                                                AFI13-204V2_AFMCSUP_I 24 APRIL 2013


Figure A3.2. Runway Incursions by Month.




Similar to Air Force trend data, Aircraft Maintenance, Security Forces and Civil Engineering
have committed the most runway incursions on the airfield (54%). These organizations have the
majority of the airfield drivers and due to the airfield layout are required to cross the runways at

Section III - Problems and Recommendations

Airfield:
AFI13-204V2_AFMCSUP_I 24 APRIL 2013                                                               53


1. Problem: Several runway hold position sign’s internal lighting was inoperative for extended
periods. Taxiway A1 is missing a runway hold sign. Also, the runway hold sign is not
collocated with the runway hold marking at several locations. Work orders and NOTAMs are
submitted to correct/mitigate these problems.



Recommendation: Immediately repair runway hold signs. Ensure a bench stock of replacement
parts is available to repair frequent outages. Install runway hold sign on taxiway A1. Ensure a
runway hold sign is installed adjacent to all runway hold lines.



2. Problem: Several runway hold line markings are faded, non-reflective or barely visible on
taxiways leading to runway 18L/36R. In addition, several old runway hold lines have been
blacked out instead of being removed, thus leading to confusion on where the actual hold lines
are located. IAW AFI 32-1042, runway hold lines cannot be blacked out, they must be
removed.



Recommendation: As required, repaint new runway hold lines and markings for Runway
18L/36R and other taxiways and aprons. Immediately contract or gain the capability to remove
old runway hold lines. Consider power washing runway hold line markings that are barely
visible due to dirt obscuring the marking.



Air Traffic Control:

3. Problem: Several phraseology errors were consistently noted. Specifically, phraseology
pertaining to observed abnormalities and intra-facility coordination for runway crossings.



Recommendation: Increased training and facility management oversight is required to reduce
and identified these coordination and phraseology errors. Ensure phraseology used is IAW
FAAO JO 7110.65, Ch 2-7, 9 & 10.



4. Problem: Construction floodlights create a glare in the Control Tower reducing visibility of
controllers.
 54                                               AFI13-204V2_AFMCSUP_I 24 APRIL 2013


Recommendation: CE and Airfield Operations must ensure there is close coordination with the
Control Tower before starting construction projects using floodlights for night operations.



Airfield Management:

5. Problem: Procedures are not developed for contractor personnel to receive training on airfield
safety and airfield driving requirements before work can commence on the airfield.

Recommendation: Ensure these procedures are not delineated in airfield construction contracts.

6. Problem: There is limited use of local resources to educate/inform airfield users on runway
incursion prevention.



Recommendation: Utilize local resources, base paper, bulletins, commander’s channel, locally
developed posters/advertisements, etc. to provide updates, promote runway incursion prevention
and lessons learned information to airfield drivers.



Airfield Driving:

7. Problem: Training criteria and procedures for issuing AF 483s are not included in the current
airfield driving instruction.

Recommendation: Immediately rewrite the airfield driving instruction and ensure compliance
with AFI 13-213.

8. Problem: Not all airfield drivers are completing all local training required by local Airfield
Driving Instruction (ADI) or supplemental messages. The Blank AFB Airfield Driving
PowerPoint slide presentation and training video are not clearly delineated as required trainings
item for all airfield drivers.



Recommendation: Immediately provide all official training material to ADPMs. Ensure all
training requirements are specifically identified in Blank AFB ADI, to include any local video
training, PowerPoint slides, etc.



9. Problem: Not all vehicles operating in the Controlled Movement Area (CMA) have mobile
radios installed in the vehicle.
AFI13-204V2_AFMCSUP_I 24 APRIL 2013                                                               55




Recommendation: To the maximum extent possible, require the installation of mobile radios in
all vehicles that routinely operate in the CMAs. Use handheld radios as a backup. Ensure all
personnel who operate a vehicle on the runway and CMA are trained on how to operate radios
and effectively communicate with ATC.



10. Problem: No checklists are being used to complete the day and night orientations or practical
airfield drivers test.



Recommendation: Develop and utilize a checklist for airfield driver trainers to use when
conducting the airfield driving orientations and practical driving test. A checklist will ensure all
airfield drivers are shown all required areas of the airfield and complete all required training
during practical drivers test.

3.7. for dimensions and slopes. Note: Trees must be removed or trimmed to ten
feet below the point where they penetrate the imaginary surface.

2.5. Are all violations along the taxiways documented? (The required clearance
from taxiway centerline to fixed or mobile obstacles (taxiway clearance line) is:
Class A: Min 45.72m [150ft]; Class B: Min 60.96m [200ft] This area is to be
clear of all fixed and mobile obstacles except as noted in UFC 3-260-01, Section
13.

2.6. Are all violations along the apron edges documented? (The required
clearance from the apron boundary marking (double continuous 6-inch wide
yellow stripes with a 6-inch gap) to fixed or mobile obstacles is based on the
most demanding aircraft that will use the apron. Compute this distance by
multiplying 0.5 x the wingspan of the most demanding type of aircraft that will
use the apron, and add the appropriate wing tip clearance required by Table 6.1,
item 5 or 6. Then subtract the distance from the taxilane centerline to the apron
boundary marking to find the required clear distance. This distance is to be
clear of all fixed and mobile obstacles except as specifically noted in UFC 3-
260-01, Table 6-1 and Section 13 for additional information.

2.7. Are storm sewer system inlets and drainage channels free of debris? Note
