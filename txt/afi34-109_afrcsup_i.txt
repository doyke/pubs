  Force Reserve (USAFR) Enlisted Members (Contractual Feeding). Focus on satisfying
  customers. Customer feedback is essential, and an active customer service measurement
  program is essential for the success of any food service operation. Use the Golden Eagle
  Club Standards as the foundation for quality product and performance standards. The
  manager must establish realistic, measurable, written standards for customer service,
  preparation, presentation, and the serving of food items. Clear, consistently enforced
  standards, continuous employee training, and staff empowerment at customer contact points
  are each essential to customer satisfaction. Sound internal controls, quality purchasing and
  storage practices, effective merchandising, and accurate market assessments are also critical
  factors in a successful food operation.
  2.6.2. (Added-AFRC) Troop Feeding Operations. Troop feeding is designed to enable
  enlisted 3M0X1 personnel proper amount of time to train during UTAs by cutting their
  responsibility of food service functional support during UTA weekends at dining facilities
  and focusing more on a training environment. Troop feeding is also aimed at saving Air
  Force dollars through eliminating facility cost associated with APF dining facilities,
  equipment, and mess attendant costs that are only used two days a month on Air Force
  Reserve installations. Therefore, troop feeding operations in CAC will result in tremendous
  APF savings.
  2.6.3. (Added-AFRC) Food Purchasing. The manager follows these purchasing guidelines:
     2.6.3.1. (Added-AFRC) Develop written specifications for meat, food, and supply
     items. These specifications must set definite, identifiable standards for each item.
     Specifications must fit menu needs, desired quality, market availability, and storage
     capabilities. Purchase food items only from approved sources (reference AFI 48-116,
     Food Safety Program). Only the manager can approve deviations to specifications.
     Review specifications at least annually.
     2.6.3.2. (Added-AFRC) Establish par stocks with reorder points for such items as dry
     goods, canned goods, condiments, fresh and frozen meat items, and supply items.
     Purchases should be based on forecasted requirements. Local situations and contracts
     dictate the frequency and system of ordering. Consider cooperative buying with other
     Services activities. Use the NAF Prime Vendor (PV) as the primary source at bases and
     sites having a NAF PV contract. Buy for specific needs. The intended use of an item
     dictates the quality required.

  2.6.4. (Added-AFRC) Receiving Procedures.           The manager designates, in writing,
  personnel authorized to receive purchases. Personnel performing ordering cannot be
  receivers because this violates the most important principle of internal control, separation of
  duties. Every purchase must be inspected for safety, quality, and quantity. Receiving
  personnel should know what was ordered from the vendor so they can tell if the delivery
  contains any substitutions, overages, or shortages. Receiving personnel must count or weigh
  all items and compare the quantity of each item to the amount listed on the invoice. All
  items must be counted or weighed in the presence of the delivery person. Both the receiver
  and the delivery person must initial any corrections to the delivery ticket. Food Manager
  must also be familiar with additional details on internal controls found in AFMAN 34-212,
  Control Procedures for Protecting NAF Assets (will convert to AFMAN 34-412).
     2.6.4.1. (Added-AFRC) Receiving personnel must have a platform scale in good
     condition. The scale must be calibrated as necessary but at least once every year. Also

     2.6.4.4. (Added-AFRC) Food safety concerns of primary importance at receipt include
     date, temperature, approved sources, and contamination of food. Cold foods should be
     received at no more than 41 degrees Fahrenheit. Hot foods, if procured, should be
     received at no less than 140 degrees Fahrenheit. Approved sources must be in accordance
     with AFI 48-116. The delivery vehicle should be sanitary and food packaging should be
     adequate to prevent contamination of foods. Contact base Public Health for assistance
     with any food safety concerns.
  2.6.5. (Added-AFRC) Storage Control. Refrigerator and freezer temperatures must be
  controlled to prevent spoilage, maintain quality, and prevent food poisoning. The manager
  must:
     2.6.5.1. (Added-AFRC) Keep storage loss to a minimum.                      Storage includes
     refrigeration (both freezer and chilled), dry storage, in-use storage, and leftover storage.
     2.6.5.2. (Added-AFRC) Implement stock rotation – the oldest products should be used
     first. Place new products behind or below older products in the storage area.

     2.6.5.15. (Added-AFRC) Change locks or combinations when personnel having access
     depart or when pilferage is suspected.
     2.6.5.16. (Added-AFRC) Keep leftovers to a minimum using realistic food production
     orders and forecasts. However, all food operations have some leftovers and care must be
     exercised to provide proper handling as specified in AFI 48-116.
  2.6.6. (Added-AFRC) Sanitation. The current version of the Air Force Food Code is the
  sanitation standard (see AFI 48-116). General areas of importance include:
     2.6.6.1. (Added-AFRC) Personnel. Ensure that a person knowledgeable in Air Force
     Food Code requirements is identified as a person in charge. A person in charge must be
     present for all hours of operation. Do not allow ill personnel to handle foods or work
     with food equipment and utensils. Monitor employees daily for signs of illness such as
     diarrhea, fever, vomiting, jaundice (yellowing of the skin, eyes, etc.), sore throat with
     fever, or draining skin lesions. Contact base Public Health for questions related to ill
     personnel. Personnel must wash their hands frequently or whenever their hands become
     contaminated. Coordinate sanitation training for new personnel with base Public Health.
     2.6.6.2. (Added-AFRC) Food Handling. Use a properly calibrated thermometer to
     regularly monitor food storage, cooking, cooling, and reheating temperatures. Do not
     contact ready to eat foods with bare hands (use gloves, tissues, tongs, or other utensils
AFI34-109_AFRCSUP_I 17 JULY 2012                                                             19


     instead). Store and handle foods properly to prevent contamination. Label potentially
     hazardous foods appropriately.
     2.6.6.3. (Added-AFRC) Equipment and Utensils. Ensure food contact surfaces (to
     include equipment and utensils) are maintained, cleaned, and sanitized properly at the
     correct frequency and are replaced or repaired when severely dented or scratched.
     2.6.6.4. (Added-AFRC) Physical Facilities and Poisonous Materials. Ensure plumbing
     is properly maintained. A clean facility offers the best opportunity for prevention of
     pests. Coordinate other pest prevention and control measures with base Public Health
     and Entomology. Poisonous or toxic materials must be properly labeled and stored.
  2.6.7. (Added-AFRC) Food Inventory. The manager ensures a complete physical
  inventory of all food items is performed at least monthly. In addition, conduct a physical
  inventory of high cost food items at least once per calendar week. See AFI 34-209, NAF
  Financial Management and Accounting (will convert to AFI 34-409) and AFMAN 34-214,
  Procedures for NAF Financial Management and Accounting (will convert to AFMAN 34-
  414).
  2.6.8. (Added-AFRC) Food Production Controls.            The primary purposes of food
  production controls are to produce the correct quantities of food based upon the forecasted
  customer count, control food costs, and ensure consistency through standardized recipes.
     2.6.8.1. (Added-AFRC) CAC Food operations must use a food production control
     system with the following components: product specifications, standardized recipes,
     cyclic menus, and food production forecasts. At the minimum, menus must be reviewed
     semi-annually and revised as required. Proper control of food cost depends on accurate
     forecasting, purchasing food only as needed, proper preparation, and portion control. Use
     the Product Mix (PMIX) Report generated by the Point of Sales (POS) system as a source
     document to help prepare the food production forecast. The chef or kitchen manager uses
     the food production forecast, principles of cooking, and standardized recipes as tools to
     maintain proper food production control. Management communicates the forecast to
     production personnel using AF Form 967, Food Production Order, or a MAJCOM
     approved substitute system.
         2.6.8.1.1. (Added-AFRC) A F Form 967, or approved substitute, is maintained in
         the chef's or food production manager's office so the menu and future production
         reports can reflect changes to production and eliminate slow moving items. A copy
         of the AF Form 967 (or approved substitute) is made available at the kitchen
         workstations.
         2.6.8.1.2. (Added-AFRC) Portion control is one of the most important factors of
         food cost. The manager makes sure each food item served is assigned a standard
         portion size based upon exact weight, volume, size, or count. Ensure servers have the
         necessary utensils to serve the correct portion size. Include standard portion sizes on
         standardized recipes and AF Forms 967.
     2.6.8.2. (Added-AFRC) Menu Cost Cards. The manager ensures:
         2.6.8.2.1. (Added-AFRC) Menu cost cards are developed for all menu items served.
20                                                   AFI34-109_AFRCSUP_I 17 JULY 2012


         2.6.8.2.2. (Added-AFRC) Menu cost cards include: recipe title, selling price,
         ingredients, portion size, edible portion cost, recipe cost, food cost percentage,
         number of servings, contribution margin (profit), and supplies used as a normal
         component of the finished product, (i.e. boxes, circles, clam shell, etc.). The cost of
         these supplies must be added to the menu item’s selling price.
         2.6.8.2.3. (Added-AFRC) Cost cards are reviewed quarterly and revised as
         required.
         2.6.8.2.4. (Added-AFRC) The format used is standardized. Computerized menu
         cost cards are the Air Force standard.
         2.6.8.2.5. (Added-AFRC) Cyclic Menus. A cyclic menu offers a number of items
         on a revolving basis to ensure variety, popularity, and profitability. The use of cyclic
         menus is required for cafeteria operations. The manager must approve all cyclic
         menus and changes.
         2.6.8.2.6. (Added-AFRC) Sales Controls. Sales controls provide internal control
         measures in the food sales outlet through use of guest checks, scatter sheets,
         inventories, electronic cash registers (ECR), POS equipment, and other food cost
         control systems.
            2.6.8.2.6.1. (Added-AFRC) Scatter sheets, AF Form 967 (or computerized
            substitute), and daily inventories (as deemed necessary by management),
            combined with effective guest check controls and managerial oversight, provide
            control of food items. The daily inventory indicates what was used and the guest
            check, scatter sheet, or AF Form 967, when reconciled with cash register sales,
            indicates if payment was received for all items. Daily cash register receipts
            should equal the daily food sales value as computed from checks or scatter sheets.
            The manager reviews all documents daily to control food costs. Use management
            reports generated by the POS system and management information system (MIS).
            2.6.8.2.6.2. (Added-AFRC) When guest checks are used, the manager must
            make sure the central cashier controls and issues them on AF Form 1875, NAF
            Individual Cashier's Report, or equivalent computerized form. Reconcile used
            and unused guest checks on AF Form 1875 or equivalent computerized form.
     2.6.8.3. (Added-AFRC) Nutrition. Wholesome and nutritious products and procedures
     are a necessity in all food production. The manager must support and merchandise Air
     Force nutrition programs (reference AFI 40-104, Nutrition Education.
  2.6.9. (Added-AFRC) Equipment Maintenance. Maintain an equipment log containing a
  description of each piece of equipment, date acquired, maintenance and cleaning schedules,
  and agency responsible for maintenance. The manager must:
     2.6.9.1. (Added-AFRC) Establish cleaning and preventive maintenance schedules for
     all equipment.
     2.6.9.2. (Added-AFRC) Keep a work order log to track repairs.
