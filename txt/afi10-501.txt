This instruction implements AFPD 10-5, Basing. It provides guidance for the Air Staff, major commands
(MAJCOM), organizations, units, or functions as they prepare and manage PADs or PPLANs.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This revision incorporates a Program Guidance Letter.


1. Definition of Terms. See Attachment 1.

2. Objective of a PAD. A PAD describes Air Force initiatives that help accomplish a major action. It
assigns responsibilities and identifies critical tasks as milestones. In some cases, MAJCOMs use a Head-
quarters US Air Force (HQ USAF) PAD as a basis for developing PPLANs. A PAD may also describe
Air Force initiatives supporting a major joint action, such as establishing a new unified command. In such
cases, the PAD serves as the Air Force part of a joint implementation or programming document. See
Attachment 2 for format.

3. Objective of a PPLAN. A PPLAN, like a PAD, describes Air Force initiatives that help accomplish a
major action, but in greater detail. A PPLAN, written below HQ USAF-level, is usually more specific
and focuses more on tasks or milestones.
   3.1. Some major actions, such as transferring a function from one command to another, require an
   inter-MAJCOM or interagency PPLAN.

4. Objective of a Program Guidance Letter (PGL). A PGL is an internal HQ USAF document that
provides formal guidance for actions within an organization or for transferring a function from one orga-
2                                                                      AFI10-501 5 JANUARY 1994


nization to another within a command. Use PGLs when the level of detail in a PAD is more than required.
See Attachment 3 for format.

5. Responsibilities for PADs:
    5.1. HQ USAF Assistant Vice Chief of Staff decides which office within the HQ USAF will be
    responsible for a PAD, depending on the subject matter.
    5.2. PAD office of primary responsibility (OPR):
       •   Determines which organizations are needed to implement the action.
       •   Assigns responsibilities.
       •   Develops the PAD with help from Air Staff functional experts.
       •   Designates other OPRs and offices of collateral responsibility (OCR) to develop annexes,
           when necessary, that spell out to each organization what it must do.
       •   Gets approval from the sponsoring Deputy or Assistant Chief of Staff.
       •   Prints and distributes the PAD.
       •   Terminates the PAD when it is no longer needed or the actions are complete.
    5.3. HQ USAF/XOOB is the OPR for AFI 10-501, provides guidance to PAD OPRs, and numbers
    PADs sequentially within each fiscal year (i.e., 94-1, 94-2).

6. Responsibilities for PPLANs:
    6.1. MAJCOMs and agencies develop procedures for program guidance such as PPLANs.
    6.2. If a MAJCOM or agency needs a HQ USAF PAD as a basis for a PPLAN, they ask the Air Staff
    to develop one or designate a PAD OPR.

Terms
Major Action—An initiative in which several organizations work cooperatively towards a common goal
by consolidating taskings, OPRs, and other separate directives.
Program Action Directive (PAD)—A formal planning document that helps accomplish a major action
such as the reorganization or formation of a MAJCOM, organization, unit, or function. Examples include
establishing Air Education and Training Command, normalizing Air Force Intelligence, or carrying out
directions from the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission. The PAD is also used to direct
programs on new acquisitions and modifications. It states the objective of the program, assigns specific
tasks to OPRs and OCRs, and establishes milestones.
Program Guidance Letter (PGL)—A formal planning document that establishes direction, assigns
tasks, and provides guidance (for example, Morale, Welfare, and Recreation/Services integration or Civil
Air Patrol reorganization).
Programming Plan (PPLAN)—A formal planning document written below HQ USAF-level that helps
accomplish and record major actions.
