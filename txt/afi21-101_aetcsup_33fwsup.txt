This Instruction supplements AFI 21-101, Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance Management,
dated 26 July 2010, Incorporating Change dated 16 August 2011, and AFI 21-101 AETCSUP,
Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance Management, dated 21 October 2010, as follows. This
supplement establishes policies and procedures for aircraft maintenance at Eglin AFB, FL.
Procedures outlined in this supplement apply to all maintenance and operations personnel
assigned to the 33d Operations Group and 33d Maintenance Group. Per agreement between HQ
AETC/A4M and the Commander of Naval Air Forces Policy Branch, all Department of Navy
(DoN) units assigned to the 33 FW will use COMNAVAIRFORINST 4790.2, The Naval
Aviation Maintenance Program (NAMP) series, to govern daily aircraft maintenance activities.
AFI 21-101 and AETC supplements are not applicable to DoN units except as specifically
addressed in this supplement. Paragraphs applicable to DoN aircraft and personnel will be used
as standalone instructions. Paragraphs peculiar to a single service will be annotated as such;
otherwise this guidance applies to all 33 FW units. The goal is to standardize maintenance
policy guidance throughout the wing to the maximum extent possible, while adhering to service
specific standards where service policy is complimentary to each other. When conflicts exist,
parent service directives will take precedence until resolved by the affected group commander.
It is the intent of this supplement to provide clear maintenance policy direction for all units

           long term procedures. These tools, CTKs, and equipment are logged into ALIS or
           the approved tool tracking system.
           10.2.1.1.3. (Added-USAF) Ensure every effort is made to ensure accountability
           of tools. Tools should not be signed out for an extended period of time. Extended
           period is defined as extended past a duty period for the person who signed out the
           tools.
           10.2.1.1.4. (Added-USAF) Tools no longer part of the CTK (permanently
           removed from the MIL) or shadow board have the respective cutout filled or
           shadowing removed. This is accomplished by permanently filling in the tool
           cutout or by painting over the shadowed area in the appropriate background color
           of the shadow board.
           10.2.1.1.5. (Added-USAF) All test equipment will have a list of detachable
           items included in the test set (i.e., power cords, hoses, etc.), posted inside the
AFI21-101_AETCSUP_33FWSUP 3 OCTOBER 2012                                                  15


          cover. All detachable items larger than ¼ inch in diameter are etched, stenciled,
          or labeled with CTK number.
          10.2.1.2.1. (Added-USAF) All CTKs have, as a minimum, a 90-day inspection
          performed and documented within ALIS or approved tool tracking system. When
          the CTK custodian is replaced, a l00% tool and equipment inventory is
          accomplished and documented in ALIS. As a minimum, inspect the following
          items: etchings, legibility of etchings and required markings (double etchings are
          not authorized), condition of tools, corrosion, foreign objects and
          condition/currency of the Master Inventory Listing (MIL) and ALIS database.
          Check MILs against the Master MIL to ensure accuracy. Also, ensure all MILs
          are legible and that permanent ink changes are added to the database and new
          MILs are printed. Check for overdue calibration and ensure all sets contain the
          proper number of items (as marked on the container). Inspect all tools for
          serviceability IAW TO 32-1-101.
          10.2.1.2.2. (Added-USAF) On quarterly inspections, weapons section chiefs
          will expand their inspection to ensure Voltage Detectors (VD) in each test set are
          opened and checked for battery terminal corrosion or battery leakage. Visually
          inspect internal surfaces of VD for signs of humidity, leakage and/or corrosion. If
          corrosion exists, turn the item into PMEL for maintenance. If no defects exist,
          reinstall the batteries.
          10.2.1.2.3. (Added-USAF) Support Section Chief documents CTK custodian
          change inventory by letter. Flight commander/chief signs the letter and files it in
          the MIL book or section continuity book.
          10.2.1.2.4. (Added) Spill Recovery Units, EPA Trailers, and Hazardous Waste
          Accumulation points that contain safety equipment and Personal Protective
          Equipment (PPE) are marked with the squadron and accumulation site or trailer
          number. An equipment content listing is kept with spill kits.
       10.2.1.3. (USAF) Flight commanders/chiefs/senior maintenance representatives
       ensure strict control of warranty tools and designate program managers (primary and
       alternate) in writing or electronic format.
          10.2.1.3.1. (Added-USAF) The program manager will maintain a list of all
          warranty tools and ensure broken or damaged warranty tools are isolated and
          under strict control until properly replaced. Warranty replacement tools must be
          isolated from other replacement tools. An asterisk on all CTK MILs and spare
          bin rosters will identify non-warranty tools. Broken warranty tools are replaced
          according to the manufacturer‟s warranty agreement.
       10.2.1.4. (USAF) Consumables placed in CTKs are marked for the CTK they are in
       and replaced as needed. Only support section personnel/CTK custodian are allowed
       to replace consumables and only when the empty container or roll is returned.
       Consumables not feasible to mark (petrolatum, grease, etc.) are placed in a suitable
       container that is marked. Keep consumables placed in CTKs at the absolute
       minimum levels needed to perform the job.
          10.2.1.5.1. (Added-USAF) The production supervisor authorizes all flight line
16                           AFI21-101_AETCSUP_33FWSUP 3 OCTOBER 2012


     CTK turnovers and keeps transfers to a minimum. When transfers do occur, the
     person being relieved of the CTK and the person assuming control of it inventory
     the CTK. A section chief, line chief or a representative from the support section
     also inventories the CTK. Use an AF Form 1297, Temporary Issue Receipt, to
     issue the CTK to the next person. The person being relieved of control of the
     CTK ensures the hand receipt is delivered to the support section or responsible
     agent for accounting for this equipment. This relieves him or her from
     responsibility for the CTK. These turnovers are treated as if the CTKs were being
     turned in or signed out at the support section.
     10.2.1.6.1. (Added) Procedures for AETC Form 138, Lost Tool or Item
     Investigation Record (USAF) / COMNAVAIRFORINST 4790.2 Missing Tool
     Report (DoN) as follows: QA keeps the original Eglin Lost Tool/Object Report
     and forwards it to 33 FW FOD Manager. A copy is filed with the CTK custodian.
     When lost tools are found, notify AMU Production Super, applicable DoN
     controller, or owning support section and 33 FW FOD Manager. Lost tool reports
     are accomplished on all reported lost tools and objects, whether found or not.
     10.2.1.6.2. (Added) If a tool/object is lost during maintenance on an in-shop
     engine or component, the following procedures will apply:
        10.2.1.6.2.1. (Added) All maintenance on the affected engine or unit will be
        stopped and the work center supervisor will immediately initiate a search for
        the missing item. All available personnel stop all maintenance and assist in a
        search until the work center supervisor releases personnel or calls off the
        search. The work center supervisor notifies the flight chief, maintenance
        superintendent and QA immediately and initiates lost tool paperwork. If the
        tool/object is not found after an extensive search, the maintenance
        superintendent or designated representative determines if the equipment
        requires impoundment.
        10.2.1.6.2.2. (Added) QA will review the impoundment procedures prior to
        release of the engine from impoundment after the work center has completed a
        thorough search of all involved engines and work areas.
        10.2.1.6.2.3. (Added) The shift supervisor and the individual who signed for
        the CTK will ensure support personnel annotate the missing tool on all copies
        of the CTKs MILs.
        10.2.1.6.2.4. (Added) If aircraft or associated equipment is not involved, the
        individual discovering the tool or object missing will notify the work center
        supervisor immediately. The work center supervisor stops all maintenance
        and a search is conducted to find the item. All equipment the tool or object
        was used on must be returned to the shop. A search of the equipment will be
        conducted and annotated on AETC Form 138, Lost Tool or Item Investigation
        Record (USAF) / COMNAVAIRFORINST 4790.2 Missing Tool Report
        (DoN).
        10.2.1.6.2.5. (Added) If a tool/object is lost while performing maintenance
        on/around an aircraft, the affected backshop, flying unit, or AMU immediately

              stops aircraft movement on ground until all involved flight line areas can be
              searched, unless cleared to fly sooner by appropriate supervision. All
              available personnel in affected areas stop all maintenance and assist in a
              search until the senior maintenance officer or maintenance superintendent
              releases personnel or calls off the search. If the tool/object is not found within
              a reasonable period of time, the maintenance officer, maintenance
              superintendent or designated representative determines if the
              aircraft/equipment requires impoundment.
              10.2.1.6.2.6. (Added-USAF) To minimize aircraft downtime when a
              tool/object is suspected lost in a cockpit, the ejection seat is raised to the full
              up position. If the search proves unproductive, the ejection seat pan, kick
              panels, console instruments, and other components are removed to facilitate
              the search, as required.
                10.2.1.6.2.6.1. (Added-USAF) After a thorough search, egress personnel
                thoroughly search the ejection seat (at the request of the impoundment
                official) prior to the aircraft being released from impoundment. Before
                requesting release of the impoundment, the impoundment official will
                confer with the available Releasing Authority (RA) to determine if an
                ejection seat removal is required for further searching.
              10.2.1.6.2.7. (Added) The shift supervisor and the individual who signed for
              the CTK ensure support personnel annotate the missing tool on all copies of
              the CTKs MILs.
       10.2.1.7. Only tools/equipment supplied or approved for use by the F-35 program are
       used to facilitate maintenance on aircraft and assigned equipment. These tools are
       marked according to ALIS guidelines.
          10.2.1.7.1. (Added) Tools/equipment required to facilitate aircraft/equipment
          maintenance not supplied by Lockheed Martin may be used after obtaining
          approval from the 33 MXG/CC or DoN Squadron Aircraft Maintenance Officer.
          These tools are marked according to ALIS guidelines or service specific
          instructions.
          10.2.1.8.1. (Added-USAF) Issued personal equipment (hearing protection,
          reflective belts, etc.) are permanently marked with individual's first initial, last
          name, and last four of Social Security Number (SSN) (example: J. Doe, 1234).
          Personnel must maintain strict control and accountability of personal issued
          equipment. Lost tool procedures are followed if an item is lost. All personnel
          assigned to the 33 FW comply with local requirements for the use of Personal
          Protective Equipment (PPE) and safety equipment such as reflective belts and
          hearing protection.
              10.2.1.9.1.1. (Added-USAF) Containers of five rags may be kept for issue
              and the number of rags is marked on the container. Rags are counted each
              time the container is issued or turned in. Any time rags are changed, it is on a
              one-for-one swap. Single rags may be issued using an AF Form 1297.
              Individually issued rags are replaced on a one-for-one swap. An unaccounted

        Aircraft: NOTE: For flightline explosives operations, see EGLINAFBI 91-101,
        Flightline Explosives Operations.
        12.1.15.1.2. (Added) The only areas approved and designated as operational
        arm/de-arm aircraft parking areas are outlined on the base map maintained by the
        Wing Safety Office.
        12.1.15.1.3. (Added) Hung inert/live bombs: EOR or arm/de-arm personnel will
        safe the aircraft IAW applicable technical data. If the aircraft cannot be safed,
        EOR personnel will inform aircrew and contact MOC for available parking
        location. The aircraft will then be directed to shut down by EOR personnel.
        MOC will dispatch Aircraft Maintenance Unit (AMU)/Squadron
        recovery/weapons personnel to download bombs and safe the aircraft as required.
        If aircraft/bombs cannot be safed, recovery/weapons personnel will notify MOC
        to continue hung ordnance procedures as required.
        12.1.15.1.4. (Added) DoN Aircraft are handled as outlined above, but require
        DoN personnel to respond to the approved arm/de-arm area (off the main parking
        ramp) to comply with the direction above.
     12.1.15.3. (Added) Aircraft Gun System Malfunction:
        12.1.15.3.1. (Added) Aircraft         returning    with   a    gun    malfunction
        (hung/runaway/un-commanded firing/rotation) will taxi to the designated hung
        gun/de-arm area and wait for weapons personnel to arrive. At no time will
        aircraft with known gun system malfunctions be allowed back onto the main
        parking ramp prior to confirming system safety in an approved de-arm area. If an
        unsafe condition is discovered after aircraft has taxied back to the main parking
        ramp, the pilot will be directed to return to the de-arm/hung gun location area for
        further evaluation. Prior to aircraft shutdown, weapons maintenance personnel
        will establish communications with the pilot and examine the rounds counter to
        determine whether gun rotation occurred. If the gun system did not rotate,
        weapons maintenance personnel perform normal de-arm procedures and allow the
        aircraft to taxi back to the parking ramp. If the gun system rotated, the aircraft
        must be shut down in order to safely assess damage and determine if rounds
        are chambered. Personnel will not leave the aircraft unattended until the gun is
        safe. If the gun is found jammed during ground operations at de-arm/hung gun
        location area, weapons maintenance personnel inform the aircrew and MOC.
        12.1.15.3.2. (Added) Weapons/Ordnance maintenance personnel, with the
        assistance of 33d Maintenance Squadron (MXS) armament personnel, if needed,
        will make every effort to clear the gun of all chambered rounds IAW applicable
        JTD.
        12.1.15.3.3. (Added) If the gun or gun pod cannot be cleared, qualified Weapons
        maintenance/Ordnance personnel will remove the gun barrels and if possible
        remove the round/spent casing from the barrel. Use only hands (no tools) to
        remove rounds/spent casing from barrel. DO NOT pry/strike/force any rounds to
        free them from barrels. Removed gun barrels that still contain live rounds/spent
        casings are oriented toward the least hazardous area and MOC is contacted to
AFI21-101_AETCSUP_33FWSUP 3 OCTOBER 2012                                                 21


           have EOD dispatched to dispose of the gun barrel. Do not deliver gun barrels that
           contain live rounds or spent casings to the Armament Flight maintenance facility.
           12.1.15.3.4. (Added) When a hung or unsafe gun is discovered on the aircraft
           parking ramp, personnel will continue with proper gun safing operations as stated
           in paragraph 12.1.15.3.1.
           12.1.15.3.5. (Added) If the gun cannot be immediately cleared, maintenance
           personnel will contact MOC and inform them of the gun condition.
           12.1.15.3.6. (Added) In the event there are damaged rounds with exposed
           powder, maintenance crews will immediately stop operations and call MOC to
           dispatch EOD personnel.
  14.11. Dropped Object Prevention (DOP) Program, and (DoN) Things Falling Off
  Aircraft (TFOA) Program
        14.11.1.1. The 33 FW FOD/DOP/TFOA Manager is the OPR for this program. The
        DOP/TFOA Program manager will:
           14.11.1.1.1. (Added) Monitor the overall effectiveness of the Wing DOP/TFOA
           Program.
           14.11.1.1.2. (Added) Analyze results of all dropped object incidents and ensure
           maintenance managers are aware of unfavorable trends.

       AIRCRAFT, ENGINE AND EQUIPMENT IMPOUNDMENT TABLE (USAF)

Any aircraft, engine, or equipment reportable incident or unusual occurrence may require
impoundment; each event is evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Any aircraft, engine or
equipment with the potential for impoundment is treated as such by being placed on
impoundment freeze until it is determined by an approved Impound Authority that impoundment
is not justified. No maintenance actions are performed until a determination for impoundment is
made by an approved Impoundment Authority.

When using the impoundment table “Conditions” column, pay particular attention to keywords;
i.e., the use of “in-flight” means that condition only applies to those that occurred in-flight. The
absence of keywords mean all conditions apply; i.e. in-flight, on-ground, installed, removed, by
aircrew or by maintenance personnel. Similarly, when using the “Notes” column, carefully read
specific conditions typically noted as Includes or Excludes.
