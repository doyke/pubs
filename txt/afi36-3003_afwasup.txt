SUMMARY OF CHANGES

 This change incorporates interim change (IC) 2005-2 (Attachment 6). Adds rule 50, Funeral
Services, to Table 7, allow Airmen to request permissive TDY to attend funeral services of an
immediate family member who is also on active duty, to actively participate in funeral services
of another military member (i.e., pallbearer, bugler, etc.), or to attend funeral services when the
deceased is a military member currently assigned or attached to the requestor’s unit. Updates
Table 7, rule 3, Authorized PTDY, which allows Airmen assigned an indeterminate TDY to
request PTDY if they will not return to their permanent duty station and are relocating
dependents to secure off-base housing. See the last attachment of the publication, IC 2005-2, for
the complete IC. A bar (|) indicates revision from the previous edition.

4. Managing the Leave Program:
     4.1. Military Leave Program:
        4.1.1. Statutory Authority. The more common statutes are:
AFI36-3003_AFWASUP_I 14 MARCH 2014                                                          5


        4.1.1.1. Title 10, U.S.C., section 701, entitlement and accumulation.
        4.1.1.2. Title 10, U.S.C., section 704, use of leave on a calendar-day basis.
        4.1.1.3. Title 10, U.S.C., section 705, special rest and recuperative (SR&R) leave for
        qualified enlisted members extending duty at designated locations overseas. SR&R
        and the overseas tour extension incentive program (OTEIP) are synonymous.
        4.1.1.4. Title 10, U.S.C., section 706, leave required to be taken pending review of
        certain court-martial convictions.
        4.1.1.5. Title 37, U.S.C., section 411b, travel and transportation allowances in
        connection with leave between consecutive overseas tours.
        4.1.1.6. Title 37. U.S.C., section 411g, travel and transportation allowances incident
        to voluntary extensions of overseas tours of duty. This also referred to as OTEIP.
        4.1.1.7. Title 37, U.S.C., section 501, payment for unused accrued leave not to
        exceed 60 days.
     4.1.2. Annual Leave Program. Annual leave programs give members the opportunity to
     take leave within the constraints of operational requirements. Unit commanders establish
     these programs to encourage the use of leave for the maximum benefit of the member.
     Scheduling leave prevents loss of leave at fiscal year (FY)-end balancing, retirement, or
     separation from active duty. Both management and members share responsibility in
     managing leave balances throughout the FY. NOTE: The entitlement to leave is a right;
     however, unit commanders can deny leave due to military necessity or when in the best
     interests of the Air Force.
     4.1.3. Safe Travel Guidelines. Members on leave or on other non-duty status should use
     Operational Risk Management (ORM) principles to assess all hazards and control risks
     prior to excessive or hazardous travel, especially by automobile. Applicable guidelines
     are in AFI 91-213, Operational Risk Management. A comprehensive ORM assessment
     may conclude that fatigue or road conditions are high risks requiring a change to travel
     plans.
     4.1.4. Use of Leave. The use of leave is essential to the morale and motivation of
     members and for maintaining maximum effectiveness. Lengthy respites from the work
     environment tend to have a beneficial effect on an individual’s psychological and
     physical status. Weekend absences (regular pass) or short periods of leave do not
     normally afford a similar degree of relief. In providing the leave entitlement, Congress
     intended for members to use their leave as accruing. Congress provides for payment of
     accrued leave when members are unable to use their leave because of military necessity.
     However, Congress did not intend for members to accrue large leave balances expressly
     for payment of accrued leave. Give members the opportunity to take at least one leave
     period of 14 consecutive days or more every FY and encourage them to use the 30 days
     accrued each FY. Encourage members to use leave, military requirements permitting, and
     consider the desires of the member:
        4.1.4.1. With a permanent change of station (PCS).
        4.1.4.2. After periods of arduous duty and protracted periods of deployment.

       4.1.4.3. When reenlisting.
       4.1.4.4. During the traditional national holiday periods.
       4.1.4.5. To attend to family emergencies or personal situations caused by floods,
       hurricanes, and similar disasters.
       4.1.4.6. For attendance at spiritual events or for other religious observances.
       4.1.4.7. During the period before processing incident to release from active duty.
       4.1.4.8. As terminal leave with retirement or separation from active duty.
       4.1.4.9. In conjunction with Operation Bootstrap when it would enable a person to
       complete an education program.
    4.1.5. Unit Commander’s Responsibilities. Unit commanders:
       4.1.5.1. Establish annual leave programs to give members opportunity to use leave.
       4.1.5.2. Enforce Air Force and command-approved leave guidelines.
       4.1.5.3. Document all leaves and establish an audit trail for money spent in
       conjunction with emergency leave.
       4.1.5.4. Make sure commander’s support staff personnel keep prompt and accurate
       records of leave.
       4.1.5.5. Make sure members who refuse to take leave understand their obligation to
       comply with unit leave programs and that refusal to take leave may result in the loss
       of earned leave at a later date.
       4.1.5.6. Instruct members to schedule leave within operational requirements.
       4.1.5.7. Encourage members to take one leave of at least 14 continuous days every
       FY and to use leave accrued each FY.
       4.1.5.8. Inform members that there may be instances of leave disapproval or
       cancellation due to military necessity.
       4.1.5.9. Ensure members schedule leave annually at the beginning of the FY and
       update their leave schedule periodically.
       4.1.5.10. Tell members to follow their leave schedule in order to have an effective
       unit leave program.
       4.1.5.11. Advise members who schedule “use or lose” leave in Aug or Sep that they
       risk losing leave on 1 Oct if military requirements or personal circumstances prevent
       them from taking leave at that particular time.
       4.1.5.12. Seek, if necessary, American Red Cross (ARC) verification when members
       request emergency leave.
       4.1.5.13. Charge leave for leave periods such as those taken by members waiting for
       family members’ passports or visas or for the outcome of humanitarian reassignment
       requests.
AFI36-3003_AFWASUP_I 14 MARCH 2014                                                           7


         4.1.5.14. Combine ordinary leave with other types of leave unless specifically
         prohibited and treat the combination of leaves as one leave period.
         4.1.5.15. Make sure members taking ordinary vice terminal leave return 15 days
         before their scheduled separation or retirement to prevent pay problems.
         4.1.5.16. Charge members leave for time spent house hunting in conjunction with a
         permissive reassignment.
         4.1.5.17. Provide an opportunity to use leave to Air Force Reserve and Air National
         Guard members serving man-day tours longer than 30 consecutive days under AFI
         36-2619, Military Personnel Appropriations(MPA) Man-Day Program. AFI 36-2619
         authorizes use of accrued leave. See AFMAN 36-8001, Reserve Personnel
         Participation and Training Procedures, for Reserve Personnel Appropriations (RPA)
         tours over 30 days.
         4.1.5.18. Normally do not grant leave to members undergoing treatment for an
         infectious or contagious disease. EXCEPTION: Unit commander may grant leave if
         the attending physician provides written verification that the member does not pose a
         threat to the public health.
         4.1.5.19. Do not grant leave for the purpose of serving sentences to civil confinement
         because civil confinement, including probated sentences thereto, is inconsistent with
         military status. COMMENT: Members confined by civil authorities while on
         approved leave may continue on leave until the original leave termination date, unless
         recalled from leave status to duty. If unit commander recalls member to duty,
         terminate leave status as of the recall date and change the member’s status to “absent
         in the hands of civil authorities.”
  4.2. Leave Approval Authority. While commanders have final approval authority, they may
  delegate approval authority according to the organization’s needs. They may delegate it
  normally to a level no lower than squadron section commander, deputies, or equivalent (for
  headquarters staff, no lower than assistant functional deputy directors or equivalents).
  NOTE: During short absences of the unit commander, the commander’s designated
  representative may approve, in the commander’s name.
     4.2.1. Annual Leave. At unit level and headquarters’ staff, commanders delegate
     ordinary leave approval to no lower than the first-line supervisor.
     4.2.2. Advance Leave. Technical school and basic military training commanders may
     delegate to no lower than the first sergeants.
     4.2.3. Emergency Leave. Commanders may delegate to unit first sergeant for enlisted
     members. When delegated approval authority, first sergeants can approve advance or
     excess leave for emergency leave purposes.
     4.2.4. Convalescent Leave:
         4.2.4.1. Unit commanders normally approve convalescent leave based on the written
         recommendation of the military physician most familiar with the member’s condition.
         4.2.4.2. An Air Force medical treatment facility commander approves convalescent
         leave for members who will be returning to inpatient status.

            4.2.4.3. The commander of an Army or Navy medical facility, or a Director of a
            Veterans’ Administration hospital, approves convalescent leave for members who
            will be returning to inpatient status.
        4.2.5. DELETED.
        4.2.6. Commanders Reporting Directly to the Chief of Staff, Vice Chief of Staff or
        Assistant Vice Chief of Staff. These commanders approve their own leave. They send
        their leave notification via e-mail, message, or datafax at least 7 days in advance to HQ
        USAF/CVA. Include in the leave notification:
            4.2.6.1. Effective date of leave.
            4.2.6.2. Duration.
            4.2.6.3. Leave address.
            4.2.6.4. Name of acting commander.
NOTE:
HQ USAF/CVA advises commanders when extenuating circumstances require adjustments to
scheduled leave.
        4.2.7. Temporary Duty (TDY) Commanders. TDY commanders:
            4.2.7.1. Notify parent organizations via email, message or datafax of leave requests.
            4.2.7.2. Approve leaves with which the parent organizations agree.
            4.2.7.3. Send e-mail, messages, or datafax memorandums when necessary.
NOTE:
Paragraphs 4.2.7.1 through 4.2.7.3 apply to Personnel Support for Contingency Operations
(PERSCO) Team Chiefs at deployed locations.
            4.2.7.4. Charge leave to members attending Air Education and Training Command
            (AETC) formal schools that close for the Christmas and New Year's Day holidays.
            Do not charge them leave if they perform authorized duty at the TDY site or report
            for approved duty to their home station during holiday periods. When their permanent
            duty station commanders concur, members may return to the home station to perform
            duty. If so, entitlement to allowances prescribed in Joint Federal Travel Regulations,
            volume 1 (JFTR), paragraph U4130, may apply. See AFR 177-103, Travel
            Transactions at Base Level, chapter 4.
     4.3. Leave Disapproval Authority. The entitlement to leave is a right; however, unit
     commanders can disapprove leave requests due to military necessity or in the best interests of
     the Air Force.
        4.3.1. Unit commanders may delegate disapproval authority to a level no lower than
        squadron section commander, deputies, or equivalent (for headquarters staff, no lower
        than assistant functional deputy directors or equivalents).
     4.4. Leave Accrual. Title 10, U.S.C., section 701, governs leave accrual and accumulation.
        4.4.1. Accrual. Members accrue 2.5 days leave for each month of active duty. See
        Figure 1 and Figure 2 below.
AFI36-3003_AFWASUP_I 14 MARCH 2014                                                                                 9


        4.4.2. Accumulation. Members who are unable to use leave due to military necessity
        may accumulate a maximum of 60 days by the end of an FY. See Section E for special
        leave accrual (SLA) provisions. Members not eligible for SLA can request recovery of
        days lost on 1 Oct by submitting DD Form 149, Application for Correction of Military
        Records Under the Provisions of Title10, U.S. Code Section 1552. See AFI 36-2603,
        Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records. Member’s application must
        establish that an error or injustice by the Air Force caused the member’s lost leave or that
        military necessity precluded taking leave before 1 Oct.
        4.4.3. Non-Accrual. Members do not accrue leave in the following circumstances:
              4.4.3.1. Absence without leave.
              4.4.3.2. Unauthorized leave.
              4.4.3.3. Confinement as a result of a sentence of a court-martial.
              4.4.3.4. Excess leave.
              4.4.3.5. Appellate leave under Title 10, U.S.C., section 876a.

  4.5. FY-End Leave Balancing. Members may not carry leave in excess of 60 days into the
  next FY. At the end of the FY they lose leave in excess of 60 days unless eligible for SLA.
  The Defense Joint Military Pay System (DJMS) drops accrued leave in excess of 60 days at
  FY-end leave balancing unless automatic carry over of SLA applies. See Section E, Special
  Leave Accrual.
  4.6. Payment for Accrued Leave. Title 37, U.S.C., Section 501, is the authority for payment
  of accrued leave upon reenlistment, retirement, separation under honorable conditions, or
  death. It limits payment of accrued leave to 60 days in a military career effective 10 Feb 76.
  A military career includes former service in enlisted or officer status. Cumulative payment
  for accrued leave as an enlisted member, officer, or both cannot exceed 60 days. DoD
  7000.14.R, volume 7A ,Department of Defense Financial Management Regulation (Military
  Pay Policy and Procedures Active Duty and Reserve Pay), Jul 96, states when members
  carry leave forward or receive payment for accrued leave when separating with or without
  immediate reentry on active duty. See your financial services office for detailed information
  on payment of accrued leave.
  4.7. Disability Separation:
        4.7.1. DoD Guidelines. DoD processing requirements require members to receive
        payment for up to 60 days accrued leave and affords them time to take any accrued leave
        in excess of this 60-day limit.
        4.7.2. Determining Retirement or Separation Date. HQ AFPC/DPPD (Physical Disability
        Division) determines a member’s separation date, taking into account:
           4.7.2.1. Leave balance and leave accruing in excess of the 60-day accrued leave
           payment limitation for members entitled to payment for up to 60 days of accrued
           leave.
           4.7.2.2. Accrued leave and leave accruing to the date of separation for members
           previously paid for 60 days.
           4.7.2.3. PTDY authorized.
           4.7.2.4. Processing time. Members may take accrued leave instead of processing
           time.
           EXAMPLE: A member previously paid for 40 days of accrued leave and has a leave
           balance of 70 days. In this case, the member receives payment for 20 days and can
           take leave for the remaining 50 days plus leave accruing to date of separation. If
           member is receiving payment for accrued leave for the first time, he or she receives
           payment for 60 days. The member then can take leave for the remaining 10 days plus
AFI36-3003_AFWASUP_I 14 MARCH 2014                                                              11


           leave accruing to date of separation. The established date of separation remains firm
           and members forfeit accrued leave if unable to take leave due to extenuating
           circumstances (for example, hospitalization or convalescent leave).
NOTE:
Paragraph 4.7.2 does not apply to members separating or retiring because of imminent death.
       4.7.3. Leave Awaiting Orders. Charge leave as accrued and accruing when the
       commander sends a member home or to another location in a PCS status to await orders
       for disability separation. Charge any remaining time as an authorized absence after the
       member uses all accrued leave.
   4.8. Leave Outside the United States:
       4.8.1. Authority to Grant Leave Outside the United States. Unit commanders may
       authorize members to take leave in areas outside the continental United States, Alaska,
       Hawaii, or United States possessions. If leave is in conjunction with PCS or TDY,
       include on the PCS or TDY order:
           4.8.1.1. The area or country of final destination and each country the member will be
           visiting.
           4.8.1.2. A leave address through which the unit may contact the member.
           COMMENTS: Members taking leave overseas en route to their overseas assignment
           must sign a statement agreeing to the fact they cannot report earlier than their report
           not later date (RNLTD) month. Include in the PCS orders: “In connection with
           member’s leave overseas en route to the overseas assignment, member has agreed to
           the fact that reporting to the new assignment may not be earlier than the RNLTD
           month.”
       4.8.2. Ordinary Leave When Not Assigned Overseas. Include on the AF Form 988,
       Leave Request/Authorization:
           4.8.2.1. The area or country of final destination and each country the member will be
           visiting.
           4.8.2.2. A leave address through which the unit may contact the member.
       4.8.3. Ordinary Leave When Assigned Overseas. Follow overseas host MAJCOM
       procedures for processing and approving leave. Include on the AF Form 988:
           4.8.3.1. The area or country of final destination and each country the member will be
           visiting.
           4.8.3.2. A leave address through which the unit may contact the member.
       4.8.4. Special Instructions For All Members Taking Leave in Overseas Area:
           4.8.4.1. Instruct members to comply with foreign government procedures as required
           by AFI 24-405, Department of Defense Foreign Clearance Guide, to include the DoD
           Travel Security Advisory. Ensure they also comply with security procedures
           prescribed for visits to communist or communist-controlled countries. The
           passport/visa section in the MPF maintains a copy of the guide and advisory.
12                                              AFI36-3003_AFWASUP_I 14 MARCH 2014


         4.8.4.2. When the purpose of the visit is marriage to a foreign national, the
         requirements of existing marriage instructions of the Air Force commander in the area
         where the marriage will take place apply. The approving commander ensures that the
         member can meet these requirements during the leave period.
  4.9. Forms to Document Leave and PTDY:
     4.9.1. Normally use the AF Form 988 for all types of leave and PTDY. DFAS-DEM
     7073.2, volume II, chapter 7, Unit Leave Procedures, contains leave processing
     procedures using the AF Form 988.
         4.9.1.1. Use the AF Form 972, Request and Authorization for Emergency Leave,
         for members authorized funded emergency leave travel. See paragraph 6.5,
         Emergency Leave, of this AFI. DFAS-DER 7010-3 (formerly AFR 177-103), Travel
         Transactions at Base Level, requires the AF Form 972 to document authorized
         emergency leave travel.
         4.9.1.2. Use DD Form 1610, Request and Authorization for TDY Travel of DoD
         Personnel, for participants or trainees authorized space-required travel with PTDY
         for sports or recreation or talent events. See Table 7, Rules 33 and 34, of this AFI.
         4.9.1.3. Use DD Form 1610 for deferred consecutive overseas tour (COT) leave or
         in-place COT (IPCOT) leave. See paragraph 14.3, Scheduling IPCOT and Deferred
         COT Leave, of this AFI.
         4.9.1.4. Use DD Form 1610 for 15-day SR&R leave under the OTEIP. See paragraph
         14.6, SR&R or OTEIP, of this AFI.
     4.9.2. Place the authorization for PTDY for house hunting in conjunction with
     reassignment on the PCS orders when:
         4.9.2.1. Members reassigned with TDY en route or
         4.9.2.2. Members authorized to relocate family members to a designated place when
         going to or returning from an overseas unaccompanied tour. NOTE: If commander
         approves PTDY, the MPF includes the following statement on the PCS orders:
         “Member has authorization for (number of days, not to exceed 8) PTDY for the
         purpose of house hunting.”
     4.9.3. When members take leave en route, authorized PTDY, or both, with PCS or TDY
     travel, the financial services office (FSO) uses the travel voucher to determine authorized
     travel, authorized PTDY, and chargeable leave.
     4.9.4. Local Instructions to AF Form 988. Unit commanders send requests to add local
     instructions to the AF Form 988 to HQ USAF Compensation Policy Branch (DPRCC),
     1040 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1040.
  4.10. Holidays. Public holidays established by Federal statute are non-working days, military
  operations permitting. When a holiday falls on a Saturday, the non-working day is the
  preceding Friday. When a holiday falls on a Sunday, the non-working day is the following
  Monday. Holidays are chargeable leave days if they occur during an authorized period of
  leave. If departure on a period of leave is on a holiday, the holiday is not a day of leave. If
  return from an authorized period of leave is on a holiday, the holiday is a day of leave.
AFI36-3003_AFWASUP_I 14 MARCH 2014                                                            13


  Commanders may be as liberal as training, mission, and local conditions permit in
  authorizing leave during the Christmas and New Year’s Day period.
     4.10.1. New Year’s Day, 1 January.
     4.10.2. Martin Luther King’s Birthday, the third Monday in January.
     4.10.3. Washington’s Birthday, the third Monday in February.
     4.10.4. Memorial Day, the last Monday in May.
     4.10.5. Independence Day, 4 July.
     4.10.6. Labor Day, the first Monday in September.
     4.10.7. Columbus Day, the second Monday in October.
     4.10.8. Veterans Day, 11 November.
     4.10.9. Thanksgiving Day, the fourth Thursday in November.
     4.10.10. Christmas Day, 25 December.
     4.10.11. Other holidays as directed by proper authority under the law.
  4.11. Miscellaneous Information:
     4.11.1. Leave for Enforcement of Child Support Obligation. Unit commanders approve
     leave requested to attend hearings to determine paternity or to determine an obligation to
     provide child support. Unit commanders may disapprove such leave requests if the
     member is serving in or with a unit deployed in a contingency operation or exigencies of
     the military service require a denial of such request.
     4.11.2. TDY From Leave Status. A member ordered TDY while on leave reverts to duty
     status as of the TDY effective date. Annotate the TDY orders to show whether the
     member is reverting to leave status originally authorized or will be returning to his or her
     duty station upon completing the TDY.
     4.11.3. Recall From Leave. Unit commanders may recall members from leave for
     military necessity or in the best interest of the Air Force. When recalling a member, do
     not charge the period of absence as leave when the period between departure on leave
     and the member’s receipt of recall is 3 days or less. Consider the remaining time of
     absence as travel time, unless the unit commander determines it is clearly excessive to the
     circumstances. If determined excessive, charge the entire period of absence as leave.
         4.11.3.1. Refer to the JFTR, paragraph U7220, to determine whether travel and
         transportation allowances apply. If so, member reverts to duty status the day travel to
         the permanent or TDY station begins. Annotate travel orders to show the date the
         member reverts to duty status. Use the travel orders to cancel the remaining portion of
         leave.
         4.11.3.2. If the unit commander authorizes the member to resume leave after the
         member completes the duty that resulted in recall, prepare a new AF Form 988. If
         authorized travel, publish orders to return the member to the location where he or she
         received recall notification.
     4.11.4. Absence Over Leave:
14                                            AFI36-3003_AFWASUP_I 14 MARCH 2014


        4.11.4.1. See DoD 7000.14-R, volume 7A, to determine whether an absence was
        unavoidable.
        4.11.4.2. Charge leave for an absence in excess of authorized leave or pass if the unit
        commander later determines to be unavoidable; otherwise, consider it absence
        without leave.
        4.11.4.3. Do not charge leave for an absence in excess of authorized leave caused by
        mental incapacity, detention by civil authorities, and early departure of a mobile unit
        due to operational commitments. This applies whether the absence is avoidable or
        excused as unavoidable, regardless of duration.
        4.11.4.4. Charge leave for other unauthorized absences that the unit commander
        determines to have been avoidable.
     4.11.5. Unable To Return From Leave Because of Illness or Injury. When a member is
     unable to return to duty from leave because of illness or injury:
        4.11.5.1. The member must advise the leave approving authority by the quickest
        means.
        4.11.5.2. The next of kin, attending physician, nearest military medical treatment
        facility (MTF), or ARC may act on the member’s behalf when incapacitated to such a
        degree that notification by the member is not possible.
        4.11.5.3. Upon return from leave, the member presents a statement from the nearest
        MTF or the attending physician regarding the individual’s medical condition. The
        unit commander evaluates the statement before authenticating the leave document.
        4.11.5.4. The unit commander may consult with the local medical treatment facility
        for clarification or recommendation.
        4.11.5.5. Unit commander issues amended leave authorization, if required.
     4.11.6. Medical, Dental, Hospitalized or Placed on Quarters.
        4.11.6.1. Medical or Dental Care. When a member on leave requires medical or
        dental care, he or she reports to the nearest military medical treatment facility. If
        treated at civilian facilities, governing directives authorize medical or dental
        treatment from civilian sources at government expense only for emergency and
        immediate non-emergency care.
        4.11.6.2. Hospitalized or Placed on Quarters. If a member on leave requires
        hospitalization or quarters status, do not charge leave while hospitalized or on
        quarters. Chargeable leave ends the day before and starts again the day following
        hospitalization or quarters status, regardless of the hour of admission or discharge or
        release from quarters.
        4.11.6.3. If a military health care provider places the member on quarters, the
        member’s status changes from leave to quarters, and the medical authority directing
        such status notifies the individual’s commander. The nearest military health care
        provider approves civilian health care provider’s placement of members on quarters.
        If the member desires to revert to leave status after release from quarters:
AFI36-3003_AFWASUP_I 14 MARCH 2014                                                            15


        4.11.6.4. On return to duty, the member provides the leave approving authority with
        a statement from the attending physician or military treatment facility that certifies
        the period of confinement and date of release. This statement is usually the admission
        and disposition list of the medical treatment facility.
        4.11.6.5. The above provisions apply to a member hospitalized or placed on quarters
        while on emergency leave in CONUS or overseas. After termination of
        hospitalization or quarters status, the member contacts the traffic management office
        (TMO) at the nearest Air Force installation for assistance with return transportation, if
        required.
     4.11.7. Medical Care at Personal Expense. When a member elects civilian medical care
     at personal expense:
        4.11.7.1. The member takes ordinary leave to cover any period of time lost from
        duty. This includes the period of convalescence, as well as time actually spent as an
        inpatient in a civilian hospital. This applies when an Air Force physician determines
        the medical procedure is elective on the part of the member. EXAMPLE: Leave for
        cosmetic surgery that the MTF declined to perform or when the member did not
        receive MTF consultation.
        4.11.7.2. Do not charge the period of time lost to duty due to inpatient status as leave
        when an Air Force physician determines a medical procedure is necessary. Following
        the medical procedure, unit commander may grant convalescent leave based upon the
        recommendation of an Air Force physician. For members electing childbirth from
        civilian sources, see paragraph 6.4 regarding convalescent leave.
        4.11.7.3. The member becomes an Air Force patient if he or she experiences
        complications and seeks treatment at an Air Force medical facility. In this instance,
        the unit commander may grant convalescent leave in accordance with usual
        procedures for Air Force patients.
     4.11.8. Civil Confinement. Unit commanders do not authorize leave for the purpose of
     serving sentences to civil confinement because civil confinement, including probated
     sentences thereto, is inconsistent with military status.
     COMMENTS: Members confined by civil authorities while on approved leave may
     continue on leave until the original leave termination date, unless recalled from leave
     status to duty. If unit commander recalls members to duty, commanders terminate leave
     status as of the recall date and change the members’ status to “absent in the hands of civil
     authorities.”
     4.11.9. Absent Without Leave (AWOL). The MPF and HQ AFPC/DPWCS (Casualty
     Services Branch) change members’ leave status to AWOL when members fail to return to
     duty at the end of their leave period.
     4.11.10. Proceed Time. MPFs administer proceed time in accordance with AFI 36-2102,
     Preparation of Personnel Selected for Relocation—Base Level Procedures. The FSO
     computes leave for authorized absences in excess of allowed proceed time.
 16                                             AFI36-3003_AFWASUP_I 14 MARCH 2014


       4.11.11. Travel Time With En Route Leave. The time allowed for PCS or TDY travel is
       not chargeable leave when members take en route leave. The FSO charges leave for any
       authorized absence in excess of allowable travel time and proceed time, if applicable.
       4.11.12. Permissive Reassignment. Charge leave for travel time, delay en route, and time
       spent for house hunting in conjunction with permissive reassignment.
       4.11.13. Missing Port Call. Aerial port passenger section personnel notify the servicing
       MPF and HQ AFPC/DPWCS 72 hours after members miss a port call.
       4.11.14. Retiree Continued on Active Duty. Retirees who continue on active duty
       without a break in service qualify to carry over their leave balance into the period of
       continued active duty.

6. Authorized Leave:
AFI36-3003_AFWASUP_I 14 MARCH 2014                                                              17


   6.1. Annual Leave. Another name for annual leave is “ordinary” leave. Normally, members
   request leave, as accruing, within mission requirements and other exigencies. Member’s
   failure to use leave, as accruing, can result in loss of accrued leave at FY-end leave balancing
   or upon retirement or separation from active duty.
       6.1.1. Use of Annual Leave. Members use annual leave:
          6.1.1.1. For vacation or short periods of rest from duty.
          6.1.1.2. To attend to parental family needs such as illnesses or adoption purposes.
          6.1.1.3. With a PCS or after periods of arduous duty and protracted periods of
          deployment from the home station.
          6.1.1.4. During traditional national holiday periods.
          6.1.1.5. To attend to family emergencies or personal situations caused by natural
          disasters such as floods and hurricanes.
          6.1.1.6. For attendance at spiritual events or for other religious observances.
          6.1.1.7. During the pre-processing period incident to release from active duty.
          6.1.1.8. As terminal leave with retirement or separation from active duty.
NOTE:
Members separating under “for cause” provisions and other separatees separating at the earliest
possible date cannot take terminal leave. They either receive payment for unused accrued leave
or forfeit the accrued days if they receive a discharge under other than honorable conditions.
       6.1.2. Unit Approval Level. Unit commanders are the approval authority for annual leave
       requests and normally delegate approval to a level no lower than the first-line supervisor.
          6.1.2.1. For headquarters’ staff, commanders delegate leave approval to no lower
          than assistant functional deputy directors or equivalent.
          6.1.2.2. Unit commanders can disapprove leave requests for military necessity or in
          the best interest of the Air Force.
       6.1.3. TDY commanders. TDY commanders:
          6.1.3.1. Notify parent organizations of leave requests.
          6.1.3.2. Approve leaves with which the parent organizations agree.
          6.1.3.3. Send e-mail, messages, or datafax memorandums when necessary.
NOTE:
Paragraphs 6.1.3.1 through 6.1.3.3 apply to PERSCO Team Chiefs at deployed locations.
          6.1.3.4. Charge leave to members attending AETC formal schools that close for the
          Christmas and New Year's Day holidays. Do not charge them leave if they perform
          authorized duty at the TDY site or report for approved duty to their home station
          during holiday periods. When their permanent duty station commanders concur,
          members may return to the home station to perform duty. If so, entitlement to
          allowances prescribed in JFTR, paragraph U4130, may apply. See AFR 177-103,
          Travel Transactions at Base Level, chapter 4.

      6.1.4. Commanders Reporting Directly to the Chief of Staff, Vice Chief of Staff or
      Assistance Vice Chief of Staff. These commanders approve their own leave. Send leave
      notification by e-mail, message, or datafax at least 7 days in advance to HQ USAF/CVA.
      Include in the leave notification:
          6.1.4.1. Effective date of leave.
          6.1.4.2. Duration.
          6.1.4.3. Leave address.
          6.1.4.4. Name of acting commander.
NOTE:
HQ USAF/CVA advises commanders when extenuating circumstances require adjustments to
scheduled leaves.
      6.1.5. Leave in Conjunction With TDY. Unit commanders:
          6.1.5.1. Determine TDY is clearly essential to the mission.
          6.1.5.2. Make certain members do not take, schedule, plan, or arrange, in fact or
          appearance, TDY to serve leave desires of the member.
          6.1.5.3. Authorize leave when operationally feasible.
          6.1.5.4. Ensure the government incurs no additional cost incident to leave.
NOTE:
Members may not use non-duty days to extend the TDY or leave period.
      6.1.6. Leave Extensions:
          6.1.6.1. The member must ask, orally or in writing, for the extension sufficiently in
          advance of expiration of leave authorized to permit return to duty at the proper time if
          the approval authority disapproves the extension.
          6.1.6.2. Members who fall ill or need hospitalization while on leave must advise the
          leave-approving authority as soon as possible.
          6.1.6.3. The next of kin, attending physician, nearest MTF, or ARC may act on a
          member's behalf.
      6.1.7. Leave Begins and Ends in the Local Area. The local area is the place where the
      member lives and from which he or she commutes to the duty station. Charge leave for
      duty days and non-duty days (for example, Friday through Monday) when members take
      leave on the day before and the day after non-duty days. This applies to leave taken in the
      local area. EXCEPTION: When a member’s leave ends on a day before a non-duty day,
      the commander may authorize leave on the next duty day for an emergency situation and
      not charge leave for the non-duty days. If the member knew of the emergency situation
      before his or her departure on the original leave, charge the member leave for the
      weekend or other non-duty days.
          6.1.7.1. Normally, leave begins on the effective date reflected on the AF Form 988.
          If the leave start date changes, make the change to the leave status date and leave start
AFI36-3003_AFWASUP_I 14 MARCH 2014                                                         19


          date on the leave form. The member and leave approval authority initial the changes
          before the member departs on leave.
          6.1.7.2. Normally, leave ends on the effective date reflected on the AF Form 988.
          Change the last day of leave on Part III of the leave form if the leave approval
          authority approves an extension or if the member returns early. NOTE: Do not charge
          leave if a member is unable to return from leave due to weather conditions such as
          airport closed due to snowstorm. However, require member to provide documents
          justifying authorized absence from the date leave would normally end through date of
          return.
       6.1.8. Leave Overlaps Two FYs. When a member’s leave period overlaps two FYs, the
       DJMS reduces the member’s leave account in the FY in which the member takes the
       leave. EXAMPLE: The DJMS charges 5 days to the previous FY and 5 days to the next
       FY when a member takes 10 days leave, 26 Sep - 5 Oct.
       6.1.9. FSO. The FSO computes leave for authorized absences in excess of allowed travel
       time, PTDY, and proceed time, if applicable. Members can ask the FSO to verify regular
       and SLA leave balances to determine “use or lose” leave status. “Use or lose” leave
       means leave days members lose if not used before 1 Oct.
       6.1.10. Leave or Duty Status. Determine leave based on actual date that members start
       leave and actual date of return from leave according to Table 1 below. Charge leave for
       non-duty days, including holidays, if the non-duty days fall between leave days. This
       applies to members who take leave in, or away from, the local area. EXCEPTION:
       Commanders may authorize leave on Monday without charging leave for Saturday and
       Sunday if an emergency situation requires a member to take unplanned leave and the
       member is in the local area. This applies when members take leave on Friday.

COMMENTS: Leave status is not necessarily chargeable leave. For example, a member is on
leave status after working at least 50% of the duty day, and the following day is the first day of
chargeable leave. However, a member cannot sign up for space-available transportation before
the first day and time of leave status.
   6.2. Examples. The following examples use a normal work schedule of Monday through
   Friday, 0730 to 1630. (For members on shift work or alternate work schedules, arrange
   equivalent schedules though the days of the week vary.)
       6.2.1. Example 1. If the member starts leave or signs up for space-available
       transportation on Tuesday:
           6.2.1.1. Tuesday is a duty day and Wednesday is the first day of leave when the leave
           approving authority determines that the member performed the majority (over 50%)
           of scheduled duty on Tuesday.
           6.2.1.2. Tuesday is the first day of leave if the leave approval authority determines
           that the member performed less than 50% of scheduled duty on Tuesday.
       6.2.2. Example 2. Saturday is a day of duty and Sunday is the first day of leave, if the
       member, regardless of the hour, starts leave or signs for space-available transportation on
       Saturday.
       6.2.3. Example 3. Sunday is a day of duty and Monday is the first day of leave, if the
       member, regardless of the hour, starts leave or signs up for space-available transportation
       on Sunday.
       6.2.4. Example 4. Friday is a day of duty and Thursday is the last day of leave if the
       leave approving authority determines the member performed the majority (over 50%) of
       scheduled duty on Friday.
       6.2.5. Example 5. If the member returns from leave on Saturday, regardless of the hour,
       Saturday is a day of leave. This also applies if the member returns from leave on Sunday
       or a holiday.
   6.3. Advance Leave. Advance leave is leave granted based on a reasonable expectation that a
   member will accrue leave during the remaining period of active military service.
       6.3.1. Purpose of Advance Leave. The purpose of advance leave is to enable members to
       resolve emergencies or urgent personal situations when they have limited or no accrued
       leave. Members may not depart on leave before the unit commander approves the
       advance leave. Unit commanders may approve requests for members:
           6.3.1.1. Requesting up to 30 days of advance leave and includes leave requests
           which, if approved, result in a negative leave balance of 30 or less days.
           6.3.1.2. Requesting up to 30 days of advance leave in connection with travel, either
           PCS or TDY, including a consecutive overseas tour (COT). This includes leave
           requests which, if approved, result in a negative leave balance of 30 or less days.
           6.3.1.3. Completing technical training and requesting up to 10 days advance leave if
           the first duty station is in CONUS or up to 14 days if outside CONUS.
AFI36-3003_AFWASUP_I 14 MARCH 2014                                                          21


NOTE:
Unit commanders normally approve the lesser of 30 days or the amount of leave the member
will earn during the remaining period of active military service.
      6.3.2. Delegating Approval. Unit commander can delegate approval to a level no lower
      than squadron section commander, deputies, or equivalents. For emergency leave
      situations, first sergeants can approve advance leave when delegated authority to approve
      emergency leave for enlisted members.
          6.3.2.1. At headquarters’ staff, commander can delegate approval to no lower than
          assistant functional deputy directors or equivalents.
          6.3.2.2. AETC training commanders delegate approval authority to no lower than
          first sergeants for enlisted members.
      6.3.3. Thirty Days or More of Advance Leave. HQ AFPC/DPSFOC is the approval
      authority. Send requests for advance leave when members have already taken up to 30
      cumulative days of advance leave through the MAJCOM to HQ AFPC/DPSFOC, 550 C
      Street West, Suite 37, Randolph AFB TX 78150-4739. Include:
          6.3.3.1. Justification and recommendation for the leave requested.
          6.3.3.2. When the requested leave begins and ends.
          6.3.3.3. The number of advance leave days initially approved, if any.
          6.3.3.4. The member's leave balance at the beginning of the initial advance leave
          approval.
          6.3.3.5. The number of days accruing to the expiration of term of service.
          6.3.3.6. The number of additional advance days requested.
NOTE:
For immediate emergencies or urgent personal situations, HQ AFPC/DPSFOC gives telephonic
approval when members have already taken up to 30 cumulative days of advance leave. DSN
665-3415 or commercial (210) 565-3415. First Sergeants ensure commander’s support staff
personnel complete the AF Form 988 and follow up with a message, E-mail, or data fax (DSN
665-2543) within 48 hours, with the information in 6.3.3.1 through 6.3.3.6
      6.3.4. MAJCOM. MAJCOM submits their recommendation on advance leave requests
      when members have already taken 30 cumulative days of advance leave.
      6.3.5. Personnel Support for Contingency Operations (PERSCO) Team. The PERSCO
      Team Chief requests approval for advance leave in excess of 30 days from HQ
      AFPC/DPSFC (datafax DSN 487-5982) and notifies the unit of assignment of the final
      decision.
      6.3.6. Advance Leave Becomes Excess Leave. When a member has taken all the advance
      leave that he or she will be accruing during the remaining period of active service, unit
      commanders change member’s leave status from advance to excess leave. Members carry
      forward advance leave to a new period of service if an enlisted member separates and
      immediately reenlists 3 or more months before expiration of the term of service.

      6.3.7. Advance Leave Not Authorized. Unit commanders may not approve advance
      leave:
             6.3.7.1. For members pending administrative or punitive actions requiring their
             separation at the earliest possible date.
             6.3.7.2. In conjunction with excess leave authorized for members awaiting punitive,
             administrative, or disability discharge.
      6.3.8. Advance Leave and Excess Leave. When authorizing excess leave in conjunction
      with advance leave, advance leave does not accrue during the period of excess leave
      involved. EXAMPLE: A member with ETS 15 Mar 98 requests 30 days leave effective 1
      Oct 97. The member has 2 days accrued leave through 30 Sep 97. The member would
      normally accrue 14 days during the period 1 Oct 97 - 15 Mar 98. Therefore, the member
      would have a total of 16 days accrued and tentative advance leave through ETS. The
      tentative excess leave period is 14 days (30 days requested leave minus 16 days accrued
      and tentative leave). The member will not accrue 1.5 days during the tentative excess
      leave period. Therefore, reduce the 14 days leave that would normally accrue by 1.5 days
      that will not accrue during the excess leave period (see Figure 3 below). This results in
      advance leave of 12.5 days. In this example, the authorized leave is 2 days accrued leave,
      12.5 days advance leave, and 15.5 days excess leave.
      6.3.9. Indebtedness. The Financial Services Office stops or collects, if applicable, all pay
      and allowances paid after member's leave status changes from advance to excess leave.
      There is an additional collection of one half-day for each 6-day increment of excess leave
      (see Figure 3 below). NOTE: See DFAS-DEM 7073.2, volume II, chapter 7.

Figure 3. Non-accrual Days.

For Excess Leave Period                        Subtract this Amount of Leave
1/2-6 days                                     1/2 day.
6 1/2-12 days                                  1 day.
12 1/2-18 days                                 1 1/2 days.
18 1/2-24 days                                 2 days.
24 1/2-31 days                                 2 1/2 days.
Over 31 days                                   Compute in 30 day increments.


   6.4. Convalescent Leave. Convalescent leave is an authorized absence normally for the
   minimal time essential to meet the medical needs for recuperation. It is not chargeable leave.
   The Air Force Surgeon General oversees the convalescent leave program.
      6.4.1. Convalescent Leave Approval. Unit Commander normally approves convalescent
      leave up to 30 days based on the recommendations by either the MTF authority or the
      attending physician most familiar with the member’s medical condition. Commander will
      not approve more than 30 days initial convalescent leave. Extending convalescent leave
      beyond 30 days requires additional medical review and consent. EXCEPTION:
AFI36-3003_AFWASUP_I 14 MARCH 2014                                                             23


       Convalescent leave due to pregnancy or childbirth. NOTE: During short absences of the
       unit commander, the commander’s designated representative may approve, in the
       commander’s name, convalescent leave.
          6.4.1.1. Absence from duty because of pregnancy and childbirth. During pregnancy,
          members will continue to perform normal duties as long as they are medically fit to
          do so. When it is necessary for the member’s or fetus’ health and safety, convalescent
          leave is appropriate as long as it is medically required. For childbirth, postpartum
          convalescent leave following normal pregnancy is 42 days to allow time for the
          mother to recover physically and for the infant’s immune system to develop
          sufficiently to permit placement in a child care facility. Convalescent leave begins the
          day of discharge from the medical treatment facility and continues through the day
          before the member’s return to duty. Medical authorities determine whether the
          mother’s medical condition warrants convalescent leave beyond 42 days.
       6.4.2. Convalescent Leave Requests. Commander will not approve more than 30 days
       initial convalescent leave. Extending convalescent leave beyond 30 days requires
       additional medical review and consent. EXCEPTION: Convalescent leave due to
       pregnancy or childbirth.

  require


      6.4.3. Medical Authority. The medical authority or attending physician determines:
          6.4.3.1. When a medical condition warrants continuance of convalescent leave.
          6.4.3.2. Whether the member can depart the local area while on convalescent leave.
      6.4.4. Convalescent Begins. Convalescent leave begins the day of release from the
      medical treatment facility and continues through the day before the member’s return to
      duty, if applicable, or return to in-hospital status.
      6.4.5. Voluntary Termination. A member may voluntarily terminate convalescent leave
      earlier with the attending physician approval.
      6.4.6. Requesting Ordinary Leave. A member may request ordinary leave after
      completing convalescent leave.
      6.4.7. Terminating Convalescent Leave. The unit commander may terminate
      convalescent leave status if the member’s continued absence from duty would clearly
      have an adverse impact on the readiness or operational mission of the unit. The unit
AFI36-3003_AFWASUP_I 14 MARCH 2014                                                          25


     commander consults the cognizant military health authority to determine whether such
     action is medically advisable.
  6.5. Emergency Leave. Emergency leave is chargeable leave granted for personal or family
  emergencies involving the immediate family. See paragraph 6.5.10 for emergency leave
  requests, paragraph 6.5.11 for travel situations, and paragraph 6.5.12 for travel orders. See
  also AFI 65-103, Temporary Duty Orders, when preparing special orders for emergency
  leave travel. See AFI 36-3020, Family Member Travel, for dependents who may be eligible
  for emergency travel entitlements and member is ineligible for emergency leave. Emergency
  travel entitlements are under the JFTR, chapters 5 and 7.
     6.5.1. Immediate Family. Immediate family consists of the member's spouse and
     member’s or spouse's:
         6.5.1.1. Parents (including stepparents).
         6.5.1.2. Children (including illegitimate children and stepchildren).
         6.5.1.3. Brothers and sisters.
         6.5.1.4. Sole surviving blood relative.
         6.5.1.5. In-loco-parentis person (defined in paragraph 6.5.10, Table 3).
     6.5.2. Emergency Leave Approval. Unit commanders approve initial emergency leave
     periods up to 30 days and extensions up to 30 days. If a member has, or will have, a
     negative leave balance, unit commander considers only that leave which is absolutely
     necessary to take care of the emergency situation. NOTE: The TDY commander or
     PERSCO Team Chief approves emergency leave after notifying and receiving approval
     from the unit of assignment.
     6.5.3. Delegating Emergency Leave Approval:
         6.5.3.1. Unit commanders can delegate approval for emergency leave for enlisted
         members to a level no lower than the first sergeant. When delegated authority to
         approve emergency leave for enlisted members, first sergeants can approve up to 30
         days advance leave. They also can approve excess leave when the combination of
         accrued, advance, and excess leave is 60 days or less.
         6.5.3.2. At headquarters’ staff, commanders can delegate approval to no lower than
         assistant functional deputy directors or equivalents.
     6.5.4. HQ AFPC/DPSFOC Approval. HQ AFPC/DPSFOC approves emergency leave:
         6.5.4.1. If leave requested results in a member having a cumulative negative leave
         balance of over 30 days.
         6.5.4.2. Exceeding 60 days when members have already taken advance or excess
         leaves.
     6.5.5. Unit Commander’s Responsibilities. Unit commanders:
         6.5.5.1. Approve or deny emergency leave on a case-by-case basis based on their
         knowledge of the circumstances.
26                                           AFI36-3003_AFWASUP_I 14 MARCH 2014


        6.5.5.2. Who have reason to doubt the validity of an emergency situation, may
        request assistance from the military Service activity nearest the location of the
        emergency in determining the validity of the emergency situation and the necessity
        for the member’s presence. When necessary, unit commanders may request assistance
        from the ARC to verify emergency situations.
        6.5.5.3. Approve initial periods of emergency leave for no more than 30 days and
        extensions for no more than 30 days.
        6.5.5.4. Advise members to apply for humanitarian or exceptional family member
        reassignment, or separation for hardship reasons if the leave period is more than 60
        days.
        6.5.5.5. Send emergency leave requests to HQ AFPC/DPSFOC via data fax (DSN
        665-2543), with full justification if leave requested results in a member:
            6.5.5.5.1. Having a cumulative negative balance of over 30 days.
            6.5.5.5.2. Taking leave for 60 or more days and member has already taken
            advance or excess leave.
        6.5.5.6. Give members the opportunity to apply for ordinary leave, reassignment, or
        separation for hardship reasons if they do not qualify for emergency leave.
        6.5.5.7. Do not deny emergency leave solely because of lack of funds for funded
        travel.
        6.5.5.8. Do not approve emergency leave for purpose of either increasing the
        member’s travel priority or offsetting personal travel costs.
        6.5.5.9. Ensure members contact the TMO or commercial travel office (CTO) for
        travel arrangements because failure to do so can result in non-reimbursement of travel
        costs.
     6.5.6. Advance Leave. When members do not have sufficient accrued leave to take care
     of urgent personal or emergency situations:
        6.5.6.1. Unit commander approves the lesser of 30 days or the amount of leave they
        will earn during the remaining period of active military service. First sergeants can
        approve advance leave when delegated authority to approve emergency leave for
        enlisted members.
        6.5.6.2. HQ AFPC/DPSFOC approves advance leave for more than 30 days when
        members have already taken 30 cumulative days of advance leave.
        6.5.6.3. The PERSCO Team Chief requests approval for advance leave in excess of
        30 days from HQ AFPC via data fax (DSN 665-2543) and notifies the unit of
        assignment of the final decision.
     6.5.7. Excess Leave for Emergencies. When members use all advance leave that they
     have not yet earned:
        6.5.7.1. Unit commanders may approve excess leave when the combination of
        ordinary, advance, and excess leave is 60 days or less. First sergeants can approve
AFI36-3003_AFWASUP_I 14 MARCH 2014                                                           27


        excess leave when delegated authority to approve emergency leave for enlisted
        members.
        6.5.7.2. HQ AFPC/DPSFC approves excess leave when members have already taken
        more than a total of 60 days cumulative leave (ordinary, advance, excess).
     6.5.8. Emergency Leave Extension:
        6.5.8.1. Members contact the:
           6.5.8.1.1. Organization commander or first sergeant (contact the losing-
           organization commander or first sergeant if on en route leave).
           6.5.8.1.2. Local ARC chapter for help in notifying their unit commander or first
           sergeant.
        6.5.8.2. Unit commanders or first sergeants:
           6.5.8.2.1. Advise members, in writing, of their decision to approve or deny the
           request.
           6.5.8.2.2. Send an information copy to the ARC representative, if applicable.
           6.5.8.2.3. Send requests for leave resulting in 60 or more days of leave that
           include advance or excess days to HQ AFPC/DPSFOC, with full justification.
        6.5.8.3. Losing commanders coordinate changes in reporting with the appropriate
        resource manager in AFPC.
     6.5.9. Emergency Leave Travel (see Table 4, paragraph 6.5.11, Emergency Leave
     Situations).
        6.5.9.1. Applicable directives for emergency leave travel information:
           6.5.9.1.1. AFI 65-103, Temporary Duty Orders, when preparing special orders
           for emergency leave.
           6.5.9.1.2. Emergency travel entitlements are under the JFTR, chapters 5 and 7.
           See JFTR, paragraph U7205, for members stationed overseas, members with
           overseas domiciles, and members who are TDY in or outside CONUS.
           6.5.9.1.3. DoDD 4515.13R, Air Transportation Eligibility, November 1994, with
           changes 1 and 2, and authorizes round-trip, space-required travel via aircraft
           owned or controlled by DoD:
               6.5.9.1.3.1. From overseas to CONUS, Alaska, Hawaii, the Commonwealth
               of Puerto Rico, and possessions of the United States, or any other location
               OCONUS as determined by the Secretarial Process, when authorized or
               approved by the emergency leave granting authority.
               6.5.9.1.3.2. From CONUS to overseas location (see paragraph 6.5.9.2).
               6.5.9.1.3.3. Within and between overseas locations (see paragraph 6.5.9.2).
           6.5.9.1.4. AFI 24-101, Passenger Movement.
           6.5.9.1.5. AFI 36-3020, Family Member Travel, and JFTR, paragraph U7205, for
           family member travel.

               6.5.9.1.6. The JFTR and DoDD 4515.13R authorize round-trip, commercial
               transportation when space-required transportation via aircraft owned or controlled
               by DoD is not available. Before the leave approval authority authorizes round-trip
               commercial transportation, TMO must make a determination that space-required
               transportation via aircraft owned or controlled by DoD is not reasonably
               available. The approval authority must apply this judiciously to ensure the best
               interests of the Air Force and the member are served.
            6.5.9.2. Overseas location for emergency leave purposes is Hawaii, Alaska, the
            Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and possessions of the United States, or any other
            location OCONUS as determined by the Secretarial Process, when authorized or
            approved by the emergency leave granting authority.
            6.5.9.3. The member’s domicile means home of record, place of entry on active duty,
            place of first enlistment, or place of permanent legal residence. See the JFTR,
            paragraph U7205-B3.
            6.5.9.4. Time spent in emergency leave travel via aircraft owned or controlled by
            DoD from overseas to the CONUS aerial port of debarkation (APOD) is not
            chargeable leave. It also is not chargeable from the CONUS aerial port of
            embarkation (APOE) to overseas area or within and between overseas areas and
            return, when required.
            6.5.9.5. Chargeable leave begins the day after the member arrives at the APOD and
            ends the day before the member returns to the APOE.
            6.5.9.6. Active duty members on emergency leave may use space-available
            transportation within CONUS via aircraft owned or controlled by DoD. There is no
            guaranteed space for such passengers. The space-available transportation is on a first-
            come, first-served basis. The travel time is chargeable leave.
            6.5.9.7. Different entitlements apply when members travel from the CONUS to
            overseas than when they travel from overseas to the CONUS. Consult the JFTR for
            specific entitlements.
        6.5.10. The following table explains when to approve or disapprove emergency leave
        requests.

         6.7.7.2. May not change established dates of separation so that members may take
         unused leave.
         6.7.7.3. Ensure members taking ordinary leave instead of terminal leave return 15
         days before their scheduled dates of separation or retirement to prevent pay problems.
  6.8. Excess Leave. Excess leave is leave members normally use for personal or family
  emergency situations when members can not request advance leave. Excess leave is a no-pay
  status; therefore, entitlement to pay and allowances and leave accrual stops on member’s first
  day of excess leave.
     6.8.1. Unit Commanders or Designees With General or Special Court-Martial Convening
     Authority:
AFI36-3003_AFWASUP_I 14 MARCH 2014                                                           37

         6.8.1.2. If approving excess leave, advise members they must use all accrued leave
         first.
         6.8.1.3. Advise members excess leave begins the day after accrued leave ends.
NOTE:
When unit commanders send requests recommending approval through the chain of command,
any approval authority in the chain may subsequently deny the requests.
      6.8.2. Unit Commanders Directing Appellate Review Leave. When directing appellate
      review leave, approve travel according to the JFTR, paragraph U7506, and AFI 36-2102,
      Base-Level Relocations Procedures, and advise members they may take either:
         6.8.2.1. Ordinary leave and then excess leave.
         6.8.2.2. Payment for accrued leave (ask the FSO about accrued leave pay
         entitlement) and excess leave.
         6.8.2.3. Some ordinary leave, payment for remaining accrued leave, and excess
         leave.
      6.8.3. Reverting to Pay Status From Appellate Review Leave. For overruled or set-aside
      court-martial sentences, members:
         6.8.3.1. Qualify for pay and allowances for excess leave taken when directed by the
         unit commander.
         6.8.3.2. Do not qualify for pay and allowances for voluntary excess leave taken.
         6.8.3.3. Do not get credit for accrued leave for which they elected payment before
         departing on appellate-review leave.
      6.8.4. Excess Leave Periods. Unit commanders advise members:
         6.8.4.1. Excess leave is leave without pay and allowances, and they will not receive
         disability pay, if injured, for time spent on excess leave.
         6.8.4.2. The FSO stops all pay and allowances effective the first day of excess leave.
         The FSO collects, if applicable, any pay and allowances paid. When members
         separate from active duty, there is an additional collection for non-accrual of leave
         resulting from periods of excess leave. This is one half-day for each six-day period of
         excess leave.
         6.8.4.3. The period of excess leave will not count toward the fulfillment of any active
         duty service commitment.
      6.8.5. The following table explains excess leave requests.

           6.8.6.5. I understand I will not receive disability pay if injured for time spent on
           excess leave.
           6.8.6.6. I understand the FSO stops all pay and allowances effective the first day of
           excess leave.
           6.8.6.7. I understand the FSO collects, if applicable, any pay and allowances.
           6.8.6.8. I understand there is a collection for non-accrual of leave resulting from
           periods of excess leave upon separation from active duty. This is one half-day for
           each six-day period of excess leave.
           6.8.6.9. I understand that the period of excess leave will not count toward the
           fulfillment of any active duty service commitment.
    6.9. Environmental and Morale Leave (EML). EML is leave authorized at an overseas
    installation where adverse environmental conditions require special arrangements for leave in
 42                                               AFI36-3003_AFWASUP_I 14 MARCH 2014


   desirable places at periodic intervals. The EML taken is ordinary leave. Unified commanders
   designate the authorized EML duty locations and destinations.
       6.9.1. Purpose. The purpose of EML is to make use of DoD-owned or -controlled aircraft
       to supplement in-country leave schedules established to carry out basic leave programs.
       6.9.2. Funded EML. Funded EML authorizes members DoD-owned or -controlled air
       transportation from EML duty locations for purposes of taking leave in an EML
       destination site. Do not charge leave for member’s time spent en route to and returning
       from an EML destination site. Charge leave for the period of time at the EML destination
       site. Leave begins the day after the member arrives at the aerial port of debarkation that
       services the destination site. Leave ends the day before the member returns to the aerial
       port of embarkation. See JFTR, paragraph U7207.
       6.9.3. Unfunded EML. Unfunded EML authorizes members space-available air
       transportation from EML duty locations for purposes of taking leave in an EML
       destination site. Charge leave for travel time to and from, and for the period of time at, an
       EML destination site when traveling on a space-available basis. The MAJCOM/DPA
       equivalent or designee grants extensions for unfunded EML. Any leave-approving
       authority within the chain of command can deny requests without referring them to a
       higher-level headquarters.
       6.9.4. Required Travel Documents. When traveling outside the United States, ensure
       member checks AFI 24-405, Department of Defense Foreign Clearance Guide, for
       required travel documents. Instruct members to comply with foreign government
       procedures as required by AFI 24-405, to include the DoD Travel Security Advisory. The
       passport/visa section in the MPF maintains a copy of the guide and advisory.

Section D—Pass (Regular and Special)

7. Introduction. This section provides information to help unit commanders understand regular
and special pass periods. These are absences authorized, not chargeable as leave, to provide
respite from the working environment or for other reasons. This section contains:
   7.1. Pass Period, paragraph 8.1.
   7.2. Regular Pass, paragraph 8.2.
   7.3. Special Pass, paragraph 8.3.
   7.4. Regular and Special Pass Guidelines, paragraph 8.4.
8. Regular and Special Pass Information.
   8.1. Pass Period. A pass period is an authorized absence from duty for a relatively short
   time.
       8.1.1. It starts from the end of normal working hours on a duty day and ends at the
       beginning of normal working hours the next duty day.
       8.1.2. At the beginning and the end of the pass period, the member is actually in the local
       area. The local area is the place from which they regularly commute to work.
   8.2. Regular Pass.
AFI36-3003_AFWASUP_I 14 MARCH 2014                                                             43


     8.2.1. A regular pass (liberty) starts after normal working hours on a given day and stops
     at the beginning of normal working hours on the next working day.
     8.2.2. A regular pass normally begins at the end of working hours on Friday afternoon
     until the beginning of normal working hours on the following Monday when non-duty
     days are Saturday and Sunday.
     8.2.3. A regular pass period (non-duty days) for units on non-traditional work schedules
     (alternate or compressed work schedules) may not exceed the 4-day special pass
     limitation. The combination of non-duty days and a public holiday may not exceed the 4-
     day special pass limitation. The combination of 3 non-duty days and a public holiday
     during a compressed work schedule is a regular pass period.
     8.2.4. A DoD Management Headquarters or Headquarters Supporting Activity, as
     defined in DoD Directive 5100.73, Department of Defense Management Headquarters
     and Headquarters Support Activities, determines whether Monday or Friday is
     compensatory time off with a holiday observed on a Tuesday or Thursday. An authorized
     4-day holiday period consisting of a holiday, compensatory time off day, and a weekend
     is a regular pass period. For the purpose of this AFI, a DoD Management Headquarters or
     Headquarters Supporting Activity refers to the MAJCOMs and equivalents.
  8.3. Special Pass. Unit commanders may award 3- or 4-day special passes for special
  occasions or circumstances, such as reenlistment or for some type of special recognition or
  compensatory time off. They may delegate approval to a level no lower than squadron
  section commander, deputies, or equivalents. Special passes start after normal working hours
  on a given day. They stop at the beginning of normal working hours on either the 4th day for
  a 3-day special pass or the 5th day for a 4-day special pass. A 3-day special pass can be
  Friday through Sunday, Saturday through Monday, or Tuesday through Thursday. A 4-day
  special pass can be Thursday through Sunday or Saturday through Tuesday or Friday through
  Monday. This applies to a normal Monday through Friday workweek. See paragraph 8.4.9
  for safe travel guidelines.
     8.3.1. (Added-AFWA) Commanders are authorized to provide returning Airmen with
     one day of post-deployment downtime for every six days deployed, up to a maximum of
     14 days. During downtime, personnel will have the option of taking a four-day pass
     without travel restrictions as long as the pass begins and ends in the local area, and is not
     used in conjunction with leave. For the remainder of the downtime, personnel must
     remain “present for duty” with their duty location being their home. Personnel should
     use this time to attend to both official and personal matters. Members who leave the
     local area during this downtime must follow standard leave procedures. Prior to taking
     time off or leave, the AFWA post-deployment processing checklist must be completed.
     As a reminder, leave entitlement is governed by law and must be used in accordance with
     AFI 36-3003, Military Leave Program. Members are ineligible for special leave accrual
     if post-deployment recovery time precluded using leave.
  8.4. Regular and Special Pass Guidelines. Unit commanders:
     8.4.1. Impose no mileage restrictions. However, they may require members to be able to
     return to duty within a reasonable time in the event of an operational mission requirement
     such as a recall, unit alert, or unit emergency. At training bases, commanders can require
 44                                               AFI36-3003_AFWASUP_I 14 MARCH 2014


       members to be able to return in time to resume training or class attendance. Commanders
       need to base all restrictions on reasonable and legitimate military requirements.
       8.4.2. Inform members that the authorized absence that exceeds the pass period is
       chargeable leave if they fail to return from an authorized pass period.
       8.4.3. Do not grant a special pass in conjunction with leave.
       8.4.4. Do not grant special passes in succession or in series.
       8.4.5. Ensure commander’s support staff personnel process an AF Form 988 when
       members fail to return from pass and need unplanned leave.
       8.4.6. Charge members leave for absence not excused under DoD 7000.14-R, volume
       7A.
       8.4.7. Inform members they cannot use regular or special pass periods to extend TDY
       periods.
       8.4.8. Do not grant a special pass in conjunction with non-duty days exceeding the 3-day
       or 4-day special pass limitation.
       8.4.9. Safe Travel Guidelines. Members on non-duty status (regular or special pass)
       should use Operational Risk Management (ORM) principles to assess all hazards and
       control risks prior to excessive or hazardous travel, especially by automobile. Applicable
       guidelines are in AFI 91-213, Operational Risk Management. A comprehensive ORM
       assessment may conclude that fatigue or road conditions are high risks requiring a change
       to travel plans.

Section E—Special Leave Accrual (SLA)

9. Introduction. This section describes the SLA provisions when deployments or assignments
to a hostile-fire or imminent-danger pay area prohibit members from using leave. The SLA also
applies when deployments or assignments to designated operational missions at the national level
prohibit members from using leave. It provides information on restoring leave lost at FY-end
leave balancing. It also provides information on the automatic carry-over by the Defense Finance
and Accounting Service (DFAS). This section contains:
   9.1. Leave in Excess of 60 Days at FY-End Balancing, paragraph 10.1.
   9.2. SLA Eligibility, paragraph 10.2.
   9.3. Restoring Leave Lost on 1 Oct, paragraph 10.3
   9.4. Automatic Carry-over, paragraph 10.4.
   9.5. Effective Date of SLA, paragraph 10.5.
   9.6. Submitting SLA Requests, paragraph 10.6.
   9.7. SLA Approval Authority, paragraph 10.7.
   9.8. SLA Disapproval, paragraph 10.8.
   9.9. SLA Not Authorized, paragraph 10.9.
10. SLA Provisions:
AFI36-3003_AFWASUP_I 14 MARCH 2014                                                           45


   10.1. Leave in Excess of 60 Days at Fiscal Year-end Balancing. Members lose leave over 60
   days at the end of the FY unless eligible for up to 60 days of SLA. The purpose of SLA is to
   prevent members from losing accrued leave if they are unable to take normal leave due to
   significant and unforeseen operational mission requirements. Members are ineligible for
   special leave accrual consideration if they returned from deployment and had the opportunity
   to use leave but failed to do so. See paragraph 10.9 for other situations rendering members
   ineligible for SLA consideration.
   10.2. SLA Eligibility. Members are eligible for SLA if one of the following circumstances
   prohibited normal leave use:
      10.2.1. Deployment to an operational mission at the national level for a continuous
      period of at least 60 days.
      10.2.2. Assignment or deployment for a continuous period of at least 60 days to unit,
      headquarters, and supporting staffs when their involvement supporting a designated
      operational mission at the national level prohibits them from taking leave.
      10.2.3. Deployment for at least 60, but less than 120, consecutive days to a designated
      hostile-fire or imminent-danger pay area.
      10.2.4. Deployment to a hostile-fire or imminent-danger pay area for 120 or more
      consecutive days and receive this special pay for 4 or more consecutive months.
NOTE:
Examples of qualifying deployments include JOINT ENDEAVOR, PROVIDE COMFORT, OR
SOUTHERN WATCH. In some instances, the deployment may overlap two FYs (for example,
deployment 15 Sep - 14 Nov).
   10.3. Restoring Leave Lost on 1 Oct. Members unable to take leave due to qualifying
   deployments may have only that portion of lost leave restored that could possibly have been
   taken before the end of the FY. EXAMPLE: A member deploys on 15 Sep with a leave
   balance of 82.5 days as of 30 Sep, and loses 22.5 days on 1 Oct. The unit commander can
   only recommend restoring 15 days that the member could have taken beginning 16 Sep. The
   member loses 7.5 days because the member could not have taken 22.5 days to reduce his or
   her leave balance to 60 days by the end of the FY. See paragraph 10.7 for approval authority.
   10.4. Automatic Carry-over. The DFAS center may automatically carry forward up to 60
   days. This occurs when members serve for at least 120 consecutive days in a hostile-fire or
   imminent-danger pay area and receive this pay for at least 4 consecutive months. The DFAS
   center uses inputs of a PCS arrival and departure or the start and stop of a hostile-fire or
   imminent-danger pay entitlement for a TDY period of more than 120 days. The SLA upon
   departing the area of responsibility (AOR) is the leave balance brought forward into the AOR
   plus leave accrued in the AOR, minus leave used in the AOR. Members cannot carry over
   leave earned after departing the AOR. They lose this leave at FY-end balancing unless used
   before 1 Oct.
   10.5. Effective Date of SLA. SLA carried forward or restored is effective 1 Oct. SLA is lost
   unless used before the end of the third FY after the FY in which service in a hostile-fire or
   imminent-danger pay area ends. For members who served in a duty assignment in support of
   a contingency operation, SLA restored on 1 Oct of the current FY is lost unless used before 1
46                                            AFI36-3003_AFWASUP_I 14 MARCH 2014


  Oct of the third year after the FY in which restored. Although members have 3 FYs to use
  SLA, the DFAS center accounts for the use of SLA by using the last leave earned is the first
  leave used. EXAMPLE: SLA of 15 days on 1 Oct and a member takes 10 days leave 21 - 30
  Nov. In this example, the member has a leave balance of 80 days as of 30 Nov (60 + 15 days
  of SLA + 5 days accrued 1 Oct - 30 Nov = 80). In this instance, the DFAS center reduces the
  SLA by 5 days since the member took more leave (10 days) than accrued (5 days). The leave
  balance is 80 - 10 days (5 of which are SLA) = 70 days, 10 of which are SLA. If the member
  had taken 5 days of leave, the SLA would still be 15 days.
  10.6. Submitting SLA Requests. NOTE: SLA provisions do not apply if 3 FYs have passed
  since member lost leave. In these cases, see the note in paragraph 10.9.7 Unit commanders:
     10.6.1. Submit requests for members who lose leave on 1 Oct through command
     channels to the MAJCOM or FOA Director of Personnel (DP) or equivalent.
     EXCEPTION: The joint organizations in which members are serving determine the
     eligibility of members in joint organizations assigned to units, headquarters, and
     supporting staffs.
     10.6.2. Include full justification with all requests, including documentation showing how
     members managed their leave during the year.
     10.6.3. Recommend restoring only that portion of leave that member could possibly have
     taken before the end of the FY.
  10.7. SLA Approval Authority. The MAJCOM or FOA/DP or equivalent (colonel or above)
  approves SLA for their organization. At joint organizations, the senior Air Force officer
  representative on staff approves SLA for members serving in joint organizations and
  assigned to units, headquarters, and supporting staffs.
     10.7.1. Send requests to update restored leave to DFAS-DE/FJPA, 6760 East Irvington
     Place, Denver CO 80279-3000. Use organization and control numbers by fiscal year to
     identify updates, for example, ACC YY-001 or USACOM YY001.
     10.7.2. Make the effective date the first of the fiscal year. For instance, member loses
     leave at FY93-end balancing; the effective date of restoration is 1 October 1994.
     10.7.3. Include point of contact (name and grade), organization, office symbol, and DSN
     on each update.
  10.8. SLA Disapproval. Any commander in the chain of command may deny a member’s
  request for SLA without referring it to a higher-level authority when the member’s request
  does not meet the criteria for SLA consideration.
  10.9. SLA Not Authorized. Members are ineligible for SLA when the following precludes
  using leave:
     10.9.1. Normal PCS moves and TDYs.
     10.9.2. Base closures.
     10.9.3. Hospitalizations, aero-evacuations, quarters, and convalescent leaves.
     10.9.4. Details and special working groups.
     10.9.5. Training exercises, attending schools or courses, and research requirements.
AFI36-3003_AFWASUP_I 14 MARCH 2014                                                             47


       10.9.6. Pending separations and retirements.
       10.9.7. Workload after return from deployment and members did not take leave before 1
       Oct.
NOTE:
Members not eligible for SLA can request recovery of days lost by application, DD Form 149,
Application for Correction of Military Records Under the Provisions of Title 10, U.S. Code
Section 1552. See AFI 36-2603, Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records. Member’s
application must clearly establish that an error or injustice by the Air Force caused the member’s
lost leave. If the Board restores leave to current leave account, members must use these days
before the end of the current FY.

Section F—Permissive TDY (PTDY)

11. Introduction. This section describes PTDY, an administrative absence under DoD
Directive 1327.5, Leave and Liberty, for which funded TDY is not proper. It helps unit
commanders understand the reasons for which they may authorize PTDY. The lack of official
TDY funds is not a reason to grant PTDY. This section contains:
   11.1. General Information, paragraph 12.1.
   11.2. Exception to Policy, paragraph 12.2.
   11.3. Commander Responsibilities, paragraph 12.3.

   in Table 7 or paragraph 12.8 through command channels to HQ AFPC/DPFFOC, 550 C
   Street West, Suite 37, Randolph, AFB TX 78150-4739. AFPC/DPFFOC will review, make a
   recommendation and forward the request to HQ USAF/DP for final determination. HQ
   USAF/DP is the decision authority for all requests involving a general officer. HQ
   USAF/DPP is the decision authority for all others. Include an explanation of the
   circumstances for PTDY and justification for favorable consideration. Submit request early
   enough to allow sufficient time for processing. The MAJCOM submits recommendation and
   reasons for approval or disapproval.
   12.3. Responsibilities. Unit commanders:

       TDY orders.
       12.3.8. Charge leave for any additional absence beyond the approved PTDY.
       12.3.9. May deny PTDY requests without referring them to higher-level headquarters.
       12.3.10. Do not grant PTDY for reasons in paragraph 12.8.
       12.3.11. Do not authorize PTDY for house hunting en route with PCS. EXCEPTION:
       May authorize PTDY for members with TDY en route to new assignment or for members
       authorized to relocate family members to a designated place en route to or returning from
       an unaccompanied tour.
NOTE:
The senior Air Force commander in a theater of operation suspends PTDY in areas of conflict
until hostilities cease.
   12.4. PTDY Approval:
       12.4.1. Unit commanders may approve PTDY up to the specified periods stated in Table
       7.
       12.4.2. Unit commanders may delegate approval authority to a level no lower than
       squadron section commander, deputies, or equivalents.

       functional deputy directors or equivalents.
       12.4.4. Wing commanders or equivalents may approve PTDY up to the specified periods
       stated in Table 7.
       12.4.5. HQ AFPC/DPSFOC is approval authority for PTDY beyond 30 days when a
       member requests additional PTDY to remain with a dependent patient or member patient
       at an MTF not in the local area. Send the request with supporting documentation to HQ
       AFPC/DPSFOC, 550 C Street West, Suite 37, Randolph AFB TX 78150-4739 via data
       fax (DSN 665-2543). See Table 7, rules 7-10. Also send requests with supporting
       justification to HQ AFPC/DPSFOC when members request additional PTDY beyond
       other specified periods stated in Table 7.
   12.5. PTDY or Duty Status. Unit commanders charge members PTDY for non-duty days
   when they are on PTDY before and after non-duty days, including holidays.
AFI36-3003_AFWASUP_I 14 MARCH 2014                                                              49

Section G—Unique Leave Provisions

13. Introduction. This section helps commanders understand the various unique leave
provisions. This section contains:
   13.1. In-Place Consecutive Overseas Tour (IPCOT), paragraph 14.1.
   13.2. Deferred Consecutive Overseas Tour (COT), paragraph 14.2.
   13.3. Determining Deferred COT and Using the IPCOP or COT Entitlement, paragraph 14.3.
   13.4. Scheduling IPCOT and Deferred COT, paragraph 14.4.
   13.5. COT or IPCOT Designated Places, paragraph 14.5.
   13.6. Instructions for Preparing DD Form 1610 for IPCOT or Deferred COT Leave,
   paragraph 14.6, Table 9.
   13.7. Special Rest and Recuperation (SR&R) or Overseas Tour Extension Incentive Program
   (OTEIP), paragraph 14.7.
   13.8. Instructions for Preparing DD Form 1610 for 15 days SR&R, paragraph 14.8, Table
   10.
   13.9. Rest and Recuperation (R&R), paragraph 14.9.
   13.10. Recruiter Assistance Program, paragraph 14.10.
   13.11. Air Force Academy, paragraph 14.11.
   13.12. United Nations-Related Leave and Pass, paragraph 14.12.
   13.13. Educational Leave of Absence, paragraph 14.13.
14. Unique Leave Provisions:
   14.1. IPCOT. IPCOT refers to members assigned to a consecutive tour at the same overseas
   duty station. They have one year from the effective date of the IPCOT to use the travel and
   transportation allowances. The leave taken is ordinary leave charged based on authorized
   allowable travel. See paragraph 14.2 for exception to the one year limitation when members
   unable to use the COT leave travel due to duty in connection with a contingency operation.
   14.2. Deferred COT. Deferred COT refers to members unable to use the COT leave travel
   and transportation allowances between the two tours because of military necessity, or when
   deferred by the member when relocating within the same geographical/command area.
   Members have until the end of their new tour to use the COT leave travel and transportation
   allowances, otherwise the entitlement expires. The leave taken is ordinary leave charged
   based on authorized allowable travel time. Members unable to use the entitlement before
   completing the new tour due to duty in connection with contingency operations may defer
   travel until not more than 1 year after the completion of the duties precluding travel. In this
   case, the member is still entitled to leave travel from the new PDS (i.e., the PDS after
   departure from the OCONUS location from which deferred travel could not be taken) to an
   authorized location. The cost limitation for travel from this ‘new’ PDS and return is the cost
   from the PDS from which deferred travel could not be taken to the HOR and return.
NOTE:
AFI36-3003_AFWASUP_I 14 MARCH 2014                                                            69


The additional deferment based solely on duty performed in connection with a contingency
operation is a one-time additional entitlement and cannot be further extended. If members do not
qualify for an extension based on duty in connection with a contingency operation, they may
submit a DD Form 149, Application for Correction of Military Records Under the
Provisions of Title 10, U.S. Code Section 1552. See AFI 36-2603, Air Force Board for
Correction of Military Records. Member’s application must establish that an error or injustice by
the Air Force prevented the member from using the entitlement within the specified time frame.
   14.3. Determining Deferred COT and Using the IPCOT or COT Entitlement.
       14.3.1. Review the member’s PCS orders. The orders should contain the authorization to
       defer the COT entitlement and the authorization (if applicable) to take leave (non-COT)
       en route. The losing commander is the approval authority to approve the deferred COT
       entitlement and non-COT leave en route. If there is no authorization to defer the COT
       entitlement on the orders, consider the COT entitlement used. If the orders authorize
       deferred COT, check with the FSO to determine the number of days leave en route taken.
       Effective 1 Dec 98, the non-COT leave en route cannot exceed 10 days. If the member
       took at least 11 days leave en route, consider the COT entitlement used.
           14.3.1.1. This is not applicable to members who did not traverse the CONUS on
           PCS. Members not traversing the CONUS are authorized to defer their own COT
           leave travel. The deferral is not on the PCS orders. For example, members going PCS
           from Ramstein AF GE to Lakenheath AB UI or from Eielson AFB AK to Elmendorf
           AFB AK.
       14.3.2. If the authorization for the deferred COT entitlement is on the orders but the FSO
       determines member took more than 10 days non-COT leave en route, consider the COT
       entitlement used. The member may request reinstatement of the entitlement by submitting
       a request for a review of his or her circumstances to HQ USAF/DPRC through command
       channels. If the leave en route exceeds the 10-day limitation due to reasons beyond the
       member’s control, the member may request a review of his or her circumstances. The
       member must submit a written request through the chain of command to HQ
       USAF/DPRC, 1040 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1040. If the
       determination is made that the member did not use the deferred COT leave travel
       entitlement, the member will be required to reimburse the government for PCS COT
       leave travel payments made on the PCS voucher.
   14.4. Scheduling IPCOT and Deferred COT Leave. When a member arrives at the new duty
   station, PCS orders should show member authorized deferred COT. The unit works with the
   member to schedule the IPCOT or COT leave and makes sure the member uses the travel
   entitlement. Since the IPCOT and COT travel is a statutory entitlement, members forfeit this
   entitlement if not used within the specified one-year time frame. Use Table 9 to prepare the
   DD Form 1610 for the COT or IPCOT leave. Unit commanders:
       14.4.1. Ensure members schedule and take IPCOT leaves within 1 year of the effective
       date of IPCOT.
       14.4.2. Ensure members schedule and take deferred COT leaves within 1 year of the day

        connection with authorized leave from, and return to, the overseas duty station. The
        JFTR, paragraph U7200-A, explains the entitlement for members and their command-
        sponsored dependents who travel from the overseas duty station to the home of record
        (HOR) or place of residence and return. The government reimburses authorized travel
        and transportation expenses.
     14.5. COT or IPCOT Designated Places:
        14.5.1. Commanders send requests for travel via a designated place or alternate location

        U7200-A3b.
        14.5.2. HQ USAF/DPRC normally recommends approval on applications forwarded for
        a Secretarial determination on travel to an alternate location in accordance with JFTR,
        paragraph U7200-A3b (example: members who have an overseas HOR want to visit

                                  15 DECEMBER 1998

SUMMARY OR REVISIONS

This change incorporates interim change (IC) 98-1 which establishes a 10-day limitation for non-
consecutive overseas tour (COT) leave en route (paragraph 14.3). See the last attachment of the
publication, IC 98-1, for the complete IC. A star (*) indicates revision from the previous edition.

14.3. Determining Deferred COT and Using the IPCOT or COT Entitlement.

14.3.1. Review the member’s PCS orders. The orders should contain the authorization to defer
the COT entitlement and the authorization (if applicable) to take leave (non-COT) en route. The
losing commander is the approval authority to approve the deferred COT entitlement and non-
COT leave en route. If there is no authorization to defer the COT entitlement on the orders,
consider the COT entitlement used. If the orders authorize deferred COT, check with the FSO to
determine the number of days leave en route taken. Effective 1 Dec 98, the non-COT leave en
route cannot exceed 10 days. If the member took at least 11 days leave en route, consider the
COT entitlement used.

14.3.1.1. This is not applicable to members who did not traverse the CONUS on PCS. Members
not traversing the CONUS are authorized to defer their own COT leave travel. The deferral is not
on the PCS orders. For example, members going PCS from Ramstein AF GE to Lakenheath AB
UI or from Eielson AFB AK to Elmendorf AFB AK.

14.3.2. If the authorization for the deferred COT entitlement is on the orders but the FSO
determines member took more than 10 days non-COT leave en route, consider the COT
entitlement used. The member may request reinstatement of the entitlement by submitting a
request for a review of his or her circumsytances to HQ USAF/DPRC through command
channels. If the leave en route exceeds the 10-day limitation due to reasons beyond the member’s
control, the member may request a review of his or her circumstances. The member must submit
a written request through the chain of command to HQ USAF/DPRC, 1040 Air Force Pentagon,
Washington DC 20330-1040. If the determination is made that the member did not use the
deferred COT leave travel entitlement, the member will be required to reimburse the government
for PCS COT leave travel payments made on the PCS voucher. NOTE: The member must
request the waiver prior to the one year COT leave travel time limit. The one year time limit is
set by statute and cannot be waived.

                                    14 APRIL 2000

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This change incorporates interim change (IC) 2000-1 that (1) clarifies that during short absences
of the unit commander, the commander’s designated representative may approve, in the
commander’s name, requests for leave (paragraph 4.2), (2) clarifies that unit commanders may
delegate disapproval authority to a level no lower than squadron section commander, deputies, or
equivalents (for headquarters staff, no lower than assistant functional deputy directors or
equivalents) (paragraph 4.3), (3) clarifies that during short absences of the unit commander, the
commander’s representative may approve, in the commander’s name, convalescent leave
(paragraph 6.4.1), (4) clarifies that the period of excess leave does not count towards the
fulfillment of any active duty service commitment (paragraphs 6.8.4.3 and 6.8.6.9), (5) clarifies
that authorized emergency leave travel is according to the JFTR, paragraph U7205-C1b(1) and to
refer to the JFTR for information on using the cost of emergency leave transportation to a
CONUS international airport nearest the location from which a member or his dependents depart
as a cost limit for transportation to any other airport in the CONUS that is closer to the
destination (Table 4, rule 1, column C), (6) clarifies that a commander may award a special pass
when a member reenlists and that a 4-day special pass can be Friday through Monday (paragraph
8.3), (7) clarifies that the unit commander may approve up to 10 days PTDY for a member to
take the Medical College Admission Test when applying under the Air Force Health Professions
Scholarship Program or for a required interview for acceptance into the graduate-training
program at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (Table 7, rule 18), (8)
clarifies that a unit commander may approve up to 10 days PTDY for a member to attend
national conventions or meetings hosted by service-connected organizations (Table 7, rule 24),
(9) clarifies that a unit commander may approve up to 12 days PTDY for a member to participate
in events, activities, or gatherings that have been pre-approved by HQ AFRS/CC because of
potential positive impact on the Air Force recruiting mission as part of the We Are All Recruiters
Program (Table 7, rule 46),and (10) clarifies that the Recruiter Assistance Program authorizes all
active duty members up to 12 days of non-chargeable leave to assist recruiters by applying
through the local recruiting squadron or HQ AFRS/RSOAP (paragraph 14.10.1), See the last
attachment of the publication, IC 2000-1, for the complete IC. A bar ( ) indicates revision from
the previous edition.

4.2. Leave Approval Authority. While commanders have final approval authority, they may
delegate approval authority according to the organization’s needs. They may delegate it normally
to a level no lower than squadron section commander, deputies, or equivalent (for headquarters
staff, no lower than assistant functional deputy directors or equivalents). NOTE: During short
absences of the unit commander, the commander’s designated representative may approve, in the
commander’s name.

4.3.1. Unit commanders may delegate disapproval authority to a level no lower than squadron
section commander, deputies, or equivalent (for headquarters staff, no lower than assistant
functional deputy directors or equivalents).

6.4.1. Convalescent Leave Approval. Unit Commander normally approves convalescent leave up
to 30 days based on the recommendations by either the MTF authority or the attending physician
most familiar with the member’s medical condition. Commander will not approve more than 30
days initial convalescent leave. Extending convalescent leave beyond 30 days requires additional
medical review and consent. EXCEPTION: Convalescent leave due to pregnancy or childbirth.
NOTE: During short absences of the unit commander, the commander’s designated
representative may approve, in the commander’s name, convalescent leave.

6.8.4.3. The period of excess leave will not count toward the fulfillment of any active duty
service commitment.

6.8.6.9. I understand that the period of excess leave will not count toward the fulfillment of any
active duty service commitment.

14.2. Deferred COT. Deferred COT refers to members unable to use the COT leave travel and
transportation allowances between the two tours because of military necessity, or when deferred
by the member when relocating within the same geographical/command area. Members have
until the end of their new tour to use the COT leave travel and transportation allowances,
otherwise the entitlement expires. The leave taken is ordinary leave charged based on authorized
allowable travel time. Members unable to use the entitlement before completing the new tour due
to duty in connection with contingency operations may defer travel until not more than 1 year
after the completion of the duties precluding travel. In this case, the member is still entitled to
leave travel from the new PDS (i.e., the PDS after departure from the OCONUS location from
which deferred travel could not be taken) to an authorized location. The cost limitation for travel
from this ‘new’ PDS and return is the cost from the PDS from which deferred travel could not be
taken to the HOR and return.
NOTE following paragraph 14.2:NOTE: The additional deferment based solely on duty
performed in connection with a contingency operation is a one-time additional entitlement and
cannot be further extended. If members do not qualify for an extension based on duty in
connection with a contingency operation, they may submit a DD Form 149, Application for
Correction of Military Records Under the Provisions of Title 10,U.S. Code Section 1552.
See AFI 36-2603, Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records. Member’s application
must establish that an error or injustice by the Air Force prevented the member from using the
entitlement within the specified time frame.
14.3.2. If the authorization for the deferred COT entitlement is on the orders but the FSO
determines member took more than 10 days non-COT leave en route, consider the COT
entitlement used. The member may request reinstatement of the entitlement by submitting a
request for a review of his or her circumstances to HQ USAF/DPRC through command channels.
If the leave en route exceeds the 10-day limitation due to reasons beyond the member’s control,
the member may request a review of his or her circumstances. The member must submit a
written request through the chain of command to HQ USAF/DPRC, 1040 Air Force Pentagon,
Washington DC 20330-1040. If the determination is made that the member did not use the
deferred COT leave travel entitlement, the member will be required to reimburse the government
for PCS COT leave travel payments made on the PCS voucher.

15 FEBRUARY 2005
SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This change incorporates interim change (IC) 2005-1 (Attachment 5). Clarifies members are no
longer restricted to the 90-day terminal leave, permissive TDY (PTDY), and processing time
limitation in conjunction with separation or retirement. Members may now take such terminal
leave, PTDY (20 days CONUS or 30 OCONUS as authorized by the losing commander) and
processing days without limit. Deletes paragraph 4.2.5 Updates paragraph 10.1 and 10.4 to
reflect changes in the law to allow members to carry up to 60 days of leave in Special Leave
Accrual (SLA). Updates paragraph 12.2, to reflect policy change for approval of Exception to
PTDY Policy. See the last attachment of the publication, IC 2005-1, for the complete IC. A bar

4.2.5. DELETED.
10.1. Leave in Excess of 60 Days at Fiscal Year-end Balancing. Members lose leave over 60
days at the end of the FY unless eligible for up to 60 days of SLA. The purpose of SLA is to
prevent members from losing accrued leave if they are unable to take normal leave due to
significant and unforeseen operational mission requirements. Members are ineligible for special
leave accrual consideration if they returned from deployment and had the opportunity to use
leave but failed to do so. See paragraph 10.9 for other situations rendering members ineligible
for SLA consideration.
10.4. Automatic Carry-over. The DFAS center may automatically carry forward up to 60 days.
This occurs when members serve for at least 120 consecutive days in a hostile-fire or imminent-
danger pay area and receive this pay for at least 4 consecutive months. The DFAS center uses
inputs of a PCS arrival and departure or the start and stop of a hostile-fire or imminent-danger
pay entitlement for a TDY period of more than 120 days. The SLA upon departing the area of
responsibility (AOR) is the leave balance brought forward into the AOR plus leave accrued in
the AOR, minus leave used in the AOR. Members cannot carry over leave earned after departing
the AOR. They lose this leave at FY-end balancing unless used before 1 Oct.
12.2. Exception to Policy. Unit commanders may send requests for PTDY reasons not found in
Table 7 or paragraph 12.8 through command channels to HQ AFPC/DPFFOC, 550 C Street
West, Suite 37, Randolph, AFB TX 78150-4739. AFPC/DPFFOC will review, make a
recommendation and forward the request to HQ USAF/DP for final determination. HQ
USAF/DP is the decision authority for all requests involving a general officer. HQ USAF/DPP is
the decision authority for all others. Include an explanation of the circumstances for PTDY and
justification for favorable consideration. Submit request early enough to allow sufficient time for
processing. The MAJCOM submits recommendation and reasons for approval or disapproval.

20 OCTOBER 2005

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS

This change incorporates interim change (IC) 2005-2 (Attachment 6). Adds rule 50, Funeral
Services, to Table 7, allow Airmen to request permissive TDY to attend funeral services of an
immediate family member who is also on active duty, to actively participate in funeral services
of another military member (i.e., pallbearer, bugler, etc.), or to attend funeral services when the
deceased is a military member currently assigned or attached to the requestor's unit. Updates
Table 7, rule 3, Authorized PTDY, which allows Airmen assigned an indeterminate TDY to
request PTDY if they will not return to their permanent duty station and are relocating
dependents to secure off-base housing. See the last attachment of the publication, IC 2005-2, for
the complete IC. A bar (|) indicates revision from the previous edition.
