                               Chapter 1
                          GENERAL INFORMATION
                                     Overview

Introduction      Training from the back seat of an aircraft with a new student is
                  often a harrowing experience. Questions such as "When do I
                  take over control of the aircraft? Does the student know what he
                  or she is doing? What am I doing here?" are not new. All
                  instructor pilots have these feelings at one time or another. To
                  ensure that the ground training and flying training support each
                  other requires a systematic approach that standardizes each
                  training program. No one in the training business wants to lose
                  an aircraft or crewmember, or be unable to defeat the enemy.
                  Therefore, to assist you with this very important mission, this
                  handbook serves as a guide for applying Instructional System
                  Development (ISD) to the design, implementation, administration,
                  and management of aircrew training in the Air Force. It adheres
                  to the policies of AFPD 36-22 and follows the principles and
                  procedures of AFMAN 36-2234. The guide is intended to be
                  easy reading for novice and experienced managers, curriculum
                  developers, and instructors. While it is designed as a "stand-
                  alone" document, reading and being familiar with AFPD 36-22
                  and AFMAN 36-2234 will make developing training easier. As
                  the need arises for more information on specific areas of training
                  development, it is recommended that you read the other sources
                  of information referenced throughout this handbook.


Background        In the past, the Air Force ISD manual and handbook were
                  focused on applying ISD to technical training. There was little, if
                  any, guidance on how to apply ISD in the other training
                  communities such as aircrew and acquisition. The revised
                  AFMAN 36-2234 provides the necessary principles, procedures,
                  and guidance for applying ISD throughout the Air Force, with the
                  various volumes of AFH 36-2235 providing more detailed and
                  specific information for applying ISD in the various communities.
                  Also, other volumes of AFH 36-2235 have been developed to
                  cover such areas as selecting the appropriate computer-based
                  training, applying ISD to unit-level training, and a look at the latest
                  training technologies available to the aircrew trainer.

Purpose               This handbook provides specific information and guidance for
                      using the ISD process to develop aircrew training. It provides
                      information on the ISD model, planning ISD projects, phases of
                      development, system functions, and quality improvements.


Is this handbook      This handbook addresses the question: "How do you apply ISD to
for you?              aircrew training?" It is applicable to both Air Force and
                      contractor-developed training. But is it for you?

                      developing and delivering a training course?
                      A training specialist using ISD to develop
                      aircrew training?
                      A "novice" curriculum developer?

                      If you checked YES to any of these questions, this handbook will
                      help you do your job.


What is ISD?          ISD is a systematic, but flexible, process used to plan, design,
                      develop, and deliver an effective and efficient training system. It
                      is a total quality process, which continuously strives to improve
                      the system. ISD ensures that:

                         There is a training need.
                         There is a solution to the need.
                         The solution can be implemented.
                         The solution can be assessed to determine whether it meets
                         the need.
                         Quality improvements are made throughout the ISD process.

Basis for ISD       ISD is based on:

                       Basic research as to how people learn
                       Basic research as to how people communicate
                       The systems engineering process
                       The concepts of instructional technology


Why use ISD?        Using ISD helps ensure that training is both effective and
                    efficient. ISD requires that you:

                       Design training to meet specific job requirements that have
                       been identified through a training needs assessment.
                       Design training for all job elements that are critical to
                       successful performance.
                       Design training to meet specific training objectives.
                       Choose methods and media to optimize cost-effectiveness
                       and efficiency of training.
                       Evaluate training to make sure the objectives are being met.
                       Collect and use student data to improve training quality.


Goals of ISD        The goals of ISD are to:

                       Produce graduates who meet job performance requirements.
                       Produce a cost-effective, efficient training system.
                       Continually improve training quality.


How to use ISD      ISD is:
                       Flexible and systematic
                       A tool to get the right training to solve the problem
                       Not a lock-step, linear process

                    ISD is a cyclic process that begins with the analysis phase,
                    during development of the instructional system, and continues
                    through the implementation phase. Evaluation is an active,
                    integral part of each phase of the process and the source of

How to use ISD       continuous feedback and improvements for the life cycle of the
(Continued)          system. During initial system development, instructional system
                     developers may reenter phases of the process, as necessary, to
                     ensure effectiveness and cost-efficiency of the system. During
                     updates or revisions to a mature system, the developer enters the
                     phase of the process as determined by the nature and scope of
                     the update and reenters phases of the process if necessary.

             INSTRUCTIONAL SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT MODEL
                                          Overview

Introduction           Designing, developing, implementing, and supporting a training
                       system requires considerable time and effort on the part of
                       managers and instructional system developers. Developers must
                       design, develop, and implement effective and efficient training,
                       while managers must control, coordinate, and integrate the
                       training into a total training system using the principles of Quality
                       Improvement (QI). The total instructional system model includes
                       the ISD phases, the system functions, and the QI process.


Objectives             The objectives of this chapter are to:

                          Describe the phases of ISD.
                          Discuss the system functions.
                          Explain the QI process.


Updated Air Force      The updated ISD model has been designed to represent
ISD model              simplicity and flexibility so that instructional designers with varying
                       levels of expertise can understand the model and use it to
                       develop effective, efficient instructional systems. This model
                       depicts the flexibility that instructional designers have to enter or
                       reenter the various stages of the process as necessary. The
                       entry or reentry into a particular stage of the process is
                       determined by the nature and scope of the development, update
                       or revision activity.


System functions       An extension of the systems approach places the ISD process
                       within the functional design of a total instructional system.
                       Figure 1 shows the basic top-level system functions of the
                       instructional system: management, support, administration,
                       delivery, and evaluation.

Functions             The system functions of the ISD model are:

                         Management: The function of directing or controlling
                         instructional system development and operations.
                         Support: The function of maintaining all parts of the system.
                         Administration: The function of day-to-day processing and
                         record keeping.
                         Delivery: The function of bringing instruction to students.
                         Evaluation: The function of gathering feedback data through
                         formative, summative, and operational evaluations to assess
                         system and student performance.


Relation to ISD       Using these essential functions to design the overall instructional
                      system architecture and then allocating them to the respective
                      instructional system components, or people responsible, ensures
                      that these functions are operational when the total training
                      system is fielded. ISD products are integrated into the total
                      instructional system, and aspects of the instructional system
                      functions are active throughout all phases of the ISD process.
AFH 36-2235       Volume 8       1 November 2002                                         11



Relation to ISD      Figure 2 shows the phases most often used in the systems
(Continued)          approach, which are analysis, design, development, and
                     implementation, with the evaluation activities integrated into each
                     phase of the process. The phases are embedded within the
                     system functions. Evaluation is shown as the central feedback
                     "network" for the total system.

                     Figure 2 Functions with Phases




                     The instructional development process, which the model
                     summarizes, calls for instructional designers to:

                        Analyze and determine what instruction is needed.
                        Design instruction to meet the need.
                        Develop instructional materials to support system
                        requirements.
                        Implement the instructional system.

                     Evaluation is a central function that takes place at every phase.

                     Symbolically, Figure 2 shows that all phases of the model depend
                     on each of the other phases. The ISD process allows the
                     instructional designer or design team to enter or reenter the
                     various phases of the process as determined by the nature and
                     scope of the development or revision activity. The phases of the
                     updated model are described below.
AFH 36-2235      Volume 8       1 November 2002                                          12



Analysis phase      In courses that tie the content directly to preparing a student to do
                    a job, the instructional designer analyzes the job performance
                    requirements and develops a task list. The designer then
                    analyzes the job tasks and compares them with the skills,
                    knowledge, and abilities of the incoming students. The difference
                    between what they already know and can do and what the job
                    requires them to know and be able to do determines what
                    instruction is necessary. The activities of formative evaluation
                    begin.


Design phase        In the design phase, the instructional designer develops a
                    detailed plan of instruction, which includes selecting the
                    instructional methods and media, and determining the
                    instructional strategies. Existing instructional materials are
                    reviewed during this phase to determine their applicability to the
                    specific instruction under development. In this phase, the
                    instructional designers also develop the instructional objectives
                    and test and design the instruction. The implementation plan for
                    the instructional system is developed in this phase and a training
                    information management system is designed, if required.
                    Formative evaluation activities continue in this phase.


Development         In the development phase, both the student and instructor lesson
phase               materials are developed. If the media selected in the design
                    phase included items such as videotapes, sound/slides,
                    interactive courseware (ICW), and training devices, these are
                    developed. If a training information management system was
                    developed for the instructional system, it is installed in this phase.
                    As a final step in this phase, the implementation plan is updated.
                    During this phase, instructional designers also validate each
                    unit/module of instruction and its associated instructional
                    materials as they are developed. They correct any deficiencies
                    that may be identified. Validation includes:

                       Internal review of the instruction and materials for accuracy
                       Individual and small-group tryouts
                       Operational tryouts of the "whole" system

                    Revision of units/modules occurs as they are validated, based on
                    feedback from formative and summative evaluation activities.
                    The final step in this phase is to finalize all training materials.
AFH 36-2235      Volume 8       1 November 2002                                            13



Implementation      The instructional system has been designed and developed, and
phase               it is now time for the actual system to become operational. In this
                    phase, the instructional system is fielded under operational
                    conditions and the activities of operational evaluation provide
                    feedback from the field on the graduate's performance.


Evaluation          Evaluation is a continuous process beginning during the analysis
                    phase and continuing throughout the life cycle of the instructional
                    system. Evaluation consists of:

                       Formative Evaluation, consisting of process and product
                       evaluations conducted during the analysis and design phases,
                       and validation, which is conducted during the development
                       phase. Included are individual and small group tryouts.

                       Summative Evaluation, consisting of operational tryouts and
                       conducted as the last step of validation in the development
                       phase.

                       Operational Evaluation, consisting of periodic internal and
                       external evaluation of the operational system during the
                       implementation phase.

                    Each form of evaluation should be used during development,
                    update, and revision of instruction, if possible, and if the form of
                    evaluation is application.

Quality          Figure 3 depicts the completed ISD model. This completed figure
improvement      shows the system functions and ISD phases embedded within
                 the quality improvement (QI) process.

                 Figure 3 Updated AF ISD Model




                 The QI process, which is further discussed in this chapter, is
                 briefly described below.

                 Quality improvement is the continuous, organized creation of
                 beneficial change to the system. The objective of quality
                 improvement is to foster continuous improvement in the process
                 and products of ISD. It is an independent evaluation to determine
                 whether the products are meeting the users' needs. The
                 objective of quality improvement is to ensure on-time
                 development of high-quality courseware that enables students to
                 reach the desired performance levels in an effective and cost-
                 efficient manner.

                 The updated model graphically illustrates that:

                    Evaluation is the "centerpiece" to the ISD process.
                    ISD is a continuous process with the flexibility to enter and
                    reenter the various phases, as necessary, to develop, update,
                    or revise instruction.

Quality               All ISD activities take place within and are dependent on the
improvement           system functions.
(Continued)           Teamwork is required between personnel performing system
                      functions and those designing, developing, and implementing
                      instructional systems.
                      All ISD activities and system functions focus on continuous
                      quality improvements in the system.

                                     Section A
                                     Analysis

What is it?         During analysis, you:

                       Collect information on missions/jobs/duties/tasks.
                       Analyze the information.
                       Determine job performance requirements.


Why do it?          You conduct analysis to identify the training needs so training
                    can be developed to meet those needs.


Where to read       Details on the analysis phase of ISD are available in Chapters 3
about it            and 4. Specific topics are listed below.

                    Update Training Development Plan                            85


When you do it      Conduct an analysis before you begin to design new or revise
                    existing training.


What you get        If you have conducted the analysis correctly, you will get valid
                    training requirements and accurate predictions of the resource
                    requirements.
AFH 36-2235     Volume 8      1 November 2002                 17



What you need      To conduct analysis, you need to assess:

                      Equipment
                      Subject matter experts (SMEs)
                      Weapon system data
                      Existing course materials
                      Technical data
                      Occupational Survey Report (OSR) data
                      Engineering data
                      Similar system or programs
                      Training standards

                                      Section B
                                       Design

What is it?         Training design is like architectural design. You figure out what
                    you want the training to look like and how you want it to work.
                    The analysis that you previously conducted will help determine
                    the design of the training in this phase.


Why do it?          The purpose of design is to be sure that the product teaches. If a
                    product does not teach it has no value. Supposedly a designer
                    knows what is effective in promoting learning for different kinds of
                    outcomes. The designer then builds into the instruction those
                    conditions that are necessary for effective and efficient learning to
                    occur. If these conditions are not built into the materials then
                    there is strong likelihood that the materials will not teach.

                    The additional benefits of design are to save money, increase
                    product quality, and get the training done on time. You don't
                    just go out and start developing instruction, just as you don't
                    start building a training facility without planning and designing it
                    first.

What you get       Proper design will result in:

                      Training objectives
                      Tests that measure the objectives
                      Training methods, media, and strategies to deliver the training
                      Training information management systems


What you need      For ISD design, you need all the products developed during initial
                   project planning and the analysis phase.

                                  Development

What is it?         During this phase, training is developed including all training
                    materials. After the training has been developed, follow-on
                    evaluation (validation) phase ensures that each component is
                    contributing to the overall effectiveness and efficiency of the
                    training system.


Why do it?          Development is the production of the materials. Without
                    development there is no instruction except perhaps in the case of
                    extemporaneous, live instructions. Technology production
                    (development) has become a highly specialized area with
                    different people needed for different aspects of the production
                    (artists, technical writers, computer programmers, web site
                    designers, etc.)

                    The purpose of development is to have a valid product ready for
                    implementation.

What is it?         Evaluation measures the quality, effectiveness, and efficiency of
                    the training system. Evaluation answers the questions:

                       Is the process effective and cost-efficient?
                       Are quality products being developed?
                       How well are the course graduates performing on the job?
                       How can the system be improved?


Why do it?          Evaluation improves the quality of the ISD process and products
                    while producing graduates who can meet job performance
                    requirements.

                               Quality Improvement

Introduction          ISD is a cyclic, systematic process that continually evaluates the
                      instructional system throughout its life cycle. The Air Force uses
                      the ISD process as a tool to ensure that instructional systems
                      deliver quality instruction to Air Force personnel in the most
                      effective and efficient manner possible. The ISD process
                      implements the principles of the Quality Air Force (QAF) program.


What is it?           Quality improvement (QI) is the continuous, organized creation
                      of beneficial change to the system. It is an independent
                      evaluation to determine whether the instructional products are
                      meeting the students' needs.


Objectives of QI      The objective of quality improvement is to foster continuous
                      improvement in the products and processes.


Results               Quality instructional product development results in:

                         Increased student satisfaction
                         Products that are easy to use and maintain
                         An increase in the students' ability to perform on the job

                      Quality instructional design results in:

                         Fewer errors
                         Less rework (and waste)
                         Higher success training
                         Less time spent in development of new training products
                         Lower life cycle costs


ISD and quality       The principles of quality are implemented in the ISD process,
relationship          resulting in total quality in the education and training environment
                      by continuously evaluating the processes and products. The
                      relationship between the key concepts of QI can be easily seen in
                      the ISD process.
AFH 36-2235    Volume 8       1 November 2002                                      27



ISD examples      ISD examples are:

                  Customers:
                    Know your customers. The information gained in the
                    mission/job analysis process gives the instructional design
                    team information that defines the customer's expectations.

                     Focus on customers. As mentioned earlier, the needs of the
                     work center drives the instructional needs. By continuing to
                     trace the relationship between the job requirements and all
                     aspects of the instructional program, you maintain a continual
                     focus on the actual field requirements. In addition, ISD also
                     requires that the capabilities, aptitudes and attitudes of the
                     student target population be considered during the design
                     process.

                  Team Players:
                     Foster teamwork. A training program cannot be designed
                     and developed in a vacuum. In order to develop effective
                     training, the design team must include representatives from
                     the work center and evaluation offices. This helps ensure that
                     the training matches the performance requirements of the job.

                     Empower your people. ISD is a problem solving, decision-
                     making model. The flexibility of the process, combined with
                     the fact that there are any number of ways to solve a given
                     training problem, requires that design teams be allowed
                     freedom and authority to design, develop, and implement
                     training that meets job performance requirements.

                  Final Product:
                     Know your mission. ISD depends on mission and job
                     analysis for basic data. All instruction must be based directly
                     on mission or job requirements. The checks in the process
                     help eliminate instruction not related to the job.

                     Job analysis uses data from many sources, including mission
                     statements found in regulations or locally developed
                     statements. Analysts also make use of management
                     engineering reports, occupational survey data, and direct
                     observation to determine the actual job requirements.


ISD examples         As part of the job analysis process, a training needs
(Continued)          assessment is conducted to arrive at the actual performance
AFH 36-2235   Volume 8      1 November 2002                                         28


                    problem. In some cases, a problem is not related to lack of
                    training, but to a problem with the job structure or
                    environment. The ISD process helps ensure that you don't
                    build a training program for a non-training problem.

                    Set goals and standards. Goals and standards for an
                    instructional development effort come in many variations.
                    First, the job requirements and the impact of the performance
                    deficiency determine the timing required for the development
                    process and the conduct of the instructional program.
                    Second, the content of the training is determined by the job
                    performance requirements. The design team should directly
                    translate the cues, conditions, and performance standards of
                    the job directly into the instructional program.

                    Manage by fact. Each phase of the ISD process requires
                    constant evaluation against the job requirements identified
                    earlier in the process. In addition, a variety of tools have been
                    developed to help ensure that design and development
                    decisions are made with supporting data. For example, a
                    number of media selection tools are being used that provide
                    managers with information that matches training media with
                    the training requirements. These matches are based on
                    learning theories and development cost factors (money and
                    time). ISD is designed to guide managers and developers to
                    awareness of factors affecting their decisions.

                    Integrate quality in all phases. Evaluation is continuous
                    quality checking. This is true during each phase of the ISD
                    process, from analysis to implementation. Built-in checks in
                    each phase ensure the quality of the ISD process and
                    products. The emphasis is on satisfying the job performance
                    requirements and producing graduates who can do their jobs.

                    Evaluate quality constantly. The ISD process is a cyclical,
                    ongoing process of continuous improvements. As curriculum
                    developers progress through the different phases of ISD, the
                    process and products of each phase are constantly evaluated
                    against the job requirements and principles of learning. The
AFH 36-2235    Volume 8      1 November 2002                                         29



ISD examples      results of the evaluations determine which phase of ISD to enter
(Continued)       next. Constant evaluation identifies changes in job requirements
                  due to updates in equipment and personnel, which results in new
                  ISD efforts to provide the best possible training to Air Force
                  personnel.

                     to do the job. The design team must directly translate the

                     Evaluate quality constantly. The ISD process is a cyclic,
                     ongoing process. As curriculum developers progress through
                     the different phases of ISD, the process and products of each
                     phase are constantly evaluated against the instructional
                     requirements and principles of learning. Results of the
AFH 36-2235        Volume 8       1 November 2002                                           30

Basis of process      The basis of process improvement is Quality Air Force (QAF).
improvement           QAF is a management philosophy and a methodology that work
                      together to produce continuous process improvements. It is
                      based on ten principles:

                         All work is a process.

                         Processes receive work from suppliers, add value and deliver
                         output to customers.

                         Anyone from whom a process receives work is a supplier.

                         Anyone to whom a process delivers output is a customer.

                         Customers have needs and expectations.

                         Customers will define and measure quality in terms of those
                         needs and expectations.

                         Quality is meeting customer needs and expectations.

                         Improving process quality increases productivity.

                         Processes can be identified, understood, measured, and
                         improved.

                         The people who operate the processes know best how to
                         improve them.

Procedure for       In order to ensure process improvements, you will need to use a
process             systematic method to identify and correct the causes of the
improvement         problems. The six steps of process improvement are outlined in
                    the next table.

                       Step         Activity
                           1     Define the process and determine the main problem
                                 areas.
                           2     Analyze the problems and identify the causes of
                                 each.
                           3     Identify and evaluate possible changes to the
                                 process.
                           4     Implement the changes and monitor the process.
                           5     Institutionalize the changes.
                           6     Repeat for continuous improvements.


Ways to implement   There are many different ways to implement the basic procedure
the procedure       mentioned above. Two of the ways are:

                       "Chart It, Check It, Change It"
                       Shewhart Cycle (plan-do-check-act)

                    Each of these techniques uses the six basic steps mentioned
                    above.

                               "Chart It, Check It, Change It"

What it is         This technique is a systematic approach to continuous
                   improvement. This approach has three principal steps, as shown
                   below and in Figure 4.

                                                  Evaluate the process.
                                                  Identify opportunities.
                           3         Change It    Improve the process.
                                                  Institutionalize the change.

                     the problems and
                     opportunities.
                     Evaluate the process to                           CHECK IT
                     identify alternative
                     approaches.
                     Identify opportunities (i.e.,
                     useful changes) from the
                     alternatives.

                   Change It                                          CHANGE IT
                     Improve the process by
                     implementing changes
                     identified as opportunities.

                      Institutionalize the changes through training, standardization,
                      etc. Then, use another process (or use this same one again)
                      to make further improvements.

How to use it         To use the Shewhart Cycle, follow the steps listed below.

                         Plan an approach for quality improvement. Study the
                         process flow and any existing data. Formulate possible
                         improvements, experiments to be run, or additional data to be
                         gathered.

                         Do the activity planned. Implement the improvement effort
                         that you planned. Train the people who are responsible for
                         implementation.

                         Check the results. Measure the results of the improvement
                         effort you implemented. Analyze the data you collected.

                         Act on the results. If the effort was truly an improvement,
                         standardize and document it. If it wasn't successful,
                         determine what could be done to improve it.

                         Repeat. Continue around the cycle again by planning and
                         carrying out further activity.


Flowchart:            Many tools are used to make process improvements. One tool
A process             that is often used to analyze process problems is the flowchart.

What it is           A flowchart is a graphical representation of all the major steps of
                     a process. It can help you:

                        Understand the complete process.
                        Identify the critical stages of the process.
                        Locate problem areas.
                        Show relationships between different steps in a process.


How to use it        Points on how to use it:

                        Identify the process. Define the start point and finish point
                        for the process to be examined.

                        Chart the ideal process. Try to identify the easiest and most
                        efficient way to go from the start block to the finish block.
                        While this step isn't absolutely necessary, it does make it
                        easier to find improvements.

                        Describe the current process. Chart the whole process
                        (i.e., lay out all the steps) from beginning to end. You can use
                        standard symbols to improve the clarity of your flowchart.

                        Search for improvement opportunities. Identify all areas
                        that hinder your process or add little or no value. Examine all
                        areas that differ from your ideal process and question why
                        they exist.

                        Update your chart. Build a new flowchart that corrects the
                        problems you identified in the previous step.

                     encouraged to use a process improvement tool such as
                     flowcharting any time you are involved in developing a new
                     process or revising an existing process. Also, if you haven't
                     documented your current training development process, it is
                     recommended that you do so in order to improve the process.

Metrics              Metrics are standards of measurement or quality indicators that
                     are critical to maintaining quality in the training development
                     process. The purpose of metrics is to provide qualitative and
                     quantitative evaluations of the process and products within each
                     phase of ISD. Metrics are based on key factors such as
                     performance, cost, and schedule. Types of metrics include, but
                     are not limited to, items such as:

                                     Overview

Introduction       Planning is a key element in the overall management of a training
                   system as well as the ISD process itself. Proper planning has the
                   same basic system functions of management, support,
                   administration, and delivery. As a curriculum developer, you may
                   not be involved in the overall planning for the training system;
                   however, you still play a vital role in analyzing the training needs
                   and providing information to the planners as well as identifying
                   situations where inadequate planning has occurred. You also
                   play a more active role in planning for the design and
                   development processes.

                                Section A
                          Analyze Training Needs

Introduction      The planning phase of training development normally begins with
                  a needs analysis to make sure that the stated problem or
                  identified deficiency can be solved with training. Training will
                  solve only certain types of performance deficiencies. They are
                  the performer's lack of ability to recall information and lack of
                  knowledge, skill and ability to perform a task and the attitude or
                  willingness to perform. If the identified performance deficiency
                  does not fall into one of these areas, training cannot solve it, and
                  thus there is no need to proceed further with the training
                  development effort.


Purpose           Although often confused, there is a distinct difference been a
                  "needs assessment" and a "training needs assessment." For this
                  reason, the purpose of each is given.

                     Needs Assessment – The process of analyzing a problem or
                     deficiency in order to determine if the solution is training or
                     non-training related.

                     Training Needs Assessment (TNA) – The process of
                     identifying the deficiency or "gap" between current
                     performance and desired performance as part of the analysis
                     phase. This gap equates to or identifies the training need.


Who is            Curriculum developers are responsible for conducting the needs
responsible?      assessment, as well as the training needs assessment, if
                  necessary.


When do you       Needs or training needs analysis should be one of the first tasks
conduct TNA?      accomplished in the analysis phase. It is important to do the
                  assessment first, since the problem or deficiency may not have a
                  training solution, which means that proceeding with training
                  development would be inappropriate.
AFH 36-2235     Volume 8        1 November 2002                                         46



Receiving the       The request to do a needs assessment usually comes from a
tasking             higher headquarters in the form of a tasking letter, message, or
                    memo. Also, a needs assessment can be initiated by the
                    curriculum developer as a result of analyzing critiques of an
                    existing course.


Possible            Several possible causes of performance problems are:
causes of
problems               Personnel were never trained.
                       Personnel did not receive follow-up training after the initial
                       training.
                       Correct training was not provided during the initial training.
                       Personnel are not allowed to perform their jobs correctly.
                       Personnel disregard the rules.


Identifying         The requirement to do a needs or training needs analysis can
a need              come from many different sources. Most needs are identified
                    because individuals are not meeting job performance
                    requirements. This situation is often caused when job
                    requirements change as a result of new equipment or job tasks.
                    Several sources for identifying training needs are:

                       Job evaluations
                       Course critiques
                       Field inputs
                       Accident board findings


How to do a needs   The needs assessment process is accomplished in several
assessment          stages. The number of stages will vary, depending on the
                    assessment being done. However, for explanation purposes, six
                    stages will be used to describe the process.

                    Stage 1 – Define the purpose of the assessment. Identify
                    information such as who is involved, what the problem is, or who
                    wants the problem solved.

                    Stage 2 – Identify the data sources to be used in the
                    assessment, such as evaluation reports, critiques, and subject
                    matter experts (SMEs).
AFH 36-2235     Volume 8       1 November 2002                                       47



How to do a needs   Stage 3 – Select data gathering instruments such as
assessment          questionnaires, interviews, or direct observations.

                    Stage 4 – Collect data by sending out questionnaires, or
                    conducting interviews.

                    Stage 5 – Analyze the data by comparing the present
                    performance against the desired performance. Also, confirm the
                    accuracy and quality of the data gathered.

                    Stage 6 – Document findings and recommend solutions.
                    Document the problems, identify the causes, explain the gap or
                    deficiency between the present and desired performance, and
                    recommend a solution.


Non-training        If the curriculum developer determines that the deficiency in job
solution            performance is not training-related, such as equipment
                    obsolescence, a non-training solution should be pursued. Once a
                    solution has been found, it should be sent back to the
                    organization requesting the needs analysis.
AFH 36-2235         Volume 8        1 November 2002                                            48



                               Section B
          Determine Personnel Requirements and Responsibilities

Introduction           Once it has been determined that training is needed, determining
                       personnel requirements and responsibilities becomes a key factor
                       in getting ready to apply the ISD process to aircrew training
                       development. In this process you will identify information such as
                       the types of people you need to develop the training, the skills
                       they should have, the number of people you need, when you
                       need them, and their responsibilities. As you can see, there are
                       several factors to be considered when determining personnel
                       requirements and responsibilities.


Purpose                The purpose of determining personnel requirements and
                       responsibilities is to ensure that the personnel required to design,
                       develop, implement, and maintain the training system are
                       identified and their responsibilities are defined.


Who is                 Curriculum developers and their supervisors are normally
responsible?           responsible for identifying personnel requirements for the training
                       system. During this process, the responsibilities of the individuals
                       are also identified.


When do you            Determining training system personnel requirements and their
determine              responsibilities is one of the first stages, if not the first, in initial
requirements and       ISD project planning. This task should be done as early as
responsibilities?      possible to ensure that the right people, with the right skills, in the
                       right numbers, are available at the right time to develop the
                       training.


What is required?      In order to determine personnel requirements and
                       responsibilities, several tasks must be performed:

                          Determine the scope and level of the project.
                          Identify the need for personnel such as the SME.
                          Define the role of the personnel required.

                       Each of these tasks will be discussed further.
AFH 36-2235       Volume 8         1 November 2002                                         49



Scope and level of     The scope and level of the ISD project will determine the
the project            personnel requirements. For example:

                          Developing initial and continuation training courses for a new
                          defense system will normally require more personnel than
                          revising training in an existing course.

                          Developing a course using interactive courseware (ICW) will
                          require more personnel, using different skills, than are
                          required for print-based materials.

                          Levels of complexity within ICW will impact personnel
                          requirements since the more complex the material, the more
                          time it takes to design and develop.

                          Using a multimedia approach in a course(s) will impact the
                          type, number, and skills of personnel needed to develop the
                          training. In one case you may need computer programmers
                          while in another case you may need graphic artists, sound
                          engineers, and photographers.

                       Early in the planning stage, you may not be able to define the
                       exact scope and level of the ISD project. However, as you enter
                       the actual analysis and design phases of training development,
                       the scope and level of training will be clearly defined, allowing
                       personnel requirements to be determined.

                                  Define the scope and level of the ISD
                                project early in the initial planning stages.

Identifying need for   Once the scope and level of the ISD project have been
SMEs                   adequately defined, you may need content specialists to provide
                       the technical expertise (pilots, weapon system officers).
                       Sometimes these SMEs are not available and someone from the
                       weapon system or similar system will require training to perform
                       as the SME.

                       When identifying personnel requirements, you should:

                          Identify the specialties that are needed for the project.
                          Indicate the number of each specialty required.
AFH 36-2235       Volume 8         1 November 2002                                         50



Identifying need for      List any special skills the specialist may need.
SMEs (Continued)          Estimate when specific specialists will be needed and for how
                          long.
                          Identify how they will retain currency, if necessary.

                       Identification of specialists should be completed as soon as
                       possible to ensure that the specialists needed on the project have
                       sufficient time to schedule their work on the project. In cases
                       where a specialist may need to be permanently assigned to the
                       project, early identification of personnel is essential. This allows
                       sufficient time for the assignment process to work, which can take
                       several months in some cases.


Define roles           Once you have established the need for an SME, you should
                       clearly define that person's role in the project. Clearly defined
                       roles will:

                          Enable the elements of the project to be more accurately
                          defined, such as project definition, tasks, milestones.
                          Allow specialists to know their role as members of the project
                          development team.
                          Allow work to be scheduled with minimum conflict.
                          Allow specialists to be selected who have the needed skills.

                       You may not be able to totally define the role of each specialist in
                       the project until the training system design has been established.

                                  Section C
               Determine Training Needed to Meet Requirements

Introduction           At this point in the process of getting ready to apply ISD to
                       develop aircrew training, the training needed to meet the
                       requirements should be determined. It is important to identify the
                       necessary training as early as possible in the planning stages so
                       that adequate preparations can be made to design and develop
                       training that will meet system requirements.


Purpose                The purpose for determining the training needed to meet system
                       requirements is to identify types of training, such as performance
                       or complex performance. Identification of needed training will
                       enable the instructional developer to more accurately design an
                       instructional system based on the effect the type of training will
                       have on training system components such as equipment,
                       facilities, time, media, methods, aircraft, ranges and ordnance.


Who is                 Curriculum developers are responsible for determining the
responsible?           training that is needed to meet requirements of the training
                       system.


When should it be      Determining the needed training to meet requirements should be
done?                  done during the initial planning stages of the ISD project. The
                       training needed should be determined prior to making preliminary
                       decisions such as methods, media, and training alternatives.
                       Refer to AFH36-2235, Volume 3, for the schedule of planning
                       activities.


How should it be       During initial ISD project planning, you will not be able to
done?                  determine all of the training needed to meet the system
                       requirements. As the training system design begins to take
                       shape you will be better able to identify the types of training
                       required. However, you may not have the luxury of time due to
                       weapon system bed-downs. When this occurs, there are several
                       ways to initially identify the training that may be needed.
AFH 36-2235     Volume 8      1 November 2002                                        52



How should it be      Compare the training system you intend to design with a
done? (Continued)     similar system that already exists. This will help identify the
                      types and levels of training that may be required. Be sure to
                      include lessons learned by the similar training system.
                      Review existing information and technical data to determine
                      what types of training may be required for the system.
                      Check Air Force directives to determine if they require specific
                      training to specified levels to meet established requirements.
                      Use your experience and the experience of SMEs to identify

                    Determine Training System Requirements

Introduction           Prior to applying the ISD process to develop aircrew training,
                       some initial planning will need to be done to set the stage for the
                       development project. Part of the initial planning is to determine
                       the requirements of the training system. Since the requirements
                       identified at this point are preliminary, they may need to be
                       revised during the actual training development process.
                       Additional information on determining training system
                       requirements, system training plans (STP) and training planning
                       teams (TPT) is found in AFH 36-2235, Volume 3.


Purpose                The purpose of identifying the training system is to establish the
                       "framework" for building the training system.


Who is                 Determining the training system requirements is the responsibility
responsible?           of the training planning team (TPT).


When should it be      Determining the training system requirements should be done
done?                  during the initial planning and preparation of the ISD project. You
                       should have an idea of the system requirements before starting
                       the analysis of ISD.


What should be         Determining training system requirements includes:
determined?
                          Assessing technology and methodology. This includes
                          looking at the technology that is available and the new
                          methodology or procedures that have been developed in order
                          to determine how they might be used to meet training system
                          requirements.
                          Making preliminary methods and media selection. The
                          preliminary selection of methods and media is a "best guess"
                          which allows further planning and design activities to proceed,
                          such as determining training alternatives.
                          Examining training alternatives. This includes looking at the
                          anticipated training system and selecting alternative ways to
                          provide training in the event the primary training delivery
                          system is rendered ineffective. Determining training
                          alternatives is further explored in the next topic.
AFH 36-2235       Volume 8       1 November 2002                                             54



                             Select Training Alternatives

Introduction         During planning for the ISD project, curriculum developers initially
                     examined possible training alternatives and in the analysis phase
                     the need for alternative training strategies was determined. At
                     this point, the training alternatives are selected, if applicable.


Purpose              The purpose of selecting a training alternative is to have an
                     alternative method of providing training in case the primary
                     delivery system is not available for training. For example, if the
                     primary delivery for a particular lesson is the flight simulator, and
                     it is not available, an alternative way of providing the training may
                     be the actual aircraft or a part-task trainer.


Who is               Curriculum developers and SMEs are responsible for selecting
responsible?         alternative methods and media for providing training in their
                     courses. Management within the training organization has the
                     responsibility for ensuring that the training alternative selected is
                     acceptable and meets the training goals of the organization.


When should          Training alternatives should be selected after the objectives and
alternatives be      tests have been developed and you know what it is you are going
selected?            to teach. Ideally, this activity is accomplished at the same time
                     the methods and media are selected, since they may help you
                     select training alternatives.


What should          When selecting training alternatives, consider:

                            Develop ISD Evaluation Plan

Introduction        ISD is a total quality process, which ensures that the training
                    development process is both effective and efficient and that
                    quality products are produced in each phase of ISD, with special
                    emphasis on the final training system product–the graduate. The
                    system must produce quality graduates who have the necessary
                    skills, knowledge, and attitudes to perform in an operational
                    environment. To ensure quality, evaluation must begin in the
                    planning stages and continue throughout the life cycle of the
                    training system. Updating the plan ensures that the most current
                    and accurate information is used when evaluating the process
                    and products of the training.


Purpose of the      The purpose of the ISD evaluation plan is to provide an
plan                organized, structured plan for evaluating the ISD process and
                    products to ensure that a quality training system is designed,
                    developed, and implemented.


Who is              Curriculum developers or their supervisors are responsible for
responsible?        developing the ISD evaluation plan for the training system.
                    However, everyone in the training organization is responsible for
                    quality.


When is a plan      An ISD evaluation plan should be developed for each new
needed?             training system developed and for any existing system that is
                    revised significantly enough to warrant a new evaluation plan.
                    This does not mean you cannot use an existing plan if it fits.

Format of the plan    The format of evaluation plans will be determined by the training
                      organization developing the training. The content of the plan is
                      flexible and will depend to a great degree on the complexity of the
                      training project being developed and the strategy used to
                      evaluate the system. In all cases, the plan should contain no
                      more or less information than necessary to document the plan for
                      evaluation. The plan should cover:

                         Formative evaluation
                         Summative evaluation
                         Operational evaluation

                      The training organization can develop a separate evaluation plan
                      for each phase of the evaluation process. The evaluation plan(s)
                      can be included as part of the training development plan.

Updating the          To be an effective tool for managing the QI process, the
evaluation plan       evaluation plan must be continually updated with current and
                      accurate information. The plan should be updated at the end of
                      each phase of the ISD process or when significant changes
                      warrant a revision to the plan. Information that may require
                      updating in the evaluation plan includes items such as:

                        Write Training Development Plan

Introduction          One of the keys to developing an effective and efficient training
                      system is to have a good training development plan. In some
                      training communities, the training development plan is also called
                      an ISD management plan. The plan should be broad in scope
                      and should focus on the various development activities of the
                      organizations involved in the development effort.


Purpose               The purpose of the training development plan is to provide
                      planning information and define the responsibilities for developing
                      the training system.


Who is                Writing the training development plan is the responsibility of the
responsible?          curriculum developer. However, the need to develop a plan is
                      determined by management.


When is a plan        A training development plan is not required for each training
needed?               development project. The scope and complexity of the project will
                      determine the need for a development plan. Management should
                      consider these two factors before making the decision to write a
                      plan. For example, an item that would influence the need for a
                      plan would be more than one site conducting the same training.


Format of the plan    The format of the plan is determined by the organization
                      responsible for writing the plan. Its content and detail are
                      determined by the scope of the ISD project. However, the format
                      should be flexible to ensure that it meets the needs of each
                      training development program and that it contains no more or less
                      information than necessary to develop an effective and efficient
                      training system.

               Design Training Information Management System

Introduction         Management of training information is essential for effective and
                     cost-efficient training systems. It includes updating records,
                     scheduling students, tracking equipment and meeting budgets.
                     Automated training information management systems enhance
                     the training organization's ability to perform this essential task.


Purpose              The purpose of automated training information management
                     systems is to increase the effectiveness and cost-efficiency of the
                     training system while managing the system in real time. It can
                     also provide instructors with the latest training/data materials
                     available. For example, automated systems can be used by:

                        Instructors to update student status
                        Registrar to track student status
                        Schedulers to schedule students and equipment
                        Curriculum developers to update training materials
                        Managers to manage resources
                        Students to tell where they are in the program


Who is               Training information management system design normally falls on
responsible?         a project manager assigned the responsibility to oversee the
                     procurement of the system. However, training organization
                     management and curriculum developers carry the responsibility
                     for ensuring that the training information is managed effectively
                     and cost-efficiently for their training. In most cases, managers will
                     not have an option as to whether an automated information
                     management system is designed for use or not. This decision is
                     normally based on availability of a management system. If a
                     system does exist, it will likely be used by all involved in the
                     training organization.

Design              As a curriculum developer, you may have the opportunity to help
considerations      design or redesign a training information management system.
                    When you provide your input to project management, some of the
                    issues to be considered are:

                       What is the cost?
                       What are the hardware capabilities?
                       Are there any special environmental requirements for the
                       hardware?
                       What are the software capabilities?
                       Is the system documentation adequate?
                       Who are the system users?
                       Are the hardware and software user-friendly?
                       Does this system have proven reliability?
                       Is the system maintainable?
                       Will the system interconnect/interface to existing systems?
                       Is the system software compatible with other software?
                       Does the hardware have expansion capability?
                       Can the software be upgraded or modified easily?
                       What training information will the system be able to manage?
                       What data is required for individuals to do their jobs?
                       What are the sources of data and are they current?
                       What data do all multiple users require?
                       What data is unique to specific users?
                       What are the required data formats?
                       What system security is required?


Off-the-shelf       There are commercial "off-the-shelf" software (cots) programs
systems             that can be purchased that will accomplish many, if not all, of your
                    training information management requirements. Purchase of
                    these programs eliminates the need to design and develop an
                    entire, single database system to manage the training information,
                    thus saving considerable time and effort.

                                         Overview

Introduction          Once initial ISD project planning has been done and adequate
                      preparations have been made, it is time to enter the analysis
                      phase of ISD. The nature and scope of each ISD project will be
                      determined by the assessed training deficiency or training
                      requirement. The assessed training need or requirement will also
                      determine the level of analysis that will be required for the project.

                               Section A
                          Conduct Task Analysis

Introduction      The first stage of the analysis process is conducting task
                  analysis. Since every job in the Air Force is made up of duties
                  and each duty is made up of tasks, curriculum developers need
                  to be experts in task analysis. Failure to do a good task analysis
                  could result in ineffective training. A thorough task analysis will
                  identify the tasks that need to be trained, under what conditions
                  they should be taught, and the standard of performance that must
                  be achieved.


What is task      In order to understand task analysis, a definition of a task is given
analysis?         first.

                  A task is an observable and measurable unit of work activity or
                  operation, which forms a significant part of a job. It constitutes a
                  logical and necessary step in performance, and has a logical
                  beginning and end. It may also be defined as a series of actions
                  leading to a terminal outcome, such as "starting engines on an F-
                  15" or "performing an aborted take-off."

                  Now that a task has been defined, what is task analysis?

                  Task analysis is the process of breaking a task down to identify
                  the:

                     Component steps of a task
                     Sequence of those steps
                     Conditions under which the task will be performed such as
                     using the simulator, part-task trainer, or materials required to
                     perform the task
                     Standard of performance that must be achieved


Purpose           During task analysis, each task is examined to determine
                  performance requirements, such as which tasks must be
                  performed, the conditions under which they are performed, and
                  the performance standard that must be achieved. From this
                  information evolves the task statement/list which is used to
                  develop the course objectives.

Data collection      The first stage of task analysis is collecting the data for analysis.
                     Several sources of data can be used in the task analysis process.
                     Some of the sources are shown following.

                        Data Sources
                        Checklist
                        AF Directives, Manuals, Handbooks
                        Standard Operating Procedures
                        MAJCOMs (user)
                        System Program Office (SPO)
                        Manufacturer's Manuals
                        Contractor's Data
                        SME


Data collection      Numerous techniques can be used to collect data for task
techniques           analysis. Examples of some of the most common techniques are
                     shown below.

                        Data Collection Techniques
                        Review of job-related documents such as flight manuals,
                        checklists
                        Observation of actual job performance
                        Interviews with SMEs
                        Written questionnaire/survey
                        Simulations of actual performance
                        Analysis of similar systems


Ask the right        When collecting data, focus on getting the necessary information
question             for task analysis. This can be done by asking the right questions
                     as you collect the data. Examples are given below.

Identifying        Identifying the tasks that need to be trained for is a critical part of
tasks              task analysis. When identifying tasks, you should:

                      Use all of the available data sources.
                      Assume that not all tasks may have been identified in the
                      initial task analysis.


Task criteria      Understanding task criteria will help identify tasks during task
                   analysis.

                      Task Criteria
                      A task is a group of related manual activities directed toward a
                      goal.
                      A task has a definite beginning and end.
                      A task involves people interacting with equipment and media.
                      A task is observable.
                      A task is measurable.
                      A task is an independent part of a duty.
                      A task results in a meaningful product.
                      A task includes a mixture of decisions, perceptions, and/or
                      physical activities required of an individual.
                      A task may be any size or degree of complexity.
AFH 36-2235      Volume 8        1 November 2002                                            69



Guidelines           Identifying tasks is a repeating process based on human activities
for task             that meet the above criteria. Each time it is repeated, the results
statements           of the process are made more complete and accurate.
                     Continually repeating the process refines the task, which is
                     continued until every task that makes up the duty is covered.

                     As the job tasks are identified, they are included in the listing in
                     the form of a task statement. To ensure that quality task
                     statements are developed, several guidelines and standards are
                     provided.

                        Step            Description
                         1          Arrange major duty responsibilities in order of
                                    typical performance.

                                    Indicate which tasks are performed in a fixed order
                                    and which ones have no particular order.
                            2       Translate duty responsibilities (or human functions)
                                    into a list of task statements, composed of an
                                    action verb and an object.
                            3       Edit the list according to the standards provided
                                    below.


Standards for task   Use the following standards when developing task statements.
statements
                     Clarity
                        Use wording that is easily understood.
                        Be precise so it means the same thing to each individual.
                        Write separate, specific statements for each task. Avoid com-
                        bining vague items of skill, knowledge, or responsibility.

                     Completeness
                       Use abbreviations only after spelling out the term.
                       To complete a form, include both form and title number,
                       unless all that is needed is the general type form.
AFH 36-2235      Volume 8        1 November 2002                                         70



Standards for task   Conciseness
statements             Be brief.
(Continued)            Begin with a present-tense action word (subject "I" or "you" is
                       understood).
                       Indicate an object of the action to be performed.
                       When there are several different techniques or methods of
                       doing a task, adding condition phrases to the task statement
                       may be necessary.
                       Use terminology that is currently used on the job, such as
                       "Perform an ASLAR departure."

                     Relevance
                        Do not state a person's qualifications.
                        Do not include items on receiving instruction, unless actual
                        work is performed. The exception is commands from lead
                        A/C, radio calls, or others.

Identifying          After the tasks have been identified, it is time to identify the
subtasks             subtasks. Subtasks are work activities that, when combined,
                     make up a task. It should be noted that not all tasks are made up
                     of subtasks. There are several reasons for identifying subtasks:
AFH 36-2235       Volume 8       1 November 2002                                      71



Identifying             For some task statements to be useful in training
subtasks                development, the curriculum developers must identify
(Continued)             subtasks so the steps involved in performing tasks are known.
                        Complex tasks can be analyzed more easily if they are broken
                        into subtasks.
                        Breaking a task into subtasks often helps sequence the
                        training.


Guidelines           There are two basic guidelines for identifying subtasks:
for identifying
subtasks                Examine each task statement to see if it contains more than
                        one group of activities that must be performed sequentially or
                        independently.
                        Review the complete list of subtasks for each task, to ensure
                        that no subtasks overlap and that together they account for all
                        performance required.


Example of           An example of subtasks that make up a task is given below.

                        Example of Subtasks
                     Job – Fly the F16 Block 42 aircraft.
                     Duty – Perform a LANTIRN air-to-surface mission.
                     Task – Perform premission planning.

Sequentially and      When identifying subtasks, be aware that some subtasks must be
independently         performed sequentially while others can be performed
performed             independently. Examples are provided below.

Validate              Once the lists of tasks and subtasks have been analyzed, the
task information      results should be verified. Several techniques can be used for
                      verifying the lists, as shown in the examples below.

Selecting tasks to      After the task and subtask lists are verified, the tasks to be
be trained              trained are selected. When selecting the tasks to be trained,
                        several things should be considered. For example, when
                        reviewing the list, consider:

                           Can most job incumbents perform the task without training?
                           How often is the task trained on the job?
                           Will job degradation occur if the task is not trained?
                           Is the task critical to job or mission performance?
                           Is it economical to train the task?
                           Is there enough time to train the task adequately?
                           If people are trained to do another task, will they be able to
                           transfer what they have learned to perform this task without
                           additional training?
                           Will geographical, procedural, and environmental conditions
                           make it unreasonable to train everyone to perform the task?
                           Is the number of persons required to perform the task
                           sufficient? What is the percentage of those performing the
                           task?
                           Is the task difficult to learn? After some experience?
                           If individuals are trained to perform the task, will they
                           remember how to perform the task when they get to the job?


Documenting             A variety of formats can be used to document the task analysis.
the tasks               One simple way to document task analysis is to use a Task
                        Analysis Worksheet similar to the one provided next. Regardless
                        of the format that you use, the key is to document only the
                        identity, training, and support information. The goal is to ensure
                        the quality of the analysis process and have adequate information
                        to develop objectives in the next phase of ISD.

Introduction           In order to design effective and efficient training, the curriculum
                       developer should know for whom the training is being designed.
                       It is essential that an accurate description of the target population
                       be defined so the proper decisions can be made about course
                       design and the resources required to support the design. This
                       analysis further defines the resource decisions made during the
                       initial planning stages for the ISD project.


Definition             A target population analysis is the analysis of the persons for
                       whom the training is designed in order to determine the range of
                       their aptitudes, experiences, and skills and knowledge about the
                       subject matter.

                               Section C
               Analyze Resource Requirements / Constraints

Introduction        Resources are the critical factor in every training system.
                    During the initial planning stages for the ISD project, one of the
                    first concerns is identifying resources required for the training
                    system. This same concern for resources continues into the
                    analysis phase of training development as well. It is unlikely in
                    this phase that all of the needed resources can be identified.
                    However, identification of long-lead-time resources, such as
                    training equipment and facilities, should be identified in order to
                    allow sufficient time to secure the resource. If you are facing a
                    resource constraint, you will need time to work out alternatives.


What are            Training system resources can be categorized into five major
resources?          areas:

                       Equipment, such as aircraft, simulators, part-task trainers
                       Facilities, such as classrooms, ranges, air space
                       Funds for equipment, supplies
                       Personnel, such as instructors, curriculum developers, SMEs
                       (loadmasters, pilots, flight engineers, etc.)
                       Time, such as flying hours, simulator time, training
                       development time


Why analyze         Resources are analyzed in order to identify:
resources?
                       Type of resources required, such as personnel and equipment
                       Quantity of resources required, such as number of instructors,
                       classrooms, trainers
                       When the resources are needed in order to meet the training
                       delivery date
                       Total cost of resources


Who is              Conducting the resource analysis is the responsibility of the
responsible?        curriculum developer. However, securing the needed resources
                    is the responsibility of organizational management, with the
                    assistance of the organization that provides the resources.

Before you analyze   Before beginning to analyze the resources required for the
the resource         training system, consider several things that may help to conduct
requirements         a better analysis.

                     Equipment
                       Most major system-specific or unique equipment items must
                       be identified as early as possible in the ISD process, since
                       they must normally undergo a cycle of design, development,
                       production and testing, prior to delivery.
                       Failure to identify training and support equipment
                       requirements early may result in delay of training
                       implementation.
                       Equipment should not be placed on order or procured until the
                       objectives have been tentatively set for the course, ensuring
                       that there is a valid requirement for the equipment.
                       When selecting equipment for the training system, consider
                       these factors:
                            Suitability or appropriateness
                            Usability
                            Reliability
                            Maintainability
                            Cost

                     Facilities
                       Identify facility requirements as early as possible since the
                       time required to get funds is normally long; also, the time to
                       get approval and build new facilities or modify existing facilities
                       can be considerable.

                     Funding
                       Budgets must often be prepared or revised prior to getting the
                       necessary funds appropriated to:
                            Procure equipment.
                            Buy fuel.
                            Construct or modify facilities.
                            Pay personnel cost.
                       Budgets are normally submitted and approved long before
                       money is actually spent; thus, organizational managers and
                       curriculum developers must determine, as precisely as
                       possible, what resources will be required for the training
                       system.

Analyzing resource   In the analysis phase, all of the resources will need to be
requirements         analyzed in order to identify and estimate the resource

                     a simple job aid can be developed using questions. An example

Updating resource   In the initial planning stages, some of the required resources
requirements        were identified. However, during the initial planning it is
                    impossible to know all the resources that will be needed. This is
                    why resources should be analyzed during the analysis phase. If
                    the analysis is done properly in this phase, a good estimate of the
                    types and quantities of resources can be identified. But this is not
                    the end of resource analysis. As training development
                    progresses through the design and development phases of ISD,
                    resource requirements will continually need to be redefined and
                    fine-tuned. Updating the resource requirements will help to
                    ensure that adequate resources are available to support the
                    training system.

                              Update ISD Evaluation Plan

Introduction          During the initial planning for the ISD project, an ISD evaluation
                      plan was developed. The purpose of the plan was to ensure the
                      quality of the process and products of each phase of ISD. Thus,
                      the evaluation plan becomes the "metric" or standard for
                      continuous evaluation of the training system. To ensure that the
                      plan remains an effective evaluation tool throughout the "life
                      cycle" of the project, it will probably need to be periodically
                      updated.
                                        Caution – Document only as needed.
                                        Do not document just to fill a case file.
Why update the        The nature and scope of every ISD project is different; thus,
evaluation plan?      every ISD evaluation plan will be different. These differences will
                      make it difficult, if not impossible, to develop an ISD evaluation
                      plan that will be "on target" and effective throughout the life cycle
                      of the training system. Therefore, as the analysis phase is
                      completed, it is likely the evaluation plan will need to be updated
                      to reflect the results of the evaluation efforts during the analysis
                      phase. Updating the plan will ensure that it is current and
                      accurate and ready to be used to evaluate the process and the
                      products of the design phase.


Who is                Curriculum developers are responsible for ensuring that the
responsible?          evaluation plan is updated at the end of the analysis phase, as
                      applicable. However, everyone involved in training development
                      is responsible for the quality of the ISD process and products.

                      be limited to:
                            Revisions to the evaluation plan for the analysis phase,

Tracing the          Quality of the analysis process and the resulting products is very
quality process      important to the training development process. Therefore, the
                     curriculum developer should document the evaluation that was
                     conducted during the analysis phase to ensure that the quality
                     process can be traced throughout the entire ISD process,
                     including the analysis phase.

                                  Section E
                      Update Training Development Plan

Introduction         Even before the training development process entered the
                     analysis phase, the curriculum developer wrote a training
                     development plan to serve as a "roadmap" for managing the
                     training development process. It is essential that a plan be
                     developed so that you will have a good idea of where you want to
                     go and how you intend to get there. Because it is essential to
                     write the training development plan in the initial stages of project
                     planning, it will probably need to be periodically updated to ensure
                     that it remains an effective management and development tool.


Why update           The training development plan should be updated at the end of
development          the analysis phase, as applicable, to reflect any changes in the
plans?               training development process resulting from the analysis phase.
                     If the training development plan is not updated, it will become
                     ineffective as a management and training development tool.


Who is               Curriculum developers are responsible for updating the training

Introduction          At this point, the analysis phase has been completed and you are
                      ready to enter the design phase of ISD. During this phase,
                      types of learning and training methods will be reviewed before the
                      framework for the training will be built by developing objectives
                      and designing the training necessary to achieve the objectives.
                      The design selected will play a key role in determining the
                      effectiveness and efficiency of the training that will be developed.
                      Also in this phase, as well as throughout the entire ISD process,
                      quality improvements in the process and products will be a major
                      concern. Much work has been contributed toward the cognitive
                      approaches to instruction. Curriculum designers are encouraged
                      to review the research in this area (see AFHR PR 87-34).

                                 Review Types of Learning

Introduction             In this section, learning is addressed in terms of the individual
                         types of learning and the integration of human activities.
                         Categories of learning types establish a framework for how
                         learning takes place. In real life, these types of learning are
                         integrated. This integration is discussed in terms of schemas,
                         enterprise theory and metaskills.


Types of learning        Learning theorists have categorized human activity into types of
                         learned behavior. Gagné's (1985) categories of learning types
                         are the most inclusive. They include intellectual skills, verbal
                         information, cognitive strategies, motor skills, and attitudes.
                         Gagné suggests that each type of learning requires different
                         internal conditions for processing to occur. Internal conditions
                         may be cued or prompted by external conditions present in the
                         learning environment. The following five areas will be covered:

                            Title                                                      Page
                         Intellectual skills                                            88
                         Verbal information                                             89
                         Cognitive strategies                                           89
                         Motor skills                                                   90
                         Attitudes and motivation                                       90


Intellectual skills      Intellectual skills are the foundation for all higher learning. They
                         consist of discrimination, concepts and rule using. Cognitive
                         strategies are often called a higher-order type of intellectual skill.

                         For the purpose of instructional design intellectual skills needs to
                         be subdivided. Concepts (kinds-of) are different from principles
                         (what-happens) which are different from procedures (how-to).

                         Intellectual skills are hierarchical in nature. In order to learn a
                         higher-order skill, the learner should possess the prerequisites.
                         To learn a rule or principle, the learner should understand the
                         component concepts and the relationships among the concepts.
AFH 36-2235           Volume 8       1 November 2002                                         89



Intellectual skills         Discriminations. Discriminations are skills related to seeing
(Continued)                 differences between stimuli. Most adult problems in
                            discrimination come from physical disabilities like color
                            blindness, hearing loss, or some injury that affects sensory
                            perception.

                            Concrete Concepts. Concrete concepts are skills related to
                            categorizing physical objects into one or more classes based
                            on their physical attributes. Identifying resistors from among
                            other electrical components is an example of concrete
                            concept learning.

                            Defined Concepts. Defined concepts are skills related to
                            classifying symbolic objects into one or more classes based
                            on a definition. The definition is actually a rule for
                            classification. For example, classifying a verbal statement
                            from an officer as a command is an example of a learned
                            defined concept.

                            Rule Learning. Rule learning skills relate to applying
                            principles or procedures to solve problems. Problem solving is
                            the ability to recall relevant rules and use them to solve a
                            novel problem. The product of problem solving is not only a
                            solution to the problem, but also learning a new rule or
                            procedure to be used if a similar situation should arise in the
                            future.


Verbal information       Verbal information is the learning of names and labels that can be
                         verbalized. It is also called declarative knowledge. Verbal
                         information learning requires some basic language skills. In
                         addition, verbal information is more readily retained when it is
                         learned within a larger context of meaningful information.


Cognitive                The basic premise of an information-processing model is that
strategies               individuals mentally process their environment. This process
                         consists of a number of stages in which the stimuli become
                         information, which is given meaning by previous knowledge and
                         current expectations. Cognitive strategies are employed to
                         maintain the knowledge in short-term memory and translate it to a
                         structure that enters long-term memory as a type of knowledge in
                         the form of propositions, productions or schemas.
AFH 36-2235     Volume 8       1 November 2002                                          90



Cognitive          Cognitive strategies are thought of as executive control
strategies         mechanisms for learning. Monitoring the use of strategies is
(Continued)        "metacognition." Cognitive strategies used in metacognition are
                   called metacognitive strategies.

                   There are different types of cognitive strategies such as
                   clustering items into similar groups to reduce memory load,
                   reading strategies to increase comprehension, and others. Good
                   learners have a variety of strategies they can use to process new
                   information.


Motor skills       Motor skills are learned behaviors that involve the smooth
                   coordinated use of muscles. Motor skills most often involve a
                   sequence of activities that may be described verbally as an
                   "executive subroutine." This verbal information is learned to
                   provide guidance for learning the execution of the motor skill.
                   When the learner has acquired the motor skill, the verbal routine
                   is no longer needed and the skill is performed in a smooth and
                   continuous manner.

                   Motor skills may be learned by modeling, as when a coach shows
                   a student how to swing a golf club.

                   Motor skills require practice and kinesthetic (natural) feedback.
                   Verbal feedback from an observer also helps the learner make
                   corrections in performance. Much of the instruction is aimed at
                   getting the student to recognize the feel of the motor performance
                   when it is executed correctly.


Attitudes and      The acquiring of particular attitudes may require the prior learning
motivation         of intellectual skills or particular sets of information. For example,
                   if a positive attitude toward safety is to be acquired, the learner
                   should have (1) intellectual skills (concepts and procedures)
                   associated with safety, and (2) a variety of verbal information
                   about the advantages of following safety procedures or the
                   consequences of not following them.

                   Attitudes have mutually supportive relationships. An individual
                   generally tries to maintain consistency with regard to choice
AFH 36-2235        Volume 8        1 November 2002                                          91



Attitudes and         behaviors. However, attitudes are based on perceptions of reality.
motivation
(Continued)           These perceptions are colored by misinformation or critical
                      experiences.

                      Attitudes are learned by observing others and viewing the
                      consequences of their behavior. This type of learning (vicarious)
                      is a distinct principle of social learning. External conditions for
                      learning attitudes include a human model.

                      Experiences play a major role in the formulation of attitudes.

                      Motivation plays a significant role in learning. Keller (1987) has
                      developed a general model integrating the various sources of
                      motivation for learning. He calls it the ARCS model, an acronym
                      for the four sets of conditions that should be met to have a
                      motivated learner:

                      A for attention.

                          Attention involves grabbing the learner's interest at the
                          beginning of instruction and maintaining that interest
                          throughout the lesson and course.

                      R for relevance.

                          Relevance is the personal significance and value to the
                          learner of mastering the learning objectives.

                      C for confidence.

                          Confidence relates to the learner's expectancy of success.

                      S for satisfaction.

                          Satisfaction comes from achieving performance goals.



Integration of        In real life, the types of learning are integrated. This integration is
human activities      discussed in terms of schemas, enterprise theory and metaskills
AFH 36-2235         Volume 8       1 November 2002                                          92



Schemas                Intellectual skills should be integrated into existing knowledge to
                       be remembered and recalled. They are thought to be stored as
                       schemas and as part of pre-positional networks. A schema is an
                       organization of memory elements (propositions, images, and
                       attitudes) representing a large set of meaningful information
                       pertaining to a general concept. The concept may be of an
                       object, such as a jet fighter, weapon, or officer. Or it may be an
                       event, such as a preflight check or preventive maintenance
                       procedure. Regardless of type, schemas contain information on
                       certain well-understood features of the object or event. The
                       learner fills in these features, called slots, when encountering
                       new information that relates to the schema. Schemas are
                       acquired through experience and may be the greatest benefit of
                       apprenticeships. Recent theory proposes that intellectual skills
                       are "situated." That means their utility is in a large part a function
                       of how they are learned. In order that they do not become "inert
                       knowledge," they should be learned and practiced within a
                       broader context.


Enterprise theory      Gagné and Merrill (1990) proposed a method to identify learning
                       goals that requires an integration of multiple objectives. They
                       proposed that such an integration of multiple objectives be
                       conceived in terms of the pursuit of a comprehensive purpose in
                       which the learner is engaged, called enterprise. An enterprise is
                       a purposeful, planned activity that may depend for its execution
                       on some combination of verbal information, intellectual skills, and
                       cognitive strategies, all related by their involvement in the
                       common goal. A task for the instructional developer is to identify
                       the goal of a targeted enterprise along with its component skills,
                       knowledge, and attitudes, and then to design instruction that
                       enables the student to acquire the capability of achieving this
                       integrated outcome.


Metaskills             The metaskill concept (Spears, 1983) refers to the complex skills
                       of adapting, monitoring, and correcting the use of individual skills
                       in complex performances that integrate cognitive, perceptual, and
                       motor processes. Proficiency in metaskills depends on the
                       number of individual skills practiced. Plateaus in performance
                       are related to the intervals required for students to put together
                       new sets of metaskills.

                                     Section B
                              Select Training Methods

Introduction          Selecting the training method is an important activity in the
                      training design process. The method selected will impact
                      effectiveness and efficiency of the training system.


Definition            A training method is the process used to deliver the instructional
                      content and to provide guidance for students to retain the skills
                      and knowledge imparted. Examples include lecture,
                      demonstration, and self-study.


Training methods      There are many training methods that can be selected, as
                      described in the following material.


Selection             There are several factors to be considered when selecting
considerations        training methods for the training system. These factors can be
                      categorized into three major areas: constraints, cost-efficiency,
                      and training considerations.


Constraints           Constraints include:

                         Geographical spread of target population–If the target
                         population is widely spread it may not be feasible to bring
                         students to a central location for training. If this is the case,
                         classroom training may not be the appropriate training
                         method. Consider other training methods such as OJT, self-
                         study.
                         Student availability–If there is an insufficient flow of students
                         due to lack of resource constraints, it is unlikely that class-
                         room training will be appropriate. OJT or self-study may be a
                         better method. Also, consider using CBT if there are large
                         numbers of students to be trained over a long period of time.
                         Instructors/trainers availability–If instructors/trainers are not
                         available, consider using other training methods such as self-
                         study.
                         Facilities and equipment availability–If there is a lack of
                         adequate facilities and equipment to handle student flow,
                         consider OJT or self-study.
AFH 36-2235    Volume 8       1 November 2002                                         95



Constraints          Development time–Training methods such as CBT require
(Continued)          considerable development time. If there is limited time or only
                     a few students to be trained, consider other training methods
                     such as self-study or OJT.
                     Safety–When performance of the objective could cause loss
                     of life, bodily harm, or loss of equipment, consider other
                     methods such as CBT.
                     Non-availability of ICW development specialist–If neither the
                     personnel nor the funds to acquire them are available, you
                     may have to consider other training methods, such as lecture
                     combined with video.
                     The following form includes points for different training
                     methods.

                           TRAINING METHODS
Presentation      Presentation methods include:
methods              Lecture – A formal or semiformal oral presentation of
                     information by a single individual; facts, concepts, problems,
                     relationships, rules or principles presented orally either
                     directly (as by classroom instructor) or indirectly (as by video).
                     Demonstration – Presentation or portrayal of a sequence of
                     events to show a procedure, technique, or operation;
                     frequently combines an oral explanation with the operation or
                     handling of systems equipment or material. May be
                     presented directly (as by a classroom instructor) or indirectly
                     (as by video).
                     Exhibit – A visual or print display used to present information;
                     for example, actual equipment, models, mockups, graphic
                     materials, displays, chalkboard, or projected images.
                     Indirect Discourse – Verbal interaction among two or more
                     individuals which is heard by the student; may be a
                     dramatization, such as role playing, or a dialogue between
                     panel members, or a teaching interview (a question and
                     answer session between instructor and visiting "expert").
                     Assigned Reading – Printed verbal materials such as books,
                     periodicals, manuals, or handouts. Reading may be course-
                     assigned or self-assigned.
                     Teaching Interview – Question and answer session between
                     the instructor and visiting "expert" following a highly structured
                     plan.
AFH 36-2235      Volume 8       1 November 2002                                         96




                     TRAINING METHODS (Continued)
Student verbal      Student verbal instruction methods include:
instruction            Questioning – An instructor and/or courseware controlled
methods                interactive process used to emphasize a point, stimulate
                       thinking, keep students alert, check understanding, or review
                       material. Questioning may be direct, as by a classroom
                       instructor, or may be designed into a film or television
                       presentation.
                       Programmed Questioning – An instructor and/or courseware
                       controlled interactive process used to systematically demand
                       a sequence of appropriate student responses; may be used
                       directly (as by an instructor in a classroom) or indirectly (as by
                       programmed booklets or computers).
                       Student Query – The provision by which students are given
                       the opportunity to search for information, as by questioning a
                       classroom instructor, tutor, coach, or an appropriately
                       programmed computer.
                       Seminar – A peer-controlled group interactive process in
                       which task- or objective-related information and experience
                       are evoked from the students. Questions may be used to
                       evoke student contributions, but the seminar is distinguished
                       from questioning.
                       Discussion – An instructor-controlled interactive process of
                       sharing information and experiences related to achieving a
                       training objective.


Knowledge           Knowledge application methods include:
application            Performance – Student interactions with things, data, or
methods                persons, as is necessary to attain training objectives; includes
                       all forms of simulation (for example, games and interaction
                       with hardware simulators) and interaction with actual
                       equipment or job materials (for example, forms).

                       Performance may be supervised by classroom instructor,
                       tutor, coach, or peer to provide needed feedback.

                       Case Study – A carefully designed description of a problem
                       situation, written specifically to provoke systematic analysis
                       and discussion.
AFH 36-2235       Volume 8       1 November 2002                                          97



Cost-efficiency      Cost-efficiency points include:

                        Trained Personnel Requirements (TPR) – Expensive delivery
                        systems such as CBT may be justified if the TPR is large and
                        the training is required over a long period of time. A training
                        method you would not likely use to train a large TPR is OJT.
                        Content stability – If training content requires frequent
                        updates, methods such as CBT are less suitable than
                        classroom, OJT, or self-study.
                        Amount of practice required – If there is a lot of practice
                        required you may want to consider ICW as a training method,
                        since practice time is only limited by the availability of the
                        student and the equipment. In the classroom or OJT,
                        however, an instructor or trainer is required, which makes
                        practice time costly.


Training             Training considerations include:
considerations
                        Task criticality – If task performance is critical, consider formal
                        classroom training or OJT. Self-study would be a
                        questionable training method for training critical tasks.
                        Learning difficulty – A task that is difficult to learn should be
                        taught using the classroom or OJT method, or a part-task
                        trainer may be appropriate.
                        Training fidelity – If the training fidelity requirement is high,
                        consider selecting a method that uses the actual equipment to
                        teach the process or procedures.
                        Interaction level. If the learning process requires a great deal
                        of interaction, OJT is probably the best, since it is highly
                        interactive. If the group size is small, classroom training can
                        provide moderate interaction. You may not want to use self-
                        study if the learning process requires high interactivity.

                                Develop Objectives

Introduction         One of the products of the analysis phase is a listing of tasks
                     requiring training. In the design phase of ISD, this task list will be
                     used to develop the objectives for the course. Objectives serve
                     as the "foundation" of the course on which all training is built.
                     When developing the objectives, remember that objectives
                     should be stated in terms of what the students must be able to do
                     at the end of training.


Definition           An objective is a precise statement of the learned capability–
                     skills, knowledge or attitudes (SKA)–a student is expected to be
                     able to demonstrate, the condition under which the SKA is to be
                     exhibited, and the minimum standard of acceptable performance.


Purpose              Objectives serve several purposes. Examples are given below.


                     For Curriculum Developers           For Students

                        Serve as the foundation for         Direct attention to the
                        building training.                  important content.

                        development.                        performance expected
                        Allow for selection of the          following the training.
                        most appropriate training           Serve as a self-check for
                        strategies.                         progress.



Other terms for      Objectives have been given many names, such as:
objectives
                        Performance objectives
                        Behavioral objectives
                        Instructional objectives
                        Training objectives
                        Criterion-referenced objectives (CROs)

Parts of an      An objective has three parts:
objective
                    Condition
                    Learned Capability
                    Standard

                 Each part of the objective is discussed later in this section under
                 "Characteristics of Objectives."


Levels of        Many terms have been used to describe the levels of objectives.
objectives       The following terms are often used to distinguish the levels.

                    Terminal
                    Primary
                    Enabling

                    Supporting
                    Subordinate

                 This handbook will only refer to the different levels in order to
                 show the hierarchical relationship of objectives.


Examples of      The following are some examples of objectives.

                    Given a diagram of the Primary Alerting System (PAS) panel,
                    and a list of functions and incomplete statements relating to
                    the PAS panel operation, the trainee will perform the following
                    to 85% accuracy, correctable to 100%.
                        Recall the function of each control and indication by
                        matching the proper function to the control or indicator in
                        the diagram.
                        Recall each PAS operation by completing each
                        statement.

Introduction           Before starting to develop objectives, curriculum developers
                       should be able to recognize each part of an objective, given
                       examples. Familiarity with the parts of an objective will ensure
                       that better objectives are developed, which produces better
                       training.

                                   Condition

Introduction      Curriculum developers should thoroughly understand the
                  condition part of an objective in order to develop more effective
                  objectives. When developing objectives, use the actual condi-
                  tions under which the job will be performed, if possible.


Definition        A condition identifies the situation under which a student is
                  expected to demonstrate a behavior as a result of the training. A
                  properly prepared objective clearly states the limits and/or
                  conditions of student performance. A condition may describe:

                     If the student can use the checklist
                     If the student is allowed to use the flight manual
                     What equipment students are allowed to use
                     If students can use notes they have taken during the training


Examples          The following are some examples of variable conditions, which
                  can very from situation to situation and not affect the type of
                  learning involved.

                     "Given an AN/TPQ-43 radar set, ..."
                     "Using a diagram of the Flight Director system, ..."
                     "Given incomplete statements on Offensive Radar System
                     operation, ..."
                     "Without reference, ..."
                     "Under conditions of total darkness, ..."
                     "Given a checklist, and the Dash One, ..."
AFH 36-2235    Volume 8       1 November 2002                                          103



                               Learned Capability

Introduction      The capability part of the objective states what the students will
                  do to demonstrate that they have learned a specific skill,
                  knowledge or attitude. The capability must be written in
                  measurable, observable terms so that student performance can
                  be objectively evaluated.


Description       A capability is defined as an observable, measurable
                  performance that the student should demonstrate.


Action verbs      When writing the capability part of an objective, use action verbs
                  to reduce ambiguity. Action verbs are observable and
                  measurable, while ambiguous ones are not. The following table
                  provides some examples.

                     Action Verbs                       Ambiguous Verbs
                     Perform                            Understand
                     Fly                                Know
                     List                               Learn


Examples          Several examples of learned capability statements are:

                     "… locate Electrical Multiplex controls …"
                     "… recall the function of each control …"
                     "… perform a built-in-test on HUD …"
                     "… fly a low-approach …"

                                       Standard

Introduction         The final part of the objective to be discussed is the standard.
                     The student's performance will result in an output; the quantity or
                     quality of which is the standard of performance.


Definition           A standard defines the criteria for acceptable performance by the
                     student. It is stated in terms of completeness, accuracy
                     requirements, time constraints, performance rates, or qualitative
                     requirements. It identifies the proficiency the students must
                     achieve when they perform the behavior under the specified
                     conditions. Without a standard, it is impossible to determine
                     when the students have achieved the objective.


Types of standards   Standards can be classified in one of the following types.

                            Types of Standards                     Example
                     Standard operating procedure       "… will comply with AF and
                                                        local regulations."
                     No error                           "… egress from the aircraft."
                     Minimum acceptable level of        "… compute the distance to the
                     performance                        nearest five-mile increment."
                     Time requirements                  "… take-off within five minutes."
                     Rate of production                 "… run built-in test on the INS
                                                        three times."
                     Qualitative requirements           "… complete an S maneuver
                                                        smoothly."
                     Amount of supervision              "… identifies and corrects
                                                        errors without assistance (ACC
                                                        flying standards)."

Example          Some examples of standards are:

                    "… list the procedures for aborting a take-off" (without error
                    implied).
                    "… within three miles."
                    "… with no more than 5% error."
                    "… IAW the Dash One."
                    "… in no more than two minutes."

                    Guidelines for Developing Objectives

Introduction      To this point, background information and the three parts of the
                  objective have been discussed. The next stage is to actually
                  develop objectives. The task list, which was developed in the
                  previous phase, will be required in this effort. Using the
                  information on the task list, what has been learned about
                  objectives to this point, and the following guidelines, effective
                  objectives can be developed.


Guidelines        Use the guidelines below when developing objectives.

                     Use the task list developed during the analysis phase.
                     Analyze each task or knowledge item on the task list to
                     determine the number of objectives for each item.
                     Document each objective on a worksheet.
                     Analyze each objective to determine the skills, knowledge,
                     and attitudes necessary to support the objective.
                     Use the supporting skills, knowledge, and attitudes to develop
                     sub-objective(s).
                     Document any sub-objective(s) on the worksheet of the objec-
                     tive they support.

                                  Hierarchy of Objectives

Introduction           Each task is made up of steps or procedures. Students must
                       learn each of these steps or procedures before they can perform
                       the particular task. Thus, objectives need to be specified for
                       each step or procedure, in addition to the task itself. These
                       different levels of objectives can be structured into an objective
                       map that depicts the relationship of the various objectives and
                       their sequence in the course. This map is called objective or
                       learning hierarchy.


Purpose                The purpose of an objective hierarchy is to depict the relationship
                       of objectives so that the most effective and efficient training
                       sequence can be developed.


Classification of      Objectives can be classified into two categories. These
objectives             categories are shown below.

                        Category        Description                      Other Names

                                     several subordinate objectives.

                       Enabling Objectives.

                    Starting with the terminal objectives at the top, the question is
                    asked: "To be able to perform as specified in the objective, what
                    essential skills, knowledge, or attitudes must the individual
                    possess?" This will yield a number of major components. For
                    each component, the question is asked again. The output of this
                    procedure is a multilevel hierarchy in which the objectives at any
                    one level of a hierarchy leg are prerequisite and essential to
                    performing the objectives at the next higher level. A completed
                    objective hierarchy reveals all of the objectives that are to be
                    learned. It also specifies the coordinate and subordinate
                    relationships, suggests the order in which they should be learned,
                    and cross-references enabling objectives across legs of the
                    hierarchy.

                             The hierarchy can be depicted graphically or as
                             statements numbered to reflect the hierarchy.

                     Note the numbering used in the table. The numbering is used to
                     identify the terminal and enabling objectives. These numbers are
                     useful later when the objectives are sequenced for training,
                     lesson materials are designed, and tests are developed for the
                     objectives.

               Prioritizing, Clustering, and Sequencing Objectives

Introduction       Once the objectives and sub-objectives have been identified, the
                   next step is to prioritize, cluster, and sequence them into units of
                   training. A unit of training is defined as any unit of training such
                   as a course, module, block, or lesson. Guidelines for prioritizing,
                   clustering, and sequencing objectives are provided in this portion
                   of the section. Additional information on clustering and
                   sequencing objectives can be found later in this chapter under
                   the section “Designing Training Activities.”


Who is             The curriculum developer and the SMEs for the flying
responsible?       organizations are responsible for prioritizing objectives, as
                   necessary. Also, the developer or development team is
                   responsible for clustering and sequencing objectives.


Prioritize         Prioritizing objectives may not be required in all training
objectives         development projects. However, as the Air Force budget
                   continues to shrink, you may be faced with the need to prioritize
                   the objectives in order to provide the necessary training.
                   For example:

                       “You need four days to train students on the Flight Director
                       system. However, due to scheduling constraints you can
                       only have three days.”

                   Guideline
                   There is a simple guideline to follow if faced with this situation.
                   That guideline is to have SMEs in the flying organizations
                   prioritize the objectives that are to be taught. Once the objectives
                   have been prioritized, the curriculum developer designs the
                   training to cover as many of the objectives as possible in three
                   days.

                   When Should You Prioritize?
                   Objectives should be prioritized if there is a possibility that a
                   resource constraint will not allow all objectives to be taught.
                   Decisions on prioritizing objectives can often be made during the
                   Training Planning Team (TPT) meeting.
AFH 36-2235   Volume 8       1 November 2002                                         111



Clustering       Clustering or grouping objectives allows logical and meaningful
objectives       units of training to be designed. Without clustering, it would be
                 impossible to design effective and efficient training. Four basic
                 guidelines for clustering objectives are provided.

                      Techniques for Clustering Objectives into Individual
                                                Lessons
                 Cluster objectives that are prerequisites to other objectives.
                     For example – Basic flying skills and knowledge may be
                     required for many tasks in a course; therefore, they may be
                     clustered in the same unit and taught in the core training.
                 Cluster objectives that are related to the same system or engage
                 the same type of action.
                     For example – All tasks related to the operating of a particular
                     piece of navigation equipment on an aircraft may be clustered
                     into a unit.
                 Cluster objectives with common skills and knowledge.
                     For example – Several flying maneuvers (tasks) may require
                     identical skills and knowledge to perform.
                 Cluster objectives with potential for the same training method or
                 delivery system.
                     For example – Knowledge objectives may utilize a training
                     method such as a lecture while skill objectives may be taught
                     by demonstration/performance and clustered together. Also,
                     objectives with the same type of learning may be grouped
                     together to facilitate learning such as classroom, equipment.


Sequencing       Properly sequencing objectives plays a key role in the
objectives       effectiveness and efficiency of training design. Improperly
                 sequenced objectives can result in training being provided at the
                 wrong time for effective learning, which results in a waste of
                 resources. Properly sequencing objectives involves sequencing
                 objectives within units or modules, as well as the course itself.
                 Two basic guidelines for sequencing objectives are provided
                 below.

Sequencing                    Guidelines for Sequencing Objectives
objectives
(Continued)      Teach prerequisite skills and knowledge first.
                     For example – A student should be taught aircraft engine
                     operation prior to being taught how to start the engine.
                 Follow the fixed sequence or logical order in performing a task.
                     For example – The student should be taught to perform
                     cockpit checks prior to being taught to start the engine.
                 Place the more easily learned and familiar objectives early in the
                 sequence with the more complex and unfamiliar objectives.
                     For example – A student should be taught what ailerons are
                     and how they work prior to being taught how to do an aileron
                     roll.

                                      Section D
                                    Develop Tests

Introduction          At this point, the objectives have been developed, clustered, and
                      sequenced for the course. The next task in the training design
                      process is to develop tests to assess the student's attainment of
                      the learned capability specified in the objectives. To ensure that
                      tests adequately measure the objectives they support, the
                      performance required in the test must match the performance
                      required in the objective. This section will address the various
                      aspects of tests and test development.


Purpose               The primary purpose of testing is to assess the student's
                      attainment of the behavior specified in the objective. Other
                      purposes of tests are to:

                         Identify and correct problems or weaknesses in the training.
                         Indicate instructor proficiency.


Testing               The Air Force measurement program is based on the concept of
concepts              criterion testing, which is basically a go/no-go type of testing.
                      This form of testing rates the student with respect to the
                      standards of performance that are specified in the objectives. To
                      attain an objective, the student must meet or exceed the standard
                      specified in the objective. All terminal objectives selected for
                      training must be tested. Enabling objectives can be randomly
                      selected as long as they assess the student's attainment of the
                      specified behavior.


Develop a test plan   The test plan may be developed as a separate document or as
                      part of the training development plan or evaluation plan. The
                      primary areas of concern in the plan are:

                         How to handle student failure
                         How to remediate a student(s)
                         How tests are administered, scored, and trended
                         When student should face flying evaluation board (FEB)

                      If a computer-managed testing program is used, the test plan
                      should identify how it will be carried out and who is responsible.

Types of test           As a curriculum developer, you will likely be required to develop
                        one or more different types of tests. The basic types of tests
                        used in the Air Force are described below.

                                              the objective.
                                              Used to measure the effectiveness of the
                                              instruction.

                                              skills and knowledge necessary to perform
                                              the terminal objective.
                                              Used during validation to predict success, to
                                              identify and correct weaknesses in the
                                              instruction.
                        Survey                Used to determine what prospective students
                                              already know and can do before receiving
                                              instruction.
                                              Used during development of instruction to
                                              gather data for design of instruction.


Characteristics of      There are several characteristics to be considered when
tests                   developing tests. These characteristics ensure the tests measure
                        what is intended each time they are administered. The
                        characteristics are shown in the following table.

                        Characteristic        Definition

Comparison of         In the past, most predictive tests were written paper-and-pencil
performance and       type tests, because they are easy to produce, administer and
predictive tests      score. The most common types of written test questions are
                      essay, short answer, fill-in-the-blank, labeling, multiple-choice,
                      matching, and true-false. Today's media provide other testing
                      options. Computers provide different types of input systems that
                      can have a high degree of fidelity with real-world tasks. Even a
                      simple input device such as a joystick or a mouse allows for
                      identification by pointing with a cursor. More elaborate devices
                      such as magnetic field detectors, infrared detectors, etc., allow
                      the computer to detect even more complex behavior.

                      How does an instructional designer decide what type of test to
                      construct or what type of item to use? The best type of test is
                      one that gives the decision-maker the best information regarding
                      the student's mastery of the objective. Different types of test
                      items have advantages and disadvantages with regard to good
                      test construction. These advantages and disadvantages have to
                      be considered in terms of validity and reliability of the test.

Test construction      Several key factors should be considered when constructing
factors                tests.

                          What to measure. Analysis of objectives should identify what
                          should be measured. To determine what to measure, list the
                          tasks to be performed or objective statement to be covered by
                          the test. One or more test items may be needed to
                          adequately measure each objective. Tests should measure
                          application of principles, knowledge of factual information,
                          ability to perform task, and transfer of knowledge and skills to
                          solve similar problems.

                          This is the most important aspect of test construction. If the
                          conditions of testing are not consistent with the objectives
                          then the test will not measure the desired behavior.

                          Testing level. The level of testing (know, comprehend, etc.)
                          should correlate with the stated level of learning for that
                          portion of the instruction being tested–no higher and no lower.

                          Test length. Adequate coverage of the objective is the major
                          factor in determining the length of test that is required. Longer
                          tests are normally more reliable since they usually cover the
                          material better.

                          Selection and arrangement of test items. Select test items
                          that cover the most essential and significant portions of the
                          material. Test items selected should be clear, concise and
                          well written to minimize misunderstandings. Items of the
                          same type should be grouped together in a test, if possible.
                          Individual test items should also be arranged in approximate
                          order of difficulty, which allows the students to progress as far
                          as they can without spending excessive time on difficult items
                          at the first part of the test.

Test development      There are many good tools / models used by curriculum
guidelines            developers to determine which test type would best measure
                      attainment of the desired behavior. AFH 36-2235, Volume 2, lists
                      several. Specific guidelines for constructing different test formats
                      are provided.

Constructing         As a curriculum developer, you will need to be able to write
written tests        effective tests in order to measure what the students have
                     learned or can do. The following information is provided on
                     preparing the most common types of written tests:

Multiple choice      Multiple-choice tests are probably the most used type of written
                     tests. They test recall, problem-solving skills, application of facts
                     and principles, and understanding. A multiple-choice item
                     consists of a stem (a question or uncompleted statement), a
                     correct response, and distracters (incorrect responses).

                     Example


                     Directions––Carefully read the questions or statements below
                     and circle the correct response. There is only one correct
                     response.

                        1. What is the minimum continuous level flight airspeed (lock
                           point)?

                             a.   142 KTAS
                             b.   151 KTAS
                             c.   181 KTAS
                             d.   184 KTAS


                     Construction Guidelines

                        Do not use the articles "a" and "an" at the end of the stem;
                        this tends to indicate the correct answer.
                        All responses should follow grammatically from the stem.
                        All responses should be of approximately the same length.
                        All responses should have a similar grammatical structure.
                        All responses should use similar terminology.
                        Provide as many responses as necessary, but normally no
                        less than three.
                        Position the correct response randomly throughout the test.
                        Limit the use of responses such as "none of the above" or "all
                        of the above."
                        Distracters should be plausible, but incorrect.
                        Numerical responses should be arranged in ascending or
                        descending order.
AFH 36-2235    Volume 8       1 November 2002                                        120



True / false      A true/false test should be used sparingly since the chance of
                  random guessing is high. True/false tests may be used when you
                  want a student to identify a completely true or completely false
                  statement.

                  Example


                  Directions––Carefully read the question below and circle true or
                  false to indicate the correct response.

                  True False      1. The minimum continuous level flight airspeed
                                     (lock point) is 151 KTAS.

                  True False      2. The L/D maximum airspeed is 85 KTAS
                                     electrical.


                  Construction Guidelines

                     Include only one idea in each statement.
                     Place the crucial element at or near the end of the statement.
                     Avoid using negatives, as they tend to confuse students.
                     Do not use absolutes such as "all," "every," "none," and
                     "never."
                     Do not use vague terms such as "some," "any," and
                     "generally."
AFH 36-2235      Volume 8          1 November 2002                                      121




Matching             A matching test is used to measure a student's ability to identify
                     and discriminate among related or similar items. Matching items
                     normally use two columns of related items, and students are
                     required to match a series of items listed in one column with
                     related items in the other column. It provides a way to test
                     multiple knowledge simultaneously.

                     Example


Directions––Listed in the two columns below are words and phrases. Select the
phrase in the right-hand column that defines the word in the left-hand column and
place the identifying letter in the blank space provided. Some of the phrases may be
used more than one time, while others may not be used at all. The first item is
answered as an example.

1. - 5.                     a.   The ability to detect small differences in the mastery of
                                 the subject matter.
 c Validity                 b.   The degree to which a test is easy to administer, score,
   Reliability                   and interpret test results.
   Objectivity              c.   The ability to measure what it is designed to measure.
   Comprehensiveness        d.   The degree to which adequate numbers of test items
   Differentiation               are used for each objective.
   Usability                e.   The ability to give consistent results.
                            f.   Often determined by correlating the original test scores
                                 with those obtained in a retest.
                            g.   Test score that is not influenced by bias or personal
                                 opinion of the score.
                            h.   Assumed to be present when a job is learned to a high
                                 level of proficiency within a reasonable time.


                     Construction Guidelines

                        Provide clear, concise directions on how to match the items in
                        the two columns.
                        Indicate if the responses may be used more than once or not
                        at all.
                        Limit test items to a single area and the choices to a single
                        subject matter category.
                        Arrange the responses in the same logical order.
AFH 36-2235   Volume 8       1 November 2002                                        122



Completion       A completion test item requires the students to recall and supply
                 one or more key words that have been omitted from the
                 statement. The word(s), when placed in the appropriate blanks,
                 make the statement complete, meaningful, and true.

                 Example


                 Directions––Complete the sentences below by adding the correct
                 word(s) in the blank spaces that are provided.

                 1. In a formation takeoff, wingtip clearance to be maintained is
                    ____ to ____ feet.

                 2. During formation takeoff, altitude indicated by ____ and
                    _____ should match that of lead throughout the takeoff.


                 Construction Guidelines

                    Leave blanks for key words only.
                    Keep items brief.
                    Make all blanks approximately the same size.
                    Grammatical cues to the correct answer, such as articles like
                    "a" or "an" right before the blank, should be avoided.
                    Ensure that only one correct answer fits each block.
AFH 36-2235      Volume 8       1 November 2002                                        123




Labeling or         A labeling or identification test is used to measure a student's
identification      ability to recall and label parts in pictures, schematics, diagrams,
                    or drawings. This form of testing is most often used to measure
                    recognition of equipment components or other concrete objects.

                    Example


                    Directions––Identify the numbered items of a CPU-26 computer.
                    Place the correct answer in the space provided.


                    Construction Guidelines

                       Make all sketches, drawings or illustrations clear and of
                       sufficient size. If possible, use the actual parts of a unit.
                       Provide sufficient information to indicate what the equipment
                       is and which part is to be labeled.
                       The parts to be labeled or identified should be clearly pointed
                       out by using lines or arrows.
                       Ensure that only one definite answer is possible.

Essay            An essay test, which is not normally used in technical training,
                 requires extensive discussion by the student. These tests should
                 be used only when students are expected to think reflectively or
                 creatively, to organize knowledge in the solution of a problem,
                 and to express their solution in writing.

                 Example


                 Direction––Complete the essay question in 500 words or less.
                 Use only one side of the paper to write your response.

                 Test Item––Describe the effect wind shears have on an aircraft
                 during the landing approach.


                 Construction Guidelines

                    State essay item clearly so students know exactly what type
                    of discussion is expected.
                    The essay item should ask for comparisons, decisions,
                    solutions, cause-effect relationships, explanations and
                    summaries.
                    When possible, use more essay items and limit the discussion
                    on each.
                    Set limits on essay questions, such as time or number of
                    words.
                    Determine how the question will be scored for objective
                    grading.

                               4     Review the checklist for accuracy and
                                     completeness.
                               5     Publish checklists in adequate quantities.


Constructing           Performance tests, which require the student to perform a task,
performance tests /    usually take the format of a checklist. The checklist is developed
checklists             to correspond to the steps or activities of the task being
                       performed. During the performance test, an evaluator observes
                       the student performing a series of steps or activities while rating
                       the steps on a checklist (process evaluation). An evaluator may
                       also rate the end product of a performance on a checklist
                       (product evaluation). For operational flying, reaction time is often
                       considered as well as the correct action to take. As the students
                       gain experience, they are expected to improve.

Performance            When a performance test requires the steps or activities to be
test using a           rated, a process checklist is used. The checklist should contain
process checklist      all of the essential steps or activities for successful performance.
                       The actual weapon system checklist should be used when
                       possible, especially since different techniques can provide the
                       same results. The courseware developed with the help of the
                       SME may have to select only one technique for training and
                       testing. The flying evaluation grade sheet is also used to record
                       proper performance and to brief students on how well (or poorly)
                       they did. Items are repeated in a phase of instruction until the
                       desired standard is achieved. Constant monitoring by the
                       student's flying supervisor allows for remedial action, when
                       necessary. Following is an example of a process checklist.

                          to be evaluated.
                          The step or activity must be observable.
                          Define all of the steps or activities of the task being
                          performed.
                          Sequence steps or activities in order of performance.
                          Provide space for checking the performance of each step or
                          activity.
                          Provide space for recording and describing errors.

Performance            When a performance test requires the product of a process or a
test using a           task to be evaluated, you will probably want to use a product
product checklist      checklist. The checklist should identify criteria or characteristics
                       of product acceptability. Following is an example of a product
                       checklist.

                       Guidelines for Construction and Use

                          Use a checklist when the objective requires the student to
                          produce something.
                          Use a checklist when the product can be readily evaluated.
                          Use a checklist when there are no fixed or set procedures.
                          Identify the characteristics of the product.
                          Provide space on the checklist for product rating.
                          Provide space on checklist for comments about the product.

                               Review Existing Materials

Introduction           Developing training materials can be expensive and time-
                       consuming. Therefore, after developing objectives and tests,
                       review existing training materials to determine if materials exist
                       that will support the course objectives. If materials are found, it is
                       possible that they will not totally support the objectives. If so,
                       don't hesitate to modify the material to fit your need. You may
                       even use portions of existing materials to your advantage. The
                       time you spend reviewing existing material will be time well spent.


Benefits               Using existing materials saves time, human resources, materials,
                       and money.


Sources of             There are several sources for existing training materials, such as:
materials
                          DoD
                          Other military branches
                          Interservice organizations
                          Other federal agencies
                          Commercial
                          Colleges and universities


Types of existing      When reviewing existing training materials, you may find them in
material               some of the following forms:

                          Printed materials (e.g., textbooks, technical orders,
                          handbooks, job aids)
                          Slides
                          Video
                          Audio cassettes
                          Computer-based [ICW, Computer-Assisted Instruction (CAI)]
                          Training aids

Modifying               Sometimes you may find that existing material is available for use
existing materials      but it needs modification. When modifying existing materials you
                        may:

                           Add new material such as information on the operation of a
                           particular piece of equipment that was not covered in the
                           existing material available.
                           Expand existing materials to include more detailed
                           information, diagrams, illustrations and examples.
                           Delete materials that do not support your objective(s).
                           Update material to include current information, such as
                           revised procedures, data, and to correct inaccuracies.
                           Re-sequence material to make it compatible with your training
                           design.

                                Design Training

Introduction       If you cannot find existing materials that fit your needs, you
                   should proceed to design your own training. Your design will
                   determine the effectiveness and efficiency of the training system.
                   Training design should be determined by what best meets the
                   training needs rather than just using a particular training design
                   that has always been used in your training organization.

                                 Determine Training Strategies

Introduction             After the objectives and related tests have been developed and
                         you know what behaviors are required, you should plan and
                         develop the most effective and efficient learning environment
                         using principles of learning. This process starts by determining
                         the training strategies or plan you intend to use. A training
                         strategy is necessary in order to manage the design of the
                         training activities and the learning process.


Determining              Training strategies can be determined from the following issues:
training strategies
                            Student participation
                            Student feedback
                            Student pacing
                            Training sequence

                         Student Participation

                         Active student participation is essential for learning to take place.
                         Students learn by doing, thinking, and feeling–through answering
                         questions, discussing, computing, manipulating, and putting ideas
                         together. The training strategy ensures that students are active
                         in the learning process and that they can apply or demonstrate
                         what they have learned. Learning is a process in which students
                         gain skills and knowledge, and form attitudes through their own
                         activities, experiences, and motivations. For each type of
                         learning, consider using the following strategies.

                                                    Have student do each step of the task
                                                    following the demonstration.
                                                    Have student perform the entire task

                         Student Feedback

                         Students participating in the teaching/learning activity will need
                         feedback on how well they are doing. The kind of feedback, as
                         well as the scheduling of feedback, depends on the kind of
                         learning. Feedback not only informs the students of how well
                         they are doing, but also serves as a valuable source of
                         motivation. The training strategy should provide each student
                         with feedback, whether it is the result of a written test or instructor
                         comments during the performance of a task. Ask frequent
                         questions and provide feedback to address any possible student
                         misunderstanding about the content.

                         Student Pacing

                         Pacing is the rate students go through the training. There are
                         several ways to pace students' progress.

                            Group-Paced – Students progress through the training
                            together as a group at the same rate. This is a very effective
                            pacing method when training large numbers of students.
                            However, it does not allow individuals to deviate from the
                            group rate.
                            Group Lock-Step – The group progresses through the training
                            at a predetermined pace, completing training on schedule.
                            This is normally the most costly form of pacing. However, in
                            cases where timing is critical, it is very effective.
                            Self-Paced – Students are allowed to work at their own pace
                            through the training within certain parameters. This form of

Determining                 pacing is very effective in courses using CBT, interactive
training strategies         video and self-study.
(Continued)                 Combination Pacing – Any of the above-mentioned forms of
                            pacing may be used in combination.

                         Instructional Sequence

                         The following sequence considerations also determine training
                         strategies.

                            Proficiency Advancement – This technique is used to advance
                            students who have prior knowledge, practical experience, or
                            are exceptionally fast learners. Students show their
                            proficiency by passing a criterion test and may bypass the
                            training in which they have passed the criterion test.
                            Multiple Track – A training sequence may be divided into
                            various tracks to allow students to go through training best
                            suited to their abilities and needs. The best track for a student
                            is determined by a pretest.
                            Modular Scheduling – Training is divided into different
                            modules and students are pre-tested to determine which
                            modules of training they need. Modular scheduling is
                            normally used only when the learning sequence is not critical.

                          Design Training Activities

Introduction      Design of the training activity depends largely on two factors –
                  training sequence and size of the training segment. Effective and
                  efficient training depends on how well you sequence and size the
                  training.


Reasons for       Properly sequenced training provides:
sequencing
                     Student motivation – Students learn best when they are
                     motivated. Motivation often depends on a proper sense of
                     direction. Early stages of training should provide a sense of
                     direction. Properly sequenced training will provide direction
                     and gives students a "mental" roadmap of where they are
                     going and how they are going to get there.
                     Meaningful relationship – Proper sequence provides students
                     with a pattern of relationships so that each training activity has
                     a purpose. If the training is meaningful to the students, they
                     will learn more easily and quickly.
                     Content consistency – Proper sequencing helps avoid
                     inconsistencies in the training content. Carefully sequenced
                     training will help eliminate gaps and duplication. Consistency
                     of content ensures that skill progression is orderly and
                     prerequisite skills and knowledge have been acquired prior to
                     introduction of advanced subject matter content or
                     performance of more complex tasks.


Sequencing           There are several methods of sequencing training.
training
                     Job performance order – This method sequences training in
                     the order in which the tasks and subtasks are performed.
                     Tasks and subtasks arranged in this order are very effective,
                     since it is an orderly process, which builds learning on
                     learning and adds realism to the training.
                     Psychological order – This method of sequencing arranges
                     the training content based on the ease of learning. Students
                     are taught easier tasks first, and then the more complex tasks
                     are taught. This method also includes the process of going
                     from what students already know and proceeds to new
                     information.

Sequencing              Logical order – Normally, training activities should be
training                designed to proceed from the simple to the complex or from
(Continued)             known to unknown. However, training activities will not
                        always lend themselves to this design method. In such a
                        case, training activities may be designed using both perfor-
                        mance and psychological order. This arrangement normally
                        includes the whole-part-whole concept.


Guidelines for       Various sequencing methods can be used to design training
sequencing           activities based on training content and resource availability.
                     When selecting methods, consider doing the following:

                        Place easily learned objectives early in the training sequence.
                        Provide common or "core" training early in the training
                        sequence.
                        Sequence sub-objectives with the objective they support.
                        Place skills and procedures within each objective in job order
                        when possible.
                        Introduce concepts at the point where understanding the
                        concepts is a prerequisite for successful performance.
                        Provide prerequisite skills training before the time it is required
                        for the job.
                        Introduce skill or knowledge in the task where it is most likely
                        or frequently used.
                        Provide practice of skills and concepts in areas where transfer
                        of like or related skills is not likely to occur.
                        Place complex and cumulative skills later in the training
                        sequence.


Optimum size of      There are no hard and fast rules on the proper size or increment
training unit        of training. There is a natural tendency to play it safe and provide
                     more training than is necessary. This costs valuable resources
                     and normally causes boredom on the part of the student. A good
                     approach to designing the size or increment of training is to start
                     with minimal training and rely on validation to show if more
                     training is needed. This method, combined with evaluation
                     feedback, will indicate if more training is required. If you provide
                     more training than is necessary in the beginning, it will be difficult
                     to determine until feedback is received from the field.

                                       Select Media

Introduction        Although selection of training methods and selection of media are
                    discussed individually, they can't always be considered
                    separately. No single medium is the most appropriate choice for
                    every training situation. A proper medium ensures that
                    information is presented to the students by the most effective and
                    efficient means possible. Note: As a reminder, the media
                    selected for the training system have a direct impact on
                    resources such as personnel, facilities, and funds that were
                    identified during the planning stage of the ISD project.


Definition          Media are the means, instruments, or materials used to
                    communicate information–in other words, the means used to give
                    information to the students. Examples of media include
                    classroom instructor, study guides, CBT, satellite training,
                    interactive video, or numerous other types of media.


Types of media      There are several types of training media, as shown below.

of media               unsuitable for particular training situations. Consider these
                       characteristics carefully to ensure that the appropriate medium is
                       selected for the training system. The following table lists the

                    a professional narrator; hence, they are not "easy" to prepare or
                    revise.

35-mm slide series   Advantages
                     1. Require only filming, with processing and mounting by film
                        laboratory.
                     2. Result in colorful, realistic reproductions of original subjects.
                     3. Prepared with any 35-mm camera for most uses.
                     4. Easily revised and updated.
                     5. Easily handled, stored, and rearranged for various uses.
                     6. Increased usefulness with tray storage and remote control by
                        presenter.
                     7. Can be combined with tape narration for greater
                        effectiveness.
                     8. May be adapted to group or to individual use.

                     Limitations
                     1. Require some skill in photography.
                     2. Require special equipment for close-up photography and
                        copying.
                     3. Can get out of sequence and be projected incorrectly if slides
                        are handled individually.


Multimedia           Advantages
                     1. Can demand attention and create strong emotional impact on
                        viewers and/or users.
                     2. Condenses time and materials required to upgrade skills by
                        using a number of training technologies.
                     3. Effects rapid skill transfers by providing the ability to
                        implement changes to meet new or revised training
                        requirements.
                     4. Computer-based multimedia manages feedback and
                        evaluation by tracking information as the user interacts with
                        the media.
                     5. Computer-based multimedia presents information in different
                        content formats such as motion video, audio, still images,
                        graphics, animation, text, etc.

                     Limitations
                     1. Require additional equipment, complex setup, and careful
                        coordination during planning, preparation, and use.
                     2. Equipment and production costs may be high for complex
                        programs.

Video and film        Advantages
                      1. Particularly useful in describing motion, showing
                         relationships, and giving impact to topic.
                      2. Allow instant replay of video recording.
                      3. Videotape is reusable.
                      4. Easy to record lip sync on videotape.
                      5. May include special filming techniques (animation, time-laps).
                      6. Combine still and motion on videodisc.
                      7. Standardized film projector available everywhere.

                      4. Incompatibility of particular video format types.
                      5. Value of investment in motion picture equipment reduced as
                         video replaces film.

                      Note – Videotape and videodisc are fast replacing 16mm film
                      medium.


Interactive           Advantages
Courseware (ICW)      1. Presents text information and graphic images.
                      2. Interacts with learners on individual basis through asking
                         questions and judging responses.
                      3. Maintains record of responses.

Guidelines for       Several guidelines for media selection are:
selecting media
                        Select media that do not conflict with the specific training
                        environment.
                        Select media that effectively meet the training objectives.
                        Select media that support the training strategy.
                        Select media that allow individualization of training to the
                        greatest extent possible.
                        Select media with development time, know-how, and dollar
                        resources in mind.
                        Select media that are effective and cost-efficient.


Media selection      Most types of complex skills involve multiple objectives from
for integrated       different domains of learning. A skill that involves two or more
activities           objectives from different learning domains involves integrated
                     learning activities. Media selection for integrated learning
                     activities must take into consideration the enterprise and the
                     learner's schema, metaskills, and experience.

                        Enterprise. An enterprise is an integrated, purposeful activity
                        that usually leads to accomplishment of a goal. For example,
                        an individual might have an enterprise to build and fly an
                        airplane. An individual does not have to have all the
                        prerequisite skills to engage in an enterprise. The importance
                        of an enterprise is that it is purposeful and relevant to the
                        learner. This motivates the learning behavior necessary to
                        complete the component tasks.

                        Schemas. A schema is an individual's organization of
                        knowledge. Schemas may take the form of scripts (a kind of
                        story or scenario that organizes information) or frames (a
                        structure that looks like a table or matrix into which
                        information fits). Different levels of learners have different
                        types of schemas. A novice learner (in a particular subject
                        area) has a very sketchy schema or structure into which new
                        information can be placed. An experienced learner (one who
                        has had some training in a subject area) has a better structure
                        and therefore is a quicker learner than the novice. Finally, an
                        expert has a very highly developed schema and is probably
                        capable of rapid learning with very little learning support.
AFH 36-2235       Volume 8       1 November 2002                                     143



Media selection      These are simple definitions of 'enterprise' and 'schema,' and
for integrated       address little about how this effects media selection. Enterprise
activities           and schema are more concerned with sequencing and whole-
(Continued)          task practice than with media.

                        Metaskills. Metaskills are cognitive strategies that an
                        individual applies to the processing of new information in a
                        novel situation (a scenario not previously experienced).
                        These skills include chunking or organizing new information,
                        recalling relevant schemas, adding the new information to the
                        old schemas, and creating new schemas. Although metaskills
                        are probably subject-independent, different individuals have
                        different metaskill capabilities depending upon their
                        experience with a particular subject content. For example, an
                        expert has developed metaskills and can relate better to a
                        novel situation than a novice. An expert is more efficient at
                        processing new information and applying it to the novel
                        situation.

                        Learner Experience. It is helpful to know how experienced a
                        learner is when selecting media or teaching strategies. The
                        more experience, the higher the level of metaskills and
                        strategies the learner will be able to employ. Experienced
                        learners can deal with larger steps of instruction and more
                        complex learning environments. Novices, on the other hand,
                        require simplification of complex contexts so they don't
                        experience information overload while learning.

                               Section G
                   Update Training Development Plan

Introduction      The training development plan that was developed during initial
                  ISD project planning may have already been updated during the
                  analysis phase. This plan, which serves as the roadmap for
                  training development, may also need to be updated at the end of
                  the design phase if there have been changes that impact it. If the
                  plan is to be an effective tool for managing training development
                  and implementation, it will need to be periodically updated.


Why update        The training development plan should be updated at the end of
the plan?         the design phase, as applicable; to reflect any changes that
                  impact the training development process resulting from the
                  activities in the design phase. If the training development plan is
                  not updated, it will not be an effective tool for managing the
                  training development process.


Who is            Keeping the training development plan updated with current and
responsible?      accurate information is the responsibility of the curriculum
                  developers. They should update the plan at the end of the design
                  phase, as applicable.


What should       At the end of the design phase, the training development plan
be updated?       should be updated with new or revised information, such as:

                     Changes to the overall training development
                     Refinements to project definition
                     Revisions to the resource requirements
                     Changes in resource constraints
                     New or revised milestones
                     Addition or deletion of tasking

                                         Overview

Introduction          Once the objectives and tests have been developed and training
                      strategies and activities have been selected, you are ready to
                      implement your design in the development phase. Some of the
                      tasks in this phase include writing training materials, producing
                      training media, and developing ICW. As a curriculum developer,
                      this is where all your efforts from the earlier phases of ISD start to
                      come together.

                                    Course Syllabus

Introduction          A course syllabus is a blueprint for conducting training in a given
                      course. In some training organizations, a Plan of Instruction
                      (POI) is used for the same purpose; in DoD Inst. 29612, it is
                      called the Course Control Document.


Purpose               A course syllabus is used to standardize training and control its
                      quality. Additionally, the syllabus allows training and support
                      managers to plan resources such as aircraft, fuel, bombs and
                      ranges.


Who is                Training managers have the ultimate responsibility while
responsible?          curriculum developers are responsible for preparing the course
                      syllabus. They are also responsible for keeping it current and
                      accurate.


What is in the        Since aircrew operational training affects so many different USAF
course syllabus?      agencies, a standardized model for the syllabuses is required and
                      is shown below.

                          Other Syllabus-Related Documents

Introduction           The syllabus is a control document for managers of the training
                       program. Other syllabus-related documents that support training
                       are developed by curriculum developers and are used by the
                       instructor and students.


Who is                 Curriculum developers are responsible for ensuring that each
responsible?           component or related document is available to support the
                       training program.


Types of related       There are many syllabus-related documents that support the
documents              various aircrew-training programs. Some programs may have
                       requirements for specific syllabus-related documents that other
                       programs do not need. Several syllabus-related documents that
                       every aircrew program will likely need are:

                          Instructor guide
                          Student study guide
                          Phase manual
                          Mission guides

                       A brief description of the above-mentioned documents is provided
                       below.


Instructor guide       The instructor guide is the lesson plan that instructors use to
                       present the material to the students. It can be written as a
                       narrative, an outline, or both. A narrative is an aid for the new or
                       substitute instructor or for material that is not presented often
                       enough for the instructor to maintain proficiency. Instructors who
                       are proficient with the instructor guide in the narrative form may
                       choose to use only the outline.

                       The parts of the instructor guide may vary in presentation order
                       but it normally contains the:

                          Introduction – motivation, preview, review (perhaps a war
                          story)
AFH 36-2235        Volume 8       1 November 2002                                       155



Instructor guide          Presentation – material presented with spot summaries and
(Continued)               transitions
                          Summary – summary of what was just presented
                          Instructor Guidance – information on what students will be
                          doing next, i.e., test or quiz, reading assignment and next
                          class assignment

                       The format of the instructor guide may change as a result of
                       validation or to meet the training need.


Student study guide    The student study guide can be presented in any format that
                       provides assistance about the material to be covered. The
                       objectives are given to the students so they will know what is
                       expected of them. The format of the student study guide may
                       change as a result of validation or to meet the training need.


Phase manual           The Dash One and other TOs may confirm all the information the
                       students need but they are often written at a level that may be
                       difficult for new students. Thus, phase manuals are developed to
                       extrapolate the information for specific areas of flying. Phase
                       manuals are normally segmented into:

                         Conversion or transition
                         Air to air
                         Air to surface

                       These manuals must be technically correct and will normally
                       require coordination with the operational flying manager to ensure
                       accuracy.


Mission guides         Mission guides may be developed for each flying event. They
                       identify:

                         Strategy for the mission
                         What support is needed
                         Type of instructor required, if any
AFH 36-2235      Volume 8      1 November 2002                                       156



Mission guides         Routes to be taken
(Continued)            Goals of the mission
                       Number and types of bombs, bullets, or others

                     The mission guide can be included in the syllabus (Chapters 4
                     and 5) or can be developed as a separate document.


Format guide         Perhaps the most important requirement for syllabus-related
                     documents is consistency within the training program. All
                     instructor guides, student study guides, phase manuals and
                     mission guides should follow a predetermined format. A format
                     or style guide is a good way to ensure that all developers are
                     providing professional-looking products that are effective and
                     cost-efficient.

                                       Section B
                               Develop Training Materials

Introduction           In the design phase, the training method and medium best suited
                       for the training need were selected. At this point, you are ready
                       to start developing the medium to implement the training design.
                       Developing training materials is a time-consuming and exacting
                       task regardless of the medium you use. It is essential that a
                       quality medium be developed, since it is the vehicle that carries to
                       the students the information that is to be learned.


Description            Media are the means, instrument, or material used to
                       communicate information to the student. Examples of media
                       range from the classroom instructor using a lesson plan to study
                       guides, CBT, satellite training, interactive video, or numerous
                       other types.


Types of training      Training can be delivered using media such as:
materials
                           Instructor
                           Print-based
                           Slide/tape
                           Audio/video tapes
                           CBT
                           Interactive video
                           Training devices/aids
                           Satellite (i.e., distance learning)


Factors in media       Several factors affect the development of training media and
development            materials. The relative importance of each of these factors
                       depends on the medium selected. These factors are:

                          Development personnel required
                          Development time required
                          Development cost required
AFH 36-2235    Volume 8        1 November 2002                                        158



Development       Training material development requires many activities. The type
activities        and number of activities depend upon the type of training
                  materials being developed. Some of the most common
                  development activities are listed below.

                          Medium                        Development Activity
                  Print                          Draft/write material
                                                 Edit material
                                                 Publish material
                  Transparencies                 Draft transparency
                                                 Generate reproducible transparency

                                  Section C
                         Develop Training Alternatives

Introduction         In the design phase, training alternatives were selected to
                     support the primary training delivery method, as applicable. If
                     training alternatives were selected in the previous phase, the
                     alternatives will need to be developed in this phase just as the
                     primary training is developed.


Purpose              The purpose of developing alternative training is to ensure that
                     there is a "back-up" system ready to support the training system
                     by delivering critical training in the event the primary delivery
                     system is unavailable or not usable.


Who is               Curriculum developers are responsible for developing alternative

               Install Training Information Management System

Introduction         As a curriculum developer, you may never be involved in
                     designing or redesigning a training information management
                     system. However, you may be involved in the installation. This
                     section discusses the basic issues of installing a training
                     information management system.


Who is               A project manager normally has overall responsibility for installing
responsible?         a new training information management system, revising an
                     existing system, or modifying the software of an existing system.
                     Many individuals from various training organizations will likely be
                     involved in testing the system. For example, an instructor may be
                     asked to update student records and a curriculum developer may
                     be asked to update training materials in the system.


What should you      If you are involved in installing or testing a training information
look for?            management system there are several questions you should
                     consider.

                        Is the hardware user-friendly?
                        Is the software user-friendly?
                        Are there adequate terminals for all system users to do their
                        jobs in a timely manner?
                        Is the information management in your area accurate?
                        Is the information management in your area complete?
                        Is the system reliable?

                              Update ISD Evaluation Plan

Introduction          An evaluation plan is the "metric" or standard for evaluating the
                      ISD process and products. It is developed initially in the planning
                      stage and is updated in the analysis and design phases. To
                      ensure that the ISD evaluation plan is effective throughout the life
                      cycle of the project, you need to update it again in the
                      development phase.


Why update the        In order to have an evaluation tool that is effective throughout the
evaluation plan?      life cycle of the system, you will need to keep the plan updated. It
                      should be maintained current and accurate to reflect the actual
                      status of the evaluation effort. Updating the plan will keep the
                      development effort on track and ensure quality.


Who is                Curriculum developers are responsible for keeping the evaluation
responsible?          plan updated, while management within the training organization
                      is responsible for ensuring that the plan is effective and that it is
                      implemented.


Tasks involved        An ISD evaluation plan should be updated at the conclusion of
                      each ISD phase if significant changes have occurred during the
                      process. Updating an evaluation plan involves the following
                      tasks.

                         Document changes such as:

                               Development products to be evaluated such as training
                               materials, lesson plans, and ICW

                         Revise the evaluation schedule, including:

                               Quantity of products to be evaluated
                               When the development process and products will be

                                 Section F
                     Update Training Development Plan

Introduction        The training development plan is the "blueprint" for managing the
                    training development process. It is important for you, as a
                    curriculum developer, to have a blueprint of how it all fits together
                    as a training system. The plan is a valuable management tool for
                    you, as well as for managers in the training organization.


Why update the      Updating the training development plan at the end of the
plan?               development phase ensures that it will remain an effective tool for
                    managing the training system. Update the plan as necessary to
                    reflect the most current status of training system development.


Who is              Keeping the training development plan updated is the
responsible?        responsibility of the curriculum developer. Training organization
                    management has the overall responsibility for ensuring that
                    development of the training system is documented in the plan
                    and the plan reflects the current status.


What should be      At the end of the development phase, the plan should be updated
updated?            to include new or revised information, such as:

                       Changes to training development strategy
                       New or revised milestones resulting from the development

                               Finalize Training Materials

Introduction           After you have validated the training, you are ready to finalize the
                       training materials. During this step, you make sure that all
                       necessary changes are made to the training materials and they
                       are ready for implementation.


Purpose                The purpose of finalizing training materials is to ensure that they:

                          Have been revised to include the most current and accurate
                          information
                          Are complete
                          Are ready for training implementation


Who is                 Curriculum developers and instructors are responsible for
responsible?           finalizing training materials and ensuring that they are ready for
                       implementation.


What needs to be       When updating finalized training materials, you should update:

Introduction          At this point in the ISD process, the course has been validated
                      and you are ready to implement the training. As the curriculum
                      developer, you need to ensure that everything is ready to support
                      implementation prior to actually implementing the training. That
                      is, the system functions are in place, adequate resources are
                      available, the training system itself is ready, and you are
                      prepared to continue the evaluation process.


Where are you in      An ISD model, with the implementation phase highlighted, is
the process?          presented in Figure 13 to help visualize the process.

Introduction       It is unlikely that you, as a curriculum developer, will ever be
                   required to implement the training system functions. These
                   functions were probably put in place when the training
                   organization was established. Your job, along with developing
                   training, will be to ensure that these functions are being
                   performed and to clearly understand how the system functions
                   interface with the training system in order to support, operate, and
                   maintain training courses. The four system functions are
                   management, administration, delivery, and support.

                                Management Function

Introduction         The management function is a key training system function.
                     The management function involves managing the entire training
                     system, including management of the training development
                     process and the day-to-day operation of the system. It is
                     essential that it be in place and working if the training system is to
                     be operated effectively and adequately maintained. Lack of
                     effective management can result in failure of the training system.


Definition           The management function is the practice of directing and
                     controlling all aspects of the training system from initial project
                     planning to the day-to-day operation of the system.


Who is               Organizational management has the overall responsibility for
responsible?         seeing that the management function is in place and carried out
                     in support of the training system. However, some activities may
                     be delegated to the curriculum developer.


Management           Activities within the training system management function are:
activities
                        Planning for the design, development, delivery, support,
                        operation, and maintenance of the training system.
                        Organizing resources, which includes identifying, arranging,
                        and bringing together resources required for the training
                        system, such as personnel, equipment, and facilities.
                        Coordinating activities between training and support
                        organizations, such as civil engineering, resource
                        management, and audiovisual services.
                        Evaluating the effectiveness and efficiency of each element
                        of the project, such as personnel, budget, production, and
                        graduates' performance.
                        Reporting project status to organizational management or
                        Headquarters (HQ).


Relationship to      Every aspect of the training system depends on the system
implementation       management function. All of its planning, organizing,
                     coordinating, evaluating, and reporting activities work toward
                     successful implementation of a training program. Without this
                     function, the system would be ineffective and inefficient.
AFH 36-2235        Volume 8       1 November 2002                                     173



                                   Support Function

Introduction          The importance of the support function in the training system
                      cannot be overstressed. In most cases, you will find that the
                      support function already exists within the base or training
                      organization. Although the support function may already be
                      established, each time a training system is developed, the support
                      requirements for that specific course must be established to
                      ensure that adequate support is available to support the system.


Definition            The support function can be defined as those long-range as well
                      as day-to-day tasks performed by organizations in support of the
                      training system. Examples of support functions are:

                         Maintain equipment and facilities.
                         Supply materials for the courses.
                         Provide services such as audiovisual or publication.


Who is                As with the other training system functions, organizational
responsible?          management has the overall responsibility for ensuring that the
                      training systems within the organization are adequately
                      supported. Curriculum developers must identify to management
                      any lack of support for their training systems.


Examples of           Base organizations perform many tasks in support of the training
training support      system. Examples of some of the organizations and the tasks
tasks                 they perform are listed below.

                      Civil Engineering
                         Constructs training and support facilities such as classrooms.
                         Modifies existing facilities, such as adding new electrical
                         outlets, air conditioning.

                      Resource Management
                        Provides personnel such as instructors, computer
                        programmers, and graphic artists.
                        Manages training and support equipment.
                        Provides funding for day-to-day operation.

Examples of           Information Management
training support         Edits training material, such as student workbooks, student
tasks                    study guides.
(Continued)              Produces training material, such as student handbooks,
                         course syllabuses.

                      Contracting or Contractor Logistic Support (CLS)
                        Develops contracts for maintenance and other services.
                        Processes local purchase forms to procure equipment,
                        supplies.

                      Visual Information
                         Develops and controls visual material such as slides,
                         filmstrips, video.
                         Manages visual equipment, such as televisions, VCRs, slide
                         projectors.


Relationship to       Implementing a training system requires planning and
implementation        preparation. A part of that effort is to ensure that the support
                      functions are in place and ready to support the system. Every
                      training system component requires some type of support or
                      maintenance in order to effectively contribute to the training
                      system.
AFH 36-2235       Volume 8       1 November 2002                                        175



                               Administration Function

Introduction         Often overlooked, the administration function plays a vital role
                     in the day-to-day operation of a training system. You may not be
                     directly involved in any of the administrative activities, but you
                     should still be aware of what is being done by other organizations
                     to support and maintain the training system.


Definition           Administration is the part of management that performs day-to-
                     day tasks such as typing support, personnel schedules, and
                     student records.


Who is               Organizational management has the overall responsibility for
responsible?         ensuring that the organization has an active administration
                     function to support the training system. However, curriculum
                     developers have the responsibility for ensuring that each of the
                     courses they are responsible for receives adequate support.


Administration       Administration activities include items such as:
activities
                        Providing documents such as course syllabuses, instructor
                        and student materials.
                        Maintaining personnel, training, and equipment records.
                        Typing reports, letters, and messages.
                        Administering student support, which includes tasks such
                        as processing student records, mailing courses to students.
                        Administering staff support tasks such as leave processing,
                        preparation and maintenance of personnel records, and ad-
                        ministration of personnel programs.
                        Scheduling resources such as scheduling students for
                        classes and establishing equipment utilization schedules.
                        Tracking students and equipment.


Relationship to      The training system administration function must be in place
implementation       before you can successfully implement a training system. For
                     example, training materials must be produced and available,
                     reports typed, exportable courses mailed, and student records
                     updated.

                                 Remember, you always need administrative
                                     support for your training system.
AFH 36-2235       Volume 8       1 November 2002                                         176



                                  Delivery Function

Introduction         As curriculum developers designed the training system, special
                     care was taken to ensure that the appropriate delivery method
                     was selected for the course. Now that the system is ready to
                     implement, they must ensure that the delivery function is ready to
                     support the system. The delivery function, like the other two
                     functions that have been discussed, is also critical to the training
                     system.


Definition           The delivery function is defined as the means or methods by
                     which training is provided to the students. Examples of delivery
                     include:

                        Instructors
                        Computers, which include ICW, CAI, or CMI
                        Training devices including simulators, part-task trainers, and
                        mock-ups
                        Satellite
                        Programmed text
                        Exportable courses
                        Job aids


Who is               Within a training organization, there are several individuals

Introduction       To this point, organizational management has spent considerable
                   time planning the training system, securing resources, managing
                   the training development process, and arranging for system
                   support. Curriculum developers have analyzed the tasks,
                   designed the training system, and developed and validated the
                   training. Now the course is ready to implement. During
                   implementation, management continues to plan and manage the
                   training system while the curriculum developers provide the
                   training and continually evaluate its effectiveness.

                    Preparations for Conducting Training

Introduction      Although preparations for conducting training started in the initial
                  planning and have continued throughout the analysis, design,
                  and development phases of ISD, final preparations need to be
                  made prior to implementing the course. Adequate preparation is
                  essential to successful training.


Why prepare?      Adequate preparations contribute to the overall success of a
                  training program, while inadequate preparation can result in its
                  complete failure.


Who is            Everyone involved in the support, operation, and maintenance of
responsible?      a training system shares some of the responsibility for making
                  last-minute preparation to implement the training system. For
                  example:

                     Instructors must ensure that:

                          Classrooms are ready.
                          Training materials are available in adequate quantities.
                          All equipment is available and operational.

                     Curriculum developers must ensure that:

                          Course syllabuses are complete.
                          Exportable training packages are ready.

                     Organizational managers must ensure that:

                          Resources are available and ready for implementation
                          (i.e., equipment, facilities, and personnel).
                          Training system functions are ready to support
                          implementation.
                          Instructors have been trained and certified.

                     Support organization must ensure that:

                          Support and services are available to support
                          implementation of training.
AFH 36-2235       Volume 8      1 November 2002                                         179



When should you      Throughout this handbook, adequate planning and preparation
prepare?             have been a constant theme. However, at this point, the focus is
                     on the last-minute preparations that may be required before the
                     training is implemented. If possible, before the training is
                     implemented, check each component of the training system to
                     make sure everything is ready.


What should be       The type of training system being implemented will determine
checked?             what should be done to get ready to implement the training. For
                     example, an exportable course will not have the same items to be
                     checked as a course taught in a classroom environment. Some
                     of the last-minute preparations may include checking to ensure
                     the following:

                         Equipment
                            Training and support equipment is available in adequate
                            numbers and in operational condition.
                            Equipment support, such as maintenance, is available.

                        Facilities
                            Training and support facilities are available.
                            Any facility modifications such as electrical and air

                            Is a "back-up" system available if the primary system is
                            unavailable or not usable?

                        Personnel
                            Personnel are available, including qualified instructors,
                            administrative and maintenance personnel.
                            Students have been scheduled for the classes.

                        Money
                           Adequate funds are available to meet implementation
                           costs and the costs associated with the daily operation of
                           the course.

                              Conducting Training

Introduction      If adequate preparations have been made throughout the training
                  development process and a last minute check of each training
                  system component was made, there should be few problems, if
                  any, encountered when implementing the training. However,
                  conducting the training remains a critical phase of ISD.


Why conduct       The purpose of conducting training is to impart the necessary
training?         skills, knowledge, and attitudes required for the graduate to
                  meet job performance requirements.


Who is            There are many individuals and organizations directly or indirectly
responsible?      involved in conducting training. Each has the responsibility for
                  performing their respective tasks. For example:

                     Organizational managers have the overall responsibility for
                     the daily operation of a training system. This responsibility
                     includes managing the support, operation, and maintenance of
                     the system.

                     Support organizations have the responsibility of providing
                     the necessary logistic support and services to support,
                     operate, and maintain the system.

                     Curriculum developers have the responsibility for designing
                     and developing the training and continuously evaluating its
                     effectiveness and correcting identified deficiencies, as
                     applicable.
AFH 36-2235      Volume 8       1 November 2002                                           182



Conducting the      Once the training is implemented and becomes operational, it will
training            normally remain so until there is no longer a need for the training.
                    When conducting training, the focus is on conducting effective
                    and efficient training that produces graduates who can meet job
                    performance requirements. During the operation of the training
                    system, ongoing activities ensure system integrity, as listed
                    below.

                       Resource management is probably the single most critical
                       issue for training organization management as well as
                       curriculum developers. Resources must be well managed to
                       gain maximum benefit.

                       Staff development is an activity that goes on continually while
                       training is being conducted. Curriculum developers as well as
                       other training staff should periodically attend courses that help
                       them develop professionally in curriculum development.

                       Conducting training is the center of system integrity. No
                       matter what has been done to this point, the training system
                       can fail or be rendered ineffective or inefficient if the training is
                       not properly conducted. Some items that are helpful to
                       remember when conducting training are:

                            Training should always be student-centered.
                            Training should always follow the course syllabus.
                            Curriculum developers or instructors must always perform
                            professionally in the teaching/learning environment.
                            Training staff should be qualified to perform their duties.

                            Evaluation maintains the quality of training
                            implementation. During the conduct of training,
                            operational evaluation is continually performed to
                            ensure the quality of a training program. It is covered in
                            detail in the next chapter of this handbook.

                     Conduct Operational Evaluation

Introduction       After the formative and summative evaluations have been
                   completed, and the system functions are in place, the
                   instructional system is ready for implementation. Once the
                   system is implemented and starts producing graduates, it's time
                   to begin conducting operational evaluation. Operational
                   evaluation is a continuous process that assesses how well course
                   graduates are meeting the established job performance
                   requirements.


Objectives         The objectives of this chapter are to:

                      Analyze the operational evaluation process.
                      Plan and execute internal evaluation.

                             Operational Evaluation

Introduction       Evaluation is a continuous activity that is integrated throughout
                   each stage of ISD, beginning with analysis and continuing
                   throughout the life cycle of the system. It focuses on quality
                   improvement and the graduate's ability to meet job performance
                   requirements. The last stage of the evaluation process is
                   operational evaluation.


Definition         Operational evaluation is the process of gathering and analyzing
                   internal and external feedback data to ensure that the system
                   continues to effectively and cost-efficiently produce graduates
                   who meet established requirements. It is a quality improvement
                   activity.


Purpose            The two main purposes of operational evaluation are to:

                      Ensure that graduates continue to meet established job
                      performance requirements.
                      Continually improve system quality.


What should        When evaluating, look for both strengths and weaknesses in the
you look for?      system. Focus on:

                      How well graduates are meeting job performance
                      requirements.
                      Whether unneeded training is being provided.
                      Whether any needed training is not being provided.
                      How well each system component is contributing to overall
                      system quality.
                      Ways to improve the graduate's performance as well as the
                      system.

                                  Internal Evaluation

Introduction         Internal evaluation activities begin with implementation of the
                     training system and continue throughout the life cycle of the
                     training system. Some organizations call this evaluation activity a
                     "course review." Internal evaluations look at the instructional
                     system from within to determine system effectiveness and quality.


Definition           Internal evaluation is the acquisition and analysis of internal
                     feedback and management data, such as test data, student
                     critiques, instructor comments, and data correlation from within
                     the training system.


Purpose              The purpose of internal evaluation is to improve the effectiveness
                     and quality of the training system.


Possible causes      Although training systems are validated prior to implementation,
for problems         students may still have difficulty with the training during day-to-
                     day system operation. Possible causes of problems are:

                        Instructors do not follow the course syllabus.
                        The developed course is different from the course that is
                        actually implemented.
                        Resources required to support, operate, and maintain the
                        system are inadequate.
                        Training materials are not correlated.
                        Students do not meet course requisites.

                     Periodic internal evaluations will identify weaknesses (problems)
                     as well as strengths of the training system. Internal evaluations
                     should be conducted with sufficient frequency to ensure the
                     quality of the training system. For example, a mature course that
                     is seldom changed would not likely require an internal evaluation
                     as often as a course that is constantly being updated or revised.
                     Some training organizations conduct internal evaluations annually
                     on all courses, regardless of their status.

Review Resources         To determine if resources are available and adequate:
                              Facilities (training and support).
                              Equipment (training, support, and test) and supplies.
                              Personnel (curriculum developers, instructors, students).
                              Time (course length, sufficient time to maintain course).
Visit Training           To evaluate the quality of implemented training (ensure that
Facilities               the visit is long enough to observe representative instruction).
                         To check equipment, training media, training aids and devices
                         for condition, operation, and appropriateness.
                         To check training literature such as study guides and
                         workbooks for quality and availability.
Evaluate Instructor      To check if instructor:
Performance                   Follows the syllabus, uses training media properly,
                              responds to student needs, and is qualified to teach.
                              Noted weaknesses on the evaluation forms and if they
                              have been corrected.
Evaluate Student         To determine if students are meeting standards.
Performance              To monitor flying and simulator missions.
Monitor                  To ensure quality.
Measurement              To check the measurement program for compromise. If a test
Program                  has been compromised, it cannot provide useful feedback.
                         Evaluate training in terms of student performance. Use
                         performance measures to determine students' achievement of
                         objectives.

Data analysis      Before beginning analysis of the data, ensure that:

                      Data has been collected from each component of the training
                      system.
                      Adequate data samples are collected in order to validate the
                      reliability of the findings.

                   Following are some methods of analyzing the internal evaluation
                   data.

                      Compare the training standard with the course syllabus to
                      determine if the requirements of the standard are being met.
                      Compare course syllabus with operational course to
                      determine if the planned and operational courses are the
                      same.
                      Review course syllabus, lesson plan, and training material to
                      determine if they are current, adequate, and in agreement.
                      Compare stated resource requirements with actual resources
                      to determine if adequate resources are available to support,
                      operate, and maintain the training system.
                      Review records to determine if instructors are qualified to
                      teach the course.
                      Review test data to ensure that students are meeting course
                      objectives.
                      Analyze test data to determine if test items are valid and
                      reliable.
                      Review grade sheets to ensure that students are performing
                      to standards (check instructor's comments).
                      Review failed rides report for indications of a problem and
                      whether problem is related to academics, trainers, flying
                      missions or the student's inability or unwillingness to complete
                      the course. This may require an investigation of the student's
                      grade book and interviews with instructors.
AFH 36-2235       Volume 8       1 November 2002                                        192



Revising the         After internal evaluation data is collected and analyzed, the next
training system      stage is to correct deficiencies in the training system. If revisions
                     can be made to correct identified problems, they should be made
                     in a timely manner in order to receive the greatest benefit from
                     the changes.

                     Revisions resulting from the analysis may require reentry into an
                     earlier phase of the ISD process to correct the problem(s). The
                     need to reenter an earlier phase of ISD is determined by the
                     nature and scope of the revision. For example, changing a test
                     item or adding time to a unit of training would not require reentry.
                     However, adding a new piece of equipment to the course would
                     more than likely require you to do so.

                     Section D in this chapter discusses revising courseware.

                                    External Evaluation

Introduction         How well graduates meet job performance requirements is
                     learned through external evaluation. This evaluation activity
                     relies on input from the field to determine how well graduates are
                     performing.


Definition           External (field) evaluation is the process of gathering and
                     analyzing data from outside the training environment in order to
                     determine how well recent graduates are meeting job
                     performance requirements.


Purpose              The purpose of external evaluation is to determine if recent
                     graduates of the course:
                        Can meet job performance requirements.
                        Need all of the training they received.
                        Need any training they did not receive.


Possible causes      Some possible problems that may be identified during external
for problems         evaluations are:
                        Criterion test did not measure graduates' ability to meet job
                        performance requirements.
                        Objectives do not reflect job performance requirements.
                        Job performance requirements were incorrectly identified
                        during task analysis.
                        Job performance requirements changed after task analysis.
                        Sequence of training did not take into account the task decay
                        rate.


Collecting data      Several methods of collecting external evaluation are listed
                     below.

                                  Questionnaires

Introduction       Questionnaires are effective, cost-efficient evaluation tools. The
                   discussion on questionnaires will focus on:

                      Advantages and disadvantages of questionnaires
                      Types of questionnaires
                      How to prepare and distribute questionnaires
                      Analysis of data gathered using questionnaires


Purpose            The purpose of using questionnaires is to:

                      Determine the ability of recent graduates to perform specific
                      tasks on which they received training.
                      Identify the specific nature of any deficiency.
                      Determine what tasks graduates are actually performing.
                      Identify what training is not needed for on-the-job
                      performance.


Advantages         The advantages of questionnaires are:

                      They are comparatively inexpensive to administer.
                      They can be used to collect large samples of graduate and
                      supervisor data.
                      They yield data that can be easily tabulated and reported.
                      Respondents give their opinions freely.


Disadvantages      Disadvantages of questionnaires include:

                      They may not be the most reliable form of evaluation–data
                      validity depends on preparation and distribution.
                      Communication is one-way–respondent may not understand
                      some of the questions.
                      They may not ask the most relevant questions.
                      They collect only opinions, which may not be as reliable as
                      other methods of collecting external data.
                      Developing effective and reliable questionnaires may be
                      costly and require extensive experience.
                      Low return rates and inappropriate responses affect accuracy.
AFH 36-2235      Volume 8       1 November 2002                                         195



Types of            Two types of questionnaires can be used to collect external
questionnaires      evaluation data.

                       One is for the graduates' immediate supervisor. However,
                       responding may be delegated to the graduates' trainer.
                       The other questionnaire is for the graduates. This
                       questionnaire is designed to find out what graduates think
                       about the training they received.


Preparing           Well-constructed questionnaires that are properly administered
questionnaires      are extremely important to the field evaluation process. The
                    following table identifies the five basic stages of questionnaire
                    development.

(Continued)                         Consider motivational factors when developing
                            4       questionnaires. You want the respondent to
                                    answer fully and conscientiously.
                                    Questionnaires will motivate if you:
                                         Explain the purpose of the questionnaire.
                                         Tell the respondents how they can benefit
                                         from answering the questionnaire.
                                         Write clear and concise instructions.
                                         Make questionnaire format uncluttered and
                                         easy to answer. For example, using boxes
                                         for check marks will make the questionnaire
                                         easier to answer.

                                         Explain how they feel about answering the
                                         questions.
                                    Revise the questionnaire, if necessary, before

                       choose answers from a small number of possibilities. This
                       makes tabulation easy but may not give the range of answers
                       desired.
                       Use open-end questions when you don't know all the possible
                       answers. The respondent will probably suggest possibilities.
                       Word questions to the respondent's level of understanding.
                       Use vocabulary and concepts that are easy for the respondent
                       to understand.
                       Limit each question to one aspect of a topic.

                       Provide space for the respondent's name, title, organization,

                       Number the questionnaires to allow for administrative control.
                       Whenever possible, allow the respondent to use the same
                       type marking for all questions. For example, one of the best
                       methods is to allow use of check marks for responses.
                       Arrange "yes" and "no" responses vertically rather than

Distribution of      Distribution of the questionnaire is a critical aspect of external
questionnaires       evaluation. You just don't pick a few graduates' names and drop
                     a questionnaire in the mail to them. You plan distribution to
                     ensure that the data collected is valid and reliable. When
                     distributing the questionnaire, you should:

                        Decide to whom you are sending the questionnaire–recent
                        graduates, their supervisors, or both. You may collect
                        important information from both.

(Continued)             requirements may vary depending on the major command,
                        geographic location, or organization level. Therefore,
                        questionnaires should be distributed to each area as evenly
                        as possible.

                        Decide when to distribute the questionnaires. Timing is
                        critical. Usually, questionnaires should be sent to the
                        graduates within three to six months after graduation. Beyond
                        six months, it may be impossible to tell whether the graduate
                        learned the skill or knowledge in the course or on the job. If
                        the questionnaire is sent too early, the graduate may not have
                        had time to perform many of the tasks that were taught in the
                        course.

                        Determine how many questionnaires you need to mail out.
                        That decision is based on:

                             Expected response rate.
                             Level of confidence (a statistical consideration which
                             means the size of the sample required for you to be, say,
                             95 percent sure the sample truly represents the larger
                             population). The graduate sampling chart on the following
                             page shows how to determine the number of
                             questionnaires you need based on this consideration.

                        Develop points of contact at the gaining units who can
                        administer the questionnaires and ensure that they are
                        completed and returned.

                     Note: To ensure that sufficient numbers of the questionnaires are
                     returned for analysis, contact nonrespondents and encourage
                     their response.

Distribution of      HOW TO USE THIS TABLE
questionnaires
(Continued)          The table can be used as shown in the following example:

                     Annual course production is 4,000 - 95% confidence level desired.
                     Estimated return rate of usable questionnaires is 85%. From the table,
                     364 usable questionnaires are required. Therefore, this figure should
                     be 85% of the questionnaires to mail out. The number of
                     questionnaires to mail is computed as follows:

                          85% = 364
                         100% X

                         X = 364 x 100 = 404 = number of questionnaires to mail
                               85

                     *   It is recommended that the 95% confidence level be chosen. This
                         is the level commonly used in business decisions.


Data analysis        When a sufficient number of completed questionnaires have been
                     returned, you should begin analyzing the data. In this process,
                     the data is:

                         Compiled
                         Collated
                         Analyzed (data from each command should be analyzed
                         together)

                     Pay special attention to:

                         Notes made by respondents on the questionnaires
                         Answers to supplemental questions that were included in the
                         questionnaire

                     Use with caution any data that contain such obvious errors as:

                         Halo effect – indiscriminate rating of all items positively
                         Central tendency – indiscriminate rating of items in the center
                         of the scale

                     Examine the responses to ensure, insofar as possible, that the
                     information accurately reflects the opinion of the graduates and
                     their supervisors.

Reporting findings   After completing data analysis, the findings should be reported.
                     The report should include information such as:

                        Background information on the course that was evaluated
                        Scope of the evaluation
                        Tasks evaluated
                        Analysis results
                        Recommendations
                        Milestones for corrective actions, if applicable

                     Now that the report is complete, your last action is to distribute
                     the report.

                                    Field Visits

Introduction       Field visits are a very effective method of conducting external
                   evaluations. An evaluator, often assisted by a curriculum
                   developer or instructor, normally conducts them. Ideally, field
                   visits should include specialists who are familiar with the
                   graduates' jobs. However, in most cases this is not possible due
                   to limited TDY funds, scheduling constraints, and number and
                   variety of graduates to be interviewed.


Purpose            The purpose of a field visit is to get first-hand information on the
                   graduates' assignment, utilization, and proficiency on the job, and
                   to validate information gained from other evaluation activities.


Advantages         Advantages of field visits are:

                      Guidance and information about the evaluation is given
                      directly to graduates and supervisors.
                      Information is gathered first-hand by the evaluator. Any
                      questions or assumptions can be clarified.
                      Field visits help validate questionnaire data.
                      External evaluations build rapport between the training activity
                      and the user.
                      Additional information can be gained by observing nonverbal
                      messages and asking leading or probing questions.


Disadvantages         Disadvantages of field visits are:

                      They are time-consuming. Travel to several different bases
                      requires considerable time. Interviews and observations also
                      require a lot of time if they are done correctly.
                      The sample is limited. Since the evaluator only visits a few
                      bases, the number of interviews and observations conducted
                      is limited.
AFH 36-2235         Volume 8       1 November 2002                                         204



Disadvantages             The cost is high. Field visits require evaluators to spend
(Continued)               limited TDY funds to travel to the various bases.
                          Information gathered by the evaluator can be subjective and
                          biased.
                          Graduates may feel they are being scrutinized.
                          Evaluators are not always skilled at interview and observation.


Data collection        Two methods of collecting data are:

                          Interviews
                          Observations

                       Evaluators should interview recent graduates and their
                       supervisors and observe the graduates' on-the-job performance
                       when possible. However, observations are almost useless
                       unless the observer is familiar with the tasks being performed.


Preparing for the      Visits to the field to collect evaluation data should be adequately
field visit            planned. Adequate planning will ensure that useful data is
                       gathered. To prepare for the visit, you should:

                          Develop a list of questions to get honest, pertinent answers
                          and keep the discussion focused.
                          Determine the bases to be visited.
                          Establish the schedule for the visit.
                          Select the individuals to be interviewed and observed.


Conducting field       Tasks to be performed during the field visit are:
visits
                          Inform graduates and supervisors of the purpose of the visit.
                          Tell them that their answers will furnish valuable information
                          for improving the training.
                          Interview the recent graduates and their supervisors.
                          Supervisors should know how well the graduate has
                          performed on the job.
                          Determine the graduates' proficiency.
                          Determine how the skills learned during training are being
                          used.

visits (Continued)         Guide the interviews with your list of questions. (As the
                           interview progresses, you may need to add, delete, or revise
                           questions.)
                           Take accurate and complete notes, especially on information
                           that is freely given.
                           Have the supervisor rate the graduates' performance.
                           Observe graduates perform tasks. This may not be possible if
                           the evaluator does not have job or task knowledge. Take
                           careful notes on the performance. After the task has been
                           completed, ask questions to clarify any of the actions taken by
                           the graduates during task performance.


Data analysis           Data collected from interviews and observations is analyzed in
                        the same manner as questionnaires–that is, compiled, collated,
                        and analyzed by major command or defense system.


Reporting               The results of the field visits and questionnaires should be
findings                combined and reported. The information gathered during field
                        visits is not normally used or reported independently. The
                        analysis results of the questionnaires and field visits are
                        compared in order to validate the findings.

                         Other Sources of Evaluation Input

Other data sources   Other external data sources that can be used to evaluate the
                     graduates' job performance are:

                        Inspection team (IG) reports – AF and MAJCOMs periodically
                        inspect instructional activities to determine their
                        effectiveness. Other inspections conducted by these teams
                        may also discover related problems. Use this source of data
                        to determine if graduates are meeting their job performance
                        requirements. Take appropriate action to correct deficiencies.
                        One example of an IG report is the Functional Management
                        Inspection (FMI).
                        Standardization/evaluation team findings – Standardiza-
                        tion/evaluation teams periodically inspect training activities to
                        determine their effectiveness. Analyze findings indicating a
                        problem and take appropriate action to correct the deficiency.
                        Accident board reports – These reports provide data that
                        determine cause of accidents and recommendations. Often
                        inadequate training or conflicting data in the syllabus-related
                        documents is identified as contributing to the cause. These
                        reports can be included in the training program to motivate
                        students to adopt a correct pattern or technique or discontinue
                        an incorrect one.


Revising the         After the external evaluation data is collected and analyzed, the
training system      next stage is to correct the deficiencies in the training system,
                     once the corrections have been coordinated and approved. If
                     revisions can be made to correct identified deficiencies, they
                     should be made in a timely manner in order to receive the
                     greatest benefits from the changes.

                              Revise Courseware

Introduction       A major portion of the aircrew training ISD activity is the review
                   and revision of existing courseware. The training environment is
                   constantly changing and the courseware must be changed
                   accordingly. In order to guard against obsolescence, it is
                   necessary to periodically review all units of instruction and to
                   revise the courseware as required. Through this review each
                   phase of the ISD process is reached. Courseware revisions can
                   be initiated at any level within the aircrew training organization.


Outcomes of        The outcomes of courseware revisions are numerous. For
courseware         example:
revisions
                      Task list and Established Training Requirements (ETRs) are
                      brought up-to-date.
                      Objectives and tests are brought up-to-date.
                      Courseware control documents are updated.
                      Media are updated or changed.
                      Instructor guides are brought up-to-date.
                      Sufficient copies of the coursebook are on inventory.
                      Academics and flying squadron learning center libraries are
                      updated.
                      Total time spent in revising each unit of instruction, e.g., SME,
                      Curriculum Development Manager (CDM), and administrative
                      time, is reported.
                      Courseware revision checklist is completed.


Change/update      The change/update process used to revise courseware may vary
process            depending on the nature and scope of the revision and the
                   training organization itself. An actual change/update process
                   used by an aircrew training organization is provided in
                   Example 1. Another example of the change/update process is
                   included in Example 2.
AFH 36-2235     Volume 8       1 November 2002                                         208



Example 1:         SME:
Change/update        Prepare course change/update using redline copy of
process              coursebook. Start the redline copy when courseware is
                     printed so it is available for posting when an error or typo is
                     found by you or the students.
                     Initiate Courseware Revision Checklist (see page 211),
                     recording reason for revision.
                     Record time spent on the revision checklist.
                     Plan for word processing turnaround time. Allow two weeks
                     for initial drafting (assuming 100-page coursebook).
                     Complete items 2-7 of the revision checklist. Be sure to
                     review to determine if classified material has been used
                     anywhere in the courseware.
                     Prepare legible redline copy of courseware in proper format
                     with errors and typos corrected.
                     Deliver redline copy to CDM and review it with CDM.
                     After word processing, review, proofread and edit.
                     Approve final product before master copy is prepared for
                     reproduction.
                     Review printed copy to ensure that text and illustrations are
                     legible.
                     Monitor inventory.

                   CDM:
                     Attend monthly crew specialty instructor meetings.
                     Coordinate with SME on all matters affecting courseware and
                     record time spent on a Time Accounting Record Sheet.
                     Receive Courseware Revision Checklist and review redline
                     copy with SME, checking format, legibility of draft, and posting
                     of changes.
                     Submit request for updating graphics/photos as required.
                     Ensure that errors and typos are corrected and then submit to
                     Administration for word processing using AF Form 1509, Word
                     Processing Work Request (Appendix A).

                     Review all materials for completeness and accuracy. Record
                     date on checklist if returned to word processing.
                     Have SME review, proofread, and edit as required. Record
                     date of review on checklist, as well as date returned to word
                     processing, if applicable.

                                    EVALUATION
                                        Overview

Introduction          Evaluation is integrated throughout each activity of the
                      instructional development process. It starts in the planning stage
                      with development of an evaluation plan and continues through the
                      life cycle of the training system. The focus of evaluation is
                      continuous improvement in training system quality. This chapter
                      stresses the importance of the evaluation process by
                      summarizing the evaluation activities discussed in earlier chapters
                      of this handbook. For example, formative and summative
                      evaluations are discussed in Chapter 6 and operational evaluation
                      is described in Chapter 7.


Where are you in      The ISD model, with the evaluation phase highlighted, is depicted
the process?          in Figure 14. As depicted in the model, each stage in the ISD
                      process involves evaluation activities.

Objective            The objective of this chapter is to summarize a:

                        Formative evaluation
                        Summative evaluation
                        Operational evaluation
                        Validate Training


Continuous           As previously mentioned, evaluation is an ongoing process. It
evaluation process   begins during ISD planning and continues as long as the
                     instructional system is operational. The process includes
                     formative, summative, and operational evaluations. Each of these
                     forms of evaluation is discussed in subsequent sections of this
                     chapter. A brief overview of the evaluation process is provided in
                     the following table in order to acquaint the user of this handbook
                     with the continuous evaluation process.

                                  Validate Training

Introduction         ISD is more an art than a science. It offers no fixed formulas that
                     guarantee outcomes, only guidelines. Validation is a quality
                     improvement tool that helps identify problems in the training
                     during development so that revisions can be made. Validation
                     consists of internal reviews, individual tryouts, and small-group
                     tryouts, which are conducted as a part of formative evaluation
                     and operational (field) tryouts, which make up summative
                     evaluation.


What is              Validation is a process that assesses the effectiveness of the
validation?          training as it is being developed with the intention of improving
                     the training product. It is a process of repetitive cycles of
                     development, tryouts, and revisions until evidence shows that the
                     training is effective.


When should you      It is important that validation be conducted during – not after –
validate?            training development and should be part of the total development
                     plan developed during the management phase. The purpose is to
                     correct all mistakes or problems before you spend too many
                     resources on a flawed product. Validation should be done as
                     segments, units, or blocks of training are being developed.

                                      Plan Validation

Introduction          Planning is a key factor in developing a training system. Without
                      adequate planning and preparation, it is unlikely that the training
                      system would effectively and efficiently produce graduates who
                      have the skills, knowledge, and attitudes to perform the job under
                      operational conditions. A part of that necessary planning is how
                      you intend to validate training as it is developed.


Purpose               As with any other plan, a validation plan provides curriculum
                      developers and instructors with a roadmap for validating the

                      to other individuals, such as an instructor. Managers in the
                      training organization have overall responsibility for ensuring that
                      the validation process is adequately planned for the training
                      system being developed. The validation plan is included as part

                             Conduct Internal Reviews

Introduction        The first step in the validation process is internal reviews, which
                    is a formative evaluation activity. These reviews identify technical
                    inaccuracies and instructional weaknesses in the training.
                    Qualified individuals from within the training organization normally
                    conduct the review before a selected target population tries out
                    the training.


Purpose             The purpose of internal reviews is to verify the accuracy of the
                    training materials that have been developed by cross-checking
                    them against data sources such as technical orders, checklists,
                    and job aids.


Who should          The following individuals perform internal reviews:
review?
                       SMEs make sure the content is technically accurate and the
                       coverage is adequate.
                       Curriculum developers make sure the material follows
                       sound instructional principles and the training method,
                       medium, and activities used are appropriate to the content
                       and specified target population.


What should be      Training materials should be submitted for review as they are
reviewed?           developed. If several different authors created the lessons for a
                    unit, the draft materials for the entire unit should be reviewed as a
                    unit before any media are created. Materials to be validated for
                    each type of media are listed below.

                        Cross-check technical data for agreement and concurrency.
                        Use a focus group (SME, supervisors, instructor, and
                        curriculum developer) to review the training material.

Common problems      Some of the common problems that you may identify during the
identified           internal reviews are:

                           Lack of agreement in the material
                           Inaccuracies in the material
                           Incomplete material
                           Weaknesses in the material
                           Lack of continuity in the material


After a review       Upon completion of the internal reviews, you should:

                           Determine the changes to be made to improve the training
                           materials.
                           Decide the best way to make the changes to the training
                           materials.
                           Make the changes to the training materials, as applicable.

                              Conduct Individual Tryouts

Introduction          During the individual tryouts, which are a formative evaluation
                      activity, a curriculum developer tests the training materials on
                      individual students. Several students should be used for
                      comparison in order to obtain more valid and reliable results.


Purpose               The purpose of individual (one-on-one) tryouts is to determine the
                      effectiveness of small segments or units of training and materials
                      as they are developed.


Select students for   When selecting students for individual tryouts, consider these
tryouts               issues.

                         Students selected should represent the target population in:

                             Aptitude
                             Skills
                             Attitude
                             Prior knowledge
                             Background experience

                        Select students for the first tryouts from the upper percentage
                        ranges in aptitude and background. The reasons for selecting
                        students from the upper-percent level for the first tryout are:

                             Above-average students often point out and analyze
                             weaknesses in the training or training materials.
                             If better students cannot learn the material, less capable
                             students will not be able to.
                             If lower-level students are used in the individual test and
                             they do well, it will be hard to assess the relative difficulty
                             of the lesson.
                             It is easier to add material in order to make a lesson
                             easier and more effective than to identify and delete
                             existing material that is unnecessary or confusing in order
                             to achieve the optimum level and quality of instruction.
AFH 36-2235       Volume 8       1 November 2002                                          224



Before a tryout      Before conducting individual tryouts, a curriculum developer
                     should prepare the students for the tryout. Students need to
                     know:

                        Purpose of the tryout.
                        Their role in the tryout.
                        That they are not being evaluated–the training is.
                        That their active participation is essential if the tryout is to be
                        successful.
                        That their feedback is necessary to determine adequacy of
                        the training material.

                     If instructors are involved in the individual tryouts, they should be
                     made aware of their role and the role of the student.


During a tryout      During the individual tryouts, a curriculum developer should:

                        Use a pretest to identify entry behavior.
                        Use a post-test to assess learning as a result of the tryout.
                        Observe where each student seems to have problems or
                        uncertainties.
                        Give assistance only when essential to the student's progress.
                        Determine which exercises or tasks result in errors; type of
                        errors; how many students make the same error(s).
                        Get each student's view about the difficulties encountered
                        during the tryout.
                        Ask each student for suggestions on how to improve the
                        training.


Common problems      Some of the common problems that you may identify during
identified           individual tryouts are:

                        Improper sequencing of the training
                        Gaps in the training
                        Inadequate explanation of content
                        Wrong assumption about target population's prerequisite
                        knowledge
                        Confusing test items
                        Test items that do not measure objectives
                        Insufficient practice time
AFH 36-2235      Volume 8       1 November 2002                                        225



After a tryout      After individual tryouts, analyze the data to determine if there are
                    error patterns or problems. If so, change or revise the training or
                    training material as appropriate.

                    If the training or materials require significant changes, it would be
                    wise to conduct additional tryouts to make sure that changes
                    made were effective in solving the problem.
AFH 36-2235        Volume 8       1 November 2002                                         226



                              Conduct Small-Group Tryouts

Introduction          Up to this point, the success of the training has been based on a
                      limited sampling of students of higher aptitudes. Since training is
                      developed for average students, small-group tryouts that focus on
                      an average group of students are required. Small-group tryouts
                      conclude the formative evaluation process.


Purpose               The purpose of conducting small-group tryouts is to determine if
                      the training works for the average target students.


Select students       Students selected to participate in the tryouts should be
                      representative of the target population. If possible, they should
                      have:

                         Even distribution between low and high aptitudes
                         Varying skill levels
                         Backgrounds that are representative of the target population

                      The number of students in the small groups is determined by
                      several factors, such as:

                         Actual task requirements (for example, some tasks may
                         require students to work in teams of two; if so, the small-group
                         size should be a multiple of two)
                         Planned group size of the actual course
                         Availability of equipment
                         Availability of facilities


Time is critical      During small-group tryouts, students should be given a
factor                reasonable amount of time to learn, practice, and perform the
                      skills trained. The average time required by the groups will help
                      establish the time to be allotted in the course for that unit of
                      training.
AFH 36-2235       Volume 8       1 November 2002                                       227



Before a small-      Before a small group tryout, you should:
group tryout
                        Determine the number and availability of students and groups
                        to be used in the tryouts.
                        Select representative students from the target population.
                        Ensure that training has been revised in accordance with
                        results from individual tryouts.
                        Ensure that student materials are available in adequate
                        quantities.
                        Establish the number of trials a student will be permitted to
                        achieve the criterion performance.


During a tryout      During a small-group tryout, you should:

                        Record the time each student takes to complete the material.
                        This information will be used to validate unit time, course
                        lengths, and course content.
                        Record student responses. This information will help
                        determine the weaknesses of the training.

                     Don't supplement the training. Supplementing the training will
                     skew the results of the tryout.


After a tryout       After a tryout, you should analyze the results to:

                        Identify the average completion time for each segment or unit
                        of training. This information determines the exact time for
                        lessons, segments, units, or modules of training.
                        Determine the need to revise equipment requirements,
                        change the facilities and adjust the personnel authorizations.
                        Revise the training and materials.

                     If the training requires significant changes, it may be necessary to
                     conduct additional tryouts to determine if the revisions will be
                     effective.
AFH 36-2235       Volume 8       1 November 2002                                       228



                        Conduct Operational (Field) Tryouts

Introduction         The final stage of validation is operational (field) tryouts, which
                     comprise the summative evaluation process. Field tryouts
                     provide a learning situation that is intended for the training
                     materials. All of the materials and media should be complete and
                     ready to go. For example, if it is classroom training, an instructor
                     should be used to teach the class. If it is CBT, the students
                     should sit at the computer and interact with the program.


Purpose              Field tryouts serve several purposes:

                        They determine if the training actually works under operational
                        conditions.
                        They provide feedback from a large sample of the target
                        population for final revisions or refinements of the training.
                        They identify implementation problems, such as equipment
                        and facilities.


Select students      For field tryouts, students are assigned to the tryout group using
                     the normal class assignment procedures.


Before a tryout      Before a field tryout, make sure that:

                        Resources are available, such as equipment, facilities, and
                        instructors.
                        Training has been revised based on the results of small-group
                        tryouts.
                        Training materials are available in adequate quantities.
                        Students have been scheduled and informed of the purpose
                        of the tryout.

During a tryout      In many respects, a field tryout is like the normal day-to-day
                     operation of a training course. During a field tryout, you should:

                        Ensure that the training is conducted under normal operating
                        environment.
                        Collect validation data such as time requirements,
                        measurement results, instructor and student comments, and
                        problem areas.
                        Use adequate class samples to ensure that the data is both
                        valid and reliable.


Data collection      During an operational tryout, you may collect data from students
                     before, during, and after the training. The field data collection is
                     summarized.

                               Section B
                           Formative Evaluation

Introduction      The formative evaluation process begins during analysis and
                  continues through small-group tryouts in the development stage
                  of ISD. Within each stage–analysis, design, and development–
                  formative evaluation seeks to improve the quality of the ISD
                  activities (process) and products. In some organizations,
                  formative evaluation is equated to four stages of validation:
                  internal reviews, individual tryouts, small-group tryouts, and
                  operational tryouts.


Definition        Formative evaluation is designed to collect data and information
                  that is used to improve the ISD activities and products while the
                  system is still being developed.


Formative         Formative evaluation includes the following activities.
evaluation
activities        Process Evaluation
                  Process evaluation ensures quality in the analysis, design, and
                  development activities. It checks each activity against the
                  standards or metrics established during ISD project planning, to
                  assure process quality, while continually seeking improvements
                  within each activity. Process evaluation enables curriculum
                  developers to form an effective and efficient training system
                  based on quality principles.

                  Product Evaluation
                  Product evaluation is an integral part of each stage of ISD.
                  Product evaluation focuses on the products of the analysis,
                  design and development activities such as task lists, objectives,
                  tests, plans of instruction and training materials. During product
                  evaluation the focus is again on quality. Products are measured
                  against established standards or metrics to ensure quality.
                  Product evaluation also helps form a total quality training system.
AFH 36-2235   Volume 8       1 November 2002                                         231



Formative        Two activities of product evaluation are:
evaluation
activities          Validation, which takes place during training development
(Continued)         and is the final activity in the formation evaluation process.
                    This component forms the training system by trying out
                    instruction on individuals and small groups. Validation
                    identifies quality improvements that should be made to the
                    training prior to implementation.

                    Quality control starts in the initial stages of ISD planning,
                    with the strategy for controlling quality, and continues
                    throughout training analysis, design and development. This
                    process ensures that each activity, such as equipment
                    acquisition and facility construction, is based on quality
                    principles.

                 Development Test and Evaluation (DT&E)
                 DT&E is an active part of training system development. As a
                 formative evaluation activity, it is conducted to demonstrate that
                 training system equipment design and development is complete,
                 design risks have been minimized, and the system meets
                 performance requirements. It ensures the effectiveness of the
                 manufacturing process, equipment, and procedures.

                 Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E)
                 OT&E completes the formative evaluation process for training
                 system equipment. This formative evaluation activity evaluates
                 the system's operational effectiveness, maintainability,
                 supportability, and suitability to identify any operational and
                 logistic support deficiencies, and to identify the need for
                 modification. In addition, OT&E provides information on
                 organizational structure, personnel requirements, support
                 equipment, doctrine, training, and tactics. It should also provide
                 data to verify operating instructions, maintenance procedures,
                 training programs, publications, and handbooks.

                 Site Readiness Reviews
                 The site readiness review is a formative evaluation activity that
                 focuses on evaluating readiness of the "bed-down" site for the
                 training system. This evaluation ensures that the site, including
                 training facilities and support equipment, is ready for OT&E of the
                 system. Site readiness reviews ensure successful training
                 system implementation.

Relationship of the   Formative evaluation activities contribute to the overall quality of
activities            the training system. They combine to ensure that:

                         Training development activities are effective and cost-efficient.
                         Products of each development activity meet quality standards.
                         Training meets requirements.
                         Equipment satisfies operational, training, and support
                         requirements.

                                 Summative Evaluation

Introduction             With the conclusion of small-group tryouts, formative evaluation
                         activities are complete. Summative evaluation is the next stage
                         in the continuous evaluation process. This stage of evaluation
                         involves trying out the training on the target population in an
                         operational environment. In some organizations, summative
                         evaluations are conducted after the instructional system becomes
                         operational. Summative evaluation includes two components:
                         internal and external evaluation.


Definition               Summative evaluation is designed to collect data and information
                         during the operational (field) tryouts in order to determine the
                         "summed" effect of the training under operational conditions.


Summative                The only activity within summative evaluation is the operational
evaluation activity      tryouts. Operational tryouts:

                            Determine if the instructional system works under operational
                            conditions.
                            Provide feedback from a large sample of target population in
                            which to base revisions prior to implementation of the training
                            system.
                            Identify possible implementation or operational problems.


Evaluating the           Summative evaluations are conducted on fully integrated training
integrated system        systems–that is, each component of the system is functioning as
                         a whole. This form of evaluation is essential in determining the
                         effectiveness of the system and correcting any deficiencies prior
                         to implementation.


Period of                Summative evaluation is focused on the period of operational
summative                tryouts. These tryouts begin after the small-group tryouts have
evaluation               been completed and continue until the training system is
                         implemented. Normally, the operational tryout period is limited to
                         two or three classes.
AFH 36-2235       Volume 8       1 November 2002                                       234



                                   Section D
                             Operational Evaluation

Introduction         As previously mentioned, the evaluation process is continuous.
                     Once formative and summative evaluation activities have been
                     completed and the training system is implemented, operational
                     evaluation begins. Operational evaluations continue as long as
                     the system is operational. In some organizations, this form of
                     evaluation is called summative evaluation.


Definition           Operational evaluation is designed to gather and analyze internal
                     and external feedback data to ensure that the system continues to
                     effectively and cost-efficiently produce graduates who meet
                     established training requirements.


Operational          Operational evaluation activities include internal and external

activities
                     Internal Evaluation
                     Internal evaluation focuses on evaluating the training system
                     internally. This form of evaluation continuously evaluates
                     feedback data, such as instructor comments, students' critiques
                     and test results, in order to continuously improve the system and
                     ensure quality.

                     External Evaluation
                     External evaluation focuses on evaluating the training system
                     externally. This form of evaluation continuously evaluates
                     feedback data from the field, such as inspection and evaluation
                     reports, to ensure that graduates meet the established job
                     performance requirements.


Relationship of      Each operational evaluation activity contributes to the overall
activities           quality of the training system by ensuring that:

                        Each system component continues to contribute to the overall
                        effectiveness and cost-efficiency of the system.
                        Graduates of the course continue to meet established job
                        performance requirements.

Period of        Operational evaluation begins with implementation of the training
operational      system and continues for the life cycle of the system. A schedule
evaluation       of review should be established for all training materials and be
                 included in the ISD evaluation plan. Courseware review boards,
                 with all relevant people in attendance, can also be an effective
                 way of evaluating the program.

The following list of definitions includes those terms commonly used in aircrew training
as it relates to instructional system development and as used in this handbook. The list
is not to be considered all-inclusive.

Acquisition. The procurement by contract, with appropriated funds, of supplies or
services (including construction) by and for the use of the Federal Government through
purchase or lease, whether the supplies or services are already in existence or must be
created, developed, demonstrated, and evaluated.

Aircrew Training System (ATS). A contractor produced, operated and maintained
ground-based system used to train aircrew members. It includes training equipment,
software, firmware, hardware, devices, courseware, training system support, logistics
support, ground-based instruction, media, and facilities. It typically does not include
flight training or aircraft support.

Association. The connection made between an input (stimulus) and an action
(response).

Attitude. (a) The emotions or feelings that influence a learner's desire or choice to
perform a particular task. (b) A positive alteration in personal and professional beliefs,
values, and feelings that will enable the learner to use skills and knowledge to
implement positive change in the work environment. Also see Knowledge and Skill.

Audiovisual Medium. Any delivery device or system which provides both audio and
visual presentations.

Behavior. Any activity, overt or covert, capable of being measured.

Cognition. The mental or intellectual activity or process of knowing, includes both
awareness and judgment.

Cognitive Strategies. The capability of individuals to govern their own learning,
remembering, and thinking behavior.

Computer-Assisted Instruction (CAI). The use of computers to aid in the delivery of
instruction. A variety of interactive instructional modes are used including tutorial, drill,
and practice, gaming, simulations, or combinations. CAI is an integral part of computer-
based instruction (CBI) and computer-based training (CBT).

Computer-Based Instruction (CBI) and Computer-Based Training (CBT). The use
of computers to aid in the delivery and management of instruction. CBI and CBT are
synonymous and are used interchangeably. CAI (the delivery of instruction) and CMI
(computer-managed instruction) are both elements of CBI and CBT.
AFH 36-2235       Volume 8       1 November 2002                                        245


Computer-Managed Instruction (CMI). The use of computers to manage the
instructional process in CAI or CBT. Management normally includes functions such as
registration, pretesting, diagnostic counseling, progress testing, and post-testing. CMI
is also used to schedule and manage training resources such as trainers and actual
equipment.

Constraints. Limiting or constraining conditions or factors, such as policy
considerations, time limitations, equipment, environmental factors, personnel,
budgetary, or other resource limitations.

Contract Logistics Support (CLS). A preplanned method used to provide all or part of
the logistics support to a system, subsystem, modification, or equipment throughout its
life cycle. CLS covers depot maintenance and, as negotiated with the operating
command, necessary organizational and intermediate (O&I) level maintenance,
software support, and other operation and maintenance (O&M) tasks.

Contractor. An individual or organization outside the Government that has accepted
any type of agreement or order for providing research, supplies, or services to a
Government agency.

Course Chart. A qualitative course control document that states the course identity,
length, and security classification, lists major items of training equipment, and
summarizes the subject matter covered.

Course Control Documents. Specialized publications used to control the quality of the
instructional system. Examples are training standards, plans of instruction, syllabi, and
course charts.

Courseware. Training materials such as technical data, textual materials, audiovisual
instructional materials, and computer-based instructional materials.

Criterion. (a) The standard by which something is measured. (b) In test validation, the
standard against which test instruments are correlated to indicate that accuracy with
which they predict human performance in some specified area. (c) In evaluation, the
measure used to determine the adequacy of a product, process, behavior, and other
conditions.

Criterion-Referenced Objective (CRO). (a) A performance-oriented tool identifying
criteria and actions required to demonstrate mastery of a task. (b) An objective with
prescribed levels of performance. Each CRO contains a behavior (task statement), a
condition (available equipment, checklists, and governing directives, or the situation
requiring the task), and a standard (regulation, operating instruction) for the task.

Criterion-Referenced Test (CRT). A test to determine, as objectively as possible, a
student's achievement in relation to a standard based on criterion objectives. During
instructional development, the CRT can be used to measure the effectiveness of the
AFH 36-2235       Volume 8        1 November 2002                                        246


instructional system. The test may involve multiple-choice items, fill-in items, essays, or
actual performance of a task. If given immediately after the learning sequence, it is an
acquisition test; if given considerably later, it is a retention test; if it requires
performance not specifically learned during instruction, it is a transfer test.

Defense System. Any weapon system, support system, or end item that supports a
specific military mission, therefore requiring operations, maintenance, or support
personnel training.

Discrimination. The process of making different responses to a stimulus. A
discrimination requires a person to determine the differences among inputs and to
respond differently to each.

Distance Learning. Training that is exported, such as from a resident course to a field
location. Also called Exportable Training.

Duty. A large segment of the work done by an individual; major divisions of work in a
job.

Evaluation. A judgment expressed as a measure or ranking of trainee achievement,
instructor performance, process, application, training material, and other factors (see
MIL-HDBK-29612). It includes Formative Evaluation; Operational Evaluation; and
Summative Evaluation.

Evaluation Plan. A method or outline of a set of procedures which will be used to
gather data and information for the purpose of assessing a course of instruction or other
training product.

Exportable Training. See Distance Learning.

External Evaluation. The acquisition and analysis of feedback data from outside the
formal training environment to evaluate the graduate of the instructional system in an
operational environment. Also called Field Evaluation. Also see Operational
Evaluation.

Feedback. Information that results from or is contingent upon an action. The feedback
does not necessarily indicate the rightness of an action; rather, it relates the results of
the action from which inferences about correctness can be drawn. Feedback may be
immediate, as when a fuse blows because a lamp is incorrectly wired; or delayed, as
when an instructor provides a discussion pertaining to an exam taken the previous
week, or when completed graduate evaluation questionnaires are reviewed.

Fidelity. The degree to which a task or a training device represents the actual system
performance, characteristics, and environment.

Field Evaluation. See External Evaluation.
AFH 36-2235       Volume 8        1 November 2002                                       247


Formative Evaluation. An activity that provides information about the effectiveness of
training materials to meet training objectives and the trainees' acceptance of training
materials as they are being developed. It is conducted while the instructional system or
course is still under development, to gather data on lessons, units, or modules of
instruction as they are completed. The purpose is make improvements to the system or
course while development is still in progress. Also see Evaluation.

Generalization. Learning to respond to a new stimulus that is similar, but not identical,
to one that was present during original learning. For example, during learning a child
calls a beagle and spaniel by the term "dog"; a child who has generalized would
respond "dog" when presented with a hound.

Instructional Media. The means used to present information to the trainee.

Instructional Objective. See Objective.

Instructional System. An integrated combination of resources (students, instructors,
materials, equipment, and facilities), techniques, and procedures performing effectively
and efficiently the functions required to achieve specified learning objectives.

Instructional System Developer. A person who is knowledgeable of the instructional
system development (ISD) process and is involved in the analysis, design,
development, implementation and evaluation of instructional systems. Also called
Instructional Designer, Instructional Developer, Curriculum Developer, Curriculum
Development Manager, and other terms.

Instructional System Development (ISD). A deliberate and orderly, but flexible,
process for planning, developing, implementing, and managing instructional systems.
ISD ensures that personnel are taught in a cost-efficient way the skills, knowledge, and
attitudes essential for successful job performance.

Interactive Courseware (ICW). Computer-controlled training designed to allow the
student to interact with the learning environment through input devices such as
keyboards and light pens. The student's decisions and inputs to the computer determine
the level, order, and pace of instructional delivery, and forms of visual and aural outputs.

Interactive Video. Video that uses analog and digital databases to present
instructional material in the ICW environment.

Interactive Videodisc (IVD). A form of ICW instruction that specifically makes use of
videodisc technology. Video and audio signals are pressed onto the laser videodisc;
programming codes may or may not be pressed onto the disc depending on the IVD
level. As a result, motion sequence, still-frame shots, computer-generated graphics,
and/or audio may be displayed and heard through a monitor under computer and user
control.
AFH 36-2235        Volume 8        1 November 2002                                        248


Internal Evaluation. The acquisition and analysis of feedback and management data
from within the formal training environment to assess the effectiveness of the
instructional system. Also see Operational Evaluation.

Job. The duties, tasks, and task elements performed by an individual. The job is the
basic unit used in carrying out the personnel actions of selection, training, classification,
and assignment.

Job Aid. A checklist, procedural guide, decision table, worksheet, algorithm, or other
device used by a job incumbent to aid in task performance. Job aids reduce the amount
