This instruction establishes the packaging, testing, and materials handling responsibilities of HQ AFMC
Logistics Readiness Division's (LGRD) Traffic Management Branch, AFMC LSO/LOP (Air Force Pack-
aging Technology and Engineering Facility (AFPTEF)), AFMC LSO/LOT (Transportation and Packaging
Policy Office), the AFMC Air Logistics Centers' (ALC) packaging management sections (packaging spe-
cialists) and Air Force Product Centers' packaging personnel. It does not apply to U.S. Air Force Reserve
or Air National Guard (ANG) units or members. It sets up policies and gives guidance for packaging and
materials handling requirements in contracts, data systems, design and testing, and in the reporting of dis-
crepancies. This instruction implements policies and procedures contained in Air Force Policy Directive
(AFPD) 24-2, Preparation and Movement of Air Force Materiel, and Air Force Instruction 24-202, Pres-
ervation and Packing.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
Most of the changes were small, but essential. Major changes affected Chapter 3, which now includes
references to the coordination between the ALC packaging management sections and the product centers'
packaging personnel. Removed the AFMC FAR clause 9012.

     AFMC ALC/PRODUCT CENTER PACKAGING COORDINATION AND CONFERENCE
                              PARTICIPATION

2.1. General. ALC/Product Center packaging specialists should coordinate their efforts to maintain the
integrity of the Air Force packaging program from cradle-to-grave. They must comply with contracted
data items, and also:
     2.1.1. MIL-STD-1366, Definition of Materiel Transportation System Dimensional and Weight Con-
     straints.
     2.1.2. MIL-PRF-49506, Logistics Management Information.
     2.1.3. MIL-STD-2073-1, Standard Practice for Military Packaging.
NOTE: Other acquisition-related documents for all new and modified systems, equipment, and materiel
to ensure adequate packaging support throughout the lifecycle.

2.2. Product Centers. AFMC Product Center packaging specialists support acquisition logistics by pro-
viding their expertise and developing packaging procedures, concepts, and objectives for Air Force sys-
tems and equipment during acquisition. ALC/Product Center packaging specialists are responsible for
furnishing contractual packaging data for each item being reprocured. However, when current approved
packaging data is not available in local data files, requirements can be determined from
MIL-STD-2073-1, from reviewing item drawings or technical data, or from physically examining items
currently in stock. The AFMC Form 158, Packaging Requirements, is the vehicle used to specify con-
tractual packaging requirements (See Attachment 5).
     2.2.1. Packaging is a function which should be closely coordinated with the actual design and manu-
     facture of an item. Proper PHS&T must be identified during acquisition as part of integrated logistics
     support (ILS) planning. This identification must be made as early as possible in the acquisition life
     cycle.
     2.2.2. To manage acquisition of systems/equipment effectively, PHS&T problems which may restrict
     movement to specific modes of transportation or cause unnecessary packaging must be identified and
     corrected, or avoided, during item design rather than corrected through costly engineering change pro-
     posals (ECPs).
     2.2.3. Since transportability is a function of both transportation and packaging, the Product Center
     packaging specialist ensures that packaging is represented during coordination of transportability
     reports submitted by the contractor.
     2.2.4. ALC/Product Center packaging specialists are responsible for furnishing contractual packaging
     data for each item being reprocured. However, when current approved packaging data is not available
     in local data files, requirements can be determined from MIL-STD-2073-1, from reviewing item
     drawings or technical data, or from physically examining items currently in stock. The AFMC Form
     158 is the vehicle used to specify contractual packaging requirements (See Attachment 5).

2.3. AFMC Air Logistics Centers (ALCs). Immediately upon assignment of responsibility, an ALC
packaging specialist will be designated. The appropriate program manager will be advised of this assign-
AFMCI24-201 14 APRIL 2004                                                                                11


ment in writing to ensure coordination on matters relating to packaging and handling requirements for the
system.
   2.3.1. A packaging specialist from the responsible ALC packaging management section shall be
   included as an active member of the ILS team to participate in the acquisition effort. This ensures that,
   during interim design and acquisition, proper consideration is given to factors which may create
   unnecessary packaging and handling problems during logistics support.
   2.3.2. The prime ALC packaging management section assists the product centers' packaging special-
   ists and reviews technical packaging and handling data. All of the ALC/Product Center packaging
   specialists should maintain communication and coordination with each other to ensure that optimum
   standardization and economy is achieved in the packaging and handling aspects of system develop-
   ment and acquisition.

2.4. Committees, Reviews, and Reports. A packaging specialist from the ALC having life-cycle man-
agement responsibility shall participate in committees or meetings as required to ensure adequate packag-
ing considerations. When it increases the continuity of the AFMC packaging program, representation will
be encouraged by ALC/Product Center packaging specialists. These include, but are not limited to:
   2.4.1. PDRs, CDRs, First Article Configuration Inspections (FACI). A packaging specialist from the
   ALC having life-cycle management responsibility shall participate in PDRs, CDRs, FACIs, and test
   programs which impact upon the packaging and handling support required of AFMC.
       2.4.1.1. This is an area which requires continuous coordination between ALC/Product Center
       packaging specialists to ensure the appropriate packaging specialists are advised of, and actively
       participate in, these reviews whenever packaging or handling is involved.
       2.4.1.2. Details concerning proposed preservation and packing are provided by the contractor in
       the preparation for delivery section of part II of the configuration item (CI) specification. These
       specifications are prepared for the more complex items of equipment and spares. CI specifications
       may also be required for containers which are not covered by existing military specifications or
       when they involve special requirements in terms of materials, added features, etc. The formal
       approval and acceptance of part two of the CI detail specification is a product of the FACI.
   2.4.2. Critical Item Review (CIR) Committee. A packaging specialist from the ALC having life-cycle
   management responsibility shall participate in CIRs to identify and prevent unfavorable conditions
   attributable to packaging and handling. Packaging and handling problem areas identified with a sys-
   tem shall be reported to a program manager, or item manager (IM), as appropriate. Participation is
   also recommended on logistics support preliminary task groups.
   2.4.3. Participation During Development, Test, and Technical Evaluation of Systems/Equipment.
   Packaging specialists from the ALC having life-cycle management responsibility provide packaging
   support for research and development. They also provide AFMC packaging requirements for installs
   and items bought for test purposes. The ALC packaging specialists participate in the evaluation of
   systems, component design, and performance during development, test, and production phases, as
   required, to ensure conformance to logistics transportability and mobility objectives, transportation
   plans, and logistics packaging handling requirements.
   2.4.4. Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E). Evaluation of the contractor’s proposed preservation
   and packing is based upon AFMC PHS&T criteria previously established and incorporated into appli-
   cable contractual and planning documents. Special test requirements or requests for changes in AFMC
12                                                                        AFMCI24-201 14 APRIL 2004


     or contractor test criteria are provided to the program office (or designated representative) for inclu-
     sion in contracts. To ensure proper coverage and evaluation during initial OT&E, the responsible ALC
     packaging specialists supporting the program office shall prepare a preservation and packing checklist
     and participate in the evaluation as required.
     2.4.5. Reports/Evaluations. Evaluations of system components, support equipment design, or
     requested changes are developed in conjunction with inspections and tests. They are provided through
     established channels to the program office. Evaluations are based upon packaging requirements; and
     ease of handling, mobility, and transportability. Examples of factors to be considered during evalua-
     tions include, but are not limited to:
        2.4.5.1. In the design effort, overall dimensions in the system and components should be mini-
        mized to reduce problems of PHS&T. Where practical, configuration must permit movement by
        alternate methods, and provisions must be made to permit disassembly of containers and equip-
        ment to reduce cube and tare for shipment.
        2.4.5.2. All containers or handling devices for the systems or equipment should be compatible
        with related handling systems’ loading requirements to allow for quick transfer between transpor-
        tation modes, interchangeability, and standardization.
     2.4.6. Participation in Guidance Meetings. Packaging specialists from the responsible ALC must
     actively participate in scheduled provisioning and support equipment guidance conferences. Their
     role is to provide general assistance that will help the contractor comply with the logistics packaging
     requirements for spares and repair parts acquired as part of the contract. They also provide guidance
     concerning logistics requirements for packaging and handling of support equipment.
     2.4.7. Provisioning Conferences. The ALC packaging specialists provide packaging support, as
     required, for items being acquired based on the spare and repair parts provisioning document(s) sub-
     mitted by the contractor in accordance with the contract.
        2.4.7.1. When items are acquired through provisioning action, the AFMC Form 158 shall be com-
        pleted indicating the contractor will develop and submit packaging data if Data Item Descriptions
        (DIDs) DI-PACK-80120 (Packaging Coded Data) and DI-PACK-80121 (Special Packaging
        Instruction) have been included as part of the contractual agreement.
        2.4.7.2. When economically feasible, the responsible ALC packaging specialists participate in
        source coding and provisioning meetings to establish detailed packaging requirements and to
        resolve problems concerning packaging of Air Force selected and managed items. These items are
        maintenance source-coded in the “P” series and parts kit-coded “D” or “F.” Definitions of mainte-
        nance source codes are listed in TO 00-25-195, Source, Maintainability, and Recoverability Cod-
        ing of Air Force Weapons, Systems, and Equipment. This support is provided during meetings
        convened by the ALC and the resident provisioning teams.
            2.4.7.2.1. Responsibilities of Participating ALC Packaging Specialists. Detailed packaging
            data should be developed by the responsible ALC's packaging specialists for all items ERRC
            coded C, S, or T. Upon notification of a source coding conference, the responsible ALC's
            packaging specialists will contact other ALCs' packaging specialists that manage items being
            considered, requesting participation or delegation of packaging responsibilities.
            2.4.7.2.2. Source Coding by Depot Provisioning Committee. When source coding is accom-
            plished by a depot provisioning committee, ALC packaging specialists participating in the
AFMCI24-201 14 APRIL 2004                                                                              13


         meeting, determine and specify packaging requirements for those managed items coded for
         acquisition.
         2.4.7.2.3. Source Coding/Provisioning at Contractor Facilities. When provisioning for new
         items are held at the contractor’s facility, the participating ALC's packaging specialists can
         develop and furnish detailed packaging data to the contractor on DD Form 2326, Preservation
         and Packing Data. Participation of the responsible ALC's packaging specialists in these
         meetings is important. Post-provisioning meetings may be arranged for ALC packaging spe-
         cialist development of data if that alternative is more suitable to both the contractor and the
         ALC.
         2.4.7.2.4. Provisioning Under Resident Provisioning Team (RPT) Procedures:
             2.4.7.2.4.1. During the provisioning guidance meeting, representatives of the contract
             administration office, contractor, and ALC arrange details concerning the scheduling of
             the participating ALC's packaging specialists' visits to the contractor’s facility to develop
             packaging requirements.
             2.4.7.2.4.2. ALC packaging specialists shall visit the contractor’s facility as necessary to
             determine packaging requirements for items coded for Air Force management. Procedures
             must be established to ensure that the contractor is either provided with detailed packaging
             data or with authority to proceed with development of packaging data within mutually
             agreed upon time limits.
  2.4.8. Funding for Provisioning Conference Attendance. Although the participation of the responsible
  ALC's packaging specialists in source coding and provisioning meetings is normally encouraged,
  there shall be some occasions when the small number of items involved may not justify attendance.
  Travel funds required to attend these meetings must be projected sufficiently in advance so that they
  can be included in the budget for the appropriate time period.

                         CONTRACTUAL PACKAGING REQUIREMENTS

3.1. General. The ALC/Product Center packaging personnel are responsible for providing contractual
packaging requirements for all procurement actions generated by the ALCs, AFMC Product Centers, Air
Force commands, and other government agencies and departments. This includes, but is not limited to,
initial systems and spares support acquisitions, overhaul/repair actions, modification programs and local
purchase procedures. The ALC and Product Center packaging personnel work together to ensure that
packaging requirements provided for contracting purposes are complete, accurate, and in compliance with
DoD, Air Force, and AFMC packaging policies/procedures and international and federal law.
     3.1.1. PHS&T requirements for major systems and equipment acquired by AFMC are normally
     reflected in SOWs and SOOs and other contractual documents (i.e. AFMC Form 158).
     3.1.2. Packaging requirements for the spares and repair parts being acquired as part of the systems or
     equipment acquisition are established by ALC/Product Center packaging specialists and submitted for
     inclusion into SOWs and SOOs. If contractor is the ICP, then the packaging requirements are estab-
     lished by the Product Centers' packaging specialists. In any instance the ALC and Product Center
     packaging specialists coordinate with each other.
     3.1.3. Standard clauses and specifications should be contractually invoked whenever they satisfy Air
     Force needs. Action is initiated to update or revise any specification found to be inadequate or out-
     dated. The preparing activity or Air Force custodian should be notified if specifications or standards
     are found to be outdated.
     3.1.4. When packaging requirements cannot be satisfied through standard clauses and specifications,
     special requirements may be developed on a one-time basis. Special requirements for contractual stip-
     ulation may include, but need not be limited to, the following:
        3.1.4.1. Specific handling procedures to be provided (for example: lifting eyes, skids, fixtures for
        handling damaged aircraft, etc.).
        3.1.4.2. Specific packaging, handling and transportation plan exhibits to be used as a basis for
        contractor transportability design considerations.
     3.1.5. Military specifications, standards, and commercial standards referenced in AFMC or contractor
     prepared packaging documents should be reviewed to ensure they contain adequate, but not excessive,
     provisions for packaging support.
     3.1.6. Purchase Requests (PR), Military Interdepartmental Purchase Requests (MIPR), and other con-
     tractual documents for hardware, spares, supplies, etc., should be coordinated with the responsible
     ALC's packaging specialists for inclusion of packaging requirements. All contract changes, change
     orders, amendments, or supplemental agreements involving packaging must be coordinated with the
     responsible ALC's packaging specialists. However, non-materiel purchases such as services, studies,
     and changes in funds do not need to be coordinated with the ALC's packaging specialists. Appropriate
     packaging forms shall be completed according to instructions contained herein, attached to the acqui-
     sition document, and forwarded to the appropriate PR/MIPR control office for inclusion in the con-
     tractual document. (This process may be automated if an automated purchase request system is used.)

3.2. Levels of Protection. Attachment 2 contains Air Force recommended packaging levels of protec-
tion for various distribution patterns. The table should be used as guidance only.
   3.2.1. ALC packaging specialists must use their expertise and personal knowledge of anticipated dis-
   tribution patterns for the materiel when specifying levels of protection. Designation of improper level
   of packaging could result in unnecessarily increased costs due to over packing and damage caused by
   lack of adequate protection.
   3.2.2. In some cases, complete information concerning destination or anticipated length of time in
   storage is not furnished to the ALC packaging specialists with the contractual document. An example
   of this is when items are intended for installation, but it is not indicated whether the parts shall be
   installed within CONUS or overseas. When complete details are not furnished with the contractual
   document, ALC packaging specialists shall conduct research to determine the most economical level
   of protection based on anticipated distribution/logistics conditions. Information pertaining to antici-
   pated use, length of time in storage, and destination may be on the PR/MIPR or may be available from
   the initiator of the contractual document.
   3.2.3. When stipulating packaging requirements for items that have been designated for immediate
   use, caution should be exercised to ensure that total storage time shall be limited to less than 12
   months.

3.3. Base Level Contracting. When requested, ALC packaging specialists assist and provide guidance
to the base contracting personnel to ensure that items acquired through local purchase procedures are pro-
vided economical and adequate protection. Commercial packaging may be adequate for items acquired
through local purchase since they are intended for immediate consumption on base. However, care must
be exercised to ensure the packaging complies with federal and international regulations, particularly in
the hazardous materials area.

3.4. Contractual Requirements in Support of Security Assistance Programs. Emphasis on the sup-
port of the Security Assistance Program is required to ensure that materiel is afforded adequate protection.
   3.4.1. Normally, materiel shipped in support of the Security Assistance Program is given military
   preservation and no less than level B packing. However, it is proper to increase or decrease the level
   of packing at the request of the recipient country. The degree of preservation and packing provided
   must ensure safe delivery of material in serviceable condition.
   3.4.2. Lower levels of protection shall not be used unless authorized in writing by the requesting
   country, except as specified in this paragraph. When it is specified on the PR/MIPR the item shall be
   installed within the CONUS, it is proper to specify commercial preservation and packing which shall
   furnish the required protection at the point of use or installation.

3.5. Contractual Packaging Data Requirements. Packaging Data Requirements may either be speci-
fied in the reprocurement contract or action may be initiated to procure the data from the contractor on
new items."
   3.5.1. ALC packaging specialists are responsible for furnishing contractual packaging data for each
   item being reprocured. This data is extracted from existing data files when available. However, when
   current approved packaging data is not available in local data files, requirements can be determined
   from MIL-STD-2073-1, from reviewing item drawings or technical data, or from physically examin-
16                                                                        AFMCI24-201 14 APRIL 2004


     ing items currently in stock. The AFMC Form 158 is the vehicle used to specify contractual packaging
     requirements (See Attachment 5).
     3.5.2. When new items are being bought and approved packaging data is not available and cannot be
     developed in-house, the required data may be procured from the contractor. ALC/Product Center
     packaging specialists determine whether it is practical and economical to obtain contractor-developed
     data. The DD Form 1423, Contract Data Requirements List (CDRL), is used to document require-
     ments for data items invoked to buy contractor-prepared data. To minimize costs, it is important to
     verify that the contractual stipulation of packaging specifications, requirements, data items, etc., are
     accurate, up-to-date, and necessary.
     3.5.3. Evaluate contractor recommendations regarding data requirements. Coordinate/develop and
     submit necessary requirements to the program manager for inclusion in contractual work statements.
     Review and approve contractor submitted packaging data prior to acceptance or entry into AFMC data
     systems (such as the Stock Control & Distribution (SC&D)).
     3.5.4. Military packaging and quantity per unit pack (QUP) can be stipulated for contractual compli-
     ance without requiring the contractor to develop and submit packaging data. This practice is most
     effective when the item shall be stored at the ALC and the data can be developed later. This procedure
     may be most suitable when a small number of items are being procured and no provisioning action is
     involved. However, in order to best assist the contractor in providing items with adequate protection,
     as much data as possible should usually be furnished to the contractor.

3.6. Procuring Packaging Data From Contractors. Data calls are used to identify the need to procure
various data from the contractor as part of the contract. When it is in the best interest of the Air Force for
the contractor to develop packaging or transportability data, ALC/Product Center packaging specialists
must determine minimum essential data item requirements and provide them as specified in the data call.
Product Center packaging specialists shall determine essential data requirements for contractor ICP pro-
grams to ensure the users and/or field activities receive required packaging data for reparables.
     3.6.1. DIDs. DIDs are specified in the contract to instruct the contractor as to the information and for-
     mat required for the appropriate data being procured. The only packaging DIDs that can be provided
     in response to a data call are those listed in the current edition of DoD 5010.12L, Acquisition Manage-
     ment Systems and Data Requirements Control List (AMSDL), or otherwise approved according to
     DoD 5000.2-R, Mandatory Processes for Major Defense Acquisition Programs and Major Automated
     Systems. DD Form 1423 is used to annotate specifics about data delivery, routing, number of copies
     required, and tailoring requirements. The DD Form 1423 can only be used to tailor requirements out
     of the DID or to clarify what is already in the DID. It cannot be used to add requirements to the DID.
     3.6.2. Major Packaging DIDs. The major packaging DIDs include:
        3.6.2.1. DI-PACK-80120, Preservation and Packing Data.
        3.6.2.2. DI-PACK-80121, Special Packaging Instructions (SPI).
        3.6.2.3. DI-PACK-81059, Performance Oriented Packaging (POP) Test Report.
        3.6.2.4. DI-PACK-80683, Container Design Retrieval System (CDRS) Search Request.
        3.6.2.5. DI-PACK-80684, Container Design Retrieval System (CDRS) Data Input.
        3.6.2.6. DI-MISC-81499, Packaging Kit Contents List (precedes DI-L-7137).
AFMCI24-201 14 APRIL 2004                                                                                 17


     3.6.2.7. To obtain transportability information from the contractor, specify DI-PACK-80880,
     Transportability Report.
  3.6.3. Performance Oriented Packaging (POP) Test Reports. Test reports for POP can be obtained by
  stipulating DI-PACK-81059. It is not mandatory to ask for a contractor’s POP test report when procur-
  ing hazardous materials packaging data. However, it may be in the best interest of the DoD to request
  a contract POP test report when procuring contractor-developed packaging data to ensure the contrac-
  tor’s proposed container design can pass POP tests.
  3.6.4. Category E DIDs. Consideration shall be given to requesting a copy of data according to DIDs
  in Category E (Engineering and Configurations Documentation). These DIDs involve specifications
  and the data generated by them may provide information relevant to the contractor’s proposed protec-
  tion of primary items being developed. If the DD Form 1423 is not annotated to require submission of
  such data to the responsible ALC packaging management section, positive action must be taken to
  ensure access.
  3.6.5. DIDs for Provisioning. DI-PACK-80120 and DI-PACK-80121 are stipulated on the DD Form
  1423 when items are being acquired through the provisioning process. However, their use is not lim-
  ited to provisioning actions. During the data call, the initiator should stipulate a requirement that pack-
  aging data be individually priced by type (special packaging instructions (SPI) and coded data) or that
  prices be negotiated for packaging data concurrent with negotiation of prices of the provisioned items.
  This shall assist the responsible ALC packaging management section in determining the most eco-
  nomical means of data development (in-house or contractor). The latest revisions to specifications,
  standards and DIDs can be found in the ASSIST, at http://assist.daps.dla.mil/.
  3.6.6. SPI Requirements for Reparables. DI-PACK-80121 will be stipulated in conjunction with
  DI-PACK-80120. In order to maintain the integrity of the Air Force reusable container program, a
  statement such as the following shall be inserted in Block 16 of the DD Form 1423 that references
  DI-PACK-80121B: SPIs, which include drawings, and Fast or Standard packs IAW TO 00-85B-3,
  How to Package Air Force Spares, shall be developed for all items that are subject to individual ship-
  ment between users and a repair facility (reparable items). This includes items coded as expendability,
  recoverability, reparability category (ERRC) C, S, or T. If it is determined by the packaging specialist
  at the responsible ALC packaging management section to be more advantageous, MIL-STD-2073-1
  coded packaging data may be used for certain items instead of a SPI drawing. For every item having a
  SPI drawing, the packaging coded data (DI-PACK-80120) is required to input data into the D035T.
  When DI-PACK-80121 is stipulated, the DD Form 1423 is annotated to require contractors to furnish
  the original and one copy of the DD Form 2169, Special Packaging Instruction, to the responsible
  ALC packaging management section.
  3.6.7. DIDs for Anticipated Long-Life Container Requirements. When development and or use of
  long-life containers is anticipated, DI-PACK-80683 and DI-PACK-80684 must be stipulated on the
  DD Form 1423. DI-PACK-80683 is used to avoid costly design of long-life containers if an existing
  design can be used or modified for use. DI-PACK-80684 serves as a means to enter new container
  designs into the CDRS for future use. The DD Form 1423 must be annotated to require requests for
  design retrieval be submitted to the CDRS Office (AAC/WMOC, Eglin AFB FL 32542-5313). The
  responsible ALC/Product Center packaging specialists should annotate the DD Form 1423 so that
  they obtain an information copy of all design requests. ALC packaging management sections may
  exempt contractors from submitting approved new designs to AAC/WMOC. However, if the ALC
  packaging management section exempts contractors from submitting new designs to the CDRS, the
18                                                                       AFMCI24-201 14 APRIL 2004


     ALC packaging management section must be responsible for submitting the designs to CDRS. Con-
     tact AFMC-LSO/LOP (AFPTEF) or AAC/WMOC if a new long-life container must be developed
     (See Chapter 7).
     3.6.8. Commercial Item Description (CID). Each CID should have a “Packaging, Packing, Marking,
     and Palletization” paragraph(s). The following paragraph should be a part of all CIDs: “Packaging,
     Packing, and Palletization: Unless otherwise specified in the contract, packaging, packing, and pallet-
     ization shall be in accordance with ASTM D3951, Standard Practice for Commercial Packaging, as
     specified for shipments to the Department of Defense. Marking shall be in accordance with
     MIL-STD-129.”

3.7. AFMC Form 158, Packaging Requirements. Packaging requirements for inclusion in AFMC con-
tractual documents are accomplished on AFMC Form 158 (See Attachment 5) by the ALC/Product Cen-
ter packaging specialist. The following paragraphs under 3.7. apply to the requirements incorporated on
the AFMC Form 158:
     3.7.1. Current Packaging Documents and Data. Approved and current specifications and standards,
     MIL-STD-2073-1 coded/supplemental data, or SPIs must be entered in the appropriate blocks/col-
     umns of the AFMC Form 158.
     3.7.2. End Item/System Specifications. Before citing packaging requirements on the AFMC Form
     158 (or computer generated equivalent), review the applicable end item/system specification, system
     requirements documents, technical requirements documents, and other contractual documents to
     ensure that requirements are current, adequate, accurate, and compatible with current Air Force and
     AFMC policies.
     3.7.3. Quantity Per Unit Pack (QUP). Only QUPs that have been approved or furnished by the Item
     Manager (IM) will be stipulated on the AFMC Form 158. The ALC packaging specialists cannot
     change IM established QUPs unless approved by the IM. Current packaging data records will be
     reviewed to ensure that the data reflects approved unit package quantities. On PRs/MIPRs, unit pack-
     age quantities for all items being acquired are annotated by the PR/MIPR initiator immediately fol-
     lowing the item nomenclature. When the unit pack quantities seem incompatible with packaging
     requirements, ALC packaging specialists will submit written recommended changes, with rationale,
     to the appropriate M, with the understanding that the IM has final control over the establishment of
     QUP.
     3.7.4. Completing AFMC Form 158. In the upper left hand corner of the form, specify the PR, MIPR,
     or document number (use system name if no number is available). Indicate the page number (Page __
     of __) in the upper right hand corner. Complete the rest of AFMC Form 158 (See Attachment 5) as
     follows:
        3.7.4.1. Block 1, Packaging Requirements. Complete Block 1, for each item of the PR/MIPR or
        contract requiring packaging. This block is used for all items and covers military or commercial
        packaging requirements and should be further defined in Blocks 2, 3, or 4. The commercial ASTM
        D3951 could be substituted by another document if specified in Block 2.
            3.7.4.1.1. Under the “Item ID” column, enter the National Stock Number (NSN) which is
            comprised of the Federal Supply Class (FSC), National Item Identification Number (NIIN),
            and sometimes includes the Material Management Aggregation Code (MMAC). If the NSN/
            MMAC is not available, use the Contract Line Item Number (CLIN), item name as shown on
AFMCI24-201 14 APRIL 2004                                                                              19


        the contractual document, part number, or any other way of identifying a particular item.
        Throughout the rest of this chapter, “Item Identification” will be referred to as “item”.
        3.7.4.1.2. Under “QUP”, enter the IM’s QUP in terms of unit of issue.
        3.7.4.1.3. Under “MIL-STD-2073-1”, indicate (X) if military preservation “PRES” is required
        and enter A, B or M (Minimum) under “PACK” to ensure the item will be usable within the
        logistics pipeline (i.e., when the item is entering the DoD inventory, to be stored outside, For-
        eign Military Sales (FMS), an overseas shipment, etc.). Use Attachment 3 as a guideline for
        determining military packaging requirements. If commercial packing is used then leave
        “PACK” blank, and under “COMMERCIAL ASTM D3951” indicate (X) for “Pack.”
        3.7.4.1.4. Under “COMMERCIAL ASTM D3951”, indicate (X) when preservation “PRES”
        is adequate during the anticipated logistics pipeline (i.e. immediate use at first destination and
        domestic shipments). Indicate (X) for “Pack” when commercial packing is authorized.
        3.7.4.1.5. Under “CBP” (commercial best practice), indicate (X) when contractor’s commer-
        cial best practice is acceptable for preservation if required and for packing. Use only when
        military packaging is not needed, the contractor will not meet the ASTM D3951 or any other
        industrial document, and this is the only item that will meet the mission/customer’s (user’s)
        needs.
        3.7.4.1.6. Under “Special Packaging Instructions Number”, enter the entire SPI number or
        federal/military specification that applies. The SPI can be obtained from the DoD Inventory
        Control Point (ICP), which is the responsible ALC packaging management section. (See
        Chapter 5)
     3.7.4.2. Block 2, Additional Packaging and Container Markings. In this block, place all additional
     packaging and container marking requirements which cannot be clarified in either Blocks 1, 3, or
     4. Specify all revisions and dates of required specifications, standards, and data item descriptions
     (DIDs). Include the corresponding item from the Block 1 column which shows one of the follow-
     ing; NSN/MMAC, NIIN, Contract Line Item Number (CLIN), or item name as shown on the con-
     tracting document to show the relationship.
     3.7.4.3. Block 3, Instructions to Contracting Officer. Indicate (X) the appropriate clause(s) to be
     incorporated into Section D of the contract for each corresponding item identified in Block 1. See
     AFMCFARS 5347.305-10, Packaging, Marking, and Consignment Instructions.
        3.7.4.3.1. AFMCFARS 5352.247-9005, Shipping Container Marking. Indicate (X) the corre-
        sponding item(s) identified in Block 1 which requires over and above MIL-STD-129 bar code
        marking. Explain these requirements in Block 2.
        3.7.4.3.2. AFMCFARS 5352.247-9006, Marking of Warranted Items. Indicate (X) the corre-
        sponding item(s) identified in Block 1 which requires warranty marking.
        3.7.4.3.3. AFMCFARS 5352.247-9007, Specification Commercial Packaging (ASTM
        D3951). Indicate (X) the item(s) listed in Block 1 which is to be preserved IAW Commercial
        requirements of ASTM D3951. If military marking is required with this block, AFMCFARS
        5352.247-9005 will also be indicated (X).
        3.7.4.3.4. AFMCFARS 5352.247-9009, Military Packaging and Marking. Indicate (X) the
        item(s) listed in Block 1 which is to be preserved and marked IAW military requirements.
20                                                                        AFMCI24-201 14 APRIL 2004


            When Military preservation is stipulated, indicate (X) only this clause (in conjunction with any
            other applicable non-packaging clauses).
            3.7.4.3.5. AFMCFARS 5352.247-9010, Engineered or Specialized Containers (CDRS). Indi-
            cate (X) the item(s) listed in Block 1 which requires an engineered or specialized container
            (CDRS).
            3.7.4.3.6. AFMCFARS 5352.247-9011, Packaging and Marking of Hazardous Material. Indi-
            cate (X) the item(s) listed in Block 1 which requires hazardous packaging and marking
            requirements.
            3.7.4.3.7. AFMCFARS 5352.247-9013, Packaging Data (Coded and/or Special Packaging
            Instructions). Indicate (X) if packaging data is required and it is desirable to purchase the data
            from the contractor. This block will be indicated when items are being procured through a pro-
            visioning action. If known, indicate the contract number for which data is being procured.
        3.7.4.4. Block 4, Coded Data. Complete this block when coded data is available from the DoD
        Inventory Control Point, which is the responsible ALC packaging management section.
            3.7.4.4.1. Under the “Item Identification” column, indicate the item(s) listed in Block 1 (NSN,
            NIIN, CLIN or item name as shown on the contractual document) and specify the available
            military coded data for each item(s) as applicable. If using the NSN, include the Material Man-
            agement Aggregation Code (MMAC) if applicable.
            3.7.4.4.2. Specified military coded data shall be in accordance with MIL-STD-2073-1. Col-
            umn headings and numbers correspond to those on the DD Form 2326 in Appendix E of
            MIL-STD-2073-1.
        3.7.4.5. AFMC Form 158 Reverse Side, European Union Requirements. These European Union
        requirements, levied on the United States, Canada, China, and Japan, concern environmental
        infestation. Specific to the Pinewood Nematode, any lumber, packaging/container, or pallet con-
        structed entirely or in part of non-manufactured softwood species shall meet the specifics of these
        requirements. Involved is a heat treatment process that will eradicate the Pinewood Nematode and
        reduce moisture in the softwood materials to prevent reinfestation. Compliance also requires cer-
        tification and conspicuous marking for both softwood and hardwood species.

3.8. Waivers of and Deviations from AFMC Form 158 Requirements. ALC/Product Center packag-
ing specialists shall review and, if warranted, approve all waivers and deviations concerning AFMC Form
158 packaging requirements. This includes waivers of or deviations from military specifications or stan-
dards cited. An amended AFMC Form 158 shall be prepared by ALC/Product Center packaging special-
ists only, to reflect new requirements if required by the procuring activity.
     3.8.1. These exhibits should be used simply to duplicate the requirements of MIL-STD-2073-1. The
     MIL-STD-2073-1 is used when the documents authorized by AFMC for contractual stipulation do not
     provide for the peculiarities in the packaging requirements a specific system or material, or when clar-
     ification of existing contractual documents is required. Such agreements are invoked when they result
     in savings or other benefits to the Air Force, at no detriment to the protection of the items involved.
     When it is apparent that the provisions of the agreement may have recurring AFMC-wide application,
     contact AFMC-LSO/LOT so consideration can be given to adopting the terms of the agreement as a
     standard AFMC packaging requirement.
AFMCI24-201 14 APRIL 2004                                                                             21


   3.8.2. When agreements involve items for which an AFMC activity other than the one initiating the
   agreement has management responsibility, the proposed packaging agreement shall be coordinated in
   writing with the managing activity before incorporating it into a contract. This should be accom-
   plished as soon as possible after initiation of the requirement.
   3.8.3. Caution shall be exercised to make sure packaging requirements do not infringe on areas of
   responsibility assigned to other DoD agencies. When terms of the agreement affect other AFMC
   activities or other Air Force or DoD activity the agreement shall be coordinated with them.

3.9. Contractual Requirements for Hazardous Materials. The provisions of DoD Federal Acquisition
Regulation (FAR) Supplement 52.228-7007 are cited when specifying packaging requirements for ammu-
nition and explosives. DoD FAR Supplement 52.223-7000 is specified for radioactive materials. FAR
52.223-3 is specified for hazardous material other than ammunition, explosives, and radioactive materi-
als.

3.10. Obtaining Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS). MSDSs are required for all known hazardous
items and for all items shown in FED-STD-313, Material Safety Data, Transportation Data, and Disposal
Data for Hazardous Materials Furnished to Government Activities, Table I and II. Contract information is
identified in the FAR in subpart 23.3 and paragraph 52.223-3. This requirement includes centrally and
locally purchased items. (Note that MSDSs are not used in developing transportation data for ammunition
and explosive items. Instead, data from DI-L-3311 is sent to OO-ALC/WMCS for determination of haz-
ard classification.) Anytime an MSDS is used, the face of the AFMC Form 158 must be stamped “MATE-
RIAL SAFETY DATA SHEET REQUIRED” wherever adequate space is available. The AFMC Form
158 can also be used to highlight the need for POP testing, packaging, and marking requirements in accor-
dance with applicable model requirements.

3.11. Transfer of Packaging Data for Logistics Support. Packaging data obtained from the contractor
during acquisition must be provided to the responsible ALC packaging management personnel to ensure
adequate spares support. ALC packaging management personnel identify and shall incorporate into Sec-
tion 6 of the transition agreement requirements to transfer the information to the supporting ALC.
   3.11.1. Packaging data to be transferred may include drawings furnished by the contractor as part of
   Section 5, Part II; pertinent CI specifications; and drawings developed for special design protection
   equipment in support of other CIs.
   3.11.2. The transition agreement should be written to ensure the transfer of required packaging and
   handling information from the program office and any other AFMC acquisition office that may have
   data.

                                                Chapter 4

                                      HAZARDOUS MATERIALS

4.1. Hazardous Materials. For the purposes of this instruction, the term “hazardous materials” means
explosives (Class 1), compressed gases (Class 2), flammable liquids (Class 3), flammable solids (Class
4), oxidizers and organic peroxides (Class 5), poisons and infectious substances (Class 6), radioactive
materials (Class 7), corrosive materials (Class 8), and miscellaneous dangerous goods (Class 9), or any
substance or material which has been determined to be capable of posing an unreasonable risk to health,
safety, or property. The term includes hazardous substances, hazardous wastes, marine pollutants and ele-
vated temperature materials. This definition is also contained in 49 CFR 100-199 and joint service publi-
cation AFMAN 24-204(I), Preparing Hazardous Materials for Military Air Shipments. Definitions for
worker safety and health purposes are contained in 29 CFR 1910.1200.

4.2. Hazardous Materials Regulatory Guidance. The following documents govern packaging require-
ments for various modes:
     4.2.1. Water Shipments (International). International Maritime Organization (IMO), International
     Dangerous Goods (IMDG) Code.
     4.2.2. Airlift. International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), Technical Instructions for the Safe
     Transport of Dangerous Goods by Air, International Air Transport Association (IATA), Dangerous
     Goods Regulations, or AFMAN 24-204(I).
     4.2.3. Mail and Parcel Post Shipments. AFI 24-201, Cargo Movement, and Transportation of Mate-
     rial, and Postal Regulations, parts 124-125.
     4.2.4. All Modes (Domestic). 49 CFR 100-199 for packaging and transportation requirements and 29
     CFR 1910.1200 for communication requirements. The Occupational Safety and Health Administra-
     tion (OSHA) Hazard Communication Standard ensures that all chemicals produced or imported by
     chemical manufacturers or importers are evaluated to ensure that workers who come into contact with
     them are apprised of the hazards. Personnel who deal with hazardous materials require training in
     accordance with the hazardous communication standard. Information regarding hazardous materials
     is transmitted by container labeling and other forms of warning, MSDS, and employee training.
     4.2.5. Department of Transportation Training. 49 CFR 172.702 and 704. The Department of Trans-
     portation (DOT) requires a hazardous employer, whose employees are exposed to hazardous materials
     during their routine duties, to provide training and test employees on the chemicals routinely encoun-
     tered. The training must cover general awareness/familiarization, safety (can compliment or replace
     training required in 49 CFR 172.704 or EPA training) and specific functional training. Training is
     required on or before 1 October 1993 and must be performed at least every second year. New employ-
     ees must be tested within 90 days of starting the job. The manager must maintain documentation of
     compliance on all employees that fall under this requirement a minimum of 90 days following
     employment termination.

4.3. Hazardous Materials Certification. The depot packaging activity provides necessary guidance to
the transportation officer or authorized agent to ensure certification is completed by qualified personnel as
required by AFMAN 24-204(I) and other government regulations. ALC packaging specialists provide
guidance as needed for the items they manage.
AFMCI24-201 14 APRIL 2004                                                                                23


4.4. Special Responsibilities:
   4.4.1. Hazardous Materials Packaging Requirements for Prime Items. Each ALC packaging manage-
   ment section establishes packaging and handling requirements for its assigned prime items.
   4.4.2. MSDS. The requirement to provide an MSDS for hazardous materials must be stipulated con-
   tractually (See Chapter 3).
       4.4.2.1. FED-STD-313 contains criteria for receiving MSDSs from the contractor.
       4.4.2.2. Safety and health information based on the MSDS must be submitted to the Hazardous
       Material Information Resource System (HMIRS) database by the Institute of Environmental
       Safety and Occupational Health Risk and Analysis, IERA/RSH, 2513 Kennedy Circle, Building
       180, Room 134, Brooks AFB TX 78235-5123.
       4.4.2.3. MSDS prepared for chemicals covered by the OSHA Hazard Communication Standard
       must be routed through the base bioenvironmental engineer to USAF OEMB at Brooks AFB.
       4.4.2.4. PHS&T information must be submitted to the HMIRS data system (or reviewed to ensure
       that data is already present) for all MSDSs that contain a valid NSN. This information must be
       provided as required by Chapter 6. Each ALC packaging management section is responsible for
       providing the HMIRS with transportation data based upon the MSDS data for the items they man-
       age. Local procedures shall be initiated to establish a suspense file to ensure transportation infor-
       mation is provided for applicable items. Each ALC packaging management section should send a
       copy of the MSDS to Institute of Environmental Safety and Occupational Health Risk and Analy-
       sis, IERA/RSH.
       4.4.2.5. Explosive items (Class 1) are not required to have an MSDS, but must be hazard classed
       in accordance with 49 CFR 173, Subpart C-Definitions, classification and packaging of Class 1.
   4.4.3. Reviewing AFJMAN 24-204. All AFMC shall periodically review AFJMAN 24-204 to ensure
   uniformity of packaging with SPI, specifications, and standards. Where inconsistencies exist that
   require a change to AFJMAN 24-204, AFMC-LSO/LOT, Packaging Policy, must be advised. If
   changes are required to specifications and standards due to AFJMAN 24-204 requirements, they shall
   be addressed to the preparing activity for the document.
   4.4.4. Using Non-DoT Specified Packaging. When packaging other than that specified by the DoT is
   used for hazardous materials, the packaging must be of equal to or greater strength and efficiency as
   the packaging prescribed by the DoT as authorized by 49 CFR 173.7. The use of non-DoT packaging
   must be substantiated and documented as being equal to or greater than DoT requirements according
   to joint service document AFI 24-210/DLAR 4145.41, Performance Oriented Packaging (POP) of
   Hazardous Materials. The ALC packaging management section must coordinate with medical, safety,
   and item management personnel, as appropriate. All documentation supporting the alternate packag-
   ing must be kept on file until the item is removed from the DoD inventory.
   4.4.5. The ALC Packaging Specialists' Responsibilities Toward Preparing Hazardous Materials for
   Shipment. The ALC packaging specialists shall provide guidance to shippers in determining material
   requirements. This guidance will address preservation, packing, and marking according to applicable
   directives governing the mode of transportation used and the hazardous potential of the item.
       4.4.5.1. The ALC packaging specialists must ensure that hazardous materials regulatory require-
       ments and cautionary markings are specified in procurement documents. POP requirements must
24                                                                      AFMCI24-201 14 APRIL 2004


       be specified in contracts for all hazardous materials that have been identified as POP, regardless of
       destination.
       4.4.5.2. The ALC packaging specialists shall assist depot packaging operations, off-base person-
       nel shipping Air Force-managed NSNs, and contractors by providing hazardous materials guid-
       ance.
       4.4.5.3. The ALC packaging specialists shall provide guidance on packaging, marking, labeling,
       and manifest preparation for hazardous wastes. Hazardous wastes include any solid waste defined
       as a hazardous waste by 40 CFR 261.3. Bioenvironmental engineers (SG) can provide guidance
       on identifying and handling hazardous wastes.
           4.4.5.3.1. Hazardous Waste Packaging. Hazardous waste must be packaged in containers
           required by 49 CFR or in container of equal or greater strength and efficiency as required by
           DoD regulations. When containers required by 49 CFR are not used, the provisions of DoDM
           4160.21, Chapter VI, must be followed.
           4.4.5.3.2. Hazardous Waste Labeling and Marking. Hazardous waste shipments must be
           labeled with appropriate DoT hazard class labels and properly completed hazardous waste
           label. Shipments must be marked according to 40 CFR 262.32, 49 CFR 172, and
           MIL-STD-129, Standard Practice for Military Marking.
       4.4.5.4. Hazardous Materials Bulletin Board System (Hazmat BBS). This system provides an
       additional avenue for access to hazardous material information issued by the AFMC-LSO/LOT,
       Packaging Policy Office. The Hazmat BBS is accessible 24 hours a day at
       https://www.afmc-mil.wpafb.af.mil/Hazmat. The Hazmat BBS facilitates proper packaging of
       military air shipments of hazardous materials and enhances packaging information transfer to field
       activities.

4.5. Hazardous Materials Training. All DoD personnel who handle, inspect, package and ship hazard-
ous materials via military air must receive proper training. The training shall be conducted as required by
AFJMAN 24-204 and Service policy directives.
AFMCI24-201 14 APRIL 2004                                                                                25


                                                Chapter 5

                          PACKAGING DATA AND SPI DEVELOPMENT

5.1. Packaging Data Development. Packaging data developed in-house must be prepared in accordance
with MIL-STD-2073-1. The format is specified by DD Form 2326, Preservation and Packing Data. It is
not necessary to complete or maintain a hard copy of the DD Form 2326 if data is electronically prepared
and entered into the AFMC packaging, transportation, and regulated material system (PT&RM) D035T
portion of the Stock Control System (SCS).

5.2. Packaging Data Approval. Packaging data procured from contractors must be approved by the
responsible ALC packaging specialists prior to use or entry into the D035T (PT&RM) data system. This
applies to coded and SPI data. Stamps are used by authorized ALC packaging specialists to indicate
approval of the packaging data. The center of this diamond-shaped stamp includes a number that identi-
fies both the responsible ALC packaging management section and the authorized packaging specialist.
These identification numbers are listed below.

Table 5.1. Packing Identification Numbers.
        ALC                   Stamp Numbers
        OC-ALC                1-20
        OO-ALC                21-40
        SA-ALC                41-60
        SM-ALC                61-80
        WR-ALC                81-100

5.3. Preparing SPIs. Each ALC packaging management section maintains SPIs for items requiring spe-
cial packaging techniques, materials, or containers. The detail must be sufficient for reproduction by base
packaging personnel for return to a technology repair center (TRC), or prepare them for redistribution.
Whenever possible, SPIs should be designed so that they can be applied to groups of similar items. If fea-
sible, a short-life container shall be designed as an alternate pack to long-life containers. SPIs are main-
tained for all items with ERRC Codes/Designators C/XD1, S/ND2, and T/XD2 that are subject to
shipment as a single item between field activities and repair facilities (See AFMAN 23-110, Volume I,
Part 4, Attachment 1A27 (previously AFM 67-1, Volume I, Part 4, Attachment 27)). These might not
always be “true” SPIs, in the sense that discrete SPIs are not required for items suitable for fast packs or
standard packs. However, correlating the reparable item’s NSN with a SPI number of some type maintains
the integrity of the Air Force reusable container program and conserves Air Force and DoD dollars. TO
00-85B-3, How to Package Air Force Spares, provides details on the coding system imbedded in the
“pseudo” SPI number assigned to fast packs and standard packs. Use AFMC Form 157, Special Packag-
ing Instruction Worksheet, or any other approved method when drafting SPIs.
   5.3.1. Format and Requirements. The suggested order of preference for types of packaging techniques
   to be used, subject to cost effectiveness, is as follows:
       5.3.1.1. Standard pack.
26                                                                       AFMCI24-201 14 APRIL 2004


        5.3.1.2. Fast pack.
        5.3.1.3. Discrete SPI drawing.
        5.3.1.4. This suggested order of preference should not be the sole determining factor in the type
        of technique above. All items should be packaged in the most cost effective container that will
        adequately protect the material. Before selection, each type should be evaluated for practicality
        and cost-effectiveness (labor, materials, weight, cube, etc.) as well as fit and protection provided
        for the item in question. A computer-generated form may be used for SPIs developed using the
        CADS. The general format and requirements for SPIs can be found in MIL-STD-2073-1.
     5.3.2. SPI Development on CADS. CADS is used to produce SPI and technical illustrations for
     assigned items and to change those SPIs which require revision. Any other uses require approval from
     AFMC-LSO/LOT (AFPTEF). Chapter 6 contains additional information about CADS. General crite-
     ria for SPI development are:
        5.3.2.1. Packaging designs requiring revision due to known problems.
        5.3.2.2. Active depot reparable without a SPI.
        5.3.2.3. New SPIs received from contractors.
        5.3.2.4. Revisions to SPIs for administrative changes.
        5.3.2.5. Conversion of existing transportation packing orders (TPO) to SPI format.

5.4. SPI Numbering. The SPI numbering system provides for three categories of SPIs. Each is limited to
ten character positions. Each category shall be identifiable through use of distinctly different alphanu-
meric arrangements within the ten positions. The first character position for each of the three categories
shall always be the alpha service designator (A = Army, D = DLA, F = Air Force, M = Marine Corp, N =
Navy). SPI numbers shall not be changed due to national item identification number (NIIN) changes (see
TO 00-85B-3).
     5.4.1. Discrete SPI Numbers. A Discrete SPI has a ten position number using the Service designator
     (alpha) in the first position and the NIIN for the remaining nine positions (ex. A001234567). This
     NIIN may represent a single item or a family of items.
     5.4.2. Fast Pack Numbers. Fast packs (and standard packs) are given “pseudo” SPI numbers to facil-
     itate effectiveness of the Air Force reusable container program. There are no drawings required to
     pack a fast pack (see TO 00-85B-3). The fast pack ten position number (ex. A000004XA5) consists of
     the following:

Table 5.2. Fast Pack Numbers Explained.
Position 1           Military service/agency designator (alpha IAW Section II, TO 00-85B-3)
Positions 2 - 6      Five zeroes (numeric)
Position 7           Method of Preservation (numeric IAW Section III, TO 00-85B-3)
Position 8           “X” (fast pack unique designator IAW Section II, TO 00-85B-3)
Positions 9 - 10     Fast pack size code (alphanumeric IAW Section IV, TO 00-85B-3)
AFMCI24-201 14 APRIL 2004                                                                                 27


NOTE: The last three characters, though, are the most identifiable indicator of a fast pack and are printed
on each container. To assist depot packing and crating personnel, the fast pack NSN should be annotated
in the “D” record of the DD Form 2326 when developing and entering packaging data to AFMC data sys-
tems (see TO 00-85B-3).
   5.4.3. Standard Pack Numbers. Standard packs (and fast packs) are given “pseudo” SPI numbers to
   facilitate effectiveness of the Air Force reusable container program. There are no drawings required to
   pack a standard pack (see TO 00-85B-3). The standard pack ten position number (ex. A000004F01)
   consists of the following:

Table 5.3. Standard Pack Numbers.
Position 1            Military service/agency designator (alpha IAW Section II, TO 00-85B-3)
Positions 2 - 6       Five zeroes (numeric)
Position 7            Method of Preservation (numeric IAW Section III, TO 00-85B-3)
Position 8            Simple Instruction Code (alpha IAW Section V, TO 00-85B-3)
Positions 9 - 10      Standard pack size code (numeric IAW Section V, TO 00-85B-3)

5.5. SPI Dates. Only current, five-digit “ordinal dates” are used. The ordinal date consists of two charac-
ters for the year followed by three characters for the calendar day of the year (ex. 03147). To date the fast
pack and standard pack SPI number, use the ordinal date on which the item was assigned to the fast pack
or standard pack. The addition or deletion of an item to an existing SPI does not constitute a change in the
SPI ordinal date.

5.6. Distributing Copies of SPIs. Each new or revised SPI is distributed as follows within 5 workdays
of file maintenance action:
   5.6.1. The original is maintained at the responsible ALC packaging management section. One copy is
   sent to the TRC’s packaging management section, and one copy each is sent to the depot preservation,
   packing, container fabrication, and shipment planning functions.
   5.6.2. One copy of each SPI showing a long-life container is sent to AAC/WMOC, Eglin AFB FL
   32542-5313, for inclusion into the CDRS.

5.7. Requests for Copies of SPIs.
   5.7.1. The Special Packaging Instruction Retrieval and Exchange System (SPIRES) (formerly Special
   Packaging Instruction Development and Distribution System (SPIDDS)) consists of over 30,000 Air
   Force Special Packaging Instructions (SPIs). SPIRES can be accessed only through the Internet at
   https://spires.wpafb.af.mil. SPIs can be downloaded directly for viewing and printing. (See Para-
   graph 6.2.)
   5.7.2. Hardcopy SPIs. The responsible ALC packaging management section may also provide hard
   copies of SPIs upon request. Requests for hardcopy SPIs must be submitted by letter or message. Add
   to your request the NSN, SPI number, SPI date, name of requester, and a complete return address. The
   responsible ALC packaging management section will forward the hard copies to the requester within
   30 days of the request. The requester should send a follow-up request if SPI is not received after 30
   days.
28                                                                       AFMCI24-201 14 APRIL 2004


     5.7.3. SPI Audit. To minimize the potential for unnecessary SPI requests, inconsistencies between the
     SCS D035T (PT&RM) and SPIRES systems are minimized by a weekly or daily update process. A
     report generated by SPIRES from the Developer's Menu listed as "Data Inconsistencies" shows the
     differences between the D035T and SPIRES by source of supply (SOS) codes. These discrepancies
     will be corrected as soon as possible by the responsible ALC packaging specialists.

5.8. Marking SPI Containers. The applicable SPI number is marked on the exterior container identify-
ing it as the designated container for shipment and storage of a particular item(s). Fast packs and standard
packs are excluded. Additional marking requirements are determined by the ALC packaging management
sections. Component parts of SPI containers which may be separated from the pack are identified with the
SPI number. Those component parts, such as cushioning and dunnage, are specific to a particular stock
numbered item and sometimes facilitate handling within the repair process.

5.9. Internal Industrial Operations Materials Handling. The ALC packaging management sections'
responsibilities include design and development of material handling devices and/or containers used
within industrial operations. ALC packaging specialists shall work in cooperation with equipment spe-
cialists, engineers, and technicians to determine special item characteristics of prime items as early as
practical in the life cycle of items.
     5.9.1. Material Handling and Technical Assistance Requirements of Prime Items. The ALC packag-
     ing management section provides technical assistance and support to the responsible engineering staff
     to ensure availability of adequate handling devices and/or containers. This is accomplished by assign-
     ing a packaging specialist to work with the product directorates’ engineering functions on actions
     related to improving handling methods and devices. Packaging specialists shall provide the following
     assistance to the product directorates’ engineering functions:
        5.9.1.1. Information regarding special handling instructions for hazardous materials, electrostatic
        sensitive devices, blocking and bracing and other packaging features in accordance with regula-
        tions and limitations of the user.
        5.9.1.2. The development of SPIs to facilitate materials handling within an industrial operations
        environment and as a final pack in the transportation environment.
        5.9.1.3. Guidance pertaining to future transportation, packaging and handling plans to ensure the
        compatibility of each directorate’s handling methods and systems with each other and with the Air
        Force transportation, packaging and handling program.
        5.9.1.4. Information relative to limitations of the existing industrial operations resulting in dam-
        age to assigned prime items.
        5.9.1.5. Surveillance of the industrial operations handling practices and equipment, conducted in
        conjunction with each directorate’s engineering function or their material systems quality control
        program.
AFMCI24-201 14 APRIL 2004                                                                               29


                                                Chapter 6

                                   PACKAGING DATA SYSTEMS

6.1. General. The ALCs and other AFMC activities as applicable, shall use and support approved pack-
aging data systems. Contact the packaging specialist at HQ AFMC/LGRD (Traffic Management Section),
Bldg. 262, Room B113, 4375 Chidlaw Road, Wright-Patterson AFB OH 45433-5006, prior to upgrading
or developing packaging data systems, or prior to developing system applications that impact or interface
with existing packaging data systems.

6.2. Special Packaging Instruction Retrieval and Exchange System (SPIRES). SPIRES is an auto-
mated multi-response system that serves as the Air Force central repository for Air Force-managed SPIs.
SPIs are available 24 hours a day via the Internet. SPIs are in Microsoft Word format and searchable by
NSN/SPI number. SPIRES is a critical link in the distribution of packaging information to the Air Force
DoD components worldwide. (See Paragraph 5.7.1.)
   6.2.1. AFMC-LSO/LOT (Packaging Policy) is responsible for program management of SPIRES. The
   SPIRES server shall be kept operational and upgraded as necessary to ensure acceptable working con-
   ditions to support Air Force SPI requirements.
   6.2.2. AFMC-LSO/LOT (Packaging Policy) is responsible for the operational management of
   SPIRES, which includes system upgrades, performance monitoring, evaluating recommendations to
   enhance customer support and to define future enhancements. In addition, AFMC-LSO/LOT (Packag-
   ing Policy) will conduct periodic working group meetings and assist the ALC/Product Centers' pack-
   aging management sections to ensure efficient operations.

6.3. Computer Aided Design System (CADS). The ALC packaging management sections and other
AFMC activities as appropriate, shall maintain graphics support capability, including drafting, technical
illustration, and CADS. The ALC packaging management sections maintain responsibility for the local
operation of the CADS.
   6.3.1. The CADS is to be used to produce SPIs and technical illustrations for assigned items, and to
   change SPIs which require revision.
   6.3.2. AFMC-LSO/LOT (Packaging Policy) is responsible for the system management of the CADS.
   The equipment shall be kept operational and upgraded as necessary to ensure acceptable working con-
   ditions for the ALC packaging management sections. The AFMC-LSO/LOT (Packaging Policy) is
   responsible for the day-to-day operations of the mainframe CADS, system upgrade, periodic working
   group meetings, and development of system requirements for new equipment, and assists the ALC
   packaging management sections to ensure efficient operations.

6.4. Stock Control System (SCS) D035T Packaging, Transportation, and Regulated Material
(PT&RM) Data System . The ALC packaging management sections' personnel prepare packaging data
(IAW MIL-STD-2073-1) and regulated materials data and enter it into the SCS D035T (PT&RM) data-
base. The ALC packaging management sections' personnel are also responsible for ensuring the accuracy
of contractor-prepared packaging data and regulated materials data, and entering it into the SCS D035T
(PT&RM) database. The SCS D035T (PT&RM) is primarily available at the ALC packaging management
sections and provides on-line capability for interrogations, mass interrogations, data entry and clear text
30                                                                       AFMCI24-201 14 APRIL 2004


interpretations of packaging, transportation, and hazardous materials data. It also produces a number of
reports and other data products (See Paragraph 6.3.4). The point of contact for the SCS D035T
(PT&RM) is HQ AFMC/LGRD, Traffic Management Section.
     6.4.1. User Identifications/Passwords for SCS D035T (PT&RM) Data Entry. The ALC packaging
     management sections and HQ AFMC/LGRD (Traffic Management Section) are the only organiza-
     tions authorized access for packaging data entry purposes. HQ AFMC/LGRD (Traffic Management
     Section) will enter clear text data and common item table updates as revisions to MIL-STD-2073-1
     occur. The ALC packaging specialists shall enter packaging data. All other users have “read only”
     access. Therefore, it is important that ALC packaging specialists and HQ AFMC/LGRD (Traffic
     Management Section) keep the packaging information current, as indicated above.
     6.4.2. Entry of Nonprime Air Force Packaging Data. Storage at any ALC must include prime and
     nonprime items. The ALC packaging specialists may enter data into the blank SCS D035T (PT&RM)
     fields for prime and nonprime items in order to package them for shipment and storage. The prime
     ALC packaging specialist must be notified by a SCS D035T (PT&RM) change notice that a nonprime
     ALC packaging specialist has entered data for an item. The prime ALC packaging specialist may
     either accept or overlay it with their own data. Existing data on a nonprime item may not be changed.
     Contact the prime ALC packaging specialist if changes to existing data are needed.
     6.4.3. Entry of Non-Air Force Packaging Data in SCS D035T (PT&RM). Non-Air Force assets may
     be stored at an ALC. The depot packing activities require access to the packaging data for those items.
     This packaging data is developed by packaging personnel at the managing military service/agency,
     not by AFMC personnel. In order for depot personnel to access the data, it must be resident in SCS
     D035T (PT&RM) or another central system, such as the Federal Logistics Information System (FLIS)
     at Battle Creek, MI. If the non-Air Force data is not resident in the FLIS, the ALC packaging special-
     ists cannot establish the item in SCS D035T (PT&RM) until a cataloging action is accomplished in the
     FLIS. The ALC packaging specialists must enter this data, exercising care to enter it exactly as the
     managing military service/agency has prepared it. To minimize pipeline times, the ALC packaging
     specialists must provide this data entry support expeditiously, usually within 24 hours from the time
     the depot requests it.
     6.4.4. PT&RM Packaging Data Products. SCS D035T (PT&RM) produces the following data prod-
     ucts:
        6.4.4.1. Unmatched Clear Text Summary Report, PCN A-D035T-601-QT-L59, indicates that a
        data code from MIL-STD-2073-1 was interrogated for a clear-text interpretation, but SCS D035T
        (PT&RM) was unable to locate clear text for the code. OO-ALC forwards this product to HQ
        AFMC/LGRD for review to determine if clear-text codes should be added to SCS D035T
        (PT&RM). HQ AFMC/LGRD determines causes for unmatched data (input error, invalid or old
        data code entered, clear-text data not available) and takes appropriate action based on the data
        analysis (add clear-text, alert the responsible ALC packaging management section of any outdated
        data codes, or other appropriate action). This reporting requirement is exempt from licensing in
        accordance with AFI 37-124, The Information Collections and Reports Management Program;
        Controlling Internal, Public and Interagency Air Force Information Collections, Paragraph
        2.11.3.

     AFMC personnel will follow the procedures below when recommending changes to the SCS D035T
     (PT&RM) System:
        6.4.6.1. ALC Users. Document deficiencies or enhancements through the functional OPR
        (FOPR). The user must provide the FOPR with a “screen dump print-out” of all suspected system
        deficiencies and provide them to the FOPR for resolution. The FOPR must attempt to resolve the
        deficiency or contact the SCS D035T (PT&RM) system OPR at HQ AFMC/LGRD. Deficiencies
        may be also submitted by accessing the Automated Problem Reporting System (APRS) (Dimen-
        sions). Submit suggestions for system enhancements to the SCS D035T (PT&RM) system OPR,
        documenting savings, benefits, costs, and any other pertinent information that shall assist the eval-
        uator in determining feasibility for implementation. Submissions may be made through the normal
        correspondence process with the SCS D035T (PT&RM) system OPR or by using AFMC Form
        321, C4 Requirements Document.
        6.4.6.2. HQ AFMC Users. The SCS D035T (PT&RM) system OPR must document/handle sys-
        tem deficiencies in a similar manner as above, by resolving the deficiency at the lowest level or
        submitting it to the APRS (Dimensions). System enhancements received from other activities
        must be evaluated to determine applicability, cost effectiveness and AFMC-wide application. An
        AFMC Form 321 must be prepared by the system OPR and submitted to the SCS D035T
        (PT&RM) SPO for resolution. The SCS D035T (PT&RM) system OPR shall also ensure that
        enhancements are:
        Not duplicative of other PT&RM change requests.
        Not duplicative of ongoing system efforts occurring at higher levels (Air Force/DoD).
        Are appropriately coordinated if impacting other activities such as DLA or FLIS.
        6.4.6.3. Data Products Changes. ALC packaging management sections should notify the SCS
        D035T (PT&RM) system OPR (and FOPR) regarding PT&RM data products that are no longer
        required. The SCS D035T (PT&RM) system OPR will analyze this data, coordinate it with the
AFMCI24-201 14 APRIL 2004                                                                              33


       other users, and contact the SCS D035T (PT&RM) SPO if it is appropriate to delete the products.
       Any new product requirements should be handled in a similar manner.

6.5. Other Hazardous Materials Data System Responsibilities. The responsible ALC packaging man-
agement section has responsibility for entering hazardous materials data into the HMIRS and the DoD
personal computer-performance oriented packaging (PC-POP) system. The responsible ALC packaging
management section must provide all additions, changes, and deletions to the packaging, transportation,
and handling requirements for their prime items.
   6.5.1. The Hazardous Materials Information Resource System (HMIRS). The HMIRS provides tech-
   nical information about the hazardous properties of items managed and used by DoD. It is used as a
   reference in conjunction with, not as a replacement for, existing regulations governing transportation,
   storage, handling, disposal, etc. Additions, changes, or deletions to a HMIRS record identity (i.e.,
   NSN, commercial and government entity (CAGE) code, part number indicator, focal point indicator)
   must be submitted by hard copy to Defense Supply Center (DSCR-VBB), 8000 Jefferson Davis High-
   way, Richmond VA 23297-5607. DSCR-VBB is the functional manager and will provide the required
   format. The program manager for HMIRS is DLA/DLSC, Battle Creek, MI.
   6.5.2. DoD PC-POP-Database. The PC-POP database provides a DoD listing of packaging configu-
   rations meeting the United Nations (UN) performance standards. Additions, changes, and deletions to
   the DoD PC-POP database will be submitted to DDC-TO, 2001 Mission Drive, New Cumberland PA
   17070-5000. Contact them for input format requirements. To add a tested packaging configuration to
   the database, a completed test report must be provided. To change data, submit only the page that con-
   tains the changed data. Recertification test reports must be conducted prior to the expiration date of
   the test report currently loaded in the database. For deletion of data, contact the above address for
   instructions.

                                                Chapter 7

                               PACKAGING DESIGN AND TESTING

7.1. General. The Air Logistics Center (ALC) packaging management sections' test activities are nor-
mally concerned with completed pack tests involving free-fall and rotational type drop tests, and repeti-
tive shock tests. The purpose of these tests is to verify, by means of standard test procedures, new pack
designs. The ALC packaging management sections' test results are recorded on AFMC Form 156, Rough
Handling Performance Test Record, in duplicate. One copy is sent to AFMC-LSO/LOP (AFPTEF), and
one copy is retained by the responsible ALC packaging management section. Some packaging design and
test applications are beyond the capabilities of the ALC packaging management sections. AFMC-LSO/
LOP (AFPTEF) provides in-house capability in these areas.

7.2. Performance Oriented Packaging (POP) Tests. The ALC packaging management sections' test
activities perform in-house POP testing or contract outside laboratories to do required testing. Test results
must be sent for inclusion in the DoD POP data bank in accordance with the instructions provided in
Chapter 6. AFMC-LSO/LOP (AFPTEF) can also perform POP testing and must submit reports as stated
in Chapter 6.

7.3. AFMC-LSO/LOP (AFPTEF) and AAC/WMOC Capabilities. AFMC-LSO/LOP (AFPTEF) and
AAC/WMOC provide in-house engineering capability for packaging design, prototype and testing, with
AAC/WMOC specializing primarily in reusable shipping and storage containers for munitions. AFMC
activities must consider the capabilities available within the Air Force at AFMC-LSO/LOP (AFPTEF)
and AAC/WMOC (CDRS/MO) before contracting out for specialized containers or engineering evalua-
tion. All activities engaged in development or procurement of specialized containers shall send a search
request in accordance with DI-PACK-80683 prior to new container design and DI-PACK-80684
(MIL-STD-2073-1) following new container development, to AAC/WMOC (CDRS/MO) before initiat-
ing a new design or a production program. Use of these activities ensures standardization and promotes
reusability.
     7.3.1. Contact AFMC-LSO/LOP (AFPTEF) at 5215 Thurlow Street, Wright-Patterson AFB OH
     45433-5540.
     7.3.2. Contact AAC/WMOC (CDRS/MO) at Building 614, 102 West D Avenue, Suite 168, Eglin
     AFB FL 32542-5313.

7.4. Using AFMC-LSO/LOP (AFPTEF) and AAC/WMOC (CDRS/MO) Services . A F M C - L S O /
LOP (AFPTEF) and AAC/WMOC (CDRS/MO) work closely together to prevent duplication and to share
technology and the use of either one must be considered in the following areas:
     7.4.1. Long-Life Container Support. AFMC-LSO/LOP (AFPTEF) and AAC/WMOC (CDRS/MO),
     as appropriate, must be notified when long-life, complex, or highly engineered containers are
     required. Review by one of these activities is mandatory on specifications and Statements of Objec-
     tive (SOO) before procuring new design long-life containers. Projects involving long-life containers
     must be coordinated with the ALC item management organization responsible for the item/system
     involved. AFMC-LSO/LOP (AFPTEF) and AAC/WMOC (CDRS/MO) will determine the extent of
     their participation in establishing the design criteria, writing specifications, preliminary design
AFMCI24-201 14 APRIL 2004                                                                              35


   reviews (PDRs) and critical design reviews (CDRs), writing of test plans, evaluation of design, first
   article acceptance, and physical configuration audits which require a major engineering effort.
   7.4.2. Computer Aided Design System (CADS) Engineering Solutions. AFMC-LSO/LOP (AFPTEF)
   is responsible for providing computer-aided engineering investigations and solutions on the CADS
   through finite element modeling and simulated testing programs.
   7.4.3. Standardized Test Methods. AFMC-LSO/LOP (AFPTEF) develops and standardizes test meth-
   ods and procedures to be used by the ALC packaging management sections during evaluation of com-
   pleted pack designs. Standardization is necessary from a single source to provide validity and
   comparability of test results between different AFMC organizations. To achieve standardization of
   test results, it is necessary for AFMC-LSO/LOP (AFPTEF) to approve equipment and instrumentation
   used by the ALC packaging management section for packaging tests. AFMC-LSO/LOP (AFPTEF) is
   responsible for coordinating all test equipment and instrumentation authorizations with the HQ
   AFMC Command Equipment Management Office.
   7.4.4. Using AFMC-LSO/LOP (AFPTEF) Test Services. AFMC-LSO/LOP (AFPTEF) testing ser-
   vices should be considered when:
       7.4.4.1. Testing requirements or problem areas include environmental testing over a long period
       or through use of environmental chambers.
       7.4.4.2. Items require special environmental or transportation protection requirements above
       those normally encountered in a distribution cycle.
       7.4.4.3. Technical or engineering differences exist between the ALC packaging management sec-
       tion and container designers for major systems or equipment.
       7.4.4.4. In-house or field tests of completed packaging systems require instrumentation to moni-
       tor quantitatively the levels of shock and vibration developed on the packaged equipment/mate-
       rial.
       7.4.4.5. Performance design curves are required on package cushioning materials.
       7.4.4.6. Requirements exist to test materials for which AFMC-LSO/LOP (AFPTEF) is the DoD
       lead agency (AFMAN 24-206, Packaging of Materiel).
       7.4.4.7. Testing required exceeds local capabilities.

7.5. Requests for Assistance. Requests for AFMC-LSO/LOP (AFPTEF) assistance must be submitted
on an Air Force Packaging Technology and Engineering Facility (AFPTEF) Engineering Support Request
(Attachment 3). Response to requests for assistance is dependent on manpower, equipment availability,
and project priority. A determination of the action to be taken is provided to the requesting organization
within ten (10) days after receipt of request.

                                                Chapter 8

                        PACKAGING COST REDUCTION AND CONTROL

8.1. General. All ALC packaging management sections are responsible for activating, aggressively pur-
suing, and closely monitoring a continuous program to control and reduce AFMC, Air Force, and DoD
packaging costs.

8.2. Packaging Cost Minimization Program. The successful implementation of a packaging cost mini-
mization program requires the participation and coordination of the ALC packaging management sections
with:
     8.2.1. Components located on the base involved with packaging.
     8.2.2. End users who are involved in physically packaging materiel.
     8.2.3. Personnel involved in acquiring materiel which requires packaging. Efforts must be directed
     toward:
        8.2.3.1. Obtaining optimum packaging design,
        8.2.3.2. Use of new and improved materials and methods,
        8.2.3.3. Use of commercial packaging when it meets anticipated distribution conditions,
        8.2.3.4. Specifying reusable containers and packaging materials whenever practical, and
        8.2.3.5. Careful analysis of packaging costs.
     8.2.4. Actions that ALC packaging management section personnel can take to achieve efficiencies
     include, but are not limited to:
        8.2.4.1. Ensuring that effective and economical materials, processes, and procedures are devel-
        oped for their materiel or systems and are used within contractor facilities. For example, emphasis
        should be placed on eliminating unnecessary use of heavy and costly containers.
        8.2.4.2. Identifying and recommending potential new uses for surplus long-life reusable contain-
        ers to the operating commands in accordance with AFMAN 23-110 (previously AFM 67-1), Vol-
        ume I, Part One, Chapter 10, Section W, Container Management. The CDRS will provide an
        in-depth review of technical data on existing container designs and surplus assets to determine
        their reusability in new defense system acquisitions or existing programs. Cost savings achieved
        through the use of CDRS for the reuse of existing containers or container designs shall be docu-
        mented by the development or procurement activity and a copy of the documentation sent to
        CDRS.
        8.2.4.3. The ALC packaging management section should inform contracting components that it
        can assist in packaging cost analyses. This expertise should be utilized in analyzing and evaluating
        contractor’s proposed packaging charges.

8.3. Packaging Services Contracts (PSC). A packaging services contract should be used when savings
can be effected by removing the packaging requirements from the prime contractor and placing it with
another contractor. When requested by ALC contracting personnel, other commands, services or agen-
AFMCI24-201 14 APRIL 2004                                                                           37


cies, the depot shall provide estimated costs based on PSCs or obtain estimated costs from Defense Dis-
tribution Depot packaging operations.

                                                 Chapter 9

                PREVENTION AND CONTROL OF PACKAGING DEFICIENCIES

9.1. General. Each ALC packaging management section is responsible for establishing and maintaining
a program to minimize deficiencies resulting from improper packaging of items they manage.

9.2. ALC Packaging Management Section Responsibilities. ALC packaging specialists accomplish
the following to minimize packaging damage:
     9.2.1. Review available Standard Form 364, Supply Discrepancy Report (SDR) information copies
     and available data system products to identify trends in packaging deficiencies. Develop, revise, or
     modify packaging requirements if an SF 364 indicates that packaging damage resulted despite com-
     pliance with applicable packaging directives.
        9.2.1.1. Notify the depot packaging organization of the changes to ensure that repackaging is
        accomplished to preclude further packaging damage.
        9.2.1.2. Ensure necessary detailed packaging instructions are provided to using activities when
        deficiencies result from improper packaging to prevent recurrence.
        9.2.1.3. Assist the depot packaging organization in determining the cost of correcting discrepan-
        cies, as requested.
     9.2.2. Take necessary action to correct deficiencies resulting from improper preservation and packing.
     Corrective action can be, but is not limited to:
        9.2.2.1. Training on an individual basis or for packers/workers on protection of particular items.
        This type of training is informal in nature and does not require establishing a formal training pro-
        gram. Any such training or guidance should be accomplished only with the permission or partici-
        pation of the supervisor of the individuals/organization concerned.
        9.2.2.2. Compliance with applicable directives.
        9.2.2.3. The depot packaging office should notify the responsible ALC packaging specialist of
        packaging damage to items despite compliance with applicable directives.
        9.2.2.4. When an SF 364 does not contain sufficient information to readily identify the shipment,
        discrepancy, mode of transportation, etc., request the necessary information by letter or message
        from the initiator of the report. Upon receipt of the corrected SF 364, take action as required.

9.3. Exceptions to Discrepancy Reporting Requirements. SFs 364 are prepared and acted upon
according to AFJMAN 23-215 (formerly AFR 400-15) Reporting of Supply Discrepancies, and the Air
Force Supply Manual, AFMAN 23-110, Volume I, Part One, Chapter 5, Container Management. An SF
364 is prepared for an item not packaged according to applicable packaging instructions even when there
is no item damage. Exceptions to the requirement for an SF 364 when there is no item damage are:
     9.3.1. Packages dated before the current SPI date.
     9.3.2. Contractor (with deviation number) or other service packages are acceptable for reuse if it is a
     reusable, rather than a one-trip container.
AFMCI24-201 14 APRIL 2004                                                                            39


  9.3.3. The responsible ALC packaging specialist must approve the use of a contractor pack by indi-
  cating the prime ALC and a deviation number in the lower right corner of the exterior container
  (example, WR-001).
  9.3.4. When using a contractor pack, annotate “Contractor Pack” on the DD Form 1348-1A, Issue
  Release/Receipt Document, or the condition tag. You can recognize contractor packs by the contrac-
  tor data markings required by MIL-STD-129, such as the purchase or delivery order number and the
  name and address of the contractor.
  9.3.5. The next larger size type I or type II fast pack (A-A-59736 (previously PPP-B-1672), Boxes,
  Shipping, Reusable with Cushioning) can be used for shipments with uniform materiel movement
  and issue priority system (UMMIPS) priority 01-08 if the required type I (vertical) or type II (slide)
  container isn’t available.
  9.3.6. The responsible ALC packaging specialist has approved an alternate pack and provided a devi-
  ation number which is indicated in the lower right hand corner of the exterior container (WR-001).
  9.3.7. You are using larger standard pack containers for shipment of unserviceable items when you
  don’t have the correct size.

                                          ASSISTANCE VISITS

10.1. General. Field assistance visits are customer service calls initiated to help packaging activities
improve the quality of their operations. Assistance visits can provide a valuable means to reduce packag-
ing deficiencies, reduce costs through increased utilization of reusable containers and reclaimed material,
and reduce damage to Air Force materiel and containers. Each ALC packaging management section, in
accordance with local procedures, will establish a means to optimize visits to Air Force activities or con-
tractors within their geographical area. Visits may be conducted in conjunction with center team visits, or
may be conducted independently at the request of the field activity.

10.2. Types of Assistance Visits. There are four types of field assistance visits:
     10.2.1. Normal Logistics Field Visits. Normal logistics field visits to Air Force and ANG activities
     and Security Assistance Program recipient countries worldwide according to policies and procedures
     in the AFMAN 23-110 (formerly AFM 67-1), Volume I, Part One, Chapter 1, Section D, Field Visits,
     and DoD 4140.1-M (formerly AFMCR 400-21), Wholesale Inventory Management and Logistics
     Support of Multiservice Used Nonconsumable Items.
     10.2.2. Special Extended Assistance Visits. Special extended field assistance visits to Air Force and
     ANG activities worldwide according to policies and procedures in AFMAN 23-110, Volume I, Part
     One, Chapter 1, Section D, Field Visits and DoD 4140.1-M.
     10.2.3. Assistance Visits to Contractor Facilities. Assistance visits to CONUS contractor facilities
     according to AFMCI 21-113, Contract Maintenance Programs for Depot Maintenance Activity Group
     (DMAG) (previously Depot Maintenance Business Area (DMBA)).
     10.2.4. Rapid Area Distribution Support (RADS). The RADS program within the Combat Logistics
     Support Squadrons (CLSS) provides transportation personnel (traffic management) assistance at base
     level, other DoD agencies or U.S. Government contract facilities. Transportation personnel are profi-
     cient in traffic management operations to include; freight packaging, heavy crating construction, and
     special packing. Primary missions include; assistance in emergencies, hostilities, unscheduled unit
     deployments, and natural disasters. During hostilities, RADS teams assist in the buildup and support
     of operating bases. In a natural disaster, RADS teams assist in the prompt return of an activity to oper-
     ational status. Assists with abnormal workloads resulting from programmed/non-programmed
     weapon system conversions, major deployments, base activation/de-activation, large packaging tasks,
     re-warehousing projects, etc. Under extraordinary circumstances, requests for temporary manning
     assistance will be considered when an activity cannot meet requirements with their internal personnel
     resources.
        10.2.4.1. The RADS Program is centrally managed at HQ AFMC/LGRC, Wright-Patterson AFB
        OH, DSN 787-6703. All costs associated with RADS assistance to include; travel, per diem, sup-
        plies and miscellaneous equipment, will be absorbed by the requesting organization. All applica-
        ble funding documentation will be submitted to HQ AFMC/LGRC.
        10.2.4.2. Request Procedures/Information.
            10.2.4.2.1. Prioritize and forward requests for RADS assistance and extensions to their
            respective MAJCOM.

10.3. ALC Packaging Management Section Representation :
   10.3.1. A representative of an ALC packaging management section shall participate in assistance vis-
   its to the extent their budgets allow. Length of participation in the visit shall vary, depending upon fac-
   tors such as size of the packaging operation, known degree of packaging proficiency, and known
   problems of the activity being visited.
   10.3.2. If it is not feasible to provide a representative to participate in a center team visit, the
   appointed ALC packaging management section shall furnish necessary information and guidance to
   enable other members of the team to assume responsibilities normally accomplished by that represen-
   tative.

10.4. Responsibilities of the ALC Packaging Specialist. The ALC packaging specialist shall review
packaging, handling, and storage of items according to guidance provided by the managing center. The
primary concern is to reduce damage to serviceable items and the prevention of further damage to service-
able items in their life cycle.
   10.4.1. Prior to participating in an assistance visit, the ALC packaging specialist shall review all
   available data pertinent to the packaging operation and handling methods at the activity to be visited.
   The ALC packaging specialist also collects and reviews all special packaging handling guidance, and
   plans pertaining to items and weapons deployed at the base.
42                                                                      AFMCI24-201 14 APRIL 2004


     10.4.2. The ALC packaging specialist provides guidance and assistance as necessary to improve the
     packaging of Air Force materiel, reduce damage resulting from improper handling, familiarize
     responsible personnel with latest technological improvements, and provide references where latest
     technical information can be obtained. Emphasis is placed on reusing specially-designed containers,
     cushioning, and on protecting unserviceable (reparable) items with necessary protection to prevent
     further deterioration or damage.

10.5. Packaging Checklist. The ALC packaging specialist uses the Packaging Checklist (Attachment
4) as a guide for reviewing a base packaging operation, in addition to any special handling guidance per-
taining to specific items. This list is to be used as a guideline and intended to be all inclusive.

10.6. Findings and Recommendations. Findings and recommendations for action should be docu-
mented in sufficient detail to ensure that the problem is clear and action is taken by the responsible ALC
packaging specialist. Packaging concerns that require HQ AFMC or higher headquarters’ actions should
be formally documented in a letter to HQ AFMC/LGRD, Traffic Management Branch. This letter should
regard specific actions, which have resulted in a high degree of effectiveness, for possible adoption by
other Air Force or DoD activities. A letter of appreciation, or similar recognition, should be forwarded to
these exceptional activities.

10.7. Follow-up. The ALC packaging specialist designated to take corrective action establishes a sus-
pense to ensure the problem is resolved.
AFMCI24-201 14 APRIL 2004                                                                                43


                                               Chapter 11

                             INTERFACE WITH OTHER ACTIVITIES

11.1. General. This chapter outlines packaging interfaces between the ALCs’ packaging management
sections and other Air Force Bases and DoD agencies.

11.2. Base Requests for SPI Packs. When a container or pack prescribed by an SPI has been lost or
damaged and a special packaging design creates an essential requirement that can’t be fabricated by the
base or obtained through local supply channels (GSA, local purchase), bases will submit their require-
ments to the responsible ALC packaging management section.
   11.2.1. All requests for containers must include an information copy to the major command of the
   requesting base and a fund cite to cover materials, labor, and transportation costs. AFI 24-202 contains
   specific guidance on base requests for SPI packs.
   11.2.2. The responsible ALC packaging management section may either grant a waiver from the SPI
   requirements or forward the request to the depot packing function to supply the SPI pack by the most
   economical means. These services should be provided on an exception basis since Air Force funds are
   an issue (the requester must fund the costs associated with the container manufacture, labor, and trans-
   portation costs).
       11.2.2.1. Waivers are required each time a container is used in place of the original SPI. A waived
       container cannot be reused unless another waiver is granted. The waiver number should be placed
       only on a container that is not a SPI. After its use, a waiver number must be obliterated before fur-
       ther use of the container.
       11.2.2.2. Depot packing functions are not staffed nor funded to be a volume manufacturer of con-
       tainers for using activities. Also, some SPIs have design characteristics that are beyond the capa-
       bility of depot packing operations to manufacture and must be procured from commercial sources.
   11.2.3. Based on availability of containers or proximity of the requesting activity to the prospective
   supplier, the responsible ALC packaging management section will do one of the following:
       11.2.3.1. Direct the requestor to the depot packing organization at the managing ALC to supply
       the SPI pack to the requesting activity.
       11.2.3.2. Direct the requestor to the Technology Repair Center (TRC). The TRC requests the pres-
       ervation and packing component to supply the SPI pack to the requesting activity.
       11.2.3.3. Forward a copy of the SPI and redirect the request to the ALC that has geographical
       responsibility for providing technical assistance to the requesting activity. The responsible ALC
       packaging management section requests their depot packing activity to supply the container to the
       requesting activity.
       11.2.3.4. The TRC or ALC that has geographical responsibility will respond to requests by the
       responsible ALC packaging management section to supply SPI packs. If an SPI pack contains a
       special packaging design not normally provided by the activity, the depot packing activity at the
       responsible ALC packaging management section will provide the SPI pack to the requester base
       once a fund cite has been provided to cover container cost, and transportation charges.
44                                                                       AFMCI24-201 14 APRIL 2004


        11.2.3.5. Repeated requests for containers (particularly long-life) will be evaluated. The responsi-
        ble ALC packaging management section should contact the requesting base to determine the cause
        for the repeated requests. Activities must be encouraged to reclaim and reuse containers to the
        fullest extent possible. AF Form 451, Request for Packaging Service, prescribed by AFI 24-202,
        is the vehicle for activities to track container requests. Contact HQ AFMC/LGRD, Traffic Man-
        agement Section, for assistance with repeated requests, if necessary.
        11.2.3.6. When reparable Air Force assets arrive at a Defense Distribution Depot or other DLA
        storage facility from a contractor or user, and the packaging requirements are not complied with,
        the sending contractor or user is responsible for any repackaging costs.

11.3. Support to Other DoD Agencies. Packaging services are developed and performed as specified in
Depot Maintenance Interservice Support Agreements (DMISAs).

11.4. Depot Packaging Organizations. At the ALCs', continuing coordination between the packaging
management sections and depot packing organizations is required. The depot packing functions are
aligned with DLA, but adhere to packaging requirements developed by AFMC when packing Air Force
assets.
     11.4.1. AFMC Consultation Services Provided to Depot Packaging Operations. ALC packaging man-
     agement section personnel will:
        11.4.1.1. Provide technical guidance and assistance to depot packing operations in achieving eco-
        nomical packaging, plan for surge requirements, and other related packaging matters. Continuous
        liaison is required to ensure effective results.
        11.4.1.2. When packaging instructions are not available, provide technical assistance as quickly
        as possible to avoid shipping delays. This technical input will assist DLA in constructing contain-
        ers and applying economical packaging materials, dunnage, processes, and procedures.
        11.4.1.3. Depot packing and crating organizations may recommend changes in container manu-
        facture and construction, packaging instruction, methods, and techniques to ensure proper preser-
        vation and packing of Air Force property. Suggestions that enhance the packaging by improving
        current packaging methods or reduce cost should be adopted. The responsible ALC packaging
        management section will evaluate the packing and crating organization’s suggestions to ensure
        that the integrity of the packaging will be maintained if the suggestion is adopted. However, DLA
        or contracted packing and crating organizations are not to deviate from Air Force prescribed pack-
        aging without first obtaining the consent of the responsible ALC packaging management section.
        11.4.1.4. In the interest of the DoD economies, ALC packaging management section personnel
        should continue to provide depot packing supervisors with information that could help them
        reduce packaging costs. For example, the latest GSA stock list could be used to compare costs of
        different packaging materials which serve similar or identical purposes.
        11.4.1.5. Emphasize reclamation and reuse of containers and packaging material, placing empha-
        sis on retaining specially designed packs for use in reshipment or return of like items. This is a
        function of the CDRS at AAC/WMOC.
        11.4.1.6. Provide guidance and assistance to ensure that only material which is adequately pro-
        tected to withstand local climatic conditions is placed in outside storage.
AFMCI24-201 14 APRIL 2004                                                                              45


     11.4.1.7. The ALC packaging management section will assist the depot packaging function with
     interpretations and guidance concerning packaging data, as needed.
     11.4.1.8. Assist with packaging requirements as requested.
     11.4.1.9. Provide supplemental instructions regarding packaging of disassembled or incomplete
     items in the specified containers. Material deficiency report (MDR) exhibits are an example of
     items subject to disassembly. Supplemental instructions may be included in the SPI when disas-
     sembled turn-ins are expected routinely. When supplemental instructions cannot be provided, the
     responsible ALC packaging management section will review/approve the packaging recom-
     mended by the depot packing component.
  11.4.2. Packaging Materials Reclamation Groups. Packaging materials reclamation groups assure
  coordination between the activities that generate the requirement for reusable packaging materials and
  the activities responsible for reclaiming and reusing them. Periodic meetings with participation from
  appropriate organizations will ensure the continued effectiveness of the reclamation program, thereby
  conserving Air Force and DoD funds.
     11.4.2.1. Membership. Membership on packaging materials reclamation groups should include
     the ALCs’ packaging management sections, depot packaging and storage, product directorates,
     and other ALC and/or tenant organizations as appropriate to each base. A representative from the
     local DRMO may also be included in the working group. Chairmanship should be determined
     locally. Since both AFMC and DLA maintain a vested interest in the reclamation program, it may
     be feasible to rotate or share chairmanship between DLA and AFMC Air Logistics Centers mem-
     bers. If depot personnel do not initiate efforts to convene a joint AFMC/DLA reclamation group,
     the ALCs’ packaging management sections will take the initiative to do so.
     11.4.2.2. Areas to Monitor/Coordinate. The frequency of meetings can be determined locally.
     However, it is advisable to meet at least quarterly (or more frequently, as needed) to set up guide-
     lines and monitor progress in areas such as the following:
         11.4.2.2.1. On-the-job training to ensure containers are opened and unpacked carefully to
         avoid damage to containers/components.
         11.4.2.2.2. Determining which containers and materials are to be reclaimed and which may be
         disposed of by using activities.
         11.4.2.2.3. Ensuring that reclaimed materials are protected from inclement weather during
         recovery, collection and storage.
         11.4.2.2.4. Identifying collecting, screening, and storage sites and ensuring that they are phys-
         ically separated from refuse, DRMO, and supply pickup sites.
         11.4.2.2.5. Responsibility for recovering, collecting, screening, inspecting for assets inadvert-
         ently left in containers, and storing containers and materials.
         11.4.2.2.6. Ensuring that assets found in reclaimed containers are returned to proper account-
         ability and corrective action is taken to prevent disposal of usable assets.
         11.4.2.2.7. Obtaining containers and materials from storage and screening and disposing of
         excess materials.
46                                                                   AFMCI24-201 14 APRIL 2004


        11.4.2.2.8. Ensuring that provisions of AFMAN 23-110 Volume I, Part One, Chapter 10, Sec-
        tion W, Container Management, is followed for long-life containers and TO 00-85B-3, How to
        Package Air Force Spares, is followed for short-life containers.
        11.4.2.2.9. Publicizing the benefits from reclamation of containers and packaging materials.
        11.4.2.2.10. Assisting with accurate calculated cost avoidance realized from reclamation.
     11.4.2.3. Cost Avoidance Calculations. Appropriate reclamation cost avoidance calculations
     include avoidance realized through reused SPI packs, long-life containers, specification contain-
     ers, cushioning material, and repaired wooden pallets. Materials that are saved and eventually dis-
     carded do not contribute to cost avoidance. The cost avoidance is computed by subtracting the cost
     of labor and materials used for refurbishment from the replacement cost. Labor, materials, and
     replacement cost may be established yearly. Other types of cost avoidance may be calculated, but
     not included in packaging reclamation cost avoidance. Other types include: containers, distribu-
     tion of serviceable pallets, recovery of items of supply found in containers, and reused lumber.
     11.4.2.4. Reclamation Group Meeting Minutes. Meeting minutes must be distributed to appropri-
     ate offices and group members. It is advisable to provide a copy of the minutes to AFMC-LSO/
     LOT, Packaging Policy and HQ AFMC/LGRD, Traffic Management Branch.

Container Design Retrieval System (CDRS)—A program that provides a DoD centralized database for
storing, retrieving, and analyzing container designs for the purpose of avoiding duplication in specialized
container design and to promote reuse. MIL-STD-2073-1, Standard Practice for Military Packaging,
DI-PACK-80683, Container Design Retrieval System (CDRS) Search Request, and DI-PACK-80684,
CDRS Data Input, govern the CDRS. This program is located at AAC/WMOC, Attn: CDRS/MO,
Building 614, Biscayne Road, Eglin AFB, FL 32542-6807)”.
Corrosion—Deterioration of material due to electrochemical or chemical attack result from exposure to
natural or induced environmental conditions, or from the destructive attack of fungi or bacteria.
Damage-Breakage, denting, marring, distortion, displacement, or abrasion of an item.—The term
also applies to the malfunction or inaccuracy of an item having mechanically or electrically/electronically
functioning parts or requiring calibration.
Deterioration—The impairment of quality, value, or usefulness of an item.
Electrostatic Discharge (ESD)—A transfer of electrostatic charge between bodies at different
electrostatic potentials, caused by direct contact or induced by an electrostatic field.
Electrostatic Discharge Sensitive (ESDS)—Items-Parts or assemblies that are sensitive to ESD damage.
Fast Pack—A family of standard size, short-life, reusable, cushioned containers. Fast pack design
permits shipment of a large number of different items within certain limits of size, weight, configuration,
fragility, and environmental reacting characteristics. Reference T.O. 00-85B-3, How to Package Air Force
Spares, and PPP-B-1672, Boxes, Shipping, Reusable with Cushioning.
Foam-In-Place (FIP) Packaging—The process for making foam cushions, blocking, and bracing by
combining two or more liquid urethane components. The foam expands 30-100 times its original volume
and encapsulates an article to protect it on all sides. The foam conforms to all shapes and contours of an
item while in the semi-fluid condition before becoming solidified. Barrier material is used to protect
critical surfaces from expanding foam. Reference T.O. 00-85-37, Foam-In-Place Packaging.
FOAM-IN-PLACE IS NO LONGER ROUTINELY CITED BY THE U.S. AIR FORCE AS A
PACKAGING OPTION.
Hazardous Material/Regulated Article—A substance or material which the Secretary of Transportation

determined to be capable of posing unreasonable risk to health, safety, and property when transported in
commerce, and which has been so designated. This includes all items listed as hazardous in Title 49 CFR,
and AFJMAN 24-204.
Hazardous Waste—Any material that is subject to the Hazardous Waste Manifest Requirements of the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as specified in 40 CFR Part 262.
Long-Life Container—A reusable shipping container, usually made of plastic or metal, that is specially
designed to a minimum of 100 round trips or equal to the service life of the item it was designed to
protect. These containers may be refurbished by appropriate maintenance practices to their original
condition and subsequently reused. Long-life containers are usually accountable items of supply and are
beyond the depot/base capability to construct. They shall be stock listed and managed by the activity
assigned item management.
Packaging—Consists of the materiel and methods prescribed in Federal, international, or military
specifications, standards, drawings or other authorized documents designed to provide a specific level of
protection for materiel in transportation or storage. Packaging incorporates the processes and procedures
used to protect materiel from deterioration and damage, and includes cleaning, drying, preserving,
packing, marking, labeling, placarding, unitizing, and containerization.
Packing—Selecting and constructing the shipping container and assembling items or packages therein.
Preservation—Applying protective measures to prevent deterioration, including cleaning, drying, and
the use of preservatives, barrier materials, cushioning, and containers, when necessary.
