This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 44-1, Medical Operations. It
describes procedures for preventing and controlling healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) in
patients, visitors, volunteers and staff (military, civilian, and contract personnel) within any
healthcare setting such as military treatment facilities (MTFs), Limited Scope Military Treatment
Facilities (LSMTFs), Aeromedical Evacuation Squadrons (AESs), Air Reserve Component
(ARC) Medical Units (comprised of Air Force Reserve Medical Units [RMUs] and Air National
Guard Medical Units [GMUs]) and Dental Clinics. It defines the organization, specific
functions, and responsibilities of personnel key to the Infection Prevention and Control Program
and is integral to support home station and expeditionary missions. This instruction applies to all
Air Force military (Active Component Air Force, Air Force Reserve, and Air National Guard)
and Civil Service personnel, contractor personnel, volunteers, and other medical personnel
attached to or assigned to a unit with a medical or aeromedical evacuation mission. The term
“employee” as used in this AFI does not apply to contractor personnel. The term “Healthcare
worker” and the term “personnel” as used in this AFI are presumed to cover contractor personnel
unless otherwise noted. The term “contractor personnel” as used in this AFI includes
subcontractor personnel at any tier. Air Force medical personnel at any level (AF/SG, AFMOA,
MAJCOM/SG, or installation-level) who draft performance work statements (PWSs) for
contracts under which contractor personnel will perform duties within any of the aforementioned
healthcare settings are responsible for ensuring that each such PWS contains provisions that
specifically require the contractor and its personnel, including subcontractors and their personnel
at any tier, to comply with the provisions of this AFI. In the event of a conflict between a
requirement in a services contract and this AFI, the services contract requirement governs the
 2                                                                                 AFI44-108 11 DECEMBER 2014


obligations of the contractor and its personnel. This AFI may be supplemented at any level, but

   guidelines developed by the CDC, ACIP, HICPAC, Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of
   America (SHEA) and other professional organizations.
   2.1.2. Program’s surveillance, prevention, and control activities may be adapted to meet the
   mission and services based on the MTF’s ICRA.
2.2. Program Authority. The MTF's/LSMTF's executive management team oversees the
clinical staff performing the ICF through ECOMS, or equivalent.
   2.2.1. MTF leadership must place an emphasis on the Healthcare Worker’s (HCW) health
   and safety. The MDG leadership must promote a climate of safety within the MTF, in order

      INFECTION PREVENTION AND CONTROL PROCEDURES IN AD MTFS

3.1. Guidelines for the Health and Safety of MTF/LSMTF Personnel. As a component of
force health protection, the following guidelines in their most current edition are utilized as
applicable for the prevention and control of infection in MTF personnel. (NOTE: Issues that
have been recurrent sources of question and concern are specified here).
   3.1.1. CDC and Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC):
   Guideline for Isolation Precautions: Preventing Transmission of Infectious Agents in
   Healthcare Settings.
       3.1.1.1. MTFs/LSMTFs will use Standard Precautions (SP). All blood and body fluids
       are treated as if potentially infectious with a need for heightened concern in environments
       of poor lighting which makes visualization of blood in body fluids uncertain (e.g.,
       aircraft, medical transportation buses, austere ground condition in operational settings).
       (T-0).
          3.1.1.1.1. Hand Hygiene, a component of SP, will be followed per the most current
          CDC and HICPAC: Guideline for Hand Hygiene in Health-Care Settings or the
          WHO: WHO Guidelines on Hand Hygiene in Health Care. (T-0).
          3.1.1.1.2. Respiratory Hygiene/Cough Etiquette will be followed as a component of
          SP. The MTF/LSMTF guidance applies to all persons to include patients, visitors and
          staff who enter a healthcare setting. (T-0).
          3.1.1.1.3. Personnel will wear PPE (e.g., gloves, gowns, goggles, masks) appropriate
          for the task to form a personal barrier of protection for associated exposure risk per
          SP. (T-0).
          3.1.1.1.4. Personnel who manage reusable medical equipment (RME) will be
          provided initial training and follow established procedures based on manufacturer’s
          instructions. They will perform the proper set-up, use, and reprocessing for each type
          of RME in their respective areas of responsibility. Competency will be verified
          annually. (T-0).
       3.1.1.2. MTFs will use transmission-based isolation procedures in any healthcare
       delivery system to include hospitals, clinics, and dental units. (T-0).
          3.1.1.2.1. The three modes of transmission precautions are Airborne, Droplet, and
          Contact Precautions.
          3.1.1.2.2. Protective Environment precautions will be used in acute care hospitals
          that provide care to hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) patients. These
          precautions are designed to prevent HAIs and consist of engineering and design
          interventions that decrease the risk of exposure to environmental fungi for severely
          immunocompromised allogeneic HSCT patients. (T-0).
       3.1.1.3. Guidelines for the Prevention of Multi-drug Resistant Organisms (MDRO)
       Infections and other future CDC/HICPAC focused infectious disease guidelines (e.g.,
       Noro-virus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) are used in combination with the
28                                                         AFI44-108 11 DECEMBER 2014

     against exposure of blood, other body fluids, infectious, and chemical agents from
     contamination of clinical attire, undergarments, skin, eyes, mouth, or other mucous
     membranes under normal conditions of use and for the duration of time which the PPE
     will be used. (T-0).
     3.1.2.3. Personnel will wear protective outer garments (e.g., fluid resistant gowns,
     laboratory coats, cotton or cotton/polyester scrubs when sleeve length is long, scrub
     jackets) that must prevent contamination of clinical attire, undergarments or skin and are
     worn appropriate for the task being performed based upon the type of exposure and
     quantity of these substances reasonably anticipated to be encountered during the
     performance of a task or procedure. Scrubs are not considered PPE. (T-0).
     3.1.2.4. Safety designed devices are considered and will be made available based on
     work practices, reported exposure trends, and the applicable laws or regulations of the
     state for any individual MTF/LSMTFs/Dental Unit. (T-0).
     3.1.2.5. Occupational exposure to blood or other potentially infectious materials (OPIM):
        3.1.2.5.1. Healthcare Workers (HCW) exposed to blood and OPIM will be evaluated
        and managed IAW 29 CFR 1910.1030, Bloodborne Pathogens. Procedures for
        exposure incidents will be outlined in detail in the MTF/LSMTF/ Dental Unit
        Exposure Control Plan. (T-0).
        3.1.2.5.2. HCWs with a sharps injury, blood or OPIM exposure will promptly wash
        the exposed site with soap and water. If the eye or mucous membrane is exposed to
        blood or OPIM, flush profusely with copious amounts of water. The HCW must
        report exposures to their supervisor and seek post-exposure evaluation and treatment
        from a privileged provider. (T-0).
        3.1.2.5.3. HCWs will have access to an immediate 24-hour rapid response system
        that includes adequate communication to a medical team trained to triage all
        exposures and assess the need for post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). If PEP is
        deemed necessary, it is recommended to be administered as soon as possible within
        hours of exposure incident and per OSHA and CDC guidelines. (T-0).
AFI44-108 11 DECEMBER 2014                                                                   29


        3.1.2.5.4. The HCW will describe and document the circumstances surrounding the
        incident on the appropriate mishap report form and the exposure incident
        worksheet/investigation      form     approved    by      the    MAJCOM       and/or
        MTF/LSMTFs/Dental Unit. In addition, the HCW must provide the necessary
        information to PH and the treating provider to facilitate complete documentation and
        investigation of the incident. (T-0).
           3.1.2.5.4.1. Federal civilian employees, in conjunction with their supervisor,
           should report injuries by completing the Form CA-1, Federal Employee's Notice
           of Traumatic Injury and Claim for Continuation of Pay/Compensation. Civilians
           may complete Form CA-16, Authorization for Examination And/Or Treatment,
           should they wish to seek treatment at a civilian location.
        3.1.2.5.5. The supervisor of the exposed HCW will notify PH of the injury or
        exposure and assist the employee with the following items: (T-0).
           3.1.2.5.5.1. Ensure the source is fully evaluated by their provider to assess risk of

     DoD), or in the case of contractor personnel, prior to commencing performance of
     contractual duties in an Air Force healthcare setting, all HCWs must produce
     documentation of an appropriate TB test protocol (either the two-step tuberculin skin test
     (TST), or an approved blood assay for TB screening) that was performed within the
     previous 12 months. New employees or contractor personnel without documented
     history of a TB test within 12 months should have either the two- step TST or blood TB
     assay performed. HCWs with a positive TST will be appropriately followed IAW Air
     Force and other regulatory agency guidelines. Routine TB screening need not be
     accomplished on HCWs who transfer between low-risk AF/DoD facilities. (T-0).
     3.2.2.5. Varicella vaccine. All HCWs require proof of immunity in accordance with
     current ACIP recommendations. If verification of a history of varicella disease or herpes

       3.6.5.1. Bleach, as the only ingredient, will not be used as a primary hospital grade
       disinfectant in the MTF. It lacks detergent and may be corrosive to some surfaces.
       (NOTE: there are many commercially available products that combine bleach or chlorine
       compounds with other chemicals that may be used as a primary hospital grade
       disinfectant. Follow the manufacturer's guidelines for use). (T-0).
       3.6.5.2. Bleach may be used in Nutritional Medicine as a disinfectant.
       3.6.5.3. Bleach may be used as an additional disinfection step if deemed necessary and
       approved by the ICF (e.g., due to its highly effective kill of enterovirus, and spore
       forming bacteria [e.g., Clostridium difficile, Bacillus anthracis]). The surface is first
       cleaned with a detergent or detergent/disinfectant, allowed to dry, and then followed by a
       disinfection of the appropriately mixed bleach and water solution.
       3.6.5.4. Spore Forming Bacteria. A chlorine based disinfectant (e.g., bleach) is effective
       if used IAW the manufacturer’s guidance in destroying spores formed by organisms such
       as Bacillus anthracis and Clostridium difficile. A chlorine based disinfectant may be
       used to disinfect any environment in which patients who are infected with a spore
       forming organism is admitted.
          3.6.5.4.1. Use of diluted hypochlorite (e.g., 1:10 dilution) solution will be considered

          sterilizer and transport to the point of use (e.g., transported in a sterile covered
          container).
          3.7.2.9.3. Semicritical instruments that will be used immediately or within a short
          time can undergo flash sterilization on a tray or in a container system, provided that
          the instruments are handled aseptically during removal from the sterilizer and
          transport to the point of use. (T-0).
          3.7.2.9.4. Do not flash sterilize implantable devices.
       3.7.2.10. Testing Automated Cleaning Equipment.
          3.7.2.10.1. Test automated cleaning equipment (e.g. ultrasonic cleaners, instrument
          washer, thermal disinfectors) upon initial installation, weekly during routine use, and
          after major repairs IAW AAMI and American Association of Operating Room Nurses
          (AORN) Standards.
          3.7.2.10.2. Results of these tests should be included as a component of the instrument
          processing quality assurance program.
              3.7.2.10.2.1. Commercially available tests are available to evaluate variables such
              as water pressure, temperature, pH, and drying. These tests do not replace the
              requirement to visually inspect instruments after cleaning.
              3.7.2.10.2.2. Users must continue to follow the cleaning equipment manufacturer
              operating and maintenance instructions, including instrument loading procedures,
              which is critical to the success of the cleaning process. (T-0).
              3.7.2.10.2.3. Due to the variety of brands and models of instrument
              washer/disinfectors available, it is recommended to first contact the manufacturer
              of your equipment to see if they offer or recommend a specific washer test kit. If
              a test kit from a manufacturer other than the equipment manufacturer is
              purchased, it is recommended to discuss the specific type of equipment in use at
              your facility (e.g., type, brand name, model of instrument washer) with the washer
              test kit manufacturer/distributor before purchasing any new products.
3.8. Event Related Sterility. Use event-related sterility whenever possible. This practice
recognizes that the product should remain sterile until some event compromises the integrity of
the package (e.g., it becomes torn, wet by body fluids/water/antiseptics, dropped on a
contaminated surface, presence of dried antiseptics, or yellowing caused by extremes in
temperature).
3.9. Reprocessing Single Patient Use Items. Reprocessing of disposable supplies and
equipment items labeled as “single patient use only” will not occur in the MTF/ARC Medical
Units/Dental Clinics. Reprocessing may occur by a third party reprocessing company that
follows the FDA Good Manufacturing Practice Guidelines and is a member of Association for
Medical Device Reprocessors (AMDR). (T-0).
3.10. Storage of Clean and Sterile Supplies.
   3.10.1. Storage areas will be in a clean, organized, environmentally controlled location. (T-
   0).

  3.10.2. Like items will be stored together (e.g., sterile with sterile and clean with clean).
  Store liquids on lower shelves or in containers that will hold the volume of the primary
  container if it should leak to prevent compromise to other supplies stored next to or below.
  (T-0).
     3.10.2.1. Sterile and nonsterile patient treatment items may be stored in the same drawers
     or cabinets as long as there is no possibility of similar nonsterile items being used
     inadvertently when sterility (e.g., sterile 4x4s and clean 4x4s) is required and the items
     are kept separated by wipeable dividers or containers.
     3.10.2.2. All supplies will be rotated using a first in, first out plan so that older items are
     used first, thus preventing waste due to expiration. (T-0).
     3.10.2.3. Supplies will be stored 8-10 inches above the floor (permits adequate cleaning
     of the floor), 18-20 inches below the ceiling (away from vents, fire sprinklers, and lights
     to safeguard supplies from damage and for compliance with the National Fire Protection
     Association [NFPA] 101, Code for Safety to Life from Fire in Buildings and Structures
     [The Life Safety Code]) and approximately 2 inches from an outside wall (to protect
     package integrity and permit air circulation). (T-0).
     3.10.2.4. Supplies will not be stored or piled on top of plastic covered racks, above
     cabinets, or in any other manner that may be deemed unsafe. (T-0).
     3.10.2.5. Do not store sterile supplies or patient care items under the sink (or any
     location where they may become wet), on the floor, windowsills, or any area other than
     designated shelving or cabinets.
     3.10.2.6. Do not store sterile items with items not intended for clinical use (e.g., office
     supplies, cleaning supplies).
     3.10.2.7. No shipping boxes will be brought into patient care areas in the MTF, except to
     deliver supplies which are promptly placed into an appropriate clean storage bin. (T-0).
         3.10.2.7.1. External shipping containers/boxes are exposed to unknown and
         potentially high microbial contamination. Those made of corrugated material are
         especially susceptible and also act as reservoirs for dust. They are potentially laden
         with contamination from animal urine and feces which may serve as a mode of
         transmission of diseases associated with such contamination.
         3.10.2.7.2. Shipping containers/boxes potentially house vectors such as roaches.
         3.10.2.7.3. Interior boxes may be used to store a supply item, but are discarded when
         the last item is used and not restocked or “reused” to store other items. (T-2).
     3.10.2.8. Rubber bands will not be used to bundle items in soft packaging like peel packs
     together, they may compromise the integrity of the package. (T-0).
     3.10.2.9. Chux or cloth towels will not be used to line drawers or shelves. (T-3).
     3.10.2.10. Supply levels will be realistic and maintained in a sufficient quantity to serve
     the patient care demands. (T-1).
     3.10.2.11. All supplies will be checked at point of use for expiration dates and for any
     event that may have compromised the integrity of the package (e.g., it becomes torn, wet
AFI44-108 11 DECEMBER 2014                                                                   41


      by body fluids/water/antiseptics, dropped on a contaminated surface) before it is used for
      a patient. (T-0).
      3.10.2.12. Personnel will check all medical supplies monthly for expiration dates and
      discard expired items per MTF policy. Those items without an expiration date are
      considered to be sterile until some event compromises the integrity of the package under
      the event related sterility system. Refer to paragraph 3.8. of this instruction. (T-0).
3.11. Linen.
   3.11.1. The IP will review the linen contract annually. (T-0).

      3.11.1.2. The IP will tour the linen facility with the Linen QAE, prior to contract award
      for locally purchased contracts and annually thereafter, to evaluate and ensure the
      practice is IAW the scope of work for the contract. (T-1).
      3.11.1.3. The IP may use an annual linen facility inspection report from another IP
      whose MTF has a contract with the same laundry facility and if the inspection was
      conducted using the CDC Guidelines for Environmental Infection Control in Health-Care
      Facilities and the Healthcare Laundry Accreditation Council’s (HLAC) most current
      guidelines (Accreditation Standards for Processing Reusable Textiles for Use in
      Healthcare Facilities). The MTF that is providing the report will address any
      discrepancies uncovered during the inspection and provide follow-up reports to the MTF
      they are sharing the inspection report with. The report must address, at a minimum, the
      items listed below in paragraph 3.11.2.1-8. (T-0).
   3.11.2. All laundry facility personnel must: (T-0).
      3.11.2.1. Receive orientation and annual training in infection prevention and control
      IAW OSHA requirements (e.g., BBP, PPE, post-exposure procedures, hand hygiene, TB)
      through their company.
      3.11.2.2. Comply with OSHA BBP-ECP, TB prevention, employee health program, and
      hand hygiene program.

      provide appropriate packaging of linen.
      3.11.2.7. Report any sharps found when separating contaminated linen to prevent
      exposures to personnel. Ensure discovery is communicated to the MTF where the linen
      was collected. (NOTE: A sample inspection checklist is located on the Kx IC website
      under surveillance that may need to be updated with current guidelines). (T-0).
      3.11.2.8. The IP will report findings and any recommendations to the ICF. (T-1).
 42                                                           AFI44-108 11 DECEMBER 2014


   3.11.3. All clean linen will be transported and stored in carts used exclusively for this
   purpose or in linen carts that were cleaned and disinfected after being used to transport soiled
   linen. (T-0).
       3.11.3.1. Clean linen will be stored in clean storage areas (e.g., dedicated linen rooms
       with closing door, covered carts, closed drawers or cabinets). (T-0).
       3.11.3.2. Clean linen remains protected until the point of use.
   3.11.4. Soiled linen will be handled in a manner that minimizes dispersal of particles into the
   air and surrounding area. (T-0).
       3.11.4.1. Soiled linen will be placed in a rolling type hamper at the patient’s bedside or
       after use in a clinic. This will eliminate hand carrying by personnel down the corridors to
       a collection hamper. (T-0).
       3.11.4.2. Any linen that is extremely soiled or wet may be wrapped loosely in clean linen
       or placed directly in a plastic bag then into the linen hamper.
   3.11.5. Linen hamper covers may be used for aesthetic purposes in traffic areas; if used, they
   must be kept clean. (T-0).
   3.11.6. Linen will not be rinsed or sorted in MTFs that have a linen contract. (T-0).
   3.11.7. Double bagging of soiled linen is not required unless the first bag has been damaged
   or is leaking.

   code soiled linen into special bags based on isolation or amount of contamination. Must
   comply with applicable state or host nation requirements. (T-0).
   3.11.9. Soiled linen will not be placed in red bags unless it is intended to be disposed of as
   regulated medical waste. (T-0).
3.12. Regulated Medical Waste (RMW). RMW will be handled IAW applicable state or host
nation laws governing the disposal of such waste. (NOTE: If host nation standards are less
stringent than what would normally be adhered to in the U.S., personnel will hold to the more
stringent standard except as otherwise directed by the Command/Task Force Surgeon’s authority
in expeditionary operations). (T-0).
3.13. HAMS/Clinic Housekeeping Contracts.
   3.13.1. HAMS contracts are centrally managed by HQ AFMSA/SGSLC and centrally
   procured by a single contracting office. Clinic Housekeeping contracts may be procured by
   local base contracting.
       3.13.1.1. The contract specifies the contractor that will provide cleaning to achieve an
       environment of “total clean,” ensuring the proper level of asepsis. (T-1).
       3.13.1.2. Housekeeping personnel are employees of the civilian contract company.
       3.13.1.3. Appropriate ongoing, documented training of housekeepers is provided by the

   property and equipment unless it is attached to a patient. (T-1).
AFI44-108 11 DECEMBER 2014                                                                    43


     3.13.2.1. Any equipment not to be cleaned by housekeeping personnel is referenced in
     the Individual Medical Facility Exhibit (IMFE).
     3.13.2.2. If an individual MTF, or section therein, determines that a specific piece of
     medical equipment should not be cleaned by housekeeping they must notify the
     Housekeeping QAE to update the IMFE. (T-0).
  3.13.3. The ICF reviews housekeeping policies, procedures, and cleaning agents annually.
  (T-1).
  3.13.4. Section managers (e.g., OIC, NCOIC, or designee in charge) will insure
  housekeeping personnel are appropriately informed of any patients with infectious or
  communicable disease or patients which have been placed in Protective Environment
  precautions. Posting of appropriate isolation or precaution signs is an effective method of
  communication. (T-1).
  3.13.5. The FM manages the housekeeping function if performed “in-house” and serves as
  the QAE of the housekeeping contract. AFI 41-201, Managing Clinical Engineering
  Programs, Section 4.19, addresses the FM’s role in housekeeping functions and with the
  ICF.
     3.13.5.1. Contract surveillance is a responsibility of a QAE assigned to Facility
     Management.
     3.13.5.2. QAEs are the only MTF agents authorized as liaisons between the users and

     to the QAE. (T-1).
  3.13.6. Housekeeping Customer. The employees, patients, and visitors of the MTF are the
  customers of the contract.
     3.13.6.1. The OIC, NCOIC or civilian equivalent for each MTF functional area conducts
     informal visual inspections on a regular basis (e.g., weekly, daily when the clinic is open)
     and completes the facility customer complaint form if work is not completed to their
     satisfaction. (T-2).
     3.13.6.2. Observed deficiencies will be documented on the facility customer complaint
     form; one copy will be maintained and the rest of the copies are given to the QAE. (T-1).
     3.13.6.3. The QAE will validate the customer complaint IAW the performance work
     statement (PWS). (T-1).
     3.13.6.4. Discrepancies listed must be specific and include a description of the problem,
     facility room number (e.g., 1H30), the name and phone number of the person reporting
     the problem. (T-1).
     3.13.6.5. Customers will not contact the contractor or housekeeping personnel directly
     when a customer complaint form is written due to repeated or flagrant lapses in contract
     performance, except for emergency services. (T-1).
 44                                                          AFI44-108 11 DECEMBER 2014


       3.13.6.6. Customers will coordinate with the contractor to provide access to various
       rooms for which the contractor does not have access and for areas in which access must
       be closely monitored. (T-1).
       3.13.6.7. All tasks are performed with minimum interruption to patient care.
   3.13.7. Emergency Service Response Procedures. Blood or body fluid spills are considered
   an emergency and housekeeping responds promptly to clean the area. If housekeeping
   service is not immediately available, HCWs may be taught to clean the spill following the
   guidelines of 29 CFR Part 1910.1030, Occupational Exposure to Bloodborne Pathogens;
   Final Rule.
3.14. Ventilation.
   3.14.1. The FM will coordinate the monitoring of ventilation pattern (air flow pressure and
   air exchanges per hour) within the MTF. (T-2).
       3.14.1.1. Areas to be tested include, but are not limited to: the ORs, delivery rooms,
       Central Sterile Supply, negative pressure/airborne isolation rooms, autopsy areas, minor
       surgical rooms, cardiac catheterization labs, interventional radiology suites, dental
       instrument processing areas, rooms where glutaraldehyde is in use, and any other rooms
       deemed appropriate by the ICF based on the design or use of the room and/or building
       (refer to the American Institute of Architects Guidelines for Design and Construction of
       HC Facilities for vent requirements).

                        SURVEILLANCE POLICIES FOR AD MTFS

4.1. Requirements.
   4.1.1. AFMS directed that all MTFs with intensive care units will implement the Institute for
   Healthcare Improvement (IHI) Central Line Bundle per the 14 November 2007/SG3 Doc: 07-
   115. IHI defines the Central Line Bundle as a group of evidence based interventions for
   patients with intravascular central catheters that, when implemented together, result in better
   outcomes than when implemented individually. (T-0).
   4.1.2. AFMS directed     that all MTFs with intensive care units will implement the IHI
   Ventilator Bundle per    the 14 November 2007/SG3 Doc: 07-115. The IHI defines the
   Ventilator Bundle as     a series of interventions related to ventilator care that, when
   implemented together,    will achieve significantly better outcomes than when implemented
   individually. (T-0).
   4.1.3. Health Affairs has directed that all inpatient MTFs within the Military Health System
   (MHS) with intensive care units will implement the CDC NHSN Device Associated
   surveillance for the Central Line-Associated Bloodstream Infection (CLABSI) Events,
   Ventilator-Associated Events (VAEs) and Catheter-Associated Urinary Tract Infections
   (CAUTI) per the HA POLICY: 12-005, Reporting Infection Control Data to the Centers for
   Disease Control and Prevention Using the National Healthcare Safety Network, 22 May
   2012. (T-1).
4.2. Definition. Surveillance is defined as the systematic collection, analysis, interpretation, and
dissemination of data regarding a health-related event for use in public health action to reduce
morbidity and mortality and to improve health. IPs use this definition to reduce and prevent
HAIs and to enhance the safety of patients, HCWs and visitors in a timely and cost-efficient
manner.
4.3. Surveillance Appropriate to MTF.
   4.3.1. Surveillance will not be performed just for the sake of surveillance. (T-0).
   4.3.2. Surveillance must be tailored by each MTF/LSMTF to maximize resources to focus
   on population characteristics, outcome priorities, to monitor a process and organizational
   objectives as determined by the MTF’s ICRA and as directed by DoD or AFMS. The goal is
   to look at processes and outcomes that may have significant impact on patient care practices,
   employee health, and safety (e.g., survey laboratory results for epidemiologically significant
   pathogens such as MRSA to ensure providers have access to resistance patterns that will
   impact antibiotic prescribing practices; survey employee exposures to ensure work practices
   are safe; or appropriate safety devices are available for the task the healthcare worker is
   performing). (T-0).
4.4. Surveillance Activities in Annual ICPP. Surveillance activities are defined in the ICPP
which must be unique for each organization, but will incorporate the seven core APIC
Recommended Practices for Surveillance: (T-0).
46                                                           AFI44-108 11 DECEMBER 2014


  4.4.1. Assess the population and/or areas to be surveyed (e.g., all inpatients who have a
  cholecystectomy; all employees who are responsible for the cleaning/disinfection of the
  endoscope; any patient admitted to an ICU with a central line; most frequently performed
  surgical or other invasive procedure; and all applicable work areas).
  4.4.2. Select the outcome or process to be surveyed (e.g., all outpatient Gastrointestinal [GI]
  endoscopic procedures; epidemiologically significant pathogens such as healthcare-
  associated Vancomycin Resistant Enterococci [VRE] or MRSA; surgical site infections or
  device-associated infections like VAEs using NHSN; knowledge of how to clean-up blood
  spills or what to do if personnel sustain an exposure to blood or body fluids; frequency of the
  event; compliance to regulatory or accrediting body requirements; appropriate storage of
  supplies; visual observation of personnel administering immunizations; interviewing staff
  regarding their knowledge of standard precautions and isolation of contagious patients).
  4.4.3. Use clearly defined written definitions, particularly standardized written definitions
  when available. All data elements should be clearly defined to include length of time the
  item will be surveyed (e.g., quarterly, twice a year, and annually) dependent on what you are
  surveying (e.g., CDC case definitions of Surgical Site Infection [SSI]; IHI bundles; or the
  steps in the process like biological indicators). When appropriate, recommend the use of the
  CDC definitions. (T-0).
  4.4.4. Data collection should be managed by knowledgeable professionals qualified by
  training, experience, and access to appropriate information sources (e.g., prospective review
  of patient record; lab results; prescribed antibiotics; electronic records, visual observation of
  personnel who perform the cleaning of endoscopes).
  4.4.5. Calculating and analyzing surveillance rates (if any). Outcome measures examples:
  Surgical Site Infection (SSI) rates; device specific incidence; blood or body fluid exposure
  incident. Process measure examples: immunization rates; surgical antibiotic prophylaxis
  timing; device utilization ratio; rate of compliance to the IHI bundles or hand hygiene
  protocol; compliance with appropriate storage of sterile supplies.
     4.4.5.1. Any rate comparison will be IAW the definition used. (NOTE: It may be
     appropriate to perform statistical comparisons between the MTF rate and the comparison
     rate, [e.g., a Z-statistic, 95% confidence interval or a Fisher exact test] [see APIC Text of
     Infection Control and Epidemiology, Chapter 5]). (T-0).
     4.4.5.2. Provider-specific rates or trends will be presented to their Division or Service
     Chief/Medical Director and Flight Commander when appropriate. (T-1).
  4.4.6. Risk stratification will be applied when appropriate (e.g., CDC NHSN risk
  stratification [CDC wound class, length of surgery, and American Society of
  Anesthesiologists (ASA) preoperative assessment score, in NICU surveillance by birth
  weight]. Risk category rates should be compared to CDC NHSN system data and to the
  internal rates of the previous year). (T-0).
  4.4.7. Reporting and feedback. Quarterly reports will be presented to the ICF and forwarded
  to ECOMS, or equivalent. Service specific rates and provider specific rates will be provided
  to respective flight commanders, when applicable. (T-0).
AFI44-108 11 DECEMBER 2014                                                                     47


      4.4.7.1. Rates exceeding established thresholds will be carried as ICF agenda items to
      ensure follow-up at subsequent meetings. (T-0).
      4.4.7.2. Develop a written report to provide a means to interpret and disseminate the
      surveillance data to the recipients who provide the service or procedures being surveyed
      and can bring about process improvement activities. Always report all surveillance
      activities to the ICF. Other recipients to be considered, but are not all inclusive, may
      include: ECOMS, or equivalent, Nursing Executive Function, Environment of Care
      Committee (EOC), PS, and PH.
4.5. Surveillance Reports.
   4.5.1. Will be submitted to the ICF, per the ICPP, for review and recommendations. For
   LSMTFs, the surveillance data will be submitted to ECOMS, or equivalent. (T-0).
   4.5.2. Will be provided as feedback to the provider(s) or HCW(s) who perform the service(s)
   or processes being surveyed. (T-0).
   4.5.3. Will be used as an opportunity to improve patient/employee/process outcome(s). (T-
   0).
   4.5.4. If an outcome or process has remained stable or unchanged over an extended period of
   time (e.g., 6 months), consider discontinuing the surveillance, or reduce the length of time to
   survey an item or perform a smaller sample size instead, such as 10%. This will allow the
   resources to be applied to another process or outcome which poses a higher priority.
   Document in ICF minutes and adjust the ICPP as appropriate. LSMTFs will document in the

                                            Chapter 5

                    OPERATIONAL AND SPECIAL ENVIRONMENTS

5.1. Purpose.
   5.1.1. Managing Suspected Highly Communicable Diseases.
       5.1.1.1. AFI 41-307, Aeromedical Evacuation Patient Considerations and Standards of
       Care, contains guidelines that direct the movement regulation of the suspected casualties
       or HCWs who may exhibit clinical indicators of a Bioterrorism agent and/or a highly
       communicable disease from the CDC critical list (CL).
       5.1.1.2. All medical personnel will be aware of the clinical indicators and the reporting
       categories that may indicate a casualty or that medical personnel may be infected with a
       highly infectious disease or biological agent. (T-1).
5.2. Goal. To generate a heightened awareness of infection prevention and control issues to be
considered in the deployment of medical personnel for both home station and expeditionary
operations. Identifying and treating emerging infectious disease, whether natural or manmade,
must become second nature as we strive to provide the best prevention advice and medical care
possible for both domestic and foreign troops as well as civilians. Basic principles of infection
prevention and control such as hand washing, aseptic technique, standard precautions, isolation,
and PPE become more, not less, important in field conditions. This guideline will assist in
identifying important issues and possible solutions for the field environment but because each
mission is unique it is not possible to cover all contingencies. (T-0).
5.3. General Roles and Responsibilities.
   5.3.1. All personnel will practice basic infection prevention and control techniques per
   paragraph 3.4. (T-0).
   5.3.2. BE will provide water source recommendations and testing IAW AFI 48-144. (T-1).
5.4. Patient Care Practices.
   5.4.1. Comply with hand hygiene guidelines per CDC or WHO depending on the availability
   of running water. (T-0).
   5.4.2. PPE has an increased significance during deployment based on diseases endemic to
   the given area. These may include the bloodborne pathogens HIV, Hepatitis B and C and
   other communicable diseases (refer to the PH deployment briefing).
5.5. Patient Placement.
   5.5.1. Patient placement options can be limited by space constraints or the physical set up of
   unit. Isolation strategies may be greatly affected by these constraints. It is important to try to
   geographically separate a patient who needs isolation. To decrease the possibility of disease
   transmission, group patients with like symptoms and also cohort the staff assigned to these
   patients (especially during outbreaks).
   5.5.2. Airborne. A negative airflow room is preferred to vent the airborne particles out of
   the work area to allow the ultra violet (UV) rays from the sun to kill the Mycobacterium
AFI44-108 11 DECEMBER 2014                                                                       49


   tuberculosis and other airborne pathogens while any wind currents will further dilute the
   organisms reducing the probability of exposure to others.
   5.5.3. Droplet precautions. Patient beds will be placed at least four (4) feet apart (from
   mattress to mattress) (or as directed by the CDC) when possible. If a four (4) foot separation
   is not possible, consider having the patient wear a mask and augment with head-to-toe bed
   configuration. The patient should also wear a mask during any transport. The patient may
   wear a surgical mask (recommend the cup style due to its fit) when personnel are in the area.
   If possible, group individuals with like-symptoms together and assign cohort staff to care for
   these infected patients, especially during outbreaks. (T-0).
   5.5.4. Contact precautions. The goal is to keep post-operative patients and patients with
   invasive lines (IV, drainage tubes, indwelling catheters) away from patients placed on contact
   isolation precautions. If possible, group individuals with like-symptoms together and assign
   cohort staff to care for these infected patients, especially during outbreaks.
5.6. Supplies and Equipment.
   5.6.1. Supplies and equipment will be stored in a way that will protect them from extremes
   in temperature (heat or cold), environmental dust and dirt, vermin and insects, light and
   moisture. Seasonal variations may mean a change in storage practices or location during a
   rainy season, winter or summer seasons. Listed are some examples of creative ways to help
   organize and keep the storage area clean. (T-1).
      5.6.1.1. Pallets will be placed over gravel at the entrance of the storage area to be used to
      kick mud and dirt off of boots before entering. (T-1).
      5.6.1.2. The footlocker-type of transport boxes, in which many supplies arrive, can be
      used as shelves. Place the lid on the ground and place the box on its side. Store those
      items that can be cleaned and dried (non-critical items like bedpans) on the bottom in
      case the area floods. Keep the sterile and clean packaged items up higher.
      5.6.1.3. Be aware of lumber that can be transformed into shelves. Wood is porous so
      only non-critical items should be placed on the wood. Protect the other items in plastic as
      much as possible. Save all plastic wrappers to be used as covers when needed. A change
      in the weather or a seasonal abundance of a particular insect could warrant a need for
      different levels of protection.
          5.6.1.3.1. Cleaning of supplies and equipment is required and the disinfectant used
          may vary. Bleach is the most common but in many ways the most hazardous if not
          mixed correctly. Manufacturer’s directions for the use of chemicals will be followed
          whenever possible. Preferably, the disinfectant will be tuberculocidal because it is
          likely it will also kill Hepatitis B and C and HIV. (T-0).
          5.6.1.3.2. Monitor stock levels to determine the need to conserve certain non-critical
          items that come into contact with intact skin, such as bedpans, urinals, or washbasins.
          If so, these items can be washed with soap and water then disinfected with a diluted
          bleach solution or another disinfectant after each use. Store in plastic if available, but
          if not available, store in a clean place. Before using the item, make sure any dust that
          may have collected during storage is cleaned off with soap and water.
 50                                                         AFI44-108 11 DECEMBER 2014


          5.6.1.3.3. Urinals and bedpans will be rinsed after each use with water. Those used
          for more than one week will be washed with a detergent. If a patient has diarrhea,
          rinse the bedpan out with soap and water and then rinse with a disinfectant after each
          use. (T-1).
5.7. Environmental Controls.
   5.7.1. All personnel will be responsible for the cleaning and upkeep of the healthcare
   environment. Housekeeping contractors may not be available. If available, they likely will
   be from the local civilian population and may have limited knowledge. A cleaning schedule
   will be designed and followed. (T-0). Listed below are some basic cleaning principles:
      5.7.1.1. Work site should be maintained in a clean sanitary condition. A cleaning
      schedule must be determined, implemented, and strictly enforced to maintain a standard
      of cleanliness. Cleaning follows a workflow pattern which moves from the least soiled
      areas to the most soiled areas and from the ceiling to the floor. (T-1).
      5.7.1.2. Cleaning products will be selected based on their use, efficacy, acceptability,
      safety, cost and availability. The goal of cleaning and disinfecting is to decrease the
      microbial load of the environment. All products will be Environmental Protection
      Agency (EPA) approved. (T-1).
      5.7.1.3. All trash and garbage will be emptied and placed in the designated waste
      disposal site every shift and as needed to prevent accumulation. This action will help
      control insects and rodents. (T-1).
      5.7.1.4. Wards and vestibules in tents will be swept once a shift and as needed. Mop
      with a detergent or disinfectant (e.g., A-33) at least daily and as needed. Do not mop
      with a wet, drippy mop because it will cause pooling of water and encourage the growth
      of mildew in the Velcro. (T-1).
      5.7.1.5. Blood and body fluid spills may be cleaned using a 1:10 dilution of 6% sodium
      hypochlorite (household bleach) and water. Follow these steps:
          5.7.1.5.1. Cordon off the area so personnel will not slip or track blood through the
          area. (T-1).
          5.7.1.5.2. Don appropriate PPE.
          5.7.1.5.3. Prepare the bleach solution by mixing one part bleach to ten parts water in
          a mop bucket. Flood the area with the bleach solution being careful not to let the mop
          touch the blood spill and let stand 10 minutes.
          5.7.1.5.4. Blot up as much of the blood or body fluid spill as possible with disposable
          towels. Throw away the towels into a universally labeled biohazard bag.
          5.7.1.5.5. Flood the area a second time with the bleach solution being careful not to
          let the mop touch the blood spill and let stand 10 minutes.
          5.7.1.5.6. Use a towel or a mop to finish cleaning the area. Dispose of the bleach
          mixture appropriately. Take off the PPE and discard appropriately.
      5.7.1.6. For small blood or body fluid spills, spill kits can be easily and inexpensively
      made by gathering the items listed below:
AFI44-108 11 DECEMBER 2014                                                                    51


          5.7.1.6.1. 150 ml sodium hypochlorite in a brown, plastic 150-250 ml bottle.
          5.7.1.6.2. Two sponges.
          5.7.1.6.3. One pair of gloves.
          5.7.1.6.4. One leak-proof bag with the universal biohazard label.
          5.7.1.6.5. Place all above items into a bottle or container, which can then become the
          “bucket” for the bleach solution. Store in any area where a spill may occur.
5.8. Disinfectants.
   5.8.1. Bleach.
       5.8.1.1. Bleach does not contain a detergent and; therefore, cannot “clean” the
       environment of dirt or debris. The area must be cleaned with a detergent then followed
       with bleach to disinfect. (T-0).
       5.8.1.2. One to a hundred (1:100) dilution of bleach is strong enough for environmental
       disinfecting. Bleach can be stored in an opaque plastic bottle for one month. Do not
       store bleach in glass. Label with name of disinfectant, dilution, date made, and date it
       expires.
       5.8.1.3. Do not mix bleach with other detergents or disinfectants (e.g., phenolics such as
       Wexide) as it can produce harmful fumes. Wear the appropriate PPE when working with
       bleach.
   5.8.2. Alcohol.
       5.8.2.1. Alcohol is also a good disinfectant but not a good cleaner. The area must be
       cleaned with a detergent then followed with alcohol to disinfect. (T-0).
       5.8.2.2. Cotton will break down the alcohol making it ineffective; do not store cotton in
       alcohol. (T-3).
       5.8.2.3. Alcohol is not recommended for use as a sterilant. In the appropriate
       concentrations of 60-90%, alcohol will kill the vegetative forms of bacteria. It is also
       tuberculocidal, fungicidal, and virucidal, but does not destroy bacterial spores such as
       Clostridium difficile or Clostridium perfringens. Alcohol is volatile and requires storage
       in a cool place. (T-0).
   5.8.3. A33, Dry Disinfectant/Detergent.
       5.8.3.1. Contains a dual quaternary ammonium chloride in a premeasured packet which
       is dissolved in one gallon of water. Like all quaternary ammonia compounds it cleans by
       the removal of soil and also disinfects. It also neutralizes odors. Use this product to
       clean walls, floors and other nonporous hard surfaces.
       5.8.3.2. Do not use this product on medical instruments.
5.9. Miscellaneous Environmental Issues. (Refer to Attachment 2 of this instruction).
   5.9.1. Linen. Storage and handling of contaminated, dirty linen will vary with each
   deployment so the procedures will depend on the resources available at the particular site.
   (T-1).

  5.9.2. Disposal of medical waste will vary with each deployment. CE will assist with
  providing guidance on acceptable and appropriate disposal methods. (T-1).
  5.9.3. Sharps, splash or other body fluid exposure injuries will be reported to the supervisor
  and PH. PH will monitor and follow up all injuries. (T-0).

         MISCELLANEOUS ISSUES TO CONSIDER DURING DEPLOYMENTS

Table A2.1. Handwashing.
Water     Availability - Are there seasonal variations due to the climate? Will alcohol based
                       hand rubs need to be available per CDC or WHO guidelines?
          Source       - What is the water source (water from a well, river, treatment plant,
                       natural spring, bring our own?) - How much is carried in? Is it
                       secure? - How is it provided (indoor plumbing, running water or
                       carried in?) - Will alcohol-based hand rubs need to be available per
                       CDC or WHO guidelines?
          Treatment    - How is the water treated? Who treats it?
          Testing      - Who will test and how? Need to identify if contaminated with
                       chemicals, organic matter or organisms? - Is it potable?
          Temperature - Is both hot and cold available?

  EXAMPLES OF COMPLIANCE AND PROCESS SURVEILLANCE FOR LSMTFS,
  DENTAL CLINICS, AESS, AND AIR RESERVE COMPONENT MEDICAL UNITS

A5.1. DEFINITION: Process surveillance includes the series of steps taken to achieve a desired
outcome. Compliance surveillance ensures personnel compliance with the IC policies per the
Unit's Infection Prevention and Control Program.
A5.2. PURPOSE: Assess the knowledge level of personnel as they perform their assigned
duties. Provide adequate oversight of the work of contractor personnel. Are all employees and
contractor personnel compliant with and do they understand their role and responsibilities as it
applies to the Infection Prevention and Control Program procedures? AESs, ARC Medical Units
and LSMTFs have a limited scope of practice and do not perform invasive procedures. So AESs,
ARC Medical Units, and LSMTFs are unable to generate risk stratification and quantifiable data
and are not required to report routine infection rates. Surveillance focus will be more process,
rather than outcome, oriented. (T-0).
A5.3. METHOD: Observation and verbal questioning/interviews of any unit personnel. Use a
checklist guide to standardize your interview questions/observational goals as you observe or
interview personnel.
A5.4. ACTION: Correct infractions and /or deficiencies with education, product change,
practice. If the infractions and/or deficiencies involve contractor personnel, notify the
Contracting Officer, who will bring the matter to the attention of the contractor’s management.
A5.5. EXAMPLES: The list below is not exhaustive.
   A5.5.1. Handwashing: Does the staff wash or sanitize their hands when the opportunity
   presents itself (based on CDC standards)? Does the staff have knowledge and practice
   appropriate hand washing techniques? Do the staff members have artificial nails, nail
   extenders or long nails? For example, at most institutions artificial/long nails are prohibited
   for healthcare workers (HCW) performing patient care. Are contractor personnel performing
   any tasks that require contact with patients? If so, are they complying with the handwashing
   requirements set forth in this AFI?
   A5.5.2. Supply Storage: Are soiled and contaminated supplies separated from those that are
   clean and sterile? Are supplies stored 8-10 inches above the floor (to permit adequate
   cleaning of the floor), 18-20 inches below the ceiling, (away from vents, sprinklers, and
   lights to safe guard supplies from damage)? Are sterile and clean supplies stored on shelves,
   bins, or in drawers designed to protect the items from damage? Is supply rotation of “first-in
   first-out” being used? Are washable storage bins with dividers made of a non-porous
   material used? Are shelves being wiped down? Are outdated supplies found? Is the storage
   area clean? Are cardboard Shipping boxes stored in areas with clean/sterile supplies?
   A5.5.3. Equipment cleaning/disinfection/sterilization: Primarily for areas that perform these
   activities such as units with an Aerospace Medical Mission. Are appropriate personnel
   trained in cleaning/disinfecting/ sterilization and the required documentation? Is appropriate
   cleaning being accomplished in patient care areas to include: the correct environmental
   cleaner? Is spore testing being done per protocol and documented where sterilizers are being
   used?      Are contractor personnel performing tasks that require proper equipment

  cleaning/disinfection/sterilization?       If so, are they complying with the
  cleaning/disinfection/sterilization requirements set forth in this AFI? Is adequate oversight
  of the work of contractor personnel regarding equipment cleaning/disinfection/sterilization
  being provided by a qualified Air Force official?
  A5.5.4. Employee Health Program (EHP): Is compliance to EHP demonstrated by
  compliance to immunizations (e.g., Influenza, MMR, HAV, HBV, chickenpox
  documentation)? Compliance to EHP demonstrated by compliance to required testing (e.g.,
  PPD-HIV)? Work restrictions concerning communicable diseases? Do personnel know the
  proper procedure if they sustain an exposure to blood or body fluids? Are they able to
  initiate the Blood borne exposure control pathogen program appropriately? Do they
  understand their role in the Tuberculosis (TB) Control Plan? Do they practice Standard
  Precautions appropriately? Are blood spills cleaned-up IAW with policies? Are contractor
  personnel who serve as healthcare workers performing tasks that require them to maintain
  currency on their immunizations and their exposure status? If so, are contractor personnel
  also performing tasks where they potentially come into contact with either bodily fluids or
  patients with communicable diseases? If so, do contractor personnel have all required
  immunizations as set forth in this AFI?
  A5.5.5. Exposure incident: Is there documentation of incident and follow-up of exposed
  person and source? Are safety devices available per OSHA regulations? Are safety devices
  being used appropriately? Has the healthcare worker been fit tested on the N95 respirator if
  they take care of a patient with/or suspected TB? If not, do they know where to get fit-
  tested? Are contractor personnel who serve as healthcare workers performing tasks
  involving the care of infectious patients that require the use of specialized PPE? If so, are
  contractor personnel complying with the requirements set forth in this AFI regarding proper
  use of specialized PPE? Is adequate oversight of the work of contractor personnel regarding
  proper use of specialized PPE being provided by a qualified Air Force official?
  A5.5.6. Visual inspection: Do personnel know where to go to get information concerning
  Infection Prevention in the unit? Is the general environment clean? Storage of supplies: Is
  there appropriate rotation, removal of outdated items, cleanliness of area? Linen: Is there
  protected storage and cleanliness of storage area?
  A5.5.7. Unique environmental issues for special workplaces: Are infection prevention and
  control practices maintained in the Immunization Clinic/mobile immunization lines, Dental
  Clinic, Laboratories, Aircraft, and Patient exam rooms? Does staff know where to get
  personal protective equipment (PPE)? Are personnel performing risk-associated activities by
  using task appropriate PPE and techniques? Is there proper oversight by a qualified Air
  Force official of contractor personnel who are engaged in activities that require the use of
  PPE? Are errors by contractor personnel regarding the use of PPE in such situations
  promptly reported to the Contracting Officer, so that he or she can bring the matter to the
  attention of the contractor’s management? Is regulated waste (if any) disposed of IAW local
  policy? Are contractor personnel being used to handle, manifest, transport of regulated (e.g.,
  solid, infectious, hazardous) waste? Does the contract authorize contractors and their
  personnel to perform such duties? If contractor personnel are performing such duties, is
  there adequate oversight of their performance of such duties by a qualified Air Force official?
  Does food or drink consumption occur only in designated areas within the clinic? Are unit
  members familiar with the intent of Standard or Transmission Based Precautions? Are
 86                                                         AFI44-108 11 DECEMBER 2014


   needles and syringes placed intact in sharps containers after use? Has the HCW been
   familiarized with the safety devices used in the LSMTFs/ARC Medical Units?
   A5.5.8. Has the AF Reserve or ANG member been given a briefing on issues related to
   health/infection prevention and control prior to a mobilization?
   A5.5.9. Have OSHA/infection prevention and control briefings been properly documented
   (e.g., Form 55, MRDSS)?
   A5.5.10. Immunizations: Are immunization refrigerators being monitored daily? Is there an
   alarm system to notify personnel that a malfunction has occurred? Are only immunizations
   stored in the refrigerators? Are the immunization refrigerators being cleaned on a routine
   basis?
A5.6. NOTE: AESs, ARC Medical Units and LSMTFs with their limited focus should
concentrate their surveillance efforts on monitoring mission specific compliance items of the IC
Program. For example, when performing procedures like a dental check-up, providing
immunizations, separation of waste into red bag versus regular trash bags or hand washing is
there compliance with the established process for that procedure. Other examples may be found
above, but do not limit your surveillance to the above listed items.
AFI44-108 11 DECEMBER 2014                                                                          87

 HEPATITIS B VACCINE DECLINATION (MANDATORY) APPENDIX A TO 29 CFR
              1910.1030 BLOODBORNE PATHOGEN STANDARD

I understand that due to my occupational exposure to blood or other potentially infectious
materials (OPIM) I may be at risk of acquiring Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. I have been
given the opportunity to be vaccinated with Hepatitis B vaccine, at no charge to myself.
However, I decline Hepatitis B vaccination at this time. I understand that by declining this
vaccine, I continue to be at risk of acquiring Hepatitis B, a serious disease. If in the future I
continue to have occupational exposure to blood or OPIM and I wish to be vaccinated with
Hepatitis B vaccine, I can receive the vaccination series at no charge to me.
