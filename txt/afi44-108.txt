                                           Chapter 2

  POLICY FOR INITIATING AND SUSTAINING INFECTION PREVENTION AND
                   CONTROL PROGRAMS IN AD MTFS

2.1. Scope of the Program. The Infection Prevention and Control Program is a multifaceted
MTF program/function that complies with current applicable external inspection agencies such
as The Joint Commission and AAAHC, Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)
regulations and other regulatory agencies. LSMTFs may seek consultant service through an
MOU with another larger MTF.
   2.1.1. Program focuses on preventing and controlling infections among patients, personnel,
   students, and visitors by implementing the appropriate guidelines developed by the CDC, the
   Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology (APIC), HIPAC,
   Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) and other professional
   organizations.
   2.1.2. Program’s surveillance, prevention, and control activities may be adapted to meet the
   mission and services based on the MTF’s ICRA.
2.2. Program Authority. The MTF's/LSMTF's executive management team oversees the ICC
or the clinical staff performing the ICF through ECOMS or its equivalent.
   2.2.1. MTF leadership must place an emphasis on HCW health and safety. The MDG
   leadership must set the tone for the safety climate within the MTF, in order to foster a
   ―culture of infection prevention and control‖.
2.3. Infection Control Committee (ICC) or Infection Control Function (ICF):
   2.3.1. A multidisciplinary group designed to coordinate and maintain the activities related to
   the Infection Prevention and Control Program. The MTF may call this multidisciplinary
   group a committee or a function depending on the size of the facility and the infrastructure
   for program management. If a LSMTF/small clinic chooses not to have an ICF, ECOMS
   will assume the roles of the ICF stated in this AFI (Refer to 1.6.2.1.).
       2.3.1.1. ICC/ICF Membership:
          2.3.1.1.1. Consists of personnel who have a commensurate level of authority in their
          functional area for critical decision making, communicate information to their
          functional areas, and ensure timely implementation of recommended actions.
          2.3.1.1.2. Includes but not limited to: IC Chairperson, IP, PH, FM, Nursing,
          Outpatient Provider Staff, Dental, Operating Room (OR) support staff and surgeons
          if MTF has a working OR, Risk Management, PS Manager, and other representatives
          as deemed necessary from Lab, Pharmacy, BE, Administrator, Housekeeping etc.
   2.3.2. Identifies and reduces risks of endemic (common cause) and epidemic (special cause)
   healthcare-associated infections in patients and health care workers at the direct patient care
   level and at the patient care support level.
   2.3.3. Meets at least quarterly.
AFI44-108 1 MARCH 2012                                                                     19


     2.3.3.1. ICC submits committee minutes to ECOMS or the equivalent. The ICF submits
     either a summary or minutes to ECOMS or its equivalent.
     2.3.3.2. The minutes or summary:
         2.3.3.2.1. Reflect activities of the ICC/ICF by addressing, at a minimum, all of the
         components of the annual ICPP as standard agenda items.
         2.3.3.2.2. Uses a format that includes general discussion, action taken, and expected
         date of completion on each item presented at the ICC/ICF meeting unless it is for
         information only, then thoroughly discuss as appropriate.
         2.3.3.2.3. Contains an epidemiological approach to collect quantifiable data that is
         mostly longitudinal, can give a good comparison over time, and can identify positive
         or harmful trends. (For example, it may not be helpful to describe monthly or
         quarterly surgical site infection rates unless MTFs have comparative data from 6-12
         months prior or the MTF benchmarks against a national rate).
  2.3.4. Coordinates on the MTF/LSMTF Infection Control Instruction.
     2.3.4.1. ICC/ICF may consider integrating the following instructions into one user
     friendly document: Infection Prevention and Control Program, Employee Health (EH),
     BBP-ECP and the Tuberculosis Prevention and Control Plan. (Refer to paragraph 1.8.17.)
         2.3.4.1.1. Combined instructions must be clearly identified as to what programs are
         included (e.g., BBP-ECP, IC, EH) at the beginning of the instruction.
         2.3.4.1.2. Appropriate coordination by process owners is imperative. (For example,
         Aerospace Medicine coordinates the Exposure Control Plans and EH.)
         2.3.4.1.3. Instruction specifies all components of those various programs for the
         associated standard.
         2.3.4.1.4. If separate instructions are maintained, it is imperative that these
         instructions are synchronized.
     2.3.4.2. The MTF Infection Control Instruction will at a minimum:
         2.3.4.2.1. Identify the scope of the program relevant to the mission of the
         MTF/LSMTF.
         2.3.4.2.2. Give authority to isolate infectious patients using the transmission-based
         precautions.
         2.3.4.2.3. Give authority to culture any drainage site suspected as a HAI.
         2.3.4.2.4. Define policy and procedures for the prevention and control of infection
         that is consistent throughout the organization. (e.g., multi-drug resistant organisms
         [MDRO], linen, housekeeping/environmental cleaning, medical equipment, supplies,
         procedures, devices, use of standard precautions, PPE [personal protective
         equipment], infectious waste disposal.)
         2.3.4.2.5. Complete public reporting of HAIs through the participation in the
         appropriate Patient Safety Modules in the CDC National Healthcare Safety Network
         (NHSN) or other data bases as required by Military Health System (MHS) or DoD.
20                                                                AFI44-108 1 MARCH 2012


         2.3.4.2.6. Implement the hand hygiene protocol for the MTF/LSMTF in accordance
         with the CDC or the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines on hand hygiene.
         2.3.4.2.7. Identify the procedure for investigating outbreaks or a sudden influx of
         infectious patients.
  2.3.5. Coordinates on the development of the ICPP.
     2.3.5.1. The ICPP is a detailed document that describes all planned infection prevention
     activities for the year with supporting measurable objectives and methods for achieving
     those goals. The ICPP is based on the annual ICRA which addresses the unique
     characteristics and risks for the MTF/LSMTF. An ICRA should be conducted whenever
     significant changes occur within the MTF/LSMTF and added to the ICPP to reflect the
     changes.
         2.3.5.1.1. Contents of the Annual ICRA must be based on the MTF’s/LSMTF’s
         mission:
            2.3.5.1.1.1. Age range (e.g., newborns to geriatrics) and most prevalent health
            conditions of the patient population served (e.g., Type II Diabetes, asthma).
            2.3.5.1.1.2. Geographical location and potential          impact.    (e.g.,   disaster
            preparedness, agricultural or rural location)
            2.3.5.1.1.3. Environmental issues and potential impact. (e.g.,disaster
            preparedness, hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts, blizzards, earthquakes, train
            derailment.)
            2.3.5.1.1.4. Care, treatment and level of clinical services provided (e.g., inpatient
            units, clinics, outpatient procedures, OR, Emergency Department (ED) level of
            care, Transplant tissues and/or organ procurement).
            2.3.5.1.1.5. Clinically significant microorganisms identified through mandated or
            planned surveillance.
            2.3.5.1.1.6. Military mission (e.g., home station and expeditionary missions).
            2.3.5.1.1.7. Assess the impact the community has on your MTF. The patients,
            MTF and base personnel reside in the community so whatever is occurring in the
            community may have a major impact on the MTF, such as a measles or flu
            outbreak (e.g., MOUs with community medical facilities, AES/ Air Reserve
            Component Medical Units, and LSMTFs, the regional rates of MDROs).
            2.3.5.1.1.8. Endemic diseases.
            2.3.5.1.1.9. Historical HAI data and conclusions from previous year’s annual
            plan that warrants further action and follow-up.

            2.3.5.1.1.11. The annual and updated ICRAs will be reviewed and approved by
            ECOMS or equivalent to assist in prioritizing the risk identified according to the
            level of probability and potential for harm. The approved ICRA(s) is included in
            the annual ICPP.
AFI44-108 1 MARCH 2012                                                                      21


        2.3.5.1.2. The ICPP is a fluid document that must be able to adjust as needed in
        response to negative events or changes in the MTF's mission. Any changes must
        have ICC/ICF and ECOMS or equivalent approval before the ICPP is implemented.
        (Note: do not include the ICPP in the MTF/LSMTF IC Instruction).
     2.3.5.2. Annual ICPP will identify the following items at a minimum:

       3.1.1.1. MTFs/LSMTFs will use Standard Precautions (SP). All blood and body fluids
       are treated as if potentially infectious with a need for heightened concern in environments
       of poor lighting which makes visualization of blood in body fluids uncertain (e.g.,
       aircraft, medical transportation buses, austere ground condition in operational settings).
          3.1.1.1.1. Hand Hygiene, a component of Standard Precautions will be followed per
          the CDC and HICPAC: Guideline for Hand Hygiene in Health-Care Settings or the
          WHO: WHO Guidelines on Hand Hygiene in Health Care.
          3.1.1.1.2. Respiratory Hygiene/Cough Etiquette will be followed as a component of
          Standard Precautions. The MTF/LSMTF guidance should apply to all persons to
          include patients, visitors and staff who enter a health care setting.
          3.1.1.1.3. Personnel will wear PPE (e.g., gloves, gowns, goggles, masks) appropriate
          for the task to form a personal barrier of protection for associated exposure risk per
          SP.
          3.1.1.1.4. Personnel who manage Reusable Medical Equipment (RME) will be
          provided initial training and follow established procedures based on manufacturer’s
          instructions. They will perform the proper set-up, use, and reprocessing for each type
          of RME in their respective areas of responsibility. Competency will be verified
          annually.
       3.1.1.2. MTFs will use Transmission-Based Isolation Procedures in any health care
       delivery system to include hospitals, clinics, and dental units.
          3.1.1.2.1. The three modes of transmission precautions are Airborne, Droplet, and
          Contact Precautions.
          3.1.1.2.2. Protective Environment precautions will be used in acute care hospitals
          that provide care to hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) patients. These
          precautions are designed to prevent HAIs and consist of engineering and design
          interventions that decrease the risk of exposure to environmental fungi for severely
          immunocompromised allogeneic (HSCT) patients.
       3.1.1.3. Guidelines for the Prevention of Multi-drug Resistant Organisms (MDRO)
       Infections and other future CDC/HICPAC focused infectious disease guidelines (e.g.,
       Noro-virus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) are used in combination with the
AFI44-108 1 MARCH 2012                                                                      25

     Staphylococcus aureus in Acute Care Hospitals.
     3.1.1.5. SHEA/IDSA Practice Recommendations: Strategies to Prevent Clostridium
     difficile Infection in Acute Care Hospitals.
  3.1.2. OSHA: Bloodborne Pathogens, Final Rule.
     3.1.2.1. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) will be supplied by the health care
     organization (e.g., MTF/LSMTF, Dental) and is appropriate for the task being performed.
     3.1.2.2. Personnel will wear PPE appropriate for the task to form a barrier of protection
     against exposure of blood, other body fluids, infectious, and chemical agents from
     contamination of clinical attire, undergarments, skin, eyes, mouth, or other mucous
     membranes under normal conditions of use and for the duration of time which the PPE
     will be used.
     3.1.2.3. Personnel will wear protective outer garments (e.g., fluid resistant gowns,
     laboratory coats, cotton or cotton/polyester scrubs when sleeve length is long, scrub
     jackets) that must prevent contamination of clinical attire, undergarments or skin and are
     worn appropriate for the task being performed based upon the type of exposure and
     quantity of these substances reasonably anticipated to be encountered during the
     performance of a task or procedure. Scrubs are not considered PPE.
     3.1.2.4. Safety designed devices are considered and will be made available based on
     work practices, reported exposure trends, and the laws of the State for any individual
     MTF/LSMTFs/Dental unit.
     3.1.2.5. Occupational exposure to blood or other potentially infectious materials (OPIM):
        3.1.2.5.1. Healthcare workers (HCW) exposed to blood and OPIM will be evaluated
        and managed IAW OSHA, 29 CFR 1910.1030, Bloodborne Pathogens, Final Rule.
        OSHA, 29 CFR Part, Occupational exposures to bloodborne pathogens; needlesticks
        and other sharps injuries; final rule, Federal Register 2001; 66: 5317-25, as amended
        from and includes 20 CFR Part 1920.1030, Occupational exposure to bloodborne
        pathogens; final rule. Federal Register 1991; 56: 64174-82. Procedures for exposure
        incidents will be outlined in detail in the MTF/LSMTF/Dental Unit Exposure Control
        Plan.
        3.1.2.5.2. HCWs with a sharps injury, blood or OPIM exposure will promptly wash
        the exposed site with soap and water. If the eye or mucous membrane is exposed to
        blood or OPIM, flush profusely with copious amounts of water. The HCW must
        report exposures to their supervisor and seek post-exposure evaluation and treatment
        from a credentialed provider.
        3.1.2.5.3. HCWs will have access to an immediate 24-hour rapid response system
        that includes adequate communication to a medical team trained to triage all
        exposures and assess the need for post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). If PEP is
26                                                            AFI44-108 1 MARCH 2012


     deemed necessary, it is recommended to be administered as soon as possible within
     hours of exposure incident and per OSHA and CDC guidelines.
     3.1.2.5.4. The HCW will describe and document the circumstances surrounding the
     incident on the appropriate mishap report form and the exposure incident
     worksheet/investigation      form   approved      by      the    MAJCOM       and/or
     MTF/LSMTFs/Dental unit. In addition, the HCW must provide the necessary
     information to PH and the treating provider to facilitate complete documentation and
     investigation of the incident.
        3.1.2.5.4.1. Federal civilian employees, in conjunction with their supervisor,
        should report injuries by completing the CA-1, Notice for Compensation of
        Occupational Injury. Civilians may complete the form CA-16, Authorization for
        Treatment should they wish to seek treatment at a civilian location. Federal
        civilian    employees      can   locate   the    CA-1    and     CA-16     at:
        http://www.dol.gov/libraryforms/.
     3.1.2.5.5. The supervisor of the exposed HCW will notify PH of the injury or
     exposure and assist the employee with the following items:
        3.1.2.5.5.1. Ensures the source is fully evaluated by their provider to assess risk
        of bloodborne pathogen exposure to the HCW. The source will be tested as soon
        as possible for HIV and Hepatitis B/C.
        3.1.2.5.5.2. Ensures all required documentation of the incident is initiated and
        sent to the appropriate office for completion of final report(s).
        3.1.2.5.5.3. Sends the HCW to a credentialed provider as soon as possible after
        exposure along with the source risk assessment, the mishap report form, and the
        exposure incident worksheet/investigation form in a packet.
        3.1.2.5.5.4. Ensure the HCW reports to PH following the evaluation and
        treatment by a provider. If after duty hours, the HCW must report to PH on the
        next regular duty day.
     3.1.2.5.6. The credentialed provider conducting the evaluation/treatment of the
     exposed HCW must, IAW CDC guidelines, fully assess the risk of bloodborne
     pathogen exposure risk, initiate laboratory testing, provide indicated treatment, and
     complete any necessary portions of the mishap report and exposure incident
     worksheet/investigation form.
     3.1.2.5.7. PH, in consultation with the attending physician, SGH, or flight surgeon
     consultant, will evaluate the laboratory test results of the HCW and the source patient.
     If necessary, this physician, in consultation with an infectious disease physician, will
     provide recommendations for prophylaxis and further follow-up.
        3.1.2.5.7.1. Within 15 days of the completion of the exposure evaluation, PH will
        provide the employee a physician’s written opinion regarding risk of infection and
        recommended follow-up.
        3.1.2.5.7.2. PH will complete the exposure incident worksheet/investigation and
        ensure it is filed/documented in the HCW’s medical record.
AFI44-108 1 MARCH 2012                                                                       27


         3.1.2.5.8. Exposure incidents should also be documented on the sharps injury log, if
         applicable, and reported in the Air Force Safety Automated System. As these
         incidents are considered to be occupational injuries, they should be reported as
         mishaps by the facility safety manager.

3.2. Employee Health Program Elements.
   3.2.1. All HCWs must in-process through PH within 10 duty days of arrival at the MTF/AD
   AES or within three Unit Training Assemblies (UTAs) after arrival to the unit for AF
   Reserve and ANG AES personnel as well as Air Reserve Component Medical Unit personnel
   but prior to assignment of duties, whichever comes first. The CDC HIPAC/ACIP definition
   for HCW is used here and includes all paid and unpaid persons working in health-care
28                                                                AFI44-108 1 MARCH 2012


  settings who have the potential for exposure to infectious materials, including body
  substances, contaminated medical supplies and equipment, contaminated environmental
  surfaces, or contaminated air. HCW might include (but are not limited to) physicians, nurses,
  nursing assistants, therapists, technicians, emergency medical service personnel, dental
  personnel, pharmacists, laboratory personnel, autopsy personnel, students and trainees,
  volunteers, contractual staff, and persons (e.g., clerical, dietary, housekeeping, maintenance,
  and volunteers) not directly involved in patient care but potentially exposed to infectious
  agents that can be transmitted to and from HCW.
  3.2.2. PH/AF Reserve Medical ART (per job description) will identify and request required
  lab work and immunizations and notify supervisors of delinquent completion. PH will enter
  health screening data into the approved AF PH application for management of MEHP (i.e.
  PIMR) and file associated forms, such as the Hepatitis B declination, in the outpatient
  records.
     3.2.2.1. Hepatitis B (HB) Virus (HBV) Vaccine and Immunity:
         3.2.2.1.1. Completion of the three dose vaccine series is required for all active duty.
         Completion of the three dose vaccine series and testing for HB surface antibody (anti-
         HBs) within 30-60 days after completion of the three dose vaccination series is
         required for all active duty, civilian and contract employees, including trainees and
         volunteers, with direct patient care duties. Civilian employees working in non-direct
         patient care activities will be offered the vaccine series; those who wish to decline
         must sign the Hepatitis B Declination Statement (Refer to Attachment 7).
         3.2.2.1.2. All HCWs in the high-risk or exposure-prone occupational risk groups
         (those assigned to ongoing direct patient care duties), as determined by PH and the
         Infection Control Function, must be tested for anti-HBs within 30-60 days after
         completion of the three dose vaccination series. High-risk HCWs who have been
         previously vaccinated but have no documentation of anti-HBs testing (e.g., new
         employees or employees with an incomplete record) do not require anti-HBs testing
         (unless as indicated following a blood/body fluid exposure incident).
             3.2.2.1.2.1. High-risk personnel: Personnel who have direct contact with patients
             or blood/body fluids, and are at ongoing risk for injuries with sharp
             instruments/needlesticks.
             3.2.2.1.2.2. Exposure-prone personnel: Medical and dental providers, nurses,
             and technicians who perform invasive procedures with sharp instruments in a
             poorly visualized or highly confined anatomic site, as defined by the most current
             CDC guidelines.
             3.2.2.1.2.3. All high-risk and exposure-prone HCWs who do not have a
             protective concentration of anti-HBs (>10 mIU/mL) after completion of the initial
             series will complete a second three-dose vaccine series. A repeat anti-HBs test
             will be drawn after the second vaccination series. Exposure-prone HCWs who
             have been previously vaccinated with a compete series but have no
             documentation of antiHBs testing (e.g., new employees or those with an
             incomplete record) should receive one dose of Hepatitis B vaccine (to boost
             immune response), then undergo anti-HBs testing one month following the
AFI44-108 1 MARCH 2012                                                                          29


            booster vaccine. If negative for anti-HBs, these HCWs should complete the
            second vaccination series.
            3.2.2.1.2.4. All high-risk and exposure-prone HCWs who do not have a
            protective concentration of anti-HBs (>10 mIU/mL) after completion of the
            second vaccination series (i.e., after receiving a total of 6 doses) will be tested for
            Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and Hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) to
            determine infection status.
            3.2.2.1.2.5. HCWs determined not to be infected but who have anti-HBs < 10
            mIU/mL (nonresponders) should be considered susceptible to HBV infection. PH
            will inform HCWs of their susceptibility and document the employee’s status in
            the approved Air Force immunization tracking system and medical employee
            health tracking system. HCWs in this situation should strictly adhere to standard
            precautions to prevent exposure to HBsAg positive blood.
            3.2.2.1.2.6. HCWs determined to be infected (anti-HBc positive) and positive for
            HBsAg will be referred to an appropriate credentialed healthcare provider to
            receive counseling regarding how to prevent HBV transmission to others and to
            be evaluated for further testing, care, treatment, and other services as appropriate.
            An expert review panel (e.g., Chief of the Medical Staff/Chief Nurse, Credentials
            Committee, ICC/ICF) will evaluate exposure-prone HCWs positive for HBsAG
            for possible duty restrictions. HCWs who were infected in the past (anti-HBc-
            positive but negative for HBsAg) require no vaccination or treatment.
     3.2.2.2. HIV Testing. HIV testing is required periodically IAW AFI 48-135, Human
     Immunodeficiency Virus Program and is encouraged for civilians under certain
     circumstances. All civilian and contract HCWs must sign an HIV Antibody Test Consent
     Form before the test is accomplished. Converters will be managed IAW AFI 48-135.
     3.2.2.3. Measles, Mumps and Rubella Vaccination or Immunity.
        3.2.2.3.1. HCWs born after 1956 without proof of immunity, disease or history of
        two lifetime MMR vaccinations will be vaccinated per CDC ACIP guidelines. All
        HCWs are required to show documented proof of immunity through seropositive
        antibody titers or documentation of two MMR vaccinations. In the event there is a
        community outbreak, or a public health risk assessment determines there is an
        increased risk for measles or mumps transmission in the MTF setting, the MTF
        should follow CDC ACIP recommendations for recommended immunization and
        immunity documentation procedures.
        3.2.2.3.2. PH will order titer(s) for HCWs who do not have appropriate
        documentation of this vaccination series, previous positive titer results or a record of
        physician diagnosed measles, mumps and rubella.
     3.2.2.4. Tuberculosis (TB) Screening. Prior to initial employment (to the Air Force or
     DoD), all HCWs must produce documentation of an appropriate TB test protocol (either
     the two-step tuberculin skin test (TST), or an approved blood assay for TB screening)
     that was performed within the previous 12 months. Persons without documented history
     of a TB test within 12 months should have either the two- step TST or blood TB assay
     performed. HCWs with a positive TST will be appropriately followed IAW Air Force
 30                                                                  AFI44-108 1 MARCH 2012


      and other regulatory agency guidelines. Routine TB screening need not be accomplished
      on HCWs who transfer between low-risk AF/DoD facilities.
      3.2.2.5. Varicella vaccine. All HCWs require proof of immunity in accordance with
      current ACIP recommendations. If verification of a history of varicella disease or herpes
      zoster by a health-care provider cannot be provided, a titer will be ordered by PH prior to
      the employee starting the vaccine series.
      3.2.2.6. Tetanus/Diphtheria/Pertussis. All HCWs will be receive a one-time dose of the
      Combined Tetanus, Diphtheria and Pertussis (Tdap) vaccine if not previously vaccinated.
      HCWs will receive Td boosters every 10 years thereafter.
      3.2.2.7. Influenza. All HCWs should be vaccinated against influenza annually IAW the
      most current ACIP recommendations, DoD policy and the annual AF/SG seasonal
      influenza memorandum.
   3.2.3. Occupational Examinations. The Occupational and Environmental Health Working
   Group will determine if and which HCWs require occupational examinations. Current
   occupational examinations will be updated by PH in the HCWs' medical record and in the
   approved Air Force occupational health exam tracking application. PH will coordinate with
   Flight Medicine to ensure the employee is scheduled for an exam within 30 days.
   3.2.4. Annual Health Program Screening Requirements:
      3.2.4.1. PH will notify individual HCWs when medical employee health program
      screening requirements are due.
      3.2.4.2. For military members, the annual Preventive Health Assessment includes
      occupational screening exams for HCW enrolled in the occupational health program.
      3.2.4.3. Civilian employees enrolled in the occupational health program will receive
      annual occupational screening exams, as required.
3.3. Authority Statements.
   3.3.1. In the MTFs, the ICC/ICF has the authority, through its Chair, and for LSMTF's
   through its ECOMS Chairperson to institute any surveillance, prevention, and control
   measures deemed necessary when there is reason to believe a condition exists that places the
   facility, patients, visitors, or personnel in jeopardy.
      3.3.1.1. The Chairperson of the ICC/ICF will ensure the MTF Commander is promptly
      notified of the danger. For LSMTFs the ECOMS Chairperson ensures prompt
      notification of Commander.
      3.3.1.2. The patient’s primary provider is advised when isolation precautions are
      instituted.
   3.3.2. The ICC/ICF, IP and the medical/dental provider, nurse, or technician responsible for
   the care of the patient has the authority to initiate the appropriate isolation precautions and to
   culture suspected infected sites based on pre-established protocols for care.
      3.3.2.1. Personnel must be trained in culturing techniques according to laboratory
      guidelines.
AFI44-108 1 MARCH 2012                                                                           31


       3.3.2.2. Sites that may be cultured include: urine, sputum, wound, stool, peripheral and
       central venous access sites, and other external drainage. The probing of a deep wound, to
       include intra-oral surgical sites, is done by the provider.
       3.3.2.3. Documentation of culture submission is required in the medical or dental record.
       3.3.2.4. The provider is advised when a culture was submitted.
3.4. Guidelines for the Prevention and Control of Infection in Patients. The following
guidelines used separately or in combination in their most current edition and newly developed
CDC/HICPAC guidelines will be followed for the prevention and control of infection in
patients. Additional current literature may be used to augment these guidelines. MTFs will
adapt the program’s prevention and control activities to meet the needs of their specific facilities
and services. If a guideline is cited by the MTF/LSMTFs the guidelines must be followed in its
entirety. (NOTE: Issues that have been recurrent sources of question and concern are specified
here.)
   3.4.1. Hand Hygiene: The MTF/LSMTF will choose to comply with either the
   CDC/HICPAC or WHO guidelines.

   Epidemiology.
   3.4.7. Multi-Dose Medication Vial Dating and Use: United States Pharmacopoeia (USP
   797).
       3.4.7.1. The ultimate authority on proper storage and handling of any medication in the
       MTF/LSMTF is the pharmacy department so any concerns about USP 797 will be
       directed to the Pharmacy.
       3.4.7.2. Multi-dose medication containers (e.g., vials) are designed to allow for the
       removal of small increments on multiple occasions. All multi-dose medication containers
       will be discarded 28 days after initial entrance into the vial unless the manufacturer's
       specifies a different expiration date. Label the newly opened multi-dose medication vial
       with the expiration which is 28 days after initial entrance.
           3.4.7.2.1. This dating expectation does not apply to vaccines in the Centers for
           Disease Control and Prevention and state immunization programs, which have
           separate requirements for when multi-dose vials must be discarded.
 32                                                                   AFI44-108 1 MARCH 2012


   3.4.8. Sterile irrigation fluids: Use sterile irrigating solutions for one patient and dispose of
   them appropriately. Do not date or save for later use, even on the same patient.
3.5. Antiseptics. An ICC/ICF approved list of antiseptics listed as an attachment of the MTF IC
Instruction or as an attachment to the ICPP.
   3.5.1. Include Food and Drug Administration (FDA) antimicrobial hand hygiene agents for
   use by health care workers.
   3.5.2. Include any FDA approved antiseptics that may be used on a patient.
3.6. Disinfectants.
   3.6.1. The CDC Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008,
   and Guidelines for Environmental Infection Control in Health-Care Facilities, or the most
   current editions, will be used as guides for decision making. All disinfectants must be
   registered with the EPA.
   3.6.2. A list of disinfectants approved by the ICC/ICF will be listed as an attachment of the
   MTF IC Instruction or as an attachment to the ICPP. ECOMS will approve the LSMTF’s
   disinfectants list.
       3.6.2.1. Disinfectants used by the Hospital Aseptic Management System (HAMS)/Clinic
       Housekeeping Services/Housekeeping Contracts will be maintained and approved on a
       separate list to ensure health care workers are not confused as to which products are
       approved for use by housekeeping personnel and staff.
       3.6.2.2. The HAMS/Clinics Housekeeping Services Provider/Housekeeping Contractor
       will purchase disinfectants for use IAW established contract..
       3.6.2.3. HAMS/Clinics       Housekeeping       Services/Housekeeping        Contractor
       owned/supplied chemicals, supplies, and equipment should only be used by HCW during
       an emergency and only when a housekeeper is not available for emergency response.
   3.6.3. Glutaraldehyde.
       3.6.3.1. Due to the potentially hazardous nature of glutaraldehyde, all MTFs/LSMTFs
       are encouraged to seek alternative high-level disinfectants or sterilants for use.
       3.6.3.2. If glutaraldehyde is employed, comply with ventilation requirements, PPE,
       manufacturer’s directions for testing of concentration and use, and ensure the appropriate
       training of health care workers who will be using the product.
       3.6.3.3. Appropriate hazard and exposure evaluations are performed by the Bio-
       Environmental Engineering Department in areas in which glutaraldehyde is the only
       alternative for high-level disinfection.
       3.6.3.4. Glutaraldehyde is never used to disinfect environmental surfaces.
   3.6.4. Quality indicators for liquid disinfectants/sterilizing agents.
       3.6.4.1. Test strips or other quality indicators made by the manufacturer of a liquid
       disinfecting/sterilizing agent (glutaraldehyde, hydrogen peroxide based products,
       peracetic acid) are used per the manufacturer's directions as a validation of the product
       integrity and effective concentration of its active ingredient.
AFI44-108 1 MARCH 2012                                                                         33


       3.6.4.2. Documentation of quality indicator results will be performed daily or prior to the
       use of the agent if the product is not used on a daily basis.
   3.6.5. Household Bleach (Sodium Hypochlorite).
       3.6.5.1. Bleach as the only ingredient will not be used as a primary hospital grade
       disinfectant in the MTF. It lacks detergent and may be corrosive to some surfaces.
       NOTE: there are many commercially available products that combine bleach or chlorine
       compounds with other chemicals that may be used as a primary hospital grade
       disinfectant. Follow the manufacturer's guidelines for use.
       3.6.5.2. Bleach may be used in Nutritional Medicine as a disinfectant.
       3.6.5.3. Bleach may be used as an additional disinfection step if deemed necessary and
       approved by the ICC/ICF. (For example, due to its highly effective kill of enterovirus,
       and spore forming bacteria (e.g., Clostridium difficile, Bacillus anthracis), bleach may be
       used as a second step disinfection. The surface is first cleaned with a detergent or
       detergent/disinfectant, allowed to dry, and then followed by a disinfection of the
       appropriately mixed bleach and water solution.
       3.6.5.4. Spore Forming Bacteria: A chlorine based disinfectant (e.g., bleach) is effective
       if used in accordance with the manufacturer’s guidance in destroying spores formed by
       organisms such as Bacillus anthracis and Clostridium difficile. A chlorine based
       disinfectant may be used to disinfect any environment in which patients who are infected
       with a spore forming organism is admitted.
          3.6.5.4.1. Use of diluted hypochlorite (e.g., 1:10 dilution) solution will be considered
          in units with high C. difficile associated diarrhea or colitis rates.
       3.6.5.5. Dental Clinics will treat the dental waterlines as recommended by the dental unit
       manufacturer. One part 6% household bleach to 10 parts water may be used when
       applying the Dental Waterline "Shock" Protocol. Refer to the USAF Guidelines for
       Infection Control in Dentistry for details.
3.7. Cleaning, Disinfection, and Sterilization.
   3.7.1. Procedure for preparing contaminated, reusable instruments for reprocessing will be
   IAW the manufacturer’s instructions of the instrument and the intended use of the
   instrument:
       3.7.1.1. When transporting instruments from the point of use to an instrument
       reprocessing area (e.g., dirty utility room) wear gloves as a minimum if the instrument
       tray or other container with leak proof sides and bottoms has not been disinfected.
          3.7.1.1.1. Do not store sterile or clean instruments or supplies in the same area where
          contaminated instruments are held/being soaked or being cleaned.
          3.7.1.1.2. Minimize handling of loose contaminated instruments during transport to
          the instrument processing area. Use work practice controls to minimize exposure
          potential.
              3.7.1.1.2.1. . Instruments will be carried in an instrument tray or other puncture-
              resistant covered container with leak-proof sides and bottom. The container will
              be red color coded or designated by the facility as biohazard container, labeled
34                                                                 AFI44-108 1 MARCH 2012


             with the universal biohazard symbol, or, if not sharp, placed into a red biohazard
             bag to minimize exposure potential.
         3.7.1.1.3. All visible blood and other contamination will be wiped from the
         instruments or sprayed with a solution that will keep debris and contamination moist
         (e.g. enzymatic solutions) if there is going to be a delay in being brought to the
         reprocessing area and/or to the final reprocessing area (e.g., central sterile supply,
         dental instrument processing).
             3.7.1.1.3.1. The use of holding solutions (e.g., enzymatic cleaner/detergent
             solution) is optional, but should be considered to prevent hardening of bioburden
             which is then much more difficult to remove.
             3.7.1.1.3.2. Personnel will follow the manufacturer’s instruction when using an
             enzymatic cleaner/detergent solution.
  3.7.2. Reusable medical equipment and instrument re-processing, which includes dental
  instruments, is a complex process which requires qualified personnel to understand the
  importance of performing the correct processes for cleaning, preparation, and packaging
  items to be sterilized, all aspects of sterility maintenance, monitoring of sterilization cycles
  and storage of sterile items.
     3.7.2.1. Provide comprehensive and intensive training at orientation for all personnel
     who will reprocess non-critical, semi-critical and critical medical/surgical instruments
     that will include:
         3.7.2.1.1. Basic microbiology and IC principles, monitoring of sterilization cycles,
         instruction on the proper preparation, care, handling, storage, and maintenance of
         sterile items following manufacturer’s instructions.
         3.7.2.1.2. Initial orientation will be hands-on training per the organization’s policies,
         procedures and manufacturer’s instructions and all work will be supervised until
         competency is documented for each reprocessing task (refer to paragraph 3.7.2.2).
         3.7.2.1.3. Conduct competency testing at the beginning of employment and annually.
         3.7.2.1.4. Central Service/Sterile Processing Department training must be provided
         by a qualified (e.g., competency tested) person or through either a web-based, self-
         study or attendance in a formal course. Curriculum will include reprocessing of
         reusable equipment, maintenance and use of sterilization equipment/sterilizers, basic
         microbiology and IC principles, monitoring of sterilization cycles and instruction in
         the proper preparation, care, handling, storage, and maintenance of sterile items.
             3.7.2.1.4.1. The International Association of Healthcare Central Service Materiel
             Management (IAHCSMM) is a well-known organization that specializes in
             reprocessing medical equipment.
     3.7.2.2. Sterile processing personnel will be able to demonstrate knowledge and have
     documented competence in all aspects of steam sterilization (or other types practiced
     within facility) including cleaning, decontamination, inspection and packaging of the
     item to be sterilized, sterilizing procedures to include appropriate monitoring of the
     sterilization cycle, equipment operation of the specific steam (or other) sterilizing system
AFI44-108 1 MARCH 2012                                                                        35


     used in the MTF, standard/transmission based precautions, engineering and work practice
     controls, safety precautions, and storage of sterile items.
     3.7.2.3. Sterile processing personnel will obtain training material from sterile processing
     vendors, associations, journals and from AF MTFs, and should receive in-service training
     for all new instrumentation, devices and equipment.
     3.7.2.4. Determination of appropriate levels of disinfection/sterilization are IAW
     established criteria for critical, semi-critical, and non-critical items.
     3.7.2.5. Personnel will use only FDA cleared medical devices for sterilization and follow
     the manufacturer's instructions for correct use (e.g., cycle lengths, operating parameters).
     3.7.2.6. Personnel will clean, disinfect, and heat sterilize critical instruments in
     accordance with the instrument manufacturer, the sterilizer manufacturer's guidelines,
     and Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation standards.
     3.7.2.7. Biological indicators will be run in accordance with (IAW) AAMI Standards.
        3.7.2.7.1. New technologies for sterilization indicators (e.g., Rapid enzyme
        indicators, new chemical indicators, enzyme tablets, or integrating indicators that do
        not contain spores) are not acceptable methods of biological monitoring in USAF
        facilities until approved by AAMI.
        3.7.2.7.2. Rapid readout biological indicators that contain spores and have enzyme-
        based early readout capability (e.g., test results at 1 or 3 hours) are acceptable when
        the following conditions are met:
            3.7.2.7.2.1. The biological indicator will be used within an appropriate challenge
            test pack.
            3.7.2.7.2.2. Mechanical and chemical monitoring processes will be performed.
            3.7.2.7.2.3. The periodic verification will be either continued incubation of the
            biological indicator with enzyme-based early readout capability (according to
            manufacturer instructions) or the use of a conventional biological indicator. If
            conventional biological indicators will be used in these instances, maintain a
            conventional incubator in the facility.
     3.7.2.8. Sterilizer reports are submitted to the ICC/ICF at least quarterly.
     3.7.2.9. Flash (Immediate Use) Sterilization will not be used for reasons of convenience,
     as an alternative to purchasing additional instruments sets, or to save time. Flash
     sterilization is reserved for unique situations and not for routine use.
        3.7.2.9.1. Personnel will use mechanical, chemical, and biological indicators for each
        flash sterilization cycle.
        3.7.2.9.2. Critical instruments intended for immediate use can undergo flash
        sterilization if the instruments are maintained sterile during removal from the
        sterilizer and transport to the point of use (e.g., transported in a sterile covered
        container).
        3.7.2.9.3. Semicritical instruments that will be used    immediately or within a short
        time can undergo flash sterilization on a tray or in a container system, provided that
 36                                                                   AFI44-108 1 MARCH 2012


          the instruments are handled aseptically during removal from the sterilizer and
          transport to the point of use.
          3.7.2.9.4. Do not flash sterilize implantable devices.
       3.7.2.10. Testing Automated Cleaning Equipment
          3.7.2.10.1. Test automated cleaning equipment (e.g. ultrasonic cleaners, instrument
          washer, thermal disinfectors) upon initial installation, weekly during routine use, and
          after major repairs in accordance with AAMI and AORN Standards.
          3.7.2.10.2. Results of these tests should be included as a component of the instrument
          processing quality assurance program.
              3.7.2.10.2.1. Commercially available tests are available to evaluate variables such
              as water pressure, temperature, pH, and drying. These tests do not replace the
              requirement to visually inspect instruments after cleaning.
              3.7.2.10.2.2. Users must continue to follow the cleaning equipment manufacturer
              operating and maintenance instructions, including instrument loading procedures,
              which is critical to the success of the cleaning process.
              3.7.2.10.2.3. Due to the variety of brands and models of instrument
              washer/disinfectors available, it is recommended to first contact the manufacturer
              of your equipment to see if they offer or recommend a specific washer test kit. If
              a test kit from a manufacturer other than the equipment manufacturer is
              purchased, it is recommended to discuss the specific type of equipment in use at
              your facility (e.g., type, brand name, model of instrument washer) with the washer
              test kit manufacturer/distributor before purchasing any new products.
3.8. Event Related Sterility: Use event related sterility whenever possible. This practice
recognizes that the product should remain sterile until some event compromises the integrity of
the package (e.g., it becomes torn, wet by body fluids/water/antiseptics, dropped on a
contaminated surface, presence of dried antiseptics, or yellowing caused by extremes in
temperature).
3.9. Reprocessing Single Patient Use Items: Reprocessing of disposable supplies and
equipment items labeled as ―single patient use only‖ will not occur in the MTF/Air Reserve
Component Medical Units/Dental Clinics. Reprocessing may occur by a third party reprocessing
company that follows the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Good Manufacturing Practice
Guidelines and is a member of Association for Medical Device Reprocessors (AMDR).
3.10. Storage of Clean and Sterile Supplies.
   3.10.1. Storage areas will be in a clean, organized, environmentally controlled location.
   3.10.2. As a general rule, like items will be stored together (e.g., sterile with sterile and clean
   with clean). Store liquids on lower shelves or in containers that will hold the volume of the
   primary container if it should leak to prevent compromise to other supplies stored next to or
   below.
       3.10.2.1. Sterile and nonsterile patient treatment items may be stored in the same drawers
       or cabinets as long as there is no possibility of similar nonsterile items being used
AFI44-108 1 MARCH 2012                                                                        37


      inadvertently when sterility (e.g., sterile 4x4s and clean 4x4s) is required and the items
      are kept separated by wipe able dividers or containers.
      3.10.2.2. All supplies will to be rotated using a ―first in, first out‖ plan; so that older
      items are used first, thus preventing waste due to expiration.
      3.10.2.3. Supplies will be stored 8-10 inches above the floor (permits adequate cleaning
      of the floor), 18-20 inches below the ceiling (away from vents, fire sprinklers, and lights
      to safeguard supplies from damage and for compliance with the National Fire Protection
      Association [NFPA] 101, Code for Safety to Life from Fire in Buildings and Structures
      [The Life Safety Code], and approximately 2 inches from an outside wall (to protect
      package integrity and permit air circulation).
      3.10.2.4. Supplies will not be stored or piled on top of plastic covered racks, above
      cabinets, or in any other manner that may be deemed unsafe.
      3.10.2.5. Do not store sterile supplies or patient care items under the sink (or any
      location where they may become wet), on the floor, windowsills, or any area other than
      designated shelving or cabinets.
      3.10.2.6. Do not store sterile items with items not intended for clinical use (e.g., office
      supplies, cleaning supplies).
      3.10.2.7. No shipping boxes will be brought into patient care areas in the MTF, except to
      deliver supplies which are promptly placed into an appropriate clean storage bin.
          3.10.2.7.1. Shipping boxes are ―dirty‖. They are potentially laden with contamination
          from animal urine and feces which may serve as a mode of transmission of diseases
          associated with such contamination.
          3.10.2.7.2. Shipping boxes potentially house vectors such as roaches.
          3.10.2.7.3. Interior boxes may be used to store a supply item, but are discarded when
          the last item is used and not restocked or ―reused‖ to store other items.
      3.10.2.8. Rubber bands will not used to bundle items in soft packaging like peel packs
      together, they may compromise the integrity of the package.
      3.10.2.9. Chux or cloth towels will not be used to line drawers or shelves.
      3.10.2.10. Supply levels will be realistic and maintained in a sufficient quantity to serve
      the patient care demands.
      3.10.2.11. Personnel will check for outdated supplies monthly for any supplies
      manufactured within or outside of the MTF that have an expiration date. Those items
      without an expiration date are considered to be sterile until some event compromises the
      integrity of the package under the event related sterility system. Refer to paragraph 3.8.
      3.10.2.12. All supplies will be checked at point of use for expiration dates and for any
      event that may have compromised the integrity of the package (e.g., it becomes torn, wet
      by body fluids/water/antiseptics, dropped on a contaminated surface) before it is used for
      a patient.
3.11. Linen.
38                                                                 AFI44-108 1 MARCH 2012


  3.11.1. The IP will review the linen contract annually.
     3.11.1.1. Any concerns will be addressed through the MTF’s Linen Quality Assurance
     Evaluator (QAE) to the base Contracting Officer.
     3.11.1.2. The IP will tour the linen facility with the Linen QAE, prior to contract award
     for locally purchased contracts and annually thereafter, to evaluate and ensure the
     practice is IAW the scope of work for the contract.
     3.11.1.3. The IP may use an annual linen facility inspection report from another IP
     whose MTF has a contract with the same laundry facility and if the inspection was
     conducted using the CDC Guidelines for Environmental Infection Control in Health Care
     Facilities and The Healthcare Laundry Accreditation Council’s (HLAC) most current
     guidelines (Accreditation Standards for Processing Reusable Textiles for Use in
     Healthcare Facilities). The MTF that is providing the report will address any
     discrepancies uncovered during the inspection and provide follow-up reports to the MTF
     they are sharing the inspection report with. The report must address at a minimum the
     items listed below in paragraph 3.11.2.1-8.
  3.11.2. All laundry facility personnel must:
     3.11.2.1. Receive orientation and annual training in infection control IAW OSHA
     requirements (BBP, PPE, post-exposure procedures, hand hygiene, TB) through their
     company.
     3.11.2.2. Comply with OSHA BBP ECP, TB prevention, employee health program, and
     hand hygiene program.
     3.11.2.3. Use appropriate PPE especially in the receiving dock and separation area for
     contaminated linen
     3.11.2.4. Adhere to environmental and ventilation requirements
     3.11.2.5. Use appropriate temperatures and chemicals used during the washing process
     3.11.2.6. Separate clean and dirty linen during transport, processing, and delivery, and
     provides appropriate packaging of linen.
     3.11.2.7. Describe how sharps will be handled if found when separating contaminated
     linen to prevent exposures to personnel. How is this discovery communicated to the
     MTF where the linen was collected? (NOTE: a sample inspection checklist is located on
     the KX IC website under surveillance that may need to be updated with current
     guidelines.)
     3.11.2.8. The IP will report findings and any recommendations to the ICC/ICF.
  3.11.3. All clean linen will be transported and stored in carts used exclusively for this
  purpose or in linen carts that were cleaned and disinfected after being used to transport soiled
  linen.
     3.11.3.1. Clean linen will be stored in clean storage areas (e.g., dedicated linen rooms
     with closing door, covered carts, closed drawers or cabinets).
     3.11.3.2. Clean linen remains protected until the point of use.
AFI44-108 1 MARCH 2012                                                                          39


   3.11.4. Soiled linen will be handled in a manner that minimizes dispersal of particles into the
   air and surrounding area.
       3.11.4.1. Soiled linen will be placed in a rolling type hamper at the patient’s bedside or
       after use in a clinic. This will eliminate hand carrying by personnel down the corridors to
       a collection hamper.
       3.11.4.2. Any linen that is extremely soiled or wet may be wrapped loosely in clean linen
       or placed directly in a plastic bag then into the linen hamper.
   3.11.5. Linen hamper covers may be used for aesthetic purposes in traffic areas; if used, they
   must be kept clean.
   3.11.6. Linen will not be rinsed or sorted in MTFs that have a linen contract.
   3.11.7. Double bagging of soiled linen is not required unless the first bag has been damaged
   or is leaking.
   3.11.8. All soiled linen will be treated as potentially infectious so there is no need to ―color
   code‖ soiled linen into special bags based on isolation or amount of contamination. Must
   comply with state or host country requirements.
   3.11.9. Soiled linen will not be placed in red bags unless it is intended to be disposed of as
   regulated medical waste.
3.12. Regulated Medical Waste (RMW). RMW will be handled IAW state or host nation laws
governing the disposal of such waste. NOTE: If host nation standards are less stringent than
what would normally be adhered to in the U.S., personnel will hold to the more stringent
standard except as otherwise directed by the Command/Task Force Surgeon’s authority in
expeditionary operations.
3.13. HAMS/Clinic Housekeeping Contracts.
   3.13.1. HAMS contracts are centrally managed by HQ AFMSA/SGSLC and centrally
   procured by a single contracting office. Clinic Housekeeping contracts may be procured by
   local base contracting.
       3.13.1.1. The contract specifies the contractor that will provide cleaning to achieve an
       environment of ―total clean‖, ensuring the proper level of asepsis.
       3.13.1.2. Housekeeping personnel are employees of the civilian contract company.
       3.13.1.3. Appropriate ongoing, documented training of housekeepers is provided by the
       contractor.
   3.13.2. Housekeeping contracts indicate housekeepers shall clean all government owned
   property and equipment unless it is attached to a patient.
       3.13.2.1. Any equipment not to be cleaned by housekeeping personnel is referenced in
       the Individual Medical Facility Exhibit (IMFE).
       3.13.2.2. If an individual MTF, or section therein, determines that a specific piece of
       medical equipment should not be cleaned by housekeeping they must notify the
       Housekeeping Quality Assurance Evaluator (QAE) to update the IMFE.
40                                                                AFI44-108 1 MARCH 2012


  3.13.3. The ICC/ICF reviews housekeeping policies, procedures, and cleaning agents
  annually.
  3.13.4. Section managers (e.g., OIC, NCOIC, or designee in charge) will insure
  housekeeping personnel are appropriately informed of any patients with infectious or
  communicable disease or patients which have been placed in Protective Environment
  precautions. Posting of appropriate isolation or precaution signs is an effective method of
  communication.
  3.13.5. The Facility Manager manages the housekeeping function if performed ―in-house‖
  and serves as the QAE of the housekeeping contract. AFI 41-201, Managing Clinical
  Engineering Programs, Section 4.19, addresses the Facilities Manager’s role in housekeeping
  functions and with the ICC/ICF.
     3.13.5.1. Contract surveillance is a responsibility of a QAE assigned to Facility
     Management.
     3.13.5.2. QAEs are the only MTF agents authorized as liaisons between the users and
     contractor, except for emergency services.
     3.13.5.3. Questions regarding contractual requirements or performance will be addressed
     to the QAE.
  3.13.6. Housekeeping Customer. The employees, patients, and visitors of the MTF are the
  customers of the contract.
     3.13.6.1. The OIC, NCOIC or civilian equivalent for each MTF functional area conducts
     informal visual inspections on a regular basis (e.g., weekly, daily when the clinic is open)
     and complete the facility customer complaint form if work is not completed to their
     satisfaction.
     3.13.6.2. Observed deficiencies will be documented on the facility customer complaint
     form, one copy will be maintained and the rest of the copies are given to the QAE.
     3.13.6.3. The QAE will validate the customer complaint in accordance with the
     performance work statement (PWS).
     3.13.6.4. Discrepancies listed must be specific; a description of the problem, facility
     room number (e.g., 1H30), the name and phone number of the person reporting the
     problem.
     3.13.6.5. Customers will not contact the contractor or housekeeping personnel directly
     when a customer complaint form is written due to repeated or flagrant lapses in contract
     performance, except for emergency services.
     3.13.6.6. Customers will coordinate with the contractor to provide access to various
     rooms for which the contractor does not have access and for areas in which access must
     be closely monitored.
     3.13.6.7. All tasks are performed with minimum interruption to patient care.
  3.13.7. Emergency Service Response Procedures. Blood or body fluid spills are considered
  an emergency and housekeeping responds promptly to clean the area. If housekeeping
  service is not immediately available, health care workers may be taught to clean the spill
AFI44-108 1 MARCH 2012                                                                         41


   following the guidelines of 29 CFR Part 1910.1030, Occupational Exposure to Bloodborne
   Pathogens; Final Rule.
3.14. Ventilation.
   3.14.1. The Facility Manager will coordinate the monitoring of ventilation pattern (air flow
   pressure and air exchanges per hour) within the MTF.
       3.14.1.1. Areas to be tested include, but are not limited to, the operating rooms, delivery
       rooms, Central Sterile Supply, negative pressure/airborne isolation rooms, autopsy areas,
       minor surgical rooms such as cardiac catheterization labs or interventional radiology
       suites, dental instrument processing areas, rooms where glutaraldehyde is in use, and any
       other rooms deemed appropriate by the ICC/ICF based on the design or use of the room
       and/or building.
       3.14.1.2. Ventilation studies will be performed at least two times a year. More frequent
       studies may be performed as deemed necessary by the BEE or the ICC/ICF.
       3.14.1.3. The reports of the study will be submitted to the ICC/ICF.
   3.14.2. The Facility Manager will coordinate regular preventive maintenance of the
   ventilation system.
3.15. Medical Laser Use:
   3.15.1. Personnel will follow AORN guidelines to prevent staff working in the laser
   environment from exposure to the smoke plume generated during the use of the laser.
   Plumes may contain bioaerosols, viruses, blood fragments, bacteria spores, human papilloma
   virus (HPV) DNA and suspected hazards associated with the transmission of viable viruses
   such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Requirements for medical laser use include:
       3.15.1.1. To reduce smoke plume inhalation, the smoke plume will be captured by a
       smoke evacuator unit or wall suction unit with in-line filters. Laser smoke plume should
       be removed by use of local exhaust ventilation.
       3.15.1.2. Wear PPE which at a minimum requires high filtration surgical mask designed
       for use during laser procedures that generates a smoke plume, eye protection and
       protective clothing and gloves.
       3.15.1.3. Develop safe work practice controls to include education and training on the
       proper use of the equipment and the safety hazards associated with lasers, and
       maintenance of equipment IAW OSHA LASER safety regulations.
       3.15.1.4. BE must perform a through health risk assessment and review both the
       proposed work practices and PPE to ensure all applicable worker protection standards are
       met.

                                           Chapter 4

                       SURVEILLANCE POLICIES FOR AD MTFS

4.1. Requirements.
   4.1.1. AFMS directed that all MTFs with intensive care units will implement the Institute for
   Healthcare Improvement (IHI) Central Line Bundle per the 14 November 2007/SG3 Doc:
   07-115. IHI defines the Central Line Bundle as a group of evidence based interventions for
   patients with intravascular central catheters that, when implemented together, result in better
   outcomes than when implemented individually.
   4.1.2. AFMS directed    that all MTFs with intensive care units will implement the IHI
   Ventilator Bundle per   the 14 November 2007/SG3 Doc: 07-115. The IHI defines the
   Ventilator Bundle as    a series of interventions related to ventilator care that, when
   implemented together,   will achieve significantly better outcomes than when implemented
   individually.
   4.1.3. Health Affairs has directed that all MTFs within the Military Health System (MHS)
   with intensive care units will implement the CDC National Healthcare Safety Network
   (NHSN) Device Associated surveillance for the Central Line-Associated Bloodstream
   Infection [CLABSI] Events and Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia [VAP] Events per the HA
   POLICY: 08-020, Reporting Infection Prevention and Control Data to the Centers for
   Disease Control and Prevention Using the National Healthcare Safety Network, 4 Dec 2008.
4.2. Definition: Surveillance is defined as the ―ongoing, systematic collection, analysis,
interpretation and dissemination of data regarding a health related event for use in public health
action to reduce morbidity and mortality and to improve health‖. IPs use this definition to
reduce and prevent HAIs and to enhance the safety of patients, health care workers and visitors
in a timely and cost efficient manner.
4.3. Surveillance Appropriate to MTF.
   4.3.1. Surveillance will not be performed just for the sake of surveillance.
   4.3.2. Surveillance must be tailored by each MTF/LSMTF to maximize resources to focus
   on population characteristics, outcome priorities, to monitor a process and organizational
   objectives as determined by the MTF’s ICRA and as directed by DoD or AFMS. The goal is
   to look at processes and outcomes that may have significant impact on patient care practices,
   employee health, and safety. (e.g., survey laboratory results for epidemiologically significant
   pathogens such as MRSA to ensure providers have access to resistance patterns that will
   impact antibiotic prescribing practices; survey employee exposures to ensure work practices
   are safe; or appropriate safety devices are available for the task the health care worker is
   performing.).
4.4. Surveillance Activities in Annual ICPP. Surveillance activities are defined in the ICPP
which must be unique for each organization, but will incorporate the seven core APIC
Recommended Practices for Surveillance:
   4.4.1. Assess the population and/or areas to be surveyed. (Examples: all inpatients who have
   a cholecystectomy; all employees who are responsible for the cleaning/disinfection of the
AFI44-108 1 MARCH 2012                                                                        43


  endoscope; any patient admitted to an ICU with a central line; most frequently performed
  surgical or other invasive procedure, all applicable work areas.)
  4.4.2. Select the outcome or process to be surveyed. (Examples: all out patient GI
  endoscopic procedures; epidemiologically significant pathogens such as healthcare-
  associated Vancomycin Resistant Enterococci (VRE) or MRSA; surgical site infections or
  device associated infections like VAPs using NHSN; knowledge of how to clean-up blood
  spills or what to do if personnel sustain an exposure to blood or body fluids; frequency of the
  event; compliance to regulatory or accrediting body requirements; appropriate storage of
  supplies; visual observation of personnel administering immunizations; interviewing staff
  regarding their knowledge of standard precautions and isolation of contagious patients.)
  4.4.3. Use clearly defined written definitions, particularly standardized written definitions
  when available. All data elements should be clearly defined to include length of time the
  item will be surveyed dependent on what you are surveying (e.g., quarterly, twice a year, and
  annually). (Examples: CDC case definitions of Surgical Site Infection (SSI); IHI bundles; or
  the steps in the process like biological indicators. When appropriate, recommend the use of
  the CDC definitions.)
  4.4.4. Data collection should be managed by knowledgeable professionals qualified by
  training, experience, and access to appropriate information sources. (Examples: prospective
  review of patient record; lab results; prescribed antibiotics; electronic records [e.g., AHLTA,
  ICDB], visual observation of personnel who perform the cleaning of endoscopes.)
  4.4.5. Calculating and analyzing surveillance rates (if any). (Outcome measures examples:
  SSI rates; device specific incidence; blood or body fluid exposure incident. Process measure
  examples: immunization rates; surgical antibiotic prophylaxis timing; device utilization ratio;
  rate of compliance to the IHI bundles or hand hygiene protocol; compliance with appropriate
  storage of sterile supplies.)
     4.4.5.1. Any rate comparison will be IAW the definition used. (NOTE: It may be
     appropriate to perform statistical comparisons between the MTF rate and the comparison
     rate, [e.g., a Z-statistic, 95% confidence interval or a Fisher exact test], see APIC
     Infection Control Epidemiology, chapter 5.)
     4.4.5.2. Provider specific rates or trends will be presented to their Division or Service
     Chief/Medical Director and Flight Commander when appropriate.
  4.4.6. Risk stratification will be applied when appropriate. (Example: CDC NHSN risk
  stratification [CDC wound class, length of surgery, and American Society of
  Anesthesiologists [ASA] preoperative assessment score, in NICU surveillance by birth
  weight]. Risk category rates should be compared to CDC NHNS system data and to the
  internal rates of the previous year.)
  4.4.7. Reporting and feedback. Quarterly reports will be presented to the ICC/ICF and
  forwarded to ECOMS, EMC or their equivalent. Service specific rates and provider specific
  rates will be provided to respective flight commanders, when applicable.
     4.4.7.1. Rates exceeding established thresholds will be carried as ICC/ICF agenda items
     to ensure follow-up at subsequent meetings.
 44                                                                AFI44-108 1 MARCH 2012


      4.4.7.2. Develop a written report to provide a means to interpret and disseminate the
      surveillance data to the recipients who provide the service or procedures being surveyed
      and can bring about process improvement activities. Always report all surveillance
      activities to the ICC/ICF. Other recipients to be considered but are not all inclusive (e.g.
      ECOMS, Nursing Executive Function, Environment of Care Committee (EOC), PS, and
      PH).
4.5. Surveillance Reports.
   4.5.1. Will be submitted to the ICC/ICF, per the ICPP, for review and recommendations.
   For LSMTFs, the surveillance data will be submitted to ECOMS per the ICPP for review and
   recommendations.
   4.5.2. Will be provided as feedback to the provider(s) or health care worker(s) who perform
   the service(s) or processes being surveyed.
   4.5.3. Will be used as an opportunity to improve patient/employee/process outcome(s).
   4.5.4. If an outcome or process has remained stable or unchanged over an extended period of
   time (e.g., 6 months), consider discontinuing the surveillance, or reduce the length of time to
   survey an item or perform a smaller sample size instead, such as 10%. This will allow the
   resources to be applied to another process or outcome which poses a higher priority.
   Document in ICC/ICF minutes/summary and adjust the ICPP as appropriate. LSMTFs will
   document in the ECOMS minutes and adjust the ICPP as appropriate.
   4.5.5. Will be included in the Annual Summary.
AFI44-108 1 MARCH 2012                                                                            45


                                            Chapter 5

                    OPERATIONAL AND SPECIAL ENVIRONMENTS

5.1. Purpose.
   5.1.1. Managing Suspected Highly Communicable Diseases:
       5.1.1.1. AFI 41-307, Aeromedical Evacuation Patient Considerations and Standards of
       Care, contains guidelines that direct the movement regulation of the suspected casualties
       or HCWs who may exhibit clinical indicators of a Bioterrorism (BT) agent and/or a
       highly communicable disease from the CDC critical list (CL).
       5.1.1.2. All medical personnel will be aware of the clinical indicators and the reporting
       categories (refer to Rule Out Clinical [ROC] Indicator List, Attachment 2) that may
       indicate a casualty or medical personnel may be infected with a highly infectious disease
       or biological agent.
5.2. Goal: To generate a heightened awareness of infection control issues to be considered in
the deployment of medical personnel for both home station and expeditionary operations.
Identifying and treating emerging infectious disease, whether natural or manmade, must become
second nature as we strive to provide the best prevention advice and medical care possible for
both domestic and foreign troops as well as civilians. Basic principles of infection control such
as hand washing, aseptic technique, standard precautions, isolation, and PPE become more, not
less, important in field conditions. This guideline will assist in identifying important issues and
possible solutions for the field environment but because each mission is unique it is not possible
to cover all contingencies.
5.3. General Roles and Responsibilities:
   5.3.1. All personnel will practice basic infection control techniques per paragraph 3.4.
   5.3.2. Civil Engineers (CE) in large deployments will arrive prior to medical personnel to set
   up the site which will include water and sewage and will also be helpful in identifying proper
   waste disposal methods.
   5.3.3. Bioenvironmental Engineering (BE) will make recommendations on where to obtain
   water, provides instruction for the proper chlorination of the water and are responsible to test
   all water sources.
5.4. Patient Care Practices.
   5.4.1. Comply with hand hygiene guidelines per CDC or WHO depending on the availability
   of running water.
   5.4.2. PPE has an increased significance during deployment based on diseases endemic to
   the given area. These may include the bloodborne pathogens (HIV, Hepatitis B and C) and
   other communicable diseases; refer to the PH deployment briefing.
5.5. Patient Placement.
   5.5.1. Patient placement options can be limited by space constraints or the physical set up of
   unit. Isolation strategies may be greatly affected by these constraints. It is important to try to
   geographically separate a patient who needs isolation. To decrease the possibility of disease
46                                                                 AFI44-108 1 MARCH 2012


  transmission, group patients with like symptoms and also cohort the staff assigned to these
  patients (especially during outbreaks).
  5.5.2. Airborne: A negative airflow room is preferred to vent the airborne particles out of the
  work area to allow the ultra violet (UV) rays from the sun to kill the Mycobacterium
  tuberculosis and other airborne pathogens while any wind currents will further dilute the
  organisms reducing the probability of exposure to others.
     5.5.2.1. Possible solutions to create a negative airflow:
         5.5.2.1.1. Geographically place all airborne isolated patients together near a window
         by disease type (e.g., chickenpox, measles or TB). Ensure the selected window is not
         near a high traffic pathway on the other side. Open a window and place a fan in the
         window so it blows to the outside; this may create a negative pressure if all other
         doors are kept closed. It is important to place the potentially infectious patient near
         the window so air is drawn to the outside without traveling across any other patient.
         All personnel working in the area will still wear the appropriate mask (N95
         respirator). Have the patient wear a surgical mask (recommend the cup style, due to
         its fit) when personnel are in the area. The patient must be educated on when and
         how to change the mask, the need for coughing and sneezing into a tissue, and how to
         properly dispose of the tissue.
         5.5.2.1.2. Use the natural air currents available to blow in across the patient and
         immediately out another window next to the patient. It will be important to monitor
         the flow of air for directional changes in the air current which can occur without
         warning.
         5.5.2.1.3. If it is not possible to create negative airflow due to weather conditions or
         the non-availability of fans, geographically separate the patient as far away from
         other patients as possible. Ideally, place them in a separate room with a divider (door,
         plastic, canvas, or blanket) that will act as a barrier to help protect other patient and
         personnel areas. All personnel working in the area will wear the appropriate mask
         (N95 respirator).
         5.5.2.1.4. During transport and when the infectious patient cannot be separated from
         the rest of the patients, all patients and personnel working in the area will wear an
         appropriate mask (N95 respirator) even if they are not directly taking care of the
         patient. Patients may be kept in an open area (outside) if weather permits.
         5.5.2.1.5. If the patient is being placed in Airborne precautions because of
         chickenpox, disseminated shingles, or measles, only those health care workers with
         documented immunity should care for these patients. Ascertain the immune status of
         the other patients in the area. If the patients in the immediate area are immune to
         chickenpox and measles then the amount of precautions may be altered depending on
         the immune status of personnel and the other patients.
  5.5.3. Droplet precautions: Patient bed placement will be at least four (4) feet apart (from
  mattress to mattress) to support this type of isolation (or as directed by the CDC). If a four
  (4) foot separation is not possible, consider having the patient wear a mask and augment with
  head-to-toe bed configuration. The patient should also wear a mask during any transport.
  The patient may wear a surgical mask (recommend the cup style due to its fit) when
AFI44-108 1 MARCH 2012                                                                          47


   personnel are in the area. If possible group like symptoms with like symptoms in the patients
   and cohort staff assigned to care for these infected patients, especially during outbreaks.
   5.5.4. Contact precautions: The goal is to keep post operative patients, and patients with
   invasive lines (IV, drainage tubes, indwelling catheters) away from patients placed on contact
   isolation precautions. If possible group like symptoms with like symptoms in the patients
   and cohort staff assigned to care for these infected patients, especially during outbreaks.
5.6. Supplies and Equipment.
   5.6.1. Supplies and equipment will be stored in a way that will protect them from extremes
   in temperature (heat or cold), environmental dust and dirt, vermin and insects, light and
   moisture. Seasonal variations may mean a change in storage practices or location during a
   rainy season, winter or summer seasons. Listed are some examples of creative ways to help
   organize and keep the storage area clean.
      5.6.1.1. Pallets will be placed over gravel at the entrance of the storage area to be used to
      kick mud and dirt off of boots before entering.
      5.6.1.2. The footlocker type of transport boxes in which many supplies arrive can be
      used as shelves. Place the lid on the ground and place the box on its side. Store those
      items that can be cleaned and dried (non-critical items like bedpans) on the bottom in
      case the area floods. Keep the sterile and clean packaged items up higher.
      5.6.1.3. Be aware of lumber that can be transformed into shelves. Wood is porous so
      only non-critical items should be placed on the wood. Protect the other items in plastic as
      much as possible. Save all plastic wrappers to be used as covers when needed. A change
      in the weather or a seasonal abundance of a particular insect could warrant a need for
      different levels of protection.
          5.6.1.3.1. Cleaning of supplies and equipment is required and the disinfectant used
          may vary. Bleach is the most common but in many ways the most hazardous if not
          mixed correctly. Manufacturer’s directions for the use of chemicals will be followed
          whenever possible. Preferably, the disinfectant will be tuberculocidal because it is
          likely it will also kill Hepatitis B and C and HIV.
          5.6.1.3.2. Monitor stock levels to determine the need to conserve certain non-critical
          items that come into contact with intact skin, such as bedpans, urinals, or washbasins.
          If so, these items can be washed with soap and water then disinfected with a diluted
          bleach solution or another disinfectant after each use. Store in plastic if available but
          if not available, store in a clean place. Before using the item, make sure any dust that
          may have collected during storage is cleaned off with soap and water.
          5.6.1.3.3. Urinals and bedpans will be rinsed after each use with water. Those used
          for more than one week will be washed with a detergent. If a patient has diarrhea,
          rinse the bedpan out with soap and water and then rinse with a disinfectant after each
          use.
5.7. Environmental Controls.
   5.7.1. All personnel will be responsible for the cleaning and upkeep of the health care
   environment. Housekeeping contractors may not be available. If available, they likely will
 48                                                               AFI44-108 1 MARCH 2012


   be from the local civilian population and may have limited knowledge. A cleaning schedule
   will be designed and followed. Listed below are some basic cleaning principles:
       5.7.1.1. Work site should be maintained in a clean sanitary condition. A cleaning
       schedule must be determined, implemented, and strictly enforced to maintain a standard
       of cleanliness. Cleaning follows a workflow pattern which moves from the least soiled
       areas to the most soiled areas and from the ceiling to the floor.
       5.7.1.2. Cleaning products will be selected based on their use, efficacy, acceptability,
       safety, cost and availability. The goal of cleaning and disinfecting is to decrease the
       microbial load of the environment.
       5.7.1.3. All trash and garbage will be emptied and placed in the designated waste
       disposal site every shift and as needed to prevent accumulation. This action will help
       control insects and rodents.
       5.7.1.4. Wards and vestibules in tents will be swept once a shift and as needed. Mop
       with a detergent or disinfectant (e.g., A-33) at least daily and as needed. Do not mop
       with a wet, drippy mop because it will cause pooling of water and encourage the growth
       of mildew in the Velcro.
       5.7.1.5. Blood and body fluid spills may be cleaned using a 1:10 dilution of 6% sodium
       hypochlorite (household bleach) and water. Follow these steps:
          5.7.1.5.1. Cordon off the area so personnel will not slip or track blood through the
          area.
          5.7.1.5.2. Don appropriate PPE.
          5.7.1.5.3. Prepare the bleach solution by mixing one part bleach to nine parts water in
          a mop bucket. Flood the area with the bleach solution being careful not to let the mop
          touch the blood spill and let stand 10 minutes.
          5.7.1.5.4. Blot up as much of the blood or body fluid spill as possible with disposable
          towels. Throw away the towels into a universally labeled biohazard bag.
          5.7.1.5.5. Flood the area a second time with the bleach solution being careful not to
          let the mop touch the blood spill and let stand 10 minutes.
          5.7.1.5.6. Use a towel or a mop to finish cleaning the area. Dispose of the bleach
          mixture appropriately. Take off the PPE and discard appropriately.
       5.7.1.6. For small blood or body fluid spills, spill kits can be made easily and
       inexpensively by gathering the items listed below:
          5.7.1.6.1. 150 ml sodium hypochlorite in a brown plastic, 150 - 250 ml. bottle.
          5.7.1.6.2. Two sponges.
          5.7.1.6.3. One pair of gloves.
          5.7.1.6.4. One leak proof bag with the universal biohazard label.
          5.7.1.6.5. Place all above items into a bottle or container, which can then become the
          ―bucket‖ for the bleach solution. Store in any area where a spill may occur.
5.8. Disinfectants.
AFI44-108 1 MARCH 2012                                                                        49


   5.8.1. Bleach.
      5.8.1.1. Bleach does not contain a detergent therefore cannot ―clean‖ the environment of
      dirt or debris. The area must be cleaned with a detergent then followed with bleach to
      disinfect.
      5.8.1.2. One to a hundred (1:100) dilution of bleach is strong enough for environmental
      disinfecting. Bleach can be stored in an opaque plastic bottle for one month. Do not
      store bleach in glass. Label name of disinfectant, dilution, date made and date it expires.
      5.8.1.3. Do not mix bleach with other detergents or disinfectants (e.g., phenolics such as
      Wexide) as it can produce harmful fumes. Wear the appropriate PPE when working with
      bleach.
   5.8.2. Alcohol.
      5.8.2.1. Alcohol is also a good disinfectant but not a good ―cleaner‖. The area must be
      cleaned with a detergent then followed with alcohol to disinfect.
      5.8.2.2. Cotton will break down the alcohol making it ineffective; do not store cotton in
      alcohol.
      5.8.2.3. Alcohol is not recommended for use as a sterilant. In the appropriate
      concentrations of 60-90%, alcohol will kill the vegetative forms of bacteria. It is also
      tuberculocidal, fungicidal and virucidal, but does not destroy bacterial spores such as
      Clostridium difficile or Clostridium perfringens. Alcohol is volatile and requires storage
      in a cool place.
   5.8.3. A33, Dry Disinfectant/Detergent.
      5.8.3.1. Contains a dual quaternary ammonium chloride in a premeasured packet which
      is dissolved in one gallon of water. Like all quaternary ammonia compounds it cleans by
      the removal of soil and also disinfects. It also neutralizes odors. Use this product to
      clean walls, floors and other nonporous hard surfaces
      5.8.3.2. Do not use this product on medical instruments
5.9. Miscellaneous Environmental Issues. (Refer to Attachment 3)
   5.9.1. Linen: Storage and handling of contaminated, dirty linen will vary with each
   deployment so the procedures will depend on the resources available at the particular site.
   5.9.2. Disposal of medical waste will vary with each deployment. CE will assist with
   providing guidance on acceptable and appropriate disposal methods.
   5.9.3. Sharps, splash or other body fluid exposure injuries will be reported to the supervisor
   and PH. PH will monitor and follow up all injuries.

           MANAGING SUSPECTED HIGHLY COMMUNICABLE DISEASES

RULE OUT CLINICAL (ROC) INDICATORS LIST

A.2.1. The following five key indicators, if present, suggest a highly communicable infectious
disease. These patients may pose a serious disease threat to health care providers, aircrews,
casual contacts and receiving communities. These indicators are classified into five categories.
NOTE: A ―YES‖ to Categories 2-5 should prompt immediate telephone consultation with the
Theater Validating Flight Surgeon (VFS). Category 1 alone does not necessarily require
consultation.

1. POSITIVE HISTORY OF EXPOSURE PLUS ANY OF THE OTHER FOUR CATEGORIES
 1. Exposure to sewage, body fluids, and animals prior to illness
 2. Report of insect bites

2. FEVER (Oral temperature greater or equal to 102 F or 38.8C)

3. ABNORMAL BLEEDING
 1. Bleeding from gums or nose
 2. Petechiae on palate, throat, or on mouth exam
 3. Patient’s eyes are ―bloodshot‖ in appearance (conjuctival injections)
 4. Bloody stools or vomitus

4. ADENOPATHY
 1. Tender or painful lymph nodes
 2. Report of lymph nodes with a ―bruised‖ or darkened appearance
 3. ―Matted‖ lymph nodes,‖ ―goose-egg‖ size lymph nodes or lymph nodes draining pus

5. RAPID RESPIRATORY DECLINE, RASHES/SKIN CHANGES, UNUSUAL
DETERIORATION
 1. Rapid progression to severe symptoms and illness over a period of less than three days, once
    the patient began to feel ill
 2. ―Pox‖ or ―pox-like‖ skin rash/lesion
 1. Petechiae or purpura on the skin
 1. Positive ―Tourniquet Test‖ (Inflating a BP cuff on an extremity performs this test. It is
    considered positive if small hemorrhages – ―Petechiae‖ – appear on the skin of the extremity

  EXAMPLES OF COMPLIANCE AND PROCESS SURVEILLANCE FOR LSMTFS,
  DENTAL CLINICS, AESS, AND AIR RESERVE COMPONENT MEDICAL UNITS

A.6.1. DEFINITION: Process surveillance includes the series of steps taken to achieve a desired
outcome. Compliance surveillance ensures personnel compliance with the IC policies per the
Unit's Infection Prevention and Control Program.

A.6.2. PURPOSE: Assess the knowledge level of personnel as they perform their assigned duties.
Are they compliant and understand their role and responsibilities as it applies to the Infection
Prevention and Control Program procedures? AESs, Air Reserve Component Medical Units and
LSMTFs have a limited scope of practice and do not perform invasive procedures so are unable
to generate risk stratification and quantifiable data and are not required to report routine infection
rates. Surveillance focus will be more process, rather than outcome, oriented.

A.6.3. METHOD: Observation and verbal questioning/interviews of any unit personnel. Use a
checklist guide to standardize your interview questions/observational goals as you observe or
interview personnel.

A.6.4. ACTION: Correct infractions and /or deficiencies with education, product change,
practice.

A.6.5. EXAMPLES: The list below is not exhaustive:

A.6.5.1. Handwashing: Does the staff wash or sanitize their hands when the opportunity
presents itself (based on CDC standards)? Does the staff have knowledge and practice
appropriate hand washing techniques? Do the staff members have artificial nails, nail extenders
or long nails? For example, at most institutions artificial/long nails are prohibited for health care
workers (HCW) performing patient care.

A.6.5.2. Supply Storage: Are soiled and contaminated supplies separated from those that are
clean and sterile? Are supplies stored 8-10 inches above the floor (to permit adequate cleaning
of the floor), 18-20 inches below the ceiling, (away from vents, sprinklers, and lights to safe
guard supplies from damage)? Are sterile and clean supplies stored on shelves, bins, or in
drawers designed to protect the items from damage? Is supply rotation of ―first in first out‖
being used? Are washable storage bins with dividers made of a non-porous material used? Are
shelves being wiped down? Are outdated supplies found? Is the storage area clean? Are
cardboard shipping boxes stored in areas with clean/sterile supplies?

A.6.5.3. Equipment cleaning/disinfection/sterilization: Primarily for areas that perform these
activities such as units with an Aerospace Medical Mission. Are appropriate personnel trained in
cleaning/disinfecting/ sterilization and the required documentation? Is appropriate cleaning
being accomplished in patient care areas to include: the correct environmental cleaner? Is spore
testing being done per protocol and documented where sterilizers are being used?

A.6.5.4. Employee Health Program (EHP): Is compliance to EHP demonstrated by compliance to
AFI44-108 1 MARCH 2012                                                                          87


immunizations? (Flu-MMR-HAV-HBV-chickenpox-documentation) Compliance to EHP
demonstrated by compliance to required testing (examples: PPD-HIV). Work restrictions
concerning communicable diseases? Do personnel know the proper procedure if they sustain an
exposure to blood or body fluids, are they able to initiate the Blood borne exposure control
pathogen program appropriately? Do they understand their role in the Tuberculosis (TB) Control
Plan? Do they practice Standard Precautions appropriately? Are blood spills cleaned-up IAW
with policies?

A.6.5.5. Exposure incident: Is there documentation of incident and follow-up of exposed person
and source? Are safety devices available per OSHA regulations? Are safety devices being used
appropriately? Has the health care worker been fit tested on the N95 respirator if they take care
of a patient with/or suspected TB? If not, do they know where to get fit-tested?

A.6.5.6. Visual inspection: Do personnel know where to go to get information concerning
Infection Prevention in the unit? Is the general environment clean? Storage of supplies: Is there
appropriate rotation, removal of outdated items, cleanliness of area? Linen: Is there protected
storage and cleanliness of storage area?

A.6.5.7. Unique environmental issues for special workplaces: Are infection control practices
maintained in the Immunization Clinic/mobile immunization lines, Dental Clinic, Laboratories,
Aircraft, and Patient exam rooms. Does staff know where to get personal protective equipment
(PPE)? Are personnel performing risk-associated activities by using task appropriate PPE and
techniques? Is regulated waste (if any) disposed of IAW local policy? Does food or drink
consumption occur only in designated areas within the clinic? Are unit members familiar with
the intent of Standard or Transmission Based Precautions? Are needles and syringes placed
intact in sharps containers after use? Has the HCW been familiarized with the safety devices
used in the LSMTFS/Air Reserve Component Medical Units?

A.6.5.8. Has the Air Force Reserve or Air National Guard member been given a briefing on
issues related to health/infection prevention and control prior to a mobilization?

A.6.5.9. Have OSHA/infection control briefings been properly documented (e.g., Form 55,
MRDSS)?

A.6.5.10. Immunizations: Are immunization refrigerators being monitored daily? Is there an
alarm system to notify personnel that a malfunction has occurred? Are only immunizations
stored in the refrigerators? Are the immunization refrigerators being cleaned on a routine basis?

A.6.6. NOTE: AESs, Air Reserve Component Medical Units and LSMTFs with their limited
focus should concentrate their surveillance efforts on monitoring mission specific compliance
items of the IC Program. For example, when performing procedures like a dental check-up,
providing immunizations, separation of waste into red bag versus regular trash bags or hand
washing is there compliance with the established process for that procedure. Other examples
may be found above, but do not limit your surveillance to the above listed items.

 HEPATITIS B VACCINE DECLINATION (MANDATORY) APPENDIX A TO 29 CFR
              1910.1030 BLOODBORNE PATHOGEN STANDARD

I understand that due to my occupational exposure to blood or other potentially infectious
materials (OPIM) I may be at risk of acquiring Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. I have
been given the opportunity to be vaccinated with Hepatitis B vaccine, at no charge to
myself. However, I decline Hepatitis B vaccination at this time. I understand that by
declining this vaccine, I continue to be at risk of acquiring Hepatitis B, a serious disease. If
in the future I continue to have occupational exposure to blood or OPIM and I wish to be
vaccinated with Hepatitis B vaccine, I can receive the vaccination series at no charge to me.
