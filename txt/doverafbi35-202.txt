1. GENERAL: All noise complaints involving Dover Air Force Base missions and/or assets
will be handled by 436 AW/PA without referring callers to other bases or commands, and
without dismissing calls as harassment. 436 AW/PA Public Affairs (PA) members will provide
timely, fully-coordinated, responsive, and factual answers to noise complaints in an effort to
maintain positive community relations.
2. RESPONSIBILITES: The Public Affairs Office and the 436th Operations Group
Commander (436 OG/CC) will review the status of community relations with respect to noise at
the quarterly ESOH council. PA will assist, as requested, in the coordination and implementation
of any base project or program designed to mitigate noise.
     2.1. 436 OG/OGV is responsible for working with the Chief of PA as required, to maintain
     and update noise sensitive areas. 436 OG/OGV and 436 OSS/OSA will maintain maps
     depicting these areas and post them in the flight planning area of Base Operations and the Air
     Traffic Control facilities.
     2.2. The Air Installation Compatible Use Zone (AICUZ) Manager (CE/CES) is responsible
     for working with the Chief of PA as required, to accomplish periodic Air Installation
     Compatible Use Zone studies.
3. RESEARCHING AND RECORDING NOISE COMPLAINTS: Public Affairs will
record all available information.
     3.1. Once the complaint is received, PA will research the complaint locally to determine the
     probable owner of the aircraft involved. 436 OG/OGV will assist in identifying aircraft that
     were in the local area to include civilians and non-assigned aircraft.
     3.2. All noise complaints received must be recorded on the excel spreadsheet – Noise
     Complaint Log (located on the PA O:Drive). List date, time, caller's name, if they've
     requested a reply; and the actions taken (who was contacted). Contact Airfield 436 OG/OGV
     and notify him/her of the complaint.
     3.3. Complaint inquiries regarding engine run-up noise should be coordinated and
     researched with the 436 Maintenance Group Commander (677-3331).
     3.4. Contact other military flying units or, if necessary, the Federal Aviation Administration
     (FAA) in Philadelphia, PA (610-595-1500) or the FAA in Baltimore, MD (410-787-0040) to
     determine the origin of aircraft not assigned to Dover AFB.
     3.5. Noise complaints dealing with C-130 and A-10 training operations in Southern
     Delaware should be referred to base operations at the 175th Wing, Maryland Air National
     Guard at Martin State Airport in Baltimore, MD (410-918-6375/76). Fighter aircraft queries
     should be directed to base operations at Oceana Naval Air Station in Virginia Beach, VA
     (757-433-2162/63) and Langley AFB PA in Hampton, VA (757-764-2010).
     3.6. If the responsible unit is identified, make a courtesy call to that unit to inform them of
     the complaint.
4. RESPONDING TO CALLERS: Respond to the complaint. Be tactful and factual.
     4.1. Once PA has gathered the information from 436 OG/OGV, they will respond to the
     caller.

  4.2. If the problem can be solved through standard noise abatement procedures (contacting
  base operations/command post/control tower and aircraft), explain these procedures to the
  caller and the actions taken to reinforce those procedures. (Noise abatement information can
  be found in the AICUZ Study, March 1999 or AICUZ Brochure, December 2005.)
  4.3. If the base is unable to mitigate the noise, explain to the caller the vital necessity of
  conducting such training/missions in the interest of national defense.
  4.4. Convey the base's sincere interest in keeping noise to an absolute minimum while still
  maintaining readiness.
  4.5. Refer caller to the Legal office (Claims Section, 677-3352) if damages are claimed.
  4.6. Make no official statement that the Air Force is at fault.
  4.7. Do not make comments that can be construed as a prejudgment of a claim before the
  incident has been investigated.
