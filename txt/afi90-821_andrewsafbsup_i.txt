                                                Chapter 1

                                           INTRODUCTION

Section 1A—Overview

1.1. Purpose. Hazardous chemicals are found in virtually every Air Force operation, including aircraft
and missile maintenance, civil engineering, transportation, supply, medical, and support functions. This
AFI is intended to minimize the incidence of chemically induced occupational illnesses and injuries in the
workplace by establishing guidance for training employees on the health and physical hazards associated
with, and proper preventive measures to be taken when, using or handling hazardous chemicals in work
area/shop(s). This program is commonly referred to as the Hazard Communication (HAZCOM) Program,
and is not to be confused with other separate and distinct entities such as Hazardous Waste Operations and
Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) and the Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT) Management Program
(HMMP). HAZCOM is a performance-based program with separate training requirements and successful
implementation can only be measured by evaluating worker awareness of work area/shop hazards.

1.2. Scope.
    1.2.1. This AFI provides the requirements for an effective Air Force HAZCOM Program for those
    work area/shop(s) that have workers that handle or use hazardous chemicals. All employees that work
    in an environment where any chemical is known to be present in such a manner that employees may
    be exposed under normal conditions of use or in a foreseeable emergency, will be provided informa-
    tion about the hazardous chemicals to which they are exposed. This information shall be provided by
    means of a hazard communication program, including but not limited to material safety data sheets
    (MSDSs), labels, and other forms of warning, and information [e.g. AF Form 3952, Chemical/Haz-
    ardous Material Request/Authorization Forms, Bioenvironmental Engineering (BE) shop survey let-
    ters] and training.
    1.2.2. This AFI applies to:
       1.2.2.1. All U.S. Air Force military and civilian personnel, direct-hire foreign nationals, and indi-
       rect-hire foreign employees at Air Force installations within the Continental United States
       (CONUS), or its territories, GOCOs, GSUs, and in foreign countries as established in accordance
       with the applicable Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA).
       1.2.2.2. The Air Force Reserves, the Air National Guard, and direct reporting units (DRU) and
       field operating agencies (FOA) not located on Air Force installations.
       1.2.2.3. All Air Force military and civilian personnel who use, handle, or may be potentially
       exposed to chemical hazards while working under a contractor or working in contractor facilities.
       Where feasible, Air Force personnel may be included in the contractor’s Federal compliant hazard
       communication program. The Air Force retains ultimate responsibility for Air Force personnel
       participation and oversight.
       1.2.2.4. Contractor employees who are employed at Air Force-owned or operated facilities
       when authorized by the Contracting Officer in coordination with BE with the following excep-
       tions:
AFI90-821_ANDREWSAFBSUP_I 18 JUNE 2008                                                                  5


          1.2.2.4.1. This AFI does not excuse contractors, as stipulated in their specific contracts, from
          their compliance obligations under OSHA’s Federal HAZCOM regulation or any applicable
          State and local requirements.
          1.2.2.4.2. Contractors are required to train their own employees in accordance with Federal
          HAZCOM and any applicable State and local requirements. Contractors are not authorized to
          use the AF HAZCOM Program for this purpose.
   1.2.3. The Federal HAZCOM Standard has primacy over state programs at Air Force installations
   even if the state has an OSHA-approved state program.
   1.2.4. Materials exempted from this standard are listed under the Hazard Communication Program
   description contained in Para. 2.2.
   1.2.5. In work operations such as warehousing where employees only handle chemicals in sealed
   containers which are not opened under normal conditions of use, this instruction applies to these oper-
   ations only as follows:
       1.2.5.1. Supervisors will ensure labels on incoming containers of hazardous chemicals are not
       removed or defaced.
       1.2.5.2. MSDSs received with incoming shipments of sealed containers will be maintained, and
       employees will have access to the MSDSs. If hazardous chemicals received do not have MSDSs,
       they will be obtained as soon as possible.
       1.2.5.3. Supervisors will train employees on the hazards of the chemicals in their work area/shop,
       and to the extent necessary to protect them in the event of a spill or leak of a hazardous chemical
       from a sealed container.

                                               Chapter 2

                            HAZARD COMMUNICATION PROGRAM

2.1. Introduction. AF HAZCOM program requirements apply to any chemical hazard, except as stated
in Para. 2.2. below, known to be present in work area/shop(s) in such a manner employees may be
exposed under normal conditions of use or in a foreseeable emergency.

2.2. Materials Exempt from the AF HAZCOM Program. AF HAZCOM program requirements do
not apply to the following.
   2.2.1. Hazardous wastes regulated under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA).
   2.2.2. Hazardous substances subject to a remedial action or removal action under the Comprehensive
   Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA).
   2.2.3. Tobacco or tobacco products.
   2.2.4. Wood or wood products that will not be processed.
   2.2.5. Articles. An article is a manufactured item other than fluid or particle: (1) which is formed to
   a specific shape or design during manufacture; (2) which has end-use function(s) dependent in whole
   or in part upon its shape or design during end use; and (3) which under normal conditions of use does
   not release more than very small quantities, e.g., minute or trace amounts of hazardous chemicals [as
   determined under 29 CFR 1910.1200(d)], and does not pose a physical hazard or health risk to
   employees.
   2.2.6. Food or alcoholic beverages.
   2.2.7. Drugs in final form [such as non-prescription and prescription, dry pelletized drugs, e.g., pills
   or caplets].
   2.2.8. Cosmetics.
   2.2.9. Consumer products in normal consumer use such as vehicle propane tanks, copier toner, etc
   (i.e., material usage in the workplace is for the purpose intended by the chemical manufacturer or
   importer of the product, and the use results in a duration and frequency of exposure which is not
   greater than the range of exposures that could reasonably be experienced by consumers when used for
   the purpose intended).
      2.2.9.1. Whether consumer product materials are subject to the AF HAZCOM program and
      require training requires a case-by-case judgment by the supervisor in consultation with BE. For
      example:
          2.2.9.1.1. Personnel who use window cleaner fluid to clean infrequently will not require this
          training; however, maintenance personnel using the same window cleaner daily will require
          training.
          2.2.9.1.2. Patrons using automotive cleaners at the auto skills center will not require training;
          however, auto skills center employees and LRS transportation personnel using the same
          cleaner as part of their job will require training.
   2.2.10. Nuisance particulates such as copier toner.

     2.2.11. Ionizing and non-ionizing radiation.
     2.2.12. Biological hazards.
     2.2.13. Munitions as defined in AFI 32-7086, Hazardous Materials Management.

2.3. Installation Written Hazard Communication Program. Each Air Force installation whose
employees will potentially be exposed to hazardous materials not exempted as described in Para. 2.2.
must create a written hazard communication program to support work area/shop implementation of the
HAZCOM program. The written program must include installation-specific procedures to meet the
HAZCOM program requirements and specifically, will include:
     2.3.1. How MSDSs are accessible to employees (see Para. 2.5.).
     2.3.2. Container labeling procedures and requirements (see Para. 2.6.).
     2.3.3. Training requirements and procedures (see Para. 2.7.).
     2.3.4. Chemical inventory requirements (see Para. 2.8.).
     2.3.5. Procedures for informing employees regarding hazards of non-routine tasks and unlabeled
     pipes (see Para. 2.9.).
     2.3.6. Procedures for determining the hazard of a chemical (See Para. 2.4.; applies to only work area/
     shops which produce hazardous chemicals).
     2.3.7. (Added-ANDREWS) Written Hazard Communication Program. Supervisors using and/or
     handling hazardous materials will maintain a written Hazard Communication Program Book. The
     book will consist of a three-ring binder divided into seven sections or tabs. The binder will be labeled
     with the squadron/organization, workplace name and the words “Hazard Communication Program
     Book”. The written Hazard Communication Program book will have the following information con-
     tained in the sections or tabs of one binder (if required additional binders can be used for material
     safety data sheets (MSDSs)).
        2.3.7.1. (Added-ANDREWS) Tab A - A copy of this supplement.
        2.3.7.2. (Added-ANDREWS) Tab B - A copy of AFI 90-821. If instructions are maintained in a
        separate area, an appropriate DoD Form 2861, Cross Reference, must be in place.
        2.3.7.3. (Added-ANDREWS) Tab C - A hazardous chemical inventory for the work area. As a
        minimum, the hazardous chemical inventory will be prepared in the format specified in Attach-
        ment 1. The chemical inventory must be cross-referenced with the appropriate MSDSs. Shops
        may use EMIS or ESOH-MIS generated chemical inventories as long as the above requirements
        are met. The hazardous chemical inventory for this area will be developed by the work area super-
        visor. The supervisor will maintain the hazardous chemical inventory in the work area and update
        this inventory.
        2.3.7.4. (Added-ANDREWS) Tab D – A list of non-routine tasks involving hazardous materials
        and the potential chemical hazards. The list of non-routine tasks will be prepared in the format
        specified in Attachment 2.
        2.3.7.5. (Added-ANDREWS) Tab E – AF Form 55, Employee Safety and Health Record, or an
        approved computerized training documentation system for all employees trained on this program.
        Computer-automated training databases, such as CAMS, may be used for tracking and document-
AFI90-821_ANDREWSAFBSUP_I 18 JUNE 2008                                                                  13


       ing training as long as they are approved by both the Public Health Flight and the Bioenvironmen-
       tal Engineering Flight (BEF). If the records are maintained elsewhere, a DoD Form 2861, may be
       substituted and will include the location of the training records. All training documentation on AF
       Form 55 will include the date of initial HAZCOM and subsequent training. Training documenta-
       tion will include signature of trainee and supervisor for each new entry.
       2.3.7.6. (Added-ANDREWS) Tab F – Completed Attachment 3, Hazard Communication Pro-
       gram Checklist of this supplement. Supervisors shall complete Attachment 3 as part of a program
       self-assessment at least annually. The BEF will review the work center’s HAZCOM program dur-
       ing annual or bi-annual routine occupational health risk assessment surveys.
       2.3.7.7. (Added-ANDREWS) Tab G – Copies of Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) for all
       hazardous materials the workplace uses. Material Safety Data Sheets must be manufacturer and
       product specific. If a “Right to Know” station is set up in the shop, a DoD Form 2861 may be sub-
       stituted and will include the location of the MSDSs on the form. If MSDSs are maintained in an
       electronic version (e.g. CD-ROM or on-line), electronic access must be readily available to all
       workers on all shifts. This tab must clearly describe the primary access location and the back-up
       system used in case primary computer access is disrupted. Workcenters must obtain approval for
       their electronic access plan from BEF prior to initiating the plan.

2.4. Hazard Determination: The Air Force will rely on the hazard determination of the supplier or man-
ufacturer of purchased chemicals. For Air Force produced chemicals, the Air Force activity controlling
the formulation will make the hazard determination and produce an MSDS IAW 29 CFR 1910.1200. The
Air Force activity producing the chemical will include hazard determination procedures in their written
program, and ensure their personnel are trained on the hazards. If the chemical is transferred to any other
organizations, the producing organization will provide a MSDS with the shipment and transmit the MSDS
to AFIOH.

2.5. Material Safety Data Sheets. Each MSDS is a detailed information bulletin prepared by the chem-
ical manufacturer describing the physical and chemical properties, physical and health hazards, routes of
exposure, precautions for safe handling and use, emergency and first-aid procedures, and control mea-
sures of the listed hazardous chemicals. The MSDS shall be prepared to be consistent with 29 CFR
1910.1200(g) requirements. OCONUS locations will maintain documents consistent with 29 CFR
1910.1200(g). If a document consistent with 29 CFR 1910.1200(g) cannot be obtained from the OCO-
NUS supplier, a document meeting the intent of 29 CFR 1910.1200(g) is acceptable.
   2.5.1. An MSDS must be immediately accessible (in either paper or electronic format) for every item
   on the work area/shop-specific hazardous chemical inventory. The MSDS on file must match the
   manufacturer and part number/trade name of the material on-hand. In addition, the MSDS preparation
   date must be consistent with the date/lot of any material on-hand. If a new MSDS is received, but the
   old material is still on-hand, the MSDS, which matched the old material, must be retained.
   2.5.2. MSDSs may be obtained from several sources. These include, but are not limited to, the chem-
   ical manufacturer or supplier, installation or unit HAZMART, DoD HMIRS on-line or CD-ROM, or
   through the ESOH-MIS. If the MSDS is not available from these sources, the BE Flight may be con-
   tacted for further assistance.
   2.5.3. Access to MSDSs in the work area/shops will be provided as follows:
14                                                  AFI90-821_ANDREWSAFBSUP_I 18 JUNE 2008


        2.5.3.1. All workers on all shifts must know how to obtain an MSDS, and have unrestricted direct
        access to MSDSs for their work area/shop during all shifts.
        2.5.3.2. MSDSs may be maintained in the work area/shops in paper or electronic version. OSHA
        does not specifically prohibit any form of access as long as "no barriers to immediate employee
        access" are created.
        2.5.3.3. The location of MSDSs and/or means of access for any work area/shop will be deter-
        mined locally. The supervisor should consider how long it would take for a worker to obtain an
        MSDS if it were needed to respond to a spill or if a worker was accidentally splashed with a haz-
        ardous chemical.
        2.5.3.4. If the primary means for MSDS access is electronic, a back-up system for MSDS access
        must be established in case primary computer access is disrupted. The back-up system may
        include, but is not limited to, paper copies, local computer files or CDs at another non-impacted
        location, telephone, fax, or access through a nearby HAZMART or BE Flight. Local judgment
        must be used to determine an adequate back-up system on a case-by-case basis.
        2.5.3.5. BE or other qualified personnel will provide explanations or interpretations of the MSDS
        to supervisors and affected workers, as requested, for routine training and planning, and will be
        available during emergency situations to assist in interpretation of MSDSs.
        2.5.3.6. Where personnel must travel between work area/shops during a work shift (e.g., their
        work is carried out at more than one geographical location such as flight line operations), the
        MSDS may be kept at the primary work area/shop facility. In this situation, the supervisor shall
        ensure that personnel can immediately obtain the required information in an emergency.
     2.5.4. Ensure any proprietary formulary and/or trade secret information in an MSDS is protected and
     used only as a management tool for exposure and incident prevention or health hazard education. Dur-
     ing the acquisition process, the Bioenvironmental Engineer (BEE) will discuss trade-secret limitations
     with the work area/shop supervisor; however, supervisors using materials with trade-secret informa-
     tion are encouraged to be familiar with requirements and restrictions listed in 29 CFR 1910.1200(i).
     When requesting proprietary information, the BEE may be asked to sign a non-disclosure agreement
     regarding a manufacturer’s proprietary information; consult with Legal Services in non-disclosure cri-
     teria are not clear.
     2.5.5. (Added-ANDREWS) Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs). A MSDS must be manufacturer
     specific, whether or not the item has the same stock number. If possible, obtain the MSDS that
     matches the type/size of container purchased. Supervisors who are requisitioning hazardous materials
     through local purchase/impact card channels will obtain an MSDS for the material from the vendor or
     the manufacturer prior to ordering the hazardous material. The HAZMART and/or BEF will assist
     workplace supervisors in obtaining copies of the MSDSs for all hazardous chemicals used in their
     workplace. If the chemical’s MSDS or equivalent information is not available, the supervisor will
     attempt to obtain the MSDS from the manufacturer or on-line. If the chemical’s MSDS, or equivalent
     information, cannot be obtained, the chemical cannot be used. The Defense Logistic Agency (DLA)
     provides an online service called the Hazardous Materials Information Resource System (HMIRS)
     which is a Department of Defense automated system. HMIRS is the central repository for Material
     Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) for the United States Government military services and civil agencies.
     Shop supervisors who want access to this service should contact BEF.

2.6. Labels and Other Forms of Warning.
   2.6.1. Labeling of hazardous chemical containers will be done according to 29 CFR 1910.1200(f),
   and DoDI 6050.5-H, DoD Hazardous Chemical Warning Labeling System.
   2.6.2. It is the responsibility of chemical manufacturers, importers and commercial distributors to
   label containers of hazardous chemicals according to the OSHA’s Federal HAZCOM standard.
   Accordingly, chemical containers entering the installation through the supply system or through local
   purchase should already be labeled. Supply receiving and HAZMARTs will ensure incoming contain-
   ers are properly labeled. Supply receiving and HAZMARTS will submit an item discrepancy report to
   identify any containers received without proper labeling from the manufacturer.
   2.6.3. Materials exempted from HAZCOM labeling requirements are described as follows [See 29
   CFR 1910.1200(b)(5) if additional details are desired]:
      2.6.3.1. Any pesticide as such term is defined in the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenti-
      cide Act (FIFRA) when subject to the labeling requirements of that Act.
      2.6.3.2. Any chemical substance or mixture as such terms are defined in the Toxic Substances
      Control Act (TSCA) when subject to the labeling requirements of that Act.
      2.6.3.3. Any food, food additive, color additive, drug, cosmetic, or medical or veterinary device
      or product, including materials intended for use as ingredients in such products (e.g., flavors and
      fragrances), as such terms are defined in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
      2.6.3.4. Any distilled spirits (beverage alcohols), wine, or malt beverage intended for non-indus-
      trial use, as such terms are defined in the Federal Alcohol Administration Act, and regulations
      issued under that Act, when subject to the labeling requirements of that Act and labeling regula-
      tions issued under that Act by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.
      2.6.3.5. Any consumer product or hazardous substance as those terms are defined in the Con-
      sumer Product Safety Act and Federal Hazardous Substances Act respectively, when subject to a
      consumer product safety standard or labeling requirement of those Acts, or regulations issued
      under those Acts by the Consumer Product Safety Commission.
      2.6.3.6. Agricultural or vegetable seed treated with pesticides and labeled in accordance with the
      Federal Seed Act and labeling regulations issued under that Act by the Department of Agriculture.
   2.6.4. Supervisors will ensure labels on containers of hazardous chemicals used in their work area/
   shop meet HAZCOM requirements, remain affixed to their containers, and are not obliterated or cov-
   ered. At minimum, the following information will appear on container labels [refer to 29 CFR
   1910.1200(f)(6) for alternate means]:
      2.6.4.1. The identity of the hazardous chemical(s) in the container.
      2.6.4.2. Appropriate hazard warnings that include information about the specific physical and
      health hazard(s), including target organ effects of the chemical(s) in the container. This may be
      accomplished using any combination of words, symbols, or pictures.
   2.6.5. Installation HAZMARTs may affix other labels to containers for locally determined purposes.
   If the HAZMART label duplicates the Federal HAZCOM standard requirements, the original label
   may be covered. If the HAZMART label does not duplicate the information required by the Federal
   HAZCOM standard, information on the original label must remain legible.
16                                                   AFI90-821_ANDREWSAFBSUP_I 18 JUNE 2008


     2.6.6. Transfer of chemicals between containers.
        2.6.6.1. If an employee transfers a chemical from a labeled container (for example, a 55-gallon
        drum) into a portable container for the immediate use of the same employee who made the trans-
        fer, then the portable container does not need to be labeled according to HAZCOM requirements.
        Immediate use means that the hazardous chemical will be under the control of and used only by
        the person who transfers it from a labeled container and only within the work shift in which it is
        transferred. If the employee cannot maintain full control over the chemical or departs the work
        area/shop, and if there is residual material left in the portable container, this material shall either
        be disposed of under applicable local disposal regulations, returned to its original container, or
        labeled in accordance with applicable regulations.
        2.6.6.2. If a chemical is transferred from a labeled container into a portable container at a central
        distribution point, such as the installation or unit HAZMART, for use by other employees, then the
        portable container must be labeled by the HAZMART in accordance with HAZCOM require-
        ments.

2.7. Employee Information and Training. The work area/shop supervisor is responsible for ensuring
all workers are properly trained on the chemical hazards in their work area/shop.
     2.7.1. Purpose. Supervisors and employees who handle, use, or are potentially exposed to hazardous
     materials in the course of official Air Force duties must be provided training on the AF HAZCOM
     program, including training to address work area/shop-specific hazards prior to the use of hazardous
     chemicals. Supervisors will ensure the appropriate functionals (i.e., PH, BE, base safety office, and
     fire department) review and approve the shop specific hazard training program for technical accuracy
     and completeness prior to implementation in the work area/shop. Contract supervisors and contractors
     shall be trained according to their specific contract provisions.
     2.7.2. Hazard Communication Training. Workers will be provided HAZCOM training prior to work-
     ing with a material that could potentially create a health hazard, and when work area/shop conditions
     or hazardous materials change.
        2.7.2.1. Initial Training. Workers will receive comprehensive HAZCOM training from their
        supervisors at the time of their initial assignment in a work area/shop. This training, at a mini-
        mum, will include the following:
            2.7.2.1.1. Identification of operations or processes in the work area/shop where hazardous
            chemicals are present or used, and the complete list of hazardous material used in association
            with work area/shop processes.
            2.7.2.1.2. Identification of relevant hazard categories associated with each chemical used
            (e.g., flammability, carcinogenicity, etc.) or the individual chemical hazards; including, but not
            limited to, those with specific regulatory requirements (e.g., asbestos, benzene, beryllium,
            cadmium, formaldehyde, and lead).
            2.7.2.1.3. The location and contents of the work area/shop-specific written hazard communi-
            cation program.
            2.7.2.1.4. Proper labeling of hazardous materials.
            2.7.2.1.5. How to access and read MSDSs.
AFI90-821_ANDREWSAFBSUP_I 18 JUNE 2008                                                                  17


         2.7.2.1.6. Controls (engineering controls, administrative controls, and personal protective
         equipment) workers must use to minimize or eliminate exposure to hazardous chemicals spe-
         cific to a task (e.g., the specific respirator for a specific spray painting process). Supervisors
         shall refer to the installation BE work area/shop survey reports for specific control require-
         ments.
         2.7.2.1.7. Emergency procedures, such as recognition of a spill or accidental chemical release
         (e.g., visual, odor, alarm) and escape procedures to include the locations of emergency eye
         wash stations, showers, and monitoring capabilities.
         2.7.2.1.8. Chemical hazards associated with non-routine tasks (e.g., solvent tank change-out
         every three months).
     2.7.2.2. Supplemental Training. Training for all potentially affected employees is required when
     either a new hazard is brought into the work area/shop or a new chemical is introduced. The train-
     ing shall include all elements described in Para. 2.7.2. Supervisors may use the AF Form 3952 or
     BE special survey letters as sources of information to meet this training requirement. When work-
     ers change work area/shops either by assigned duties or location, work area/shop-specific training
     as described in Para. 2.7.2.1. will be re-accomplished only to the extent needed to cover changes
     in working conditions and potential exposures.
     2.7.2.3. (Added-ANDREWS) Employee Information and Training. Public Health Flight (79
     AMDS/SGPM) is the OPR for health education.
     2.7.2.4. (Added-ANDREWS) Work area/shop supervisors and their work area/shop HAZCOM
     program designee will obtain HAZCOM program training materials and assure all elements of
     HAZCOM training are conducted IAW paragraph 2.7.2.1. through 2.7.2.2. of AFI 90-821. Super-
     visors shall contact Public Health (79 AMDS/SGPM) for assistance.
  2.7.3. Activities Not Co-located. Air Force employees assigned to non-co-located activities, such as
  GOCO facilities, will be trained as GSUs (see Para. 2.7.) or they may participate in that GOCO’s or
  other Services’ hazard communication training program, as long as the training meets the require-
  ments of the Federal HAZCOM standard.
  2.7.4. Documentation of Hazard Communication Training. While the Federal HAZCOM standard
  does not require documentation of worker training, the Air Force, in accordance with AFI 91-301, as
  a good management practice, requires work area/shop supervisors to document both worker initial and
  supplemental hazard communication training on AF Form 55 or in CAMS or in ESOH-MIS. This
  record should also include external HAZCOM training provided to AF supervisors and employees
  from contractor organizations where applicable.
  2.7.5. Determining the Effectiveness of Hazard Communication Training. HAZCOM is a perfor-
  mance-based standard. Therefore, the effectiveness of worker training will be measured by assessing
  worker knowledge of basic hazard communication concepts to include, but not be limited to:
     2.7.5.1. What processes and chemicals present hazards in their work area/shop and the nature of
     the hazard.
     2.7.5.2. How to access MSDSs for any chemical they use.
     2.7.5.3. How to find information on an MSDS.
18                                                  AFI90-821_ANDREWSAFBSUP_I 18 JUNE 2008


        2.7.5.4. How to interpret the hazard symbols or wording on hazard labels and what precautions
        (e.g., engineering controls, personal protective equipment, etc.) they must use when working with
        hazardous chemicals.

2.8. Hazardous Chemical Inventory.
     2.8.1. The written work area/shop hazard communication program must include a list of the hazard-
     ous chemicals known to be present in a work area/shop (the list may be compiled for the work area/
     shop as a whole or for specified and readily distinguishable portions of a work area/shop). The iden-
     tity that is used on the MSDS must be cross-referenced to the inventory. Where accessible, the inven-
     tory may be maintained in the ESOH-MIS.
     2.8.2. The inventory is a fundamental building block for a HAZCOM program and the nature of the
     chemicals on the inventory in a work area/shop will determine the scope of the hazard communication
     program and training requirements appropriate for that work area/shop. NOTE: IAW AFI 32-7086,
     the IHMP, through the AF Form 3952 authorization process, controls which hazardous chemicals can
     be used in each work area/shop on an installation.

2.9. Non-Routine Tasks Involving Hazardous Materials.
     2.9.1. Non-routine tasks are:
        2.9.1.1. Those tasks included within a work area/shop’s normal activities but performed infre-
        quently, for example, cleaning a solvent tank and changing the solvent.
        2.9.1.2. Temporary duties outside an individual’s normal Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) or job
        series.
        2.9.1.3. (Added-ANDREWS) Non-routine Tasks Involving Hazardous Materials. In addition to
        the definition of non-routine tasks outlined in AFI 90-821, workplace supervisors should consider
        a task non-routine if it is performed less than once every 3 months. If the workplace does not
        accomplish any non-routine tasks, supervisors shall use the format provided in Attachment 2 with
        the statement: Non-routine tasks are not accomplished in this workplace.
     2.9.2. Supervisors will ensure work area/shop operating instructions (OI), specific task lists, and Job
     Safety Analyses (JSAs) thoroughly describe non-routine tasks, associated hazards, and controls, for
     the infrequent tasks covered under Para. 2.9.1. OIs do not need to be prepared if technical orders (TO)
     or other official documents adequately describe these tasks and associated hazards and controls.
     Supervisors will ensure workers review these procedures before performing the non-routine tasks.
        2.9.2.1. (Added-ANDREWS) The work area supervisor will list all non-routine tasks performed
        in respective work areas, which involve hazardous materials IAW Attachment 2.
     2.9.3. When workers temporarily perform duties outside their normal jobs, the supervisor of the gain-
     ing activity will ensure these workers receive the following training prior to beginning the activity:
        2.9.3.1. The initial HAZCOM training described in Para. 2.7.2.1. for workers not previously
        trained.
        2.9.3.2. Work area/shop-specific training, as necessary, on work area/shop-specific chemical haz-
        ards and associated controls.

2.10. Contractors in AF Work Area/Shop(s). When an Air Force work area/shop uses hazardous
chemicals in a way that contractor employees (e.g., a painting contractor working in an industrial shop)
may be exposed, then the work area/shop written hazard communication program and access to MSDSs
must be provided to the contractors in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.1200(e)(2). The contractor is
responsible to determine the adequacy of the HAZCOM information for assessments of contractor
employees, and is responsible for their own HAZCOM program.

Chemical Manufacturer—An employer with a work area where chemical(s) are produced for use or
distribution.
Container—Any bag, barrel, bottle, box, can, cylinder, drum, reaction vessel, storage tank, or the like
that contains a hazardous chemical. For purposes of this standard, pipes or piping systems and engines,
fuel tanks, or other operating systems in a vehicle are not considered to be containers.
ESOH-MIS—An AF approved automated system to store and maintain all information associated with
environment, safety, and occupational health surveillance data and work area/shop requirements.
Employee—A worker who may be exposed to hazardous chemicals under normal operating conditions or
in foreseeable emergencies. Office workers who encounter hazardous chemicals only in non-routine,
isolated instances are not covered.

appropriate form of warning which convey the specific physical and health hazard(s), including target
organ effects, of the chemical(s) in the container(s).
HAZMART—As the customer service desk for the IHMP, it is the only entity on an installation
authorized to issue government-owned HAZMAT. At a minimum, a HAZMART is a facility or location
where customers can receive support for obtaining HAZMAT, and where HAZMATs are managed and
tracked. A HAZMART is intended to be the primary location on an installation where LRS personnel
stock, store, issue, and distribute HAZMAT. Each installation must have at least one primary HAZMART
established by, and accountable to the LRS Commander. The HMMP team may designate additional
unit-controlled supply activities as HAZMARTs performing all the functions of the primary HAZMART.
The HAZMART responsibilities include the receipt and entry of data on Government-wide Purchase Card
purchases of HAZMAT, and the receipt and entry of data on contractor usage of HAZMAT.
AFI90-821_ANDREWSAFBSUP_I 18 JUNE 2008                                                                   23


Hazardous Chemical (HAZMAT)—Any chemical that is a physical or health hazard and requires an
MSDS as defined in AFI 32-7086, Hazardous Materials Management, and all Class I and Class II
ozone-depleting substances (ODS). Also known as hazardous material or HAZMAT.
Hazardous Material Management Process—A standard methodology used to manage and track the
procurement and use of HAZMAT to support Air Force missions, protect the safety and health of
personnel on Air Force installations and communities surrounding Air Force installations from misuse of
HAZMAT, minimize Air Force use of HAZMAT consistent with mission needs, and to maintain Air Force
compliance with environmental requirements for HAZMAT usage. The HMMP is composed of three
interdependent programs: the Installation Hazardous Material (HAZMAT) Pharmacy Program (IHMP),
the Weapons System Hazardous Material (HAZMAT) Program (WSHP), and the ODS Program (ODSP).
Health Hazard—Includes materials which are carcinogens, toxic or highly toxic agents, reproductive
toxins, irritants, corrosives, sensitizers, hepatotoxins, nephrotoxins, neurotoxins, agents which act on the
hematopoietic system, and agents which damage the lungs, skin, eyes, or mucous membranes
Immediate Use Materials—Any hazardous chemical that will be under the control of and used only by
the person who transfers it from a labeled container and only within the work shift in which it is
transferred.
Installation—For purposes of the Federal HAZCOM standard and this AFI, an installation is a single
geographic location with one or more work area/shops. The AF does not constitute one installation and
must have programs that address hazards at each installation. Note: 29 CFR 1910.1200 uses the term
workplace instead of installation.
Label—Any written, printed, or graphic material, displayed on or affixed to containers of hazardous
chemicals.
Laboratory—A facility where relatively small quantities of hazardous materials are used on a
non-production basis. Use of hazardous materials must meet all of the following conditions: i) chemical
manipulations are carried out on a laboratory scale with all work with substances in containers designed
to be easily and safely manipulated by one person; ii) Multiple chemical procedures or chemicals are
used; iii) Procedures involved are not part of a production process, nor in any way simulate a production
process; iv) Protective laboratory practices and equipment are available.
Laboratory Standard—OSHA, 29 CFR 1910.1450, “Occupational Exposure to Hazardous Chemicals
in Laboratories.” See AFOSH Standard 48-22, Occupational Exposure to Hazardous Chemicals in
Laboratories.
Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS)—Written or printed material concerning a hazardous chemical that
is prepared according to 29 CFR 1910.1200.
Ozone Depleting Substance (ODS)—Substances that are primarily Class I or Class II ODS as defined
by the “Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer.”
Physical Hazard—Includes materials for which there is scientifically valid evidence it is a combustible
liquid, a compressed gas, explosive, flammable, an organic peroxide, an oxidizer, pyrophoric, unstable
(reactive) or water-reactive.

         MATERIAL SAFETY DATA SHEET (MSDS)
1.   Does the workplace have paper copies or electronic access to MSDSs for
     all hazardous materials used in the workplace? (AFI 90-821, paragraph
     2.5.1.)
2.   Does the MSDS on file match the manufacturer, part number, and
     trade name of material on hand? Is the MSDS preparation date consistent
     with the date and lot of material on hand? (AFI 90-821, paragraph 2.5.1.)
3.   Do all workers on all shifts have unrestricted direct access to MSDS for
     their work area/shop during all shifts? (AFI 90-821, para 2.5.3.1.)
4.   If primary MSDS access is electronic, does work area/shop have a
     back-up system for MSDS access? (AFI 90-821, para 2.5.3.4./Andrews
     AFB Supplement (AAFBS) 90-821, para 2.3.7. (Added))

   in CAMS or equivalent approved system? (AAFBS 90-821,
   paragraphs 2.3.7.5. (Added), 2.7.2.3. (Added) and 2.7.2.4. (Added))
2. Is HAZCOM training effective? (AFI 90-821, paragraph 2.7.5.)
   To determine this, recommend randomly selecting 10% of shop
   workers (up to 10 total) and having them demonstrate knowledge
   of the following:
   C What processes/chemicals present hazards in the work area/shop?
   C How do you access MSDS’s for any chemical that you use?
   C How do you find hazard information on an MSDS?
   C What do the hazard symbols or wording on hazard labels mean?
     C     What precautions (engineering controls, PPE, etc) must be used when
          working with shop specific hazardous chemicals?
3. Do workplace supervisors ensure temporary workers in the area
   have received the initial HAZCOM and supplemental training, as
   necessary, on work area specific chemical hazards and associated
   controls? (AFI 90-821, para 2.9.3.)
