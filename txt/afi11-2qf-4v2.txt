                                             Chapter 1

                                  GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. General. All evaluations will be conducted IAW the provisions of AFI 11-202V2, and this
volume.
1.2. Recommended Changes/Waivers. Waiver authority for this publication is the
MAJCOM/A3, IAW AFI 11-202 Vol 2. Waivers will be requested from the parent MAJCOM
Stan/Eval through appropriate channels. Waiver authority for supplemental guidance will be as
specified in the supplement and approved through the higher level coordination authority.
1.3. Procedures:
     1.3.1. Flight Examiners (FEs) will use the evaluation criteria contained in this volume for
     conducting all flight and Emergency Procedures Evaluations. To ensure standard and
     objective evaluations, flight examiners will be thoroughly familiar with the prescribed
     evaluation criteria.
     1.3.2. The FE will brief the examinee on the purpose of the evaluation and how it will be
     conducted prior to flight. The examinee will accomplish required flight planning in
     accordance with the flight position during the evaluation. Higher Headquarter (HHQ) FEs
     (and unit FEs as determined locally) will be furnished a copy of necessary mission data and
     mission materials.
     1.3.3. The FE will thoroughly debrief all aspects of the evaluation. This debrief will include
     the examinee's overall rating, specific deviations, area grades assigned (if other than
     qualified) and any required additional training.
     1.3.4. Required areas are shown in Table 2.1 When it is impossible to evaluate a required
     area in flight, it may be evaluated by an alternate method (i.e., in a cockpit procedure trainer
     (CPT) or by verbal examination) in order to complete the evaluation. The reason why
     required area(s) were not evaluated in-flight and the alternate method of evaluation used will
     be documented in the Comments portion of the AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew
     Qualification.
1.4. Grading Instructions. Standards and performance parameters are contained in AFI 11-
202V2 and this instruction.
     1.4.1. The FE will base tolerances for in-flight parameters on conditions of smooth air and a
     stable aircraft. Do not consider momentary deviations from tolerances, provided the
     examinee applies prompt corrective action and such deviations do not jeopardize flying
     safety. The FE will consider cumulative deviations when determining the overall grade.
     1.4.2. When grading criteria specify that airspeed and/or Angle of Attack (AOA) be
     evaluated and the flight manual lists only a minimum/maximum/recommended
     Airspeed/AOA for that area, the examinee will brief the desired airspeed/AOA.
     1.4.3. The FE will compare examinee performance for each area accomplished during the
     evaluation with the standards provided in this volume and assign an appropriate grade for the
AFI11-2QF-4V2 5 July 2011                                                                       5


   area. Derive the overall flight evaluation grade from the area grades based on a composite for
   the observed events and tasks IAW this volume.
       1.4.3.1. FEs will use the grading criteria in this volume to determine individual area
       grades. FE judgment must be exercised when the wording of areas is subjective and when
       specific situations are not covered.
       1.4.3.2. If the examinee receives an unqualified area grade in any of the critical areas
       identified by this volume, an overall qualification level of "Q-3" will be assigned.
       1.4.3.3. FE judgment will be the determining factor in arriving at the overall grade.
       1.4.3.4. The following general criteria apply during all phases of flight except as noted
       for specific events and instrument final approaches:

Table 1.1. General Criteria.
       Q        Altitude           +/- 200 feet
                Airspeed           +/- 5%
                Course             +/- 5 degrees/3 NM (whichever is greater)
                TACAN Arc          +/- 2 NM
                Fix-to-Fix         < 3 NM
       Q-       Altitude           +/- 300 feet
                Airspeed           +/- 10%
                Course             +/- 10 degrees/5 NM (whichever is greater)
                TACAN Arc          +/- 3 NM
                Fix-to-Fix         > 3 NM
       U                           Exceeded Q- limits
1.5. Emergency Procedures Evaluation (EPE). In order of preference, the EPE will be
conducted in a CPT, or verbally. Only conduct a verbal EPE if a CPT is not available or not
configured appropriately for the evaluation. Grading criteria for each required item are listed in
Chapter 3. This evaluation will include areas commensurate with examinee's Ready Aircrew
Program (RAP) training level and event qualifications.
   1.5.1. The following items will be included on all emergency procedures evaluations:
       1.5.1.1. Aircraft general knowledge.
       1.5.1.2. Emergency procedures. Evaluate a minimum of two emergency procedures per
       phase of flight (i.e., pre-takeoff, takeoff, cruise and landing). All Bold Face will be
       evaluated.
       1.5.1.3. Cockpit/Crew Resource Management (CRM).
       1.5.1.4. Unusual attitude recoveries. This also fulfills the Area 16 (Unusual Attitude
       Recoveries) requirement for Pilot Instrument/Qualification evaluations.
   1.5.2. The following additional items will be included on EPEs as a requisite for the
   instrument and/or qualification evaluation:
       1.5.2.1. AFMAN 11-217, Volume 1, Instrument Flight Procedures. Evaluate use of
       standby/emergency instruments.
6                                                                  AFI11-2QF-4V2 5 July 2011


       1.5.2.2. Alternate/Divert Airfields. Evaluate a minimum of one approach at other than
       home base.
    1.5.3. All Mission (MSN) EPEs will include the following items (tailor MSN evaluation
    scenarios to unit tasking/mission).
       1.5.3.1. Full Scale Aerial Target (FSAT) Automatic Flight Control System (AFCS)
       malfunction.1.5.3.2. Chase aircraft considerations during unmanned QF-4 EP
    1.5.4. Examinees receiving an overall unqualified grade will be placed in supervised status
    until recommended additional training is completed and/or a reevaluation is successfully
    accomplished.      Examinees receiving an overall unqualified grade because of an
    unsatisfactory Boldface accomplishment will not be permitted to fly until a successful
    reevaluation is accomplished. For EPEs in which the examinee is qualified, but requires
    additional training, the FE will indicate whether the additional training will be accomplished
    before the next flight. Additional training and reevaluations will be accomplished IAW AFI
    11-202V2.
    1.5.5. Normally, an EPE will be conducted separately for the pilot INSTM/QUAL and MSN
    evaluations. In situations where INSTM/QUAL and MSN evaluation eligibility zones
    coincide, a single EPE may be administered to fulfill the requisites for the combined
    MSN/INSTM/QUAL evaluations. The combined EPE must be of sufficient scope and length
    to ensure all required areas for each evaluation are accomplished.
    1.5.6. The following grading criteria will be used to grade individual items on EPEs:
       1.5.6.1. Q. Performance is correct. Quickly recognizes and corrects errors.
       1.5.6.2. Q-. Performance is safe, but indicates limited proficiency. Makes errors of
       omission or commission.
       1.5.6.3. U. Performance is unsafe or indicates lack of knowledge or ability.
AFI11-2QF-4V2 5 July 2011                                                                        7

                             EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS

2.1. General:
   2.1.1. All evaluations will follow the guidelines set in AFI 11-202V2 and this instruction.
   2.1.2. Evaluation requirements are depicted in Table 2.1 Areas indicated with an "R" are
   required items for that evaluation. When it is impractical or not possible to accomplish a
   required flight evaluation area in-flight, it may be evaluated by an alternate method (i.e., CPT
   or verbal examination) in order to complete the evaluation. Document the reason and type of
   alternate method used in the Comments portion of the AF Form 8. If the FE determines the
   required item cannot be adequately evaluated by an alternate method, the examinee will
   require an additional flight to complete the evaluation.
   2.1.3. Currency of Flight Publications. Publications that will be checked during the
   evaluation are:
       2.1.3.1. (QF-4) T.O. 1F-4(Q) E-1CL-1
       2.1.3.2. Local In-flight Guide(s)
       2.1.3.3. Units may specify additional publications to be evaluated in the unit supplement
       to AFI 11-202V2.
   2.1.4. Cockpit/Crew Resource Management (CRM). In accordance with AFI 11-290,
   Cockpit/Crew Resource Management, CRM skills will be evaluated during all evaluations.
   CRM skills are integral to all phases of flight and are embedded within specific grading
   criteria. Therefore, no specific evaluation criteria area titled CRM exists. As all the CRM
   skills listed on the AF Form 4031, CRM Skills Training/ Evaluation Form, are
   included/embedded, use of the Form 4031 is unnecessary for evaluations in the QF-4. The
   Stan/Eval trend program can be used to measure the effectiveness of CRM training.
   2.1.5. Combined Evaluations. With the approval of the Operations Group Commander, the
   INSTM/QUAL and MSN evaluations may be combined as a single evaluation. Unit
   Commanders should recommend this option only for experienced pilots. Combined
   evaluations flown in this manner must fulfill all current INSTM/QUAL and MSN evaluation
   requirements, including ground phase requisites. One EPE may be accomplished that
   encompasses requirements of both EPEs.
2.2. Pilot Instrument/Qualification Evaluation. A mission flown according to instrument
flight rules (to the maximum extent practical) best fulfills the objective of the INSTM/QUAL
evaluation. To the maximum extent possible, INIT INSTM/QUAL evaluations will include
approaches at airfields other than home or deployed locations. Approaches may be flown to
fields which have a non-published, practice approach available (e.g. Visual Flight Rules (VFR)
conditions only approach), but not a published FLIP approach. This evaluation may be
administered on any compatible training mission with the approval of the unit commander. When
two-seat aircraft are available, pilots will normally complete their INSTM/QUAL evaluation
with an FE occupying the rear cockpit.
   2.2.1. Minimum ground phase requisites are:
 8                                                                  AFI11-2QF-4V2 5 July 2011


        2.2.1.1. Instrument examination.
        2.2.1.2. Closed and open book qualification examinations.
        2.2.1.3. EPE.
        2.2.1.4. Boldface Written Exam. Answers must contain all items in proper sequence.
        Abbreviations which do not affect the correct meaning of the procedure are acceptable.
2.3. Mission Evaluation. MSN evaluations profiles will be designed to evaluate the
training/flight position/special qualifications as well as basic airmanship of the examinee. Initial
mission evaluations will be given IAW appropriate syllabus mission. Mission evaluations will
normally be flown using unit formations and tactics. Examinees will be evaluated in the position
of their highest qualification. If briefed, at the FE’s discretion, portions may be flown in another
position, but the emphasis is to have examinees evaluated at their highest qualification level.
Based on the examinee's experience level, a wingman may be required to brief (to include
tactics) and/or lead certain phases of the mission, but will not be evaluated using flight lead
grading criteria. Evaluations during exercises or deployments are encouraged.
     2.3.1. QF-4 mission evaluations require remote control operations using the Drone
     Formation System (DFS), and will normally be flown on a Fixed Control Site (FCS) profile.
     If a FCS profile is unavailable, a Mobile Control System (MCS) profile may be flown.
     2.3.2. When two-seat aircraft are available, pilots will normally complete this evaluation
     with an FE occupying the rear cockpit. The evaluator may fly in a chase aircraft or be
     positioned in the MCS van with Operations Officer approval.
     2.3.3. Minimum ground phase requisites are:
        2.3.3.1. EPE.
        2.3.3.2. Boldface Written Exam. Answers must contain all items in proper sequence.
        Abbreviations which do not affect the correct meaning of the procedure are acceptable.
2.4. Formal Course Evaluation. Syllabus evaluations will be flown IAW syllabus mission
profile guidelines if stated, or on a mission profile developed from syllabus training objectives.
Formal course guidelines may be modified, based on local operating considerations or FE
judgment, to complete the evaluation. Training objectives and related areas will be graded using
performance criteria in this volume.
2.5. Instructor Evaluation. Instructor evaluations will be conducted IAW AFI 11-202V2.
Flight evaluations will include a thorough evaluation of the examinee’s instructor knowledge and
ability. This is a one-time check in which the examinee must demonstrate ability to instruct in
some phase of the unit’s mission. Except for requirements delineated in Table 2.1, specific
profiles and/or events will be determined by the flight examiner. Subsequent evaluations (for
example, Instrument/Qualification, Mission) will include instructor portions during the
evaluations.
2.6. Formal Training Unit (FTU) Mission Evaluations. FTU instructor mission evaluation
profiles will normally be IAW the formal course syllabus for any mission which the instructor is
qualified to instruct.
2.7. Instructor Pilot Rear Cockpit Evaluations. When IPs are required to perform rear
cockpit instructor duties, an evaluation of rear cockpit landings will be completed prior to
AFI11-2QF-4V2 5 July 2011                                                                           9


performing rear cockpit instructor duties. These duties include instruction for and demonstration
of landings during initial qualification training, requalification training, or additional training.
   2.7.1. Examinees will complete the evaluation as follows:
       2.7.1.1. All rear cockpit landing qualification evaluations will include satisfactory
       demonstration of: overhead and emergency patterns and a landing performed from the
       rear cockpit.
       2.7.1.2. IPs will accomplish the rear cockpit landing qualification during either the
       instrument/qualification evaluation sortie, the mission evaluation sortie or during another
       sortie as a requisite. Each unit will specify when the rear cockpit landing qualification
       will be completed and identify procedures for completion of this requirement in the unit
       supplement to AFI 11-202V2.
   2.7.2. When the rear cockpit landing qualification is evaluated during a separate sortie as a
   requisite for a flight evaluation, record "SPOT" in the Flight Phase block on the AF Form 8.
   Describe the purpose of the evaluation as "Rear Cockpit Landing Qualification" in the
   Mission Description section of the Comments block. In addition, FEs will document all
   discrepancies on the AF Form 8 in Section IV, paragraph b, under a subparagraph after the
   Emergency Procedures Evaluation (EPE) discrepancies as follows: "2. Rear Cockpit Landing
   Qualification." If no discrepancies are identified, enter "None" after the subparagraph title. A
   subparagraph 3 would then be used for flight discrepancies. If a reevaluation is required, an
   additional "SPOT" entry will be recorded in the Flight Phase block on the front of the AF
   Form 8. Additional training will be documented IAW AFI 11-202V2.
   2.7.3. An initial rear cockpit landing qualification may be conducted independently of
   another evaluation. FEs will document completion of this Rear Cockpit Landing
   Qualification as a "SPOT" evaluation on an AF Form 8. Evaluate Rear Cockpit (RCP)
   landing qualification on all subsequent INSTM/QUAL evaluations. It may be an additional
   sortie on the INSTM/QUAL evaluation, and documented as SPOT. If the entire
   INSTM/QUAL evaluation sortie is flown from the RCP and RCP landing requirements IAW
   AFI 11-2Mission Design Series (MDS)-Vol2 are met, annotate the AF Form 8 with an
   INSTM/QUAL flight only, and add rear cockpit landing qualification in the mission
   description on the back of the AF Form 8.

Notes:
1. Airwork/Advanced Handling/Tactical Maneuvering. This area is required for pilots receiving
Instrument/ Qualification evaluations. Units will determine appropriate proficiency maneuvers
for pilot experience levels. Examples are, but are not limited to:
        a. Aerobatics
        b. Confidence maneuvers
        c. Basic Fighter Maneuver (BFM)
        d. Advanced handling characteristics
        e. Formation (fingertip, tactical, trail)

2. Unusual Attitude Recoveries will be evaluated during EPEs, or if evaluated in-flight, will be
performed only with an FE occupying the rear cockpit.
3. Both a PAR and an ILS must be evaluated if equipment and facilities are available. However,
if facilities or equipment are not available, the flight evaluation may be completed as long as one
precision approach is flown.
