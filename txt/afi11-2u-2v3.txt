                                       INTRODUCTION

1.1. General:
     1.1.1. Abbreviations, acronyms and terms. See Attachment 1.
     1.1.2. In conjunction with other governing directives, this volume prescribes procedures for
     U-2 aircraft under most circumstances, but it is not a substitute for sound judgment. This
     volume provides guidelines for U-2 aircraft operations and applies to U-2 aircrews and all
     management levels concerned with operation of the U-2 aircraft. It is a compilation of
     information from aircraft flight manuals, flight information publications (FLIP), and Air
     Force directives, as well as an original source document for many areas. Basic source
     directives have precedence in the case of any conflicts, revisions, and matters of
     interpretation.
     1.1.3. Copies will be current and available to planning staffs from headquarters to aircrew
     level.
1.2. Deviations and Waivers:
     1.2.1. Deviations. Do not deviate from the policies and guidance in this volume under
     normal circumstances with the following exceptions:
        1.2.1.1. If an urgent requirement or aircraft emergency dictates otherwise, in which case
        the pilot in command, or instructor, will take the appropriate action to safely recover the
        aircraft.
        1.2.1.2. When a controlling source publication changes, that publication takes
        precedence until the change is incorporated herein. After a change is made to a
        controlling source, a change to this volume will be distributed in a timely manner.
     1.2.2. Waivers. Waiver authority is the parent MAJCOM/A3 unless otherwise directed in
     this volume. If appropriate, waiver approval and coordination should be published in the
     mission or theater concept of operations (CONOPS).
1.3. Revisions. Submit proposed changes to this volume through appropriate channels to HQ
ACC/A3MH according to AFI 11-215, USAF Flight Manuals Program (FMP). Use AF Form
847, Recommendation for Change of Publication. HQ AF/A3/5 is the approval authority for
interim changes (IC) and revisions to this instruction.
1.4. Key Words and Definitions.
     1.4.1. “Will” and “shall” indicate a mandatory requirement.
     1.4.2. "Should" is normally used to indicate a preferred, but not mandatory, method of
     accomplishment.
     1.4.3. "May" indicates an acceptable or suggested means of accomplishment.
     1.4.4. "Note" indicates operating procedures, techniques, etc., considered essential to
     emphasize.

                                    MISSION PLANNING

2.1. Flight Manuals. All U-2 pilots will be provided access to electronic flight manuals and are
personally responsible for maintaining knowledge of flight manual procedures.
2.2. Checklists. Each crewmember will have and refer to appropriate checklists during flight
operations to ensure accomplishing required actions.
2.3. Local Aircrew Aids. Locally developed aircrew aids, to include those which combine
steps from the 1U-2S-1CL-1 and 1U-2S-1CL-2, are authorized.
2.4. Mission Planning Responsibility. The mission pilot is ultimately responsible for proper
mission planning.
   2.4.1. Commanders will employ Operational Risk Management (ORM) principles to ensure
   that operations do not exceed established risk levels. ORM assessments will consider
   changes/disruptions in pilot circadian rhythm, fatigue assessment and fatigue
   countermeasures (i.e. nutritional support, pharmaceutical support, adaptation and
   conditioning).
   2.4.2. Commanders will ensure all mission planning materials are current and command
   guidance is followed. Squadron and Forward Operating Location (FOL) operations officers
   will ensure adequate mission planning time is scheduled prior to flight.
   2.4.3. For operational reconnaissance and Higher Headquarters (HHQ) directed sorties,
   responsibility for determining mission objectives, sensor selection, route of flight, country
   clearances, etc., is shared between operations and intelligence functions at the wing level or
   above. HHQ missions include deployment, redeployment, reconnaissance operations,
   Operational Readiness Inspections (ORI), and Programmed Depot Maintenance (PDM)
   input/output. Exercise missions flown in support of higher headquarters directed exercises,
   (e.g. RED FLAG) and exercise support to classified users are also considered HHQ missions.
2.5. Mission Planning Procedures. Mission planning must be sufficient to ensure safe and
successful mission accomplishment. Areas covered will include, at a minimum, fuel
requirements, chart preparation, mission objectives, threat study (when applicable), departure
and arrival procedures, and communication procedures.
   2.5.1. Map/Chart Preparation. All mission materials (other than FLIP) will be placed on
   boards to ease handling in the pressure suit. Annotate restricted/prohibited areas, route of
   flight, and emergency airfields along the route of flight. Known threats to the U-2 will be
   depicted.
   2.5.2. Pre-flight Briefings. Pilots are responsible for briefing the mobile officer prior to each
   flight. For all flights, the briefing will include:
       2.5.2.1. Emergency airspeeds for use immediately after takeoff and the assistance desired
       from the mobile officer.
       2.5.2.2. Visual Search Responsibilities:

                          NORMAL OPERATING PROCEDURES

3.1. Preflight:
   3.1.1. General. The pilot will review the aircraft forms, including weight and balance. The
   pilot is responsible for knowing the aircraft condition prior to acceptance for flight.
   3.1.2. Low Flights. The pilot will normally accomplish the aircraft preflight, to include the
   exterior inspection. The mobile officer may perform the exterior inspection if conditions
   warrant.
   3.1.3. High Flights. The mobile officer will normally perform the interior inspection to
   include checking inertial navigation system (INS) destination points/emergency
   airfields/bulls eyes. The mobile officer will also normally review the aircraft forms and
   perform the exterior inspection.
3.2. Ground Visual Signals:
   3.2.1. For engine start and ground operations prior to taxi, the pilot will normally be in
   contact with the crew chief via intercom. If the intercom is inoperative, the pilot may elect to
   use visual signals.
   3.2.2. Establish radio contact with the mobile officer prior to engine start (N/A for
   communication-out launches).
3.3. Taxi:
   3.3.1. Taxi only after receiving “ground crew clear” from the mobile officer via radio
   transmission or visual signal.
   3.3.2. If unable to make a turn, stop; then follow the mobile officer’s instructions for pushing
   the aircraft. Close coordination with the mobile officer is necessary to push an aircraft safely.
   Do not actuate control surfaces, run up the engine, or roll forward until cleared by the mobile
   officer.
   3.3.3. Do not taxi with a wing tip contacting the runway or taxiway when EWS wing tip
   receivers are installed.
3.4. Runway Line Up:
   3.4.1. Intersection Takeoffs. Avoid performing intersection takeoffs if the stopping distance
   is critical and using the entire runway is operationally feasible. On training sorties do not
   perform intersection takeoffs if the takeoff ground distance and abort stopping distance
   exceed the available runway remaining.
   3.4.2. Locations with Crowned Runways. Do not line up on runway centerline with fuel
   loads less than R-6 unless operationally necessary. The pogo(s) may fall out on crowned
   runways when the pins are removed.
   3.4.3. Takeoffs Without One or Both Pogos.
       3.4.3.1. For training missions, a hand launch is permissible at light fuel loads (R-3 or
       less). At least one pogo is required at fuel weights above R-3.
 10                                                           AFI11-2U-2V3 15 AUGUST 2013


       3.4.3.2. For operational and higher headquarters missions, hand launches are at the
       discretion of the squadron or FOL commander.
   3.4.4. Before Takeoff Checks. Do not run-up power until receiving takeoff clearance and
   getting a "thumbs up" or verbal "ground crew clear" from the mobile officer.
3.5. Climbout. On all takeoffs, including touch-and-go’s, do not initiate a turn until reaching a
minimum of 400 feet above ground level (AGL).
3.6. Descent. Do not descend at maximum airspeeds unless mission tactics or training
requirements dictate.
3.7. Stall Training:
   3.7.1. Accomplish stall training in visual meteorological conditions (VMC) below Flight
   Level (FL) 400 and at least 5000 feet above the ground or undercast deck. Ensure the stall
   strips are extended and fuel balance is checked. Recover immediately if any unusual stall
   characteristics develop.
   3.7.2. Stall training will only be accomplished on functional check flight (FCF) training
   sorties or with a TU-2S qualified instructor pilot (IP) on board.
   3.7.3. Intentional stalls from nose high attitudes and accelerated stalls are prohibited.
3.8. Visual Flight Rule (VFR) Patterns:
   3.8.1. Closed Patterns. Airspeed during the closed pattern will be no lower than 90 Knots
   Indicated Air Speed (KIAS) or no-flap T + 10, whichever is higher.
   3.8.2. Night VFR Patterns. Night VFR patterns and touch-and-go landings are authorized.
3.9. Low Approaches. Initiate low approach, missed approach, or go-around at 10 feet or
above unless performing the landing attitude demonstration in the TU-2S.
3.10. Mobile Officer Control of Landings:
   3.10.1. The mobile officer will chase all landings unless safety considerations preclude chase
   or when conducting mobile officer training from a static position.
   3.10.2. Static position mobile officer training should only be accomplished under the
   following conditions:
       3.10.2.1. Day
       3.10.2.2. Visibility of 2 statute miles or better
       3.10.2.3. Crosswinds <10 knots
       3.10.2.4. An IP in the aircraft being monitored
       3.10.2.5. The mobile officer must be in a position to clearly view the final approach,
       touchdown, and rollout/takeoff phases
   3.10.3. If the mobile officer will not be chasing the aircraft, has to discontinue chase, or
   loses sight of the aircraft, inform the pilot by transmitting "Call Sign, Mobile, Negative
   Chase." This call may include a short explanation, if warranted.
3.11. Touch-and-Go Landings:
AFI11-2U-2V3 15 AUGUST 2013                                                                   11


   3.11.1. All touch-and-go landings will be supervised by an IP (either in the mobile vehicle or
   in the aircraft).
   3.11.2. Minimum runway length for touch-and-go landings is 6,000 feet.
   3.11.3. The landing zone for all U-2 landings is the first third of the runway. Initiate the
   takeoff phase of touch-and-go landings with no less than one-third of the runway remaining.
   3.11.4. Do not perform touch-and-go landings with primary mission equipment (PME) on
   the aircraft. The EWS and line-of-sight data link are not considered PME for the purpose of
   touch-and-go landings. However, touch-and-go landings should be limited with EWS or data
   link equipment installed. If PME, EWS, or data link is loaded, aircraft will stop straight
   ahead on the runway and taxi clear once pogos are installed.
3.12. No-Voice Landings. All landings will be given altitude calls unless the pilot asks for a
no-voice landing. No-voice landings are not considered simulated emergency procedures and
may be flown on any pattern/ landing with the following restrictions:
   3.12.1. Will not be flown with greater than 10 knots of crosswind.
   3.12.2. Will not be flown when the runway is snow, slush, or ice covered.
   3.12.3. Will not be flown when an emergency exists, or a precautionary landing is being
   made.
   3.12.4. Will not be flown on operational/HHQ sorties.
3.13. Full Stop Landings. Computed landing distance will not exceed 80 percent of the
available runway.
3.14. Takeoff and Landing with Arresting Cables. U-2 aircraft may takeoff or land on a
runway with arresting gear provided it can be safely accomplished between the barriers.
3.15. Alert Launch Procedures. Alert launch procedures specified in the 1U-2S-1 and 1U-2S-
CL-1 are only to be used when real-world operations require an actual alert launch.
3.16. Interfly. Interfly is the exchange and/or substitution of aircrew members and/or aircraft
between MAJCOMs to accomplish flying missions. Normally, interfly should be limited to
specific operations/tests, exercises, or special circumstances, but may be used to relieve short-
term qualified manpower shortfalls. HQ ACC assigned crewmembers may fly with any
MAJCOM for the purpose of inspections, evaluations, and training management visits with
concurrence from the host MAJCOM.
   3.16.1. HQ ACC/A3TV maintains current memoranda of agreements (MOAs) for interfly
   using ACC-assigned aircraft.
       3.16.1.1. Aircraft ownership will not be transferred.
       3.16.1.2. The operational squadron will prepare and sign flight orders.
       3.16.1.3. As a minimum, crews will be qualified in the aircraft, as well as systems or
       configuration required to fly the aircraft and/or mission.
       3.16.1.4. Crewmember(s) will follow operational procedures defined in this AFI, Air
       Force Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (AFTTP) 3-1.U-2, Tactical Employment--U-2
       and the applicable technical orders for the Mission Design Series (MDS).

     3.16.1.5. Comply with AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports, paragraphs 4.1
     and 4.2 for investigation responsibilities.
  3.16.2. Approval Authority.
     3.16.2.1. With a valid MOA, the group commander or commander of Air Force forces
     (COMAFFOR) is the approval authority for interfly on ACC aircraft under his/her
     control.
     3.16.2.2. Without a valid/current MOA, HQ ACC/A3TV is the approval authority for
     interfly on ACC aircraft.
     3.16.2.3. Interfly during contingency operations must be approved by both HQ ACC/A3
     and respective MAJCOM/A3.
AFI11-2U-2V3 15 AUGUST 2013                                                                     13

                        SIMULATED EMERGENCY PROCEDURES

4.1. General. Simulated emergencies will only be practiced by IPs or under the supervision of
an IP in the aircraft or mobile vehicle. Practice simulated emergencies under day VMC
(including civil twilight) only (exception: TU-2S sorties with a current and qualified TU-2S IP
on board may practice simulated emergencies under day IMC with weather conditions at or
above published circling minima for the approach to be flown.)
4.2. Simulated Flameout (SFO) Patterns:
   4.2.1. Do not practice SFOs from the initial takeoff leg of the pattern.
   4.2.2. Enter all SFOs from a stabilized pitch attitude and power setting.
   4.2.3. SFO patterns will be flown from a high or low key point as described in the flight
   manual, but may begin from other positions at altitudes above those points.
4.3. No-Flap Patterns. Practice no-flap landings without the use of trim (simulating hydraulic
pressure loss) are authorized provided the trim setting used is within the normal flight range (one
unit nose down to two units nose up).
4.4. Simulated Emergency Pattern Full Stop Landings. If a full stop landing from a
simulated emergency pattern is necessary due to training or other requirements, the parameters
for a normal full stop landing must be followed (touch-and-go restrictions apply).

                              EMERGENCY PROCEDURES

5.1. General. This chapter contains procedures to be followed when emergencies or abnormal
conditions occur. They do not supersede or replace flight manual procedures or sound judgment.
5.2. Takeoff Aborts. If hot brakes are experienced or suspected, declare an emergency and do
not taxi.
5.3. Hung Pogo Procedures. In the event of a hung pogo, the pilot should declare an
emergency, avoid flying over populated areas and avoid making abrupt pitch and power changes.
Descend no lower than 1000 feet AGL during attempts to dislodge the pogo. If unable to
dislodge the pogo:
   5.3.1. With aircraft T-Speed greater than 78.6 KIAS (aircraft greater than 24,300 lb),
   proceed to the local hung pogo fuel dump area (conditions permitting) and adjust aircraft
   gross weight as required for landing.
   5.3.2. With aircraft T-Speed less than 78.6 KIAS (aircraft less than 24,300 lb), perform a
   hung pogo landing. After landing, stop straight ahead. If the pogo drops during landing,
   terminate the emergency, and have the aircraft inspected for damage. If no damage is
   evident, it is permissible to re-launch using the opposite side pogo or hand launch
   procedures. If the pogo does not drop, terminate the mission.
5.4. Fuel Restrictions:
   5.4.1. Declare minimum fuel whenever usable fuel at touchdown will be less than 125
   gallons.
   5.4.2. Declare emergency fuel whenever usable fuel at touchdown will be less than 50
   gallons.
   5.4.3. After landing shut down the engine whenever sump quantity indications become
   unreliable (usually less than 25 gallons) regardless of fuel depicted on the counter. Do not
   allow the engine to flame out.
AFI11-2U-2V3 15 AUGUST 2013                                                                      15

                                 WEATHER RESTRICTIONS

6.1. Ceiling and Visibility. Fully qualified pilots will comply with AFI 11-202V3 (as
supplemented) ceiling and visibility criteria for filing, takeoff, and landing. For student training
and interview sorties, comply with syllabus guidance and restrictions.
6.2. Maximum Steady State Surface Wind (Forecasted or Reported). 30 knots for training
sorties, due to parachute canopy size and the hazards associated with being dragged. Maximum
steady-state surface wind (forecasted or reported) for operational or HHQ directed sorties is 40
knots.
6.3. Crosswinds:
   6.3.1. Maximum recommended crosswind component for dry or wet runway operations is 15
   knots.
   6.3.2. Maximum crosswind component for touch-and-go landings is 12 knots. Exception:
   On runways less than 300 feet wide, maximum crosswind component for touch–and-go
   landings is 10 knots.
   6.3.3. Maximum crosswind component is 9 knots for operations with loose snow on the
   runway, and 5 knots for ice on the runway (Runway Condition Reading (RCR) 5).
6.4. Tailwinds:
   6.4.1. Maximum tailwind component for takeoffs and full stop landings is 10 knots.
   6.4.2. Maximum tailwind component for touch-and-go landings is 5 knots.
6.5. Turbulence. U-2 sorties will not fly into areas of forecast or reported severe turbulence,
nor will they remain in areas where actual moderate or higher turbulence is encountered.
6.6. Ice and Snow. Do not perform touch-and-go landings on snow or ice covered runways.
6.7. Space Weather.
   6.7.1. The 9 OG/CC is the designated OPR for solar event information impacting worldwide
   U-2 flying operations. The Beale AFB weather flight (WF) is the 24-hour focal point for
   integration of solar event intelligence into flying operations and providing alerts regarding
   solar events issued by the Space Weather Operations Flight (2WS/WXZ).
   6.7.2. High altitude flight exposes pilots to increased levels of solar radiation, and may
   potentially expose pilots to significant levels of radiation emanating from coronal mass
   ejections. Exposure levels are dependent upon three primary factors:
       6.7.2.1. Altitude. Exposure levels increase with altitude, given the shielding effect
       provided by the atmosphere is reduced accordingly.
       6.7.2.2. Latitude. Exposure levels increase with latitude, as the atmosphere is thickest in
       the equatorial region and thinnest near the poles (see Figure 6.1.).
       6.7.2.3. Duration. Exposure levels increase time spent aloft.
 16                                                        AFI11-2U-2V3 15 AUGUST 2013


Figure 6.1. Global Map of Geomagnetic Latitude.




   6.7.3. Space Weather Monitoring and Information.
      6.7.3.1. Capabilities. The Space Weather Operations Flight (2 WS/WXZ) is co-located
      with HQ Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA) at Offutt AFB, NE (DSN 312-272-8087),
      and provides around-the-clock, real-time monitoring of geostationary operational
      environmental satellite (GOES) data measuring the flux of X-rays and protons generated
      from major solar flares and other cosmic sources. 2 WS/WXZ utilizes a statistical
      algorithm combining real-time GOES observations and empirical data to generate
      estimates of the resultant maximum radiation dosage present in the high altitude
      environment.
      6.7.3.2. Limitations.
          6.7.3.2.1. Multiple other variables affect the actual amount of particle energy that
          reaches the earth’s lower atmosphere and impact radiation dosage, but many are not
          measured operationally for analysis. Examples include the influence of solar winds,
          interplanetary magnetic fields, and the earth’s magnetosphere, as well as the actual
          properties of each coronal mass ejection. As such, 2 WS/WXZ estimates may only
          provide a rough order of magnitude of the actual radiation dosage experienced in high
          altitude flight.
          6.7.3.2.2. Given the speed of solar particles, the ability to provide lead times for
          significant space events which will impact high altitude flight can be extremely
          limited. While some events may provide several hours of advance notice, the lead
          time for other events may only be a matter of minutes.
AFI11-2U-2V3 15 AUGUST 2013                                                            17


   6.7.4. Support to High Altitude Operations.
      6.7.4.1. Data Sources. Space weather analysis and forecast products are produced
      primarily at the Space Weather Operations Center in conjunction with the National
      Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Space Weather Prediction Center.
      These products are available through normal unclassified weather information
      dissemination systems.
      6.7.4.2. Meteorological Watch (METWATCH)/Notification. When a high altitude
      radiation event occurs:
          6.7.4.2.1. 2 WS/WXZ provides automated telephone and e-mail notification to the
          Beale AFB WF with estimated maximum radiation dosage information for high
          altitude flights. During periods of limited METWATCH (e.g. Beale AFB airfield
          closure), 2 WS/WXZ directly notifies the WF commander, WF NCOIC, and weather
          watch officer via telephone and e-mail.
          6.7.4.2.2. The Beale AFB WF posts radiation impacts to the Beale AFB mission
          weather product (MWP) and provides notification to the 9 OG/CC, 9 MDG/SGP and
          other select base agencies.
   6.7.5. Procedures.
      6.7.5.1. 9 OSS/OSW will advise the 9 OG/CC whenever 2 WS/WXZ determines a solar
      proton event begins or ends, and whenever the estimated maximum radiation dosage for
      high altitude flights will reach or cross 3, 10 and 30 millirems per hour (mRem/hr).
      6.7.5.2. 9 OG/CC will determine impacts to high altitude operations utilizing the
      guidance from Table 6.1, provide immediate notification to squadron or FOL
      commanders at all affected locations, and provide a recommendation regarding the
      impact to high altitude flying operations.
      6.7.5.3. FOL commanders will work through the designated tasking agency exercising
      operational control (OPCON) or tactical control (TACON) to determine whether tasked
      U-2 missions will continue or terminate.

7.1. General. This chapter discusses the special physiological stresses experienced by pilots
flying solo, long duration missions in the full pressure suit and outlines crew rest and duty day
limitations to reduce physiological stress, mitigate risk and increase safety.
7.2. High Altitude Flights:
   7.2.1. Prebreathing. A minimum of 60 minutes prebreathing of 100% oxygen is required for
   U-2 high altitude flights prior to traffic pattern departure.
   7.2.2. Flights During Normal Duty Hours. Pilots will not be scheduled any additional
   activities for the remainder of the duty period.
   7.2.3. Landing After 1930 Local Time. Both the pilot and mobile officer are excused from
   duty for 13 hours after the actual landing time, or 12 hours after completion of post flight
   duties, whichever is later.
   7.2.4. Mobile Officers. Mobile officers will have a 12-hour duty day. Any crew duty day
   extension for the pilot applies to the mobile officer and Supervisor of Flying (SOF).
   7.2.5. Recovery Period. Adhere to the recovery times (turn times) in Table 7.1. High
   altitude flight exerts extreme physiological stress on the human body; a flight recovery
   period is mandated to mitigate the risks of decompression sickness (DCS) and manage
   fatigue which is induced from repeated, long-duration exposure to the high altitude
   environment. For waivers to flight recovery periods, consider the pilot's recent duty history,
   the importance of the mission, and AFI 11-202V3, Chapter 9 restrictions. These limits should
   not normally be waived for training sorties.

Table 7.1. High Altitude Flight Recovery Period.

HIGH FLIGHT DURATION                  TO HIGH FLT                TO LOW FLT

< 2.5 hrs                             13 hrs                     13 hrs

2.5 hrs to < 6.5 hrs                  36 hrs                     18 hrs

9.0 hrs or longer                     72 hrs (Note 2)            48 hrs

NOTES
1. Times are landing to takeoff, except for high flights < 2.5 hours, for which the
13-hour recovery period is from landing to start of official duties.
2. For high flights of 9.0 hours or longer, the 72-hour flight recovery period may
be waived to not less than 48 hours by the wing/CC (waiver authority may be
 20                                                           AFI11-2U-2V3 15 AUGUST 2013


delegated, but no lower than the squadron or FOL commander).


   7.2.6. Aborted flights of less than 2.5 hours duration may be re-launched with the same pilot.
   Carefully consider the circumstances of the original abort, the mission to be accomplished,
   and the condition of the pilot. If a backup pilot is used instead, the original pilot may perform
   mobile officer duties.
   7.2.7. Flights of 9.0 Hours or Longer.
       7.2.7.1. The first 24-hr period following landing will be compensatory time off (CTO).
       At deployed locations, supervisors may perform SOF duties at their discretion, and with
       squadron or FOL commander approval, if basic AFI 11-418, Operations Supervision (as
       supplemented) crew rest provisions are met.
       7.2.7.2. The second 24 hour period will be ground duties only (GDO).
7.3. Low Altitude Flights:
   7.3.1. Flight During Normal Duty Hours. Complete the remainder of the normal duty day.
   7.3.2. Flights Landing After 1930 Local Time. Both the pilot and mobile officer are excused
   from duty for 13 hours after the actual landing time, or 12 hours after completion of post
   flight duties, whichever is later.
   7.3.3. Successive Low Flights. A minimum of 3 hours will be scheduled between flights,
   landing to takeoff (e.g. U-2 to U-2, U-2 to companion trainer, or companion trainer to U-2).
7.4. Crossing Time Zones. All crew members deploying to locations that require crossing
more than three time zones must have a minimum of 48 hours at the FOL prior to their first flight
to allow circadian rhythm synchronization. This provision may be waived by the 9 OG/CC for
BUSY RELAY ferry flights.
7.5. Crew Rest: Commanders will take into account the unique physiological demands
associated with solo, extended duration high altitude flight when determining suitability of
facilities. Fabric-based billets (e.g. tents) will not be utilized due to noise and occupancy
disruptions. Where dining facilities are not available to meet mission timelines, cooking
facilities will be available for pre-flight meals.
   7.5.1. Crew rest facilities will be single occupancy climate-controlled hard billets at an
   easily accessible location separated from noise and bright lighting. At deployed locations,
   accommodations will be inspected by the squadron or FOL commander to determine
   compliance and suitability.
   7.5.2. U-2 pilot high altitude flight preparation must consider availability of a high protein,
   low residue pre-flight meal. The importance of pre-flight nutrition cannot be over-
   emphasized because of its possible detrimental impact on the mission. Unit commanders will
   ensure adequate facilities are available for mission pilot and mobile officer (backup pilot)
   pre-flight meals.
7.6. Wear of Jewelry. Jewelry, to include watches, will not be worn under the pressure suit.
AFI11-2U-2V3 15 AUGUST 2013                                                                21


7.7. Exercise: Avoid heavy exercise for 12 hours after high flights due to increased
susceptibility to DCS.
7.8. Aircrew Operations in Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Threat
Environment. The U-2 is not designed for operations in a Chemical, Biological, Radiological
and Nuclear Environment (CBRNE). The full pressure suit is not considered an Aircrew
Chemical Defense Ensemble (ACDE) nor does it provide a similar level of protection.
Contamination avoidance is the most important defense measure for both the aircraft and the
pilot. If contamination is suspected, the pilot should remain on oxygen and process through a
Contamination Control Area (CCA) facility. Assistance will be necessary to safely remove the
pilot from the pressure suit.
7.9. Deployment Timing.
   7.9.1. To decrease the risk of long-term brain injury and neurological DCS, U-2 pilots will
   normally deploy for periods of 10 weeks or less (waiver authority is 9 RW/CC).
   7.9.2. For pilots whose deployment exceeds 10 weeks, squadron or FOL commanders should
   consider providing recovery periods greater than the durations listed in Table 7.1.

                                 U-2 AIRCRAFT SECURITY

9.1. General. This chapter provides guidance on aircraft security. AFI 31-101, Air Force
Installation Security Program, and specific MAJCOM security publications contain additional
guidance.
9.2. Security.
   9.2.1. U-2 aircraft are designated a Protection Level (PL) 3 resource when in CONUS,
   Alaska or Hawaii.
   9.2.2. U-2 aircraft are designated a PL2 resource when:
       9.2.2.1. Located OCONUS (excluding Alaska and Hawaii).
       9.2.2.2. Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) configured.
       9.2.2.3. Placed on alert to support OPLAN 8010 tasking.
       9.2.2.4. When supporting Reconnaissance in Support of Nuclear Operations (RISNO)
       tasking.
   9.2.3. Aircraft security at non-US military installations is the responsibility of the controlling
   agency.
9.3. Air Force Installation Security Program. The following security procedures will
implement AFI 31-101 requirements for U-2 aircraft:
   9.3.1. When designated PL3, the aircraft is parked in an established restricted area and
   afforded protection IAW AFI 31-101.
   9.3.2. When designated PL3 and no permanent or established restricted area parking space is
   available, establish a temporary restricted area consisting of a raised rope barrier, entry
   control point, and posted with restricted area signs. Provide security response teams IAW
   AFI 31-101. Portable security lighting will be provided during the hours of darkness if
   sufficient permanent lighting is not available.
   9.3.3. When designated PL2, the U-2 may be parked inside a permanent restricted area
   containing PL1 or 2 resources with no additional security measures. If parked within an area
   containing only PL3 resources or if parked outside a permanent PL2 restricted area, security
   must be enhanced to meet criteria in AFI 31-101 for temporary PL2 restricted areas.
   9.3.4. At non-US military installations, the host base must provide security commensurate
   with PL2 requirements IAW AFI 31-101. The pilot determines the adequacy of local security
   capabilities to provide aircraft security. If he determines security to be inadequate, the
   aircraft will depart to a station where adequate security is available.
   9.3.5. The security forces must be given advance notice of all visits to the aircraft.
   9.3.6. Security support is a continual requirement and is not negated by the presence of
   aircrew or ground crewmembers. Security force support terminates only after the aircraft
   taxies.
 24                                                         AFI11-2U-2V3 15 AUGUST 2013


   9.3.7. Security force personnel are not responsible for securing classified material. This is
   the responsibility of maintenance and operational personnel IAW AFI 31-101 and AFI 31-
   401, Information Security Program.
   9.3.8. All active U-2 pilots are authorized photographic privileges within both PL2 and PL3
   restricted areas. Pilots will ensure they comply with all requirements, restrictions, and
   limitations as published in the Senior Year Program Security Classification Guide
   (SYPSCG).
9.4. En Route Security:
   9.4.1. The planning agency must coordinate with the execution agency to ensure adequate en
   route security is available.
   9.4.2. Unescorted entry is granted to aircrew members and support personnel assigned to the
   mission who possess their home station AF Form 1199, USAF Restricted Area Badge,
   supported by an Entry Authority List (EAL). Aircrew members and assigned crew chiefs are
   authorized escort authority. Escort authority must be annotated on the EAL.
   9.4.3. Personnel not identified in paragraph 9.4.2 will be escorted within the area.
9.5. Primary Mission Equipment. Secure classified equipment and documents in a properly
marked, secured, sensor equipped, and windowless facility or room designated as PL4 or higher.
Owner/user personnel control entry into the room using measures commensurate with the PL
designation of the area IAW AFI 31-101 and AFI 31-401.

Combatant Command—A unified or specified command with a broad continuing mission
under a single commander established and so designated by the President, through the Secretary
of Defense and with the advice and assistance of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
Combatant commands typically have geographic or functional responsibilities.
Combatant Command (Command Authority)—Nontransferable command authority
established by title 10 ("Armed Forces"), United States Code, section 164, exercised only by
commanders of unified or specified combatant commands unless otherwise directed by the
President or the Secretary of Defense. Combatant command (command authority) cannot be
delegated and is the authority of the combatant commander to perform those functions of
command over assigned forces involving organizing and employing commands and forces,
assigning tasks, designating objectives, and giving authoritative direction over all aspects of
military operations, joint training, and logistics necessary to accomplish the missions assigned to
the command. Combatant command (command authority) should be exercised through the
commanders of subordinate organizations. Normally this authority is exercised though
subordinate joint force commanders and service and/or functional component commanders.
Combatant command (command authority) provides full authority to organize and employ
commands and forces, as the combatant commander considers necessary to accomplish assigned
missions. Operational control is inherent in combatant command (command authority). Also
called COCOM.
Execution—Command-level approval for initiation of a mission or portion thereof after due
consideration of all pertinent factors. Execution authority is restricted to designated command
authority.
Fuel Reserve—Amount of usable fuel carried beyond that required to complete the flight as
planned.
HHQ Missions—-Missions executed at or above the numbered air force level. HHQ missions
include: deployment, redeployment, sensitive reconnaissance operations, ORIs, and PDM
input/output. Missions flown in support of flag-level exercises (e.g. RED FLAG-NEVADA) are
considered both HHQ and exercise missions.
Mission—Movement of aircraft from a designated point of origin to a designated destination as
defined by assigned mission identifier, mission nickname, or both in the schedule, mission
directive, OPORD or OPLAN.
Operational Control (DOD)—Command authority that may be exercised by commanders at
any echelon at or below the level of combatant command. Operational control is inherent in
combatant command (command authority) and may be delegated within the command. When
forces are transferred between combatant commands, the command relationship the gaining
commander will exercise (and the losing commander will relinquish) over these forces must be
specified by the Secretary of Defense. Operational control is the authority to perform those
functions of command over subordinate forces involving organizing and employing commands
and forces, assigning tasks, designating objectives, and giving authoritative direction necessary
to accomplish the mission. Operational control includes authoritative direction over all aspects of
military operations and joint training necessary to accomplish missions and assigned to the
command. Operational control should be exercised through the commanders of subordinate
organizations. Normally this authority is exercised through subordinate joint force commanders
and Service and/or functional component commanders. Operational control normally provides

full authority to organize commands and forces and to employ those forces as the commander in
operational control considers necessary to accomplish assigned missions; it does not, in and of
itself, include authoritative direction for logistics or matters of administration, discipline, internal
organization, or unit training. Also called OPCON. See also combatant command; combatant
command (command authority); tactical control. JP 1-02
Primary Mission Aircraft Inventory (PMAI)—Aircraft authorized for performance of the
operational mission. The PMAI forms the basis for allocation of operating resources to include
manpower, support equipment, and flying-hour funds. The operating command determines the
PMAI required to meet their assigned missions. PMAI also includes test and training
requirements.
Squadron Supervisor—Squadron Commander, Operations Officer, Assistant Operations
Officers, and selected senior Flight Commanders.
Tactical Control—Command authority over assigned or attached forces or commands, or
military capability or forces made available for tasking, that is limited to the detailed and,
usually, local direction and control of movements or maneuvers necessary to accomplish
missions or tasks assigned. Tactical control is inherent in operational control. Tactical control
may be delegated to, and exercised at any level at or below the level of combatant command.
Also called TACON.
