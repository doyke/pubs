                                           Chapter 1

                             GENERAL PURPOSE AND SCOPE

1.1. Purpose. The purpose of the Logistics Readiness Squadron (LRS) Quality Assurance (QA)
program is to provide the unit commander/civilian director and senior leadership with an
assessment of the unit’s ability to perform key logistics processes ensuring standardized,
repeatable, technically compliant process execution, while promoting a culture of professional
excellence and personal responsibility. It is the commander/director’s single point of contact for
―health of the squadron‖ issues and therefore must be staffed with the most professional and
technically knowledgeable personnel. The overall program intent is to instill vigor and rigor into
the logistics processes and personnel. The LRS QA program provides an objective sampling of
both the quality of processes and the proficiencies of LRS personnel. The program is designed
to provide a method of evaluating compliance with Air Force, MAJCOM, and local logistics
policy and guidance. Note: The use of the LRS unit commander throughout this instruction also
applies to a civilian director.
1.2. Scope. The guidance and procedures prescribed in this document apply to Logistics
Readiness Squadrons (see paragraph 2.13 for exemption). Quality logistics processes,
procedural compliance, and equipment reliability are the responsibility of all LRS personnel.
The combined efforts of QA personnel, squadron leaders, and technicians are necessary to ensure
high quality logistics processes, strict compliance to established policy and procedures, and
equipment reliability. The QA staff evaluates the quality of logistics processes and performs
necessary functions to ensure compliance with current materiel management, transportation,
fuels management, and logistics plans Instructions. QA personnel are not an extension of the
workforce; their purpose is to observe, assess, and evaluate logistics processes ensuring quality
process execution and personnel proficiency. The QA section serves as the primary technical
advisory agency in the squadron, helping supervisors and commanders resolve problems. The
evaluation and analysis of deficiencies and problem areas are key functions of quality assurance
that highlight and identify underlying causes of poor quality in logistics. Equipment condition
and personnel proficiency are validated through the unit QA program. Directly related to the
execution of logistics processes is the compliance with safety and environmental regulations.
The LRS QA Program will oversee and assess squadron compliance with AF safety and
environmental programs to ensure logistics processes are executed in a safe and healthy
environment. Civil service Most Efficient Organizations, and contracted organizations shall
follow the requirements established in their respective contract and accepted quality program.

                       ORGANIZATION AND RESPONSIBILITIES

2.1. Organization. The Quality Assurance Section, LGLOQ, i.e. ―QA‖, will be aligned under
the Logistics Manager, serving as the Operations Compliance Manager (Figure 2.1) as defined in
Program Action Directive 08-01, Implementation of the Chief of Staff of the Air Force Direction
to Establish the Global Wing Organizational Structure. If a Logistics Manager is not assigned,
QA will be aligned under the Operations Officer. LGLOQ will be staffed with highly
competent, well-qualified subject matter experts from the various AFSCs resident in the LRS.
Personnel assigned to formal positions within the QA section will not perform daily functional
duties except in cases where mission failure will result (for example, QA personnel will observe,
evaluate, and assess the Joint Inspection process during cargo processing; they will not be
required to execute the Joint Inspection process unless mission failure will result).

Figure 2.1. Logistics Readiness Squadron Quality Assurance Organizational Structure.




   2.1.1. The Quality Assurance Section will be responsible to evaluate compliance of
   applicable 10-Series, 20-Series, 23-Series, 24-Series and 25-Series Air Force Instructions.
   The QA Section will also be responsible for evaluating compliance with applicable safety
   directives.
   2.1.2. LRS QA Baseline Structure. The baseline structure for the LRS QA organization
   shall consist of representation from across the LRS AFSCs to provide sufficient functional
   expertise. Augmentation, as described in this AFI is authorized due to mission requirements,
   but shall be minimized as much as possible. The expected AFSC structure for the QA
   section shown in Figure 2.2 is designed for a large LRS structure (350+ personnel
   authorized). Medium LRS (200-350 personnel authorized), small LRS (under 200 personnel
   authorized) Air Reserve Component, and National Guard units are authorized to tailor the
   baseline structure in order to accomplish the quality assurance function and complete mission

   Evaluation Team (EET) during local Operational Readiness Exercises, wing directed Self
   Inspections, etc.
2.9. Contractor Managed Organizations. Contracted units performing the logistics functions
described in paragraphs 1.1 and 1.2 present unique challenges for conducting QA evaluations.
The following procedures will be followed for Contractor Managed Organizations:
   2.9.1. If the provisions of the Performance Work Statement (PWS) or Performance Plan (P-
   Plan) allow for higher headquarters direct evaluation (i.e., on-site assessment by evaluators)
   of the contracted organization, then the higher headquarters directed QA evaluation shall be
   conducted in conjunction with the Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR) in accordance
   with the guidance contained in this Instruction and governing Quality Assurance directives.
   NOTE: For the purpose of this Instruction, COR is synonymous with Quality Assurance
   Evaluator (QAE) and Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR).
       2.9.1.1. QA evaluators conducting higher headquarters directed evaluation of the
       contracted function must be properly trained in QAE functions and must coordinate
       closely with the COR on all aspects of the evaluation.
   2.9.2. If direct evaluation of the contractor managed functions is not permitted by the PWS
   or P-Plan, then follow the below guidance.
       2.9.2.1. Evaluate that the COR is providing effective oversight of the contract by
       ensuring that the QASP or P-Plan is being followed as written, that the multifunctional
       team periodically reviews the plan and initiates modifications to the plan when needed,
       and that it adheres to applicable governing directives.
       2.9.2.2. Evaluate the PWS requirements and service summary objectives against the
       organizational objectives to ensure they are adequately written to satisfy mission
       requirements.
       2.9.2.3. Ensure the Contracting Officer and COR review findings associated with
       contractor performance prior to inclusion in the LRS QA Monthly/Annual Report.
       NOTE: Only the Contracting Officer can take formal action against the contractor for
       non-compliance or direct contractors to correct deficiencies identified during evaluations.
2.10. Air National Guard (ANG) Units. ANG units performing the logistics functions
described in paragraphs 1.1 and 1.2 present unique challenges for conducting QA evaluations.
Therefore, ANG Logistics Readiness Squadrons are exempt from this Instruction. The period of
the exemption is 12 months from the date of AFI publication. During the exemption period, the
ANG, in conjunction with AF/A4LM, will establish an Integrated Product Team to develop a
plan to implement the requirements of this AFI throughout ANG Logistics Readiness Squadrons.
Once approved and coordinated, the ANG LRS QA implementation plan will be added to this
Instruction.

               EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS AND METHODOLOGY

3.1. Program Guidance. The LRS QA Section will perform analysis, surveillance, and trend
identification of LRS processes through personnel evaluations on all LRS assigned personnel and
inspections of processes. Commanders must ensure oversight is provided for all LRS processes.
The QA Section is focused on centralized oversight of critical squadron programs, most of which
are executed at the flight level. LRS QA evaluators have authority to observe, correct, and
document logistics activities within the LRS.
   3.1.1. The QA Section will be centrally aligned under the Logistics Manager / Operations
   Compliance Manager and who will report directly to the LRS/CC. The QA Section will
   serve as the primary technical advisory agency, assisting logistics readiness supervision at all
   levels to resolve quality problems, develop corrective action strategies and enhance the
   overall quality of logistics processes.
3.2. Personnel Requirements. Selecting the right personnel to fill the QA section is critical to
a successful QA program and ultimately the success of a unit’s mission. Assigned personnel
must reflect the highest standards of military bearing and professionalism, be impartial,
objective, and consistent in all evaluations. Leadership should only select qualified personnel
that are considered established functional experts, clearly adhere to and understand policy and
guidance, and are able to communicate clearly (verbally and written).
   3.2.1. The LRS QA Superintendent must be an officer, SNCO, or civilian equivalent, in a
   logistics functional specialty. SNCOs will use the duty title: NCOIC, QA Section. Use of
   QA Manager throughout this AFI will signify the role not the duty title.
   3.2.2. QA Evaluators and augmentees must be nominated by flight leadership to the
   Logistics Manager/Operations Compliance Manager. Evaluators and augmentees can be
   military or civilian personnel. The unit commander must appoint evaluators in writing.
   3.2.3. Military QA evaluators must be a TSgt or higher and possess at least a 7-skill level. If
   no qualified candidates meet this requirement, SSgts who have completed 7-level upgrade
   actions may be appointed by commander waiver.
   3.2.4. Military QA evaluators must hold the same AFSC of those being evaluated on
   technical tasks contained in the applicable CFETP. The Squadron Commander may waive
   this requirement due to mission needs.
       3.2.4.1. Areas authorized to evaluate will be identified in the evaluator's individual
       training plan. Exception: If the evaluator is a Senior NCO with an awarded 7-skill level,
       the evaluator appointment letter will serve as the STS qualification document.
   3.2.5. Civilian QA evaluators must have experience in the functional discipline they are
   responsible for evaluating. Evaluator duties must be included in the position description.
   3.2.6. Air Force Reserve units may utilize traditional reservists not on extended active duty
   as QA evaluators.
 14                                                            AFI20-112 19 OCTOBER 2010


3.3. QA Personnel Training Requirements.
   3.3.1. All QA personnel must be trained to perform QA functions. Training must cover
   evaluator responsibilities, inspection and evaluation techniques, metrics analysis, inspection
   worksheet documentation, report writing, problem-solving, publications management, and
   actions to prevent personnel injury or equipment damage.
       3.3.1.1. QA Evaluator Course (format/course yet to be determined). As a temporary
       measure, LRSs will develop a training/shadow program with local MXG QA sections to
       learn evaluation techniques.
       3.3.1.2. 8-step problem solving taught by an AFSO21 Level 2 Facilitator. If no Level 2
       facilitators are available locally, units will contact MAJCOM AFSO21 offices for
       assistance.
       3.3.1.3. Accomplish Exercise Evaluation Team (EET) Training as required locally.
       3.3.1.4. Complete the NWRM Fundamentals Course, C3906, found on the Advanced
       Distributed Learning System (ADLS) website.
       3.3.1.5. Any other specific courses required to qualify individuals for those tasks being
       evaluated (i.e. HAZMAT training, Environmental Compliance, Safety, etc.).
   3.3.2. To become fully qualified, evaluators must accomplish mandatory training and pass
   three Evaluator Personnel Evaluations (EPEs) within 90 days of appointment conducted by a
   qualified evaluator. Each QA evaluator, permanent or augmentee, must pass the EPEs prior
   to performing unsupervised evaluations and inspections. At a minimum, a qualified
   evaluator must ensure that the inspector can execute the proper steps to conduct an
   evaluation.
   3.3.3. QA augmentees require an annual EPE on either a PE or technical inspection to
   remain qualified.
   3.3.4. Create Master Training Lists utilizing the LRS QA AFJQS (under development) and
   document QA evaluator training in individual training plans and document civilian training
   on AF Form 971.
3.4. Quality Assurance Augmentation. If a functional area does not warrant a full-time
position in QA, but specialized expertise is required, select qualified technicians that are
recommended by their Flight Chief/Superintendent to be augmentees. Each QA must maintain a
listing of current augmentees. In coordination with the Operations Compliance Manager, the QA
OIC / Superintendent will establish augmentee duties.
3.5. Rotation of Quality Assurance Personnel. The Logistics Manager/Operations
Compliance Manager, in coordination with the QA OIC / Superintendent, is responsible for
developing and executing a plan to rotate QA personnel. Personnel shall be assigned to QA for a
minimum of 12 months and no longer than 24 months. Personnel will rotate back to their flights
in accordance with guidance set forth in current logistics issuances. QA personnel on short tours
do not need to meet the time requirements. Air Force Reserve personnel, civil service, and
service provider employees do not have any maximum time requirements.
3.6. Assessment Methodology. Assessments are the formal avenue to ensure the effectiveness
of logistics processes and identify areas for improvement. They provide leadership with factual
AFI20-112 19 OCTOBER 2010                                                                        15


information about the health and effectiveness of the unit and training. Accurate assessments of
personnel proficiency and processes are critical to gauging unit effectiveness. This program is
intended to enhance cross-tell and facilitate benchmarking, while allowing latitude to adapt it for
local needs. QA assessments will be conducted through the use of evaluations, inspections, and
observations.
   3.6.1. Evaluations. Represent the direct evaluation of a logistics action, inspection, or
   training conducted/performed by an individual or team. Evaluations are used to evaluate job
   proficiency, degree of training, and compliance with technical data or instructions. Any
   individual performing, supervising, or evaluating logistics tasks is subject to a direct
   evaluation. Refer to AFI 20-111 for specific procedures on conducting and rating
   evaluations. Evaluations include:
       3.6.1.1. Personnel Evaluations (PE). A PE is the direct evaluation of an individual or
       team conducting/performing a logistics action. PEs may be conducted on task-oriented
       functions such as equipment maintenance as well as process-oriented functions such as
       vehicle dispatch.
       3.6.1.2. Evaluator Proficiency Evaluations (EPE). An EPE is the direct evaluation of a
       Quality Assurance (QA) individual or any individual performing a quality/compliance
       assurance function in a unit.
       3.6.1.3. Trainer Proficiency Evaluations (TPE). A TPE is the direct evaluation of a unit
       instructor/trainer to determine their ability to teach accurately and sufficiently. TPEs also
       assess weapon system, equipment or process knowledge; teaching methods and
       techniques; the ability to operate trainers; and adequacy and effectiveness of training
       programs. Any individual training personnel on a task or process is subject to a TPE.
   3.6.2. Inspections. Represent inspections of equipment and processes, often through the use
   of LCAP functional checklists and other applicable checklists, to ensure compliance with
   established standards. LRS QA will use the LCAP functional checklists as a starting point
   for the inspections. Inspections are rated as ―Pass‖ or ―Fail.‖
       3.6.2.1. Quality Verification Inspection (QVI). A QVI is an inspection of equipment
       condition or a process after an inspection, repair action, or process has been completed by
       a technician or supervisor to assess if it was properly completed. The QVI finding should
       reflect deficiencies by the individual who accomplished the task and identify specific
       discrepancies.
       3.6.2.2. Special Inspections (SI). SIs are inspections not covered by QVIs or Evaluations
       and may include, but are not limited to, inspections of: equipment forms, document
       control procedures and file plans, consolidated tool kits, inventory controls, TO files,
       vehicle inspections, housekeeping, safety practices, FOD program, and other interest
       items identified by Headquarters Air Force and MAJCOMs. SIs may be compliance or
       proficiency oriented.
   3.6.3. Observations. Represents observed events or conditions with safety implications or
   technical violations not related to an evaluation or inspection that are considered unsafe, not
   in accordance with established procedures, or in the case of equipment, unfit to operate.
 16                                                            AFI20-112 19 OCTOBER 2010


       3.6.3.1. Detected Safety Violation (DSV). A DSV is an observed unsafe act by an
       individual. The QA evaluator must stop the unsafe act immediately. Do not document a
       separate DSV on an individual undergoing a direct evaluation since the unsafe act
       automatically results in a ―Fail‖ rating. Annotate the failure with ―Safety‖ when a safety
       violation is committed during an evaluation.
       3.6.3.2. Technical Data Violation (TDV). A TDV is an observation of any person
       performing maintenance or another logistics process without the required technical data
       present at the job site and in use. The technician must have knowledge of all general
       directives associated with the job prior to performing the task. Do not document a
       separate TDV on an individual undergoing a direct evaluation since failure to use
       technical data automatically results in a ―Fail‖ rating. Annotate the failure with ―Tech
       Data‖ when a TDV is committed during an evaluation.
       3.6.3.3. Unsatisfactory Condition Report (UCR). A UCR is an unsafe or unsatisfactory
       condition, other than a DSV, chargeable to the work center supervisor. UCRs will be
       documented even when it is not possible to determine who created the condition.
   3.6.4. Discrepancy Categories.
       3.6.4.1. Category I (CAT I). A required inspection/TO procedural item missed or
       improperly completed. This category is a specific work card item or TO step, note,
       caution, or warning for that specific evaluated task. Use sub-classification of major or
       minor to indicate the discrepancy’s relative severity.
       3.6.4.2. Category II (CAT II). An obvious defect, which could have been readily
       detected by a technician or supervisor, but is not a specific work card item or TO step,
       note, caution, or warning for that specific evaluated task. Use sub-classification of major
       or minor to indicate the discrepancy’s relative severity.
3.7. Assessment Focus Areas. Assessments will concentrate on the following areas:
Compliance with Nuclear Surety Standards (if applicable), Qualified and Proficient Workforce,
Compliance with Technical Orders (TO), Instructions, Manuals, and Directives, Compliance and
Management of Safety Programs, Facilities and Equipment Condition, and Asset Accountability.
The LRS QA Unit Report will group unit deficiencies in these focus areas.
   3.7.1. Compliance with Nuclear Surety Standards (if applicable). Personnel at all levels are
   responsible for ensuring nuclear weapons, nuclear weapon systems, and nuclear weapon
   related materiel is safe, secure, and reliable. Ensure weapon system safety rules, owner/user
   security, and reliability standards are strictly adhered.
   3.7.2. Qualified and Proficient Workforce. Ensure a properly trained and qualified
   workforce is maintained to accomplish the mission. Commanders are responsible for
   ensuring unit personnel receive the proper training to accomplish the mission. Factors that
   impede the unit’s ability to adequately achieve or maintain a qualified workforce should be
   identified to higher headquarters.
   3.7.3. Compliance with Technical Orders (TO), Instructions, Manuals, and Directives.
   Personnel at all levels are responsible and accountable for enforcing mandatory standards.
   Ensure all applicable TOs, Instructions, manuals, and directives are complete, current, and

   used. This includes ensuring required forms and records are properly completed and
   maintained in accordance with applicable directives for any logistics-related activity.
   3.7.4. Compliance and Management of Safety Programs.            Personnel at all levels are
   responsible for minimizing risk to equipment and personnel.
   3.7.5. Facilities and Equipment Condition. Supervisors at all levels are required to ensure
   adequate facilities and equipment required to accomplish the mission are available and
   properly maintained. Commanders are responsible for identifying facility and equipment
   conditions and shortfalls that impact mission accomplishment to the appropriate
   agency/higher headquarters.
   3.7.6. Asset Accountability. Personnel at all levels are responsible for ensuring the
   accountability of tools, materiel, equipment, and weapons. This includes ensuring Positive
   Inventory Control (PIC) of nuclear weapons, nuclear weapon systems, Nuclear Weapons
   Related Materiel (NWRM), classified assets, CCI/COMSEC, equipment, serialized control
   items, small arms, conventional munitions, and sensitive related materiel. It includes
   ensuring that accurate logistics data is reflected for the materiel in appropriate functional
   information management systems.
3.8. Assessment Procedures.
   3.8.1. The QA Section will notify the LRS Commander and Logistics Manager/Operations
   Compliance Manager immediately of all major findings or failures related to safety, security,
   or     nuclear   surety.        Additionally,    the     QA   Section      will     suspense
   assessments/evaluations/inspections receiving a fail, DSV, TDV, or UCR to the appropriate
   flight commander/superintendent for corrective action(s).
   3.8.2. Work centers will respond to all findings by stating the action taken to resolve the
   identified problem(s) to include an ―implementation date or estimated closure date.‖ Root
   cause analysis will be conducted for all major findings to determine underlying causes and
   appropriate corrective action. The LRS QA Section can assist with conducting root cause
   analysis. Work center responses will be routed through the superintendent and flight
   commander before reaching the QA Section. Unit commanders will be briefed on
   open/closed items monthly. Confirmation of immediate corrections or planned corrective
   actions to resolve major findings or failures will be routed and returned to the LRS QA OIC /
   Superintendent Manager within 5 duty days.
   3.8.3. Evaluators must review all individuals’ OJT Records for evaluations receiving a fail,
   DSV, or TDV to verify training documentation (i.e., have individuals been trained, etc.).
   Identify discrepancies in documentation to the unit training manager for follow-up action. At
   no time will the evaluation ratings be changed based on OJT Record documentation
   discrepancies alone.
   3.8.4. Results of all observations/evaluations/inspections will be recorded in the LRS QA
   database.
Note: Active duty units will file the completed forms by shift within each respective month and
maintain them for four years. File maintenance can be done via hard copy or electronically in
the QA database. If done electronically, ensure routine backups are accomplished.
 18                                                             AFI20-112 19 OCTOBER 2010


   3.8.5. All findings (i.e. failed evaluation/inspection or observations) will include a reference
   to the technical order, Instruction, and/or command standard violated of each finding prior to
   the determination to include that finding in the QA database. Evaluators will review
   evaluation results with the person(s)/supervisor evaluated upon completion of each
   evaluation.
   3.8.6. Findings will be categorized into one of the six Evaluation Focus Areas used in the
   LCAP. Refer to AFI 20-111, paragraph 3.4, for full descriptions of each.
      3.8.6.1. Findings. Findings are validated deficiencies and will be tracked at the unit level
      until resolved.
          3.8.6.1.1. Major Finding. A deficiency that results or could result in widespread or
          significant mission impact or failure.
          3.8.6.1.2. Minor Finding. A deficiency that is procedurally incorrect but only has
          minor mission impact.
3.9. Assessment Frequency.
   3.9.1. The minimum number of required monthly assessments must be equal to 40 percent of
   available active duty, civilian, and Air Force Reserve (except those on annual tour)
   personnel. For example, for a squadron of 300 available personnel, the QA section must
   complete 120 assessments each month which can include any combination of personnel
   evaluations, quality verification inspections, and/or special inspections. The number of
   assessments needs to be equally allocated, as appropriate given the complexity of the
   evaluation, for each week within the monthly time period. Fuels inspectors will perform at
   least 10 assessments each week. Bases with less than 20 full-time fuels personnel will be
   required to perform at least two assessments per week. All LRS personnel must be assessed
   at least once each year.
   3.9.2. Available personnel are those ―on station‖ performing tasks – including augmenting
   forces. Individuals who are off station will not be counted.
   3.9.3. Assessments must be conducted over all shifts, including weekends as applicable to
   the individual duty sections.
   3.9.4. During official exercises and/or contingencies that require direct support from the
   LRS; the commander has the authority to waive QA assessments during that specified time
   period.
3.10. Unit Annual Assessments.
   3.10.1. The QA Section must evaluate all elements within the LRS annually (at least once
   each twelve months). The LRS Commander may require more frequent visits.
      3.10.1.1. Fuels inspectors will evaluate all Fuels elements semiannually (at least once
      each six months).
      3.10.1.2. LRS units at deployed/remote locations will conduct a semiannual evaluation.
   3.10.2. The QA Section will revisit after 30 days but within 45 days to check each
   discrepancy found during the annual or semi-annual evaluations.
AFI20-112 19 OCTOBER 2010                                                                     19


  3.10.3. Unit Annual/Fuels Semi-Annual Evaluation Plan. The QA Section shall develop and
  maintain a schedule indicating the areas that will be visited and the proposed month of the
  visit. The QA Section will develop an evaluation and inspection plan showing areas, types,
  and numbers of inspections and evaluations that will be conducted and provide copies of the
  plan and schedule to all flights, the Operations Compliance Manager, and the LRS
  Commander.
  3.10.4. When developing the plan, the QA OIC / Superintendent will:
     3.10.4.1. Address areas of concern identified by flight chiefs, the Operations Compliance
     Manager, and the Operations Officer.
     3.10.4.2. Tailor the plan for each flight or section.
     3.10.4.3. Review, formalize, and distribute the evaluation plan.
  3.10.5. Assessments must be conducted within 60 days of the date of the previous
  year's/Fuels semi-annual evaluation.
  3.10.6. The LRS/CC has the option to waive the annual/Fuels semi-annual evaluation for
  flights scheduled the month before, during, and after a MAJCOM Logistics Compliance
  Assessment Program (LCAP) or Unit Compliance Inspection (UCI). This will provide the
  LRS Commander the flexibility needed to meet last-minute taskings and eliminate the
  duplication of LCAP/UCI reports without diluting the effectiveness of the annual evaluation
  program. The LCAP/UCI will fulfill the annual/semi-annual evaluation requirement.
  3.10.7. The LRS/CC shall have one or more qualified individuals from another flight to
  perform an annual assessment on the QA Section.
  3.10.8. Unit Assessment Criteria. The QA Section shall use the standard functional LCAP
  checklists          published           on          the         LCAP           CoP         at
  (https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/CoP/OpenCoP.asp?Filter=AF-LG-00-34).
  Additionally, supplemental functional checklists may be developed from AF and Command
  directives for use at the unit level. For evaluations of technician proficiency and equipment
  condition, applicable technical data is the evaluation standard. Local directives, additional
  checklists, and other methods may be added to conduct the evaluation.
  3.10.9. QA evaluators will use AF Form 4421, Logistics Readiness Squadron Quality
  Assurance (LRS QA) Assessment Form, (once published) when conducting evaluations.
  3.10.10. Prior to conducting the assessment, the QA evaluator shall discuss assessment
  areas, special items of concern and discrepancies from the last assessment with the element
  supervisor and appropriate Flight Chief.
  3.10.11. Evaluation Exit Briefing. At the end of the evaluation visit, conduct an exit briefing
  with the flight chief and all section supervisors. Thoroughly discuss all deficiencies and
  resolve differences of opinion.
  3.10.12. Evaluation Written Report. A detailed written report of the evaluation shall be
  routed through the Flight Chief, Operations Compliance Manager, and Commander within 10
  duty days after the exit briefing. Include all identified deficiencies, their main causes, and
  recommended changes. Be sure to identify repeat discrepancies and list the source of the
 20                                                               AFI20-112 19 OCTOBER 2010


   original discrepancy. Units will use the AF Form 2419 to route the report and the AF Form
   2420 to document findings.
   3.10.13. Include and specify training requirements in the report. Provide the Training
   Section with a copy of all surveillance reports that identify training requirements.
   3.10.14. Replies to Evaluation Reports. Replies are due to the QA Section within 30
   workdays of the date of the report. Replies will contain all corrective and preventive actions
   taken and/or planned including the need for additional root cause analysis. Replies will
   indicate whether a discrepancy is closed (corrective action completed) or open. The writer of
   the reply should include the corrective action already taken and the estimated completion
   date (ECD). ECDs should be actively monitored to ensure corrective action is completed in a
   timely manner.
   3.10.15. Review of Replies. The QA OIC / Superintendent will review replies. Replies
   should be adequate and completely present corrective and preventive actions. Provide
   approval, disapproval, and comments to the Logistics Manager/Operations Officer and LRS
   Commander.
   3.10.16. Return replies to the appropriate flight for further action, if they are unacceptable.
   3.10.17. File completed evaluation reports and replies in the QA Section.
   3.10.18. Report Handling. Reports generated under the Logistics Readiness Squadron
   Quality Assurance Program are privileged documents. As such, the Air Force controls
   distribution. All reports generated under this program should be classified, released and
   distributed consistent with AFI 20-111, Para 4.5., LCAP Report Handling.
3.11. Grading. Consistent with the LCAP Program, the purpose of the LRS QA is to evaluate a
unit’s ability to perform key processes in a safe and compliant manner; the LRS will receive an
overall grade based on a five-tier grading scale. A final report of findings, problem areas, and
recommended improvements (as required) will be distributed to senior leaders and all inspected
flights/sections.
   3.11.1. The QA OIC / Superintendent will assign ratings that accurately reflect observed
   performance and will use the described scoring methodology as the starting point for
   determining grades. However, the grading criteria are designed as a guide and are not a
   substitute for the judgment of the QA OIC / Superintendent. When the QA OIC /
   Superintendent ratings differ from the established grading criteria, the rationale will be
   explained in the QA Report.
   3.11.2. The Five-Tier Grading Scale is:

Table 3.1. Grading Scale
                             Outstanding            95 - 100%
                             Excellent              90 - 94.99%
                             Satisfactory           80 - 89.99%
                             Marginal               70 - 79.99%
                             Unsatisfactory         0 - 69.99%
AFI20-112 19 OCTOBER 2010                                                                    21


3.12. Scoring. The overall score will be determined by calculating a baseline score and then
deducting for penalties.
   3.12.1. Baseline Score. The baseline score is calculated by dividing the total number of
   passed events by the total of all events. Events are defined as Evaluations (paragraph 3.6.1)
   and Inspections (paragraph 3.6.2). Do not include observations in the baseline score.
   3.12.2. Deductions. Deductions are calculated by assessing a .5% penalty for each
   observation as defined in paragraph 3.6.3. and repeat LRS QA findings. A repeat finding is
   defined as any identified ―Major‖ finding from the previous LRS QA evaluation.
   3.12.3. For nuclear units (units that are tasked with a nuclear mission), each condition
   resulting in, or meeting the criteria for, an ―Unreliable Nuclear Weapon,‖ ―Unsafe
   Environment,‖ or ―Insecure Environment‖ as defined in TO 11N-25-1, Department of
   Defense Nuclear Weapons Technical Inspection System, Section 3-2.2 will be treated as a
   .5% deduction. Each of these conditions will be reported as a Major Finding as defined in
   paragraph 3.8.6.1.1. and annotated with ―UNACCEPTABLE CONDITION THAT
   REQUIRES IMMEDIATE ATTENTION.‖
 22                                                           AFI20-112 19 OCTOBER 2010

Evaluations— Represent the direct evaluation of a logistics action, inspection, or training
conducted/performed by an individual or team. Evaluations are used to evaluate job proficiency,
degree of training, and compliance with technical data or instructions. Any individual
performing, supervising, or evaluating logistics tasks is subject to a direct evaluation. Refer to
AFI 20-111 for specific procedures on conducting and rating evaluations.
Personnel Evaluation— the direct evaluation of an individual or team conducting/performing a
logistics action. PEs may be conducted on task-oriented functions such as equipment
maintenance as well as process-oriented functions such as vehicle dispatch.
Evaluator Proficiency Evaluations— the direct evaluation of a QA individual or any individual
performing a quality/compliance assurance function in a unit.
AFI20-112 19 OCTOBER 2010                                                                       27


Trainer Proficiency Evaluations— the direct evaluation of a unit instructor/trainer to determine
their ability to teach accurately and sufficiently. TPEs also assess weapon system, equipment or
process knowledge; teaching methods and techniques; the ability to operate trainers; and
adequacy and effectiveness of training programs. Any individual training personnel on a task or
process is subject to a TPE.
Inspections— represent inspections of equipment and processes, often through the use of LCAP
functional checklists and other applicable checklists, to ensure compliance with established
standards. Inspections are rated as ―Pass‖ or ―Fail.‖
Quality Verification Inspection— an inspection of equipment condition or a process after an
inspection, repair action, or process has been completed by a technician or supervisor to assess if
it was properly completed. The QVI finding should reflect deficiencies by the individual who
accomplished the task and identify specific discrepancies.
Special Inspections— inspections not covered by QVIs or Evaluations and may include, but are
not limited to, inspections of: equipment forms, document control procedures and file plans,
consolidated tool kits, inventory controls, TO files, vehicle inspections, housekeeping, safety
practices, FOD program, and other interest items identified by Headquarters Air Force and
MAJCOMs. SIs may be compliance or proficiency oriented.
Observations— represents observed events or conditions with safety implications or technical
violations not related to an evaluation or inspection that are considered unsafe, not in accordance
with established procedures, or in the case of equipment, unfit to operate.
Detected Safety Violation— an observed unsafe act by an individual.
Technical Data Violation— an observation of any person performing maintenance or another
logistics process without the required technical data present at the job site and in use.
Unsatisfactory Condition Report— an unsafe or unsatisfactory condition, other than a DSV,
chargeable to the work center supervisor.
Discrepancy Category I— a required inspection/TO procedural item missed or improperly
completed. This category is a specific work card item or TO step, note, caution, or warning for
that specific evaluated task. Use sub-classification of major or minor to indicate the
discrepancy’s relative severity.
Discrepancy Category II— an obvious defect, which could have been readily detected by a
technician or supervisor, but is not a specific work card item or TO step, note, caution, or
warning for that specific evaluated task. Use sub-classification of major or minor to indicate the
discrepancy’s relative severity.
Major Finding— A deficiency that results or could result in widespread or significant mission
impact or failure.
Minor Finding— A deficiency that is procedurally incorrect but only has minor mission impact.
