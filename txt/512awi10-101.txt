            security clearance document and are trained in proper handling of classified material.
3. Program Management. GCCM and UCCM will use this guidance in developing a Group
and UCC.
     3.1. The GCCM/UCCM should be the OPR for the GCC/UCC program within their
     organization. They will develop specific written procedures for internal operation of their
     GCC/UCC, manage the program, further define its scope and be the POC for the commander.
     The GCCM/UCCM will ensure implementation of the procedures in this instruction within
     their organization. The GCCM/UCCM should be a full-time person in the unit and not be the
     UDM.
512AWI10-101 20 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                   5


   3.2. Complete the self inspection checklist semiannually and provide a copy to the Chief of
   Operations Plans (OSF/OSTX).
   3.3. One of the critical functions of the GCC/UCC will be to implement the QRCs as
   directed by the ICC. These checklists were developed to respond to a wide variety of
   situations and are written to cover every unit/function on the base. QRCs are very general in
   nature. The GCCM/UCCM should develop, if appropriate, a unit specific supplement to
   QRCs that covers any unique procedures for their facility needed to comply with checklist
   items. Attachment 3 Sample (Supplement to the QRC for the Unit Control Centers) is the
   suggested format to use when developing a supplement and is intended to clarify the steps
   listed in the QRC. A supplement does not relieve the group/unit from the responsibility of
   running the QRC.
   3.4. The most often used checklists in the QRCs are 5-3, 5-4, 5-5, and 5-6. They are
   available                 on               436                AW/XP                    Intranet
   https://eim.amc.af.mil/org/436awxp/QRCs/Forms/AllItems.aspx.              They address the
   required actions for each FORCE PROTECTION CONDITION level. These checklists deal,
   in a large part, with building and personnel security. Designate a central area to maintain the
   QRCs and brief key personnel on its location and use.
   3.5. All 512 AW GCC/UCCs will use FORCE PROTECTION CONDITION and Shelter in
   Place     signs  that    can    be     located     on    the     436      AW/XP   Intranet
   https://eim.amc.af.mil/org/436awxp/EM/Emergency%20Management%20documents/F
   orms/AllItems.aspx. The unit will be required to post these signs during any exercise/real
   world event. Acquire enough of each to cover all entrances/exits to building.
   3.6. Train commanders and selected personnel in the proper procedures for activating and
   operating GCC/UCC.
4. Required Items. The GCCM/UCCM will maintain the following publications and materials
for use whenever the GCC/UCC is activated.
   4.1. 512 AWI 10-101, Unit Control Center Responsibilities.
   4.2. Unit Checklist Supplements to the QRCs.
