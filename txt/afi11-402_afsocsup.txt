                                          Chapter 1

                                GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Who Must Comply. The basis of the USAF aviation service program policies and
requirements of this instruction is Public Law. Since this document supplements other
Department of Defense (DoD) guidance, the more restrictive provisions of this instruction apply
to active duty and Air Reserve Component (ARC) rated officers, CEA, non-rated aircrew
members, parachutists, and operational support personnel. Additional parachutist guidance may
be found in AFI 11-410, Personnel Parachute Operations.
1.2. Responsibilities of AF/A3O-AT. The Chief, Operational Training Division (AF/A3O-AT)
establishes and monitors the Air Force aviation and parachutist service programs as outlined in
this instruction to ensure compliance with DoD policy.
1.3. Responsibilities of MAJCOMs. MAJCOM commanders, through Aviation Resource
Management (ARM) staffs, will provide guidance, criteria, and supervision to subordinate
organizations to ensure compliance with the requirements of this instruction.
   1.3.1. MAJCOMs will establish procedures to monitor and ensure actions to
   suspend/disqualify members from aviation/parachutist status are completed IAW this
   instruction, AFI 11-401, Aviation Management and AFI 11-421, Aviation Resource
   Management. As a minimum, procedures will include a quarterly review of ARMS data
   pertaining to: suspended aircrew/parachutists pending permanent disqualification actions,
   aircrew in Aircrew Position Indicator (API) coded 0/Z Unit Manpower Document (UMD)
   positions for validation of correct Aviation Service Code (ASC) assignment, and parachutists
   in "J" coded UMD positions for validation of correct ASC or parachutist status.
1.4. Responsibilities of Subordinate Organizations. Commanders, through Squadron
Aviation Resource Management (SARM), Tenant Aviation Resource Management (TARM), and
base Host Aviation Resource Management (HARM) office staffs will ensure compliance with
the requirements of this instruction.
   1.4.1. Commanders will establish procedures to monitor and ensure actions to
   suspend/disqualify members from aviation/parachutist status are completed IAW this
   instruction, AFI 11-401, and AFI 11-421. As a minimum, procedures will include a monthly
   review of ARMS data pertaining to: suspended aircrew/parachutists pending permanent
   disqualification actions, aircrew in API 0/Z coded UMD positions for validation of correct
   ASC, and parachutists in "J" coded UMD positions for validation of correct ASC or
   parachutist status.
   1.4.1. (AFSOC) Squadron Aviation Resource Management (SARM) offices will run a
   monthly browser of permanently disqualified aircrew members and provide a copy to the unit
   commander. The servicing Host Aviation Resource Management (HARM) office will run a
   monthly browser of Career Enlisted Aviators (CEA) who are permanently disqualified from
   aviation service and provide a copy to the group CEA FM to coordinate with Military
   Personnel Section (MPS) on retraining affected members. In turn, HQ AFSOC/A3TR will
   run a quarterly Aviation Resource Management System (ARMS) browser of CEAs who are
AFI11-402_AFSOCSUP 12 JUNE 2012                                                              11


   permanently disqualified from aviation service and provide a copy to the HQ AFSOC/A3
   CEA FM for action. (T-2)
      1.4.1.1. Commanders will make every reasonable effort to ensure members suspended
      from aviation or parachutist service are not separated or permanently reassigned until
      disqualification action is submitted through channels and completed by the MAJCOM.
      Commanders will notify the MAJCOM A3T or equivalent when members are separated
      from military service before disqualification actions are completed.
      1.4.1.1. (AFSOC) Commanders will notify HQ AFSOC/A3TR when members are
      being separated or permanently reassigned before disqualification actions are completed.
      (T-1)
          1.4.1.1.1. Commanders will ensure that disqualified members who remain in the
          USAF are identified to the MPF classification and training section for retraining or
          return to a previously awarded AFSC.
      1.4.1.2. (Added-AFSOC) SARM or Tenant Aviation Resource Management (TARM)
      offices will run a monthly ARMS browser of all suspended aircrew or parachutist
      personnel and provide it to the unit commander. The SARM office will draft and
      coordinate waiver request packages on members who will be suspended past 180 days for
      HQ AFSOC/A3T approval no later than the 150th day of suspension. If the member will
      remain suspended beyond 365 days, the package must be resubmitted with further
      justification, explaining delays in final disqualification action. Forward waiver requests
      to AFSOC/A3 no later than (NLT) 335th day of suspension for approval. The waiver
      request package will included the Staff Summary Sheet (SSS), waiver letter, ARMS
      Individual Data Summary (IDS), and aeronautical orders (AO) and will be forwarded
      from the unit commander (or division chief for HQ AFSOC staff agencies) through group
      (or staff) channels to HQ AFSOC/A3TR. HQ AFSOC/A3TR will coordinate package for
      HQ AFSOC/A3T (180 day waiver) or AFSOC/A3 (365 day waiver) approval
      accordingly. Unit SARM offices will ensure the servicing HARM office is included on
      the SSS. HARM office coordination is required to ensure the waiver package complies
      with AFI requirements. (T-2)
1.5. Responsibility of Aircrew, Parachutists, and Operational Support Members.
   1.5.1. Complete flight physicals and Preventive Health Assessment (PHA) IAW AFI 48-123,
   Medical Examinations and Standards and AFI 44-170, Preventive Health Assessment. Flight
   physicals become due 366 days after the previous physical, and expire after the 455th day or
   as indicated on the AF IMT 1042, whichever occurs first. The required frequency may vary
   to address waivers and/or individual physical limitations (as determined by the Flight
   Surgeon), but in no case will exceed 455 days. Aircrew/parachutists in Duty Not Involving
   Flying (DNIF) status will accomplish an annual flight physical, unless a flight surgeon
   confirms the medical condition prevents accomplishment of the physical (see paragraph
   3.7.2.2. Note). Inactive aircrew members, except those with the exempt ASCs listed in AFI
   48-123 will complete an annual flight physical.”
   1.5.2. Aircrew, parachutists, and operational support fliers will notify the HARM office
   immediately when flight or jump incentive pay has not been terminated if:
      1.5.2.1. Suspended from aviation/parachutist service.
 12                                                    AFI11-402_AFSOCSUP 12 JUNE 2012


       1.5.2.2. Disqualified from aviation/parachutist service.
       1.5.2.3. In DNIF status longer than 365 days (rated officers and CEAs).
       1.5.2.4. In DNIF status longer than 180 days (non-rated officers, non-CEA aircrew
       members, and parachutists).
       1.5.2.5. Member is a non-rated or non-CEA aircrew member no longer assigned to an
       active flying billet.
       1.5.2.6. Member is a rated officer or CEA assigned to an inactive flying UMD position
       and continues to receive conditional ACIP/CEFIP.
          1.5.2.6.1. Member is assigned to an active flying position and receives conditional
          flying incentive pay without satisfying requirements for entitlement IAW DoD 7000-
          14.R Department of Defense Financial Management Regulation, Volume 7A. (DoD
          FMR, Volume 7A), Chapter 22.
       1.5.2.7. Member is a parachutist no longer assigned to a jump inherent DAFSC UMD
       position IAW AFI 11-410 or "J" prefixed UMD DAFSC.
          1.5.2.7.1. Member is assigned to a valid jump billet and receives jump incentive pay
          without meeting requirements for entitlement IAW DoD FMR, Volume 7A, Chapter
          24.
       1.5.2.8. Member is a flight surgeon, non-rated non-CEA aircrew member, or parachutist
       member double billeted against a UMD position (without approved waiver) and the other
       incumbent is on active aeronautical orders and receives flight/jump incentive pay.
   1.5.3. Contact the local finance office for rate of pay discrepancies. Each aircrew
   member/parachutist must validate that IAW DoD FMR, Volume 7A, the rate of pay received
   is commensurate with years of aviation service (rated and CEA), pay grade (non-rated/non-
   CEA), or type jump status (static-line/Military Free Fall) .
       1.5.3.1. Although the member is responsible to ensure he/she receives the correct rate of
       flying or parachutist incentive pay, the HARM office will work with aircrew
       members/parachutists and the local finance office to resolve suspected rate of pay
       discrepancies. This responsibility includes but is not limited to providing copies of
       appropriate aviation management documentation to assist in rectifying discrepancies.
1.6. Specific Guidelines:
   1.6.1. An AF member will receive flight/jump incentive pay only when he or she is: 1)
   receiving basic pay; 2) physically and professionally qualified for aviation service and; 3) on
   aeronautical orders that require the member to perform specific in-flight/jump duties. The
   AO certifies that the member satisfies all requirements for aviation/parachutist service and is
   the official authorization to perform in-flight/jump duties.
   1.6.2. Assigning a member to an active flying/jump position solely for the purpose of
   accumulating Operational Flying Duty Accumulator (OFDA) credit or qualifying for flying
   incentive pay is contrary to public law and USAF policy and therefore, not authorized.
AFI11-402_AFSOCSUP 12 JUNE 2012                                                                 13


1.7. Training.
   1.7.1. Entry into training for the rated force is voluntary. Once awarded an aeronautical
   rating, a rated officer must perform all aircrew and rated staff duties assigned. This
   requirement includes additional flying training related to the officer's rated specialty and
   Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) duties.
   1.7.2. Entry into training for the CEA force is voluntary. Once awarded an Aircrew
   Operations or Remotely Piloted Aircraft Sensor Operator AFSC, the CEA must perform all
   aircrew and CEA staff duties assigned. This requirement includes additional flying training
   related to the member’s specialty.
   1.7.3. Training for parachutists is voluntary. Once awarded the jump inherent DAFSC IAW
   AFI 11-410 or “J” prefixed DAFSC, a parachutist must perform all parachutist duties
   assigned. This includes additional jump training related to the member's specialty.
   1.7.4. Non-rated officers and non-CEA enlisted personnel must volunteer to enter
   qualification training to perform in-flight duties in an aircraft as non-rated aircrew members
   or operational support fliers. Unless permanently disqualified, members who complete initial
   training remain available for flying duties and may be directed to perform such duties at any
   time.
1.8. Qualification and Disqualification.
   1.8.1. Qualification for aviation/parachutist service is not a right; it rests within the sole
   discretion of the approval authority. Members remain qualified for aviation/parachutist
   service based on medical and professional qualification and potential to obtain and maintain
   qualification in an aircraft (aircrew).
   1.8.2. Aircrew and parachutist members must maintain medical and professional
   qualification to remain qualified for aviation/parachutist service. Do not enter members with
   a substantiated record of drug abuse into aviation/parachutist service duties except IAW AFI
   36-2205, Applying for Flying Training, Air Battle Manager, and Astronaut Programs as
   applicable to initial Undergraduate Flying Training (UFT) applicants.
   1.8.3. Air Force personnel may request voluntary disqualification from aviation/parachutist
   service. Approval is contingent on the best interests of the USAF. See Table 3.1 for approval
   authority.
   1.8.4. Disqualification from aviation/parachutist service is an administrative action. It is not
   a disciplinary action, nor a substitute for action under the Uniform Code of Military Justice
   (UCMJ) or any other administrative directive. The USAF will disqualify a member from
   aviation/parachutist service when he or she is found medically or professionally unqualified
   to perform aviation/parachutist service according to this instruction. Disqualification
   terminates flight/jump incentive pay.
1.9. Documentation of Case Actions.
   1.9.1. HARM offices will ensure the case file of a suspended aircrew member or parachutist
   with pending disqualification action includes an Aviation Resource Management System
   (ARMS) Individual Data Summary (IDS), Flying History Report (FHR), Individual Flight
   Record (IFR), Jump History Report (JHR), and Individual Jump Record (IJR) (if applicable).
   Following a thorough flight or jump record review (within 30 days IAW AFI 11-401), the
 14                                                    AFI11-402_AFSOCSUP 12 JUNE 2012


   member will sign and certify the IDS. HARM office personnel will file the certified IDS
   permanently in the member’s Flight Record Folder (FRF) or Jump Record Folder (JRF) as
   applicable.
      1.9.1.1. At the conclusion of an aviation/parachutist service action, all case file
      documentation becomes a permanent part of the member's master personnel record. All
      contents of a case file must be clear and legible (See AFI 36-2608, Military Personnel
      Records System). MAJCOMs will keep copies of disqualification packages for eight
      years.
      1.9.1.2. (Added-AFSOC) Aviation Service Action Packages Not Listed in
      Paragraphs 1. 9.1––1.9.1.1, in the Basic Instruction. After convening authority
      review, forward the complete original package to HQ AFSOC/A3TR. (T-2)
   1.9.2. HARM offices must receive an ASD adjustment letter or a copy of the Department of
   the Air Force (DAF) AO containing the ASD adjustment before publishing a MPO for an
   aircrew member approved for requalification or revalidation of aviation service and also
   authorized an ASD adjustment IAW paragraph 3.11.2 If the member is required to fly prior
   to the ASD adjustment completion, the HARM may publish the requalification AO. The
   HARM office will request AF/A3O-ATF or HQ AFRC/A3TB (ARC members) to take the
   appropriate action IAW paragraph 3.8.1.3 Upon receipt of an ASD adjustment letter from
   AF/A3O-ATF or HQ AFRC/A3TB (ARC members), the HARM office will validate the
   adjusted date in ARMS, publish the appropriate AO, and start incentive pay entitlement (if
   otherwise qualified).
1.10. Aviation/Parachutist Service Action Requalification, Revalidation, Disqualification
Suspenses. When an aircrew member or parachutist is suspended pending disqualification,
MAJCOMs will complete processing of the case within 180 days. MAJCOMs will establish
suspense dates and ensure timely processing of all cases and immediate termination of
flight/jump incentive pay when a member is suspended or disqualified.
1.10. (AFSOC)Aviation/Parachutist Service Action Requalification, Revalidation,
Disqualification Suspenses. Commanders will complete suspension and (or) disqualification
actions within 180 days from suspension effective date.       Commanders must ensure
disqualification packages are submitted to HQ AFSOC/A3TR within 2 weeks of administrative
actions being completed. (T-2)
   1.10.1. If a member is suspended, terminate incentive pay effective one calendar day prior to
   the effective date of the suspension (if otherwise qualified to receive incentive pay up to that
   date). If the member is ultimately disqualified, incentive pay remains terminated. If a
   member is disqualified without previously being suspended, terminate flight/jump incentive
   pay effective one calendar day prior to effective date of the disqualification action (if
   otherwise qualified up to that date). (Note: If the member’s incentive pay was previously
   terminated prior to the effective date of suspension/disqualification, pay remains terminated
   from that date.)
1.11. Standards of Application. Except as otherwise provided in Chapter 4, base decisions
for aviation/parachutist service actions on the following standards:
AFI11-402_AFSOCSUP 12 JUNE 2012                                                                 15


   1.11.1. The decision authority need not be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt or by a
   preponderance of the evidence that the conclusions are true. The decision authority must
   believe only that the conclusions are supported by substantial evidence.
   1.11.2. The decision authority may consider any information that in his or her judgment has
   value.
1.12. Preparation of AOs. AOs officially document aviation/parachutist service actions.
Publish, distribute, and maintain AOs IAW AFI 11-421. When possible, the commander will
advise the member of the content and effect of an AO before the effective date.
   1.12.1. Requests for AOs. The HARM office publishes AOs that initiate or terminate
   aviation or parachutist service. The commander submitting the request letter will certify the
   member's eligibility for aviation/parachutist service and validate the flying/jump
   requirement.
      1.12.1.1. This certification will include verification of medical qualification IAW AFI
      48-123 and assignment to a valid flying/jump UMD position (includes student billets).
      The HARM office will not publish an AO to initiate aviation or parachutist service unless
      the member is medically qualified and assigned to a valid UMD flying/jump position
      (includes student billets). Exception: For a temporary parachute duty request, the HARM
      office must receive the authorization for temporary jump status signed by the appropriate
      MAJCOM authority with the member’s commander certification request letter. Members
      will be medically qualified before temporary jump status is authorized. See AFI 11-410
      for more detailed information regarding temporary jump status. Refer to AFI 11-421 for
      effective date of AOs for aircrew/parachutist members. The effective date of an AO will
      not be prior to the effective date of medical clearance, regardless of flying training class
      start dates. All requirements must be met IAW AFI 11-421 and this instruction.
      1.12.1.2. If required for the aircraft, certification will also include verification that the
      member successfully completed physiological training IAW AFI 11-403, Aerospace
      Physiological Training Program. Physiological training will be completed before the
      member participates in his/her first flight.
      1.12.1.3. The commander will also verify the member possesses the appropriate level of
      security clearance for the aircraft and review the member's past aviation service
      qualification. Any impediment to the crewmember’s aviation service will be brought to
      the commander's attention.
      1.12.1.4. Validation of active flying/jump requirements includes confirmation of the
      specific API code, appropriate DAFSC or DAFSC prefix, establishment of a Flying
      Activity Code (FAC) IAW AFI 11-401 and verification that the member is entered in
      training to obtain and maintain qualification in an aircraft. For operational support fliers,
      the HARM office will confirm operational support requirements and allocation of
      sufficient man-months.
   1.12.2. Authority for Change. The authority for changing a member's aviation/parachutist
   service status depends on the type of action. A member's commander (or any commander
   within command channels), aerospace Flight Medicine Element (FME) office, servicing
   HARM office, Military Personnel Section (MPS), or AF may initiate the action. Each
   authority will immediately notify the member's servicing HARM office with supporting
16                                                    AFI11-402_AFSOCSUP 12 JUNE 2012


  justification and request publication of the appropriate AO. Unless the approval authority is
  restricted to AF, an individual's servicing HARM office publishes the AO.
  1.12.3. Effective Period of the AO. Depending upon the category of aircrew or parachutist
  member, an individual's availability or duration of the flying/jump requirement limits the
  effective period of an AO. AFI 11-421 is the governing directive for preparing AOs.
     1.12.3.1. AOs that establish an aviation service period for rated officers (except flight
     surgeons and officers in training leading to the award of an aeronautical rating) will
     normally contain a termination date of the next aviation career phase point (gate),
     regardless of Date Of Separation (DOS), Date of Estimated Return from Overseas
     (DEROS), or retirement. Unless disqualified from aviation service, the AO termination
     date for rated officers will normally be the effective date the officer will accrue 12, 18, 22
     or 25 years of aviation service. Flying incentive pay entitlement continues providing the
     member remains in continuous incentive pay status; this pay terminates on the last
     effective date of the AO when changing from continuous to conditional incentive pay
     status.
         1.12.3.1.1. When a rated officer’s incentive pay status changes from continuous to
         conditional, flying incentive pay will restart when the member qualifies for
         entitlement to conditional incentive pay using hours flown from the effective date of
         the conditional status AO forward (if otherwise qualified). For an actively flying
         rated officer with longer than 25 years of aviation service, the termination date of the
         AO will be the earliest known termination date, such as projected termination of
         assignment, or retirement date. These members are placed in conditional incentive
         pay status.
     1.12.3.2. AOs that establish an aviation service period for CEAs will normally contain a
     termination date of the next aviation career phase point (gate), regardless of DOS,
     Expiration Term of Service (ETS), or retirement. Unless the member is disqualified from
     aviation service, the AO termination date for a CEA will normally be the effective date
     the crewmember will accrue 10, 15, 20, or 25 years of aviation service. Flying incentive
     pay continues providing the member remains in continuous incentive pay status; this pay
     terminates on the last effective date of the AO when changing from continuous to
     conditional incentive pay status.
         1.12.3.2.1. When a CEA’s pay status changes from continuous to conditional, flying
         incentive pay restarts when the member qualifies for entitlement to conditional
         incentive pay using hours flown from the effective date of the conditional status AO
         forward (if otherwise qualified). For CEAs actively flying with longer than 25 years
         of aviation service, the termination date of the AO will be the DOS. These members
         are placed in conditional incentive pay status.
     1.12.3.3. For non-CEA enlisted aircrew members, the AO termination date will reflect
     the DOS. Terminate AOs IAW AFI 11-421 effective the date of flying tour completion,
     change in status to inactive status (e.g., FSC “J” or “L”), the date member is
     suspended/disqualified from aviation service, or DOS (whichever is earliest). If the
     member re-enlists without incurring a break in service, publish an AO to change the
     termination date to the new DOS (no change to effective date). Flying incentive pay
     terminates on the last effective date of the AO (if otherwise qualified), unless a new AO
AFI11-402_AFSOCSUP 12 JUNE 2012                                                              17


     will be published for continued aviation service with no change to effective date of the
     AO.
     1.12.3.4. For non-rated officers, the AO termination date will be the DOS, if known. If
     the DOS is not known, the effective period of the AO will not exceed three years. If the
     member is notified of a follow-on flying assignment, or continues in the current flying
     assignment for more than three years, the HARM office will publish an AO to change the
     termination date to reflect the DOS or an additional three-year period, whichever is
     earlier. Flying incentive pay terminates on the last effective date of the AO (if otherwise
     qualified), unless a new AO will be published for continued aviation service with no
     change to effective date of the AO.
     1.12.3.5. For parachutist members, (jump inherent UMD DAFSCs IAW AFI 11-410 or
     “J” prefixed DAFSC positions) the AO termination date will be the DOS or jump tour
     completion date, if known. Terminate AOs IAW AFI 11-421 effective the date of jump
     tour completion, change in status to inactive status (e.g., FSC “06”), date member is
     suspended/disqualified from parachutist status, or DOS, whichever is earliest. If the
     member re-enlists without incurring a break in service, publish an AO to change the
     termination date to the new DOS (no change to the effective date). If the member is
     notified of a follow-on jump assignment, change the termination date to reflect the
     follow-on assignment jump tour completion date. Jump incentive pay terminates on the
     last effective date of the AO (if otherwise qualified), unless a new AO will be published
     for continued parachutist service with no change to effective date of the AO
     (reenlistments or Permanent Change of Station [PCS] to another parachutist assignment).
        1.12.3.5.1. For a rated officer, CEA, non-rated officer, or non-CEA enlisted member
        assigned to a "J" prefixed DAFSC position on the UMD, the termination date of the
        jump AO is the date the member is no longer assigned to the "J" prefixed position.
        For members approved for temporary jump status, the AO terminates when the jump
        requirement ends IAW AFI 11-410. Include in the jump request letter the duration for
        temporary jump status with full justification. (See AFI 11-410 for maximum time
        allowed in temporary jump status). Example: Member is authorized temporary jump
        status from 1 Apr through 31 May to help with a Joint Readiness exercise. The AO
        authorizing temporary jump status will terminate 31 May. Jump incentive pay
        terminates on the last effective date of the AO (if otherwise qualified).
            1.12.3.5.1.1. For rated officers and CEAs approved for jump status, the AO will
            reflect the termination date of jump status; however, ARMS will reflect the next
            aviation phase point (gate) as the termination date of aviation status. HARM
            offices may publish an AF Form 1887, Aeronautical Order (PA) Aviation Service
            to place rated officers or CEAs on jump status in lieu of an ARMS generated AO
            to prevent changing flying anniversary termination dates in ARMS. Jump
            incentive pay terminates on the last effective date of the AO (if otherwise
            qualified), unless a new AO will be published for continued parachutist service
            with no change to effective date of the AO (reenlistments or PCS to another
            parachutist flying assignment).
        1.12.3.5.2. For nonrated or non-CEA aircrew members assigned to a unit without an
        open flying billet ("X", “K”, or “Q” prefixed DAFSC position on the UMD) due to
18                                                   AFI11-402_AFSOCSUP 12 JUNE 2012


        unit exceeding total nonrated or non-CEA aircrew member authorizations, the active
        AO will terminate on the last day of the formal school (for initial training or TDY),
        the day after departed last duty station (for PCS assignment), or the day before
        effective date of duty (for Permanent Change of Assignment [PCA]). Flight incentive
        pay terminates effective the last day of the active AO (if otherwise qualified). In the
        case of excess manning, unless a waiver is approved by MAJCOM/A3 the HARM
        office will publish an AO terminating flying duties for the excess member(s) IAW
        AFI 11-421 and this instruction.
        1.12.3.5.3. For parachutists ("J" coded DAFSC, or jump inherent DAFSC IAW AFI
        11-410) assigned to an operational unit without an open parachutist billet due to the
        unit exceeding total jump authorizations, the active AO will not be effective past the
        last date of jump school (for initial training or TDY), the day after departed last duty
        station (for PCS assignment), or the day before effective date of duty (for PCA).
        Jump incentive pay terminates on the last effective date of the active AO (if otherwise
        qualified). In the case of excess manning, unless AF/A3O approves a waiver the
        HARM office will publish an AO terminating flying/parachutist duties for the excess
        member(s) IAW AFI 11-421.
     1.12.3.6. For civilian government employees, the AO termination date will not exceed
     five years. If the member continues in the current flying assignment for more than five
     years, the HARM office will publish an AO to change the termination date to reflect an
     additional three-year period. Flying incentive pay is not authorized.
     1.12.3.7. The HARM office will terminate AOs published for operational support fliers
     effective the last day of each month, when the flying requirement no longer exists (if less
     than a month), or when man-months are no longer available, whichever occurs first.
     1.12.3.8. Publish AOs as quickly as possible when an effective period changes. When a
     member arrives at a base via PCS action, the gaining HARM office will validate the AO
     against authorized UMD data for the position number assigned to the member.
        1.12.3.8.1. IAW AFI 11-401 units may allow double-billeting of rated staff, flight
        surgeon, or CEA staff positions for up to 30 days only when there is an overlap
        during replacement of the incumbent member. Unless waived, the unit commander
        will direct the servicing HARM office to terminate the active flying AO of one of the
        members effective the 31st day of overlap. NOTE: HARM offices will publish an
        AO assigning FSC “H” and an inactive FAC 7 to the additional incumbent(s) IAW
        AFI 11-401.
        1.12.3.8.2. The total number of non-rated officers or non-CEA aircrew on active AOs
        may exceed the number of UMD authorizations for up to 90 days when the overage is
        caused by PCS or PCA actions. Unless waived, the commander will identify the
        members to be removed from active flying status to bring the unit in line with the
        number of UMD authorizations. HARM offices will terminate the active AOs for the
        newly arrived members effective the 91st day of the overage to bring the unit in line
        with the number of UMD authorizations. NOTE: HARM offices will publish an AO
        assigning FSC “H” and an inactive FAC 7 to the additional incumbent(s) IAW AFI
        11-421.
AFI11-402_AFSOCSUP 12 JUNE 2012                                                                    19


          1.12.3.8.3. The total number of parachutists on active AOs may exceed the number
          of UMD authorizations for up to 90 days when the overage is caused by formal jump
          school attendance, PCS or PCA actions. For parachutists only, officers may fill
          enlisted billets and enlisted personnel may fill officer billets when performing similar
          duties (e.g., an Intel officer can fill a vacant Intel enlisted position). When all enlisted
          and officer jump billets are filled, however, the 90-day overage period begins. Unless
          waived, the commander will identify the members to be removed from active jump
          status to bring the unit in line with the number of UMD authorizations. NOTE:
          HARM offices will publish an AO assigning ASC “06” to the additional
          incumbent(s).
       1.12.3.9. Should circumstances require involuntary termination of aviation/parachutist
       service (other than suspension or disqualification) earlier than specified in the order, give
       the member as much advance notice as possible before termination. When the AO is no
       longer effective (expires), the member’s aviation/parachutist service ends and entitlement
       to flying/parachutist incentive pay terminates. The HARM office will publish an MPO to
       stop incentive pay effective the termination date of the AO that originally authorized
       flying/jump status (or earlier if qualification for incentive pay ended on an earlier date).
1.13. Disqualification/Requalification        Aviation/Parachutist        Packages. Squadron
commanders will submit disqualification/requalification aviation/parachutist packages to the
MAJCOM ARM Functional Manager for staffing to MAJCOM/A3T/A3 and AF/A3O-AT as
applicable. (See also paragraphs 3.7 and 7.8). With the exception of voluntary requests, all
disqualification actions require review by the base legal office prior to forwarding to the
MAJCOM. Requalification packages require legal review only when the requalification process
requires appearance before a FEB. For disqualification actions, commanders will direct the base
HARM office to publish the suspension AO and terminate flight or jump pay accordingly.
Include the suspension AO in the disqualification package. If final disqualification action was
not accomplished prior to separation, retirement or PCS, commanders will ensure this action is
completed as soon as possible. See also paragraph 1.4.1.1. NOTE: A member who separated
from military service in suspended status must apply for requalification of AOs if requesting
return to aviation status. Do not revoke the suspension AO. Revalidation AOs are effective
from the date of assignment forward or when the member satisfies qualification requirements,
whichever occurs last.
   1.13.1. As a minimum, a disqualification package will contain the commander’s notification
   letter, justification for disqualification action, ARMS IDS, FHR and/or JHR (as applicable),
   Individual Training Summary (ITS), the suspension AO, and AF Form 1042, Medical
   Recommendation for Flying or Special Operational Duty.
   1.13.1. (AFSOC) Commanders will coordinate all disqualification packages through the
   unit SARM office and the servicing HARM office before submitting to HQ AFSOC/A3TR
   for further processing, coordination, and final approval. Packages received without SARM
   or HARM office coordination will be returned for coordination. (T-2)
       1.13.1.1. (Added-AFSOC) Commanders will coordinate recommendations for Flying
       Evaluation Board (FEB) action (including FEB waiver and Voluntary Disqualification
       from Aviation Service in Lieu of FEB [VILO]) through the unit SARM office and
       servicing HARM office before submitting to the FEB convening authority. SARM and

      HARM office coordination ensures required Aviation Resource Management (ARM)
      actions are taken and the appropriate ARMS documentation is included in the staff
      package. Refer to Chapter 4 in this supplement. (T-2)
   1.13.2. As a minimum, a requalification package will contain the commander’s notification
   letter (Attachment 6), justification for requalification action, member’s application letter (if
   applicable), ARMS IDS, FHR and/or JHR (as applicable), ITS, the suspension AO (if
   applicable) and disqualification AO, and an AF Form 1042 documenting completion of a
   current flight physical.
   1.13.2. (AFSOC) Commanders will coordinate all requalification and revalidation packages
   through the unit SARM office and the servicing HARM office before reaching HQ
   AFSOC/A3TR for further processing, coordination, and final approval. Packages received
   without SARM or HARM office coordination will be returned for coordination. (T-2)
1.14. Recommendations for Change. Submit proposed changes to this instruction via AF

                                            Chapter 2

                       US AIR FORCE AERONAUTICAL RATINGS

2.1. Determining and Revoking Ratings. The Chief of Staff, USAF, determines Aeronautical
Ratings. AF/A3O and MAJCOM commanders may revoke a specific rating from an individual
when the requirement for an aviation service career no longer exists. This chapter establishes
USAF procedures regarding aeronautical ratings.
2.2. Applicable to Whom. Rated policy applies to USAF officers on extended active duty and
USAF officers who are active members of the ARC.
   2.2.1. Under Title 10, U.S.C. 8691, the USAF may award aeronautical ratings to USAF
   commissioned officers only (exceptions are noted in Chapter 7). The following are the
   USAF aeronautical ratings:
       2.2.1.1. Pilot, Senior Pilot, Command Pilot.
       2.2.1.2. RPA Pilot, Senior RPA Pilot, Command RPA Pilot.
       2.2.1.3. Combat Systems Officer (CSO), Senior Combat Systems Officer, Master
       Combat Systems Officer. Note: Proceeding references to “CSO” includes individuals
       previously awarded the “Navigator” rating.
       2.2.1.4. Navigator, Senior Navigator, Master Navigator.
       2.2.1.5. Air Battle Manager (ABM), Senior Air Battle Manager, Master Air Battle
       Manager.
       2.2.1.6. Observer, Senior Observer, Master Observer.
       2.2.1.7. Flight Surgeon, Senior Flight Surgeon, Chief Flight Surgeon.
   2.2.2. The Chief of Staff, USAF, awards the Astronaut qualifier. Prepare an application
   according to Attachment 2. Submit the application through MAJCOM channels to AF/A3O-
   AT, 1480 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC, 20330-1480 with a copy of the member's
   current AO. AF/A3O-AT will review the application and publish the DAF AO awarding the
   Astronaut qualifier.
   2.2.3. An individual must meet all eligibility requirements IAW Table 2.1 of this instruction
   before award of an aeronautical rating. Waivers to award criteria are not considered
   appropriate.
   2.2.4. The AF awards the basic rating to a member who completed a specific course of
   training leading to professional qualification in primary aviation skills. This rating signifies a
   commitment to a career in aviation service. The AF awards advanced ratings to members
   who attain a specific flying experience level.
2.3. Eligibility for Award of USAF Ratings. A USAF officer who completes USAF formal
UFT or AF designated equivalent training, is eligible for a USAF rating.
   2.3.1. An Air Force officer who completed comparable training as a member of another US
   military service and holds an aviation designation comparable to the USAF rating may be
   eligible for the equivalent USAF rating.
 22                                                  AFI11-402_AFSOCSUP 12 JUNE 2012


      2.3.1.1. Former non-USAF helicopter-only pilots may be awarded the USAF pilot rating
      (helicopter only). Helicopter pilots who have not completed USAF/USN Primary fixed
      wing training (T37/T-34/T-6) will complete all phases of fixed wing qualifications prior
      to assignment to fixed wing aircraft duties. Waiver authority is HQ AETC/A2/3/10.
      NOTE: Publish an AF Form 1887 to award fixed wing qualification to all helicopter-
      only pilots effective on the graduation date from fixed-wing qualification. The original
      DAF AO rating date will not change in ARMS.
      2.3.1.2. Former Navy or Marine Corps Flight Officers who completed basic Naval Flight
      Officer (NFO) training and were qualified in an operational weapon system aircraft may
      apply for the USAF CSO rating (Refer to Attachment 3).
      2.3.1.3. A USAF Medical Corps officer who completed comparable training as a
      member of another US military service and holds an aviation designation comparable to
      the USAF flight surgeon rating may apply for the USAF flight surgeon rating.
   2.3.2. A USAF rated officer qualified to perform duties in space (50 miles above the earth's
   surface) who completes a minimum of one operational mission is eligible for the astronaut
   qualifier (pilot astronaut, CSO astronaut, observer astronaut, ABM astronaut, and flight
   surgeon astronaut,). (See Attachment 2).
2.4. Authority to Award Ratings.
   2.4.1. The Commander, Air Education and Training Command (AETC), awards the basic
   pilot, and CSO rating to USAF officers who complete UFT. Authority may be delegated to
   commanders of AETC flying training wings.
   2.4.2. The Commander, Air Combat Command (ACC), awards the basic RPA pilot rating to
   USAF officers who complete RPA FTU in conjunction with Undergraduate RPA Training
   (URT). Authority may be delegated to the wing commanders. Exception: The Commander,
   Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC), awards the basic RPA pilot rating to USAF officers
   who complete RPA FTU in conjunction with URT at March AFB. Authority may be
   delegated to the wing commanders.
   2.4.3. The Commander, Air Education and Training Command (AETC), authorizes the
   award of the basic ABM rating to USAF officers who complete UFT. Authority maybe
   delegated to commanders of the Air Control Wings. Exception: Award the ABM rating
   only to ARC officers who complete UFT and are immediately assigned to active flying
   positions in the 116 Air Control Wing, 513 Air Control Group or units approved by AF/A3O-
   AT.
   2.4.4. The senior Air Force Officer, National Aeronautics and Space Administration
   (NASA), awards the basic observer rating to individuals who complete initial NASA Mission
   Specialist training.
   2.4.5. The Commander, USAF School of Aerospace Medicine (USAF SAM/CC), awards the
   flight surgeon rating to Medical Corps officers who complete the Aerospace Medicine
   Primary Course. When approved, flight surgeons holding an additional rating as a USAF
   pilot may hold a dual rating as a USAF pilot-physician. (See AFI 11-405, The Pilot-
   Physician Program).
AFI11-402_AFSOCSUP 12 JUNE 2012                                                                23


2.5. Advanced Ratings. Award advanced ratings to identify specific levels of flying experience
within each rated specialty. For an advanced rating, a USAF officer must:
   2.5.1. Be qualified for USAF aviation service, have an active or inactive FSC (will not be
   separated, suspended, or disqualified from aviation service), or be considered a rated asset in
   the ARC (Air Reserve Component, consisting of the Air National Guard [ANG] and the Air
   Force Reserve Command [AFRC]) and;
   2.5.2. Have been awarded the previous level of rating. Example: Awarded basic flight
   surgeon rating before being eligible for award of the senior flight surgeon rating, and;
   2.5.3. Meet the eligibility requirements in Table 2.1 NOTE: An officer is eligible for an
   advanced rating in the most recent specialty only, e.g. a pilot formerly qualified as a CSO is
   not eligible for an advanced CSO rating. Flight surgeons who perform as pilot-physicians are
   eligible for advanced ratings as both flight surgeons and pilots.
2.6. Total Rated Service, Flying Time, and OFDA for Advanced Ratings. This section
pertains to eligibility criteria in Table 2.1
   2.6.1. Total Rated Service. Compute years of rated service from the date the officer
   received the basic USAF rating. Do not include breaks in military service or any time the
   officer was suspended (except ASC 02 and 07), disqualified, resigned, separated, or was
   relieved of his or her commission. Exception: Prior to 1 August 2002, breaks in service did
   count towards rated service providing the member was not relieved of his or her commission
   and was not disqualified from aviation service. NOTE: Before 1 August 02, breaks in
   military service were included when computing years of rated service. Effective 1 August 02,
   breaks in military service were no longer included when computing years of rated service.
   Therefore, total rated service for an advanced badge with an effective date on or after 1
   August 02 will not include a previous break in rated service. Do not adjust an advanced
   rating with an effective date before 1 August 02 that included breaks in military service.
       2.6.1.1. Officers with previous US military rated or designated service must qualify for a
       basic USAF rating before they can qualify for an advanced USAF rating. Once awarded a
       basic USAF rating, all pre-USAF military rated or designated service is creditable
       toward an advanced USAF rating.
       2.6.1.2. For a flight surgeon designated as a flight medical officer under previous
       editions of AFR 60-13, Aviation Service, Aeronautical Ratings, and Badges, compute
       total rated service from the date the officer was designated a flight medical officer.
   2.6.2. Flying Time and OFDA. Military flying time logged (including UFT student time)
   and OFDA months (including OFDA months accumulated in training for the specialty
   before award of the USAF basic rating) are creditable toward award of an advanced rating in
   that specialty.
       2.6.2.1. Do not credit flying time and OFDA accumulated in one specialty toward an
       advanced rating in another specialty. NOTE: See paragraph 2.6.2.7 for exception
       regarding pilot-physicians.
       2.6.2.2. Do not credit cadet flying time accrued at the USAF Academy (USAFA).
       USAFA cadet flying time is not creditable towards military flying time. Therefore, this
 24                                                   AFI11-402_AFSOCSUP 12 JUNE 2012


       time is not included in an aircrew member’s flying history and will not be input into an
       operational ARMS database.
       2.6.2.3. Do not substitute months of flying duty accrued before 1 Apr 76 for flying time
       for the purpose of retroactive award of advanced ratings.
       2.6.2.4. If two members are double-billeted against the same flight surgeon or rated staff
       (API 5, 6, or 8) manpower authorization, only one member may accumulate OFDA
       (except for PCA/PCS actions for the periods listed in this instruction and AFI 11-401).
       See AFI 11-401 for waiver procedures.
       2.6.2.5. HARM offices will establish procedures to validate only flying time and OFDA
       obtained in the current rated specialty are used to award advanced ratings in that
       specialty. (NOTE: See paragraph 2.6.2.7 for exception regarding pilot-physicians).
       Additionally, HARM offices will consult the AFI (or Air Force Regulation [AFR]) that
       pertained to the effective period of the AO) to validate the member satisfied requirements
       before awarding a retroactive advanced rating. MAJCOMs or AF/A3O-AT have
       previous versions of applicable publications on file.
       2.6.2.6. By law, do not credit OFDA months accumulated past the 18th year of aviation
       service toward entitlement to continuous Aviation Career Incentive Pay (ACIP). Officers
       may, however, continue to accumulate OFDA months based on badge-creditable months
       earned beyond the 18th year of aviation service to apply toward award of an advanced
       rating. To earn badge-creditable months following the 18th year of aviation service, a
       member must occupy an active flying position for at least 15 days in a given calendar
       month and perform OFDA-creditable flying duties that satisfy conditional ACIP
       requirements IAW DoD FMR, Volume 7A, regardless of the current incentive pay
       entitlement status of the individual.
          2.6.2.6.1. Indoctrination flyers do not receive OFDA credit. Hours flown in this
          status and in the member’s specialty, however, count towards the total flying hours
          requirement for an advanced rating in that specialty.
       2.6.2.7. Flight surgeons are not entitled to continuous ACIP and do not accumulate
       OFDA months for incentive pay entitlement purposes. These members may credit months
       of flying duty performed while occupying an API-5 position towards advanced flight
       surgeon ratings, providing the hours flown satisfied conditional ACIP requirements IAW
       DoD FMR, Volume 7A, Chapter 22. Pilot-physicians may credit pilot time logged while
       assigned to a pilot-physician position towards advanced pilot and flight surgeon ratings;
       flight surgeon time, however, may be applied only toward advanced flight surgeon
       ratings (see paragraph 2.13).
       2.6.2.8. ABMs in authorized 13BXX positions on or after 1 Oct 99 and previously
       awarded non-rated officer aircrew member badges are considered rated if they attended a
       Programmed Flying Training (PFT) course that led to the aeronautical rating at one of the
       following Formal Training Units (FTU): Tinker AFB (AWACS), Geilenkirchen AB
       (NATO AWACS), Keesler AFB or Davis-Monthan AFB (ABCCC), or Robins AFB
       (Joint STARS).
2.7. Publication of the AO for Ratings. The servicing HARM office that maintains an officer's
FRF publishes AOs to award basic ratings and updates advanced ratings in ARMS. The remarks
AFI11-402_AFSOCSUP 12 JUNE 2012                                                                25


section of each published AO must contain the specific criteria in Table 2.1 that the individual
satisfied for award of a basic rating.
   2.7.1. Effective date of AO for Basic Rating. The effective date to award the basic USAF
   rating to Air Force Pilots, CSOs, and ABMs is the graduation date of USAF UFT. For RPA
   Pilot rating, award the basic USAF rating on the graduation date of the RPA FTU. For Inter-
   service transfers, AF/A3O-AT awards the basic USAF rating effective the date the officer is
   assigned to active rated duties (if otherwise qualified).
   2.7.2. Effective Date of Awarding an Advanced Rating. The local HARM office will
   award an advanced rating effective the date a member satisfies requirements listed in Table
   2.1 If the member has more than 18 years of aviation service, the HARM office will
   manually calculate badge-creditable months and/or review the FHR and IFR to verify
   when/if the officer met eligibility criteria, and the effective date is the date the member met
   eligibility requirements.
       2.7.2.1. Officers must be awarded previous rating(s) in a specialty prior to award of a
       more advanced rating in the same specialty.
2.8. Inter-Service Transfers of Naval Flight Officers and All Medical Officers. Award of
the USAF CSO rating to former Navy or Marine Corps Flight Officers is authorized to
individuals who completed basic Naval Flight Officer training and were qualified in an
operational weapon system aircraft. Individuals awarded the Naval Flight Officer rating may
request publication of an AO to award the USAF CSO rating. Cite this paragraph as the authority
for the award.
   2.8.1. An officer of the USAF Medical Corps who completed comparable training as a
   member of another US military service and holds an aviation designation comparable to the
   USAF flight surgeon rating is eligible for the USAF flight surgeon rating. The USAF
   Surgeon General is the approval authority for this action. This action does not require an
   Aeronautical Rating Board (ARB).
       2.8.1.1. Submit an application letter through command medical channels to HQ
       AFMSA/SG3PF, 1500 Wilson Blvd, Suite 1200, Arlington, VA 22209. Include all
       records pertinent to establishing professional qualification as a USAF flight surgeon.
       2.8.1.2. After certifying professional qualification, HQ AFMSA/SG3PF will forward the
       approved application to AF/A3O-AT for publication of a DAF AO to award the rating.
       AF/A3O-AT will forward a copy of the DAF AO awarding the rating to the MAJCOM
       and gaining HARM office. The MAJCOM will forward a copy of the member’s ARB
       application (with supporting documentation) to the gaining HARM office. Use the same
       process in paragraph 2.14.1 for including other US military hours and computing
       advanced ratings (if applicable). NOTE: DAF AOs may be published for rated members
       of the ANG that have been extended temporary federal recognition.
2.9. Application to Appear Before an ARB. Applicants for USAF aeronautical ratings must
submit a request to the gaining commander or the designated convening authority for inter-
service transfers. Use the format in Attachment 3. NOTE: Applicants will not perform in-flight
duties on USAF aircraft nor be assigned to a non-flying rated position until completion of the
ARB and publication of the DAF Special Order (SO) or appointment order assigning the member
to a rated position. The DAF AO (CSAF awarding Air Force Rating), and the AO establishing
 26                                                    AFI11-402_AFSOCSUP 12 JUNE 2012


the member’s aviation service code and FAC to initiate aviation service will be effective the date
assigned to a rated position.
2.10. Reviewing ARB Applications. The commander with convening authority reviews an
individual's request for an ARB to determine if a board should be convened. The following
guidance applies:
   2.10.1. Unless waived by AF/A3O-AT, individuals must meet the requirements in Chapter
   7.
   2.10.2. If a rated vacancy exists and the applicant is qualified for assignment to the vacancy
   IAW 11-412, the ARB (or convening authority) recommends award of the basic AF rating
   and forwards the application package to MAJCOM/A3 for approval. Upon approval,
   AF/A3O-AT will award the rating effective the date the officer is commissioned and
   assigned to a rated manpower position. If a rated vacancy does not exist or the applicant is
   not qualified for assignment to a rated position, deny the application and advise the applicant
   that he or she may resubmit the application at a later date.
       2.10.2.1. For Officer Training School (OTS) or Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC)
       cadets, the gaining MAJCOM is HQ AETC. For other applicants, it is the MAJCOM of
       the servicing MPF. For the purpose of this instruction, the National Guard Bureau (NGB)
       is a MAJCOM.
   2.10.3. Qualified helicopter-only pilot applicants. MAJCOMs may hire pilots with a
   restricted aeronautical order/rating (Helicopter Only) to: (1) fly helicopters or CV-22 only;
   (2) complete applicable qualification requirements for assignment to a Remotely Piloted
   Aircraft (RPA) unit; (3) complete applicable fixed-wing qualification requirements for
   assignment to an operational fixed-wing unit or; (4) fill a non-flying rated position based
   upon the applicant’s qualifications. A helicopter-only pilot applicant: Note: “Applicable
   qualification requirements for assignment to a remotely piloted aircraft unit” permits
   helicopter-only pilot to proceed directly to RPA FTU without attending SUPT or a fixed-
   wing qualification course. The officer will retain their “helicopter-only pilot” rating and will
   not be permitted to fly non-RPA fixed-wing aircraft without first attending SUPT or a fixed-
   wing qualification course. The helicopter-only members who fly the CV-22 will retain their
   “helicopter-only pilot” rating and will not be permitted to fly non-RPA fixed-wing aircraft
   without first attending SUPT or a FWQ course.
       2.10.3.1. Must have completed a course comparable to USAF SUPT, Phase 3 in a
       helicopter.
       2.10.3.2. Must acknowledge in writing, if approved by an ARB, he or she will be
       awarded a pilot rating with helicopter-only restriction and understands the assignment
       limitations associated with the restrictions. If the ARB does not award the rating, the
       member may be eligible to attend USAF SUPT at the unit's discretion.
           2.10.3.2.1. Although helicopter-only qualified pilots are awarded a helicopter-only
           rating, this will be the original rating date and remains unchanged for advanced
           ratings. The original rating date is the date of the sister-service rating.
               2.10.3.2.1.1. If the ARB approves award of the helicopter-only rating for initial
               assignment to a fixed wing aircraft flying position, the rating will be revoked and
AFI11-402_AFSOCSUP 12 JUNE 2012                                                               27


              flight incentive pay terminated only if the member is disqualified from USAF
              UPT or FWQ as the result of a Flying Evaluation Board (FEB) proceeding.
              2.10.3.2.1.2. If the member is awarded a helicopter-only rating for initial
              assignment to a helicopter-only position but later attends USAF UPT or FWQ for
              a fixed wing assignment and is disqualified from USAF UPT or FWQ, the FEB
              may recommend the member retain the helicopter-only rating and return to a
              helicopter flying assignment in lieu of permanent disqualification IAW Chapter
              4.
              2.10.3.2.1.3. Do not revoke a rating awarded by an ARB unless as the result of a
              FEB action. Do not adjust the original rating date for officers who completed
              fixed-wing qualification training and are awarded an unrestricted pilot rating. The
              AO remarks will reflect current rating type IAW AFI 11-401.
      2.10.3.3. Must be scheduled for commissioning and entry to active duty within 12
      months of application if enrolled in OTS or ROTC.
      2.10.3.4. Must understand a USAF rating qualifies him or her for all flying duties
      required of a USAF rated officer with comparable experience.
   2.10.4. An applicant disenrolled or eliminated from UFT is not eligible to appear before an
   ARB or request waiver of an ARB. In this case, assign ASC 06 if applicant is not currently a
   rated officer in the USAF.
2.11. ARB Procedures:
   2.11.1. The MAJCOM commander or MAJCOM-designated subordinate unit commander
   appoints the convening authority and convenes an ARB. Cite this paragraph as authority
   when publishing orders appointing and convening the board. Procuring commands will
   arrange for necessary support when board members and/or administrative support are not
   available to a local commander.
   2.11.1. (AFSOC) Aviation Review Board (ARB) convening authority is delegated to the
   flying wing commander of a base (or equivalent [above group level]), regardless of
   command. Note: For a tenant flying unit (including Direct Reporting Unit [DRU] or Field
   Operating Agency [FOA] of a higher headquarters without a flying wing commander in the
   chain of command, the commander of the host flying wing located on the same installation
   will serve as the convening authority. Refer to paragraph 2.14., in this supplement for
   guidance on inter-service transfers. (T-1)
   2.11.2. Conduct the board according to procedures for a FEB (See Chapter 4).
   2.11.3. Board members will be rated officers currently assigned to active flying duty and
   will include at least one officer familiar with the rated duties in question. A board convened
   to consider the qualification of an applicant to be assigned to non-extended active duty (non-
   EAD) will be composed of non-EAD officers.
   2.11.4. The ARB examines flying training, experience, and qualifications to determine if the
   applicant has rated potential comparable to a USAF rated officer.
   2.11.5. All documents required by Attachment 3 are mandatory exhibits. The board
   president may request additional documentation from the applicant.

   2.11.6. The board will consider: the applicant's age and grade, flying training and
   operational experience, currency of flying experience, the availability of required upgrade or
   requalification training, the applicant's entire flying history to include specific references to
   an aircraft accident, projected flying assignments, and rated potential. The verbatim transcript
   will provide clear, logical support for the findings and recommendation.
   2.11.7. The board advises the applicant, performs inquiries, finds facts, and makes a
   recommendation. Intermediate commanders review the report, indicate concurrence or non-
   concurrence with the board’s recommendation, and forward the case file to the
   MAJCOM/A3 for final approval. Once approved, the MAJCOM/A3 will request AF/A3O-
   AT publish a DAF AO to award the rating.
   2.11.8. The ARB will limit its recommendation to whether or not to award the USAF rating.
   2.11.9. Dispose of the report of proceedings according to the Air Force Records Disposition
   Schedule.
2.12. ARB Waivers. An applicant may request waiver of appearance before an ARB if he or
she submits documentation showing completion of training that is equivalent to USAF UFT and
satisfies the requirements of paragraph 2.14.1. The applicant must have been in a military
aviation status within eight years of the date of the request. If the applicant and/or appropriate
commanders do not provide sufficient information, or do not include required exhibits, deny the
request for waiver and return the application. Process requests for ARB appearance waivers as
follows:
   2.12.1. The applicant submits a request for waiver of appearance before an ARB to the
   commander authorized to convene the board (Attachment 3).
   2.12.2. The commander appoints a USAF rated officer to review the request. The reviewing
   officer should be in the same rated specialty and be senior in rank to the applicant.
   2.12.3. The reviewing officer reviews the application and interviews the applicant using
   guidelines in paragraph 2.11 Following the interview, the reviewing officer provides a
   written synopsis of the applicant's qualifications and makes a recommendation to the
   convening authority. The convening authority adds his or her recommendation and forwards
   the request through channels to the MAJCOM/A3 for approval. Once approved, the
   MAJCOM/A3 will request AF/A3O-AT publish a DAF AO to award the rating.
2.13. Pilot-Physicians. Flight surgeons who also perform duties as pilot-physicians are eligible
for advanced ratings both as flight surgeons and pilots. They may apply any USAF pilot years of
aviation service, OFDA, and flying hours accrued before attaining flight surgeon status toward
advanced pilot ratings only. After attaining pilot-physician status, all hours flown as a pilot, and
badge-creditable months accrued as a pilot, will be "dual-credited" toward advanced pilot and
flight surgeon ratings as long as the member is on AOs as an active pilot-physician (assigned to a
FAC 9 position). Hours flown as a flight surgeon, however, will be applied towards advanced
flight surgeon ratings only. Note: To earn badge-creditable months toward an advanced pilot
rating, a pilot-physician must be assigned to an active flying position for at least 15 days in a
given month and perform OFDA-creditable flying duties as a pilot that satisfy conditional ACIP
entitlement requirements IAW DoD FMR, Volume 7A, Chapter 22.
AFI11-402_AFSOCSUP 12 JUNE 2012                                                                     29


2.14. Training with Other than USAF Units. A USAF officer or an individual completing a
commissioning program who also completed flying training conducted by another US military
service and holds a military aviation designation comparable to the USAF pilot, RPA pilot, CSO,
or ABM rating may apply for the basic USAF rating in that respective specialty. Except for flight
surgeons, an ARB will screen these applicants. (See Attachment 3).
2.14. (AFSOC)Training with Other than USAF Units. An individual approved for an inter-
service transfer to the Air Force, and not assigned or attached to an AFSOC unit (e.g., exchange
program), may submit a request through the unit commander directly to AFSOC/A3 for an ARB
waiver. Individuals assigned to an AFSOC unit will submit the request through their group
channels to AFSOC/A3. The request must contain information required in Attachment 3 of the
basic instruction. All requests must include servicing HARM office coordination on the SSS,
prior to convening authority review. The HARM office will ensure the ARB package meets the
requirements of the AFI. (T-1)
   2.14.1. The applicant must be available for assignment to operational flying duties and meet
   the mandatory requirements for award of aeronautical ratings listed in Table 2.1 (See also
   Chapter 7). If approved to receive the applicable AF rating, applicants must remain on
   active operational flying status for a minimum of one year before being assigned to an
   inactive API coded position.
       2.14.1.1. Use the following mandatory source documents to establish the USAF Aviation
       Service Date, previous ratings, OFDA, and flying hour experience in cases involving
       officers with previous US military rated service:
ARMY: Army Officer Record Brief with Aviation Service Entry Date (ASED – equivalent to
Aviation Service Date); official orders depicting aviation service authorized (equivalent to Air
Force aeronautical orders) to determine active and inactive periods; orders initiating or
terminating military service; current flying hour document, DD Form 214, Certificate of Release
or Discharge from Active Duty and the member’s application to appear before an ARB.
NAVY/MARINE CORPS/COAST GUARD: Naval Aviator Aviation Training Jacket
Summary Card with Primary Date Reported (equivalent to Aviation Service Date); official
orders depicting aviation service authorized (equivalent to Air Force aeronautical orders) to
determine active and inactive periods; orders initiating or terminating military service; current
flying hour document, DD Form 214, and the member’s application to appear before an ARB.
       2.14.1.2. MAJCOMs will forward to AF/A3O-AT a complete ARB package (including
       the documents listed above) with the MAJCOM request for award of the aeronautical
       rating.
   2.14.2. AF/A3O-AT will publish a DAF AO to award the basic USAF aeronautical rating
   and qualify the applicant for aviation service. The DAF AO awarding the rating is effective
   the date the officer is assigned to rated duty per the DAF Special Order (SO). AF/A3O-AT
   will forward a copy of the DAF AO awarding the rating to the MAJCOM and gaining
   HARM office. The MAJCOM will forward a copy of the member’s ARB application (with
   supporting documentation) to the gaining HARM office. (See Attachment 3)
   2.14.3. HARM office actions.

      2.14.3.1. HARM offices must receive the DAF SO, DAF AO that awarded the rating,
      and a copy of the ARB application prior to publishing an AO to assign the applicable
      ASC and FAC. The DAF AO and ARB application become a permanent part of the FRF.
      NOTE: The flying unit will not schedule a member for formal flying training or to
      perform flight duties until the servicing HARM office publishes the AO authorizing
      aviation service.
      2.14.3.2. Use the ARB application (Attachment 3) to establish the periods of inactive
      and active flying to calculate OFDA months for update in ARMS. Document previous
      military active/ inactive periods on the AF Form 142, Aviation Service Audit Worksheet.
      2.14.3.3. Use the DAF AO that awarded the AF basic rating to update ARMS. Use the
      previous service basic rating to update the other US military rating date and termination
      date (usually the DOS) to establish the eligibility date for advanced ratings. Publish
      advanced ratings if member satisfies criteria.
         2.14.3.3.1. Helicopter- only pilot officers initially hired for assignment to fixed wing
         aircraft, the basic pilot rating and AOs are contingent on completion of required
         USAF FWQ UPT training. Helicopter- only pilot officers may be initially hired to
         complete USAF RPA FTU for assignment to RPA duties.
             2.14.3.3.1.1. Effective date of advanced ratings. If the member satisfies eligibility
             criteria for the senior rating, use the day following award of the basic USAF
             rating as the earliest effective date for award of the senior rating. If the member is
             also qualified for the command rating, use the day after award of the senior rating
             as the earliest effective date for award of the command rating.

NOTES:
1. Only USAF commissioned officers may receive USAF ratings.
2. Compute years of rated service from the date the officer received the basic USAF rating (normally
graduation date of UFT). Do not include breaks in aviation service after 1 Aug 02. Breaks include periods
of suspensions (except ASC 02 and 07), disqualifications, separation, resignation, or relieved from
aviation service. See also paragraph 2.6.1.1.
3. Time logged in the specific aeronautical specialty only and student time logged in training leading to
award of the basic rating. For example, CSO or student CSO time does not count for advanced pilot
ratings.
4. OFDA credited after date of entry into training leading to the basic rating. For example, OFDA
credited as a CSO is not creditable toward advanced pilot ratings.
5. Rated officers with more than 18 years of aviation service and pilot-physicians may earn badge-
creditable months toward award of advanced ratings. These members must occupy an active flying
position for at least 15 days in a given month and perform OFDA-creditable flying duties that satisfy
conditional ACIP requirements IAW DoD FMR, Volume 7A, Chapter 22 and AFI 11-421. Additionally,
for pilot-physicians, use only flight time performed as a pilot to calculate badge-creditable months toward
advanced pilot ratings IAW paragraph 2.13. of this AFI.
6. Flight surgeons’ (API 5) must satisfy conditional ACIP requirements IAW DoD FMR, Volume 7A,
Chapter 22 in order to receive one month of OFDA credit.
7. When an AF member qualifies for the Astronaut qualifier, the Astronaut Qualifier symbol may be
worn (superimposed) on the rated badge they are eligible to wear. This is not a separate USAF rating.

8. Former Navy and Marine Corps Flight Officers who completed the basic NFO training and were
qualified in an operational weapon system aircraft may request award of the USAF CSO rating.
9. ABM’s will be rated when they complete the Undergraduate ABM Training course that leads to the
award of the aeronautical rating or designation (on or after 1 Apr 2010). Also reference paragraph
2.4.1.1.
10. ABMs in an authorized 13BXX position (on or after 1 Oct 99) previously awarded non-rated officer
aircrew member badges are considered rated if they attended a graduate level FTU course that led to the
ABM designation at one of the following FTUs: Tinker AFB (AWACS), Geilenkirchen AB (NATO
AWACS), Keesler AFB or Davis-Monthan AFB (ABCCC), Robins AFB (Joint STARS) or UABMT at
Tyndall AFB after 1 Apr 2010. For officers not yet awarded a nonrated officer aircrew member badge
who completed graduate level FTU course before 1 Oct 99, use the initial qualification check as the basic
rating date.
11. Grandfathering: For ABMs previously awarded the basic, senior, or master officer aircrew member
badge prior to 1 Oct 99, HARM offices will use the initial standard evaluation qualification check for
award of the basic ABM rating, and the same effective date of the nonrated advanced badge AOs to
update corresponding advanced rating (s) in ARMS. Maintain all nonrated and rated AOs in FRF.
12. The ASD, which determines continuous ACIP, will be based on the date the initial AO was published
IAW current directives at one of the FTUs. An ASD cannot be established until an officer qualified for
aviation service has been assigned to a formal flying course at one of the designated FTUs.
13. Rated members awarded the command/master/chief rating prior to 29 July 2003 are grandfathered
under previous criteria for award of advanced ratings.
14. Rated members awarded a senior rating prior to 29 July 2003 must accrue 144 months OFDA for the
command/master/chief rating when OFDA is used as the qualifying criteria for award of the advanced
rating.
15. All other rated members must accrue 72 months OFDA for the senior rating and 144 months OFDA
for award of the command/master/chief ratings, when OFDA is used as the qualifying criteria for award
of an advanced rating.
16. After 7/15 years of rated service, use the 16th of a month when meeting OFDA requirement (prior to
18 year gate) or date of flight when member reached hour milestone requirement for effective date of
AO.
17. Original rating date remains unchanged for a helicopter-only pilot, after attending USAF UPT or
FWQ for fixed-wing qualification.
18. RPA flying time may not be applied towards advanced ratings in a specific aircrew specialty;
however, OFDA accumulated as a RPA operator may be applied toward advanced ratings.
19. Astronaut space station time may not be applied towards advanced ratings in a specific aircrew
specialty; however, OFDA accumulated as an Astronaut may be applied toward advanced ratings.
20. The CSO rating is awarded to individuals who entered CSO UFT after 1 Oct 2004.

21. Navigators are not eligible for award of advanced CSO ratings.
22. Foreign flight surgeons that complete the Advanced Aerospace Medicine for International Medical
Officers Course (B3FAY9356) may be awarded the basic flight surgeon badge if not previously awarded.
23. Do not credit non-RPA Pilot flying time and OFDA accumulated in another rated specialty towards
advanced RPA ratings.

3.1. Purpose of Chapter. This chapter contains aviation service policies regarding rated
officers, CEAs and civilian employees performing duties as aircrew members. It establishes
procedures for entering rated/CEA aviation service, qualification for aviation service and flying
incentive pay, and disqualification, requalification, and termination of aviation service.
3.2. Applicable to Whom. These procedures apply to all USAF officers who hold a current
USAF aeronautical rating or are enrolled in Undergraduate Pilot, Remotely Piloted Aircraft
(RPA) Pilot, CSO, ABM, Flight Surgeon, Observer or training, and all CEA aircrew members
identified by AFSCs 1AXXX (Aircrew Operations career field) or 1UXXX (RPA Sensor
Operator (SO) career field) or other AFSCs approved for CEA aviation service by USAF/A3O-
AT and civilian government employees who fly USAF aircraft.
3.3. Procedures:
   3.3.1. To qualify for an aviation service career, an individual must maintain medical
   qualification, continue to develop professional skills, and demonstrate the potential for
   continued use as a rated/CEA asset. Career aviation service is a privilege, not a right.
   Personnel must be medically qualified IAW AFI 48-123, prior to AOs being
   published/effective. If required, the member will complete physiological training IAW AFI
   11-403 before performing flying duties.
   3.3.2. The USAF expects pilots to upgrade to aircraft commander or flight lead upon
   completion of sufficient training. There will be no career co-pilots or wingmen, unable or
   unwilling to upgrade.
   3.3.3. Enter an enlisted member into an aviation service career upon assignment to formal
   flying duty in the Airman Aircrew Operations career fields (1AXXX/1UXXX) or other
   AFSCs approved by USAF/A3O-AT.
   3.3.4. Rated officers, CEAs and civilian employees will maintain professional standards.
   3.3.5. The USAF considers rated officers and CEAs available for aircrew duties on a world-
   wide basis. This includes training for combat and actual combat. Any moral or ethical
   compunction, or personal or self-imposed reservation or qualification that limits worldwide
   availability renders an aircrew member incompatible with career aviation status. This
   includes attempts to limit flying duty to specific aircraft, roles, or missions.
3.4. Who Authorizes Career Aviation Service. Authority to initiate or terminate aviation
career status is vested in:
   3.4.1. Chief of Staff (CSAF) of the Air Force.
   3.4.2. AF/A3/5, Deputy Chief of Staff, Operations, Plans and Requirements.
   3.4.3. AF/A3O, Director of Current Operations and Training.
   3.4.4. AF/A3O-AT, Chief, Operational Training Division.

   3.4.5. MAJCOM/CC/A3 or commanders of Field Operating Agencies (FOAs) within the
   USAF and ARC.
   3.4.6. Commanders who exercise direct control over the HARM office that maintains an
   assigned member's flight records.
3.5. Qualification for Flying Incentive Pays.
   3.5.1. Qualification for Aviation Career Incentive Pay (ACIP). To be entitled to ACIP, an
   officer must: 1) be entitled to basic pay; 2) hold a current aeronautical rating or be enrolled in
   training leading to an aeronautical rating; 3) be medically and professionally qualified for
   aviation service; and 4) have a valid AO. In addition to these four requirements, rated
   officers in conditional flight pay entitlement status must be assigned to an active flying
   position and satisfy conditional incentive pay requirements IAW DoD FMR, Volume 7A,
   and AFI 11-421.
   3.5.2. Qualification for Career Enlisted Flying Incentive Pay (CEFIP). To be entitled to
   CEFIP, a CEA must: 1) be entitled to basic pay; 2) hold a 1AXXX or other AFSC approved
   by AF/A3O-AT or be enrolled in Formal Flying Training (FFT) leading to designation as a
   CEA; 3) be medically and professionally qualified for aviation service and; 4) have a valid
   AO. In addition to these four requirements, CEAs in conditional flight pay entitlement status
   must be assigned to an active flying position and satisfy conditional incentive pay
   requirements IAW DoD FMR, Volume 7A, and AFI 11-421. Note: RPA sensor operators are
   not eligible for CEFIP.
3.6. Termination of Career Aviation Service. Aviation service ends when a rated officer or
CEA's AO (including rating or CEA designation) is no longer valid or upon suspension,
disqualification, separation, or retirement.
   3.6.1. When an active duty or ARC rated officer/CEA separates or retires, his or her aviation
   service status and rating/CEA designation becomes invalid.
   3.6.2. When an officer/CEA is suspended, disqualified, separated, or retired from the service
   the HARM office will print an ARMS IDS, FHR, IFR, JHR and IJR (if applicable) and file
   the AO, MPO and ARMS products in the member's FRF.
   3.6.3. Suspension. Do not suspend a rated officer/CEA (ASC 04) for more than 180 calendar
   days without MAJCOM/A3T approval. The suspension period begins on the date the aircrew
   member is notified of the suspension action in writing by the commander (wing commander
   or equivalent for FEB actions). The commander will send a copy of this letter to the
   servicing HARM office. The HARM office will publish a suspension AO effective the date
   of the commander’s letter to the member and terminate member's flight/parachutist pay
   effective one calendar day prior to the effective date of the suspension AO. Suspension
   letters with retroactive effective dates are not authorized. The commander will initiate
   suspension action when the member: Note: Suspension action is authorized for civilian
   government employees flying USAF aicraft.
   3.6.3. (AFSOC) Commanders will not allow suspended rated officers or CEAs to remain in
   aviation service code (ASC) 04 for more than 180 days without HQ AFSOC/A3T approval.
   Request to extend ASC 04 assignment beyond 180/365 days must include justification and
   include approximate completion date of unit suspension action in accordance with (IAW) the

          with safety, crew discipline, and otherwise in the best interests of the Air Force.
   3.6.4. Disqualification (see also paragraph 3.7) Disqualify a rated officer/CEA who is no
   longer medically or professionally qualified to perform aviation service due to the following
   causes:
       3.6.4.1. Result of an FEB.
       3.6.4.2. No longer medically qualified to perform aviation service (Fear of flying, drug

       UCMJ would exceed six months confinement at hard labor.
3.7. Disqualification from Aviation Service.
   3.7.1. Permanent Disqualification Actions. Disqualification from aviation service is
   permanent if it results from FEB action, a request for voluntary disqualification, fear of
   flying, transfer of a rated officer to other than the line-of-the Air Force (except pilot-
   physician), substantiated alcoholism or drug abuse, failure to maintain professional
   standards, or other AF action that indicates permanent disqualification. CEAs are not
   afforded a 120-day notification IAW paragraph 5.7. (See also paragraph 7.8). NOTE:
   Coordinate with the staff judge advocate concerning court-martial and civilian criminal court
   action cases. NOTE: For cases when the member's in a non-permanent disqualification
   status (ASC 00, 03, 07, and 09), ASC 05 and 08 will supersede the previous ASC.
       3.7.1.1. Flying Evaluation Board Actions.
          3.7.1.1.1. The HARM office will suspend a rated officer’s, CEA's and civilian
          government employees’ aviation career status until the FEB action is complete (also
          applies to FEB waiver actions). The convening authority will notify the HARM office
          via a respondent notification letter directing suspension (Attachment 14). The
          HARM office will publish a suspension AO (ASC 04), and terminate the member’s
          flying incentive pay entitlement effective one calendar day prior to the effective date
          of the suspension AO, pending final FEB/FEB waiver outcome.
          3.7.1.1.1. (AFSOC) Once the decision (trigger point) is made that FEB action is
          required, commanders (including convening authorities) will ensure FEB respondent
          notification letters (Attachment 14 in the basic instruction) are processed and served
          in a timely manner within the timelines outlined Table 4.1., in the basic instruction
          and this supplement. (T-1)
          3.7.1.1.2. A rated officer, CEA or civilian government employee will not fly on any
          DoD aircraft except as a passenger if he/she is a respondent in a FEB or waiver of
          FEB action.
46                                                   AFI11-402_AFSOCSUP 12 JUNE 2012


        3.7.1.1.3. If a rated officer, CEA or civilian government employee is disqualified as
        the result of a FEB, the member’s MAJCOM/A3T or equivalent requests AF/A3O-
        AT publish a DAF AO assigning ASC 05 (Disqualified--Flying Evaluation Board)
        effective the original date of the suspension AO. AF/A3O-AT will forward a copy of
        the AO to the individual’s servicing HARM office. The HARM office will revoke the
        original suspension AO and update the ASC in ARMS. Flying incentive pay remains
        terminated effective one calendar day prior to the effective date of the original
        suspension AO.
        3.7.1.1.4. If a rated officer, CEA or civilian government employee remains qualified
        as the result of a FEB and is returned to active flying status in an aircraft in which he
        or she was previously qualified as the result of a FEB waiver action, the MAJCOM
        will instruct the servicing HARM office in writing to publish an AO to revoke the
        suspension order, restore the previous ASC with original effective date, and
        retroactively restart flying incentive pay (if otherwise qualified). (See also paragraph
        4.9).
            3.7.1.1.4.1. Assigns FSC “K” effective the original date of suspension, and
            retroactively restart flying incentive pay (if otherwise qualified). The member
            will be reassigned to active flying status (e.g., FSC “A”) upon class start date or
            the day after date member departs his or her duty station, whichever occurs first.
            (See also paragraph 4.9).
        3.7.1.1.5. If a training pipeline student is placed in training status in multi-placed,
        crew-type aircraft as the result of FEB waiver action, the FEB waiver approval
        authority will instruct the servicing HARM office in writing to publish an AO to
        revoke the suspension order, assign FSC “K” effective the original date of
        suspension, and retroactively restart flying incentive pay (if otherwise qualified). The
        member will be reassigned to active flying status (e.g., FSC “A”) upon class start date
        or the day after date member departs his or her duty station, whichever occurs first.
        3.7.1.1.6. Do not initiate reassignment actions (PCS/PCA) or allow a member to
        complete a PCS move or separate/retire until the FEB action is complete. The
        immediate commmander will direct the Commander’s Support Staff (CSS) to assign
        Assignment Availability Code (AAC) 21 (Attachment 29). If the member is in TDY
        status, AFI 36-2110, Assignments applies. Exception: ARC personnel may be
        returned to the administrative control of the home unit until the FEB convenes.
        3.7.1.1.6. (AFSOC) Do not allow members to return to the unit or go to the next
        unit of assignment until FEB/FEB waiver action is completed. Submit exception-to-
        policy to HQ AFSOC/A3TR for processing to AFSOC/A3. (T-1)
     3.7.1.2. Voluntary Disqualification Actions. In order to fill critical Air Force
     requirements, a rated officer/CEA may request voluntary disqualification from aviation
     service (Attachment 4). This provision is for members who apply for permanent
     retraining to a new non-aircrew DAFSC (not identified in paragraphs 3.7.1.4 or 3.7.2.7).
     Approve such requests only when in the best interest of the Air Force, e.g. when the
     member possesses a special non-aircrew skill or qualification and the Air Force needs the
     member to perform in this non-aircrew capacity.
AFI11-402_AFSOCSUP 12 JUNE 2012                                                                47


        3.7.1.2.1. CEAs approved for CAREERS/NCO retraining, Officer Training School
        (OTS), or Academy of Military Science (AMS) are not required to submit a voluntary
        disqualification request; disqualification in these cases is effective on the Date
        Initially Entered Retraining (DIERT), class start date, or date reassigned to the new
        AFSC, whichever occurs first. For all other cases the MAJCOM/A3T (or equivalent)
        reviews the voluntary disqualification request and makes the final decision.
        EXCEPTION: For non-EAD rated officers, the Vice Commander of the Air Force
        Reserve (HQ AFRC/CV) or the Director of the Air National Guard (NGB/CF), as
        applicable, is the approval authority.
        3.7.1.2.2. If the voluntary request is approved, the servicing HARM office will
        publish an AO to assign ASC 08 (Disqualified--Voluntary Request) effective the date
        of MAJCOM/A3T approval and publish an MPO to terminate flight pay effective one
        calendar day prior to the effective date of disqualification and forward a copy of ASC
        08 AO to the MAJCOM/A3T. NOTE: MAJCOM/A3T may delay the publication of
        the disqualification AO based on the needs of the MAJCOM.
            3.7.1.2.2.1. For cases that do not require MAJCOM/A3T approval (paragraph
            3.7.1.2.1), the HARM office will publish an AO assigning ASC 08 (Disqualified--
            Voluntary Request) effective the DIERT, class start date, or date reassigned to the
            non-aircrew DAFSC, whichever occurs first, and publish an MPO to terminate
            flight pay effective one calendar day prior to the effective date of disqualification.
        3.7.1.2.3. CEAs disqualified in order to attend OTS/AMS may later perform duties as
        rated or non-rated officer aircrew members.
            3.7.1.2.3.1. Members who fail to complete OTS/AMS or retraining action may
            request requalification of aviation service as a CEA (Attachment 6). Base
            approval/disapproval on needs of the Air Force.
        3.7.1.2.4. Do not use a voluntary request for disqualification as a basis for other
        administrative or disciplinary action. NOTE: A rated officer/CEA cannot request
        voluntary disqualification as a means to “limit aviation service” (e.g. DOR from a
        formal training course, request to decline a particular assignment, etc). See
        paragraph 4.3.7.3 of this instruction for reasons to convene a FEB and order a rated
        officer/CEA before a board.
     3.7.1.3. Fear of Flying. If a rated officer or CEA professes a fear of flying, the
     member’s commander will advise the member that profession of a fear of flying by a
     rated officer or CEA is professional dereliction. A Fear of Flying categorization is not
     limited to an expression of a general fear of flying. It includes attempts to categorize fear
     of flying by theater of operations, aircraft mission, or type of aircraft. The commander
     will counsel the member regarding AFI 36-3206, Administrative Discharge Actions for
     Commissioned Officers, AFI 36-3208, Administrative Separation of Airmen, or AFI 36-
     3209, Separation and Retirement Procedures for Air National Guard and Air Force
     Reserve Members as applicable. If the commander suspects a violation of the UCMJ and
     intends to question the member concerning the suspected violation, advise the member
     regarding his or her rights IAW Article 31, UCMJ. After advisement, direct the member
     to report to the Area Defense Counsel for further counseling. The Area Defense Counsel
     will advise the member of both the consequences of professed fear of flying, as well as
48                                                   AFI11-402_AFSOCSUP 12 JUNE 2012


     the member’s administrative and legal rights. After legal counseling, offer the member an
     opportunity to withdraw the fear of flying statement. Verify withdrawal of a fear of flying
     statement in writing.
        3.7.1.3.1. If the member withdraws a fear of flying statement, order the member to
        resume flying duties or take other appropriate action.
        3.7.1.3.2. If the member declines to withdraw a fear of flying statement, verify the
        date of refusal in writing. The commander will refer the member for medical
        examination and notify the HARM office in writing to publish an AO assigning ASC
        04 (Suspended--Disqualification Action Pending) effective the date the member
        declined to withdraw the fear of flying statement. Terminate flight incentive pay
        effective one calendar day prior to the effective date of suspension. The flight surgeon
        will determine if an incapacitating physical or psychiatric condition exists IAW AFI
        48-123, Medical personnel at the lowest echelon possible will determine medical
        fitness for flying and submit a report to the member 's commander.
            3.7.1.3.2.1. If the member is medically unfit to perform flying duties according to
            AFI 48-123, the flight surgeon will provide a statement commenting on duration,
            treatment, and relationship between the disorder and the professed fear of flying.
            In the remarks section of AF Form 1042, Medical Recommendation for Flying or
            Special Operational Duty, the flight surgeon will state that the medical condition
            is directly related to the fear of flying. The HARM office will revoke the
            suspension AO and publish an AO assigning ASC 03 to medically disqualify the
            member effective the same date as the original suspension AO. Flight pay
            remains terminated effective one calendar day prior to the effective date of the
            disqualification AO.
            3.7.1.3.2.2. If the member is medically fit to perform flying duties according to
            AFI 48-123, the suspension remains in effect. Forward the case file to the
            MAJCOM/A3T with all supporting evidence for discharge action under AFI 36-
            3206, AFI 36-3208, or AFI 36-2209 as applicable. At the same time, forward a
            copy of the suspension AO through command channels to AF/A3O-AT.
            MAJCOM/A3T requests AF/A3O-AT publish a DAF AO imposing permanent
            disqualification from aviation service and assigning ASC 01 (Disqualified--Fear
            of Flying). This AO will have the same effective date as the original AO that
            suspended the individual. The disqualification AO will prohibit the member from
            wearing the aviation badge. AF/A3O-AT will forward a copy of the AO to the
            individual’s servicing HARM office. The HARM office will revoke the original
            suspension AO and update the ASC in ARMS. Flight pay remains terminated
            effective one calendar day prior to the effective date of the disqualification AO.
        3.7.1.3.3. Members in UFT who develop a fear of flying have ample opportunities
        during training to evaluate this fear and DOR from training without prejudice. For
        nonrated officers and CEA students in formal flying training who DOR from training
        due to fear of flying, the member’s commander will direct the HARM office to
        publish an AO assigning ASC 06, terminate flight incentive pay, and list in the
        remarks section of the AO the reason for disqualification from aviation service.
AFI11-402_AFSOCSUP 12 JUNE 2012                                                                49


        Terminate flight incentive pay effective one calendar day prior to the effective date of
        disqualification.
        3.7.1.3.4. Do not initiate reassignment actions (PCS/PCA) or allow a member to
        complete a PCS move or separate/retire until the disqualification action is resolved.
        The immediate commmander will direct the CSS to assign AAC 21 (Attachment 29).
        If the member is in TDY status, AFI 36-2110 applies.
     3.7.1.4. Transfer to Other-Than-Line of the Air Force. Disqualify a rated officer from
     aviation service if he or she transfers to other-than-line of the Air Force (permanent non-
     rated duty), is accepted for legal education under the USAF program outlined in AFI 51-
     101, Judge Advocate Accession Program, or is accepted for a USAF-sponsored education
     program resulting in a transfer to other-than-line of the Air Force. Subject to the
     commander’s discretion, these officers may continue to perform flying duties until the
     transfer is approved (no suspension is required).
        3.7.1.4.1. When applying for a commission change, legal program, or medical
        education program, include a voluntary request for disqualification from aviation
        service IAW Attachment 4. If the application is approved, procuring agencies (e.g.
        legal or medical application review boards) forward the request to AF/A3O-AT.
        Include the commission change date and class start date. AF/A3O-AT will publish an
        AO to impose disqualification effective the date of commission change or class start
        date, whichever occurs first, and assign ASC 08 (Disqualified--Voluntary Request).
        AF/A3O-AT will forward a copy of the AO to the individual’s HARM office. The
        HARM office will update the ASC in ARMS and publish an MPO to terminate flight
        pay effective one calendar day prior to the effective date of disqualification.
        Disqualification under this subparagraph is permanent except as noted below.
        3.7.1.4.2. A rated officer who transfers to the Medical Corps may later complete
        training and requalify for aviation service as a flight surgeon. The officer remains
        disqualified from aviation service in previously awarded ratings unless approved to
        perform as a pilot-physician (see paragraph 3.8.6).
        3.7.1.4.3. IAW paragraph 3.8.7, a rated officer who fails to complete medical or
        legal education may request requalification for aviation service in the previously held
        rated specialty.
     3.7.1.5. Substantiated Drug Abuse. If a rated officer/CEA is under investigation or
     self-identifies for alcohol-related misconduct, alcoholism or drug abuse, the commander
     will notify the HARM office in writing to publish an AO to assign ASC 04 (Suspended--
     Disqualification Action Pending) and terminate flying incentive pay effective one
     calendar day prior to the effective date of suspension. The commander’s letter will
     include the date the member self-identified, which will also be the effective date of
     suspension. If not a self-identification, the date of the commander’s letter is the effective
     date of the suspension.
        3.7.1.5.1. If the investigation does not substantiate drug abuse, the commander will
        notify the HARM office in writing to publish an AO to revoke the suspension order,
        restore the previous ASC with original effective date, and retroactively restart flying
        incentive pay (if otherwise qualified).
50                                                    AFI11-402_AFSOCSUP 12 JUNE 2012


        3.7.1.5.2. If the investigation substantiates or the member self-identifies that drug
        abuse occurred, the commander will forward the disqualification package
        (commander's letter of confirmation with substantiating documentation), and a copy
        of the suspension AO through command channels to the MAJCOM/A3T or
        equivalent for approval. If the MAJCOM/A3T or equivalent approves the
        disqualification action, he/she will request AF/A3O-AT publish a DAF AO assigning
        ASC 00 (Disqualified--Administrative Reasons) effective the date of the original
        suspension AO. AF/A3O-AT will forward a copy of the AO to the individual’s
        HARM office. The HARM office will revoke the original suspension AO and update
        the ASC in ARMS. Flight incentive pay remains terminated effective one calendar
        day prior to the effective date of the original suspension. (See also paragraph 7.8).
        3.7.1.5.3. Do not initiate reassignment actions (PCS/PCA) or allow a member to
        complete a PCS move or separate/retire, until the disqualification action is resolved.
        The immediate commmander will direct the CSS to assign AAC 21 (Attachment 29).
        If the member is in TDY status, AFI 36-2110 applies.
     3.7.1.6. Failure To Maintain Professional Standards. The commander will notify the
     HARM office in writing to suspend a rated officer/CEA for any of the reasons listed in
     paragraph 3.6.3, and terminate flying incentive pay effective one calendar day prior to
     the suspension effective date. The HARM office will publish an AO assigning ASC 04
     effective the date the member was notified in writing of the suspension action by the
     commander. Under these circumstances, do not initiate other aviation service action until
     the administrative or disciplinary action is complete. If the reason is flying related, e.g.,
     failure to attain/maintain aircrew qualification, commanders will recommend that the
     member appear before an FEB. For non-flying related reasons, after proceedings are
     complete (Article 15 process, court martial, administrative board, etc.), the commander
     will assess the member's potential for continued rated/CEA service.
        3.7.1.6.1. If the member is suitable for continued aviation service, the commander
        will notify the HARM office in writing to publish an AO to revoke ASC 04, restore
        the previous ASC with the original effective date, and retroactively restart flying
        incentive pay (if otherwise qualified).
        3.7.1.6.2. If the member is unavailable or unsuitable for continued aviation duties,
        the commander will recommend disqualification and notify the member in writing.
        The commander will forward the recommendation, substantiating documentation, and
        a copy of the suspension AO through command channels to the MAJCOM/A3T or
        equivalent for approval. The MAJCOM/A3T or equivalent will request AF/A3O-AT
        publish a DAF AO assigning ASC 00 (Disqualified--Administrative Reasons),
        effective the same date as the original suspension AO. AF/A3O-AT will forward a
        copy of the DAF AO to the individual’s HARM office. The HARM office will revoke
        the original suspension AO and update the ASC in ARMS. Flight pay remains
        terminated effective one calendar day prior to the effective date of the original
        suspension. If the commander’s recommendation is to prohibit wear of the aviation
        badge, see Chapter 7.
        3.7.1.6.3. Do not initiate reassignment actions (PCS/PCA) or allow a member to
        complete a PCS move until the disqualification action is resolved. The immediate
AFI11-402_AFSOCSUP 12 JUNE 2012                                                               51


           commmander will direct the CSS to assign AAC 21 (Attachment 29). If the member
           is in TDY status, AFI 36-2110 applies.
                 3.7.1.6.3.1. Commanders will ensure members do not separate or retire while in
                 suspended status (ASC 04). Waiver authority for extenuating circumstances is the
                 MAJCOM A3T or equivalent. MAJCOMs will send info copies of all approved
                 waivers to AF/A3O-AT.

NOTES:
1. The effective date of suspension will be the date the FEB respondent is notified in
writing by the convening authority (normally WG/CC).
2. The MAJCOM/CC is the final approving authority on FEB actions including FEB
waivers and VILO requests. If the MAJCOM/CC approves the disqualification
recommendation, the MAJCOM/A3T will request AF/A3O-AT publish the DAF AO.
FEB approval authority may be delegated no lower than MAJCOM/A3.
3. Suspend effective the date of the member’s written request.
4. Suspend effective the date member declines to withdraw fear of flying statement.
5. The effective date will be the date member is withdrawn from the UFT/FFT course.
6. This includes enlisted members selected to attend OTS/AMS.
   3.7.2. Non-permanent Disqualification Actions. If disqualified for reasons other than those
   in paragraph 3.7.1., rated officers and CEAs may be requalified. The member must show
   the impediment to aviation service no longer exits. NOTE: For cases when the member's in
   a non-permanent disqualification status (ASC 00, 03, 07, and 09), ASC 05 and 08 will
   supersede the previous ASC.
       3.7.2.1. Failure to Maintain Medical Fitness. If a rated officer or CEA is medically
       unfit to perform flying duties, disqualify the member effective the first day following a
       period of 365 days that commences on the date of incapacitation (DNIF date), or on the
       date the MAJCOM/SG determines the medical incapacitation to be permanent, whichever
       is earlier.
           3.7.2.1.1. When a rated officer/CEA is medically unfit, a flight surgeon will
           complete the AF Form 1042 and forward it to the flying unit of assignment and
           HARM office that maintains the member's FRF.
           3.7.2.1.2. If a flight surgeon is unable to determine the period of incapacitation, the
           HARM office will suspense the AF Form 1042 to ensure publication of an AO to
           medically disqualify the member effective the 366th day following the date the
           member was medically incapacitated (placed in DNIF status). If the medical
           incapacitation is not resolved prior to the 366th day, the HARM office will publish an
           AO assigning ASC 03 (Disqualified--Medical Disqualification) effective the 366th
           day following the date of medical incapacitation and terminate flying incentive pay
           effective one calendar day prior to the effective date of the disqualification AO.
           Additionally, for CEAs medically disqualified, the HARM office will notify the
           member’s unit commander, MPF Personnel Utilization Section, and MAJCOM CEA
           Career Field Functional Manager. Personnel offices should initiate personnel
           classification action IAW AFI 36-2101.
           3.7.2.1.2. (AFSOC) HARM offices will also notify the group-level CEA FM and
           HQ AFSOC/A3TR. The recommended notification method is a copy of the
           disqualifying AO assigning ASC 03. Special Tactics TARM offices and overseas
           Special Operations Group (SOG) 1C0 FMs will coordinate notification requirements
           with their servicing HARM offices. (T-2)
AFI11-402_AFSOCSUP 12 JUNE 2012                                                             53


        3.7.2.1.3. If the flight surgeon determines the incapacitation will not be resolved
        before the 366th day following the date of medical incapacitation, the flight surgeon
        will annotate this fact on the AF Form 1042 and advise the HARM office. The
        HARM office will publish an AO to assign ASC 03 (Disqualified--Medical
        Disqualification), effective the date the approving authority (MAJCOM/SG,
        AFMSA/SG3PF) indicated on the AF Form 1042 that the medical incapacitation is
        permanent. Terminate flying incentive pay effective one calendar day prior to the
        effective date of the disqualification AO. Additionally, for CEAs medically
        disqualified, the HARM office will notify the commander, MPS Personnel Utilization
        Section, and MAJCOM CEA Career Field Functional Manager. Personnel offices
        should initiate personnel classification action IAW AFI 36-2101. NOTE:
        Determining entitlement to conditional ACIP/CEFIP as a result of a medical action is
        often a complex task. As a technique, determine entitlement to ACIP/CEFIP as a
        result of medical fitness by considering a member in one of two groups. The first
        group consists of those members who are incapacitated regardless of whether or not
        the incapacitation resulted from the performance of flying duty. In this situation,
        consult DoD FMR, Volume 7A, Chapter 22, paragraphs 220206 and 220207 to
        determine entitlement. The second group consists of those members described in
        paragraph 3.7.2.1.2 In this situation, the DoD FMR, Volume 7A, Chapter 22,
        paragraph 220207, to determine entitlement.
        3.7.2.1.3. (AFSOC) HARM offices will also notify the group-level CEA FM and
        HQ AFSOC/A3TR. The recommended notification method is a copy of the
        disqualifying AO assigning ASC 03. Special Tactics TARM offices and overseas
        SOG 1C0 FMs will coordinate notification requirements with their servicing HARM
        offices. (T-2)
        3.7.2.1.4. Due to the frequency of medical actions affecting aviation service, the
        FME and HARM office must ensure timely exchange of information. The FME will
        notify the HARM office within one duty day of the disqualification effective date.
        3.7.2.1.5. Refer to paragraph 3.8 for removal of medical disqualification and
        requalification for aviation service.
     3.7.2.2. Failure to Maintain Medical Certification. If a rated officer’s, civilian
     government employees’ or CEA’s medical certification (flight physical) expires, assume
     the member has lost medical fitness. The HARM office will publish an AO to assign
     ASC 07 (Failure to Maintain Medical Fitness/Certification), effective the day after the
     expiration date on the AF Form 1042. The HARM office will terminate flight pay
     effective the expiration date on the AF Form 1042. Note: The HARM office will
     establish a process with the FME to verify the status of all flight physicals expiring the
     following month. The HARMs will take immediate action upon expiration of flight
     physical.
        3.7.2.2.1. See paragraph 3.8.2 for requalification.
     3.7.2.3. Disenrollment from USAF Survival School. If a rated officer or CEA fails to
     meet training standards while enrolled in a USAF survival school, the survival school
     commander will direct the member to meet a training review board. (Exception: This
     does not apply to cases when a member is administratively withdrawn from training due
54                                                   AFI11-402_AFSOCSUP 12 JUNE 2012


     to higher headquarters requirements or if the member is medically unable to complete
     training). If the training review board determines the member should be disenrolled, the
     survival school commander will administratively disqualify the member and direct the
     training base HARM office to:
        3.7.2.3.1. Advise the member's MAJCOM/A3T when the training review board
        begins and ends.
        3.7.2.3.2. MAJCOM/A3T will direct the home station HARM office to publish an
        AO to assign ASC 00 effective the date disenrollment is approved by the training
        review board, and terminate flying incentive pay effective one calendar day prior to
        the disqualification AO effective date.
        3.7.2.3.3. The home station HARM office will send a copy of AO to the member's
        MAJCOM/A3T and AF/A3O-AT. (See paragraph 3.8 for requalification.).
     3.7.2.4. Conscientious Objector or Non-Combatant Status. Commanders will
     disqualify rated officers and CEAs who submit conscientious objector or non-combatant
     status requests IAW AFI 36-3204, Procedures for Applying as a Conscientious Objector,
     direct the HARM office in writing to publish an AO to assign ASC 00 (Disqualified--
     Administrative Reasons) effective the date of the member's request, and terminate flying
     incentive pay effective one calendar day prior to the effective date of the disqualification
     AO. Notify the member's MAJCOM and AF/A3O-AT by letter and include a copy of the
     AO.
        3.7.2.4.1. If the commander’s recommendation is to prohibit the wear of the aviation
        badge IAW Chapter 7, the commander should consult AFI 36-3206, AFI 36-2208, or
        AFI 36-2209 as applicable for possible separation actions.
     3.7.2.5. Personnel Reliability Program (PRP) Decertification. When a commander
     decertifies a rated officer or CEA from the PRP for non-medical, non-drug abuse-related
     reasons and determines action under paragraph 3.7 is not appropriate, the commander
     must determine whether the member should continue in non-PRP rated duties. If PRP
     decertified for medical reasons, including alcoholism or drug abuse, paragraph 3.7.1.5
     and/or paragraph 3.7.1.6 apply. Otherwise:
        3.7.2.5.1. When imposing PRP decertification, the commander will notify the
        member in writing and send a copy of this letter to the servicing HARM office. The
        HARM office will publish an AO to assign ASC 04 effective the date of the
        commander’s notification letter (unless otherwise specified), and terminate flying
        incentive pay effective one calendar day prior to the suspension AO effective date.
        Use Attachment 5 as a guideline for notification that the commander will be
        determining the member's future potential as a rated/CEA asset.
        3.7.2.5.2. Once notified, the member has 14 calendar days to submit documents in
        his or her behalf.
        3.7.2.5.3. The commander will use the information that formed the basis for
        decertification along with any other information and the member's response to
        determine whether the member should be disqualified or remain qualified for aviation
        service in non-PRP rated/CEA aircrew duty.
AFI11-402_AFSOCSUP 12 JUNE 2012                                                              55


            3.7.2.5.3.1. If the commander determines the member should remain qualified in
            non-PRP aircrew duties, the commander notifies the HARM office in writing to
            publish an AO to revoke ASC 04, retroactively restart flying incentive pay (if
            otherwise qualified), and return the member to flying duties. Inform the
            MAJCOM through command channels.
            3.7.2.5.3.2. If the commander determines the member should be disqualified, the
            commander will forward the disqualification package (recommendation) through
            channels to the MAJCOM/A3T or equivalent for a final decision. Each command
            level will review the case, provide comments, and submit a recommendation to
            the next higher level.
               3.7.2.5.3.2.1. If the MAJCOM/A3T or equivalent determines the member
               should remain qualified, direct the HARM office to revoke ASC 04,
               retroactively restart the member's flying incentive pay (if otherwise qualified),
               and return the member to aircrew duties.
               3.7.2.5.3.2.2. If the MAJCOM/A3T or equivalent approves the
               disqualification, forward all documentation and a copy of the suspension AO
               to AF/A3O-AT and request publication of a DAF AO to assign ASC 00
               (Disqualified--Administrative Reasons), effective the date of the original
               suspension. AF/A3O-AT will forward a copy of the AO to the individual’s
               servicing HARM office. The HARM office will revoke the original
               suspension and update the ASC in ARMS. Flight pay remains terminated
               effective one calendar day prior to the effective date of suspension.
     3.7.2.6. Returning to Active Duty in a Non-rated/Non-CEA Capacity. Do not publish
     revalidation AOs or requalify a rated officer or CEAs who voluntarily returns to active
     duty in a non-rated/non-CEA capacity. These members will not receive ACIP/CEFIP.
     This provision applies to members returning from separation status and members
     transferring from the ARC to active duty. The HARM will publish an AO to assign ASC
     00 (Disqualified--Administrative Reasons) effective the day the member is assigned to
     active duty in the non-rated/non-CEA capacity. These members may be requalified at a
     later date.
        3.7.2.6.1. Reassignment to the ARC after separation. Do not publish revalidation
        AOs or requalify a rated officer or CEA who separates from military service and is
        later hired to a non-rated/non-CEA position in the ARC. These members are not
        entitled to ACIP/CEFIP. The servicing HARM office will publish an AO assigning
        ASC 00 effective the day the member is assigned to the non-rated/non-CEA position.
        These members may be requalified at a later date.
        3.7.2.6.2. Members who transfer within the same Air Reserve Component from a
        rated position into a non-rated position are entitled to continue receiving ACIP only if
        the component considers the member to be a rated asset. The local HARM office will
        publish an AO assigning FSC “J” effective the date of assignment to the non-rated
        position.
     3.7.2.7. Commanders of ARC units will disqualify CEAs when a unit or aircraft is
     deactivated and the member is forced to retrain or is reassigned to a non-CEA DAFSC at
 56                                                  AFI11-402_AFSOCSUP 12 JUNE 2012


      that duty location in lieu of reassignment to an aircrew billet at another location.
      Commanders will forward the disqualification package through command channels for
      MAJCOM/A3T approval. If approved, the MAJCOM/A3T will direct the HARM office
      to publish an AO assigning ASC 00 (Disqualified--Administrative Reasons) effective the
      deactivation date or date the member is reassigned to a non-CEA DAFSC, whichever is
      earlier. The HARM office will publish an MPO terminating CEFIP effective one calendar
      day prior to the effective date of the disqualification AO. CEAs disqualified IAW this
      paragraph may be requalified for aviation service at a later date.
      3.7.2.8. Commanders will disqualify rated officers and CEAs approved for the Air Force
      Educational Leave of Absence (AFELOA) program and direct the HARM office in
      writing to publish an AO to assign ASC 09 (Disqualified--AFELOA) effective the first
      day of leave established by AF Form 988, Leave Request/Authorization, and terminate
      flying incentive pay effective one calendar day prior to the effective date of the
      disqualification AO. Rated officers/CEAs disqualified IAW this paragraph may be
      requalified for aviation service upon return from authorized leave and reassignment to
      rated/CEA duties.
      3.7.2.9. ARC (Air Force Reserve & Air National Guard) and Active Duty members not
      assigned to an authorized UMD positions (by-pass positions, pseudo positions,
      Participating Inactive Ready Reserve (PIRR) Cat E program, etc) will be administratively
      disqualified from aviation service. The HARM office will publish an AO assigning ASC
      00 (Disqualified—Administrative Reasons) effective the date of assignment. The HARM
      office will publish an MPO terminating flying incentive pay effective one calendar day

NOTES:
1. The effective date of medical disqualification is the first day following 365 days
from the date of DNIF OR the date the MAJCOM/SG determines member is medically
disqualified (whichever is earlier) on the AF Form 1042.
2. Refer to paragraph. 3.7.2.2. if the member does not complete the required physical
examination.
3. Notify the member’s MAJCOM and AF/A3O-AT by letter (include AO).
4. Effective date of AO is established by AF Form 988.
5. Copies of ANG disqualification actions for unit deactivation/aircraft conversion will
be sent in electronic format to ANG/A3.
6. Send a copy of the disqualification AO to appropriate MAJCOM/A3T

3.8. Aviation Service Requalification. Rated officers and CEAs may submit a letter in
accordance with Attachment 6 to request requalification for aviation service. If the member has
been disqualified for other than medical reasons for eight years or more, he or she will appear
before an FEB. The member must show the impediment that caused disqualification no longer
exists. There is no USAF obligation to requalify rated officers or CEAs for aviation service.
Base approval/disapproval on needs of the Air Force. Make a copy of all requalification
correspondence for inclusion as a permanent part of the member's Master Personnel Record. An
FEB is not required if the hiring unit (or MAJCOM) received the member’s application within
90 days prior to the eight-year point.
   3.8.1. Medical Disqualification (paragraph 3.7.2.1). When a rated officer or CEA is
   disqualified for medical reasons, and later is medically certified for flying duty, one of the
   following three subparagraphs applies: Note: In all cases, CEAs must be assigned to a valid
   AFSC “1A” billet or an approved Special Duty Identifier or Reporting Identifier IAW
   paragraph 3.12. of this instruction.
       3.8.1.1. If the duration of medical disqualification was less than one year, the local
       medical authority certifies medical fitness. Requalification is immediate and an
       application is not required. Upon receipt of the requalifying AF Form 1042, the HARM
       office will forward a copy of the medical disqualification AO, medical requalification AF
       Form 1042, and aviation service computation sheet to AF/A3O-AT or HQ AFRC/A3TB
       (ARC members) to request an ASD adjustment for the period of disqualification. Upon
58                                                   AFI11-402_AFSOCSUP 12 JUNE 2012


     receipt of the ASD adjustment letter from AF/A3O-AT or HQ AFRC/A3TB (ARC
     members) the HARM office will verify the ASD adjustment in ARMS. Following this
     verification, the HARM office will publish the requalification AO with the adjusted ASD
     effective the date indicated on the requalification AF Form 1042, and restart flying
     incentive pay (if otherwise qualified). Exception: If the member is required to fly
     prior to the ASD adjustment completion, the HARM may publish the
     requalification AO. Once the ASD adjustment is completed, the HARM will amend
     the requalification AO to reflect the corrected ASD.
     3.8.1.2. If the duration of medical disqualification extended for at least one year but less
     than five years, the gaining MAJCOM/SG, or HQ AFMSA/SG3PF as applicable, must
     certify that the member is medically acceptable for flying duty. (MAJCOM/SG is the
     certifying authority for members disqualified for failure to maintain medical certification.
     HQ AFMSA/SG3PF is the certifying authority for members disqualified for medical
     reasons). After the appropriate certification authority approves medical qualification, the
     local medical authority forwards recertification documentation to the member’s servicing
     HARM office. Upon receipt of the requalifying AF Form 1042, the HARM office will
     forward a copy of the medical disqualification AO, medical requalification AF Form
     1042, and aviation service worksheet to AF/A3O-AT or HQ AFRC/A3TB (ARC
     members) to request an ASD adjustment for the period of disqualification. Upon receipt
     of the ASD adjustment letter from AF/A3O-AT or HQ AFRC/A3TB (ARC members) the
     HARM office will verify the ASD correction in ARMS. Following this verification, the
     HARM office will publish the requalification AO with the adjusted ASD effective the
     date indicated on the requalification AF Form 1042, and restart flying incentive pay (if
     otherwise qualified). Exception: If the member is required to fly prior to the ASD
     adjustment completion, the HARM may publish the requalification AO. Once the
     ASD adjustment is completed, the HARM will amend the requalification AO to
     reflect the corrected ASD.
     3.8.1.3. In all cases, if the duration of medical disqualification extended five years or
     longer, HQ AFMSA/SG3PF must certify medical acceptability for flying duty. After HQ
     AFMSA/SG3PF approves the medical certification, the aircrew member submits an
     application for requalification (Attachment 6). Forward the application and medical
     certification to AF/A3O-AT to publish a DAF AO and adjust the member’s ASD for the
     period of disqualification. AF/A3O-AT will publish a DAF AO effective the date the
     member is assigned to rated/CEA aviation duty, and forward a copy of the DAF AO to
     the individual’s HARM office and HQ AFRC/A3TB (ARC members). The HARM office
     will verify the adjusted ASD in ARMS and publish an AO to assign the appropriate ASC.
     The HARM office will start flying incentive pay on the effective date of the AO (if
     otherwise qualified). NOTE:          In cases of member's prior permanent medical
     disqualification due to a medical, physical, or emotional condition, HQ AFMSA/SG3PF
     is the medical certification authority for requalification. Exception: If the member is
     required to fly prior to the ASD adjustment completion, the HARM may publish the
     requalification AO. Once the ASD adjustment is completed, the HARM will amend
     the requalification AO to reflect the corrected ASD.
     3.8.1.4. A member medically disqualified as a rated officer, but medically qualified as a
     non-rated officer aircrew member, may request requalification for aviation service. The
AFI11-402_AFSOCSUP 12 JUNE 2012                                                               59


     request must specify requalification is to perform duties as a non-rated officer aircrew
     member. IAW Attachment 6, submit a requalification for aviation service package
     through channels to the MAJCOM. Refer to Chapter 5.
  3.8.2. Failure to Maintain Medical Certification .(paragraph 3.7.2.2) A rated officer or
  CEA, disqualified (ASC 07) for lack of medical certification, must accomplish the physical
  examination as soon as possible. Upon receipt of medical certification via AF IMT 1042, the
  HARM office will publish an AO re-instating aviation service effective the date of the AF
  IMT 1042. Aviation Service Date (ASD) adjustments are not authorized.
  3.8.3. Disenrollment from USAF Survival School. (paragraph 3.7.2.3) If a rated officer
  or CEA was disqualified from aviation service as a result of a training review board,
  requalify the member for aviation service once he or she successfully completes USAF
  survival training. The member's HARM office will publish the requalification AO effective
  the class graduation date, and restart flying incentive pay (if otherwise qualified). Forward a
  copy of the requalification AO to the member's MAJCOM and AF/A3O-AT.
  3.8.4. Conscientious Objector Status or Non-combatant Status (paragraph 3.7.2.4.) If a
  rated officer’s or CEA’s request under AFI 36-3204 is denied or withdrawn, the member may
  apply for requalification. Forward the request through channels to the MAJCOM/A3T or
  equivalent. If approved, forward the package to AF/A3O-AT to publish a DAF AO
  requalifying the individual. AF/A3O-AT will forward a copy of the DAF AO to the
  individual’s servicing HARM office. The HARM office will publish an AO to assign the
  appropriate ASC and restart flying incentive pay (if otherwise qualified).
  3.8.5. PRP Decertification (paragraph 3.7.2.5). The USAF may requalify a member for
  aviation service who was previously PRP decertified for medical reasons when the
  appropriate medical authority determines the medical problem is resolved. Remove the PRP
  decertification before the member returns to PRP duties.
     3.8.5.1. When the cause for PRP decertification is other than medical, forward the
     requalification request to the MAJCOM/A3T or equivalent for approval. If approved, the
     MAJCOM/A3T or equivalent will request AF/A3O-AT publish the requalifying DAF AO
     effective the date the member is assigned to rated/CEA duties. AF/A3O-AT will forward
     a copy of the AO to the individual’s HARM office. The HARM office will publish an
     AO to assign the appropriate ASC, and restart flying incentive pay (if otherwise
     qualified).
  3.8.6. Pilot-Physician Status. A flight surgeon that possesses a USAF pilot rating may be
  authorized pilot-physician status and requalify for aviation service as a pilot. The officer
  must submit a request for approval through MAJCOM medical channels to HQ
  AFMSA/SG3PF, 1500 Wilson Blvd, Suite 1200, Arlington, VA 22209. HQ AFMSA/SG3PF
  will submit a request for final approval through AF/SG to AF/A3/5. If approved, AF/A3O-
  AT will publish a DAF AO effective the date the officer reports for rated duty as a pilot-
  physician. AF/A3O-AT will forward a copy of the DAF AO to the individual’s HARM
  office. The HARM office will update the AO in ARMS and start flying incentive pay once
  the member satisfies conditional ACIP flight requirements IAW DoD FMR, Volume 7A,
  Chapter 22.

   3.8.7. Failure to Transfer to Other Than the Line of the Air Force. (paragraph 3.7.1.4)
   A rated officer voluntarily disqualified IAW paragraph 3.7.1.4 may be requalified if he or
   she does not complete the education program. Request requalification IAW Attachment 6.
   Forward the requalification request to the MAJCOM/A3T or equivalent for approval. If
   approved, the MAJCOM/A3T or equivalent will request AF/A3O-AT publish the
   requalifying DAF AO effective the date the officer reports to an authorized UMD rated duty
   position. AF/A3O-AT will forward a copy of the AO to the individual’s servicing HARM
   office. The HARM office will publish an AO to assign the appropriate ASC and restart flying
   incentive pay (if otherwise qualified).
   3.8.8. Returning to Active Duty in a Non-rated/Non-CEA capacity. (paragraph 3.7.2.6)
   Rated officers and CEAs who returned to non-rated/non-CEA duties after a period of
   separation may request requalification for aviation service. Approve requalification only if a
   rated/CEA position exists and the member is available and qualified to fill the vacancy.
   Forward requalification requests to the MAJCOM/A3T or equivalent for approval. If
   approved, the MAJCOM/A3T or equivalent will request AF/A3O-AT publish the
   requalifying DAF AO effective the date the member is assigned to an authorized UMD
   rated/CEA duty position. AF/A3O-AT will forward a copy of the AO to the individual’s

3.10. Aviation Service for Rated Officers/CEAs in the ARC or Recalled/Returning to
Active duty.
   3.10.1. Inactive Aviation Service Status. When an active duty or ARC rated officer or
   CEA is released from his or her respective component, the member’s aviation service status
   terminates, AOs (including rating/CEA designation) become invalid, and entitlement to
62                                                    AFI11-402_AFSOCSUP 12 JUNE 2012


  ACIP/CEFIP ceases. Termination of aviation service status for separation does not require
  withdrawal of rated/CEA AFSCs. The losing HARM office will publish an AO to assign
  FSC P--Inactive-separated, effective the DOS, or FSC R--inactive-retired, effective the date
  of retirement. (Exception: Do not publish FSC P AOs for members transferring to ARC or
  active duty who do not incur a break in service. The gaining component will publish a
  revalidation AO with the current ASC so the correct component is indicated on the AO. Do
  not adjust the ASD.) See AFI 11-421 for AO procedures and remarks. NOTE: Before July
  2002, FSC P orders were published one day after the DOS IAW governing directives. These
  orders remain valid.
     3.10.1.1. The HARM office must evaluate the separating or retiring member’s flying
     hours and qualification to determine when flying incentive pay should be terminated.
     Normally, the HARM office will terminate flying incentive pay effective one calendar
     day prior to the effective date of the separation/retirement AO. If the member’s flight
     physical expires or the member does not have sufficient flying hours to satisfy flight
     requirements for entitlement to conditional flying incentive pay up to the
     separation/retirement date, however, terminate ACIP/CEFIP effective the last date the
     member met requirements for entitlement to flying incentive pay. For a member whose
     flight physical expires before the separation/retirement date, the HARM office will
     publish an AO assigning ASC 07 (Disqualified – Failure to maintain medical
     certification) effective the day following the medical certification expiration date. This
     AO will remain a permanent part of the FRF. NOTE: Before June 1981, some rated
     officers were administratively disqualified due to "flying duties no longer required," and
     assigned ASC 00. Officers who later apply for rated duties in the ARC or who are
     recalled to active duty must have AOs revalidated or be requalified for aviation service (if
     disqualified and placed in ASC 00). Once hired to perform rated duties, if ARC officers
     return to inactive non-rated duties after participating in rated duties, repeat this process
     before they return to active rated duties.
  3.10.2. Revalidation or Requalification Process. The difference between revalidation and
  requalification actions is administrative. For example, a rated officer or CEA issued a
  disqualification (or suspension) order and assigned ASC 00 must be requalified for aviation
  service. A rated officer or CEA not issued a disqualification AO must have his or her AOs
  revalidated (including rating/CEA designation) when hired to a rated/CEA API coded
  position following a period of separation or retirement. The process is the same in either case
  and includes an application in accordance with Attachment 6, medical and professional
  qualification, and assignment to a vacant rated/CEA API coded duty position. The following
  conditions apply: NOTE: HARM offices will not publish AOs to initiate aviation service
  and start flying incentive pay until receipt of the revalidation/requalification DAF AO and
  validation that the ASD has been adjusted. Additionally, commanders will not enter
  members into formal flying training courses prior to publication of a DAF AO.
     3.10.2.1. Active duty qualified rated officers and CEAs who apply for ARC rated/CEA
     positions, or ARC qualified rated officers and CEAs assigned to rated/CEA UMD
     positions that apply for an active duty rated/CEA position within 90 days of separation
     and assigned within 180 days of separation, do not need to submit a revalidation request.
     For all others, if aviation service status has been inactive (FSC P or R) for less than eight
     years, the gaining MAJCOM/A3T or equivalent, as appropriate, must approve
AFI11-402_AFSOCSUP 12 JUNE 2012                                                              63


     revalidation or requalification. Convene an FEB if the member submits the application
     eight years or longer after the date aviation service was invalidated. NOTE: A
     MAJCOM, at its discretion, may direct a FEB for a member who was inactive or
     disqualified for less than eight years.
        3.10.2.1.1. If the gaining MAJCOM/A3T or equivalent approves the revalidation or
        requalification request, forward a copy of the approval to AF/A3O-AT. AF/A3O-AT
        will publish a DAF AO to revalidate or requalify the member (as appropriate) for
        aviation service effective the date of return to rated/CEA duty, and adjust the
        member’s ASD by the break in service. AF/A3O-AT will forward a copy of the DAF
        AO to HQ AFRC/A3TB (ARC members) and to the individual’s MAJCOM and
        servicing HARM office. The HARM office will publish an AO to assign the
        appropriate ASC, adjust the member’s ASCs in ARMS (if applicable), and start flying
        incentive pay (if otherwise qualified).
        3.10.2.1.2. Flight surgeons returning to active duty or the ARC after a period of
        separation of less than eight years do not require MAJCOM/A3T approval for
        revalidation of aviation service. Upon receipt of a request for revalidation and
        verification by the MAJCOM/SG that the individual meets requirements for
        revalidation, AF/A3O-ATF will publish the revalidation DAF AO and adjust the ASD
        for the period of separation.
            3.10.2.1.2.1. Flight surgeons initially assigned to an API 5 position will be
            assigned ASC 8A, if medically qualified. Flight surgeons not medically qualified,
            or assigned to positions coded other than API 5, will be assigned ASC 8J.
     3.10.2.2. If a rated officer’s or CEA's aviation service status has been inactive (FSC P or
     R) for eight years or longer as of the date the application is submitted, or the member was
     disqualified for eight years or longer as of the date the application is submitted, approve
     or disapprove aviation service revalidation or requalification via FEB action. The
     MAJCOM/A3 must ensure the member is qualified and being considered for hire to a
     vacant rated or CEA billet. If MAJCOM/A3 approves, the MAJCOM/A3 requests
     AF/A3O-AT publish a DAF AO to revalidate or requalify the member for aviation
     service effective the date of return to rated/CEA duty and adjust the member’s ASD by
     the break in service. (EXCEPTION: HQ AFMSA/SG3PF approves revalidation or
     requalification of a flight surgeon if the member’s aviation service has been inactive
     (FSC P or R) for eight years or longer as of the date the application is submitted, or the
     member was disqualified for eight years or longer as of the date the application is
     submitted, and directs AF/A3O-AT to publish a DAF AO). AF/A3O-AT will forward a
     copy of the DAF AO to the individual’s MAJCOM, servicing HARM office, and HQ
     AFRC/A3TB (ARC members). The HARM office will publish an AO to assign the
     appropriate ASC, adjust the member’s ASCs in ARMS (if applicable), and start flying
     incentive pay (if otherwise qualified).
     3.10.2.3. Only the CSAF approves revalidation of an AO pertaining to a retired officer
     recalled to active duty. This restriction does not apply to members in temporary disability
     retirement status. Once a retired aviator is approved for return to active duty as a rated
     asset, AF/A3O-AT will publish the revalidation DAF AO.
 64                                                    AFI11-402_AFSOCSUP 12 JUNE 2012


       3.10.2.4. Assignment to Inactive Rated/CEA Duties for Officers/CEAs Separated
       Longer Than Eight Years. Commanders may consider, on a case-by-case basis,
       separated rated/CEA personnel returning to military service after an eight year or longer
       break in service for assignment to inactive rated/CEA staff positions when the member
       does not request revalidation of AOs (Attachment 30).
          3.10.2.4.1. Assignment to an inactive rated/CEA position is based on the needs of the
          Air Force IAW AFI 11-412, Aircrew Management. Do not convene an FEB if the
          member’s rating/badge was valid upon separation. The HARM will publish an AO
          assigning the member ASC 00 (Disqualified – Administrative Reasons) effective the
          date the member is hired into the inactive rated/CEA staff position. After return to
          military service, convene an FEB if the member requests aviation service
          revalidation. (See paragraph 3.10.2.2 of this instruction).
   3.10.3. Rated/CEA Positions in the ARC. An ARC rated officer or CEA may be
   requalified for aviation service or have AOs revalidated only if the member is medically
   qualified and assigned to non-EAD rated/CEA duties in the Air National Guard or USAF
   Reserve (Category A or B assignment status). Rated duties include all rated AFSCs with
   rated API (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9) codes. CEA duties include all 1AXXX or 1UXXX
   DAFSC positions with API (A, B, C, D, E, and F) codes. NOTE: ARC flight surgeons may
   be revalidated or requalified IAW paragraph 3.10.2.1.2
       3.10.3.1. Returning to ARC in a Non-rated/Non-CEA Capacity. Rated officers and
       CEAs who volunteer to return to ARC duty as non-rated/Non-CEA members are not
       entitled to revalidation/requalification AOs or ACIP/CEFIP. See paragraph 3.7.2.6
       3.10.3.2. A rated officer hired to an ARC rated position (API code 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and
       9) and later assigned to an API 0 non-rated position maintains competent AOs and
       continues entitlement to ACIP as long as the ARC considers him or her a rated asset and
       the member remains medically qualified and satisfies requirements for continuous
       incentive pay entitlement IAW DoD FMR, Volume 7A, Chapter 22. NOTE: When
       considering ARC officers for hire, assignment to a rated position solely for the purpose of
       initiating an AO/flying incentive pay and then transferring the member to a non-rated
       billet is strictly prohibited.
3.11. Miscellaneous Career Aviation Service Data. Rated officers, CEAs, and rated/CEA
students enrolled in UFT/FFT are assigned an ASD. An ASD is the date of entry into an aviation
career. Use the ASD to determine entitlement rates to ACIP and CEFIP, establish the aviation
service anniversaries (gates), and compute the termination date for continuous ACIP/CEFIP
entitlement at the appropriate year of aviation service.
   3.11.1. Computation of Rated Officer Aviation Service. Use the ASD to determine the
   12-, 18-, 22- and 25-year points for ACIP entitlement. On 1 Aug 02, SECAF approved a
   change in Air Force policy to terminate aviation service during breaks in service or periods
   of non-permanent disqualification. The earliest effective date for ASC changes and flying
   incentive pay adjustments affecting pilots, CSOs, observers and flight surgeons is 17 Oct 98
   (the effective date of the NDAA of FY99). The earliest effective date for ASC changes and
   flying incentive pay adjustments for ABMs is 1 Oct 99 (date ABM became a rated specialty).
   All ASC and flying incentive pay actions effective prior to these dates for the respective
   specialties were IAW governing directives at that time and will not be adjusted. NOTE:
AFI11-402_AFSOCSUP 12 JUNE 2012                                                             65


  Whether the ASD adjustment is mandatory (member returned on or after 1 Aug 02) or as the
  result of a member’s request, all qualifying periods of separation and non-permanent
  disqualification (including unresolved periods of suspension) will be included in an ASD
  adjustment and the aviation service history adjusted accordingly. The effective date of an
  ASD adjustment for rated officers will be 17 Oct 98 (non-ABM), 1 Oct 99 (member
  converted to ABM on that date), date member was converted to an ABM if after 1 Oct 99, or
  date member returned to aviation service, whichever is latest. There is no need to publish an
  ASD adjustment for individuals with longer than 25 years of aviation service unless the
  adjustment pushes the member’s aviation service to less than 25 years.
     3.11.1.1. Criteria for determining ASD. A rated officer’s aviation service begins when
     he or she is in training leading toward award of the basic rating. The member must be
     qualified for aviation service prior to publication of AOs authorizing aviation service.
     The ASD, initial AO effective date, and effective date of ACIP entitlement will not be
     prior to the date the member is qualified for aviation service. In all cases, the ASD will
     not be before the officer is medically certified for flying duty.
         3.11.1.1.1. Officers enrolled in UFT (SUPT, Undergraduate Remotely Piloted
         Aircraft Training (URT), UCT, or NASA Mission Specialist Training) enter an
         aviation career on the class start date (if otherwise qualified) listed in the program
         flying training (PFT) document or the date the member is medically certified for
         flying duty, whichever is later. For example: A member’s class start date was 28 Dec
         06 and he was medically certified for flying 3 Jan 07. His ASD is 3 Jan 07.
         3.11.1.1.2. ABMs. ABMs enrolled in Undergraduate ABM Training (on or after 1
         Apr 10) enter an aviation career on the class start date listed in the PFT document.
         Also reference 2.4.1.1.
             3.11.1.1.2.1. ABMs in authorized 13BXX positions (on or after 1 Oct 99 and
             before 1 Apr 10) who attended a graduate level UFT course at one of the
             following Formal Training Units (FTU): Tinker AFB (AWACS), Geilenkirchen
             AB (NATO AWACS), Keesler AFB or Davis-Monthan AFB (ABCCC), or
             Robins AFB (Joint STARS), are considered to have entered aviation service on
             the effective date of the initial AO authorizing ABM duties. HARM offices will
             use the initial AO authorizing ABM duties to establish the ASD. For some ABMs
             this may be an AO with a 9D or 9W aviation service code (including initial ABM
             flying training at Homestead AFB). Do not include other nonrated (non-ABM) or
             non-crew duties to establish an ASD. For example: An ABM was on AOs and
             assigned ASC 9D to perform in-flight test engineer duties. These duties would not
             count in establishing the ASD.
             3.11.1.1.2.2. Members awarded the ABM rating upon graduation from FTU after
             1 Oct 99 are authorized to use flying hours and OFDA accumulated from that day
             forward towards advanced ABM ratings.
         3.11.1.1.3. Flight Surgeons. Medical officers enter an aviation career on the date of
         graduation from the Aerospace Medicine Primary Course (Course B3OBY4G1-000)
         or equivalent training. Medical students who attend this course before appointment as
         a medical officer must have an unrestricted medical license before award of the 48XX
         AFSC and the basic flight surgeon aeronautical rating.
66                                                AFI11-402_AFSOCSUP 12 JUNE 2012


        3.11.1.1.3.1. HARM offices will use the date of the Aerospace Medicine Course
        certificate as the effective date for award of the basic rating and establishment of
        the ASD for members who complete the course as qualified medical officers
        (licensed physicians). HARM offices will use the effective date of the medical
        license for award of the basic rating and establishment of the ASD for officers
        who attended the course as medical students prior to completing post graduate
        training and obtaining an unrestricted physician’s license.
        3.11.1.1.3.2. Once established, a flight surgeon’s ASD remains unadjusted except
        for breaks in military service or temporary disqualification. (Exception: Adjust
        the ASD to the formal UFT class start date for a flight surgeon with an
        established ASD who applies and is accepted for pilot, CSO, or ABM formal
        training.. This will afford the officer an opportunity to accumulate and meet
        required OFDA gate requirements within the same guidelines as other rated
        officers in continuous flying status.).
     3.11.1.1.4. Rated officers recalled to active duty and those transferred in a rated
     capacity to the USAF from other services are considered to have started an aviation
     career upon entry into training that resulted in award of the initial aeronautical rating
     or designation. The following criteria apply:
        3.11.1.1.4.1. Only initial training provided by the US Armed Forces is creditable
        in establishing the ASD. All non-US officers transferred to the USAF are
        assigned a rated ASD corresponding to the date the USAF rating is awarded by
        aeronautical rating board (ARB) action.
     3.11.1.1.5. For dual rated officers, the initial UFT training AO effective date that
     resulted in the first aeronautical rating establishes the rated ASD.
     3.11.1.1.6. Do not count officer preflight training or CEA duty when establishing a
     rated ASD. For officers who receive preflight training or were prior CEAs, the rated
     ASD is the UFT class start date (if otherwise qualified for aviation service).
     3.11.1.1.7. The rated ASD remains unchanged for officers temporarily disenrolled
     from UFT who subsequently reenter a succeeding class (for the same rating) to
     continue training toward award of a rating.
     3.11.1.1.8. For officers permanently disenrolled from UFT who later reenter training
     after an intervening period, the rated ASD is the reentry date backdated by the initial
     period of training. For example: a member began UFT on 5 Sep 05, establishing an
     ASD. He was eliminated from training after 135 days. He later qualified for reentry
     into UPT (or UCT) with a class start date of 27 Dec 06. His new rated ASD is 14 Aug
     06 (27 Dec 06 minus the original 135 days in training). AF/A3O-AT will adjust the
     ASD in the Military Personnel System, which will interface to ARMS. OFDA will
     accumulate from the new (adjusted) rated ASD forward.
     3.11.1.1.9. The rated ASD for officers with previous US military rated or designated
     service (as a commissioned or warrant officer) is the date the individual started flying
     training leading to the previous rating or designation. For prior Army warrant
     officers, the rated ASD is the date the individual received his or her warrant officer
     appointment or the flying training class entry date, whichever occurred last.
AFI11-402_AFSOCSUP 12 JUNE 2012                                                         67


        3.11.1.1.10. Once established, do not change a rated ASD except for periods the
        rating is invalid. Do not adjust it for CEA duty or other non-rated duty performed
        before establishment of the rated ASD. Effective 1 Aug 02, the CSAF approved
        adjustment of the ASD for breaks in service (FSC P or R) and non-permanent
        disqualifications. ASD adjustment is mandatory for officers who return to aviation
        service on or after 1 Aug 02 from a period of separation, retirement, or non-
        permanent disqualification. Servicing HARM offices must send an ASD adjustment
        request and a copy of the member’s aviation service worksheet to AF/A3O-AT or HQ
        AFRC/A3TB to adjust the member’s ASD. Rated officers with a break in aviation
        service prior to 1 Aug 02 who wish to have the ASD adjusted for a period of
        separation, retirement, or non-permanent disqualification must apply for an
        adjustment to AF/A3O-AT or HQ AFRC/A3TB (ARC members). Process requests
        IAW Attachment 24.
     3.11.1.2. Documentation. An officer's rated ASD is initially documented on an AO.
     The FY 99 NDAA established the ASD as the date to use when calculating the 22- and
     25-year points of aviation service.
        3.11.1.2.1. For UFT students, the PFT document contains the class start date
        (normally the ASD, see paragraph 3.11.1.1). The MPF provides the OSD. AF/A3O-
        AT may correct ASDs and OSDs in the Military Personnel System if improperly
        entered for UFT students assigned ASC 1U and forward a letter to the servicing
        HARM office (if necessary) for filing in the FRF.
        3.11.1.2.2. For flight surgeons, USAFSAM will determine the ASD based on
        graduation from Course B3OBY4G1-000.
        3.11.1.2.3. If known, include the ASD and OSD for recalled officers and inter-
        service transfers in the DAF SO.
        3.11.1.2.4. After AOs are published, only AF/A3O-AT or HQ AFRC/A3TF (ARC
        members) may adjust an officer's ASD and OSD. An aircrew member may submit a
        request for an ASD adjustment IAW Attachment 24 if the period of separation,
        retirement, or non-permanent disqualification occurred before 01 Aug 02. AF/A3O-
        AT will publish a requalification AO and forward a copy of the DAF AO and
        application to HQ AFRC/A3TB to adjust the member’s ASD (ARC members).
        AF/A3O-AT or HQ AFRC/A3TB (ARC members) will forward a copy of the ASD
        adjustment letter to the individual’s servicing HARM office. The HARM office will
        permanently file a copy of this letter in the member’s FRF and publish AOs (if
        applicable).
  3.11.2. Adjustment of Rated ASD and computation of pay entitlement.
     3.11.2.1. Once a rated ASD is adjusted by AF/A3O-AT (HQ AFRC/A3TB for ARC
     members) and the new date is updated in the Military Personnel System, Defense Finance
     System, and ARMS, the HARM office will revoke an original AO published on or after
     17 Oct 98 (1 Oct 99 for ABMs) if the adjustment invalidates the effective date of the
     original AO.
        3.11.2.1.1. For AOs published before 17 Oct 98 (1 Oct 99 for ABMs), with a
        termination date after 17 Oct 98 (1 Oct 99 for ABMs), HARM offices may be
68                                                    AFI11-402_AFSOCSUP 12 JUNE 2012


         required to amend the termination date if the ASD adjustment invalidates the original
         termination date.
     3.11.2.2. Once a rated ASD is adjusted by AF/A3O-AT or HQ AFRC/A3TB (ARC
     members) and the new date is in ARMS and the finance system, the servicing HARM
     office must publish a Military Pay Order (MPO) to adjust the member's rate of pay. The
     HARM office will stop the member's ACIP effective 16 Oct 98 (30 Sep 99 for ABMs) or
     one calendar day before the member returned to aviation service (whichever is later) and
     restart the member's ACIP effective one calendar day after the pay stop date on the same
     MPO. HARM offices will list the new ASD in the remarks section of the MPO.
         3.11.2.2.1. A pay adjustment is required to adjust a member's rate of pay based on
         the member's request to adjust years of aviation service. Regardless of the date the
         member submitted the request, the “stop pay” date will be 16 Oct 98 (30 Sep 99 for
         ABMs), or one calendar day before the member returned to aviation service,
         whichever is later. Exception: A pay adjustment is not required if the member’s rate
         of pay will not be effective for periods of breaks in service under 90 days.
     3.11.2.3. If an ASD adjustment changes a member’s flight incentive pay status from
     conditional to continuous, and the member is otherwise qualified to receive this pay, the
     servicing HARM office will start continuous pay. Note: Regardless of the period of
     ASD adjustment, a member is not entitled to ACIP or CEFIP for any period during which
     the member was not medically qualified to perform flight duty.
  3.11.3. Criteria for determining a CEA ASD. A CEA enrolled in formal weapons system
  training (where flying is required) enters an aviation career effective the class start date
  published in the program flying training (PFT) document, if medically certified for flying
  duty on that date. In all cases, an ASD will not be established before the member is medically
  certified for flying duty. The following criteria apply:
     3.11.3.1. A CEA ASD is the date the member is qualified and enters into an aviation
     career as a CEA. Members must be medically qualified for aviation service prior to
     publication of AOs to initiate aviation service or CEFIP entitlement to begin. Use the
     ASD to determine the 10-, 15-, 20-, and 25-year aviation service anniversaries (gates) for
     CEFIP entitlement.
     3.11.3.2. The ASD remains unchanged for members temporarily disenrolled from PFT
     and subsequently reentered in a succeeding class to continue training.
     3.11.3.3. For members permanently disenrolled from PFT and later reentered into
     training after an intervening period, use the reentry date backdated by the initial period of
     training to establish the new ASD.
     3.11.3.4. The ASD for a CEA with previous US military flying service is the date the
     individual started flying training leading to the rating or designation (if otherwise
     qualified).
     3.11.3.5. Documentation. A CEA’s ASD is initially documented in an AO.
         3.11.3.5.1. For PFT students, the school secretary provides the class start date. This
         date is normally used to establish the ASD. (See paragraph 3.11.3.1)
AFI11-402_AFSOCSUP 12 JUNE 2012                                                             69


  3.11.4. Computation and Adjustment of CEA Aviation Service. Once established, do not
  change a CEA’s ASD except for periods the badge is invalid. Effective 1 Aug 02, the CSAF
  approved adjustment of the ASD for breaks in service (FSC P or R) and temporary
  suspensions/non-permanent disqualifications retroactive to 1 Oct 99 or date returned to
  enlisted aircrew duty, whichever is later. ASD adjustment is mandatory for members who
  return to aviation service on or after 1 Aug 02 from a period of separation, retirement,
  temporary suspension, or non-permanent disqualification (except ASC 07). Servicing HARM
  offices must send an ASD adjustment request and a copy of the member’s aviation service
  worksheet to AF/A3O-AT or HQ AFRC/A3TB to adjust the member’s ASD. CEAs with a
  break in aviation service prior to 1 Aug 02 who wish to have the ASD adjusted for a period
  of separation, retirement, temporary suspension, or non-permanent disqualification must
  apply for an adjustment to AF/A3O-AT or HQ AFRC/A3TB (ARC members). Process
  requests IAW Attachment 24. All ASC and flying incentive pay actions effective prior to
  these dates for CEA specialties were IAW governing directives at that time. A member who
  separated from military service with an expired physical (ASC 04) and later requests
  requalification or revalidation of AOs may also apply for an adjustment of the ASD for the
  period of suspension and separation. NOTE: If a member requires an ASD adjustment, all
  periods of separation and non-permanent disqualification, to include those prior to 1 Aug 02,
  are included in the adjustment. There is no need to publish an ASD adjustment for
  individuals with longer than 25 years of aviation service unless the adjustment pushes the
  member’s aviation service to less than 25 years.
     3.11.4.1. Once a CEA ASD is adjusted by AF/A3O-AT or HQ AFRC/A3TB (ARC
     members) and the new date is updated in the Military Personnel System, Defense Finance
     System, and ARMS, the HARM office will revoke an AO published on or after 1 Oct 99
     (or conversion effective date for new CEA AFSCs approved after 1 Oct 99) if the
     adjustment invalidates the effective date of the original AO.
         3.11.4.1.1. For CEA AOs published before 1 Oct 99, with a termination date after 1
         Oct 99, HARM offices will amend the termination date if the ASD adjustment
         invalidates the original termination date.
     3.11.4.2. Once a CEA ASD is adjusted by AF/A3O-AT or HQ AFRC/A3TB (ARC
     members) and the new date is in ARMS and the finance system, the HARM office must
     publish a Military Pay Order (MPO) to adjust the member's rate of pay. The HARM
     office will stop member's CEFIP effective 30 Sep 99 or date member returned to aviation
     service (whichever is later) and then restart the member's CEFIP using the day after the
     pay stop date on the same MPO. HARM offices will list the new ASD in the remarks of
     the MPO.
         3.11.4.2.1. A pay adjustment is required to adjust a member's rate of pay based on
         the member's request to adjust years of aviation service. Regardless of the date the
         member submitted the request, the “stop pay” date will be 30 Sep 99, or the date
         member returned to aviation service, whichever is later.
     3.11.4.3. If an ASD adjustment changes a CEA’s flight incentive pay status from
     conditional to continuous, and the member is otherwise qualified to receive this pay, the
     servicing HARM office will start continuous CEFIP.
 70                                                     AFI11-402_AFSOCSUP 12 JUNE 2012


          3.11.4.3.1. Members are not entitled to CEFIP during a period in which medical
          certification was not maintained.
3.12. Reassignment to other than Aircrew Operations or RPA SO duties (1AXXX or
1UXXX). CEA may be assigned to a Special Duty Identifier (SDI) or Reporting Identifier (RI)
position before mandatory return to aviation service.
3.12. (AFSOC)Reassignment to other than Aircrew Operations or Remotely Piloted
Aircraft (RPA) Sensor Operator (SO) duties (1AXXX or 1UXXX). Group-level CEA FMs
will establish processes to manage special duty assignments of CEAs. Procedures will include
notification to the servicing HARM office of individuals who exceed tour-length limitations
established in the basic instruction and AFI 11-412, Aircrew Management, to extend or terminate
members’ AOs. Without notification, the members’ Flying Status Code (FSC) J AO will remain
in effect. (T-2)
   3.12.1. Inactivate a CEA from aviation service if the member is approved and accepted for
   the following Special Duty Identifiers and Reporting Identifiers: 8A100-Career Assistance
   Advisor; 8B000-Military Training Instructor; 8B100-Military Training Leader; 8B200-
   Academy Military Training NCO; 8D000-Linguist Debriefer; 8F000-First Sergeant; 8P000-
   Courier; 8P100-Defense Attaché Specialist; 8R000-Recruiter; 8T000-PME instructor;
   9C000-CMSgt of the Air Force; 9E000-Command Chief; 9G100-Group Superintendent;
   9L000-Interpreter/Translator; and 9S100-Technical Applications Specialist. If the member’s
   application for special duty is approved, the member, member's classification and training
   office, or unit of assignment must submit the approval paperwork to the servicing HARM
   office. Include the approval date and class start date or assignment date to the special duty
   assignment (if no class is required). The HARM office will publish an AO assigning FSC
   “J” (inactive) effective the Date Initially Entered Retraining (DIERT), class start date, or date
   reassigned to the new AFSC/SDI/RI, whichever occurs first, and forward a copy of this AO
   to AF/A3O-AT. Without formal notification and upon receipt of the Military Personnel
   System to ARMS interface report with the DAFSC change (if it includes effective date of
   change), HARM offices will publish the AO IAW AFI 11-401. NOTE: For CEAs in patient
   status, DAFSC 9P000 disqualification status is based on actual date of medical
   disqualification IAW paragraph 3.7.2.1.
       3.12.1.1. MAJCOMs may authorize operational and indoctrination flying for CEAs
       assigned to Operations Group (OG) Superintendent (9G100) positions on a case by case
       basis. MAJCOMs must consider assigned aircraft and prior aircrew experience and
       qualification when approving operational flying. Individuals approved for operational or
       indoctrination flying will be attached to a flying unit within the assigned OG and will not
       perform flying duties on aircraft not assigned or chopped to the assigned OG.
       MAJCOMs will direct the servicing HARM office to assign FSC “H” in ARMS for
       individuals approved for operational flying.
          3.12.1.1.1. (Added-AFSOC) In all cases, approval must be granted before the
          appropriate AO is published and member’s first flight. The appropriate approving
          authority is responsible for providing a copy of the approval letter to the servicing
          HARM office for permanent inclusion in the member’s flight record folder (FRF) and
          publication of AO (as required). Note: Members previously assigned to active CEA
          flying positions still require the appropriate approval before first flight as OG
AFI11-402_AFSOCSUP 12 JUNE 2012                                                                71


         superintendents (DAFSC 9G100). Submit requests for operational flying status to
         HQ AFSOC/A3TR for processing to HQ AFSOC/A3T. (T-2)
         3.12.1.1.2. (Added-AFSOC) OG superintendents approved for operational flying
         status must be experienced and be previously qualified in aircraft assigned to their
         group. Exceptions to this policy require HQ AFSOC/A3T approval. Forward
         requests to HQ AFSOC/A3TR for further coordination with the AFSOC CEA FM
         and HQ AFSOC/A3TA. (T-2)
  3.12.2. To retain the 1AXXX AFSC and the entitlement to CEFIP, CEAs are approved for
  up to two consecutive special duty assignment tours; not to exceed four years. CEAs without
  a projected assignment to flying related duties; will have their AOs terminated. Members are
  not required to submit a voluntary disqualification request; disqualification in these cases are
  effective four years from the date of the FSC “J” AO. The servicing HARM office will
  publish an AO to assign ASC 08 (Disqualified--Voluntary Request).
  3.12.3. To retain the 1UXXX AFSC, CEAs are approved for up to two consecutive special
  duty assignment tours; not to exceed four years. CEAs without a projected assignment to
  flying related duties; will have their AOs terminated. Members are not required to submit a
  voluntary disqualification request; disqualification in these cases are effective four years
  from the date of the FSC “J” AO. The servicing HARM office will publish an AO to assign
  ASC 08 (Disqualified--Voluntary Request).

                                           Chapter 4

                          THE FLYING EVALUATION BOARD

4.1. Purpose of Chapter. This chapter establishes procedures for convening, conducting, and
processing a FEB.
4.2. Applicable to Whom. FEBs are applicable to rated officers, CEAs, and non-rated officer,
enlisted aircrew members and civilian government employees only. Aircrew members have an
obligation to maintain certain professional standards and obtain and maintain aircrew
qualification. Accordingly, qualification for aviation service is subject to review when an
aircrew member’s conduct or duty performance becomes suspect.
4.3. When to convene an FEB and order an Aircrew Member before a Board. Convene an
FEB under any of the following conditions:
4.3. (AFSOC)When to convene an FEB and order an Aircrew Member before a
Board. Following the trigger event (i.e., decision point) , the convening authority will either
direct the respondent to meet an FEB, offer the respondent a waiver of FEB, or consider a waiver
request submitted by the member. Refer to Table 4.1.1., and Table 4.3., in this supplement for
specific AFSOC guidance on timelines (suspense dates) for FEBs and FEB waivers (in addition
to Table 4.1., in the basic instruction). Submit requests for extensions or delays to HQ
AFSOC/A3TR for processing to AFSOC/A3. See paragraph 4.4.5., and paragraph 4.4.7., for
FEB/FEB waiver procedures. (T-1)
   4.3.1. Extended Aviation Service Suspension or Disqualification. A rated officer or CEA
   disqualified from aviation service for longer than eight years (at the time of submission for
   requalification), or whose aviation service has been invalid for longer than eight years, must
   appear before an FEB for approval of requalification or revalidation. EXCEPTION: For
   extended medical disqualification, see paragraph 3.8
   4.3.1. (AFSOC) A rated officer or CEA disqualified from aviation service for longer than
   five years (at the time of submission for requalification), or whose aviation service has been
   invalid for longer than five years, must appear before a FEB for approval of requalification or
   revalidation. (T-1)
       4.3.1.1. Submit revalidation or requalification requests to the HARM office and
       immediate commander (use the format in Attachment 6). Forward the request with the
       commander's recommendation to the convening authority.
       4.3.1.2. Before convening an FEB, the convening authority will consider the aircrew
       member's grade, aircrew experience, availability for assignment to aircrew duties,
       requalification training, retainability, and needs of the Air Force. If the member's
       potential for aircrew duty is questionable, the convening authority should deny the
       revalidation or requalification request. Coordinate active-duty aircrew requirements and
       assignment availability with HQ AFPC.
   4.3.2. Lack of Proficiency. Cause exists to convene an FEB when an aircrew member
   shows a lack of aircrew proficiency. This may include a lack of knowledge of flying
   directives or a negligent violation of flying procedures. This does not apply to aircrew
   members enrolled in formal flying training programs.
AFI11-402_AFSOCSUP 12 JUNE 2012                                                               73


  4.3.3. Failure to Meet Training Standards. Failure to meet academic or flying standards
  while enrolled in a USAF directed formal flying training course requires an examination of
  the aircrew member's potential for continued aviation service. An FEB (or FEB waiver)
  evaluates retention in (or removal from) training and potential for continued aviation service.
  The authority for removal from training for failure to meet training standards is the FEB/FEB
  waiver approval authority (paragraphs 4.4.7 or 4.6.8). Exception: MAJCOMs may
  determine when the academic or flying standards of a formal flying training course exceeds
  the AF standards for the rated/CEA specialty, for example, the training standards of formal
  instructor courses generally exceed the standards for non-instructor courses. In these courses,
  when an individual is recommended for elimination for failure to meet training standards, an
  FEB waiver is appropriate. The member must maintain basic and mission qualification
  (where appropriate).
  4.3.3. (AFSOC) Rated officers or CEA members who have completed Aircrew
  Fundamentals who attempt to DOR (or submit an SIE request) from a formal flying training
  course will not be afforded FEB waiver consideration. These members must be considered
  for FEB action under paragraph 4.3.7.3., in the basic instruction. See paragraphs 3.9.3.13.,
  4.3.7.3, 4.4.6., and 4.5.6., in the basic instruction and this supplement. (T-1)
     4.3.3.1. Do not convene an FEB for non-rated officers enrolled in Undergraduate Flying
     Training or for students enrolled in initial CEA Formal Flying Training courses that have
     not successfully completed a mission qualification flight evaluation. The preferred
     method for removing these students from aviation service is via a Training Review
     Board/Commander’s Review Process. (See paragraph 3.9.1).
     4.3.3.2. Airsickness is not cause for medical disqualification unless there is evidence of
     organic or psychiatric pathology. However, aircrew members may meet a FEB for failure
     to meet training standards if airsickness interferes with flying duties and prevents
     completion of training. Forward aero-medical summaries of airsickness cases through
     medical channels to MAJCOM/SG, before convening the FEB. The aircrew member may
     offer as evidence the results of any standard or experimental treatment program designed
     to treat airsickness. Do not use non-participation in an experimental program as evidence
     of a lack of desire to fly.
  4.3.4. Lack of Judgment. Cause exists to convene a FEB when an aircrew member shows
  lack of judgment in performing aircrew duties.
  4.3.5. Aircrew Requirements. Cause exists to convene an FEB when an aircrew member
  fails to meet ground or flying training requirements IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 1 and MDS
  specific instructions, or annual physical examination requirements published in AFI 11-401
  and AFI 48-123, Volume 3.
  4.3.6. Violation of Other Aviation Instructions and Procedures. Cause exists to convene
  an FEB when an aircrew member has committed an intentional violation of aviation
  instructions or procedures.
  4.3.7. Habits, Traits, Characteristics. Cause exists to convene an FEB when an aircrew
  member exhibits habits, traits of character, or personality characteristics that make it
  undesirable to continue using the aircrew member in flying duties. Do not administratively
  withdraw an aircrew member from a formal flying training course when the individual is
 74                                                   AFI11-402_AFSOCSUP 12 JUNE 2012


   being eliminated under Habits, Traits, or Characteristics. Primary reasons to convene a FEB
   under this paragraph include:
      4.3.7.1. A suspected fear of flying.
      4.3.7.2. Chronic airsickness without an organic or psychiatric pathology. Forward
      aeromedical summaries of airsickness cases through medical channels to MAJCOM/SG
      before convening the FEB. The aircrew member may offer as evidence the results of any
      standard or experimental treatment program designed to treat airsickness. Do not use
      non-participation in an experimental program as evidence of a lack of desire to fly.
      4.3.7.3. Attempts to limit aviation service, such as DOR from formal training courses,
      requests for voluntary disqualification based on a personal desire to terminate aircrew
      duty, or requests to decline a particular assignment following formal training.
      4.3.7.3. (AFSOC) An FEB waiver is not appropriate for rated and CEA aircrew
      members (completed Aircrew Fundamentals) who attempt to DOR or submit an SIE
      request from a formal flying training. (T-2)
      4.3.7.4. An FEB is not for punitive disciplinary action. It is not a substitute for action
      under the UCMJ or any other administrative directives. NOTE: Do not use any aviation
      service action as a substitute for administrative or disciplinary action. Incidents that
      involve fitness or punitive liability make an aircrew member liable to the same actions as
      a non-aircrew member. When an aircrew member exhibits questionable professional
      qualities, consider initiating action outlined in paragraph 3.7.1.6 After completing action
      under paragraph 3.7.1.6, convene an FEB if the member's potential for continued
      aviation service is still in question.
4.4. Conducting Flying Evaluation Boards. (See Attachment 11 – Attachment 23.).
   4.4.1. Board Action Overview. An FEB should review and discuss, in a fair and impartial
   manner, all information relevant to an aircrew member's aviation and professional
   qualifications. The board receives exhibits and hears testimony when all required parties are
   present and witnesses are sworn and subject to cross-examination. Counsel may represent the
   respondent. An FEB is not an adversarial proceeding. The respondent may request military
   counsel of his/her own choosing (if available) or civilian counsel (at his/her own expense).
   The military counsel's commander determines availability. (Rules for determining
   availability of counsel for courts-martial are not applicable to requests for counsel for an
   FEB.) Although the board adheres to a semiformal procedure, avoid informal conversation,
   comments off the record, and reference to extraneous matters. In closed deliberations, board
   members discuss and evaluate the evidence to develop findings and recommendations.
   Before adjournment, findings and recommendations are announced when all required parties
   are present. The convening authority and subordinate MAJCOM authorities review the FEB
   report before the respondent’s MAJCOM commander takes final action. Exception: The
   AETC/CC is the final approval authority for all FEB actions involving active duty members
   attending AETC formal flying training courses. Apply these guidelines:
      4.4.1.1. Appearance of more than one respondent before a board is prohibited.
      4.4.1.2. The board does not make recommendations on disciplinary actions.
      4.4.1.3. Recommendations of an FEB are advisory and not binding.
AFI11-402_AFSOCSUP 12 JUNE 2012                                                               75


       4.4.1.4. AFI 51-602, Boards of Officers does not apply.
       4.4.1.5. If possible, do not include classified information in FEB proceedings.
       4.4.1.5. (AFSOC) Depending on the circumstances, classified information may be
       relevant to the FEB and therefore, must be presented during the board hearing. However,
       the introduction of classified information presents a challenge with respect to court
       reporters and other key participants who may not have the necessary clearance for the
       information presented. Board members should limit the introduction of classified
       information and should consider the following:
          4.4.1.5.1. (Added-AFSOC) Present evidence in a manner that avoids discussing
          classified information. However, there may be times when classified information
          must be introduced to ensure evidence is fully developed and all facts are identified.
          (T-1)
          4.4.1.5.2. (Added-AFSOC) Ask the respondent’s counsel to agree to a stipulation of
          fact that can avoid the presentation of classified evidence. Contact the base legal
          office for assistance on drafting a stipulation of fact. (T-1)
          4.4.1.5.3. (Added-AFSOC) Contact the base legal office if the board requires a
          court reporter with a specific security clearance. However, the reporter may need to
          be read into certain programs, so court reporter clearance may need to be coordinated
          with the unit security manager. (T-1)
          4.4.1.5.4. (Added-AFSOC) Ensure written transcript and other supporting
          documents (e.g., exhibits) are properly marked IAW classification guidance when
          classified material and/or information is included in these documents. (T-0)
          4.4.1.5.5. (Added-AFSOC) Notify as soon as possible when the determination is
          made that classified information will be included in the FEB report (package). (T-1)
       4.4.1.6. In accordance with AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports do not allow
       privileged safety information or documents to be introduced into the FEB.
       4.4.1.7. The flying unit commander, the member’s commander, or flying training school
       commander initiates the FEB process for convening authority review/action IAW Table
       4.1. Send requests for extensions to established timelines to the MAJCOM/A3.
          4.4.1.7.1. (Added-AFSOC) Use the SSS routing template in Table 4.2., in this
          supplement to request FEB/VILO action by a convening authority or Table 4.5., in
          this supplement to request FEB waiver action by AFSOC/A3. (T-3)

Notes:
1. FEB waivers in lieu of an FEB are not an option for aircrew members assigned to operational
flying units being considered for FEB action.

2. The SARM office will ensure mandatory exhibits are included in the FEB waiver package
before staffing to the package to the next office for coordination. Refer to paragraphs 4.4.9 –
4.4.9.6 and Attachment 21 in the basic instruction.

3. The HARM office will ensure suspension action is accomplished IAW paragraph 3.6.3.1 in the
basic instruction. Additionally, the HARM office will ensure ARMS products included in the
waiver package are current and reflect the respondent‘s suspension (ASC 04) status.

          4.4.1.7.2. (Added-AFSOC) The unit commander will ensure the respondent is
          assigned Assignment Availability Code (AAC) 21 in the Military Personnel Data
          System (MilPDS) IAW paragraph 3.7.1.1.6., in the basic instruction. Do not allow
          the member to go on temporary duty (TDY) or deployment until FEB action is
          complete. Except for extenuating circumstances, commanders should limit approval
          of leave requests by respondents until after boards (hearings) have
          convened/adjourned. (T-1)
      4.4.1.8. (Added-AFSOC) Convening authorities will submit extension requests to HQ
      AFSOC/A3TR for processing to AFSOC/A3 for approval. Requests will cite reasons for
      delay. (T-1)
      4.4.1.9. (Added-AFSOC) Unit commanders, convening authorities, and board members
      (including recorders) should consult with the base CHARM and base legal office as
      required. Additional information on the command‘s FEB process including the AFSOC
      FEB Guide and templates are provided on the AFSOC FEB SharePoint site located at
      uniform               resource         locator         (URL)              https://eis
      afsoc.af.mil/sites/A3/A3T/A3TM/FEB/default.aspx. Contact HQ AFSOC/A3TR for
      access to the site. (T-3)
          4.4.1.9.1. (Added-AFSOC) The CHARM is the overall office of primary
          responsibility (OPR) for the FEB process at the wing level and below. However,
          once an FEB is initiated, the recorder is responsible for the overall administrative and
          processing duties outlined in paragraphs 4.7.5.–4.7.5.3., of the basic instruction and
          this supplement. (T-2)
      4.4.1.10. (Added-AFSOC) See the FEB process for convening authority review/action
      IAW Table 4.1. AFSOC specific coordination requirements are found in Table 4.1.1.,
      Table 4.2., and Table 4.3. (T-3)
          4.4.1.10.1. (Added-AFSOC) A unit or group commander in consultation with the
          convening authority may appoint an interim recorder to coordinate pre-board
          requirements and manage other administrative duties outlined in paragraph 4.7.5., of
          the basic instruction and this supplement. (T-3)
  4.4.2. Convening Authority Designation. A flying unit commander (wing or comparable
  level (above group-level)) normally convenes an FEB. In cases when a geographically
  separated flying unit must convene an FEB, the flying wing commander within the flying
AFI11-402_AFSOCSUP 12 JUNE 2012                                                              81


  unit's chain of command will be designated the convening authority. For members attending
  a formal flying training course, the host flying wing located on the same installation will
  serve as the convening authority. Exception: For members attending undergratuate formal
  flying training at the CEA Center of Excellence, the AETC/A2/3/10 is the Convening
  Authority. For a tenant flying unit (including Direct Reporting Unit or Field Operating
  Agency of a higher headquarters) without a wing commander in the chain of command, the
  commander of the host flying wing located on the same installation will serve as the
  convening authority. MAJCOM commanders designate a convening authority when required
  for individuals assigned to the MAJCOM or intermediate commands above wing or
  comparable level (e.g., Numbered Air Force). For members assigned to the Air Staff, the
  Chief of Staff has delegated the authority to designate a convening authority to the Deputy
  Chief of Staff, Operations, Plans & Requirements, AF/A3/5 and the Director of Operations
  and Training, AF/A3O. An officer designated as convening authority by MAJCOM
  commanders or the CSAF (or CSAF's designee) must be a flying unit commander, at wing
  level or higher. In appropriate circumstances, the CSAF may direct the convening of an FEB
  at any organizational level.
  4.4.3. Membership Selection. An FEB must provide a fair and impartial hearing. Ensure
  voting members have not been directly involved in the case and are the best qualified, most
  senior aircrew members available. If necessary, commanders may request TDY assistance to
  make up the FEB. NOTE: In appropriate situations the convening authority should consider
  selecting board members from outside the respondent’s unit.
  4.4.3. (AFSOC) Commanders must ensure members identified to the convening authority
  as primary and alternate board member candidates are available if the board is convened.
  Members must be available at least 60 calendar days after the board is adjourned or when the
  official board transcript is reviewed and signed by all board members, whichever occurs first.
  (T-2)
     4.4.3.1. Voting members will be qualified for aviation service in an active ASC and be
     senior in rank to the respondent. Three voting members constitute a quorum. Appoint one
     additional aircrew member to act as a nonvoting recorder.
     4.4.3.1. (AFSOC) IAW paragraph 4.7.5., in the basic instruction, aircrew members
     appointed as recorders are relieved of all other duties. If extenuating circumstances
     require a recorder to be replaced before MAJCOM/CC final action, the new recorder will
     be appointed in writing (special order) the convening authority.          Notify HQ
     AFSOC/A3TR when this occurs. (T-1)
         4.4.3.1.1. Do not appoint enlisted members to FEBs convened for officers, or officers
         to FEBs convened for enlisted members.
     4.4.3.2. Do not appoint the convening authority as a member of the board and do not
     appoint a judge advocate as an assistant recorder. A judge advocate may advise the
     recorder, but may not be present during closed sessions.
     4.4.3.3. Voting members should be in the same aircrew specialty, (e.g., pilot, CSO, or
     flight engineer), as the respondent. To the greatest extent possible, at least one voting
     member should have the same primary duty AFSC as the respondent. When evaluating a
     flight surgeon, a flight surgeon must be a voting member of the board.
82                                                  AFI11-402_AFSOCSUP 12 JUNE 2012


     4.4.3.4. A judge advocate may be appointed as a nonvoting legal advisor to advise on
     procedural matters and ensure the respondent receives a fair, impartial, and non-
     adversarial hearing. If appointed, a judge advocate may not be present at closed sessions.
         4.4.3.4.1. A legal advisor will provide an FEB procedural briefing scheduled for the
         senior board member and the recorder.
             4.4.3.4.1.1. (Added-AFSOC) The recorder will consult with the Senior Board
             Member (SBM) and the base legal office prior to contacting the Area Defense
             Counsel (ADC) to schedule the board. (T-1)
     4.4.3.5. A flight surgeon may be appointed as a nonvoting member when a medical
     problem may be a significant contributing factor in the case.
     4.4.3.6. If an ARC aircrew member requires an FEB during a formal flying training
     course with an active duty unit, the active duty wing commander convenes the FEB at the
     base of training. In these situations, one of the board members must be a Guard or Air
     Force Reserve rated officer (as appropriate), preferably from the individual's home unit.
     In the case of host/associate/blended wings, one of the board members will be of the
     same component as the respondent.
         4.4.3.6.1. When practical, boards convened to consider non-EAD USAFR aircrew
         members are composed of Air Reserve Technician (ART) or non-technician reservist
         aircrew members.
         4.4.3.6.2. When practical, boards convened to consider non-EAD ANG aircrew
         members are composed of ANG aircrew members.
         4.4.3.6.3. (Added-AFSOC) For active duty aircrew members attending an AFSOTC
         formal schoolhouse with active/reserve aircrew members assigned, ensure at least one
         active duty member is on the board. (T-2)
  4.4.4. Establishing a Convening Date. Normally, convene the board within 30 days after
  the convening authority appoints the board (Attachments 12 and 13).
  4.4.5. Respondent Notification and Acknowledgment. Notify the respondent in writing to
  appear before an FEB (Attachment 14). The notification will include: why, when, and where
  the board will meet, witnesses to be called, rights of the respondent for representation by
  counsel, and the board's responsibility to arrange for the appearance of military witnesses
  requested by the respondent. State the basis for convening the board (paragraph 4.3) and all
  allegations. The respondent must reply within 48 hours (two duty days). Provide a copy of
  this notification to the HARM office. The HARM office will publish an AO assigning ASC
  04 effective the date of the notification letter.
  4.4.5. (AFSOC) Once the decision (trigger point) is made that FEB action is required,
  commanders (including convening authorities) will ensure FEB respondent notification
  letters (Attachment 14 in the basic instruction) are processed and served in a timely manner
  within the timelines outlined Table 4.1., in the basic instruction and this supplement, and
  Table 4.1.1., in this supplement. (T-1)
     4.4.5.1. (Added-AFSOC) Convening authority notification letters will be date stamped
     the date respondents are officially notified in-person of FEB action.           Note:
     Commander’s intent is for respondents to be officially notified of FEB action (via
AFI11-402_AFSOCSUP 12 JUNE 2012                                                              83


     Attachment 14 in the basic instruction) on the same day convening authorities sign the
     notification letter. (T-1)
  4.4.6. Voluntary Disqualification from Aviation Service in Lieu of FEB (VILO). After
  being notified of the FEB, the member may request voluntary disqualification from aviation
  service in lieu of the FEB, or request a waiver of FEB to return to previously qualified
  aircraft if enrolled in flying training (paragraph 4.4.7). This is not to be confused with DOR
  as appropriate for members in undergraduate training. No option for DOR exists after an
  officer is awarded a rating or a CEA successfully completes Aircrew Fundamentals. VILO is
  only in lieu of FEB action. For VILO, the respondent makes an endorsement to this effect
  when acknowledging receipt of the notification letter. The respondent must prepare a request
  for VILO (Attachment 15) and submit it to the convening authority through the immediate
  commander within five workdays of acknowledging receipt of the FEB notification letter. If
  the convening authority approves the request for VILO, delay FEB action until the next
  higher approval authorities and the MAJCOM act on the request. If disapproved at any level,
  resume FEB proceedings immediately.
  4.4.6. (AFSOC) The “no option for DOR” includes an SIE request after an officer is
  awarded a rating or a CEA successfully completes Aircrew Fundamentals. (T-2)
     4.4.6.1. Forward the VILO request and documentation, including exhibits required by
     paragraph 4.4.9, through normal FEB processing channels to the MAJCOM commander
     (or the CSAF's delegatee in the case of an Air Staff level respondent). The review
     process and administrative requirements are the same as those required for a report of
     FEB proceedings. Although the MAJCOM commander is the final approval authority,
     reviewing authorities at any level may disapprove the request and direct an FEB.
     Approved VILO packages will be forwarded to AF/A3O-AT for publication of a DAF
     AO assigning ASC 05. This AO will have the same effective date as the original
     suspension AO.
     4.4.6.1. (AFSOC) Recorders (or designated representatives) will ensure VILO requests
     include the mandatory exhibits outlined in paragraphs 4.4.9.1.–4.4.9.6., in the basic
     instruction. ARMS products will be dated on or after the date the member was suspended
     from aviation service. (T-2)
         4.4.6.1.1. (Added-AFSOC) Staff VILO requests in the same manner as FEB reports
         (packages) IAW Tables 4.7., and 4.8., in this supplement. Commanders, convening
         authorities, and higher headquarters reviewing authorities will ensure VILO
         coordination receives priority processing. (T-2)
         4.4.6.1.2. (Added-AFSOC) Recorders (or designated representatives) will ensure
         VILO requests are monitored and updated on the AFSOC FEB dashboard maintained
         on the AFSOC FEB SharePoint site. (T-3)
     4.4.6.2. VILO approval: Permanently disqualifies an aircrew member from aviation
     service, prohibits the member from wearing the aviation badge associated with the VILO,
     and makes the member immediately eligible for involuntary separation or reassignment
     to non-aircrew duty, as determined by the needs of the Air Force. (Separation action for
     commissioned officers requires Secretary of the Air Force approval.).
84                                                  AFI11-402_AFSOCSUP 12 JUNE 2012


     4.4.6.3. A VILO is considered a FEB action and requires the same coordination and
     approval as a FEB. NOTE: Do not recommend approval of a VILO unless the
     supporting documentation clearly shows an FEB would recommend disqualification.
  4.4.7. FEB Waivers. A FEB waiver is considered a FEB action and requires the same
  coordination and approval as a FEB. FEB waiver process is not an appropriate means to
  disqualify a member.
  4.4.7. (AFSOC) Refer to paragraphs 4.4.7.1., or 4.4.7.2., in this supplement (as applicable)
  for FEB waiver approval authority. FEB waiver requests are staffed IAW Tables 4.4., 4.5.,
  and 4.6., in this supplement. In all cases, FEB waivers will be staffed through the convening
  authority.     Commanders, convening authorities, and higher headquarters reviewing
  authorities will ensure FEB waiver coordination receives priority processing. Note: An FEB
  waiver in lieu of FEB action is not an option for aircrew members assigned to operational
  units being recommended for FEB action. (T-1)
     4.4.7.1. For rated officers and CEAs enrolled in any USAF directed formal flying
     training programs that were previously qualified in another aircraft (for First Assignment
     Instructor Pilots (FAIPs) see paragraph 4.4.7.2), or previously qualified in a different
     crew position, the member or the convening authority may request an FEB waiver
     (Attachment 29). The convening authority will submit or forward waiver requests
     through command channels only when convinced the reviewing authorities would
     recommend the member remain qualified in the aircraft and/or crew position in which
     he/she was previously qualified. If there is any doubt regarding potential for continued
     aviation service, direct an FEB. Forward FEB waiver requests through command
     channels to the MAJCOM commander for final approval. The MAJCOM Commander
     may delegate approval authority no lower than the MAJCOM/A3. Reviewing authorities
     at any level may deny the waiver request and direct an FEB. Note: See paragraph
     3.7.1.1.4. if member is returned to flying status in the aircraft in which he or she was
     previously qualified as the result of FEB waiver action.
     4.4.7.1. (AFSOC) Rated Officers and CEAs Enrolled in an AFSOTC Formal Flying
     Course that Were Previously Qualified in Another Aircraft. When the respondent
     chooses to submit a waiver request or the convening authority offers the respondent a
     waiver, ensure the respondent is referred to military legal counsel (normally the ADC)
     prior to submitting a waiver to HQ AFSOC. Approval authority is delegated to
     AFSOC/A3 for AFSOC members. Approval for National Guard Bureau (NGB) or
     AFRC members is handled through their respective chain of commands. Contact
     NGB/A3OS or HQ AFRC/A3TB to determine the appropriating approval authority.
     Note: Rated officers or CEA members who have completed Aircrew Fundamentals who
     attempt to DOR or submit an SIE request from a formal flying training course will not be
     afforded FEB waiver consideration. (T-1)
         4.4.7.1.1. (Added-AFSOC) Convening authorities will submit or forward waiver
         requests involving ARC members directly to the members‘ MAJCOM/A3 for review
         and further processing. (T-1)
     4.4.7.2. FEB waivers are also applicable for a training pipeline student (recent UFT
     graduate, never assigned to an MDS) and FAIPs undergoing Pilot Instructor Training
     (PIT), Initial Fighter Fundamentals (IFF) or assigned as a student in a fighter/bomber-
AFI11-402_AFSOCSUP 12 JUNE 2012                                                              85


     specific formal training unit (FTU), when the member is being considered for placement
     in multi-placed, crew-type aircraft or Remotely Piloted Vehicle. Forward FEB waiver
     requests to the MAJCOM commander for final approval. The MAJCOM Commander
     may delegate approval authority no lower than the MAJCOM/A3. (Exception: The
     AETC/CC may delegate waiver approval authority to the 19 AF/CC for AETC pipeline
     students and FAIPs.) Reviewing authorities at any level may deny the waiver request and
     direct an FEB. If there is any doubt regarding potential for continued aviation service,
     direct an FEB. Note: See paragraph 3.7.1.1.5. if member is placed in multi-placed,
     crew-type aircraft training as the result of FEB waiver action. An FEB waiver is not
     appropriate for former non-USAF helicopter pilots attending SUPT or FWQ unless they
     are previously qualified in a USAF helicopter and can be reassigned to a helicopter flying
     position.
     4.4.7.2. (AFSOC) Pipeline Students (Recent UFT Graduates, Never Assigned to an
     MDS) Enrolled in an AFSOC Formal Flying Course. If the convening authority is
     convinced that the reviewing authorities would recommend the respondent remain
     qualified in the aircraft and/or crew position in which previously qualified, the convening
     authority will utilize an FEB waiver to conserve time and resources. When a respondent
     chooses to submit a waiver request or the convening authority offers the respondent a
     waiver, ensure the respondent is referred to military legal counsel (normally the ADC)
     prior to submitting a waiver to HQ AFSOC. Approval authority is delegated to
     AFSOC/A3 for AFSOC members. Approval for NGB or AFRC members is handled
     through their respective chains of command. Contact NGB/A3OS or HQ AFRC/A3TB
     to determine the appropriating approval authority. Note: Rated officers or CEA
     members who have completed Aircrew Fundamentals who attempt to DOR or submit an
     SIE request from a formal flying training course will not be afforded FEB waiver
     consideration. (T-1)
        4.4.7.2.1. (Added-AFSOC) Convening authorities will submit or forward waiver
        requests involving AFRC members directly to the members‘ MAJCOM/A3 for
        review and further processing. (T-1)
     4.4.7.3. When the convening authority requests waiver of an FEB, the convening
     authority will notify the respondent in writing and direct the HARM office to suspend the
     member’s aviation service. The HARM office will publish an AO assigning ASC 04
     effective the date of convening authority’s notification letter to the member, and
     terminate flight pay effective one calendar day prior to the effective date of the
     suspension AO. The respondent must reply within 48 hours (two duty days). The
     respondent has the option of requesting an FEB.
     4.4.7.4. (Added-AFSOC) The basis for the waiver is failure to meet training standards
     IAW paragraph 4.4.3., in the basic instruction. (T-1)
        4.4.7.4.1. (Added-AFSOC) The respondent’s unsatisfactory flying training progress
        is caused by factors unique to the training program. (T-1)
        4.4.7.4.2. (Added-AFSOC) The respondent performs basic flying skills in a
        satisfactory manner confirmed by his or her completion of a basic qualification check,
        in the current or a previous aircraft, according to AFI 11-202, Volume 2, Aircrew
 86                                                  AFI11-402_AFSOCSUP 12 JUNE 2012


          Standardization/Evaluation Program, or previous qualification in another crew
          position. (T-1)
          4.4.7.4.3. (Added-AFSOC) The respondent          displays   qualities   of   judgment
          commensurate with experience level. (T-1)
          4.4.7.4.4. (Added-AFSOC) The respondent does not display dangerous tendencies
          in the performance of basic flying maneuvers common to the rated or CEA specialty.
          (T-1)
          4.4.7.4.5. (Added-AFSOC) The respondent is medically qualified for aviation
          service. (T-1)
          4.4.7.4.6. (Added-AFSOC) The respondent’s training progress in academic and
          simulator areas are otherwise satisfactory. (T-1)
          4.4.7.4.7. (Added-AFSOC) The respondent is otherwise assignable to a previously
          qualified aircraft or for a pipeline student, the convening authority is convinced the
          respondent should remain qualified for aviation service in another airframe. (T-1)

Notes:
1. FEB reports (packages) do not require squadron and group coordination. Once the FEB report is
assembled, the recorder will submit the FEB report to the base legal office for coordination before
forwarding it to the convening authority (i.e., wing commander).

2. The recorder will ensure mandatory exhibits are included in the FEB report before staffing to the base
legal office for coordination. Refer to paragraphs 4.4.9.––4.4.9.6., and Attachment 21 in the basic
instruction. Use the FEB report checklist in Attachment 33 of this supplement. A stand-alone version is
maintained on the AFSOC FEB SharePoint site.

     4.4.8. Submitting Evidence and Exhibits-General. FEBs require evidence that accurately
     fixes dates, places, persons, and events. All reasonable available evidence must be examined,
     such as:
        4.4.8.1. Sworn testimony by witnesses appearing before the board.
        4.4.8.2. Depositions.
        4.4.8.3. Certificates of officers and affidavits of enlisted personnel and civilians.
        4.4.8.4. Original or authenticated copies of records and documents.
        4.4.8.5. Medical Record. DD Form 2807-1, Report of Medical History, and DD Form
        2808, Report of Medical Examination, or other valid forms appropriate for the medical
        examination, certifying medical qualification for flying duty in the requested aircrew
        specialty (e.g., AF Form 1042), completed within the past year. MAJCOM/SG will
        validate all medical forms submitted meet AFI 44-170 and AFI 48-123.
        4.4.8.6. Other writings and exhibits, such as reports of Faculty Boards. In a rehearing,
        furnish the new board a copy of the prior board's report, less prejudicial material as
        determined by the servicing staff judge advocate. Include findings and recommendations.
        4.4.8.7. When using publications or instructions as exhibits in the case file (for example,
        aircraft technical orders, Air Force Instructions, syllabi, and the like), submit only the
        applicable pages. Annotate the publication or instruction number, title, date, change
        number (if applicable), and page number on the exhibit.
        4.4.8.8. Do not include any privileged safety information, including Part II of safety
        reports, status of final safety messages, and any other reports or documents containing
        privileged safety information as defined in AFI 91-204.
90                                                   AFI11-402_AFSOCSUP 12 JUNE 2012


  4.4.9. Mandatory Exhibits. The FEB report must include certified copies of:
     4.4.9.1. DD Form 2808 or other valid forms appropriate for the medical examination,
     certifying current medical qualification for flying duty in the current or requested aircrew
     specialty (e.g. AF Form 1042). MAJCOM/SG will validate all medical forms submitted
     meet AFI 44-170 and AFI 48-123 requirements.
     4.4.9.2. AOs awarding aeronautical rating or aviation badge, and ASC.
     4.4.9.3. Any orders disqualifying the respondent from aviation service or imposing
     restrictions on aviation service.
     4.4.9.4. The respondent's current ARMS IDS, ITS, IFR, and FHR.
     4.4.9.5. Those parts of the flight evaluation folder (FEF) documenting the respondent’s
     aircrew qualification history, such as AF Form 942, AF Form 1381, USAF Certification
     of Aircrew Training, and AF Form 8 or AF Form 8a.
     4.4.9.6. Training records, to include UFT/FFT and ARMS training summaries.
  4.4.10. Respondent’s Right to Review Evidence. Give the respondent a chance to review
  all documents submitted as evidence. This should, if practical, be accomplished with
  sufficient time for the respondent to adequately review any proposed evidence.
  4.4.11. Use of Evidence by the Board. FEBs are not bound by the formal rules of evidence
  prescribed for trials by courts-martial. However, a general observance of these rules
  promotes orderly procedures and a thorough investigation. The fact that evidence would not
  be admissible in a judicial proceeding does not preclude its use in an FEB.
     4.4.11.1. The decision as to proof of authenticity rests with the senior board member.
     The board may dispense with formal proof of authenticity if it is impractical to produce a
     witness to identify the document. In most cases, authenticity may be established by
     stipulation. Copies are acceptable as exhibits if and when the recorder has authenticated
     each copy. (See Rule 1004, Federal Rules of Evidence.) Copies of public record are
     sufficiently authenticated when obtained by or for the board.
     4.4.11.2. The recorder and respondent (or the respondent's counsel) may make a written
     or oral stipulation regarding any fact or expected testimony of a particular witness as if
     that witness testified at the hearing. However, the stipulation need not be accepted by the
     board and should not be accepted if any doubt exists as to the respondent's understanding
     of it or of the consequences of its admission.
     4.4.11.3. If documentary evidence provides information relative to the matters being
     considered and such certificates, affidavits, depositions, or stipulations are accepted as
     exhibits during board proceedings, it is not necessary to reestablish such points in actual
     testimony. However, a witness should identify any evidence the witness originated.
  4.4.12. Evidence Leading to Additional Allegations. Review all facts relative to an aircrew
  member’s aircrew qualifications. If facts are made available that do not allude to the
  allegations in the notification letter, follow the procedure in Attachment 19. If evidence
  indicates lack of supervision or supervisory error, explore the subject and consider it for
  inclusion as a board finding.
AFI11-402_AFSOCSUP 12 JUNE 2012                                                              91


  4.4.13. Calling Witnesses. Call military witnesses to appear if they are reasonably available
  and can present material evidence. The senior board member will determine, with the advice
  of the legal advisor, whether a witness is reasonably available. If not reasonably available,
  depositions or telephonic testimony are acceptable. If using telephonic testimony, include a
  transcript in the report. Although civilian witnesses may appear, an FEB cannot compel their
  attendance. (Articles 46 and 47, UCMJ, do not apply to FEB proceedings) Consult with the
  servicing staff judge advocate as to the procedures to request the presence of civilian DoD
  employees. Unless specifically authorized, the government does not reimburse a civilian
  witness. Commanders who exercise review authority will not participate in the review
  process if called as a witness during the FEB proceedings.
  4.4.14. Who Will Attend FEB Sessions. During all FEB proceedings except closed
  sessions, a reporter or stenographer, a recorder, and the respondent with counsel are present.
     4.4.14.1. Witnesses are in the board room only when presenting evidence. Keep
     witnesses to be heard or recalled separate from the board room.
     4.4.14.2. FEBs are closed administrative proceedings. Spectators are not permitted.
  4.4.15. Administering Oaths. Any member of an FEB can administer oaths; however, this
  duty is usually delegated to the recorder.
     4.4.15.1. FEB members need not be sworn.
     4.4.15.2. The reporter and each witness are sworn.
  4.4.16. Challenging Board Members (Attachment 17). The respondent may challenge
  voting members for cause. The burden of sustaining a challenge is on the respondent, and the
  board may take testimony on the challenge in open session.
     4.4.16.1. Disputed challenges are voted on by the voting board in closed session with the
     challenged member excluded. A majority vote is required to sustain a challenge to
     remove a challenged member. (A tie vote disqualifies the member challenged from the
     board.) The remaining members constitute the board, except additional members are
     detailed when the board is reduced below a quorum. Peremptory challenges are not
     authorized.
     4.4.16.2. If it is necessary to replace a member, the hearing proceeds from that point
     after the opportunity to challenge the new member has been afforded the respondent. If
     recorded, all proceedings will be played back for the new board member. The respondent,
     respondent's counsel, recorder, and legal advisor have the option to be present when the
     tapes are played. If proceedings have been transcribed, the new board member should
     read the record. The new board member must certify in writing he or she has listened to
     or read the complete record.
  4.4.17. Soliciting Testimony. The respondent may not be compelled to testify. However, if
  the respondent elects to testify under oath, the respondent is subject to questioning by the
  recorder and the board members as with all other witnesses. If the testimony of a military
  witness raises the possibility of implicating that witness of criminal misconduct, the senior
  board member will adjourn the proceedings and consult with servicing staff judge advocate.
  If the senior board member determines after such consultation that the witness may
  incriminate himself, the senior board member will not proceed further with taking testimony
92                                                   AFI11-402_AFSOCSUP 12 JUNE 2012


  from that witness without advising the witness of his rights in accordance with Article 31,
  UCMJ. If the same situation applies with regard to a civilian witness, consult with the
  servicing staff judge advocate before proceeding with taking testimony from that witness. If
  the respondent, or the respondent's counsel, is allowed to cross-examine all witnesses, call
  witnesses, and present evidence in the respondent's behalf. At any time during the
  proceedings, the respondent or counsel may submit a written brief covering any of the
  matters under investigation. Give the respondent full opportunity to answer all allegations
  before concluding the proceedings.
  4.4.18. Profession of Fear of Flying. If an aircrew member professes a fear of flying in
  testimony before an FEB, the board adjourns while the member is legally counseled (see
  paragraph 3.7.1.3). After counseling, give the member an opportunity to retract the fear of
  flying statement. If retracted, the board resumes and it is made a matter of record. If the
  member does not retract the fear of flying statement, the board ends its proceedings and fear
  of flying procedures are initiated IAW paragraph 3.7.1.3.2
  4.4.19. Reviewing Previous Aircrew History. Regardless of the reason for convening an
  FEB, the board's recommendations are based on facts including all available evidence of the
  respondent’s aircrew performance history, to include UFT/FFT. During proceedings,
  determine whether the respondent previously submitted a voluntary request for suspension or
  disqualification from aviation service. Determination is also made on whether the respondent
  previously met an FEB or Faculty Board that resulted in elimination from a course of training
  related to the aeronautical ratings or designations possessed.
  4.4.20. Board Findings. On completion of the hearing, clear the boardroom except for voting
  board members. Any phase of the hearing may be restudied. However, any reexamination of
  witnesses must be done in open session.
     4.4.20.1. The board should consider extenuating circumstances surrounding the case.
     Extenuating circumstances may indicate whether the respondent had control over the
     factors involved.
     4.4.20.2. To resolve conflicting evidence, each board member will use his or her
     professional knowledge, best judgment, and common sense. Each finding must be
     supported by a preponderance of evidence. For example, findings that state an aircrew
     member cannot safely perform aircrew duties must include specific information to
     support this conclusion. With evidence of unsafe past performance, continued unsafe
     performance may be reasonably inferred providing rationale for recommending
     disenrollment from training and permanent disqualification.
     4.4.20.3. The findings include comments on each allegation or point in question. Each
     finding is stated separately in brief, clear language to include dates, times, places, and
     events.
     4.4.20.4. An FEB convened to revalidate or requalify for aviation service states in its
     findings whether the respondent was qualified for aviation service when the individual's
     records were invalidated. This includes indicating if the individual:
         4.4.20.4.1. Holds a current aeronautical rating or designation.
AFI11-402_AFSOCSUP 12 JUNE 2012                                                               93


          4.4.20.4.2. Is less than the current maximum age in grade according to AFI 36-2005,
          Appointment in Commissioned Grades and Designation and Assignment in
          Professional Categories—Reserve of the Air Force and United States Air Force.
          4.4.20.4.3. Is medically qualified for aviation service.
          4.4.20.4.4. Was qualified for aviation service when orders were invalidated.
          4.4.20.4.5. Is qualified and available for performance of flying duties appropriate for
          his or her aircrew specialty, grade, and age.
       4.4.20.5. The board may submit an additional finding that the respondent is unsuited for
       duty in a particular type aircraft, role, or mission.
4.5. Board Recommendations. Recommendations must be consistent with the findings. The
FEB's basic charter is to determine whether or not an aircrew member has the potential to
continue in USAF aviation service. Except as noted below, FEBs address only the respondent's
qualification for aviation service, i.e., remain qualified or be disqualified. FEBs do not make
recommendations regarding follow-on assignments. However, the FEB may recommend
placement in a different airframe, e.g. a multi-place, crew-type aircraft. FEBs may make the
following additional recommendations:
   4.5.1. If the FEB was convened as a result of an aircrew member's inability to meet
   standards while enrolled in a formal flying training program, and the board recommends the
   member remain qualified, it may also recommend the member be reinstated in training. Do
   not make any recommendation regarding training unless this is the case.
   4.5.2. If an FEB recommends a dual-rated officer be disqualified in one rated specialty, it
   must address the additional rating. For example, if a former CSO meets an FEB as a pilot and
   the board recommends disqualification, it also makes a recommendation on continued rated
   service as a CSO.
   4.5.3. An FEB, or any subsequent authority in the FEB review process, may recommend the
   respondent be prohibited from wearing the aviation badge. This recommendation is
   appropriate only when: (a) An individual is disqualified for discrediting the badge through
   misconduct or willful violation of flying regulations or procedures, (b) fear of flying, (c)
   cowardice or refusal to fly in combat, or (d) when the aircrew member fails to become a
   productive member of the aircrew force through factors over which he or she has control to
   include attempts to resign from training, attempts to impose limits on rated/CEA service,
   and/or failure within rated/CEA specialty clearly due to lack of effort or motivation. If an
   FEB recommendation is to prohibit wearing the aviation badge, separation action according
   to AFI 36-3206, AFI 36-3208, or AFI 36-2209 as applicable should be considered with
   respect to the needs of the Air Force.
   4.5.4. An FEB convened because of extended suspension or disqualification from aviation
   service limits its recommendation to whether aviation service should be revalidated or the
   individual should be requalified for aviation service.
   4.5.5. A minority report is appropriate if there is disagreement among board members. A
   minority report may address findings, recommendations, or both. In such cases, ensure the
   FEB report shows the scope and content of the minority report, as well as which members
   support the minority opinion.
 94                                                  AFI11-402_AFSOCSUP 12 JUNE 2012


   4.5.6. Recommendations To Disqualify. The best interest of the Air Force is the prime
   criterion when evaluating each case.
      4.5.6.1. Do not base a recommendation to disqualify on a single incident disregarding an
      otherwise sound record. However, if the incident demonstrates unacceptable performance
      or an intentional disregard of regulations or procedures, a recommendation to disqualify
      is appropriate.
      4.5.6.2. If an aircrew member has marginal potential for continued aviation service (e.g.,
      cannot upgrade, has a history of poor checkride performance, or requires continuous
      additional supervision), recommend disqualification.
      4.5.6.3. Disqualification is appropriate for an aircrew member who attempts to DOR
      from formal training, or attempts to place limits on aviation service or future
      assignments.
4.6. The FEB Review Process.
   4.6.1. Review for Legal Sufficiency. The convening authority’s staff judge advocate will
   review the report for legal sufficiency. The staff judge advocate limits comments to
   sufficiency of evidence and compliance with procedural requirements and will not make
   recommendations regarding the respondent's rated qualifications. When an FEB is convened
   below the MAJCOM, the MAJCOM staff judge advocate should conduct an additional legal
   review. When an FEB is convened at MAJCOM level or above, the Air Force staff judge
   advocate should conduct a legal review.
   4.6.2. Action by Convening Authority. After reviewing the report and the review for legal
   sufficiency, the convening authority adds comments and recommendations. If the convening
   authority does not concur with the findings or recommendations, identify the areas of
   contention and explain the reasons for non-concurrence. If lack of supervision or supervisory
   error is a finding, include a statement regarding the corrective action. The convening
   authority may find the aircrew member is unsuited for duty in a particular aircraft, role, or
   mission and make recommendations regarding follow-on assignments. After making
   recommendations, the convening authority forwards the report (with original transmittal
   letter and attachments) directly to the member’s MAJCOM/A3 for review. (When the
   respondent is an ANG resource or mobilization augmentee, forward to ANG/A3, or
   AFRC/A3, as appropriate. Provide the active duty MAJCOM a copy of all documentation.)
   In addition, send one copy of the complete report to each reviewing headquarters.
   4.6.3. Reviewing Authorities and MAJCOM Command Review. Each level in the command
   chain reviews the report. Reviewing authorities may direct an additional review for legal
   sufficiency before making their recommendation. Reviewing authorities may determine the
   aircrew member is unsuited for duty in a particular aircraft, role, or mission, and may make
   recommendations regarding follow-on assignments. To expedite the review process,
   accomplish preliminary staff reviews pending receipt of subordinate commander's
   recommendations. A reviewing commander need forward only his or her comments and
   recommendations.
   4.6.4. Non-concurrence with FEB Recommendation. Reviewing authorities must specify
   reasons for non-concurrence.
AFI11-402_AFSOCSUP 12 JUNE 2012                                                              95


  4.6.5. Reconvening and Rehearing. Any reviewing authority may direct reconvening an FEB
  or a rehearing (new board). (See paragraph 4.8 for special administrative suspense
  instructions.) Reconvening an FEB is appropriate if:
     4.6.5.1. The board did not comply with procedures in this chapter.
     4.6.5.2. New evidence that could affect the findings and recommendations is brought to
     the attention of the convening or reviewing authority.
  4.6.6. Submitting New Evidence (After the Board). If a reviewing authority receives
  additional evidence before forwarding recommendations to the next higher authority, review
  the evidence and have the convening authority reconvene the board if appropriate. Use as
  many of the original board members as possible if reconvening an FEB.
     4.6.6.1. If the convening authority reconvenes the board, give the respondent enough
     time to prepare, but no more than ten working days.
     4.6.6.2. If the convening or reviewing authority does not reconvene the board, forward
     the evidence or a summary with recommendations to the NAF and MAJCOM. Include a
     statement concerning the reasons for not reconvening the board.
     4.6.6.3. If the convening or a subordinate reviewing authority receives additional
     evidence after forwarding recommendations to the next higher reviewing authority, notify
     the higher reviewing authority immediately.
  4.6.7. When to Order a Rehearing. A rehearing is appropriate if any review for legal
  sufficiency determines there was prejudicial error to the substantial rights of the respondent
  that occurred in the proceedings.
  4.6.8. Final Action on the Board. The respondent’s MAJCOM commander is the final
  approval authority for FEBs convened at the MAJCOM level or below. This authority may
  be delegated no lower than MAJCOM/A3. MAJCOMs will notify AF/A3O-AT in writing
  when approval authority is delegated. For FEBs conducted by convening authorities
  designated by the CSAF or CSAF’s delegate, the CSAF or delegate, as applicable, is the final
  authority. Exception: For active duty aircrew members attending a formal flying training
  course in AETC, HQ AETC/CC will be final approval authority for all FEB actions.
     4.6.8.1. The respondent's MAJCOM will review                the   FEB    report   and   all
     recommendations before determining final action.
     4.6.8.2. For FEBs convened for cause involving ARC aircrew members, the NGB/CF or
     AF/RE (as appropriate) ARC commander makes the final FEB decision. This includes
     ARC aircrew members on active duty for flying training.
     4.6.8.3. When a board is convened for failure to meet training standards, the MAJCOM
     commander conducting the training may discontinue processing of the FEB and direct the
     respondent to resume training. If the decision is to disqualify the aircrew member,
     forward the report and all recommendations to AF/A3O-AT for publication of a DAF AO
     assigning ASC 05 (Disqualified--Flying Evaluation Board). AF/A3O-AT will forward a
     copy of the AO to the individual’s HARM office. The HARM office will revoke the
     original suspension and update the ASC in ARMS.
 96                                                   AFI11-402_AFSOCSUP 12 JUNE 2012


4.7. Functions and Duties of Board Members.
   4.7.1. Convening Authority Responsibilities. The convening authority determines if FEB
   action is appropriate. If waiver of an FEB is approved, forward a copy of the approved
   waiver letter to AF/A3O-AT or HQ AFRC/A3TB (ARC members) and the member’s HARM
   office to file permanently in the member’s FRF.
   4.7.1. (AFSOC) If the convening authority is convinced that the reviewing authorities
   would recommend the member remain qualified in the aircraft and/or crew position in which
   previously qualified, the convening authority will utilize an FEB waiver to conserve time and
   resources. When a member chooses to submit a waiver request, ensure the member meets
   with military legal counsel (normally the ADC) prior to submitting a waiver. Approval
   authority is delegated to AFSOC/A3 for AFSOC members. Approval for NGB or AFRC
   members is handled through their respective chain of commands. Contact NGB/A3OS or
   HQ AFRC/A3TB to determine the appropriating approval authority. (T-1)
      4.7.1.1. When an FEB is appropriate, the convening authority:
          4.7.1.1.1. Selects aircrew members to make up the FEB according to paragraph
          4.4.3
          4.7.1.1.1. (AFSOC) Commanders and convening authorities will ensure recorders
          and board members fulfill their FEB duties prior to engaging in any other duties. (T-
          1)
              4.7.1.1.1.1. (Added-AFSOC) AFSOTC units will provide board member

          33-328, Administrative Orders appointing the FEB members (Attachment 12). The
          convening authority will provide board member composition (i.e., names, grade) and
          position (voting and non-voting) information. Refer to paragraph 4.4.3. HARM
          offices will number SOs sequentially beginning each Fiscal Year.
              4.7.1.1.2.1. (Added-AFSOC) The recorder prepares the draft SO identifying
              primary and alternate board members (Attachment 32). The convening
              authority‘s signature block will be used as the approving authority on the letter.
              The recorder will coordinate preparation of the SO with the servicing HARM
              office. The servicing HARM office provides the SO number. Board appointment
              letters and the SBM letter are combined on a single letter (Attachment 32). In
              addition, alternate board members are identified using the same letter. In the
              event that a primary board member must be replaced, the SBM will notify the
              alternate board member of his or her responsibilities. The SBM will also notify
              the convening authority of the change. The recorder will provide a copy of the
              signed SO to the servicing HARM office. (T-1)

        4.7.1.1.4. (AFSOC) Appropriate authorities include the wing commander,
        AFSOC/A3, and HQ AFPC/DPAOT. If the officer is TDY from another MAJCOM,
        ensure the individual‘s MAJCOM is an info addressee. Note: IAW paragraph
        3.7.1.1.4., in the basic instruction, notify Outbound Assignments at the MPS that the
        aircrew members is not to PCS or be reassigned until FEB action is complete
        (includes FEB waiver and VILO action). (T-1)
            4.7.1.1.4.1. (Added-AFSOC) To meet this requirement, HARM offices will
            forward a signed copy of the respondent‘s FEB or FEB waiver notification letter
            to HQ AFSOC/A3TR upon receipt. For overseas SOGs, the group ARM function

  4.7.2. Senior Board Member (SBM) Responsibilities. The SBM is a voting member and the
  final authority regarding the conduct of the board.
     4.7.2.1. Pre-hearing Preparations. Before the board convenes, the SBM will:
         4.7.2.1.1. Inform the recorder of his or her responsibilities, and turn over all
         documents, evidence, and correspondence relative to the case.
         4.7.2.1.2. Specify the time and place for the FEB.
         4.7.2.1.3. Evaluate respondent requests for delays to allow time to secure witnesses
         or evidence. The SBM's decision is final.
         4.7.2.1.3. (AFSOC) If granting a witness request would delay convening the board,
         then, to the extent practicable, consider granting the witness request with the
         stipulation that the witness testify by telephonic or VTC testimony so that the board is
         not delayed. (T-3)
     4.7.2.2. During the hearing the SBM:
         4.7.2.2.1. Convenes the board.
         4.7.2.2.2. Conducts the hearing in an orderly manner.
         4.7.2.2.3. Excuses voting members if a member cannot give a fair and impartial
         hearing or if a challenge is sustained.
         4.7.2.2.4. Defines and explains rights of the respondent.
         4.7.2.2.5. Rules on admissibility of evidence, questions of order, or procedure.

  make sure evidence is fully developed and all facts are identified. In closed session, review
  the facts to arrive at findings and recommendations.
  4.7.4. Advisory Board Members (Non-Voting). Non-voting members give advice in open
  sessions only. If advice becomes necessary during a closed session, open the board and
  obtain it with all parties present. EXCEPTION: If the board needs assistance solely to put

  findings or recommendations into proper form, the legal advisor and reporter may enter the
  closed session. Board members will not engage in discussion with the legal advisor and the
  proceedings will be recorded and added to the FEB transcript.
  4.7.5. Recorder responsibilities. The recorder is responsible for FEB administrative duties.
  Use the Checklist for FEBs (Attachment 21) and ensure all items are accomplished.
  Although the recorder prepares the case and conducts examination of witnesses, the recorder
  is not an adversarial role. To perform recorder duties, relieve the recorder from all other
  duties.
  4.7.5. (AFSOC) The recorder is appointed by and reports directly to the convening
  authority for all matters pertaining to the FEB. Recorder responsibilities and duties take
  precedence over flying, training, TDY, and leave. Since the recorder is relived of all other
  duties, convening authority coordination and approval is required to deviate from this
  requirement. Recorders will ensure convening authorities are briefed periodically on the
  status of FEB reports pending MAJCOM/CC approval. Note: Status updates may be given
  to the wing or group director of staff (DS) (or equivalent) as appropriate. HQ AFSOC/A3TR
  will grant DS access to wing (or group) FEB dashboards maintained on the AFSOC FEB
  SharePoint site. (T-2)
     4.7.5.1. Pre-hearing Preparations. Before the board convenes, the recorder.
         4.7.5.1.1. Uses Attachment 14 to notify the respondent to appear.
         4.7.5.1.1. (AFSOC) Consult with the SBM and base legal office prior to contacting
         the ADC to schedule the board hearing. See also paragraphs 4.7.2.1.2., and
         4.4.3.4.1.1., in this supplement. Note: Since the recorder provides information and
         coordinates scheduling with the respondent’s ADC, it is imperative the recorder
         contact the ADC as EARLY as possible after FEB action is initiated. (T-1)
         4.7.5.1.2. Becomes familiar with the investigation and pertinent directives. Obtains
         and analyzes all records, evidence, and correspondence pertaining to the case.
         4.7.5.1.3. Conducts interviews to identify witnesses and makes notes of expected
         testimony. If a witness cannot appear before the board, the recorder obtains testimony
         by deposition, certification, or affidavits. If the recorder discovers facts that were not
         recognized in the original allegations but bear on the respondent's qualification for
         aviation service, bring these to the convening authority's attention. If the convening
         authority elects to include additional allegations, advise the respondent and allow
         time to prepare.
         4.7.5.1.4. Assures a quorum is always available.
         4.7.5.1.5. Informs the respondent of any changes to time or place for convening the
         board.

         appropriate.
             4.7.5.1.7.1. (Added-AFSOC) Consult with the base legal office for advice on
100                                                  AFI11-402_AFSOCSUP 12 JUNE 2012


             the scheduling of a court reporter. In some cases, the base legal office may be
             able to support a request for court reporter assistance. However, base legal court
             reporters have a primary duty of transcribing for courts-martial. When a base
             legal court reporter is not available, the unit should coordinate for a contracted
             court reporter as soon as possible so not to delay the board hearing or post-hearing
             transcription. Refer to the AFSOC FEB SharePoint site for additional information
             on contracted court reporter alternatives. (T-1)
                 4.7.5.1.7.1.1. (Added-AFSOC) If a contract court reporter is required, to
                 include post-hearing transcription, contact HQ AFSOC/A3TR for funding
                 options. (T-3)
                 4.7.5.1.7.1.2. (Added-AFSOC) Contact the base legal office if the board
                 requires a court reporter with a specific security clearance as early in the
                 process as possible. The base legal office may be able to assist in finding one.
                 However, the court reporter may need to be read into certain programs, so
                 court reporter clearance may need to be coordinated with your security
                 manager. See paragraphs 4.4.1.5.–4.4.1.5.4., in this supplement. (T-2)
         4.7.5.1.8. Notifies the members, witnesses, advisors, and reporter of the time and
         place of the board.
         4.7.5.1.9. Makes sure all evidence is available when the board convenes.
         4.7.5.1.10. Ensures that no privileged safety information is included in the evidence
         to be presented to the board.
         4.7.5.1.11. Gives the respondent and board members an opportunity to review all
         documents submitted as evidence.
         4.7.5.1.12. Assembles pertinent instructions, regulations, directives, and manuals for
         reference during the hearing.

         AFSOC/A3TR by e-mail at afsoc.a3tm@hurlburt.af.mil or through the SharePoint
         site to request read/write access. (T-2)
         4.7.5.1.15. (Added-AFSOC) Contact all of parties scheduled to participate in the
         board hearing process EARLY to ensure they are briefed on when the board will
         convene, determine their availability, and convey information and/or instructions
         necessary for board preparation. Failure to do this may result in board delays and
         missed FEB suspense dates. (T-2)

              dashboard, contact the base CHARM (for overseas AFSOC units, contact the
              group 1C0 FM). (T-2)
   4.7.6. Questioning Witnesses. The transcript of testimony is an essential part of the review
   of the FEB, which leads to the final decision. Facts supporting the findings and
   recommendations must be clearly established. Therefore, make sure all evidence is fully
   developed.
       4.7.6.1. A specific series of questions may not be formulated. Use the following general
       guidance:
          4.7.6.1.1. Review all evidence and prepare questions in advance to ensure all points
          are covered.
          4.7.6.1.2. Establish the identity of the witness (usually done by the recorder) and
          their relationship to the respondent.
          4.7.6.1.3. Restrict questions to one subject at a time and progress logically into the
          next subject.
          4.7.6.1.4. Avoid leading questions.
          4.7.6.1.5. Avoid words that may not be understood by the witness.
          4.7.6.1.6. Do not interrupt one question with another.
          4.7.6.1.7. Avoid questions that require hearsay responses unless such hearsay is the
          only credible information available on a particular issue.
          4.7.6.1.8. Do not ask questions that would require the witness to discuss privileged
          safety information.
          4.7.6.1.9. Apply the cardinal rule of determining what, when, where, why, how, and
          who.
4.8. Administrative Instructions. (See Attachment 22).
   4.8.1. FEB Suspenses. Process the FEB report as soon as possible. Recommendations are
   due at the MAJCOM/A3 staff within 60 workdays after the board adjourns. MAJCOMs may
   authorize additional time for unforeseen circumstances. When extensions are granted, include
   the reason for delay in the transmittal letter to the MAJCOM. MAJCOMs establish
   procedures to expeditiously notify a respondent of the final decision in the FEB process. As a
   guide, inform the respondent within five duty days after making the final decision.
   4.8.1. (AFSOC) The convening authority will ensure the original copy of the FEB, FEB
   waiver, or VILO report/package is submitted to HQ AFSOC/A3TR for further processing
   according to the timelines in Table 4.1.1., in this supplement. Note: Packages will be sent
   via certified mail (i.e., U.S. Postal Service) or via some other service (e.g., FedEx) that
   provides package tracking. (T-2)
AFI11-402_AFSOCSUP 12 JUNE 2012                                                             103


     4.8.1.1. (Added-AFSOC) Convening authorities submit requests for extension to
     AFSOC/A3. Request must cite reasons for delay and the expected date the FEB report
     will be forwarded to HQ AFSOC. (T-2)
  4.8.2. Disposition of Reports. Distribute and forward reports for review. Refer to AFRIMS
  for reports disposition.
     4.8.2.1. (Added-AFSOC) Once the convening authority has reviewed the FEB package
     and signed the FEB transmittal letter, the recorder will scan and upload the entire FEB
     package to the AFSOC FEB SharePoint site and provide written notification of board
     findings and recommendations to the respondent‘s unit and group commander. The
     recorder will notify the respondent‘s group Stan/Evaluation function as required. Note:
     Coordinate with HQ AFSOC/A3TR before uploading documents to the AFSOC FEB
     SharePoint site. (T-2)
  4.8.3. Review of Special Cases. Command review and recommendations concerning FEBs
  vary slightly under certain circumstances. When the respondent is:
     4.8.3.1. Attached to an organization for flying only, is member of a tenant unit or a unit
     without convening authority, the convening authority makes recommendations and
     forwards the report to the respondent's immediate commander. The commander reviews
     the proceedings, makes recommendations, and forwards the report for review within
     command channels.
     4.8.3.2. An active duty member TDY to a non-AETC formal training course, the report
     and recommendations are reviewed and final action is taken within the respondent’s
     command. Ensure the parent/gaining MAJCOM and home unit of the individual are
     provided courtesy copies of all FEB actions.
     4.8.3.3. For mobilization augmentees of the Air Force Reserves, the report and
     recommendations are reviewed within the command channels of the gaining command.
     After the MAJCOM commander concerned makes the final recommendation, forward the
     package to HQ AFRC/A3. HQ AFRC/A3 reviews and makes recommendation to HQ
     AFRC/CC for final approval. HQ AFRC/CC informs the gaining MAJCOM commander.
     4.8.3.4. For Reserve officers on extended active duty (EAD) for flying training and
     projected to return to a non-active duty flying unit on graduation, the convening authority
     makes recommendations and forwards copies of the board report for final decision by
     AFRC (forward to: HQ AFRC/A3, 155 Richard Ray Boulevard, Robins AFB GA 31098-
     1635), or the Director, Air National Guard (forward to: NGB/A3, 1411 Jefferson Davis
     Hwy, Arlington VA 22202-3231).
  4.8.4. Reconvening or Rehearing the Board. When reconvening or rehearing is directed after
  forwarding the proceedings for review, the reviewing authority who directs the action
  notifies each recipient of the report and requests each copy be promptly returned to the
  convening authority.
  4.8.4. (AFSOC) Immediately notify HQ AFSOC/A3TR by message if any reviewing
  authority determines that reconvening/rehearing of the board is appropriate. Include
  reason(s) why the board is reconvening/rehearing. (T-2)

       4.8.4.1. When a board is reconvened, all correspondence and additional transcripts of
       testimony, exhibits, findings, recommendations, and reviews for legal sufficiency are
       added to the initial report for submission to reviewing authorities under a new transmittal
       letter.
       4.8.4.2. In a rehearing, the original report (less prejudicial material) becomes an exhibit
       for the new board.
4.9. Assignment after FEB. If the MAJCOM commander determined the aircrew member
should remain qualified for aviation service, that MAJCOM/A3 will work with the
MAJCOM/A1 and make every reasonable attempt to retain the aircrew member in an aircraft
within that command. Transfer to another MAJCOM will occur only in cases involving an active
duty aircrew member attending a formal flying training course in AETC, an aircrew member
assigned to an overseas command if the aircrew member's DEROS would make retraining not
cost effective, or when the aircraft in which the member was previously qualified is not
supported by the MAJCOM that conducted the FEB. This procedure includes waiver of FEB
cases.
4.9. (AFSOC)AFSOC aircrew members (students) in continuous pipeline training status
(never been mission qualified) attending an AFSOC formal training course who are
retained in aviation service as a result of FEB (including waiver) action may be transferred
to another MAJCOM. However, every effort will be made to retain these members in an
aircraft and/or crew position in AFSOC. (T-1)
   4.9.1. Respondent’s unit commander will consult AFI 36-2110 for removal of assignment
   availability codes.
   4.9.2. Assign FSC "K" to members awaiting reassignment IAW paragraph 4.9 Also
   reference paragraph 3.7.1.1.

                                           Chapter 5

     AVIATION AND PARACHUTIST SERVICE OF NON-RATED OR NON-CEA
    AIRCREW OR PARACHUTIST MEMBERS (AIRCREW OR JUMP PREFIXED
                           SPECIALTIES)

5.1. Purpose of Chapter. This chapter contains aviation/parachutist service policies regarding
non-rated officers and non-CEA enlisted personnel (other than AFSCs 1AXXX or 1UXXX),
performing in full-time positions as aircrew or parachutist members.
5.1. (AFSOC)Purpose of Chapter. In addition to commander‘s briefings, the CHARM,
SARM NCOICs will brief their squadron leadership, to include commanders, operations officers,
chief enlisted managers, and first sergeants, on aviation/parachutist service policies outlined in
Chapter 5 of the basic instruction. Furthermore, commanders will consult with their unit 1C0
personnel and CHARM on matters affecting aircrew members’ continued aviation/parachutist
service. (T-2)
5.2. Applicable to Whom. This chapter applies to all non-rated USAF officers and non-CEA
enlisted personnel authorized use of an aircrew prefix IAW AFI 36-2101, Classifying Military
Personnel (Officer and Enlisted) for performance of full-time non-rated crewmember duties,
assigned aircrew positions for specific MAJCOM MDS identified in AFI 65-503, US Air Force
Cost And Planning Factors, Table A36-1, Authorized Aircrew Composition – Active Forces,
and/or assigned to a parachutist DAFSC or “J” prefix UMD DAFSC IAW AFI 11-410.
Normally, non-rated officer and non-CEA enlisted aircrew members are identified by X, K, or Q
prefix on the DAFSC/CAFSC when assigned against a valid full-time flying position.
Parachutists are identified by a jump inherent DAFSCs IAW AFI 11-410 or “J”-prefix DAFSC.
(For non-rated officers who fly and have a commander AFSC, they may use the commander
AFSC.) NOTE: AFI 65-503, Table A36-1 lists crew complements for each aircraft. This table is
broken out by MAJCOM. An AFSC may be considered an authorized aircrew position in one
command but not in another command. A member assigned an AFSC that is not part of a crew
complement may qualify for operational support flier status IAW Chapter 6 of this instruction.
5.3. Procedures:
   5.3.1. Enter non-rated officers into aviation service when rated officers are not available or
   qualified to accomplish specific in-flight duties. Initiate aviation service when assigning
   these officers to positions where the primary duty requires them to perform full-time in-flight
   duties. A non-rated officer qualified for aviation service according to this instruction and AFI
   11-401 will receive Hazardous Duty Incentive Pay (HDIP) as prescribed in AFI 11-421.
   5.3.2. Enter non-CEA enlisted personnel serving in technical career fields, e.g. 1TXXX,
   1NXXX, 2AXXX, etc. into aviation service when these members are assigned to positions
   where the primary duty requires performance of in-flight duties on a full-time basis. Flying
   positions for staff members outside line flying units will be closely monitored. Non-CEA
   enlisted aircrew members qualified for aviation service according to this instruction and AFI
   11-401 earn HDIP at a variable rate as prescribed in AFI 11-421.
   5.3.3. Enter parachutists into parachutist service IAW this instruction and AFI 11-410.
   HARM offices will not publish AOs for jump incentive pay entitlement before the member is
   medically qualified and assigned to a valid jump inherent DAFSC position or a “J” prefixed
 106                                                    AFI11-402_AFSOCSUP 12 JUNE 2012


   DAFSC position on the UMD. To initiate AOs for a parachutist member “in training”, the
   member must be qualified in a jump inherent AFSC IAW AFI 11-410 or in training leading
   to assignment to a full-time, valid “J” coded UMD authorization.
       5.3.3.1. Do not credit cadet jumps accrued at the USAFA. USAFA cadet jumps are not
       creditable towards AFI 11-410 requirements. Therefore, the jumps are not included in a
       member’s flying/jump history in the member’s FRF and will not be input into an
       operational ARMS database. HARM offices will publish AOs authorizing jump duties
       only for members either assigned to a valid jump position, in training that will lead to
       assignment against a valid jump position, or granted temporary jump status. If not
       currently assigned to a valid jump authorization on the UMD or in temporary jump status,
       the member must be within one year of being assigned to a valid jump position or
       approved to retrain to a jump inherent AFSC IAW AFI 11-410.
   5.3.4. All aircrew/parachutist personnel will be medically qualified according to AFI 44-170
   and AFI 48-123 (prior to publication/effective date of an AO) and complete physiological
   training (if applicable) before performing flying/parachutist duties. Aircrew/parachutist
   members must maintain established professional standards and medical certification, and
   satisfy flight/jump performance standards.
   5.3.5. Do not enter a member with a record of substantiated drug abuse into
   aviation/parachutist service.
5.4. Who Authorizes Aviation Service. Authority to enter or withdraw non-rated officers and
non-CEA enlisted members from aviation/parachutist service is vested in:
   5.4.1. Chief of Staff (CSAF) of the Air Force.
   5.4.2. AF/A3/5, Deputy Chief of Staff, Operations, Plans & Requirements.
   5.4.3. AF/A3O, Director of Current Operations and Training.
   5.4.4. AF/A3O-AT, Chief, Operational Training Division.
   5.4.5. MAJCOM commanders or commanders of field operating agencies of the ARC.
   5.4.6. MAJCOM A3, Director of Operations
   5.4.7. Flying unit commanders, working through the base HARM office responsible for
   flight/jump records.
5.5. Preparing AOs. Commanders submit requests to the HARM office for AOs to enter non-
rated officers and non-CEA enlisted members into official aircrew/parachutist member status via
a letter (refer to Attachment 10). The commander will ensure authorized manning levels are not
exceeded for inherent jump DAFSC positions. Total UMD authorizations are the sum of all jump
inherent DAFSC positions IAW AFI 11-410. The HARM office will monitor authorized aircrew
and parachutist manning positions to determine the need to terminate aviation service and HDIP
for double billeted positions not approved for extended periods. For exceptions, see paragraphs
8.4.2.1 NOTE and 8.4.2.1.3.1 of this instruction.
   5.5.1. Commanders will submit a letter to the HARM office certifying a member’s eligibility
   for aviation/parachutist service. This certification will include verification that the member is
   medically qualified IAW AFI 44-170 and AFI 48-123 and assigned to a valid UMD
   flying/jump position, or enrolled in a formal flying/jump training course enroute to a valid
AFI11-402_AFSOCSUP 12 JUNE 2012                                                                 107


     UMD flying/jump position. The HARM office will not publish an AO to initiate
     aviation/parachutist service for any member unless the individual possesses a valid flight
     physical and is assigned to a valid UMD flying/jump position or formal flying/jump training
     course. The effective date of an AO to initiate aviation/parachutist service will be the formal
     flying/jump training class start date, in unit flying training start date, or effective date of
     flight physical, whichever is latest.
        5.5.1.1. Commanders will verify that the member successfully completed physiological
        training IAW AFI 11-403 (if required). If required for the aircraft/jump mission,
        physiological training must be completed before the member participates in his/her first
        flight/jump (Military Free Fall only). The commander will also verify the member
        possesses the appropriate level of security clearance for the aircraft/mission, review the
        member’s past aviation/parachutist service qualification, and verify that the member’s
        primary, full-time duty requires the performance of in-flight/jump duties. Any
        impediment to the crewmember’s aviation/parachutist service will be brought to the
        commander’s attention. NOTE: Prior non-rated or non-CEA aircrew/parachutist
        members reassigned to aircrew/parachutist duty, to include members returning from a
        period of separation or retirement, will be placed on AOs to initiate aircrew/parachutist
        service IAW paragraph 5.5.1 Non-rated or non-CEA aircrew/parachutist members that
        have been disqualified from aviation service must request requalification IAW
        paragraph 5.10

       Record, and in-process with the unit SARM office and servicing HARM office prior to
       formal flying training start date. (T-1)
   5.5.2. The HARM office publishes AOs to assign ASCs 9D (non-rated or non-CEA aircrew)
   and 9E (non-rated/non-CEA parachutists). If known, the AO should specify a termination
   date. Refer to AFI 11-421 for valid effective dates of AOs that initiate aviation/parachutist
   service. NOTE: The HARM office will assign ASC 9D to non-rated or non-CEA
   crewmembers who are also parachutist qualified and assigned to an authorized parachutist
   DAFSC UMD position that requires performance of aircrew and parachuist duties (e.g.,
   pararescue).
5.6. Termination of Aviation/Parachutist Service. Since termination of aviation service
results in loss of incentive pay, provide as much notice as possible. (See paragraph 5.7 for the
120-day advance notification policy for non-CEA enlisted aircrew members.) The commander,
HARM office, and MPS will work together to notify aircrew members if termination of
aviation/parachutist service is due to an assignment action. The unit commander will also advise
the member and the HARM office if other cause exists to terminate the member’s aviation
service that would preclude 120-day notification. Parachutists are not entitled to a 120-day
notification. NOTE: Aviation/parachutist service ends when a member’s AO is no longer valid
or when a member is suspended, disqualified, separates, or retires.
   5.6.1. Supercede AOs and terminate incentive pay when:
       5.6.1.1. The Air Force reassigns a member to a non-aircrew/parachutist position
       (including Special Duty Identifier (SDI) duty positions) via PCA or PCS action or the
       member is selected to attend training, including OTS, that does not require active
       flying/jumping. If the losing HARM office does not complete the required actions, the
       gaining HARM office will ensure the AO is superseded when the member arrives and
       turns in his or her FRF. Assign ASC 9J (Inactive—Aviation Service Terminated) to non-
       rated or non-CEA aircrew and ASC 06 (Jump Requirement Terminated) to parachutists
       upon change of DAFSC. NOTE: Do not supersede AOs if a member is on Temporary
       Assignment Duty (TAD) or Temporary Duty (TDY) status for less than 180 days and will
       return to aircrew/parachutist duty in the same DAFSC. If attending a course of instruction
       of 180 days or longer that does not require active flying/jumping, assign ASC 9L
       (Inactive—School, Academic) effective the class start date. If the member will retrain
       into another specialty after attending a non-flying/jumping course, the HARM office will
       terminate aviation service effective the class start date or the date of removal from the
       aircrew/parachutist AFSC, whichever is earlier. The HARM office will publish an MPO
       to terminate flight/jump incentive pay effective one calendar day prior to the effective
       date of aviation service termination (ASC 9J or 9L), unless entitlement to incentive pay
       terminated earlier. The HARM office will also print an IDS and file this product, along
       with the MPO and AO, in the member’s FRF.
       5.6.1.2. The member retires or separates (include effective date of retirement or
       separation). NOTE: Publish a new AO to change the termination date for discharged
       enlisted members who immediately reenlist without incurring a break in service. The new
       AO extends the termination date of the previous AO; the effective date remains the same
       as the previous AO. Credit previous flights/jumps to meet incentive pay requirements
       IAW DoD FMR, Volume 7A, Chapter 22 or 24 as applicable.
AFI11-402_AFSOCSUP 12 JUNE 2012                                                                 109


       5.6.1.3. Category E reservists perform duties for points only, not pay. Even when on
       MPA orders, these members remain in Category E status. Since Category E members are
       not entitled to basic pay, they are not entitled to incentive pay per DoD FMR, Volume
       7A, Chapter 22. For enlisted members only, The HARM office will publish an AO to
       assign FSC “J” effective the date of assignment or the 120th calendar day following date
       the member was notified (if he/she did not volunteer for the assignment – reference
       paragraph 5.7), whichever is later.
   5.6.2. When a non-rated or non-CEA member separates from active duty, his or her
   aviation/parachutist status terminates. The losing HARM office will publish an AO to assign
   FSC J—(Inactive-Restricted), effective the DOS or date of retirement. (Exception: Do not
   publish FSC J AOs for members transferring to ARC or active duty who do not incur a break
   in service. The gaining component will publish a new AO with the current ASC so the
   correct component is indicated on the AO.) See AFI 11-421 for AO procedures and remarks.
   5.6.3. Suspension (ASC 04). Commanders suspend non-rated or non-CEA aircrew members
   and parachutists in the same manner as rated officers and CEAs IAW Chapter 3 of this
   instruction.
   5.6.4. Non-rated officers and enlisted members enrolled in basic airborne training are
   trainees in conditional parachutist status. When training for these members is terminated for
   failure to maintain medical fitness, physical fitness, or failure to satisfactorily meet training
   requirements, the servicing HARM office will publish an AO assigning ASC 06 effective the
   date of removal from training (if not previously disqualified by the flight surgeon). If the
   member was entitled to receive parachutist incentive pay on the effective date of removal
   from training, terminate parachutist incentive pay effective one calendar day prior to
   effective date of the AO that assigned ASC 06. The HARM office will specify the reason for
   removal from training in the remarks section of the AO.
       5.6.4.1. If a parachutist qualified non-rated officer or enlisted member assigned to a valid
       parachutist position is removed from Military Free-fall (MFF) training, the servicing
       HARM office will publish a new AO IAW AFI 11-421 with a remark authorizing static
       line jumps only. Do not publish an AO to change the member’s ASC. HALO pay is
       authorized only for the period the member was on MFF status and performed a qualifying
       MFF jump. The HARM office will specify the reason for removal from training in the
       remarks section of the AO.
   5.6.5. Disqualification from Aviation Service. Commanders disqualify nonrated aircrew
   members and parachutists in the same manner as rated officers and CEAs IAW Chapter 3 of
   this instruction, with the exception of specific differences listed in paragraph 5.7 below.
5.7. 120-Day Advance Notification Policy (Non-CEA Enlisted Aircrew Members
Only). Commanders will provide non-CEA enlisted aircrew members at least 120 calendar days
notification (in writing) before involuntarily terminating aviation service. This policy lessens the
impact of financial loss due to short notice PCS, receipt of non-volunteer assignment, base
closure, unit deactivation, and double billeting due to PCS when there are no vacant billets. A
member is not considered to be involuntarily removed from flying duty upon separation,
confinement, relief for cause, reduction in grade, medical unfitness, medical disqualification,
absence without leave, transfer to ground duty at own request, or other reasons determined by the
 110                                                   AFI11-402_AFSOCSUP 12 JUNE 2012


unit commander to be within the member’s control. NOTE: The 120-day advance notification
policy does not apply to entitlement to parachutist HDIP.
   5.7.1. IAW DoD FMR, Volume 7A, Chapter 22 non-CEA enlisted aircrew members
   involuntarily removed from flying duties are entitled to hazardous duty incentive pay until
   the termination date of the current AO or for 120 calendar days from the official notification
   of removal, whichever occurs first. The following dates constitute the start of the 120-day
   period:
       5.7.1.1. The date the commander verbally advises the crewmember that his or her
       aviation service will terminate. The commander will direct the HARM office to publish
       the ARMS 120-day notification report. The commander will document the date and time
       of the notification in writing on the 120-day notification report and obtain the member’s
       signature. The HARM office will provide a copy of this notification to the member and
       file a copy in the FRF.
       5.7.1.2. The date the crewmember acknowledges notification of assignment selection to
       duties that do not require qualification for aviation service (AFI 36-2102, Base-Level
       Relocation Procedures).
   5.7.2. A non-CEA enlisted aircrew member may waive the 120-day notification requirement.
   A voluntary request for assignment to duty or an educational training program not requiring
   aviation service constitutes automatic waiver of the notification requirement.
   5.7.3. The 120-day notification policy requires close management of the non-CEA enlisted
   aircrew member flying force to ensure projected changes are known as far in advance as
   possible. Therefore, include the 120-day notification requirement in all program directives.
5.8. Permanent Disqualification Actions. Except for specific differences noted below,
commanders will permanently disqualify non-rated or non-CEA aircrew members and
parachutists in the same manner as rated officers and CEAs IAW Chapter 3.
   5.8.1. Failure to Satisfactorily Perform Jump Duty. IAW AFI 11-401 a commander will
   recommend permanent disqualification through command channels to the MAJCOM/A3 if a
   member refuses to jump or fails to satisfactorily perform jump duties.
   5.8.2. Voluntary Termination of Parachutist Service. Any parachutist may request
   termination of parachute duty by submitting a voluntary request for disqualification IAW
   Attachment 4. Approval results in permanent disqualification.
   5.8.3. Other Reasons for Permanent Disqualification. Permanent disqualification is
   appropriate when: (a) the member no longer desires to perform required jump duties, (b) the
   member has been selected for assignment to jump duties and requests disqualification or, (c)
   the commander determines the situation warrants permanent disqualification.
5.9. Non-permanent Disqualification Actions. Except for specific differences noted below,
commanders disqualify non-rated or non-CEA aircrew members and parachutists in the same
manner as rated officers and CEAs for: failure to maintain medical certification (paragraph
3.7.2.2), disenrollment from USAF survival school (paragraph 3.8.3), conscientious objector or
noncombatant status, (paragraph 3.8.4), and PRP decertification (paragraph 3.8.5).
   5.9.1. Failure to Maintain Medical Fitness. If a nonrated aircrew member or parachutist is
   medically unfit for flying duty, terminate aviation/parachutist service no sooner than the first
AFI11-402_AFSOCSUP 12 JUNE 2012                                                             111


  day following a 180-day period that commences on the date of incapacitation. When a flight
  surgeon determines an aircrew member or parachutist is unfit to perform flying/jump duty, he
  or she completes an AF Form 1042 and directs the FME to advise the HARM office
  accordingly.
     5.9.1.1. When a member is medically unfit, a flight surgeon completes the AF Form
     1042 and forwards it to the flying/jump unit of assignment and HARM office that
     maintains the member’s FRF/JRF.
     5.9.1.2. If a flight surgeon is unable to determine the period of incapacitation, the HARM
     office will suspense the AF Form 1042 to ensure publication of an AO effective the first
     day following a 180-day period beginning on the date the member was medically
     incapacitated. The HARM office publishes an AO assigning ASC 03 if the medical
     problem is not resolved by the 181st day, and terminates hazardous duty incentive pay
     effective one calendar day before the effective date of the disqualification AO.
     5.9.1.3. If the flight surgeon determines the incapacitation will not be resolved within
     180 days, he or she will indicate this determination on the AF Form 1042 and advise the
     HARM office accordingly. The HARM office will publish an AO to assign ASC 03
     effective the date the MAJCOM/SG indicated on the AF Form 1042 that the medical
     incapacitation is permanent, and terminate hazardous duty incentive pay effective one
     calendar day before the effective date of the disqualification AO. NOTE: Determining
     entitlement to HDIP as a result of a medical action is often a complex task. As a
     technique, determine entitlement to HDIP as a result of medical fitness by considering a
     member in one of two groups. The first group consists of those members who are
     incapacitated regardless of whether or not the incapacitation resulted from the
     performance of hazardous duty. In this situation, use the DoD FMR, Volume 7A, Chapter
     22, paragraphs 220106 and 220107 to determine entitlement. The second group consists
     of those members described in paragraph 5.9.1.2 In this situation, use DoD FMR,
     Volume 7A, paragraph 220107, to determine entitlement. In either case, do not exceed
     180 days total eligibility.
  5.9.2. Humanitarian Disqualification in Lieu of Voluntary Request. When a
  nonrated/non-CEA aircrew member or parachutist with an active ASC encounters personal
  issues that may be resolved if assigned to non-flying/jumping duties for a short time, the
  member may request humanitarian disqualification from aviation or parachutist service. The
  member’s commander will suspend the member’s aviation or parachutist service pending
  final outcome of the request. The HARM office will publish an AO to assign ASC 04
  effective the date of the member’s request and terminate flight pay effective one calendar day
  before the AO effective date. NOTE: The period of non-flying/jumping is usually no longer
  than 12 months.
     5.9.2.1. Base approval on the same guidelines used for processing humanitarian
     reassignment or deferment requests under AFI 36-2110. Grant approval only when it is in
     the best interest of the Air Force. Submit requests according to Attachment 7. The
     MAJCOM/A3T or equivalent will review the request and render the final decision. If
     approved, forward the case file to AF/A3O-AT for publication of a DAF AO to assign
     ASC 00 (Disqualified—Administrative Reasons). The effective date of the DAF AO will
     be the same as the effective date of the original AO that suspended the member.
 112                                                  AFI11-402_AFSOCSUP 12 JUNE 2012


       AF/A3O-AT will forward a copy of the DAF AO to the servicing HARM office. The
       HARM office will update the AO in ARMS, print an ARMS IDS, FHR/JHR, and
       IFR/IJR, publish an MPO to terminate flight/jump incentive pay effective one calendar
       day before the effective date of the AO that assigned ASC 04, and file the AO, MPO, and
       ARMS products in the member’s FRF/JRF.
5.10. Aviation Service Requalification. MAJCOMs may requalify aircrew and parachutists
previously disqualified for non-permanent reasons when the impediment to aviation or
parachutist service no longer exists. There is no obligation to requalify members; approval is
based on needs of the Air Force.
   5.10.1. Medical Disqualification. When a member is medically disqualified and is later
   medically recertified for flying duty, use the following guidelines:
       5.10.1.1. If the duration of medical disqualification was less than one year, the local
       medical authority certifies medical fitness. Requalification is immediate and an
       application is not required. Upon receipt of AF Form 1042, the HARM office publishes
       an AO with the same effective date as the AF Form 1042.
       5.10.1.2. If the duration of medical disqualification was one year, but less than five
       years, the MAJCOM/SGPA must certify medical acceptability. AFMSA/SG3PF is the
       certifying authority for members disqualified for medical reasons (not for failure to
       maintain medical certification).
       5.10.1.3. If the duration of medical disqualification was five years or longer,
       AFMSA/SG3PF must certify medical acceptability. NOTE: A former rated officer
       medically disqualified from rated duties who can medically qualify for non-rated officer
       aircrew member duties may request requalification for non-rated aviation service by
       submitting a letter IAW Attachment 6. The request must specify requalification is to
       perform as a non-rated officer aircrew member.
   5.10.2. Disenrollment from USAF Survival School. Refer to Chapter 3.
   5.10.3. Conscientious Objector Status or Noncombatant Status. Refer to Chapter 3.
   5.10.4. PRP Decertification. Refer to Chapter 3.
   5.10.5. Humanitarian Requalification. When humanitarian provisions are terminated,
   requalify or disqualify the aircrew member under paragraphs 5.8 or 5.9 Do not extend
   humanitarian disqualification beyond 24 months without initiating action to requalify or
   permanently disqualify the member. The MPS will monitor the status of the humanitarian
   deferment and advise the HARM office regarding termination or cancellation. Once notified
   by the commander, the HARM office will publish an AO to requalify the individual IAW
   Chapter 3.
AFI11-402_AFSOCSUP 12 JUNE 2012                                                                 113


                                           Chapter 6

             AVIATION SERVICE OF OPERATIONAL SUPPORT FLIERS

6.1. Purpose of Chapter. This chapter establishes procedures for operational support flying
programs. Each Fiscal Year (FY) AF/A3O-AT reviews and approves all operational support
allocation requirements submitted from MAJCOMs.
6.2. Applicable to Whom. Operational support flying applies to operational flying units tasked
with special missions requiring non-aircrew personnel to perform in-flight duties that cannot be
accomplished by rated, CEA or non-rated/non-CEA aircrew members. Operational Support
Fliers (OSF) are not assigned to the crew complement of the aircraft IAW AFI 65-503, Table
A36-1 and are not normally required for the aircraft to accomplish its assigned primary mission.
Therefore, flying unit commanders should schedule an OSF to fly only when his or her primary
in-flight expertise is required for mission accomplishment.
   6.2.1. Operational support applies to personnel fully qualified in non-aircrew specialties and
   required to temporarily perform duties of the specialty in-flight. OSF are required to
   occasionally fly. Since the member’s primary full-time duties do not require him or her to be
   on board an aircraft, performance of in-flight duties is a special duty for the particular career
   field. The following provisions apply to active duty USAF personnel. The ARC may adopt
   similar procedures to meet the command’s requirements; such procedures however, must not
   be less restrictive than identified in this chapter or DoD FMR, Volume 7A, Chapter 22.
   NOTE: Operational Support personnel are not aircrew members and are not authorized wear
   or award of the non-rated aircrew member badge unless previously awarded an aircrew
   member badge while on AOs and performing duties as an aircrew member. (See paragraph
   7.4.2).
6.3. Qualifications. Operational support fliers must be medically qualified according to AFI
44-170 and AFI 48-123 and complete physiological training (if required) before flying. DNIF
status does not preclude publication of an AO when an OSF has a current physical; however, the
member will not perform in-flight duties until cleared from DNIF status.
6.3. (AFSOC)Qualifications. Operational support fliers (OSF) must be thoroughly familiar
with aircraft emergency procedures. All applicable requirements listed in AFI 11-202V1,
Aircrew Training, and applicable AFI 11-2MDS series will be completed before first flight.
Also, aircrew flight equipment training (including egress) will be accomplished in each MDS
prior to first flight. (T-1)
   6.3.1. Operational support members perform career field duties in which they are already
   qualified (e.g. medical technicians, test analysts). They are not aircrew members, do not have
   a formal flying training school specific to aircraft qualification, are not obtaining or
   maintaining qualification in the aircraft resulting in an aircrew evaluation, and therefore do
   not log time for training purposes.
   6.3.2. Do not enter a member with a record of drug abuse into operational support flying
   duties.
   6.3.3. (Added-AFSOC) OSFs must in-process at the HARM office and turn in AF Forms
   1042, AF Form 702, and commander‘s AO request for creation of ARMS electronic flight
 114                                                    AFI11-402_AFSOCSUP 12 JUNE 2012


   record. They must also receive, review, and sign a flight pay entitlement briefing sheet
   before being placed on active (ASC 9C) OSF status. (T-1)
6.4. Types of Operational Support Duties: Duties include but are not limited to in-flight
diagnostics of aircraft or equipment malfunctions that cannot be duplicated on the ground, in-
flight medical assistance on actual emergency medical evacuation missions, instruction on High
Altitude Airborne Mission Support (HAAMs), security support on air-to-ground surveillance of
missile convoys, or an in-flight test of specific hardware items when such testing cannot be
duplicated on the ground.
   6.4.1. Do not request operational support man-months:
       6.4.1.1. To provide HDIP to personnel who fly as passengers. This restriction also
       pertains to mission essential ground personnel required to accompany aircraft during
       deployments to perform preflight or post-flight duties at the point of destination.
       Example: Combat Controllers do not have in-flight duties.
       6.4.1.2. To provide HDIP as an incentive or reward for performing other than in-flight
       duties.
       6.4.1.3. To allow individuals to fly solely for incentive pay.
       6.4.1.4. To allow individuals to fly solely to log time for credit towards Aerial
       Achievement or Air Medals.
       6.4.1.5. To authorize HDIP to a member who is currently authorized special duty
       assignment pay for performing the same non-aircrew related duties. For example: Flying
       crew chiefs.
       6.4.1.6. To allow members to assist in aircrew duties (anti-hijack procedures, emergency
       egress, in-flight inspection, verification of aircraft equipment, passenger safety, escort
       duty, security of documents, etc.), perform routine administrative duties, conduct
       evaluation of equipment and personnel, perform routine maintenance, perform mission
       essential ground duties, or perform equipment inventories. Refer to AFI 11-401, Chapter
       2 under non-interference flying for other flying status options.
6.5. Submission Procedures.
   6.5.1. Commander’s Responsibilities. Line operational flying unit commanders submit
   OSF fiscal and supplemental man-month requests when primary aircrew members (rated,
   CEA, or non-rated/non-CEA) are not qualified to accomplish specific required in-flight
   duties. Commanders will ensure the operational support flier program is not abused or used
   as an incentive pay program. AF allocates man-months to meet actual operational mission
   needs (for example, a real life medical evacuation mission or to perform temporary in-flight
   test and analysis duties on equipment recently repaired). To minimize costs involved in
   medical qualification, issuing and maintaining personal equipment, and attending
   physiological training, commanders must ensure only the minimum participants needed to be
   part of the program are placed in operational support flying status. Submit requests each
   fiscal year using Attachments 8 and/or 9 of this instruction. If a unit exhausts all available
   man-months before the end of the fiscal year and requires an additional allocation,
   commanders may submit a supplemental request. Each submission will state if the request is
   an annual or supplemental request and for which fiscal year it applies. Commanders should
AFI11-402_AFSOCSUP 12 JUNE 2012                                                            115


  work with the applicable DAFSC Functional Manager (FM) when the mission dictates the
  need for OSFs. Exception: HQ AMC manages the Critical Care Air Transport Team
  (CCATT) and HAAMS programs. HQ AMC/A37TF will coordinate requests and allocations
  with AF/A3O-AT via CCATT and HAAMS program managers, who in-turn coordinate
  requests and allocations with the respective HARM offices. HQ AFSOC manages the
  Casualty Evacuation (CASEVAC)/ Special Operations Casualty Care Evacuation Team
  (SOCCET) programs. HQ AFSOC/A3TM will coordinate requests and allocations with
  AF/A3O-AT and in-turn, AFSOC/A3TM will develop procedures for coordination requests
  and allocations with the respective HARM offices.
  6.5.1. (AFSOC) Casualty Evacuation (CASEVAC)/Special Operations Casualty Care
  Evaluation Team (SOCCET) programs. Non-flying unit commanders will submit OSF
  man-month requests for CASEVAC/SOCCET requirements directly to the servicing AFSOC
  HARM office or overseas group ARM function. AFSOC HARM offices or overseas group
  ARM functions coordinate, validate, and submit initial OSF fiscal year and supplemental
  man-month requests in support of CASEVAC/SOCCET missions directly to HQ
  AFSOC/A3TR. Requests will be submitted using Attachments 8 and/or 9 in the basic
  instruction and include justification IAW paragraph 6.5.1.1., in the basic instruction.
  Submissions to HQ AFSOC may include other man-month requests; however, non-
  CASEVAC/SOCCET requests will be submitted IAW paragraph 6.5.1., in the basic
  instruction before reaching HQ AFSOC. (T-2)
     6.5.1.1. Justification. Requests will include man-month requirements for each DAFSC,
     the aircraft MDS, number of man-months requested for each DAFSC, and number of
     personnel requested in each AFSC. Justification will also include a description of in-
     flight duties to be performed, total number of personnel in the program, estimated
     frequency and duration of flights each month, and reason(s) why duties cannot be
     performed by aircrew members. Commanders will identify in the request the minimum
     operational support members needed per mission. For recurring requests, submit the
     annual man-month tracker showing hours flown and months paid per individual for the
     previous 12 months. If the request is for a new requirement, or there was no activity in
     the previous 12 months, annotate “No Activity in the Past Year” and provide the tasking
     that generated the request. Requests that do not meet the requirements of Attachments 8
     and 9 will be denied for insufficient justification.
  6.5.2. HARM office procedures. Each HARM office will review the request and forward it
  to the MAJCOM/A3T or equivalent to arrive by 15 June. HARM offices will send requests
  for officer and enlisted man-months separately. Geographically separated units submit
  requests through the servicing HARM office.
  6.5.2. (AFSOC) Submit all requests to HQ AFSOC/A3TR for review and further
  coordination. Ensure requests include justification IAW paragraph 6.5.1.1 in the basic
  instruction. Requests submitted after 15 June require OG/CC endorsement and justification
  for the delay. (T-2)
  6.5.3. MAJCOM procedures. MAJCOM/A3T or equivalent designated representatives, in
  conjunction with the AFSC FMs of the affected DAFSC(s), will review and validate each
  man-month request. This review will ensure each request contains sufficient justification and
  the previous year’s operational utilization statistics. For recurring requests, submit man-
 116                                                    AFI11-402_AFSOCSUP 12 JUNE 2012


   month allocation requests only if the utilization statistics warrant. For example, if utilization
   statistics indicate the unit required an OSF to perform primary duties for five hours per
   month for three months the previous year, allocate three months for the upcoming year. A
   request for an allocation that exceeds historical usage figures will include substantiating
   justification for the expected increase.
       6.5.3.1. MAJCOMs consolidate man-month requirements into two categories: an officer
       requirement (Officer Operational Support Man-Year Requirements Report), and an
       enlisted requirement (Airman Operational Support Man-Year Requirements Report), and
       forward a MAJCOM/A3T or equivalent recommendation with previous utilization
       statistics and specific AFSC justifications to AF/A3O-AT to arrive NLT 15 July. This
       will not be delegated lower than MAJCOM/A3T or equivalent. MAJCOMs will justify
       any increase over the previous year’s allocation.
       6.5.3.1. (AFSOC) HQ AFSOC/A3T will submit command OSF man-month requests to
       AF/A3O-AT for review and approval. (T-2)
   6.5.4. AF/A3O-AT Procedures. AF/A3O-AT will allocate new and recurring man-year
   requirements to the MAJCOMs on a FY basis and supplemental allocations as required to
   meet mission requirements (when requested). AF/A3O-AT will evaluate, approve,
   disapprove, or modify the request and allocate man-years as appropriate.
       6.5.4.1. AF/A3O-AT will advise the MAJCOMs of annual man-month allocations not
       later than 15 September. Man-months will be issued in two categories: officer AFSCs and
       enlisted AFSCs. Supplemental requests will be processed when received.
          6.5.4.1.1. Once MAJCOMs receive allocated man-months from AF/A3O-AT, each
          MAJCOM/A3T or equivalent will validate, allocate and distribute new, recurring and
          supplemental requests to HARM offices and command units. MAJCOMs will track
          allocated, used, and remaining man-months for each AFSC and wing/group on a
          spreadsheet.
          6.5.4.1.1. (AFSOC) Once allocations have been received from AF/A3O-AT, HQ
          AFSOC/A3TR will validate, allocate, and distribute new, recurring, and supplemental
          requests to command HARM offices (or overseas group ARM functions). (T-2)
          6.5.4.1.2. The HARM office will load man-month allocations per approved AFSC in
          the ARMS database. The HARM office and the unit(s) that requested the man-months
          will track and monitor man-month utilization on a spreadsheet. The spreadsheet will
          track each AFSC, allocated man-months, each member’s name with a 12-month
          breakout to track hours flown and paid months, and overall totals for each AFSC
          listing man-months allocated, used, and remaining. The HARM office will update the
          spreadsheet monthly to keep a current status of man-months used. The HARM office
          will maintain spreadsheet on file for two years IAW AFRIMS Table 13-10 R 07.00.
          Submit utilization data with the next FY operational support request.
6.6. Supplemental Requests.
   6.6.1. If a unit requires additional man-months or a new operational requirement arises
   during the FY, submit supplemental requests through the HARM office to the
   MAJCOM/A3T or equivalent. Prepare the supplemental request according to Attachment 8
AFI11-402_AFSOCSUP 12 JUNE 2012                                                                 117


   and 9. Supplemental requests will include justification for the increased man-year
   requirements and the MAJCOM’s current (as of the date of request) FY man-month
   utilization, by AFSC.
   6.6.1. (AFSOC) Unit commanders will submit supplemental requests through the servicing
   HARM office to HQ AFSOC/A3TR.           Exception:      For overseas units, submit
   CASEVAC/SOCCET requests through the SOG ARM function to HQ AFSOC/A3TR. (T-2)
   6.6.2. Operational support flier program managers will work with commanders to ensure
   man-months are exhausted prior to submitting a supplemental request to the MAJCOM.
   Groups are authorized to transfer man-months within the same category of operational
   support fliers (i.e., enlisted to enlisted, or officer to officer) on previously approved DAFSCs
   within that year’s allocation. For example: 1CXXX and 4NXXX were approved man-months
   for FY04. DAFSC 1CXXX supported numerous emergency evacuations during a
   contingency and exhausted all man-month authorizations. DAFSC 4NXXX had eight man-
   months remaining, with only two qualified specialists and two months remaining in the FY
   (possibility of using four). This group may transfer switch four excess man-months to
   1CXXX without MAJCOM approval.
      6.6.2.1. If man-months are available, HARM offices will coordinate with respective
      AFSC FMs to transfer man-months from approved AFSCs before submitting
      supplemental requests. HARM offices may transfer man-months only from officer to
      officer AFSCs and enlisted to enlisted AFSCs. HARM offices will track the transfer of
      man-months across AFSCs on spreadsheets.
      6.6.2.2. If the MAJCOM needs additional man-months for an already approved AFSC,
      forward the request to AF/A3O-AT. New AFSC requests (not already approved for that
      FY) must be sent to AF/A3O-AT. NOTE: All levels will review requests based on
      previous year’s utilization and the requirements of this chapter. Any level may reduce or
      deny a request based on insufficient justification, utilization statistics, or failure to meet
      submission requirements. Example: HARM office may deny a request because request
      letter was submitted without justification. HARM office may reduce number of man-
      months required based on the number of hours and paid months from the previous FY.
6.7. Monthly AO Requests.
   6.7.1. Flying Unit Commanders. Flying unit commanders submit requests to the HARM
   office responsible for maintaining local flight records to enter and terminate operational
   support flying status for a member based on approved man-month allocations. Commanders
   will review the member’s past aviation service and certify the member’s medical
   qualification, completion of physiological training (if required), and security clearance (if
   required). After evaluation of mission requirements and each member’s qualifications,
   commanders will submit a request to the HARM office identifying the member(s) required to
   support mission requirements each month. Ensure only the minimum required number of
   OSF personnel are placed on AOs. Since AF and MAJCOMs review and allocate operational
   support requirements on a FY basis, commanders will ensure the unit does not exceed its
   annual man-month allocation. Submit monthly AO requests only if man-months have been
   verified as available. NOTE: Requests for AFOTEC, CCATT, CASEVAC/SOCCET and
   HAAMS submitted by a non-flying unit commander will be routed through the servicing
   HARM office for validation.
118                                                  AFI11-402_AFSOCSUP 12 JUNE 2012


  6.7.1. (AFSOC) Non-flying commanders may submit requests to the servicing HARM
  office to place CASEVAC and SOCCET members on OSF status. All other requests must be
  submitted by a flying unit commander IAW the basis instruction. In all cases, as a minimum,
  AO request letters will include member‘s name, rank, DAFSC, and date(s) requested on
  flying status. Request letters must be submitted to the HARM office on or before the
  requested effective date to allow for AO processing time. Note: For overseas SOG units,
  submit requests through the SOG ARM function before submitting to the servicing HARM
  office. (T-2)
      6.7.1.1. When an operational support requirement is terminated, commanders will direct
      the HARM office to terminate AOs (even if prior to end of the man-month).
      6.7.1.1. (AFSOC) Commanders will not place CASEVAC/SOCCET members on OSF
      status for the sole purpose of performing in-flight duties on training missions. In these
      cases, members will be placed on non-interference AOs IAW AFI 11-401. Neither flight
      time or flight pay is authorized. When CASEVAC/SOCCET members on OSF (ASC
      9C) AOs are required to perform in-flight duties on training missions, they will log
      “other” time on the AFTO Form 781. Place a remark on back of the AFTO Form 781 to
      denote member(s) did not perform “real-world” CASEVAC/SOCCET duties. (T-1)
      6.7.1.2. Commanders will terminate operational support aviation service when:
         6.7.1.2.1. The project or mission that justified operational support status is
         completed, canceled, or delayed excessively.
         6.7.1.2.2. The member is no longer available or qualified to fly.
         6.7.1.2.3. Required by the unit to remain within its allocated man-months.
         6.7.1.2.4. OSF personnel are in extended TDY status that does not involve flying.
         NOTE: Due to the limited aviation involvement of an operational support flier,
         disqualification is usually not appropriate. When reason exists to preclude a member
         from future aviation service, disqualification action may be initiated according to
         Chapter 3.
  6.7.2. HARM office. Prior to publishing AOs, the HARM office will review the DAFSC
  spreadsheet to validate how many months are available for each AFSC. After confirmation of
  available man-months, the HARM office will review the commander’s request and publish
  AOs accordingly. The HARM office will coordinate with the SARM office to ensure input
  and review of all AFTO Forms 781. The HARM office will publish AOs to assign ASC 9C
  (operational support).
      6.7.2.1. AOs that place a member in operational support status are effective on a monthly
      basis. Orders are effective when certification and validation are complete. Unless an
      earlier termination date is known, these AOs terminate on the last day of each month.
      Unit commanders may request members be placed on an AO for a minimum of one day
      or longer, not to exceed the end of the calendar month.
      6.7.2.1. (AFSOC) The AO effective date cannot be before commander‘s request letter is
      received, member is physically qualified (current periodic) and has physiological
      training, and man-months are approved and available for the member‘s AFSC. Flying
      unit commanders will ensure OSFs are not placed on the flight authorization unless they
AFI11-402_AFSOCSUP 12 JUNE 2012                                                              119


       are required for that specific mission and are on active (ASC 9C) AOs IAW AFI 11-401.
       On a case-by-case basis, the HARM office may publish AOs in advance for one month at
       a time (e.g., 1–31 January 2011, 1–28 February 2011), providing physical requirements
       are met and man-months are available for the entire period. (T-1)
           6.7.2.1.1. If a member will perform OSF duties for multiple months, unit
           commanders may request that the HARM office publish multiple AOs in advance.
           The HARM office will publish a separate AO for each calendar month that a member
           is required to perform operational support duties.
       6.7.2.2. Normally, when the AO expires, the HARM office will remove the member
       from aviation service and assign ASC 06 in ARMS. If the AO expires at the end of a
       month, and the commander directs the HARM office to publish an AO to continue
       operational support status, and man-months are available in the member’s AFSC, the
       HARM office will publish a subsequent AO effective the first day of the following
       month. In these cases, the HARM office will not assign ASC 06 in ARMS.
       6.7.2.3. Although a member will be placed on AOs when man-months have been
       allocated, the man-month is not used until the member meets minimum monthly flying
       hour requirements for entitlement to HDIP for the entire month. If the member was
       placed on AOs and paid for a fraction of the month, then the unused portion of the month
       remains available for allocation. Prorate flying hours required IAW the Fractions of a
       Calendar Month table in DoD FMR, Volume 7A, Chapter 22.
6.8. Monthly Verification of Entitlements. Officers and enlisted members on operational
support flier AOs who perform operational support flying duties according to this instruction and
AFI 11-401 are entitled to HDIP as prescribed in the DoD FMR, Volume 7A, Chapter 22. An
operational support flier receives HDIP only for those months or portions of months in which he
or she met the minimum flying hour requirements. Operational support fliers will not bank flight
time.
   6.8.1. Flying Unit Commander Responsibilities. Except as noted above (CCATT or
   HAAMS), flying unit commanders will ensure use of OSF to meet actual mission needs only.
   OSF authorized to fly when no in-flight duties are performed will log other time (this
   includes specialty training). An OSF will receive flight credit and qualify for HDIP only
   when: (a) member is on operational support AOs, (b) man-months are available, and (c)
   member satisfies flight requirements for receipt of HDIP IAW DoD FMR, Volume 7A,
   Chapter 22.
   6.8.2. Operational Support Member Responsibilities. Operational support members fly on
   missions that require them to perform temporary primary in-flight duties. Because OSF do
   not obtain/maintain aircraft qualification, these members will log primary time only when
   actually performing primary in-flight duties related to the specialty. OSF will log “Other”
   time when not performing in-flight duties directly related to the specialty. For example: An
   operational support member is scheduled to fly to perform tests on a piece of equipment that
   was just put back in the aircraft. This member performed tests on the equipment for one hour
   of a four-hour mission. The OSF will ensure only one hour of primary time and three hours
   of other time are logged IAW AFI 11-401.
 120                                                   AFI11-402_AFSOCSUP 12 JUNE 2012


   6.8.3. Aircraft Commander, Senior OSF, and Medical Crew Director (MCD)
   Responsibilities. Aircraft commanders, senior OSF, and MCD will ensure OSF fly only on
   missions that require performance of valid in-flight duties and will ensure primary flying
   time is logged only during portions of the mission when valid in-flight duties are performed.
   Aircraft commanders or senior OSF will ensure actual duties performed are documented in
   the remarks section of the AFTO Form 781, ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document
   and certify by signing under the remark.
   6.8.3. (AFSOC) When the statement is missing from the AFTO Form 781, the SARM
   office will coordinate with the aircraft commander to determine if duties were performed.
   The senior OSF for that mission will document in the remarks section of the AFTO Form
   781, ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document, even if duties were not performed. (T-
   2)
   6.8.4. SARM Responsibilities. Ensure OSF are on valid operational support AOs, complete
   go-no-go requirements, and flight time is logged properly before update to ARMS. Contact
   the aircraft commander for corrections to the AFTO Form 781 when needed. SARM offices
   will ensure proper remarks are documented and certified before update in ARMS.
       6.8.4.1. SARM offices will work with the HARM office during the monthly validation of
       flying time and before the HARM office publishes MPOs. SARM offices will ensure the
       HARM office receives AFTO Forms 781 with OSF listed prior to the 5th day following
       the month sorties were flown to allow proper validation of flying time, remarks, and
       publication of MPOs. NOTE: AOs alone do not authorize a member to fly and log time
       for entitlement to incentive pay. The member must be required for the mission and
       actually perform in-flight duties. Do not log on the AFTO FORM 781 time spent in
       observation, familiarization, or point-to-point travel. Exception: For medical personnel,
       enroute missions to pick up patients requiring medical care may be logged as other time
       when patients are not on board the aircraft. For example: A medic is tasked to fly with the
       44 SOS to pick up a patient downrange. On the enroute mission to pick up the patient, the
       medic logs other time. Primary time will be logged when the patient is on board the
       aircraft and the medic provides medical assistance in-flight.
   6.8.5. HARM Office Responsibilities. HARM office personnel will review individual
   flying hours and required AFTO Form 781 remarks before submitting the military pay order
   to the finance office authorizing flight pay. This review will ensure minimum primary flying
   hour requirements were satisfied for the month or period the member was on OSF AOs.
6.9. Mid-Year/End-of-Year Turn-in. The HARM office will ensure all hours flown by
operational support members are recorded prior to the closeout of the fiscal year. Each HARM
office will consolidate excess man-months from the previous FY and forward to the MAJCOMs
with a copy of base utilization (by AFSC) to arrive NLT 15 October. Geographically separated
units submit excess man-months through the servicing HARM office. Each MAJCOM will
submit the command’s excess man-months with a copy of MAJCOM’s utilization (by AFSC) to
arrive at AF/A3O-AT NLT 1 November.

  6.9.1. (Added-AFSOC) The HARM office is authorized to publish noninterference AOs for
  operational support medical personnel to perform simulated medical duties IAW AFI 11-401.
  Members who fly in this status are not authorized to log flight time and are not entitled to
  Hazardous Duty Incentive Pay (HDIP). Medical personnel may also coordinate with units to
  perform simulated duties on static aircraft. (T-2)

                                            Chapter 7

                        AVIATION AND PARACHUTIST BADGES

7.1. Basic Policy. The USAF authorizes the award and wear of basic aviation badges to USAF
members and members of other military services who complete applicable USAF flying training
requirements. The USAF authorizes the award and wear of basic parachutist badges to USAF
members and members of other military services who complete applicable USAF parachutist
training requirements IAW AFI 11-410. The Air Force also awards badges to members who
complete flying training conducted by other US Military services leading to aviation service in
the USAF. Former members of other US military services are eligible for the basic USAF pilot,
RPA, piot, CSO, ABM, and observer aviation badges if qualified for USAF aviation service by
an ARB. Aviation badges are not awarded to civilian government employees.
   7.1.1. The HARM office that manages an aircrew or parachutist member’s record publishes
   AOs to award aviation and parachutist badges. Although published on an AO, parachutist
   badges are not considered aviation badges. Aircrew members and parachutists awarded
   aviation and parachutist badges wear them IAW AFI 36-2903, Dress and Personal
   Appearance of Air Force Personnel.
7.2. Specific Guidelines. USAF aviation badges symbolize attainment of a high degree of
professionalism in a flying specialty and are permanently awarded only to those aircrew
members who, by virtue of extensive training, experience, and assignment to primary aircrew
duty are considered part of the career flying force. Over the years the prestige of aviation badges
has been carefully and closely guarded through consistent and strict adherence to the award
criteria. Proposals for waivers of award criteria are not appropriate.
   7.2.1. Commanders will make every effort to maintain the prestige and tradition of award
   and wear of the USAF aviation and parachutist badges.
   7.2.1. (AFSOC) Commanders will ensure aircrew and parachutist members do not wear
   advanced aviation or parachutist badges until all requirements of Table 7.1., in the basic
   instruction are met, the member has submitted application through the HARM office (if
   required), and the advanced badge has been updated in the members‘ ARMS record. (T-2)
   7.2.2. Presenting badges is not an appropriate method for recognizing meritorious service,
   achievement, or international friendship.
   7.2.3. Rated officers are not eligible for non-rated or non-CEA aviation badges. A rated
   officer previously awarded a non-rated officer or aircrew member badge (for previous non-
   rated officer or non-CEA aircrew duty) may wear the previously awarded badge, providing
   he or she wears the most current aviation badge.
   7.2.4. Wear of Badges.
       7.2.4.1. 1AXXX CEAs may wear the airman aircrew member basic badge upon award of
       the 1AX3X AFSC, prior to meeting the requirements for permanent award (paragraph
       7.4). When the member satisfies requirements for permanent award, publication of the
       AO is authority to continue the wear of the specified badge.
AFI11-402_AFSOCSUP 12 JUNE 2012                                                              123


           7.2.4.1.1. RPA Sensor Operators may wear the RPA Sensor Operator basic badge
           upon award of the 1UXXX DAFSC, prior to meeting the requirements for permanent
           award (Table 7.1). When the member satisfies requirements for permanent award,
           publication of the AO is authority to continue the wear of the RPA Sensor Operator
           badge.
       7.2.4.2. Non-rated officer and non-CEA aircrew members may wear the officer or
       airman aircrew member basic badge upon completion of aircrew qualification (AF Form
       8) prior to satisfying the requirements for permanent award (paragraph 7.4). When the
       member satisfies requirements for permanent award, publication of the AO is authority to
       continue the wear of the specified badge. Note: Members terminated or disqualified
       prior to 36 months of aviation service are not authorized the wear of the airman/officer
       aircrew member and the RPA sensor operator badge. Publication of the “06” AO or
       disqualification AO is the authority to restrict the wear of the badge.
   7.2.5. A USAF member placed on AOs authorizing permanent (“J” prefixed DAFSC, or
   jump inherent DAFSC UMD positions IAW AFI 11-421), or temporary jump status who
   satisfies the requirements of Table 7.2 may be awarded the parachutist badge. Publication of
   the AO is the authority to wear the specified badge.
7.3. Award of Rated Aviation Badges to US Air Force Officers. The USAF rated aviation
badges correspond to USAF aeronautical ratings. Rated officers must satisfy all applicable
eligibility criteria listed in Table 2.1 before the HARM office or AF/A3O-AT will publish the
AO to authorize the rating. The AO awarding the aeronautical rating constitutes authority to
wear the badge. Dual-rated officers may wear a previously awarded badge with the most current
rating (badge) placed above the previously awarded badge.
   7.3.1. HARM offices will not use current eligibility requirements to retroactively award a
   badge for past aviation service (previous to the date of this AFI). Compare accomplishments
   against AFI criteria for the year that the member may have been eligible for the award to
   ensure correct effective date (if applicable). Go through command Aviation Resource
   Management channels to retrieve past criteria. AF/A3O-AT maintains historical AFIs.
7.4. Permanent Award of Aircrew Member Badges to US Air Force Members. A USAF
CEA, non-rated officer aircrew member, or non-CEA enlisted aircrew member may qualify for
an aircrew member badge if he or she is: (a) qualified for USAF aviation service, (b) assigned an
active or inactive FSC (not separated, suspended, or disqualified from aviation service) and (c)
not considered a rated asset in the ARC. See also paragraph 7.2.
   7.4.1. Permanently award the basic aircrew member badge to a CEA or other nonrated
   aircrew member effective the date he or she satisfies the requirement listed in Table 7.1 or
   meets one of the requirements in paragraphs 7.4.1.1 – 7.4.1.4 below: Note: Not applicable
   for the permenant award of the RPA Sensor Operator Badge. These individuals must meet
   the requirements listed in Table 7.1
       7.4.1.1. Member was medically disqualified for further performance of aircrew member
       duty as a result of wounds received in action while in a designated combat zone and
       performing primary duty as an aircrew member. The effective date for award of the
       badge is the same as the effective date of the AO that assigned ASC 03.
124                                                  AFI11-402_AFSOCSUP 12 JUNE 2012


      7.4.1.2. Member was medically disqualified for further performance of aircrew member
      duty as a result of injuries received in an aircraft mishap while performing primary duty
      as an aircrew member. The effective date for award of the badge is the same as the
      effective date of the AO that assigned ASC 03.
      7.4.1.3. Member participated in at least 10 combat missions as a primary aircrew
      member in a designated combat zone (Combat support missions do not qualify for
      purposes of this computation. See AFI 11-401 for explanation of missions), or…
      7.4.1.4. Member was assigned to perform aircrew member duties and completed a
      minimum of one operational mission in space (50 miles above the earth). In addition to
      eligibility for permanent award of the aircrew member badge, the individual is eligible
      for the astronaut qualifier. Submit application for award of the astronaut qualifier
      (Attachment 2).
  7.4.2. Effective Dates for Award of Aviation Badges.
      7.4.2.1. The servicing HARM office will publish an AO to permanently award the basic
      aircrew member badge to a CEA effective the date the member satisfies requirements
      IAW paragraph 7.4.1
         7.4.2.1.1. For nonrated aircrew members not previously awarded the basic badge
         who were classified as a CEA after 1 Oct 99, use the date the member was classified
         as a CEA providing the member also satisfied the requirements of paragraph 7.4.1
         on that date. Otherwise, the effective date is the date member satisfied requirements.
      7.4.2.2. The servicing HARM office will publish an AO to permanently award the basic
      aircrew member badge to a non-rated officer or enlisted aircrew member (non-CEA)
      effective the date the member satisfies requirements IAW paragraph 7.4.1
  7.4.3. Non-rated officers who previously earned the airman aircrew member badge may
  continue to wear it. Credit aviation service as an enlisted aircrew member towards award of
  the non-rated officer aircrew member badge if the officer is assigned to a valid officer
  aircrew member position and performing associated duties.
  7.4.4. For award of advanced badges, the aircrew member must first meet the requirements
  listed in Table 7.1 and be awarded the previous badge(s).
  7.4.5. See paragraph 7.8 for guidance on prohibiting the wear of aviation badges.
  7.4.6. Operational support fliers will not wear an aviation badge unless permanently awarded
  the badge as a result of previous aircrew member duty. Do not count any time accrued as an
  operational support flier (FZ aircrew certification code) toward requirements for permanent
  award of an aviation badge. If an individual occupies a specific UMD position that requires
  operational support flying, and the position is approved for aircrew member status while the
  member is still assigned to the position, the individual may use the prior operational support
  flier time accumulated while assigned to that position toward requirements for permanent
  award of the badge.
  7.4.7. Award of Parachutist Badges/Devices. The USAF awards basic parachutist
  badges/devices to USAF members and members of other military services on AOs
  authorizing jump status who complete AF recognized parachutist training IAW AFI 11-410
  and satisfy the requirements listed in Table 7.2. USAF members awarded parachutist badges
AFI11-402_AFSOCSUP 12 JUNE 2012                                                              125


  by a sister service are authorized to wear the USAF parachutist badge. Commanders will
  make every effort to maintain the prestige and tradition of USAF parachutist badges/devices.
  NOTE: A parachutist badge is not considered an aviation badge.
     7.4.7.1. Wear of other US or foreign military service badges, if authorized, will be IAW
     AFI 36-2903.
     7.4.7.2. If worn, the static-line parachutist badge will be worn above all other parachutist
     and occupational badges IAW AFI 36-2903.
     7.4.7.3. Presenting badges/devices is not an appropriate method of recognizing
     meritorious service, achievement, or international friendship.
     7.4.7.4. See paragraph 7.8 for guidance on prohibiting the wear of parachutist badges.
     7.4.7.5. Combat Jump and Bronze Star. Members may wear a Bronze Star for each
     combat jump accomplished.
         7.4.7.5.1. The commander or designated representative will certify qualification for
         the combat jump award via letter to the servicing HARM office. The letter will
         specify the date and location of the combat jump. A USAF member who earned a
         bronze star device(s) while serving in a sister service will maintain appropriate
         service documentation of the combat jump in the JRF (if applicable) and/or USAF
         personnel records.
         7.4.7.5.2. The servicing HARM office will publish an AO to award the Bronze Star
         for a combat jump. The remarks section of the AO will specify the date and location
         of the combat jump. For example: A member performed a combat jump at Drop Zone
         Simba on 26 Jan 1991, in support of Operation Desert Storm and is awarded a bronze
         star per commander’s letter dated 15 Apr 1991. The HARM office will post
         member’s AF Form 922, Individual Jump Record, accordingly, after the jump is
         certified for a parachutist not assigned to an airborne jump unit. Squadron Aviation
         Resource Management (SARM) personnel will document the AF Form 922 prior to
         submission to the HARM office for a unit parachutist member once the form is
         certified.
     7.4.7.6. International Parachutist Badges. Training provided by a foreign country will
     lead to award of that country’s badge only. Such award does not constitute authority to
     award a USAF parachutist badge. The MAJCOM Director of Personnel is the approval
     authority for acceptance of foreign decorations (e.g., Canadian Parachutist Badge).
     7.4.7.7. Qualification for Basic/Advanced Parachutist Badges.
         7.4.7.7.1. Qualification for Basic Parachutist Badges. The Host Aviation Resource
         Management (HARM) office will use the course completion certificate and Army
         order for award of the basic parachutist and basic military free-fall badge. Personnel
         who meet the requirements for award of the basic USAF parachutist badge are not
         required to apply or complete an AF Form 196, Data for Parachutist Badge. The
         HARM office will file a copy of the course completion certificate and Army order in
         the member’s JRF. The HARM office that maintains the member’s JRF will publish
         the AO to award the appropriate badge. The AO will specify the specific Table 7.2
 126                                                  AFI11-402_AFSOCSUP 12 JUNE 2012


          criteria that established eligibility. The effective date of the AO will be the date the
          individual completed training and listed on the Army order.
          7.4.7.7.2. Qualification for Advanced Parachutist Badges. Personnel who meet the
          requirements for award of an advance USAF parachutist badge must apply for the
          badge by completing AF Form 196, Data for Parachutist Badge. The HARM office
          will file a copy of the AF Form 196 in the member‘s JRF. The HARM office that
          maintains the member‘s JRF will publish the AO to award the appropriate advance
          badge. The AO will specify the specific Table 7.2 criteria that established eligibility.
          The effective date of the AO and the AF Form 196 will be the date the individual
          satisfied all applicable criteria in Table 7.2
          7.4.7.7.3. JM Qualification. A parachutist becomes a qualified jumpmaster via
          completion of a recognized JM training program IAW AFI 11-410. Commanders will
          submit to the HARM office a letter and additional documentation that certifies the
          member is JM qualified (e.g., MAJCOM approved plan of instruction signed by the
          training certifier, formal class certificate of completion, etc.). The servicing HARM
          office will publish an AO on AF Form 1887 indicating the specific JM qualification
          in the remarks section of the AO IAW AFI 11-401. HARM offices will publish the
          AO before updating JM accomplishments in ARMS. The HARM office will file a
          copy of the additional documentation (e.g., MAJCOM approved plan of instruction
          signed by the training certifier, formal class certificate of completion, etc.) in the
          member’s JRF. AFI 11-401, Chapter 2 establishes the effective period of an AO
          authorizing jump status. JM orders will include the following applicable categories
          for JM qualifications (see also AFI 11-410):
              7.4.7.7.3.1. Joint Operations Static Line Jumpmaster.
              7.4.7.7.3.2. Joint Operations Military Free Fall Jumpmaster.
              7.4.7.7.3.3. USAFA Free Fall Jumpmaster (Note: Only applicable for USAFA
              jump activities.).
              7.4.7.7.3.4. Experimental/Test Jumpmaster.
              7.4.7.7.3.5. Rescue Jumpmaster.
              7.4.7.7.3.6. SERE Jumpmaster.
7.5. Publishing Aeronautical Orders for nonrated or CEA aircrew members. The HARM
office that maintains the member’s FRF publishes AOs to award basic badges and updates
advanced aircrew member badges in ARMS. Exception: HARM office will publish AOs for
award of advance parachutist badges. Preceding badges must have been awarded before award
of advanced badges. For example, a member must be awarded the basic aircrew member badge
before the senior aircrew member badge. Do not publish more than one badge effective on the
same date. For previous military service members who satisfy requirements for basic and
advanced badges at the same time, award advanced badge(s) effective the following day (if
applicable). The remarks section of each published AO will contain the specific applicable
criteria listed in paragraphs 7.4.1.1 through 7.4.1.4 and/or Table 7.1. For example: “Master
Sergeant Muszynski completed 15 years of aviation service, accumulated a minimum of 144 paid
months of operational flying duty, and has a 7 skill level”.
AFI11-402_AFSOCSUP 12 JUNE 2012                                                              127


   7.5.1. Aviation service begins on the ASD for CEAs and the effective date of the AO that
   assigned ASC 9D for non-rated officers and non-CEA enlisted personnel. Do not count
   periods of breaks in military service, disqualification, or suspension (except ASC 07). The
   effective date for the basic badge is the date requirements are met IAW paragraphs 7.4.2.1
   or 7.4.2.2, as applicable.
   7.5.2. As of 29 Jul 03, the effective dates for advanced badges are the 7- and 15-year
   anniversary dates respectively, if all other requirements are satisfied. If a member does not
   satisfy requirements by the 7- or 15-year anniversary, the effective date will be the date the
   member satisfied all requirements. For award of advanced badges, non-rated or non-CEA
   members must satisfy a prorated share of flying hours to credit a month of operational flying
   IAW DoD FMR, Volume 7A, Chapter 22 when initiating or terminating aviation service.
   CEA and rated officer advanced badges are based on flying hours or OFDA credit.
   7.5.3. Effective Dates of AOs prior to 29 July 2003. To determine correct effective dates
   for award of badges prior to 29 Jul 03, HARM office personnel must consult the AF
   instruction or regulation in effect at that time.
       7.5.3.1. Prior to 1 Sep 97, providing all requirements for award of the badge were
       satisfied and the badge was not awarded prior to meeting the requirements for award,
       there was no established standard “effective” date to publish the AO awarding the badge.
       Badge effective dates cannot be prior to satisfying all eligibility requirements.
       7.5.3.2. From 1 Sep 97 to 28 Jul 03 inclusive HARM offices reviewed eligibility
       requirements, and once the member satisfied criteria for award of the badge, the effective
       date of the AO was the end of the month in which all requirements were met.
7.6. Award of the Flight Nurse Badge to US Air Force Officers. Award the basic badge to
flight nurses upon completion of the requirements listed in Table 7.1 or paragraph 7.4.1.1.
through 7.4.1.4.
7.7. Publishing Aeronautical Orders for Parachutists. Award parachutist badges when the
member completes training at an AF recognized operational parachutist course authorized by
AFI 11-410 and satisfies badge requirements IAW Table 7.2
   7.7.1. HARM offices will award parachutist badges only to individuals who have completed
   an AF recognized operational parachutist course IAW AFI 11-410 and are on AOs that
   authorize jump status. To request award of the basic parachutist badge, Air Force members
   will submit a copy of the AF recognized operational parachutist course graduation certificate
   to the local HARM office that maintains the JRF. The servicing HARM office will ensure
   the member satisfied basic parachutist badge award criteria IAW Table 7.2
   7.7.2. To request award of an advanced parachutist badge, Air Force members will submit to
   the servicing HARM office an AF Form 196. The servicing HARM office will compare data
   entered on the AF Form 196 with ARMS database jump accomplishments and ensure the
   member satisfied badge award criteria IAW Table 7.2. HARM offices will not publish an
   AO to award an advanced parachutist badge without a completed AF Form 196 from the
   member.

   7.7.2. (AFSOC) Attach AF Form 196, ARMS Request Data for Parachutist Badge, to the
   request for review and award of an advanced parachutist badge. The servicing HARM office
   will ensure the proper remarks are documented on the AO according to AFI 11-421. (T-2)
   7.7.3. The effective date of an AO to award a basic or advanced parachutist badge to a
   member who completed training while a member of another US military service will not be
   prior to the date assigned to a valid UMD jump position and placed on AOs authorizing
   performance of jump duty.
7.8. Prohibiting the Wear of Aviation or Parachutist Badges. All aircrew and parachutist
members qualify for permanent wear of aviation or parachutist badges via completion of USAF
or USAF-equivalent training and/or by performing requisite periods of flying or jump duty. In
most cases, members may continue to wear badges if disqualified from aviation or parachutist
service. Situations may arise, however, when the continued wear of aviation or parachutist
badges is inappropriate. To ensure a consistent policy, adhere to the following guidance:
   7.8.1. Commanders at any review level may recommend prohibiting wear of a rated, CEA,
   or non-rated/non-CEA aviation or parachutist badge if an aircrew member is disqualified
   from aviation service as a result of failure to maintain professional standards or substantiated
   drug abuse. In all cases, prohibit a member from wearing the aviation badge if he or she is
   administratively disqualified for fear of flying, refuses to fly, or exhibits cowardice in
   combat.
       7.8.1.1. Prohibiting the Wear of the Parachutist Badge. A member may lose the right
       to wear the parachutist badge by refusing to jump or requesting removal from jump status
       with less than 18 months of jump duty experience. The unit commander will recommend
       that the MAJCOM approve the request to prohibit wear of the Parachutist Badge. If
       approved, the commander will send the approval memorandum to the servicing HARM
       office to publish an AO. The AO terminating parachute jump status will include the
       specific reason for removal.
   7.8.2. A FEB, or any authority in the FEB review process, may recommend removal of a
   badge.
   7.8.3. The disqualification approval authority is also the final approval authority for
   prohibiting the wear of an aviation or parachutist badge. The approval will be forwarded to
   the HARM office or AF/A3O-AT, as appropriate, to ensure the AO remarks prohibit the
   wear of the aircrew member badge. For example: “Member is prohibited from wearing the
   aircrew member badge per MAJCOM/A3 letter dated YYMMDD.”
       7.8.3.1. The HARM office will delete the badge history from ARMS, however, do not
       revoke the AO(s) that awarded the badge(s).
7.9. Posthumous Award of Aviation Badges. Commanders authorized to award aviation and
parachutist badges may posthumously award the appropriate badge to individuals on AOs who
die in an aviation mishap (aviation badge) or parachutist mishap (parachutist badge) that
occurred during training leading to award of an aviation or parachutist badge.
7.10. Award of Aviation Badges to Members of Other US Military Services or Foreign
Military Services—Graduates From USAF Training Programs. Commanders may present
basic aviation badges to members of other US military services, foreign military services, or
AFI11-402_AFSOCSUP 12 JUNE 2012                                                             129


civilians who successfully complete a USAF training course that would result in award of a basic
aviation badge to USAF personnel. Additionally, foreign flight surgeons that complete the
Advanced Aerospace Medicine for International Medical Officers Course (B3FAY9356), or a
residency in aerospace medicine conducted by the USAF, may be awarded the basic flight
surgeon badge if not previously awarded. Announce the award in an appropriate certificate that
recognizes training completion and the basic badge awarded. Do not publish an AO to award the
badge.
   7.10.1. Only the Chief of Staff, USAF will approve award of advanced pilot, RPA pilot,
   CSO, observer, ABM, or flight surgeon aviation badges for members of foreign military
   services who satisfy the badge criteria IAW Table 2.1
       7.10.1.1. The US Air Force Attaché, Chief of US Air Force Mission, or Chief of US Air
       Force Section Chief (MAAG) residing in the host country requests rated aviation badges
       for foreign military members. Submit the request in letter format through the
       International Affairs Division (SAF/IA), 1010 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC
       20330-1010, to AF/A3O-AT. Forward requests for award of the senior or chief flight
       surgeon badge to SAF/IA, HQ AFMSA/SG3PF IN, 1500 Wilson Blvd, Suite 1200,
       Arlington, VA 22209, and AF/A3O-AT, in turn. Requesting official verifies the:
           7.10.1.1.1. Name and grade of applicant.
           7.10.1.1.2. Statement that applicant is currently and actively qualified as a flying
           member of the foreign military force.
           7.10.1.1.3. Name of the base where the applicant completed USAF undergraduate
           pilot, RPA Fundamentals or CSO training, and the month and year of graduation. For
           flight surgeon badges, specify the date the applicant completed the Aerospace
           Medicine Primary Course (B3OBY4G1-000) or the Advanced Aerospace Medicine
           for International Medical Officers Course (B3FAY48G4-000).
           7.10.1.1.4. Statement that the USAF awarded the basic badge to the individual as a
           result of completing a USAF formal course of flying training. (For pilots only:
           Statement that the applicant possesses flying qualifications comparable to those
           required for USAF instrument qualification.).
           7.10.1.1.5. Total military flying hours.
7.11. Award of Advanced Aviation Badges to Members of Foreign Military Services—
Graduates from Equivalent Training. The CSAF may award advanced aviation badges (pilot,
RPA pilot, CSO, flight surgeon) to members of foreign military services who graduated from
courses considered equivalent to USAF undergraduate flying training programs. The eligibility
criteria (years of service, flying hours, medical qualification, and active military flying
qualification) are the same as listed in Table 2.1 The CSAF is the sole USAF approval authority
for award and presentation of these advanced aviation badges. Requests for exceptions to this
policy are not appropriate.

NOTES:
1. Master applies to officer badges and Chief applies to airman badge.
2. Aviation service includes both active and reserve time. Nonrated crewmember duty only includes
time performed in ASC 9D. Aviation service begins with the ASD IAW paragraph 7.5.1. Periods of
suspension, disqualification, or breaks in service do not count towards aviation service.
3. Months of operational flying: For CEAs use months of OFDA. For nonrated flyers to credit
months of operational flying refer to Note 4. Periods of suspension, disqualification, or breaks in
service do not count towards OFDA.
4. To earn a month of badge credit, members must meet flight performance requirements IAW DoD
FMR, Volume 7A, Chapter 22. The standard is a minimum four hours for active duty, and two hours
(includes inactive time requirement) for ARC per calendar month, or a pro rata share for lesser
periods. A month of HDIP/CEFIP entitlement equals a month of badge credit. Months need not be
consecutive.
5. Officers and airman suspended or disqualified from aviation service are ineligible for advanced
badges, unless requirements were met prior to suspension or disqualification.
6. To receive credit for one month of flying, CEAs in continuous or conditional CEFIP status must
satisfy monthly flight requirements IAW DoD FMR, Volume 7A, Chapter 22. CEAs in continuous
or conditional ACIP status after the 20th year of aviation service must occupy an active flying
position (API A, B, D, and E) for at least 15 days in a given month, and perform OFDA-creditable
flying duties that satisfy conditional CEFIP requirements approved by the FY99 NDAA and listed in
DoD FMR, Volume 7A, Chapter 22.
7.   Grandfathering: Do not amend or revoke AOs for CEAs, non-rated or non-CEA aircrew
AFI11-402_AFSOCSUP 12 JUNE 2012                                                                133


previously awarded badges under different criteria. HARM offices should contact MAJCOM with
questions concerning previous year requirements (prior to this revision) for award of badge, before
revoking or amending an AO.
8. Prior service aircrew members, previously awarded a basic aircrew member badge from another
military service, hired by the Air Force as a CEA (waived from attending initial qualification
training due to previous qualifications), use the date the member is assigned to their first operational
unit to award the Air Force basic aircrew member badge. This is providing the member meets the
requirements listed above for permanent award. If member meets the criteria listed above for award
of advanced badges at the time of transferring services, then use the day after award of basic to
award senior, and day after senior to award chief.
9. Flight nurse aviation service includes periods assigned to AFSC “46F” coded billets. ARMS will
not track these periods. Member must provide supporting documentation that substantiates period(s)
assigned to a “46F” coded billet to the servicing HARM office, e.g. Single Uniform Retrieval File
(SURF).
10. For “1AXXX” performing RPA duty but not converting to “1UXXX”; OFDA accrued while
performing RPA Sensor Operator duties will count towards advanced Airman Aircrew member
badges.
11. Do not credit non-RPA sensor operator flying time and OFDA accumulated in another CEA
specialty towards advanced RPA badges.

NOTES:
1. Time spent in a training course leading to initial qualification as a parachutist does not fulfill the
time requirements listed in column B of Table 7.2.
2. To earn a month of badge credit, members must meet performance requirements IAW DoD FMR,
Volume 7A. A month of HDIP entitlement equals one month of badge credit. Months need not be
consecutive.
3. The 30 jumps must include: (1) Two jumps during the hours of darkness; (2) Fifteen jumps with
operational equipment IAW AFI 11-410; (3) Actually perform one night jump as a Primary JM
(PJM); and (4) Seven jumps performing as PJM.
4. The 65 jumps must include: (1) Four jumps during the hours of darkness; (2) Twenty-five jumps
with operational equipment IAW AFI 11-410; (3) Two night jumps performing PJM duties; and (4)
Fifteen jumps performing as PJM.
5. Do not count non-military jumps toward individual total jumps.
6. All awarded parachutists badges are permanent unless revoked. Use the course completion
certificate and Army order for award of the basic parachutist and basic military free-fall badge.
Personnel who meet the requirements for wear of an advanced Air Force parachutist badge must
apply by completing AF Form 196. The HARM office will maintain a copy of the member’s
application in the JRF. The HARM office maintaining the member’s JRF will publish the AO for
authorized individuals. The AO must specify the Table 7.2. criteria that establishes eligibility. In
addition, the effective date of the order is the date individual met all applicable criteria in Table 7.2.
7. Personnel who obtain MFF qualifications prior to March 1998 are authorized to wear the MFF
badges without submitting an application.
8. Parachutists who are disqualified from parachute duty before fulfilling advanced qualification
criteria are not eligible for advanced badges.
9. Jumps made on non-standard systems are only counted toward the parachutist badge when those
jumps are military in nature or as part of a USAF OT&E process.
10. Includes graduates of the Military Airlift Command High Glide Ratio Parachute (HGRP) Course
and USSOCOM certified Navy MFF course.

                                          Chapter 8

  AIRCREW/PARACHUTIST PREFIX REQUESTS, VALIDATION, FUNDING AND
      WAIVERS OF AIRCREW/PARACHUTIST MANPOWER POSITIONS

8.1. Purpose of Chapter. This chapter describes the procedures, justification process, and
policies for requesting and authorizing aircrew and parachutist (jump) prefixed manpower
positions in order to manage the HDIP budget.
8.2. Applicable to Whom. These procedures apply to all active duty personnel requiring an
aircrew or jump prefix to perform full-time duties as an aircrew or parachutist. ARC components
will request positions through HQ AFRC/A3T or ANG/A3O. ARC guidance will not be less
restrictive than this instruction or AFI 11-412 and AFI 38-201, Determining Manpower
Requirements.
8.3. Responsibilities for Aircrew or Parachutist Management.
   8.3.1. Base Level. Ensure nonrated aircrew and parachutist prefixes are assigned only to
   positions that require full-time flying or jump duties. Annually review all aircrew or
   parachutist prefixed positions not earned through a flying or jump manpower standard (refer
   to Attachment 27). Submit AF Form 480, Aircrew Justification IAW AFI 38-201, or AF
   Form 4322, Active Parachutist Justification (Attachment 26) to justify new nonrated aircrew
   or jump prefixed requests IAW this instruction.
   8.3.1. (AFSOC) Submit AF Forms 480, Aircrew AFSC/Active Flying Justification, and AF
   Forms 4322, Active Parachutist Justification to HQ AFSOC/A3TR for coordination.
   Requests will be coordinated with the command Personnel Parachute Program Manager
   (PPPM), AFSC functional managers (FM), and HQ AFSOC/A1K as required. (T-2)
   8.3.2. Manpower Office. Update parachutist or aircrew requirements once an AF Form 480
   or AF Form 4322 is approved by the authorizing agency for the specific AFSC and position
   number. Coordinate with OPRs on parachutist or nonrated aircrew requirements changes and
   annual review of aircrew requests IAW AFI 38-201, or parachutist requirements IAW this
   instruction. Manpower offices will not move aircrew or “J” prefixes without final approval
   by AF/A3O-AT and A3O-AS (parachutists).
   8.3.3. MAJCOMs, FOAs, DRUs, and Joint Agencies ensure “J” (parachutist) “B”, “C”, “F”,
   “K”, “Q”, and “X” (nonrated officers), and “K”, “Q”, “X” (non-CEA enlisted aircrew)
   prefixes are assigned only to those positions with duties clearly requiring full-time
   parachutist or flying skills to meet mission needs as described in AFI 11-401 and AFI 11-202
   Volume 1 (aircrew) and AFI 11-410 (parachutists). In addition to the required AF Form 480
   maintained IAW AFI 38-201, maintain an AF Form 480 for all nonrated officer or non-CEA
   aircrew prefixed positions and an AF Form 4322 for all “J” prefixed UMD positions not
   gained through a flying/jump unit’s manpower standard. For example: a rated staff J011XX
   UMD position would require an AF Form 4322; a J1T2X1 position in the Special Tactics
   Squadron (STS) would not require an AF Form 4322.
   8.3.3. (AFSOC) Parachute qualification and active jump status are awarded based on
   mission requirements. IAW AFI 11-410, Personnel Parachute Operations, there are two
   types of parachute status: (1) permanent jump status (AFSC inherent 1C2X1 [Combat
AFI11-402_AFSOCSUP 12 JUNE 2012                                                               137


  Control], 1T2X1 [Pararescue Jumper], 1W0X2 [Special Operations Weather], 13DXX
  [Combat Rescue and Special Tactics Officers], 15WCX [Special Operations Weather], and
  “J” prefixed Unit Manning Document [UMD] positions) and (2) temporary jump status. The
  use of parachutes to employ personnel is inherently risky and expensive to establish and
  maintain necessary parachuting skills. There should be few instances where mission
  requirements dictate the need for parachuting as a means of reaching an objective. For these
  reasons, the need for establishing and maintaining jump inherent AFSCs and “J” coded (non-
  jump AFSC) positions must be closely scrutinized and validated with unit mission
  requirements for mandating the hire/retention of an active parachutist assigned to that
  position. If parachuting is not an inherent skill-set required for a particular AFSC (e.g.,
  1C072), commanders must closely assess the need for the expense of a “J” prefixed DAFSC
  manpower position requiring assigned personnel be parachute qualified and jump frequently
  to maintain currency. Approvals are based on unit mission requirements and are not
  authorized to keep a previously qualified parachutist on active status. (T-1)
     8.3.3.1. Assign an OPR within the MAJCOM, FOA, DRU, and Joint Agency staff to
     coordinate on additions or changes to nonrated aircrew or parachutist requirements and
     maintain the command’s non-rated or non-CEA aircrew or parachutist active flying/jump
     justification forms. MAJCOM OPRs will ensure jump or aircrew prefixes are not moved
     or assigned to other positions without final approval by AF/A3O-AT and A3O-AS
     (parachutists). Forward OPR information to AF/A3O-AT.
         8.3.3.1.1. Coordinate with AF/A3O-AT or AF/A3O-AS for all new positions or
         changes to existing positions for jump (“J”), nonrated officer (“B”, “C”, “F”, “X”,
         “K”, and “Q”) or non-CEA aircrew (“X”, “K”,”Q”) prefixed positions not gained by a
         flying or jump unit’s manpower standard. Use the flying or jump justification forms
         IAW paragraph 8.3.3. above. An officer position may be dual coded (B-operations
         officer, C-commander, or F-flight test); the AO remarks, however, will reflect that the
         position is an authorized aircrew or parachutist billet.
             8.3.3.1.1.1. (Added-AFSOC) Permanent Jump Status.           DAFSCs 1C2XX,
             1T2XX, 1W0X2, 13DXX, and 15WCX or “J” prefixes are added to the UMD
             positions to validate an operational requirement for frequent and recurring
             parachute duty. Once assigned to a jump position and currency is obtained and
             maintained, incumbents are entitled to receive HDIP when jump requirements are
             met. HQ AFSOC/A3T is the MAJCOM approval authority for permanent jump
             status requests. HQ AFSOC A3T will forward to HQ AF/A3O-AS for approval
             and will coordinate with HQ AF/A3O-AT (to validate funds availability) for
             effective date. (T-1)
             8.3.3.1.1.2. (Added-AFSOC) Temporary Jump Status. Parachutist qualified
             personnel not assigned to a valid jump position may be authorized temporary
             jump status for extended periods outlined in AFI 11-410. AOs and HDIP are only
             authorized for the period of the requirement (e.g., to support an airborne exercise),
             when jump requirements are met. AFSOC/A3 is the MAJCOM approval
             authority IAW AFI 11-410 for temporary jump status. (T-1)
         8.3.3.1.2. AF/A3O-AT approves additions or changes to aircrew prefixed positions
         and AF/A3O-AS approves additions or changes to parachutist positions with
 138                                                 AFI11-402_AFSOCSUP 12 JUNE 2012


          coordination from AF/A3O-AT. Requests to add aircrew or parachutist prefixes to
          enlisted AFSCs must first be coordinated through the AFSC career field manager.
          Requests to add parachutist prefixes to flight surgeon positions must be coordinated
          through AFMSA/SG3PF. Requests to add aircrew or parachutist prefixes to general
          officer UMD positions must first be coordinated/ approved by the Air Force General
          Officer Management Office (AFGOMO).
          8.3.3.1.3. Ensure command flying and jump justification requirements are validated
          annually, NLT 31 August. Notify AF/A3O-AT NLT 30 September, acknowledging
          completion of annual review (refer to Attachment 28).
          8.3.3.1.3. (AFSOC) HQ AFSOC/A3TR is responsible for reviewing and validating
          all “J” prefixed UMD positions within AFSOC. After HQ AFSOC/A3TR completes
          its validation, HQ AFSOC/A3T will review and ensure “J” prefixes are removed from
          positions that no longer depict an active parachutist requirement or for extended
          periods (more than a year) of non-jump activity. (T-2)
8.4. Procedures:
   8.4.1. Requesting new aircrew/parachutist authorizations.
       8.4.1.1. Forward all requests for new DAFSC authorizations that do not currently contain
       an aircrew or jump prefix on an AF Form 480 or AF Form 4322 through the MAJCOM
       AFSC Functional Manager (FM) for validation of jump/flight requirement, then to the
       MAJCOM Aircrew or Parachutist Management and Manpower offices and, finally, to
       AF/A3O-AT and AF/A3O-AS (parachutist coding only). Upon receipt, AF/A3O-AT and
       A3O-AS (jump positions) will approve or disapprove the request.
       8.4.1.1. (AFSOC) For new parachutist or non-rated aircrew positions, forward packages
       through the servicing HARM office, member/owning unit‘s group channels, 720 STG or
       724 STG (jump packages only), to HQ AFSOC/A3T. Submitters will ensure the SSS
       includes MAJCOM and Air Staff coordination: career field/AFSC FM, Personnel
       Parachutist Program Manager (jump positions only), HQ AFSOC/A1M, HQ
       AFSOC/A3T, and AFSOC/A3 (temporary jump status only), HQ AF/A3O-AT
       (permanent), and HQ AF/A3O-AS (permanent). (T-1)
       8.4.1.2. Requesters should plan at least nine months in advance for inclusion of a new
       AFSC in a MAJCOM specific aircraft crew complement listed in AFI 65-503, Table
       A36-1 and securing of funds to process AOs for flight or jump status. Addition to Table
       A36-1 in AFI 65-503 is the first step. If the AFSC was not previously authorized aircrew
       member status in a MAJCOM specific aircraft crew complement, HQ AFPC/DPPAC
       must approve a change proposal to add the specialty as authorized an aircrew prefix in
       AFI 36-2101. Once a request is approved for an aircrew prefix in AFI 65-503, Table
       A36-1, approved for inclusion IAW AFI 36-2101, and funding is secured, AF/A3O-AT
       will notify the requesting MAJCOM Manpower Directorate of both approvals and the
       effective date for adding the prefix to the UMD. MAJCOM manpower offices will not
       update aircrew or parachutist prefixes to the respective units without approval from
       AF/A3O-AT or AF/A3O-AS (parachutist). Units will not assign a member to aircrew
       duty unless the member's DAFSC is listed in AFI 65-503, Table A36-1 for that
       MAJCOM. HARM offices will not publish AOs or MPOs without AF/A3O-AT or AF/
AFI11-402_AFSOCSUP 12 JUNE 2012                                                            139


     A3O-AS (parachutist) documentation approving the specialty for aircrew or parachutist
     member duties.
     8.4.1.3. If the request is disapproved:
         8.4.1.3.1. Requests that do not meet the required justification for aircrew prefixes
         may be recommended for the Operational Support Flyer program (Chapter 6), non-
         interference flying IAW AFI 11-401, or temporary jump status IAW AFI 11-410.
         8.4.1.3.2. Organizations that submit requests subsequently returned with a
         recommendation to request man-years in the operational support program or non-
         interference AOs, should contact the local HARM office for assistance. Do not assign
         members to aircrew duty unless the member's DAFSC is listed in AFI 65-503, Table
         A36-1.
  8.4.2. Requests for additional authorizations (existing aircrew/jump AFSCs).
     8.4.2.1. The authorized manning level for each aircrew/jump position (on UMD)
     determines the number of members authorized aircrew or parachutist status at any given
     time. The total number of non-rated or non-CEA aircrew or jump authorizations
     determine how many are authorized flying or jump status at one time. Except for the 90-
     day overlap described below (PCS or PCA actions), no other excess members on AOs are
     authorized for non-rated or non-CEA aircrew or parachutists without AF/A3O-AT
     approval. MAJCOMs will establish procedures to ensure units do not exceed authorized
     manpower levels without waiver approval IAW AFI 11-401, AFI 11-402, or AFI 11-412,
     as applicable. HARM offices will perform a monthly review of all nonrated/parachutist
     positions to ensure authorized manning levels are not exceeded. HARM offices will
     terminate AOs for excess nonrated aircrew members/parachutists unless otherwise
     authorized by this instruction or a waiver request approved by AF/A3O-AT. NOTE:
     During manning shortages, jump unit commanders may authorize excess parachutists in
     jump inherent DAFSCs billets to have active jump AOs published against empty jump
     DAFSC UMD authorizations. See paragraph 1.12.3.6.3
         8.4.2.1.1. Only qualified members assigned to authorized jump or flying billets and
         on AOs requiring frequent and regular flight/jumps according to this instruction are
         entitled to HDIP once the jump or flight requirements are met, as prescribed in AFI
         11-421 and DoD FMR, Volume 7A, Chapter 22. The base HARM office, MAJCOM
         Aviation Resource Manager (ARM), and HQ AF/A3O-AT ARM Career Field
         Manager are responsible for interpreting and validating requirements and to ensure
         compliance with DOD and Air Force guidance for entitlement to HDIP.
         8.4.2.1.2. When a unit level organization requires additional non-rated or non-CEA
         aircrew members to satisfy the unit or command mission, forward written requests
         through the MAJCOM AFSC functional manager and the senior enlisted aircrew
         manager before review by the MAJCOM/A3 and A8. The MAJCOM/A3 will forward
         recommendations for approval to AF/A3O-AT. These requests constitute changes to
         the authorized crew complement and will be coordinated with the appropriate Air
         Staff offices. In addition to the justification, the package will include the manpower
         offset for the FYDP. Requests received without manpower justification will be
         returned.
 140                                                 AFI11-402_AFSOCSUP 12 JUNE 2012


          8.4.2.1.3. Except as noted below, authorized nonrated aircrew or parachutist manning
          provides for TDY, contingency requirements, leaves, replacement training, and so
          forth. However, temporary overmanning may be necessary. If so, coordinate
          requirements through the MAJCOM (active duty units), NGB/TE (National Guard
          units), or HQ AFRC/A3T (Reserve units) to the MAJCOM/A3 for over manning of
          periods not to exceed 180 calendar days that requires a waiver for both incumbents to
          fly (aircrew) or jump (parachutist). Send an information copy to AF/A3O-AT.
          Commanders will not request AOs or direct excess members not authorized AOs by
          this instruction to fly/jump without an approved waiver from MAJCOM/A3; this
          includes formal flying/jump school (Attachment 25). Except for short durations as
          noted below, HARM offices will not publish AOs authorizing excess members
          (double billeted) flying or jump status without approval from MAJCOM/A3.
          AF/A3O-AT is the approval authority for all cases waived beyond 181 days.
              8.4.2.1.3.1. Commanders may request AOs for members who are excess due to
              PCS/PCA actions provided they have filled all open aircrew or parachutist billets
              first (not more than 90 days).
              8.4.2.1.3.2. Commanders may request AOs for members assigned against
              approved manpower position increases not yet published on the UMD. Before
              publication of the AO, the HARM office must receive confirmation (copy of the
              document) from the owning unit of the future funded billet. Active duty HARM
              offices will forward a copy of this AO to AF/A3O-AT to adjust the HDIP budget.
   8.4.3. Force structure changes. MAJCOMs that are fielding a new weapons system should
   ensure the MAJCOM Manpower and Operations functional communities coordinate the new
   requirements with AF/A3O-AT. The purpose of this coordination is to: (a) ensure the new
   weapons system is reflected in AFI 65-503, Table A36-1 and AFI 36-2101, (b) allow for
   budgeting of aircrew member incentive pays, (c) allow accessions personnel to program for
   the new requirements, and (d) allow assignment personnel sufficient time to supply all units
   accordingly.
8.5. Staff Positions Changes and Additions. When a Wing, NAF, or MAJCOM organization
has a requirement to add nonrated aircrew or jump prefixed authorizations, forward requests via
AF Form 480 or AF Form 4322 as applicable to AF/A3O-AT or A3O-AS (parachutists) for
validation and approval of funding.
   8.5.1. (Added-AFSOC) Jump packages will include request letter, AF Form 4322, ARMS
   Jump History Report (JHR), and previous jump status and qualification AOs. (T-2)
8.6. Funding for Non-rated, Non-CEA, or Jump Incentive Pay Requirements. There is no
requirement for MAJCOMs to submit annual requests for HDIP funding. Funds to support
incentive payments are budgeted as a result of AF/A3O-AT validation of the aircrew and
parachutist requirements and award of the flying DAFSC. At least nine months are required to
ensure funds are secured for future non-rated or non-CEA aircrew and parachutist coded UMD
DAFSCs and temporary "J" coding.
   8.6.1. The number of non-rated aircrew and parachutist positions (“J” prefixed DAFSC or
   jump inherent UMD positions IAW AFI 11-410) authorized on the UMD determines the
AFI11-402_AFSOCSUP 12 JUNE 2012                                                          141


  incentive pay allocation. This includes those members who are excess due to PCS/PCA
  overlaps, future funded billets, and those members assigned by waiver approval.
     8.6.1.1. AF/A3O-AS will closely monitor how many new "J" coded requests are
     approved and ensure funds are secured by current or future AF/A3O-AT HDIP budgets
     prior to approval of such requests.
        8.6.1.1.1. MAJCOMs will anually audit jump and non-rated or non-CEA aircrew
        positions not gained through a flying or jump unit manpower standard to ensure a
        full-time jump or flying requirement exists.
        8.6.1.1.2. AF/A3O-AS will send to AF/A3O-AT an approved active parachutist
        justification, specifying the period "J" coding will be effective to ensure funds are
        available. AF/A3O-AT will provide a date funds will be available for approval of
        coding for processing of AOs. "J" coding will not be approved nor AOs processed
        prior to authentication of fund availability.
     8.6.1.2. MAJCOM commanders will closely monitor and ensure funds are secured by
     AF/A3O-AT prior to approving temporary jump status or requesting new permanent "J"
     prefixed UMD positions. Send AF/A3O-AT an approved AF Form 4322, specifying the
     period that temporary "J" coding is needed, to ensure funds are available.
     8.6.1.3. Unit commanders will closely monitor UMD authorizations and allow only the
     minimum number of people necessary for successful in-flight and parachutist mission
     accomplishment.
     8.6.1.4. MPFs will establish controls to ensure UMD-authorized manning levels are not
     exceeded.
     8.6.1.5. HARM offices will brief commanders if manning levels exceed authorized
     limits. HARM offices will validate UMD authorizations prior to publishing AOs and will
     not initiate AOs for members in excess of the authorized non-rated/non-CEA aircrew or
     parachutist manning level unless authorized by this instruction or a waiver from
     AF/A3O-AT.
        8.6.1.5.1. AOs for excess nonrated officer/enlisted aircrew and parachutist members
        are authorized for no more than a 90-day period for PCS/PCA actions or awaiting a
        DAFSC conversion. Double billeted flight surgeons and staff flyers (APIs B, D, 5, 6,
        and 8) will not have active flying AOs and fly more than a 30-day period without a
        waiver IAW AFI 11-401. Terminate AOs for excess parachutists/non-rated or non-
        CEA aircrew members on the 91st day of overlap unless authorized to continue
        jumping/flying by this instruction or a waiver from AF/A3O-AT.
  8.6.2. Prescribed Forms: AF Form 196, Data for Parachutist Rating and AF Form 4322,
  Active Parachutist Justification.

Terms
Aeronautical Order (AO)—Start or end aviation or parachutist career service, determine
entitlement to ACIP, HDIP, CEFIP, disqualify or requalify members for aviation or parachutist
service, authorize operational support or noninterference flying, update/change an Aviation
Service Code and award basic and advanced aeronautical ratings and aviation and parachutist
badges.
Aeronautical Rating Board (ARB)—A board of rated officers tasked to review the professional
flying credentials of officers whose undergraduate flight training was conducted by another US
Military Service. The ARB makes recommendations to higher authorities on the individual's
potential for award of a USAF aeronautical rating.
Active Guard Reserve (AGR)—Air National Guard or Air Force Reserve officers on full-time
active duty status (extended active duty).
Active-Pipeline—A student officer/CEA who has not successfully completed mission
qualification in an MDS (non-Trainer AETC aircraft), never received a Form 8, or was not
previously qualified in a different aircrew position.
Aviation Career Incentive Pay (ACIP)—Entitlement to ACIP shall be restricted to regular and
reserve officers who hold, are in training leading to, an aeronautical rating, or designation and
who engage and remain in aviation service on a career basis.
Aviation Service—"Aviation service" applies to all USAF and ARC members who hold an
aeronautical rating, qualified for aviation service, are required to obtain/maintain flying skills,
perform essential in-flight duties, or have met their flying gate requirements and are on AOs as
career aviators. Policy distinguishes between rated officer, CEA, non-rated officer, or non-CEA
aircrew members, and operational support fliers. Differences regarding qualifications,
termination, and entitlements show varying degrees of aviation career involvement. Nonetheless,
all members must be professionally and physically qualified and on an AO requiring frequent
and regular flight.
Aviation Service Career (extended active duty or on Active Duty Guard and Reserve)—An
officer on extended active duty who holds an aeronautical rating and is qualified for aviation
service IAW AFI 11-401 and this instruction, shall be considered to be performing aviation
service on a career basis, as prescribed in Title 37, U.S.C. 301a, so long as they are performing
operational flying duty, or are assigned to a rated position in a Reserve component, or are
considered by that component as an asset to the rated inventory IAW AFI 11-412.
Aviation Service Career (Not on Extended Active Duty nor on Active Guard and Reserve
(AGR) duty)—An officer not on extended active duty who holds an aeronautical order and is
qualified for aviation service IAW AFI 11-401 and this instruction, shall be considered to be
performing aviation service on a career basis, as prescribed in Title 37, U.S.C. 301a, so long as
they are performing operational flying duty, or are assigned to a rated position in a Reserve
component, or are considered by that component as an asset to the rated inventory, and within
the preceding 24 months was either on extended active duty as a rated officer or assigned to a
rated (API 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9) position in a Reserve component IAW DoD FMR, Volume
7A.
 150                                                     AFI11-402_AFSOCSUP 12 JUNE 2012


Aviation Service Code (ASC)—An ASC is a two-character code indicating incentive pay
entitlement and flying status. (Refer to AFI 11-401.
Career Enlisted Aviators (CEAs)—AFI 65-503, Table A36-1 identifies authorized aircrew
positions and individuals must hold the correct Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) and AFSC
prefix (when appropriate). AF considers aircrew members in the 1AXXX or (Remotely Piloted
Aircraft (RPA) Sensor Operator) 1UXXX (Airman Aircrew Operations) career field to be career
aviators.
Career Enlisted Flyer Incentive Pay (CEFIP)—Incentive pay for CEAs in an aviation career
as authorized in the National Defense Authorization Act of 2000. Exception: Remotely Piloted
Aircraft Sensor Operators are not entitled to CEFIP.
Command Channels—Aviation service matters are usually processed in the chain of command
within the MAJCOM the individual is assigned for flying. Actions enter command channels
through the Host Aviation Resource Management (HARM office) office. MAJCOM Aviation
Management offices must review all aviation and parachutist related actions. If an individual is
attached for flying, this may require the commander of a unit under one MAJCOM to initiate the
action and command channels of another MAJCOM to complete the review process.
Commander—"Commander" refers to a squadron commander (or comparable level) of a flying
unit to which an individual is assigned or attached for flying. If an ARC indivdual is activated,
authority is delegated to the active duty commnder they are assigned or attached to for flying.
Disqualification of a Member—When no longer medically or professionally qualified to
perform aviation service, a member is disqualified. Disqualification terminates flying incentive
pay.
Entitlement—Members under competent orders to participate in regular and frequent aerial
flights as crew or non-crew members, who otherwise meet the requirements of this AFI and DoD
FMR, Volume 7A.
Flying Evaluation Board (FEB)—An administrative, fact-finding proceeding designed to
ensure the quality control of the rated, CEA, non-rated officer, or non-CEA aircrew force. A
board consists of officers (rated and non-rated) and NCOs who are qualified for aviation service
and are serving in an active ASC. Board members examine an aircrew members professional
qualification for aviation service, evaluate potential for use in future aviation duties, and make
recommendations to higher authorities
Frequent and Regular—"Frequent and regular" is a DoD FMR, Volume 7A term which
establishes the minimum monthly flight requirements to be entitled to conditional ACIP or
HDIP, or CEFIP. The DoD FMR Volume 7A sets the minimum at four hours for active duty and
two hours for ARC per calendar month, or a prorated share for lesser periods. By itself, the
requirement to fly frequently and regularly is not justification to assign an individual to aircrew
or operational support flier status. There must be a need to perform in-flight duties.
In-flight Duties—In-flight duties are duties essential to the operation of specified aircraft, i.e.,
essential to the in-flight mission, test, operation, or maintenance of the aircraft, or the in-flight
test, operation, or maintenance of aircraft-installed equipment basic to the mission of the aircraft.
Man-Year—A specific budgetary obligation of funds to support payment of incentive pay for
one individual for one fiscal year. AF/A3O-AT allocates man-years and fractions of man-years
AFI11-402_AFSOCSUP 12 JUNE 2012                                                              151


for each approved aviation service duty requirement. Commanders can supply man-years as one
individual for one year, three individuals for four months, two individuals for six months and so
forth.
Non-rated or Non-CEA Aircrew Member—A non-rated officer or non-CEA enlisted member
aircrew member qualified for aviation service, assigned to an approved aircrew prefixed position,
listed in an aircraft’s crew composition complement in AFI 65-503, Table A36-1 and required to
perform aircrew duties on a full-time basis in order for the aircraft to perform its primary
mission. They are responsible for the safe ground and flight operations of the aircraft and
onboard systems.
Operational Support Flier (OSF)—An individual whose primary, full time duty does not
require flying. However, the Air Force may require these individuals to fly on an occasional
basis in order to perform a specific, essential in-flight duty that a regularly assigned
aircrew/mission crewmember cannot perform. Duties may include, but are not limited to, in-
flight test, operation or maintenance of aircraft systems or installed equipment. Commanders
must place operational support fliers on AOs for them to be entitled to receive hazardous duty
incentive pay.
Parachutist—AFI 11-412 identifies authorized parachutist UMD positions and individuals must
hold the correct Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) and AFSC prefix (when appropriate).
Parachutist Service—"Parachutist service" applies to all USAF and ARC members required to
obtain/ maintain jumping skills and perform essential jump duties. Policy distinguishes between
aircrew member parachutists (dual requirements to fly and jump) required to maintain
parachutist status and non-aircrew parachutist status (officer and enlisted) only. Differences
regarding qualifications, termination, and entitlements show varying degrees of parachutist
career involvement. Nonetheless, all members must be professionally and physically qualified
and on an AO requiring frequent and regular jump.
Rated Aircrew Member—A rated aircrew member is a commissioned officer who holds a
USAF aeronautical rating. The USAF considers rated officers to be in career aviation status and
awards ratings only to pilots, RPA pilot, CSOs, ABMs, observers, and flight surgeons. Only
USAF or USAF-approved rated officers are entitled to ACIP or HDIP. Note: References to
“CSO” include individuals previously awarded the “Navigator” rating.
Rated Duty—A rated aircrew member qualified for aviation service performing rated duties
while assigned to a rated API (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9) UMD coded position.Rated duty
terminates upon separation, retirement, suspension, and disqualification from aviation service.
Suspension of Member—Suspension is a temporary termination of aviation service while a
member's future aviation service is under review. Suspension stops flying incentive pay until the
member's aviation status is resolved. IAW DoD FMR, Volume 7A, if a member remains
qualified for aviation service, the commander may remove the suspension and restore the
member's back pay for all or part of the suspension.

     SUGGESTED PRELIMINARY INSTRUCTIONS FOR A FLYING EVALUATION
                               BOARD

                                                SAMPLE
INTRODUCTION: These instructions are not required but are provided as guidance for legal
advisors. Do not use these instructions without modifying them to meet the existing
circumstances.
LA
My duty as legal advisor is to help ensure a fair, impartial, and orderly hearing. I can make
advisory rulings on the admissibility of evidence, procedural matters, and other questions and
objections arising during the hearing. However, my rulings are not final. The senior board
member will make the final determination. After all evidence is presented, I will advise the board
on procedures to follow in closed session. Your responsibility as board members is to act as
impartial fact finders. Your findings will have great significance to the respondent and the
United States Air Force. Given the facts, you will have to draw conclusions, determine findings,
and make recommendations concerning the disposition of this case. Your findings must be
consistent with the facts and your recommendations consistent with the findings and IAW AFI
11-402. Each of you must be satisfied you can fairly and impartially hear this case. Later, the
respondent and the respondent’s counsel may question you on this point. If you are not
convinced you can act impartially, say so now.
(Let the record reflect a negative response.)
The recorder will present evidence concerning the reasons for convening the board. When the
recorder's presentation is concluded, the respondent, with the assistance of counsel, has the right
to submit additional evidence. Evidence consists only of documents and testimony admitted
before you. Disregard extraneous matters and evidence excluded by the senior board member.
When evaluating the evidence, use the training and experience you have gathered throughout
your careers.
Examination of witnesses is conducted first by the party calling the witness. After direct
examination, cross-examination may follow. After questioning by both the recorder and the
respondent's counsel, members of the board may ask questions. In addition, members of the
board may call witnesses before the board if they feel those witnesses have information that is
relevant. The same is true of documentary evidence. You should exercise caution in this area. It
is sometimes easy to become overzealous and forget or ignore the responsibility to remain
impartial. If it is necessary to ask questions, confine your questions to matters before the board.
Some or all of you may have had access to privileged information that may be relevant ot the
matters before this board. I strongly caution you to completely insulate these proceedings from
such information, refrain from discussing it in your deliberations, whether it be in documentary
form (such as material taken from Part 2 of formal safety reports, status and final safety
messages or any other reports or documents containing privileged safety information) or through
witness testimony. AFI 91-204, paragraph 3.2.2.3., specifically prohibits the use of privileged
safety information as evidence in flying evaluation board hearings or reviews, and violations of
that provision are punishable under Article 92(1), UCMJ.
 176                                                    AFI11-402_AFSOCSUP 12 JUNE 2012


It is a good idea to take notes as the testimony proceeds. The notes are invaluable in your later
deliberations and they help avoid repetitive questioning.
When you wish to ask a question, please identify yourself so the reporter may identify you for
the record. Members of the board are prohibited from making off-the-record statements. If
comment on a witness' testimony is necessary, the recorder or respondent's counsel may refer to
it in final argument or the board members are not bound by the formal rules of evidence
prescribed for deliberations. Finally, administrative boards are not bound by the formal rules of
evidence prescribed for trials by court-martial. All reliable evidence should be considered. You
should consider all evidence admitted by the Senior Board Member, giving each item the weight
it merits
Are there any questions?

Limit questions to the grounds of the challenge.)
REC (addressing challenge member)
Q. Do you want to make a statement regarding the challenge?
A.
(The respondent, the respondent’s counsel, all voting members, and the recorder may question
challenged member.) When it is clear the member cannot conscientiously participate or the
challenge would be unanimously sustained, the senior board member should state:
SBM
Provided no voting member objects, (grade and name) is excused.
NOTE: If the challenge is disputed, the senior board member states:
SBM
This session will be closed to consider the challenge. (Session is closed. Respondent, his or her
counsel, and the challenged member withdraw. Determination is made by majority vote of the
other voting members; a tie disqualifies the member challenged.)
(Session opens.)
SBM
The board is open. The challenge (is/is not) sustained.
NOTE: If the challenge is sustained, the challenged member is excused and the action is noted
in the record. The remaining members constitute the board unless additional members are
necessary to constitute a quorum. If a challenge reduces the number of members below a quorum
(three), the board will recess until additional members are obtained. If alternate members must be
obtained, all proceedings will be read to the new member in the presence of the respondent and
his/her counsel. Give the respondent the opportunity to challenge the new member for cause.

      SUGGESTED FLYING EVALUATION BOARD CLOSING INSTRUCTIONS

These instructions serve as a guide for legal advisors. Do not use them without modifying them
to meet specific circumstances.

In a few moments, you will go into closed session to determine findings and recommendations.
Your objective is to determine findings based upon the facts of the case and make
recommendations consistent with the findings. This information will assist the proper authority
when making a final decision. Carefully phrase your findings to include the substance of the
facts established by evidence and make a finding on each allegation. Do not comment on
collateral matters raised by the evidence.

Findings must be specific and supported by the preponderance of evidence. A preponderance of
evidence means that evidence which, when fairly considered, produces the stronger impression,
has the greater weight, and is more convincing, as to its truth when weighed against any evidence
in opposition to it. It does not refer to the greater number of witnesses or documents. Use your
best judgment and common sense to resolve disputed or conflicting evidence. When assessing
the credibility of a witness, consider all the circumstances; for example, demeanor, manner of
testifying, interest in the outcome of the case, friendships, biases, and prejudices.


Voting on the findings and recommendations should be by written ballot and a majority must
agree on each finding and recommendation. If necessary, you may submit a minority report. If
you need additional legal assistance or there is a question regarding procedure, you may reopen
the board. If the assistance is solely to put findings and recommendations into proper form, I may
enter the closed session. If I enter the closed session, the recorder must be present and the
proceedings become part of the transcript.

Please disregard any statements I made during these proceedings that may indicate my opinion
regarding what the findings and recommendations should be. You alone are responsible for
those determinations.

Are there any questions?

A.

(If the answer is "no", the recorder should make the following statement before proceeding with
the introduction of evidence.)

REC

Let the record show the respondent challenged no member. (If answer is "yes," the recorder
should proceed with the challenge proceedings.)

requests they be marked as exhibits and attached to the report. The senior board member
ascertains whether there are any objections and rules on the admissibility of the evidence.

REC

I call (name) as a witness.

NOTE: The witness, if military, reports to the senior board member. The witness faces the
recorder to be sworn.

REC (stands and addresses witness)

Please stand, raise your right hand, and be sworn. "Do you swear the evidence you shall give is
the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?”

REC (use the procedures at Attachment 18 for procedures for examining witnesses.)

REC

I have no other witnesses and no other evidence to present.

SBM (addresses respondent)

You now have the opportunity to introduce evidence in your behalf, either by calling witnesses
or by introducing documentary evidence. As previously explained, you have the right to submit

SBM (at end of examination of witness)

Q. Do you wish to testify, under oath on your own behalf?

A.

NOTE: If the respondent testifies as a witness, the recorder administers the oath and explains
Article 31, UCMJ. If the respondent does not testify as a witness, go to page 154 after the
respondent is excused as a witness.

REC (stands and addresses respondent)

Please stand, raise your right hand, and be sworn. "Do you swear the evidence you shall give is
the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?”

REC (addressed respondent)

Q. Are you the respondent in this case?

A.

I will now read from Article 31, Uniform Code of Military Justice:

   (a) No person subject to this code shall compel any persons to incriminate themselves or to
answer any question the answer to which may tend to incriminate them.

    (b) No person subject to this code shall interrogate, or request any statement from, an
accused or persons suspected of an offense without first informing them of the nature of the
accusation and advising them that they do not have to make any statement regarding the offense
of which they are accused or suspected and that any statement made by them may be used as
evidence against them in a trial by court-martial.

    (c) No person subject to this code shall compel any persons to make a statement or produce
evidence before any military tribunal if the statement or evidence is not material to the issue and
may tend to degrade them.

     (d) No statement obtained from persons in violation of this article, or through the use of
 202                                                  AFI11-402_AFSOCSUP 12 JUNE 2012


coercion, unlawful influence, or unlawful inducement shall be received in evidence against them
in a trial by court-martial.

Q. Do you understand your rights?

A.

NOTE: His or her counsel, voting members of the board, and the recorder, may question the
respondent.

SBM (at end of examination)

The respondent is excused as a witness.

SBM

SBM (addresses respondent)

Q. Does the respondent desire to make an unsworn statement? An unsworn statement is not
evidence and you cannot be cross- examined on it; what weight the board attaches to it rests
solely with the board. Furthermore, the board may elicit evidence from other sources to rebut
anything in your statement. The statement may be oral or in writing, or both. You may make it
yourself, or it may be made by your counsel, or by both of you. Consult with your counsel and
advise the board what you want to do.

A.

SMB

Q. Does the respondent desire to present any further evidence to the board?

A.

SBM

Q. Does the recorder have evidence in rebuttal?

A. (If yes, recorder introduces evidence in rebuttal and witnesses are sworn and examined as
before.)

SBM

Q. Does any member of the board wish to have any witnesses called or recalled, or does any
member of the board desire that the recorder secure any additional information?

A. (If any board member makes a request, the recorder will comply.)

The board is closed. (The board goes into deliberations and personnel not part of the board
withdraw.)

                     CONVENING AUTHORITY INITIATED (T-2)



MEMORANDUM FOR 99 SOS/DOTS, CAPTAIN JOHNNY B. GOODE

FROM: 13 SOW/CC
      123 N Commando Blvd Ste 1947
      Chindit AFB, AZ 99999-1234

SUBJECT: Notification of Flying Evaluation Board Waiver

1. A Flying Evaluation Board (FEB) was considered to weigh evidence concerning your failure
to meet training standards while enrolled in the AC-130H navigator course and make
recommendations regarding your future use in flying duties. However, given your prior
qualification in the C-130E and C-130J, it is likely that a board would recommend you remain in
aviation service and be returned to the aircraft and crew position in which you were previously
qualified . IAW AFI 11-402, paragraph 4.7.1., an FEB waiver will be submitted in lieu of an
FEB (hearing) to recommend you return to your previously qualified aircraft and crew position.
HQ AFSOC/A3 will determine final action.

2. IAW AFI 11-402, paragraph, 3.6., your aviation service is suspended effective the date of this
letter and will remain suspended throughout the FEB waiver process. Your flight pay will be
terminated the day prior to the effective date of your suspension.

3. Cause exists to convene a board IAW AFI 11-402, paragraph 4.3.3., Failure to Meet Training
Standards. It is alleged that your performance in the aircraft demonstrates a lack of aircrew
proficiency and reveals that you are unsuited for duty as an AC-130H navigator. A trend of
substandard performance is documented through three additional Commander Directed Training
programs and a Q-3 evaluation on 31 May 2010. Furthermore, at the completion of your
additional training, you were recommended to return to your previously qualified aircraft and
crew position since your performance did not warrant continued training or an evaluation.

4. IAW AFI 11-402, paragraph 4.4.7.3., you have the option of requesting an FEB instead of
accepting the FEB waiver. This would provide you the opportunity to examine and cross-
examine witnesses, submit evidence, testify or make a statement, and submit a brief.

5. IAW AFI 11-402, paragraph 4.4.6., and Attachment 15, you may submit an application for
voluntary disqualification from aviation service in lieu of an FEB or FEB waiver.

6. Acknowledge receipt of this notification by endorsement no later than ____________. Your
reply will include the following:

   a. A statement that you do or do not accept an FEB waiver.

    b. A statement that you either request an FEB in lieu of the waiver, or you waive your right
to have an FEB consider your qualifications for continued aviation service.

7. IAW AFI 11-402_AFSOCSUP, paragraph 4.7.1., you are directed to meet with legal counsel
prior to issuing your response.

8. A copy of AFI 11-402 is available for your use at http://www.e-publishing.af.mil.
