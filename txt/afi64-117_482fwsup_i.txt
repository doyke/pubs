SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. This revision
incorporates recommendations from the General Accounting Office (GAO) as a result of Audit
#GAO-03-292, entitled ―Purchase Cards--Control Weaknesses Leave the Air Force Vulnerable
to Fraud, Waste, and Abuse,‖ as well as several other required changes and other administrative
and clerical changes. Specifically, changes include the requirement that, as of January 1, 2004,
paper purchased using the GPC must be 50% post-consumer recycled paper, as well as a
requirement for A/OPCs to suspend all alternate cardholder accounts if the primary account
holders are available. In addition, the 7:1 ratio of cardholders to approval officials is required,
rather than preferred, and criteria for requesting a waiver to this requirement is included. Also,
convenience check privileges of cardholders who misuse the checks more than once will be
cancelled, and A/OPCs must review all approving official accounts in the bank’s electronic
access system quarterly to ensure that no cardholder is acting as approving official for his own
account. In addition, A/OPCs must now take the GPC training course developed by GSA and all
cardholders, approving officials, and A/OPCs must verify that all potentially fraudulent and
erroneous transactions that are detected are properly resolved. GPC surveillance requirements are
more stringent and include making the use of the Surveillance Guide on the SAF/AQC
homepage mandatory, increasing the criteria for the reports on annual surveillance, requiring that
A/OPC must provide quarterly status reports to their installation Contracting Director/contracting
squadron commander, as well as requiring that the Contracting Director/contracting squadron
commander must sign the reports on the results of annual surveillance and address these results
to the unit commander. The reports must include recommendations for unit commander action
where approving officials and cardholders have failed to follow Air Force policy. Approving
officials are required to have annual purchase card refresher training and A/OPCs must identify
vendors with which they used purchase cards to make frequent, recurring purchases, evaluate
purchasing practices with those vendors, and where appropriate, develop contracts with those
vendors to optimize Air Force purchasing power. Criteria, documentation requirements and
instructions for maintaining independent verification of receipt of items purchased with the GPC
have been added. In addition, it is clarified that the Air National Guard contracting offices are
not subject to compliance with this AFI except for payment related issues. Also, cardholders
within the Intelligence and Tactical agencies or activities are subject to DOD 3300.2 and are
therefore exempt from using DAPS. Additionally, it is clarified that the use of appropriated funds
for non-mission essential publications is not an authorized expenditure.

                                           Chapter 2

               AUTHORIZED AND UNAUTHORIZED USE OF THE GPC

2.1. Authorized Use of the GPC.
   2.1.1. The use of the card constitutes expenditure of appropriated funds and is limited to
   official authorized transactions only. Some organizations have both appropriated and non-
   appropriated funds available for use. Separate cardholder accounts must be established to
   segregate these fund types. All cardholders and/or approving officials must contact their local
   comptroller and/or legal office if any doubt exists regarding the proper use of appropriated
   funds.
   2.1.2. The GPC may be used to purchase authorized supplies, equipment, and non-personal
   services up to the micro-purchase threshold (currently $2,500). See paragraph 2.2.10
   regarding use of the GPC for construction. Purchases under $2,500 are exempt from the
   Competition in Contracting Act, Buy American Act, Economy Act, Service Contract Act,
   and the Small Business Set-Aside Program. Non-personal services are further divided into
   recurring and non-recurring services. Recurring services are those performed at regular
   intervals and have a demand that can be accurately predicted on an annual basis. Recurring
   services requirements estimated to exceed $2,500 per fiscal year shall be acquired through
   the local contracting office. Non-recurring services involve one-time, unpredictable, or
   occasional requirements. These ad-hoc services may be purchased with the GPC up to the
   micro-purchase threshold whenever a requirement occurs. If any doubt exists as to which
   category a service falls under, the cardholder shall consult with the local contracting office
   for a determination.
      2.1.2.1. Warranted contracting officers may specify the GPC as a method of payment on
      contractual documents and agreements (i.e., Educational Service Agreements,
      Cooperative Agreements) up to the warrant limit of the Contracting Officer (See FAR
      13.301). Contracting personnel must comply with the requirements of this instruction for
      establishing, funding, reconciling, and approving GPC purchases and other transactions
      even when the GPC is used as a payment method on a contractual document. Purchases
      greater than the micro-purchase threshold must comply with all pertinent and required
      procurement and financial management rules, policies, and laws associated with the
      dollar value of the purchase. In addition, as a minimum, the following requirements must
      be met when the GPC is used as a payment method:
          2.1.2.1.1. The requirement must be loaded in the DoD Standard Procurement System
          (SPS).
          2.1.2.1.2. The Contracting Officer must ensure sufficient funds have been committed
          and reserved to support the contract action.
          2.1.2.1.3. There must be a distinct separation of duties for purchase, acceptance, and
          payment for the contract action. No one individual may perform more than one of
          these functions without the review and written approval of their immediate supervisor
          or above.
 8                                                      AFI64-117_482FWSUP_I 21 JUNE 2011


           2.1.2.1.4. The contract document must state that payment will be made by GPC and
           require authorization from the Contracting Officer to bill against the designated GPC
           account. The GPC account number shall not be included in the contract document.
           2.1.2.1.5. The Contracting Officer, in consultation with the local comptroller office,
           must comply with the provisions of the Prompt Payment Act, if applicable.
           2.1.2.1.6. On a limited basis, at the discretion of the Contracting Officer and subject
           to the restrictions in 3.6, convenience checks may also be used as a payment method
           provided the amount of each invoice does not exceed $2,500 and invoices are not
           split to avoid this limitation. For service contracts, the total monthly amount of the
           contract shall not exceed $2,500.

NOTE: each check is subject to the Bank surcharge paid directly out of the unit’s account
(currently 1.7% CONUS, 2% OCONUS).
       2.1.2.2. GPC micro-purchases should be distributed equitably among qualified suppliers,
       in accordance with FAR 13.202(a)(1), with special consideration paid to supporting local,
       small, and small disadvantaged businesses.
       2.1.2.3. If specifically authorized to make purchases above $2,500, cardholders not in
       contracting organizations may use the GPC only to obtain items from pre-priced
       government contracts and agreements (e.g., Federal Supply Schedule (FSS), Blanket
       Purchase Agreements (BPA), Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity ID/IQ contracts
       etc.), except as specified in 2.1.2.4, 2.1.2.5, 2.5.1, and 2.11.1. In this case, authority to use
       the GPC will not exceed $25,000 per transaction. When purchasing from FSSs and BPAs,
       cardholders must review prices on at least three contracts/agreements unless it is a
       competitively awarded BPA and select the best value item for their requirements. A
       record of this review will be kept with the cardholder’s GPC documentation. In addition,
       for each transaction greater than $2,500 the cardholder must collect required information
       from the vendor. This data must be submitted to the A/OPC, in a format specified by the

   cardholder will contact the resource advisor or contracting squadron/office to verify that the
   repair is not already covered by an existing preventative maintenance agreement. The name
   of the person contacted shall be documented by the cardholder. In addition, consult the
   organization equipment custodian to ascertain whether repair may be covered under an
   existing warranty at no cost to the Air Force.
      2.3.2.1. Modifications of equipment listed in Technical Order 00-110N-16, Equipment
      Authorized for Nuclear Weapons, must be coordinated with the Base/Center Weapons
      Safety Office and Chief Vehicle Maintenance (for motor vehicles/powered aerospace

2.4. Unauthorized Use of the GPC. The GPC shall not be used (unless otherwise noted in
exceptions) for the following purposes:
   2.4.1. Cash Advances. Cash advances are prohibited. Money orders, traveler checks, gift
   certificates, and ―middleman‖ payment services are considered to be cash advances and shall
   not be purchased by cardholders to obtain items from merchants who do not accept the GPC.
   (See paragraph 3.6, Convenience Check Accounts.)

   lodging and meals are a host unit expense, costs may be paid with host unit GPC. Note:
   Subsistence items (not prepared meals) not associated with individual travel may be
   purchased with the GPC from the commissary or commercial sources. Before going to a
   commercial source it must be determined that troop issue (Prime Vendor) and the
   commissary cannot support the requirement. Prepared meals for dignitaries may only be
   purchased with Official Representational Funds (ORF). For purchases of prepared meals, the
   GPC can be used if a written determination is approved by the approving official that the
   official Government travel card cannot be used to satisfy the requirement. The original is to
   be retained in the cardholder’s file and a copy of the determination shall be forwarded to the
   A/OPC.
   2.4.3. Rentals or Leases of Land or Buildings Exceeding 30 days. Exception: Rental of
   temporary storage to facilitate office reconfiguration not to exceed 90 days provided the total
   price of rental does not exceed $2,500 and the rental period does not cross a fiscal year and

   the base either in an off-site location (e.g., Air Force recruiting office) or located in a remote
   portion of the base (often non-contiguous) so as to not be part of the base infrastructure (e.g.,
   a building or an annex to the base which is connected to another municipality’s water
   supply). The GPC may be used to purchase utility services provided the dollar amount of
   each utility does not exceed $2,500 per year. (2) In locations where there is no base-wide
   service contract, individuals may pay their own cell phone bills using the GPC if the annual
   bill does not exceed $2,500 and cardholders don’t enter into agreements with cell phone
   companies that obligate the Government to pay cancellation fees if the service is
   discontinued.
   2.4.15. Purchase requiring advance payments, except for subscriptions or training purchased
   on a DD Form 1556, Request, Authorization, Agreement, Certification of Training and
   Reimbursement.
   2.4.16. Purchases from Government employees.

   comply with any and all MAJCOM and/or locally mandated restrictions.
   2.4.18. See AFI 65-601, Vol 1 and AFI 65-301 for more detailed guidance on authorized and
   unauthorized uses of appropriated funds. If in doubt, contact the local comptroller
   squadron/office.
2.5. Use of Government-wide Purchase Card by OCONUS Units
 14                                                AFI64-117_482FWSUP_I 21 JUNE 2011


   2.5.1. Overseas cardholders may be authorized to use the GPC to make commercial
   purchases up to $25,000 if the purchase is made outside the United States from vendors
   located outside the United States for use outside the United States, subject to the
   requirements specified in DFARS 213.301. If purchases are made from CONUS vendors for
   use overseas, the micro-purchase threshold of $2,500 remains in effect. For stateside
   purchases the cardholder must contact their local Traffic Management Flight for assistance
   regarding transportation and packaging requirements and/or instructions prior to contacting
   the vendor. Cardholders must ensure the final price includes all costs associated with the
   mode of transportation and packaging selected to the destination country, customs import
   duties, and any other charges that may accrue. Consult DoD 4500.54-G, Foreign Clearance
   Guide, prior to the requisitioning action to ensure compliance with host nation customs
   requirements.
2.6. Use of the GPC in Support of Contingency/Exercise Operations.
   2.6.1. Warranted Contingency Contracting Officers (CCOs) are authorized to use the GPC in
   support of contingency/exercise operations. Homestation GPCs may be issued to CCOs in
   advance to support planning for military operations or local emergencies IAW AFFARS
   Appendix CC. The commander/chief of the contracting office will balance contingency
   planning requirements with management control considerations when determining how many
   GPC holders are required in advance of deployment tasking. The approving official in each
   case will be the contracting squadron commander/chief of the contracting office or his/her
   designated representative. When tasked to deploy, the CCO will be issued a GPC by their
   homestation for use during the deployment unless exempted by the supported command.
   When functional control of the deployed CCO shifts to another HCA, homestation-issued
   GPCs may continue to be used unless prohibited by either the homestation or the gaining
   command. GPCs may be issued to the CCO under the authority and direction of the
   supported command's HCA. In all cases the CCO will follow the guidance provided by the
   GPC-issuing office. When individuals participating in the operation or exercise are in
   temporary duty (TDY) status, they must document why they used the GPC in lieu of their
   Government travel card to pay for commercial lodging facility and meals.
   2.6.2. Cardholders who are not CCOs may continue to use unit-funded GPCs when deployed
   for a short duration (typically less than 30 days) exercise or contingency not-to-exceed
   $2,500 per transaction. The approving official in this situation will not change. An example
   of this type of situation is a Red Horse organization deploying for a two-week period and
   then returning to their home station. Medical Dental Division (MDD) funded cards for which
   purchases will be reissued through an Air Force standard medical logistics automated
   information system may be used regardless of the duration of the deployment or exercise. In
   all cases, the cardholders and approving officials must ensure there are no delays in review
   and reconciliation of purchases made while the cardholder is deployed. In some cases, rules
   of engagement within the theater of operations may dictate that only warranted CCOs use the
   GPC.
   2.6.3. Except for purchases of HAZMAT (2.2.1) and weapons systems parts (2.2.9), the
   authorizations and coordinations delineated in paragraphs 2.2and 2.3, are not required for
   purchases made in support of contingency/exercise operations if the cardholder is not
   collocated with the authorizing official or coordinating office.
AFI64-117_482FWSUP_I 21 JUNE 2011                                                               15


   2.6.4. Warranted CCOs may use the GPC as a payment method up to the limit of their
   warrant to cover written orders. In addition, in support of a Joint Chiefs of Staff-declared
   contingency operation, CCOs may make open market purchases up to $200,000, provided the
   purchase is made outside the United States, from a vendor located outside the United States,
   for use outside the United States and the GPC is used in the same manner as a Standard Form
   44 Purchase Order-Invoice-Voucher (See DFARS 52-213.301).
   2.6.5. If Internet capability is available at the deployed location, the cardholder will
   reconcile all transactions via the Bank’s electronic access system using normal procedures. If
   not, the cardholder will coordinate with the approving official and the approving official will
   reconcile all transactions on behalf of the cardholder.
   2.6.6. When initiating cardholder set-up for a CCO who is not scheduled to deploy
   immediately, single purchase and monthly spending limits should be set at a low level. At the
   time the CCO is deployed, the limits can be raised on the spot by the A/OPC via the Bank’s
   electronic access system. The limits should be set realistically based on the expected
   purchase volume for that account. Upon the return of the CCO to his or her home base, the
   spending limits should be lowered to the previous level.
   2.6.7. Air and Space Expeditionary Force (AEF) Deployments. All AEF eligible, military
   contracting personnel shall receive GPC training from their local contracting office. A copy
   of the training record shall be maintained in their unit deployment folder. Upon selection for
   an AEF tasking, designated CCOs will be notified, through their Personnel Readiness Unit,
   regarding unique GPC requirements, if any, for the operation or exercise they are tasked to
   support. In some cases, the CCO may be issued a GPC specific to the operation or exercise.
2.7. Authorized Use of the GPC by Geographically Separated Units (GSU): GSUs located
more than 50 miles from their base of support are exempt from the coordination requirements in
paragraph 2.2 except for purchases of HAZMAT (2.2.1) and weapons systems parts (2.2.9).
2.8. Authorized Use of the GPC by Tenant Organizations: The A/OPC will initiate GPC
accounts for all tenants when the tenant’s funds are maintained by the installation’s FSO. In
cases where the tenant’s funds are maintained by the cardholder’s home station, the home station
A/OPC shall initiate the accounts. In this case, upon request, the A/OPC shall provide GPC
training and provide courtesy surveillance audits for the home station. Copies of these audits will
be forwarded to the home station for action as appropriate. The accounting and paying station
must be the same.
2.9. Government Contractors: Government contractor employees shall not be issued GPCs
nor shall they be appointed as approving officials.
2.10. Use of GPC for Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Guideline Items: The
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and Solid Waste Disposal Act require agencies to use
recovered materials for EPA-designated items to the maximum extent practicable without
jeopardizing the intended use of the item.
   2.10.1. A list of EPA Guideline Items should be requested from the Environmental
   Management Section at the Base Civil Engineer Squadron. At this time, items include paper
   and paper products, vehicular products, construction and transportation products, park and
   recreation products, landscaping products, and non-paper office products.

   2.10.2. Acquisition of EPA-designated items that do not meet the EPA minimum recovered
   material standards must be justified in writing if over the micro-purchase threshold.
   Compliance with the Affirmative Procurement Executive Order 13101 is required at all
   dollar levels. A written determination based upon one of the following reasons must be
   maintained by the cardholder organization for any orders above $2,500 (or $2,000 for
   construction). Each written determination must cite one or more of the following reasons for
   exemption from recovered material standards:
      2.10.2.1. Items containing EPA-recommended recovered content standards are not
      available within a reasonable period of time.
      2.10.2.2. Items are only available at an unreasonable price. Include sufficient
      information to support price decision.
      2.10.2.3. Items are not available from a sufficient number of sources to maintain a
      satisfactory level of competition. Include list of sources queried.
      2.10.2.4. Items based upon technical verification fail to meet performance standards or
      specifications.
   2.10.3. When conditions apply for repetitive purchases of the same item, an annual blanket
   determination, approved by the unit commander/director may be maintained by the
   cardholder’s organization.
   2.10.4. Per the National Defense Authorization Act of 1998, as of January 1, 2004, paper
   purchased using the GPC must be 50% post-consumer recycled paper. If 50% post-consumer
   recycled paper is not available for purchase, then as an alternative to meeting the standards
   for all printing and writing papers, the minimum content standard shall be no less than 50%
   recovered materials.
2.11. Use of the GPC for Training and Education
   2.11.1. The GPC shall be used by training and education office personnel to pay for
   government, non-government and/or off-the-shelf training and education up to $25,000 for
   an individual or planned series of the same training event, activity, or course material.
   2.11.2. Organizations may pay for government, non-government and/or off-the-shelf training
   and education with their unit funds up to $25,000; however, the following procedures must
   be completed prior to attending training. In accordance with DoD Financial Regulation,
   Volume 10, DoD Administrative Instruction Number 40 and AFI 36-401, a DD Form 1556
   must be submitted to the training and education office and approval obtained before an
   individual may attend training. The approval process requires coordination/concurrence from
   an individual’s supervisor, second-level supervisor, the organization’s training coordinator,
   and submittal to the training and education office for review and approval prior to the
   training start date. At locations without integrated training office, DD Form 1556s must be
   approved by the military training office/flight or civilian training office/flight. The employee
   development manager will ensure requested training is in compliance with all statutory, legal,
   and administrative requirements. The cardholder must have an approved DD Form 1556
   prior to contacting a vendor.
   2.11.3. Off-the-shelf training is defined as training products and services regularly available
   to the general public and/or Government personnel. The term includes training offered in
AFI64-117_482FWSUP_I 21 JUNE 2011                                                                17


   catalogs or other printed material by a college, university, professional association,
   consultant firm or organization. It does not include training specifically developed, designed,
   and produced to meet requirements unique to an organization and/or program. An AF Form
   9, Request for Purchase, submitted to the Contracting Squadron/Office, is required to
   purchase training designed specifically to meet a requirement particular to an organization.
   2.11.4. Non-government sources include, but are not limited to:
       2.11.4.1. State government or instrumentality
       2.11.4.2. Interstate government organization
       2.11.4.3. Medical, scientific, technical, educational, research, or professional institution,
       foundation, or organization
       2.11.4.4. Universities, technical, business, and vocational schools, business, commercial,
       or industrial firm, corporation, partnership, proprietorship, or other organization.
   2.11.5. Training and education cards will be established with a single purchase limit of
   $25,000. All merchant category codes (MCCs) will be blocked except the following source
   of training:
              7392 - Management, Consulting and Public Relations Services
              7399 - Business Services (Not Elsewhere Classified)
              8220 - Colleges, universities, junior colleges, and other professional schools

              8244 - All business/secondary schools
              8249 - Vocational/trade schools
              8299 - Schools and Education Services (Not Elsewhere Classified)
2.12. Use of the GPC for Voluntary Military Tuition Assistance. The GPC shall be used for
the payment of military tuition assistance invoices that do not exceed a consolidated total of
$5,000,000 per invoice from a single institution.
   2.12.1. The education services flight chief (ESFC) or designee will establish fund controls
   and initiate an AF Form 4009, for each account required. Military tuition assistance funds are
   requested by the student using an AF Form 1227, Authority for Tuition Assistance -
   Education Services Program. The AF Form 1227 must be used as an approval document,
   which equates to a commitment, but not as an obligation document.
   2.12.2. The education service flight (ESF) will receive school invoices after each add/drop
   period for the applicable school term. The ESF chief, or designee, will reconcile each invoice
   to ensure it is accurate and complete. Discrepancies will be questioned and corrected with the
   school prior to payment of any invoice. A record of each transaction will be maintained with
   each invoice. Each record of transaction must include a statement certifying the accuracy and
   receipt of services. Once reconciled, the ESF chief, or designee, will provide the GPC
   account number to the school along with a copy of the reconciled invoice. Each ESF
   cardholder will reconcile all transactions in the Bank’s electronic access system. The

   approving official will validate and approve cardholder transactions in the Bank’s electronic
   access system.
2.13. Accountability of Property.
   2.13.1. For equipment items equal to or under the micro-purchase threshold, accountability
   is the responsibility of unit commander. At least monthly, unit commanders must take action
   to ensure items purchased using the GPC and requiring accountability, are accounted for in
   the appropriate property book (Air Force Equipment Management System
   (AFEMS)/Standard Base Supply System (SBSS), Information Technology Asset
   Management (ITAMS)) Unit commanders must establish a locally devised program that
   provides visibility and audit trail capability. This may include use of hand receipts and
   spreadsheets. These records shall include all items considered pilferable or easily resalable
   on the open market. Examples of such items include cell phones, digital cameras, fax
   machines, palm pilots copiers and printers. See Department of Defense Instruction 5000.64
   and AFI 23-111, “Management of Government Property in the Possession of the Air Force,‖
   for policy on accountability and/or responsible officer responsibility. For accountability
   requirements for equipment items valued in excess of the micro-purchase procedures see
   2.3.1 and AFMAN 23-110, ― USAF Supply Manual‖ Vol 2.
   2.13.2. Computer equipment and software must be accounted for in accordance with AFI 33-
   101, Communications and Information Management Guidance and Responsibilities.
AFI64-117_482FWSUP_I 21 JUNE 2011                                                               19

                             ESTABLISHING A GPC ACCOUNT

3.1. Letter of Appointment. Commanders or chiefs of the requiring activities shall prepare a
letter of appointment designating cardholders and approving officials. A primary and alternate
approving official must be appointed for each approving official account. The A/OPC shall
reduce the credit line of alternate cardholder to one dollar when primary cardholders and
approving officials are available and are actively using their accounts. The letter of appointment
is processed by the A/OPC. The letter of appointment must fully describe the types of purchases
to be made and identify the name, rank, duty title, and telephone number of the cardholder and
approving official. The letter must also include the requested limits as specified in paragraph 3.2
below. Coordination with the servicing FSO is mandatory to ensure that the proper funds are
allocated for the GPC charges. For new approving official accounts, the approving official must
also initiate a request for a funding document, AF Form 4009, from the servicing FSO.
Subsequent changes to approving official limits must be submitted to the A/OPC, in writing (e-
mail acceptable), by the authorizing official. Subsequent changes to cardholder limits must be
submitted to the A/OPC, in writing (e-mail acceptable), by the approving official.
   3.1.1. When appointing approving officials and cardholders, the appointing authority should
   take into account the current responsibilities of the approving official and ensure the number
   of cardholders assigned to any one approving official allows sufficient time for them to
   adequately monitor their cardholders’ purchase activity. The required ratio of total
   cardholders to approving official shall be no more than seven to one. Requests for a waiver to
   this requirement must be approved by the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Contracting
   (SAF/AQC). At a minimum, the waiver request must include the account number, the name
   and location of the approving official, the number of cardholders the approving official is
   responsible for, the average monthly transaction volume the approving official experiences,
   and the rationale for the waiver request, including specifics on how the approving official is
   able to maintain appropriate oversight. The approved waiver request must be maintained on
   file for approving officials that have more than seven cardholders assigned. Accounts
   exceeding the 7:1 ratio must be reviewed annually by the A/OPC to verify that adequate
   controls are in place. The result of this surveillance shall be provided to the MAJCOM/
   FOA/DRU GPC Program Manager for review and approval prior to submittal to SAF/AQC.
   This waiver is only valid for the Approving Official named in the waiver.
3.2. Limits. Use of the GPC is subject to a single purchase limit, a monthly cardholder limit, an
approving official 30-day limit (which encompasses all of the cardholders’ 30-day limits
assigned for any billing cycle) and a funding document limit. All limits must be realistic and
based on actual spending patterns and funding. In the event spending limits are inflated, they
should be reduced by the A/OPC. The A/OPC initiates the GPC account via the Bank’s
automated access system subject to the limits requested by the cardholder’s organization.
   3.2.1. Single Purchase Limit. The single purchase limit on the card cannot exceed $2,500
   unless the cardholder is a Warranted Contracting Officer, has specific authority to place
   orders from pre-priced contractual instruments up to $25,000 or is authorized to make
   transactions as specified in 2.1.2.4, 2.1.2.5, 2.5.1, 2.11.1 and 2.12.
 20                                                 AFI64-117_482FWSUP_I 21 JUNE 2011


   3.2.2. Monthly Cardholder Limit. The monthly cardholder limit is the total dollar value of
   the cardholder’s GPC purchases allowed for any given monthly billing cycle. The monthly
   cardholder limit shall be set in increments of $100.
   3.2.3. Funding Document Limit. The funding document limit is a budgetary limit established
   on the Air Force Government Purchase Card Fund Cite Authorization Form, AF Form 4009,
   by the approving official in coordination with and certified by the FSO. In all instances, the
   approving official shall obtain a certified funding document before the card can be used by
   the cardholder. For Contingency/Exercise Operations accounts see paragraph 2.6. NOTE:
   Overspending funds available on the AF Form 4009 will result in unit commander
   notification and may result in suspension of the cardholder’s and/or approving official’s GPC
   privileges and/or other disciplinary action. FSOs shall set quarterly spending limits on the
   approving official account at the same dollar value as the AF Form 4009. Refer to paragraph
   4.3.6 for more information on funding procedures.
3.3. Merchant Activity Type (MAT) Codes. When initiating a GPC account, the A/OPC shall
incorporate the MAT codes that are identified in the requiring organization’s request.
Cardholders will not be permanently assigned the unrestricted MAT Code ―000‖ unless
specifically approved, in writing or by an electronic authentication process, by the contracting
squadron commander/chief of contracting office. However, warranted contingency contracting
officer cards will be assigned the MAT Code ―000‖ in order to support the contingency/exercise
to which they are temporarily assigned. Subsequent changes to the MAT code may be requested
from the A/OPC by the approving official (e-mail acceptable).
3.4. Account Set-Up.
   3.4.1. Account set up begins upon receipt of the letter of appointment specified in paragraph
   3.1 at the contracting squadron/office and an initiation of an AF Form 4009 at the
   comptroller squadron/ office. The A/OPC will use the letter of appointment as the basis to
   initiate cardholder and/or approving official account set up via the Bank’s automated access
   system. The A/OPC will also make any subsequent adjustments, to include account
   suspension and closure, via this system. Upon completion of formal training and receipt of
   confirmation that the account set up is completed (including establishment of a certified
   funding document), a delegation of authority letter, signed by the contracting squadron
   commander/chief of the contracting office, shall be forwarded to the cardholder. This letter
   delegates the authority to the cardholder to use the GPC to obtain supplies, equipment, and
   services with the GPC, subject to the limits identified in the letter.
3.5. Receipt of Card. The Bank will mail the GPC to the cardholder within 24 hours after
receiving the cardholder’s account set-up information. The Bank uses a Voice Response Unit
(VRU) to verify that the GPC has been received by the cardholder. When the cardholder receives
the GPC, he/she must immediately access the VRU to activate their card. The VRU is accessible
toll free (or via direct telephone number for foreign users).
3.6. Convenience Check Accounts. Convenience checks provide an alternative only when the
use of the GPC is not feasible. The use of convenience checks shall be evaluated and determined
to be advantageous to the activity, after evaluating all alternatives to accomplish the same
purpose. The checks provide Air Force activities the flexibility to issue low volume, low dollar
payments for supplies and services. The management controls, procedures, and restrictions
included in this AFI also apply to the use of convenience checks. The convenience checks will
AFI64-117_482FWSUP_I 21 JUNE 2011                                                             21


be pre-numbered and additional controls will be maintained by the check writer using a separate
convenience check register for each account. The funding document for establishment of
convenience check accounts is also the AF Form 4009. A convenience check writer may also
have a GPC account and a separate convenience checking account. The convenience check
cardholder number must be unique and cannot be used jointly with an existing GPC cardholder
account number.
   3.6.1. Requirements: As specified in the DoD Financial Management Regulation, Volume 5,
   Chapter 2, the following requirements must be met when administering a convenience check
   account:
       3.6.1.1. All organizations authorized to maintain a convenience checking account shall
       hold an active (in good standing) GPC managing account before approval of a purchase
       card convenience checking account.
       3.6.1.2. Before a check is issued, the requiring organization must make every effort to
       use the GPC. Maximum efforts shall be made to find and use vendors that accept the
       GPC.
       3.6.1.3. The authority to maintain a checking account shall be justified on an individual
       organization basis and controlled and monitored by the organization commander.
       3.6.1.4. The number of checkbooks per installation must be kept to a minimum and
       should, in most cases, be limited to no more than one checkbook per organization. Unit
       commanders shall provide a written justification to establish an additional checking
       account. The contracting squadron commander/chief of the contracting office is the
       approval authority for additional checking accounts.
       3.6.1.5. The approving official is responsible for the implementation of appropriate
       internal controls. Quarterly reviews of each checking account must be conducted by the
       approving official as a part of the regular surveillance activities. The A/OPC will review
       each checking account under an approving official as a part of the annual surveillance of
       accounts.
       3.6.1.6. Convenience checks shall not be issued for more than $2,500 per check and shall
       be issued for the exact payment amount. "Splitting" amounts across more than one check
       to keep below the $2,500 limit is prohibited. The A/OPC shall suspend the account
       immediately for any assigned check writer who issues a check(s) exceeding the $2,500
       limit. The A/OPC will notify the AO to pull the checkbook from the check writer.
       Surveillance will be conducted on the account by the A/OPC. Any violations of GPC
       procedures, including checking accounts will be documented by the A/OPC. If there is a
       compelling need for the account to remain open, the Appointing Authority may request
       the account be reopened if there is a compelling need for the account and another check
       writer cannot be appointed. Justifications, including disciplinary actions and procedures
       implemented to prevent recurrence to include the results of the account surveillance by
       the A/OPC and the dates that refresher training was taken, shall be submitted to the
       CONS/CC and be forwarded to the Level 3 reporting agent. Level 3 reporting agent must
       concur with the reinstatement prior to submittal to the Level 2 reporting agent. Note: The
       DoD Purchase Card Program Management Office is the final decision authority for these
       requests.

     3.6.1.7. Convenience checks shall not be issued as an ―exchange-for-cash‖ vehicle to
     establish cash funds. If vendors issue credit checks or refunds by cash or check, funds
     must immediately be turned in to the local FSO.
     3.6.1.8. The unit is responsible for all administrative costs associated with the use of
     these checks. The total purchase amount plus the program fee must be accounted for on
     the check writers check register and deducted from the funding document balance.
     Likewise, all checks must be input into the Bank’s electronic access system in the same
     manner as a GPC transaction. (The current program fee for convenience checks is 1.7%
     of the face value of the check.)
     3.6.1.9. Convenience checks may be mailed, provided internal controls are in place to
     avoid duplicate payments to payee. Lost checks are the responsibility of the check writer
     (see DoD 7000.14-R, Vol 5).
     3.6.1.10. Convenience checks may be used for overseas transactions up to $2,500.
     Convenience checks may only be written in U. S. dollars. Warranted contingency
     contracting officers may use the convenience check up to $10,000 for overseas
     transactions in support of contingencies declared by the Secretary of Defense.
     3.6.1.11. Check writers are responsible for the capture of TD Form 1099 MISC,
     Statement for Recipients of Miscellaneous Income, data for services paid by
     convenience check. Also report the services portion of checks written for a combination
     of supplies and services. (See DFARS 204.904)
     ―NOTE: All checks must be captured and reported because payments from several
     installations/agencies may total over $600 which is the IRS reporting level for TD 1099
     data.‖ The information shall be reported to DFAS in accordance with instructions issued
     by DFAS (see https://dfas4dod.dfas.mil/systems/1099). The required information
     consists of the following:
        3.6.1.11.1. Payee’s full name
        3.6.1.11.2. Complete mailing address
        3.6.1.11.3. Phone number (including area code)
        3.6.1.11.4. Social Security Number or Tax Identification Number
        3.6.1.11.5. Check number and amount(s) paid
        3.6.1.11.6. Date(s)
        3.6.1.11.7. Total paid to Payee in the reporting period
        3.6.1.11.8. Authorized convenience check writers and A/OPCs must register in the
        DFAS 1099 Tax Reporting Program.
     3.6.1.12. Checks are negotiable instruments and must be stored in a locked container,
     such as a safe or metal filing cabinet. Checks must be accounted for appropriately to
     prevent loss, theft, or potential forgery. Checks must be reconciled in the same manner as
     GPC transactions. Checks are printed on duplicate paper to facilitate tracking and
     reconciliation. Duplicate copies of checks must be retained as a part of the account
     holders’ original documentation files.
AFI64-117_482FWSUP_I 21 JUNE 2011                                                            23


     3.6.1.13. The A/OPCs shall cancel the convenience check privileges of cardholders who
     misuse convenience checks more than once. Refresher training is required for any
     cardholder who exceeds the $2500.00 check limit.
  3.6.2. Authorization of Accounts.
     3.6.2.1. Approving official responsibilities for check accounts are the same as those for
     the GPC (see paragraph 4.3.4).
     3.6.2.2. Only the named person shall be designated as the convenience check writer and
     have the authority to sign and issue convenience checks. Check accounts shall be under
     the custody of an individual who is not responsible for the origination, approval and/or
     processing of the requirement for a check.
  3.6.3. Establishing Convenience Check Accounts.
     3.6.3.1. Requests to establish convenience check accounts shall be justified by the
     organization’s commander/director and forwarded to the A/OPC. A separate letter of
     appointment to maintain and use convenience checks shall be provided to the activity
     approving official and check writer (by name) by the activity’s commander/director.
  3.6.4. Use of Convenience Check Accounts. Convenience check purchases are subject to the
  same requirements and restrictions as the GPC and shall not be used for any purpose where
  purchase using appropriated funds is not otherwise authorized. In addition, supplies or
  services purchased with the convenience check must be available for delivery within 15 days
  at the contractor’s place of business or at destination.
  3.6.5. Disputes/Stop Payments.
     3.6.5.1. The disputes process available with the GPC is not available with convenience
     checks. Any concerns over a purchase made with a check must be resolved directly with
     the merchant. The check writer is solely responsible for securing restitution and/or credit
     for disputed purchases. The check writer shall request A/OPC assistance to resolve
     disputes in the event, he/she is unable to resolve disputes with the merchant. Each
     organization is responsible for checks written on the account, unless it is determined
     fraud is involved.
     3.6.5.2. In some cases, payment can be stopped on a convenience check that has been
     written if the check has not yet posted to an account. To stop payment on a check, call the
     Bank Customer Service to receive instructions on processing the action. The stop
     payment action will be in place for six months, and a fee will be charged (and accounted
     for on purchase log/funding document balance) directly to the account. If the check has
     already posted to the account, a request to stop payment cannot be honored.
     3.6.5.3. Copies of posted checks are retained on file at the Bank for three and one half
     years. If a check copy is needed, it will be mailed within 14 calendar days of request. A
     fee will be charged (and must be accounted for on the purchase log/funding document
     balance) directly to the requesting account.
     3.6.5.4. Although a check is written, it may not immediately post, and therefore, may not
     be reflected in that month’s statement of account of the check writer. When a check is
     presented to the Bank for payment, there must be enough funds in the 30-day limit and
     office limit to cover the check. In addition, a check cannot exceed the single purchase
 24                                                 AFI64-117_482FWSUP_I 21 JUNE 2011


       limit assigned to the account. If a check presented exceeds any of the limits, the result
       may be a Non-Sufficient Funds (NSF) situation and the check may be returned unpaid to
       the merchant or payee. A NSF fee will be assigned against the check writer’s account.
3.7. Foreign Drafts Accounts. Foreign Draft (FD) accounts provide an alternative only when
the use of the GPC or Convenience Check is not feasible. Foreign Drafts provide organizations
the flexibility to issue low volume, low foreign currency payments for supplies and services. If
an organization requires the Foreign Drafts they must coordinate approval through the A/OPC.
All Foreign Drafts issued will post against a specific cardholder account. Only approved FD
―check‖ writers with a valid FD Product User ID and Password have the authority to create, print
and issue a check. The management controls procedures and restrictions included in this AFI for
convenience checks also apply to Foreign Drafts. A 2% fee is charged on Foreign Drafts.

       4.3.2.1. Contracting squadron commanders/Director, Business Operations/chiefs of
       contracting offices must issue written authority to cardholders not in contracting
       organizations to make purchases or place orders. This authority may not be delegated.
       However, in the absence of the CONS/CC, authority may be granted by the Deputy.
       Warranted contracting officers do not require a separate delegation of authority to use the
       GPC. A sample delegation of authority letter is available on the SAF/ AQC Homepage
       (http://www.safaq.hq.af.mil/contracting/). The following thresholds for single purchase
       limits apply:
           4.3.2.1.1. Personnel not assigned to a contracting office shall not be delegated
           authority to use the GPC to make single purchases for commercially available

            officials trained at a previous duty station may be abbreviated or waived, in
            writing, as determined by the A/OPC. In addition to the minimum required
            training, the A/OPC is responsible for providing mandatory refresher training to
            all cardholders and approving officials on an annual basis. This ―continuing
            education‖ requirement can be satisfied by holding a classroom session, providing
            periodic newsletters, accessing web-based training or other suitable vehicles. The
            A/OPC should document these sessions and, when practicable, compile and retain

        instruments and the additional requirements associated with using them.
     4.3.3.4. Violation of Air Force GPC procedures. If, as a result of findings from a
     surveillance visit, or by any other means, the A/OPC discovers a cardholder or approving
     official has violated GPC procedures, the A/OPC shall document the violation and take
     action to resolve the noncompliance to include, if necessary, retraining of the cardholder
     or approving official and/or temporarily suspending the cardholder or approving official’s
     GPC privileges. Any determinations to cancel or permanently suspend a cardholder or
     approving official account shall be made by the contracting squadron commander/chief
     of the contracting office, in writing, and their findings forwarded to the cardholder’s
     and/or approving official’s unit commander. Continual violation of GPC procedures by
     an individual cardholder or approving officials shall result in termination of GPC
     privileges. A/OPCs shall verify that all potentially fraudulent and erroneous transactions
     that have been identified are disputed and properly resolved.
        4.3.3.4.1. Evidence of deliberate abuse shall be referred to the cardholder’s and/or
        approving official’s unit commander by the contracting squadron commander/chief of
        the contracting office for appropriate action in accordance with the Uniform Code of
        Military Justice or civilian disciplinary rules.
        4.3.3.4.2. Evidence of fraud or other criminal activity shall be referred, by the
        contracting squadron commander/chief of the contracting office, to the local
        detachment of the Air Force Office of Special Investigation.
        4.3.3.4.3. The violation and action taken shall be documented in the A/OPC’s files.
     4.3.3.5. Card Reissue: The Bank will reissue the GPC every 36 months to each active

        official at least every 12 months (not once per fiscal year). In addition, a random
AFI64-117_482FWSUP_I 21 JUNE 2011                                                               29


        sample of 25% of cardholders assigned to the approving official shall be reviewed
        yearly as part of the approving account review. Approving officials shall perform
        surveillance reviews of 100% of their cardholder accounts at least every 12 months
        (not once per fiscal year). Convenience check account shall be reviewed by the
        approving official every quarter. Newly appointed cardholders should be actively
        reviewed by the approving official during the first three months to ensure they are
        effectively performing their duties and following all procedures. Results of
        surveillance reviews, including corrective/disciplinary action taken shall be
        documented and retained on file.
        4.3.3.6.2. In order to standardize the evaluation of the purchase card program results,
        use of the Surveillance Checklist, including both ―Review of Approving Official
        Accounts‖ and ―Review of Cardholder/Checkwriter Accounts‖, is mandatory. The
        Surveillance Checklist is available on the SAF/AQC Homepage,
        (http://www.safaq.hq.af.mil/contracting/). This checklist can be supplemented at
        command or local levels. In addition, A/OPCs are encouraged to use the management
        and report capabilities available via the Bank’s electronic access system to monitor
        card usage at their installation. A/OPCs should use reports from the Bank’s electronic
        access system to conduct periodic reviews for potential split purchase transactions,
        particularly at the end of the fiscal year.
        4.3.3.6.3. Reports on surveillance results shall include an assessment of program
        control including, at a minimum, the ratio of cardholders to employees (this is an
        installation level statistic), ratio of approving officials to cardholder, ratio of monthly
        credit limits to actual spending on cardholder accounts, and number of cardholders
        and approving officials requiring refresher training. Reserve bases may count
        weekend reservists in their employee count for their bases. Surveillance results shall
        be maintained on file in the A/OPC office. Copies of surveillance results shall be
        provided to the approving official’s organizational commander, the approving
        official, and, if applicable, the cardholder. Purchase card program management and
        administrative records generated by installation program coordinators and approving
        officials, such as records of cardholder and approving official appointments and
        training, cardholder delegations of authority, and purchase card surveillances, shall be
        retained for 3 years.
        4.3.3.6.4. The A/OPC shall track and monitor corrective actions on purchase cards
        and annual surveillance findings and provide quarterly status reports to their
        installation Contracting Director/contracting squadron commander.
        4.3.3.6.5. Reports on the results of annual surveillance shall be signed by the
        installation Contracting Director/contracting squadron commander and shall be
        addressed to unit commanders.
        4.3.3.6.6. Reports on surveillance results shall include recommendations for unit
        commander action where approving officials and cardholders have failed to follow
        this instruction. The A/OPC will meet with the approving official to discuss each
        finding of noncompliance.
        4.3.3.6.7. Surveillance of GPC purchases made during all contingency/exercise
        operations will occur within 30 days following the conclusion of the
30                                                   AFI64-117_482FWSUP_I 21 JUNE 2011


         contingency/exercise deployment of the cardholder or the receipt of the final
         statement, whichever is later.
         4.3.3.6.8. If as a result of surveillance, or any other means, the A/OPC, approving
         official, or cardholder suspect a GPC account number has been compromised, the
         cardholder’s account shall immediately be cancelled and a new account established.
         Likewise, if a cardholder is approached by a vendor suggesting any type of illegal or
         unethical business arrangement, cardholder should immediately report this contact to
         the A/OPC. The A/OPC shall immediately notify the local OSI.
     4.3.3.7. Managing accounts that exceed their available funding will be set to $1. A
     written statement from the organizational commander stating that the funds have been
     made available and an outline of the procedures that have been implemented to ensure a
     shortage of funds will not occur again is required before the account is restored to its
     normal limits.
     4.3.3.8. Base Closure: Most GPC accounts should be closed before the base is closed.
     A/OPC shall contact the Bank and arrange for transfer of the paying function to a
     successor finance office and transfer of the program management responsibilities to an
     appropriate contracting office. The Air Force Base Closure Agency (AFBCA) should be
     contacted regarding program management for closing/closed installations. The A/OPC
     shall contact the MAJCOM Level 3 GPC Program Manager for appropriate Base Closure
     and AFBCA coordination instructions.
  4.3.4. Approving Official:
     4.3.4.1. The approving officials are responsible for oversight of all cardholders under
     their control, ensuring that internal controls are in place so that all cardholder transactions
     are for valid government requirements, are only made for valid appropriated fund
     expenditures and comply with the requirements of this AFI. Approving officials are
     designated as accountable officials as described in Attachment 2. The approving official
     should normally be in the same chain of command as the cardholder (e.g., unit or
     squadron) and the level of responsibility inherent in this position suggests that the grade
     of the approving official needs to be commensurate with that responsibility. A cardholder
     cannot be his/her own approving official nor can an approving official be a subordinate of
     a cardholder. An alternate approving official shall also be designated for each approving
     official account. The approving official has the authority to direct the A/OPC to take
     action to cancel the GPC for any of his/her cardholders at any time.
         4.3.4.1.1. Establishing Dollar Limits: The approving official is responsible for
         providing GPC dollar limits to the A/OPC for all of their cardholders and to ensure
         that established limits are not exceeded. The approving official is also responsible for
         ensuring spending limits are held to the minimum amount necessary to meet mission
         requirements.
         4.3.4.1.2. Each month the approving official accesses accounts to:
            4.3.4.1.2.1. Review each cardholder’s electronic statement of accounts.
            4.3.4.1.2.2. Verify that all transactions are appropriate, given the duties of the
            cardholder and mission of the unit, and those purchases were made in accordance
AFI64-117_482FWSUP_I 21 JUNE 2011                                                              31


           with this AFI and if so, approve the statement of accounts. Every effort should be
           made to accomplish this within 5 workdays after the end of the billing cycle, but
           not later than 15 calendar days after the end of the cycle. Approving official
           accounts which have not been reconciled and approved within 30 days of the end
           of a billing cycle shall be temporarily suspended (reduce credit limit to $1) by the
           A/OPC, pending approval. The approving official must provide a written
           statement explaining why the account was not reconciled and signed by their
           Commander on any accounts not approved within 30 days. This statement must
           be provided before the A/OPC removes the temporary suspension.
           4.3.4.1.2.3. Ensure that sufficient funding is available to pay the charge card
           statement in full each month. This must be verified before the cycle closes to
           facilitate the pay and confirm process.
           4.3.4.1.2.4. Ensure that spending limits in accounts are held to minimum amounts
           sufficient to meet mission needs.
        4.3.4.1.3. The approving official will maintain all original supporting documentation,
        in accordance with 4.3.5.4, for all accounts when the cardholder has transferred, been
        reassigned, or retired and the account is closed.
        4.3.4.1.4. Prior to 15 days after the end of the billing cycle, the approving official has
        the capability to log into the Bank’s electronic access system and act on behalf of the
        cardholder. This feature should be used if the cardholder is absent from his/her duty
        station and cannot log into the system from a remote location to reconcile their
        transactions. If the cardholder does not reconcile/approve accounts within 15 days
        after the end of the billing cycle, this becomes an approving official responsibility
        (the approving official is no longer acting on behalf of the cardholder).
        4.3.4.1.5. The approving official shall conduct reviews of 100% of cardholder files at
        least every 12 months to ensure documentation and reconciliation are being
        performed properly. Approving officials must also perform surveillance on
        convenience checking accounts as specified in 3.6.1.5 and newly appointed
        cardholders as specified in 4.3.3.5.1. Copies of surveillance results for new
        cardholders shall be provided to the A/OPC to assist them in providing tailored
        training for new cardholders.
        4.3.4.1.6. Cancellation of GPC accounts:
           4.3.4.1.6.1. Forward to the A/OPC, in writing (e-mail acceptable), a request to
           permanently cancel the account. The request must state that all transactions
           (charges and/or credits) have cleared the Bank and the card has been destroyed.
           When possible, cardholder accounts should be cancelled 60 days prior to
           reassignment or retirement to ensure all monthly statements of account have been
           reconciled and items purchased have been received.
           4.3.4.1.6.2. Notify the servicing FSO for adjustments to the funding document.
        4.3.4.1.7. Lost or Stolen Cards: The approving official shall submit a written report
        (e-mail acceptable) to the A/OPC within five days. The report will include:
           4.3.4.1.7.1. The GPC account number, the cardholder’s complete name;
32                                                 AFI64-117_482FWSUP_I 21 JUNE 2011


            4.3.4.1.7.2. The date and location (if known) of the lost/stolen card and the date
            reported to police;
            4.3.4.1.7.3. The date and time Bank was notified;
            4.3.4.1.7.4. Any purchase(s) made on the day the GPC was lost or stolen; and
            4.3.4.1.7.5. Any other pertaining information.
         4.3.4.1.8. A new GPC will be mailed within 24 hours of the reported loss or theft
         (Monday through Friday). For international card replacement, the Bank will replace
         lost or stolen cards within 48 hours of the reported loss or theft. If the cardholder
         finds the original GPC, it shall be cut in half and given to the approving official who
         will complete the destruction notice and forward it to the A/OPC. The A/OPC will
         contact the Bank to ensure the account is closed.
  4.3.5. Cardholder:
     4.3.5.1. General: The GPC bears the cardholder’s name and shall only be used by the
     named cardholder to pay for authorized US Government purchases. The GPC was
     specially imprinted with the Great Seal of the US and the words ―United States of
     America‖ to avoid being mistaken for a personal credit card. Cardholders are designated
     as accountable officials as described in Attachment 3. A cardholder who makes
     unauthorized purchases, allows others to use the card, or carelessly uses the GPC may be
     liable to the Government for the total dollar amount of unauthorized purchases made in
     connection with the misuse or negligence. He or she may also be subject to disciplinary
     action under DoD and USAF directives, regulations, Federal law and the Uniform Code
     of Military Justice. The Government shall be liable for use of GPCs by authorized
     cardholders.
     4.3.5.2. Conditions for Use: Each cardholder must ensure purchase limits assigned to the
     card account are not exceeded. The total amount of a single purchase may be comprised
     of multiple items, but it may not exceed the authorized single purchase limit. Purchases
     will be denied if the authorized single purchase limit, monthly spending limit, or
     quarterly spending limit are exceeded. Payment for purchases shall not be split in order to
     stay within the single purchase limit. Urgency or expenditure of end-of-year funds do not
     relieve the cardholder or approving official from compliance with the requirements of
     this AFI. Purchases which would exceed the single purchase limit must be forwarded
     through the proper channels to the contracting office for procurement.
         4.3.5.2.1. Cardholders are prohibited from making repeat buys of the same item to
         avoid the $2,500 limitation for purchasing and the $25,000 limitation for ordering
         using the GPC. In addition, no purchase from the same vendor may exceed the single
         purchase limit of $2,500 even if the individual items comprising the purchase have
         unit prices that are less than $2,500. The GPC was implemented to avoid the need for
         warehousing items and requisitioning items through the Supply system. This ―just-in-
         time‖ buying philosophy allows organizations the flexibility to buy items when they
         need them. However, there is no basis in regulation or law to permit cardholders to
         repetitively purchase an item when the cardholder knows or should have known of
         additional requirements for the same item that would result in an aggregate purchase
         greater than $2,500. There is a distinction between buying supplies and services based
AFI64-117_482FWSUP_I 21 JUNE 2011                                                            33


        on one’s own needs known at the time and buying for one’s organization based on the
        known organizational requirement or forecast. The following two examples illustrate
        the distinction:
        4.3.5.2.2. Example 1: On a Monday, a cardholder buys one $2,400 widget because
        that is their known requirement. The next day, they learn that someone in their
        organization needs another identical widget. As long as they made an honest effort to
        consolidate their organization’s requirements when they made the first buy, they have
        not split the requirement.
        4.3.5.2.3. Example 2: A cardholder normally holds all requests until the end of the
        day/week/ month so they will only have to make one buy. There is a steady, recurring
        requirement for a particular item. After realizing that their request has exceeded
        $2,500, they decide to buy part of their requirement one day and the remainder the
        next. This constitutes splitting a requirement because it was known or should have
        been known that the requirement exceeded $2,500. In cases such as these, a formal
        contract action must be initiated with the contracting office. The key component is the
        knowledge of the requirement the cardholder possessed at the time of purchase.
        4.3.5.2.4. Business advice should be sought from the contracting squadron/office to
        decide the best strategy for obtaining repetitive buy items and services. If a
        cardholder thinks their circumstance may be viewed by reviewers as splitting a
        requirement, they should contact their A/OPC for guidance. The cardholder should
        document the reason for any buy that may have the appearance of a split requirement.
        4.3.5.2.5. All items purchased/ordered should, in most cases, be available by the end
        of the next billing cycle. The item should be received or the service completed before
        the item appears on a statement of account. The Bank’s electronic access system does
        allow for approval of and payment for partial shipments. Approving officials have the
        discretion to authorize partial shipments; however, cardholders must track the
        remaining items to ensure they are received in a timely manner.
        4.3.5.2.6. For all purchases, the cardholder shall inform the merchant that it is for
        official US Government purposes and, therefore, not subject to state or local sales tax.
        The card is embossed with ―U.S. GOVT TAX EXEMPT‖ for additional clarification.
        Each cardholder is responsible for providing the tax-exempt number to the merchant
        if requested to do so. NOTE: Overseas cardholders are not exempt from paying
        foreign taxes unless foreign tax agreements so specify. Also, the Federal Government
        is not exempt from certain federal and state excise taxes or other taxes that the vendor
        may be required to pay, such as, the New Mexico’s Gross Receipts Tax or Arizona’s
        Transaction Privilege Tax.
     4.3.5.3. Making GPC purchases:
        4.3.5.3.1. General: All acquisition, supply, and finance regulations apply to GPC
        purchases Cardholders and approving officials must accomplish the following:
           4.3.5.3.1.1. Cardholders must document all GPC transactions in the electronic
           transaction management log provided by the Bank. Receipts (cash register
           ―tickets,‖ invoices, shipping/ packing documents or receiving reports, or
           electronic purchase confirmations are acceptable) for each purchase and other
34                                             AFI64-117_482FWSUP_I 21 JUNE 2011


        supporting documentation such as special approvals shall be maintained in a
        separate file and be available for review by the approving official and A/OPC,
        upon request.
        4.3.5.3.1.2. Ensure that funds are available to pay for items being purchased.
        Only firm-fixed price transactions are authorized.
        4.3.5.3.1.3. Ensure supplies or services provided by required (statutory) sources
        of supply IAW FAR Part 8 (FPI, Javits-Wagner-O’Day Program as implemented
        by NIB/NISH, etc) are purchased/ordered from these sources.
        4.3.5.3.1.4. Ensure the vendor is responsible for delivery to the location
        cardholder identifies when ordering (referred to as ―free on board‖ (f.o.b.)
        destination). The vendor may separately identify shipping charges on an invoice
        but these costs will be included in the single transaction when the purchase is
        made.
        4.3.5.3.1.5. Rotate Sources. Whenever practical, solicit suppliers in addition to
        the previous vendor before placing repeat orders.
        4.3.5.3.1.6. Ensure that a reasonable price is obtained. Comparing prices offered
        by other vendors for the same or similar item or service is the preferred method to
        determine prices as being fair and reasonable. If suppliers furnish standing price
        quotations or catalog prices on a recurring basis, obtaining competition on
        individual purchases is not necessary, but the prices should be periodically
        confirmed as current. When determining the number of sources to solicit, consider
        the nature of the item or service to be purchased and whether it is highly
        competitive; information from recent purchases of the same or similar items or
        services; the urgency of the purchase; the dollar value of the purchase; and past
        experience concerning dealer prices. A special effort should be made to solicit
        small and small disadvantaged businesses as a source for supplies and services
        whenever practicable.
        4.3.5.3.1.7. Cardholders must comply with the Affirmative Procurement
        Program. Items listed in the EPA’s Comprehensive Procurement Guidelines must
        contain the recommended recycled or recovered material content unless one of the
        exceptions is applicable. See 2.10.2. Questions on the EPA Comprehensive
        Procurement Guidelines should be addressed to the contracting office/squadron.
     4.3.5.3.2. Open-market transactions:
        4.3.5.3.2.1. Verify that the dollar amount is correct and that no sales tax has been
        included.
        4.3.5.3.2.2. For ―over-the-counter purchase‖ sign the sales draft and retain a copy
        for record purposes. Cardholder shall document all over-the-counter purchases in
        the transaction management log.
     4.3.5.3.3. Mail or telephone order purchases: When placing a telephone order to be
     paid using the GPC, the cardholder shall:
        4.3.5.3.3.1. Notify the vendor that the purchase is tax-exempt. Provide the tax-
        exempt number to the merchant if requested.
AFI64-117_482FWSUP_I 21 JUNE 2011                                                              35


            4.3.5.3.3.2. Confirm the vendor agrees to charge the GPC when shipment is made
            so that receipt of the supplies may be certified on the Statement of Accounts for
            that billing cycle.
            4.3.5.3.3.3. Instruct the vendor to include the following information on the
            shipping document or packing slip to alert the receiving offices and requisitioning
            office that the supplies have been purchased with the GPC.
                4.3.5.3.3.3.1. Cardholder name and correspondence symbol;
                4.3.5.3.3.3.2. Building number, room number, street address, city and state;
                4.3.5.3.3.3.3. Cardholder telephone number; and
                4.3.5.3.3.3.4. The term ―Government-wide Purchase Card.‖
            4.3.5.3.3.4. Cardholder shall document purchases in the transaction management
            log when the order is placed.
        4.3.5.3.4. Internet Purchases. Internet purchases must be limited to those web sites
        that provide secure transaction safeguards. Purchases made via the Internet must
        comply with the requirements of 4.3.5.3.3 to the maximum extent practicable, subject
        to the limitations of the web site.
        4.3.5.3.5. Manufacturer/Retailer Rebates: Cardholders should take advantage of any
        rebates offered. Manufacturer/retailer rebates shall be made payable or endorsed to
        the USAF. All rebates in the form of checks or cash should be forwarded to the FSO.
        Rebates will be processed as an appropriation refund to the approving official’s
        organization and should be credited to the applicable funding document.
     4.3.5.4. The cardholder shall obtain independent verification of receipt of all items
     purchased using the GPC valued in excess of $500.00, as well as all items considered to
     be sensitive or pilferable regardless of dollar value. Receipt must be documented by
     indicating "received", the date, and the signature of the person verifying receipt on the
     vendor receipt, sales receipt, shipping document, credit card receipt, or equivalent
     document. The individual verifying receipt may be the cardholder's approving official,
     supervisor, or other designated individual, as appropriate. The cardholder shall notify the
     property custodian of all purchase of accountable property, including pilferable items
     upon receipt of the item.
     4.3.5.5. Documentation and Retention: The following documentation shall be
     maintained:
        4.3.5.5.1. Documents received and/or generated by the cardholder to support
        transactions shall be retained for three years after final payment. Data residing in the
        Bank’s electronic access system is maintained by the Bank for six years and three
        months. Reports may be retrieved from the Bank’s electronic access system for up to
        the previous two years. Reports covering data for periods beyond the previous two
        years are available from the Bank upon request. (AFMAN 37-139)
        4.3.5.5.2. On-line certification of invoices and online approval of statements are
        processed using electronic signature via the Bank’s electronic access system. The
36                                                  AFI64-117_482FWSUP_I 21 JUNE 2011


        Bank will maintain electronic signature and invoice data for six years and three
        months for documentation purposes (AFMAN 37-139).
        4.3.5.5.3. Documents generated by the A/OPC supporting cardholders and approving
        officials, destroy three years after card is canceled. Letters of appointment, training
        records and letter delegating purchasing authority, retain until three years after the
        account is closed. (AFMAN 37-139).
        4.3.5.5.4. Any record pertinent to a dispute, investigation or similar matter must be
        destroyed six months after final clearance or settlement (including time allotted for
        appeals) destroy after the retention period specified for credit cards under Rule 26,
        whichever is later (AFMAN 37-139, Table 64-4, Rules 26 and 26.2).
        4.3.5.5.5. All purchase card program management and administrative records
        generated by A/OPCs and approving officials, such as records of cardholder and
        approving official appointments and training, cardholder delegations of authority, and
        purchase card surveillances, shall be retained for three years.
     4.3.5.6. Reconciliation and Payment Procedures: Each month the cardholder must
     reconcile the statement of account (SOA) via the Bank’s electronic access system.
     Cardholders must reconcile transactions and approve their electronic statement of
     accounts within three workdays of the end of the billing cycle. Approving officials must
     review and approve the cardholder’s statement of accounts via the Bank’s electronic
     access system not later than fifteen days after the end of the billing cycle. Cardholders are
     encouraged to reconcile transactions periodically during the billing cycle, as they are
     posted, to expedite this process. When the cardholder is transferred, reassigned, retires,
     all original supporting documentation (receipts, approvals, etc) will be provided to the
     approving official.
     4.3.5.6. (482FW) All Government Purchasing Card Cardholders are required to
     reconcile the purchases on their cards monthly. As such, all Billing Officials,
     Cardholders and Resource Advisors (Accountable Officials) must reconcile their
     statements each month with the AF Form 4009, Government Purchase Card Fund Cite
     Authorization, and funding targets in the accounting system to ensure sufficient funds are
     available to pay their current statement, pending charges from previous purchases, and
     any anticipated purchases for next billing cycle. No purchases above the amount on the
     AF Form 4009 will ever be made.
        4.3.5.6.1. Review and reconcile all transactions on the statement of accounts. The
        cardholder shall take note of any purchases billed that have not yet been received and
        any items that have been received but not yet billed. If either of these conditions exist,
        the cardholder shall take appropriate follow-up action.
        4.3.5.6.1. (482FW) Immediately after the July billing cycle each year, the
        Accountable Officials must meet with FM to reconcile their cards. GPCs determined
        to be non-mission essential will be closed and the officials will sign a certification
        statement that they have reconciled and reserved sufficient funds on their cards to
        cover all fiscal year expenses. GPCs determined to be mission essential will remain
        open with sufficient funds to cover anticipated purchases for the remainder of the
        fiscal year. After the last billing cycle, the mission-essential GPC officials will again
AFI64-117_482FWSUP_I 21 JUNE 2011                                                              37


        reconcile the card with FM and at that time sign a certification statement that they
        have reconciled and reserved sufficient funds on their cards to meet all fiscal year.
        4.3.5.6.2. Retain in the file a copy of original supporting documentation as indicated
        in paragraph 4.3.5.4.1..
     4.3.5.7. Resolving Problems with the SOA. Cardholders should try resolving problems
     directly with the vendor. In most cases, cardholders will be able to resolve problems by
     contacting the vendor. If problems cannot be resolved with the vendor, the cardholder
     must dispute the item on their statement of accounts via the Bank’s electronic access
     system. Disputes must be filed within 60 days from the end of the billing cycle in which
     the charges were posted.
        4.3.5.7.1. If the dispute charge involves sales tax or transportation costs charged
        erroneously by the merchant, the amount of the tax or erroneous transportation costs
        cannot be disputed through Visa Chargeback Regulations. Cardholder shall make
        every effort to obtain a credit for the amount of the tax or transportation costs from
        the merchant. If a credit is not obtained, ordering agencies must pay the tax or
        transportation costs. The cardholder should document the file accordingly. The
        cardholder should request assistance from the A/OPC if he/she is unsuccessful in
        recovering the taxes paid from the merchant.
        4.3.5.7.2. If items purchased with the card are found to be defective, the cardholder
        shall obtain a replacement or correction of the item as soon as possible. If the
        merchant refuses to replace or correct the faulty item, the cardholder will consider the
        item in dispute. Items in dispute are handled in the same manner as billing errors.
        Credited amounts may not be added back to the funding document or reused by the
        cardholder without coordination from the FSO.
     4.3.5.8. Leave or Travel: If the cardholder will be on leave or TDY for an extended
     period he/she must notify the approving official prior to departure and provide whatever
     information the approving official deems necessary to act on the cardholder’s behalf. In
     the cardholder’s absence, the approving official must, within 15 days after the end of the
     billing cycle, log into the bank’s electronic access system acting on behalf of the
     cardholder and reconcile all valid transactions. The approving official will then access the
     Bank’s electronic access system as usual and approve all valid transactions. Note: If the
     cardholder has access to the Internet, he/she can reconcile transactions from TDY
     locations and every attempt should be made to do so.
     4.3.5.9. Cancellation of GPC account: Upon reassignment, separation, retirement, etc., a
     cardholder shall surrender the GPC to the approving official at least 30 days prior to
     departure. In addition, the cardholder will provide to the approving official a record of all
     outstanding purchases that have yet to be received or billed to their GPC account or
     credits due and their forwarding address and phone number. If there are no pending
     charges, the cardholder shall provide a memo stating there are no outstanding purchases
     chargeable to the account or credits due. The approving official will send e-mail to the
     A/OPC stating all transactions (charges/credits) have cleared the Bank, the GPC has been
     destroyed and request cancellation. The A/OPC will cancel the account via the Bank’s
     electronic access system. At the discretion of the A/OPC, close-out surveillance may be
     required prior to cancellation of accounts.
38                                                  AFI64-117_482FWSUP_I 21 JUNE 2011


     4.3.5.10. Security: The cardholder will safeguard the GPC and account number at all
     times. When the GPC is not being used, it shall either be carried on the cardholder’s
     person (in wallet or purse) or secured in a locked container. A cardholder shall not allow
     anyone to use his/her account number. If a GPC is lost or stolen, the cardholder must
     notify their approving official and the Bank immediately. See procedures at 4.3.4.1.7 for
     Lost and Stolen cards.
  4.3.6. Financial Services Offices (FSO).
     4.3.6.1. General. The FSO is responsible for providing training and advice to cardholders
     and approving officials on financial issues, account reconciliation and confirmation,
     certification procedures, and the appropriate use of funds. The FSO is also responsible for
     providing a certified funding document for each account established and certification of
     payment invoices. The FSO also serves as the liaison between the installation and the
     paying office.
     4.3.6.2. Funding document (See Attachment 3): The Government Purchase Card Fund
     Cite Authorization Document, AF Form 4009, is to be used to designate the accounting
     classification to be charged at the time of payment for all purchases made by cardholders
     assigned to the respective account. A funding document with $1.00 may be established in
     order to designate a Master Account Code for Contingency Contracting Officers who will
     be purchasing in support of contingencies or exercises.
         4.3.6.2.1. The AF Form 4009 is used as a funding document and to record
         commitments into the Integrated Accounts Payable System (IAPS). Commitments are
         not posted directly to the General Accounting and Finance System (GAFS). The AF
         Form 4009 is also used to generate the default line of accounting for each managing
         account number. The FSO is required to input quarterly limits equal to the amount of
         the AF Form 4009 in the first quarter. At the beginning of the second, third, and
         fourth quarters, the FSO may leave the same quarterly limit or increase the amount
         for that quarter by the residual balance of the previous quarter. The managing account
         number, also referred to as the approving official account number, consists of 16
         digits. The master account number block of the AF Form 4009 must include the full
         16 digit managing account number. The AF Form 4009 document number consists of
         the last 12 digits of the managing account number plus a 2 digit fiscal year designator,
         a total of 14 digits. Example: If the managing account number is 4716 3045 1234
         5678 and the fiscal year is 05; then the document number on the AF Form 4009
         would be 30451234567805.
         4.3.6.2.2. Commitments are not loaded in IAPS for Stock Fund Accounts such as
         Medical and Dental Accounts (Fund Code 6B) or for Centrally Managed Accounts
         such as the Military Personnel Account (Fund Code 32) as non-addressable entries.
         The AF Form 4009 should be prepared and entered with an XPSR/XDSR address to
         control the quarterly spending limit. Fund certification is not required. The Managing
         Account Number, full line of accounting and Stock Record Account Number (SRAN)
         for Stock Fund accounts are required to be provided to the DFAS OPLOC point of
         contact to allow the contract to be established manually.
AFI64-117_482FWSUP_I 21 JUNE 2011                                                            39


        4.3.6.2.3. The funding shall be issued on a quarterly basis. In most cases, the AF
        Form 4009 expiration date is annual (1 October through 30 September). Any other
        expiration date should be coordinated with the A/OPC and Financial Analysis Office.
        4.3.6.2.4. The FSO will also provide training on all financial management issues.
        4.3.6.2.5. Limit fund cites to the funds supporting the operation of the organization to
        which the funding document is issued. Funding documents may not be issued that
        would result in ―cross disbursements‖ or ―for others.‖
            4.3.6.2.5.1. If O&M funds are used, use the predominant Element of
            Expense/Investment Code (EEIC) that applies to the majority of the purchases to
            be made on the account. If there is no predominant EEIC, use 61950. (Not
            applicable to accounting classifications not requiring an EEIC.) Authorized
            medical logistics personnel will use Medical Dental Division (MDD) fund cites
            and process purchases through the current medical logistics Accounting
            Information System (AIS) to appropriately expense issues to O&M funded
            activities.
        4.3.6.2.6. The FSO must certify funds availability on the funding document. The
        funding certification is a qualified certification. The certification is accomplished at
        the time the funding document is issued and it does not have to be re-certified each
        quarter. If funds are not available, notify the approving official that purchases cannot
        be made on the account until notification is received that funds are available. The
        FSO must notify the A/OPC of any account that lacks sufficient funds to cover its
        purchases.
        4.3.6.2.7. Recording commitments. The posting of the commitment amount is in
        IAPS. IAPS then records the commitment amount in GAPS. Basically, the
        commitment is entered into IAPS, recorded in IAPS and the IAPS interface with
        GAFS records the commitment in GAFS. At the beginning of the second, third, and
        fourth quarter, increase the existing amount by the quarterly commitment amount
        shown on the funding document, as applicable. See the payment office procedures in
        paragraph 4.4 below for de-commitment and obligation recording.
        4.3.6.2.8. Centrally Managed Allotment (CMAs). Funding documents are required
        for cards that make purchases that are paid from CMAs such as subsistence-in-kind
        (SIK) purchases from the commissary. The FSO will establish a management account
        number for these funding documents and verify that the cite is correct. No fund
        certification is required.
     4.3.6.3. Fiscal Year End Close-out Procedures:
        4.3.6.3.1. Introduction.
            4.3.6.3.1.1. The following procedures apply to all Air Force automated
            Government Purchase Card accounts. American Standards Committee (ASC) X-
            12 electronic data interchange (EDI) transactions are utilized to pass financial
            data from the bank to the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS). EDI
            transactions are transmitted to the Defense Electronic Business Exchange
            (DEBX) where they translated into user defined format (UDF) files that are then
40                                            AFI64-117_482FWSUP_I 21 JUNE 2011


        routed to the Integrated Accounts Payable System (IAPS) for processing. Current
        ASC X-12 EDI transactions are:
            4.3.6.3.1.1.1. ASC X-12 821 Financial Data transactions are used to record an
            obligation and/or an accrued expenditure unpaid (AEU) balances in
            accounting records for each master account number.
            4.3.6.3.1.1.2. ASC X-12 810 Certified Invoice transaction used to liquidate
            AEU balances and to record disbursements for the certified amount for each
            master account.
            4.3.6.3.1.1.3. These procedures are provided to assist with understanding the
            IAPS functionality developed to support fiscal year closeout and roll over of
            the GPC accounts.
     4.3.6.3.2. September Cycle.
        4.3.6.3.2.1. The following applies to all 821 transactions received and processed
        in IAPS beginning with the September cycle. An AEU balance will be recorded in
        the accounting system rather than an obligation (UOO) balance. The September
        cycle close date is September 25 for active Air Force accounts. NOTE:
        Requirement to record AEU balances does not apply to Medical Dental Working
        Capital Fund (WCF) (Fund Code 6B) accounts. Accruals for Medical dental
        accounts are recorded based on actual receipts processed through the Medical
        Logistics system.
        4.3.6.3.2.2. Other than the change for recording AEU balances the September
        cycle will be processed as usual. Every effort must be taken to ensure all 821
        transactions have successfully processed prior to September 29. This is to ensure
        that all expenses are accounted for in the fiscal year in which they accrue.
     4.3.6.3.3. Closeout and Rollover of GPC Accounts.
        4.3.6.3.3.1. A new IAPS fiscal yearend program (NTQYG0) should be executed
        on September 29. This program will be used to close out the commitment balance
        on all GPC accounts loaded in IAPS. Residual commitment balance of $1 dollar
        or more will be used to fund a yearend computer generated Miscellaneous
        Obligation Reimbursement Document (MORD) that will be retained to fund
        unbilled balances for those accounts. IAPS will also create a one-time contract
        record for each MORD generated. The MORD/Contract number will be the same
        as the Purchase Request number used to fund the MORD. (NOTE: Purchase
        Request Numbers are equal to the last twelve positions of the master account
        number followed by a two-position fiscal year. Example: 30455512345602)
        4.3.6.3.3.2. A MORD will not be generated for any commitment record with a
        balance of less than $1. To ensure a MORD is generated and is available to pay
        subsequent bills every Approving Official (AO) and Financial Service Office
        (FSO) must ensure that a commitment amount is recorded in IAPS and is
        sufficient enough to cover unbilled charges. A MORD will not be created for
        Medical Dental Working Capital Fund (WCF) (Fund Code 6B) accounts and any
        unbilled charges will be charged against the Master Contract Record for the
AFI64-117_482FWSUP_I 21 JUNE 2011                                                          41


           account at the time of billing.
           4.3.6.3.3.3. A two-part report will be generated for each IAPS Site ID and will
           provide the results of the closeout program. Part 1 will be a Reconciliation Error
           List that shows all account numbers and reasons why a MORD was not generated.
           Part 2 is the Converted Purchase Request To MORD List that provides the
           account numbers for which a MORD was generated and the balance that was
           transferred to the MORD. All balances transferred to the MORD are de-
           committed and the MORD balance is recorded as an AEU balance in the
           applicable accounting system.
           4.3.6.3.3.4. Once all applicable balances have been transferred to a MORD
           contract, IAPS will de-commit all remaining balance in all prior year Purchase
           Request records and will establish new advance planning Purchase Request
           records for the new fiscal year. When funds are available in the new fiscal year
           FSO personnel will use the PR Maintenance function in IAPS to load new year
           funds as a commitment.
        4.3.6.3.4. Month 13 Billing Cycle.
           4.3.6.3.4.1. On or about October 3 the bank will generate a special fiscal yearend
           bill referred to as Month 13. The Month 13 cycle close date will be October 2 and
           will include charges for all purchases received and posted by the bank between
           the September cycle close date and the Month 13 cycle close date. The bank
           system is designed to generate bills based on the Post Date of the transaction. For
           that reason, and to allow for a normal processing time of two days between
           Purchase Date and Post Date at the bank, all transactions with a Post Date of
           October 2, or earlier will be included in the Month 13 billing cycle. If a
           transaction is erroneously charged to the prior fiscal year, the Approving Official
           may provide receipts or other dated evidence that supports processing of a SF
           1081 to transfer the charge to current year. Screen prints of the bank Purchase
           Log are also considered acceptable evidence to support the transfer if it shows
           that the purchase date was in a different fiscal year than was actually charged.
           4.3.6.3.4.2. Normal EDI transactions (821s) will be generated by the bank for the
           Month 13 cycle and will flow to the Defense Electronic Business Exchange
           (DEBX) the night of October 3, and subsequently to IAPS for processing. Normal
           IAPS processing of the Month 13 cycle applies except that the yearend MORD
           will be used to fund the billed amount. The amount recorded on the MORD was
           previously recorded as an AEU balance so no accounting entry will be made at
           time of processing of the 821s.
           4.3.6.3.4.3. The FSO will certify the Month 13 cycle the same as all other
           monthly cycles and their certification of the Month 13 Summary Invoice will
           result in the 810 transactions flowing to DFAS for payment processing. At time of
           processing of the 810 transactions, the available balance recorded on the MORD
           will be reduced by the amount of the certified invoice. Accounting transactions
           will be processed in the applicable accounting system to reduce the AEU balance
           and record the disbursement. Any residual AEU balance will be reduced to zero in
           IAPS and the MORD will be deleted out of IAPS. The residual balance and the
42                                                 AFI64-117_482FWSUP_I 21 JUNE 2011


            MORD will be left recorded in the accounting system with the residual AEU
            balance. AEU balances left recorded in the accounting system are available for
            future charges resulting from processing of a SF 1081, Schedule of Voucher
            Correction to transfer purchases charged to current year funds that should have
            been charged to prior year funds. FSO personnel must ensure that all available
            balances are liquidated or re-validated not later than six months into the new
            fiscal year.
        4.3.6.3.5. Updating Lines of Accounting.
            4.3.6.3.5.1. The bank will automatically update all appropriations in all
            IAPS/GAFS Parent and Child Rule Sets to reflect new fiscal year values. The
            following rules will apply to the update of all applicable appropriations.
                4.3.6.3.5.1.1. Rule 1– Where current fiscal year (example 2002) appears in
                positions 7 through 10 of the appropriation value the increment position 6 and
                position 10 by 1 and replace values in those positions.
                4.3.6.3.5.1.2. Rule 2 – Delete all appropriations for Parent Rule Sets that have
                a fiscal year less than current fiscal year (example 2002) in positions 7
                through 10.
     4.3.6.4. Certification of the Invoice for Payment. GPC invoices will be paid using ―Pay
     and Confirm‖ procedures. The FSO will designate a certifying officer to certify the
     monthly installation invoices for payment prior to receipt of the confirmation statements
     from the approving officials. (For detailed certifying officer procedures, see Attachment
     2.)
        4.3.6.4.1. The FSO is the office designated to receive the invoice for the GPC
        program. Upon receipt of the official invoice, the FSO will verify the amount
        remaining on each funding document is sufficient to cover the total amount of the
        invoice. The available balance may be recorded as an obligation on a call placed
        against the funding document, or may be recorded as a commitment as part of the
        quarterly commitment amount. An increase to the commitment or call obligation
        amount must be posted if sufficient funds are not available on the funding document.
        4.3.6.4.2. If the Managing Account Number is not shown in the accounting code line
        on the invoice, the FSO will annotate the applicable funding document numbers for
        each account on the invoice and certify the invoice for payment on a ―pay and
        confirm‖ basis. The FSO will contact the A/OPC to update the approving officials
        account setup information.
        4.3.6.4.3. The FSO will not reconcile approving official certified SOAs with invoices
        paid prior to certifying the invoice for payment.
        4.3.6.4.4. Cardholders and approving officials will verify the statements and resolve
        any irregularities through the dispute process. Disputes will be resolved between the
        cardholder and the vendor to the maximum extent possible. If the dispute cannot be
        resolved with the vendor, follow the process described in 4.3.5.7.
     4.3.6.5. Cancellation of Approving Official and/or Cardholder Accounts:
AFI64-117_482FWSUP_I 21 JUNE 2011                                                           43


        4.3.6.5.1. Upon reassignment, separation, or retirement, the approving official must
        turn in his/her funding document to the FSO. If a new approving official is being
        assigned, a replacement funding document should be issued to the new approving
        official. The replacement funding document may be assigned the same Management
        Account Number if the fund cite remains the same and the new approving official
        agrees to assume responsibility for the pre-existing funding document. All cardholder
        accounts remain active under the new approving official and those cardholders will
        continue to be able to make purchases.
            4.3.6.5.1.1. If the new funding document is issued with a different Management
            Account Number, and the fund site remains the same, the cardholder’s account
            setup information must be updated with the new Management Account Number.
            After updating the Management Account Number, all cardholder’s accounts will
            remain active under the new approving official.
            4.3.6.5.1.2. If a new funding document with a different fund cite is issued to a
            new approving official, all cardholders assigned must establish new accounts with
            the new Management Account Number. The departing approving official must
            close and reconcile their account with the FSO. All cardholders assigned to the
            old account must turn in their cards.
        4.3.6.5.2. Upon reassignment, separation, or retirement, the cardholder must
        surrender his/her card(s). The approving official shall request the FSO to adjust funds
        authorized on the funding document, if necessary. Normally, if another cardholder is
        assigned to replace the previous cardholder, an adjustment should not be necessary.
     4.3.6.6. Cost Reallocation Procedures
        4.3.6.6.1. Reallocation of Expenses.
            4.3.6.6.1.1. The Air Force version of GPC provides the capability to reallocate
            expenses within the same appropriation. This capability is also referred to as Cost
            Transfer and the ASC X12 transaction used to process reallocations is the ASC
            X12 – 821-CT (Cost Transfer). All purchases initially received and posted to a
            cardholder account at the bank are assigned the default line of accounting current
            for the account at the time of posting. The default line of accounting is the same
            line of accounting that is current on the AF Form 4009, Government Purchase
            Card Fund Cite Authorization. The default line of accounting is also the lines of
            accounting loaded in IAPS for processing of all 821 and 810 transactions received
            in monthly billing cycles.
            4.3.6.6.1.2. The FSO may pre-authorize any Approving Official and Cardholder
            to reallocate expenses to a different line of accounting so long as the new line of
            accounting cites the same appropriation. The different line of accounting is
            referred to as an alternate line of accounting (alternate LOAs). Alternate lines of
            accounting are established by the FSO and are assigned names to allow
            cardholders or approving officials to more quickly identify the appropriate
            alternate LOA for transfer of the charges. Example, an alternate LOA may be
            named ―TRAINING‖ or it may be named ―PRINTING‖. The name should also
            include other identifying information such as RC/CC or DODAAC to make
44                                                  AFI64-117_482FWSUP_I 21 JUNE 2011


             maintenance easier. The fiscal year should not be included in the name since the
             Bank will automatically convert the fiscal year in all alternate LOAs.
             4.3.6.6.1.3. Approving Officials or Cardholders authorized to use the reallocation
             function in the bank system may enter their request to reallocate a charge at any
             time after the purchase has been posted in the bank system by the merchant. Re-
             allocations request may be made based on a percentage of the purchase amount or
             based on any portion of the total amount. However, all reallocation must zero
             balance. This means that any amount removed from the default line of accounting
             must be reallocated to another or multiple LOAs if authorized. Reallocations can
             only be made to ALOAs that have been previously authorized by the FSO.
             4.3.6.6.1.4. Even though a purchase has been re-allocated, the original default
             line of accounting will be charged on the monthly billing cycle. If the monthly
             amount to be billed on the master account is a positive amount and greater than
             zero, the re-allocation request will be honored and an 821-CT transaction will be
             generated by the bank system at the close of the next billing cycle. Example: A
             reallocation request for a purchase billed in March cycle invoice (810) will result
             in an 821-CT flowing to the applicable DFAS accounting system on the close date
             of the April cycle. This allows the initial expense recorded by the 810 transactions
             and the re-allocation recorded by the 821-CT to be processed in the same
             accounting month.
             4.3.6.6.1.5. In no case may an alternate line of accounting be assigned to a
             cardholder or approving official that has a different appropriation in the alternate
             line than is in their default line of accounting. This is required because
             reallocation transactions are Journal Voucher entries that are posted directly to the
             accounting system. Alternate lines of accounting must also have the same fiscal
             year in the appropriation and reallocation of expenses between fiscal years is not
             authorized. If a purchase is initially charged to the wrong fiscal year, it must be
             transferred to the correct year by use of a SF 1081, Schedule of Voucher
             Correction.
             4.3.6.6.1.6. Reallocations entered in the bank system between the close of the
             August cycle and the start date of the first cycle of each fiscal year will not be
             processed. This is necessary to ensure all re-allocation are processed with the
             same fiscal in the alternate line and in the default line of accounting. Example:
             The August 2002 cycle ends on August 25, 2002 for all Air Force accounts. A
             transaction posted at US Bank between those dates and October 3, 2002 may not
             be re-allocated. This is necessary because re-allocations of purchases posted after
             the August 25 cycle close dates will not be billed until the September cycle. The
             Cost-Transfer transactions would not flow until the close of the October cycle and
             that would result in a transfer between fiscal years.
  4.3.7. GPC Rebates: During the year, the Bank provides rebates, in the form of credits to the
  billing accounts, based on sales and prompt payment. These rebates will be returned to the
  approving official and cardholder accounts and shall be processed as an appropriation refund.
  Rebates attributable to accounts closed during the rebate cycle will be returned to the
  servicing FSO for appropriate redistribution.
AFI64-117_482FWSUP_I 21 JUNE 2011                                                                 45


   4.3.8. Logistics Readiness Squadron Commander (LRSC)/Chief of Supply (COS): The
   LRSC/COS is encouraged to delete stock levels of commercial items but use discretion to
   accommodate local circumstances. The LRSC/COS informs base activities which types of
   categories of commercial items will no longer be stocked to enable the base activities to
   procure the items through commercial sources. For installations that use Logistics
   Management Control Activities (LMCAs), cardholders may contact LMCA instead of the
   LRSC/COS and the LMCA has the responsibility assigned to the LRSC/COS above.
4.4. DFAS Processing. The DFAS Site supporting the activity for accounting and vendor
payments will be responsible for receipt and processing of all ASC X12 821 (obligation/Accrual)
transactions and ASC X12 810 (Certified Invoices). The 821 transactions are generated by the
Bank on the first business day following the close of the monthly cycle. The cycle close date for
the active Air Force is the 25th of each month or the last business day prior to the 25th if the 25th
falls on a weekend or holiday. The cycle close date for the Air National Guard (ANG) is the 23rd
or the last business day prior to the 23rd if the 23rd falls on a weekend or holiday.
   4.4.1. Processing 821 Transactions. The 821 transactions will automatically be processed in
   the first IAPS update following receipt of the 821 transactions. Results of processing the 821
   will appear on the TQ-157 Report. The Accounts Payable area of the supporting DFAS
   Vendor Pay office will be responsible for correcting any rejects of 821 transactions for the
   active Air Force sites. The ANG site will be responsible for correcting and processing of any
   rejected 821 transactions for their ANG site. Processing of 821 transactions will result in
   recording of an obligation for the full amount of purchases for the cycle and the commitment
   balance recorded in IAPS will be de-committed if applicable for the amount of the recorded
   obligation. Note: The 821 transactions will result in recording of an accrued expenditure
   unpaid (AEU) balance for the total amount of the 821.
   4.4.2. Processing 810 Transactions. After verifying that all 821 transactions have
   successfully processed in IAPS, a certifying official assigned to the FSO or ANG site will
   certify their consolidated invoice. Certification of the consolidated invoice results in the
   release of the 810 Certified Invoice transactions. The 810 transactions will be processed in
   first IAPS update after receipt. The 810 transactions are matched to the 821 transactions and
   the accrual is liquidated. The payment of 810 transactions is processed following ―Pay &
   Confirm‖ procedures. As a result the payment is scheduled on the earliest available payment
   date. The receipt confirmation is accomplished by the approving official approving their
   account.
4.5. The Bank Card System. The following highlights the Bank’s functions and
responsibilities:
   4.5.1. Training: The Bank will provide training via their Internet-based training site.
   4.5.2. Card Distribution: The Bank will mail the GPC to the cardholder or designated
   distribution point within 24 hours of receipt of the electronic request.
   4.5.3. Replacement of Lost or Stolen Cards: The Bank will replace lost or stolen cards
   within 24 hours after the loss is reported to the Bank (Monday through Friday). For
   international card replacement, the Bank will replace lost or stolen cards within 48 hours.

  4.5.4. Card Reissue. The Bank will reissue GPCs every 24 months to each cardholder. The
  Bank will send to each A/OPC a card reissue report that lists each card scheduled for renewal
  at least 3 months prior to the expiration date of each GPC.
  4.5.5. Standard and ad hoc reports are available through queries of the Bank’s electronic
  access system.
  4.5.6. Foreign Draft Service. This service allows account holders the ability to issue drafts in
  foreign currency at locations where charge cards are not accepted.
  4.5.7. Customer Service: The Bank will provide dedicated customer service and billing
  adjustment personnel support to both domestic and international cardholders 24 hours per
  day, 365 days a year. These services include, at a minimum, transaction authorization and
  verification, reporting of lost or stolen cards, and cardholder account inquiries.

                                            Attachment 2
  CERTIYING OFFICER AND ACCOUNTABLE OFFICIAL REQUIREMENTS FOR
                 THE GOVERNMENT PURCHASE CARD

1. Background. DoD policy requires the appointment of Certifying Officers in accordance with
Title 31, United States Code, section 3325. Certifying Officers have pecuniary liability for
erroneous payments resulting from performance of their duties in accordance with Title 31,
United States Code, section 3328. Further, it is DoD policy that other officials involved in
authorizing payments are accountable, and that these Accountable Officials are accountable for
erroneous payments resulting from negligent performance of their responsibilities. DoD
guidance is provided in DoD Financial Management Regulation, Volume 5, Chapter 33.
      a. Certifying Officers are responsible for certifying that payment vouchers are correct and
      proper for payment.
      b. Accountable Officials. Approving officials and cardholders are designated as accountable
      officials and must attest to the accuracy of information and data provided to the Certifying
      Officer in support of the payment to the Bank. If identified by the installation commander or
      activity director, other personnel may also be designated as accountable officials. See
      paragraph 2.b.(3) below.
2. Responsibilities and Certification Statements.
      a. Purchase Card Certifying Officers. Each Air Force Financial Services Officer (FSO)
      that is not a Deputy Disbursing officer (DDO) will appoint the Certifying Officer, and an
      alternate, for certifying payments to the paying office (disbursing officer) for installation
      invoices/billing statements. In those cases where the FSO is the DDO, the Installation
      Comptroller will make the appointments. The Certifying Officer is responsible for the
      accuracy of payments, including the proper citing of appropriations or other funds,
      certified to the paying office and disbursing officer. Certifying Officers are liable for any
      illegal, improper, or incorrect payment processed by the Air Force Department as a result
      of any inaccurate or misleading certification. A Certifying Officer will not approve as
      proper for payment any charges which were known to be fraudulent or known to be made
      by an unauthorized cardholder. Suspected improper payments should be reported
      immediately; however, payment should still be made to the financial institution. Since
      payments are to the financial institution, the certifying officer is responsible for certifying
      the legality and accuracy of the information pertaining to the amount owed the financial
      institution, not for the total propriety of all the purchases made for the billing period. Every
      purchase made by an authorized cardholder using an authorized card creates a legal
      obligation of the government, even if it is in violation of public law or if it exceeds fund
      availability. In the event an approving official authorizes a purchase ora cardholder
      exceeds his/her limit, the invoice must be paid and sufficient funds must be obtained from
      the responsible fund holder.
         (1) A Certifying Officer may be relieved from liability if the certification was based on
         official records and the officer did not know, and by reasonable diligence and inquiry,
         could not have discovered the correct information. For example, if a cardholder loses
         the card and fails to make the required notification, and unauthorized purchases are
AFI64-117_482FWSUP_I 21 JUNE 2011                                                                  53


         made, the Certifying Officer may be relieved from liability. Also, liability will not be
         assessed, in most cases, when (1) the obligation was incurred in good faith, (2) no law
         specifically prohibited the payment; and (3) the United States Government received
         value for payment.
         (2) Certification of the invoice must be accomplished in accordance with ―pay and
         confirm‖ procedures. Guidance for the ―pay and confirm‖ policy is contained in DoD
         Purchase Card Reengineering Implementation Memo #3, Streamlined Financial
         Management Procedures. The memo states ―…the Department and its Components
         shall implement a ―pay and confirm‖ process whereby payment of invoices will be
         made promptly subject to follow-on verification of receipt and acceptance of goods.‖
         (3) The Financial Services Office is the designated billing office for each installation.
         The Certifying Officer, upon verification of funding, shall certify the invoice for
         payment and forward it electronically to the designated payment office. As identified in
         the DoD Purchase Card Reengineering Implementation Memo #1, use the following
         format for the Certifying Officer statement.


Figure A2.1. Certifying Officer Statement.

Certifying Officer Statement                                                Date: _____________


Pursuant to the authority vested in me, I certify that this invoice (billing statement) is correct and
proper for payment, except as may be noted herein or on supporting documents.

         (4) The official installation GPC invoice is available, on-line, via the Bank’s
         electronic access system. Starting on the second day after the end of the billing
         cycle, usually the 27th of the month, the Certifying Officer must verify that the
         amount of funding, by managing account, is sufficient to cover the total amount
         of the invoice. An increase to obligation amount must be posted if sufficient
         funds are not available. Not later than 7 days after the end of the billing cycle, the
         Certifying Officer must certify the invoice for payment on the ―pay and confirm‖
         basis.
         (5) Certifying Officer must ensure confirmation procedures and controls are
         effectively in place. Prior to certifying the current month’s invoice, either (1) all
         confirmation statements from the prior month’s invoice must be received within
 54                                                   AFI64-117_482FWSUP_I 21 JUNE 2011


         30 days or (2) notice by the A/OPC must be received that the cards with missing
         confirmation statements have been suspended or cancelled.
             (a) If approving official accounts are not reconciled and approved before the next
             billing cycle, the Financial Services Officer (FSO) must take documented follow-up
             actions. The FSO must run a report via the Bank’s electronic access system that lists
             all approving official accounts that have not been reconciled and approved since the
             close of the billing cycle. The FSO must notify the A/OPC in writing with the report
             as an attachment identifying which approving officials have not complied. The
             A/OPC will reduce the approving officials’ monthly limits to $1, pending approval.
             (b) When approving officials have indicated exceptions (other than questioned items
             or disputes) to the statements, appropriate and timely corrective actions must be
             taken.
             (c) In accordance with AFI 64-117, paragraph 4.3.3.4, the A/OPC and the FSO
             should be notified immediately by any official or individual suspecting improper
             purchases.
      b. Purchase Card Accountable Officials. Accountable Officials are accountable for
      erroneous payments that result from inaccurate information and data, including designation
      of the proper appropriations provided to the Certifying Officer, if the erroneous payment is
      the result of negligence relative to performance of assigned duties.
         (1) Approving officials, and alternates, are designated as accountable officials. Each
         month, the approving official will review and approve, via the Bank’s electronic access
         system, each of their cardholder’s statements of account. The approving official is
         responsible for ensuring that established dollar amounts are not exceeded and all
         transactions are appropriate, given the duties of the cardholders and the mission of the
         unit. As an accountable official the approving official, via the Bank’s electronic access
         system or by hand, must execute the following certification statement.

Figure A2.2. Approving Official Statement (as Accountable Official).


Approving Official Statement (as Accountable Official)               Date: _____________


I certify that the items listed herein are correct and proper for payment from the appropriation(s)
designated thereon or on supporting vouchers, and that the payment is legal, proper and correct,
except as may be noted herein or on supporting documents.

        (2) Cardholders are also designated as accountable officials and must execute the
        appropriate certification. Cardholders must ensure purchases are authorized in
        accordance with guidance contained in this AFI. The cardholder’s responsibility
        includes, as a minimum, reconciling their electronic statement of accounts with
        supporting documents not later than 3 work days after the end of the billing cycle. The
        Cardholder must review the entire statement for accuracy, comparing each transaction
        with those recorded in the electronic transaction management log. In addition, a
        cardholder as an accountable official, must execute the following certification statement
        via the Bank’s electronic access system or by hand.

        (3) At the discretion of the installation commander or director of the activity, A/OPCs,
        resource advisors, automated information system administrators or other officials may
        be identified as accountable officials to the extent they provide data to support the
        Certifying Officer’s certification. If identified by the installation commander or activity
        director, the Certifying Officer shall designate each individual, in writing, and the
        individual shall provide appropriate accountable official certifications to the Certifying
        Officer.
