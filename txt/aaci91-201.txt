                                           Chapter 1

                SAFETY RESPONSIBILITIES, PLANNING AND REVIEW

1.1. Responsibilities. This instruction applies to all activities conducted through the Air
Armament Center (AAC) including, but not limited to, test and training operations. The term
“test” as it relates to the safety review process includes both test and training operations
conducted through the Air Armament Center. Responsibilities of organizations involved in the
AAC test safety review process are as follows:
     1.1.1. The 46 TW or other Responsible Test Organization (RTO) or Participating Test

        or other published safety document(s).
        1.1.1.3. The 46 TW programming engineer will include the following statement in each
        Statement of Capability (SOC):
"AAC Safety Review: The proposed test/activity must be reviewed using the procedures
contained in AACI 91-201, AAC Test Safety Review Process. To support this review,
safety planning must begin early in the program."
     1.1.2. For airborne tests, the 46th Operations Group (46 OG) or other test agency using the
     AAC facilities will assign primary test aircrew members who will:
        1.1.2.1. Assist the TE in preparation for the RMB, to include completing AAC Form
        154, Test Hazard Analysis Worksheet (THAW), (Attachment 3), as appropriate for
        presentation at the RMB.
        1.1.2.2. Attend and participate in the RMB.
        1.1.2.3. Attend and participate in the Airborne Test Review/Safety Board (ATR/SB).
        1.1.2.4. Ensure that applicable hazards and minimizing procedures identified in the
        Safety Appendix to the TD, and applicable ATR/SB stipulations, are included in the
        aircrew checklist and are addressed during aircrew preflight brief.
     1.1.3. The Director of Safety (AAC/SE) will:
        1.1.3.1. Provide guidance and assistance to project personnel on test safety planning
        matters.

        1.1.4.1. Provide a Range Safety Engineer who will act as chairperson for the RMB and
        as the primary Range Safety Officer (RSO) for the program/activity.
AACI91-201 7 MARCH 2011                                                                         5


       1.1.4.2. Document the minutes of the RMB (if required) in the format of a Risk
       Management Board Summary (RMBS) (Attachment 2) which may include pertinent
       AAC Form 154s. The form is generated by test team members (refer to Chapter 4) and
       is available at https://thaws.eglin.af.mil. Instructions for the form are included as
       Attachment 3.
       1.1.4.3. Maintain a database (https://thaws.eglin.af.mil) of THAWs (AAC Form 154).
       1.1.4.4. Maintain a database of lessons learned.
   1.1.5. For Air Force munitions the Chief of Systems Safety (AAC/SES) will provide a
   systems safety engineer who will:
       1.1.5.1. Be a member of the RMB and be knowledgeable on the system or munitions that
       are being tested or used in training.
       1.1.5.2. Provide a design safety certification statement to the RMB for the system(s)
       and/or munition(s) being tested or used for training.
1.2. Safety Planning. Safety planning and technical planning are integral and iterative
processes. Technical issues should be handled with consideration of safety to personnel, aircraft,
facilities and test equipment. The earlier safety planning is incorporated into the technical test
planning cycles, the more likely an on-time, productive and safe test will occur.
1.3. Test Safety Review Process and Operational Risk Management (ORM). The AAC Test
Safety Review Process described in this instruction implements the Operational Risk
Management process as specified in AFI 90-901 for all AAC test programs, and reflects the
practical application of ORM as outlined in AFPAM 90-902, Operational Risk Management
(ORM Guidelines and Tools). The steps in the ORM process as they relate to the Test Safety
Review Process in this instruction are:
   1.3.1. Identify the Hazards. All personnel involved with the test should act as a team to
   identify hazards associated with the test. Suggested ways of accomplishing this are:
       1.3.1.1. Contact other personnel with experience in similar activities or testing.
       1.3.1.2. Review the AAC Range Safety THAW database.
       1.3.1.3. Review contractor system safety plans/analyses and range safety data package.
       Refer to AAC/SES Technical Munitions System Safety reports, Munitions Safety
       Analysis and Non-Nuclear Munitions Safety Board Minutes.
       1.3.1.4. Identify potentially hazardous activities early in the test planning process and
       ensure test methodologies which minimize the risks from those hazards are developed
       consistent with accomplishing the objectives of the test.
   1.3.2. Assess the Risk. Residual risk is the probability and severity of loss from exposure to
   the hazard after all risk mitigation procedures is considered. Chapter 3 provides guidance
   on risk assessment.
   1.3.3. Analyze Risk Control Measures. Investigate specific strategies and tools that
   reduce, mitigate or eliminate the risk. For the AAC Test Safety Review Process, these
   strategies and tools are referred to as “minimizing procedures.” Effective control measures
6                                                                    AACI91-201 7 MARCH 2011


    reduce or eliminate one of the three components of risk (probability, severity or exposure).
    Chapter 4 describes the Risk Management Board and the process of risk control analysis.
       1.3.3.1. Eliminate or minimize hazards in the following order of precedence:
           1.3.3.1.1. Design the system to reduce or preferably eliminate the probability of the
           hazard.
           1.3.3.1.2. Change the test methodology to reduce probability of, severity or exposure
           to the hazard. An example of this is the use of build-up procedures.
           1.3.3.1.3. Incorporate safety devices such as flight termination systems, safe/arm
           devices, etc.
           1.3.3.1.4. Provide caution and warning devices to detect an unsafe condition or trend.
           1.3.3.1.5. Develop minimizing procedures, training and/or emergency procedures to
           reduce risk when it is impractical to change design, change methodology, or
           incorporate safety devices.
           1.3.3.1.6. Terminate or cancel the test or test point. Reject the risk if the overall
           costs of the risk exceed its benefits.
           1.3.3.1.7. Accept residual risk, which is risk that has not been eliminated or mitigated
           by the various safety requirements.
    1.3.4. Make Control Decisions. Decision-makers at the appropriate level approve the best
    risk control or combination of controls based on the analysis of overall costs and benefits.
    After controls to minimize risk have been selected, the level of residual risk (low, medium or
    high) is determined and appropriate action taken. Decision makers can approve the plan as
    is, reject the plan (and risk) entirely, direct modification of the plan to further control risk or
    elevate the decision (and acceptance of risk) to a higher authority. Chapter 2 outlines test
    safety approval authorities and procedures. Chapter 5 provides guidance on the ATR/SB
    and control decision process for airborne tests.
    1.3.5. Implement Risk Controls. Once procedures to minimize identified hazards have
    been determined and approved at the appropriate level, those procedures must be
    implemented during the conduct of the test. Incorporation of TD Safety Appendix
    requirements and ATR/SB stipulations into planning, briefing and conducting test and
    training activities is critical to risk control implementation.
    1.3.6. Supervise and Review. The Operational Risk Management process continues
    throughout the accomplishment of every test program. Once controls are in place, the
    process must be periodically reevaluated to ensure control effectiveness.
       1.3.6.1. If previously unidentified hazards are encountered, established minimizing
       procedures are determined to be ineffective or the scope or approved procedures of the
       test are changed, execution of the affected phases of the test plan will terminate and not
       continue until the Test Safety Review Process established in this instruction is re-
       accomplished.
       1.3.6.2. Test Team Feedback. Safety lessons learned should be captured for
       incorporation into a safety database to provide guidance for future test planning.

                                            Chapter 2

             TEST SAFETY APPROVAL AUTHORITIES AND PROCEDURES

2.1. Risk Levels. All operations conducted through AAC will undergo a safety review that will
result in a test/test point risk level assessment of either low, medium or high. In many cases it is
a single data point or one small portion of a test that may be assessed as being medium or high
risk. It is only this point or points that must go through the approval and notification cycles
detailed below. Chapter 3 discusses the process that determines this risk level. Risk level
definitions are as follows:
     2.1.1. Low Risk. Tests or activities that present no greater risk than that associated with
     normal operations. Routine supervision is appropriate.
     2.1.2. Medium Risk. Tests or activities that present a greater risk to personnel, equipment
     and/or property than that associated with normal operations even after all precautionary
     measures have been taken.
     2.1.3. High Risk. Tests or activities that present a significant risk to personnel, equipment
     and/or property even after all precautionary measures have been taken.
2.2. Approval Authorities and Notification Levels. All tests need appropriate higher
management review, approval and notification before execution. Table 2.1 Summarizes the
safety approval authority and notification requirements. Approval is defined as permission to
conduct or participate in the test program, granted by the appropriate authority based on risk
level. Notification is simply a mandatory advisory to the appropriate authority that a previously
approved test or test point will soon be executed. Notification is generally given by the test
engineer/test manager the day prior to execution. AAC agency tests include operations
conducted by agencies assigned to the AAC such as the 46 TW or 46 TG at Holloman AFB NM.
Flight tests that involve AAC as the RTO, involve AAC-possessed aircraft, or involve aircrew
assigned to AAC are also categorized as AAC agency tests. Non-AAC agency tests include
operations conducted on the AAC complex by range users not affiliated with the AAC.
Examples of non-AAC agencies are the 53d Test Wing, 1st Special Operations Wing, Air Force
Research Laboratory, US Navy, US Army, foreign military, etc.
2.3. High Risk Training and Test Procedures.
     2.3.1. The 46 TW/CC or test agency will brief the AAC/CC on all testing identified as high
     risk. The AAC/CC must approve the execution of all high-risk test events.
     2.3.2. High-risk test missions involving aircraft safety of flight using AAC aircraft or
     aircrews normally require test pilots as the aircrew members. When test pilots are not
     required for such missions, the 46 TW/CC will document the procedures and the justification
     for not using test pilots.

                                 RISK LEVEL ASSESSMENT

3.1. Risk. Risk is an expression of the possibility of a mishap in terms of hazard category and
hazard probability.
3.2. Hazard Categories. Hazard categories are designed to provide a qualitative measure of the
severity of the worst credible mishap resulting from personnel error; environmental conditions;
design inadequacies; procedural deficiencies; or system, subsystem or component failure or
malfunction. For activities at the AAC, hazard categories are shown in Table 3.1.

Table 3.1. Hazard Categories.

 Table 3.1. Hazard Categories.

 Description                  Mishap Definition (per AFI 91-204)

Catastrophic                  Loss of life, aircraft, or expensive and unique system. Loss >
                              $2,000,000 (e.g. Aircraft Class A).

 Critical                     Severe injury, lengthy hospital stay, permanent injury. Severe
                              aircraft, equipment or property damage. Loss >$500,000 but
                              <$2,000,000 (e.g. Aircraft Class B).

 Marginal                     Minor injury, medical treatment, but no permanent injury. Minor
                              damage. Loss >$50,000 but <$500,000.

 Negligible                   Superficial injury, little or no first aid required. Very minor
                              damage.

3.3. Hazard Probability. The likelihood that a hazardous event may actually occur is a
significant factor in risk assessment. Unfortunately it can be the most difficult to quantify. This
requires subjective analysis and judgment. Probabilities may be expressed in non-numeric
(qualitative) terms, such as frequent, occasional, or impossible; or in numeric (quantitative)
terms such as once in 10,000 flights. For operations where there is a well-developed database or
some complex model, probabilities may be expressed in terms like 1 x 10-4, 3.8 x 10-6, etc. For
development testing, operations, and training it is virtually impossible to compute with any
confidence the numeric values of the failure probabilities. The nature of these activities does not
allow for it. The only metric available is subjective analysis based on engineering judgments
and/or past experiences with similar tests or systems. For activities at the AAC, hazard
probabilities are shown in Table 3.2.
 12                                                                  AACI91-201 7 MARCH 2011

 High                   Very likely to occur during the course of the test, aircraft maneuver, or
                        other activity. We've done this (or something similar) before and had a
                        mishap or very nearly did. The test exceeds the design limits. Multiple
                        single point failures are possible.

 Probable               Likely to occur during the course of the test, aircraft maneuver, or other
                        activity. We've done this (or something similar) before and came close
                        to a mishap. The test is at the design limit. At least one single point
                        failure is possible.

 Uncertain              Some likelihood to occur, but not expected. We're not sure but we don't
                        think it's too critical. We've never done this before and have identified
 (Occasional)
                        some areas of concern. The test is nearing the design limits.

 Remote                 Unlikely to occur. We've done this (or something similar) and not had a
                        problem. Well within the design limits; no single point failures.

 Improbable             Not a factor.


3.4 Risk Assessment. The combination of risk category and probabilities can be arranged in a
matrix as shown in Figure 3.1. This is the matrix on AAC Form 154 discussed in Chapter 4.
The matrix contains three areas; namely, a crosshatched area, a shaded area and an open area.
On the Risk Assessment Matrix the crosshatched area is the undesired area - high risk; the
shaded area is the marginal area - medium risk; and the open area is the normal area - low risk.
Each test point or test activity will be assigned a risk level in one of these three areas after taking
into account the minimizing/emergency procedures. The correlation of approval authorities with
the assigned risk level is discussed in Chapter 2. The use of the matrix defined in Figure 3.1
and the Test Safety Review Process defined in this instruction is approved in accordance with
AFI 91-202, AFMC Sup 1, Chapter 13, The US Air Force Mishap Prevention Program.

                           RISK MANAGEMENT BOARD (RMB)

4.1. Purpose. The Risk Management Board provides a forum for assessing the risk associated
with test activities as detailed in a 46TW Test Directive. The RMB will make a recommended
risk assessment for each identified test unique hazard as well as an overall test risk assessment.
The activities will be approved at the appropriate level based on this risk assessment IAW
Chapter 2 of this instruction.
4.2. Board Criteria. A risk assessment will be made for all activities conducted through the Air
Armament Center. At the discretion of AAC/SEU, an RMB may be convened and will designate
tests or test points for an appropriate risk level.
4.3. Board Objectives. The objective of the RMB is to:
   4.3.1. Ensure the hazards associated with the test have been properly identified.
   4.3.2. Ensure processes eliminate, mitigate, or minimize the potential hazards that can or
   will result from the test to an acceptable level.
   4.3.3. Establish an appropriate risk level for the test.
   4.3.4. Provide a consolidated safety input to the Airborne Test Review/Safety Board
   (ATR/SB) for airborne tests using AAC aircraft or aircrews.
   4.3.5. Ensure that any test through AAC will be accomplished with all due respect to the
   safety of the public, aircrew, activity participants and facilities involved.
   4.3.6. Provide the forum by which the AAC customers, AAC/SE, 46 OG/CC, 46 TW/CC
   and the AAC/CC are assured the test will be conducted as safely as possible.
4.4. Schedule. The RMB will be scheduled after the RTO or PTO has completed the technical
evaluation of the Method of Test or Concept of Operations. The RMB should be held as late in
the planning cycle as possible. Any changes in the Method of Test after the RMB has been
completed could result in the requirement to re-accomplish the Test Safety Review Process and
may result in another RMB and/or ATR/SB. A typical RMB timeline is shown in Table 4.1.
This schedule will vary depending on test complexity, test safety issues, urgency, etc.
Streamlined test planning guidance is contained in AAC Plan 70, Crisis/Command Directed
Rapid Response Testing. Reconvening the RMB or ATR/SB will be done at the discretion of the
RMB or ATR/SB chairman.

     unique hazard.
  4.6.7. Test Pilot or Aircrew Member: Test aircrews need to be involved with test programs
  from program inception. Aircrew inputs need to be made throughout the method of test
  development process. In conjunction with the test engineer, the test aircrew is required as
  needed to develop THAWs (AAC Form 154) by identifying test-unique hazards, determining
  causes and effects, and developing minimizing procedures. The THAW should be completed
  by the test engineer and test aircrew and delivered to Range Safety prior to the RMB per
  Table 4.1. The test aircrew and/or test engineer will brief these THAWs at the RMB.
     4.6.7.1. Review the Method of Test to ensure that all aircraft performance requirements
     are within the design capabilities of the aircraft.
     4.6.7.2. Ensure the test is conducted in accordance with current Air Force, AAC, 46 TW
     and/or other applicable instructions.
     4.6.7.3. For any test points near, at or exceeding the aircraft envelope, identify any
     hazards and develop minimizing procedures to be presented at the RMB.
     4.6.7.4. Advise the RMB on any flight requirements that exceed the aircraft design limits
     or may put the aircraft/aircrew in a hazardous situation.
     4.6.7.5. For store release missions, ensure all pre-launch switch settings can be
     completed within the test area. If not, identify to the RMB any hazards that may be
     associated with switch settings.
     4.6.7.6. Discuss hung ordnance procedures, if applicable. Where local standard hung
     ordnance procedures are not appropriate, develop, coordinate and brief alternative
     procedures for the specific program.
20                                                                   AACI91-201 7 MARCH 2011


        4.6.7.7. Identify any condition unique to the proposed test profiles (for example:
        weather, bird strike, low altitude flight) that may put the aircraft and aircrew in an
        elevated risk situation. Present the appropriate minimizing procedures to the RMB.
     4.6.8. Air Force SEEK EAGLE Office (AFSEO) Representative.
        4.6.8.1. Provide the RMB with draft or approved documentation generated in support of
        the planned testing, recommended flight clearance, risk assessment, engineering letter, or

        with the planned test (if generated by AFSEO – either as a 46 SK engineering product or
        as the representative of an external 46 TW customer).
        4.6.8.3. Provide a store separation assessment for each ejection, release, dispense, or
        launch of a store or system. The store separation assessment should also be accompanied
        by relevant aircraft loads assessment (e.g. dynamic response, kick-back forces), as
        necessary.
        4.6.8.4. Provide safe escape/safe separation analysis for live weapon releases/launches.
        Identify any hazards associated with safe escape/safe separation for the parent or chase
        aircraft as requested by AAC/SEU.
        4.6.8.5. Identify any potential hazards associated with maneuvering with the test
        aircraft/store configuration (aircraft loads, store loads, aircraft flutter, aircraft handling).
        4.6.8.6. Provide inputs to AAC Form 154 for each identified hazard in the area of their
        expertise, as required.
     4.6.9. EOD Representative (96 CES/CESD):
        4.6.9.1. Provide the RMB with explosive operations expertise.
        4.6.9.2. Identify any hazards associated with the disposal or recovery of unspent, dud or
        misfired munitions.

        4.6.10.1. Provide the RMB with bioenvironmental expertise.
        4.6.10.2. Identify any health hazards associated with radiation exposure including, but
        not limited to, ionizing radiation, radio frequency (RF) radiation, laser radiation, and
        microwave radiation.
AACI91-201 7 MARCH 2011                                                                     21

       4.6.10.7. Provide inputs to AAC Form 154 for each identified bioenvironmental hazard,
       as required.
4.7. RMB Agenda. The RMB is fundamentally an ORM/risk mitigation effort. The RMB is
neither a pre-ATR/SB (Chapter 5) nor a test planning meeting. The RMB can be in any form
that effectively communicates test-related information to the members of the RMB. In a typical
RMB, the test engineer will brief the planned systems under test; test objectives, test design,
procedures, and any preliminarily identified test-unique hazards to the board. The RMB briefing
should address, at a minimum, the following topics to a level of detail which supports a risk
assessment.
   4.7.1. System(s) Description.
   4.7.2. Test Background. Test Requester
          Purpose
          Scope
          Timeline
          Resources Involved, etc.
   4.7.3. Test Objectives.
   4.7.4. General Method of Test.
          Data Collection
          Facilities
          Personnel
          Ranges
          Flight Profiles
          Agencies Involved
   4.7.5. Any Special Requirements.
   4.7.6. Mission Summaries & Highlights. Test design (if necessary)
          Test approach precedence/justification
          Analogous systems/tests
          Supporting analysis
          Inherent risk mitigation
 22                                                                   AACI91-201 7 MARCH 2011


            Adopted risk mitigation
      4.7.7. Test Specific Hazards.
   4.7.8. Test Hazard Analysis Worksheets.
   4.7.9. Conclusion.
4.8. RMB Discussion. After the briefing, the RMB chairperson will lead a discussion to review
whether hazards have been adequately identified and addressed. The RMB chairperson will also
attempt to discern any other potential test-unique hazards or safety problems. This discussion
will emphasize the following areas of concern:
      4.8.1. General Questions.
   4.8.2. Review existing THAWs (AAC Forms 154).
            Test-unique hazards
            Adequate/appropriate minimizing procedures
            Adequate emergency procedures
            Any added comments
   4.8.3. Complete newly generated THAWs as necessary.
   4.8.4. Consider any additional risk mitigation that could reasonably be applied.
   4.8.5. Assign Risk Levels. Use risk level assessment procedure outlined in Chapter 3.
   4.8.6. Summarize.
             Any open action items
             Risk levels associated with individual test parameters
             Exact wording of any restrictions placed on the test
             Reasons for restrictions and risk categories
             Other items discussed that will appear in the Risk Management Board Summary or
             Safety Appendix
4.9. RMB Documentation. RMB documentation typically consists of three parts - the Safety
Appendix, Risk Management Board Summary (RMBS), and THAWs (AAC Form 154). A
Safety Appendix to a Test Directive may not be required, as determined by AAC/SEU, if no test-
unique hazards and/or minimizing procedures are required and the risk level is assessed as low.
If a formal RMB was not convened, as determined by AAC/SEU, an RMBS will not be included
in the RMB documentation. THAWs (AAC Form 154) are included in the RMB documentation
only as needed.
   4.9.1. Safety Appendix. The Safety Appendix shall contain the identified hazard(s),
   minimizing procedure(s), and risk assessment(s) consolidated from the Test Safety Review
   Process. Typically, the minimizing procedures developed from the RMB and/or THAWs
   (AAC Form 154) are consolidated and published in the Safety Appendix to the Test Directive
   as “Safety Requirements”. Attachments to the Safety Appendix may include the RMBS,
   THAWs (AAC Form 154) or other related documents. It also may contain other essential
AACI91-201 7 MARCH 2011                                                                            23


  range safety criteria such as approved test areas, test items, danger areas, safety
  instrumentation requirements, etc. The Safety Appendix format is shown in Attachment 1,
  which supersedes the format previously detailed in AACI 99-102, AAC Test & Evaluation
  Workload Acceptance, Coordination, & Documentation. Final approval of the Safety
  Appendix resides with the Director of Safety or a designated representative.
  4.9.2. Risk Management Board Summary (RMBS). An RMBS documents the results of
  the RMB and will, as a general rule, contain a list of attendees, brief background material, a
  Design Safety Certification statement (provided by AAC/SES), a mishap accountability
  statement, safety footprint development methodology, and notes of all the topics that were
  discussed. The RMBS should also include a discussion of items that were discussed and
  determined not to be a hazard as well as those identified as hazards. The RMBS format is
  shown in Attachment 2. Final approval of RMBS resides with the Chief of Range Safety or
  a designated representative.
  4.9.3. Test Hazard Analysis Worksheet (THAW). A THAW (AAC Form 154) is a tool
  designed to facilitate the discussion of test-unique hazards, their causes and effects, and
  minimizing and emergency procedures; provides a vehicle for the RMB to assign risk levels;
  and presents a platform for creating a historical database. The THAW is not a directive
  document requiring the procedures defined on the worksheet to be followed; those
  requirements will be detailed in the Safety Appendix. The test engineer and test aircrew will
  ensure the worksheets are completed and delivered to the range safety engineer prior to the
  RMB. Each THAW addresses a single hazard but may include multiple causes, minimizing
  procedures, emergency procedures and comments. The RMB will assign a risk level to each
  hazard; any additional THAWs resulting from the Board’s discussions will be generated and
  included in the RMB documentation. The following instructions provide guidance on
  completing THAWs (Attachment 3 contains additional information):
     4.9.3.1. Enter test title, Job Order Number (JON) number, RMB date and aircraft/system
     in the appropriate blocks.
     4.9.3.2. Define the Hazard. Any condition that has the potential for causing a mishap
     or accident is considered to be a hazard. For example, exceeding design limits on a wing
     is a potential hazard in a flutter program. It is the condition that will lead to loss of life or
     aircraft. List only one hazard per worksheet. While hazard identification should have
     been accomplished leading up to the RMB, emphasis should be placed on identifying
     items of special interest for THAW consideration including, but not limited to:
24                                                                  AACI91-201 7 MARCH 2011


 New systems or system variants: aircraft, stores, instrumentation, test equipment
 Unique and/or unprecedented systems not previously used in the test environment: aircraft,
 stores, instrumentation, test equipment
 Expansion of development systems to new user groups/test teams:
 Unfamiliar procedures
 Transitions of responsibility
 Modifications to established procedures or test resources
 Unproven or seldom used test methods
 Unfamiliar/unproven supporting analytical techniques
 First-time test events:
 For the system (e.g. aircraft, aircraft component, store) under test
 For the specific system configuration, or combination of systems, (e.g. aircraft loadout,
 electronic subsystem combination) under test
 Testing to address changes in systems under test, whether due to:
 Pre-planned upgrades
 Modifications resulting from deficiencies indentified by inspection/review
 Corrective actions addressing failures in previous related tests
 Test approaches with a history of associated failures/problems
 Systems/subsystems/components with a history of associated failures/problems
 Additional research and/or analysis
 Test range restrictions (location, weather, additional resources)
 Test point/phase changes (reorder points, insert/complete phase, etc.)
 Test point specific requirements (additional requirements for elevated risk test points)
 Familiarization or additional training
 Aircrew restrictions (experience level, qualifications, number aboard, required equipment,
 etc.)
 Aircraft restrictions (capabilities or equipment that would simplify/enhance test conduct)


         4.9.3.2.1. Confirm the hazard is test unique. Do not address hazards generic to
         flying or operating support equipment. These are well-defined events that may be of
         elevated risk, but have already been addressed in existing instructions, standard
         operating procedures, etc. However, if the test increases the probability of the hazard
         occurring, then it will become a test-unique hazard. Some examples:
AACI91-201 7 MARCH 2011                                                                         25



  Bird strikes are not generally considered to be a test-unique hazard. But if, during the
  execution of a test, flight through a known bird-roosting area is necessary, then “bird strikes”
  would be a test-unique hazard.
  Heavy equipment operations are not generally considered to be a test-unique hazard. But if
  during the execution of a test, a novel aircraft loading method is proposed using non-standard
  heavy equipment, then “heavy equipment operation” would be a test-unique hazard.
  Mid-air collision is not generally considered to be a test-unique hazard. But if during the
  execution of a test, safety/photo chase requirements could potentially increase the likelihood
  of proximity or relative translation at periods when the aircrew could be distracted while
  executing other tasks, then “chase aircraft collision” would be a test-unique hazard.
  It may be difficult to tell just when a standard parameter or action becomes test-specific.
  Some good indications would be:
  If the test includes events that could be characterized as a system demonstration, system
  variant, or system combination for the first time.
  If the test includes demonstrating systems at conditions outside the bounds of previous
  demonstrations.
  If the test involves significantly modifying standard procedures.
  If personnel unfamiliar with the test were to conduct the test and needed or wanted a briefing
  to better understand the associated hazards.
  If a nominal hazard probability is increased because of the nature of the test.


      4.9.3.3. Identify the Causes. The cause is the situation or circumstance that could lead
      to the presence of the hazard. For example, encountering flutter without a timely abort
      could cause design limits to be exceeded. Minimizing procedures will reduce the
      probability of occurrence. Although each worksheet addresses only one hazard, it may
      include multiple causes.
      4.9.3.4. Describe the Effects. The effect is the mishap or accident we are trying to
      avoid. The loss of a pilot/aircraft is an example of an effect.
      4.9.3.5. List Minimizing Procedures. Minimizing procedures will normally affect the
      "Subjective Probability of Occurrence" (Chapter 3) on the THAW. A flutter test that
      went directly to a predicted flutter condition with no precautions would likely be assessed
      as "HIGH" or "PROBABLE" in “Subjective Probability of Occurrence.” Minimizing
      procedures can reduce that probability, thereby reducing the overall risk of the test point.
      In the case of flutter, there would be a number of minimizing procedures. Some might
      be: "Real time strip charts and radio contact capability required," "Build-up points will be
      flown to validate predictions;" "Knock-it-offs will be repeated by the test pilot and
      transmitted on guard by the chase pilot if the test pilot doesn't respond." Minimizing
      procedures can also affect “Hazard Category” (severity). For example, training pilots in
      simulators to better prepare them in the event the hazard occurs would reduce severity.
 26                                                               AACI91-201 7 MARCH 2011


       4.9.3.6. List Emergency Procedures. Emergency procedures should be test specific
       and not addressed in the flight manual. In our imaginary flutter test, such a procedure
       might include an emergency abort maneuver such as speed brakes, idle power and
       reducing G loading. However, it needs not address the controllability check (an
       emergency procedure addressed in the aircraft flight manual) required after a flutter-
       induced over-G.
       4.9.3.7. Provide Comments. Comments can be attached to the worksheet at any point
       up through the ATR/SB. Comments broaden the worksheet's scope, providing insight
       into the hazard’s risk assessment.
       4.9.3.8. Taking all entered information into consideration, check the appropriate block in
       the Risk Level Assessment matrix in the upper right corner of the worksheet. This
       defines the overall risk level (low, medium or high) for the identified hazard. Any test or
       training point/event subject to this hazard would then be identified as low, medium or
       high risk as appropriate.
       4.9.3.9. Enter submitter’s name/organization and date at the bottom of the worksheet.
4.10. Assigning Risk Level. The risk level for the test or any specific test point will be assigned
by the RMB as a whole as outlined in Chapter 3. Acceptance of the test with the RMB assigned
risk level will be IAW Table 2.1.
AACI91-201 7 MARCH 2011                                                                          27

                 AIRBORNE TEST REVIEW/SAFETY BOARD (ATR/SB)

5.1. Purpose. The ATR/SB is established to provide a management level review of airborne
test safety. The ATR/SB is the forum where control decisions are made and the residual risk
level identified at the RMB is accepted, rejected, minimized further or elevated to a higher
authority for a decision. This review is accomplished prior to beginning a flight test program by
a board of members highly qualified in their respective fields. The ATR/SB approves a flight
test or recommends approval only when all hazards have been reviewed, satisfactory planning
and analysis have been conducted, and procedures have been established to allow
accomplishment of the test with a reasonable expectation of safe conduct. The ATR/SB does not
provide or approve airworthiness certification, flight clearances, design safety certification, or
test safety criteria (for example, impact footprints). These certifications must be obtained from
appropriate sources and reviewed and approved at the RMB, which occurs prior to scheduling
the ATR/SB. The ATR/SB is authorized to establish additional test limitations or restrictions
when required. For 46 TG tests, the ATR/SB is referred to as a Safety Review Board (SRB) and
is conducted for medium/high risk ground tests as well as all flight tests. In this instruction, the
term "ATR/SB" includes the 46 TG's SRB as well.
5.2. Board Review Criteria. The ATR/SB will review all flight tests, for which AAC is the
RTO, tests that involve AAC-possessed aircraft or flight by aircrews assigned to AAC, or when
ATR/SB review is otherwise requested. The 46 OG/CC or 46 TG/CC may request an ATR/SB
review of non-AAC agency flight tests. Questions regarding review criteria should be referred to
the ATR/SB recorder. The 46 OG will conduct ATR/SBs for tests for which it is RTO, and the
46 TG will conduct SRBs for tests for which it is RTO, regardless of ownership of the aircraft,
aircrew, other test resources and the range airspace in which the test is conducted.
5.3. Board Structure.
   5.3.1. The ATR/SB members are appointed by the 46 TW/CC or the 46 TG/CC. The 46
   OG/CC is the ATR/SB president. In his absence, a designated alternate, who must be a rated
   officer, must be present and will preside at ATR/SB meetings. At least one AAC/SE
   representative, a recorder and all available members will also attend each meeting. The
   ATR/SB president can direct attendance by particular members as circumstances dictate.
   5.3.2. The ATR/SB (SRB) structure at Holloman AFB is governed by 46 TGI 91-1.
   5.3.3. Contractor/system project office (SPO) personnel may attend the ATR/SB at the
   invitation of the test engineer.
5.4. Responsibilities/Authority.
   5.4.1. The 46 TW/CC is the reviewing authority for ATR/SB actions.
   5.4.2. The ATR/SB president will:
       5.4.2.1. Designate ATR/SB members for approval by 46 TW/CC.
       5.4.2.2. Preside at ATR/SB meetings, or if unable to attend, ensure that a designated
       alternate presides. If an alternate presides over the ATR/SB meeting, the president will
       remain responsible for reviewing all ATR/SB documentation before test approval. The
28                                                                AACI91-201 7 MARCH 2011


        president may grant verbal approval when time constraints require. The ATR/SB
        briefing outline in Attachment 4 will be used as a guide when verbal approval is
        required. ATR/SB documentation will be sent to the president as soon as possible after
        verbal approval. Final approval will be documented by endorsement to the ATR/SB
        minutes. If the president is not available, the designated alternate may grant approval on
        a case-by-case basis.
        5.4.2.3. Direct that any mission disapproved by the ATR/SB not be flown until
        discrepancies are resolved and approved by the ATR/SB.
  5.4.3. The ATR/SB president has the authority to perform the following actions, which will
  be documented by letter, if appropriate, with copies sent to concerned agencies.
        5.4.3.1. Provide for the routine administration of the ATR/SB to include obtaining 46
        TW/CC approval of the ATR/SB membership.
        5.4.3.2. Approve minor changes to active tests within the general limits previously
        approved by the ATR/SB. These changes will be coordinated with AAC/SE. The format
        in Attachment 5 will be used to request approval of such changes.
        5.4.3.3. Impose specific test restrictions such as data review at intermediate steps in a
        sequence.
     5.4.4. The ATR/SB members will attend and participate in ATR/SB meetings.
  5.4.5. The ATR/SB recorder will:
        5.4.5.1. Schedule tests to be reviewed at the weekly ATR/SB meetings.
        5.4.5.2. Arrange nonscheduled board meetings as directed by the president.
        5.4.5.3. Act as recorder at ATR/SB meetings, or if unable to attend, ensure that a
        designated alternate acts as recorder. The recorder will conduct the meeting, verify
        security clearances of personnel attending when necessary and record the minutes of the
        meeting.
        5.4.5.4. Provide the minutes of the ATR/SB meetings for 46 OG/CC approval.
        5.4.5.5. File documentation in the test central file folder, which is maintained by the
        recorder. This documentation will include ATR/SB meeting minutes, the briefing outline
        with all applicable attachments and a copy of the briefing slides used. Information copies
        of the above items will be sent to 46 TG/CC for those tests conducted at Holloman AFB.
        5.4.5.6. Send a copy of the ATR/SB minutes and briefing outline with attachments to the
        46 TW/CC.
        5.4.5.7. Accomplish all necessary administrative actions associated with ATR/SB
        activities.
     5.4.6. The 46 TW Programming Engineer will:
        5.4.6.1. Include either the statement "ATR/SB action is required" or the statement
        "ATR/SB action is not required" in the TD based on criteria in paragraph 5.2.
        5.4.6.2. Inform the ATR/SB recorder when approved tests which have been suspended or
        terminated are reactivated under a different JON.
AACI91-201 7 MARCH 2011                                                                       29


  5.4.7. The Test Engineer/Manager who requires ATR/SB review action will:
     5.4.7.1. Request the ATR/SB. The format in Attachment 6 will be used to request the
     ATR/SB. Send the request to the ATR/SB recorder so it is received no later than 5
     workdays before the requested ATR/SB date to allow adequate notification of ATR/SB
     members and briefers. This may be sent by e-mail or on letterhead. Missions may be
     scheduled prior to the ATR/SB but will not be accomplished until the ATR/SB has been
     completed.
     5.4.7.2. Make sure the following actions are completed before the ATR/SB, if they apply
     to the test:
        5.4.7.2.1. AAC/SE RMB and the TD Safety Appendix.
        5.4.7.2.2. Flight Clearance.
        5.4.7.2.3. AAC Configuration Control Board (CCB) Review.
        5.4.7.2.4. Munitions, maintenance and aircrew checklist preparation.              If
        hardware/munitions are not available, these checklists may be completed after an
        ATR/SB has convened. The board will stipulate that the checklists will be completed
        prior to the first flight.
        5.4.7.2.5. All applicable personnel (contractor, test pilot/chief pilot, maintenance,
        etc) have been contacted and agree on the requirements that must be met to allow the
        test aircraft/asset to fly chase or training missions. Refer to Attachment 7 for a guide
        to determine the specific requirements.
     5.4.7.3. Prepare and document an ATR/SB briefing using the format in Attachment 4.
     Provide supporting documents to the ATR/SB recorder so that they are received no later
     than 2 workdays before the ATR/SB. Documents should include either four paper
     copies, one electronic file or a link to the network location of the electronic file of each
     document. Required documents include:
        5.4.7.3.1. ATR/SB briefing outline.
        5.4.7.3.2. Aircraft systems group (SG) or AFSEO recommended flight clearance (if
        applicable).
        5.4.7.3.3. Flight profiles.
        5.4.7.3.4. AAC/SE TD Safety Appendix.
        5.4.7.3.5. Modification flight manual supplement for test items that are designated

        checklists that have been certified by the appropriate aircrew designated in the 46 OG
        Personnel Qualification Roster.
        5.4.7.3.7. Form letter (see Attachment 9) outlining requirements that must be met to
        allow the test aircraft/asset to fly chase or training missions. This letter should
        include any additional restrictions required. After ATR/SB approval, this letter will
        be signed by the ATR/SB president and distributed with the minutes.
30                                                                  AACI91-201 7 MARCH 2011


        5.4.7.4. Present the briefing to the ATR/SB with the assistance of the test aircrew
        member and representative(s) of any appropriate Engineering Organization (e.g. an
        AFSEO compatibility engineer briefing on specific compatibility test plans and
        justification), if required.
     5.4.8. The AAC/SE representative(s) will:
        5.4.8.1. Assist the test engineer in accomplishing safety-related tasks in preparation for
        ATR/SB review.
        5.4.8.2. Support the ATR/SB and be knowledgeable of the safety aspects of each test
        reviewed.
     5.4.9. The Test Aircrew member will:
        5.4.9.1. Act as the test coordinator in preparing a test for ATR/SB review if a test
        engineer/coordinator has not been assigned.
        5.4.9.2. Assist the test engineer in preparing the ATR/SB briefing and the aircrew
        checklist. The test aircrew member will be responsible for completing the method of test
        portion of the ATR/SB briefing outline and ensuring that it is a thorough and accurate
        review of the test.
        5.4.9.3. Brief the operational aspects of the test to the ATR/SB.
        5.4.9.4. Ensure the planned flight profiles (e.g. Compatibility Flight Profile (CFP), flutter
        matrix), discrete test data points, and overall mission flight requirements (e.g. chase
        aircraft, aerial refueling, range support aircraft, range requirements) are reviewed by the
        appropriate aircraft test director and qualified pilot, presented at the ATR/SB, and
        reviewed again by the operations supervisor prior to flight. Test data points (incremental
        buildup to test endpoints), datapoint parameter tolerances including over-speed
        provisions, Go/No-Go criteria, and abort procedures will be established and briefed to the
        ATR/SB.
     5.4.10. The Engineering Organization (e.g. AFSEO) will:
        5.4.10.1. Provide representatives to ATR/SB meetings who are familiar with specific
        flight clearance aspects for each test in review.
        5.4.10.2. Brief the background and basis for the test design to the ATR/SB. This portion
        of the briefing will include, but is not necessarily limited to, the aircraft's anticipated
        flying qualities, flutter speed, store separation characteristics, limiting load factors and
        waivers to MIL-STD-1289. The flight clearance for CFP missions will specifically
        address the appropriate buildup test points and anticipated flying qualities when data or
        analysis indicate degraded stability or control characteristics.
  5.4.11. The 46 OG/CC will process requests for ATR/SB action for tests at Holloman AFB
  involving resources at Eglin and Holloman. The ATR/SB will convene at Eglin.
  5.4.12. All personnel involved in the AAC mission will immediately notify the test engineer
  or any ATR/SB member of any test hazards that occur. The test engineer will in turn notify
  the ATR/SB and AAC/SE.
AACI91-201 7 MARCH 2011                                                                             31


5.5. Board Review Procedures.
   5.5.1. ATR/SB test reviews are normally conducted at weekly scheduled meetings of the
   ATR/SB; however, if short notice ATR/SB action is required, the board president (or
   alternate) may authorize an unscheduled ATR/SB meeting.
   5.5.2. Although ATR/SB test review is formally structured, all participants are encouraged
   to present opinions and expertise which bear on the test being reviewed. Every effort is
   made to arrive at a consensus of opinion regarding all points discussed; however, the
   ATR/SB president decides the final ATR/SB position. Members who disagree with the
   president's decision may request that their opinions be included in the minutes.
   5.5.3. The recorder will review the proposed minutes of the meeting before it adjourns. No
   flight test missions will be flown until the ATR/SB minutes have been signed. The minutes
   will reflect one of the following:
       5.5.3.1. The test is approved, as briefed.
       5.5.3.2. The test is approved with stipulations, which will be listed in the ATR/SB
       minutes and briefed to the aircrew at each flight briefing.
       5.5.3.3. The test is disapproved pending further study, better preparation or review by the
       46 TW/CC, etc.
       5.5.3.4. Certain parts of the test are approved, but further ATR/SB review is required
       prior to approval of the remaining parts. This additional review may involve data
       analysis, aircrew workload evaluation, etc.
       5.5.3.5. The test is assessed as a low, medium, or high-risk test and ensures there is a
       valid operational requirement for all medium or high-risk test points.
       5.5.3.6. Designate weather sensitive flights.
   5.5.4. If the ATR/SB decides to recommend approval of a high-risk test, the 46 OG/CC will
   brief the 46 TW/CC and AAC/CC on all hazardous aspects of the tests. Primary emphasis
   will be on the development and refinement of detailed procedures necessary to ensure a safe,
   successful mission. High-risk test missions will not be conducted without the approval of
   AAC/CC.
       5.5.4.1. If the ATR/SB decides to recommend approval of a medium risk test, test
       mission sorties containing medium risk test points will not be flown without approval of
       the 46 OG/CC. The 46 TW/CC will be notified as required in paragraph 2.4.2.
   5.5.5. When the board president signs the minutes, Attachment 9 "Sample Restriction for
   Test Aircraft" will also be signed outlining the requirements that must be met to allow the
   test aircraft/asset to fly chase or training missions. If changes to the letter are needed, the test
   engineer will make the required changes and ensure the letter is signed prior to the first test
   mission.
5.6. Review of Test Changes. If a change is made to any of the items requiring ATR/SB
approval after a test has been reviewed by the ATR/SB, (listed in paragraph 7 of Attachment 5),
the test engineer/coordinator must request RMB review and ATR/SB approval of the changes.
This may be accomplished by reconvening the RMB and ATR/SB, or by direct approval by the
ATR/SB president for minor changes within the general limits previously approved by the
 32                                                               AACI91-201 7 MARCH 2011


ATR/SB. A letter in the format shown in Attachment 6 will be prepared and forwarded to the
RMB president and the ATR/SB recorder to reflect changes. Before the letter is forwarded, the
test aircrew member will initial after his or her name in paragraph 2, signifying coordination with
the engineer on the changes. The Test Engineer will coordinate with the RMB and ATR/SB
presidents to determine if another RMB and ATR/SB is warranted, or the RMB and ATR/SB
presidents may approve the change by endorsement.
5.7. Informal ATR/SB.
   5.7.1. An informal ATR/SB is an ATR/SB meeting which, for unusual circumstances, is
   held at other than the normal scheduled ATR/SB weekly meeting and is attended by only a
   limited number of members. Examples of the types of tests which may be reviewed by an
   informal ATR/SB are:
       5.7.1.1. A classified test where the need-to-know is restricted to a limited number of
       individuals.
       5.7.1.2. A test which falls under a test directive intended for use on a recurring basis by
       other test programs, when the original test directive has been reviewed by the ATR/SB.
       An example of such a test is drone chase support at Holloman AFB.
   5.7.2. Attendance at an informal ATR/SB will be dictated by circumstances of the test. As a
   minimum, the ATR/SB president or designated alternate, a representative from AAC/SE, the
   test engineer, the test aircrew member and a recorder must be present. The test aircrew
   member may act as the recorder for the informal ATR/SB if test classification requirements
   restrict a designated recorder from attending.
   5.7.3. Minutes from an informal ATR/SB meeting will be prepared and approved as for a
   normal ATR/SB review.
5.8. Prescribed and Adopted Forms.
   5.8.1. Forms Prescribed.
          No Forms Prescribed
   5.8.2. Forms Adopted.
          AAC Form 154, Test Hazard Analysis Worksheet (THAW).

AAC FORM 154, TEST HAZARD ANALYSIS WORKSHEET (THAW)
GENERAL. The Test Hazard Analysis Worksheet (THAW) is designed to reduce RMB meeting
times by providing a concise way to become familiar with your test. The lower section of the
worksheet is designed to be filled out prior to the RMB-usually by the test engineer. Risk levels
will be assigned during the RMB. Each form should address a single hazard, although it may
contain any number of causes, effects, minimizing procedures and emergency procedures.
Please do not address unquestionably “Low Risk” hazards that require no minimizing procedures
or hazards intrinsic to aircraft or basic equipment operation.
“HAZARD” is defined as something TEST UNIQUE. It’s a CONDITION that has the
potential to cause a mishap or an accident resulting in an unfavorable end to the test. For
example, a hazard might be the early, unintended detonation of a test munitions.
“CAUSE” is defined as the CIRCUMSTANCES or SITUATION that lead to the hazard’s
occurrence. For example, early detonation might be caused by the proximity of heavy
equipment or a chase plane.
“EFFECT” is defined as the MISHAP or ACCIDENT that we are trying to avoid. The
EFFECT will determine the HAZARD CATEGORY as defined below. In our running
example, the effect might be the loss of equipment, airplane or lives.
“MINIMIZING PROCEDURES” are the things you do to prevent the hazard from occurring.
For instance, you may specify a minimum clearance distance from the munitions.
“EMERGENCY PROCEDURES” are test specific and fairly self-explanatory. Not all
hazards will have appropriate emergency procedures.
“COMMENTS” are made by anyone who wishes to record thoughts or considerations: the
RMB, Safety, ATR/SB, etc.
RISK LEVEL ASSESSMENT. The risk level is assessed by breaking the hazard into two parts:
How much damage might result, and how probable it may be. The amount of damage is
categorized according to EFFECT and is fairly straightforward. The probability of occurrence is
highly subjective and may be difficult to agree upon. The guidelines below may be of some
help.
HAZARD CATEGORY.
CATASTROPHIC: Loss of life, aircraft, or expensive and unique system. Loss >
$2,000,000 (e.g. Aircraft Class A).
CRITICAL: Severe injury, lengthy hospital stay, permanent injury. Severe aircraft,
equipment or property damage. Loss > $500,000 but < $2,000,000 (e.g. Aircraft Class B).
MARGINAL: Minor injury, medical treatment but no permanent injury. Minor damage.
Loss > $50,000 but < $500,000.
NEGLIGIBLE: Superficial injury, little or no first aide. Very minor damage.
SUBJECTIVE PROBABILITY OF OCCURRENCE.
 38                                                              AACI91-201 7 MARCH 2011


HIGH: We’ve done this before (or something very similar) and had a mishap, or very nearly
did. The test will exceed design limits. There are multiple single points of failure.
PROBABLE: We’ve done this before (or something similar) and came close to a mishap.
The test is at the design limit. There is at least one single point of failure.
UNCERTAIN: We’re not sure, but we don’t think it’s too critical. We’ve never done this
before and have identified some areas of concern. The test is nearing the design envelope.
REMOTE: We’ve done this before (or something similar) and not had a problem. Well
within design limits. No single points of failure.
IMPROBABLE: There just isn’t a problem. Heart of the envelope. Nothing has ever gone
wrong. Several failures required to have any serious consequences.

a. New, unfamiliar, or modifications to existing test aircraft participating in the test, including
those performing chase duties. (Be prepared to provide relevant detailed descriptions of new or
unfamiliar platforms, supported by aircrew representatives. Briefly describe modifications to
existing test aircraft.)
b. External/internal stores or aircraft/store configurations. (Be prepared to provide relevant
detailed descriptions of new or extensively modified stores, supported by appropriate
engineering representatives. Briefly describe derivative modifications to existing stores
associated with the test. Characterize the relevance of new aircraft/store combinations on
aircraft/store compatibility.)
c. Flight clearance limits. (List the recommended flight limits that may be approached. Ensure
overspeed authorization is included in flight clearance, if necessary.)

aircraft/asset to fly chase or training missions. Include any and all applicable restrictions.)
4. METHOD OF TEST. Describe the test missions that will be flown in sufficient detail to
allow the ATR/SB to assess the associated risks. Use the following objective-oriented format, or
any other appropriate format which covers the following information. Paragraphs 4a through 4f
may be briefed separately for each general objective, or briefed only once, as is most appropriate.
Figures, drawings or tables are encouraged to clarify flight parameters, procedures or profiles.
a. Objective. Describe the test objectives in sufficient detail to evaluate the method of test. If
possible, keep the objectives unclassified.
b. Test Procedure. Describe how the objective will be accomplished. If unusual hazards are
involved in satisfying this objective, provide the ATR/SB with the justification for accepting the
unusual risk (such as no other way to collect required data). This section should include the
following:
(1) Flight parameters. If appropriate, a matrix of flight parameters for various missions may be
constructed. Indicate altitude lost for all dive maneuvers. If a compatibility flight is to be flown,
a flight envelope diagram showing the sequence of test points is required. For flutter missions,
maximum asymmetry and gross weight configurations are required.
(2) Aircrew actions in the cockpit which may affect test safety (such as aircrew workload).
(3) Instrumentation or data tolerance requirements that could exacerbate the accomplishment of
test points.
(4) Associated flight requirements (e.g. range clearing, aerial refueling) or additional requested
aircrew actions requested in addition to primary test (collecting wind profiles, accomplishing
level accelerations, etc.)
(5) Safety/photo chase requirements, including exactly what the chase will be required to
monitor or observe positioning requirements, data/observation requirements, and specific
procedures required post-release.
(6) Formation procedures. Include minimum spacing for specific formation for chase.
AACI91-201 7 MARCH 2011                                                                            41


(7) Specify hung/unexpended ordnance procedures.
(8) Post-flight procedures. Are any special armament safing procedures required? For
aircraft/store compatibility evaluations, is post-flight non-destructive inspection of the store
required?

off, continuation of active mission, or progression to subsequent missions.
c. Profiles. Describe the flight profiles that will be used - either standard or AAC Form 4lllA,
Land Range Profile, or other similar forms, if available. Ensure information required by AACI
13-204, Mission Scheduling and Control, is specified. For non-Eglin profiles, show route of
flight.
d. Operational and Safety Limitations. Describe all operational and safety limitations that are in
addition to, or more restrictive than, existing applicable regulations. These restrictions should
include all restrictions contained in the Safety Appendix.
(1) Weather requirements: Takeoff and landing minimums; test area weather minimums and
recommend weather sensitive or not. Requirements for store releases through weather must be
specifically addressed.
(2) Maneuvering restrictions: Maximum dive angle, minimum altitude, etc.

presented in paragraph 4 may be omitted from this section.
7. SPECIFIC AREAS/CONDITIONS REQUIRING ATR/SB APPROVAL. The purpose of the
ATR/SB is to review flight test safety for tests which meet established review criteria.
a. If AAC is the RTO for the flight test being reviewed, the ATR/SB must approve the following
items:
(1) Method of flight-test.
(2) Carriage of non-jettisonable stores. However, ATR/SB approval is not required if the
appropriate flight manual lists the store (that is a "standard" store) and describes the jettison
status as "not authorized" or "not established."
(3) Waivers to deviate from the requirements of AAC directives.
(4) Profiles.
(5) Operational and safety restrictions and special procedures.
(6) Dedicated crews.
(7) Requirements/restrictions or test aircraft/test asset to fly chase or training mission.
(8) Other appropriate items peculiar to the test being reviewed.
b. If AAC owned aircraft or assigned aircrews are involved in the test but AAC is not the RTO,
the ATR/SB must approve those parts of items a (1) through (7) above that affect AAC aircraft
or aircrews.
8. ATTACHMENTS. Attach the following documents to the ATR/SB briefing outline, if they
exist:
a. Flight clearance.
b. Approved profiles.
c. Aircrew general checklist.
d. AAC Test Directive Safety Appendix.
e. Modification flight manual supplement for mods.
f. Requirements/restrictions for training/chase flights with test asset requirements.

                             CHECKLIST FOR DETERMINING

REQUIREMENTS/RESTRICTIONS FOR CHASE OR TRAINING MISSIONS
The test engineer should use this checklist to determine the specific requirements that must be
met to allow the test aircraft/asset to fly chase or training missions. The test engineer must begin
early in planning to determine these requirements because our limited resources dictate that we
be as flexible as possible. They should discuss these issues with the customer, contractor, project
pilot and anybody else with a vested interest in the test articles.
The test engineer can use this guide to determine what is required and what restrictions apply.
They can use this information to draft the letter that pertains to these requirements and
restrictions for approval at the ATR/SB.
1. Software: Is there unique test software involved (avionics or flight controls)? Can aircraft be
flown on chase and/or training missions with this software loaded? If not, can it be flown after
the software is proven safe after a few flights? How many and what kind of flights? Are there
any additional restrictions (day/VMC only, air-to-air only, etc)?
2. Pods, Munitions or Suspension Equipment: What pods, munitions or suspension equipment
must be downloaded before the aircraft can be flown on a chase or training mission?
3. Additional Restrictions: Are there any other restrictions in addition to the flight clearance
restrictions? Are there any configurations requiring special pilot knowledge or qualifications? If
so, what are the configurations and qualifications required?
4. Mission Restrictions: Are there any specific missions that cannot be flown (weapon delivery,
BFM, etc)?
5. Lifting of Restriction: Can any restrictions be lifted after testing has begun? If so, which
restrictions? What tests or how many flights must be accomplished prior to lifting those
restrictions?
