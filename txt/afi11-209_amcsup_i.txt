(AMC) This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. This
revision reorganized the format of chapters and paragraphs for increased understanding. This
supplement introduces the concept of an AMC “air show culture” with supporting, foundational
concepts, the AMC policy for aviation support and the Wing Aviation Support Program (para
1.1). It adjusts the tasking mechanism to support aerial events to incorporate 618 TACC/XOBL
(paras 1.1.6, 2.4.4.1, 2.6, 3.5.1.1, 4.2.3, 5.10.5, and 5.105.1). It categorizes flyovers, aerial
reviews and aerial demonstrations as “aerial performances” (para 1.4). It introduces a
classification schema for aviation support (Figure 1). It re-establishes a 500’ AGL minimum
altitude for USAFA flyovers (para 1.6.3.2). It provides flyover guidance when spectator areas
are established (para 1.6.7). It addresses Non-Standard Aerial Events (1.10.1). It discusses the
roles of Joint Airborne/Air Transportability Training (JA/ATT) missions, Transportation
Working Capital Fund (TWCF) missions and Special Assignment Airlift Missions (SAAM) in
aviation support (para 2.4.4). It presents guidance for tailoring and approving flight profiles for
aerial performances (para 2.4.7). It provides guidance for aerial performances in the National
Capital Region (NCR) (para 2.6.1). It redefines the AMC “ground supervisor” as the AMC
“ground coordinator,” outlining specific duties (para 2.7). It authorizes air refueling
demonstrations, and provides basic procedures (para 4.4.8). It provides detailed guidance for
requesting participation approval for aviation support proposals (para 4.6). It outlines
procedures for aerial performances at the USAFA (para 5.1). It clarifies participation approval
procedures for AF parachute team performances (para 5.4). It updates the Participation
Approval Matrix at Attachment 2. It identifies AMC/A3 as participation approval authority for
off-base static displays, in lieu of wing commanders, and for aviation support provided to events
approved IAW Exception-to-Policy procedures (Attachment 2). It provides detailed guidance
for AMC static display aircraft (Attachment 4) and incorporates “Make-Safe” procedures for
DS-equipped aircraft used as static displays or in aerial performances (Attachment 5). It
expands guidance on the Operational Risk Management (ORM) process, clarifying its use in
assessing aggregate risk for an aerial performance (Attachment 6). It clarifies the procedures for
requesting aviation support and expands the guidelines for gaining participation approval for
aviation support, referring users to the Project Officer’s Guide (POG) on the AMC/A3O web
page (Attachment 9). Finally, it develops the concept of the wing-level “Aviation Support
Program” (Attachment 10).

                                   GENERAL GUIDANCE

1.1. General Guidance. This instruction governs the performance of USAF aviation support for
military or public events held for community relations or ceremonial purposes. It details the
procedures for event and participation approval and specifies the operational limitations of the
aviation support rendered. Air Force aerial events keep the public and military informed of
U.S. preparedness, demonstrate modern weapons systems, promote good community and
international relations, support Air Force recruiting and retention efforts and render military
honors. For additional guidance on Air Force participation in public events and community
relations programs, see AFI 35-101, Public Affairs Policies and Procedures. For additional
guidance on Air Force flyovers supporting funeral or memorial events, see AFI 34-242, Mortuary
Affairs Program. HQ USAF/A3O may task MAJCOMs to provide assets to participate in certain
key public or military events.
1.1. (AMC) General Guidance.Air Force provides aviation support for more public or military
events world-wide than any other single organization—AMC’s contribution is enormous.
Aviation support significantly impacts the public’s perception of both the Air Force and AMC.
This perception must be cast in a positive light. To this end, the Command will cultivate an “air
show culture” at the grass roots level—every wing plays a role. Ideally, this air show culture
will influence the positive thinking and behavior of our men and women involved in our aviation
support, grooming them to be the command’s “air show” envoys to a global population. Our
envoys must be knowledgeable in Air Force and AMC history, and in air operations. They must
be articulate spokespersons with exceptional military bearing. They must be highly mission-
capable, at all times exercising common sense, sound judgment and safety consciousness.
Finally, they must have a genuine appreciation for “showmanship,” an aspect of aviation support
that we cannot afford to overlook. Our envoys are to shape the public’s perception of the Air
Force and AMC. Two command initiatives underpin our air show culture: 1) the command
policy on aviation support; and, 2) the wing aviation support programs.
   1.1.1. (Added-AMC) AMC Policy On Aviation Support. The command’s policy on
   aviation support is comprised of these tenets: 1) to never compromise the safety of spectators
   or our airmen, or the security of command equipment; 2) to send only competent,
   knowledgeable, articulate, polished, and professional airmen to represent the command; 3) to
   showcase our capabilities by aggressively seeking opportunities to support military and
   public events, worldwide; 4) to provide aviation support to the extent operational
   commitments and resources permit while maintaining good stewardship of the nation’s
   assets; 5) to display only equipment impeccably prepared; and finally, 6) to allocate aviation
   support equitably among competing event sponsors.
   1.1.2. (Added-AMC) Wing Aviation Support Program. Each WG/CC will establish an
   Aviation Support Program uniquely tailored to the wing’s mission and personnel—this
   program, coupled with the command’s policy for aviation support, is to buttress AMC’s air
   show culture. AMC/A3V will provide headquarters oversight through the Aircrew
   Standardization Evaluation Visit (ASEV) program (Administrative and Manning).
   Guidelines for the wing’s aviation support program are at Attachment 10, this supplement.
8                                                   AFI11-209_AMCSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2009


    1.1.3. (Added-AMC) This supplement presents the basic guidance governing AMC
    aviation support provided to military or public events. For additional operational guidance,
    see AFI 11-2MDS, Volumes 1-3, among other sources listed in AFI 11-209. AMC event
    sponsorship is addressed in AFI 10-1004, Conducting Air Force Open Houses.
    1.1.4. (Added-AMC) Aviation support should not interfere with wing operational
    commitments. As a general rule, aviation support is flown on a voluntary basis with
    operational costs paid from the wings’ O&M budgets for flying training—on rare occasions,
    funding may be otherwise sourced (POC AMC/A3OO). See para 2.4.4, this supplement.
    1.1.5. (Added-AMC) 618 TACC/XOBL may task wings to provide aviation support,
    normally at the request of Headquarters Air Force (HAF), for certain key public or military
    events, in particular, for international air and trade exhibitions (see para 2.4.4. and 5.10.5.,
    this supplement). If Active Duty forces are unable to support HAF requests, 618 TACC may
    request ARC volunteer support (see para 5.10.5.1, this supplement).
    1.1.6. (Added-AMC) The expression WG/CC, by convention in this supplement, includes
    AMC commanders of airlift and tanker groups not associated with a parent wing. AMC
    GP/CCs must ensure that planned aviation support for on-station military or public events is
    fully coordinated with their host-wing leadership prior to execution.
1.2. Public Event. Public events are community relations events not connected with the
military functioning of the Department of Defense and intended primarily for non-military
audiences. Some examples include military Open House events, ceremonies, exhibitions,
expositions, athletic contests, parades, tattoos, fairs, airshows, international airshow and trade
exhibitions, or similar programs. These events may be onor off-base; continental United States
(CONUS) or outside of the continental United States (OCONUS). Public events can be
sponsored by either DoD or non-DoD organizations. Such events can be good community
relations and recruiting opportunities. Military exercises, movements, maneuvers, or operations
are not considered public events merely on the basis of being incidentally observed by the
general public.
1.3. Military Event. A military event is an official DoD event, sponsored by the DoD, a DoD
Component, or a command conducted in support of an assigned mission, including purposes of
esprit de corps, primarily for military personnel, civil service personnel, dependents, and limited
guests. The event must be hosted on a facility owned, leased or operated by the DoD. In the
event a judgment needs to be made on whether an event is a military or public event, contact
SAF/PAN who will assist in the determination.
1.4. Aviation support (For Public and Military Events). Aviation support for public and
military events include static displays, flyovers, aerial reviews, and aerial demonstrations — these
activities are also referred to as aerial events.
1.4. (AMC) Aviation support (For Public and Military Events).AMC “aviation support”
consists of static displays and aerial performances. Aerial performance—a subset of aviation
support—includes flyover, aerial review and aerial demonstration. Static display, flyover, aerial
review and aerial demonstration are “aerial events.”
AFI11-209_AMCSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2009                                                                 9


Figure 1.1. (Added-AMC) Classification of AMC Aviation Support.




   1.4.1. Static Display. Static display, a subset of aviation support, is the ground display of
   military aircraft and related equipment not involving taxiing or starting of engines while
   spectators are in the display area.
   1.4.2. Flyover. Flyover, a subset of aviation support, is a straight and level flight by a single
   military aircraft or by a formation of four or fewer military aircraft of the same type (see
10                                                  AFI11-209_AMCSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2009


     Attachment 1 for definition of type) from the same Military Service over a predetermined
     point on the ground at a specific time and not involving aerobatics or demonstrations;
     however, bank angles of up to 90 degrees are permissible and may be used if required to
     improve the visibility of the aircraft to the spectators. A single event will be supported with
     a single flyover only (IAW DoDD 5410.18)—this restriction does not apply to public
     airshows or to military open house events. For multiple flyovers and multiple passes, see
     Attachment 1. Flyovers of public events in support of community relations activities may
     only be flown as adjuncts to approved training missions.
        1.4.2.1. An approved funeral or memorial service may be supported with the missing
        man formation (see paragraph 3.6.2.4 and 4.2.3).
        1.4.2.2. Dissimilar Formation Flyover. A dissimilar formation is a single-element
        formation of four or fewer aircraft of multiple Mission Design Series (MDS) of the same
        type (see Attachment 1for definition of type) from the same Military Service. A
        dissimilar formation flyover is not to be confused with an aerial review. An example of a
        dissimilar formation would be a two-, three-, or four-ship formation involving F-16s
        and F-15s. Formations involving variants of an MDS, for example a formation of F-
        16A, F-16C, F-16D fighters, is not considered dissimilar. A dissimilar formation flyover
        should be undertaken only with applicable consideration given to safety, to the
        compatible flying characteristics of the aircraft involved, and to the overall theme of the
        event that is being supported.
     1.4.3. Aerial Review. Aerial review, a subset of aviation support, is a flyover of more than
     four aircraft, or of multiple types (see Attachment 1 for definition) of aircraft, or of
     aircraft representing more than one Military Service or Nation, regardless of horizontal and
     timing separation of flying elements. It may have elements in trail formation and will not
     involve precision maneuvers or demonstrations. The elements of the aerial review may be
     individual aircraft, formations, or a combination of individual aircraft and formations.
        1.4.3.1. Aerial reviews are reserved only for the most meaningful national or
        international occasions and shall not be performed at CONUS public events without
        approval by OASD/PA. OCONUS approval will comply with COCOM directives.
        1.4.3.2. Multiple Aerial Events Supporting a Single Public Event. From the public
        affairs perspective an aerial review flown for a given event constitutes a significant AF
        statement of support; so too does performing multiple aerial events in combination for a
        single public event. To ensure an appropriate level of scrutiny and approval, the
        performing of multiple aerial events (for example, multiple flyovers) in combination for
        a single public event requires event and participation approval levels comparable to
        aerial review approval levels. This criterion applies to the following:
            1.4.3.2.1. Multiple flyovers at the same event, regardless of timing separation
            between the flyover aircraft or formations.
            1.4.3.2.2. The combination of an Air Force Parachute Team (AFPT) airdrop and a
            flyover at a single event. NOTE: As distinctly diverse assets, this combination will
            not be performed at public events without approval by SAF/PAN and HQ
            USAF/A3O.
AFI11-209_AMCSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2009                                                              11


       1.4.3.3. The definition of aerial review does not apply to the Air Force vintage aircraft
       program (Heritage/Texan Flights), unless flown in conjunction with other assets outside
       of the vintage aircraft program.
   1.4.4. Aerial Demonstrations. Aerial demonstration, a subset of aviation support, includes
   virtually every type of aerial participation by fixed-wing or rotary-wing aircraft in public
   or military events (except aerial review and flyover). See Attachment 1 for a list of example
   activities that meet the definition of Aerial Demonstrations. Aerial demonstration is
   synonymous with the phrases aerial demo, aircraft demonstration (demo), aircraft
   capabilities demonstration (demo), and aircraft capabilities exercise (CAPEX). The AFI
   11-246, Air Force Aircraft Demonstrations, series specify policy for aerial demonstrations
   (to include demonstration teams), demonstration profiles for certain aircraft and the
   procedures for non-standard profile approval. Training events incidentally observed by the
   general public are not considered to be aerial demonstrations. See paragraphs 3.6.4 and 4.4
   for specific procedures on aerial demonstration approval.
NOTE: Guidance in paragraphs 1.4.1. through 1.4.4. is not intended to limit aviation support
at public airshows or military Open House events — these events may be supported with
multiple static displays, multiple flyovers (with multiple passes) and multiple aerial
demonstrations, all approved IAW the normal procedures in this instruction for event and
participation approval. Additionally, multiple aerial events supporting two or more separate
events at a single geographic location in a single day can be authorized IAW the normal
procedures in this instruction (for example: a flyover for a USAFA graduation ceremony and a
funeral flyover at the USAFA cemetery, both at approximately the same time). Each event
must stand on its own, and be completely independent (limitations specified in paragraph 1.4.2.
apply to each separate event).
1.5. Approvals. Aviation support at public and military events requires both a determination
of event approval from Public Affairs and participation approval from Operations. This
instruction outlines the required levels of approval (event and participation) for aerial events
at public or military events. For some events, eligibility has been predetermined by Public
Affairs and requires only Operations participation approval; see Chapter 3 for specific event
approval requirements and Chapter 4 for specific participation approval requirements. USAF
aviation support not described in this instruction but planned for a public or military event must
receive MAJCOM, HQ USAF/A3O, and SAF/PA approval before the performance. For events
outside of the United States, Canada and Mexico, approval will comply with COCOM
directives and paragraphs 5.9 through 5.10.
1.5. (AMC) Approvals. AMC aviation support planned for public or military events requires
both “event approval” from Public Affairs and “participation approval” from Operations—see
AFI 11-209, Chapter 3 (event approval) and Chapter 4 (participation approval). Attachment 2,
this supplement, summarizes the required levels of approval applicable to AMC. For some
events, eligibility has been predetermined by Public Affairs and requires only Operations
participation approval. USAF aviation support not described in this instruction, but planned for
a public or military event, must receive AMC/A3, HQ USAF/A3O, and SAF/PA approval before
conducting the performance. Wing commanders may approve participation in events for their
wing-assigned aircraft as posted in Attachment 2, this supplement. For events outside of the
United States, Canada and Mexico, approval will comply with COCOM directives and AFI 11-
209, para 5.9. through 5.10.
12                                                   AFI11-209_AMCSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2009


     1.5.1. (Added-AMC) Records Management.             Units are to keep records of their
     participation in military or public events for a period of one year. When participation is
     approved at the WG/CC level, the unit POC will provide an information copy of the approval
     documents prior to event execution to AMC/A3OO IAW Attachment 2, NOTE 24, this
     supplement.
1.6. Operational Criteria. Safety must be the prime consideration at all times. Do not engage
in activities that compromise the safety of spectators or that could damage or destroy property.
Participation by any air refueling aircraft in a flyover or aerial review shall not be conducted
with the receiver closer than the precontact position.
1.6. (AMC) Operational Criteria.Safety is the first and primary consideration in the
command’s Policy for Aviation Support—do not engage in flying activities that compromise the
safety of spectators and airmen, or that could damage or destroy an aircraft or other assets.
When planning your aerial performances, “keep it simple,” then execute your plan. While
airborne avoid changing your planned flight profile to execute any unplanned maneuvers
requested on-the-spot by the “Air Boss” or other controlling agency, unless the request is a
safety of flight or air traffic control issue—common sense and sound judgment must prevail.
For guidance on aerial performances involving an air refueling aircraft and receiver, see para
4.4.8, this supplement.
NOTE: The Thunderbirds Demonstration Team, MAJCOM Single Ship Demonstration Teams,
aviation record setting flights, and USAF vintage aircraft programs (such as the Heritage Flight
Texan Flight programs) will use operational criteria provided in their own approved Air Force
or MAJCOM instructions; all other Air Force aircraft participating in aerial events will use the
criteria presented in this paragraph.
     1.6.1. Showmanship and Professionalism. Aerial events have many objectives among
     which are to entertain the spectators and to inform the general public on Air Force
     capabilities. In planning and performing aerial events, supervisors, pilots, aircrew
     members and all other participants should remember the objective is to demonstrate Air
     Force professionalism and competence to the general public. Strict compliance with show
     lines, flying procedures, and minimum altitude restrictions reflect a high degree of
     professionalism and contribute markedly to great showmanship.
     1.6.2. Weather Minimums. Weather must allow operations under Visual Flight Rules (VFR)
     in accordance with AFI 11-202, Volume 3, General Flight Rules, and applicable AFI 11-
     2MDS, Volume 3, MDS Specific Operations Procedures. Weather minimums are “flyover
     minimum altitude” plus 500 feet and 3 miles visibility. The MAJCOM or mission
     commander may set higher minimums based on the nature of the event, local terrain, or other
     factors.
     1.6.2. (AMC) Weather Minimums. WG/CCs may set higher weather minimums than the
     minimum altitudes specified in AFI 11-209, para 1.6.2. for assigned aircrews executing
     aerial performances.
     1.6.3. Altitude Minimums. The minimum altitudes published in AFI 11-202 and in Federal
     Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations for congested and non-congested areas apply. If
     the venue for an event is on a riverbank with a show line or flyover ground track over water
     or over the opposite bank, treat this location for a flyover as a congested area since spectators
AFI11-209_AMCSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2009                                                               13


  can congregate on both sides of the river. If the venue for an event is on the shore of the
  ocean, large bay, or large lake with a show line or flyover ground track over the open water,
  treat this location for a flyover as a non-congested area.
  1.6.3. (AMC) Altitude Minimums. WG/CCs can set higher minimum altitudes than the
  minimum altitudes specified in AFI 11-209, para 1.6.3, and supplemental paragraphs, for
  assigned aircrews executing aerial performances.
     1.6.3.1. USAF Minimum Altitudes. In certain cases, such as demonstration team
     performances, approved maneuver packages, and entry and exit into flyover areas, the
     FAA may specifically waive the altitude requirements below. Even if the FAA
     authorizes a lower altitude, USAF controlled aircraft must not be flown lower than the
     following minimum altitudes:
         1.6.3.1.1. 500 feet AGL for fixed-wing aircraft.
         1.6.3.1.2. MAJCOMs are authorized to establish altitudes lower than the minimums
         specified in paragraph 1.6.3.1.1 for operating rotary wing aircraft in the execution of
         approved aircraft demonstration profiles, when the lower altitudes are necessary to
         properly demonstrate capabilities. Each MAJCOM sets minimum altitudes for the
         safe operation of their assets.
     1.6.3.2. (Added-AMC) Minimum Altitude—Flyover/Congested Area. The minimum
     altitude for a flyover performed in a congested area by an AMC aircraft, or AMC aircraft
     formation (based on the altitude of the lowest aircraft in the formation), is 1,000 feet
     above the highest obstacle within 2,000 feet of the aircraft. Notwithstanding, AMC
     flyovers of congested areas at the USAF Academy may be flown at lower altitudes
     subject to the guidance in para 5.1.4, this supplement.
     1.6.3.3. (Added-AMC) Minimum Altitude—Flyover/Non-Congested Area.                        The
     minimum altitude for a flyover performed in a non-congested area (or over open water or
     in sparsely populated areas) by an AMC aircraft, or by an AMC aircraft formation, is 500
     feet AGL. For such flyovers, AMC aircrews will not operate an AMC aircraft closer
     than 500 feet to any person, vehicle, vessel or structure. The minimum altitude for an
     AMC flyover performed over an active runway, i.e., performed directly over and aligned
     with the longitudinal centerline, at a military or civil airfield hosting an approved event is
     500’ AGL.
     1.6.3.4. (Added-AMC) Minimum Altitude—Aerial Demonstration. The minimum
     altitudes for the operation of AMC aircraft performing aerial demonstrations are posted
     in the Standard Profiles in AFI 11-246, Vol 6, and the AMC CONOPS to AFI 11-246,
     Vol 6.
     1.6.3.5. (Added-AMC) Minimum Altitude—Aerial Review. The minimum altitude for
     AMC aircraft participating in an aerial review is 1,000’ above the highest obstacle within
     2,000 feet of the aircraft, except when the aerial review is performed over an active
     runway, i.e., directly over and aligned with the longitudinal centerline, at a military or
     civil airfield. In such situations, the aircrew can descend in order to pass over the runway
     at 500’ AGL if approved by the Aerial Control Team chief, mission commander or other
     controlling agency.
14                                                    AFI11-209_AMCSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2009


     1.6.4. Airspeed Limitations. Airspeed guidance in AFI 11-202, Volume 3 applies to all
     aerial events. The minimum airspeed for the operation of any fixed wing AF aircraft
     participating in any military or civilian event is stall speed plus 30 percent for the aircraft
     configuration. Airlift aircraft used in demonstrating standard, approved tactical procedures
     such as assault takeoffs or assault landings, may be flown at lower airspeeds, but not at
     airspeeds lower than specified in technical order publications. Maximum airspeed is
     limited to .90 MACH, or a lower airspeed if stipulated in a governing FAA waiver, for all
     aerial demonstrations except for approved record flights and demonstration teams.
     Demonstration teams will use a maximum speed of .95 MACH. FAA waiver may be
     required for airspeeds above 250kts below 10,000 MSL.
     1.6.4. (AMC) Airspeed Limitations. AMC fixed wing aircraft performing any aerial
     performance for public or military events are limited to a minimum airspeed of stall speed
     plus 30 percent, or minimum maneuvering airspeed, for the aircraft configuration.
     Maximum airspeed is 250 KIAS. AFI 11-246, Vol 6, and the AMC CONOPS for AFI 11-
     246, Vol 6, specify the minimum airspeeds applicable to AMC aircraft performing aerial
     demonstrations.
     1.6.5. Time Limitations. Due to safety concerns and reduced public relations benefit, aerial
     events are authorized only between the beginning of Morning Civil Twilight and the end of
     Evening Civil Twilight. The USAF Academy Wings of Blue parachute team is authorized
     an exception to this policy provided a FAA waiver (FAA Form 7711-2, Certificate of
     Waiver or Authorization Application) is obtained for each night jump in accordance
     with 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 105.21.
     1.6.6. Communications. Aerial Control Teams (ACT) and on-site ground supervisors should
     use discrete radio frequencies to control aviation assets.
     1.6.7. Spectator Area. The event organizer for aerial demonstrations must set up a
     designated spectator area safely separated from the area over which the aerial
     demonstrations will occur—safety is always a primary consideration in selecting the
     spectator area and in establishing the show line for flight operations. Official observers
     and spectators must stay within their designated area. Aircraft conducting demonstrations
     at military or civilian events will not over-fly the designated spectator area unless specifically
     granted a waiver by FAA and the parent MAJCOM. The event organizer must ensure a
     1,500-foot minimum distance exists between the spectator area and the show line for all
     military aircraft demonstrations. Under the following circumstances, the 1,500-foot
     minimum distance can be reduced to the following:
     1.6.7. (AMC) Spectator Area. At all public or military events, for which a spectator area
     and a show line (or show lines, as defined by FAA aircraft categories) are established, AMC
     aircrews performing aerial demonstrations will operate their aircraft over the appropriate
     show line (or over a legally off-set ground track), will not overfly the spectator area and will
     not fly closer to the spectator area than the show line permits, notwithstanding any FAA
     waiver or approval to fly closer to the spectator area. Additionally, AMC aircrews will
     perform all flyovers over the show line (i.e., the show line appropriate for the FAA category
     of aircraft) at events where spectator areas and show lines are established, unless specifically
     authorized to deviate by the Air Boss or other controlling agency. If authorized to perform a
AFI11-209_AMCSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2009                                                             15


   flyover that routes the aircraft closer to the spectator area than the show line, or over the
   spectator area, follow the guidance in para 1.6.3.2 and 1.6.4, this supplement.
       1.6.7.1. To 1,200 feet between the spectator area and the show line if the FAA grants
       such a waiver and if the parent MAJCOM approves.
       1.6.7.2. To 1,000 feet between the spectator area and the show line for T-6 Texan II
       demonstrations.
       1.6.7.3. To 1,000 feet between the spectator area and the intended airdrop impact point or
       the drop zone boundary (whichever is greater) for the following tactical airdrop
       demonstrations:
          1.6.7.3.1. Equipment
          1.6.7.3.2. Container Delivery System
          1.6.7.3.3. Personnel using round canopies
       1.6.7.4. To 500 feet between the spectator area and the show line for a helicopter
       operational demonstration and for fixed-wing assault landing or assault takeoff
       demonstrations.
       1.6.7.5. To 500 feet between the spectator area and the show line for USAF vintage
       aircraft programs.
       1.6.7.6. To 500 feet between the spectator area and the show line for glider aerial
       demonstrations; notwithstanding, only 200 feet is required between spectators and
       glider aircraft during takeoff and 75 feet during landing.
       1.6.7.7. To 50 feet between the spectator area and the landing target for the airdrop of
       precision parachute demonstration teams (for example, the Wings of Blue) when
       steerable square main and reserve canopies are used. The airdrop may include a High
       Altitude Low Opening (HALO) demonstration.
   1.6.8. (Added-AMC) Maximum Angle of Bank—Flyover / Aerial Demonstration. AMC
   aircraft are limited to a maximum angle of bank of 45 degrees for flyovers (see para 4.2, this
   supplement). AFI 11-246,Vol 6, and AMC CONOPS to AFI 11-246,Vol 6, permit bank
   angles up to 45 degrees for certain Standard Profiles.
   1.6.9. (Added-AMC) Maximum Angle of Bank—VFR Pitch-Out. WG/CCs may approve
   C-130/C-17/C-5 VFR arrival/pitchout procedures using bank angles up to 45 degrees
   maximum, IAW applicable operating instructions, for full-stop recoveries at venues where
   aviation support is being provided for a military or public event.
1.7. Compliance with Flight Procedures. For aircraft operations outside the United States,
comply with host nation air rules and procedures and with the USAF Foreign Clearance Guide.
Coordinate with host nation Air Traffic Control representatives before an over flight of a
foreign country. For air operations in the United States, comply with all FAA rules and
instructions.
1.8. Waiver Process. For situations that require waivers to FAA regulations and AF
instructions, obtain the FAA waiver before staffing the AF waiver request. Obtain the FAA
waiver and determinations on FAA policy through the local Flight Standards District Office.

1.9. Force Protection. The safety of Air Force personnel and the protection of Air Force
aircraft and equipment are paramount. Force protection measures should always be taken into
consideration, whether participating in flyovers, aerial demonstrations, and aerial reviews, or
conducting static displays. It is imperative that all Air Force members at all levels become
situationally aware of potential threats to Air Force personnel and equipment when deciding to
participate in any military or civilian event. Refer to AFMAN 31-201, Volume 3, Flight
Operations; AFI 31-101, The Air Force Installation Security Program; and AFI 10-1004,
Conducting Air Force Open Houses (when published) for force protection considerations — this
must be reviewed for applicability prior to planning a base open house.
1.10. Other Guidance. For comprehensive guidance on Air Force participation in military
and civilian events, community relations programs, and commercial activities such as air and
trade shows, see AFI 35-101, Public Affairs Policies and Procedures; AFI 34-242, Mortuary
Affairs Program; DoD Directive 5410.18, Community Relations; DoD Instruction 5410.19,
Public Affairs Community Relations Policy Implementation; DoD Directive 7230.8, Leases and
Demonstrations of DoD Equipment; and the other publications listed in Attachment 1. For
additional information, contact HQ USAF/A300 at DSN 227-5019 or SAF/PAN at DSN 225-
9664.
     1.10.1. (Added-AMC) For non-standard activity, you must advise AMC/A3O a minimum
     of five working days prior to any scheduled activity that will include media coverage or may
     attract media attention.

                                           Chapter 2

                                     RESPONSIBILITIES

2.1. Secretary of the Air Force, International Affairs (SAF/IA). International events for
which aviation support is requested or tasked must be evaluated to ensure political, military
and industry concerns are taken into consideration. This responsibility rests with SAF/IA.
Additionally, SAF/IA coordinates with Under Secretary of Defense for Policy (USD(P)),
Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA), HQ USAF/A30 and MAJCOMS for
International Airshows and Trade Exhibitions as outlined in paragraph 5.10 For international
events that are outlined in paragraph 5.9 (public affairs activities), SAF/IA coordination may be
required if there is a significant political, military or industry concern. This coordination does
not preempt or diminish the combatant commander’s authority to exercise event and
participation approval over events falling within their respective Areas of Responsibility (A0R).
2.2. Secretary of the Air Force, Public Affairs (SAF/PA). Public events for which Air Force
aviation support is requested must be evaluated to ensure their legitimacy, suitability and
appropriateness for Air Force association, involvement or participation. This responsibility rests
with SAF/PA when the venues for such events fall within the United States, Canada or
Mexico. SECAF has delegated to SAF/PA the authority to approve exceptions to flyover
policy, with HQ USAF/A30 coordination and concurrence. SAF/PA is also responsible for
coordination with 0ASD/PA and interface with requestors.
2.3. HQ USAF D irector of Current Operations and Training (HQ USAF/A3O)
Responsibilities.
   2.3.1. Waiver Requests. HQ USAF/A30 is the approval authority for waiver requests to this
   instruction, unless otherwise stated.
   2.3.2. Unique Requests. HQ USAF/A30 is the approval authority for requests not covered
   by this instruction. Submit such requests to HQ USAF/A300 for evaluation and approval,
   after obtaining MAJCOM approval. MAJCOMs will submit requests at least 45 calendar
   days before the event.
   2.3.3. Funeral Flyovers. In unique cases when a funeral flyover is authorized (IAW
   paragraph 3.6.2.3.1), HQ USAF/A30 retains authority to disapprove support if the
   circumstances of the death and subsequent flyover could reflect negatively upon the Air
   Force.
   2.3.4. Exception-to-Policy (ETP) for Flyovers. HQ USAF/A30 provides coordination and
   concurrence for SAF/PAN approved ETP flyovers and other aerial events as detailed in
   Attachment 2.
   2.3.5. Leases. HQ USAF/A30 approves participation plans at airshows involving USAF
   aircraft leased to non-government organizations, IAW AFI 64-103, Leasing USAF
   Aircraft and Related Equipment to Nongovernment Organizations. Plans should be
   submitted to HQ USAF/A30 no later than 60 days prior to the event. See AFI 64-103 for
   requirements.
2.4. MAJCOM Duties.

     2.4.1. Evaluates requests for Air Force aviation support.
     2.4.1. (AMC) HQ AMC/A3O is the command OPR for receiving/evaluating requests for
     AMC aviation support. A3O will staff packages for AMC/A3 approval, or for higher
     headquarters approval, as appropriate (AMC/A3OO is the POC for aviation support and will
     provide contact information to AF/A3OO).
     2.4.2. Coordinates with SAF/PA, SAF/IA, HQ USAF/A300 and/or other agencies, as
     required, to determine the extent of participation authorized. 0C0NUS MAJCOMS
     coordinate initially with Combatant Command. See paragraph 5.9 for overseas events that
     require HQ USAF or 0ffice of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (0ASD)/PA approval or
     coordination.
     2.4.2. (AMC) AMC/A3O is the command OPR for coordination on AMC aviation support
     (POC: AMC/A3OO).
     2.4.3. Approves operational participation in public or military events within their Area of
     Responsibility according to Attachment 2 and AFI 35-101, Chapter 8.
     2.4.3. (AMC) AMC/CC delegates participation approval for AMC aviation support IAW
     Attachment 2, this supplement.
     2.4.4. Coordinates and obtains aviation support for public and military events when
     requested by HQ USAF/A3OO. Units may require external funding identification and
     coordination for certain events prior to participation approval.
     2.4.4. (AMC) 618 TACC is OPR (POC 618 TACC/XOBL) for obtaining aviation support
     when requested by AF/A3OO and may task wings to support key domestic and international
     public or military events. The supporting aircrews/aircraft will come from the Wing
     Allocations as generated by the Aircrew Aircraft Tasking System (AATS)—see the AMC
     AATS CONOPS, 16 Nov 05, para 2.4.3.6.2 and 3.4.4.2.2 The costs of flying operations
     generated by such taskings will be paid from the wings’ O&M budgets for flying training;
     notwithstanding, partial funding to off-set some of the O&M outlay may be worked in
     conjunction with the Joint Airborne/Air Transportability Training (JA/ATT) Program,
     Special Assignment Airlift Missions (SAAM) and Tanker Airlift Control Center (TACC)
     channel missions funded by the Transportation Working Capital Fund (TWCF):
        2.4.4.1. (Added-AMC) The JA/ATT Program (OPR: AMC/A3D). JA/ATT missions
        may offer opportunities to support military or public events with personnel and/or
        equipment airdrop demonstrations—at reduced unit costs—while at the same time
        accomplishing unit training. As an example, a US Army unit could support its own open
        house event with a personnel airdrop demonstration using a JA/ATT mission: both the
        Army unit and the AMC aircrew would receive training and the cost of the airlift would
        be paid by the participating AMC wing from its O&M budget for flying training, an
        additional incentive for the Army unit. Some guidelines apply: 1) The aviation support
        (i.e., aerial demonstration) must be an adjunct to training and not the primary purpose of
        the mission; 2) The aerial demonstration does not compromise or degrade training, nor
        generate additional costs; 3) The aerial demonstration is fully coordinated with the user
        and event organizer; and, 4) AMC/A3D approval for a wing to fly a JA/ATT mission
        does not constitute participation approval for an embedded aerial demonstration (i.e.,
        personnel or equipment airdrops) planned in support of a military or public event—
AFI11-209_AMCSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2009                                                             19


     participation approval for an aerial demonstration follows a track separate from the
     JA/ATT process and is addressed in Chapter 4, para 4.4 and 4.6, this supplement.
     2.4.4.2. (Added-AMC) SAAM. US aerospace companies may purchase a SAAM to
     airlift company products to international air and trade exhibitions. When properly
     coordinated and approved, the aircrew/aircraft providing the lift could also provide
     aviation support for the same exhibition. In such cases, the cost of positioning and de-
     positioning the aircraft and crew to/from the event location is paid by the SAAM,
     resulting in little to no wing O&M outlay (OPR AMC/A3O).
     2.4.4.3. (Added-AMC) TWCF Channel . Wings may consider flying TWCF channel
     missions to position/deposition their aircrews/aircraft when planning aviation support,
     particularly for events hosted at international venues. AMC/A3OO, the wing Project
     Officer, and TACC//XOB// should coordinate on such possibilities. Creative channel-
     mission scheduling could reduce a unit’s O&M outlay by using the TWCF to pay the cost
     of positioning/de-positioning channel legs while providing augmented airlift
     opportunities for channel operations. Some guidelines apply: 1) XOG may have to deny
     a wing’s request or cancel a scheduled channel mission at the last minute based on
     changing cargo or airlift requirements; 2) If XOG cancels a scheduled, add-on channel
     mission due to changing requirements, the cost of the positioning/de-positioning legs will
     be paid from unit O&M funding—a AMC Support Mission will not be generated simply
     to relieve a unit from using O&M funding; 3) If the port to which the channel mission
     positions the aircraft is not the event location, the cost to position the aircraft to final
     destination is paid from the wing’s O&M budget for flying training; and, 4) The cost of
     flying operations associated with the planned aviation support at the event location could
     be paid using one of several alternatives other than TWCF: unit O&M funding or IAW
     guidance found on the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) web site (i.e.,
     Public Law 102-484, IAW DODD 7230.8, etc.—see AFI 11-209, para 5.10.).
  2.4.5. Ensures all command personnel participating in public or military events meet the
  following standards:
  2.4.5. (AMC) Wing commanders will ensure wing personnel participating in public or
  military events meet the following standards:
     2.4.5.1. Pilots and aircrew are highly qualified and proficient in the flying procedures,
     standard profiles, and demonstration techniques (reference AFI 11-246 appropriate
     aircraft volume) planned for the event.
     2.4.5.1. (AMC) Pilots and aircrew are highly qualified and proficient in the flying
     procedures and aerial performance techniques for flyovers, aerial reviews and aerial
     demonstrations. To execute aerial demonstrations, pilots must be certified IAW AFI 11-
     246, Vol 6, and the AMC CONOPS implementing AFI 11-246, Vol 6. The wing aviation
     support program should address requirements in this paragraph (see para 1.1.2 and
     Attachment 10, this supplement).
     2.4.5.2. Personnel exhibit superb military bearing and are present in the proper uniform
     at the aircraft or equipment during periods of public viewing.
     2.4.5.3. Personnel possess in-depth knowledge of the aircraft or equipment and of the
     Air Force, in general.
20                                                   AFI11-209_AMCSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2009


        2.4.5.3. (AMC) AMC personnel must possess a basic knowledge of air mobility
        operations and AMC history—all who represent AMC must be able to effectively
        address these issues with the public (see para 1.1 and 1.1.1, this supplement).
        2.4.5.4. Personnel can communicate effectively with the public.
     2.4.6. Provides a single point of contact (POC) within the Operations Directorate for all
     command participation in military or public events covered by this instruction. Provides the
     POC’s name, rank, office symbol, e-mail address, and Defense Switched Network (DSN)
     and commercial voice and fax numbers to HQ USAF/A3OO and SAF/PA. The designated
     POC may be in a subordinate Numbered Air Force (NAF).
     2.4.6. (AMC) HQ AMC/A3O is the OPR (POC AMC/A3OO) for command participation in
     military or public events under the purview of AFI 11-209. AMC/A3OO will provide
     contact information [name, rank (or title), office symbol, e-mail address, and Defense
     Switched Network (DSN) and commercial voice and fax numbers] to HQ USAF/A3OO,
     SAF/PA and MAJCOM counterparts; additionally, the POC will maintain a roster (with
     contact information) of the key players at HAF and the other MAJCOMS engaged in
     aviation support.
     2.4.7. Ensures a planned flyover profile is tailored to the specific event site. The unit
     commander or a designated representative must review and approve these profiles. The
     approving authority must ensure compliance with applicable Air Force policy directives and
     instructions, aircraft specific training manuals, MAJCOM supplements, and all FAA/Host
     Nation rules and regulations. Deviations from approved flight profiles are not authorized
     except for safety of flight.
     2.4.7. (AMC) An AMC aircrew planning an aerial performance for a military or public
     event will prepare a flight profile tailored to the specific event site. The profile will address
     the following, as applicable, for the type of aerial performance and event site: arrival
     procedures and routing; holding point/holding pattern; ground track for the aerial
     performance (identify the flyover/aerial review target for over flight and TOT; drop zone
     (DZ) information and planned airdrop ground track; the sequencing of Standard
     Demonstrations making up the profile (for example: overhead pattern, assault landing,
     reverse taxi, assault takeoff, etc.); exit procedure/routing; altitudes/airspeeds applicable to
     each phase; and, other factors relevant to the particular site.
        2.4.7.1. (Added-AMC) The flight profile will be assessed using the wing’s Operational
        Risk Management (ORM) criteria/procedures (see Attachment 6, this supplement).
        2.4.7.2. (Added-AMC) The aircrew’s WG/CC will review/approve the flight profile for
        the aerial performance, or may delegate this responsibility to the leadership level
        established in the Wing Aviation Support Program (see para 1.1.2 & Supplement 10, this
        supplement); to this end, the Wing Aviation Support Program must outline the wing’s
        process for reviewing/approving the flight profile for an aerial performance, ensuring
        compliance with applicable Air Force policy directives and instructions, aircraft specific
        training manuals, AMC supplements, and applicable FAA/Host Nation rules and
        regulations.
        2.4.7.3. (Added-AMC) The aircrew will coordinate the flight profile with the Air Boss,
        or Director of Air Operations (see Attachment 1, Terms, this supplement), for the event
AFI11-209_AMCSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2009                                                              21


     being supported, gaining concurrence. Deviations from an approved flight profile are not
     authorized except for safety of flight or as directed by appropriate air traffic control—
     common sense must prevail.
  2.4.8. Ensures aircraft and equipment placed on static display are made safe according to
  Attachment 3 and MAJCOM guidance.
  2.4.8. (AMC) AMC aircraft or equipment placed on static display must be prepared and
  made safe IAW AFI 11-209, Attachment 3 and IAW Attachments 4 and 5, this supplement.
  Additionally, see Attachment 10, this supplement.
  2.4.9. Coordinates all planned participation in military or public events with the FAA
  through the regional Air Force representative (or host nation equivalent). This can be
  delegated to the participating unit. Coordination is not required if participation consists only
  of static display support.
  2.4.9. (AMC) AMC wings participating in military or public events will ensure their
  planned aviation support is coordinated with the FAA through the regional Air Force
  representative. This will be done by the project officer working the aviation support package
  for the wing or accomplished IAW the procedures outlined in the Wing Aviation Support
  Program. An AMC aircraft commander planning to conduct an aerial performance for a
  military Open House or public air show must receive the Air Show Operations Briefing
  conducted by the Air Boss, or Director of Air Operations, for the event being supported prior
  to participation, or participation approval is void. If the aircraft commander reasonably
  cannot be physically present for the Air Show Operations Briefing, the briefing can be
  received telephonically if the Air Boss or Director of Air Operations concurs. Additionally,
  an aircraft commander planning to execute a personnel airdrop will ensure the jump master
  or jump team leader receives the briefing. See Attachment 10, this supplement.
  2.4.10. Provides an Aerial Control Team (ACT) as directed in MAJCOM supplement to this
  instruction and in the following cases:
     2.4.10.1. Events requiring precise timing.
     2.4.10.2. High visibility events (i.e., the Super Bowl).
     2.4.10.3. Aerial Reviews.
     2.4.10.4. Directed by HQ USAF/A3O.
     2.4.10.5. Events within the Washington, DC National Capital Region (NCR).
  2.4.11. Submits requests to SAF/PA for coordination and participation approval of foreign
  aircraft or foreign military demonstration teams (flying teams or parachute demonstration
  teams) in CONUS open house events.
  2.4.12. Requests waivers to this instruction.
  2.4.13. MAJCOMs may delegate duties, responsibilities and approval levels within their
  supplement to this instruction, unless specifically prohibited by this instruction.
  2.4.14. (Added-AMC) Units must ensure that airfields transited, when en route to military
  or public events for which aviation support is planned, are suitable for AMC aircraft
  operations—refer to the AMC Global Decision Support System (GDSS) Giant Report for
22                                                     AFI11-209_AMCSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2009


     current information on airfield suitability and restrictions. If GDSS is not available, refer to
     the HQ AMC Airfield Suitability and Restrictions Report (ASRR) (IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 3,
     para 2.1.2.).
2.5. Mission Commander. In general, the mission commander is the on-scene commander
responsible for the overall safety and conduct of the mission and makes the “go“ or “no-go“
decision. A mission commander is required for flyovers, aerial reviews, and aerial
demonstrations. The mission commander, or deputy, must be highly qualified, having a
thorough understanding of the aerial event being undertaken. The mission commander’s
responsibilities include, but are not limited to, flyover safety, weather considerations, timing,
sequencing, and airspace and range clearances. The mission commander should be able to
directly communicate with the pilot or aircraft commander or should be able to relay information
to the pilot or aircraft commander. In some cases, the senior member of the ACT is designated
as the mission commander. In the event the senior member of the ACT is not the mission
commander, then the mission commander may be one of the following:
     2.5.1. The aircraft commander on a fixed-wing aircraft/helicopter having an aircrew.
     2.5.2. The pilot in a single-seat fighter or trainer aircraft.
     2.5.3. Flight lead for a fighter/trainer formation.
     2.5.4. Ground-based military officer acting as an air boss for an airshow or other ceremony.
     2.5.5. Senior enlisted military member working in the tower.
     2.5.6. DoD-civilian Airspace Manager with ATC Tower or Rated Pilot experience
     working in the control tower.
2.6. Aerial Control Team (ACT) Responsibilities. An ACT is a highly experienced
individual or team of individuals organized and established to control Air Force participation in
military and public events. Each MAJCOM will establish qualifications for ACT members.
Employing an ACT is appropriate when Air Force participation includes large numbers of
aircraft or aircraft from more than one MAJCOM or Service. For events within the NCR,
coordination for ACT support must be made through ACC/A3OA, DSN 574-7854, not later
than (NLT) 7 duty days prior to the event. For flyovers occurring at Arlington National
Cemetery, coordination will occur as soon as possible. The ACT is responsible for the following:
2.6. (AMC) Aerial Control Team (ACT) Responsibilities.618 TACC/XOBL may activate an
AMC ACT to plan and /or control AMC aerial performances for designated military or public
events (POC: AMC/A3O). Normally, the 618 TACC/XOBL will task a wing to appoint the
ACT team chief, and other members as needed. Basic qualifications for the ACT team members
are as follows: 1) The ACT team chief must have an aeronautical rating and must have
experience in planning complex flying performances, in organizing and leading participating
aircrews on-site, in controlling the movement/flow of aircraft, in briefing leadership at all levels,
etc.; 2) All team members must be familiar with the operating characteristics of the participating
aircraft; and, 3) All members must have a working knowledge of the applicable instructions (AFI
11-209; AFI 11-246, Vol 6; AFI 11-202,Vol 3; AFI 11-2MDS,Vol 3; etc.).
     2.6.1. Planning Air Force participation and coordinating details with participating
     commands, commanders, participants, and the FAA.
AFI11-209_AMCSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2009                                                                 23


   2.6.1. (AMC) NCR Aerial Performances—HQ ACC ACT. AMC aircrews will contact HQ
   ACC/A3OA, Aerial Events Branch, as soon as practical when planning aerial performances
   in support of military or public events hosted at venues located in the NCR. ACC/A3OA, as
   tasked by DoD, will provide aircrews comprehensive flight procedures/information (called
   Smart Packs) governing aerial performances in the NCR. Additionally, ACC/A3OA will
   provide an ACT to control all NCR aerial performances. Contact ACC/A3OA as follows:
   Comm (757) 764-8174; DSN 574-8174; or, . The NCR is defined at Attachment 1, this
   2.6.2. Briefing commanders and participants on all aspects of participation to include, at a
   minimum, flight profiles, airspeeds, altitudes, holding patterns, communication
   frequencies, air traffic control coverage, area traffic density, area hazards, weather
   minimums, alternate weather procedures, and other relevant operational considerations.
   2.6.3. Controlling the flow and movement of all participating aircraft. ACTs will use
   discrete radio frequencies when possible.
   2.6.4. Serving as the on-scene advisor to the mission commander, or as the mission
   commander if requested by the MAJCOM.
2.7. (Added-AMC) AMC Ground Coordinator. A ground coordinator is recommended for
all events. The role of the ground coordinator is to communicate to the aircrew essential
information relevant to the event occurring on-site and to the air traffic situation in the proximate
air space—key objectives are to control timing and enhance safety. The following, non-
prioritized listing identifies various alternatives satisfying the requirement for a ground
coordinator: 1) An ACT—see AFI 11-209, para 2.6. and para 2.6., this supplement; 2) An AMC
mission commander when operating from a location on-site—see AFI 11-209, para 2.5.; 3) An
AMC rated officer (preferably with experience in the participating aircraft), or rated officer from
an ARC unit, another MAJCOM or service; 4) An AMC officer or senior enlisted member with
air traffic control experience, or a comparable active duty member from another MAJCOM or
service, or a comparable member from the ARC; or, 5) The “Air Boss,” whether military or
civilian, appointed, or hired, to control air operations for a military Open House event or public
air show.
   2.7.1. (Added-AMC) The WG/CC is responsible for ensuring a suitable ground coordinator
   is present on-site with communications capability whenever an assigned aircrew using an
   assigned aircraft is executing an aerial performance, except as noted in para 2.7.2, below.
   The SSS used in the wing coordination process for participation approval will reflect the
   arrangements made for the ground coordinator.
   2.7.2. (Added-AMC) For some funeral flyovers, the presence of a ground coordinator may
   be impractical. As an example, a flyover may be requested for a funeral at a cemetery too
   distant from any military installation to reasonably arrange for a ground coordinator.
   Notwithstanding the non-availability of a ground coordinator, the funeral flyover may still be
   approved by the AMC/A3 on a case-by-case basis when requested by the WG/CC, subject to
   the following considerations:
       2.7.2.1. (Added-AMC) The participating aircrew has identified the exact location of the
       grave-site and established a firm time for the flyover with both the supporting military
       Mortuary Affairs Office and the Funeral Director overseeing the interment.

     2.7.2.2. (Added-AMC) The non-availability of a ground coordinator must be addressed
     in the ORM assessment for the funeral flyover and annotated in the SSS requesting
     participation approval (see para 4.6 and Attachment 9, this supplement).

                              EVENT APPROVAL PROCESS

3.1. General Approval Process. Air Force participation in any event requires approval
from Public Affairs and Operations. Public Affairs is concerned with the appropriateness of
an event for Air Force involvement. Operational approval is concerned with operational
issues. For public events outside the United States, Canada and Mexico, the combatant
commander has authority over the approval and participation in events within the command’s
Area of Responsibility (AOR). In this case, comply with combatant command directives and
utilize this chapter as general guidance for the event. See paragraph 5.9 for additional
requirements for overseas events.
3.2. Public Event Approval. Civilian sponsors of public events in the United States, Canada
and Mexico seeking Air Force aviation support must request event approval from SAF/PA using
DD Form 2535, Request for Military Aerial Support. Military sponsors of public events are also
required to send the DD Form 2535 (except as noted in paragraph 3.2.2) through their
MAJCOM/PA to SAF/PA with as much lead time as possible (usually a minimum of 45 days),
before any Air Force asset can participate in their events. SAF/PA evaluates the information in
the DD Form 2535 to determine the eligibility of the events specified for the aviation support
requested using the guidance found in DoD Directive 5410.18, DoD Instruction 5410.19, AFI
35-101, and other applicable publications and instructions. For a comprehensive discussion on
the DD Form 2535 or to obtain a copy, see the U.S. Air Force Aerial Events Support web site
(http://www.airshows.pa.hq.af.mil/) and select “Request Procedures.” Civilian sponsors
seeking aviation support (flyovers or AFPT demos) for public events that directly support
commemorations of patriotic holidays are still required to submit a DD Form 2535. Civilian or
military sponsors who seek Air Force aviation support for public events planned outside the
United States, Canada and Mexico will comply with COCOM directives to obtain event
approval. The DD Form 2535 may be submitted to MAJCOM/PA (in lieu of SAF/PA) for
events that involve only static display, or when the events directly support the
commemoration of a Patriotic Holiday (i.e., not in conjunction with a sporting event; see
paragraph 3.6.2.1.1).
   3.2.1. SAF/PA determines eligibility, IAW DoD and AF policy, for the following:
       3.2.1.1. Aviation-related events (aviation shows, aviation fairs, aviation expositions,
       airport dedications, events primarily designed to encourage the advancement of
       aviation, and civic events that contribute to the public knowledge of Armed Forces
       aviation equipment and capabilities)— SAF/PA processes event approval requests for
       aviation-related public events IAW standing, internal procedures and posts notification
       of those approved to the U.S. Air Force Aerial Events Support web site.
       3.2.1.2. Non-aviation related events (e.g., professional/amateur sports, community
       relations events, parades, festivals, etc.)—SAF/PA processes event approval for non-
       aviation related public events IAW Exception-to-Policy (ETP) procedures. The ETP
       process involves the HQ USAF/A3 community as well as SAF/PA and is outlined in
       paragraph 3.5. ETP approvals are granted only when participation is determined to be in
       the best interest of the USAF. Event sponsors should follow the ETP procedures posted
26                                                  AFI11-209_AMCSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2009


        on the U.S. Air Force Aerial Events Support web site when requesting event approval
        for non-aviation related events. The DD Form 2535 and ETP documentation should reach
        SAF/PA 45 days in advance of the event’s date. Forms received within 14 days of an
        event are generally not considered for support.
     3.2.2. Approved Military-Sponsored Public Events. The following on-base public
     events are approved for Air Force aviation support and need no further Public Affairs
     approval. Operations approval (i.e., participation approval) for the type of aviation support
     planned for these events is still required.
        3.2.2.1. Military open house events. A DD Form 2535 is required for DoD
        demonstration team requests. A copy must be forwarded through MAJCOM/PA to
        SAF/PA for consolidation, prioritization and posting.
        3.2.2.2. USAF Academy flyovers. See Chapter 5 for procedures.
        3.2.2.3. The National Guard Academy of Military Science flyovers.
3.3. Military Event Approval. Military event approval rests with the MAJCOM hosting the
event or as specified in DoD policy.
     3.3.1. Approved Military Events. The following military events are approved for Air Force
     aviation support lAW current DoD and AF Public Affairs policy and need no further Public
     Affairs coordination. Operations approval (i.e., participation approval) for the type of
     aviation support planned for these events is still required. Approval for military events
     does not constitute approval for an aerial review (see paragraphs 1.4.3., 3.6.3., and 4.3 for
     aerial review criteria, restrictions and approval levels).
        3.3.1.1. On-base patriotic observances (see paragraph 3.6.2.1 for off-base criteria).
        3.3.1.2. Retirement ceremonies and change of command ceremonies (see paragraph
        3.6.2.2 for criteria).
        3.3.1.3. Funeral or memorial events (see paragraph 3.6.2.3 for criteria).
        3.3.1.4. On-base unit change of aircraft and unit flag retirement ceremonies.
        3.3.1.5. The installation commander may deem other on-base military events eligible
        based on the contribution such events make to fostering esprit de corps, military values
        and patriotism, and on their ability to stand the test of public scrutiny. Examples of
        other eligible events are: military graduation ceremonies, retreat ceremonies,
        memorial ceremonies, and military parades. MAJCOMs have the authority to approve
        flyovers or jump platform aircraft by their assigned operational aircraft in support of
        approved events on their respective command bases.
        3.3.1.5. (AMC) AMC wing commanders are the participation approval authorities for
        aviation support as outlined in para 4.6.2, para 5.4 and Attachment 2, all in this
        supplement—commanders of AMC groups without a parent wing must first obtain host
        wing concurrence. Participation approval authority for all other aviation support
        proposals rests with the AMC/A3, or higher authority, as summarized in para 4.6.3 and
        as specified in Attachment 2, both in this supplement.
     3.3.2. Disapproved Military Events. The following military events or ceremonies are not
     approved for Air Force aviation support lAW current DoD and AF policy: off-base
AFI11-209_AMCSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2009                                                              27


   retirement ceremonies, off-base change of command ceremonies, off-base unit flag
   retirement ceremonies, and off-base unit change of aircraft ceremonies.
3.4. SAF/PA Approval Process. Once SAF/PA determines an event appropriate for Air Force
aviation support, it is posted to the U.S. Air Force Aerial Events Support web site
(http://www.air- shows.pa.hq.af.mil/) as an “Eligible Event.” This is the primary means
SAF/PA uses to communicate with event sponsors and military flying units and/or AF
parachute demonstration teams on event approval. Being declared eligible does not mean Air
Force “participation approval” has been granted (this is an Operations consideration) or that a
unit has volunteered to provide the event aviation support.
   3.4.1. Units wishing to volunteer to support an event must indicate their intent on the
   website or via telephone to SAF/PAN. Event sponsors may contact units to solicit aviation
   support for their events.
   3.4.1. (AMC) AMC units volunteering to support an eligible event listed on the SAF/PA
   web site (http://www.airshows.pa.hq.af.mil/) must indicate their intent on the web site or
   via telephone to SAF/PAN, and will inform AMC//A3OO/
       3.4.1.1. Units volunteering for any ETP event must notify SAF/PAN and MAJCOM
       of their intent to support not later than 7 days prior to the event (normally 14 days
       prior or earlier). All events that do not have a volunteer unit will be removed from the
       web site 7 days prior and will not be considered for support. Units must also coordinate
       with event sponsors.
       3.4.1.1. (AMC) AMC units volunteering for any ETP event must notify SAF/PAN and
       AMC//A3OO/PA// (e-mail or telephone) within 14 days of the event, or sooner, but not
       later than seven days prior to the event. Events that do not have a volunteer unit will be
       removed from the web site seven days prior and will not be considered for support. Units
       must also coordinate with event sponsors.
       3.4.1.2. MAJCOMs may require a unit to volunteer via MAJCOM rather than directly
       with SAF/ PAN (see MAJCOM supplement to this instruction).
       3.4.1.2. (AMC) In the interest of time, AMC units volunteering to support an eligible
       event can communicate directly with SAF/PAN (telephone, web site, e-mail), and then
       follow up immediately with an informational notification to AMC//A3OO/PA//.
   3.4.2. SAF/PA and SAF/IA, in turn, are the approval authorities for events planned
   specifically for a foreign dignitary, to include the type and level of aviation support that is
   appropriate. Event sponsors are to submit requests at least 45 calendar days in advance.
3.5. Exception-to-Policy Procedures for Public Events. Public events for which ETP
procedures apply must be evaluated and approved by both SAF/PAN and HQ USAF/A3O;
participation approval is delegated to the MAJCOMs for the aviation support that approved
ETP events are ultimately rendered (see Chapter 4). The event sponsor initiates the ETP
process by submitting a DD Form 2535 to SAF/PA IAW procedures listed in AFI 35-101,
Chapter 8, and the U.S. Air Force Aerial Events Support web site. The following procedures
outline the ETP approval process for public events unless aviation related (IAW paragraph
3.2.1.1) or in direct support of a Patriotic Holiday.
28                                                   AFI11-209_AMCSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2009


     3.5.1. Annually HQ USAF/A3O and SAF/PA will release a joint message, categorizing as
     depicted below, the events for the coming year for which event sponsors are requesting
     ETP event approval. The message will assign the level of aviation support considered
     appropriate for selected events by name and for other events by category.
        3.5.1.1. Category 1 (Cat 1). Events designated Cat 1 will be listed by event name and
        are automatically granted event approval—they are of such importance that every effort
        will be taken to support them. Aviation support is pre-approved up to a four-ship
        formation. Volunteer units will be solicited—if no units volunteer, HQ USAF/A3O will
        coordinate with appropriate MAJCOMs and task selected units for aviation support.
        Relatively few ETP events will fall into Cat 1 (some examples are the Super Bowl, the
        Rose Bowl, the Indianapolis 500, etc.).
        3.5.1.1. (AMC) Category 1 (Cat 1). Based on input from AF/A3O and AMC/A3O,
        618 TACC/XOB (POC: XOBL), through the Service Mission scheduling processes, will
        solicit volunteers or task as required to participate in AF directed CAT 1 events.
        3.5.1.2. Category 2 (Cat 2). Events designated Cat 2 will be listed by general classes
        of events, such as a specific sport or events for which Air Force Recruiting Service has
        a sponsorship role. As events are placed in Cat 2, they are granted event approval
        and aviation support is pre-approved up to a four-ship formation. Cat 2 events are
        supported by volunteer units and typically will not be tasked.
        3.5.1.3. Category 3 (Cat 3). Events not identified under Cat 1 or 2 fall into Cat 3.
        SAF/PA and HQ USAF/A3O will jointly determine if a given Cat 3 event warrants
        event approval and, if approved, will specify an appropriate type and level of aviation
        support (e.g., 4-ship, 2-ship, single-ship, etc.). Approved Cat 3 events are to be supported
        by volunteer units and typically will not be tasked.
     3.5.2. Events approved under one of the categories above are considered to have ETP event
     approval and are posted to the U.S. Air Force Aerial Events Support web site. HQ
     USAF/A3O delegates participation approval to MAJCOM/A3 for events approved under the
     above categories. MAJCOM/A3 will ensure that the volunteer unit will support the event as
     an addition to an approved training mission and that the support rendered will pass the test
     of public scrutiny (i.e. training accomplished, impact to operations, proximity of event to
     the base, additional support requirements, and wing commander support). Once participation
     approval is granted, the MAJCOM/A3 office responsible for aerial events will inform HQ
     USAF/A3OO NLT two working days prior to the event. Notification will include at a
     minimum the participation approval, unit, type, and number of supporting aircraft.
     3.5.2. (AMC) AMC/A3 is the participation approval authority for aviation support planned
     for an event in Categories 1-3 as approved IAW ETP procedures. The wing commander of
     the participating, volunteer unit must ensure that the aviation support planned for the event is
     an adjunct to approved flight training and that the support rendered will pass the test of
     public scrutiny (i.e., evaluate using criteria such as the training to be accomplished, the
     impact on operations, the proximity of the event to the base, additional support requirements,
     etc.). Once participation approval is granted, AMC/A3OO will inform HQ USAF/A3OO
     NLT two working days prior to the event. Notification will include at a minimum the
     participating unit designation and the MDS and number of supporting aircraft.

3.6. Specific Aviation Support for Public or Military Events Event Approval
Considerations. The following paragraphs outline additional guidance bearing on the event
approval process (see Approval Matrix in Attachment 2).
   3.6.1. Static Display. Events for which static displays are requested require Public
   Affairs event approval or as delegated in AFI 35-101, Chapter 8. Refer to paragraph
   3.6.2.2 for Retirement or Change of Command ceremony criteria.
   3.6.2. Flyover. In general, an event for which a flyover is requested requires Public
   Affairs event approval IAW paragraphs 3.2 through 3.5 above, except as noted below.
      3.6.2.1. Off-Base Patriotic Holiday. As a matter of DoD and Air Force policy,
      aviation support in the form of flyovers (or AFPT demonstrations) is authorized for off-
      base patriotic observances, i.e., commemorative events held in support of patriotic
      holidays. Such events must be evaluated by at least MAJCOM/PA prior to receiving
      aviation support to ensure compliance with governing policies and procedures. The
      commemorative event for which the flyover (or AFPT demonstration) is performed
      must occur within seven days of the national day of observance of the holiday.
      3.6.2.1. (AMC) Off-Base Patriotic Holiday. As a matter of DoD and Air Force policy,
      aviation support in the form of a flyover or AFPT demonstration is authorized for an off-
      base patriotic observance, i.e., for a commemorative event, held in support of a patriotic
      holiday, subject to the following. The commemorative event must occur within seven
      days of the national day of observance of the holiday and must be in direct support of the
      holiday. The event sponsor, normally in communications with the Public Affairs Office
      of the supporting AMC wing, should submit a completed DD Form 2535 to HQ
      AMC/PA (info: supporting wing Public Affairs Office and SAF/PA) where it will be
      evaluated to ensure compliance with governing policies and procedures and to confirm
      that the event is actually commemorative of the Patriotic Holiday (hence, suitable for Air
      Force participation). AMC/PA will apprise AMC/A3 (POC A3OO), the supporting wing
      Public Affairs Office and the event sponsor whether or not the event is approved. For
      approved events, guidance for participation approval is in AFI 11-209, Chap 4, and in
      Chap 4, this supplement. If the FAA Flight Standards District Office has indicated on
      the DD Form 2535, Section IV, Block 17, that the event is “Conditional Satisfactory,”
      AMC/PA will fax a copy to AMC/A3 (POC A3OO) for review.
          3.6.2.1.1. The commemorative event for which the flyover (or AFPT
          demonstration) is performed must directly support the patriotic holiday. Non-
          commemorative events merely falling within seven days of the national days of
          observance for the applicable holidays are not eligible for flyovers (or AFPT
          demonstrations), unless approved by SAF/PA through normal procedures. An
          example of a non-commemorative event would be a sporting event held on or near
          Independence Day, even one with a solemn ceremony or moment of silence.
          3.6.2.1.2. See paragraph 3.6.2.4 for guidance on use of the Missing Man Formation
          at patriotic observances.
          3.6.2.1.3. The event sponsor must submit a completed DD Form 2535 to
          MAJCOM/PA or SAF/PA, where it is reviewed to ensure the event is actually a
          commemorative event suitable for Air Force participation. Local bases receiving
30                                                AFI11-209_AMCSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2009


          DD Forms 2535 should forward them through their MAJCOM/PA and on to
          SAF/PA, if applicable.
       3.6.2.2. Retirement/Change of Command Ceremony. Flyovers or aerial reviews for
       off-base retirement or change of command ceremonies are not permitted. Ceremonies
       eligible for aerial support, if they are held on-base, are approved only for the following
       personnel as noted below:
          3.6.2.2.1. The Chief of Staff of the Air Force (CSAF) or any combatant commander
          is authorized an aerial review. Air Force participation in COCOM multi-service
          or multi-national aerial reviews is approved. MAJCOMs will provide an
          information copy to HQ USAF/A3O containing the number and type of aircraft
          participating.
          3.6.2.2.2. The Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force (VCSAF), a MAJCOM/CC or
          a State Adjutant General is authorized a flyover by a single formation (up to four-
          ship).
          3.6.2.2.3. A MAJCOM/CV, a NAF/CC, or a Center/CC is authorized a flyover by a
          single aircraft.
          3.6.2.2.4. AFPT jumps in lieu of flyovers are allowed for the personnel authorized
          above.
          3.6.2.2.5. On-base retirement and change of command ceremonies for any other
          military members are not eligible for an Air Force flyover, except when approved
          IAW ETP procedures (paragraph 3.6.2.2.6).
          3.6.2.2.6. Exception-to-policy requests for flyovers supporting retirement and change
          of command ceremonies require HQ USAF/CV approval. HQ USAF/CV approval is
          required for a flyover if the participating aircraft is (are) from another service,
          nation, or civilian organization.
          3.6.2.2.7. MAJCOMs may authorize aviation support, with their respective
          aircraft, in the form of static displays for on-base retirement or change of command
          ceremonies (as designated in MAJCOM supplement to this instruction).
          3.6.2.2.7. (AMC) AMC wing commanders may authorize the static display of
          organic aircraft for on-base retirement or change of command ceremonies—AMC
          commanders of groups without a parent wing must first gain the concurrence of their
          host wings.
       3.6.2.3. Funeral or Memorial Flyovers. Funeral and memorial services for members
       who meet the governing criteria are eligible for Air Force flyovers. Funeral and
       memorial service flyover requests will be initiated by the servicing base Mortuary
       Officer or Air Force Mortuary Affairs and staffed through MAJCOMs (Mortuary
       Affairs and Operations directorates) to HQ USAF/ A3OO. Funeral flyover request
       procedures can be found in AFI 34-242. A funeral or memorial flyover is to be flown
       as part of a training sortie, not as a stand-alone mission.
NOTE: The servicing base Mortuary Affairs or Air Force Mortuary Affairs is the single point of
contact for the next of kin.
AFI11-209_AMCSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2009                                                               31


         3.6.2.3.1. Eligibility. The following list outlines those eligible for an Air Force
         funeral/memorial flyover:
             3.6.2.3.1.1. Active duty or currently serving Air Reserve Component (ARC) rated
             officers (pilots, navigators, air battle managers, observers, and flight surgeons) and
             Career Enlisted Aviators (1AXXX enlisted crewmembers, i.e. flight engineers,
             loadmasters, boom operators, etc.). This category includes those taking courses of
             instruction leading to an aeronautical rating. Treat ARC members the same as
             active duty (eligible when death occurs whether on or off duty). This includes
             ARC members not on unit training assembly (UTA) or military orders.
             3.6.2.3.1.2. Active duty or currently serving ARC non-rated officers, non-Career
             Enlisted Aviators, and Operations Support Flyers (as defined in AFI 11-402,
             Aviation and Parachutist Service, Aeronautical Ratings and Badges, i.e. nurses,
             medical technicians, intelligence specialists, etc.) but only when death occurs in
             the line of duty while performing aviation duties.
             3.6.2.3.1.3. Dignitaries of the Armed Forces and federal government. HQ
             USAF/A3O has the authority to designate Dignitaries of the Armed Forces;
             requests with full justification must be made through the MAJCOM staff to HQ
             AF/A3OO.
             3.6.2.3.1.4. Active duty or retired USAF 3-star and 4-star general officers,
             regardless of aeronautical rating.
             3.6.2.3.1.5. Active Duty or retired Chief Master Sergeants of the Air Force
             (CMSAF).
             3.6.2.3.1.6. USAF members (active duty, retired or honorably separated) who
             have been awarded the Medal of Honor, Air Force Cross, Army Distinguished
             Service Cross, or Navy Cross.
             3.6.2.3.1.7. USAF aviators (active duty, retired or honorably separated)
             who have achieved at least one or more officially recognized aerial victories. The
             Air Force Historical Research Agency is the official source for aerial victories.
             3.6.2.3.1.8. USAF members (active duty, retired or honorably separated) who
             were Prisoners of War.
NOTE: Repatriated remains of individuals meeting the requirements of paragraph
3.6.2.3.1.1. or 3.6.2.3.1.2. are entitled to flyover honors.
         3.6.2.3.2. Although a funeral/memorial flyover may be authorized by meeting the
         above criteria, it may not always be appropriate. A funeral or memorial flyover is
         part of the honors bestowed on the deceased. If the lifestyle of an individual during
         or following his or her military service is not within the standards normally expected
         of a military professional or if the circumstances surrounding the death reflect
         negatively on the Air Force, a funeral flyover may not be approved in all cases. HQ
         USAF/A30 will make the determination in these cases.
         3.6.2.3.3. If a deceased member is eligible, no further HQ USAF approval is
         required. MAJCOMs grant participation approval for funeral/memorial flyovers
         (inform HQ USAF/A300).
32                                         AFI11-209_AMCSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2009


     3.6.2.3.3. (AMC) If a deceased member is eligible for a funeral/memorial flyover
     IAW AFI 11-209, para 3.6.2.3.1., no further HQ USAF approval is required. AMC
     participation approval levels for funeral/memorial flyovers are listed at Attachment
     2, this supplement (inform HQ USAF/A3OO).
     3.6.2.3.4. Memorial Flyovers. Procedures and approval levels for memorial flyovers
     are the same as for funeral flyovers. Memorial flyovers commemorate or recognize
     an individual, group, or historically significant event. MAJCOMs may approve on-
     base flyovers in this category (may be delegated to Wing/CC). For deceased
     members authorized a flyover per paragraph 3.6.2.3.1, and when the funeral service
     is held off-base, MAJCOM may authorize an additional memorial flyover at the
     base to which the individual was assigned (inform HQ USAF/A300). An off-base
     memorial flyover on other than the five patriotic holidays requires an ETP approved
     by HQ USAF/A30 and SAF/PAN.
     3.6.2.3.4. (AMC) Procedures and approval levels for memorial flyovers are the
     same as for funeral flyovers. Memorial flyovers commemorate or recognize an
     individual, group, or historically significant event. WG/CCs may approve on-base
     single-ship memorial flyovers using organic assets. For deceased members
     authorized a flyover IAW AFI 11-209, para 3.6.2.3.1., and when the funeral service is
     held off-base, WG/CCs may authorize/approve an additional single-ship memorial
     flyover at the base to which the individual was assigned using organic assets (inform
     HQ USAF/A3OO, AMC/A1SR and AMC/A3OO).
     3.6.2.3.5. Exceptions-to-Policy. Servicing base Mortuary Affairs initiates requests
     for exceptions to funeral and memorial service policy and staffs the request through
     MAJCOMs to HQ USAF/A300. Requests that are handled directly by Air Force
     Mortuary Affairs are staffed to HQ USAF/A300. Exceptions-to-policy are based on
     appropriate use of limited resources, and are typically considered only for service
     marked by valor or heroism, or has significantly impacted the aviation community
     or aviation history. ETP requests must reach HQ USAF AF/ A300 at least 5 working
     days prior to the event. HQ USAF/A300 will coordinate a package for HQ
     USAF/CVA decision. Include the following in the request:
     3.6.2.3.5. (AMC) Exceptions-to-Policy. AMC Mortuary Affairs at the servicing
     base initiates requests for funeral/memorial flyovers for deceased members for whom
     exceptions-to-policy approvals are needed, staffing such requests through HQ
     AMC/A1S to HQ USAF/A3OO (info AMC/A3OO).
        3.6.2.3.5.1. DD Form 214, Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active
        Duty, or similar discharge documentation recording the individual’s honorable
        discharge, rank, and decorations.
        3.6.2.3.5.2. A letter from the next of kin or the person acting on their behalf
        requesting the flyover.
        3.6.2.3.5.3. A biography of the individual’s service. Include commands and
        significant acts or service to the Air Force and the country.
        3.6.2.3.5.4. Any other information about the individual’s military service that is
        notable.
AFI11-209_AMCSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2009                                                            33


        3.6.2.3.6. If an exception is approved, HQ USAF/A3OO will inform MAJCOMs to
        solicit a volunteer unit to perform the flyover. Due to the short-notice nature of
        many funerals, MAJCOMs may be asked to solicit volunteers while the approval
        package is being processed.
     3.6.2.4. Missing Man Formation. The missing man formation is a flyover reserved
     for appropriate occasions and is employed only on those occasions when the theme is
     solemn and commemorative. This formation may be flown for any funeral or memorial
     approved IAW this AFI or to support commemorative events on the following
     Patriotic Holidays: 1) Memorial Day, 2) National POW/MIA Day, and 3) Veterans
     Day. When the missing man formation is flown on a Patriotic Holiday, the
     commemorative event, which the formation supports, may not be held in conjunction
     with another event such as an airshow or sporting event. All other uses of the missing
     man formation require the approval of MAJCOM/A3 (cannot be delegated).
     3.6.2.5. For additional information, see paragraph 3.2 and 3.3, and Chapter 5.
  3.6.3. Aerial Review. OASD/PA approval is required for all CONUS public event aerial
  reviews and overseas public event aerial reviews involving CONUS based aircraft. This
  approval is not required at airshows, open houses or international trade shows.
     3.6.3.1. Submit aerial review requests through the MAJCOM to SAF/PAN (inform HQ
     USAF/ A3OO) 45 calendar days before the event date. The request should include the
     date, location, type of event (dedication ceremony, retirement, etc.), and number/type of
     aircraft. SAF/PA will coordinate OASD/PA approval NLT 30 calendar days before the
     event to allow time for MAJCOM/A3 or higher participation approval. For the
     approval of an event for which an aerial review is requested, and which is hosted at a
     venue outside the United States, Canada or Mexico, see paragraph 5.9 and Attachment
     2.
     3.6.3.1. (AMC) A wing Project Officer working an aviation support package involving
     an aerial review will apprise AMC/A3O (POC AMC/A3OO) as soon as practical by e-
     mail or telecom—AMC/A3OO must apprise SAF/PAN (cc: HQ USAF/A3OO) not later
     than 45 days before the event date. The Project Officer will follow up by submitting the
     wing-approved package to AMC/A3OO so as to meet the coordinated suspense.
     3.6.3.2. The performance of multiple aerial events for a single public event constitutes a
     significant level of Air Force support and communicates to the general public, and
     event organizer, a “public affairs” endorsement for the event that is as significant as the
     endorsement that an aerial review would render. To ensure the proper levels of scrutiny
     and control, proposals for aviation support involving the performance of multiple aerial
     events for a single public event will be subject to the same approval process that a
     proposal for an aerial review would receive for the same public event. To this end,
     SAF/PAN and AF/A3O will approve aviation support proposals for single public events
     that combine an AFPT and flyover, or a flyover and aircraft demonstration (the total
     number of combined individual elements may not exceed four). An example of such a
     combination of aerial events is a 3-ship of F-16s and an AFPT demonstration. Aviation
     support proposals for single public events that combined multiple aerial events
     will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. When determining the number of elements,
34                                                 AFI11-209_AMCSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2009


        the jump platform aircraft does not count unless it is performing in some other function in
        addition to being the jump platform.
        3.6.3.2. (AMC) Multiple aerial performances planned for a single event (for example, at
        the USAFA) require the same level of approval as would an aerial review for the same
        event. OSD/PA has delegated to HQ USAF/A3O and SAF/PAN authority to approve
        aviation support proposals for single public events that combine an AFPT and a flyover,
        or a flyover and an aerial demonstration (the total number of combined individual
        elements may not exceed four)—approval for all other combinations of aerial
        performances for a single event (for example, multiple flyovers for a USAFA graduation)
        will be granted on a case-by-case bases. Project Officers are to contact AMC/A3OO as
        soon as practical when working wing-level aviation support packages involving multiple
        aerial performances.
NOTE: The guidance in this paragraph does not apply to aviation support proposals involving
multiple, combined aerial events planned for open house events, public airshows, and
international trade shows.
     3.6.4. Aerial Demonstration.
        3.6.4.1. Although considered an aerial demonstration, AFPT performances have
        different approval procedures. See paragraph 5.4. AFPT demonstrations can be
        performed in lieu of flyovers for Patriotic Holidays (paragraph 3.6.2.1).
        3.6.4.1. (AMC) Although considered an aerial demonstration, AFPT performances have
        modified participation approval procedures—see para 5.4, this supplement.
        3.6.4.2. Flying operations ostensibly conducted for training but which are actually
        intended to be viewed by non-military audiences are in fact aerial demonstrations and
        the events supported in this manner are public events falling under paragraphs 1.2 and
        3.2. An example would be the use of Joint Airborne/Air Transportability Training
        (JA/ATT) missions to airdrop personnel and/or equipment for training while inviting a
        non-military audience to view the airdrop through a public advertising campaign
        (TV/radio announcements, newspaper ads, etc.). In this example, clearly the use of
        advertising to encourage the presence of non-military spectators establishes the activity
        as an aerial demonstration for a public event.
        3.6.4.3. Flying operations conducted for training purposes (whether using training or
        O&M funding) on a facility owned, leased or operated by the DoD, and intended for
        viewing by an audience limited to military personnel, civil service personnel,
        dependents and limited number of invited guests, constitute aerial demonstrations in
        support of military events, and paragraphs 1.3 and 3.3 apply.
AFI11-209_AMCSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2009                                                              35

                         PARTICIPATION APPROVAL PROCESS

4.1. Static Displays. Participation approval for static displays is delegated to MAJCOM.
MAJCOM can delegate participation approval authority to a lower level. Before approving
static display, the decision process will include force protection concerns. Consider the safety
standards in Attachment 3, along with those in T.O. OO-8OG, Make Safe Procedures for Public
Static Display series publications, in planning and staging each static display. Aircraft specific
guidance in a T.O. will supercede the general guidance in this AFI. The following guidelines
apply to all aircraft on static display:
4.1. (AMC) Static Displays.Participation approval for the static display of organic assets is
delegated to the WG/CC for on-base public events and military events, and to the AMC/A3 for
the static display of AMC assets at off-base public events—see Attachment 2, this supplement.
   4.1.1. Aircraft on static display must be made safe according to Attachment 3 and
   applicable technical orders (TO).
   4.1.1. (AMC) Aircraft on static display must be made safe according to AFI 11-209,
   Attachment 3, applicable technical orders (TO) and Attachments 4 and 5, this supplement.
   4.1.2. A minimum of one qualified aircrew member must be present to answer spectator
   questions and to ensure security at all times the static display is open to the public.
   4.1.3. Ordnance and Munitions. If an event does not involve the expenditure or display of
   munitions, download the aircraft of all expendable ordnance prior to deploying to the event
   site. “Make safe” permanently mounted internal weapons according to applicable TO
   procedures. Place on public display only inert munitions, making them safe according to
   applicable TOs.
   4.1.3. (AMC) Ordnance and Munitions.          Make safe DS-equipped aircraft according to
   Attachment 5, this supplement.
4.2. Flyover
4.2. (AMC) Flyover.An AMC flyover will normally consist of a straight and level, single-ship,
single pass flight profile crossing over the flyover target. A formation up to a four-ship is
authorized. The flyover approach will be a normal glide path descent to the flyover ground track
followed by a departure from the area best described as a normal climb-out attitude (for KC-135
and KC-10, do not exceed pitch attitude as displayed by the command bars). Maximum bank
angle is 45 degrees for a flyover (para 1.6.8, this supplement) and while aligning for the flyover
or departing the area. The axis of aircraft approach and departure must be along the designated
show-line or approved ground track. The flyover ground track should coincide with the show
line appropriate for the FAA aircraft category at events where spectator areas and show lines are
established, unless specifically authorized to deviate by the Air Boss or other controlling agency
(see para 1.6.7, this supplement). Normally, an event organizer will superimpose the show line
on the primary runway, if possible. See para 5.1.4, this supplement, for USAFA flyover
guidance.
36                                                  AFI11-209_AMCSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2009


     4.2.1. Patriotic Holiday. Participation approval is at the MAJCOM level and is limited to
     a single pass flyover by a single aircraft or by a formation of not more than four aircraft of
     the same type. The commemorative event for which the flyover is performed must occur
     within seven days of the national day of observance of the holiday and must be in direct
     support of the holiday.
     4.2.1. (AMC) Patriotic Holiday. AMC/PA is the “event approval” authority for requests
     from event organizers to AMC wings to perform flyovers supporting commemorative events
     associated with Patriotic Holidays—for flyover participation approval, see Attachment 2,
     this supplement.
     4.2.2. Retirement/Change of Command Ceremony. Participation approval is at the
     MAJCOM level. AF/CV approval may be required for exceptions-to-policy (see paragraph
     3.6.2.2.6).
     4.2.3. Funeral or Memorial Flyovers. It is the responsibility of the MAJCOM to locate
     and identify volunteer flying units. MAJCOM can delegate participation approval authority
     to a lower level. Air Force participation in a funeral or memorial service is limited to a
     single flyover. It may be flown at the funeral (internment) service or at the memorial service,
     but not at both events (except as approved under paragraph 3.6.2.3.4, where the MAJCOM
     can approve an additional memorial flyover for eligible members at the base to which the
     individual was assigned). Funeral flyovers can be a single ship or a single formation with a
     maximum of four aircraft. A formation flyover may be flown as a missing man formation
     (inform HQ USAF/A3OO).
     4.2.3. (AMC) Funeral or Memorial Flyovers. When requested by HAF, 618 TACC/XOB
     (POC: XOBL) will solicit AMC flying units for volunteers and task to conduct funeral or
     memorial flyovers. See Attachment 2, this supplement, for AMC participation approval
     levels for funeral or memorial flyovers. AMC participation in a funeral or memorial service
     is limited to a single flyover—it may be flown at the funeral (interment) service or at the
     memorial service, but not at both (except as approved under AFI 11-209, para 3.6.2.3.4.—an
     AMC WG/CC can approve an additional on-station memorial flyover for an eligible member
     who was assigned to the wing if a flyover was already flown for the individual’s off-base
     interment service).
        4.2.3.1. (Added-AMC) Funeral/Memorial Flyovers—.                 When planning a
        funeral/memorial flyover at Arlington National Cemetery (which is located in the NCR),
        contact ACC/A3OA as soon as practical (para 2.6.1, this supplement). See Attachment
        1, this supplement for the definition of NCR. , alone among national cemeteries, is
        considered to be an “on-base” facility—it falls under the operational jurisdiction of the
        US Army. All other national cemeteries are operated by non-DOD agencies and are
        considered to be “off-base.” IAW Attachment 2, this supplement, the WG/CC is the
        participation approval authority for an assigned aircrew flying an assigned aircraft
        conducting a single-ship funeral/memorial “on-base” flyover (this applies to flyovers at
        Arlington) when the deceased member is eligible for a flyover IAW AFI 11-209, para
        3.6.2.3.; notwithstanding, funeral/memorial flyovers approved IAW exception-to-policy
        procedures require AMC/A3 participation approval.
AFI11-209_AMCSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2009                                                                 37


       4.2.3.2. (Added-AMC) HQ AMC/A1S validates the eligibility of deceased members
       for AMC-supported memorial or funeral flyovers. Contact HQ AMC//A1S/A3OO// for
       assistance in obtaining information and approvals from HQ USAF/A3.
   4.2.4. Missing Man Formation. Participation approval for on-base and off-base Patriotic
   Holidays (IAW paragraph 3.6.2.4) is at the MAJCOM level. All other off-base uses of the
   missing man formation require the approval of MAJCOM/A3 (cannot be delegated).
   4.2.4. (AMC) Missing Man Formation. The missing man formation is not flown by AMC
   aircrews.
   4.2.5. (Added-AMC) NCR Flyovers. ACC will provide an ACT to control all flyovers
   supporting events hosted at venues in the NCR. AMC aircrews volunteering to perform
   funeral/memorial flyovers at , which is located within the NCR, must contact HQ
   ACC/A3OA as soon as practical. ACC/A3O will provide participating crews detailed
   information on the flying procedures covering Arlington funeral/memorial flyovers: ACT
   procedures/frequencies, air traffic control agencies/frequencies, event timing, arrival
   procedures, holding patterns and altitudes, routes of flight (altitude/airspeed), flyover ground
   track/altitude, departure procedures, etc. (see para 2.6.1, this supplement).
   4.2.6. (Added-AMC) Operational Criteria—Flyovers. Flyover altitude is addressed in para
   1.6.3.2., 1.6.3.3., and 5.1.4., all in this supplement. For flyover airspeed, see para 1.6.4, this
   supplement. All units will confirm with event organizers (i.e., Air Operations Officers or Air
   Bosses) that applicable federal aviation regulations waivers (speed and altitude) have been
   obtained from the local flight standards district office (FSDO) before accomplishing any
   flyovers at less than 1000 feet above the highest obstacle or at airspeeds greater than 250
   KIAS.
   4.2.7. (Added-AMC) Multiple Flyovers/Dissimilar Flyovers. For multiple flyovers for a
   single public event, see AFI 11-209, para 1.4.3.2., and para 3.6.3.2, this supplement. For
   dissimilar flyovers, see para 5.3, this supplement. An AMC aircraft in a “multiple flyover”
   arrangement or in a dissimilar formation will not be operated closer than one nautical mile to
   a preceding aircraft and should remain under radar control or monitoring to the extent
   practical.
4.3. Aerial Review. After OASD/PA event approval (if required), the level of participation
approval is as follows:
4.3. (AMC) Aerial Review.AMC//CC/A3// approval for the execution of an aerial review
supporting a military or public event includes approval for the participating aircrew to conduct
practice flights.
   4.3.1. Assets from Single MAJCOM. Aerial reviews involving assets from a single
   MAJCOM require MAJCOM approval. MAJCOMs will inform HQ USAF/A3OO of aerial
   review approvals and assets involved (other than airshows, Open Houses and trade shows).
   4.3.2. Assets from Multiple MAJCOMs. Multi-MAJCOM aerial reviews require the
   approval of each command providing aircraft for the aerial review (inform HQ
   USAF/A3OO).
   4.3.3. Assets from Multiple Services/Nations, or Involve Civilian Aircraft. H Q
   U S A F / A 3 / 5 approval is required for all aerial reviews that combine USAF aircraft with
38                                                 AFI11-209_AMCSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2009


     aircraft from other services or nations or with civilian aircraft. Participation approval in
     OCONUS aerial reviews rests with the COCOM (inform HQ USAF/A3OO).
4.4. Aerial Demonstration. Aerial demonstrations are governed by the AFI 11-246 series of
instructions and require the participation approval of the owning MAJCOM.
4.4. (AMC) Aerial Demonstration.Operational flying procedures and limitations for aerial
demonstrations are specified in AFI 11-246, Volume 6, and the AMC CONOPS implementing
AFI 11-246V6—AMC/A3 is the participation approval authority in virtually every case as noted
in Attachment 2, this supplement. A3 approval for the performance of an aerial demonstration
supporting a military or public event includes approval for the participating aircrew to conduct
practice flights.
     4.4.1. Lead MAJCOMs need not publish in their assigned volume the profiles that are
     uniquely tailored for a specific military or civilian event and which are planned for use
     on a one-time basis. Although the lead MAJCOM is released from the requirement to
     incorporate these uniquely tailored profiles in the command volume, the MAJCOM/A3 (or
     equivalent) having jurisdiction over the participating aircrew and aircraft must approve
     every uniquely tailored profile prior to its execution. If the uniquely tailored profile is
     planned to be used on a continuing basis, then the MAJCOM must submit the profile to the
     lead MAJCOM for possible inclusion in AFI 11-246 series.
     4.4.1. (AMC) For a uniquely tailored aerial demonstration profile planned for a specific
     military or public event and intended to be flown by an AMC aircrew on a one-time-basis,
     refer to AFI 11-246, Vol 6, para 1.5., and the AMC CONOPS implementing AFI 11-246,
     Vol 6, para 3.2.
     4.4.2. MAJCOMs may publish profiles in the MAJCOM supplement to this instruction
     for flight operations or procedures falling outside the purview of the applicable AFI 11-246
     series.
     4.4.3. Aerial demonstration profiles, for any aircraft that is not covered under the AFI 11-
     246 series, must be approved by the MAJCOM/CC owning the aircraft. This will not be
     delegated. MAJCOM approved profiles can consist of multiple passes.
     4.4.4. AFPT demonstrations can be performed for commemorative events supporting
     Patriotic holidays instead of flyovers—participation approval is at the MAJCOM.
     4.4.4. (AMC) AMC/A3 is the participation approval authority (except as noted in para 5.4,
     this supplement) for an AMC wing to airdrop an AFPT, in lieu of conducting an authorized
     flyover, to support a commemorative event in conjunction with a Patriotic Holiday. The
     AFPT, itself, is responsible for obtaining authorization from its parent organization to
     perform the actual parachute demonstration jump.
     4.4.5. AFPT demonstrations supporting retirement/change of command ceremonies in lieu
     of authorized flyovers are allowed—participation approval is at the MAJCOM.
     4.4.5. (AMC) AMC/A3 is the participation approval authority (except as noted in para 5.4,
     this supplement) for an AMC wing to airdrop an AFPT, in lieu of conducting an authorized
     flyover, to support a retirement/change of command ceremony. The AFPT, itself, is
     responsible for obtaining authorization from its parent organization to perform the actual
     parachute demonstration jump.
AFI11-209_AMCSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2009                                                               39


   4.4.6. (Added-AMC) JA/ATT missions, SAAM and TWCF channel missions may offer
   wings opportunities to provide aerial demonstrations (personnel and/or equipment airdrop)
   for military or public events at reduced O&M outlays (see para 2.4.4, this supplement).
   4.4.7. (Added-AMC) Do not perform personnel or equipment airdrops if the flight path of
   the airdrop aircraft is over or behind spectator stands or congested areas near the drop zone.
   If the release point or flight path of the airdrop aircraft is within 100 yards of the viewing
   stands, cancel the airdrop or adjust the point of impact. The restrictions in this paragraph do
   not apply to high-altitude, low-opening (HALO) personnel airdrops.
   4.4.8. (Added-AMC) Air Refueling (AR) Demonstration—Proximity of Receiver. An
   aerial performance involving a refueling aircraft and a receiver will not be conducted with
   the receiver closer to the tanker than the pre-contact position.
       4.4.8.1. (Added-AMC) Pre-Contact Position. In the pre-contact position, the receiver
       aircraft is positioned approximately 50 feet from the tip of the tanker’s deployed
       refueling boom (but no closer) on an imaginary line formed as an extension of the boom.
       The deployed boom will be flown at 30 degrees elevation and extended 10 feet for the
       KC-135, or 12 feet for the KC-10.
       4.4.8.2. (Added-AMC) The tanker aircraft will fly an altitude such that the receiver
       aircraft will operate no lower than 1500’ above the highest obstacle along the route of
       flight when in the pre-contact position.
       4.4.8.3. (Added-AMC) Comply with airspeed limitations specified in para 1.6.4, this
       supplement. KC-135 aircrews will also comply with the airspeed limitations associated
       with both low-altitude operations (LAO) and very low-altitude operations (VLAO).
       Tanker and receiver aircrews will coordinate airspeeds for air refueling demonstrations in
       advance.
4.5. (Added-AMC) Units Requesting Aviation Support For On-Station Events. Units
seeking aviation support from other AMC bases, from other Air Force Commands, from other
military services, or from foreign countries for their military or on-station public events will
follow the procedures at Attachment 8, this supplement (see para 5.2, this supplement).
   4.5.1. (Added-AMC) Open House Events. AMC units seeking aerial demonstration teams
   to support Open House events are to follow the procedures in AFI 35-101, para 8.11. The
   procedure entails using a DD Form 2535, Request For Military Aerial Support,” which
   should be submitted to HQ AMC/PA (cc: AMC/A3OO) not later than mid-July of the
   calendar year preceding the Open House events.
   4.5.2. (Added-AMC) Civilian Air Show Acts—Open House Events. WG/CCs are the
   approval authorities for civilian air show flying acts and static displays supporting their Open
   House events IAW AFI 35-101, para 8.22..
4.6. (Added-AMC) Participation Approval Process. Units may consider providing aviation
support for any military or public event that has been granted event approval. Aviation support
proposed for any event should take into consideration the community and public affairs impact,
flying hours required to support the event, operational and training requirements, aircraft and
crew availability, host airfield limitations, AGE availability and compatibility, and security
requirements. The process used to gain participation approval at both the wing level and HQ
40                                                  AFI11-209_AMCSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2009


AMC level must ensure that the aviation support being planned for a military or public event is
fully described, well documented and clearly approved at each step in the approval process.
Attention to detail serves numerous goals, among which are these: 1) Safety—the project officer
must clearly communicate in writing the nature/substance of the aviation support proposed (if it
cannot be clearly described, it is probably unsafe to fly; 2) Responsibility—leadership at each
level must clearly understand what is, and is not, being proposed for approval, and under what
conditions; 3) Accountability—the aircraft commander’s decisions / actions carry significant
liable [the A/C must be fully aware of what was, and was not, approved (see para 2.4.9, this
supplement)]; 4) Archival responsibilities—good documentation is essential for good
management and effective leadership, and to record the unit’s history.
     4.6.1. (Added-AMC) General Procedures—Participation Approval Process. Once the wing
     has decided to provide aviation support for an event, a Project Officer is appointed who will
     notify the event sponsor and appropriate AF or AMC organizations of the wing’s intention
     (comply with AFI 11-209, para 3.4.1., and para 3.4.1, this supplement, as applicable). The
     Project Officer then prepares a Staff Summary Sheet (SSS) with supporting documents as
     tabs and attachments (i.e., an Aviation Support Package) to staff the wing’s aviation support
     proposal through wing leadership for coordination and approval. The SSS and supporting
     documents are to be electronic, digit files and will be transmitted between agencies by e-
     mail. The SSS can be an IMT form, an MS Word file or an e-mail prepared in SSS format.
     Attachment 9, this supplement, addresses the SSS content. Refer to the Project Officer’s
     Guide (POG) on the AMC/A3O web page for example SSS formats.
     4.6.2. (Added-AMC) Procedures—WG/CC Is Participation Approval Authority. As a
     general rule, the WG/CC grants participation approval for static displays and single-ship
     flyovers planned for military events (non-ETP military events only) or on-base public events
     when using organic assets (see Attachment 2, this supplement). The WG/CC is the
     participation approval authority for an assigned aircrew using an assigned aircraft as a “jump
     platform” for the USAFA parachute demonstration team, the Wings of Blue (WOB). This
     level of approval authority applies regardless of the specific event or venue supported (Ref
     para 5.4., this supplement). Requests for WG/CC participation approval are to follow the
     procedures at Attachment 9, this supplement.
        4.6.2.1. (Added-AMC) Following WG/CC participation approval, the Project Officer
        submits an information copy of the wing approved Aviation Support Package to
        AMC/A3OO (Attachment 2, Note 24, this supplement). This should be forwarded at
        least 14 days prior to the date of the supportedevent.
        4.6.2.2. (Added-AMC) AMC/A3OO will distribute information copies of the wing
        approved Aviation Support Package to AMC/A3O, AMC/PA Public Affairs, AMC/A3V,
        and 18 AF/CCE. Additionally, AMC/A3OO will cc AMC/A1SR, for a funeral or
        memorial flyover, and Scott AFB AFOSI/DO, if the supported event is hosted at a
        domestic venue (tel: 618 256-6109 // e-mail: Region3.do@scott.af.mil).
     4.6.3. (Added-AMC) Procedures—AMC/A3 Is Participation Approval Authority. As a
     general rule, the AMC/A3 is the participation approval authority, with few exceptions, for
     the following (see Attachment 2, this supplement): 1) Off-base static displays and off-base
     flyovers; 2) Aerial reviews, aerial demonstrations and formation flyovers, whether flown for
     on-base or off-base events; and 3) Aerial performances flown for ETP-approved events.
AFI11-209_AMCSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2009                                                            41


  Wings volunteering to provide aviation support for an approved event requiring AMC/A3
  participation approval must immediately notify AMC//A3OO/PA// by e-mail that the unit has
  volunteered; include the name (and date/time) of the event, and a statement that the unit’s
  request for participation approval will follow (provide estimate). Early notification is
  particularly important when the unit has volunteered with little time remaining prior to event
  occurrence. Requests for AMC/A3 participation approval are to follow the procedures at
  Attachment 9, this supplement. Wing Project Officers are to forward their Aviation Support
  Packages, following wing coordination and WG/CC concurrence, by e-mail to HQ
  AMC/A3OO for AMC/A3 participation approval not later than 30 days prior to the event.
  When unable to meet this suspense, please provide an explanation in the e-mail body.
     4.6.3.1. (Added-AMC) AMC/A3OO will distribute/forward the wing Aviation Support
     Package as follows to initiate the HQ AMC three-digit coordination process that leads to
     AMC/A3 approval:
         4.6.3.1.1. (Added-AMC) Three-Digit Information Addressees: AMC/PA Public
         Affairs; 18 AF/CCE; TACC/XOB; and, when the supported event is hosted at a
         domestic venue, Scott AFB AFOSI/DO (tel: 618 256-6109 // e-mail:
         Region3.do@scott.af.mil). Other organizations may be provided information copies,
         depending upon the nature of the aviation support proposal and the event to be
         supported.
         4.6.3.1.2. (Added-AMC) Three-Digit Coordination Addressees: AMC/A3V;
         AMC/A3D, when tactics are involved; AMC/A2A and AMC/A2O, when the
         supported event is hosted at a venue outside the ; and, AMC/A1SR (i.e., AMC
         Manpower and Personnel, Services Operations, Requirements-Mortuary Affairs),
         when a funeral or memorial service flyover is involved. Other organizations may be
         asked to coordination, depending upon the nature of the aviation support proposal and
         the event to be supported.
     4.6.3.2. (Added-AMC) AMC/A3OO will consolidate three-digit inputs, resolve issues
     and forward the wing Aviation Support Package to AMC/A3 for approval (cc: ).
     4.6.3.3. (Added-AMC) Requests for AMC/A3 participation approval submitted to
     AMC/A3OO within 48 hours of an event are problematic and, depending upon workload,
     the participating WG/CC may have to contact AMC/A3 directly by telephone for
     approval.
     4.6.3.4. (Added-AMC) When the participation approval decision is made by AMC/A3,
     AMC/A3OO will notify the following personnel and organizations: Appropriate
     personnel/offices at HAF; The personnel/offices listed in para 4.6.3.1.1 and 4.6.3.1.2,
     this supplement (other HQ AMC staff members, if appropriate); and, the participating
     WG/CC and appropriate wing staff/aircrew. AMC/A3OO will ensuring that any
     restrictions, limitations or modifications made during the approval process to the original
     wing Aviation Support Package are clearly communicated to the participating flying unit,
     and to the personnel/organizations identified in this paragraph. AMC/A3OO will archive
     a copy of the wing’s Aviation Support Package for HQ AMC; the wing will archive a
     copy, as well.

     4.6.4. (Added-AMC) Procedures—When Participation Approval Is Above AMC/A3. For
     participation approval requests requiring an approval level higher than AMC/A3 (i.e.,
     AMC//CV/CC// or HAF), the participating wing Project Officer, AMC/A3OO and the
     AMC/A3 Executive Officers will coordinate in preparing the wing Aviation Support Package
     for coordination/approval—a paper copy of the package may be required at the headquarters
     level (OPR: AMC/A3OO). Generally speaking, the procedures outlined in para 4.6.3, this
     supplement, apply with only minor modification required to the coordination/approval and
     notification processes.

                                 ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE

5.1. USAF Academy (USAFA) On-Base Events. All definitions and policy regarding
flyovers and aerial reviews apply to the USAFA. Examples of approved on-base academy
events are graduation ceremonies, football games, parades, ceremonies with a
patriotic/military theme, etc. The commandant requests appropriate Air Force participation,
which is limited to flyovers, parachute demonstrations and glider demonstrations.
5.1. (AMC) USAF (USAFA) On-Base Events.AMC aviation support for USAFA events is
limited to flyovers and aerial demonstrations involving personnel airdrops, only. For a proposal
involving AMC participation in an aerial review, the AMC wing Project Officer will apprise
AMC/A3O as soon as practical (i.e., notify AMC/A3OO once the basic operational details are
known and prior to working the wing coordination/approval package)—AMC/A3OO will work
the request directly with AF/A3OO.
   5.1.1. Academy officials will notify participating MAJCOMs when flyovers are scheduled
   by more than one MAJCOM on the same day. Participation must be approved by the owning
   MAJCOM. When more than one flyover is scheduled within any three hour period, this
   notification will include as a minimum: flyover timing, number of aircraft in each flight,
   direction of flight, altitude, USAFA point of contact, and other information deemed
   necessary for safety of flight.
   5.1.1. (AMC) Project Officers for AMC flying units planning USAFA flyovers are to
   contact 306 OSS/OSF (DSN 333-4617 / 9522), USAFA, to ascertain whether or not flyovers
   are scheduled by more than one MAJCOM on the same day. When more than one flyover is
   scheduled within any three hour period, the Project Officer will obtain the following
   information, at a minimum, for all flyover participants: flyover timing, number of aircraft in
   each flight, direction of flight, altitude, USAFA point of contact, and other information
   deemed necessary for safety of flight. The Project Officers will include this information in
   the wing SSS coordination/approval packages for flyover participation approval.
   5.1.2. For each event, the flyover will consist of not more than four aircraft of the same type
   making one pass.
   5.1.2. (AMC) See para 4.2, this supplement, for AMC flyover guidance.
   5.1.3. USAFA officials will notify HQ USAF/A3OO, SAF/PAN and SAF/PAM 10 days
   before the event date of any flyover that may have national media coverage (i.e., coverage of
   a football game or graduation).
   5.1.3. (AMC) Project Officers for wings planning aviation support for USAFA events that
   may have national media coverage of their supporting flyovers or aerial demonstrations
   (personnel airdrop) are to apprise AMC/A3O (POC AMC/A3OO) and to ensure their wing
   coordination/approval Aviation Support Packages are so annotated—306 OSS/OSF,
   USAFA, can provide information on media coverage.
   5.1.4. (Added-AMC) USAFA Flyovers. 306 OSS/OSF, USAFA, has standardized the
   flight profiles for flyovers of significant locations at the USAFA: the Cadet Area, Falcon
   Stadium, the Parade Field, etc. The flight profiles define the ground tracks, headings,
44                                                   AFI11-209_AMCSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2009


     altitudes, navigational references, radio frequencies, controlling agencies, etc., applicable to
     executing flyovers of the target locations—contact the 306 OSS/OSF (DSN 333-4617 /
     9522) and refer to the Academy’s web site for information. USAFA holds waivers with the
     Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and Headquarters Air Force Flight Standards
     Agency (HQ AFFSA) allowing military aircraft performing USAFA flyovers to descend to
     500' AGL at specific (target) locations along USAFA approved flyover flight profiles.
     Where authorized to descend to 500’ AGL, do not operate an AMC aircraft lower than 500
     feet above the highest obstacle. The 306 OSS/OSF will provide the Aerial Control Team
     (ACT) for all flyovers at USAFA—the ACT may direct higher minimum flyover altitudes.
     5.1.5. (Added-AMC) Participation Approval—Aviation Support for USAFA Events.
     WG/CCs are the participation approval authorities for their assigned aircrews flying assigned
     aircraft conducting single-ship flyovers or conducting aerial demonstrations (personnel
     airdrop) involving the USAFA WOB (see para 4.6.2.). AMC/A3 is the participation
     approval authority for formation flyovers, aerial reviews or aerial demonstrations (personnel
     airdrop) involving any parachutists other than the WOB. See Attachment 2, this
     supplement.
5.2. MAJCOM-to-MAJCOM Flyover Requests. Requests from one MAJCOM to another
for single-ship or formation flyovers in support of military events are approved by the
MAJCOM owning the requested assets.
5.2. (AMC) MAJCOM-to-MAJCOM Flyover Requests.See para 4.5 and Attachment 8,
this supplement.
     5.2.1. Within the USAF, requests for Air Force participation in a military event must be
     sent from requesting unit (base) to its parent MAJCOM and, if approved, from the parent
     MAJCOM to the MAJCOM owning the requested aircraft, except for requests supporting
     an open house. For an open house, the requesting unit may send a request for participation
     directly to the unit owning the desired aircraft or equipment; the owning unit will ensure all
     coordination/approval requirements imposed by the owning MAJCOM are satisfied before
     committing support.
     5.2.2. Air Force units are to follow MAJCOM-to-MAJCOM procedures when requesting
     aircraft from the US Army, Navy, or Marine Corps. For MAJCOM-to-MAJCOM
     requests, include HQ USAF/A3OO and SAF/PAN as information addressees whenever the
     approval level involves any of the following: HQ USAF/CV, HQ USAF/CVA, HQ
     USAF/A3/5, HQ USAF/A3O, SAF/AQ or OASD/PA.
5.3. Dissimilar Formation. Formations of four or fewer aircraft of multiple MDS and the same
type are approved by MAJCOM/A3. Formations of four or fewer aircraft comprised of Air Force
aircraft with aircraft from other services or nations, or with civilian aircraft that do not meet
aerial review criteria (i.e., airshows, open houses or international trade shows) require
MAJCOM/CC approval (inform HQ USAF/ A3OO for HQ USAF/CC and A3/5 visibility). It
is incumbent upon MAJCOMs to provide operational oversight when approving mixed MDS
formations of the same type. ACC Supplement 1 to AFI 11-246, Volume 1 covers ACC
Heritage Flight formations and AFI 11-246, Volume 2 covers AETC Texan Flight formations.
5.3. (AMC) Dissimilar Formation.AMC dissimilar formations (i.e., four or fewer aircraft of
multiple MDS but of the same type) require AMC/A3 participation approval. Formations of four
AFI11-209_AMCSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2009                                                                 45


or fewer aircraft comprised of AMC aircraft with aircraft from other services or nations, or with
civilian aircraft require AMC/CC approval (inform HQ USAF/A3OO for HQ USAF/CC and
A3/5 visibility). See AFI 11-209, Attachment 1, Terms, for the definitions for dissimilar
formation and type.
5.4. Air Force Parachute Team (AFPT). Event and participation approval for an AFPT
demonstration (i.e., by the United States Air Force Academy’s “Wings of Blue”) is granted using
the same procedures as a flyover (IAW Chapter 3 and Chapter 4). Air Force aircraft serving as
jump platforms for AFPT demonstrations at public or military events, do not require separate
approval. Event approval for the AFPT constitutes approval for the jump platform.
5.4. (AMC) Air Force Parachute Team (AFPT).IAW para 4.6.2, this supplement, the
WG/CC is the participation approval authority for an assigned aircrew using an assigned aircraft
as a “jump platform” for the USAFA parachute demonstration team, the Wings of Blue (WOB).
This level of approval authority applies regardless of the specific event or venue supported.
When requesting participation approval, the aircrew will follow the procedures in para 4.6, this
supplement—fully staff WOB “jump platform” proposals with the same rigor applicable to any
aerial demonstration (personnel airdrop) proposal. A personnel airdrop by an AMC aircrew
supporting a military or public event at any venue that involves any parachutists other than the
WOB is an aerial demonstration (“personnel airdrop”), requiring participation approval as
specified in AFI 11-209, para 4.4. and para 4.4., this supplement—AMC/A3 is the approval
authority.
NOTE: If the aircraft serving as the jump platform is separately performing at the event (i.e.
additional flyover or aerial demonstration), then separate approval is required. For aircraft serving
as jump platforms supporting other service parachute team demonstrations, the “event
approval” for the aircraft is in conjunction with the approval for the parachute team (inform
SAF/PAN and HQ USAF/A3OO). Owning MAJCOM may still require participation approval
for their “jump platform” aircraft.
5.5. Record Flights and Flights of a Spectacular Nature. Flights of this nature require
SAF/PAN and HQ USAF/A3O approval. See AFI 35-101, Chapter 8 for additional restrictions.
5.6. Test Aircraft. Aerial events of any kind, including static displays, involving aircraft or
equipment undergoing testing in a research and development program require approval from
SAF/PAN, HQ USAF/ A3/5, and SAF/AQ.
5.7. Heritage/Texan Flight Training Programs. The following guidance applies to the ACC
Heritage Flight and AETC Texan Flight Training programs.
   5.7.1. The intent of the annual training program is to prepare Air Force aircrews and vintage
   aircraft pilots to safely fly in formation at public airshows and open house events that
   benefit Air Force recruiting and community relations programs. Appropriated funds may be
   expended for warbird aviation fuel associated with that training. Because warbird pilots and
   support staff are acting in an official capacity related to DoD activities, use of invitational
   travel orders to pay travel, per diem, lodging and local transportation is also permitted as
   specified in the Joint Travel Regulation, Volume II, Appendix E. MAJCOM approved
   Blanket Purchase Agreements with contractors may be used to cover expenses.
   5.7.2. MAJCOMs will ensure compliance with applicable AFIs including AFI 11-401,
   Aviation Management. Military aircrew members and key military leadership may fly on
46                                                  AFI11-209_AMCSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2009


     warbird civil aircraft during training sessions. Military media personnel and civilian media
     personnel (as part of an approved media orientation flight IAW AFI 35-101) may fly as
     passengers on those warbirds engaged in observation flights provided the aircraft are not
     engaged in demonstration training or formation flights. Training is to take place over
     unpopulated areas. All warbirds must have liability insurance covering training flights and
     passengers.
     5.7.3. This guidance covers all training conferences and annual preseason flight training
     conducted in accordance with AFI 11-246. Secretary of Defense and CSAF policies
     regarding civilian pilots operating USAF aircraft still apply, unless specifically waived.
5.8. Airshows/Open Houses. The term “open house“ identifies a traditional activity held on
military installations while the term “airshow” identifies a civilian activity. Open house and
airshow have been used interchangeably in the past, but open house is a more comprehensive
term for the spectrum of events in the Air Force. Airshows and open houses may be supported
by multiple static displays, multiple flyovers (with multiple passes) and multiple aerial
demonstrations. AFI 10-1004 (when released) will provide guidance and procedures for
planning and conducting Air Force open houses. SAF/PA approves civilian airshows for Air
Force support (event approval lAW paragraph 3.2) and MAJCOMs approve the participation of
their respective aircraft.
5.9. Overseas Public and Military Events. For public events outside the United States,
Canada and Mexico, the combatant commanders exercise event and participation approval over
events falling within their respective Areas of Responsibility (AOR) (except as noted below). The
combatant commanders may delegate the responsibility for event and participation approval.
The delegates will notify SAF/PAN and HQ USAF/A3OO of their delegated authority. See
paragraph 5.10 for event and participation approval for international airshow and trade
exhibitions.
     5.9.1. MAJCOMs will inform HQ USAF/A3OO and SAF/PAN when CONUS based
     aircraft will participate in overseas events (public or military) at least 30 days prior to the
     event for CSAF visibility. Additionally, inform HQ USAF/A3OO and SAF/PAN for any
     USAF aircraft participation in overseas events at non-DoD facilities at least 30 days prior
     to the event for CSAF visibility. lf the request from the event is short notice, precluding a
     30-day notification, inform HQ USAF/A3OO and SAF/PAN immediately. Responsibility for
     this notification is primarily with the owning MAJCOM, but notification may come from
     the OCONUS MAJCOM. HQ USAF or OASD/PA approval may be required in some cases
     where CONUS based aircraft participate in overseas events.
     5.9.1. (AMC) AMC/A3O (OPR A3OO) will apprise HQ USAF/A3OO and SAF/PAN
     when a CONUS-based AMC aircraft will participate in an overseas event, whether the event
     is military or public, hosted on a DoD or non-DoD facility, at least 30 days prior to event
     start-date to permit CSAF visibility. If a request for AMC aviation support from an event
     organizer, or sponsor, of an overseas event is of short notice, precluding 30-day notification,
     AMC/A3OO will apprise HQ USAF/A3OO and SAF/PAN immediately, as information
     becomes available, that AMC is considering participation or has made the decision to
     participate. AMC units planning aviation support for an overseas event (public or military),
     or considering aviation support for a short-notice request from an event organizer to
     participate in such an overseas event, must apprise AMC/A3OO as soon as practical to
AFI11-209_AMCSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2009                                                               47


   permit A3OO time to meet the reporting requirements in this paragraph and elsewhere in
   AFI 11-209.
   5.9.2. Aerial Reviews at overseas events with assets from multiple services or nations, or that
   involve civilian aircraft, will be approved lAW paragraph 4.3 in addition to combatant
   command directives (inform HQ USAF/A3OO).
   5.9.3. Notwithstanding the combatant commanders’ participation approval authority over
   aircraft entering their respective AORs, the owning MAJCOMs’ operational control over
   their aircraft is not preempted or diminished.
   5.9.4. Aerial events of any kind involving aircraft or equipment undergoing testing in a
   research and development program require approval from SAF/PAN, HQ USAF/A3, and
   SAF/AQ.
5.10. International Airshows and Trade Exhibitions. This paragraph applies to USAF
direct participation at international airshows and trade exhibitions, organized primarily for
promoting sales of aerospace and other defense products (lAW DoDD 7230.8). For
international airshows and other events that are organized only for the demonstration or display
of aircraft and other defense equipment in support of public affairs activities, see paragraph 5.9.
5.10. (AMC) International Airshows and Trade Exhibitions.AMC/A3 is OPR (POC:
AMC/A3O) for AMC participation in international air shows and trade exhibitions (see para
1.1.6 and 2.4.4, this supplement).
   5.10.1. Under Secretary of Defense for Policy (USD(P)) has approval authority for DoD
   participation in international airshows and trade exhibitions, as delegated by the
   Secretary of Defense. No Air Force organization can participate in an international airshow
   or trade exhibition unless the USD(P) has approved “direct DoD participation” and
   satisfied the other provisions of the law. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency
   (DSCA), staff agency for USD(P), posts policy, guidelines, and status information on
   international airshows and trade exhibitions on its web site (http://www.dsca.osd.mil).
   5.10.2. Geographic combatant commanders, through their Air Force component
   commanders, and in conjunction with the US Embassy country team, implement USD(P)
   airshow policy and initiate requests for participation.
   5.10.3. The Deputy Under Secretary of the Air Force, lnternational Affairs (SAF/lA)
   coordinates Headquarters Air Force actions, to include politico-military analysis, validation
   of requirements Law USAF Security Cooperation Guidance, identification of USAF assets
   requested, and coordination with industry.
   5.10.4. Additionally, HQ USAF/A3OO will submit the lists of requested USAF assets to
   the MAJCOMs to determine operational impact and to coordinate participation of assets
   from outside the requesting geographic combatant commander’s AOR. During this process,
   HQ USAF/A3O reconciles the asset requests against the MAJCOM’s operational
   concerns, develops requirement lists (with USAF senior leadership positions), and tasks
   support as required.
   5.10.4. (AMC) AMC/A3O is OPR (POC: AMC/A3OO) to coordinate AF/A3OO requests
   for AMC aviation support and follow-on taskings.
48                                               AFI11-209_AMCSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2009


     5.10.5. MAJCOMs with units planning to participate in international airshows and trade
     exhibitions must first coordinate with DSCA via SAF/IA. This is normally accomplished
     during periodic teleconferences hosted by DSCA. Planning and execution details are
     developed by the MAJCOMs during this conference.
     5.10.5. (AMC) AMC units considering aviation support for an international air show and
     trade exhibition must apprise AMC/A3OO as soon as practical—618 TACC/XOBL is OPR
     for obtaining aviation support IAW para 1.1.6 and 2.4.4, this supplement. AMC/A3O will
     coordinate AMC aviation support with DSCA via SAF/IA, comply with reporting
     requirements established in AFI 11-209 and this supplement, and represent AMC at DSCA-
     hosted teleconferences applicable to international air shows and trade exhibitions (POC:
     AMC/A3OO). Participating wings will track and report costs associated with international
     air and trade exhibitions IAW guidance from the Defense Security Cooperation Agency
     (DSCA) (Ref: DSCA web site), or as requested by AMC/A3O (see para 1.1.6, this
     supplement).
        5.10.5.1. (Added-AMC) If HQ AMC is unable to support an international air show and
        trade exhibition when tasked, 618 TACC/XOBL may ask AFRC to solicit a unit to

Terms
NOTE:—To avoid changing traditional terminology used by the Air Force to discuss aviation
support, the Air Force term aerial event as used in this instruction is synonymous with the DoD
term aerial demonstration and the Air Force term aerial demonstration is synonymous with the
DoD term aerial activity.
Aerial Control Team (ACT)—A qualified individual or team of individuals who oversee and
control USAF aerial participation, and aerial participation by other organizations, in selected
public or military events. ACT can be used synonymously with Ground Liaison Officer
(GLO) for the purposes of this instruction.
Aerial Demonstration—Aerial demonstration, a subset of aviation support, includes virtually
every type of aerial participation by fixed-wing or rotary-wing aircraft in public or military
events (except aerial review and flyover): aerobatics, assault landing/takeoffs, aircraft
weapons or tactics demonstrations, USAF vintage aircraft programs, single-ship demonstration
teams, airdrop demonstrations of personnel or equipment, engine-running offload and aircraft
backing maneuvers, in-flight refueling demonstrations, AFPT performances, CSAR
demonstrations and helicopter flight demonstrations consisting of steep approach, quick-stop
landing, hovering, fire suppression, and personnel AIE. Aerial demonstration is synonymous
with the phrases aerial demo, aircraft demonstration, aircraft capabilities demonstration, and
aircraft CAPEX.
Aerial Demonstration Team—An officially designated DoD demonstration team such as
the USAF Thunderbirds, US Navy Blue Angels, and US Army Golden Knights, etc. This
term can be applied to USAF vintage aircraft (ACC Heritage Flight Program and AETC T-6A
Texan II Aerial Demonstration Team) and MAJCOM single-ship demonstration teams.
Aerial Event—Aerial event, synonymous with aviation support, comprises static display,
flyover, aerial review and aerial demonstration. Aerial demonstration includes a wide variety of
aerial performances (see definition, above).
Aerial Review—Aerial review, a subset of aviation support, is a flyover of more than four
aircraft, or of multiple types of aircraft, or of aircraft representing more than one military
52                                                  AFI11-209_AMCSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2009


service or nation, regardless of horizontal/timing separation of flying elements. An aerial review
may include civilian aircraft. It may have elements in trail formation and will not involve
precision maneuvers or demonstrations. The elements of the aerial review may be
individual aircraft, formations, or a combination of individual aircraft and formations. A
single element flyover involving four or fewer aircraft of multiple MDS of the same type from
the same Military Service is not considered an aerial review.
Aircraft Demonstration—See Aerial Demonstration.
Aircraft Weapons or Tactics Demonstration—An aerial demonstration of aircraft
employing or simulating the employment of munitions, weapons, or combat tactics. May
include use of ground-based pyrotechnics for effect.
Air Force Parachute Team (AFPT) Demonstration—An aerial free-fall parachute
demonstration conducted by an official Air Force parachute demonstration team (i.e. United
States Air Force Academy’s “Wings of Blue”).
Area of Responsibifity—The geographical area associated with a commanders authority to
plan and conduct operations.
Assault Landing Demonstration—An aircraft capabilities demonstration illustrating a
technique used for landing on short runways. The aircraft is flown at a speed slightly above
aircraft stall speed and on a steeper-than-normal approach path. After touchdown, maximum
engine reverse thrust and braking are applied to stop the aircraft.
Assault (Max Performance) Takeoff Demonstration—An                     ai rcraf t  capabi l i t i e s
dem ons t rat i o n illustrating a takeoff technique used for departing short runways employing
maximum takeoff power and climb rate for the aircraft. Also referred to as Maximum
Performance Takeoff or Maximum Effort Takeoff.
Aviation Support—Aviation support, synonymous with aerial event, comprises static display,
flyover, aerial review and aerial demonstration. Aerial demonstration includes a wide variety of
aerial activities.
Capabilities Demonstration or Capabilities Exercise (CAPEX)—Normally associated with
aircraft demonstrating unique characteristics of a weapon system or group of weapon
systems. A capabilities demonstration is one that shows the aircraft conducting
maneuvers usually associated with its employment and is common to the airframe being
shown.
Civil Twilight—The period that ends in the evening when the center of the sun’s disk is 6
degrees below the horizon and begins in the morning when the center of the sun’s disk is 6
degrees below the horizon, as published in the American Air Almanac, converted to local
time. This is the limit at which twilight illumination is sufficient, under good weather
conditions, for terrestrial objects to be clearly distinguished, and the horizon is clearly
defined under good atmospheric conditions in the absence of moonlight or other illumination.
In the morning before the beginning of Civil Twilight and in the evening after the end of Civil
Twilight, artificial illumination is normally required to carry on ordinary outdoor activities.
Congested Area—Cities, towns, and settlements or the area surrounding an open-air
assembly of persons.

by one of several agencies. Event approval does not imply participation approval.
Exception—to-Policy Procedure—Procedures outlining the process to gain SAF/PA event
approval when the military or civilian event does not fall within one of the categories addressed
by DoD or AF policy. Submit such requests to SAF/PA who will route appropriate
requests to HQ USAF/A300 for coordination. See paragraph 3.2
Flight Team Demonstration—A demonstration by a DoD demonstration team such as the
USAF Air Demonstration Squadron (Thunderbirds) or the US Navy Blue Angels.
Flyover—Flyover, a subset of aviation support, is a straight and level flight limited to one pass by
a single military aircraft, or by a single formation of four or fewer military aircraft of the same
type from the same Military Service over a predetermined point on the ground at a specific time
and not involving aerobatics or demonstrations; however, bank angles of up to 90 degrees are
permissible and may be used if required to improve the spectator visibility of the aircraft.

Missing—Man Formation—A four-ship formation with the number three aircraft either
missing or performing a pull-up maneuver at a specific time in the flight.
Multiple Flyovers—A flyover arrangement for a single event in which two or more flyover
aircraft, or two or more flyover formations (or combination of flyover aircraft and flyover
formations) conduct individual flyover passes over the same reference point on the ground
regardless of timing separation between the flyover aircraft or flyover formations.
Multiple Passes—A flyover arrangement for a single event in which the flyover aircraft, or the
flyover formation, maneuvers after the initial over flight of the desired reference point so as to
execute one or more additional passes over the same point.

AFI11-209_AMCSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2009                                                                 55


Patriotic Holidays—Armed Forces Day (third Saturday in May), Memorial Day (last Monday
in May), Independence Day (4th of July), Veterans Day (11th of November), and National
POW/MIA Recognition Day (third Friday in September).
Patriotic Observances—Commemorative events held in conjunction with the patriotic
holidays. These are eligible events for Air Force participation.
Personnel Drop Demonstration—An aircraft capabilities demonstration illustrating the airdrop
of static line personnel or paratroopers.
Prisoner of War—An individual who was taken prisoner or held captive while engaged in
an action against an enemy of the United States; while engaged in military operations
involving conflict with an opposing armed force; or while serving with friendly forces
engaged in armed conflict against an opposing armed force in which the United States is not a
belligerent party. The person’s conduct, while in captivity, must have been honorable.
Public Event—Public events are community relations events not connected with the military
functioning of the Department of Defense and intended primarily for non-military audiences.
Some examples include military Open House events, ceremonies, exhibitions, expositions,
athletic contests, fairs, parades, tattoos, airshows, international airshow and trade exhibitions, or
similar programs. These events may be on or off-base; CONUS or OCONUS. Public
events can be sponsored by ei ther DoD or non-DoD organizations. Military exercises,
movements, maneuvers, or operations are not considered to be public events merely on the
basis of being incidentally observed by the general public. Such events can be good community
relations and recruiting opportunities.
Record Flights and Flights of a Spectacular Nature—A flight to achieve an official world-
class record regarding speed, distance, altitude, duration of flight, etc. National and world
aviation records conducted in the United States are sanctioned, observed, and certified through
the National Aeronautic Association.

ceremony honors a retiring military member and a change of command ceremony formally
recognizes the transfer of command authority from one military member to another (see
paragraph 3.6.2.2).
Show Line—A show line is a prominent reference line appearing on the ground in the
“Aerobatic Demonstration Area/Flying Display Area“ established for an Airshow or Open
House. The show line must be easily identifiable from the air and could be an existing
structure already present such as a runway, taxiway, canal, breakwater, or road, or any
straight line marked off by a snow fence, canvas panels, etc. The show line is a prescribed
distance from the spectator area and serves as the basic reference line for aerial demonstrations
performances.
Spectator Area—The area specifically set aside at an airshow or Open House for people to
view the aerial demonstrations performed for the event (see paragraph 1.6.7).
Static Display—Static Display, a subset of aviation support, is the ground display of any
aircraft and its related equipment not involving engine start, taxi, or flight.
Test/Evaluation Aircraft or Equipment—New aircraft or equipment undergoing
developmental test and evaluation that have not yet met initial operating capability (IOC).
56                                                 AFI11-209_AMCSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2009


Training Static Display—The ground display of any aircraft and its related equipment used for
the sole purpose of training local civilian medical, rescue, fire, or law enforcement
personnel. Training static displays do not involve engine start, taxi, or flight. Spectators will
not be allowed in the training areas. This can be on or off-base.
Type—The role of the aircraft from a public affairs perspective. DoD defines type as either
tactical, transport or rotary wing. Air Force further categorizes aircraft type as: tactical (F-22,
F-i5, F-i6, A-i0, F-ii7, B-i, B-2, B-52), tanker/transport (C-i30, C-i7, C-5, KC-i0, KC-i35),
trainer (T-i, T-37, T-38, T-6) and rotary wing (UH-i, HH-60, MH-53, CV-22). Aircraft not listed
are considered their own unique type and will comply with multi-type restrictions in this
instruction (i.e. Aerial Review or dissimilar formation). It is understood that true aircraft roles
and missions are numerous and it would be difficult to categorize all aircraft. These are general
groupings based on size, mission and/or configuration as viewed by the general public.
Individual missions and series are grouped under the same design for the purpose of this
definition (i.e. EC-130H, and C-130J). It is incumbent upon MAJCOMs to provide
operational oversight when approving mixed MDS formations of the same type.
Unit Change of Aircraft Ceremony—A ceremony that recognizes the conversion of aircraft
type within a unit.
Unit Flag Retirement Ceremony—A ceremony during which an active or air reserve
component unit is deactivated and the unit flag retired.
Unit Training Assembly (UTA)—Unit training periods consisting of a minimum of 4 hours
each, to include the majority of assigned personnel. Normally four UTAs are scheduled on
one weekend each month.
Vintage Aircraft Program—For the purpose of this instruction, the USAF vintage aircraft
programs are the Heritage Flight Program operated by ACC, and the T-6A Texan II Aerial
Demonstration Team operated by AETC.

NOTES: For Notes 1-19, refer to AFI 11-209, Attachment 2, Notes.
1. Within AMC, event and participation approval authority is delegated as posted in this matrix.
The expression “WG/CC” includes AMC commanders of airlift/tanker groups w/o parent wings
(see para 1.1.7., this supplement).
3. WG/CC is the participation approval authority for on-base static displays of assigned aircraft
(see para 3.6.2.2.7., this supplement).
8. Obtain AMC/A3 participation approval prior to requesting AF/CV approval.
12. Refer to NOTE 22, below, in this supplement.
14. If an aerial demonstration is planned for an MDS aircraft not addressed in AFI 11-246, Vol
6, AMC/CC approval is required—this may not be delegated. If the MDS aircraft is addressed
in AFI 11-246, Vol 6, then AMC/A3 approval is required (if the profile to be flown is non-
standard, follow the approval process IAW AFI 11-246, Vol 6 and the AMC CONOPS
implementing AFI 11-246, Vol 6).
20. (Added) Each participating MAJCOM will approve participation of their respective
aircrews/aircraft IAW AFI 11-209, para 4.3.—AMC/A3 approves participation for AMC.
21. (Added) The WG/CC is the participation approval authority for an assigned aircrew using
an assigned aircraft as a “jump platform” for the USAFA parachute demonstration team, the
Wings of Blue (WOB). This level of approval authority applies regardless of the specific event
or venue supported (Ref para 4.6.2. and 5.4., this supplement). Fully staff WOB “jump
platform” requests with the same rigor applicable to any aerial demonstration (personnel airdrop)
proposal—the Project Office is to forward an information copy of the WG/CC approved SSS
IAW NOTE 24, below.
22. (Added) WG/CC is the participation approval authority for single-ship flyovers performed
by assigned aircrews flying assigned aircraft supporting military events or “on-base” public
events, except for events approved IAW ETP procedures (aviation support for an ETP-approved
event requires AMC/A3 participation approval). AMC/A3 is the participation approval authority
for formation flyovers.
23. (Added) Multiple aerial performances planned for a single event (for example, at the
USAFA) require the same level of approval as an aerial review (Ref AFI 11-209, para 3.6.3.2.
64                                                AFI11-209_AMCSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2009


and para 3.6.3.2., this supplement). Project Officers are to contact AMC/A3OO as soon as
practical for such proposals.
24. (Added) Wing Project Officers are to e-mail an info copy of the approved wing Aviation
Support Package as soon as practical to AMC/A3O (POC AMC/A3OO), who, in turn, will
distribute information copies within the headquarters (Ref para 4.6.2.1. and 4.6.2.2., this
supplement).
25. (Added) WG/CC is the participation approval authority for an assigned aircrew using an
assigned aircraft performing a single-ship funeral service flyover at Arlington National Cemetery
(see para 2.6.1. and 4.2.3.1., this supplement).

                                Attachment 4 (Added-AMC)
          GENERAL GUIDELINES: STATIC DISPLAY OF AMC AIRCRAFT

A4.1. (AMC) The senior AMC representative on station (WG/CC, SQ/CC, mission commander
or aircraft commander) is responsible for the safe, secure and efficient static display of AMC
aircraft. Wings or squadrons may supplement this attachment as necessary. Key considerations
are listed here:
A4.2. (AMC) Planning factors:
   A4.2.1. (AMC) Based on the local threat assessment, AMC wing commanders will
   determine the degree of public access to aircraft static displays for home-station events (i.e.,
   whether the static display is open or closed).
   A4.2.2. (AMC) Aircrew / Aircraft Security—review the event sponsor’s security plan…is it
   adequate to protect AMC personnel and resources? When on site, check to see that the plan
   is being executed.
   A4.2.3. (AMC) Airfield Infrastructure (At Host Airfield/Base)—verify airfield suitability in
   GDSS Giant Report or Airfield Suitability and Restrictions Report (ASRR) to include
   runway(s), taxiway(s), and parking apron(s) dimensions and weight bearing capacity (WBC).
   A4.2.4. (AMC) Aircraft Parking—is the event sponsor’s proposed aircraft parking plan
   workable, practical? Does it work well to display the aircraft? See any hazards?
   A4.2.5. (AMC) Aircraft Towing—will the aircraft need towing? Tow equipment available?
   Should a tow bar accompany the aircraft?
   A4.2.6. (AMC) Transient Aircraft Support—can TA personnel handle your aircraft?
   A4.2.7. (AMC) Classified Equipment—classified equipment or information will not be
   displayed or discussed unless specifically directed by AMC headquarters or higher authority.
A4.3. (AMC) Considerations for the presentation of a static display:
   A4.3.1. (AMC) Aircrew Appearance—comply with AFI 11-209, para 2.4.5. and with para
   1.1.1, 2.4.5 and Attachment 10, this supplement. Schedule crewmembers to be at the
   aircraft at all times it is displayed.
   A4.3.2. (AMC) Aircraft Appearance—WG/CCs will ensure aircraft scheduled for display
   are clean and presentable…tasked units will check the candidate aircraft for general
   appearance, i.e., frayed deck covering, worn decals, exterior/interior cleanliness, etc.,
   correcting all discrepancies detracting from appearance prior to display or prior to departing
   home station. Aircraft commanders of aircraft picked off in system will check the aircraft’s
   general appearance prior to leaving the last en route station.
   A4.3.3. (AMC) Spectator Access—determine if spectators can board the aircraft. If so,
   limit the number onboard at any one time to a level manageable by the crewmembers
   present. The aircrew must be able to observe and control all visitors aboard. Ensure visitors
   do not tamper with systems or equipment that could result in injury or compromise flight
   safety. Crewmembers must be alert to the possibility spectators might carry explosives
   aboard. If a crew member is suspicious of the contents of a bag or package, deny the
   spectator entrance to the aircraft and contact law enforcement. If a spectator is acting
68                                                 AFI11-209_AMCSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2009


     suspicious while on board an aircraft, contact law enforcement and escort the spectator off
     the aircraft.
     A4.3.4. (AMC) Information Signs—supporting units will normally furnish static display
     information signs. If signs are not available, the supporting unit should coordinate with the
     requester to furnish signs. All signs are to be neat, large enough to be readily seen, and
     prominently positioned for the most effective exposure. The number and size of the interior
     signs are left to the discretion of the supporting unit.
     A4.3.5. (AMC) The mission commander will determine if the aircraft must be towed in or
     out of the display area. When applicable, ensure required towing equipment and qualified
     tow team personnel are available to support the ground movement.
     A4.3.6. (AMC) For AMC-hosted aerial events, the unit project officer should coordinate
     with each aircraft's home station for procedures to safely display non-AMC aircraft.
A4.4. (AMC) “Make-Safe” Precautions—Protecting Spectators, Aircrew and AMC
Resources:
     A4.4.1. (AMC) Install pins, locks, grounding wires, engine covers, pitot tube covers,
     chocks, etc.
     A4.4.2. (AMC) Disconnect hoses, linkages, or batteries as applicable.
     A4.4.3. (AMC) Bleed accumulators, reservoirs if required.
     A4.4.4. (AMC) Remove all electrical power.
     A4.4.5. (AMC) Remove all explosive devices (See Attachment 5, this supplement, for DS-
     equipped aircraft).
     A4.4.6. (AMC) Lock-wire doors that provide access to aircraft systems, as appropriate
(Added) Place barriers/webbing over open access doors (aircraft) not used for spectator
entry/exit.
     A4.4.7. (AMC) Display “No Smoking” signs prominently.
     A4.4.8. (AMC) Deplete fuel load sufficiently to prevent expansion siphoning.
     A4.4.9. (AMC) Secure grounding wires to prevent tripping hazard.
     A4.4.10. (AMC) Position staircases securely, equip with hand rails, and eliminate tripping
     hazards.
     A4.4.11. (AMC) Stow all roller conveyors not required for cargo display (For KC-10
     aircraft, remove or rope off roller conveyors to provide a safe aisle way).
     A4.4.12. (AMC) Locate fire extinguishers adjacent to the nose of each aircraft.
     A4.4.13. (AMC) Position stanchions around aircraft to prevent spectators from boarding if
     necessary, or to control the number of spectators boarding the aircraft at any one time (see
     para A4.3-3, above).
     A4.4.14. (AMC) Conduct a comprehensive search of the aircraft interior for explosive
     devices after each static display session has ended.
AFI11-209_AMCSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2009                                                     69


   A4.4.15. (AMC) At the completion of the static display, the aircrew will perform a
   complete preflight and security inspection of the aircraft.
A4.5. (AMC) For guidance on displaying DS-equipped aircraft, see “Make-Safe” Guidelines
for AMC DS-Equipped Aircraft at Attachment 5, this supplement.
A4.6. (AMC) See AFI 11-209, Attachment 3, for the basic guidance on the static display of
aircraft.

          AMC OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT (ORM) ASSESSMENT

A6.1. (AMC) Wings planning an aerial performance supporting a military or public event must
accomplish an ORM assessment of the proposed flight profile (see para 2.4.7, this supplement).
The wing commander must review the ORM assessment before approving participation or
requesting participation approval from AMC/A3. Retain the ORM assessment in unit files for a
period of one year following the event.
A6.2. (AMC) ORM Process. The wing ORM process provides leadership information
relevant to the risk associated with the execution of a proposed aerial performance. The
objective is to manage the risk. To this end, the process must delineate the wing’s ORM
criteria/procedures and provide a “risk assessment form” to assess the aggregate risk associated
with an aerial performance, categorizing it as low, medium or high—quantitative methods may
be used. Consider the following risk factors in the ORM process in developing an assessment
form (your wing may identify other factors unique to your operation):
   A6.2.1. (AMC) Area of Intended Operations:
       A6.2.1.1. (AMC) Air traffic density
       A6.2.1.2. (AMC) FAA/ATC services in the area
       A6.2.1.3. (AMC) Likelihood of uncontrolled aircraft
       A6.2.1.4. (AMC) Terrain on-site and along low-level routes, if applicable
       A6.2.1.5. (AMC) Proximity and size of population areas
       A6.2.1.6. (AMC) On-site situation: Congested area / non-congested area
       A6.2.1.7. (AMC) Expected level of bird activity / condition
   A6.2.2. (AMC) Aircrew:
       A6.2.2.1. (AMC) Experience level and make-up of the aircrew
       A6.2.2.2. (AMC) Pilot certification in the Standard Profiles and currency
       A6.2.2.3. (AMC) Pilot currency in formation procedures.
   A6.2.3. (AMC) Type of Aviation Support:
       A6.2.3.1. (AMC) Standard profile exists for the proposed flight profile or a “new”
       aerial demonstration must be generated.
       A6.2.3.2. (AMC) Complexity of the aerial performance (multiple passes, multiple
       flyovers, airdrop, ERO, etc.).
       A6.2.3.3. (AMC) Formation procedures involved.
       A6.2.3.4. (AMC) Dissimilar aircraft formation procedures involved.
   A6.2.4. (AMC) On-site Ground Coordinator.
       A6.2.4.1. (AMC) Qualification of the ground coordinator to handle AMC aircraft.
       A6.2.4.2. (AMC) Communications capability (ground coordinator w/ aircrew).
72                                                 AFI11-209_AMCSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2009


        A6.2.4.3. (AMC) Non-availability of an on-site ground coordinator (Funeral Flyover,
        see para 2.7.2, this supplement)
     A6.2.5. (AMC) Additional activities or factors bearing on participation.
A6.3. (AMC) If the aggregate risk associated with an aerial performance exceeds the “low”
range, evaluate the factors driving the risk. Implement work-arounds or take action to mitigate
the risk. Re-accomplish the ORM assessment. If the assessment is still above the “low” range,
and if the project is sufficiently important to the wing, then forward the Aviation Support
Package with the SSS annotated as follows: 1) State that the ORM assessment is “medium” or
“high;” 2) Describe action taken to mitigate risk and that it was not successful; and, 3) Explain
why the wing’s presence at the event is of such importance as to warrant participation approval
for the proposed aerial performance, notwithstanding the risk.
A6.4. (AMC) Normally, AMC/A3 will not grant participation approval for a wing or group to
execute a “medium” or “high” risk aerial performance at a military or public event.

                          WING AVIATION SUPPORT PROGRAM

A10.1. (AMC) Wing commanders will establish uniquely tailored Aviation Support Programs
(para 1.1.2, this supplement)—these programs are to buttress the command’s policy on aviation
support. Document the programs.
A10.2. (AMC) Objective. The Wing Aviation Support Program, in concert with the command
policy for aviation support, cultivates the command air show culture at the wing level.
A10.3. (AMC) General Guidelines.
     A10.3.1. (AMC) In essence, the Wing Aviation Support Program presents the wing policy,
     procedures and guidelines that will implement at the wing level the tenets of the AMC Policy
     on Aviation Support (para 1.1.1, this supplement).
     A10.3.2. (AMC) Leadership. Program supervision can be delegated to the OG/CC (but no
     lower).
     A10.3.3. (AMC) Oversight. AMC/A3V will provide command oversight through the
     ASEV program (ASEV Category: Administration and Manning).
     A10.3.4. (AMC) Participating Personnel. The SQ/CC personally interviews crewmembers
     who will participate in the program, approving pilot crewmembers that will perform pilot-in-
     command duties. Wing personnel selected to participate in the aviation support planned for a
     military or public event must come from those in the wing’s Aviation Support Program.
     A10.3.5. (AMC) Structure. The program is to address the following issues, at a minimum:
        A10.3.5.1. (AMC) Wing policy on Aviation Support. The WG/CC should present the
        wing’s policy on aviation support in writing, providing guidance and standards for wing
        organizations and personnel involved in Aviation Support for military or public events.
        Specify the goals and objectives for participating personnel—they are to become the
        wing’s envoys to the general public.
        A10.3.5.2. (AMC) POCs. Appoint wing personnel to supervise/manage the program—
        provide contact information to AMC/A3OO.
        A10.3.5.3. (AMC) Reading/study materials. Provide materials addressing Air Force,
        AMC and wing operations and history—AMC’s representatives to military or public
        events are to be knowledgeable (see para 1.1, this supplement). All wing members
        participating in aviation support should review this material, especially those supporting
        static displays or the wing’s Open House, where face-to-face contact with the public will
        occur.
        A10.3.5.4. (AMC) Integrate the basic provisions in the AMC CONOPS for AFI 11-246,
        Vol 6 into the Wing Aviation Support program—indicate how the wing implements
        them.
        A10.3.5.5. (AMC) Approving         flight   profiles.       Develop/incorporate       wing
        procedures/guidance implementing the requirements outlined in AFI 11-209, para 2.4.7.,
        and para 2.4.7., this supplement, for reviewing/approving tailored flight profiles planned
        for specific events and to ensure compliance with applicable guidance (i.e., AF, AMC,
AFI11-209_AMCSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2009                                                            79


     FAA, Host Nation). Identify the approval authority for flight profiles within the
     program, if different from the Program Supervisor. Incorporate procedures to coordinate
     flight profiles with the air show or open house Air Boss or Director of Air Operations.
     A10.3.5.6. (AMC) Static Display Aircraft—Make Safe Procedures. Develop wing
     procedures/guidance implementing the requirements outlined in AFI 11-209, para 2.4.8.,
     and para 2.4.8, this supplement.
     A10.3.5.7. (AMC) FAA Coordination & Air Show Operations Briefing. Incorporate
     wing procedures/guidance implementing the requirements outlined in AFI 11-209, para
     2.4.9., and para 2.4.9., this supplement.A10.3.5.8. Airfields Transited. Incorporate wing
     procedures/guidance implementing the requirements outlined in para 2.4.14, this
     supplement.
     A10.3.5.9. (AMC) ORM Assessment. Develop the wing’s ORM criteria/procedures for
     assessing the wing’s aviation support projects and, in particular, the applicable flight
     profiles (see para 2.4.7 and Attachment 6, this supplement).
     A10.3.5.10. (AMC) Aviation Support Packages. Outline the wing procedures/process
     for staffing an Aviation Support Project from initial preparation of the SSS through
     coordination to the WG/CC for approval/concurrence.
        A10.3.5.10.1. (AMC) The Project Officer staffing an aviation support project will
        annotate the SSS used in the wing’s coordination/approval process that the flight
        profile is approved IAW para 2.4.7, this supplement (see Attachment 9, para A9.3.3.,
        this supplement).
        A10.3.5.10.2. (AMC) Flyover/Aerial Review. If the aviation support consists of a
        flyover or aerial review, the Project Officer will insert language into the Aviation
        Support Package SSS stating that the pilot in command has reviewed the
        requirements of AFI 11-209, and AMC Supplement 1, and is an instructor pilot or
        higher (see Attachment 9, para A9.3.3., this supplement).
        A10.3.5.10.3. (AMC) Aerial Demonstration. If the proposed aviation support
        involves an aerial demonstration consisting of a Standard Profile addressed in AFI
        11-246, Vol 6, the Project Officer will annotate the Aviation Support Package SSS to
        indicate that the participating pilot is certified (see Attachment 9, para A9.3.3., this
        supplement).
     A10.3.5.11. (AMC) Cross talk/lessons learned/feedback. Build into the program
     opportunities for more experienced aircrew members to share with new members of the
     wing their ideas and experiences associated with aviation support. Ensure a system is in
     place to disseminate lessons learned from “air show” and “open house” participation.
     Establish a procedure to implement the requirement to critique/review flying
     performance as outlined in AFI 11-246, Vol 6, para 2.5. , and the AMC CONOPS
     Implementing AFI 11-246, Vol 6, para 6.
