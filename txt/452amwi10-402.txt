1. ADMINISTRATION.
     1.1. Concept. The current OPLAN 8010 alert concept is to remain prepared to resume active
     alert operations very quickly and efficiently when directed. The 452 AMW also has
     conventional alert commitments supporting top priority higher headquarters directed
     missions. Procedures contained herein supplement applicable flight manuals and checklists.
     Note: Information in Chapters 2 through 12 is written to cover actions and requirements of
     OPLAN 8010-XX, Global Deterrence and Strike. This increased readiness status assumes a
     level of recall or activation that allows the unit to meet the full complement of support and
     services requirements. Chapter 13 covers the requirements of day-to-day Modified and
     Conventional Alert where they differ from the information in previous chapters.
     1.2. Operations Security (OPSEC). OPSEC is the process of identifying critical friendly
     information and analyzing friendly actions related to operations, acquisition and other
     activities to identify those actions that can be observed by potential adversaries and
452AMWI10-402 4 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                  3


  determine indicators that could be collected and synthesized to derive critical information in
  time to be useful to an adversary and eliminate or reduce to an acceptable level the
  vulnerabilities of friendly information to adversary exploitation.
     1.2.1. In regard to this plan, it is important to note that the following items are critical
     information and should be afforded the appropriate protection:
         1.2.1.1. The meaning and values of code words and reference times.
         1.2.1.2. All intelligence indicators and information. This includes neither confirming
         nor denying information from public news sources.
         1.2.1.3. Locations, types, quantities, readiness status, aircraft configuration and
         status, deployments, details of movements, Limiting Factors (LIMFACs),
         vulnerabilities, personnel and aircraft.
         1.2.1.4. Mission specific information including, but not limited to, routing, timing,
         forces, action points, receiver types, etc.
         1.2.1.5. Generation, regeneration response times, manpower, force size, composition,
         resources, LIMFACs and vulnerabilities.
         1.2.1.6. Aircraft and crew limitations, scheduling details, tactics and threats.
         1.2.1.7. Authentication system/types, procedures to use them, LIMFACs and
         vulnerabilities.
         1.2.1.8. Impact of conventional operations to OPLAN 8010 tasking and vice versa.
         1.2.1.9. Concept of operations, including execution circumstances, operating
         locations, order of battle, resources required, tactical maneuvers, actions, objectives,
         LIMFACs and vulnerabilities.
         1.2.1.10. Reaction times, intervals and sequence of events.
         1.2.1.11. The existence, location and operations of OPLAN 8010 support teams.
         1.2.1.12. Mission objectives.
         1.2.1.13. Access controls and        requirements     for   entry and     movement    in
         Controlled/Restricted Areas.
         1.2.1.14. Security system capabilities/vulnerabilities.
         1.2.1.15. Security for response timing.
     1.2.2. It is imperative that all personnel involved with OPLAN 8010 alerts practice
     proper OPSEC.        This includes aircrew, Crisis Action Team (CAT) members,
     maintenance and support personnel. Personnel should keep discussions of alert actions in
     cleared areas with personnel who have a need to know.
  1.3. Classification. The material in this instruction is unclassified but designated ―FOR
  OFFICIAL USE ONLY‖ under the provisions of DoD 5200.1-R, Information Security
  Program, Sec. 2-203. Information contained herein will be disclosed only to those
  individuals directly involved with the Alert Force.

     1.4. Deviations. The 452d Air Mobility Wing Commander (CC), the 452d Air Mobility
     Wing Vice Commander (CV) and the 452d Operations Group Commander (OG/CC) may
     authorize deviations from this instruction.
     1.5. Alert Force Support Committee.
        1.5.1. Purpose. An Alert Force support committee is established whenever the 452
        AMW has an active OPLAN 8010 Hard Alert commitment. The committee monitors
        Alert Force operations, provides timely inputs to ensure currency of this instruction and
        provides the commander with a status of all aspects of Alert Force operations.
        1.5.2. Procedures. The 452 OG/CC chairs the Alert Force support committee, which will
        normally consist of operations and support staff from the 452 AMW.
        1.5.3. Meetings will convene as determined by the chairperson.
     1.6. Office of Primary Responsibility. The OPR for this instruction is 452 OSS/OSTX. This
     office will revise the instruction as necessary. Changes will be held to a minimum and
     revisions released only when required or when material has a direct impact on the Alert
     Force.
2. HARD ALERT ACTIVATION.
     2.1. Initial Actions/Messaging.
        2.1.1. Upon receipt of initial notification by higher HQ message traffic, 452 AMW/CP
        (Command Post) controllers will notify 452 AMW/CC and 452 OSS/OSTX, who will
        confirm the requirement for Hard Alert activation.
        2.1.2. 452 AMW/CP controllers will recall 452 AMW group commanders to report to
        the CAT or other suitable location. Upon assembly, the group commanders shall, after
        reviewing the activation requirement, notify a designated representative to activate the
        respective Group Control Center (GCC). Command Post will maintain an updated list of
        all GCC phone extensions for use in all subsequent message transmittal. Group
        commanders may elect, in lieu of a GCC, to have a designated individual or team whose
        function will mirror that of a GCC.
        2.1.3. GCCs        will    notify       all     collocated       and        attached     units
        (squadron/flight/shop/detachment) to stand up Unit Control Centers (UCCs). UCCs will
        be activated to ensure all personnel have the ability to receive information in a timely
        manner. It is the responsibility of each unit to structure the recall/alert procedures to best
        suit the organization and ensure selected or total sharing of information to applicable
        personnel.
        2.1.4. Subsequent messaging (following initial GCC activation) will flow in the
        following manner:
CAT/CP  GCC  UCC  Individual Personnel
(Exceptions to this flow are built into existing CP checklists and primarily involve direct
communications with the Security Forces Base Defense Operations Center [BDOC] and the
Maintenance Operations Center [MOC])
        2.1.5. Units will tailor procedures to allow for targeted messaging to other agencies as
        the situations dictate. Commanders may elect to omit individual units from message
452AMWI10-402 4 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                5


     receipt if a message is not considered applicable to those units (for example, the
     MXG/CC will direct a force protection change to all shops through the GCC, but may
     elect to not notify a back shop of the implementation of the Alert Aircraft Repositioning
     Plan [AARP]).
  2.2. Upon receipt of generation notification the following functions will:
     2.2.1. Crisis Action Team. In addition to providing overall generation guidance
     (executing specific checklists), the CAT will activate the UCCs and the Emergency
     Operations Center (via 452 MSG/CEX) as required and determine the appropriate time to
     initiate implementation of the Installation Barrier Plan in part or in its entirety.
     2.2.2. Command Post. CP will disseminate messages and codes in accordance with
     Quick Reaction Booklets (QRBs).
     2.2.3. Operations Plans. 452 OSS/OSTX receives generation notification from within
     the CAT. Remaining members of Plans will then be recalled. A Plans representative
     will be provided as a CAT Director. Inform Combat Crew Communications of required
     number of comm kits and the time and location for kit delivery. Inform Intel, Weather
     and 336 ARS of Assumption of Alert (AOA) brief times. Contact the BDOC to verify
     the current ―Response Codes‖ and ―Duress Words‖ NLT one hour after notification of
     Hard Alert activation. Prepare Land Mobile Radios (LMRs) and Tactical Aircrew
     Alerting Network (TAAN) radios for distribution to generating crews and the Supervisor
     of Flying (SOF). Coordinate with Transportation for any additional support vehicles.
     Update EALs as required and forward to the BDOC. Immediately secure vehicle ―hats‖
     from Base Operations for use with POVs as necessary.
     2.2.4. 336th Air Refueling Squadron. Generation notification is received through the
     452 OG GCC. The UCC and Squadron Operations Center (SOC) will be activated and
     the required number of crews will be identified and assembled. The Unit Deployment
     Monitor (UDM) will receive vehicles from Transportation and receive mobility bags
     from the Logistics Readiness Squadron. The Unit Weapons Custodian will coordinate
     for weapons delivery from Supply to Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE). Trained and
     equipped crews will be delivered to Plans for generation. The SOC will obtain a listing
     of tail numbers and crew chiefs for the matching of generated crews and preparation of
     crew flight orders.
     2.2.5. Communications. Upon generation notification by the MSG GCC, CS will initiate
     a recall as required. Land Mobile Radios will be inventoried and issued as needed (to
     336 ARS and 452 OSS/OSTX, according to pre-established allocations). Voice and data
     help desk personnel will be augmented as needed to field any increased volume of
     troubleshooting calls/tickets. A frequency manager will be available to assist and to
     prepare for TSART actions.
     2.2.6. Security Forces. When Hard Alert activation is directed (via CP notification), the
     Security Forces Base Defense Operations Center (BDOC) coordinates with the March
     Inn manager or the on-duty alert controller to conduct a purge of the Alert Facility
     (building 456) and secure the facility and parking area in accordance with directives. The
     BDOC coordinates with the Command Post to sweep and upgrade the Alert Aircraft
     Parking Area (AAPA) to a Priority Level 2 (PL2) and establishes an Entry Control Point
6                                                  452AMWI10-402 4 NOVEMBER 2011


    (ECP). Guards are dispatched to prescribed posts and the BDOC will coordinate with
    452 OSS/OSTX and Alert Facility controller to verify the current ―Response Codes‖ and
    ―Duress Words‖ NLT one hour after notification of Hard Alert activation.
    2.2.7. Maintenance. Upon 452 MXG GCC receipt of a generation message from CP, the
    MOC (collocated with the GCC) will summon the flight line production superintendent, a
    representative from MX Plans and Scheduling and a representative from Aircrew Flight
    Equipment to be briefed on the Reference Hour and tasking (number of aircraft and fuel
    loads). Line numbers will be matched with priorities and tail numbers for the Generation
    Flow Plan. The production superintendent will brief flight line personnel and initiate the
    Generation Flow Plan. A review of the MXG EAL will be conducted to ensure accuracy
    and any additions/deletions will be submitted to 452 OSS/OSTX for forwarding to the
    BDOC. A ―FOD walk‖ will be accomplished in the aircraft generation and AARP areas.
    As manpower and equipment permit, enough aerospace ground equipment (AGE) will be
    positioned to support AARP aircraft in the AARP parking area located near parking rows
    T and U.
    2.2.8. Intelligence. Upon generation notification by the 452 OG GCC and a subsequent
    Assumption of Alert (AOA) briefing time from 452 OSS/OSTX, Intelligence will prepare
    an AOA brief, support/convene the Threat Working Group (TWG) as required and assist
    with 8010 mission planning (Combat Mission Folder [CMF] preparation, route study and
    Isolated Personnel Report [ISOPREP] review). Intelligence Flight will also brief the
    CAT as required on current intelligence and situation updates per AFI 14-2KC135, V3,
    KC-135 Unit Intelligence Procedures.
    2.2.9. Combat Crew Communications (CCC). CCC receives notification of generation
    from 452 OG GCC. The number of comm kits required and time and location for kit
    delivery will be coordinated with 452 OSS/OSTX. CCC assembles comm kits (and
    checks any existing kits) with required items and assembles worldwide Flight
    Information Publications (FLIP) kits for subsequent crew issue. CCC will ensure the
    Alert Force Manager is provided with tactical call signs for daily briefings. Briefing
    times will be provided by 452 OSS/OSTX.
    2.2.10. Transportation. Upon generation notification by 452 MSG GCC, transportation
    will implement recall of required vehicles for 8010 generation. In accordance with 8010
    OPLAN, the Vehicle Management Section (Contractor) must recall up to 10 6-passenger
    vehicles or suitable substitutes for immediate use by the Alert Force. Requirements for
    aircrew vehicles will be identified by 336 ARS; available unit-assigned assets will be
    utilized and shortfalls filled by Transportation. The required number of vehicles will be
    turned over to 336 ARS. Diesel-powered vehicles should be avoided as fast response
    vehicles to the maximum extent possible. Vehicle recall actions will take place within
    two hours of initial notification, or sooner as the situation dictates, using the March ARB
    Vehicle Recall Plan. Security Forces will utilize unit-assigned vehicles and identify
    shortfalls for fill. Other OPLAN support vehicle requirements will be coordinated
    through 452 OSS/OSTX. Vehicle Operations will ensure all identified vehicle
    requirements are filled. Sourcing of these assets will be from the Vehicle Operations
    fleet, unit-assigned vehicles using the March ARB Vehicle Recall Plan (MEL) and rental
    vehicles as a last resort. Vehicle Operations and Maintenance will ensure it is adequately
    manned with skilled personnel to provide driving support, mobile maintenance and
452AMWI10-402 4 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                 7


     wrecker service in response to vehicle emergencies or contingencies that may develop
     during the course of the 8010 operations.
     2.2.11. Lodging. The March Inn staff maintains building 456 in a configuration that
     facilitates a rapid assumption of Hard Alert operations. The point of contact for
     activation is the March Inn manager or assistant. The lodging facilities manager or a
     designated representative must be available at all times to supervise upgrade to full
     occupancy of the Alert Facility and setup for alert controllers. Following notification of
     generation by 452 MSG GCC, and when requested by the Alert Facility Manager to
     activate the full Alert Facility, the March Inn manager or a designated representative will
     accomplish the actions necessary to provide billeting at Bldg. 456 for the alert crews and
     Alert Facility controllers. These include: contacting the Alert Facility Manager to verify
     generation posture and the number of officers/enlisted personnel requiring rooms in the
     Alert Facility; providing crew rest signs; and contacting Base Contracting to prepare any
     additional funding for additional services that may be provided to the Alert Force.
     2.2.12. Hap Arnold Club. Services ensures procedures are in effect to prepare meals for
     feeding the Alert Force on a daily basis. Sufficient tables (with individual signage) will
     be reserved at the dining facility to provide simultaneous seating for the total number of
     generated crews. Reserved parking signs will be placed in those parking spaces in closest
     proximity to the entrance to the dining facility. Procedures for meal delivery and
     reimbursement (with assistance from the Alert Facility Manager) must also be ready for
     implementation.
     2.2.13. Alert Facility Manager (CQ). The Alert Facility is staffed at all times with a
     manager and an assistant when the wing assumes Hard Alert operations. The 452
     OG/CC is responsible for ensuring an adequate number of Alert Facility controller
     augmentees are identified from base resources IAW (S) AMCI 10-450, Support of
     Nuclear Planning and Operations. These augmentees receive initial training and
     certification to accomplish Alert Force management for OPLAN 8010 generation. When
     the unit initiates a pyramid recall, alert controller augmentees will report to the Alert
     Facility after unit sign-in. If Headquarters directs Hard Alert activation, the augmentees
     remain assigned to alert management until no longer needed to support active alert
     operations. The CQ receives generation notification from 452 AMW/CP. The CQ will
     then contact recalled augmentees, who will be briefed on the situation and schedule.
     Lodging will be contacted for the release of rooms and BDOC will be called to arrange
     for a security sweep of the Alert Facility. The CQ area will be configured to include
     phones and signage (stored in the basement of Bldg. 470). A crew listing will be
     obtained from the 336 ARS in order to tailor room assignments. Radios (LMR and
     TAAN) will be monitored for further message traffic. Tactical call signs will be received
     from CCC. Current ―Response Codes‖ and ―Duress Words‖ will be verified NLT one
     hour after notification of Hard Alert activation.
     2.2.14. Civil Engineering (CE). Position a portable latrine at the southeastern corner of
     the AARP parking area near parking rows T and U.
     2.2.15. Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE). AFE receives notification of generation from
     both 452 OG GCC and the MOC (who also provides the Generation Flow Plan).
     Vehicles are readied to deliver Polarized Lead Zirconium Titanate (PLZT) goggles, water
8                                                       452AMWI10-402 4 NOVEMBER 2011


       rations and contingency gear to aircraft as directed by the Flow Plan. Pro Gear (to
       include ―D‖ bags) and weapons will be readied for crew issue.
3. PERSONNEL.
    3.1. General Rules. Support for United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM)
    requires a rigid control of the Alert Force and strict compliance with published procedures.
    Instant response is necessary. Any delay that can result in failure to meet timing must be
    avoided.
    3.2. Visitation Program.

      Commander ensures takeoff data is available prior to the daily alert briefing.
      Additionally, data is reported to the Command Post no later than 0800L and 1900L, or as
      requested.
      5.9.3. Each OPLAN 8010 alert crew will compute their own takeoff data and crosscheck
      their data against the data computed by the duty copilot. Refer any questions on takeoff
      performance data to the Wing Standardization/Evaluation Division.
      5.9.4. Tailwind Computation Procedures. Twice daily, the duty crew computes the
      maximum allowable tailwind component for the heaviest aircraft type during the
      following periods:
0100Z to 1300Z    and   1300Z to 0100Z
      5.9.5. When the data computation is complete, the duty copilot will call the information
      into Command Post. Any time the reported temperature or pressure altitude exceeds the
      maximum forecast by five degrees or 250 feet, the Command Post Controller will contact
      the Senior Aircraft Commander for required re-computations. Relay additional
      unforeseen degradation factors, such as wet taxiways, to the Senior Aircraft Commander
      on alert.

  declare the aircraft uncocked until receiving the Commander's approval via Command Post.
  5.14. Aircraft Replacement.
     5.14.1. Schedule. In order to meet timing criteria during aircraft changeover, strict
     compliance with the following procedures is mandatory. 452 MXG will establish an alert
     aircraft generation schedule that allows for aircrew acceptance preflight on aircraft
     changeover days. 452 MXG/CC and 452 OG/CC should coordinate the alert changeover
     schedules.
     5.14.2. Crew Preflight. Command Post will notify the crew when the replacement
     aircraft is ready for preflight. Crewmembers should get checklists and headsets and
     proceed to the new aircraft. Upon arrival at the aircraft, they will call the Command Post
     and state: ―Call Sign XX on new aircraft, starting preflight. Request alert notification on
     UHF.‖
     5.14.3. Thermal Curtains. A qualified maintenance technician will install, inspect and
     certify thermal curtains as acceptable for alert status. After initial installation and
     inspection by both maintenance personnel and aircrews, remove thermal curtains not
     normally installed for alert (the pilot and copilot 1, 2 and 3 window curtains). Store these
     curtains in the curtain container above the boom operator’s forward station. Leave all
     other curtains installed in the windows.
     5.14.4. Preflight Complete. Prepare each aircraft according to the aircraft acceptance
     procedures as outlined in the flight manual before going on alert. Inform Command Post
     after completing the interior inspection checklist and accepting the new aircraft. The
     aircraft commander will state: ―The new aircraft is accepted for alert; crew is returning to
     the primary alert aircraft."
     5.14.5. Off-going Aircraft. Contact Command Post when the crew has returned to the
     alert aircraft and is ready to start engines. State: ―Call Sign XX requests permission to
     start engines and taxi to (assigned parking spot).‖ Command Post coordinates with
     Tower for alert aircraft movement. Normal engine start, taxi procedures and safety
     precautions apply during aircraft changeover.
     5.14.6. Transfer. After parking the aircraft on the main ramp, the pilots should
     accomplish the Taxi-Back Checklist to uncock the aircraft. The aircrew will accomplish
     the uncocking checklist. Prior to shutting down engines, advise Command Post ―Call
     Sign XX shutting down engines and moving to new aircraft.‖ Transfer all equipment to
     the new aircraft.
     5.14.7. Oncoming Aircraft. When transfer is complete, the aircraft commander contacts
     Command Post and requests: ―Call Sign XX in new aircraft, requests permission to start
     engines and taxi to alert ramp." Command Post again coordinates with Tower.

         the cocked aircraft.
         5.15.1.2. Taxiing. A complete crew will be on-board the cocked aircraft when
         taxiing in order to respond to any required alert actions while enroute to the new
         parking spot.
         5.15.1.3. Transferring Equipment:
            5.15.1.3.1. If equipment and supplies have already been downloaded from the
            off-going alert aircraft and an alert response is required, respond to closest aircraft
            unless the following paragraph applies.
            5.15.1.3.2. If the off-going aircraft has an OPLAN 8010 launch or mission NO-
            GO condition, transfer equipment and respond in the new alert aircraft.
  5.16. Alert/Fast Reaction Procedures.
     5.16.1. The Alert Controller will make a thorough check to determine that all crews have
     responded, regardless of the type of alert notification used.
     5.16.2. Alert Crew Response Routing (Figure 1) – Alert Response Routes: Note:
     Klaxons are installed in buildings 110 (March Club), 456 (Lodging), 1220 (Tower), 2240
     (OG) and 2245 (336 ARS).
         5.16.2.1. Klaxon/Klaxon Advisory or Report to Aircraft. Alert crews respond in
         accordance with EAP-STRAT, Vol 5, Section 2.
         5.16.2.2. Restricted Alert. Alert crews respond to the Alert Facility as directed by
         Command Post controller, obeying all base traffic laws, and contact the Alert
         Controller for instructions.
     5.16.3. Responding to alerts:
         5.16.3.1. Crews responding to aircraft parked on the main ramp will park their
         vehicles in accordance with squadron regulations.
         5.16.3.2. After parking the vehicle, turn off the ignition. Set the parking brake only
         if the outside temperature is above freezing. Place the vehicle in ―Reverse‖ for
         manual transmissions or in ―Park‖ for automatic transmissions.
452AMWI10-402 4 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                 17


     5.16.4. Crews and police will utilize a Number Code to expedite access to the alert
     aircraft parking areas and aircraft (See Chapter 8).
     5.16.5. In the event of an unforeseen safety hazard, the person first noticing the hazard
     will notify all aircrews by making a ―Terminate, Terminate, Terminate‖ call over the
     UHF or any other available means.
     5.16.6. The crew chief/aircrew members will remove all external covers and plugs
     according to the Ground Crew Scramble Checklist.
     5.16.7. After engine start is complete, the ground crew will move all ground power
     equipment to a position outboard of the wing tips. The ground crew should disconnect
     the ground wires according to the Ground Crew Scramble Checklist. One crew chief
     boards the aircraft after completing ground duties.
     5.16.8. For all alerts, keep air carts hooked to a vehicle roaming the alert line to provide
     an immediate air start capability for aircraft that experience an Auxiliary Power Unit
     (APU) malfunction.
 18                                                 452AMWI10-402 4 NOVEMBER 2011


Figure 1. Alert Response Routes.




      5.16.9. In order to conserve fuel and to reduce maintenance servicing efforts, crews will
      normally keep engine-running time to a minimum. During cold weather operations,
      establish minimum engine operating time at daily briefings
      5.16.10. The crew chief will reconnect ground power at the discretion of the aircraft
      commander.
   5.17. Fast Reaction Exercises.
      5.17.1. In addition to the instructions in paragraph 5.16., the following applies for
      exercises:
452AMWI10-402 4 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                        19


         5.17.1.1. If operating the APUs in the Emergency War Order (EWO) mode, shut
         them down as soon as possible after engine start is complete; this prolongs the
         relatively short life span of the APU while operating in the quick start mode. If APU
         power is required for maintenance or recovery action, restart the units in the normal
         mode.
         5.17.1.2. Alert crews will report their exercise times (actual Zulu [Z] clock times
         including minutes and seconds) to Command Post using the squadron generation
         checklist. Do not relay exercise response times over the radio. Give the completed
         times to 452 OSS/OSTX immediately after the exercise when returning the CMFs
         after a generation exercise.
         5.17.1.3. Refuel aircraft to maintain gross weights as directed by 452 OSS/OSTX.
         5.17.1.4. Aircrews should stand by for clear text instructions, re-cock aircraft and
         top-off fuel as required.
         5.17.1.5. Crews need not relay estimated re-cocking times to Command Post unless
         they encounter delays.
  5.18. Taxi Procedures.
     5.18.1. Command Post will transmit the active runway information to the crews. Do not
     taxi without removing all possible cockpit obstructions to ground visibility. Note:
     Strategic Command and Control System (SCACS) aircraft directed to launch that are
     unable to take off because other alert aircraft are blocking their access to the active
     runway should notify Command Post immediately and standby for instructions.
     5.18.2. Before taxiing:
         5.18.2.1. Check the area for any other aircraft movement. Any moving aircraft
         within 300 feet has the right-of-way over any aircraft not yet taxiing.
         5.18.2.2. If aircraft that are parked side-by-side begin to taxi simultaneously,
         determine the aircraft right-of-way by the direction of turn out of parking. If the
         initial turn is to the left, the aircraft on the left has the right-of-way. If the initial turn
         is to the right, the aircraft on the right has the right-of-way.
         5.18.2.3. For opposing aircraft (either diagonally or directly facing each other), the
         aircraft turning left has the right-of-way.
     5.18.3. If unable to taxi for any reason: taxi light on and off several times.
         5.18.3.1. Notify crew chief of difficulty encountered and request assistance.
         5.18.3.2. When time and the situation permits, keep the SOF and/or Command Post
         (as applicable) informed of any significant difficulties requiring coordination.
     5.18.4. When exiting the parking area to fill a gap in the taxi stream, a minimum of 300
     ft between taxiing aircraft must be available prior to moving into the gap. Note: In the
     interest of safety, aircraft parked on the main ramp should consider delaying taxi to allow
     aircraft parked closer to the runway to taxi first. This permits the delaying aircraft to taxi
     through a less congested area.
20                                                   452AMWI10-402 4 NOVEMBER 2011


     5.18.5. The above right-of-way rules are designed to facilitate safe conduct of moving
     aircraft. They do not negate the aircraft commander’s judgment and responsibility to
     recognize and avoid an unsafe condition. For example, the 300 ft figure mentioned is
     acceptable in most situations, but conditions such as a slick ramp or a fast moving aircraft
     might make it necessary to increase the separation. Aircraft commanders and supervisory
     personnel must assess each individual situation and ensure a safe operation. Safety is
     critical to mission accomplishment.
     5.18.6. Radio Procedures:
         5.18.6.1. COMM 1 UHF Radio. Maintain a listening watch on 311.0. Follow crew
         copy and validation procedures from EAP-STRAT, Vol 5.
         5.18.6.2. COMM 2 UHF/VHF Radio. Set in accordance with squadron instructions.
         5.18.6.3. COMM 3 UHF Ground.
     5.18.7. Normal Alert Parking is directed in the mass parking area. This area will be
     upgraded in priority and security as an alert parking area when aircraft are cocked on
     alert.
     5.18.8. During peacetime and exercise conditions, Ground Control personnel direct all
     aircraft movement. Aircrews must be prepared to react quickly and safely to any
     unexpected situation that may occur.
     5.18.9. During peacetime and exercise conditions, the first aircraft in the taxi stream will
     obtain clearance onto the active runway prior to crossing the hold line.
  5.19. Alert Aircraft Repositioning Plan (AARP).
     5.19.1. Alert aircraft repositioning is in accordance with the 452 AMW AARP plan and
     the instructions found in the CMF. Aircrews are pre-briefed if the tactical situation
     permits. Once aircraft is in final position, accomplish a new stored heading alignment on
     Inertial Navigation Unit (INU) 1 & 2.
     5.19.2. Upon termination of AARP, aircraft will return to their normal alert parking
     spots. The 452 AMW/CP or designated representative directs recovery routes and
     procedures.
  5.20. Cockpit Alert. Cockpit alert status is according to the posture designated using
  procedures outlined in EAP-STRAT, Vol 5.
  5.21. Minimum Interval Takeoff (MITO) Abort.
     5.21.1. If the decision is made to abort the mission or a delay is encountered prior to
     crossing the hold line, notify the tower and clear the taxiway to allow other aircraft to
     pass. Notification to the tower is as follows: ―Call Sign XX Launch Delay." Do not use
     the word ―ABORT‖ in this case. If the problems encountered are of such a magnitude to
     preclude any possible takeoff, the aircraft may be run off onto an unprepared area if
     necessary (OPLAN 8010 Launch Only).
     5.21.2. In addition to radio notification to tower, aircraft aborting the mission will turn
     navigation lights to ―Bright‖ and ―Flash‖ and blink taxi lights on and off several times
452AMWI10-402 4 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                 21


     once clear of the taxiway. Delayed aircraft that are incapable of making MITO timing
     should clear the taxiway by turning off into the parking ramp to clear the taxi stream.
     5.21.3. Delayed aircraft that are subsequently returned to a launch capable status in time
     to make MITO timing will join the stream for takeoff as soon as possible. To
     accomplish this, turn strobes on, configure navigation lights as required and notify the
     tower: ―Call Sign XX Launch Capable."
     5.21.4. Delayed aircraft that subsequently return to a launch capable status, but are
     incapable of making MITO timing, are not to take the runway until tower grants
     clearance (radio or green light).
     5.21.5. Standard AFI 11-2KC-135, Vol 3, Addenda B, KC-135, Nuclear Employment
     (U), procedures apply for aircraft aborting beyond the hold line.
  5.22. Takeoff.
     5.22.1. For OPLAN 8010 launch, refer to procedures contained in the CMF. Command
     Post will notify crews of the launch conditions.
     5.22.2. Takeoff Direction -- Optimum. Runway 32 is used whenever possible.
     5.22.3. Takeoff Direction -- Non-Optimum. When the maximum tailwind component
     for Runway 32 is exceeded, Runway 14 will be used.
  5.23. Potential/Actual Disaster Notification. Accomplish Disaster notification to crews
  (practice or actual) according to EAP-STRAT, Vol 5 procedures. Notification may be by
  Klaxon when situation warrants.
  5.24. Fire Alerts/Fuel Spill.
     5.24.1. Notification is made by two-way radio, telephone or runner. Klaxons are not to
     be used for fire alerts/fuel spill.
     5.24.2. Proceed to the aircraft and stand by to move aircraft (taxi or tow) in the proximity
     of the fire/fuel spill area.
     5.24.3. Move aircraft on direction of the Fire Chief, Tower or Command Post.
     5.24.4. Only those aircraft endangered by the fire would start engines.
     5.24.5. Crews will stand by until released by Command Post. Note: Do not move alert
     aircraft from their parking locations for simulations or exercises.
  5.25. Alert Inertial Navigation Unit (INU) Procedures.
     5.25.1. Alert Crew Procedures.        Each crew will accomplish INU stored heading
     alignments:
         5.25.1.1. When the aircraft is placed on alert status.
         5.25.1.2. Once every seven days while aircraft is on Hard Alert.
         5.25.1.3. When an aircraft is moved and the heading changes more than five degrees.
     5.25.2. Documentation. Upon completion of ground alignment, enter a NOTE with the
     date in the AFTO Form 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document.
22                                                  452AMWI10-402 4 NOVEMBER 2011


     5.25.3. Maintenance Procedures. Alert Force maintenance will pass INU alignment
     dates for applicable aircraft to the Senior Aircraft Commander when required.
     Additionally, maintenance will annotate the alignment completion in the appropriate
     section of the AFTO Form 781.
6. MEDICAL SERVICES.
  6.1. Flight Surgeon.
     6.1.1. The flight surgeon’s primary responsibility is to provide medical advice and
     coordinate medical and dental care as needed.
     6.1.2. Do not assign crewmembers that are DNIF to SCACS support or conventional
     alert sorties.
  6.2. Flight Physicals. Accomplish flight physicals in accordance with normal requirements.
7. CREW COMMUNICATION, PLANS AND INTELLIGENCE.
  7.1. Combat Mission Folders (CMFs).
     7.1.1. 452 OSS/OSTX will issue CMFs to crews upon initial generation. Use checklist
     for CMF material issuance located with each CMF.
     7.1.2. Upon initial issue of the CMF to an alert crew, the aircrew will inventory the
     contents using wing-developed procedures. Keep one copy of the inventory with the
     CMF for aircrew changeover and the other copy in 452 OSS/OSTX accountability files.
     7.1.3. During crew changeover, the oncoming aircrew will:
         7.1.3.1. Proceed to the aircraft and conduct a physical inventory of items. Ensure
         that the number of pages in each QRB agrees with the Table of Contents and Record
         of Data Change located in the front of the book.
         7.1.3.2. Sign, date and record the seal numbers on the next line when the inventory is
         complete. This signature relieves the previous signatory (crew member) of
         accountability.
         7.1.3.3. Use the SF 702 to document actions anytime the locked or sealed portion of
         the CMF container is opened or closed. Record the new seal numbers in the guard
         check column.
     7.1.4. When returning the CMF, a 452 OSS/OSTX representative will inventory all
     items; that individual then signs for receipt of CMF materials.
     7.1.5. The crew stores the Combat Mission Folder (CMF) in the CMF security container
     on the aircraft. The QRBs and communications authentication materials should be
     arranged in the container for immediate access when responding to alerts.
     7.1.6. Intelligence materials for the CMFs will be prepared and updated by the
     Intelligence Flight.
  7.2. Issue/Control of Communications Documents.
     7.2.1. Oncoming Documents and Comm Team Material.
452AMWI10-402 4 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                    23


        7.2.1.1. Oncoming alert crews will inventory and receipt for their Communication
        Documents prior to going to the aircraft for alert changeover.
        7.2.1.2. List the required material on an Air Force Form (AF Form) 4291, Aircrew
        Communications Document Receipt. Use this form as the material receipt during the
        alert period. A positive control crewmember will sign for the classified materials and
        complete inventory of COMSEC materials IAW AFI 33-201, V2, Communication
        Security (COMSEC) User Requirements.
        7.2.1.3. All off-going crews must return their communications material immediately
        after the oncoming crews have accepted the aircraft for alert. They will turn in all
        Communication Documents for inventory and receive their receipts at this time.
        7.2.1.4. Store classified communications material on the aircraft inside the CMF
        security container.
        7.2.1.5. Combat Crew Communications personnel will issue Flight Information
        Publication (FLIP) material.
  7.3. OPLAN 8010 Certification Program.
     7.3.1. Initial certification training is held from 0800 to 1600, Monday thru Friday. This
     training will normally be scheduled for the week prior to the UTA, allowing continuity of
     training for a UTA certification. Initial Command Control Procedures (CCP) training
     will take place as scheduled by Command Post. In order to provide the most effective
     training, all pre-certification requirements (flights, driver’s orientation, security training,
     etc.) should be completed prior to beginning certification training. The squadron sections
     must coordinate training with 452 OSS/OSTX and Command Post to ensure all required
     training items are completed prior to the certification.
     7.3.2. 8010 Certifications are normally scheduled during the UTA on Saturday and/or
     Sunday.
     7.3.3. Prior to certification, crews present a complete OPLAN 8010 and conventional
     briefing to the certifying official.
     7.3.4. Following the certification briefing, the certifying official and appropriate staff
     representatives will question participants to ensure adequate knowledge of mission
     procedures.
  7.4. OPLAN 8010 Study.
     7.4.1. OPLAN 8010 Study Material.        452 OSS/OSTX maintains AMC and
     USSTRATCOM instructions and sortie materials required for combat crew study.
     7.4.2. Recurring OPLAN 8010 Study Program. In order to maintain the desired level of
     proficiency, all OPLAN 8010 certified personnel receive supervised OPLAN 8010 study
     quarterly.
        7.4.2.1. 452 OSS/OSTX provides a briefing to cover items of interest, such as new
        information and Inspector General Reports.
24                                                  452AMWI10-402 4 NOVEMBER 2011


         7.4.2.2. Staff specialists present specialized OPLAN 8010 briefings. Select study
         areas from applicable OPLAN 8010 subjects, such as communications data and safe
         passage procedures.
         7.4.2.3. Combat Mission Folders (CMFs) study will consist of a period of self study
         to permit crewmembers to review materials in the CMF.
         7.4.2.4. Study Quizzes. Periodically, 452 OSS/OSTX will set aside a portion of the
         study program for informal written exams.
     7.4.3. Alert Sortie Study Requirements:
         7.4.3.1. Crewmembers must study their assigned OPLAN 8010 alert sortie within
         eight hours after assuming alert on each Hard Alert tour.
         7.4.3.2. Individual section chiefs should schedule spare crewmembers/mission-ready
         resources for recurring study during the normal alert crew study period. Schedule
         these individuals early in the month to permit rescheduling if they miss a study
         session.
     7.4.4. Intelligence Materials. In addition to the Sortie Study guides in the CMF,
     intelligence reference materials and resources are available in the Intelligence Flight for
     crew review.
  7.5. Command Control Procedures Training.
     7.5.1. All positive control crewmembers must be proficient and current in Command
     Control Procedures (CCP) prior to assuming alert. All OPLAN 8010 certified personnel
     must receive CCP quarterly.
         7.5.1.1. Conduct initial CCP training as coordinated between the squadron sections
         and the Command Post.
         7.5.1.2. Recurring Command Control Procedures (CCP) training is conducted on
         changeover day at 1330L or as coordinated.
         7.5.1.3. Substitutions. Crew substitutes should attend CCP with the alert crew if
         possible. For emergency situations, the crewmember will coordinate with their
         section chief, who will in turn contact the Command Post Superintendent during
         normal duty hours to schedule CCP.
         7.5.1.4. Crewmembers who are noncurrent in CCP training must complete a refresher
         course consisting of prior quarter’s CCP and current quarter’s CCP prior to assuming
         alert.
8. SECURITY.
  8.1. Program Authority. The authority for establishing procedures set forth in this
  instruction derives from AFI 31-101, Integrated Defense.
  8.2. Procedures for Restricted Areas. The 452 AMW Installation Security Plan outlines
  procedures for escorted and unescorted entry. This plan also addresses distant recognition
  codes.
  8.3. Hard Alert Aircraft Entry Procedures.
452AMWI10-402 4 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                  25


     8.3.1. Unescorted entry into Hard Alert aircraft is limited to the assigned aircrew and the
     crew chief. The aircraft commander is the sole vouching authority for granting entry to
     their assigned aircraft. The aircraft commander will verify the need of all individuals
     who require entry into the aircraft. The aircraft commander may appoint another member
     of the flight crew to escort any individuals requiring access into the aircraft. The crew
     chief or an aircrew member must be present when support personnel are working on the
     exterior of the aircraft.
     8.3.2. Pre-Announcement Procedures. The Command Post must process any requested
     entry into Hard Alert parking areas. Security Forces posted in these areas will monitor
     access to the area and detain or apprehend any unauthorized individuals attempting to
     gain entry to the area or tamper with alert aircraft. Initiate appropriate up channel reports
     as required.
        8.3.2.1. Make pre-announcement requests by calling the Command Post.
            8.3.2.1.1. The Command Post pre-announces the names of the individuals who
            are to enter the Hard Alert parking areas to the Desk Sergeant at the BDOC via
            direct line. If more than one person is going to an aircraft at the same time, give
            the senior person’s name plus the number of personnel accompanying them to the
            desk sergeant. Once notified, the desk sergeant will pre-announce the scheduled
            visit to the Security Forces posted within the areas concerned.
            8.3.2.1.2. Personnel pre-announced should arrive within 15 minutes from the
            time of their pre-announcement to prevent confusion on the part of all personnel.
            8.3.2.1.3. The last individual (air or ground crew) departing the secured area must
            contact Security Forces and verify the visit is terminated and the aircraft is secure.
            Ensure all hatches and doors are closed, with the exception of the crew entry
            chute, as applicable. The aircrew will wait for the Security Forces to conduct a
            sweep of the area prior to departing.
            8.3.2.1.4. If personnel deviate from the pre-announcement procedure, they will
            be detained and checked out through the Command Post. Initiate a COVERED
            WAGON if the situation dictates. Personnel who arrive after the prescribed 15-
            minute window will be directed to reinitiate the pre-announcement process.
        8.3.2.2. During any alert response, security personnel will challenge crews entering
        the area by using the distant recognition code. Normal pre-announcement procedures
        do not apply during fast reaction alert responses.
        8.3.2.3. During alert responses not activated by a klaxon, the Command Post should
        immediately advise the BDOC who will announce the response to all posted Security
        Forces. Use distant recognition codes to grant entry.
        8.3.2.4. Authorized fuel trucks and aircraft tow tractors requiring entry into the PL2
        area must be pre-announced. Personnel operating these vehicles should call the
        Command Post for verification and pre-announcement to the BDOC.
        8.3.2.5. In an emergency such as a fire or serious injury, Security Forces, fire
        fighting, medical and other required personnel are permitted entry into the alert
        aircraft parking area without delay. The BDOC must be aware of the emergency.
26                                                    452AMWI10-402 4 NOVEMBER 2011


        Security Forces providing security for Hard Alert aircraft must be forewarned or have
        personal knowledge of the emergency or they will deny entry.
            8.3.2.5.1. Once admitted, Security Forces and owner/user personnel in the area
            should maintain surveillance over the emergency.
            8.3.2.5.2. Upon termination of the emergency, conduct a physical check to ensure
            all emergency response personnel have departed the area.
        8.3.2.6. Aircrews and maintenance personnel responding to alert aircraft during
        ―Communication Out‖ will be pre-announced if at all possible and the distant
        recognition code will be used.
     8.3.3. Escort Procedures for Hard Alert Aircraft Parking Area. Agencies requesting
     escort should contact the Command Post who will copy all required information. The
     Command Post then verifies the request through pre-established telephone numbers to
     applicable control centers (use direct line telephones whenever possible).
        8.3.3.1. Once the Command Post verifies the visit, establish the time of the visitor’s
        arrival at the ECP and have an authorized escort official meet the visitors at the ECP.
        The escort official will identify the visitors with the help of the entry controller. Prior
        to granting entry, the escort official must complete an Air Force Form (AF Form)
        1109, Visitor Register Log.
        8.3.3.2. If the escort official arrives at the Entry Control Point with personnel
        requiring escort, physically separate them by a minimum of ten feet to ensure a duress
        situation does not exist.
        8.3.3.3. The aircraft commander must approve all requests for escort to alert aircraft.
        If approved, the aircraft commander or designated representative must escort the
        individual to the aircraft.
        8.3.3.4. The Command Post will pre-announce these visits to the BDOC and provide
        the name and title of the individual providing escort. The BDOC will pass the
        required information to the guard at the entry control point.
        8.3.3.5. Escort into alert aircraft is for official business only. No aircraft tours for
        personal reasons are permitted.
     8.3.4. Escort Officials/Procedures and Responsibilities:
        8.3.4.1. Escort Officials. The escort official assumes responsibility for the safe
        conduct of the visitor throughout the visit. An escort official confirms the right and
        need for a visitor to enter a Restricted Area and is the sole source of authority for that
        visitor to enter the area. Escort officials are identified on a March ARB issued Air
        Force Form (AF Form) 1199, Air Force Entry Control Card, by an ―E‖ stamped or
        typed next to the area for which they have authority.
        8.3.4.2. Escorts. An escort is any qualified individual designated by an escort
        official to exercise surveillance and control over a person visiting a Restricted Area.
        The escort official must identify all visitors and the reason and duration of the visit.
        8.3.4.3. Escorted Entry Procedures for Protection Level 2 (PL2) Restricted Areas.
        For personnel who require an escort, they or their assigned unit should provide the
452AMWI10-402 4 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                 27


        time of the intended visit to the agency requesting their service or authorizing the
        visit. The requesting agency will verify the need for the visit through pre-established
        telephone numbers, not a number given by the individual requesting the escort. Once
        verified, the requesting agency must have an authorized escort official at the
        designated ECP at the specified time to meet the visitor(s). Clear all visitors through
        the Command Post.
            8.3.4.3.1. Pre-Entry Procedures. The escort official should meet the visitor
            outside the Restricted Area. The escort official confirms the identity of the
            visitor(s) and briefs them on security procedures.
            8.3.4.3.2. The escort official must establish the visitor’s identity and need to
            enter. The escort official then enters the area alone to verify they are not under
            duress and identifies the visitor to the entry controller. Once identified, the
            visitor(s) accomplishes an entry on the AF Form 1109, Visitor Register Log. In
            the presence of the visitor, the escort official or entry controller will inspect all
            hand carried items or baggage. Allow visitors to hand carry only those items
            essential to their visit as identified by the escort official.
        8.3.4.4. Escort Procedures and Escort Official Responsibilities.        A visitor must
        remain under continuous escort.
            8.3.4.4.1. Escort procedures throughout the visit should range from close scrutiny
            and surveillance for previously unknown visitors to close control of authorized
            and relatively known visitors.
            8.3.4.4.2. An escort official authorizing the visit may delegate the functions of
            visitor surveillance and control to another qualified individual from their unit or
            agency. The individual must possess a March ARB issued Restricted Area Badge
            for that area (escort designation not required). However, the escort official retains
            the responsibility for the visitor’s safe and secure conduct during the visit and
            return to the ECP at the end of the visit.
        8.3.4.5. Special Escorting Requirements:
            8.3.4.5.1. Number of visitors. No individual may escort more than six visitors at
            one time within March ARB Restricted Areas.
     8.3.5. Generation Area Entry Procedures.           Upon notification of OPLAN 8010
     generation, the Mass Parking Rows are upgraded to a Protection Level ―PL2‖ area.
     Security Forces will staff the ECP. The Internal Security Response Team (ISRT)
     assigned to the area, along with any other Security Forces available, will purge the area to
     confirm the identity of all personnel working in the area. Maintenance personnel may
     assist in this identification process. An Air Force Form (AF Form) 1199, Air Force Entry
     Control Card, with area 8 open, is required for unescorted entry.
        8.3.5.1. All routine visits to cocked alert aircraft in the generation area will be made
        through the staffed ECP and are pre-announced to the BDOC by the Command Post.
        The Desk Sergeant will announce the visit to Security Forces posted in the area.
        8.3.5.2. During klaxon alerts, Security Forces will grant entry to the area and aircraft
        with the daily distant recognition code.
28                                                  452AMWI10-402 4 NOVEMBER 2011


        8.3.5.3. Air Force Form (AF Form) 1199, Air Force Entry Control Card, with area 8
        open, is required for unescorted entry to alert aircraft and/or the alert parking area.
        An ―E‖ adjacent to 8 is required for escort officials.
  8.4. COVERED WAGON Reporting.
     8.4.1. Every person authorized unescorted entry to the alert aircraft parking area must be
     observant to detect unauthorized personnel or suspicious acts that could jeopardize the
     security of priority resources or aircrew personnel. Anyone observing an incident of this
     nature must accomplish the following:
        8.4.1.1. Check the individual(s) for proper identification (current Air Force Form
        (AF Form) 1199, Air Force Entry Control Card) or escort if they are being escorted.
        8.4.1.2. If you cannot properly identify an individual, place them at a disadvantage
        (feet spread apart on the ground or against a wall) and contact Security Forces
        immediately.
        8.4.1.3. Draw attention to the incident by shouting ―UNIDENTIFIED
        INDIVIDUAL/ PERSONNEL‖ several times. Direct the first available person to
        report the incident to the Security Forces. Give the person being sent to report the
        incident all pertinent information such as number of persons involved, location and a
        brief description of the incident. The description of the incident should include
        information on whether the suspect is armed and if potential explosive devices are
        present.
        8.4.1.4. If the suspect is armed and cannot be subdued without endangering your life,
        then take cover and draw attention to the incident by shouting ―COVERED
        WAGON‖ several times. Direct someone to report the incident to the Security Forces
        while you attempt to keep the suspect(s) under observation until arrival of assistance.
        Ensure other personnel in the immediate vicinity are aware of the incident.
        8.4.1.5. When the Security Forces arrive, release the individual(s) to them and brief
        them on the incident.
        8.4.1.6. Anyone directed to report a security incident should relay all information in
        the fastest possible manner with all available details.
     8.4.2. The Command Post will take the following actions in response to a COVERED
     WAGON incident:
        8.4.2.1. Notify the BDOC, giving all available information.
        8.4.2.2. Follow the quick reaction checklist for COVERED WAGON incidents.
     8.4.3. Security Forces Exercise Responses. Crewmembers should be aware that Security
     Forces periodically conduct security exercises. Security Forces respond to these
     exercises the same as to an actual COVERED WAGON. Crewmembers should assume
     that any Security Forces operation is actual until notified otherwise. Crewmembers
     respond to Security Forces operations as follows:
        8.4.3.1. Within the Alert Facility (Bldg. 456). When notified that a Security Forces
        exercise is in progress, you should remain where you are. Do not interfere with
452AMWI10-402 4 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                    29


         security personnel. If in doubt whether the operation is an exercise, contact the
         Command Post. Crewmembers do not participate in security exercises.
         8.4.3.2. Outside the confines of the Alert Facility, maintain a safe distance (on foot or
         within your vehicle) until cleared to proceed by the Security Forces. If responding to
         a klaxon, proceed with caution. Do not interfere with Security Forces. In either case,
         whether an exercise or actual COVERED WAGON, Security Forces personnel are
         the main point of contact.
9. COMMUNICATIONS.
  9.1. Klaxon System and Testing.
     9.1.1. The Communications Squadron maintains a current list of all installed and
     operative klaxons.
     9.1.2. Klaxon Signal. The klaxon signal for an alert is a continuous sound for 30
     seconds with a 15-second pause, repeated three times.
     9.1.3. Testing. During periods of Hard Alert, Command Post tests the klaxon in
     accordance with AMCI 10-450, Support of Nuclear Planning and Operations. It is the
     responsibility of the Communications Squadron to determine the status of all klaxons and
     report their status by exception to Command Post.
     9.1.4. Alert Notification Terminology:
         9.1.4.1. For situations that require the Alert Force to be restricted to the Alert Facility
         for klaxon maintenance or any reason other than an Emergency Action Message
         (EAM), use the following:
            9.1.4.1.1. ―This is March Command Post with an advisory. All crews return to
            the Alert Facility. Crews are restricted to the Alert Facility on telephone standby.
            I say again,‖ Repeat the advisory and state "March Command Post Out."
            9.1.4.1.2. Crews will return to the Alert Facility immediately, but must obey all
            traffic and speed rules.
            9.1.4.1.3. When all crews have returned to the Alert Facility, the alert controller
            will announce the reason for the restriction. For klaxon maintenance, use the
            following terminology: ―Crews are restricted to the Alert Facility due to klaxon
            maintenance. Respond to verbal notification only. I say again,‖ (Repeat.)
         9.1.4.2. For an EAM situation that restricts the Alert Force to the Alert Facility, use
         the following call:
            9.1.4.2.1. ―For Alert Force, For Alert Force, Restricted Alert, Restricted Alert."
            9.1.4.2.2. Crews will return to the Alert Facility immediately, but must obey all
            traffic and speed rules. Contact the alert controller upon arrival for instructions.
  9.2. Command Post. Command Post will issue actual or exercise instructions to alert crews
  over the UHF and TAAN radios according to EAP-STRAT, Vol 5.
  9.3. Hard Alert Primary UHF Radio Frequencies. Command Post – 311.0.
  9.4. Communication Procedures.
30                                                   452AMWI10-402 4 NOVEMBER 2011


     9.4.1. Normal procedures.     Command Post will direct response according to EAP-
     STRAT, Vol 5 procedures.
     9.4.2. Inoperative Klaxon Procedures.
         9.4.2.1. Recall alert crews to the facility and place them on telephone standby.
         9.4.2.2. Pass alert notification by telephone to the alert controller.        The alert
         controller will then:
            9.4.2.2.1. Yell ―Klaxon, Klaxon, Klaxon‖ while running through the Alert
            Facility to notify all crews.
            9.4.2.2.2. Physically check all rooms after accomplishing the above steps to
            ensure a complete response.
     9.4.3. Communications Out Procedures. Follow procedures in EAP-STRAT, Vol 5.
  9.5. Radio Monitoring Procedures. Crews will monitor 311.0 during ground operations.
  9.6. Portable Command Control Radios.
     9.6.1. TAAN Radio: Crews must carry a TAAN radio any time they are outside the
     Alert Facility.
     9.6.2. The individual wings control and issue TAAN radios.
         9.6.2.1. Prior to leaving the facility, check the operability of the TAAN radio through
         the Command Post controller.
     9.6.3. LMR (hand-held two-way radio): Portable two-way radios may also be issued
     when available.
     9.6.4. The following procedures will apply:
         9.6.4.1. Crews may use portable radios during the following:
            9.6.4.1.1. When in cockpit alert and the aircraft is electrical power-off or the
            aircraft radios are inoperative.
            9.6.4.1.2. Under cockpit alert conditions when the unit commander releases
            crews from the cockpit to the alert vehicle adjacent to the aircraft. If, while in the
            vehicles, the crews receive a message over the TAAN radio that requires an
            acknowledgment, they must return to the aircraft and acknowledge using the
            aircraft radio, not a portable radio.
            9.6.4.1.3. Crews may copy a command control advisory, preamble, introductory
            phrase or message broadcast while responding to an alert. The crew must transfer
            information copied during the response to the crew copy format to validate the
            message and complete checklist items.
         9.6.4.2. Crews that hear the phrase ―Klaxon, Klaxon, Klaxon‖ over the portable
         radio/TAAN respond in exactly the same way as they would to the sounding of the
         alert klaxon. For messages that do not require crew fast reaction, the crews are
         notified by portable radio as well as any other means.
10. COMMAND POST/TOWER/ALERT PROCEDURES.
452AMWI10-402 4 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                   31


  10.1. Active Runway. Command Post will inform crews of the active runway for all actual
  or exercise alerts and coordinate all changes with tower.
  10.2. Responsibilities During Actual/Exercise Alert Conditions.
     10.2.1. Command Post initiates the actual or exercise alert condition.
     10.2.2. Tower Procedures. The tower receives the Alert Force reaction notification via
     light system, LAN line or telephone and will proceed as follows:
         10.2.2.1. Transmit on all available tower frequencies, ―Attention all aircraft: March
         Air Reserve Base is under Alert Conditions; all aircraft remain clear of the traffic
         pattern until further notice.     Emergency and minimum fuel aircraft report
         immediately.‖
            10.2.2.1.1. For actual alert launches, deny all landings unless approved by
            Command Post or OG/CC.
            10.2.2.1.2. The tower controller shall apply the guidelines and procedures in Air
            Traffic Control (ATC) 7110.65, paragraph 3-31, if the pilot of an emergency or
            minimum fuel aircraft requests landing clearance during an alert exercise.
         10.2.2.2. Clear all taxiways, as necessary, to permit rapid access to the runway by
         alert sorties.
         10.2.2.3. Clear the alert sorties onto the runway. Use appropriate light signals when
         necessary.
         10.2.2.4. Pass all delays and aborts to Command Post.
         10.2.2.5. Control the movement of all delayed aircraft.
         10.2.2.6. Keep the runway clear of other traffic until all alert aircraft have cleared the
         runway.
         10.2.2.7. Tower resumes normal operations once Command Post terminates an
         exercise and the runway has been inspected (after a moving exercise). The SOF,
         Airfield Management personnel or other authorized inspector can perform the runway
         inspection.
         10.2.2.8. Upon termination of an exercise, broadcast ―Attention all aircraft, this is
         March Tower, resume normal operations.‖
         10.2.2.9. The tower is the primary agency for controlling all traffic for exercise
         alerts.
  10.3. Repositioned Alert Procedures.
     10.3.1. Command Post will notify the tower and alert controller and crews via TAAN of
     implementation and termination of repositioned alert.
     10.3.2. After notification, the tower will advise radar approach control (RAPCON) of
     aircraft movement.
  10.4. Tower Abort Procedures.
32                                                   452AMWI10-402 4 NOVEMBER 2011


     10.4.1. A tower operator hearing an ―abort‖ call echoes the abort call over UHF Guard
     Channel, 243.0 MHz and the applicable UHF frequency.
11. MAINTENANCE.
  11.1. Organization.
     11.1.1. This chapter defines areas of responsibility for ground handling and maintenance
     of 452 AMW Alert Force aircraft.
     11.1.2. The 752d Aircraft Maintenance Squadron has overall responsibility for
     maintenance functions on, or concerning, alert aircraft. Assigned technicians are
     responsible for maintaining the launch capability of alert aircraft.
  11.2. Alert Maintenance Procedures.
     11.2.1. Maintain alert aircraft in the highest state of readiness. Assign only operationally
     ready aircraft to alert. Report any item that could affect the aircraft’s mission capability
     to the Maintenance Operations Center (MOC) immediately. The alert crew chief will
     report all discrepancies found during preflight to MOC and the aircraft commander, who
     will then notify the Command Post.
     11.2.2. Do not perform any maintenance other than routine servicing on alert aircraft
     without concurrence of the aircraft commander.
     11.2.3. The aircraft commander must first approve any activity that requires
     repositioning of any cockpit switch or control. Aircraft commanders will remain with the
     aircraft for projected maintenance actions if launch able. The aircraft commander must
     notify the 452 OG/CC of the launch able or uncocked status. Maintenance informs MOC
     of change in status. The 452 MOC coordinates as required to pass aircraft status
     information.
     11.2.4. In those cases that require the aircraft to uncock, the aircraft commander must
     first obtain approval from the 452 OG/CC through Command Post. Maintenance informs
     MOC of the launch able or uncock/re-cock status. The crew will accomplish the
     uncocking checklist if required. The crew should run the preflight checklist to re-cock
     the aircraft when maintenance is complete.
     11.2.5. Routine servicing such as gaseous oxygen (GOX) or hydraulic servicing requires
     coordination with the aircraft commander if maintenance must reposition any cockpit
     switches. Accomplish routine servicing during daily alert preflight to the maximum
     extent possible. The crew chief may apply external/Quick Start APU System (QSAS)
     power when required, with approval of the aircraft commander.
     11.2.6. Preplanning.      The Maintenance Plans and Scheduling Section does all
     preplanning and refueling of aircraft going on alert. After generation is complete,
     however, coordinate maintenance discrepancies on alert aircraft with MOC. MOC will
     call any specialists required for corrective maintenance.
     11.2.7. Preflights. Do not perform normal daily preflights of pre-generated sorties or
     aircraft changeover preflights between 2100L and 0700L, except with 452 OG/CC
     approval. (This does not preclude preflighting a new sortie generating due to the upgrade
     of an alert line.)
452AMWI10-402 4 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                 33


     11.2.8. Tire Rotation. Alert KC-135 aircraft tires are rotated as scheduled during normal
     morning preflight times. During engine powered tire rotations, the aircraft commander or
     copilot must occupy the pilot’s seat. Qualified maintenance personnel may rotate tires
     using ground equipment.
         11.2.8.1. Accomplish all appropriate aircraft tire rotation checklist steps.
     11.2.9. Engine starts are required every 30 days.
  11.3. Fuel Configuration and Servicing.
     11.3.1. Responsibilities. The aircraft commander and crew chief must ensure that
     crewmembers follow all directives and checklist procedures on assigned aircraft.
         11.3.1.1. The aircraft commander or qualified maintenance personnel stands by for
         fuel servicing of assigned aircraft. The aircraft commander will ensure a corrected
         AFTO Form 781F, Aerospace Vehicle Identification Document, is aboard the aircraft.
         Base all fuel loads on 6.7 lb. per gallon for JP-8.
         11.3.1.2. The crew chief will function as the ground-refueling supervisor.
     11.3.2. Procedures.
         11.3.2.1. Petroleum Oils and Lubricants (POL) dispatches trucks to the alert parking
         area after alert exercises. Trucks will respond to visual signals of the crew chief.
     11.3.3. Fuel loads. For OPLAN 8010 generation sorties, fuel loads will be computed by
     452 OSS/OSTX and forwarded to Maintenance. Fuel loads for SCACS support aircraft
     will be the maximum used during peacetime or as directed by 452 OSS/OSTX.
  11.4. OPLAN 8010 Configuration.
     11.4.1. Load alert KC-135R aircraft as directed by 452 OSS/OSTX, Aircrew Flight
     Equipment and MOC.
     11.4.2. Operational Auxiliary Power Unit (APU). The KC-135R requires two
     operational APUs with one operational generator to assume alert. If an APU fails on an
     alert KC-135R, transfer the generator to the operational APU. An external air source
     with a long air hose will remain connected at all times to any KC-135R with only one
     operational APU. KC-135R aircraft must not remain on alert for extended periods of
     time with only one operational APU. Take the aircraft off alert as soon as possible, if the
     APU generator is inoperative or if both APUs fail.
  11.5. Aircraft Alert Equipment. KC-135 aircraft equipment requirements are specified in
  AFI 11-2KC-135 Vol 3, C/KC-135 Operations Procedures, Addenda A.
  11.6. Aircraft Parking. Parking is to be in accordance with the parking plan in the (S) 452
  AMW Supplement to AMC Support Plan 8010-FY(U).
  11.7. Periodic Walk-Around Checks.
     11.7.1. The Maintenance Supervisor will ensure that crew chiefs accomplish a periodic
     walk- around check of each aircraft. Bring discrepancies affecting aircraft status, or those
     that would hinder an immediate launch, to the attention of the Flight Line Supervisor.
     The crew chief must immediately notify the aircraft commander and MOC. As a
34                                                    452AMWI10-402 4 NOVEMBER 2011


     minimum, visually inspect the following items during each walk-around check. Daily 5A
     Alert pre-flight inspections will be accomplished IAW T.O. 1C-135-6WC-1, to include
     some additional items not identified in the work cards.
         11.7.1.1. Support equipment in place, secure and properly serviced.
         11.7.1.2. Interphone cord and headset placed at the top of the crew entry door ladder
         on the boom operator’s seat.
         11.7.1.3. Pitot covers and engine (inlet) covers installed (cold weather operations
         install exhaust plugs).
     11.7.2. In the event that aircraft and/or crews are forward located, crews should be aware
     that ice and snow buildup on aircraft requires the following actions:
         11.7.2.1. Deice the aircraft when freezing rain is predicted or occurring. Crews may
         also need to deice after a wet snow has fallen or excessive frost is present.
         Maintenance Operations Control Center will notify the alert crew chief of the
         conditions and request dispatch of deicing vehicles as required. Determine deicing
         fluid strength based on temperatures and precipitation predicted. MOC will
         coordinate with alert crew chiefs, production supervisor and base weather to
         determine deicing requirements and direct the deicing.
         11.7.2.2. If one inch or more of dry snow has accumulated on the aircraft, the alert
         Maintenance Supervisor will organize sweep teams to sweep aircraft clean. Alert
         maintenance notifies MOC of the snow conditions. At the completion of snowfall,
         coordinate with the Senior Aircraft Commander to deice the aircraft as required to
         ensure launch capability.
         11.7.2.3. When freezing rain or extremely wet snow is present, check each engine for
         free rotation during the walk-around check. Use a broom handle to reach fan blades.
         If any turbine is frozen, apply heat to all engines to ensure N-2 compressors are free.
         If frozen turbine blades are found, run engines on all aircraft to thoroughly dry out all
         moisture. Notify Maintenance Operation Control Center of conditions and request
         additional H-1 heaters if required.
         11.7.2.4. When the presence of ice and snow buildup in the parking area could hinder
         or prevent taxiing, the alert crew chief must notify MOC.
  11.8. Repositioned Alert. The MXG representative in the Crisis Action Team (CAT) is
  responsible for overall supervision of maintenance aspects for the AARP. Each responsible
  agency will develop procedures to provide rapid conversion to repositioned alert, permit
  recovery from taxi exercises and permit conversion from optimum to non-optimum launch
  posture.
  11.9. Alert Vehicle and Ground Equipment Usage and Control.
     11.9.1. Purpose. To ensure all alert personnel are familiar with operating procedures for
     using vehicles and ground power equipment assigned or on loan to the alert branch.
         11.9.1.1. Shift supervisors staff assigned radio trucks and accomplish vehicle
         inspections and properly annotate the AF Form 1800, Operator’s Inspection Guide
         and Trouble Report.
452AMWI10-402 4 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                 35


         11.9.1.2. Ground Power Equipment for KC-135s. There is a minimum of one power
         unit for refueling, plus one power unit for each aircraft without an operational APU.
         Use ground heaters as necessary for winter operation.
  11.10. Snow Removal. (In the event that aircraft and/or crews are forward located, crews
  should be aware that these procedures should be available)
     11.10.1. Purpose. To ensure launch capability of alert aircraft during and after excessive
     snowfall.
     11.10.2. Responsibilities. The Maintenance Supervisor with the assistance of the Senior
     Aircraft Commander, as necessary, will implement the following procedures when
     conditions warrant:
         11.10.2.1. The Senior Aircraft Commander will direct crewmembers to help the crew
         chief shovel a 20-foot long path in front of each gear truck and remove snow from
         aircraft fuselage.
         11.10.2.2. When snow has accumulated to more than three inches, the supervisor will
         request snowplows through MOC and/or the Command Post Controller to clear alert
         taxiways and as many parking spots as can be safely cleared. If accumulation
         continues and drifting occurs around the aircraft, they will be pulled forward until the
         parking spot is clear, then re-parked. Alternatively, if any spots are vacant, aircraft
         can be rotated into empty spots until all parking locations are clear.
         11.10.2.3. The alert crew chief should coordinate with the supervisor of the snow
         removal team to ensure that snow is not piled up where it would prevent alert aircraft
         from taxiing.
         11.10.2.4. When a parking spot is covered with snow and an aircraft changeover
         occurs, the snowplows will clear the spot while it is empty.
         11.10.2.5. The alert crew chief must ensure that powered support equipment is
         accessible at all times.
  11.11. Foreign Object Damage (FOD) Program for Alert.
     11.11.1. Purpose. To minimize Foreign Object Damage (FOD) to alert aircraft.
     11.11.2. Responsibilities and Procedures. All support and Alert Force personnel on duty
     carry out and implement, as required, the procedures outlined in this directive.
         11.11.2.1. Each alert crew is responsible for policing the immediate ramp area
         around their aircraft. The crew will inspect this area during the daily preflight and
         before engine run-up or taxi, except during actual alerts. These inspections will
         include:
            11.11.2.1.1. Removal of FOD from ramp.
            11.11.2.1.2. Parking and securing equipment.
            11.11.2.1.3. Checking covers and plugs for security and serviceability.
         11.11.2.2. The senior specialist present on any maintenance action is responsible for
         the cleanliness of the affected ramp area after completing the job. Upon completion
36                                                    452AMWI10-402 4 NOVEMBER 2011


         of work, check for safety wire, nuts, bolts, rags or anything that may cause damage to
         the aircraft.
         11.11.2.3. Normally, the overall alert area and ramps are checked and cleared daily
         by the alert Maintenance Supervisor on duty. The condition of each parking site is
         the primary responsibility of the crew chief and aircraft commander concerned.
         Common courtesy and basic good safety practices dictate that when a specialist
         changes a component, it is their responsibility to clean up any debris that resulted
         from their activities. If the area is not clean and free of debris, the crew chief and
         supervisor concerned should not release the specialist.
  11.12. Exercise Recovery (for exercises during which aircraft are taxied).
     11.12.1. Upon notification of an alert by klaxon or radio communication, the
     Maintenance Supervisor will position him/herself outside the alert area on the main ramp.
     Supervisor assists as requested by the alert crew chiefs. The Maintenance Supervisor
     should obtain any necessary additional personnel from the flight line launch teams.
     11.12.2. After taxiing aircraft leave a parking spot, immediately prepare to receive the
     aircraft back into the area. Clear all chocks, fire extinguishers and alert vehicles from the
     parking spots. Additional crew chiefs will position themselves as necessary to facilitate
     recovery operations.
     11.12.3. Recovering aircraft free flow back into mass ramp parking spots. Sorties parked
     in spots that require the aircraft to be towed into position should position themselves to
     recover at the end of the stream.
     11.12.4. The Maintenance Supervisor should contact the MOC to confirm that refueling
     trucks are en route. The assigned crew chief will supervise fuel servicing after alert
     exercises and accomplish all required maintenance.
     11.12.5. After an alert exercise, the crew chief is responsible for complying with an alert
     exercise postflight as specified in T.O. 1C-135-6WC-1.
     11.12.6. The crew chief must properly document all discrepancies in the appropriate
     aircraft forms.
     11.12.7. The alert crew chiefs will call the MOC for specialist assistance as required.
     11.12.8. The crew chief should follow up on all discrepancies to ensure they have been
     documented and cleared.
     11.12.9. The alert crew chief must notify the aircraft commander when the assigned
     aircraft needs to be uncocked for maintenance action and when it is ready to be re-cocked
     following that maintenance action. This notification does not apply to routine actions,
     such as general maintenance or GOX and hydraulic servicing.
     11.12.10. The crew chief should properly bed down the aircraft prior to leaving the area.
  11.13. Towing and Parking Aircraft.
     11.13.1. Purpose. To provide instructions on towing and parking aircraft in the alert
     area.
     11.13.2. Responsibility.
452AMWI10-402 4 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                 37


         11.13.2.1. The provisions of this paragraph apply to all flight crews and maintenance
         personnel on duty with the Alert Force. It also applies to tow teams from the support
         branch when towing alert aircraft.
         11.13.2.2. The aircraft commander and the crew chief will ensure proper procedures
         are followed when the aircraft is being towed.
     11.13.3. Procedures.
         11.13.3.1. Use a checklist during all towing operations and strictly observe all safety
         practices.
            11.13.3.1.1. Post sufficient wing walkers to ensure the safety of taxiing aircraft.
            11.13.3.1.2. Post an individual to direct the aircraft to its parking spot. AFI 11-
            218, Aircraft Operations and Movement on the Ground, contains required hand
            signals. At night, use taxi wands.
            11.13.3.1.3. The crew chief parking the aircraft must watch the maximum limit
            markings closely to prevent exceeding turn limits. Keep aircraft away from
            unstressed surfaces marked with wide double yellow stripes.
  11.14. Shift Change Procedures.
     11.14.1. Purpose. To ensure alert aircraft and support equipment are maintained in a
     constant state of readiness.
     11.14.2. Responsibility. The Maintenance Supervisor and Senior Aircraft Commander
     implement these procedures:
         11.14.2.1. The oncoming crew chief will report to the alert area at 1700L on
         changeover day. Bring helmet and alert gear. Any crew chief not having all required
         equipment and immunizations or not meeting AFI 36-2903, Dress and Personal
         Appearance of Air Force Personnel, cannot assume alert until meeting requirements.
         The off-going crew chief will remain on alert until such time as the new crew chief
         fulfills requirements.
         11.14.2.2. The Senior Aircraft Commander will hold roll call to ensure all personnel
         are present.
         11.14.2.3. The Senior Aircraft Commander will provide alert numbers, the duress
         word, any additional information and discuss any problems that might be of interest.
         11.14.2.4. The oncoming crew chief should proceed to their aircraft with the off-
         going crew chief and check the aircraft and equipment thoroughly IAW T.O. 1C-135-
         6WC-1, Part 5A. Report all unsatisfactory items to the on duty alert Maintenance
         Supervisor. Clear all discrepancies as soon as possible.
         11.14.2.5. Alert crew chiefs must check powered and non-powered AGE for
         serviceability.
  11.15. Personal Appearance. Maintenance ground crews will have in their possession
  BDUs/ABUs and authorized caps. Wear winter gear (parka, heavy pants, hat, gloves and
  boots) as required by existing weather conditions.
38                                                  452AMWI10-402 4 NOVEMBER 2011


12. DEPLOYED ALERT.
  12.1. Concept.
     12.1.1. Periodically, there may exist a need to deploy aircraft of the 452 AMW to
     another base to assume alert. Whenever this occurs, the 452 OSS/OSTX will obtain
     copies of the deployment base alert procedures and include them in the CMF material for
     those sorties affected.
     12.1.2. The Assumption of Alert and Pre-Takeoff Briefing will include any changes to
     the published alert procedures.
13. MODIFIED AND CONVENTIONAL ALERT PROCEDURES.
  13.1. Crew Management.
     13.1.1. Due to the changing nature of specific alert taskings, crew management policies
     are developed and maintained by the 336 ARS/CC or 336 ARS/DO and approved by the
     452 OG/CC. These policies are outlined in the 336 ARS Alert Crew Information File
     (ACIF) located in the 336 ARS mission planning room. Prior to assuming alert, all
     crewmembers will initial the file indicating they are familiar with the guidelines and the
     most current update has been reviewed. Deviating from these policies requires approval
     from the 336 ARS/DO (or higher). Alert personnel substitutions may be granted by the
     336 ARS/DO for 336 ARS personnel or the 752d Aircraft Maintenance Squadron (752
     AMXS) Flight Chief (or higher) for 752 AMXS personnel. Coordinate personnel
     changes with the Command Post immediately and follow the procedures listed below
     (paragraph 13.2.3.).
  13.2. Crew Changeover Procedures.
     13.2.1. Modified Alert: Crew changeover normally occurs at 1700 in the 336 ARS
     briefing room. Any deviations to the changeover time or location for any crewmember
     (including the crew chief) must be coordinated with the aircraft commander and the
     Command Post. The oncoming crew calls the Command Post, using the procedure in
     paragraph 13.2.3., at the earliest opportunity.
     13.2.2. The off-going crewmembers hand over the alert pagers/radios and brief the
     oncoming crewmembers on aircraft status; i.e., tail number, location and expected
     maintenance actions. Aircraft commanders are responsible to coordinate any necessary
     actions.
     13.2.3. Immediately upon assuming alert, each crewmember calls the Command Post to
     confirm his or her name and ask for a pager test; the Command Post will then page the
     crewmember and confirm the pager's operation. Resolve any malfunction immediately.
     This procedure assures the Command Post’s crewmember and pager number list is
     correct and tests the pager. Leave the pager turned on 24 hrs per day. The Command
     Post may conduct random connectivity checks as a means to ensure crews are meeting
     commitments and operability of the pagers. The alert aircraft commander calls the
     Command Post to confirm the scheduled alert crew is, in fact, on alert.
     13.2.4. Do not upload the modified alert aircraft with personal or professional equipment
     until directed to do so. Keep equipment readily accessible. Do not leave personal and
     professional equipment unsecured (including alert vehicle) at any time.
452AMWI10-402 4 NOVEMBER 2011                                                             39


  13.3. Modified Alert Recall.
     13.3.1. It is imperative that the 452d Command Post is able to contact and recall the
     aircrew (including the crew chief). The crew must be able to respond to exercise or real
     world recall messages and assume Hard Alert duty or launch within the "classified" time
     allotted.
         13.3.1.1. The Command Post resolves connectivity problems by contacting the 336
         ARS/DO and the 452 OG/CC. If the problem concerns the crew chief, contact the
         752 AMXS Maintenance Supervisor and the 452 MXG/CC. These people have the
         responsibility to immediately provide suitable replacement personnel, when alert
         crewmembers do not respond to a recall. The Command Post must immediately
         resolve exercise connectivity problems; notify one of the above Point of Contacts
         (POCs) if connectivity cannot be established.
     13.3.2. Once notified by the Command Post of a tasking and recall, the crew reports as
     soon as possible to the 336 ARS Squadron mission planning room (Bldg. 2245). The
     intent is to have each person report no later than 45 minutes. Respond as soon as
     possible, but in a safe manner (adhere to all traffic laws). If delayed en route for any
     reason, call the Command Post. The command post will also notify the 452 AMW/CC,
     the 452 OG/CC, the 336 ARS/DO and 452 OSS/OSTX of the tasking. If available, 452
     OSS/OSTX will be available to provide coordination and support of the launching crew.
         13.3.2.1. All 336 ARS crewmembers will report to the Command Post following
         assembly. The Command Post controller relays the tasking information to the crew.
         This information classified SECRET normally includes: the air refueling track,
         communication and refueling (CR) plan, refueling altitude, off-load, Air Refueling
         Control Time (ARCT) and Voice Call Sign Listing (VCSL) call signs. The Combat
         Mission Folder (CMF) footlocker contains the CMF, CJCS chart package, Tactical
         Aircrew Alerting Network (TAAN) capable radios and the Communications kit. The
         alert crewmember(s) will inventory the Communications bag and CMF contents
         utilizing the inventory lists inside the container. The classified materials will be
         signed over to an alert crewmember using the inventory forms provided in the CMF.
         This material is classified SECRET. Do not leave it unattended at any time. Turn the
         radio to TAAN and get a TAAN check from the Command Post. Proceed to the 336
         ARS to accomplish mission planning, sortie study and individual duties—do not
         delay at the Command Post waiting for other crewmembers. If tasked to cock the
         aircraft on Hard Alert, proceed immediately to the aircraft after retrieving
         professional gear from the squadron; follow Command Post instructions. If tasked to
         fly a mission, use the following instructions.
         13.3.2.2. During normal duty hours the crew chief reports to the Command Post, then
         immediately to the alert aircraft. After normal duty hours, the crew chief checks in
         with the Command Post, then reports to the 752 AMXS, picks up a hand-held radio
         and maintenance vehicle and immediately reports to the alert aircraft.
     13.3.3. Crew duties. The mission timing should allow a flow that is very similar to our
     standard training sorties.
40                                                   452AMWI10-402 4 NOVEMBER 2011


         13.3.3.1. Aircraft Commander. After reviewing Combat Mission Folder (CMF)
         route and timing, Notices to Airmen (NOTAMs), and weather, fax the DD-175,
         Military Flight Plan to Airfield Management Operations--confirm they’ve received it.
         Confirm fuel load, tail number and parking spot with the MOC.
         13.3.3.2. Copilot. Call Airfield Management Operations (x3602) to request a
         weather brief. Obtain NOTAMs online (https://www.notams.jcs.mil). Compute
         peacetime takeoff data.
         13.3.3.3. Boom Operator. Secure the alert truck, accomplish corrected Form F if
         necessary, fill water jug and coordinate lunches. 452 OSS/OSTX and 336 ARS will
         ensure that A and B bags are sized and issued to each flight crew prior to the
         assumption of alert. A & B bags are only intended for emergency/off-station use.
         13.3.3.4. Crew Chief. Prepare the alert aircraft for launch. Ensure support
         equipment is available for air-start capability and power, in the event the takeoff is
         delayed.
         13.3.3.5. The entire aircrew must be present for a thorough crew briefing (crew chief
         exempt).
         13.3.3.6. Coordinate with the Command Post for updates. Proceed as soon as
         possible or as directed (no later than 1+10 minutes prior to scheduled launch) to the
         alert aircraft. Prior to engine start time call Command Post for coordination. Start
         engines and takeoff to meet scheduled timing or as directed by message. An
         Emergency War Order (EWO) start is not appropriate for this mission.
         13.3.3.7. After landing, preflight the aircraft for alert, which may require a fuel
         upload if another aircraft has not been pre-positioned; comply with Command Post
         instructions. Under peacetime rules, the alert crew must not continue aircrew duties
         past the designated duty day length. Note: If the same alert crew will continue alert
         duty after the USSTRATCOM degrade expires, then that crew must be allowed 12
         hours crew rest before being notified for additional taskings. Due to aircrew rest
         restrictions, another crew will be directed to preflight the alert aircraft.
  13.4. Daily Duties.
     13.4.1. The crew accomplishes the daily alert preflight at 0800 or as coordinated by the
     aircraft commander. Utilize the DAILY PREFLIGHT checklist in the "Alert Procedures"
     section of T.O. 1C-135(K)R(II)-1. Rotate tires on Tuesday (except during holidays).
     Start engines on Tuesdays using the QSAS; use the ground power cart to preserve APU
     life during other days of the week. Contact the Command Post for a pre-announcement to
     Security Forces Control Center (SFCC) and coordination with March Airfield
     Management Operations for engine start clearance. Aircrew Flight Equipment supplies a
     headset and 336 ARS Standardization and Evaluation (336 ARS/DOV) supplies a
     checklist at each station aboard the alert aircraft. During modified alert, use the aircraft
     tail number in radio transmissions. For aircraft on Hard Alert, use the designated sortie
     number (Do not identify a sortie number with either a parking spot or tail number over
     non-secure communications). Do not load any personal or professional equipment on the
     alert aircraft unless directed to assume ―Hard Alert.‖ The aircraft commander ensures all
     personnel are present for the daily alert preflight. Contact the 336 ARS/DO (or higher
452AMWI10-402 4 NOVEMBER 2011                                                               41


     authority) if unusual circumstances occur that prevent an individual from performing the
     preflight.
     13.4.2. Crewmembers may complete ground-training events or attend other scheduled
     activities while on alert.
  13.5. Aircrew Connectivity and Travel Restrictions.
     13.5.1. During alert, after the assumption of alert pager test and with an operable pager,
     crewmembers need not inform the Command Post of their movements. The Command
     Post conducts occasional connectivity checks with the alert crew. The aircraft
     commander may request information regarding an individual’s general whereabouts and
     telephone number; however, the Command Post remains the focal point for alert crew
     recalls. Do not use the Alert Force pagers as items of convenience; these are for
     Command Post use, to recall a crewmember. Crewmembers on alert, who are routinely
     away from a hard-line telephone, should consider purchasing a cellular phone for
     personal use. Do not use any alert notification equipment as a convenience. Do not
     release pager numbers to outside agencies; these are for official use. The 336 ARS/DO
     or higher authority may impose restrictions for adverse weather, road conditions, power
     outages, airfield problems or other unforeseen situations. You are expected to restrict
     yourself, as needed, to ensure your personal response time.
         13.5.1.1. CONDITION ALFA – Normal modified alert. Personnel must comply

modified alert. Overflow alert lodging will be assigned and designated as required. Currently
there is no dedicated Alert Facility at March ARB. Crews recalled to Hard Alert will be billeted
in building 456.
Alert Facility Manager—Person/s designated by the Operations Group Commander who
has/have been trained by the Alert Force manager and are knowledgeable in crew control
procedures, basic command and control functions and Alert Force operations that enable them to
manage the Alert Facility and crews who have been placed on Hard Alert. The March Inn staff is
in direct charge of the facility and is responsible for all maintenance and facility operations
dealing with the Alert Force.
Cocked Aircraft—A combat configured aircraft that has been pre-flighted and declared cocked
by the aircraft commander.
Generated Aircraft—A fully pre-flighted aircraft ready for conventional, modified or OPLAN
8010 alert.
Launch Able Aircraft—A previously cocked aircraft capable of meeting alert launch timing,
but which is in an intermediate condition between cocked and uncocked while undergoing
maintenance or refueling. Do not report an aircraft as uncocked when it is launch able.
Senior Aircraft Commander—The senior ranking aircraft commander on alert scheduled for a
complete tour of duty. This individual acts as the Officer in Charge of the Alert Force. A Senior

crews to remain in close proximity to dedicated aircraft to meet high priority response timing
criteria. Crewmembers assigned TACAMO Alert status will remain in direct contact with
Command and Control authorities and ensure their personal ability to meet MAJCOM mission
requirements. An individual scheduled for TACAMO Alert may perform routine duties, ground
training and/or mission preparation during their regularly scheduled work period. Alert duty
does not constitute official crew rest, but is designed to provide sufficient rest to meet mission
requirements. Applicable flight duty periods begin upon mission execution and restrictions will
be determined by MAJCOM at that time.
Uncocked Aircraft—A previously cocked aircraft that is subsequently relieved from sortie
responsibility by a scheduled replacement or declared unable to launch because of maintenance
or operational reasons.
