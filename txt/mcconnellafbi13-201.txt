This instruction implements AFPD 13-2, Air Traffic, Airfield, Airspace and Range Management,
and establishes policies, procedures and standards relating to flying activities at McConnell Air
Force Base (AFB) and is applicable to all base flying units. Because of the density and mixed
types of air traffic, the close proximity of numerous civilian airports and the large amount of
pilot training traffic found in the area, strict adherence to the procedures established herein is
absolutely essential except when circumstances warrant deviation in the interest of flying safety.
Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are
maintained in accordance with (IAW) Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of
Records, and disposed of IAW with the Air Force Records Information Management System
(AFRIMS) located at https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61a/afrims/afrims/. Refer recommended
changes and questions about this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR)
using the Air Force (AF) Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication; route AF
Forms 847 from the field through the appropriate functional chain of command. This publication
may not be supplemented or further implemented/extended.

        VISUAL FLIGHT RULES (VFR)/INSTRUMENT FLIGHT RULES (IFR)
                              PROCEDURES

2.1. Visual Flight Rules (VFR) Weather Minimums. The VFR weather minimums are ceiling
at or above 1000’ AGL and visibility of 3 miles or greater. Closed pattern and overhead pattern
availability require a ceiling at or above 1,300’ AGL for low closed pattern, 2,100’ AGL for
conventional pattern, and 2,600’ AGL for overhead pattern respectively.
2.2. Visual Flight Rules (VFR) Traffic Patterns (Attachment 3).
   2.2.1. Overhead traffic pattern.
       2.2.1.1. Fly the initial approach and the traffic pattern at 3,500’ MSL.
       2.2.1.2. To protect the overhead pattern while in use, Air Traffic Control (ATC) will
       restrict all departures at or below 3,000' MSL until crossing the departure end of the
       runway.
   2.2.2. Closed traffic pattern.
       2.2.2.1. The closed traffic pattern for all aircraft will be flown to the east of McConnell
       AFB. The east pattern should be flown at 3,000' MSL.
       2.2.2.2. When flying the VFR pattern to runway 19, aircrew may begin a descending
       base turn but must cross the Beech extended runway centerline at or above 2,700' MSL.
       2.2.2.3. Low Closed Pattern requests will be approved at the controllers’ discretion,
       weather and workload permitting.
       2.2.2.4. The low closed pattern will only be flown to the east of McConnell AFB and
       will be flown at 2,200’ MSL when runway 01L/R is in use. Upwind extensions are not
       authorized in the low closed pattern and crosswind turn must be completed within 1.5
       NM of McConnell AFB to avoid traffic conflicts with Beech Airport. NOTE: Aircraft
       below 3,000’ MSL are protected from obstacles only if they remain within the Class D
       airspace. Controllers may issue separation maneuvers (360s, 180s, extended downwind,
       etc) to aircraft in the low closed pattern if the aircraft will remain within the confines of
       the Class D airspace. IF AN AIRCRAFT IS PROJECTED TO DEPART THE CLASS D
       AIRSPACE, THE CONTROLLER SHALL CLIMB THE AIRCRAFT TO THE 3,000’
       MSL PATTERN ALTITUDE.
       2.2.2.5. Aircraft entering the VFR pattern from CREST (IAB 030/07) or YANKEE (IAB
       150/07) will be at 3,500' MSL. Aircraft proceeding to CREST for an approach to Runway
       19 will maintain 3,500' MSL until abeam Jabara Airport. Aircraft proceeding to
       YANKEE for an approach to Runway 01 will maintain 3,500' MSL until departing
       YANKEE. All aircraft requesting a visual straight-in approach shall use CREST or
       YANKEE as entry points, unless otherwise directed by ATC.
MCCONNELLAFBI13-201 30 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                        17


2.3. Visual Flight Rules (VFR) Departures.
   2.3.1. When departing/transitioning VFR on Runway 01, turn crosswind to remain within
   2.5 distance measuring equipment (DME) (1.5 NM) north of McConnell AFB. If unable,
   continue northbound until reaching 3,000’ MSL, then turn crosswind.
   2.3.2. All VFR departures requesting radar advisories must advise Ground Control on initial
   contact of proposed altitude and initial on course heading. Ground Control will coordinate
   with Wichita Approach for a beacon code and departure frequency.
2.4. Special  Procedures      (Helicopter,     Functional  Check     Flight,    Paradrop
Operations): Special procedures shall be conducted IAW FAAO 7110.65 guidelines.
2.5. Reduced Same Runway Separation (RSRS) Procedures: RSRS procedures are not
authorized at McConnell AFB.
2.6. Intersection Departures: Intersection departures are available from all intersections and
shall be conducted in accordance with FAAO 7110.65 procedures. See Attachment 2 for
distances remaining.
2.7. Radar Traffic Patterns (Attachment 3): The radar traffic pattern is controlled by Wichita
Approach Control. Radar pattern altitude is 4,000' MSL.
2.8. Availability/Restrictions for Airport Surveillance Radar (ASR) and Precision
Approach Radar (PAR) Approaches/Monitoring: ASR/PAR services are not available at
McConnell AFB.
2.9. Local Climb-Out Instructions: When issued a "Local climb-out" instruction, pilots shall
fly runway heading, climb and maintain 4,000', contact Wichita Departure on 134.8 and comply
with additional ATC instructions as required.
2.10. Radar Vector to Initial Procedure: All requests by IFR aircraft for an overhead
approach shall be sequenced to a five-mile initial for Runway 19L/01R unless otherwise
coordinated.
2.11. Breakout/Go Around/Missed Approach Procedures.
   2.11.1. Breakout procedures may apply to straight-in IFR approaches or practice instrument
   approaches under VFR conditions and will normally be applied within two miles of the
   runway threshold. Unless otherwise coordinated, Breakout means: “Climb and maintain
   3,000’, fly heading 110”. Traffic condition may dictate the need for alternate instructions.
   2.11.2. All IFR go-arounds that are not coordinated otherwise shall be issued local climb out
   of: “Fly runway heading and maintain 4,000'”.
   2.11.3. Unless otherwise instructed by ATC, missed approach procedures will be flown as
   published for the approach being flown.
2.12. Circling Approaches: Circling approaches are only authorized to Runway 19L/R circle
to land Runway 01L/R. When Southbound circling approaches are conducted, aircraft
commanders are to commence circle no earlier than 2.5 DME (1.5 Nautical Miles) North of
McConnell AFB. NOTE: Circling approaches to Runway 01L/R circle to land Runway 19L/R
are not authorized due to close proximity of base turn to the Beech Airport Arrival/Departure
corridor.

2.13. Lost Communications Instructions: Lost Communication procedures will be executed
IAW the information outlined in the Flight Information Handbook, section A.
2.14. Opposite Direction Take-Offs and Landings: Separation requirements for opposite
direction operations are listed below. For specific coordination procedures between Wichita and
McConnell AFB ATC, refer to the 22d Air Refueling Wing/Wichita Approach Control
Interfacility Coordination Letter of Agreement.
   2.14.1. VFR/IFR Departure versus IFR Arrival. An opposite direction departure must be
   clear of the final approach course before an arriving aircraft can proceed inbound within 10
   NM final from the runway.
   2.14.2. VFR/IFR Arrival versus IFR Departure. An opposite direction arrival must not
   proceed within 10 NM final from the runway prior to a departing aircraft turning to avoid
   conflict.
   2.14.3. VFR aircraft in the pattern will not turn base leg until an opposite direction departure
   is airborne and clear of the final approach course or an opposite direction arrival has landed.
   2.14.4. Arrival versus Arrival. No two IFR/VFR aircraft shall be simultaneously inbound
   inside 10 NM on opposite final approach courses.

                               EMERGENCY PROCEDURES

3.1. Operation of the Primary Crash Alarm System (PCAS) and Secondary Crash Net
(SCN):
   3.1.1. Daily PCAS and SCN Check. To ensure both systems are fully operational, the
   Control Tower shall check the PCAS daily between 0800-0815L. Airfield Management shall
   check the SCN immediately after they receive the PCAS call. Crash net checks taking place
   during times other than those above must be coordinated with all responsible agencies prior
   to activation.
   3.1.2. The Control Tower shall activate the PCAS after receiving information pertaining to
   an aircraft experiencing a declared or observed emergency. Once Airfield Management
   receives a call on the PCAS, Airfield Management will activate the secondary crash net. The
   Watch Supervisor/Senior Controller shall ensure the PCAS is activated for the following
   situations:
      3.1.2.1. In-flight or ground emergencies.
      3.1.2.2. Hot brakes.
      3.1.2.3. No flight plan (unannounced arrivals).
      3.1.2.4. Unsafe weapons or external stores that are not visible to the pilot.

      3.1.3.9. Armament (if applicable).
      3.1.3.10. Hot Cargo (if applicable).
      3.1.3.11. Remarks.
   3.1.4. The Control Tower shall notify the Fire Chief when an emergency aircraft is the next
   aircraft to land. Crash vehicles are not approved to follow the aircraft on the runway unless
   specifically issued clearance by the Control Tower via the Crash Net or via the telephone if
   the Crash Net is inoperative. The Control Tower will provide updated information to
   responding Airfield Management and Fire Department personnel.
   3.1.5. When an emergency is terminated by the on-scene-commander, the Control Tower
   shall verify via landline that Airfield Management has been notified. Airfield Management
   will then pass the information over the secondary crash net.
3.2. Emergency Response Procedures.
   3.2.1. On/off-base crashes. The CP is the central communications agency for all crashes for
   which McConnell AFB may have responsibility. Instructions to aircraft involved in the
   rescue will be passed to the Control Tower via landline from the CP.
   3.2.2. The Control Tower shall use the on-base or the off-base crash grid map to pinpoint a
   crash site. Procedures shall include, but are not limited to:
      3.2.2.1. Requesting range and bearing from a NAVAID (preferable McConnell AFB
      (IAB) TACAN), or a prominent landmark, from an aircraft at the scene (when available).
      3.2.2.2. Requesting any airborne aircraft in contact with Control Tower to orbit the
      accident scene.
   3.2.3. In the event Airfield Management is notified of a crash by means other than the
   PCAS, they will:
      3.2.3.1. Notify the Control Tower via telephone to activate the PCAS.
      3.2.3.2. Activate the secondary crash net.
   3.2.4. The following shall occur when emergency aircraft reach a 10 mile final.
      3.2.4.1. Control Tower personnel shall suspend all runway operations. Tower will
      announce the following over the radio, “McConnell runway operations suspended for
      emergency aircraft 10 mile final, expect holding for 5 minutes”. If both runways are
      available, once the in-flight emergency (IFE) has landed the tower may commence
      operations on the open runway.
      3.2.4.2. Aircraft in any of McConnell AFB’s VFR patterns can expect holding at Crest,
      Yankee, a pattern correction to follow the IFE aircraft (i.e. 360 or extended downwind
      leg) or coordination for departure back to the Wichita Approach radar pattern until the
      situation is resolved.
      3.2.4.3. Once the IFE aircraft has landed and Airfield Management has checked the
      runway, Airfield Management will inform the tower that the runway is open and normal
      operations can resume. Tower will announce the following over the radio, “Emergency
MCCONNELLAFBI13-201 30 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                            21


      aircraft has landed, McConnell runway operations resumed. Continue holding until
      sequenced inbound”.
   3.2.5. Contractors working on the airfield must be notified of in-flight and ground
   emergencies, either by radio or by Airfield Management personnel. If the emergency is
   serious enough and affects the area where the contractors are working that area must be
   evacuated until the emergency is terminated.
   3.2.6. IAW AFI 10-2501, Air Force Emergency Management (EM) Program Planning and
   Operations, the Fire Chief is the Incident Commander.
3.3. External Stores Jettison Area Procedures.
   3.3.1. Under emergency conditions, stores may be jettisoned in any clear area.
   3.3.2. If possible, all live ordinances shall be jettisoned within the confines of Smoky Hill
   Range. Track inbound on the sequence line number (SLN) (channel 118) 208 radial at 4500'
   MSL, and jettison upon reaching the 18 DME point. Jettison area is approximately 200
   meters southeast of the radar circle. If able, contact range control on 316.9, 304.9 or 139.7 or,
   if no response, contact Kansas City Center (363.2) to warn Smoky Hill of impending jettison.
   3.3.3. McConnell AFB External Stores Jettison Area (VFR only): Jettison external stores
   (external tanks and practice or inert ordinance only) on the north third of the aerodrome
   between the runways and between taxiway B and taxiway C on a north-to-south track at 300'
   AGL (see Attachment 2). Control Tower approval is required prior to jettison.
3.4. Fuel Dumping.
   3.4.1. Aerial Fuel Dumping: The fuel dumping area was designated by the 22 OG/CC and is
   located at the Wichita Very High Frequency (VHF) Omnidirectional Range/Tactical Aircraft
   Control (VORTAC) 107 radial between 35 and 55 NM, between FL220 and FL280. At 55
   DME on the 107 radial, make a left standard-rate turn and intercept the 107 radial inbound.
   At 35 DME make a right standard-rate turn to intercept the 107 radial outbound. This
   procedure will keep the aircraft clear of federal airways, limit exposure in Eureka MOA, and
   avoid, to the maximum extent possible, urban areas and water supply sources. Dumping over
   agricultural areas cannot be avoided in the McConnell AFB area.
   3.4.2. Ground Fuel Dumping: The designated location for ground dumping of fuel under
   alert conditions is over the grating on the Operations Ramp, immediately west of building
   1112 (Base Operations). Fuel will be dumped only in a dire emergency. AMOps will notify
   the Fire Department 30 seconds prior to the start of fuel dumping.
3.5. Hot Brake Area and Procedures (See Attachment 2).
   3.5.1. Hot Brake Areas are located on taxiways Bravo and Echo between runways 19L/01R
   & 19R/01L and on Foxtrot Ramp.
   3.5.2. Pilots suspecting hot brakes shall request to taxi to the nearest hot brakes area and
   park the aircraft as desired.
   3.5.3. Runway Operations will be suspended until no longer necessary, as determined by the
   On-Scene Commander.

3.6. Abandonment of Aircraft (Controlled Bail-Out and Ejection).
   3.6.1. The controlled bail out area is 20 DME on the 080 degree radial of the McConnell
   AFB TACAN (37’36"N/96’51"W). When outbound on 080 degree radial at 10,000' MSL,
   eject from aircraft at the 20 DME fix.
   3.6.2. In the event of an aircraft bail-out or ejection, McConnell AFB Tower will use all
   available resources to include, but not limited to, pilot reported position, TACAN radial and
   DME, Standard Terminal Automation Replacement System (STARS) Tower Display
   Workstation and Wichita Approach, to identify the most likely location of the abandoned
   aircraft.
3.7. Personnel/Crash Locator Beacon Signal/Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT)
Response Procedures: Control Tower shall notify Airfield Management and Wichita Approach
Control when an ELT is received and when it has stopped. Airfield Management will notify Life
Support via land line for an ELT received on 243.0. If Life Support does not answer the phone,
CP is the alternate point of contact. If the ELT is received on 121.5, Airfield Management will
contact the Air Force Rescue Coordination Center. NOTE: IAW FAAO 7110.65, operational
ground testing of an ELT is authorized during the first five minutes of each hour. To avoid
confusing the tests with an actual alarm, the testing is restricted to no more than three audible
sweeps.
3.8. Hung Ordnance/Hot Gun Procedures: Hung Ordnance/Forward Firing Explosives/Hung
Gun: McConnell AFB does not support generic flying missions involving combat ordnance;
however, in the event unforeseen circumstances arise (IFE, etc.), park aircraft on Foxtrot Ramp
beginning on F-2 thru F-4 as needed with nose of the aircraft pointing East-Northeast along
established KC-135 parking/taxiing lines. When forward firing missiles or gun systems cannot
be immediately safed, instruct 22d Security Forces Squadron (SFS) to close 40MM range area
and restrict traffic from the intersection of Russell and Mulvane to the south and west for the
duration of the event. Personnel inhabiting the Combat Arms Training and Marksmanship
(CATM) range and associated facilities should be evacuated for the duration of the event.
3.9. Wind Limitations on Control Tower: The Watch Supervisor/Senior Controller on-duty
shall direct a Control Tower evacuation for winds of 50 knots sustained or greater, tornadoes, or
any incident or weather phenomenon deemed necessary.
3.10. Evacuation of ATC and AM Operations Facilities.
   3.10.1. Control Tower Evacuation, building 70, will occur when a natural or man-made
   problem, disaster, or incident renders the building unusable or unsafe. If the evacuation is
   the result of a bomb threat, one person must remain behind to assist the SFS search of the
   building. Alternate ATC facilities are not required and therefore have not been established at
   McConnell AFB.
       3.10.1.1. Wichita Approach Control shall assume air traffic control responsibilities for
       McConnell AFB as an uncontrolled airfield until McConnell AFB Tower returns to
       service.
       3.10.1.2. Control Tower shall activate the crash phone prior to evacuation. Airfield
       Management will then activate the secondary crash phone.
MCCONNELLAFBI13-201 30 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                        23


      3.10.1.3. Tower evacuation will be completed in accordance with McConnell AFB
      Control Tower Operating Instruction 13-204, .
   3.10.2. Airfield Management Evacuation, building 1112, will occur when a natural or man-
   made problem, disaster or incident renders the building unusable or unsafe. If the evacuation
   is the result of a bomb threat, one person must remain behind to assist SFS search the
   building. The tower, building 70, is the primary location for reestablishing Airfield
   Management functions. Evacuation will be accomplished IAW Airfield Management
   Operations OSAA Operating Instruction 13-204, .
3.11. Anti-hijack Procedures: Tab E to Appendix 9 to Annex C of the McConnell AFB
Mission Assurance Plan establishes the procedures to be used in the event of a hijacked or
suspected hijacked aircraft.
3.12. Aircraft Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) Reduction of Service Procedures.
   3.12.1. Airfield Management will contact McConnell AFB Emergency Communication
   Center daily to obtain ARFF capability.
   3.12.2. As changes occur, Fire Department will notify Airfield Management when
   capabilities fall below optimum level of service (OLS), i.e., reduced level of service (RLS),
   critical level of service (CLS) and inadequate level of service, as well as which USAF
   aircraft category will be affected and which ARFF vehicle is out of service or current
   manning status. (See attachment 9)
   3.12.3. Upon notification of ARFF capability other than OLS, Airfield Management will
   notify the Control Tower, CP, Wing Safety, and TFOC, then submit a NOTAM in the
   following format: QFFCG ARFF is Reduced, Critical or Inadequate (as appropriate) of
   service USAF CAT (#) due to (vehicle, agent, and/or personnel) #### gallons remaining (for
   vehicle or agent reduction).
   3.12.4. Installation Leadership should use the Crash Fire Fighting Matrix, mission
   requirements, and risk control measures as appropriate to make a determination in curtailing
   or limiting operations and/or accepting additional risks when ARFF capability is other than
   OLS.

   4.11.1. The maintenance complex area west of Topeka Street and the airfield (red line) and
   the maintenance complex area on the west side of the McConnell AFB runways (the area
   between the security fence and the taxiways) is a maintenance/flying operation work area and
   is considered to be a no hat area for safety and FOD control purposes. Cold weather headgear
   (with no metal attachments) is authorized during appropriate seasons. Headgear must be
   controlled and secured to eliminate any FOD potential.
   4.11.2. Salutes will be rendered throughout McConnell AFB (including no hat areas unless it
   disrupts work being performed) except for the airfield, which is a no salute area.

4.20. Bird/Wildlife Control (Local Bird/Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) Program
Guidelines): Refer to the current base BASH plan for applicable information.
   4.20.1. Bird Watch Conditions (BWC). The following terminology will be used for rapid
   communications to disseminate bird activity information and implement unit operational
   procedures. Bird location should be given along with the condition code. NOTE: The use of
   numbers in defining a BWC is intended as a guide, responsible personnel must assess many
   factors when declaring BWCs. One bird may drive a BWC of Severe, Moderate or Low.
      4.20.1.1. Bird Watch Condition LOW: Concentrations of less than five large birds or 15
      small birds that pose a low probability hazard to flying aircraft.
      4.20.1.2. Bird Watch Condition MODERATE: Concentrations of 5-15 large birds or 15-
      30 small birds observable in locations that represent a probable hazard to safe flying
      operations. Initial takeoffs and full stop landings allowed only when departure and arrival
      routes avoid identified bird activity. Additionally, local IFR/VFR pattern activity ceases.
      4.20.1.3. Bird Watch Condition SEVERE: Heavy concentrations of birds (more than 15
      large birds or 30 small birds) on or above the runways, taxiways, and departure or arrival
      routes. Takeoffs and landings are prohibited without 22 OG/CC or 931 ARG/CC (or
      higher) approval. NOTE: For Boeing flights previously identified as HIGH priority, the
      Pilot-in-Command shall serve as the waiver authority. Under BWC Severe, serious
      consideration must be given to requesting wildlife dispersal and delaying takeoff or
      landing until the bird watch condition is downgraded.
   4.20.2. Low-Level Flights: Aircrew will avoid low-level segments and routes with identified
   bird hazards during periods defined by the Bird Avoidance Model provided by the Air Force
   Safety Center.
   4.20.3. The authority to declare (upgrade or downgrade) BWC’s are as follows:
      4.20.3.1. Upgrading: The upgrade of the BWC can be accomplished by Airfield
      Management, the Control Tower, Flight Safety, or Wildlife Control.
      4.20.3.2. Downgrading: The downgrade of the BWC must be agreed to by two of the
      following four agencies: Airfield Management, the Control Tower, Flight Safety or
      Wildlife Control. The only exception to this requirement is during Nighthawk Migration
      Season (see 22 ARW Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard Plan).
4.21. Supervisor of Flying (SOF) Operating from the Control Tower: There is currently no
requirement for a SOF to be located in the Control Tower.
MCCONNELLAFBI13-201 30 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                31

equipment) intended to be used either wholly or in part for the arrival, departure, and movement
of aircraft.
Airfield— The area to include all runways, taxiways, aprons, and ramps.
Aircraft on Final— Commonly used to mean that an aircraft is on final approach course or is
aligned with a landing area.
Airfield Facilities— Includes: runways, taxiways, parking and servicing areas, ATC facilities,
Airfield Management, navigational aids, aircraft fire suppression and rescue services and airfield
lighting systems.
Airfield Manager (AFM)— Works directly for the AOF/CC and manages airfield management
facilities to ensure effective support to the base flying mission and transient aircrews.
Airfield Management— A function that plans, organizes and directs airfield activities to
include airfield construction/repairs, airfield driving program, ice/snow removal operations,
Bird/Wildlife control, etc. Conducts airfield inspections and checks for safety and compliance
with planning and design criteria.       Procures, maintains, and produces information on safe
operation of aircraft through the national and international airspace system such as Flight
Information Publications, aeronautical charts and maps, Notice to Airmen (NOTAM), local
airfield and navigational aid status, and weather information.          Process domestic and
international flight plans.
Airfield Management Operations (AMOps)— Provides aircrews with flight plan processing
and planning services.
Controlled Movement Area (CMA)— As defined in Airfield Driving Instructions, any portion
of the airfield requiring aircraft, vehicles and pedestrians to obtain specific Air Traffic Control
approval for access (normally via two-way radio contact with the control tower). Controlled
Movement Areas include but are not limited to areas used for takeoff, landing. NOTE: This
definition is used in lieu of "movement area" as defined in the FAA Pilot Controller Glossary.
Runways, (Taxiway D, E, F), any paved surface inside a runway hold line, and any grass area
inside the painted holdlines on either side of the runway edge requiring tower clearance for entry.
Foreign Object Debris (FOD)— Any debris on the airfield that can cause damage to an aircraft.
A few examples are tools, plastic packing materials, rocks, discarded parts from maintenance
activities, etc. Any of these objects can shred internal parts if ingested into a jet engine and can
become deadly projectiles. FOD can create an extremely hazardous and costly situation during
taxiing, takeoff and landing; therefore, it is imperative that everyone on the airfield be alert to
FOD and removes it immediately.
Light Gun— A handheld directional light signaling device which emits a brilliant narrow beam
of white, green, or red light as selected by the tower controller. The color and type of light
transmitted can be used to approve or disapprove anticipated pilot actions where radio

communication is not available. The light gun is used for controlling traffic operating in the
vicinity of the airport and on the airport movement area.
Major Command (MAJCOM)— For the purpose of this instruction, includes all USAF Major
Commands plus the Air National Guard Readiness Center, Air Force Reserve Command, Direct
Reporting Units, and Field Operating Agencies. MAJCOM also refers to the OPR for Airfield
Operations in this AFI.
Parking Ramp/Apron— Areas where aircraft are parked, loaded and unloaded and serviced
between flights. Vehicles and aircraft operate in close proximity in these areas, so it is vital to
maintain a safe distance between your vehicle and aircraft. Always yield to aircraft and never
drive under an aircraft or its wings. Slow speed and extreme caution are required in these areas.
Ramp— Either concrete or asphalt (depending on the weight of the aircraft and the sub-base of
the ground beneath) used to park aircraft or equipment.
Restricted Area— An area on the airfield designated for the use by aircraft/equipment requiring
security protection level. It is marked with signs prior to entering and is surrounded by a redline
painted on the ground. Warning signs are posted every 100’ along the boundary. Personnel
requiring entry into a restricted area must have an Air Force security line badge issued by SFS.
Runway— A defined rectangular area on an airfield prepared for the landing and takeoff of
aircraft.
Taxiway— A paved surface for taxiing aircraft from parking ramp to runway.
