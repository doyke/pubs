This instruction implements AFMAN 91-201, Explosives Safety Standards, AF Policy Directive
91-2, Safety Programs, and AFI 91-202, The US Air Force Mishap Prevention Program. It
establishes responsibilities and procedures for the Grand Forks Air Force Base (GFAFB)
Weapons Safety and Transportation of Hazardous Cargo Program. The goal of the program is to
assist commanders involved with a munitions, explosives and/or transportation of hazardous
cargo operation to carry out the unit mission without accidental injury to or loss of personnel,
property or equipment. This program applies to all Department of Defense (DoD), organizations
and contractors who handle munitions or explosives on GFAFB or GFAFB leased land, use AF
owned storage facilities, and transport explosives or hazardous cargo on GFAFB. The basic
tenants of Operational Risk Management will be followed in the execution and application of
this instruction. Supervisors at all levels will be engaged to assess risks and apply risk controls,
when appropriate. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this
publication are maintained in accordance with (IAW) Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363,
Management of Records, and disposed of IAW the Air Force Records Information Management
System (AFRIMS). Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to the
Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of
Publication; route AF Forms 847 from the field through the appropriate functional’s chain of
command.
