ited to, granting, suspending, or revoking the privilege to operate a privately owned vehicle (POV); regis-
tration of POVs; administration of vehicle registration and driver performance records; driver
improvement programs; police traffic supervision; and off-installation traffic activities.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This revision incorporates Interim Change (IC) 2000-1. It makes changes to paragraph 4.9.3. A bar (|)
indicates revision from previous edition. See the last attachment of the publication for the complete IC.
(45SW) This revision deletes paragraph 3.4.4.3.; adds paragraph 3.5.6.2. (Added) Individuals who plan
to enter their vehicles into a consignment status at an off-base car dealership must terminate their vehicle
base registration and remove the DD Form 2220 from their vehicle before placing the vehicle into con-
signment status. Although the car title remains in the existing owner’s name until sold, leaving the DD
Form 2220 on the vehicle during consignment is a potential security risk; changes paragraph 4.8.5.15. to
2                                                                                AFI31-204_45SWSUP1_I 1 AUGUST 2003


read, Privately procured rental vehicles (i.e., U-Haul, Ryder, etc.) and trailers are prohibited from parking
on the installation. For exceptions see para 4.8.5.18. (Added); adds paragraph 4.8.5.17. (Added) Pri-
vately owned trailers, personal watercraft, sailboats, recreational vehicles and campers are prohibited
from parking on the installation except in the following areas: Fam Camp, Outdoor Recreation(boat
dock--rental boats), Recreational vehicle lot(Services Compound), Auto Sales (For sale lot) and the
Marina (Yacht Club). These vehicles must be properly registered with the 45th Services Squadron; and
adds paragraph 4.8.5.18. (Added) To provide limited service for those personnel who are executing a “Do
It Yourself” move or are staying in temporary lodging, an area has been designated at the parking lot south
of North housing adjacent to Riverside TLF. This lot will allow base customers to store small trailers and
privately rented moving trucks for a seven day period on a cost free, space available basis. Boats, recre-
ational vehicles and POV’s are not permitted in this lot. Upon check-in at lodging or base housing, staff
will inform guests where they may park their trailers and to contact 45 SFS for permit instructions. Per-
sonnel may receive a permit from Security Forces by visiting the law enforcement desk that will be valid
for a 7 day period. Trailers and vehicles not moved after the allotted time will be cited and owners con-
tacted for immediate removal. Trailers and equipment parked in the designated short-term lot not regis-
tered with Security Forces will be considered illegally parked. Impound action may be initiated if
equipment is left abandoned for more than 72 hours, per AFI31-204. A bar ( | ) indicates changes from the
previous edition.

                                                Chapter 2

                                       DRIVING PRIVILEGES

2.1. Requirements for Driving Privileges.
    2.1.1. Driving a government owned vehicle (GOV) or POV on an Air Force installation is a privilege
    granted by the installation commander. If you accept that privilege, you must comply with the laws
    and instructions governing motor vehicle operation and registration on the installation. Consequently,
    everyone operating a motor vehicle on a military installation must produce, upon request from the
    security police, the following:
       2.1.1.1. Proof of vehicle ownership or registration if required by the issuing authority.
       2.1.1.1. (45SW) Maintain privately owned vehicle registration in the vehicle or on the driver’s
       person while operating the vehicle.
       2.1.1.2. A valid state, overseas command, host nation, or international driver’s license and/or AF
       Form 2293, US Air Force Motor Vehicle Operator’s Identification Card, supported by a DD
       Form 2, US Armed Forces Identification Card. Locally determine acceptable identification
       media for civilian personnel and base contractors. Note: Each installation commander must deter-
       mine if international drivers licenses are recognized and accepted by the local (civilian) jurisdic-
       tion, and if so, will their use be authorized on the installation. As a general rule, most CONUS
       civilian jurisdictions will honor use of international drivers licenses for short periods of time by
       non-resident visitors and assigned military personnel. When practical, installation commanders
       should assimilate local policy to preclude conflicting policy.
           2.1.1.2.1. (Added-45SW) International driver’s licenses are accepted for transient vehicle
           operation. The AF Form 2293, U.S. Air Force Motor Vehicle Operator Identification Card,
           is not required for contractor-operated vehicles. However, if the contractor operates govern-
           ment provided equipment that is waived from commercial licensing under P. L. 99-540 (such
           as fire fighting equipment), issuance of an AF Form 2293 is required. Proof of authorization
           for government operation consists of a valid, signed AF Form 1800, Operator’s Inspection
           Guide and Trouble Report, and a valid state license. Military personnel with an expired
           driver’s license are governed by issuing state requirements.
       2.1.1.3. If required by the jurisdiction in which the vehicle is operated, a valid record of motor
       vehicle safety inspection, emission control test, or any other test, evaluation, safety inspection, or
       other documents required by local, state, or host nation law or agreement. Note: In some
       instances, a state or other governing jurisdiction in which a vehicle is registered may require, as a
       condition for keeping registration/plates issued by that state or jurisdiction, a safety or other
       inspection even when the vehicle is operated in another state or jurisdiction. Though not enforce-
       able (in another state), failure to comply may invalidate the vehicle registration leaving the owner/
       operator in a precarious legal position. In such cases, it becomes the owner's responsibility to
       comply with their "home state" or other issuing jurisdiction requirements in addition to host state
       requirements. Owners should secure host registration when unable to comply with licensing and/
       or registration requirements issued by their home state or other jurisdiction.
       2.1.1.4. Proof of current vehicle insurance when required by state, host nation, or the installation
       commander.
AFI31-204_45SWSUP1_I 1 AUGUST 2003                                                                         9


       2.1.1.4. (45SW) Maintain proof of a current POV insurance policy in the vehicle or on the driv-
       ers’ person.
       2.1.1.5. (Added-45SW) PAFB Flight Line Driver’s Certification Operators on the PAFB flight
       line or aircraft taxiway/parking apron must posses an AF Form 483, Certificate of Competency
       (Flight Line Certification), or an AF Form 2293 stamped with “AUTH-FLT LINE PAFB”.

2.2. Stopping and Inspecting Personnel or Vehicles.
   2.2.1. The security police may stop vehicles on military installations based on the installation com-
   mander's authority. The following principles govern the stopping of motor vehicles:
       2.2.1.1. In overseas areas, security police may stop, search, and detain vehicles on or off base as
       determined by host nation agreements and local command policy.
       2.2.1.2. AFI 31-209, The Air Force Resource Protection Program, local command instructions,
       and policies established by the installation commander will detail stop, inspection, search, and
       impoundment of motor vehicles at CONUS installation entry gates and in Air Force restricted
       areas.
           2.2.1.2.1. (Added-45SW) Vehicles and personnel are subject to random inspections at instal-
           lation entry gates in accordance with procedures set forth in AFI 31-204, paragraph 2.2. and
           SWI 31-102, paragraph 4.6. Security Forces should cite POVs with defects or POVs in viola-
           tion of the law when conducting entry checks.
           2.2.1.2.2. (Added-45SW) Individuals who refuse consent to Security Forces during a com-
           mander-directed random vehicle inspection while on any 45 SW installation. The period of
           suspension shall be for 1 year from the date of notification.
       2.2.1.3. On-base traffic stops and inspections (other than at entry gates and restricted areas) of
       POVs is authorized when there is a reasonable basis to believe it’s necessary to enforce a traffic
       regulation or when there is suspicion of criminal activity.
   2.2.2. MAJCOMs responsible for overseas military installations must provide their installation com-
   manders with written guidelines governing stop, inspection, search, and impoundment of vehicles.
   This guidance must reflect host nation agreements and pass appropriate legal review. Note: A theater
   commander or those commanding unified forces may direct policy covering all installations under
   their command. In this case, MAJCOMs must review those policies before issuing their guidance.

2.3. Implied Consent to Blood, Breath, or Urine Tests. Drivers give consent to evidential tests for
alcohol or other drug content of their blood, breath, and/or urine as a condition to accepting installation
driving privileges. This consent applies when lawfully detained, apprehended, or cited for any impaired
driving offense committed while driving or in physical control of a motor vehicle on an Air Force instal-
lation.

2.4. Implied Consent to Vehicle Impoundment. As a condition to accepting installation driving privi-
leges, drivers must give their consent for the removal and temporary impoundment of their POV if their
POV is: 1) Illegally parked for unreasonable periods; 2) Interferes with traffic operations; 3) Creates a
safety hazard; 4) Disabled by accident or incident; 5) Left unattended in, or adjacent to, a restricted, con-
trolled, or off-limits area; and 6) Abandoned. Drivers also agree to reimburse an authorized agency or
10                                                          AFI31-204_45SWSUP1_I 1 AUGUST 2003


contractor for the cost of towing, storage, and disposal should a need arise to remove or impound their
motor vehicle because of a situation described above.
     2.4.1. Installation commanders define in local procedures or supplement to this instruction, the defi-
     nitions for "unreasonable periods," "abandoned," and other terms relevant to enforcement action
     under paragraph 2.4. Incorporate those instructions, procedures, and definitions into the local instal-
     lation traffic code and make them known to the general public.

2.5. Suspension or Revocation of Driving Privileges . Installation commanders may suspend or
revoke installation driving privileges and POV registration for lawful reasons both related and unrelated
to traffic violations or safe vehicle operations. Installation commanders must incorporate procedures gov-
erning suspension and revocation in local publications or supplement to this instruction. Make these
known to the general public.
     2.5.1. Suspensions.
        2.5.1.1. Installation commanders can suspend driving privileges for serious violations or when
        lesser measures fail to improve a driver's performance. The commander may also suspend or
        revoke licenses for up to 12 months if a driver continually violates installation parking standards,
        or habitually violates other standards considered non-moving in nature. Installation commanders
        determine suspension and revocation policy for non-moving violations, as well as what constitutes
        a non-moving violation on their installation (i.e., performing unauthorized repair; failure to regis-
        ter; unauthorized modifications or alterations; failure to maintain safety standards, etc.). Make
        these standards part of the local installation traffic code and take reasonable steps to make them
        known to the general public.
        2.5.1.2. The installation commander has discretionary authority and may withdraw anyone's
        authorization to operate a government or privately owned motor vehicle on the installation.
            2.5.1.2.1. (Added-45SW) For all individuals who are issued a citation for not wearing a seat-
            belt while operating a government/privately owned vehicle on any 45th Space Wing Installa-
            tion, the period of suspension shall be for 1 month for the first offense and 1 year for every
            offense thereafter. Suspension period begins on the date of notification.
        2.5.1.3. Installation commanders will immediately suspend installation GOV or POV driving
        privileges pending resolution of an intoxicated driving incident which involves active duty mili-
        tary personnel, their family members, retired members of the military service, and DoD civilian
        personnel. This applies regardless of the geographic location of an intoxicated driving incident.
        Installation commanders can only suspend privileges of non-DoD affiliated civilians for incidents
        occurring on the installation or in the areas subject to their military traffic jurisdiction. After a
        review of available evidence as specified in paragraph 2.6., suspend driver’s privileges pending
        resolution of the intoxicated driving incident under the circumstances outlined below:
            2.5.1.3.1. Refusal to take or complete a lawfully requested chemical test to determine blood
            alcohol content BAC) or breath alcohol content (BrAC) for alcohol or other drugs.
            2.5.1.3.2. Operating a motor vehicle with BAC or BrAC of 0.10 percent by volume or higher.
            2.5.1.3.2. (45SW) Blood Alcohol Content (BAC): Charge non-active duty persons with a
            BAC of .08 or more with Driving Under the Influence (DUI); charge non-active duty persons
            with a BAC of .05 -.08 with Driving While Impaired. (FS 316.193 (a), (b), and (c)).
AFI31-204_45SWSUP1_I 1 AUGUST 2003                                                                      11


          2.5.1.3.3. Operating a motor vehicle with a BAC or BrAC below 0.10 percent blood alcohol
          by volume if the jurisdiction in which the vehicle is operated imposes a suspension for a BAC
          or BrAC level below 0.10.
          2.5.1.3.4. On an arrest report or other official document reasonably showing an intoxicated
          driving incident occurred.
   2.5.2. Revocation.
      2.5.2.1. The installation commander will immediately revoke driving privileges for a period of
      not less than one year in the following circumstances:
          2.5.2.1.1. A person is lawfully detained for intoxicated driving and refuses to submit to or
          complete tests to measure blood alcohol or drug content as required by the law of the jurisdic-
          tion, installation traffic code, or this instruction.
          2.5.2.1.2. A conviction, nonjudicial punishment, or a military or civilian administrative action
          resulting in the suspension or revocation of a driver’s license for intoxicated driving. Official
          documentation is required as the basis for this type of revocation action.
              2.5.2.1.2.1. (Added-45SW) For individuals receiving administrative action for driving
              under the influence of alcohol by on base security forces or civilian law enforcement agen-
              cies, the period of suspension shall be for 1 year from the date of notification.
          2.5.2.1.3. When a serious incident involving a motor vehicle occurs and the installation com-
          mander determines immediate revocation of driving privileges is required to preserve public
          safety or the good order and discipline of military personnel.
      2.5.2.2. The CSP develops plans and procedures to forward revocation, suspension, and driving
      records to gaining commanders and to initiate appropriate staff action when receiving similar
      records from losing commanders of inbound personnel.
      2.5.2.3. When temporary suspensions are followed by revocations, compute the revocation period
      from the original suspension date, exclusive of any period during which full driving privileges
      were restored pending resolution of charges.
      2.5.2.4. Installation commanders may impose multiple suspensions to run consecutively or con-
      currently.
      2.5.2.5. (Added-45SW) Individuals who accumulate 12 traffic points in a 12 month period, or 18
      points in a 24 month period must attend a Florida Department of Transportation approved traffic
      school at their own cost in order to re-instate driving privileges. A list of approved schools can be
      obtained from 45 SFS/SFA.

2.6. Reciprocal Procedures.
   2.6.1. Air Force installation commanders will honor revocations issued by other installation com-
   manders regardless of service component affiliation. Revocations remain in effect during reassign-
   ment unless the issuing authority terminates the revocation before reassignment. Installation
   commander may honor suspensions as determined on a case by case basis. Anyone with suspended or
   revocated privileges may petition an installation commander for partial or limited driving privileges.

2.7. Administrative Due Process for Suspensions and Revocations.
12                                                           AFI31-204_45SWSUP1_I 1 AUGUST 2003


     2.7.1. When considering suspending or revoking someone’s driving privileges, notify that person in
     writing and tell them what action you are taking and the reason for it. Coordinate this notice with the
     base legal office.
     2.7.2. Except for incidents outlined in para 2.5.1.3. and 2.5.2.1., do not suspend or revoke a person's
     driving privileges until they are notified (or reasonable attempts made) and offered an administrative
     hearing. Installation commanders determine when a suspension or revocation takes effect once mak-
     ing or attempting this written notice. Only in unusual circumstances should you make verbal notifica-
     tions. Unless an application for a hearing is made within the prescribed period, suspension or
     revocation takes place on the prescribed date and time. Installation commanders determine the time
     period for staying a suspension or revocation action after receiving a request for a administrative hear-
     ing. For offenses outlined in para 2.5.1.3. and 2.5.2.1, an installation commander will authorize an
     immediate preliminary suspension based on reliable evidence. Such evidence can include witness
     statements, a military or civilian police report, chemical test results, a refusal to complete chemical
     testing, video tapes, written statements, field sobriety test results, or other evidence.
        2.7.2.1. Installation commanders or their designee must conduct evidence reviews as soon as pos-
        sible, but no later than three duty days following final assembly of evidence.
        2.7.2.2. For active duty military personnel, send a written notice of preliminary suspension for
        intoxicated driving to their commander or reasonable equivalent. For non-installation, non-DoD
        affiliated civilians, present the written notice of preliminary suspension for intoxicated driving
        either in person (preferred) or by certified mail. If the person is employed on the installation, send
        the notice to their commander or reasonable equivalent.
            2.7.2.2.1. (Added-45SW) Security Forces personnel will immediately issue preliminary sus-
            pension letters to individuals detained for DUI or DWI. 45 MSG/CC will sign letters for mem-
            bers assigned to, or incidents occurring at, at PAFB and CCAFS. Pre-signed letters will be
            effective upon receipt.
        2.7.2.3. Advise the individual of the following in the preliminary suspension notification for
        intoxicated driving:
            2.7.2.3.1. Suspension can be made a revocation under the authority of paragraph 2.5.2. of this
            AFI.
            2.7.2.3.2. The right to request restoration of driving privileges pending investigation or reso-
            lution of the incident (direct request letters to the installation commander or designee).
            2.7.2.3.2. (45SW) Any individual issued a suspension of installation driving privileges letter
            who believes compelling reasons exist to modify or terminate the suspension, may submit a
            written request to 45 SFS/SFAR through their unit commander, if applicable. Request will
            then be forwarded to the 45 MSG/CC for final disposition.
            2.7.2.3.3. The right of military personnel to present evidence and witnesses and be repre-
            sented by a civilian counsel (at their own expense) or assigned military counsel. Commanders
            determine the availability of specific (by name) military counsel requests.
            2.7.2.3.4. The right of DoD civilian employees to have a personal representative present at the
            administrative hearing in accordance with applicable laws and instructions.
AFI31-204_45SWSUP1_I 1 AUGUST 2003                                                                        13


           2.7.2.3.5. Amount of time the individual has to respond and request the administrative hearing
           before the preliminary suspension or revocation becomes permanent.
           2.7.2.3.6. Direction to sign the acknowledgment of receipt and to return the signed letter to
           the address shown in the letter.
           2.7.2.3.7. Requested hearings must take place within a reasonable period which is determined
           by the installation commander. A preliminary suspension for intoxicated driving remains in
           effect until the installation commander makes a final decision. However, if no decision is
           made within 30 days of the preliminary suspension or revocation, restore full driving privi-
           leges until the accused is notified of the final hearing results.
   2.7.3. Hearings for intoxicated driving will cover only the pertinent issues of whether: 1) The law
   enforcement official had reasonable grounds to believe the person was driving or was in physical con-
   trol of a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or other drugs; 2) The person was lawfully
   cited or apprehended for an intoxicated driving offense; 3) The person was asked to submit to a test for
   alcohol or other drug content of blood, breath, or urine and was informed of the consequences for
   refusing to take or complete such a test; 4) The person refused to submit to the test for alcohol, breath,
   or urine; failed to complete the test; submitted to the test and the result exceeded the amount of
   allowed blood alcohol content; results indicate the presence of other drugs for an on-installation
   apprehension or in violation of state laws for an off-installation apprehension; and 5) The testing
   methods used were valid and reliable, and the results accurately recorded and evaluated.
       2.7.3.1. For revocation actions under paragraph 2.5.2.1. for intoxicated driving, the revocation is
       mandatory on conviction or other findings that confirm the charge.
           2.7.3.1.1. The date of conviction or other findings that confirm the charge is the effective date
           of the revocation.
           2.7.3.1.2. You may place the notice that revocation is automatic in the suspension letter, or
           send a separate letter. Revocation is not effective until receipt of the written notice, or the
           showing that you made reasonable attempts to notify the individual.
           2.7.3.1.3. Revocations cancel any partial or restricted driving privileges previously granted.
           Once revocation is acknowledged, a person may petition for the restoration of all or partial
           driving privileges.

2.8. Alcohol and Drug Abuse Programs.
   2.8.1. Refer military personnel involved in any intoxicated (drug or alcohol) motor vehicle incident to
   Substance Abuse Office, Drug and Alcohol Control for evaluation.

2.9. Restoration of Driving Privileges on Acquittal. When an official report or finding determines
lack of guilt (not guilty) or when charges are dismissed or reduced to an offense not amounting to intoxi-
cated driving, vacate the suspension of driving privileges except when:
   2.9.1. The preliminary suspension was based on refusal to take a BAC test.
   2.9.2. Operating a motor vehicle with a BAC of 0.10 percent by volume or higher or in violation of
   the law of the jurisdiction that is bring assimilated on the military installation.

     2.9.3. The person was driving or in physical control of a motor vehicle while under another prelimi-
     nary suspension or revocation.
     2.9.4. The state or host nation authorities made an administrative determination to suspend or revoke
     driving privileges based on local law or pertinent regulations.
     2.9.5. The individual failed to complete a formally directed substance abuse or driver’s training pro-
     gram.

2.10. Restricted Driving Privileges or Probation.
     2.10.1. Unless prohibited by higher authority, host nation authority, or other publication, installation
     commanders may authorize partial or restricted driving privileges to those whose authority to drive on
     military installations was suspended or revocated by a military service authority. Ensure the individ-
     ual’s driving credentials (civilian state, international, host nation, etc.) are still valid.
     2.10.1. (45SW) Send requests for partial or restricted driving privileges or applications for an admin-
     istrative hearing to 45 SFS/SFAR through their unit commander, if applicable, or for CCAFS MSG/
     CC via the Det. 1, 45 MSG/CC. Request will then be forwarded to the 45 MSG for final disposition.
     2.10.2. Without due cause, do not grant restricted driving privileges, probation, or reinstatement to
     any person whose civilian driver’s license is under suspension or revocation by a state, federal, or host
     nation licensing authority. If absolutely necessary to do so (and for on base privileges only), coordi-
     nate with the installation staff judge advocate. Note: This option applies only to installations exercis-
     ing exclusive military jurisdiction. Outline procedures for applying for partial or restricted privileges
     in the base supplement to this AFI or in another appropriate publication. Only consider requests in
     which there is extreme hardship and there are no other workable alternatives. Do not consider the
     granting of limited privileges as an alternative to administrative discharge action when discharge is
     the more appropriate action. Installation commanders must weigh heavily the potential liability
     inherent when an individual with a suspended or revoked state, host nation, or other license is
     allowed to operate a motor vehicle on the installation. Administrative separation may be appropri-
     ate when the loss of driving privileges renders someone ineffective and incapable of performing their
     military duties, and a change in duty position is not reasonable.
     2.10.3. (Added-45SW) Individuals with revoked or suspended installation driving privileges cannot
     operate a government vehicle unless granted restricted privileges. Unit commanders must ensure these
     individuals do not keep their government driver’s license or AF Form 483 for flight line operations.
     Forward government driver’s license documents to 45 SGS/LGTO and AF Form 483 to 45 OSS/DOG
     for entry in the individual’s permanent driving record.

2.11. Extensions of Suspensions and Revocations.
     2.11.1. Increase by two years the suspension or revocation period when someone is discovered driv-
     ing in violation of their original suspension or revocation. The unit or installation commander may
     also take administrative or disciplinary action.
     2.11.2. Extend the suspension or revocation of installation driving privileges until the offender com-
     pletes an approved remedial driver training course, drug or alcohol program, or other program deemed
     necessary by the installation commander or local authorities.

2.12. Reciprocal State-Military Action.
AFI31-204_45SWSUP1_I 1 AUGUST 2003                                                                    15


  2.12.1. Statutory authority may exist within some host nations or states for reciprocal suspension and
  revocation of driving privileges. If so, the installation commander should honor the reciprocal agree-
  ments with the state or host nation driver licensing authorities. On receipt of written notice, the
  receiving party may suspend or revoke driving privileges as if the violations or incidents occurred
  within its own jurisdiction.
     2.12.1.1. Use the following procedures if statutory authority does not provide for formal military
     reciprocity:
         2.12.1.1.1. When such authority suspends or revokes a license, automatically terminate the
         individual’s installation GOV and POV driving privileges. Take only comparable military
         administrative actions (suspensions, revocation, or point assessment) for those off-base viola-
         tions reported by local, state, or host nation authorities.
         2.12.1.1.2. In the CONUS, notify the licensing authority of the state where a license is issued
         when revoking a person’s installation driving privileges (for a period of one year or more only)
         following final adjudication of an intoxicated driving offense or for refusal to submit to a
         BAC/BrAC test. Include in the notification the basis for the revocation and the BAC/BrAC
         level.
  2.12.2. Provisions of the applicable status of forces agreement (SOFA) and the law of the host nation
  concerning reciprocal suspension and revocation can affect OCONUS installation commanders.
  When permitted at a particular overseas installation and to the extent an agreement concerning reci-
  procity exists, the installation commander must have prior authorization to negotiate and conclude
  such an international agreement in accordance with applicable directives.

                                 MOTOR VEHICLE REGISTRATION

3.1. Registration Policy.
     3.1.1. Register motor vehicles according to guidance in this instruction and policies established by
     the installation commander. Installation commanders may extend registration to anyone they deem
     appropriate. This may include reserve force personnel who maintain close affiliation with the instal-
     lation and other persons who frequently visit the base, such as local dignitaries, community leaders,
     retired civilian employees, civil air patrol members, etc.
        3.1.1.1. Consistent with base entry policy in AFI 31-209, the installation commander is responsi-
        ble for ensuring vehicles entering their installation are controlled. Vehicles entering Air Force
        installations must be registered or meet other entry requirements outlined in paragraph 3.2. Eligi-
        ble vehicle registrants include assigned active duty military and civilian personnel working on
        base, retired military personnel, reserve and national guard personnel assigned to a unit or
        attached for training on an active installation or a reserve or national guard base or facility, and
        survivors of deceased active duty and retired military members who are authorized to use base
        facilities. The installation commander may authorize the registration of vehicles that are in the
        custody of or owned by dependents, step-parents, or guardians of minor children authorized to use
        base facilities. A dependent living away from home may require a letter stating acceptance of
        responsibility from the military sponsor to support an application for vehicle registration. Further-
        more, a person need not own the vehicle to register it; however, they must have a lease agreement,
        power of attorney, or notarized statement from the owner of the vehicle granting them permission
        to use the vehicle and specifying the inclusive use dates.
        3.1.1.2. Treat rental vehicles as government vehicles when being used for official business by
        military or DoD personnel. Check the driver's installation entry credentials and if all is in order,
        the vehicle may proceed in the same manner as a marked government vehicle.
        3.1.1.3. (Added-45SW) All personnel who live or work on PAFB, or frequently use the facilities,
        must register POVs within 30 days of their assignment to PAFB/CCAFS or the date of vehicle
        purchase. Individuals badged for access to CCAFS may present their badge for access to Patrick
        AFB in lieu of registering their vehicle.
        3.1.1.4. (Added-45SW) Renew POV registration in the sponsor’s birth month in the year of expi-
        ration.
        3.1.1.5. (Added-45SW) Dependents whose active duty sponsor is assigned overseas must show
        sponsor’s orders to register a POV. Family members under the age of 18 must show registration in
        both the sponsor’s and the family member's name or a letter from the sponsor giving authorization
        to operate and register the POV.
        3.1.1.6. (Added-45SW) To register a motorcycle, individuals must posses a valid state driver’s
        license (with motorcycle endorsement if required by the state), registration, and proof of insur-
        ance. Military and DoD civilians (to include NAF) must possess a motorcycle safety foundation
        (MSF) course completion card. If personnel do not have a MSF card, they must complete the 45
        SW/SE motorcycle safety course or equivalent, and carry this card while operating the motorcy-
        cle. If personnel have not attended the course, issue them an AF Form 75, Visitor/Vehicle Pass,
AFI31-204_45SWSUP1_I 1 AUGUST 2003                                                                     17


     which expires on the completion date of the next scheduled class. For scheduled class dates call
     45 SW/SEG. Registered owners of motorcycles are responsible for incidents and accidents if they
     loan their motorcycle to a person who has not attended the motorcycle safety course.
         3.1.1.6.1. (Added-45SW) Personnel not wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) accord-
         ing to DODI 6055.4 and AFI91-207 will:
         3.1.1.6.2. (Added-45SW) Be refused entry at installation gates. Military personnel will be
         cited and required to park their motorcycle until the appropriate PPE can be obtained.
         3.1.1.6.3. (Added-45SW) Be issued a DD Form 1408, Armed Forces Traffic Citation,
         escorted to the nearest gate, and assessed four points according to AFI31-204, Table 5.2. A
         copy of tickets issued to Air Force personnel will be forwarded to their unit commander. A
         copy of tickets issued to a contractor will be forwarded to 45 CONS. A copy of tickets issued
         to all other individuals will be forwarded to 45 MSG/CC (if at PAFB) or to the Det 1, 45 MSG/
         CC (if at CCAFS).
  3.1.2. Vehicles intended for construction and material handling or used solely off the road are not
  usually registered as motor vehicles. Installation commanders determine the need and method for reg-
  istering off road vehicles (ORV) on the installation. However, ORV owners must register and license
  the vehicle prior to its operation on installation roadways.
  3.1.3. When unit vehicle registration (via orderly rooms) is authorized by the installation commander,
  each unit commander can grant limited temporary registration for up to 45 days pending permanent
  registration, or in other circumstances for longer terms.
  3.1.4. Air Force installations and activities honor the DD Form 2220, DOD Registered Vehicle
  Decal, issued by other military or DoD organizations.
  3.1.5. Use of AF Form 75, Visitor/Vehicle Pass. The AF Form 75 is one method to control and iden-
  tify personnel and vehicles on a temporary basis. You can give it to installation visitors who do not
  have the authorized personal or vehicle credentials needed for unescorted or unchecked entry to the
  base. Installation commanders determine the use of AF Forms 75 on their installation and, if used, to
  what degree and to whom issued. If used, develop local policy and procedures governing the issue
  and control of visitor passes. Issue other access credentials when a pass is needed for longer than one
  year.
     3.1.5.1. How to process the AF Form 75:
         3.1.5.1.1. Ask the visitor to fill out the form and sign the consent to search and towing/
         impoundment warning.
         3.1.5.1.2. Use either the driver's license, state vehicle registration, or passport (overseas) or
         other recognized credential according to para 2.1.1.
         3.1.5.1.3. Display the form so one can view it from outside the vehicle.
         3.1.5.1.4. Installation commanders determine if and how to retrieve passes once the visit is
         finished.
     3.1.5.2. (Added-45SW) To receive an AF Form 75 at PAFB, sponsored visitors must show a valid
     state driver’s license and proof of current state registration and insurance.
18                                                          AFI31-204_45SWSUP1_I 1 AUGUST 2003


        3.1.5.3. (Added-45SW) Upon sponsor’s request, passes may be renewed (extended) after 30 days.
        Extended passes are issued during duty hours at building 577, Pass and Registration Section. The
        sponsor must be present.
        3.1.5.4. (Added-45SW) The AF Form 75 is not required when:
            3.1.5.4.1. (Added-45SW) TDY and PCS personnel (with orders) who operate rental vehicles
            (maintain rental agreement in the vehicle).
            3.1.5.4.2. (Added-45SW) Group activities (parties, tournaments, classes, etc.) with more than
            10 guests will submit requests in writing to 45 SFS/SFO at least 3 duty days prior to the event.
            Include the event, time, date, location, names of guests, and the sponsors telephone number.
            The sponsor is responsible for all the guests while they are on the installation.
            3.1.5.4.3. (Added-45SW) Individuals and organizations contracted to provide services will be
            issued a badge by 45 SFS/SFOP for the length of the contract (not to exceed 1 year). Contrac-
            tors may renew badges 30 days prior to expiration.
            3.1.5.4.4. (Added-45SW) Marked commercial vehicles with a PAFB bill of lading, invoice or
            work order. Customer identification and contact telephone numbers are required.
            3.1.5.4.5. (Added-45SW) Taxis entering the installation carrying a passenger with a military
            identification card or other valid forms of identification. Taxis arriving to pick up passengers
            must provide verification they have authority to enter the installation.
            3.1.5.4.6. (Added-45SW) Federal, state, county or city owned vehicles are authorized entry
            when on official business and the driver produces identification from that agency.
     3.1.6. The installation commander determines local policy on authorizing and honoring other vehicle
     registration systems and decals of nonmilitary or non-DoD tenant activities tenanted on the installa-
     tion. Tenant-operated registration systems must meet the requirements of this instruction for:
        3.1.6.1. Complying with registration prerequisites and individual responsibilities in this instruc-
        tion and on the AF Form 533, Certificate of Compliance-Private Motor Vehicle Registration
        (or its equivalent).
        3.1.6.2. Displaying decals on the vehicle.
        3.1.6.3. Storing, issuing, and recovering decals.
     3.1.7. Installation commanders can implement decentralized POV registration among installation
     units. However, the security police must have 24-hour access to registrant information on all registra-
     tion systems used on the installation.

3.2. Registration and Driver Requirements. Registration systems for POVs on Air Force installations
will include the requirements specified below. Overseas commands and overseas installations should
modify these procedures to conform with local and international agreements. All motorcycle operators
must comply with the requirements of AFI 91-207 prior to registering a motorcycle. Individuals must
have the following credentials immediately available upon demand as required by state law or policies
established by the installation commander. 1) A valid state, overseas command, host nation, or interna-
tional driver’s license (as applicable) supported by DD Form 2, or other appropriate identification for
DoD civilians; 2) A certificate of state registration as required by the state or authority in which the vehi-
cle is registered; 3) Proof of meeting the minimum requirements for automobile insurance laws or regu-
AFI31-204_45SWSUP1_I 1 AUGUST 2003                                                                            19


lations of the state or host nation. Within the United States, the installation commander may set
reasonable liability insurance requirements for registration and operation of POVs within the confines of
the installation; and 4) Evidence of satisfactory completion of emission, safety, mechanical, or other test
or evaluation required by local, state, or other jurisdiction in which the vehicle is licensed or located.
Installation commanders may require periodic safety inspections for all vehicles operated routinely on
their installation if a like inspection is not required by a nonmilitary jurisdiction. In such cases, the instal-
lation commander must ensure reasonable and accessible inspection facilities are available and that
inspections follow National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) standards. Note: The
owner or authorized operator is responsible for reasonable fees and expenses associated with vehicle
inspections. Failure to comply with safety inspection standards will result in termination or denial of use
of installation roadways.
    3.2.1. Vehicle registration record keeping. Registering officials must check the eligibility to register
    and ownership (or legitimate custody) of a vehicle. Unit distribution points (i.e., unit orderly rooms)
    may perform registration functions under the supervision of the installation pass and registration sec-
    tion. In this case, these distribution points receive registration decals in bulk from the pass and regis-
    tration section. After issuing decals, provide the pass and registration section the completed AF Form
    533 or the necessary information for entering registration data into the automated system. Use one of
    the following methods to keep records:
        3.2.1.1. Manually kept records. Each registrant fills out an AF Form 533 upon initial Air Force
        vehicle registration and upon arrival at a new installation after permanent change of station. The
        registrant’s signature on the AF Form 533 certifies compliance with registration requirements. To
        minimize inconvenience to the registrant, you can preprint the name of the installation and mini-
        mum insurance limits in the appropriate blocks on the front. Determine filing methods locally.
        3.2.1.2. Automated records. Use the security police automated system (SPAS) computerized
        vehicle registration program. The registrant must read and understand the registration require-
        ments before issuing a decal.

3.3. Appointing Registration Officials . The chief of security police (CSP) develops local procedures
governing base registration officials. Generally, security police personnel working in the pass and regis-
tration section are assigned duties as registration officials. When authorized by the installation com-
mander, unit orderly room personnel may also act as registration officials for their unit personnel when
unit-level vehicle registration has been authorized. Local registration official procedures must cover the
following:
    3.3.1. Qualifications (i.e., grade, duty position, and skill level).
    3.3.2. Duty training requirements and general position responsibilities which must include record
    keeping procedures, inventory, and security procedures for controlled DD forms.
    3.3.3. Appointment procedures for those authorized to perform as registration officials.

3.4. Specifications for DD Form 2220.
    3.4.1. Use the DD Form 2220 to register vehicles on Air Force installations. Remove the form from
    POVs when registration expires or registration privileges terminate.
    3.4.1. (45SW) The DD Form 2220 is not honored on CCAFS or its Florida Annexes. POV operators
    must comply with the registration requirements in AFI31-204, paragraph 3.2.
20                                                          AFI31-204_45SWSUP1_I 1 AUGUST 2003


        3.4.1.1. (Added-45SW) When re-registering POVs, individuals must provide the number from the
        previously issued DD Form 2220, DoD Registered Vehicle. A new decal will be issued if the old
        decal is mutilated, overly worn, faded or otherwise unreadable.
        3.4.1.2. (Added-45SW) Remove decals from the vehicle and return it to the Visitor’s Control
        Center when registration is terminated or the vehicle is sold or otherwise transference of registra-
        tion occurs.
        3.4.1.3. (Added-45SW) An unauthorized person will not use a registered POV to gain entry to
        PAFB. (Vehicles registered on the installation must not be used by unauthorized personnel to enter
        PAFB. When loaning registered vehicles, the owner must warn personnel of the prohibition.)
     3.4.2. Use the installation tag (4” X 1/2”) to identify the Air Force installation where the vehicle is
     registered. Position this decal directly under the DD Form 2220. The tags are color coded according
     to the category of the registrant and are issued as follows:
        3.4.2.1. Officer--blue background with white letters.
        3.4.2.2. Noncommissioned officer--gold background with black letters.
        3.4.2.3. Airman--red background with white letters.
        3.4.2.4. Civilian--green background with white letters.
        3.4.2.5. Contractor--white background with black letters.
NOTE: The installation commander determines the color code used by dependents of deceased military
members.
     3.4.3. Use AF Form 2219, Registered Vehicle Expiration (2” X 3/4”), to maintain the validity of a
     vehicle’s registration. This tab has a suffix (series) corresponding to a particular year of expiration
     (i.e., 2219A, 2219B, etc.). Revalidate registration by issuing a different “series” at a minimum of
     every three years. Position this decal to the right of the DD Form 2220.
     3.4.4. Prominently affix registration decals to the windshield (centered at the top or at lower driver's
     side corner), on the front bumper (driver's side), or to a owner supplied plate securely fastened to the
     driver's side bumper, bumper mounting bracket, or license plate mounting bracket. State and local
     policy can affect the exact placement. On two-wheeled vehicles, place registration decals on a con-
     spicuous front-facing surface or plate affixed to a front-facing surface.
        3.4.4.1. (Added-45SW) Place decals in the top center or driver’s side bottom corner of POV
        windshield. (POVs with windshield wipers that travel over the top of the windshield place decal
        slightly off-center.) Place the decals on a visible front portion of motorcycles. The decal must be
        permanently attached to the vehicle (not on a separate placard). POV operators with faded, expired
        or mutilated decals must obtain a new one. Retired Generals, Colonels, and Chief Master Ser-
        geants are entitled to a decal depicting their appropriate rank emblem. Family members of
        deceased Generals, Colonels, and Chief Master Sergeants are not authorized the rank emblem.
        3.4.4.2. (Added-45SW) If the sponsor owns the vehicle, then the family member will need a nota-
        rized letter from the sponsor giving authorization to operate and register the POV. When this
        occurs, the vehicle will be registered in both the family member and sponsor’s names.
AFI31-204_45SWSUP1_I 1 AUGUST 2003                                                                           21


       3.4.4.3. (45SW) (Delete) DOD, Non-Appropriated Fund (NAF) civilians, and contractors (and
       family members) must register their vehicles on base. Civilian and NAF personnel will receive a
       DD Form 2220.
   3.4.5. Use AF Form 787, Handicapped Person Vehicle Decal, to identify vehicles of handicapped
   persons. Position the decal to the right of the DD Form 2220. For short term and temporary disabili-
   ties, the installation commander may authorize issue of the AF Form 787 or a locally devised card or
   form. When authorized, temporary local cards or forms should contain an issue and expiration date.
   Issue and display in accordance with local procedure. Note: Honor local and state issued handicap
   decals, placards, signs, etc., on all Air Force installations. Don't require personnel issued local or state
   handicapped parking identification media to have an AF Form 787.

3.5. Termination or Denial of Registration . Vehicle registration will be denied under the following
conditions:
   3.5.1. The owner fails to comply with the registration requirements of paragraph 3.2.
   3.5.2. The owner sells or disposes of the registered POV, is released from active duty, is separated
   from the service, or terminates civilian employment with a military service or DoD agency.
   3.5.3. The owner is other than an active duty military or civilian employee and discontinues regular
   operation of the POV on the installation.
   3.5.4. The state, overseas command, host nation, or installation suspends or revokes the owner's driv-
   ing privilege. Affected persons can apply to reregister their POV after their suspension or revocation
   period expires. Other family members having installation driving privileges may transfer the base
   vehicle registration into their name. If so, change the AF Form 533 or SPAS data base to reflect the
   new registrant. Note: The installation commander determines the period of time a person has before
   they must surrender their DD Form 2220 or transfer the decal and base registration to another autho-
   rized driver.
   3.5.5. When a registrant is transferred. The installation commander may permit registration by the
   spouse or other dependents continuing to live near the installation. When this occurs, update the AF
   Form 533 or SPAS data base.
   3.5.6. When ownership of a vehicle is transferred. The new owner of a previously registered vehicle
   can transfer the registration provided the new owner is eligible for base vehicle registration. The new
   owner must follow the procedures in paragraph 3.2.
       3.5.6.1. (Added-45SW) If the vehicle is sold to personnel having no affiliation with PAFB or you
       are leaving the area under PCS orders, ensure the DD Form 2220 is removed and returned to
       45 SFS/SFOP; registration will be terminated.
       3.5.6.2. (Added-45SW) Individuals who plan to enter their vehicles into a consignment status at
       an off-base car dealership must terminate their vehicle base registration and remove the DD
       Form 2220 from their vehicle before placing the vehicle into consignment status. Although
       the car title remains in the existing owner’s name until sold, leaving the DD Form 2220 on the
       vehicle during consignment is a potential security risk.
   3.5.7. During a PCS transfer. If authorized by the installation commander, a registrant may keep the
   registration decal on their vehicle for re-registration at the gaining installation. In this case, the losing
   installation transfers the registration number to the gaining pass and registration section where only a

     new installation tab is issued upon the member's arrival at the new duty station. Note: This procedure
     is not allowed for CONUS to OCONUS POV shipments or consecutive OCONUS to OCONUS trans-
     fers unless the vehicle will be accompanied or driven by a registered owner. Unless the vehicle is
     accompanied or driven, surrender the DD Form 2220 as part of normal out processing.

3.6. Specified Consent to Impoundment. Personnel must consent to the installation vehicle impound-
ment policy if they wish to drive on the installation. POV registration forms or policy will contain or have
appended to them a certificate with the following statement:
“I am aware that AFI 31-204, Air Force Motor Vehicle Traffic Supervision, and the installation traffic
code provide for the removal and temporary impoundment of privately owned vehicles parked illegally
for unreasonable periods, interfering with military operations, creating a safety hazard, disabled by inci-
dent, left unattended in a restricted or controlled area, or abandoned. I agree to reimburse any agency or
contractor for the cost of towing, storing, and disposing of my motor vehicle if it is lawfully removed and
impounded."
     3.6.1. (Added-45SW) Storage trailers entering CCAFS must have written permission from the Det 1,
     45 MSG/CC and a valid license plate permanently affixed in plain view. Storage trailers entering
     PAFB only require a valid license plate permanently affixed in plain view. Office modular trailers
     must display a facility identification number issued by Facilities Planning (45 CES/CERR). Immedi-
     ately anchor trailers to the job site as required by Florida Division of Motor Vehicles.

                                TRAFFIC PLANNING AND CODES

4.1. Traffic Planning
   4.1.1. Safe and efficient movement of traffic on an installation requires traffic supervision. A strong
   traffic supervision program includes sound traffic circulation planning, supervision, and control of
   motor vehicle traffic. Proactive publication and enforcement of traffic laws and regulations together
   with timely and professional investigation of motor vehicle accidents are also important. Finally,
   every successful program must include meaningful interaction, education, and communication with
   the general public.
   4.1.2. Installation commanders develop traffic circulation plans that provide for the safest and most
   efficient use of primary and secondary roads. A major focus of installation traffic planning is circula-
   tion control. The base traffic engineer, CSP, safety officer, and other concerned staff agencies develop
   the traffic circulation plan. Consult with highway engineering representatives from adjacent civilian
   communities to ensure the installation plan is compatible with plans developed by the state and sur-
   rounding local communities. As a minimum, your base traffic plan should consider the following:
      4.1.2.1. Normal and peak load routing based on traffic control studies.
      4.1.2.2. Effective control of traffic, using planned traffic flow patterns which include measures
      for special events and adverse road conditions.
      4.1.2.3. Point control at congested locations by law enforcement personnel or designated traffic
      directors or wardens, including trained school-crossing guards.
      4.1.2.4. Use of traffic control signs and devices.
      4.1.2.5. Efficient use of available parking facilities.
      4.1.2.6. Efficient use of mass transportation.
      4.1.2.7. Every installation commander should appoint a primary and alternate base traffic engi-
      neer. The engineer directs, develops, and staffs the base traffic circulation plan. This is normally
      a civil engineering responsibility and those considered for the position should have an infrastruc-
      ture planning and engineering background.
   4.1.3. Traffic control studies provide factual data on existing roads, traffic density and flow patterns,
   and points of congestion. The CSP and traffic engineer usually conduct coordinated traffic control
   studies to obtain the data. Accurate data helps determine major and minor routes, locations for traffic
   control devices, and special conditions requiring engineering or enforcement services.
   4.1.4. The Military Traffic Management Command Transportation Engineering Agency (MTMC-
   TEA) will help installation commanders solve complex highway traffic engineering problems. MTM-
   CTEA traffic engineering team services include:
      4.1.4.1. Traffic studies of lifted areas and other special situations.
      4.1.4.2. Complete studies of traffic operations of entire installations.
      4.1.4.3. Assistance in complying with established traffic engineering standards.

     4.1.5. Installation commanders submit requests for MTMCTEA assistance in accordance with AFR
     75-88, Highways for National Defense.

4.2. Installation Traffic Codes.
     4.2.1. Installation commanders must establish a traffic code for operation of motor vehicles on the
     installation. Commanders in overseas areas establish a traffic code to the extent military authority is
     empowered to regulate traffic under applicable treaties or agreements. Installation traffic codes must
     contain the base rules of the road and will, to the degree possible, conform to the code of the state or
     host nation in which the installation is located. The CSP is responsible for developing the traffic code
     and for ensuring it meets all local and legal requirements, this AFI, and the standards published in the
     following:
        4.2.1.1. The National Highway Safety Program Standards, as published in 23, CFR 1230.
        4.2.1.2. Applicable portions of the Uniform Vehicle Code and Model Traffic Ordinance published
        by the National Committee on Uniform Traffic Laws and Ordinances, which is contained in 23,
        CFR 1204.
        4.2.1.3. DoDI 6055.4, DoD Traffic Safety Program.
     4.2.2. The installation traffic code must contain policy and procedures for the towing, searching,
     impounding, and inventorying of vehicles. Publish these provisions and ensure they contain the fol-
     lowing:
        4.2.2.1. Violations and conditions to tow or impound a vehicle.
        4.2.2.2. Procedures to notify the vehicle owner.
        4.2.2.3. Procedures for towing, storing, and protecting impounded vehicles.
        4.2.2.4. Procedures for disposing of vehicles after lawful impoundment.
     4.2.3. Where applicable, installation traffic codes must supplement the various basic provisions con-
     tained in the subparagraphs below:
        4.2.3.1. Motorcycles and mopeds. Operators must comply with special requirements when driv-
        ing motorcycles, mopeds, or other open two-, three-, and four-wheel vehicles powered by a motor-
        cycle-type engine. See paragraph 4.2.6. for information concerning off-road vehicle use.
        Installations should adopt local, state, or host nation guidance concerning the legal definition,
        operation, use, and control of mopeds, motorized bicycles, and other such devices on installation
        roadways. Such guidelines will be modified or restricted as necessary to ensure personal safety or
        the safe and orderly flow of installation traffic. Refer to AFI 91-207 for helmet, eye, and clothing
        safety requirements.
        4.2.3.1. (45SW) Only operators ride mopeds - no passengers.
            4.2.3.1.1. (Added-45SW) A rearview mirror is attached to each side of the handlebars on Two
            Wheeled Vehicles (TWV).
            4.2.3.1.2. (Added-45SW) Operator and any passenger must wear protective equipment as fol-
            lows:
                4.2.3.1.2.1. (Added-45SW) Protective helmet. According to AFI91-207, paragraph 14,
                helmets must be properly worn, fastened and at a minimum meet Department of Transpor-
AFI31-204_45SWSUP1_I 1 AUGUST 2003                                                                  25


            tation (DoT) standards. Helmets approved by either the SNELL Memorial Foundation or
            American National Standards Institute meet standards set forth by the DoT. Operator and
            any passenger must wear impact resistant goggles or a full-face shield on their helmet.
            4.2.3.1.2.2. (Added-45SW) Impact or shatter resistant goggles or a full-face shield prop-
            erly attached to the helmet. A windshield or eye glasses alone are not proper eye protec-
            tion.
            4.2.3.1.2.3. (Added-45SW) Brightly colored or contrasting vest or jacket as an outer upper
            garment during the day and reflective during the night. Outer upper garment will be clearly
            visible and not covered (bright colors include colors such as: hot pink, lemon-lime, inter-
            national orange, bright red, or any fluorescent color etc.).
            4.2.3.1.2.4. (Added-45SW) Long sleeved shirts or jackets, full fingered motorcycle gloves
            or mittens, and long trousers.

            strongly encouraged.
            4.2.3.1.2.6. (Added-45SW) Individuals will not ride TWVs while carrying any package,
            bundle, or other article that prevents them from keeping both hands on the handlebars.
            4.2.3.1.2.7. (Added-45SW) Operation of TWVs and all other vehicles off roadways is pro-
            hibited unless for official reasons.
            4.2.3.1.2.8. (Added-45SW) TWV headlights must be on at all times, according to
            AFI91-207, The U.S. Air Force Traffic Safety Program.
     4.2.3.2. Restraint systems.
        4.2.3.2.1. Operators and passengers of all vehicles operated on Air Force installations must
        wear restraint systems. In addition, operators and passengers of GOVs must wear restraint
        systems when driving or riding off the installation as well.
        4.2.3.2.1. (45SW) Persons driving or riding in a motor vehicle on the installation will use
        installed occupant protective devices (restraints, air bags, child safety seats, etc.). Vehicle
        operators will be ticketed and assessed four points if anyone in the vehicle is observed not
        wearing occupant protective devices per AFI31-204, Table 5.2.
        4.2.3.2.2. All Air Force active duty and reserve component members on active duty must
        wear restraint systems while driving or riding in a POV whether on or off the installation.
        4.2.3.2.2. (45SW) All persons driving or riding in government vehicles on or off the installa-
        tion must use protective devices. EXCEPTION: AFOSI on-duty agents and Security Forces
        (who are acting as augmentees for AFOSI agents) not driving, but performing protective ser-
        vices operations will use seat belts at their discretion.
        4.2.3.2.3. US Department of Transportation requires approved infant/child restraint devices in
        POVs for children 4 years old or under and not exceeding 50 pounds in weight.
        4.2.3.2.3. (45SW) Infant and child restraint devices (car seats) are required for children five
        years of age or younger. Children must be one year of age and weigh 20 pounds or more before
        they ride in a forward facing position (FS 316.613(1)(a)).
26                                                           AFI31-204_45SWSUP1_I 1 AUGUST 2003


            4.2.3.2.4. Cars manufactured after model year 1966 require a manufacturer-approved restraint
            system meeting federal traffic safety standards.
            4.2.3.2.4. (45SW) Vehicles of model years 1965 and newer must have installed occupant pro-
            tective devices within the passenger compartment of the vehicle. Vehicles manufactured
            before 1966 must have occupant restraints installed if required by the state of Florida.
            4.2.3.2.5. Operators using vehicles equipped with air bags must still wear the manufacturer's
            primary restraint system (seat belts).
        4.2.3.3. Headphones and earphones. The wearing of headphones and earphones is prohibited
        while driving a motor vehicle on base. This does not negate wearing of hearing protection when
        conditions and good judgment dictate its use such as when driving in noise hazard areas. This
        restriction does not apply to intercom systems worn by motorcycle operators and their passengers.
        4.2.3.3. (45SW) Wearing of portable headphones, use of handheld cellular phones, and other sim-
        ilar devices while operating a motor vehicle is prohibited. Vehicle operators will be ticketed and
        assessed three points for the use of these items while driving. NOTE: Use of a single earphone for
        cellular telephone use is authorized.
     4.2.4. Take only administrative actions (reprimand, assessment of points, loss of installation driving
     privileges, etc.) for off-installation violations of the installation traffic code.
     4.2.5. At bases with concurrent or exclusive federal jurisdiction, make violations of state traffic codes
     applicable to base driving records when those violations are included in that state’s criminal offense
     code. This provision is covered under the authority of Title 18 United States Code 13 (USC).
        4.2.5.1. DoDD 5525.4, Enforcement of State Traffic Laws on DoD Installations, adopts the vehic-
        ular and pedestrian traffic laws of states where traffic law violations are not considered criminal
        offenses and cannot be assimilated under 18 USC. It makes these laws applicable to military
        installations having concurrent or exclusive federal jurisdiction. It also delegates authority to
        installation commanders to establish additional vehicular and pedestrian traffic rules and regula-
        tions for their installations. Those found guilty of violating traffic laws made applicable on instal-
        lations under provisions of DoDD 5525.4 are subject to a fine of not more than $50 or
        imprisonment for not more than 30 days or both for each violation. In those states where you can-
        not assimilate traffic laws, post an extracted copy of this paragraph and a copy of DoDD 5525.4 in
        a prominent place accessible to persons assigned, living, or working on the installation.
            4.2.5.1.1. Take only administrative actions in states where you cannot assimilate violations of
            traffic laws under either Title 18 USC 13 or DoDD 5525.4. Generally, this applies to installa-
            tions under part or full proprietary jurisdiction.
     4.2.6. Off-road vehicles usage: The installation commander or his or her designee determines if,
     when, and where off-road vehicles may be operated on base. In many areas, the operation of off-road
     vehicles is unregulated while other jurisdictions have strict requirements concerning age, safety train-
     ing, and vehicle equipment. Generally, some "on-street" safety practices such as reflective vests,
     gloves, headlight on, and goggles may not apply when operating off road in a recreational capacity.
     However, ensure full compliance with local, state, or host nation requirements. When necessary,
     develop additional procedures and guidance locally and publish in the installation traffic safety plan or
     supplement to this instruction. Ensure environmental considerations are reviewed prior to designating
     any off-road vehicle use area.
AFI31-204_45SWSUP1_I 1 AUGUST 2003                                                                       27


   4.2.6. (45SW) All Terrain Vehicles (ATV): An ATV is a motorized vehicle with three or more wheels,
   low tire pressure, a wheel base of 50 inches or less, an overall weight of 600 pounds or less, and a seat
   to be straddled by the operator. NOTE: POVs may not be used as off road vehicles.
      4.2.6.1. (Added-45SW) ATV operators will wear protective equipment (listed in paragraphs
      4.2.3.1.2. (Added) through 4.2.3.1.2.5. (Added)) and complete an approved ATV Safety Course.

4.3. Traffic Law Enforcement Principles.
   4.3.1. Traffic law enforcement should motivate drivers to operate vehicles safely within traffic laws
   and regulations and maintain an effective and efficient flow of traffic. Effective enforcement should
   emphasize selective enforcement and voluntary compliance by drivers. You can reach these goals by
   developing effective programs in the following areas.
      4.3.1.1. Publishing a realistic traffic code well known by all personnel.
      4.3.1.2. Adopting standard signs, markings, and signals in accordance with National Highway
      Safety Program Standards (NHSPS) and the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for
      Streets and Highways.
      4.3.1.3. Ensuring enforcement personnel establish courteous, personal contact with drivers, and
      act promptly when driving behavior is improper or when observing a defective vehicle in opera-
      tion.
      4.3.1.4. Maintain an aggressive program to detect and apprehend those who drive with suspended
      or revoked privileges.
      4.3.1.5. Use sound discretion and judgment in deciding when to apprehend, issue a citation, or
      warn the offender.
   4.3.2. Enforcement activities against intoxicated driving will include:
      4.3.2.1. Detecting, apprehending, and testing persons suspected of driving under the influence of
      alcohol or drugs.
      4.3.2.2. Training law enforcement personnel in special enforcement standards, detection tech-
      niques, and equipment standards unique to your location and jurisdiction.
      4.3.2.3. Enforcing blood-alcohol concentration standards (see paragraph 4.11.).
      4.3.2.4. Denying installation driving privileges to those whose use of alcohol or drugs prevents
      their safe operation of a motor vehicle.

4.4. Speed-measuring Devices. Use speed-measuring devices in traffic control studies and enforce-
ment programs. Post signs to indicate the use of speed-measuring devices.
4.4. (45SW) Speed-measuring Devices. Laser and radar speed measuring devices are routinely used by
Security Forces Personnel at CCAFS/PAFB. Radar and laser detection devices are prohibited. Devices
used to transmit simulated erroneous speeds (jammers) are also prohibited.
   4.4.1. Equipment purchases. Installations located in states having a formal civilian police training
   and certification program for speed measurement should consider purchasing the same brand and
   model of equipment used by their civilian counterparts. Where possible, attend the same or similar
   certification courses used by local authorities.
28                                                          AFI31-204_45SWSUP1_I 1 AUGUST 2003


     4.4.2. Training and certification standards.
        4.4.2.1. The CSP should strive to ensure operators of speed-measuring devices meet training and
        certification requirements prescribed by the state or jurisdiction where the installation is located.
        Obtain specific information on course dates, costs, and prerequisites for attending by contacting
        the state agency responsible for police traffic radar training. Notwithstanding the above informa-
        tion, the CSP may establish other local training and certification programs for operators of
        speed-measuring devices. If exercising this option, you must ensure your qualification and train-
        ing standards are admissible as evidence and considered reliable by both military and civil author-
        ities. This requirement applies to courts-martial, nonjudicial proceedings, and civilian courts used
        to prosecute civilian offenders. Coordination between the military staff judge advocate and attor-
        ney general (or equivalent) is necessary.
            4.4.2.1.1. (Added-45SW) The RADAR Training program includes use of RADAR and laser
            speed measuring devices. RADAR training is conducted by the Brevard County Sheriff Office
            (BCSO) on a quarterly basis. Classes are held at the Brevard Community College Campus.
        4.4.2.2. Develop local training programs or attend a civilian institution or manufacturer's training
        program if security police are unable to attend local or state-sponsored radar certification courses.
        4.4.2.3. The objective of civilian or manufacturer-sponsored courses is to improve the effective-
        ness of speed enforcement through the proper and efficient use of speed-measurement radar. On
        successful completion, the course graduate must know how to:
            4.4.2.3.1. Describe the association between excessive speed and accidents, deaths, and inju-
            ries, and describe the traffic safety benefits of effective speed control.
            4.4.2.3.2. Describe the basic principles of radar speed measurement.
            4.4.2.3.3. Identify and describe Air Force speed measurement and speed enforcement policy
            and procedure.
            4.4.2.3.4. Identify the specific radar instrument used and describe the instrument’s major
            components and functions.
            4.4.2.3.5. Demonstrate basic skills in calibrating and operating the specific radar instru-

   4.5.2. Conduct investigations of off-installation accidents involving military personnel according to
   local policy developed by the CSP and local police leaders.
NOTE: Generally, a detailed accident investigation includes, but is not limited to, an accident report
form, field sketch, scale diagram, and accident narrative.
   4.5.3. (Added-45SW) Complete AF Form 1315 when accidents involve disabling damage or injuries.
   An AF Form 1315 must be accomplished if the facts acquired from investigation indicate lack of cor-
   relation between damage and accident chain of events or fraudulent insurance claim anticipated, etc.
   Forward completed AF Form 1315 to 45 SW/SEG when accident involves government vehicles,
   property, or equipment.
       4.5.3.1. (Added-45SW) A vehicle that cannot be driven under its own power, in its customary
       manner, without further damage or hazard to itself or to other traffic elements on the roadway,

     4.5.9. (Added-45SW) Blotters at PAFB and CCAFS will be reviewed daily by the appropriate secu-
     rity office. Any information addressing accidental damage to government vehicles, property, equip-
     ment or damage to private property that resulted from an Air Force operation will be forwarded to 45
     SW/SEG. Transmission may be by phone or E-mail.

4.6. Traffic Accident Investigation Reports.
     4.6.1. Anyone involved in an on-base vehicle accident must immediately report the incident to the
     security police. Report off-base accidents to the security police if they involve injuries to military per-
     sonnel or damage to military property. The installation commander determines what agencies to notify
     and for what type of accidents to notify them. The CSP must develop a local notification matrix or
     other procedures that will ensure notification of appropriate base and civilian agencies. Develop and
     publish these notification procedures locally.
     4.6.2. The security police will act as the focal point for gathering off-base accident information.
     Record the information in the security police desk blotter. When possible, obtain copies of major
     accident reports prepared by investigating civilian police agencies.
     4.6.3. Security police respond to all on-base major vehicle accidents (unless local conditions or poli-
     cies prohibit) to accomplish the following:
        4.6.3.1. Render first aid and arrange for medical assistance.
        4.6.3.2. Protect personal property.
        4.6.3.3. Normalize traffic.
        4.6.3.4. Identify witnesses and personnel involved.
        4.6.3.5. Conduct a formal investigation.
        4.6.3.6. The CSP determines (with installation commander approval) when and/or if minor vehi-
        cle accidents require investigation or a police response. He or she may delegate this authority to
        on-duty security police supervisory personnel. Develop policy in this area locally.
     4.6.4. Report minor accidents not involving a security police response to the security police within 72
     hours. Record accident information in the security police blotter. This information should include the
     accident type, time and date, location, name(s) of vehicle operator(s), unit (or address when civilian
     not affiliated with military), vehicle description, and license number(s). You should also include a
     brief summary of any damage and circumstances behind or causing the accident. A minor accident is
     any accident in which there are no fatalities/injuries or vehicle/property damage above the amount
     established by the installation commander. Consequently, a major accident is any accident involving
     a fatality, injury, or property damage above the amount established by the installation commander.
     The installation commander may set differing amounts for government versus private vehicle and
     property damage. The investigation of major accidents involve specialized accident investigative
     techniques to draw conclusions and opinions about how and why the accident occurred.
        4.6.4.1. Injury is defined as any one of the following caused or aggravated by a motor vehicle
        accident:
            4.6.4.1.1. Any condition requiring medical attention
            4.6.4.1.2. Complaint or report of pain or injury regardless if medical attention is sought
AFI31-204_45SWSUP1_I 1 AUGUST 2003                                                                      31


          4.6.4.1.3. Any visible injury. This includes bruises, contusions, cuts, scrapes, compression, or
          any other visible damage to the body.

4.7. Use of Traffic Accident Investigation Report Data.
   4.7.1. Analyze data derived from traffic accident investigations to determine accident causes. When
   frequent accidents occur in one area, analyze location conditions, type of accidents, and other factors
   in an attempt to isolate causes. With the exception of privacy act information, make accident data and
   trend analysis available to agencies requesting the data for reporting and analytical purposes. With the
   exception of requests filed under the Freedom of Information Act, the CSP determines the agencies
   cleared to receive accident and incident data.
   4.7.2. Law enforcement personnel and others who prepare traffic accident investigation reports will
   indicate if a seat restraint was used at the time of the accident, and where applicable, if air bags
   deployed.

4.8. Parking.
4.8. (45SW) Parking. Parking (reference Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices and Military Traf-
fic Management Command Traffic Engineering Agency).
   4.8.1. Illegal parking contributes to congestion and slows traffic flow on the installation. Strong
   enforcement of parking rules results in better use of available parking while reducing traffic accidents
   and hazards. Combine enforcement with community education and awareness initiatives in areas
   where illegal parking is a problem. When education and awareness fail, installation commanders may
   authorize more serious enforcement measures such as towing and "booting" of vehicles. Do not use
   towing and booting if less severe means of enforcement such as warnings, ticketing, reprimands, revo-
   cations, etc., prove effective. When using towing and booting, follow the guidelines below:
       4.8.1.1. Publish operating instructions to control discretion of enforcers and limit towing or boot-
       ing to specific offenses.
       4.8.1.2. Focus on specific reasons for towing or booting. Booting is effective for immobilizing
       unsafe vehicles, or vehicles not inspected or registered. Use booting in high offense areas or to
       compel the presence of repeat offenders. Towing is more effective for moving vehicles that pose
       safety hazards. Some examples include double parking, and blocking fire hydrants and fire lanes.
       4.8.1.3. Notify drivers that certain violations or multiple violations may result in towing or boot-
       ing. Also, provide drivers a prompt opportunity to obtain release of their property.
       4.8.1.4. Warn drivers when a boot is attached to their vehicle and instruct them on how to have the
       boot removed without damaging the vehicle.
   4.8.2. Reserved Parking. When not addressed by MAJCOMs, installation commanders determine
   reserved parking policy for their installations. Number of available spaces, facility design and layout,
   traffic flow, and number of vehicles using facilities will help determine the number and location of
   reserved parking spaces. Make policy and procedures governing reserved parking a part of the instal-
   lation supplement to this instruction, separate traffic control instruction, or base parking plan. The
   publication must address approval, issue, control, and review of reserved parking and should give spe-
   cial consideration to bicycle, motorcycle, visitor, and car pool parking. Handicap parking is regulated
   under the uniform federal accessibility standards and applies to all Air Force installations.
32                                                           AFI31-204_45SWSUP1_I 1 AUGUST 2003


     4.8.3. You can use distinctive emblems, decals, stickers, etc., to control parking space assignments
     and to indicate authorized use of the parking slot. If this identification media is placed on a vehicle
     bumper, separate it from the vehicle registration identification. MAJCOMs (or installation command-
     ers if not addressed by the MAJCOM) may develop policy concerning the issue and control of the
     identification media discussed above.
     4.8.4. You can use parking wardens (unit personnel) to monitor and cite parking violators, especially
     within off-street parking facilities.
     4.8.5. (Added-45SW) Prohibited Parking:
        4.8.5.1. (Added-45SW) In yellow hashed areas or where posted.
        4.8.5.2. (Added-45SW) On grassed or seeded areas.
        4.8.5.3. (Added-45SW) In such a manner as to impede traffic flow or the movement of legally

        4.8.5.11. (Added-45SW) Motorcycle parking is permitted at the end of parking lanes in yel-
        low-hashed areas.
        4.8.5.12. (Added-45SW) Leaving Children Unattended in Motor Vehicles: Children under 6
        years-of-age may not be left unsupervised or unattended in a vehicle for any reason. Security
        Forces may use whatever means necessary to safeguard a child found unattended to include forc-
        ibly entering a vehicle. If the child is removed due to an emergency (heat stroke, overheating,
        etc.), written notification is left on the vehicle if the guardian cannot be immediately located. Chil-
        dren between the ages of 6 and 12may not be left unattended for periods longer than 15 minutes,
        for any reason.
        4.8.5.13. (Added-45SW) Leaving Animals Unattended in Vehicles. Animals may not be left unat-
        tended in a vehicle for a period longer than 15 minutes for any reason. Security Forces will forc-
        ibly enter a vehicle to remove an animal.
        4.8.5.14. (Added-45SW) Cite all unauthorized personnel parked in accessible parking and on
        sand dunes using the DD Form 1805 according to AFI51-905, Use of Magistrate Judges for Trial
        of Misdemeanors Committed by Civilians.
        4.8.5.15. (45SW) (Added-45SW) Privately procured rental vehicles (i.e. U-Haul, Ryder, etc) and
        trailers are prohibited from parking on the installation. For exceptions see para 4.8.5.18. (Added)
AFI31-204_45SWSUP1_I 1 AUGUST 2003                                                                    33


     4.8.5.16. (Added-45SW) Three parking violations within 90 days or five parking violations
     within one year shall result in a three-month suspension of on-base driving privileges. Parking
     violations in excess of these numbers shall result in a 6-month suspension of on-base driving priv-
     ileges. CCAFS uses a traffic point system of 12 points in 12 months or 18 points within 18
     months.
     4.8.5.17. (Added-45SW) Privately owned trailers, personal watercraft, sailboats, recreational
     vehicles and campers are prohibited from parking on the installation except in the following areas:
     Fam Camp, Outdoor Recreation(boat dock--rental boats), Recreational vehicle lot(Services Com-
     pound), Auto Sales (For sale lot) and the Marina (Yacht Club). These vehicles must be properly
     registered with the 45th Services Squadron.
     4.8.5.18. (Added-45SW) To provide limited service for those personnel who are executing a “Do
     It Yourself” move or are staying in temporary lodging , an area has been designated at the parking
     lot south of North housing adjacent to Riverside TLF. This lot will allow base customers to store
     small trailers and privately rented moving trucks(Uhaul, Ryder, etc.) for a seven day period on a
     cost free, space available basis. Boats, recreational vehicles and POV’s are not permitted in this
     lot. Upon check-in at lodging or base housing, staff will inform guests where they may park their
     trailers and to contact 45 SFS for permit instructions. Personnel may receive a permit from Secu-
     rity Forces by visiting the law enforcement desk that will be valid for a 7 day period. Trailers and
     vehicles not moved after the allotted time will be cited and owners contacted for immediate
     removal. Trailers and equipment parked in the designated short-term lot not registered with Secu-
     rity Forces will be considered illegally parked. Impound action may be initiated if equipment is
     left abandoned for more than 72 hours, per AFI31-204.
  4.8.6. (Added-45SW) The 45th Space Wing Traffic Control Board/Sign Committee chaired by the 45
  MSG/CD approves all requests for reserved parking. Reserved parking requests will be submitted for
  all parking areas/spaces. Requests will be considered for the following: short-term customer (time
  limited between 15-minutes and 1-hour), delivery/service, visitors, key personnel, volunteers, organi-
  zations with unusual working requirements, and government-owned or leased vehicles.
     4.8.6.1. (Added-45SW) The board will address traffic safety problems and reserve parking issues
     at PAFB and CCAFS.
     4.8.6.2. (Added-45SW) Be made up, as a minimum, of the 45 CES Traffic Engineer and a repre-
     sentative from 45 SFS, 45 SW/SEG, and 45 CES/CEO.
     4.8.6.3. (Added-45SW) Meet with the sign committee off-line if issues cannot wait for a sched-
     uled meeting. Proposed actions from off-line meetings will be reviewed and approved by
     45 MSG/CD.
     4.8.6.4. (Added-45SW) Traffic safety problems will include issues that stem from personal obser-
     vations, results of 45 SFS or SE mishap investigations, Hazard Report Evaluations, and safety
     inspection findings.
     4.8.6.5. (Added-45SW) Assign reserved parking spaces according to the following priorities,
     based on the shortest walking distance to work/service areas: handicapped accessible, official
     vehicles used during duty hours, van and car pools, and single occupant vehicles.
     4.8.6.6. (Added-45SW) Mark spaces with appropriate signs according to the base striping and
     sign standards.

     4.8.6.7. (Added-45SW) If reserved parking spaces are not used according to their assignment or
     there is a change in the requirement for the space, the space is reviewed for removal. Report
     changes to the 45th Space Wing Traffic Control Board/Sign Group via the 45th Civil Engineer
     Squadron Customer Service Desk.
     4.8.6.8. (Added-45SW) Reserved parking spaces are valid 24-hours a day, 7-days a week. Vehi-
     cles parking in the reserved spaces without a permit or proper justification are subject to traffic
     enforcement. Organizations with reserved parking spaces are responsible for reporting violations
     to the 45th Security Forces Squadron.
     4.8.6.9. (Added-45SW) Allotted reserve parking spaces are determined according to several fac-
     tors.
     4.8.6.10. (Added-45SW) Organization commanders may request a limited number of parking
     spaces, normally not to exceed 10% of the total area (including accessible spaces) available for
     parking at the building/activity. Of this 10%, up to one-half may be assigned to key personnel. The
     remaining spaces should be reserved for government-owned or leased vehicle, functional specific
     vehicle, and accessible parking.
     4.8.6.11. (Added-45SW) Accessible spaces will be designated according to the most current
     Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG) or Uniform Federal Accessi-
     bility Standards (UFAS), whichever is more stringent. More accessible spaces than required will
     be considered on a case-by-case basis. Some areas may need more spaces due to entrance loca-
     tions or function. Accessible parking spaces will be located immediately adjacent to the nearest
     building entrance.
     4.8.6.12. (Added-45SW) Clearly mark visitor parking at convenient locations.
     4.8.6.13. (Added-45SW) Reserved parking in community areas will receive more strict scrutiny
     in order to better facilitate the customer. Community areas include the BX, Commissary,
     Mini-mall, Medical Clinic, Dental Clinic, Satellite Pharmacy, Fitness Center, and Base Library.
     They will be limited to only Wing Commander, Vice Wing Commander, accessible, volunteer by
     permit, motivational/ incentive-based, and short-term spaces. No more than 5% of the parking in
     these areas may be reserved.
     4.8.6.14. (Added-45SW) Certain community areas on base have been identified as multi-use
     facilities. These facilities are classified “multi-use” because of their unique nature; they can serve
     as either their primary function or as a meeting place for official business (commander’s call,
     retirement ceremony, formal functions, etc.). The locations are listed, along with the number of
     reserved and accessible spaces allotted for each. Parking is typically reserved at these facilities for
     positions such as 45 SW/CC, 45 SW/CV, 45 SW/CCC, Flag officers, colonels, etc.

       4.8.6.15. (Added-45SW) Reserved parking for key personnel is limited to, but not necessarily
       include, all of the following: Installation commander, senior commanders with the grade of O-6 or
       above, squadron commanders, first sergeants, civilians with the grade of GM-15 or above, deputy
       commanders/directors and persons specifically designated by the installation commander.
       4.8.6.16. (Added-45SW) Organizations requesting reserved parking spaces must submit their
       request in writing to the 45th Civil Engineer Squadron Customer Service Desk. The request will
       be on an AF Form 332, signed by the Unit Commander. The AF Form 332 must contain the name,
       grade, office symbol, and duty phone of the requesting official and have an exact description of
       the parking space location. Upon approval, CE will install the appropriate reserved/restricted
       parking signs, bumper blocks, pavement striping, and/or curb markings.

4.9. Traffic Violation Reports.
   4.9.1. Commanders should deal with most traffic violations occurring on Air Force installations
   within Air Force channels.
   4.9.2. You can refer traffic violations occurring on Air Force installations (within the United States or
   its territories) to the proper US Magistrate. Do not refer violations in the following circumstances:
   4.9.2. (45SW) Use the DD Form 1805, Violation Notice, to refer violators to the U.S. Magistrate sys-
   tem. Violations/Personnel not chargeable through the U.S. Magistrate are referred to the violator’s
   supervisor using the DD Form 1408, Armed Forces Traffic Ticket (PAFB) or the KSC/CCAFS
   Citation (CCAFS).
       4.9.2.1. The operator is driving a government vehicle at the time of the violation.
       4.9.2.2. A US Federal Magistrate is either not available or lacks jurisdiction to hear the matter
       because the violation occurred in an area where the federal government has only proprietary legis-
       lative jurisdiction.
       4.9.2.3. Mission requirements make referral of offenders impractical.
       4.9.2.4. A US Magistrate is available, but the accused refuses to consent to the jurisdiction of the
       court and the US attorney refuses to process the case before a US district court.

     4.9.3. Issue traffic violators on military installations a DD Form 1408, Armed Forces Traffic Ticket,
     or a DD Form 1805, United States District Court Violation Notice. The CSP determines who is autho-
     rized to issue those forms and what training they must complete before issuing either form. The DD
     Form 1408 is issued to the following personnel: active duty personnel, Cadets/Midshipmen of the Mil-
     itary Academies to include the Coast Guard Academy, reservists on orders or performing inactive
     duty training including commuting to and from training, and guardsman in federal service under Title
     10 of the United States Code. Title 10 status is reflected on the guardsman’ s orders. Issue civilians the
     DD Form 1805, or the DD Form 1408 when a US Magistrate system is not available.”
        4.9.3.1. (Added-45SW) Make DD Form 1408, Armed Forces Traffic Ticket, appeals to 45
        MSG/CC and KSC/CCAFS Citation appeals to Det 1, MSG/CC. For PAFB personnel, appeals
        must be in writing and submitted within five working days of the citation date through the individ-
        ual’s unit first sergeant and commander to 45 SFS/SFAR and 45 SFS/CC. Upon review, appeals
        will be sent to 45 MSG/CC for final disposition. For KSC/CCAFS personnel, appeals must be in
        writing and submitted within five working days of the citation date through the individual’s unit
        first sergeant and commander to the Det 1, 45 MSG/CC for final disposition. To appeal the issu-
        ance of a DD Form 1805, United States District Court Violation Notice, the cited party has the
        right to appear before a U.S. Magistrate Judge at the U.S. District Court in Orlando, FL. Contact
        procedures are on the DD Form 1805. Upon final adjudication by the U.S. Magistrate Judge, the
        applicable points will be assessed against the individual’s base driving record. In the event the
        court dismisses the citation, no points will be assessed. If the individual fails to pay or appear in
        court on the scheduled date, a federal warrant may be issued for the individual’s arrest. If a warrant
        is issued, the individuals base driving privileges will be automatically revoked and temporarily
        denied access to PAFB and CCAFS until resolution of the warrant.
     4.9.4. Installation commanders establish procedures for disposing of traffic violation cases through
     administrative or judicial action consistent with the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) and
     federal law. Additionally, forward a copy of all violation reports on military personnel and DoD civil-
     ian employees apprehended for intoxicated driving to the Substance Abuse Office, Drug and Alcohol
     Control.
     4.9.5. Unless restricted under the provisions of para 4.9.2., use the DD Form 1805 to refer civilian
     violators of state and federal traffic laws to the appropriate US magistrate. Notify the commander,
     first sergeant, or supervisor when any military personnel or DoD civilian employees is cited with the
     DD Form 1805. If requested, locally reproduce a copy of the DD Form 1805 and make it available to
     the commander, first sergeant, or supervisor.
     4.9.5. (45SW) See Attachment 4 (Added) for CCAFS Jurisdiction.
        4.9.5.1. Preparation of the DD Form 1805. This prenumbered form is issued through standard
        publication channels and is only accountable once it is issued to an offender. Before issuing this
        form, stamp (type) in black ink the specific address of the clerk of the US District Court (Central
        Violations Bureau) to which the violator must address the communication, on the reverse of the
        violator’s copy (manila card stock) of the four-part form. Determine the entry for the amount of
        the fine, mandatory court appearance of the offender, and the date of appearance according to
        guidance furnished by the governing district court.
        4.9.5.2. Identify the assimilation of state traffic laws by a specific state code reference in the
        CODE SECTION block of the DD Form 1805 or in a complaint filed with the US magistrate.
AFI31-204_45SWSUP1_I 1 AUGUST 2003                                                                       37


       4.9.5.3. Use the statement of probable cause on the DD Form 1805 according to local staff judge
       advocate and US magistrate court policy. The statement of probable cause is required by the fed-
       eral misdemeanor rules to support the issuance of a summons or arrest warrant.
       4.9.5.4. For cases referred to US magistrate, normal distribution of DD Form 1805 is as follows:
          4.9.5.4.1. The CSP forwards copy 1 (white) and copy 2 (yellow) to the US District Court
          (Central Violation Bureau).
          4.9.5.4.2. Security police file copy 3 (pink).
          4.9.5.4.3. Provide copy 4 (envelope) to the violator.
NOTE: Ensure unit personnel are notified IAW para 4.9.5. above.
       4.9.5.5. When DD Form 1408 is used, distribute the form as follows:
          4.9.5.5.1. Provide the pink copy to the violator with normal reporting instructions and rebuttal
          instructions as determined by the installation commander.
          4.9.5.5.2. Forward the white copy to the service member’s commander, to the commander of
          the family member’s sponsor, or to the civilian’s supervisor or employer for administrative
          action within the unit/organization.
          4.9.5.5.3. Forward the yellow copy to the security police administration branch for processing
          and tracking until the white "action copy" is returned by the unit commander, section com-
          mander, or first sergeant. When the white copy is received, review it for action taken, annotate
          the information in SPAS or the AF Form 1313, Driver Record, with the moving or non-mov-
          ing violation and any points assessed. File the white and yellow copies with the driver record.
   4.9.6. (Added-45SW) Florida State Procedural Law Chapter 901.15(8) (FS 901.15(8)) provides that
   Security Forces may, with probable cause and by sworn affidavit (Attachment 3 (Added)), request
   the arrest of civilian violators on military property over which the State of Florida has jurisdiction
   (PAFB South Housing.) If the offense is a misdemeanor, it must occur in the presence of the Security
   Forces official or be a statutory exception to the misdemeanor rule. Security Forces officials may
   detain the offender until civilian law enforcement personnel arrive. Civilians who commit the follow-
   ing criminal offenses in proprietary jurisdiction are referred to a county court based upon a sworn affi-
   davit provided to a Brevard County Sheriff’s Deputy by the Security Forces official:
       4.9.6.1. (Added-45SW) Fleeing or attempting to elude a police officer (violation of FS 316.1935).
       4.9.6.2. (Added-45SW) Leaving the scene of an accident (violation of FS 316.027 and FS
       316.061).
       4.9.6.3. (Added-45SW) Driving or being in actual physical control of any vehicle while under the
       influence of alcohol; any chemical substance set forth in FS 877.11; or any substance controlled
       under Chapter 893 (violation of FS 316.193); or while driving with an unlawful blood alcohol
       level.
       4.9.6.4. (Added-45SW) Reckless driving (violation of FS 316.192).
       4.9.6.5. (Added-45SW) Making false accident reports (violation of FS 316.067).
       4.9.6.6. (Added-45SW) Willfully failing or refusing to comply with any lawful order or direction
       of any police officer or member of the fire department (violation of FS 316.072(3)).
38                                                          AFI31-204_45SWSUP1_I 1 AUGUST 2003


4.10. Standards and Procedures for Processing Intoxicated Drivers.
     4.10.1. As a minimum, the CSP must train installation law enforcement personnel to do the follow-
     ing:
        4.10.1.1. Recognize signs of alcohol and other drug impairment in persons operating motor vehi-
        cles.
        4.10.1.2. Prepare DD Form 1920, Alcohol Influence Report, or other form which adequately
        documents sobriety and sobriety testing of an individual.
        4.10.1.3. Perform standard field sobriety tests. The standardized Air Force field sobriety test con-
        sists of the one leg stand, the walk and turn, and the horizontal gaze nystagmus. Also consider any
        local, state, or host nation sobriety test requirements in addition to the above standard Air Force
        tests.
        4.10.1.4. Determine to a reasonable and practical degree when a person appears intoxicated, but
        is actually physically or mentally ill and requires prompt medical attention.
        4.10.1.5. Understand the operation of breath-testing devices.
     4.10.2. Each installation using breath-testing devices will ensure operators of these devices:
        4.10.2.1. Are chosen for integrity, maturity, and sound judgment.
        4.10.2.2. Meet installation, and where possible, state certification standards.
     4.10.3. Use only breath-testing devices listed on the approved NHTSA conforming products list pub-
     lished in the Federal Register. Ensure only trained personnel administer tests as specified in para-
     graph 4.13. and adhere to the procedures described in paragraphs 4.14. and 4.15. relating to voluntary
     and involuntary testing.
     4.10.3. (45SW) State of Florida certification is required for breath testing device operators.
     4.10.4. Installations located in states or overseas areas with no formal training program will develop
     their own training program following material and guidance from selected civilian institutions or
     manufacturers of the equipment. Coordinate local training programs with the installation staff judge
     advocate and state's attorney general (or local equivalent) to ensure your program meets local require-
     ments for legal admissibility. Conduct refresher training at the intervals determined by the CSP and
     staff judge advocate.

4.11. Blood Alcohol Concentration Standards.
     4.11.1. Uniformly apply administrative revocation of driving privileges and other enforcement mea-
     sures to offenders driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs. When a person is tested per para-
     graph 2.3., evaluate the results of the test as follows:
        4.11.1.1. If the percentage of alcohol in the person’s blood is less than 0.05 percent, presume the
        person is not under the influence of alcohol.
        4.11.1.2. If the percentage is 0.05 but less than 0.10, presume the person is impaired. Consider
        this standard with other competent evidence in determining whether the person was under the
        influence of alcohol. Suspend driving privileges according to para 2.5. Note: The 0.10 threshold
        delineating impaired from intoxicated can be lesser level when assimilating a more stringent local,
        state, or host nation standard.
AFI31-204_45SWSUP1_I 1 AUGUST 2003                                                                        39


      4.11.1.3. If the percentage is 0.10 (or lesser amount when assimilating local, state, or host nation
      standards) or more or if tests reflect the presence of illegal drugs, the person is considered to have
      been driving under the influence of intoxicants. Suspend driving privileges according to para
      2.5.1.3.
   4.11.2. Percentages in paragraph 4.11.1. are percent of weight by volume of alcohol in the blood
   based on grams of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood. Installation commanders will modify military
   standards to agree with a more stringent state, local authority, or host nation standard. Refer to Assess-
   ment #3, Table 5.1.

4.12. Chemical Testing Policies and Procedures.
   4.12.1. Results of chemical testing are valid under this instruction only under the following circum-
   stances:
      4.12.1.1. Testing of blood, breath, urine, or other bodily substances using generally accepted sci-
      entific and medical methods and standards.
      4.12.1.2. Qualified personnel administer breath tests.
      4.12.1.3. Use of a nonportable breath-testing device approved by the state or host nation.
   4.12.2. If the state or host nation has not established procedures for use of breath-testing devices, then
   apply the following procedures if you use portable breath-testing devices: 1) During the initial traffic
   stop as a field sobriety testing technique in lieu of or in conjunction with other field sobriety testing
   techniques as long as the state or host nation does not prohibit such use, and 2) According to the man-
   ufacturer's operating instructions.
      4.12.2.1. Use nonportable evidentiary breath-testing devices as follows:
          4.12.2.1.1. Observe the suspected person for at least 20 minutes before collecting the breath
          specimen. During this time, the person must not drink, eat, smoke, chew tobacco, or ingest
          any substance.
          4.12.2.1.2. Verify calibration and proper operation of the instrument according to manufac-
          turer's specifications and any specific local, state, or host nation requirements.
          4.12.2.1.3. Comply with operational procedures in the manufacturer’s current instruction
          manual. Perform the preventive maintenance as required by the owner's manual.
   4.12.3. Chemical tests of personnel involved in fatal accidents.
      4.12.3.1. Installation medical authorities will immediately notify and brief the CSP upon death of
      any person involved in a motor vehicle accident. Subject to military jurisdiction, medical author-
      ities will examine anyone killed in an on-base motor vehicle accident or mishap. Conduct tests for
      the presence and concentration of alcohol or other drugs in the blood, bodily fluids, or tissues as
      soon as possible and where practical within eight hours of death. Include the test results in the
      medical reports.
      4.12.3.2. As provided by law and medical conditions permitting, obtain a blood or breath sample
      from any surviving operator whose vehicle is involved in a fatal accident.

4.13. Detection, Apprehension, and Testing of Intoxicated Drivers.
40                                                           AFI31-204_45SWSUP1_I 1 AUGUST 2003


     4.13.1. Most of the time you will detect drunk drivers by observing unusual or abnormal driving
     behavior. Stop these drivers and determine the cause of their unusual driving behavior. If you reason-
     ably conclude that the individual in control of the vehicle is impaired, perform field sobriety tests.
     The DD Form 1920 is used in examining, interpreting, and recording results of such tests. Use the
     standard field sobriety tests outlined in para 4.10. Specific procedures for administering them can be
     found in AFH 31-227, Air Force Motor Vehicle and Traffic Control. Also see AFH 31-227 for proce-
     dures and guidance concerning the use of traffic mazes, DWI checkpoints, and other drunk driving
     reduction measures.

4.14. Voluntary Breath and Bodily Fluid Testing Based on Implied Consent.
     4.14.1. Implied consent policy is explained in paragraph 2.3.
     4.14.2. Administer tests only when the following conditions are met:
        4.14.2.1. The person was lawfully stopped while driving or while in physical control of a motor
        vehicle on the installation.
        4.14.2.2. Reasonable suspicion exists to believe the person was driving under the influence of
        alcohol or drugs.
        4.14.2.3. A request was made of the person to consent and he or she was advised that failure to
        voluntarily submit to or complete a chemical test of bodily fluids or breath may result in revoca-
        tion of on-base driving privileges.
     4.14.3. The installation commander prescribes the type of chemical tests used. Advise the driver that
     the installation commander may revoke driving privileges if they fail to voluntarily submit to or com-
     plete a requested chemical test and that they do not have the right to have an attorney present before
     deciding if they will or will not take the test. Testing will follow policies and procedures in paragraph
     4.12. Also advise the driver that you can use the results of chemical tests conducted under the implied
     consent provisions of this instruction as evidence in courts-martial, nonjudicial proceedings under
     Article 15 of the UCMJ, administrative action, or civil court proceeding.
     4.14.4. Special rules exist for persons who have hemophilia, other blood-clotting disorders, or any
     medical or surgical disorder under treatment with an anticoagulant. Such people may refuse a blood
     extraction without penalty, but you can offer a breath or urine test, or both. You must outline these
     procedures and the type of medical conditions that qualify for nonpunitive refusal in readily available
     medical guidelines located in emergency rooms or other reasonable areas where blood samples might
     be drawn from those suspected of drunk driving. Valid refusals must have the concurrence of a med-
     ical doctor.
     4.14.5. If a person suspected of intoxicated driving refuses to submit to a chemical test, do not admin-
     ister a test except as specified in paragraph 4.15.
     4.14.6. (Added-45SW) A person may be charged with driving under the influence of alcohol or a con-
     trolled substance without evidential blood, breath, or urine testing. The charge is based on other evi-
     dence of intoxication available at the time.

4.15. Involuntary Extraction of Bodily Fluids in Traffic Cases.
     4.15.1. These procedures pertain only to the investigation of individuals stopped, apprehended, or
     cited on a military installation for any offense related to driving a motor vehicle and for whom proba-
AFI31-204_45SWSUP1_I 1 AUGUST 2003                                                                         41


   ble cause exists to believe that such individual is intoxicated. Rule 312d, Military Rules of Evidence,
   and regulatory rules concerning requesting and granting authorizations for searches govern the extrac-
   tion of body fluids in furtherance of other kinds of investigations. Air Force policy on nonconsensual
   extraction of blood samples is further addressed in AFI 44-102, Patient Care and Management of
   Clinical Services.
   4.15.2. Involuntary bodily fluid extractions (blood or urine) require valid search and seizure authori-
   zations. A person subject to the UCMJ who does not consent to chemical testing, and who subse-
   quently refuses a lawful order to surrender to the test,. may nonetheless be forced to submit to an
   involuntary extraction of bodily fluids. As a general rule, forced extractions are considered only when
   an individual is involved in an accident in which there is a death, serious personal injury, or significant
   property damage. Probable cause must exist to believe the individual was driving or was in control of
   a vehicle while under the influence of an intoxicant. Conduct the extraction in accordance with the
   following procedures: 1) A search authorization by an appropriate commander or military magistrate
   obtained pursuant to Rule 315, Military Rules of Evidence, is required prior to such nonconsensual
   extraction; 2) A search authorization is not required under such circumstances when there is a clear
   indication that one will find evidence of intoxication and there is reason to believe that the delay nec-
   essary to obtain a search authorization would result in the loss or destruction of the evidence sought;
   and 3) Conduct warrantless searches only after coordination with the servicing staff judge advocate
   and attempts to gain authorization from an appropriate official fail because of the unavailability of the
   appropriate commander or military magistrate.
      4.15.2.1. If authorization from the military magistrate or commander proves unsuccessful (due to
      nonavailability), the commander of a medical facility is empowered by Rule 315(d), Military
      Rules of Evidence, to authorize such extraction from an individual located in the facility at the
      time an authorization is sought.
          4.15.2.1.1. Before authorizing the involuntary extraction, the commander of the medical facil-
          ity should, if circumstances permit, coordinate with the servicing staff judge advocate.
          4.15.2.1.2. The medical facility commander authorizing an extraction under Rule 315(d) need
          not be on duty as the attending physician. Any qualified medical person can perform the
          extraction.
          4.15.2.1.3. The authorizing official may consider his or her own observations of the individ-
          ual in determining probable cause.
   4.15.3. Authorization for the nonconsensual extraction of blood samples for evidentiary purposes by
   qualified medical personnel is independent of and not limited by provisions defining medical care,
   such as the provision for nonconsensual medical care pursuant to AFR 160-12. Only qualified medi-
   cal personnel administer extractions and use only reasonable measures to accomplish the procedure.
   Assistance to overcome an individual’s resistance to the extraction is normally provided by law
   enforcement personnel or unit personnel acting under orders from the member’s commanding officer
   or designee. Do not use any form of life endangering force to effect nonconsensual extractions.
      4.15.3.1. Nonconsensual extraction will not interfere with or delay proper medical attention.
      Medical personnel determine the priority given to involuntary fluid extractions when other medi-
      cal treatment is required.

4.16. Testing at the Request of the Apprehended Person.
42                                                           AFI31-204_45SWSUP1_I 1 AUGUST 2003


     4.16.1. A person subject to tests under paragraph 2.3. can request additional testing. These tests are
     paid for by the requesting individual, and an approved facility such as an off-base hospital or research
     laboratory performs the tests. If they desire admissibility of other tests in a military or civilian court
     of law, they must ensure the state (or host nation when in an overseas area) approves the test and test
     method. Complete all tests as soon as possible, noting any delay on the resulting documents.
     4.16.2. If someone requests additional testing, the apprehending official may help make those
     arrangements. However, tests conducted under authority of the UCMJ remain valid when circum-
     stances prevent timely release of the individual, or for whatever reason additional testing is not com-
     pleted.

4.17. Off-installation Traffic Activities. Civil authorities enforce traffic laws in areas not under mili-
tary control. Likewise, the security police often investigate on-base accidents and incidents of interest to
local authorities. Consequently, the CSP must develop a program for the sharing and exchanging of infor-
mation with civil authorities. In overseas areas, these procedures are generally well documented in formal
agreements with the host nation. Local procedures must cover the receiving, processing, and securing of
traffic and related incident reports received from other investigative agencies.
4.17. (45SW) Off-installation Traffic Activities. Civilian traffic violations reported to Security Forces
are processed the same as if committed on base. Administrative action is taken in accordance with estab-
lished procedures. The State of Florida and the state where the violator is licensed are notified of revoca-
tion actions.
     4.17.1. (Added-45SW) Make a blotter entry for off-base driving under the influence (DUI) cases
     involving active duty military assigned to PAFB. The unit of assignment maintains liaison with
     45 SFS/SFAR to provide updates and changes to court dates.

4.18. Compliance With Local and State Laws.
     4.18.1. Installation commanders must ensure drivers comply with state and local traffic laws when
     operating government vehicles on or off base.
     4.18.2. Commanders coordinate with the proper civil law enforcement agency before moving gov-
     ernment vehicles or property that require special handling or exceed legal limits such as weight,
     length, width, or other standards.
     4.18.3. Installation commanders should maintain a close liaison with civil enforcement agencies and
     encourage the following:
        4.18.3.1. When possible, the prompt release of government vehicles and operators involved in
        accidents or incidents.
        4.18.3.2. Prompt notice to military authorities when military personnel or drivers of government
        motor vehicles are involved in traffic accidents or detained for serious violations of civil traffic
        laws.
        4.18.3.3. Prompt notice of any state, local, or host nation action to suspend, revoke, or restrict the
        driving privileges of personnel assigned to the installation.

4.19. Civil-Military Cooperative Programs.
AFI31-204_45SWSUP1_I 1 AUGUST 2003                                                                        43


   4.19.1. The State-Armed Forces Traffic Workshop Program is an organized effort to coordinate mili-
   tary and civil traffic safety activities throughout a state or area. Installation commanders should coop-
   erate and provide proper support and participation.
   4.19.2. The installation commander should establish a community-installation traffic workshop pro-
   gram to coordinate the installation traffic efforts with those of local communities. Sound and practical
   traffic planning depends on a balanced program of traffic enforcement, engineering, and education.
   Civilian and military legal and law enforcement officers, traffic engineers, safety officials, and public
   affairs officers should take part.
4.20. (Added-45SW) The Florida Uniform Traffic Controls Laws. Chapter 316, of the State of Flor-
ida Code, apply to all pedestrians, individuals operating motor vehicles, bicycles, motorcycles, motor
driven cycles, or off-road type vehicles within the boundaries of PAFB, CCAFS, and the Florida Annexes.
Motor vehicles are defined as an automobile, motorcycle, truck, trailer, semi-trailer, truck tractor,
semi-trailer combination or any other vehicle operated on the roads of this state, used to transport persons
or property, and propelled by power other than muscular power, but the term does not include traction
engines, road rollers, such vehicles as run only upon a track, bicycles, or mopeds. In addition to these pro-
visions of the state of Florida, the following rules and regulations apply:

                    DRIVING RECORDS AND THE TRAFFIC POINT SYSTEM

5.1. Driving Records. Use SPAS or the AF Form 1313 to record vehicle traffic accidents, moving and
parking violations, suspension or revocation actions, and traffic point assessments involving military and
DoD civilian personnel, their family members, and other personnel operating motor vehicles on a military
installation. In filling out the form, use the following codes in the “accident classification” block:
     5.1.1. Identify individuals who are principals in a motor vehicle accident as “S” subject or “V” vic-
     tim.
     5.1.2. Identify accidents appropriately with “MVA” minor vehicle accident; “NLD” no liability deter-
     mined; “PD” property damage; “PI” personal injury; “G” government; “P” private; “V” vehicle; and
     “FO” fixed object.

Table 5.1. Suspension/Revocation of Driving Privileges (See Notes 1 and 2).
Assessment: 1. Two-year revocation is mandatory on determination of facts by installation
commander.
Violation: Driving while driver’s license or installation driving privileges are under suspension or
revocation.
Assessment: 2. One-year revocation is mandatory on determination of facts by installation
commander.
Violation: Refusal to submit to or failure to complete chemical tests (implied consent).
Assessment: 3. One-year revocation is mandatory on conviction.
Violation:
1. Manslaughter (or negligent homicide by vehicle) resulting from the operation of a motor vehicle.
2. Driving or in physical control of a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor
0.10% or greater. Note: Where state or local authority use a more stringent standard (i.e., 0.08 instead
of 0.10), Air Force units will assimilate the more stringent standard.
3. Driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of any narcotic or while under the influence of any
other drug (including alcohol) to the degree rendered incapable of safe vehicle operation.
4. Use of a motor vehicle in the commission of a felony.
5. Fleeing the scene of an accident involving death or personal injury (hit and run).
6. Perjury or making a false statement or affidavit under oath to responsible officials relating to the
ownership or operation of motor vehicles.
7. Unauthorized use of a motor vehicle belonging to another, when the act does not amount to a felony.
Assessment: 4. Suspension for a period of six months or less or revocation for a period not to exceed
one year is discretionary.
Violation:
1. Mental or physical impairment (not including alcohol or other drug use) to the degree rendered
incompetent to drive.
AFI31-204_45SWSUP1_I 1 AUGUST 2003                                                                        53


2. Commission of an offense in another state which, if committed on the installation, would establish
grounds for suspension or revocation.
3. Permitting an unlawful or fraudulent use of an official driver’s license.
4. Conviction of fleeing or attempting to elude a police officer.
5. Conviction of racing on the highway.
6. Excessive parking and other non-moving violations as covered under paragraph 2.5.1.1.
NOTES:
1. When imposing a suspension or revocation because of an off-installation offense, the effective date is
the same as the date of civil conviction or the suspension or revocation date of state or host nation driving
privileges. This effective date can be retroactive.
2. No points are assessed solely for revocation or suspension actions. Except for implied consent viola-
tions, base revocations on a conviction by a civilian court, military courts-martial, nonjudicial punishment
under Article 15 of the UCMJ, or a separate hearing as otherwise addressed in this instruction. If revoca-
tion for implied consent is combined with another revocation such as one year for intoxicated driving,
revocations may run consecutively (total of 24 months) or concurrently (total of 12 months). Apply the
installation commander’s policy systematically and not on a case-by-case basis.

5.2. The Traffic Point System. The traffic point system provides a uniform administrative device to
impartially judge service personnel's driving performance. This system is not a disciplinary measure or a
substitute for punitive action. Further, this system is not intended to interfere in any way with the reason-
able exercise of an installation commander’s prerogative to issue, suspend, revoke, deny, or reinstate
installation driving privileges.
5.2. (45SW) The Traffic Point System. The traffic point system is applicable to all motor vehicle oper-
ators on PAFB, CCAFS, the Florida Annexes, and the downrange stations. The point system in KHB
1610.1 is used for violations on CCAFS.

5.3. Point System Application. The use of the point system and procedures prescribed herein are man-
datory. The point system applies to civilian personnel operating government vehicles on and off the
installation and to their POVs driven on-base. It applies to military personnel operating GOVs and POVs
on or off the installation and to dependents, civilian employees, and all other individuals subject to this
instruction operating POVs on the installation. Unless an individual submits a rebuttal, assess points
according to the Table 5.2. Also assess points to individuals found guilty by a military or civilian court,
or upon payment of fine or forfeiture of pay and allowances, or posted bond or collateral. Do not use the
point system for non-moving violations.

assessed points)
Wearing/use of handheld cellular phones/ of headphones/earphones while driving                 3
motor vehicles (two or more wheels.) NOTE: Hands-free mode or use of a single
earphone for handheld cellular phones are authorized.

NOTES:
1. When two or more violations are committed on a single occasion, assess the points for the offense hav-
ing the greater value.
2. Use this measure for other than minor vehicle safety defects or when a driver or registrant fails to cor-
rect a minor defect (for example, a burned out headlight not replaced within the grace period on a warning
ticket).
3. Applies to not using or improper use of a child restraint device, i.e., car seat, infant carrier, booster seat,
belt/strap modification (when required by manufacturer) etc. Assess four points when no restraint system
of any kind is used.

5.4. Point System Procedures.
    5.4.1. Reports of moving traffic violations recorded on DD Form 1408 or DD Form 1805 will serve
    as a basis for determining point assessment.
    5.4.2. On receipt of DD Form 1408 or other military law enforcement report of a moving violation
    (e.g., AFI 3545) the unit commander or designated supervisor will conduct an inquiry. The com-
    mander will take or recommend proper disciplinary or administrative action.
    5.4.3. Distribute citation copies and process point assessments IAW para 4.9.
    5.4.4. Installation commanders may require the following driver improvement measures as appropri-
    ate:
        5.4.4.1. Advisory letter through the unit commander or supervisor to any person who has
        acquired six traffic points within a six-month period.
        5.4.4.2. Counseling or driver improvement interview by the unit commander of any person who
        acquires more than six points but less than 12 traffic points within a six-month period.
        5.4.4.3. Referral for medical evaluation when a driver, based on reasonable belief, appears to
        have mental or physical limits that had, or may have, an adverse effect on driving ability.
        5.4.4.4. Attendance at driver improvement program (DIP) to improve driving skill, awareness, or
        attitude.
56                                                            AFI31-204_45SWSUP1_I 1 AUGUST 2003


        5.4.4.5. Referral to an alcohol or drug treatment or rehabilitation facility for evaluation, counsel-
        ing, or treatment. This action is required for active duty military personnel in all cases in which
        alcohol or other drugs are a contributing factor to a traffic citation, incident, or accident.
     5.4.5. The installation commander may suspend or revoke driving privileges as provided by this
     instruction regardless of whether these improvement measures are accomplished.
     5.4.6. Notify in writing anyone whose driving privileges are suspended or revoked (for one violation
     or an accumulation of 12 traffic points within 12 consecutive months, or 18 traffic points within 24
     consecutive months). Installation commanders determine suspension and revocation periods for
     offenses not covered in Table 5.1.; however, any revocation must be for a period of 6 months or more.
     The installation commander may impose a longer suspension or revocation period (to include offenses
     in Table 5.1.) based on the person’s overall driving record. Consider the frequency, flagrancy, and
     severity of moving violations, and the response to previous driver improvement measures. In all
     cases, military members must successfully complete a prescribed course in remedial driver training
     before reinstatement of driving privileges.
     5.4.7. Points assessed against a person remain in effect for point accumulation purposes for 24 con-
     secutive months. Routinely review driver records to delete traffic points during records update while
     recording new offenses and forwarding records to new duty stations. Completion of a revocation
     based on points requires removal from the driver record of all points assessed before the revocation.
     5.4.8. Removal of points does not authorize removal of driving record entries for moving violations,
     chargeable accidents, suspensions, or revocations. Recorded entries will remain posted on individual
     driving records for the period of time indicated below.
        5.4.8.1. Chargeable nonfatal traffic accidents or moving violations--three years.
        5.4.8.2. Nonmandatory suspensions or revocations--five years.
        5.4.8.3. Mandatory revocations--seven years.

5.5. Disposition of Driving Records. Establish procedures to promptly notify the CSP when a person
assigned to or employed on the installation is transferred to another installation, released from military
service, or ends employment or affiliation with the installation.
     5.5.1. If persons transferred to another Air Force installation have valid points or other entries on
     their driving records, the CSP must forward the records to the CSP of the gaining installation. The
     gaining CSP should coordinate with applicable commanders and continue any Air Force suspension
     or revocation based on intoxicated driving or accumulation of traffic points. Traffic points for persons
     transferred will continue to accumulate as specified in para 5.4.7.
     5.5.2. Follow AFI 37-138, Records Disposition--Procedures and Responsibilities, and AFMAN
     37-139, Records Disposition Schedule, to maintain and destroy records of military personnel released
     from active duty. Driving records remain active in the case of immediate reenlistment, change of
     officer component, or military and civilian retirement when continued vehicle registration is autho-
     rized. Retain or destroy according to AFMAN 37-139 records on civilian personnel who are terminat-
     ing on-base employment or on-base registration.
     5.5.3. Forward driving records of military family members containing point assessments or other
     entries to the sponsor’s gaining installation and review in the same manner as for service members.
     Retain driving records of retirees electing to retain installation driving privileges. Do not delete points

                                                  Chapter 6

                           IMPOUNDING PRIVATELY OWNED VEHICLES

6.1. General. This chapter provides the standards and procedures for law enforcement personnel when
towing, inventorying, searching, impounding, and disposing of POVs. This policy is based on:
     6.1.1. The interests of the Air Force in crime prevention, traffic safety, and the orderly flow of vehicle
     traffic movement.
     6.1.2. The vehicle owner's constitutional rights to due process, freedom from unreasonable search
     and seizure, and freedom from deprivation of private property.

6.2. Standards for Impoundment.
     6.2.1. You should not impound a vehicle unless it interferes with traffic, threatens public safety or
     convenience, is involved in criminal activity, contains evidence of criminal activity, or is stolen or
     abandoned.
     6.2.2. The impoundment of vehicles is inappropriate if other reasonable alternatives exist. When
     possible, attempt to locate the owner of the POV and have the vehicle removed. If reasonably feasi-
     ble, allow another responsible person to drive or tow the POV, if they first have permission from the
     owner, operator, or person empowered to control the vehicle. However in such cases, the security
     police (or towing contractor) is not responsible for safeguarding the vehicle.
     6.2.3. Impounding of POVs is justified when any of the following conditions exist:
        6.2.3.1. The vehicle is illegally parked:
            6.2.3.1.1. On a street or bridge, in a tunnel, or is double parked and interferes with the orderly
            flow of traffic.
            6.2.3.1.2. On a sidewalk, within an intersection, on a crosswalk, on a railroad track, in a fire
            lane, or is blocking a driveway so that the vehicle interferes with operations or creates a safety
            hazard to other roadway users or the general public.
            6.2.3.1.3. When blocking an emergency exit door of any public place.
            6.2.3.1.4. In a “tow-away” zone that is so marked with signs.
        6.2.3.2. The vehicle interferes with or is involved in one of the following:
            6.2.3.2.1. Street cleaning or snow removal operations after attempts to contact the owner fail.
            6.2.3.2.2. Emergency operations during a natural disaster, fire, or other emergency.
            6.2.3.2.3. The vehicle was used in a crime or contains evidence of criminal activity.
            6.2.3.2.4. The owner or person in charge of the vehicle is apprehended and therefore unable
            (or unwilling) to arrange removal of the vehicle.
            6.2.3.2.5. The POV is mechanically defective and is a menace to others using the public road-
            ways.
            6.2.3.2.6. The POV is disabled by a traffic accident and the operator is unavailable or physi-
            cally incapable of having the vehicle towed to a place of safety for storage or safekeeping.
AFI31-204_45SWSUP1_I 1 AUGUST 2003                                                                         59


          6.2.3.2.7. Law enforcement personnel reasonably believe the vehicle is abandoned.

6.3. Towing and Storage.
   6.3.1. The Air Force or a contracted wrecker service may tow and store impounded POVs depending
   on availability of towing services and the local commander’s preference.
      6.3.1.1. (Added-45SW) The installation wrecker service tows POVs for violations of the traffic
      code or involvement in criminal activity under the direct supervision of the investigating law
      enforcement agency.
      6.3.1.2. (Added-45SW) Civilian wrecker services use impoundment areas approved by the sher-
      iff’s department and provide accountability and security of towed POV.
   6.3.2. The installation commander designates a securable enclosed area on the installation for use as
   an impound lot. You may use an impoundment area belonging to a contracted wrecker service pro-
   vided the area is reasonably secure. The CSP approves contractor impoundment areas and maintains
   keys for all on-base impoundment areas.
   6.3.3. Impound or tow POVs for appropriate violations of the installation traffic code or involvement
   in criminal activities under the direct supervision of law enforcement personnel.
   6.3.3. (45SW) A POV will be towed and impounded if it interferes with traffic, threatens public
   safety or convenience, is involved in criminal activity, contains evidence of criminal activity, or is sto-
   len or abandoned. Impoundment is justified when it interferes with or is involved in one of the follow-
   ing:
      6.3.3.1. (Added-45SW) Vehicles are parked and interfere with the orderly flow of traffic.
      6.3.3.2. (Added-45SW) Vehicles are parked on a sidewalk, within an intersection, on a crosswalk,
      on a railroad track, in a fire lane, or blocking a driveway so that the vehicle interferes with opera-
      tions or creates a safety hazard to other roadway users or the general public.
      6.3.3.3. (Added-45SW) When blocking an emergency exit door of any public place.
      6.3.3.4. (Added-45SW) Parked in a “tow-away” zone that is clearly marked with signs.
      6.3.3.5. (Added-45SW) Street cleaning operations after 72 hours and a reasonable number of
      attempts to contact the owner fail.
      6.3.3.6. (Added-45SW) Emergency operations during a natural disaster, fire, or other emergency.

6.4. Procedures for Impoundment.
6.4. (45SW) Procedures for Impoundment. 45 SFS/SFOI impounds POVs at PAFB. The JBOSC
Chief, Security Police impounds POVs at CCAFS and the Florida Annexes. The local Range Technical
Services Fire/Security Chief impounds at downrange stations. Violators are charged according to the con-
tract implemented at the time of towing.
     6.4.1. Unattended POVs.
        6.4.1.1. Conspicuously place DD Form 2504, Abandoned Vehicle Notice (See DODD 5525.4),
        on POVs considered abandoned or improperly unattended. Document this action with an entry in
        the security police blotter.
        6.4.1.2. Allow the owner three days from the date the POV is tagged to remove the vehicle. Have
        the vehicle towed if it's not moved within the allotted time. If a contracted wrecker service is used,
        complete a DD Form 2505 according to local procedures.
        6.4.1.3. After the vehicle is removed, security police or the contractor completes the DD Form
        2506, Vehicle Impoundment Report (See DODD 5525.4), as a record of action taken.
           6.4.1.3.1. Law enforcement personnel or the towing contractor conduct an inventory listing
           personal property. Do not open closed containers such as a suitcase unless necessary to iden-
           tify the owner or if the contents might present a danger to the public. In most cases, listing the
           container and sealing it with security tape will suffice.
           6.4.1.3.2. Place personal property in a secure area for safekeeping.
        6.4.1.4. Forward DD Form 2507, Notice of Vehicle Impoundment (See DODD 5525.4), by cer-
        tified mail to the address of the last known owner of the vehicle to advise the owner of the
        impoundment action and request information concerning the owner’s intentions concerning the
        vehicle.
        6.4.1.5. (Added-45SW) Prior to vehicles being stored in the impound lot, the following adminis-
        trative tasks must be accomplished:
           6.4.1.5.1. (Added-45SW) Blotter entry.
           6.4.1.5.2. (Added-45SW) AF Form 52, Evidence Tag (For vehicle seized as evidence only).
           6.4.1.5.3. (Added-45SW) AF Form 3545, Incident Report (If needed).
           6.4.1.5.4. (Added-45SW) DD Form 2505, Abandoned Vehicle Removal Authorization (for
           abandoned vehicles only).
           6.4.1.5.5. (Added-45SW) DD Form 2506, Vehicle Impoundment Report. Provide one copy
           to the wrecker service.
           6.4.1.5.6. (Added-45SW) Vehicles will not be stored in the impound lot at an owner's request.
           Refer routine requests to 45th Services Squadron
           6.4.1.5.7. (Added-45SW) If a vehicle is suspected of being abandoned, accomplish a DD
           Form 2504, Abandoned Vehicle Notice. Place one copy conspicuously on the vehicle,
AFI31-204_45SWSUP1_I 1 AUGUST 2003                                                                       61


           informing the owner to contact Security Forces Investigations (SFOI). Attempt to make con-
           tact with owner during your shift and if no contact can be made forward the original copy of
           the DD Form 2504 to SFOI. SFOI will attempt to locate the owner’s organization (military or
           civilian) to determine if he/she is TDY, PCS, or discharged. The owner will have 3 days from
           the date the vehicle is tagged to remove it before impoundment action is initiated.
   6.4.2. Stolen POVs or vehicles involved in criminal activity.
   6.4.2. (45SW) If a vehicle is to be impounded as evidence, the element leader will ensure DD Form
   2505, Abandoned Vehicle Removal Authorization, and DD Form 2507, Notice of Vehicle
   Impoundment, is completed prior to calling the on-call investigator.
       6.4.2.1. Keep vehicles in Air Force custody when holding them for evidentiary purposes. Release
       recovered stolen POVs to the registered owner, unless held for evidentiary purposes, or to the law
       enforcement agency reporting the vehicle stolen, as appropriate.
       6.4.2.1. (45SW) SFOI will normally call the towing company, but at the direction of the on-call
       investigator, the SFCC may call the towing company to avoid time delays. The on-call investiga-
       tor will respond and escort the vehicle to the impound lot and complete all necessary forms.
       NOTE. The vehicle will not be moved until SFOI arrives to ensure a proper chain of custody.
       6.4.2.2. At times, civilian law enforcement or civilian government agencies will request the Air
       Force impound an on-base vehicle for reasons not related to military issues. Staff such requests
       through the Staff Judge Advocate and CSP. When appropriate, comply and support such requests
       and impound the vehicle for a reasonable period. Release the vehicle if civil authorities do not
       take custody of the vehicle within a reasonable period as determined by the installation com-
       mander.

6.5. Search Incident to Impoundment Based On Criminal Activity. Search of a POV in conjunction
with impoundment based on criminal activity will likely occur in one of the following general situations:
   6.5.1. The owner or operator is not present. This situation could arise during traffic and crime-related
   impoundments and abandoned vehicle seizures. Do not search the vehicle unless evidence or contra-
   band is in plain view or is readily discernible on the outside as evidence of criminal activity. When in
   doubt, obtain proper search authority before searching.
   6.5.2. The owner or operator is present. This situation can occur during a traffic or criminal incident
   or if the operator is apprehended for a crime or serious traffic violation and sufficient probable cause
   exists to seize the vehicle. In some cases, the operator is present but is unwilling, incapacitated, or
   otherwise unable to make adequate arrangements to safeguard the vehicle. As a general rule, you may
   search vehicles without search authority when there is a reasonable danger to police or public, there is
   a risk of loss or destruction of evidence, or the search is reasonable under rules governing search inci-
   dent to apprehension.

6.6. Disposition Of Vehicles After Impoundment.
   6.6.1. When a vehicle is impounded, hold it for as long as necessary for evidentiary, law enforcement,
   or other legal purposes. Unless directed otherwise by competent authority, release vehicles and prop-
   erty when no longer needed for one of the reasons stated above. Review Title 10, USC 2575, Dispo-
   sition of Unclaimed Property, and DoD Directive 4160.21-M, Defense Reutilization Marketing
62                                                          AFI31-204_45SWSUP1_I 1 AUGUST 2003


     Manual, (when DRMO is used) before taking action to dispose of vehicles not claimed by the owner
     or an authorized agent.
     6.6.2. A vehicle is considered abandoned 60 days after making reasonable good faith efforts to con-
     tact the owner or when the owner is contacted and fails to take appropriate steps to assume responsi-
     bility for the vehicle. When owners decline to recover their vehicles, attempt to secure release of the
     vehicle by having the registered owners complete and sign the DD Form 2507. The 60-day waiting
     period does not apply when the owner releases the vehicle to the Air Force on DD Form 2507, signed
     letter, power of attorney, or other legally recognized document.
        6.6.2.1. Once the vehicle becomes the lawful possession of the Air Force, process the vehicle as
        abandoned property in accordance with local procedures. Unless otherwise directed, installation
        commanders have considerable latitude in determining the best use for, or disposal of, abandoned
        property. Scrap, auction, or use to support Morale, Welfare, and Recreation (MWR) activities are
        potential options. Consider local, state, or if applicable, host nation requirements. If you process
        vehicles through the Defense Reutilization Marketing Office (DRMO), follow applicable DRMO
        and DoD directives.
