                                                Chapter 1

                                     GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. General. All evaluations will be conducted IAW the provisions of AFI 11-202V2, Aircrew Stan-
dardization/ Evaluation Program, and this volume.

1.2. Waivers.
Waiver authority for this publication is the MAJCOM DO/A3. Waivers will be requested from the parent
MAJCOM Stan/Eval through appropriate channels.

1.3. Procedures:
    1.3.1. Flight Examiners (FE) will use the evaluation criteria contained in Chapter 3 for conducting
    all flight and emergency procedures evaluations. To ensure standard and objective evaluations, Flight
    Examiners will be thoroughly familiar with the prescribed evaluation criteria.
    1.3.2. Recording devices (Operational Debriefing System (ODS), AARI, Air Combat Maneuvering
    Instrumentation (ACMI), etc.) should be used, when available, to reconstruct/evaluate the mission.
    1.3.3. Unless specified, the examinee or flight examiner may fly in any flight position (to include
    chase) which will best enable the flight examiner to conduct a thorough evaluation.
    1.3.4. The flight examiner will brief the examinee on the purpose of the evaluation and how it will be
    conducted prior to flight. The examinee will accomplish required flight planning in accordance with
    the flight position during the evaluation. Higher Headquarters (HHQ) flight examiners (and unit flight
    examiners as determined locally) will be furnished a copy of necessary mission data, mission materi-
    als and data transfer cartridge loads.
    1.3.5. Required areas are shown in Table 2.1. When unable to evaluate a required area in flight, it
    may be evaluated by an alternate method (i.e., in a Full Mission Trainer, FMT or Weapon Tactics
    Trainer, WTT, or by oral examination) in order to complete the evaluation. The reason why required
    area(s) were not evaluated inflight and the alternate method of evaluation used will be documented in
    the Comments portion of the AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification.
    1.3.6. The flight examiner will thoroughly debrief all aspects of the flight. This debrief will include
    the examinee's overall rating, specific deviations, area grades assigned (if other than qualified) and
    any required additional training.

1.4. Grading Instructions. Standards and performance parameters are contained in AFI 11-202V2 and
this instruction.
    1.4.1. The flight examiner will base tolerances for inflight parameters on conditions of smooth air and
    a stable aircraft. Do not consider momentary deviations from tolerances, provided the examinee
    applies prompt corrective action and such deviations do not jeopardize flying safety. The flight exam-
    iner will consider cumulative deviations when determining the overall grade.
    1.4.2. When grading criteria specify that airspeed/angle of attack (AOA) be evaluated and the flight
    manual lists only a minimum/maximum/recommended airspeed/AOA for that area, the examinee will
    brief the desired airspeed/AOA.
AFI11-2F-22AV2 25 AUGUST 2003                                                                               5


     1.4.3. The flight examiner will compare examinee performance for each area accomplished during
     the evaluation with the standards provided in this volume and assign an appropriate grade for the area.
     Derive the overall flight evaluation grade from the area grades based on a composite for the observed
     events and tasks IAW this publication.
        1.4.3.1. Flight examiners will use the grading criteria in this volume to determine individual area
        grades. Flight examiner judgment must be exercised when the wording of areas is subjective and
        when specific situations are not covered.
        1.4.3.2. If the examinee receives an unqualified area grade in any of the critical areas identified by
        this volume, an overall unqualified grade will be assigned. Unsatisfactory performance in any crit-
        ical area or critical subarea will result in qualification level of "Q-3."
        1.4.3.3. Flight examiner judgment will be the determining factor in arriving at the overall grade.
        1.4.3.4. The following general criteria apply during all phases of flight except as noted for spe-
        cific events and instrument final approaches:

Table 1.1. General Criteria.
Q          Altitude                 +/- 200 feet

U                                   Exceeded Q- limits

1.5. Emergency Procedures Evaluation (EPE). The Full Mission Trainer or Weapons Tactics Trainer
will be used to conduct the requisite EPE. If a FMT or WTT is not used, the EPE will be given verbally.
This evaluation will include areas commensurate with examinee's Ready Aircrew Program (RAP) train-
ing level.
     1.5.1. The following items will be included on all emergency procedures evaluations:
        1.5.1.1. Aircraft General Knowledge.
        1.5.1.2. Emergency Procedures. Evaluate a minimum of two emergency procedures per phase
        of flight (i.e., pre-takeoff, takeoff, cruise, and landing).
        1.5.1.3. Unusual Attitude Recoveries. This also fulfills the Area 15 (Unusual Attitude Recover-
        ies) requirement for all evaluations.

    1.5.2. The following additional items will be included on EPEs as a requisite for the instrument and/
    or qualification evaluation:
       1.5.2.1. AFMAN 11-217, Instrument Flight Procedures. Evaluate a minimum of one Heads-up
       Display (HUD) out approach and use of standby flight group/ADI.
       1.5.2.2. Alternate/Divert Airfields. Evaluate a minimum of one approach at other than home
       base.
    1.5.3. Mission evaluation scenarios should be tailored to unit tasking. The following additional items
    should be included on the emergency procedures evaluation given as a requisite to the mission evalu-
    ation:
       1.5.3.1. Weapons system operation.
       1.5.3.2. Signature Management/Electronic Protect (EP)/All Aspect Missile Defense (AAMD)
       1.5.3.3. Weapons employment and switchology.
    1.5.4. Examinees receiving an overall unqualified grade will be placed in supervised status until rec-
    ommended additional training is completed and/or a reevaluation is successfully accomplished. Addi-
    tional training and reevaluations will be accomplished IAW AFI 11-202V2.
    1.5.5. The following grading criteria will be used to grade individual items on EPEs:
       1.5.5.1. Q. Performance is correct. Quickly recognizes and corrects errors.
       1.5.5.2. Q-. Performance is safe, but indicates limited proficiency. Makes errors of omission or
       commission.
       1.5.5.3. U. Performance is unsafe or indicates lack of knowledge or ability.

                                                 Chapter 2

                                   EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS

2.1. General:
    2.1.1. All evaluations will follow the guidelines set in AFI 11-202V2, Chapter 5. The procedures and
    flight profiles outlined in this chapter apply to all F-22A units. Evaluation requirements are depicted
    in Table 2.1.
    2.1.2. Areas indicated with an "R" are required items for that evaluation. A required area is a specific
    area that must be evaluated to complete the evaluation. All required areas must be included in the
    flight evaluation profile. However, if it is impossible to accomplish a required area inflight, the flight
    examiner may elect to evaluate the area(s) by an alternate method (i.e., FMT, WTT, or verbally), in
    order to complete the evaluation. If the flight examiner determines the required item cannot be ade-
    quately evaluated by an alternate method, the examinee will require an additional flight to complete
    the evaluation.
    2.1.3. (added) Publications Check:
    Publications that will be checked during the evaluation are:
       2.1.3.1. (added) T.O. 1F-22A-1CL-1
       2.1.3.2. (added) T.O. 1F-22A-34-1-3CL-1
       2.1.3.3. (added) Local Inflight Guide
       2.1.3.4. (added) Any additional publications issued to aircrews and specified in the unit adden-
       dum to AFI 11-202V2.

2.2. Pilot Instrument/Qualification Evaluation. A mission flown according to instrument flight rules
(to the maximum extent practical) best fulfills the objective of the instrument/qualification evaluation. To
the maximum extent possible, this evaluation will include approaches at airfields other than home or
deployed locations. This evaluation may be administered on any compatible training mission with the
approval of the unit Chief of Stan/Eval with Commander's concurrence. Minimum ground phase requi-
sites are:
    2.2.1. Instrument Refresher Course (IRC) Training (IAW AFMAN 11-210, Instrument Refresher
    Course (IRC) Program).
    2.2.2. Instrument (IRC) examination.
    2.2.3. Closed and open book qualification examinations.
    2.2.4. EPE.
    2.2.5. Publications check.

2.3. Mission Evaluation. Scenarios that represent unit Designed Operational Capability (DOC) tasking
satisfy the requirements of this evaluation. The profiles will be designed to evaluate the training/flight
position/special qualifications as well as basic airmanship of the examinee. Initial mission evaluations
will be given in the primary DOC of the unit. Mission evaluations will normally be flown using unit for-
AFI11-2F-22AV2 25 AUGUST 2003                                                                               9


mations and tactics. Examinees will be evaluated in the position of their highest qualification. If briefed,
at the flight examiners discretion, portions may be flown in another position, but the emphasis is to have
examinees evaluated at their highest qualification level. Based on the examinee's experience level, a
wingman may be required to brief (to include tactics) and/or lead certain phases of the mission, but will
not be evaluated using flight lead grading criteria. Evaluations during exercises or deployments are
encouraged. NOTE: Basic Mission Capable (BMC) pilots will only be evaluated on those missions rou-
tinely performed. Examinees will only be evaluated on those areas for which they are qualified.
   2.3.1. Minimum ground phase requisites are:
       2.3.1.1. EPE.
   2.3.2. Air-to-Air. This evaluation will include, as a minimum, one intercept, offensive maneuvering
   and planned weapons employment. When practical, adversaries should simulate enemy aircraft, tac-
   tics and ordnance. Dissimilar aircraft are permitted. Additionally, pilots:
       2.3.2.1. Must have systems IAW MESL.
       2.3.2.2. Will normally perform one Air Sovereignty Tasking (if applicable to unit DOC statement
       tasking).
       2.3.2.3. When weather or other restrictions prohibit D/ACBT, or LOWAT, they may fly multiple
       intercepts.
   2.3.3. Air-to-Surface. Validate all releases IAW AFTTP 3-1 (or current ROTs) using ODS. Mission
   profiles may include actual delivery of practice or live ordnance if delivery of ordnance does not sig-
   nificantly decrease the realism of the sortie. Timing for delivery should be appropriate to the tasking.
       2.3.3.1. Accomplishing an actual delivery would significantly decrease the realism of the sortie.
       2.3.3.2. The mission profile allows a thorough evaluation of the examinee.

2.4. Formal Course Evaluation. Syllabus evaluations will be flown IAW syllabus mission profile
guidelines if stated, or on a mission profile developed from syllabus training objectives. Formal course
guidelines may be modified, based on local operating considerations or flight examiner judgment, to com-
plete the evaluation. Training objectives and related areas will be graded using the performance criteria in
Chapter 3.

2.5. Instructor Evaluation. Instructor evaluations will be conducted IAW AFI 11-202V2. Flight evalua-
tions will include a thorough evaluation of the examinee's instructor knowledge and ability. During the
initial instructor evaluation, the examinee must demonstrate ability to instruct in the unit's mission as well
as other required areas. Except for requirements delineated in Table 2.1., the Flight Examiner will deter-
mine specific profiles and/or events . Subsequent evaluations (for example, Instrument/Qualification,
Mission) will include instructor portions during the evaluations.
   2.5.1. Instructor pilots (IP) should fly a portion of the mission in the chase position.
   2.5.2. FTU Instructor Pilot. FTU Instructor Pilot mission evaluation profiles will normally be IAW
   the formal course syllabus for any mission which the IP is qualified to instruct.
