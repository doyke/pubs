                                             Chapter 1

      MISSILE MAINTENANCE MANAGEMENT PHILOSOPHY AND GUIDANCE

1.1. AFI 21-200, Munitions and Missile Maintenance Management. AFI 21-200 contains
general information to support Air Force munitions and missile maintenance and provides broad
responsibilities for these organizations. It is the capstone document that defines munitions
organizational structure and related roles and responsibilities and is supported by a family of 21-
2XX series instructions, which includes this volume of AFI 21-202.
1.2. Introduction. This instruction prescribes specific missile maintenance guidance and
procedures to be used throughout the USAF and provides senior leadership and management
direction for the accomplishment of this mission. This AFI provides guidance for Cruise Missile
Maintenance (CMM) for both the Conventional Air Launched Cruise Missile (CALCM) and Air
Launched Cruise Missile (ALCM). CMM encompasses all maintenance actions performed by
the sections listed in Chapter 4 on Cruise Missile Systems and related equipment regardless of
supported mission or location.
1.3. Publications. Air Force Missile Systems is defined by this instruction. MAJCOMs may
supplement this AFI or publish a separate instruction IAW AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms
Management. Units must tailor procedures to the unique aspects of their own maintenance
operation and publish directives, instructions, and supplements. Additionally, functional
areas must tailor procedures to operating instructions according to AFI 33-360 areas where
more detailed guidance or specific procedures will ensure a smooth and efficient operation.
Adhere to the following procedures:
     1.3.1. Do not publish unit instructions or Operating Instructions (OI) to change or
     supplement Technical Orders (TO). Use the authorized procedures in TO 00-5-1, AF
     Technical Order System.
     1.3.2. Coordinate directives with all appropriate unit agencies.
1.4. Supervision of Maintenance. Safety, security, reliability, quality, and timeliness in the
planning, scheduling, and performance of maintenance must be emphasized at all levels of
supervision.
1.5. Missile and Equipment Readiness. Missile and equipment readiness is the mission.
Maintenance ensures assigned missile and support equipment are operationally available to meet
mission requirements. Maintenance actions include, but are not limited to: certification,
inspection, repair, overhaul, modification, preservation, refurbishment, testing, and analyzing
condition and performance.
     1.5.1. Manage nuclear-certified equipment, software, vehicles, and end items identified in
     USAF Master Nuclear Certification List (MNCL) per AFI 63-125, Nuclear Certification
     Program, and Supplements to AFI 63-125.
1.6. Preventive Maintenance (Find and Fix Philosophy). The primary focus of the
maintenance effort must be on preventive rather than corrective actions. Preventive maintenance
ensures assets are available at the time of need and function as designed. A conscientious and
disciplined approach to preventive maintenance is required to meet this goal safely and
AFI21-202V2I 29 OCTOBER 2014                                                                 5


effectively. The CMM Find and Fix Philosophy requires all technicians to actively inspect
maintenance areas, equipment, and missiles to identify and correct discrepancies on the spot or
document delayed discrepancy items in the Maintenance Information System (MIS). Preventive
maintenance concepts are described in TO 00-20-1, Aerospace Equipment Maintenance
Inspection, Documentation, Polices, and Procedures.
1.7. Use of TOs and Supplements. Use of the prescribed TOs to maintain missile systems and
associated equipment is mandatory. ’Use’ is defined as having the appropriate TO in the
immediate work area and open to the current step of the task being performed and referenced for
direction in performing required tasks.
   1.7.1. When a technician does not have physical access to TOs and are performing
   maintenance operations, mate/demate, final assembly, checkout, and handling tasks with
   weapons, they shall use verbal demand-response. The step to be performed, along with all
   notes, cautions and warnings, will be read to the technicians performing the work. The
   performing technicians will acknowledge understanding, perform the step, and then verbally
   verify completion to the person reading the steps. The person reading the steps will then
   check off the steps. If technicians are using technical data and checking off steps as they
   perform them, a team chief must ensure all steps are completed prior to weapon/component
   reassembly. Note: the above referenced operations often require the use of general
   procedures contained in both Operations and Maintenance and Methods and Procedures TOs
   (i.e. 11N-35-51, 1-1A-8, 00-25-234, etc.). These TOs do not require verbal demand-response
   or checking off of steps.
