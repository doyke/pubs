                                            Chapter 1

     MISSILE MAINTENANCE MANAGEMENT PHILOSOPHY AND GUIDANCE

1.1. AFI21-200, Munitions and Missile Maintenance Management. AFI21-200 contains
general information to support Air Force munitions and missile maintenance and provides broad
responsibilities for these organizations. This Air Force Instruction (AFI) is the capstone
document that defines munitions organizational structure and related roles and responsibilities
and is supported by a family of 21-2XX series instructions, which includes AFI21-202.
1.2. Introduction. This instruction prescribes specific missile maintenance guidance and
procedures to be used throughout the USAF and provides senior leadership and management
direction for the accomplishment of this mission. This AFI provides guidance for Cruise Missile
(CM) maintenance.
1.3. Supervision of Maintenance. All levels of supervision must place emphasis on safety,
security, quality, and timeliness in the performance of maintenance.
1.4. Missile and Equipment Readiness. Missile and equipment readiness is the maintenance
mission. Maintenance ensures assigned missile and support equipment are safe, serviceable and
properly configured to meet mission needs. Maintenance actions include, but are not limited to,
certification, inspection, repair, overhaul, modification, preservation, refurbishment, testing, and
analyzing condition and performance.
   1.4.1. Manage nuclear-certified equipment, software, vehicles, and end items identified in
   USAF Master Nuclear Certification List https://wwwmil.nwc.kirtland.af.mil/MNCL/index.cfm
   per AFI 63-125, Nuclear Certification Program.
1.5. Preventive Maintenance. The purpose of the entire maintenance process is to sustain a
capability to support operational mission requirements. To accomplish this objective, the
primary focus of the maintenance effort should be on preventive rather than corrective
maintenance. Preventive (or scheduled) maintenance ensures equipment is ready and available
at the time of need. A conscientious and disciplined approach to preventive maintenance will be
the method used to meet that goal safely and effectively. Preventive maintenance concepts are
described in TO 00-20-1, Aerospace Equipment Maintenance Inspection, Documentation,
Polices, and Procedures.
1.6. Use of Technical Orders (TO) and Supplements. Use of the prescribed technical data to
maintain missile systems and associated equipment is mandatory.
   1.6.1. Supervisors will:
       1.6.1.1. Strictly enforce adherence to and compliance with TOs and supplements.
       1.6.1.2. Ensure availability of required TOs and supplements.
   1.6.2. All personnel will:
       1.6.2.1. Recommend improvements or corrections for TO deficiencies IAW TO 00-5-1,
       AF Technical Order System. Official TO updates are the only valid authority for
       correcting a technical deficiency and implementing change.

        1.6.2.2. Continually assess the currency, adequacy, availability, and condition of TOs
        and supplements.
1.7. Publications. Air Force Missile Systems and Space Systems Maintenance is defined by
this instruction. MAJCOMs may supplement this AFI or publish a separate instruction IAW AFI
33-360, Publications and Forms Management. Units must tailor procedures to the unique
aspects of their own maintenance operation and publish directives, instructions, supplements and,
for functional areas, operating instructions according to AFI 33-360 areas where more detailed
guidance or specific procedures will ensure a smooth and efficient operation. Adhere to the
following procedures:
     1.7.1. Do not publish unit instructions or Operating Instructions (OI) to change or
     supplement TOs. Use the authorized procedures in TO 00-5-1.
     1.7.2. Coordinate directives with all appropriate unit agencies.

     2.2.4.4. Use MIS Automated History Event function for Air Force Technical Order
     (AFTO) Form 95, Significant Historical Data, data. Automated forms may be used
     unless classified. Paper histories may be maintained in conjunction with automated
     histories. In addition to T.O. 00-20-1, Aerospace Equipment Maintenance Inspection,
     Documentation, Policies, and Procedures requirements, the following historical entries
     are required for serially tracked items: record completed Time Change Technical Orders
     (TCTOs), acceptance inspections, captive flight hours flown aboard aircraft, elapsed time
     indicator reading (if applicable), narrative for all removal actions to include reason for
     removal (failed test number & values if applicable) and employee number of individual
     performing action. Supplemental historical records are required for engines and select
     missile components listed in the -6 T.O. These records must remain with the missile
     records while the component is installed and must be updated and forwarded when the
     component is replaced and shipped. Missile AFTO Form 95 will reflect part number and
     serial number of all serially controlled items listed in the -6 T.O. For time change items
     not recorded in an automated MDD reporting process, include part number, serial
     number, lot number, date of manufacture and time change due date. Additionally, missile
     must have fuel batch date and number annotated on AFTO Form 95.

     assigned missiles to track serially-controlled items. Ensure ALCM/CALCM/ACM
     installed component configuration status is maintained using Reliability and
     Maintainability Information System (REMIS).
        2.2.4.5.1. Out-of-configuration conditions must be verified and corrected. Establish
        delayed discrepancy for each out-of-configuration condition. Ensure Work Center
        Event is added for Work Unit Code, part number and/or serial number requiring
        physical verification.
     2.2.4.6. Electronic Systems Test Set (ESTS) printouts must be maintained for each
     missile and empty/loaded launcher/pylon for the most recent test conducted. Printouts
     may be abbreviated as allowed by tech data, but maintained intact as printed and include
     Unit Under Test (UUT) identification/serial number, test date, employee number and test
     result. Inertial Navigation Element (INE) autocalibration printouts must also be
     maintained for the most recent autocalibration completed in each missile’s respective
     record file. If INE Auto calibration is performed while installed on a launcher or pylon,
     the original copy is kept with the launcher or pylon records and only as much of the
     ESTS printout as required to fulfill the requirements of this paragraph must be copied for
     inclusion in the individual missile(s) AFTO Form(s) 95.
     2.2.4.6.1. Autocalibration dates for INEs received through supply will be derived from
     the INE AFTO Forms 95.
     2.2.4.7. Successful end-to-end UUT or SIT FDR printouts are the only source documents
     for certification of missiles and/or launch gear to allow association of War Reserve
     Payloads.
