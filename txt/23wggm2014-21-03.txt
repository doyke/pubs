verification sheets that will be accomplished at each phase/ISO inspection. The standardized
Serial Number Verification sheets are located and will be maintained on the 23 PS&D
SharePoint site. The Serial Number Verification sheet will be handed to the phase/ISO dock
chief during the pre-dock meeting. The phase/ISO dock chief will ensure that a complete
physical verification of all identified items on the checklist occurs during the phase/ISO
inspection. If disparities exist, the updated data will be annotated on the checklist and will be
updated in IMDS by the dock chief. If any limiting factors preclude the dock chief from making
corrections within the IMDS database, contact PS&D for assistance. Upon completion of the
phase/ISO, during the post-dock meeting, the dock chief will provide the completed Serial
Number Verification sheet to PS&D. PS&D will run an IMDS screen 810 to verify the items on
the Serial Number Verification. If disparities exist, PS&D will contact the dock chief for
correction. Once verified with IMDS, PS&D will file the Serial Number Verification sheet in
the aircraft jacket file. A-10s will also refer to AFI 21-101 paragraphs 7.2.2.17, 7.2.2.2 and 7.2.3

no access to MIS database then the following electronic (i.e., Disk, CD etc.) versions of the
following MIS products: TCI & SI PRA, SHD, TRE, TSS, & EVL. PS&D may also use
equivalent MSAT output products in place of the above mentioned MIS products, as long as the
MSAT products encompass the intent of the MIS products. The applicable PS&D scheduler will
ensure that all AFTO Form 95 required items are automated within the MIS database to alleviate
the necessity to provide photocopies of original hard copy 95s. Due to the possibility of loss of
critical historical documentation, jacket files will not be sent to the deployed location. Upon re-
deployment, the applicable PS&D scheduler will review any and all maintenance actions of
historical significance that occurred at the deployed location and will ensure that the data is
captured and entered in to the MIS system ASAP.

containers (hoppers) will be emptied as required to prevent overflow of collected debris.
Towable sweepers will be for flightline use only and will be disconnected from vehicles leaving
the flightline area.

14.19.2.11.1. (Added) FOD walks of aircraft parking areas will be conducted prior to the start of
each flying day. The first work-shift in ISO, Phase, Propulsion and other back-shop work-
centers, at minimum, will perform a beginning of shift FOD walk prior to performing any
maintenance. Supervisors will ensure personnel are spaced apart to provide complete coverage of
the area (no more than 10 feet apart) and personnel are not dismissed until area is FO free. Close
attention will be paid to expansion joints, seams, and grounding points for small stones,
deteriorating concrete and loose tar during all FOD walks/inspections. FO will be removed from
workbenches, stands and ground equipment. Supervision will ensure areas around work-center
and routes traveled by personnel and vehicles between work-center and aircraft are kept FO free.
Particular attention will be given to areas traveled by flightline dispatched vehicles and
equipment (including AGE ready line and sub-pools).

14.19.2.11.2. (Added) Whenever FO is discovered on the flightline, the area will be cleaned
immediately. If the debris is excessive, personnel shall contact Maintenance Operations Control

AMU/HMU for proper configuration.

14.49. (Added) Hung Ordnance/Gun Malfunction General Procedures.

14.49.1. (Added) The senior Fire Department official is the on-scene commander. The minimum
number of qualified maintenance personnel required to ensure the aircraft is safe will respond
with required technical data, tools and equipment. The senior 2W1X1 will take charge of the
safing operation and report status to the on-scene commander and the MOC. Aircraft will not
return to parking areas until the aircraft is safe. GSUs will use local or host base guidance.

14.49.1.1. (Added) Aircraft with a hung rocket (TP, SP, WP, M257) will stop in the South EOR
Spot 8 for dearm. Tower will ensure the south Perimeter Road traffic light is on (red) just prior to
touchdown of the aircraft. If the aircraft can be safed, aircraft will taxi to parking spot. If not,
shut down in EOR and declare a ground emergency. The Security Forces Squadron will be
responsible for blocking traffic on Perimeter Road. Once the aircraft is safed, maintenance will
tow the aircraft to parking. Pilots will not declare an IFE unless an unsafe condition exists.

14.49.1.2. (Added) For hung free fall inert ordnance, pilots will proceed to de-arm. If the aircraft
can be safed, aircraft will taxi to parking spot. If not, shut down in EOR. If bomb mechanical
safing pins cannot be installed, 2W1X1 maintenance personnel will download the bomb IAW
applicable TOs. Once the aircraft is safed, maintenance will tow the aircraft to
parking spot. Pilots will only declare an IFE for an unsafe indication.

14.49.2. (Added) For all hung live ordnance (high explosive rockets, general purpose bombs,
LUU flares), pilots will declare an IFE and proceed directly to the gun berm at the Hot Cargo
Pad or the alternate hot gun pad see Attachment 27 (Added-23 WG), Moody AFB Gun Berm
Locations. If the aircraft can be safed, aircraft will taxi to parking spot. If not, shut down in place
and declare a ground emergency. If bomb mechanical safing pins cannot be installed, 2W1X1
maintenance personnel will download the bomb IAW applicable TOs. The Security Forces
Squadron will be responsible for blocking traffic on Perimeter Road. Once the aircraft is safed,
maintenance will tow the aircraft to parking.

14.49.3. (Added) A-10C aircraft with suspected gun malfunctions will declare an IFE and taxi to
the gun berm or alternate hot gun pad. If able to safe the gun and there is no evidence of
damaged 30mm rounds, aircraft will taxi to parking spot. If gun cannot be safed, shut down in
place and declare a ground emergency. The Security Forces Squadron will be responsible for
blocking traffic on Perimeter Road. Once the aircraft is safed, maintenance will tow the aircraft
to parking spot. A gun that cannot be cleared of all live rounds may be removed and turned over
to EOD for destruction.

14.49.4. (Added) HH-60s with a hung gun will normally land at the gun berm area on the Hot
Cargo Pad until the gun can be safed or removed from the aircraft. The Security Forces Squadron
will be responsible for blocking traffic on Perimeter Road. A gun that cannot be cleared of all
live rounds may be turned over to EOD for destruction.

14.49.5. (Added) HH-60/HC-130 Hung Chaff/Flares (AN/ALE-47): After final landing of
training involving the live firing of chaff/flare, aircrews will taxi to EOR, “GOLF,”
“FOXTROT,” “ECHO,” “BRAVO,” or “ALPHA” to deplane the loadmaster or another qualified
crewmember to check for hung ordnance. A chaff/flare squib that fails to fire is NOT considered
hung ordnance. A chaff/flare will be considered hung when protruding from the canister. If hung
ordnance is found, the aircrew and aircraft will remain in place, notify the Tower and Command
Post, and declare a ground emergency. Command Post will notify MOC and have CES/CEF,
AMXS/ECM and EOD meet the aircraft. The aircraft must remain in the designated safe area
until ECM/EOD personnel can clear all hung ordnance. HH-60s may conduct hung ordnance
checks at Grand Bay.

14.49.6. (Added) Transient aircraft with hung ordnance/gun malfunctions will follow Moody
AFB procedures. If the aircraft cannot be safed, Weapons Standardization personnel must be
notified and will safe the aircraft.
14.50. (Added) Incident/Accident Reporting.

14.50.1. (Added) This section establishes procedures and assigns responsibility for completing
and routing Incident/Accident Reports. Guidance applies to all maintenance organizations
assigned to 23 MXG, to include tenant units.

14.50.2. (Added) Units possessing equipment or personnel involved in an incident will
immediately report the occurrence to the Maintenance Operations Center (MOC). If incident
occurs while TDY, the senior maintenance person will ensure that home-station MOC is notified.

14.50.3. (Added) MOC will immediately notify QA of all in-flight and ground emergencies,
precautionary landings, accidents, and maintenance related incidents both on and off station.

14.50.4. (Added) Incident/accident reports will be completed for any type of incident resulting in
damage to or loss of equipment, injury to personnel due to equipment failure or technical data
deficiencies. For other incidents QA will determine if a report is required as directed by the
MXG/CC or designated representative.

14.50.5. (Added) QA will conduct an investigation, take photos if necessary, and obtain
written/oral statements from personnel/supervision involved as needed if a report is deemed
necessary.

14.50.5.1. (Added) After completing the initial investigation, assign a control number, complete
all applicable blocks of the Incident/Accident Report, prepare a PowerPoint presentation (if
photos are taken) and forward preliminary report, PowerPoint, and statements to MXG/MXQ,
Wing Safety, senior MXG leadership, and applicable organization’s leadership (to include
AFETS). Upload report to local QA Share Point.

14.50.5.2. (Added) Follow-up with units for applicable repair costs as needed to complete report
and forward completed report to MXG/MXQ, Wing Safety, and senior MXG leadership.

14.50.5.3. (Added) If the damage is estimated to total $20,000 or more, QA will annotate the
mishap category, class, and initial cost estimate following the guidance in AFI 91-204.

14.50.6. (Added) Unit Maintenance Operations Officer/Supervision will ensure unit provides
complete and accurate information to QA for the report to include the following:

14.50.6.1. (Added) Initial cost estimate for repair/replacement of affected equipment (DIFM
items will reflect exchange cost) and cost/number of man-hours expended for the repair.

14.51. (Added) Repeat/Recur/Could Not Duplicate (CND) Discrepancies.

14.51.1. (Added) A repeat discrepancy is a malfunction that occurs on the next sortie or
attempted sortie after corrective action has been taken to repair said malfunction. A recurring
discrepancy is one that occurs on the second through fourth sortie or attempted sortie after
corrective action has been taken. A CND discrepancy is a malfunction that cannot be duplicated
during troubleshooting.

14.51.2. (Added) Maintenance Procedures: Use the following procedures when performing
maintenance on repeat/recur/CND discrepancies.

14.51.2.1. (Added) Prior to maintenance being performed on a repeat or recurring discrepancy,
system technicians will research the malfunctioning system’s history to include previous
discrepancies and corrective actions prior to the last repair.

14.51.2.2. (Added) CND conditions will be reported as such. When the malfunction cannot be
duplicated, report the discrepancy as a CND and accurately report the completed maintenance
actions (i.e., removed/reinstalled, suspected program glitch, reprogrammed, etc.).

14.51.2.3. (Added) In some cases technicians will be unable to recreate in-flight conditions
necessary to induce failure. In these cases an in-flight operational check (IFOC) is recommended
and may require maintenance personnel to fly with the aircraft so they may see the discrepancy
in-flight (HH-60s/C-130s only). Document the request for an IFOC in the next open AFTO Form
781A discrepancy block (proper documentation will inform the aircrew of a potential system
malfunction). Failed IFOCs will not be counted as repeat or recur discrepancies.

14.51.3. (Added) Forms Documentation: The lowest level of authority for clearing a
repeat/recur/CND discrepancy is a 7-level technician authorized to clear repeat/recur/CND
discrepancies for the affected system. Once maintenance is complete the technician performing
the work will document the aircraft forms IAW TO 00-20-1; then the 7-level technician will
review the aircraft forms and, if they approve the corrective action, sign the “inspected by” block
and initial the symbol. If the authorized 7-level is the technician performing the maintenance,
then only the “corrected by” block signature may be required.

14.51.3.1. (Added) All repeat/recur/CND discrepancies which are “Safety of Flight” or any
repeat/recur discrepancy that occurs a third time will have a documented AMU/HMU
OIC/Superintendent aircraft forms review after all maintenance actions are completed. The
review will be documented on a Red Dash and read “MAINTENANCE SUPERVISION
REVIEW REQUIRED FOR REPEAT/RECUR/CND DISCREPANCY.”

14.51.4. (Added) Bad Actor Policy. A component is defined as a Bad Actor if it has either three
consecutive benched checked “serviceable” (BCS) and/or maintenance not validated (MNV)
actions for the same or similar discrepancy within a 180-day period or has a history of related
failures that indicate a latent, unidentifiable defect.

14.51.4.1. (Added) Anytime a component is processed for repair and/or bench check, and no
repair/adjustment is required; the technician will have another qualified technician verify that no
repair/adjustment action is needed.

14.51.4.2. (Added) Once a component has been identified as a Bad Actor/CND LRU, a report
will be initiated by the intermediate repair facility (IRF) and sent back to the AMU/HMU that
turned it in for repair. The report will include: nomenclature, part #, serial #, JCN, doc #,
discrepancy, test(s) performed, bench checked by/date, and verified by/date. Any other pertinent
information should be included. As appropriate, the IRF will contact the Product Improvement
