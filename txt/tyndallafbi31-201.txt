This instruction implements AFPD 31-2, Law Enforcement. It establishes curfew policy
affecting all military family members and guests under 18 years of age on Tyndall AFB. The
intent of this instruction is to prevent the loitering of minors in off-limits areas on Tyndall AFB
and reduce the amount of juvenile related activity after hours. It is not intended to target those
minors under the supervision of competent authority, on their property in base housing, attending
major base events, or returning from off-base activities to their residence on base. Individuals
who appear to be under the age of 18 who are driving require a second count of probable cause
before being stopped for violating this instruction. Refer recommended changes and questions
about this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF Form 847,
Recommendation for Change of Publication; route AF Form 847s from the field through the
appropriate functional chain of command. This publication may be supplemented at any level,
but all direct Supplements must be routed to the OPR of this publication for coordination prior to
certification and approval. It applies to individuals at all levels who prepare, manage, review,
certify, approve, disseminate and/or use official Air Force publications and forms, including Air
Force Reserve Command (AFRC) and Air National Guard (ANG) units, except where noted
otherwise. Ensure all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are
maintained in accordance with AFMAN 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in
accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) at

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

Minor changes were made from the previous edition.
1. PROCEDURES:
 2                                                   TYNDALLAFBI31-201 1 AUGUST 2011


     1.1. Family members and guests under 18 may not loiter, play, drive, walk or wander on any
     part of Tyndall AFB between the hours of:
        1.1.1. 2200 - 0500, Sunday through Thursday (year-round)
        1.1.2. 0100 - 0500, Friday, Saturday, and evenings before legal holidays
     1.2. Military sponsors, parents, or other adult must escort children under 18 after curfew
     hours.
2. EXCEPTIONS:
     2.1. Military sponsors may request an exemption for a family member if the youth’s
     employment or other special activity causes him/her to be out after curfew. Requests for
     exemptions must be approved by 325 MSG/CC or 325 MSG/DD in the attached format.
     Juveniles must carry exemption letters on their person when out after curfew.
     2.2. Curfew hours may be extended or waived by the 325 MSG/CC or 325 MSG/DD for
     special events. These extensions should be published in the base bulletin or newspaper.
3. VIOLATIONS OF CURFEW: Security Forces will detain curfew violators and accomplish
an incident report, which will be forwarded to the military sponsor’s commander. Sponsors will
be notified to respond to the Security Forces Control Center and receive custody of their family
member. In the event the sponsor or parent cannot be contacted, the sponsor’s first sergeant or
commander will be notified and asked to receive custody of the youth. Juveniles passing
through the installation on US Hwy 98 are exempt from this instruction; however, they do fall
under F.S.S. 322.16(2)(3) for curfew. If any civilian juvenile is detained under the Florida
curfew law, an incident report will be accomplished and the juvenile’s parent or guardian will be
contacted and asked to receive custody of the youth.
