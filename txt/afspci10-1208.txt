                                             Chapter 1

         SPACELIFT OVERVIEW AND MISSION ASSURANCE DEFINITIONS

1.1. Overview:
   1.1.1. United States Government space policies identify “assured access to space” as the
   need to guarantee the availability of critical space capabilities for executing space missions.
   This key concept supports and implements National Security Strategy, United States Space
   Transportation Policy, National Military Strategy, National Space Policy and Air Force (AF)
   doctrine. These policies indicate assured mission capability for critical space systems can be
   achieved only through assured and protected access to space.
   1.1.2. US Space Transportation Policy (National Security Presidential Directive: NSPD-40)
   directs the Secretary of Defense, as launch agent, to maintain the capacity to evolve and
   support the space transportation systems, infrastructure, and support activities necessary to
   meet national security requirements. Department of Defense Directive (DoDD) 5101.2, DoD
   Executive Agent for Space, designates the Secretary of the AF as the DoD executive agent
   for space. Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 3100.12, Space Support, allocates
   responsibility for National Security Space (NSS) transportation including launch to the AF.
   The AF executes launch and range operations through AFSPC. Thus, AFSPC’s space lift
   mission is to ensure successful and safe delivery of space systems to support national
   objectives and provide a decisive advantage to US forces worldwide.
   1.1.3. Space lift is a key enabler that establishes and supports a broad range of space
   capabilities. Space lift includes two complementary strategies: current routine launch
   operations and future responsive launch operations. The US uses routine launches to
   populate satellite constellations on a scheduled basis and will develop responsive launch
   operations, or on-demand launch capabilities, to support more time-critical space support
   operations. Routine launches are planned in advance and executed within the Space Launch
   Manifest, a product of the Current Launch Schedule Review Board (CLSRB) process.
   Routine launch is predominantly used to deploy and sustain force enhancement
   constellations, but is also used to support, deploy, or advance a variety of research and
   development and other test missions.
1.2. Definitions:
   1.2.1. Space lift Mission Assurance (SMA).
       1.2.1.1. SMA is a command responsibility and authority, exercised through a series of
       processes for ensuring safe and successful space lift missions. SMA includes flight
       worthiness, public safety, range operations and base operating support.
   1.2.2. Flight Worthiness Certification.
       1.2.2.1. Flight Worthiness Certification: Certification made by a responsible launch
       agency to the launch wing commander, acting on behalf of the AFSPC/CC, which
       ensures the launch agency has confidence that launch vehicle, spacecraft, and launch
       agency ground system risks have been resolved, or are known and deemed acceptable.
       Launch Agencies arrive at a flight worthiness certification, and the subsequent
6                                                           AFSPCI10-1208 1 OCTOBER 2008


       recommendation to the launch wing commander, through use of launch vehicle mission
       assurance (LVMA) and space vehicle mission assurance (SVMA).
       1.2.2.2. LVMA is a technical and management process rigorously, continuously, and
       iteratively employed over the life-cycle of a launch system (mission conception to space
       vehicle separation) to maximize mission success. LVMA encompasses system
       engineering, risk management, quality assurance, and program management by an
       experienced, stable launch agency team. LVMA is achieved through integrated
       developmental processes and/or independent technical assessment and requires
       expenditures commensurate with the criticality of the mission and the consequences of
       failure.
       1.2.2.3. SVMA is a technical and management process rigorously, continuously, and
       iteratively employed over a space vehicle until it successfully separates from a launch
       system in its intended orbit. SVMA encompasses system engineering, risk management,
       quality assurance, and program management by an experienced, stable space vehicle
       agency team. SVMA is achieved through integrated developmental processes and/or
       independent technical assessment and requires expenditures commensurate with the
       criticality of the mission and consequences of failure.
    1.2.3. Public Safety.
       1.2.3.1. Safety involving risks to the general public of the United States or foreign
       countries and/or their property.
    1.2.4. Range Operations.
       1.2.4.1. Any procedure that requires the use of range resources (instrumentation,
       collision avoidance, weather, etc). The execution of operations focused on efficient and
       coordinated employment of all range assets and processes to enable the safe and timely
       launch of payloads and test vehicles.
    1.2.5. Base Operating Support.
       1.2.5.1. Base operating support includes traditional installation support elements such as
       security, fire protection, disaster control, etc., required to provide, protect, and maintain
       facilities and supporting infrastructure.
AFSPCI10-1208 1 OCTOBER 2008                                                                    7


                                           Chapter 2

                                 SPACELIFT OPERATIONS

2.1. Mission Assurance Responsibilities:
   2.1.1. The AFSPC/CC is responsible for SMA for all launches from the Eastern Range (ER)
   and Western Range (WR). The AFSPC/CC delegates public safety, range operations, and
   base operating support elements of SMA to the 14 AF/CC, who in turn delegates them to the
   launch wing commanders. AFSPC/CC exercises responsibility for the flight worthiness
   certification element of SMA through either SMC/CC or the launch wing commander
   depending on the category of space lift mission, as outlined in paragraph 2.2 and Table 2.1.
2.2. Flight Worthiness Certification Responsibilities:
   2.2.1. All launch agencies operating on the ER and WR will provide a flight worthiness
   certification acceptable to the wing commander prior to initiating DoL activities. For the
   purpose of flight worthiness certification, launch agencies fall under one of three categories:
   (1) DoD missions launching SMC-procured spacecraft on SMC-procured launch vehicles; (2)
   NRO missions launching NRO-procured spacecraft on SMC-procured launch vehicles; (3)
   All other civil, and commercial (both FAA licensed and non-FAA licensed) procured
   missions not addressed in the previous two categories.
   2.2.2. Flight Worthiness Certification Process:
       2.2.2.1. For Category 1 missions, AFSPC/CC delegates flight worthiness certification
       authority to the SMC/CC. The SMC/CC will certify flight worthiness for DoD missions
       launching SMC-procured spacecraft on SMC-procured launch vehicles. AFSPC/CC
       authorizes DIRLAUTH between applicable SMC systems wings and 14 AF launch wings
       to allow launch base support for accomplishing flight worthiness certification tasks. The
       wing commander will normally receive the SMC Mission Director (MD) flight
       worthiness certification during the commander’s launch readiness review (LRR).
       2.2.2.2. For Category 2 missions, DNRO (or designated representative) will certify
       flight worthiness for NRO missions launching NRO-procured spacecraft on SMC-
       procured launch vehicles. The SMC/CC will certify LV flight worthiness to DNRO as
       part of the DNRO’s mission certification. The wing commander will normally receive
       the NRO’s flight worthiness certification during the commander’s LRR.
       2.2.2.3. For Category 3 missions, launch agencies will perform flight worthiness
       certification processes. However, those processes will be sufficiently robust and
       acceptable to provide the launch wing commander a sufficient level of confidence that
       launch vehicle performance presents an acceptable risk to public safety and launch base
       infrastructure and security. The wing commander will normally receive the launch
       agency’s flight worthiness certification during the commander’s LRR.

2.3. General Responsibilities.
     2.3.1. AFSPC operates the Launch and Test Range System (LTRS) on the Eastern Range
     (ER) and Western Range (WR) to meet launch agency requirements and ensure public safety
     and safe passage of vehicles to, through and from space. The primary responsibilities of the
     ER and WR are outlined in DoDI 3100.12, Space Support. In addition, the ranges provide
     Test and Evaluation support to DoD activities IAW DoDD 3200.11, Major Range and Test
     Facility Base. This support includes ballistic missile testing and aeronautical flight testing.
     Per this guidance, range facilities are sized, operated, and maintained primarily for DoD
     operational and test missions, but are also available to all authorized users having a valid
     requirement for their capabilities. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) licensed launch
     and test support is conducted IAW Title 49 United States Code (USC) §70101 et. seq.,
     Commercial Space Launch Activity (CSLA), as amended and Title 14 CFR, Chapter III,
     Commercial Space Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration, Department of
     Transportation. The AF supports FAA-licensed operations at AFSPC ranges IAW DoDD
     3230.3, DoD Support for Commercial Space Launch Activities. Activities not associated
     with FAA-licensed spacelift operations may qualify for support under Title 10 USC 2681,
AFSPCI10-1208 1 OCTOBER 2008                                                                   9


  Use of Test and Evaluation Installations by Commercial Entities, as implemented by
  DoDD 3200.11.
  2.3.2. While non-FAA-licensed activities are conducted on the range, National and DoD
  policy encourage the development of FAA-licensed launch operations within the US private
  sector. The CSLA encourages federal agencies to support FAA-licensed launch activities
  with use of launch property or launch services that are in excess or otherwise not needed for
  government use. Cooperative involvement between 30 SW and 45 SW with FAA-licensed
  activities helps maintain the competitiveness of the US space industrial base in the world
  economy and promotes our national strength in space. AFSPC retains public safety and
  resource protection responsibilities for all activities on Vandenberg Air Force Base and Cape
  Canaveral Air Force Station. NASA is responsible for flight consequences to people
  (including workforce and visitors) on Kennedy Space Center (KSC) IAW 45 SW 15E-2-8,
  Memorandum of Agreement Between the 45 Space Wing, NASA’s John F. Kennedy
  Space Center (NASA-KSC), and the Space Shuttle Program Office (NASA SPO) for Range
  Safety. For FAA-licensed launches, the FAA remains statutorily responsible for public
  health and safety, the safety of property, and national security or foreign policy interests of
  the United States under the CSLA. Additionally, the FAA-licensed company conducting the
  launch also retains responsibility for public safety of any launch it conducts from an AF
  range. Regardless of the type of activity (including FAA-licensed launches), AFSPC/CC,
  through his/her launch wing commanders, is responsible for the launch operation.
  2.3.3. Support for Civil Space lift consists of support to NASA and the NOAA as defined in
  US Space Transportation Policy (NSPD-40) and AF Policy (AF Policy Directive: AFPD 10-
  12, Space). The AF will launch payloads for the DoD and other government agencies to
  meet mission requirements.
  2.3.4. The DoL chain of command is similar in construct to a task force in that several
  organizations are placed under the temporary authority of the LDA, normally the SW/CC, for
  the purpose of executing DoL activities. Request for support from Commander, Joint
  Functional Component Command for Space (CDR JFCC Space) assigned forces (i.e., 2nd
  Space Warning Squadron, 22nd Space Operations Squadron, etc.) should be made to the CDR
  JFCC Space NLT 60 days prior to launch.
  2.3.5. AFSPC must maintain a successful, robust, secure, and modern space lift capability to
  meet war fighter and other national security mission needs. All echelons within AFSPC must
  strive to meet this basic requirement at an affordable cost.
  2.3.6. All launch and range operations employ contracted, non-DoD personnel. To ensure
  proper mission conduct and contractor compliance, AF personnel should understand
  government rights and responsibilities embodied in contracts and their provisions. A general
  understanding of the contract between the AF and the contractor is of particular importance
  for commanders and mission personnel. Individuals seeking guidance on contracts should
  contact the cognizant government contracting office.
  2.3.7. Safety is paramount in all aspects of launch and range operations and involves
  following regulatory guidance as well as meeting safety requirements detailed in operations
  directives, instructions, manuals, plans, and procedures. All personnel must comply with
  applicable technical, procedural, safety, security, and resource protection requirements,
  instructions, and directives. These include AFSPCI 91-701, Launch Safety Program Policy,
 10                                                        AFSPCI10-1208 1 OCTOBER 2008


   AFSPCMAN 91-711, Launch Safety Requirements for AFSPC Organizations, and
   AFSPCMAN 91-710, Range Safety User Requirements.
   2.3.8. Mission success requires experience, effective training and certification programs,
   workforce management, and technical excellence. Organizations and personnel will comply
   with all applicable training, evaluation, crew force management, and civilian personnel
   instructions, directives, requirements, and supplements. These include AFMAN 36-2234,
   Instructional System Development, AFH 36-2235V11, Information for Designers of
   Instructional Systems Application to Unit Training, AFI 36-2201V3, Air Force Training
   Program on the Job Training Administration, AFI 63-1201, Life Cycle Systems
   Engineering, AFSPCI 10-1202, Crew Operations, and AFSPCI 36-2202, Mission Ready
   Training, Evaluation and Standardization Programs, AFSPCI 21-202V2, Space Launch
   Maintenance Roles and Responsibilities, and applicable Career Field Education and
   Training Plans (CFETP).
2.4. Exception to National Space Policy Regarding Orbital Debris Mitigation.
   2.4.1. National Space Policy granted approval authority for violations of the United States
   Government (USG) Orbital Debris Mitigation Standard Practices (ODMSP) criteria to the
   head of the sponsoring department or agency. For AFSPC missions, this is the Secretary of
   Defense (SECDEF). With the understanding that there are missions already in the
   configuration, planning, or execution phases that will require an exception to the ODMSP,
   the following guidance is provided to clarify roles, responsibilities and procedures for orbital
   debris exception requests.
   2.4.2. Exception requests are required for all AFSPC missions that do not comply with the
   ODMSP. For missions where AFSPC is responsible for providing the launch service to other
   agencies (e.g., National Reconniassance Office (NRO), U.S. Navy, Missile Defense Agency),
   the Air Force is responsible for the LV exception request. NRO will manage SV exceptions
   within their channels, NASA will manage exception requests for their missions, and AFSPC
   will not enforce National Space Policy compliance on non-AFSPC missions (e.g., Federal
   Aviation Administration-licensed commercial launches, AF Research Lab space vehicles,
   Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency projects, etc.).
   2.4.3. Exception requests to National Space Policy for violations of USG ODMSP are
   separate and in addition to the Space Debris Assessment Report (SDAR) process, described
   in AFI 91-217, Space Safety and Mishap Prevention Program.
   2.4.4. All National Space Policy orbital debris exception requests for AFSPC-procured LVs
   and SVs will be developed by the respective Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC)
   system program office as early as feasible in the acquisition process, and at a minimum will
   be coordinated with Center-level engineering and safety offices. Using the USG ODMSP,
   the program office will provide a concise overview and analysis of orbital debris standard
   practices the LV and/or SV will not meet, to include an explanation of why compliance
   cannot be achieved and a brief summary of the mitigation measured used. The SMC
   Commander (SMC/CC), Vice Commander (SMC/CV) or Executive Director (SMC/CD) will
   review and endorse each exception request. SMC will then forward the exception request to
   the 14th Air Force Commander (14 AF/CC) or Vice Commander (14 AF/CV) for
   endorsement prior to delivery to HQ AFSPC/A3SR.
AFSPCI10-1208 1 OCTOBER 2008                                                                11


   2.4.5. The flow chart in Figure 2.1. depicts the exception request staffing requirements, to
   include the timeline required for SECDEF review and approval. HQ AFSPC/A3SR requires
   delivery of exception requests 114 days prior to the approved mission launch date for
   coordination.

Terms
Acceptance—Government acceptance of the results of a contractor-executed test procedure or
task and acceptance of close-out/disposition of all anomalies or out-of-family/out-of-spec data
associated with that procedure or task. AFSPC/A3 will be the operations acceptance authority
for all systems unless delegated down. Prior to operations acceptance, operational testing will be
accomplished IAW AFI 99-103 and AFSPCI 99-103. Acceptance takes on two forms: One is an
acceptance of items/processes/procedures as required by the contract; the other is technical
acceptance that the contractor’s actions have adequately resolved any anomalies/non-
conformances and satisfies Flight/Task Certification Matrix requirements.
Annual—When used as a requirement, the term “annual” refers to a 12-month interval.
Anomaly—An unexpected or unplanned condition that does not meet provided system
performance parameters and which cannot be corrected by organizational maintenance resources
in accordance with validated procedures. After analysis, an “out-of-family” condition could be
declared an anomaly.
Anomaly Resolution—The process to resolve an anomaly. An anomaly resolution team will be
formed to resolve/disposition all system anomalies. This team may consist of AFSPC,
contractors, and any other personnel needed to resolve the anomaly.
Approval—Approval signifies AFSPC approval/acceptance/coordination                   IAW     AFSPC
instructions and Memorandum of Agreements.
Base Operating Support—Base operating support includes traditional installation support
elements such as security, fire protection, disaster control, etc., required to provide, protect, and
maintain facilities and supporting infrastructure.
Current Launch Schedule (CLS)—The CLS is a fiscal-year-based, 48-month projection of
launches from the ER and WR, approved by the 14 AF/CC at the CLSRB. It includes the
Executable Launch Schedule. The first two years of the CLS are provided via standard report
from LISN. The latter two years are used for operational planning purposes.
Current Launch Schedule Review Board (CLSRB)—A semi-annual forum chaired by 14
AF/CC and attended by senior officers, program managers and commercial representatives from
the launch community. The purpose of the CLSRB is to review resource, satellite and launch
assessments, prioritize launches and approve the CLS.
Data Review—Government review of all data, resulting from completion of a contractor-
executed test procedure or task, required for government acceptance of that test procedure or
task. Data from contractor-run tests and procedures will be reviewed by SMC Systems
Directorates, SLS, and/or AFQA according to the Flight Certification Matrix. This data review

is to ensure the test/procedure produced the desired results, to identify any anomaly/non-
conformances, and to develop trend data.
Direct Liaison Authorized (DIRLAUTH)—That authority granted by a commander (any level)
to a subordinate to directly consult or coordinate an action with a command or agency within or
outside of the granting command. Direct liaison authorized is a coordination relationship, not an
authority through which command may be exercised.
Direct Support—Provide a comprehensive, structured, support process to bring workable
systems to the customers. Maximize support of HQ functions to promote operational and
administrative effectiveness.
Discrepancy—An unexpected or unplanned condition that does not meet system performance
parameters but which can be corrected by organizational maintenance resources in accordance
with validated procedures at the unit level.
EELV Launch Service—Space Launch capability provided by a contractor to place a satellite
into a specified orbit. The contractor retains ownership of all flight and ground hardware,
engineering analyses, processes, and readiness decisions except as provided under contract.
Flight Hardware—All physical elements of the spacelift systems that lift off, in contrast to
those space system elements that remain on the ground.
Flight Readiness—Assessment of the ability of the entire launch system [LV/SV, critical
facilities/infrastructure, range systems, and Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE)] to meet the
current launch schedule.
Flight Readiness Review (FRR)—Provides SMC/CC with hardware and software mission
status for the LV, the satellite, and/or critical ground systems, as well as associated interfaces.
Required for all missions where the SMC/CC is responsible for the certification of the mission,
LV, satellite or critical ground system, and FRR is presented to the SMC/CC or a designated
representative. The briefing takes place following SV and LV integration.
Flight Worthiness—Measures the degree to which a spacecraft, LV, or critical ground system,
as constituted, has the capability to perform its mission with the confidence that significant risks
are known and deemed acceptable. Flight worthiness certification is granted for the "system as
constituted" at the FRR (for SMC) based on a best assessment that the system will perform as
expected throughout its lifecycle.
Insight—Government surveillance/analysis of contractor activities/engineering associated with
delivery of a launch service. Contractor retains all cost control (via contract) and liabilities for
mission success.
Job Order Number (JON)—A unique number assigned to an account that a contractor and the
government uses to charge program-related expenses (including labor and materials).
Launch Mishap—A mishap occurring during launch vehicle operations, including upper stages.
This includes payloads that do not obtain the intended orbit, re-contact of the payload with the
upper stage/launch vehicle, or collisions before completion of the initial drift orbit, and flight
safety system failures.
Launch Processing—Launch site performance of engineering, test operations,
processing/integration, and maintenance tasks associated with flight hardware/software, ground
AFSPCI10-1208 1 OCTOBER 2008                                                                   45


support equipment (GSE), and infrastructure to prepare the integrated stack (consisting of the
LV, upper stage, and satellite) for space launch.
Launch Readiness Review (LRR)—Assessment of both the ability to meet the mission design
requirements and the current launch schedule based on the sum of flight worthiness and flight
readiness.
Launch Vehicle Mission Assurance (LVMA)—LVMA is technical and management process
rigorously, continuously, and iteratively employed over the life-cycle of a launch system
(mission conception to space vehicle separation) to maximize mission success. LVMA
encompasses system engineering, risk management, quality assurance, and program management
by an experienced, stable launch agency team. LVMA is achieved through integrated
developmental processes and/or independent technical assessment and requires expenditures
commensurate with the criticality of the mission and the consequences of failure.
Mission Assurance—An integrated engineering-level assessment of analysis, production,
verification, validation, operation, maintenance, and problem resolution processes performed
over the life cycle of a program by which an operator/user determines that there is an acceptable
level of risk to employment of a system or end item to deliver an intended capability in an
intended environment. The objective of the assurance process is to identify and mitigate design,
production, test and operational deficiencies that could impact mission success.
Mission Failure—For any reason the satellite does not achieve the specified final orbit in the
mission specific Interface Control Document or is not able to reach an operational status.
Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB)—The designated core set of DoD Test and
Evaluation (T&E) infrastructure and associated workforce that must be preserved as a national
asset to provide T&E capability to support the DoD acquisition system.
Observation—Direct government observation of the execution and recording (if applicable) of a
test procedure or task. An “Observed” test procedure or task is one in which all steps (or certain
pre-defined steps) have been completed, all anomalies have been noted (with appropriate
documentation generated), and all applicable data captured while being observed by a
government representative. Observed test procedures or tasks are typically those that must be
accomplished correctly, cannot be easily verified by data review or post-test, and include a high
risk of inducing collateral damage that could remain undetected.
Oversight—Government surveillance/analysis and control of contractor activities/engineering
associated with delivery of a launch service. Government assumes liabilities for costs and
mission success.
Public Safety—Safety involving risks to the general public of the United States or foreign
countries and/or their property (both on and off-base); includes the safety of the people and
property that are not involved in supporting a launch along with those that may be within the
boundary of the launch site.
Range Operations—Any procedure that requires the use of range resources (instrumentation,
collision avoidance, weather, etc). The execution of operations focused on efficient and
coordinated employment of all range assets and processes to enable the safe and timely launch of
payloads and test vehicles.

Resource Protection—The protection of Air Force flight hardware, facilities, support
equipment, or other property from damage due to mishaps.
Risk Assessment—Actions conducted for mission assurance purposes to: (1) identify and
capture risk items from procedure review and process observation; (2) assign a technical risk
level to each item; and (3) track each item through resolution/mitigation steps to acceptance or
closure.
Space Vehicle Mission Assurance (SVMA)—SVMA is a technical and management process
rigorously, continuously, and iteratively employed over the space vehicle life cycle, i.e. all
activities associated with the development, testing and operation of space vehicles in orbit or
deep space, to include spacecraft design, orbital operations, reentry, recovery and disposal
elements. SVMA encompasses system engineering, risk management, quality assurance, and
program management by an experienced, stable space vehicle agency team. SVMA is achieved
through integrated developmental processes and/or independent technical assessment and
requires expenditures commensurate with the criticality of the mission and consequences of
failure.
Spacelift—The ability to project power by transporting people and materiel to and/or through
space, to include test launches and sub-orbital missions. This includes the deployment,
sustainment, and augmentation of satellite constellations by delivering space systems to the
required orbit.
Spacelift/Launch Operations—Actions conducted by USAF/contractor personnel at the launch
base to control and execute spacelift including test launches (i.e. conduct
insight/oversight/assessment of launch processing/handling from receipt of hardware through
launch, launch countdown, countdown simulations, integrated systems verifications, dress
rehearsals, etc.).

                           FREQUENCY MITIGATION PROCESS

WARNING: The following information will be classified SECRET:.
     Dates of approved mitigation or verifying that a request for mitigation has been
     granted for a particular launch.
        Questions regarding this warning should be directed to AFSPC/A3FM, DSN
        692-3789/6207

NOTE: This AFSPCI is directive only to AFSPC units. However, launches from other ranges
must work through the appropriate lead range to submit mitigation requests to the Joint A6.3.
Space Operations Center (JSpOC) in the same manner..
STEP 1. 30/45 SW identifies any launch requiring mitigation based on their own criteria and
notifies the appropriate Range Operations and Launch Squadron at least 4 weeks prior to
scheduled launch date.
STEP 2. 30/45 SW Range Operations notifies JSpOC Strategy Division and Combat Plans
Division of potential conflict with at least 3 weeks notice using secure email or telephone at:
         jspoc.strategy@afspc.af.smil.mil
         jspoc.combatplans@afspc.smil.mil
         Commercial: (805) 606 9841 or DSN: 276 9841
STEP 3. JSpOC Combat Plans Division confirms with appropriate Space Warning Squadron
that mitigation procedures are possible for the circumstances of that particular launch then seeks
Commander Joint Functional Component Command for Space (CDR JFCC-SPACE) approval
for an entry in the Joint Space Tasking Order (JSTO). The JSTO directs mitigation procedures
and authorizes Direct Liaison Authorized (DIRLAUTH) between the range and the Space
Warning Squadron (SWS) concerned.
STEP 4. Range Operations and SWS agree on local procedures to check for real-time
verification of mitigation during the countdown and notify the Radar operator quickly when
mission is complete or mitigation is no longer required.

STEP 5. If launch scrubs: Range advises the SWS, JSpOC Combat Ops, and JSpOC Combat
Plans of the new launch date/time. Process repeats beginning with step 3.
