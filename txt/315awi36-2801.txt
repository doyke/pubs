        how many First Sergeant packages can be submitted. The success of this program
        depends a great deal on the degree of enthusiasm and personal support from each
        commander and supervisor. This recognition program can be an effective tool for
        enhancing unit morale, career motivation and retention of personnel.

           1.2.3.1. Prepare congratulatory memorandums to winners for the 315 AW
           Commander’s signature, and prepare the memorandum for distribution to all wing
           members recognizing the winners.
           1.2.3.2. Furnish names of those selected to the 315 AW Public Affairs (PA) Office
           and the Charleston AFB Chiefs’ Group as soon as practical.
           1.2.3.3. Procure the appropriate plaques and contact 315 AMXS Support Section for

               squadron, group and wing CCs for approval for each unit, group, and annual
               award recipient and CCE staff forwards to 437 MSS/DPCE. Supervisor ensures
               the following certification statement is included on the staff summary sheet for
               time-off award;
“I have considered fully the wage costs and productivity loss in granting this time-off award.
The amount of time off granted is commensurate with the individual’s contribution or
accomplishment. I also considered the unit’s workload and unit employee’s leave projections
and certify that the employee can schedule the time off in addition to other scheduled leave. I
also considered other available forms of recognition in determining the amount of this time-off
award (Ref: AFI 36-1004).”
