1. Responsibilities.
    1.1. The 30th Space Wing Safety Office (30 SW/SE) will determine the requirement for the closure
    and evacuation of parks and access roads.
    1.2. The 30th Space Wing Launch Safety office (30 SW/SEL) will notify the 2d Range Operations
    Squadron Scheduling Office (2 ROPS/DOS) at least 15 days in advance of the requirement to close
    and reopen parks and access roads.
    1.3. When the Launch Support Team (LST) arrives on station, they will notify the 30th Security
    Forces Squadron (30 SFS) on status of closures and evacuation and will receive updates until the oper-
    ation is complete.
    1.4. The Mission Flight Control Officer (MFCO) will:
       1.4.1. Identify hazardous areas both on and off base.
       1.4.2. Ensure the hazard area’s specifications are current, and will monitor for any activity which
       may dictate change.
       1.4.3. Ensure the 30th Space Wing Commander (30 SW/CC) is fully briefed prior to emergency
       evacuation of off-base areas.
    1.5. The Airspace and Offshore Management Section (2 ROPS/DON) will:
       1.5.1. Provide the initial notification to Security Operations (30 SFS/S3SS) of evacuation require-
       ments, the need to close or re-open roads, and any additional road closures as deemed necessary
       by 30 SW/SEL.
30SWI13-206 28 MARCH 2007                                                                              3


      1.5.2. Prior to a launch operation, notify the Aerospace Control Officer (ACO) of the requirement
      for park and road evacuation. 2 ROPS/DOS will provide the scheduling information.
   1.6. 30 SFS will:
      1.6.1. Initiate or cancel actions for notification to the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office and
      to the North County Parks Department of required park and road closures.
      1.6.2. Make an initial notification of the closure action to the offices listed in Attachment 2 at
      least seven days prior to execution.
      1.6.3. Administer operational requirements in the agreements with the park rangers and the Santa
      Barbara County Sheriff.

2. Closure and Evacuation.
   2.1. Jalama Beach Park, Ocean Park (including access roads) and Point Sal will be closed and evacu-
   ated when necessitated by approved safety and operational criteria for certain range operations.
   Actions required for closure and evacuation will be accomplished by the 30 SFS through direction
   provided by the 30th Operations Group Commander (30 OG/CC), or designee.
   2.2. 30 SFS will coordinate with the Santa Barbara County Sheriff and park rangers no later than
   seven days in advance of operations requiring the evacuation of the three parks and roads. A schedule
   of events (Attachment 1) for park and road closures and evacuations will be prepared with the help of
   the park rangers and the Santa Barbara County Sheriff. Signs at the junction of Highway 1 and Jalama
   Road and at the park entrance may be posted based on the schedule of events. Telephone verification
   of park closure and the evacuation requirements will also be provided to the Santa Barbara County
   Sheriff and park ranger the day before the required action.
   2.3. Short-notice range operations resulting in less than the normal seven-day notification procedure
   are expected to occur on an infrequent basis.
   2.4. Whenever possible, range operations will be scheduled to minimize night and weekend evacua-
   tions of Jalama Beach Park and its access road. According to the Santa Barbara County MOA, only
   visitors to Jalama Beach Park will be evacuated. Permanent residents at the park (the park rangers,
   concessionaires and their families) may remain in the park to provide security. Some missions may
   require evacuation of all persons from Jalama Beach. Total evacuation occurs only when Jalama
   Beach lies within the mission caution corridor. Residents and ranchers along Jalama Road, their
   guests, and ranch hands may also be allowed access and egress through the roadblock.

3. Procedures.
   3.1. At the direction of 2 ROPS, the 30 SFS will:
      3.1.1. Direct all closure and evacuation actions for off-base parks and road closures.
      3.1.2. Prepare the Schedule of Events (Attachment 1) in conjunction with the park rangers and
      the Santa Barbara County Sheriff at the substation in Vandenberg Village or, in the event Vanden-
      berg Village substation is not manned, the Buellton substation. After coordination with the Santa
      Barbara County Sheriff, 30 SFS will notify 2 ROPS of the actions taken.
4                                                                     30SWI13-206 28 MARCH 2007


       3.1.3. When required, request the park ranger to post Jalama Beach Park closure signs (Attach-
       ment 3) at the park entrance and at the junction of Highway 1 and Jalama Road (Attachment 4).
       These signs provide advance public notice of the park closure.
       3.1.4. Provide a 24-hour telephone number for coordination in the event of an operation slip or
       reschedule.
       3.1.5. Coordinate funding and billing of support by the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office for
       launch activities only. The Job Order Number (JON) must be provided to 30 SFS by 2 ROPS/
       DON.
       3.1.6. One week prior to closing parks and roads, confirm schedule with 2 ROPS /DOS, advise
       the offices listed in Attachment 2 of the plan to close and evacuate parks and roads along with the
       time the park will be closed. In the event of "Short Notice" (less than seven days) operations,
       ensure the same procedure is followed.
       3.1.7. 24 hours prior to the operation, confirm the times on the Schedule of Events (Attachment
       1) with the park ranger and the Santa Barbara County Sheriff at Vandenberg Village.
       3.1.8. Reconfirm the time with the park ranger and the Santa Barbara County Sheriff (see para-
       graph A1.2.3., Attachment 1); additionally, confirm the start of roadblock and Jalama Beach and
       Ocean Park evacuation procedures. Notify the park ranger and the Santa Barbara County Sheriff
       of any schedule changes. Lastly, notify the Launch Support Team of the start of the evacuation.
       3.1.9. By T-1 hour, confirm with the Santa Barbara County Sheriff the completion of the evacua-
       tion. Notify the LST.
       3.1.10. Notify the park rangers and the Santa Barbara County Sheriff of the completion of range
       operations, and acknowledge the resumption of normal operations. 2 ROPS/DOS will notify 30
       SFS/S3SS of all changes to operational support times and dates, reschedules, and completions.
    3.2. The Launch Support Team (LST) will:
       3.2.1. Confirm with 30 SFS that evacuation is complete by T-1 hour.
       3.2.2. At T-1 hour, inform the Mission Flight Control Officer (MFCO) the status of evacuations.

4. Short-Notice Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Support.
    4.1. Hazard areas may include off-base areas. To provide personnel safety and maintain security, a
    contingency procedure for evacuation has been coordinated with the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s
    Office in Vandenberg Village (the Buellton substation in the event Vandenberg Village substation is
    not manned). The map (Attachment 5) indicates potential evacuation areas. A code indicator for
    evacuation assistance has been pre-arranged with the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office to enable
    the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s dispatcher to call units in the area by radio.
    4.2. The 30 SW will treat all hazardous operations (launch or non-launch) the same to avoid compro-
    mise of classified information.
    4.3. In some instances, the MFCO will notify the LST of those areas which require evacuation. The
    MFCO will request evacuation of off-base areas for which the Air Force has current legal arrange-
    ments. Table 1. identifies off base evacuation areas. The MFCO may also request the evacuation of
    Miguelito Canyon Road.

        4.6.1. Upon determining that evacuation measures are necessary, the LST will call 30 SFS Secu-
        rity Forces Control Center (SFCC), who will request assistance from the Santa Barbara County
        Sheriff’s Office representative as follows:
           4.6.1.1. Identification of caller (30 SFS).
           4.6.1.2. Request an "eleven eighty-four Victor Adam" (11 84 Victor Adam).

        4.6.2. The Santa Barbara County Sheriff will report evacuation completion to the SFCC, which
        will in turn notify the LST on the required telephone extension. They will pass evacuation start,
        progress, and completion times to the MFCO and ROC. The 30 SFS will also notify Command
        Post.
        4.6.3. SFCC will call the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s office to terminate the "eleven
        eighty-four Victor Adam" at a designated time. A copy of this "short notice" procedure and map

A2.1. Evacuation of Jalama Beach, Ocean Park, and Point Sal interferes with public use of county facili-
ties and sometimes triggers complaints (phone calls, letters or visits) to the 30 SW. These complaints can
be handled with greater facility if commanders and public affairs offices are aware of the park evacuation
measures required for personnel safety during test operations. When park evacuation measures are taken,
SFCC will notify 30 SW Command Post (CP). 30 SW/CP will then notify:
    A2.1.1. 30 SW/CC      6-1318
    A2.1.2. 30 OG/CC      6-1265
    A2.1.3. 30 MSG/CC 6-8700
    A2.1.4. 30 SW/PA      6-3595
