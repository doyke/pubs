This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 21-1, Managing Aerospace Equipment
Maintenance. It also establishes procedures for the Dropped Object Prevention Program (DOPP). It is
applicable to all maintenance/operations personnel assigned to the 908th Airlift Wing (908 AW) in order
to ensure dropped objects are identified and reported. Refer recommended changes and questions about
this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF Form 847 Recommendation
for Change of Publication as prescribed by AFI 11-215, USAF Flight Manual Program (FMP). Route AF
Form 847 to the 908 MXG/MXG at Maxwell AFB AL. Ensure that all records created as a result of pro-
cesses prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN)
37-123 (will convert to AFMAN 33-363), Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with
the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at https://afrims.amc.af.mil/.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This revision updates all references to AFI 21-101 to read AFI 21-101 _AFRC_I, Aircraft and Equipment
Maintenance Management. Paragraph 1.1. is deleted due to AFI 21-101 _AFRC_I, Aircraft and Equip-
ment Maintenance Management, stating that the WG/CV will serve as the Dropped Object Program Man-
ager. The Dropped Object Monitor appointment is changed from the senior Aircraft Maintenance
Craftsman to any Aircraft Maintenance Craftsman (paragraph 1.2.). The 22AF office symbol is changed
from LGMA to A4M in paragraph 3.11. and 3.2. A bar ( | ) indicates revisions from the previous addition.


1. Responsibilities:
   1.1. Deleted.
   1.2. An Aircraft Maintenance Craftsman (AFSC 2A571) assigned to the Quality Assurance Office
   (MXQ) will serve as the Dropped Object Monitor and MXQ will be the investigating office for the
   Dropped Object Prevention Program. MXQ will immediately investigate reports of aircraft parts or
2                                                                  908AWI21-104 4 SEPEMBER 2007


    objects that have dropped from an aircraft in an effort to identify the cause. Ensure a Product Quality
    Deficiency Report (PQDR) is submitted.
    1.3. Maintenance or aircrew personnel will ensure that if an object is missing from the aircraft at
    Home-station the Maintenance Operations Center (MOC) is notified immediately.
    1.4. Aircrew and/or maintenance personnel who observe or discover that an object is missing from an
    aircraft will make appropriate entries in the Aircraft 781 Form, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work
    Document (immediately upon landing). The reporting process is also implemented immediately
    beginning with the Aircrew, and continuing with the Debriefer and/or Crew Chief, Expediter, MOC,
    Command Post (if not notified earlier), Maintenance Quality Assurance (MXQ), Base Safety, and the
    Airfield Manager.
    1.5. Any maintenance or aircrew member having knowledge of an object that inadvertently fell from
    an aircraft will notify the Expediter or Production Supervisor who in turn will notify the MOC of a
    possible Dropped Object condition.
    1.6. An impoundment may be warranted when an item has been dropped from an aircraft. Refer to
    AFI 21-101 _AFRC_I, Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance Management, and 908 MOI 21-19 Air-
    craft/Equipment Impoundment, for Impoundment Procedures.

2. Prevention Procedures :
    2.1. Ensure the Aircraft 781 forms are documented prior to removal and/or installation of aircraft
    components per TO 00-20-1, Aerospace Equipment Maintenance Inspection, Documentation, Poli-
    cies, and Procedures.
    2.2. Individuals must ensure aircraft parts fit properly. Check serviceability of the hardware (i.e. nut
    plates or attaching devices). Also, ensure all panels, doors and cowlings are fastened upon completion
    of a task.
    2.3. Prior to the first flight of the day, accomplish a complete panel inspection and document the
    inspection in the aircraft AFTO Form 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document.
    2.4. Special attention must be given to last minute maintenance actions to ensure proper documenta-
    tion is accomplished for the actions completed.
    2.5. Special care must be taken to ensure correct type fasteners, nut plates and latching devices are
    used.

3. MXQ Reporting Procedures.
    3.1. Report to 22 AF/A4M Weapon System Manager immediately by telephone or e-mail whenever a
    dropped object incident occurs. Also, notify the Wing Safety Office.
    3.2. A Formal Report must be sent to 22 AF/A4M no later than three duty days after the incident.
    3.3. Maintain Dropped Object Reports for 2 years and will be located in the Quality Assurance Office
    file plan Table 21-09, Rule 02.00, Item 20-D.

4. Report Format. See Attachment 2, Dropped Object Format Report Worksheet for proper report for-
matting.

   ery of a lost/missing panel or other aircraft component following flight.
   7.2. Maintenance supervisors must ensure individuals are trained and understand the importance in
   proper documentation of the Aircraft 781 Forms.
   7.3. Every technician must be made aware of reporting procedures for dropped objects. Time con-
