     1.2. DOT - Department of Transportation
     1.3. CFR - Code of Federal Regulations
2. Objectives: The objectives of the Processing of Hazardous Materiel Program are to:
     2.1. Assure compliance with Public Law which states no person may offer or accept
     hazardous materiel for transportation in commerce within the United States unless that
     materiel is properly classed, described, packaged, marked, labeled, and conditioned for
     shipment, as required.
     2.2. Standardize and simplify the data provided to Traffic Management on materiel.
     2.3. Establish a requirement for the technical specialist to accomplish a Keesler AFB Form
     32, Certificate for Shipment, prior to turn-in of hazardous materiel for shipment or for
     storage.
3. Qualification. Personnel most knowledgeable in properly preparing hazardous materiel for
shipment or storage will complete Keesler AFB Form 32. DOD personnel who are qualified as a
result of special training will certify the form. Update authorization letter no longer than every
90 days when changes in personnel occur.
4. Requirement. Accomplish Keesler AFB Form 32 in duplicate and turn in both copies with
item. Retain one copy with the item and the other in 81 LRS/LGRDDC's files.
5. Policy. Prepare Keesler AFB Form 32 for items such as fuel cells, fuel contaminated devices,
internal combustion engines, aircraft and vehicle engines. Indicate if the item has been drained
and purged and identify the tech order under which this was accomplished. Prepare the form for
empty packages, containers, drums, tanks, cylinders, etc., which formerly contained hazardous
materiel. The technician will identify the container as being empty and indicate the materiel it
previously contained.
6. Implementation:
     6.1. Use Keesler AFB Form 32 as a source of information to support the certification
     required by 81 LRS/LGRDDC personnel when the item is packaged, marked, labeled, and
     prepared for shipment via all modes of transportation.
     6.2. Identify regulated/hazardous materiel to the carrier regardless of the mode of
     transportation.

     7.3. Block 3 - Use this block to identify item being turned in. If the item is an empty
     container, indicate the type container. If the item is compressed air or gas, indicate
     compressed air or compressed gas, whichever it may be.
     7.4. Block 4 - Indicate the amount of hazardous materiel.
     7.5. Block 5 - Use this block for item which has a flash point.
