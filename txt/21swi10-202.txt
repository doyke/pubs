Supersedes 21SWI10-202, 1 Oct 2000                                                          Pages: 11
                                                                                      Distribution: F

This instruction establishes the policies and procedures to request, schedule, approve, and cancel activi-
ties for missile warning and space control units in accordance with UI 10-23, Integrated Tactical Warning
Attack Assessment (ITWAA) Procedures and Systems, and UI 10-40, Space Surveillance Operations. It
ensures that scheduled downtimes result in minimal degradation to 21st Space Wing (21 SW) missions.
Individual units will not modify these requirements without prior coordination and approval from the 21st
Space Wing. Send recommended changes to the 21 SW Wing Operations Center (WOC), Combat Plans
Branch, Wing Scheduling Section. Maintain and dispose of records created as a result of prescribed pro-
cesses in accordance with AFMAN 37-139, Records Disposition Schedule (will become AFMAN 33-322
Vol. 4).

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This revision includes numerous administrative changes; expanded section 1.2. to include the 10% limit
and the requirement for the unit to submit a waiver request; revised section 1.2.1. to remove outdated pro-
cedures and included 721 MSG SPADOC 4 system failover procedures; added sections 1.2.2. and 1.2.3.;
expanded section 1.3.; added section 1.3.1. clarifying when a line number extension will be listed as nor-
mal maintenance or corrective maintenance; removed all references to Passive Units; and added section
2.3.4. A bar (|) indicates a revision from the previous edition.


1. POLICY:
   1.1. Operational Downtimes. Unit operational downtimes are authorized for, but not limited to, pre-
   ventive maintenance (PM), hardware/software upgrades, and testing and maintenance training. 21 OG
   units submit their Monthly Maintenance Schedule (MMS) requests and revisions to 21 SW/DOCX.
   External testing agencies requiring support from 21 OG units will have their tests scheduled on the
   MMS, as well as the 721 MSG Tech Control (TC) Test Control Board (TCB) schedule.
2                                                                 21SWI10-202 16 DECEMBER 2003


    1.2. Monthly Maintenance Schedule (MMS). The purpose of the MMS is to schedule preventive
    maintenance (PM), hardware/software upgrades, testing and maintenance, and training downtimes.
    These downtimes are either Operational Capability (OPSCAP) RED, YELLOW, or GREEN. Monthly
    activity requests for the MMS must be received by the 21 SW/DOCX for consolidation no later than
    (NLT) the 15th day, 2 months prior to the month downtime is required. Whenever downtime does not
    meet UI 10-23, missile warning threat requirements, or exceeds the mandated 10% limit of available
    downtime hours, the unit commander will submit a waiver with the downtime request to 21 SW/
    DOCX who includes it with the MMS package for 21 OG/CC approval. Only OPSCAP RED mainte-
    nance/tests count towards the 10% total maintenance limit.
       1.2.1. All foreseeable downtimes expected to exceed 2 minutes must be requested and scheduled
       in the MMS in accordance with this instruction. All requested downtimes will be submitted with
       the appropriate OPSCAP status. To minimize MMS revisions, sites may submit alternate times for
       their requested downtimes. The only exceptions are for the 10 SWS, Cavalier AFS ND, which is
       authorized an AT-1 tape run every other Wednesday between 0600Z and 1300Z for system verifi-
       cation and analysis; and for the 721 MSG to perform SPADOC 4 system failovers to clear the
       SPADOC 4’s system buffers (1 SPCS will notify the 21 SW WOC 30 minutes prior for initial
       approval, then 5 minutes prior for final approval).
       1.2.2. Routine site training is not considered maintenance and as such does not require a sched-
       uled line number. SPADOC 4 “Alternate Routing” and “Normalization” refers to the switching of
       data lines from CMOC to the Alternate in Offutt AFB NE. These procedures are also considered
       training and as such do not require a maintenance line number. 721 MSG will request permission
       to accomplish these actions with an initial request 30 minutes prior to start and a final request 5
       minutes prior to switching the data paths.
       1.2.3. All 21 OG units will request approval to take maintenance/testing line numbers from the
       approving agency, 21 SW WOC (missile and space) or SPACEAF AOC (missile warning).
           1.2.3.1. Missile warning units will request initial approval 30 minutes prior to the start, then
           final approval 5 minutes prior to the start of the planned activity.
           1.2.3.2. 21 SW space surveillance units will request initial approval from 21 SW WOC 30
           minutes prior to the start of the maintenance/testing. 21 SW WOC will then notify 1 SPCS of
           the planned downtime to get concurrence there will be no impact to the space surveillance mis-
           sion. 21 SW WOC will then grant/disapprove the site’s request based on the 1 SPCS recom-
           mendation at the 5 minute final request. Space surveillance units will then call their OPSCAP
           to 21 SW WOC who in turn notifies CMOC via the sensor management conference.
    1.3. Monthly Maintenance Schedule (MMS) Revisions. All 21 OG units (missile warning and
    space) request maintenance/testing revisions through 21 SW/DOCX. 21 SW/DOCX schedules, can-
    cels, or revises downtime and/or testing activities only when requested by the operational unit.
    21 SW/DOCX must receive MMS revision requests NLT 24 hours prior to the scheduled downtime,
    excluding weekends. Requests for downtime submitted within 24 hours (48 hours for requests coming
    in after duty hours on Fridays) of the start time are called into the on-duty 21 SW WOC/SPACEAF
    AOC crew commander/crew chief and are considered on a case-by-case basis. 21 SW WOC,
    SPACEAF AOC, or the unit may cancel scheduled maintenance activities due to mission require-
    ments.
21SWI10-202 16 DECEMBER 2003                                                                               3


     1.3.1. A unit may request a line number extension only if the request is submitted prior to the unit
     entering into the recall time of that line number. These extensions will be granted on a
     case-by-case basis and will continue as normal maintenance/preventive maintenance. If the unit
     requests a line number extension while within the line number’s recall time then the entire main-
     tenance will be transferred and logged as corrective maintenance (CM).

2. RESPONSIBILITIES:
  2.1. 21 OG Units. Units will submit all MMS requests to 21 SW/DOCX using the format shown on
  Attachment 2 and Attachment 3 prior to the 15th day, 2 months prior to the month the request is for.
  Proper format is essential due to the 21 SW database constraints. All scheduling requests will include
  a unit point of contact (POC) with name and associated phone numbers. Scheduling requests sent via
  AUTODIN/Classified DMS will be sent via immediate priority.
     2.1.1. Units will coordinate on external agency Test Objective Worksheets (TOWs) to 21 SW/
     DOCX. As a minimum, units will provide what the test impact to the unit is, unit OPSCAP during
     the test, and whether the unit can support the test. Units will notify 21 SW/DOCX of any discrep-
     ancies or questions regarding the TOW. 21 SW/DOCX will act as interface between the units and
     the tester. 21 OG units will not participate in a test without coordinating on the TOW or without
     having a line number assigned specifically for the test being conducted.
     2.1.2. Units will submit MMS requests for site and external originated testing to 21 SW/DOCX.
     2.1.3. Units will provide rationale for downtime requests that violate the requirements of
     UI 10-23 or UI 10-40. Units will provide 21 SW/DOCX with a detailed description of the
     requested activity, rationale, and operational impact if delayed or not performed. This information
     is essential for successful waiver processing.
     2.1.4. The unit Operations Officer (DO) is the approving authority for unit participation in test
     activities. Each unit will utilize a unit test manager as a POC for all test related inquires. 21 OG
     units will not participate in a test unless a line number is issued.
         2.1.4.1. 721 MSG TCO sends out a weekly test message every Thursday. Units will review
         the message for testing information. Any discrepancies between the 721 MSG TCO message
         and the MMS will be reported to 21 SW/DOCX.
         2.1.4.2. 21 OG units will be prepared to test at the assigned test time. The testing agency will
         contact units NLT 1 hour after assigned test start time. If the tester has not contacted the unit,
         the unit will attempt to contact the tester. If the tester cannot be contacted, the unit will cancel
         the line number for the test with the appropriate command and control agency (21 SW/WOC
         or SPACEAF/AOC).
     2.1.5. Extended Sensor Site Downtime Requests. Sensors will notify 21 SW/DOCX of any
     required extended major downtimes 20 days prior to the start of the requested downtime.
     Extended major downtimes are those downtimes greater than 24-hour duration that affect a site’s
     OPSCAP. This includes the primary, secondary, or tertiary mission of a sensor.
         2.1.5.1. Notification should be made by AUTODIN/Classified DMS message or classified fax
         and will include the following information:
             2.1.5.1.1. Description of Outage.
4                                                                    21SWI10-202 16 DECEMBER 2003


               2.1.5.1.2. Dates/Duration of Outage
               2.1.5.1.3. Reason for Downtime
               2.1.5.1.4. Impact if Downtime is not accomplished.
               2.1.5.1.5. Reason the Downtime was not in Original Monthly Maintenance Schedule
               Request (if applicable).
           2.1.5.2. Failure to provide the required information will result in the delay or denial of
           requested downtimes. Emergency/late requests will be handled on a case-by-case basis.
    2.2. Test Managers. All test control board (TCB) tests involving 21 OG units are scheduled in the
    MMS based on the inputs received from the site’s test manager from the 15th day of the month prior
    to the month being scheduled. Any changes to the TCB schedule after the 15th day will be requested
    by the test OPR to the unit NLT 3 working days prior to the test. Testers will contact units directly for
    all test-related matters. All agencies requesting a Category A or B test will coordinate with the partic-
    ipating units using the TOW NLT 6 weeks prior to the start of test. The TOWs will include all neces-
    sary configuration and site information. Incomplete/inaccurate TOWs will not be accepted. If a TOW
    is updated, testers will submit the updated TOW to the participating units. All unit Operational Test
    and Evaluation (OT&E) generated TOWs will comply with NUI 10-48 (Test Control).
       2.2.1. Test managers will begin testing with 21 OG units at the assigned test time. The testing
       agency will contact units no later than one hour before assigned test start time. If the tester does
       not contact units, they will attempt to contact the tester. If contact is not made, the units will cancel
       the test line number.
    2.3. 21 SW/DOCX. 21 SW/DOCX produces the MMS. 21 SW/DOCX consolidates, prioritizes, and
    processes all requests for scheduled activities. 21 SW/DOCX schedules and de-conflicts requested
    downtimes and submits 21 OG unit waivers for requested outages.
       2.3.1. 21 SW/DOCX distributes the MMS to 21 OG units and applicable users. 21 OG units will
       receive the portion of the MMS affecting their mission and that of their sister site(s).
       2.3.2. 21 SW/DOCX accepts all unit requests for revisions to the MMS that are not within 24
       hours of the maintenance start time then updates the MMS as needed. Requests should be submit-
       ted NLT 1800Z (1900Z during day light savings time) the day prior to the required outage. Late
       and/or urgent requests will be handled on a case-by-case basis.
       2.3.3. 21 SW/DOCX attends the weekly 721 MSG TCB meetings to ensure continuity between
       unit requested downtimes and scheduled Category A and B tests. All testing downtime requests
       not originating at the unit will be scheduled by 21 SW/DOCX.
           2.3.3.1. 21 OG Units have 5 working days from receipt of TOW to complete coordination and
           provide comments to the testing agency.
           2.3.3.2. 21 SW/DOCX schedules Cat A and B testing based on the unit’s request for down-
           time. Unit MMS requests are deconflicted based upon wing priorities. If a change to the TCB
           schedule is requested, the test OPR notifies the applicable unit NLT 3 days prior of test start
           date.
           2.3.3.3. 21 SW/DOCX holds a monthly scheduling meeting with all external agencies
           requesting scheduled downtime in the MMS. These meetings focus on the long range planning
