OPR: 1 SOW/A5O                                           Certified by: 1 SOW/A5 (Lt Col Todd Kratzke)
Supersedes HFI 10-404, 15 April 2005                                                       Pages: 13

This instruction implements AFSOCI 10-403 Special Operations Support Planning. It defines the 1st
Special Operations Wing (1 SOW) scheduling and force apportionment process for non-contingency sup-
port requests. It establishes procedures and responsibilities for requesting mission support and scheduling
wing assets. This instruction does not apply to local unit training sorties.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This instruction updates and refines mission support request procedures (paragraph 4.), the wing schedul-
ing cycle (paragraph 5.), 1 SOW Form 1 procedures (paragraph 6.); updates Commit Calendar database
codes for aircraft (Attachment 3), and deletes the requirement for a Short Notice Scheduling Request
Letter.

1. General.
   1.1. Purpose. The scheduling process identifies valid support requests, ensures that wing training
   objectives and user needs are satisfied, and ensures that a sustainable operations tempo is maintained.
   The goal is to enable coordination throughout the wing for efficient and effective asset allocation and
   early commitment deconfliction.
   1.2. Support Requests. Demands for support far exceed the capability of the resources assigned to the
   wing. These missions are tasked on an established priority basis; therefore outside agencies must sub-
   mit support requests on a timely basis.
   1.3. Wing Scheduling. Wing Operations Scheduling, 1 SOW/A5OS, is the single point of contact for
   agencies to request support. Taskings originate from various sources but will eventually all flow to
   A5OS. A5OS reviews all support requests, prioritizes them per Wing Commander guidance, and
   develops support recommendations in coordination with Unit Planning Representatives (UPRs).
   Issues and conflicts are identified by A5OS and presented at the weekly scheduling meetings to the
2                                                   HURLBURTFIELDI10-404 15 DECEMBER 2007


    Group and Wing leadership for resolution. A5OS manages the scheduling process and produces the
    consolidated wing schedule also known as the Commit Calendar database.

2. Commander’s Guidance. All requests will be approved or disapproved by the 1 SOW/CC, or his des-
ignated alternate, based on mission priorities and unit training requirements.

3. Commit Calendar.
    3.1. Commit Database. The Commit Calendar database is a comprehensive database that provides
    wing leadership an overview of all known commitments. A5OS updates the database as the status of
    requests change. The Commit Calendar database is available to all agencies within the wing via hard
    copy, electronic copy, or through the base Non-Secure Internet Protocol Routing Network (NIPR-
    NET). Classified missions are tracked on the Secure Internet Protocol Routing Network (SIPRNET)
    version of the calendar. For viewing instructions, see Attachment 2. The Commit Calendar database
    is also part of the AFSOC Web Applications Suite and can be accessed at: https://webapps.hurl-
    burt.af.mil/AfsocApps/Default.html.
    3.2. Database Changes. 1 SOW/A5OS is the OPR for changes to the scheduling database. Forward
    recommended changes and improvements to 1 SOW/A5OS.

4. Mission Support Request Procedures.
    4.1. Types of Requests Covered. Submit all requests IAW procedures in this section. Informal coor-
    dination is encouraged at all levels, but an informal agreement is not a substitute for the normal sched-
    uling process.
    4.2. Request Deadline. All Mission Support Requests will be submitted to 1 SOW/A5OS no later
    than seven days before the first date of execution. Missions submitted within seven days of execu-
    tion must follow the procedures in paragraph 4.4. and 6.3.).
    4.3. Request Submission Guidance. Submit mission support requests to 1 SOW/A5OS on SOCOM
    Form 111, USSOCOM Mission Support Request (See Attachment 3), unless another procedure is pre-
    scribed below. 1 SOW/A5OS will enter all requests in the commit database as In Coordination
    (“InCrd”) unless noted otherwise. Submit requests via the following offices:
       4.3.1. Air Asset Allocation Conference (AAAC) missions are submitted by 1 SOW/A5Q and
       enter the commit database as Pending (“PEND”). AAAC missions do not require a SOCOM Form
       111 since they have already been approved by the 1 SOW/CC through the AAAC process.
       4.3.2. Joint Air Asset Allocation Conference (JAAAC) missions are staffed through USSOCOM
       and HQ AFSOC to 1 SOW/A5OS.
       4.3.3. Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) exercise, JFCOM exercise, Joint Combined Exchange Training
       (JCET), Counter Narcotics Training (CNT), and Coalition Special Operations Forces Subject
       Matter Expert Exchange (CSOF SMEE) support requests are staffed through HQ AFSOC/A3Y
       and submitted by 1 SOW/A5Y.
       4.3.4. All Requests for aircraft tests, trial installations, Time Compliance Technical Order
       (TCTO) verifications/validations, kit proofing, and other HHQ directed maintenance activities are
       submitted by HQ AFSOC via an HQ AFSOC Form 5, HQ AFSOC Aircraft Support Request.

      4.3.5. Submit external Distinguished Visitor support requests to MAJCOM current operations
      (AFSOF AOC/CODO).
      4.3.6. Submit external Static Display support requests to MAJCOM current operations (AFSOF
      AOC/CODO).
      4.3.7. Submit external unit visit requests to MAJCOM current operations (AFSOF AOC/CODO).
      4.3.8. Hurlburt Field tenant units (i.e. Weapons Instructor School, Special Tactics, Joint Special
      Operations University, etc.) submit support requests to HQ AFSOC.
      4.3.9. 1 SOW agencies submit all support requests directly to 1 SOW/A5OS.
   4.4. Short Notice Requests. A mission support request within seven days of execution will be consid-
   ered a short notice request. 1 SOW/A5OS will enter the request into the Commit database and the
   review process will occur immediately via telephone and email. If a Form 1 is required, the instruc-
   tions in paragraph 6.3. will be followed.
   4.5. Base Support Requests. Hurlburt Field units hosting off-station aircraft conducting training at
   Hurlburt Field and/or that require support above and beyond transient alert services must coordinate
   their base support requests through 1 SOLRS/LGRR (DSN: 579-3415). Transient aircrew conducting
   tactical operations in the local flying area must receive a local area orientation briefing from Group
   Tactics (1 SOG/OGK, DSN: 579-2925). Base support requests will be forwarded to 1 SOW/ A5OS
   (DSN: 579-3645) for wing oversight/tracking and inclusion on the Commit Calendar as required. 1
   SOLRS and 1 SOW/A5OS will coordinate the request with all affected base agencies and 1 SOW/
   A5OS will present requests for final approval to the WG/CC at the Wing Scheduling Meeting (WSM).

5. Wing Scheduling Cycle.
   5.1. Weekly Coordination Timeline. The Wing Scheduling Cycle is Wednesday to Wednesday.
      5.1.1. Support Request Cutoff. Wednesday at 1630L is the cutoff for Mission Support Requests to
      be considered in the new cycle. Short notice requests (within seven days of execution) will be
      coordinated as per paragraph 4.4. 1 SOW/A5OS will perform an initial review of all new requests,
      resolve conflicts, and enter all potentially supportable missions into the Commit database as
      “InCrd” or “PEND.”
      5.1.2. Wing Operations (A5O) External Scheduling Meeting. On Thursday at 1000L, 1 SOW/
      A5O will chair the Wing Operations External Scheduling Meeting. Attendees include representa-
      tives from the following organizations: AFSOF AOC/CODO, 1 SOMSG, 1 SOSS/ OSO, 1 SOSS/
      OSM, 1 SOG flying squadrons, 1 SOMOS/MXOOP, 25 IS, 1 SOSFS, and 1 SOCONS. The pur-
      pose of the meeting is to distribute new support requests and review all “PEND,” “InCrd,” and
      “2InCrd” requests. Attending UPRs will identify mission commanders, squadron planners, train-
      ing priorities, windows of availability, LIMFACS, and shortfalls. The meeting will review the
      next three months on the Commit Calendar. On the last Thursday of each month, A5OS will
      review the next six months on the Commit Calendar.
      5.1.3. Wing Operations (A5O) Internal Scheduling Meeting. On Tuesdays at 1000L, 1 SOW/
      A5O will perform an initial review of all requests in preparation for the 1 SOG/SOMXG Schedul-
      ing Meeting. The meeting is chaired by 1 SOW/A5O. Attendees will be A5OS, A5Q and A5Y.

       5.1.4. SOG/SOMXG Scheduling Meeting. On Tuesday at 1530L, the SOG/SOMXG Scheduling
       Meeting is held in the 1 SOG conference room. It is chaired by 1 SOG/CC, or his designated alter-
       nate, and facilitated by 1 SOW/A5OS. Attendees include the 1 SOMXG/CD, flying squadron
       operations officers or their designated representative, 1 SOMOS, and maintenance plans and
       scheduling (SOMOS/MXOOP) personnel. The purpose of the meeting is to review mission sup-
       port requests that are in coordination. If the SOG and SOMXG support a request, the mission will
       go “Tasked.” If it is not supported, the mission will go “UNSP” or will be modified per SOG/
       SOMXG guidance. In order to provide a timely response to requestors and stabilize the scheduling
       process, “InCrd” missions will normally be reviewed only twice before going unsupported. The
       SOG will identify “PEND” requests ready to go “Tasked.” The meeting will review the next three
       months on the Commit Calendar. On the first Tuesday of each month, the next six months of the
       Commit Calendar will be reviewed.
       5.1.5. Wing Scheduling Meeting (WSM). On Wednesday at 1500L, the WSM is chaired by the
       Wing or Vice Wing Commander and facilitated by A5OS in the Wing Conference Room (WCR).
       Attendees include the Operations and Maintenance Group Commanders, and flying and mainte-
       nance squadron commanders, or their designated representatives. A5OS will brief currently tasked
       missions, outstanding pending missions, and unsupported requests, and identify unresolved issues
       for the Commander. Group Commanders will make recommendations to the Wing Commander
       and the status of a mission support request will be changed as required based on 1 SOW/CC direc-
       tion. In addition, coordinated Forms 1 will be presented for signature.
    5.2. Other Meetings.
       5.2.1. Wing Engagement Briefing. This meeting is held the first Wednesday of every month, or as
       directed by the Wing Commander. It is normally conducted immediately after the WSM in the
       WCR and facilitated by the Chief of Wing Plans (A5). Attendees include senior wing leadership,
       flying squadron commanders, and maintenance squadron commanders, or their designated repre-
       sentatives. 1 SOW/A5 briefs the Wing Commander on theater engagement plans, provides a
       six-month outlook, identifies conflicts, and provides exercise update briefings as required. The
       Wing Commander will provide guidance and direction for resolving issues.

6. 1 SOW Form 1, Execution Order and Executive Summary.
    6.1. A 1 SOW/CC signed 1 SOW Form 1 constitutes an approved execution order and represents
    launch authority. The Form 1 also serves as an executive summary for wing leadership. The mission
    commander should obtain a signed copy of the Form 1 prior to mission departure. A Form 1 is
    required for all missions not terminating at Hurlburt, Eglin, Duke or Crestview, as well as for missions
    originating outside the local area. Unless otherwise directed, the unit with the preponderance of air
    assets executing the mission is required to complete the Form 1. Back-to-back off-station missions
    can be combined on a single Form 1 as long as the aircraft does not return to Hurlburt Field or Eglin
    AFB enroute from one mission to another. A Form 1 is not required for out and backs or CONUS
    TDYs involving only personnel. A Form 1 is required for all OCONUS missions involving personnel.
    The 1 SOW/CC is the Form 1 approval authority for all OCONUS missions involving personnel if the
    mission consists of an operational activity or exercise. The appropriate group commander (Wg/CC for
    Wing Staff Agencies) is the Form 1 approval authority for personnel going TDY OCONUS to a plan-
    ning conference, training event, site survey, etc. Once signed, the original Form 1 will be maintained
HURLBURTFIELDI10-404 15 DECEMBER 2007                                                                      5


   by 1 SOW/A5OS, a copy will be provided to the Wing Operations Center (WOC), and a copy will be
   maintained by the OPR for that particular mission.
       6.1.1. Force Protection. For 6 SOS missions involving personnel only, the 6 SOS will accomplish
       the force protection (FP) section of the Form 1. For all other missions requiring a Form 1, Wing
       FP will accomplish the force protection section of the form. Regardless, unit commanders are
       responsible for confirming Force Protection assessment requirements have been met.
       6.1.2. Personnel Accountability. If a DD Form 1610, Request and Authorization For TDY Travel
       of DoD Personnel, is accomplished personnel are required to submit a copy of their travel orders
       to their unit orderly room prior to departure so that their duty status and location can be updated in
       the Military Personnel Data System (MilPDS). If this is not accomplished, then visibility on
       off-station personnel is lost.
   6.2. Procedures. See Attachment 2, Commit Calendar & Form 1 Computer Access, for access
   instructions.
       6.2.1. The Form 1 is available for completion on the AFSOC Web Applications Suite once 1
       SOW/A5OS enters the mission request into the wing commit database. The USSOCOM Form 111
       provides the data used by A5OS to setup the shell of the Form 1. If any pre-printed data needs
       changing, the OPR must notify A5OS to make changes.
       6.2.2. The MC/OPR will complete the form and check the “MC/OPR Review” block no later than
       21 days prior to departure (or immediately if inside 21 days). A mission does not need to be
       tasked before completion of the Form 1. Checking the “MC/OPR Review” block sends the
       Form 1 to Force Protection (FP) for review.
       6.2.3. After the FP review, 1 SOSS/OSO checks the Form 1 for accuracy and validates the infor-
       mation. Once 1 SOSS/OSO reviews it, the Form 1 is locked to prevent further updates. Any
       changes must be coordinated with 1 SOSS/OSO to unlock the form. After any changes, the review
       process starts over at FP review. This lock ensures each group commander (or designated repre-
       sentative) endorses the same plan.
       6.2.4. 1 SOW/A5OS will coordinate the Form 1 with the groups as required and obtain 1 SOW/
       CC/CV signature at the weekly WSM. A signed copy will be provided to the WOC.
   6.3. Late Support Requests. If a short notice request requires a Form 1 for mission execution, unless
   otherwise directed, the unit with the preponderance of air assets executing the mission will staff the
   Form 1 for 1 SOW/CC signature prior to aircraft departure. Once signed, the original Form 1 will be
   provided to 1 SOW/A5OS, a copy will be provided to the WOC, and a copy will be maintained by the
   MC for that particular mission.
   6.4. Disposition Instructions. 1 SOW/A5OS will maintain and dispose of the original signed Form 1's
   in accordance with AFMAN 37-139 / AFI 33-338, Records Disposition Schedule.

A3.2. STAT - Current status of the event.
     A3.2.1. In Coordination (InCrd). This is the status used for most missions when entered into the data-
     base. It means the groups are considering the mission. They have neither agreed to support the mission
     nor turned it down at this point.
     A3.2.2. Second In Coordination (2InCrd). This is the status used for a mission held in InCrd status
     past the first week of 1 SOG/SOMXG consideration. The mission should be declared Tasked or
     Unsupported at the next 1 SOG/SOMXG Scheduling meeting.
     A3.2.3. Pending (PEND). The 1 SOG and 1 SOMXG intend to support the request. Planners are
     authorized to proceed with detailed mission planning and coordination. PEND requests will normally
     be addressed 60 days prior to execution.
     A3.2.4. Tasked (TSKD). The WG/CC, or as delegated, has approved the mission. This usually occurs
     at the SOG/SOMXG or Wing Scheduling Meeting. If time constraints require it, a mission may be
     briefed to the 1 SOG/CC or WG/CC outside the normal meeting cycle.
     A3.2.5. Unsupported (UNSP). The request was received, considered, and not supported.
     A3.2.6. Cancelled (CNX). The requestor canceled the request.
