                         THE FEDERAL EQUAL OPPORTUNITY (EO) DISCRIMINATION
                                COMPLAINT PROCESS FOR THE AIR FORCE
                          INTELLIGENCE, SURVEILLANCE AND RECONNAISSANCE
                                          AGENCY (AFISRA)

Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, prohibits employment discrimination based on race, color, national origin, age (over
40), religion, sex (includes sexual harassment), genetic information, physical or mental disability, as well as reprisal or retaliation against a
person who files a complaint or participates in the Equal Opportunity (EO) process.

Aggrieved Air Force employees and applicants for employment, including appropriated and non-appropriated fund activities, and employees
covered by agreement serviced by the AFISRA have the right to file a discrimination complaint with this agency.

The process operates under the authority of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), and is regulated by Title 29 Code of
Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 1614, (Federal Sector Equal Employment Opportunity), EEOC Management Directive 110 (Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission), and AFI 36-2706 (Equal Opportunity Program Military and Civilian). Two main steps,
informal/pre-complaint and formal, comprise the discrimination complaint administrative process.

                                           ALTERNATE DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESS
The Alternate Dispute Resolution (ADR) Program attempts to resolve employment disputes in the workplace. Different styles of ADR (e.g.,
mediation, facilitation) offer opportunities for early resolution at both the informal and formal complaint stages. AFI 51-1201, Alternative
Dispute Resolution Processes in Workplace Disputes.

                                                  INFORMAL COMPLAINT PROCESS
Complainant must contact an EO counselor within 45 days of the alleged discriminatory act, or in the case of a personnel action, within 45
days of the effective date of the action.

IAW EEOC MD 110, aggrieved persons must seek a resolution of the dispute at the lowest possible level, unless he/she elects to participate
in ADR.

Informal counseling is normally completed within 30 days of the initial contact. When counseling is completed, the EO counselor conducts a
final interview. If the complaint has not been resolved by this time, the EO counselor advises the complainant of his or her right to file a
formal complaint.

The complainant has the right to be represented throughout the entire complaint process and to remain anonymous throughout the informal
stage.

                                                    FORMAL COMPLAINT PROCESS
Formal complaints must be filed in writing, preferably on DD Form 2655, Complaint of Discrimination in the Federal Government, within
15 days after receipt of the notice of final counseling interview.

Formal complaints must be detailed and specific as to dates and events that were previously discussed with the EO counselor. The
complaint, itself, must be signed by the complainant or the complainantâ€™s attorney.

Formal complaints must be filed with AFISRA/EO or AFISRA/CC.
