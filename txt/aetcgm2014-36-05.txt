MEMORANDUM FOR DISTRIBUTION

FROM: AETC/CC
      1 F Street, Suite 1
      JBSA Randolph TX 78150-4324

SUBJECT: AETC Guidance Memorandum for Equal Opportunity

RELEASABILITY: There are no releasability restrictions on this publication.

1. By Order of the Commander, Air Education and Training Command, this AETC Guidance
Memorandum immediately implements changes to AETCVA 36-2; AETC Policy on Equal
Opportunity (EO) (dated 17 Jun 2011). Compliance with this memorandum is mandatory. To
the extent its directions are inconsistent with other Air Force publications, the information herein
prevails, in accordance with AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management.

2. Fair and equal treatment of our workforce is critical to building trust, teamwork, and combat
readiness. All Air Force members - military and civilian - should treat each other with mutual
respect and dignity in accordance with our core values. I expect leaders and supervisors to
maintain a nondiscriminatory climate and enforce the rules against discrimination where our
personnel work and serve.

3. All employees must have the opportunity to compete on a fair and level playing field. EO
covers all management practices, decisions, and personnel programs such as recruitment,
promotions, awards, training, discipline, and performance management. Accordingly, Airmen -
military and civilian - will not discriminate against, harass, intimidate or threaten another
person on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetic
information, or their prior EO activity. Sexual harassment includes unwelcome sexual
advances, requests for sexual favors or other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature
when submission to such conduct is made directly or indirectly a term or condition of
employment, or submission to or rejection of such conduct is used as a basis for an
employment decision affecting the person. Harassment and/or the creation of an intimidating,
hostile working environment based on a memberâ€™s race, color, religion, sex, national origin,
age, disability, or genetic information is illegal. Additionally, retaliation against any Airman
who engaged or participated in the EO process is unlawful and will not be tolerated.

4. Our EO charter is straight forward: "Zero tolerance for unlawful discrimination." The Air
Force is committed to this basic principle and I expect all members of the First Command to join
in this effort.
5. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are
maintained IAW Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of
IAW Air Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition
Schedule (RDS).

6. If you have any questions about this policy, please contact HQ AETC/A1KQ at DSN 487-
7733.

7. This memorandum becomes void after one-year has elapsed from the date of this
memorandum, or upon publication of an Interim Change or rewrite of the affected publication,
whichever is earlier.
