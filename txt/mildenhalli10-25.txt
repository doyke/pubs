   4.3.1. The Civil Engineer Readiness Flight will publish and distribute an annual training calendar.
   The calendar will be amended as required and published in the Team Mildenhall Emergency Manage-
   ment Newsletter.
   4.3.2. The Civil Engineer Readiness Flight will scan and post a copy of the sign in rosters on its web-
   site and shared drive each training week.
   4.3.3. Scheduled individuals who fail to attend training will be considered no-shows/non-utilizations.
   The applicable unit commander will receive official notification of no-shows/non-utilizations from
   the Base Civil Engineer or Civil Engineer Readiness Flight Commander at the end of each month.
   4.3.4. CBRN DT:
       4.3.4.1. The Civil Engineer Readiness Flight will send a message on the first duty day of each
       month requesting EM Representatives/Unit Schedulers provide desired training allocations for the
       following month.
       4.3.4.2. EM Representatives or Unit Schedulers will send training allocation requests to the Civil
       Engineer Squadron Readiness Flight within 3 duty days from the time the notification was sent.
       Requests received after the suspense date will be allocated available seats until class capacity is
       exhausted.
       4.3.4.3. CBRN DT Refresher Classes at minimum will contain 10 people, but no more than 25.
       CBRN DT Initial Classes have no minimum, but no more than 25 people.
       4.3.4.4. If a unit requests an allocation but is unable to fill it, they must cancel 2 duty days prior to
       class. Failure to meet this deadline will result in an unused allocation.
       4.3.4.5. Unit Schedulers will ensure that Explosive Ordnance Reconnaissance (EOR) training is
       completed NET 60 days prior to attending the CBRN DT course.
           4.3.4.5.1. The primary method for EOR Training Course completion is using the learning
           management system (LMS) on the internet at https://golearn.csd.disa.mil/.

        their respective EM Representative or Unit Scheduler.
        4.3.4.7. Personnel will not wear contact lenses while attending CBRN DT. This is a safety hazard
        and any personnel found to be wearing contacts will be asked to remove them. If unable, the mem-
        ber will then be turned away and will reschedule training through their respective EM Representa-
        tive or Unit Scheduler.
        4.3.4.8. At the end of each month the Base Civil Engineer or Readiness Flight Commander will
        send CBRN DT utilization statistics to group and unit commanders reflecting their respective
        unit(s) utilization percentage. Team Mildenhall’s goal is for all units to utilize 100% of their
        requested allocations.
        4.3.4.9. The 100 CES/CEX will conduct quarterly CBRN DT Unit Scheduler meetings.
     4.3.5. HAZMAT Awareness Level Training:
