                                           Chapter 1

                                   GENERAL GUIDANCE

1.1. General. This instruction, in conjunction with other governing directives, prescribes
procedures for operating F-22A aircraft under most circumstances. It is not a substitute for sound
judgment. Procedures not specifically addressed may be accomplished if they enhance safe and
effective mission accomplishment.
    1.1.1. Deviations. Deviations from these procedures require specific waiver unless an
    urgent requirement or an aircraft emergency dictate otherwise. In that case, the pilot in
    command will take the appropriate action to safely recover the aircraft.
    1.1.2. Supplements. Develop supplements IAW AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms
    Management.
1.2. Waivers. Forward waiver requests through appropriate channels to the applicable
MAJCOM/A3 or equivalent, or COMAFFOR for those aircrew and assets under the
COMAFFOR’s oversight, for approval. The COMAFFOR will notify HQ ACC/A3 of waivers
within 72 hours of issuance.
1.3. Processing Changes.
    1.3.1. Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication through to the
    Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) via AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of
    Publication, using procedures in AFI 11-215, USAF Flight Manuals Program (FMP) and
    any supplements to AFI 11-215.
    1.3.2. HQ ACC/A3 will coordinate all changes to the basic volume with all MAJCOM/A3s.
AFI11-2F-22AV3_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 4 NOVEMBER 2009                                                 7


                                           Chapter 2

                                    MISSION PLANNING

2.1. Responsibilities. The pilot in command of each aircraft and the designated flight lead are
ultimately responsible for mission planning. The operations and intelligence functions will
provide supplemental planning material and information as required to effectively accomplish
the assigned mission.
2.2. General Procedures.
   2.2.1. Accomplish sufficient flight planning to ensure safe mission accomplishment to
   include fuel requirements, map preparation, communication plan, and takeoff/landing data.
   2.2.2. Standards. The SQ/CC is the approval authority for squadron standards. Group/Wing
   standards may be published and approved by the OG/CC. All standards will be reviewed by
   Wing Stan/Eval (OGV) for standardization and compliance with AFI 11-series guidance.
2.3. Map/Chart Preparation.
   2.3.1. Local Area Maps. A local area map is not required if the unit pilot aid includes
   jettison areas, divert information, controlled bailout areas, and provides a local area map of
   sufficient detail to remain within assigned training areas.
   2.3.2. Charts. FLIP enroute charts may be used instead of maps on navigational flights
   within areas that are adequately covered by these charts.
   2.3.3. Low Altitude Maps. Reference AFI 11-217 Vol 2 Visual Flight Procedures for Low
   Altitude Map requirements and procedures.
2.4. Briefing/Debriefing.
   2.4.1. Briefings. Flight leads are responsible for presenting a logical briefing that will
   promote safe, effective mission accomplishment. All pilots will attend the flight briefing
   unless previously coordinated with unit/squadron supervisors.
       2.4.1.1. Items published in AFIs, AFTTPs, or squadron/wing standards and understood
       by all participants may be briefed as "standard." Specific items not pertinent to the
       mission do not need to be covered.
       2.4.1.2. Takeoff and landing data (TOLD) will be annotated on mission data cards. The
       minimum TOLD required is maximum abort speed (include wet as applicable based on
       location and potential for wet runway surface), takeoff distance and speed, rotation speed,
       and normal/heavy weight landing distance (include wet as applicable based on location
       and potential for wet runway surface).
       2.4.1.3. Review takeoff data, and ensure every member of the flight understands it.
       Place particular emphasis on takeoff and abort factors during abnormal situations such as
       short/wet runway, heavy gross weights, non-standard cable configurations.
       2.4.1.4. When dissimilar aircraft are flown in formation, brief flight responsibilities,
       proper formation position (to ensure adequate wingtip clearance), and aircraft-unique
       requirements and emergency considerations for each phase of flight.
8                          AFI11-2F-22AV3_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 4 NOVEMBER 2009


       2.4.1.5. For all low altitude mission briefings, place emphasis on obstacle/ground
       avoidance, altitude-warning features (low altitude warning) low altitude comfort level,
       and complacency avoidance.
       2.4.1.6. Flight leads will ensure briefing start time provides adequate time to discuss
       required briefing items depending on complexity of the mission and pilot capabilities. As
       a minimum, begin briefings at least 1.5 hours before scheduled takeoff. Alert briefings
       will start in sufficient time to be completed prior to pilot changeover.
       2.4.1.7. Structure the flight briefing to accommodate the capabilities of each flight
       member.
       2.4.1.8. Brief an appropriate alternate mission for each flight. The alternate mission will
       be less complex than the primary and should parallel the primary mission. If alternate
       mission does not parallel the primary mission, specific mission elements different than
       the primary mission should be briefed. Mission elements/events may be modified and
       briefed airborne as long as flight safety is not compromised. Flight leads will ensure all
       flight members acknowledge changes. Do not fly un-briefed missions/events.
       2.4.1.9. On multiple-go days when aircraft turn times do not allow follow-on mission
       brief(s) and only the initial flight brief is accomplished for all goes, the following
       guidance applies:
           2.4.1.9.1. Upgrade missions will be flown on the first sortie (second sortie if the first
           is non-effective for weather, airspace, or maintenance). Subsequent missions will be
           of equal or less complexity with no additional upgrade training without OG/CC
           approval.
           2.4.1.9.2. Participants in continuation training missions may fly their primary or
           alternate missions in any sequence.
       2.4.1.10. All missions will be debriefed.
    2.4.2. Deployed Operations, Exercise, and Quick Turn Briefings. If all flight members
    attend an initial or mass flight briefing, the flight lead on subsequent flights need brief only
    those items that have changed from the previous flight(s).
    2.4.3. Briefing Guides. Briefing guides will be used to provide the flight lead/briefer with a
    reference list of items which may apply to particular missions. Items listed in Attachment 2
    may be briefed in any sequence. Those items published in AFIs, AFTTPs, or squadron/wing
    standards may be briefed as “standard”. Units may augment these guides as necessary.
    Pending development by a higher headquarters, units that fly missions not covered by this
    instruction or its supplements will develop briefing guides for those missions and submit
    them to MAJCOM Stan/Eval for review.
2.5. Unit Developed Checklists/Local Pilot Aids/Forms.
    2.5.1. Unit developed checklists may be used in lieu of flight manual checklists (except -25
    checklists) provided they contain, as a minimum, all items (verbatim and in order) listed in
    the applicable checklist. These checklists will reflect the same change number, change date
    and applicable supplement numbers as the flight crew checklist for configuration control.
AFI11-2F-22AV3_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 4 NOVEMBER 2009                                                   9


   2.5.2. Units will produce a pilot aid that, as a minimum, includes:
       2.5.2.1. Briefing Guides.
       2.5.2.2. Local radio channelization and airfield diagrams.
       2.5.2.3. Impoundment procedures, emergency action             checklists,    NORDO/divert
       information, and search and rescue procedures.
       2.5.2.4. Arresting gear information for divert bases.
       2.5.2.5. Bailout and Jettison Areas.
       2.5.2.6. Cross-country procedures to include: command               and     control,   engine
       documentation, JOAP samples, and aircraft servicing.
       2.5.2.7. Other information as deemed necessary by the units. For example: stereo flight
       plans, turnaround procedures, local training areas, instrument pre-flight, and alert
       procedures.
2.6. G-suit/Combat Edge Use. IAW AFI 11-301 Vol. 1, Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE)
Program, the following apply:
   2.6.1. G-suit is required on all flights when 2 or more Gs are anticipated.
   2.6.2. COMBAT EDGE (CE) is required on every sortie. Exception(s): CE is not required
   on cross country, ferry or 411 FLTS sorties unless flight above FL 440 and/or 6Gs is
   anticipated.
2.7. Fuel Conservation. Manage aviation fuel as a limited commodity and precious
resource. Design procedures for optimal fuel use and efficiencies throughout all phases of
mission execution, to include ground operations, flight plans, power settings and climb/descent
profiles. Incorporate enroute tasks to make maximum use of airborne learning opportunities.

                                            Chapter 3

                           NORMAL OPERATING PROCEDURES

3.1. Ground Communications. The pilot will accomplish the ground crew briefing (when
required) in accordance with the briefing guide contained in this instruction. Normally, the pilot
and ground crew will communicate using the intercom during all engine start and pre-taxi
checks. Use the intercom system, to the maximum extent possible, anytime aircraft engines are
operating and maintenance technicians are performing tasks on the aircraft. Units with active air
defense commitments may waive the use of intercom during alert scrambles.
3.2. Ground Visual Signals. When ground intercom is not used, use visual signals IAW AFI
11-218, Aircraft Operations and Movement on the Ground, and this instruction. All signals
pertaining to operation of aircraft systems will originate with the pilot. The crew chief will
repeat the given signals when it is safe to operate the system. The pilot should not activate any
system that could pose danger to the ground crew prior to receiving proper acknowledgment
from ground personnel. The following signals augment AFI 11-218.
     3.2.1. APU START. With clenched fist, pilot makes a pulling motion.
     3.2.2. FLIGHT CONTROLS CHECK. Raise arm, clench fist, and make a stirring action.
     3.2.3. LOSS OF BRAKES WHILE TAXIING. Lower tailhook.
     3.2.4. GUN ARMAMENT CHECK. Point index finger forward with thumb upward
     simulating a pistol and shake head (yes or no).
3.3. Ground Operations.
     3.3.1. The minimum taxi interval is 150 feet staggered or 300 feet in trail. Spacing may be
     reduced when holding short of or entering the runway.
     3.3.2. Do not taxi during snow and/or icy conditions until the taxi route and runway have
     been checked for safe conditions. In this case, taxi on the centerline with a minimum of 300
     feet spacing.
     3.3.3. Keep hands in view of ground personnel during quick check, arming or de-arming
     operations. If the intercom system is not used during EOR checks, the pilot will establish
     and maintain visual contact with the ground personnel to allow the use of visual signals.
     3.3.4. Do not taxi in front of aircraft being armed/de-armed with forward firing ordnance.
3.4. Flight Lineup. Flights will line up as appropriate based on weather conditions, runway
conditions, and runway width. Use a minimum of 500 feet spacing between separated
elements/flights. If runway width precludes line-up with wingtip clearance between all aircraft
in the flight, use 500 feet spacing between elements or delay run-up until the preceding
aircraft/element releases brakes.
3.5. Before Takeoff Checks. Just prior to takeoff, all flight members will inspect each other for
proper configuration and any abnormalities.
3.6. Takeoff.
AFI11-2F-22AV3_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 4 NOVEMBER 2009                                                   11


   3.6.1. Do not takeoff if the RCR is less than 12.
      3.6.1.1. Per MAJCOM guidance, OG/CC may waive RCR minimum for specified units
      operating in cold weather locations, but in no case will takeoffs be conducted with an
      RCR of less than 8.
   3.6.2. On training missions do not takeoff if the computed takeoff roll exceeds 80 percent of
   the available runway. For takeoffs, if the computed military power takeoff distance exceeds
   one-half of the available runway, takeoff using afterburner.
   3.6.3. When operating from airfields equipped with a compatible, remotely operated cable,
   ensure the departure end cable is raised for all takeoffs and landings, unless another departure
   end cable is in place.
   3.6.4. Use a minimum of 10 seconds (15 seconds when using afterburners) takeoff interval
   between aircraft. Sensor Trail Departures will use 20 seconds takeoff interval.
   3.6.5. Aircraft will steer toward the center of the runway at the start of the takeoff roll.
   3.6.6. During rolling takeoffs, align the aircraft with the runway heading prior to advancing
   the throttles.
   3.6.7. Wing/Group Commander or Ops Group Commander may approve intersection
   takeoffs if operational requirements dictate.
   3.6.8. Do not take off with the SES LOW ICAW displayed.
3.7. Formation Takeoff: Not Authorized
3.8. Join-up/Rejoin.
   3.8.1. Day weather criteria for a VFR join-up underneath: ceiling 1,500 feet and visibility 3
   miles.
   3.8.2. Flight leaders will maintain 350 KCAS until join-up is accomplished unless mission
   requirements necessitate a different airspeed.
   3.8.3. Flight leaders should limit their angle of bank to 30 degrees for turning rejoins
   immediately after takeoff.
   3.8.4. Flight members will join in sequence. For a straight-ahead rejoin, the number two
   aircraft will join on the left wing and the second element will join on the right wing. For a
   turning rejoin, the number two aircraft will rejoin on the inside of the turn and the element to
   the outside. If mission or flight requirements dictate, the flight leader will specifically direct
   the desired formation positions.
   3.8.5. Battle Damage Checks. When circumstances permit, flight leads will direct a battle
   damage check after each mission prior to or during RTB. Except at night/IMC, this check is
   mandatory following the expenditure of any ordnance (including all types of 20mm
   ammunition). Brief deconfliction responsibilities and position change procedures. Fly no
   closer than fingertip formation spacing.
   3.8.6. For further join-up procedures, see Night Joinup (3.18.3) and Chapter 4.
12                          AFI11-2F-22AV3_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 4 NOVEMBER 2009


3.9. Formation, Visual and Administrative: IP/flight leads are responsible for ensuring
contracts, roles and responsibilities of each flight member are established, briefed, executed and
debriefed. If any flight member cannot fulfill their basic responsibilities, contracts, or other
assigned tasks, they will immediately communicate that information to the flight/element lead.
IP/flight leads will task element leads/wingmen based on their ability to fulfill basic
responsibilities and other assigned tasks. For additional formation considerations, reference
AFTTP 3-3.F-22 and AFTTP 3-1.F-22.
     3.9.1. In IMC, the maximum flight size in close/route formation is four aircraft except when
     flying in close formation with a tanker.
     3.9.2. Do not use rolling maneuvers to maintain or regain formation position below 5,000
     feet AGL or in airspace where aerobatics are prohibited.
     3.9.3. Airborne visual signals will be in accordance with AFI 11-205, Aircraft Cockpit and
     Formation Flight Signals. For four-ship flights, configuration changes will be initiated by
     radio call, when practical. When formation position changes are directed by radio, all
     wingmen will acknowledge prior to initiating the change. A radio call is mandatory when
     directing position changes at night or under instrument conditions.
     3.9.4. For non-tactical portions of a sortie (i.e. navigation to/from airspace) flight leaders
     will not break up formations until each wingman has a fix from which to navigate (visual,
     radar, operational GINS, received TACAN or received ILS in the appropriate steering mode).
     3.9.5. Changing Leads.
        3.9.5.1. When flying in limited visibility conditions, initiate lead changes from a
        stabilized, wings level attitude.
        3.9.5.2. The minimum altitude for a lead change is 500 feet AGL over land or 1,000 feet
        AGL over water (for night see paragraph 3.18.4).
        3.9.5.3. Do not initiate lead changes (unless in fingertip or route) with the wingman
        further aft than 30 degrees from line abreast.
        3.9.5.4. Flight/element leads will not initiate a lead change from a visual formation
        unless the aircraft assuming the lead is in visual contact and in a safe position to do so.
        3.9.5.5. Initiate a lead change by visual signal or radio call.
        3.9.5.6. Acknowledge receipt of the lead by head nod or radio call, as appropriate.
        3.9.5.7. A lead change is effective upon acknowledgment.
        3.9.5.8. The former leader then moves to the appropriate wing position.
     3.9.6. Visual Formation Maneuvering.
        3.9.6.1. Flight/element leads will consider wingman/element position and ability to
        safely perform a maneuver before directing it from a visual formation.
        3.9.6.2. Wingmen/elements must maneuver relative to the flight lead/lead element and
        maintain sight. Trailing aircraft/elements are responsible for deconflicting with lead
        aircraft/elements.
AFI11-2F-22AV3_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 4 NOVEMBER 2009                                                13


     3.9.6.3. Wingmen/elements will cross above the lead/lead element when deconfliction is
     required in the low altitude environment.
     3.9.6.4. Loss of Visual. Use the following procedures when one or more flight
     members/elements lose visual contact while flying a visual formation:
        3.9.6.4.1. When any flight member/element is Blind, they will call "Blind" with
        altitude (“Blind, 24.5”). The appropriate flight member/element will immediately
        respond with "Visual" and a position report or "Blind."
        3.9.6.4.2. When the other flight member/element is also "Blind," that pilot will
        immediately deconflict from the altitude called and will transmit his own altitude as
        an immediate action to deconflict flight paths. The flight lead will ensure a minimum
        of 1000 feet altitude separation is maintained. Avoid climbs/descents through the
        deconfliction altitude.
        3.9.6.4.3. When there is not a timely acknowledgment of the original "Blind" call,
        then the flight member/element initiating the call will maneuver away from the last
        known position of the other flight member/element and alter altitude.
        3.9.6.4.4. If visual contact is still not regained, the flight leader will take additional
        positive action to ensure flight path deconfliction within the flight to include a
        Terminate/Knock-It-Off call if necessary. Consider scenario restrictions such as
        sanctuary altitudes and/or adversary blocks.
        3.9.6.4.5. Aircraft will maintain altitude separation until a visual is regained and, if
        necessary, will navigate with altitude separation until mutual support is regained.
     3.9.6.5. Two-Ship Visual Formation Deconfliction. The following rules apply for
     flight path deconfliction in 2-ship visual formations:
        3.9.6.5.1. Normally, the wingman is responsible for flight path deconfliction.
        3.9.6.5.2. The flight lead becomes responsible for deconfliction when:
            3.9.6.5.2.1. Maneuvering places the leader well aft of the wingman’s 3/9 line or
            forces the wingman’s primary attention away from the leader.
            3.9.6.5.2.2. The wingman calls "padlocked."
            3.9.6.5.2.3. The wingman calls "blind."
            3.9.6.5.2.4. Primary deconfliction responsibility transfers back to the wingman
            once the wingman acknowledges a visual on his lead.
     3.9.6.6. Three/Four-Ship (or greater) Visual Formation Deconfliction. When flights
     of more than two aircraft are in Visual formation:
        3.9.6.6.1. Formation visual signals performed by a flight/element leader pertain only
        to the associated element unless specified otherwise by the flight leader.
        3.9.6.6.2. Trailing aircraft/element(s) will maintain sufficient spacing so that primary
        emphasis during formation maneuvering/turns is on deconfliction within elements,
        not on deconfliction between elements.
14                          AFI11-2F-22AV3_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 4 NOVEMBER 2009


3.10. Tactical Formation. Reference AFTTP 3-1.F22 for Tactical Formation deconfliction and
flight-member responsibilities.
3.11. Chase Formation.
     3.11.1. Restrictions. Any pilot may fly safety chase for aircraft under emergency or
     impending emergency conditions. Qualified pilots (including IQT/MQT pilots who have
     successfully completed an Instrument/Qualification evaluation) may chase as safety observer
     for aircraft performing simulated instrument flight or hung ordnance patterns. Specialized
     missions (i.e., DT&E, OT&E, WSEP, live weapons delivery, etc.) and training conducted
     IAW AFI 11-2F-22A, Volume 1, F-22A Aircrew Training, may be chased by CMR/BMC
     pilots designated by Group/Squadron Commanders. All other chase events may only be
     flown by IP/FEs or upgrading IPs under the supervision of an IP.
     3.11.2. Procedures:
        3.11.2.1. A safety observer in a chase aircraft, except IP/FE/specialized mission chase,
        will maneuver in a 30-60 degree cone with nose/tail clearance to 1,000 feet, to effectively
        clear and/or provide assistance.
        3.11.2.2. IP/FE/specialized mission aircraft will maneuver as necessary, but must
        maintain nose/tail separation until required to transition to close formation when deemed
        necessary by the IP/FE.
        3.11.2.3. No chase aircraft will stack lower than the lead aircraft when below 1,000 feet
        AGL.
3.12. Aerial Demonstrations. Brief and fly show formations as approved. Refer to AFI 11-
209, Aerial Events Policy and Procedures, and applicable MAJCOM directives for specific rules
and appropriate approval levels to participate in static displays and aerial events IAW AFI 11-
246 Vol 1, Air Force Aircraft Demonstrations (A-10, F-15, F-16, F-22).
3.13. Maneuvering Parameters.
     3.13.1. Minimum Altitudes. For aerobatics, remain above 5,000 feet AGL. During nose
     high/low speed and AHC vertical maneuvering ensure maneuvers are terminated to allow
     recovery above 5,000 feet AGL.
     3.13.2. Avoid flight through wingtip vortices and jet wash. If it is unavoidable, immediately
     unload the aircraft to approximately 1 G.
3.14. Ops Checks.
     3.14.1. Accomplish sufficient ops checks to ensure safe mission accomplishment.          Ops
     checks are required:
        3.14.1.1. During climb or at level off after takeoff.
        3.14.1.2. Prior to each (D)ACBT engagement or intercept.
        3.14.1.3. Following Air Refueling.
     3.14.2. Minimum items to check are ICAWS messages, total fuel, G-suit connection, oxygen
     system, cabin altitude, and HUD max G indicator.
AFI11-2F-22AV3_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 4 NOVEMBER 2009                                                 15


   3.14.3. For formation flights, the flight leader may initiate ops checks by radio call or visual
   signal and wingmen will respond appropriately.
      3.14.3.1. The query and response for ops checks will include total fuel amount as read on
      the Standby Flight Group (SFG). If wingmen are within 500 lbs. of the flight lead, a
      "same" call may be used.
      3.14.3.2. When external tanks are feeding, add a "tanks feeding" call to the normal Ops
      Check reply. Make a "tanks dry" call once the external tanks are confirmed dry. Once the
      "tanks dry" call has been made, no further reference to tanks need be made on subsequent
      Ops Checks.
   3.14.4. G-awareness Exercise - Reference AFI 11-214 and AFTTP 3-3.F-22A. Unless
   performing a syllabus required event (e.g. chase of a G-awareness exercise), flight members
   will maintain a minimum of 6,000 feet separation between aircraft during the execution of all
   G-awareness exercises. On board systems (e.g. air-to-air TACAN, Radar, IFDL) should be
   used to establish separation prior to maneuver execution. During maneuver execution use
   visual lookout and briefed formation contracts as primary means of ensuring aircraft
   deconfliction. If required, use on board systems to enhance situational awareness during the
   maneuver.
      3.14.4.1. Flight/element leads will ensure the airspace intended for conducting the G-
      awareness exercise is free from potential traffic conflicts. Use Air Traffic Control (ATC)
      services to the maximum extent practical to make sure the airspace is clear. Conduct the
      G-awareness exercise in the following airspace with preference to the order listed below:
          3.14.4.1.1. Special Use Airspace (e.g. Restricted/Warning areas, Air Traffic Control
          Assigned Airspace (ATCAA), MOAs and MAJCOM approved large scale
          exercise/special mission areas).
          3.14.4.1.2. Above 10,000 MSL outside of special use airspace
          3.14.4.1.3. Inside the confines of a Military Training Route (MTR)
          3.14.4.1.4. Below 10,000 feet MSL outside of special use airspace
      3.14.4.2. Flight/element leads flying outside of CONUS will follow gaining MAJCOM,
      theater or host nation guidance on airspace in which G-awareness exercises may be
      performed. If no gaining MAJCOM, theater, or host nation guidance is available, follow
      the guidance in section 3.14.4.1 to the maximum extent practical.
3.15. Radio Procedures.
   3.15.1. Preface all communications with the complete flight call sign unless excepted below.
   Transmit only that information essential for mission accomplishment or safe flight. Use
   visual signals when practical.
   3.15.2. Acknowledge radio checks that do not require the transmission of specific data by
   individual flight members in turn (Example: "2, 3, 4"). Acknowledgment indicates the
   appropriate action is complete, in the process of being completed, or the flight member
   understands.
   3.15.3. In addition to the radio procedures outlined in AFI 11-202 Volume 3, Specific
   Mission Guides, and FLIP publications, the following radio transmissions are required:
16                          AFI11-2F-22AV3_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 4 NOVEMBER 2009


        3.15.3.1. All flight members will acknowledge understanding the initial ATC clearance.
        Acknowledge subsequent ATC instructions when directed by the flight lead, or anytime
        during trail departures as detailed in paragraph 4.3.
        3.15.3.2. Each pilot will report gear down on base leg, or, if making a VFR straight in
        approach, no later than 3 miles on final. When flying an instrument approach, report gear
        down in response to ATC instructions or no later than the final approach fix or glide path
        intercept point. A wingman or chase need not make this call during a formation or
        chased approach.
3.16. General Low Altitude Procedures.
     3.16.1. Fly low level formation positions/tactics using AFTTP 3-1.F-22 and AFTTP 3-3.F-
     22, Combat Aircraft Fundamentals as guides.
     3.16.2. Line abreast formation is authorized at or above 500 feet AGL.
     3.16.3. During briefings emphasize low altitude flight maneuvering and observation of
     terrain features/obstacles in the low altitude training area. For low altitude training over
     water/featureless terrain, include specific considerations with emphasis on minimum altitudes
     and spatial disorientation.
     3.16.4. All obstacle avoidance planning for Low Altitude Map requirements will be IAW
     AFI 11-217 Vol 2 Visual Flight Procedures.
     3.16.5. At altitudes below 1,000 feet AGL, wingmen will not fly at a lower AGL altitude
     than lead.
     3.16.6. When crossing high or hilly terrain maintain positive G and do not exceed
     approximately 120 degrees of bank. Maneuvering at less than 1G is limited to upright
     bunting maneuvers.
     3.16.7. The minimum airspeed for Air Defense and Low/Slow VID procedures is 12 degrees
     AOA. The minimum airspeed for low-level navigation is 300 KCAS for.
     3.16.8. Minimum airspeed during low altitude offensive or defensive maneuvering (< 5000’
     AGL) is 350 KCAS.
     3.16.9. Minimum Altitudes. The unit commander will determine and certify pilots’
     minimum altitude IAW AFI 11-2F-22A Volume 1, as supplemented. Flight members
     participating in approved step-down training programs will comply with the requirements
     and restrictions of that program. The following minimum altitudes apply to low altitude
     training unless national rules or a training syllabus specifies higher altitudes:
        3.16.9.1. 500 feet AGL for: LOWAT Category I qualified pilots.
        3.16.9.2. For night (non-NVG) or IMC operation, the minimum altitude is 1000 feet
        above the highest obstacle within 5 NM of aircraft position.
     3.16.10. During all low altitude operations, the immediate reaction to task saturation,
     diverted attention, knock-it-off, or emergencies is to climb to a pre-briefed safe altitude
     (minimum 1000 feet AGL).
     3.16.11. Weather minimums for visual low level training are 1,500 feet ceiling and 3 miles
     visibility for any area, or unit regulations or national rules, whichever is higher.
AFI11-2F-22AV3_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 4 NOVEMBER 2009                                                   17


3.17. Air Refueling. Pilots undergoing initial/recurrency training in air refueling will not refuel
with a student boom operator (does not apply to KC-10). Pilots will inform boom operators
when refueling from a particular tanker type (KC-10 or KC-135) for the first time.
3.18. Night Procedures.
   3.18.1. Night Lighting Requirements
       3.18.1.1. Wingtip position lights: Only one position light on each wing is required.
       However, if each wing only has one light, they must be on opposite sides; one upper, one
       lower (ex: top left, bottom right).
       3.18.1.2. Landing and Taxi Lights: The landing light must be operational prior to
       takeoff. If the Taxi light is not operational, the landing light must provide sufficient
       lighting to allow safe taxi. The taxiing aircraft will come to a stop if the area cannot be
       visually cleared without the taxi light.
       3.18.1.3. Anti-collision light (white strobe): One operational Anti-collision light
       (ANTI-COLL/BRT) is required for night operations (ground and air). The Anti-collision
       light can be turned off if it causes distraction to the pilot. If the Anti-collision light is
       turned off while outside operational airspace, then at least one aircraft within a standard
       formation must have POSN/ANTI-COLL switch in the FLASH setting. Position Lights
       in the FLASH setting meet 11-202 Vol 3 requirements for anti-collision.
   3.18.2. Night Ground Operations.
       3.18.2.1. When ground personnel are working under the aircraft, the POSN/ANTI-COLL
       switch will be placed in BRT (position lights 100%, steady, anti collision light off).
       3.18.2.2. Taxi on the taxiway centerline with a minimum of 300 feet spacing.
       3.18.2.3. Use the taxi light while taxiing unless it might interfere with an aircraft landing
       or taking off. The taxiing aircraft will come to a stop if the area cannot be visually cleared
       without the taxi light.
       3.18.2.4. For taxi, set the POSN/ANTI-COLL switch to FLASH.
   3.18.3. Night Takeoff. For takeoffs, set the POSN/ANTI-COLL switch to FLASH.
   Following takeoff, each aircraft/element will climb on runway heading to 1,000 feet AGL
   before initiating turns, except where departure instructions specifically preclude compliance.
   3.18.4. Night Join-up. Weather criteria for night join-up underneath is a ceiling of 3,000
   feet and 5 miles visibility. Flight Leads will direct lighting adjustments for the flight based
   on environmental conditions and flight member feedback.
   3.18.5. Night Formation Procedures.
       3.18.5.1. When in non-visual formations at night, maintain aircraft spacing primarily by
       instruments, sensors/IFDL, and/or timing. If aircraft spacing cannot be ensured, establish
       altitude separation (1,000 feet minimum). Crosscheck instruments at all times to ensure
       ground clearance.
       3.18.5.2. Do not change lead or wing formation positions below 1,500 feet AGL unless
       on RADAR downwind. Direct lead and position changes using the radio and from a
       stabilized, wings-level attitude.
18                          AFI11-2F-22AV3_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 4 NOVEMBER 2009


        3.18.5.3. Night Formation Parameters. References and Parameters for night formation
        positions are specified in AFTTP 3-3.F22.
     3.18.6. Night Break-up. Prior to a formation break-up at night, the flight leader will
     transmit attitude, altitude, airspeed, and altimeter setting, which will be acknowledged by
     wingmen. Wingmen will confirm their onboard systems required for independent night
     navigation are functional (GINS, CNI).
     3.18.7. Night Landing. Normally land from an instrument straight-in approach. Refer to
     AFI 11-202 Volume 3, as supplemented for specific procedures.
3.19. Night Vision Goggles (NVG) Procedures.
     3.19.1. USAF/MAJCOM guidance (including AFI 11-202 Volume 3, and AFI 11-214)
     outline NVG procedures. AFTTP 3-1 and AFTTP 3-3 will incorporate expanded tactical
     guidance. Additionally:
        3.19.1.1. NVGs will only be worn by qualified flight members or when upgrading with
        NVGs with a qualified NVG instructor in the flight.
        3.19.1.2. Flight leads will brief the appropriate time to don/doff goggles for the sortie.
        Pilots will ensure deconfliction while donning/doffing goggles.
        3.19.1.3. When operating in a visual formation outside of NVG Route, more frequent
        crosscheck of instruments will be made (approximately every 4-6 seconds) to reduce
        possibility of spatial dis/mis-orientation.
        3.19.1.4. Flight Leads will brief the appropriate NVG-compatible formation lighting
        levels for each flight member to set.
     3.19.2. NVGs must be preflight tested and adjusted by the pilot in the unit eyelane prior to
     NVG operations. NVGs will be stowed or raised until at least 2,000 feet AGL in climbing or
     level flight. Stow or raise NVGs no later than 5 minutes prior to landing unless NVGs are
     necessary to handle an emergency.
     3.19.3. With NVGs, pilots may operate below the RAA/MSA down to a minimum of 1,000
     ft AGL during high-illumination (HI) periods (as defined by AFI 11-214). The flight lead or
     individual pilot is the final authority to assess actual illumination for a particular mission
     element, based on visibility and terrain features/resolution.
     3.19.4. NVGs may be worn for night tanker rejoins, but will be raised or stowed no later
     than the stern position.
     3.19.5. Unless required for battle damage checks or aircraft assistance, wingmen wearing
     NVGs will fly no closer than route formation.
     3.19.6. NVG Battle Damage Checks. If executed, fly no closer than parameters for route
     formation with NVGs (as defined in AFTTP 3-3.F-22).
     3.19.7. In-flight Emergencies with NVGs. During in-flight emergencies, immediately
     assess whether the NVGs aid or hinder completing emergency procedures. If they are a
     hindrance or the emergency may deteriorate into an ejection situation, remove and stow the
     NVGs.
     3.19.8. Abnormal Procedures.
AFI11-2F-22AV3_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 4 NOVEMBER 2009                                                     19


      3.19.8.1. Lost sight. If you lose sight within a visual formation, execute appropriate lost
      wingman procedures. Consider highlighting position by increasing exterior lighting level,
      activating the afterburners, or deploying chaff/flares as airspace allows.
      3.19.8.2. NVG failure. Ensure separation from other aircraft and the ground before
      attempting to remedy the NVG failure.
          3.19.8.2.1. Transition to instruments.
          3.19.8.2.2. Perform lost wingman procedures if appropriate.
          3.19.8.2.3. Route abort/climb above MSA if appropriate.
          3.19.8.2.4. Terminate/KIO as applicable.
          3.19.8.2.5. If other aircraft are in the vicinity, direct them to raise their external lights
          to non-NVG visible levels.
          3.19.8.2.6. Attempt to regain NVG operation by switching to the opposite battery.
          Once clear of other aircraft and terrain, change the battery. If these steps do not solve
          the problem, stow NVGs and proceed with non-NVG plan.
      3.19.8.3. Inadvertent flight into weather. Encountering poor weather conditions during
      NVG operations may cause loss of SA and aircrew distraction/disorientation.
          3.19.8.3.1. Single ship or separated from flight members:
              3.19.8.3.1.1. Transition to instruments.
              3.19.8.3.1.2. Route abort if LOWAT, otherwise climb/descend to VMC.
              3.19.8.3.1.3. Terminate/KIO as applicable.
          3.19.8.3.2. Formation flight. If entering weather in formation or close proximity to
          other aircraft, perform the first five steps under NVG failure (para 3.19.8.2), as
          appropriate, then climb/descend to attempt to regain VMC.
3.20. Fuel Requirements.
   3.20.1. Joker Fuel. A pre-briefed fuel needed to terminate an event and proceed with the
   remainder of the mission.
   3.20.2. Bingo Fuel. A pre-briefed fuel state that allows the aircraft to return to the base of
   intended landing or alternate, if required, using preplanned recovery parameters and arriving
   with normal recovery fuel as listed below.
   3.20.3. Normal Recovery Fuel. The fuel on initial or at the FAF at the base of intended
   landing or alternate, if required. Fuel quantity will be as established locally or 2,500 pounds,
   whichever is higher.
   3.20.4. Declare the following when it becomes apparent that an aircraft may land at the
   intended destination or alternate, if required, with:
      3.20.4.1. Minimum Fuel. 1,800 pounds or less. This is based on 20 minutes reserves at
      30K’ MSL flying max endurance airspeed (fulfilling AFI 11-202v3 fuel reserve
      requirements).
      3.20.4.2. Emergency Fuel. 1,200 pounds or less.
20                          AFI11-2F-22AV3_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 4 NOVEMBER 2009


3.21. Approaches and Landings.
     3.21.1. The desired touchdown point for a VFR approach is 500-1000 feet from the
     threshold or the glideslope interception point for a precision approach. When local
     procedures or unique conditions require landing beyond the normal touchdown point, adjust
     the touchdown point accordingly.
     3.21.2. Minimum pattern and touchdown spacing between landing aircraft is 3,000 feet for
     similar aircraft (e.g. F-22A versus F-22A), 6,000 feet for dis-similar aircraft (e.g. F-22A
     versus F-16) or as directed by MAJCOM or the landing base, whichever is higher. Increase
     spacing whenever wake turbulence is anticipated.
     3.21.3. Normally, all aircraft will land in the center of the runway and clear to the turnoff
     (cold) side of the runway when speed/conditions permit.
     3.21.4. Landing Restrictions.
        3.21.4.1. When the computed landing roll exceeds 80 percent of the available runway,
        land at an alternate if possible.
        3.21.4.2. Do not land over any raised web barrier (e.g. MA-1A, 61QSII).
        3.21.4.3. When the RCR at the base of intended landing is less than 12, land at an
        alternate if possible. If an alternate is not available, an approach end or midfield
        arrestment is recommended.
3.22. Overhead Traffic Patterns.
     3.22.1. Overhead patterns can be made with unexpended live/inert ordnance. This does not
     apply to hung or misfired ordnance (secure or unsecure).
     3.22.2. Initiate the break over the touchdown point or as directed.
     3.22.3. Execute individual breaks in a level 180 degree turn to the downwind leg at
     minimum intervals of 5 seconds (except IP/FE chase or when in tactical formation).
     3.22.4. Aircraft must be wings level on final at approximately 300 feet AGL and 1 mile from
     the planned touchdown point.
3.23. Tactical Overhead Traffic Patterns. Tactical entry to the overhead traffic pattern is
permitted when:
     3.23.1. The published overhead pattern altitude and airspeed are used.
     3.23.2. Specific procedures are developed and coordinated with appropriate air traffic
     control agencies.
     3.23.3. No more than four aircraft are in the flight. Aircraft/elements more than 6,000 feet in
     trail are considered a separate flight.
     3.23.4. No aircraft are offset from the runway in the direction of the break. The intent is to
     avoid requiring a tighter than normal turn to arrive on normal downwind.
     3.23.5. Normal downwind, base turn positions, and spacing are flown.
3.24. Touch-and-Go Landings.
AFI11-2F-22AV3_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 4 NOVEMBER 2009                                             21


   3.24.1. Fly touch-and-go landings IAW AFI 11-202 Volume 3, as supplemented by
   MAJCOM. Multiple touch-and-go landings may be flown to regain landing currency.
   3.24.2. Do not fly touch-and-go landings with hung ordnance, live external ordnance, or
   with fuel remaining in any external tank.
3.25. Low Approaches.
   3.25.1. Observe the following minimum altitudes:
       3.25.1.1. Normal single ship low approaches - so that touchdown does not occur.
       3.25.1.2. IP/FE flying chase position - 50 feet AGL.
       3.25.1.3. Formation low approaches and non-IP/FE chase - 100 feet AGL.
       3.25.1.4. Chase aircraft during an emergency - 300 feet AGL unless safety or
       circumstances dictate otherwise.
   3.25.2. During go-around, remain 500 feet below VFR overhead traffic pattern altitude until
   crossing the departure end of the runway unless local procedures, missed approach/climbout
   procedures, or controller instructions dictate otherwise.
3.26. Closed Traffic Patterns. Initiate the pattern at the departure end of the runway unless
directed/cleared otherwise by local procedures or the controlling agency. From a formation
approach or chase position, a sequential closed may be flown with ATC concurrence at an
interval to ensure proper spacing. Plan to arrive on downwind at 200-250 KCAS.
3.27. Formation Approaches.
   3.27.1. General.
       3.27.1.1. Normally accomplish formation approaches from a published instrument
       approach or a VFR straight-in approach using the VASI, if available. In all cases, use a
       rate of descent similar to a normal precision approach.
       3.27.1.2. Aircraft must be within 3,000 pounds weight of each other and symmetrically
       loaded.
       3.27.1.3. Position the wingman on the upwind side if crosswind exceeds 5 knots.
       3.27.1.4. Formation Approaches will not descend below 100’ AGL.
   3.27.2. Formation Landings. Formation Landings are not authorized.
   3.27.3. Formation Drag Procedures.
       3.27.3.1. Formation drag landings are restricted to:
          3.27.3.1.1. Daytime
          3.27.3.1.2. Weather: 1500'/3 miles
          3.27.3.1.3. Formation: two-ship maximum
       3.27.3.2. When directed to take spacing, wingmen will reduce power, extend speed brake
       and slow to no less than 200 KCAS while achieving 1.5 to 2.5 NM spacing.
       3.27.3.3. Designate the preceding aircraft as NTS.

3.28. After Shutdown Procedures. All flight members will accomplish a post flight walk-
around. The intent of this inspection is to find evidence of birdstrike, lost panels, damaged
ordnance, and structural damage resulting from over-Gs or other in-flight abnormalities.
3.29. Identification Friend or Foe/Selective Identification Feature (IFF/SIF). Excessive
Mode 4 interrogations from the F-22 AAI (specifically from the aft) can cause civil aircraft
transponders to malfunction. IAW the FAA F-22A AAI Spectrum Certification, the following
procedures apply:
     3.29.1. Within operational airspace, or when required for safety or real-world missions
     outside operational airspace, pilots may use full AAI system interrogation capabilities.
     3.29.2. Outside operational airspace (transit to and from airspace, cross-country, etc.) and
     during Operation Noble Eagle CAPs (unless required for tasked intercept), pilots will use the
     following procedures:
        3.29.2.1. If using automatic System Mode 4 Interrogations, select FWD AAI.
        3.29.2.2. When making Manual Mode 4 Interrogations interrogations, place cursors
        within the Sensor Search Volume (SSV).
3.30. Weather Minimums. Refer to table 3.1 for a summary of weather minimums affecting F-
22A operations.

Table 3.1. Weather Minimum Summary (Feet/NM/KM).
        Event                                  Minimum

                                            Chapter 4

                                INSTRUMENT PROCEDURES

4.1. Approach Category.
     4.1.1. The F-22A is Approach Category E. Accomplish missed approach IAW flight manual
     procedures. Missed approach airspeed is 250 KCAS.
     4.1.2. Use approach Category D minimums at an emergency/divert airfield where no
     Category E minimums are published. Airfields with Category D minimums may be
     designated as an alternate (divert) airfield. Practice instrument approaches may be flown
     using Category D minimums if VMC can be maintained throughout the procedure. Under
     these circumstances, approach Category D minimums may be used provided:
        4.1.2.1. A straight-in approach is flown.
        4.1.2.2. The aircraft is flown at final approach airspeed of 165 KCAS or less.
        4.1.2.3. The aircraft is flown at 255 knots true airspeed (KTAS) or less for the missed
        approach segment of the approach. At high-pressure altitudes and temperatures 255
        KTAS may not be compatible with published missed approach airspeeds and Category D
        approaches should not be flown.
     4.1.3. The F-22A’s GINS is approved for enroute Area Navigation (RNAV). The enroute
     navigation may not exceed 1.5 hours between INS updates. An update is defined as
     establishing a positive position using visual, TACAN, GPS, or on-board radar. Do not fly
     RNAV approaches. RNAV operations in required navigation performance (RNP) airspace or
     using RNP procedures are not authorized. Use of RNAV “Q” or “T” designated routes is not
     authorized
4.2. Takeoff and Join-up.
     4.2.1. The flight lead must get an appropriate ATC clearance (altitude block or trail
     formation) when a flight join-up is not possible due to weather conditions or operational
     requirements. Formation trail departures must comply with instructions for a nonstandard
     formation flight as defined in FLIP.
     4.2.2. If weather is below 1500 feet and 3 miles, each aircraft will climb on takeoff heading
     to 1,000 feet AGL before initiating any turns, except when departure instructions specifically
     preclude compliance.
4.3. Trail Procedures.
     4.3.1. General.
        4.3.1.1. During trail formations, basic instrument flying is the first priority and must not
        be sacrificed when performing secondary trail tasks. Strictly adhere to the briefed
        airspeeds, power settings, altitudes, headings, and turn points. If task saturation occurs,
        cease attempts to maintain trail, concentrate on flying the instrument departure, and then
        notify the flight lead. The flight lead will then notify air traffic control (ATC).
        4.3.1.2. Flight leaders will request non-standard formation from ATC.
AFI11-2F-22AV3_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 4 NOVEMBER 2009                                                 25


     4.3.1.3. ATC instructions issued to the lead aircraft apply to the entire flight.
     4.3.1.4. Flight leads will brief aircraft/element spacing. Minimum spacing between
     aircraft when in non-standard formation is 9,000 feet and will be maintained using on
     board systems.
     4.3.1.5. If a flight member is not on IFDL, each aircraft will follow the No NTS
     procedures until the aircraft/element immediately in trail has established the preceding
     aircraft as the NTS and called "tied."
  4.3.2. If Flight Member is unable to attain an NTS.
     4.3.2.1. The flight leader will call when initiating all turns. Subsequent aircraft must
     delay turns to maintain the desired spacing.
     4.3.2.2. Each aircraft/element will maintain 1.5-2.5 mile spacing using all available
     aircraft systems and navigational aids to monitor position.
     4.3.2.3. During climbs and descents, each aircraft/element will call passing each 5,000
     foot altitude increment with altitude and heading (or heading passing) until join-up, level-
     off, or the following aircraft/element calls "tied."
     4.3.2.4. Each aircraft/element will call initiating any altitude or heading change.
     Acknowledgments are not required; however, it is imperative that preceding
     aircraft/elements monitor the radio transmissions and progress of the succeeding
     aircraft/elements and immediately correct deviations from the planned route.
     4.3.2.5. Each aircraft/element will maintain at least 1,000 feet vertical separation from
     the preceding aircraft/element until establishing radar/visual contact, except in instances
     where departure instructions specifically preclude compliance. Reduce vertical separation
     to 500 feet if necessary to comply with MSA restrictions.
     4.3.2.6. In the event a visual join-up cannot be accomplished on top or at level off, the
     flight leader will request altitude separation for each succeeding aircraft/element to meet
     the requirements of the above paragraph.
  4.3.3. With NTS.
     4.3.3.1. Each aircraft/element will call “tied” when a NTS is established with the
     preceding aircraft. Once all aircraft are tied, no further radio calls are required, unless
     contact is lost. Flight leads will ensure that wingman are aware of any unplanned or
     ATC directed intermediate level off altitudes.
     4.3.3.2. In flights of three or more aircraft, use all available aircraft systems (i.e. radar,
     IFDL, TACAN, AAI, etc.) to ensure that trail is maintained on the correct aircraft.
  4.3.4. Trail Departures.
     4.3.4.1. Use 20 seconds takeoff spacing.
     4.3.4.2. Each aircraft will accelerate in MIL/AB power until reaching 350 KCAS. Climb
     at 350 KCAS until reaching .88 mach, unless otherwise briefed.
26                          AFI11-2F-22AV3_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 4 NOVEMBER 2009


        4.3.4.3. Upon reaching 350 KCAS, the flight leader will set and maintain 90% RPM
        unless otherwise briefed.
        4.3.4.4. Limit all turns to a maximum of 30 degrees of bank.
     4.3.5. Enroute Trail. Flight leads must brief airspeeds, power settings, and configuration.
     4.3.6. Trail Recovery.
        4.3.6.1. Trail recovery procedures must be coordinated and approved through the
        responsible ATC facilities and addressed in a local operating procedure or in the unit
        supplement to this volume. Trail recoveries will only be accomplished at home stations,
        local diverts and deployed locations where procedures have been established and briefed.
        As a minimum, procedures must address each recovery profile, missed approach,
        climbout, lost contact, lost communications and desired/maximum spacing requirements.
        4.3.6.2. Limit trail recoveries to a maximum of four aircraft.
        4.3.6.3. Trail recoveries are authorized when weather at the base of intended landing is at
        or above the highest pilot weather category in the flight or approach minimums,
        whichever is higher.
        4.3.6.4. Trail recoveries will not terminate in simultaneous PAR or ASR approaches.
        Recoveries to separate PAR/ASRs are authorized, however, flights must split prior to
        PAR/ASR final.
        4.3.6.5. The flight lead must brief the flight on spacing, configuration, and airspeeds.
        Minimum spacing between aircraft is 9,000 feet in IMC and will be maintained using
        sensors or IFDL.
        4.3.6.6. The flight lead must coordinate the trail recovery with ATC prior to taking
        spacing.
        4.3.6.7. The formation must squawk as directed by ATC. Regardless of flight position,
        the lead aircraft in the trail recovery will squawk the ATC issued Mode 3 code.
        4.3.6.8. ATC instructions to the lead aircraft will be for the entire flight. ATC will
        provide radar flight following for the entire formation.
        4.3.6.9. Limit all turns to a maximum of 30 degrees of bank.
        4.3.6.10. Once established on a segment of a published approach, each aircraft must
        comply with all published altitudes and restrictions while maintaining trail separation.
        4.3.6.11. Unless local procedures establish defined reference points for airspeed/
        configuration changes, the flight lead will direct changes by radio. At flight lead's call,
        all aircraft must simultaneously comply with the directed change.
        4.3.6.12. All aircraft will report the final approach fix.
        4.3.6.13. If contact is lost with the preceding aircraft, the pilot will transmit "C/S lost
        contact." The preceding aircraft will respond with altitude, airspeed and heading.
        Establish altitude deconfliction and coordinate a separate clearance with ATC. If contact
AFI11-2F-22AV3_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 4 NOVEMBER 2009                                               27


       is lost while established on a segment of a published approach, flight members may
       continue the approach, but must confirm separation via navigation aids. If separation
       cannot be confirmed, execute missed approach or climbout as instructed by ATC.
4.4. Formation Break-up. Formation break-up from a visual formation will occur in VMC. If
IMC is unavoidable, breakup from a visual formation will occur in straight and level flight. This
restriction does not apply to trail formation. Prior to an IMC break-up, the flight leader must
transmit attitude, airspeed, altitude, and altimeter setting which will be acknowledged by
wingmen. Flight leaders will confirm (and wingmen will acknowledge) that all flight members
have the ability to navigate independently (operable CNIs and GINS, and/or reception of
appropriate TACAN/ILS).
   4.4.1. Prior to split-up, the flight lead must ensure that all wingmen have systems available
   to provide sufficient navigation to landing (GINS, CNI, TACAN/ILS as required).
4.5. Formation Penetration.
   4.5.1. Restrict formation penetrations in route/close formation to two aircraft when the
   weather at the base of intended landing is less than overhead traffic pattern minimums.
   4.5.2. Formation penetrations using sensor trail procedures are authorized when weather at
   the base of intended landing is at/above the highest pilot weather category in the flight or
   approach minimums, whichever is higher.
4.6. Formation Approach. During IMC formation flights, do not change lead or wing
positions below 1,500 feet AGL unless on RADAR downwind.
4.7. Simulated Instrument Flight.
   4.7.1. Restrictions. Follow the simulated instrument flight restrictions defined in AFI 11-
   202V3.

5.1. References. AFI 11-214 contains air-to-air procedures, to include operations with live
ordnance applicable to all aircraft. This chapter specifies procedures or restrictions applicable to
F-22A operations.
5.2. Simulated Gun Employment. Missions may be flown with a loaded gun provided the gun
is safe IAW T.O. 1F-22AC-34-1CL-1 and a trigger check is first performed with the master arm
switch in arm with Embedded Training deselected. Point the aircraft away from other aircraft
and inhabited areas during the trigger check. Do not perform a trigger check with a hot gun. If
an aircraft is flown with a hot gun or live missiles, the procedures in AFI 11-214 apply.
5.3. Maneuvering Limitations.
     5.3.1. Negative-G gun jinks are prohibited.
5.4. Aerial Gunnery Tow Procedures. AFI 11-214 applies. In addition:
     5.4.1. TDU-32 A/B Banner Deployment. Enroute to the range, chase aircraft will ensure a
     stable flying Banner. While in straight and level flight, the chase pilot will pass the direction
     of "Banner lean" (if any) in clock position to the tow pilot. This will establish the best turn
     direction for employment. (If Banner is flying at the 10 o'clock position; tow will turn right).
     5.4.2. Abnormal Procedures.
        5.4.2.1. Unable to Release Banner. If possible, the tow will gain chase aircraft (shooter
        desired) and proceed to local jettison area and attempt jettison. If Banner still remains,
        recover IAW local procedure.
        5.4.2.2. Banner Shot Off, Cable Remaining. Release cable in working area. Shooter
        rejoins with tow to ensure no cable remains. If cable remains, recover IAW local
        procedures.

chapter specifies procedures or restrictions applicable to F-22A operations. Qualification and
scoring criteria are contained in AFI 11-2F-22AV1.
6.2. Simulated Off-Range Weapons Employment While Carrying A/G Ordnance. Off-
range is defined as an area or range in which A/G ordnance release is either not authorized or in
which unintentional or inadvertent release could result in ordnance impacting an area not
authorized for that ordnance. AFI 11-214 and the following apply:
   6.2.1. Pilots will NOT press the pickle button with inert A/G Ordnance loaded unless the
   following conditions are met:
       6.2.1.1. Embedded Training (ET) Mode On.
       6.2.1.2. Air-to-Air Master Mode selected.
       6.2.1.3. INHIBIT selected on SMD

   6.2.2. Do not conduct off-range simulated weapons employment with hung ordnance.
   6.2.3. Do not conduct any off-range simulated weapons employment (A/A or A/G) with live
   ordnance (except 20mm IAW AFI 11-214) aboard the aircraft.
   6.2.4. With live ordnance loaded (other than 20mm with a safed gun), the Master Arm
   switch will stay SAFE unless the pilot is in appropriate airspace and preparing to employ live
   ordnance.
6.3. Weather Minimums. Basic weather minimums established in AFI 11-214 apply.
6.4. Night Weapons Delivery/Range Operations. All procedures in AFI 11-214 apply.
6.5. Target Identification. Pilots will positively identify the target prior to weapons release.
Pilots will reference the JDAM Mission Data Edit page to confirm the proper coordinates,
elevation, and weapons data is loaded in the steerpoint for their assigned target(s) and that these
values match the desired point of impact for A/G weapons. Pilots will ensure they completely
understand how coordinates and elevation for their target(s) were generated and that use of this
data is in compliance with all range procedures or Rules of Engagement.
6.6. Live Ordnance Procedures. When carrying live air-to-ground munitions:
   6.6.1. Refer to AFI 11-214.
   6.6.2. Do not make simulated weapons delivery passes on manned targets with live air-to-
   ground munitions loaded on the aircraft.
   6.6.3. When Ground Controllers are on Class B/C ranges the following procedures apply:
       6.6.3.1. All pilots will be familiar with applicable range weapons delivery procedures,

                                           Chapter 7

                        ABNORMAL OPERATING PROCEDURES

7.1. General. These procedures do not supersede flight manual guidance.
   7.1.1. Do not accept an aircraft for flight with a safety of flight malfunction addressed in the
   emergency/abnormal procedure section of the flight manual until it has been corrected.
   7.1.2. Do not use a malfunctioning system unless it is required for safe recovery of the
   aircraft. Do not continue in-flight troubleshooting a malfunction after completing flight
   manual emergency procedures and the aircraft may be safely recovered.
   7.1.3. Do not taxi the aircraft with nosewheel steering or brake malfunctions unless
   authorized by T.O. 1F-22A-1.
   7.1.4. For actual or perceived flight control malfunctions, terminate maneuvering and take
   appropriate action.
7.2. Ground Aborts.
   7.2.1. If a flight member aborts prior to takeoff, the flight leader will normally renumber the
   flight. Flight leaders must advise the appropriate agencies of such changes.
   7.2.2. In the event of an abort, formation flight may only continue if it is led by a qualified
   flight lead. The alternatives are a sympathetic abort or proceeding on a pre-briefed single-
   ship mission.
   7.2.3. Delayed aircraft may join the flight at a briefed rendezvous point or may fly a briefed
   alternate single ship mission. If accomplishing a join-up, cease tactical maneuvering until
   the delayed aircraft is joined and all flight members are ready to continue.
7.3. Takeoff Aborts.
   7.3.1. If an abort occurs during takeoff roll, notify tower and flight members with call sign
   and intentions when practical. Following aircraft will alter takeoff roll to ensure clearance or
   abort takeoff if adequate clearance cannot be maintained. The phrase "Cable, Cable, Cable"
   will be used to indicate a departure-end cable arrestment. The phrase "Barrier, Barrier,
   Barrier" will be used to indicate a departure-end net arrestment. Local procedures will
   address net barrier raising procedures.
   7.3.2. When applying the brakes above 120 KCAS during a takeoff abort, or hot brakes are
   suspected; declare a ground emergency, taxi the aircraft to the designated hot brake area, and
   follow hot brake procedures.
   7.3.3. If aborting a takeoff at or above 100 KCAS, lower the tailhook. If aborting below 100
   KCAS, lower the tailhook if there is any doubt about the ability to stop on the runway.
7.4. Air Aborts.
   7.4.1. If an abort occurs after takeoff, all aircraft will maintain their original numerical
   callsign.
   7.4.2. Escort aborting aircraft with an emergency to the field of intended landing. In other
   cases, the flight leader will determine if an escort is required.
32                          AFI11-2F-22AV3_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 4 NOVEMBER 2009


     7.4.3. Abort the mission and land out of a straight-in approach, regardless of apparent
     damage or subsequent normal operation, for any of the following:
        7.4.3.1. Birdstrike/Foreign Object Damage.
        7.4.3.2. Flight control system anomalies. This does not include flight control system
        ICAWS that reset IAW flight manual procedures.
        7.4.3.3. Single engine.
     7.4.4. If an aircraft experiences an over-G, use the following procedures:
        7.4.4.1. Perform a battle damage check after all over-Gs.
        7.4.4.2. Terminate the mission and land as soon as practical from a straight-in approach.
        7.4.4.3. Document over-Gs in IMIS after flight.
7.5. Engine Malfunctions. Report all engine anomalies during maintenance debriefing.
7.6. Radio Failure.
     7.6.1. General. Individual aircraft experiencing radio failure will comply with procedures
     outlined in FLIP, AFI 11-202 Volume 3, this instruction, and local directives.
     7.6.2. Formation:
        7.6.2.1. Flight members who experience total radio failure while in close or route
        formation will maneuver within close/route parameters to attract the attention of another
        flight member and give the appropriate visual signals. Terminate the mission as soon as
        practical and lead the NORDO aircraft to the base of intended landing or a divert base (if
        required). Perform a formation approach to a drop-off on final unless safety
        considerations dictate otherwise.
        7.6.2.2. If flying other than close/route formation when radio failure occurs, the NORDO
        aircraft should attempt to rejoin to a route position at approximately 500 feet on another
        flight member. The NORDO aircraft is responsible for maintaining clearances from
        other flight members until his presence is acknowledged by a wingrock, signifying
        clearance to join. Once joined, the NORDO aircraft will give the appropriate visual
        signals. If pre-briefed, the NORDO aircraft may proceed to a rendezvous point and hold.
        If no one has rejoined prior to reaching JOKER fuel, the NORDO aircraft should proceed
        to the base of intended landing or a divert base. Aircraft experiencing any
        difficulty/emergency in addition to NORDO will proceed as required by the situation.
     7.6.3. Aerial Gunnery/Missile Firing NORDO Procedures:
        7.6.3.1. Aircraft will not fire without two-way radio contact.
        7.6.3.2. Shooting aircraft: safe the armament switches, join on another member of the
        flight or the tow aircraft, IAW para 7.6.2.
        7.6.3.3. Aerial gunnery Lear tow aircraft: rocks wings and continue the turn if an attack
        is in progress. The flight leader of the attacking aircraft will "knock off" the attack and
        join on the tow's wing, remaining clear of the target in the event it is cut. The tow pilot
        will use standard hand signals to indicate his difficulty. The flight leader will signal
        when the target is cleared for cut with a slicing motion across the throat. After the target
AFI11-2F-22AV3_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 4 NOVEMBER 2009                                                 33


       is away and the flight lead determines there is no remaining cable, the tow will RTB with
       an escort following the briefed NORDO recovery procedures. If cable remains, follow
       local procedures.
   7.6.4. NORDO Recovery:
       7.6.4.1. Apply the procedures in AFI 11-205 and FLIP.
       7.6.4.2. If a formation straight-in approach is flown and a go-around becomes necessary,
       the chase will go-around, pass the NORDO aircraft and rock his wings. The NORDO
       aircraft will go-around, if the situation allows. If the NORDO aircraft is in formation as a
       wingman, the leader will initiate a gentle turn into the wingman and begin the go-around.
       7.6.4.3. A NORDO aircraft intending to make an approach-end cable engagement will
       signal the escorting aircraft by extending the tailhook. If the NORDO aircraft is not
       escorted, the pilot will fly a straight-in approach flashing the landing light on final to
       signal the tower.
7.7. Severe Weather Penetration. Avoid flight through severe weather. If unavoidable, flights
should break-up and obtain separate clearances prior to severe weather penetration. Set airspeed
to TO 1-F-22A-1 thunderstorm penetration airspeed for flight through rain showers or
thunderstorms.
7.8. Lost Wingman Procedures. In any lost wingman situation, immediate separation of
aircraft is essential. Upon losing sight of the leader or if unable to maintain formation, the
wingman will simultaneously:
   7.8.1. Execute the applicable lost wingman procedures. Refer to para 7.9 for specific spatial
   disorientation (SD) considerations. Smooth application of control inputs is imperative to
   minimize the effects of SD.
       7.8.1.1. Transition to primary flight instruments.
       7.8.1.2. Inform lead by transmitting "C/S is lost wingman."
       7.8.1.3. After executing a lost wingman procedure, do not attempt rejoining with the
       flight until obtaining permission from the flight lead.
       7.8.1.4. When able, obtain a separate clearance.
       7.8.1.5. Observe all published terrain clearance limits.
   7.8.2. Two- or Three-Ship Flights (three-ship echelon, refer to four-ship procedures):
       7.8.2.1. Wings-level flight (climbing, descending, or straight and level). Turn away
       using 15 degrees of bank for 15 seconds, then resume original heading.
       7.8.2.2. Turns:
           7.8.2.2.1. Outside the Turn. Reverse the direction of turn using 15 degrees of bank
           for 15 seconds. Continue straight ahead to ensure separation prior to resuming the
           turn.
           7.8.2.2.2. Inside the Turn. Momentarily reduce power to ensure nose-tail separation
           and direct the flight leader to roll out of the turn. Maintain the original turn. The
           leader may only resume the turn when separation is ensured.

        7.8.2.3. Final Approach. Momentarily turn away from lead to ensure clearance and
        execute the published missed approach procedure.
        7.8.2.4. Missed Approach. Momentarily turn away from lead to ensure clearance and
        continue the published or assigned missed approach procedure. Climb to 500 feet above
        missed approach altitude.
     7.8.3. Four-Ship Flights. Number 2 and 3 follow the procedures outlined above. Number
     4's initial action assumes that number 3 has also gone lost wingman. In addition to paragraph
     7.8, number 4 will:
        7.8.3.1. Wings-Level Flight (climbing, descending, or straight and level). Turn away
        using 30 degrees of bank for 30 seconds, then resume the original heading.
        7.8.3.2. Turns:
            7.8.3.2.1. Outside the Turn. Reverse direction of turn using 30 degrees of bank for
            30 seconds to ensure separation from lead and number 3.
            7.8.3.2.2. Inside the Turn. Momentarily reduce power to ensure nose-tail separation
            and increase bank angle by 15 degrees. Direct the leader to roll out. The leader will
            only resume the turn when separation is ensured.
     7.8.4. Leader must acknowledge the lost wingman's radio call and, when appropriate,
     transmit attitude, heading, altitude, airspeed, and other parameters.
     7.8.5. If a wingman becomes separated and any aircraft experiences radio failure, the aircraft
     with the operational radio will obtain a separate clearance. The NORDO aircraft will turn the
     IFF Mode 3C to 7600 while proceeding with previous clearance. If an emergency situation
     arises along with radio failure, set the IFF to EMERGENCY for the remainder of the flight.
     7.8.6. Only practice lost wingman procedures in VMC.
7.9. Spatial Disorientation (SD). Conditions that prevent a clear visual horizon or increase
pilot tasking are conducive to SD. To prevent SD, the pilot must increase his instrument
crosscheck rate. If SD symptoms are encountered:
     7.9.1. Single Ship:
        7.9.1.1. Concentrate on flying basic instruments with frequent reference to the HUD.
        The SFG may be used as an alternate attitude reference if it is using a different GINS
        source than the HUD (i.e. HUD on GINS 1 and SFG on Right UFD).
        7.9.1.2. If symptoms persist and conditions permit, fly straight and level flight until
        symptoms abate, usually within 60 seconds. Consider using the autopilot.
        7.9.1.3. If necessary, declare an emergency and advise ATC.
        7.9.1.4. NOTE: It is possible for SD to proceed to the point where the aircrew is
        incapacitated and unable to see or interpret the flight instruments. In this situation,
        aircraft control may be impossible. If this occurs, the aircrew should consider ejecting.
     7.9.2. Formation Lead:
        7.9.2.1. Advise the wingmen that flight lead has SD and comply with procedures in
        paragraph 7.9.1.
AFI11-2F-22AV3_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 4 NOVEMBER 2009                                                   35


      7.9.2.2. Use the wingmen to confirm attitude and provide verbal feedback.
      7.9.2.3. If symptoms persist, terminate the mission and recover the flight by the simplest
      and safest means possible.
   7.9.3. Formation Wingman:
      7.9.3.1. Advise lead of the disorientation.
      7.9.3.2. Lead will advise wingman of aircraft attitude, altitude, heading, and airspeed.
      7.9.3.3. If symptoms persist and conditions permit, lead will establish straight and level
      flight for 30-60 seconds.
      7.9.3.4. If the above procedures are not effective, lead should consider passing the lead
      to the wingman, provided the leader will be able to maintain situational awareness from a
      chase position. Transfer lead while in straight and level flight. Once assuming the lead,
      maintain straight and level flight for 60 seconds. If necessary, terminate the tactical
      mission and recover by the simplest and safest means possible.
   7.9.4. Greater than 2-Ship Formation. Lead should separate the flight into elements to
   more effectively handle a wingman with persistent SD symptoms. Establish straight and
   level flight IAW paragraph 4.4 (Formation Break-up). Plan to keep the element with the SD
   pilot straight and level while the other element separates.
7.10. Armament System Malfunctions.
   7.10.1. Inadvertent Release. Release due to a malfunction of the armament system.
      7.10.1.1. Record switch positions at the time of inadvertent release and provide to
      armament and safety personnel. Record the impact point, if known.
      7.10.1.2. Safe the armament switches and do not attempt further release. Treat
      remaining stores as hung ordnance and follow hung ordnance procedures during RTB.
      7.10.1.3. If remaining stores present a recovery hazard, jettison them in a suitable area on
      a single pass, if practical.
   7.10.2. Failure to Release/Hung Ordnance. If ordnance fails to release when all
   appropriate switches are set, proceed as follows.
      7.10.2.1. Attempt to release store(s) IAW T.O. 1F-22AC-34-1CL-1. If unsuccessful, and
      there is NOT an unsafe condition, then follow hung ordnance recovery procedures.
      7.10.2.2. If an unsafe condition exists (attached by 1 lug, etc.), attempt to jettison store(s)
      using selective jettison procedures
   7.10.3. Hangfire/Misfire:
      7.10.3.1. A missile that fires but fails to depart the aircraft is a hangfire. If this occurs,
      the missile should be closely observed and safety checked by a chase pilot.
      7.10.3.2. A missile that fails to fire when all appropriate switches were selected is a
      misfire. If this occurs, safe the Master Arm switch and follow the hung ordnance
      recovery procedures.
   7.10.4. Hung Ordnance/Weapons Malfunction Recovery:
36                           AFI11-2F-22AV3_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 4 NOVEMBER 2009


        7.10.4.1. If practical, visually inspect the area for damage to aircraft, WBDs, or
        ordnance.
        7.10.4.2. Declare an emergency for hung live ordnance (not required for hung
        practice/inert ordnance or when no attempt was made to expend live ordnance).
        7.10.4.3. If available, obtain a chase aircraft (N/A at night unless NVG-Capable chase is
        available) and avoid populated areas and close trail formations.
        7.10.4.4. Close weapons bay doors prior to landing IAW T.O. 1F-22AC-34-1CL-1
        7.10.4.5. Land from a straight-in approach.
     7.10.5. Miscellaneous Procedures:
        7.10.5.1. Pilots will not attempt to expend ordnance using a delivery system with a
        known weapons release malfunction.
        7.10.5.2. When abnormal missile launch or erratic missile flight is noted after launch,
        visually inspect the launching aircraft by another pilot (if possible) to determine if any
        damage has occurred.
7.11. Post Arresting Gear Engagement Procedures.
     7.11.1. Do not shut down the engine(s) unless directed by the ground crew, there is a fire, or
     other conditions dictate.
     7.11.2. Raise the tailhook on the ground crew's signal.
     7.11.3. Do not taxi until directed.
     7.11.4. Comply with local directives.
7.12. In-flight Practice of Emergency Procedures.
     7.12.1. Simulated Emergency Procedure is defined as any procedure that produces an effect
     that closely parallels an actual emergency, such as retarding the throttle to simulate the drag
     equivalent to a flamed out engine.
     7.12.2. Aborted Takeoff Practice. Only practice aborted takeoffs in a simulator (Full
     Mission Trainer (FMT), Weapons and Tactics Trainer (WTT), Cockpit Procedures Trainer
     (CPT), or Distributed Mission Operations Simulator (DMO).
     7.12.3. Simulated in-flight loss of both engines is prohibited.
     7.12.4. Practice in-flight engine shutdown is prohibited.
     7.12.5. Emergency Landing Patterns (Refer to AFI 11-202 Volume 3).
        7.12.5.1. Field Requirements. Practice of emergency landing patterns at active airfields
        is authorized provided that crash rescue and air traffic control facilities are available and
        in operation.
        7.12.5.2. Supervisory Requirements. IQT (including FTU) pilots require an IP in a
        chase aircraft. MQT (including FTU) pilots require a SOF in place and an IP or flight
        lead monitoring from the traffic pattern.
        7.12.5.3. Pattern Procedures:
AFI11-2F-22AV3_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 4 NOVEMBER 2009                                                 37


           7.12.5.3.1. Include the type of practice emergency pattern in the gear check call.
           7.12.5.3.2. Initiate practice single-engine go-arounds in sufficient time to ensure the
           aircraft does not descend below 300 feet AGL. Simulated single-engine approaches
           may descend below 300 feet AGL provided the approach terminates in a full stop
           landing or the go-around from a low approach or touch and go landing is performed
           with both engines. When conducting such training, the pilot will advise the
           appropriate air traffic controller of his intentions.
           7.12.5.3.3. Simulated single-engine patterns may be practiced while flying. HUD-
           off, SRB and Standby Flight Group approaches will only be practiced in the FMT,
           WTT, or CPT.
7.13. Search and Rescue (SARCAP) Procedures. If an aircraft crashes, immediately attempt
to locate possible survivors and initiate rescue efforts. Expect that the survivors may initially
suffer from shock or have delayed reactions due to ejection injuries. The following procedures
are by no means complete and should be adjusted to meet each unique search and rescue
situation.
   7.13.1. Knock off maneuvering.
   7.13.2. Establish a SARCAP commander.
   7.13.3. Squawk 7700 to alert ATC/GCI of the emergency situation.
   7.13.4. Communicate the emergency situation and aircraft/flight intentions immediately to
   applicable control agencies. Use GUARD frequency if necessary.
   7.13.5. Mark the last known position of survivors/crash site using any means available
   (Markpoint, TACAN, INS, ATC/GCI position and/or visual references).
   7.13.6. Remain above the highest ejection altitude, if known, or the highest observed
   parachute until determining the position of all possible survivors.
   7.13.7. Deconflict other aircraft assisting in the SARCAP by altitude to preclude midair
   collision. Establish high/low CAPs as necessary to facilitate communications.
   7.13.8. Revise BINGO fuels or recovery bases as required to maintain maximum SARCAP
   coverage. Do not overfly the adjusted BINGO fuel.
   7.13.9. Relinquish SARCAP operation to designated rescue forces upon their arrival.
   7.13.10. Follow local or briefed procedures.

                                            Chapter 8

                            LOCAL OPERATING PROCEDURES

8.1. General. This chapter provides a consolidated framework for wings to supplement (IAW
33-360) local operating procedures. Units composed of multiple aircraft types may publish
guidance in a single, stand-alone local operating instruction instead of supplementing this AFI.
Added or stand-alone procedures will not be less restrictive than those contained elsewhere in
this volume. This chapter is not intended to be a single source document for procedures
contained in other directives or regulations. Avoid unnecessary repetition of guidance provided
in other established directives; however, reference to those directives is acceptable when it serves
to facilitate the location of information. This chapter is authorized to be issued to each pilot.
Units may supplement the following paragraphs for local operating guidance:
     8.1.1. Section A. Introduction.
     8.1.2. Section B. General Policy.
        8.1.2.1. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) Section A. Introduction.
            8.1.2.1.1. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) Purpose. This chapter establishes local
            operating procedures for pilots who fly 49th Fighter Wing (49 FW) F-22 aircraft. In
            addition to this document, pilots must be familiar with the procedures in Holloman
            AFB Instruction (HAFBI) 11-250, Airfield Operations and Base Flying Procedures,
            the Holloman Basic In-Flight Guide (IFG), and the Holloman Raptor IFG
            Supplement.
            8.1.2.1.2. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) Revisions/Exceptions.                  Submit
            recommendations for changes on AF Form 847 to the 49 OG/OGV. Waiver authority
            is 49th Operations Group Commander (49 OG/CC).
        8.1.2.2. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) Section B. General Policy. This supplement
        complements higher headquarters regulations/directives. It is not intended as a single-
        source document. When deployed, comply with local procedures for the temporary duty
        (TDY) location or these procedures, whichever are more restrictive.
        8.1.2.3. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) Section C. Ground Operations.
            8.1.2.3.1. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) Off-Station Sorties.
               8.1.2.3.1.1. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) Reference guidance contained in the
               49 FW IFG F-22 Annex and AFI 11-209, Aerial Event Policy and Procedures
               (static displays).
               8.1.2.3.1.2. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) Pilots will request and coordinate
               cross-country flights using the 49 FW Cross-Country Request form (Form 40).
               Pilots will e-mail the completed form to the SQ/CC or SQ/DO. Once the SQ/CC
               or SQ/DO obtains 49 OG/CC approval, the request will be forwarded to 49th
               Operations Support Squadron Current Operations Flight (49 OSS/OSO) with
               courtesy copies to 49th Fighter Wing Command Post (49 FW/CP), 49 OG/CC,
               and 49th Maintenance Group (49 MXG). Prior to departure, flight leads will
               ensure 49 FW/CP has received a copy of their itinerary and will notify 49 FW/CP
AFI11-2F-22AV3_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 4 NOVEMBER 2009                                         39


          of any changes at the earliest opportunity.
          8.1.2.3.1.3. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) Fuel: Obtain a gold AirCard
          (commercial airports) and white card (military airfields) from maintenance prior
          to departing Holloman AFB. Obtain a fuel receipt from each location and save
          for documentation upon return to Holloman.
       8.1.2.3.2. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) Flight Plans.
          8.1.2.3.2.1. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) Refer to the HAFBI 11-250 and the
          Holloman IFG for stereo flight plans, departures, and ATC procedures. File flight
          plans through squadron operations to Airfield Management Operations (AM Ops).
          8.1.2.3.2.2. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) Pilots will coordinate any real-time
          flight plan changes through squadron operations. Squadron ops will then pass the
          changes to AM Ops. Once the flight plan change is in the system, ground control
          will notify pilots to contact Clearance Delivery.
       8.1.2.3.3. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) Mission Planning.
          8.1.2.3.3.1. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) If an alternate is required, compute
          bingo fuel to arrive at the Final Approach Fix (FAF) of the designated 49 FW
          divert base with 2,000 pounds of fuel remaining. Plan this reserve to remain
          outside of Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum (RVSM) airspace. Refer to the
          49 FW IFG F-22 Annex for recommended bingo fuels from local flying areas.
          8.1.2.3.3.2. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) High Winds Restriction for Flying
          Operations.
             8.1.2.3.3.2.1. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) Flying operations are prohibited

             is 49 OG/CC.
       8.1.2.3.4. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) Personal and Life Support Equipment.
          8.1.2.3.4.1. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) Use of the pilot survival vest by 49
          FW pilots during training, cross country or CONUS contingency sorties will be at
          the discretion of the squadron commander. The squadron commander may dictate
          the wear of the survival vest based on adverse weather or flight conditions. (EX:
          Consider wearing survival vests during night training with bad weather, during
          cold weather operations, during northern tier ONE missions, etc).
          8.1.2.3.4.2. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) 49 FW pilots are required to carry the
          following current Tech Order and Flight Information Publications (FLIP) while

           DANGER if wearing anti-exposure suits.
        8.1.2.3.5.2. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) Upon declaration of FITS DANGER,
        squadron supervisors will limit preflight/cockpit/ramp time (non-air-conditioned)
        to 45 minutes. If the pilot exceeds 45 minutes, he will return to an air-conditioned
        facility for a minimum of 30 minutes, and only return to the aircraft with
        squadron supervisor approval.
        8.1.2.3.5.3. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) Pilots are not necessarily restricted
        from stepping to spare aircraft nor limited to flying fewer sorties when FITS
        zones have been declared. Squadron supervisors will evaluate and make these
        decisions on a case-by-case basis.
        8.1.2.3.5.4. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) If the FITS exceeds 115º F, all non-
        essential flights will be canceled.

       8.1.2.3.6. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) Taxi Procedures.
          8.1.2.3.6.1. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) Acknowledge receipt of Automated
          Terminal Information Service (ATIS) and clearance when calling for taxi. For
          example; "Holloman Ground, Raptor 71, taxi two from the Canyon with Bravo
          and clearance."
          8.1.2.3.6.2. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) Maximum taxi speed is 30 knots. The
          maximum speed in the West Area, in congested areas, or when turning, is 10
          knots. Use caution when taxiing on the west ramp due to taxiway slope.
          8.1.2.3.6.3. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) Minimum Runway Condition Report
          (RCR) for taxi is 8 with a minimum RCR of 12 for takeoff.
          8.1.2.3.6.4. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) Hangar procedures.                    Both hangar
          doors must be open prior to engine start. Do not start the auxiliary power unit
          (APU) in hangars without the APU exhaust system in place. Visually check and
          verbally confirm with the crew chief the APU exhaust system is fully retracted
          prior to taxi. If the APU is required during taxi into or out of the hangar, the pilot
          will ensure that the minimum practical time is spent with the APU running and
          the APU exhaust system not in the lowered position. In no case shall this time
          exceed 5 minutes.
          8.1.2.3.6.5. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) Live Load Procedures. The only
          munitions that may be loaded in the West Area are chaff/flare, 20MM TP/HEI,
          inert bombs and captive carry missiles. The Main Ramp (or live load areas) must
          be used to load telemetry equipped missiles without live warheads. For live
          bombs and missiles the loading areas are EOR Echo (primary), GAF live load
          (secondary) and Runway 25 (tertiary). All aircraft will be loaded IAW AFMAN
          91-201 and approved Holloman AFB Explosive Site Plans.
          8.1.2.3.6.6. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) When armed in EOR Echo with live
          JDAM, aircraft will be parked on the 12” by 12” square live load markings. The
          standard EOR Echo yellow taxi lines do not provide minimum explosive safety
          distance.
       8.1.2.3.7. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) Quick Check/Arming.
          8.1.2.3.7.1. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) All aircraft will stop in the arming
          area for quick check/arming.
          8.1.2.3.7.2. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) The lead aircraft enters the arming slot
          as depicted in the Holloman AFB Basic In-Flight Guide. In general, it will be the
          slot farthest from the runway. Subsequent aircraft will take the next available
          slot. Pull forward to place the nose wheel on the proper mark, which will allow
          subsequent aircraft to taxi behind and in front of arming aircraft.
          8.1.2.3.7.3. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) Keep hands in view of the ground
          crew anytime arming crews are under the aircraft. Visual signals will be used if
          intercom is not connected.
       8.1.2.3.8. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) After Landing/Dearming.

           8.1.2.3.8.1. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) All local aircraft will dearm when
           carrying live Air-to-Air weapons, hot gun, and/or any unexpended live/inert
           GBU-32(s). In any case, this will be non-standard and prior coordination will be
           needed with maintenance for arm/de-arm locations. For local training sorties, de-
           arm will not be utilized (see para 8.1.2.3.8.4).
           8.1.2.3.8.2. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) Contact Ground Control and advise
           taxi to park (or de-arm, as required). De-arm/Arming flow will be as depicted in
           the Holloman AFB In-Flight Guide. In general, the first aircraft to clear will
           utilize the de-arming/arming slot farthest from the runway. Do not block the
           runway or taxiway while waiting for a de-arming/arming slot.
           8.1.2.3.8.3. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) During normal recovery and landing
           on runway 16, TOP 3 will coordinate with applicable agencies in order to ensure
           taxiway Hotel is swept and vehicle traffic is blocked from proceeding onto Hotel
           to allow aircraft to taxi west on Hotel to the hangars. Confirm with Tower that
           taxiway Hotel procedures are in affect prior to taxiing on Hotel.
           8.1.2.3.8.4. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) During normal training missions when
           dearm is not required but flares have been expended, aircraft will open EXCM
           doors prior to taxi into the hangars.
     8.1.2.4. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) Section D. Flying Operations.

           operations of line-up or aircraft changes. Squadrons will pass updates to the SOF.
           8.1.2.4.1.2. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) If a flight member aborts and will not
           attempt a later takeoff, the flight lead may renumber the flight. The flight lead
           will advise squadron operations of the new lineup. Squadrons will inform the
           SOF.
           8.1.2.4.1.3. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) All flights will use approved squadron
           call signs assigned by 49 OSS/OSOS.

           8.1.2.4.2.1. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) Pilots will fly a maximum of 3 sorties
           per day (2 if any part of one is at night).
           8.1.2.4.2.2. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) During                    Operational       Readiness
           Exercises/Inspections, with SQ/CC or SQ/DO approval, pilots may fly 4 sorties
           per duty day if all are in the daytime; 3 sorties if any are flown at night.
        8.1.2.4.3. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) Alternate Missions.
           8.1.2.4.3.1. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) The alternate mission must be less
           complex than the primary mission and parallel with its intent. If not similar, brief
           the specific mission elements that are different. Mission elements/events may be
           modified and briefed "airborne" as long as flight safety is not compromised;
           however, avoid exercising this option to the max extent practical.

     CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, NUCLEAR, AND HIGH YIELD
                    EXPLOSIVE (CBRNE) OPERATIONS

A2.1. General Information. Potential adversary use of CBRNE weapons against a friendly
airfield presents a serious threat to flying operations. Although the most effective way for
aircrews to avoid this threat is to be airborne before those weapons are detonated/dispersed and
then land at a field that has not been contaminated, all personnel must be prepared to operate
from a field that has come under CBRNE attack.
A2.2. Mission Preparation. Be aware of the status of the CBRNE environment at the planned
launch and recovery airfields, potential divert bases, and throughout the area in which the sortie
may fly. Know the current and forecast surface wind direction and the MOPP level in effect for
relevant sectors of the airfield. Don appropriate aircrew chemical defense equipment (ACDE) or
Ground Crew Ensemble (GCE) to match the appropriate MOPP level (reference AFMAN 10-
100) and carry individual protective equipment (IPE) as required.
A2.3. Stepping to Fly and Aircraft Preflight. This may entail donning ACDE or transitioning
from GCE to ACDE. Take precautions to protect aircrew from injury and or contamination
while in transit from the squadron facility to the aircraft. If possible, transport aircrew in a
vehicle that provides overhead cover (enclosed vehicle). If aircrew travel on foot is unavoidable,
choose a route that takes maximum advantage of available overhead cover (sun shades,
buildings, etc.) to avoid agents that may be settling from the air. If extra aircrew members are
available for preflight duties, consider assigning them to do so wearing GCE. This will allow the
aircrew actually flying to minimize exposure.
     A2.3.1. Alarm Red (or Theater Equivalent) Prior to Engine Start. If Alarm Red occurs
     during the step or preflight process, take cover and don appropriate MOPP. This may require
     use of the ground crew mask. A hardened aircraft shelter (HAS) provides optimum
     protection, if available. Use caution if entering a HAS that contains aircraft and/or
     equipment. Close doors after entry. If a HAS or other overhead cover is not immediately
     available, accept the best rapidly reachable cover.
A2.4. Engine Start to Takeoff. If a HAS is available, use it to minimize exposure time by
accomplishing aircraft arming and End of Runway (EOR) procedures inside it (if local
procedures permit) and by delaying taxi time as long as possible prior to takeoff.
     A2.4.1. Aircraft Launch to Survive (LTS). Units will develop local procedures to provide
     this option to the commander. In general, aircraft may LTS any time after engine start if they
     have sufficient fuel and safe, expeditious access to a runway. This option may only be
     practical for aircraft that are near EOR prior to takeoff or that have just landed.
     A2.4.2. Alarm Red Prior to Taxi. If in a HAS, the normal procedure is to shut down.
     Engine noise may preclude effectiveness of normal alert notification procedures, so ensure
     ground personnel are aware of the alarm warning, assume proper MOPP, and close HAS
     doors. Use hand signals if necessary.
     A2.4.3. Alarm Red (or Theater Equivalent) After Taxi. Units typically establish
     procedures for this contingency depending on whether additional protection is available
     along the taxi route (empty HAS, for instance). Ideally, ground crew sheltering in such a
AFI11-2F-22AV3_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 4 NOVEMBER 2009                                                 55


   HAS would be available to assist in normal engine shutdown procedures and to close HAS
   doors. If protection is not available, the best option may be LTS. Maintain contact with
   Command and Control (C2) entities (Wing Operations Center, Maintenance Operations
   Center, Supervisor of Flying, etc.) to ensure unity of effort in the overall plan.
A2.5. Takeoff to Landing.
   A2.5.1. Contamination. If Chemical Warfare (CW) agent contamination occurred prior to
   takeoff, flying the aircraft will dissipate the agent to some degree. The total amount of
   dissipation will be greater with lower flight altitudes and longer flight times. Because the
   agent may have entered wheel wells, flaps, etc., consider flying in landing configuration to
   increase airflow to these areas. In any circumstances, merely flying the aircraft is unlikely to
   achieve complete decontamination.
   A2.5.2. Preparing to Land. Aircrew should remain aware of the status of primary and
   alternate landing locations. Do not attempt to land during Alarm Red situations unless there
   is no other option. Follow C2 directions and either hold or divert. If mission needs preclude
   divert, hold until the Alarm Red (or theater equivalent) has cleared or become an Alarm
   Black. Prior to landing, gain awareness of contaminated sectors of the airfield and of
   current/forecast surface winds. Use this information in conjunction with C2 direction to plan
   a route from landing to engine shutdown. The liquid deposition phase following a CW
   airburst attack can extend up to 1 hour. If landing during Alarm Black, expect a
   contaminated environment and MOPP 4.
A2.6. Landing to Engine Shutdown. Take advantage of any protection available, minimizing
taxi time and distance. Maintain contact with C2 in order to remain aware of unexploded
ordnance and/or damage to airfield movement surfaces. If a HAS is available and local
procedures permit, accomplish aircraft de-arm and EOR procedures there. If Alarm Red (or
Theater Equivalent) occurs between landing and engine shutdown, considerations are similar to
those discussed in the engine-start-to-takeoff section.
A2.7. After Engine Shutdown. Don appropriate MOPP if not already worn. If circumstances
permit, accomplish normal post-flight inspection procedures. If the aircraft is not contaminated,
close the canopy. If there is any suspicion of personnel contamination, aircrew will process
through an aircrew contamination control area (ACCA). Accomplish maintenance debriefings
under cover to the maximum extent possible.
