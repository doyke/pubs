         Policy and Guidance on Command and the Administration of Military Justice

1. Command.

   1.1. Installation Commander. Installation commander is an official position designated by
   administrative orders or command directives. The installation commander is responsible for
   accomplishing duties assigned to that position by U.S. statutes, as well as DoD directives and
   Air Force instructions. AETC installation commanders may delegate duties as they desire,
   with the following exceptions: specific duties relating to courts martial; appointment of
   military magistrates for search and seizure; issuance of barment letters; approval of a U.S.
   Magistrate program to deal with civilian misconduct on the installation; and any other duties
   established by statute which specifically task the installation commander.

   1.2. Relinquishing Command. Absence or disability of an installation commander for
   short periods of time does not prevent that commander from discharging the functions of
   command. Except in rare circumstances, an installation commander should not relinquish
   command. The commander should consider the expected length of the absence and the types
   of command actions and decisions that must be made during the absence prior to
   relinquishment. If the commander will be able to communicate readily with his or her staff
   during the absence, command should not be relinquished. On the other hand, in situations
   where a commander will not be able to communicate readily with his or her staff,
   relinquishment should be considered. Installation commanders will advise AETC/CC or
   AETC/CV prior to relinquishing command.

2. Court Martial Convening Authorities. General Court-Martial Convening Authority
(GCMCA) and Special Court-Martial Convening Authority (SPCMCA) duties are specifically
authorized by position and may not be delegated.

   2.1. GCMCA. AU/CC, 2 AF/CC and 502 ABW/CC are designated by order of the
   Secretary of the Air Force as GCMCAs. As GCMCAs, they are also authorized to exercise
   SPCMCA.

   2.2. SPCMCA. The Secretary of the Air Force has designated the following as SPCMCAs:
   all AETC installation commanders, AFRS/CC, Holm Center/CC, 12 FTW/CC, 37 TRW/CC,
   59 MDW/CC, 80 FTW/CC, 37 TRG/CC, 81 TRG/CC, 82 TRG/CC, 737 TRG/CC,
   782 TRG/CC, and 937 TRG/CC.

        2.2.1. Designation of SPCMCAs. Pursuant to Article 23(a)(4), Uniform Code of
        Military Justice, and Air Force Instruction 51-201, Administration of Military Justice,
        paragraph 2.2.3., the following are appointed as SPCMCAs: 33 FW/CC, 58 SOW/CC,
        314 AW/CC, 502 ISG/CC and 502 SFLSG/CC. For purposes of UCMJ authority over
        tenant units, the 502d ISG will serve as the host command for tenants located on JBSA-
        Lackland and the 502d SFLSG will serve as the host command for tenants located on
        JBSA-Randolph.
         2.2.2. Withholding of Authority: Although designated as SPCMCAs, authority to
         convene courts-martial is withheld from the following commanders: AFRS/CC, Holm
         Center/CC, 12 FTW/CC, 33 FW/CC, 37 TRG/CC, 58 SOW/CC, 59 MDW/CC,
         80 FTW/CC, 81 TRG/CC, 82 TRG/CC, 314 AW/CC, 737 TRG/CC, 782 TRG/CC and
         937 TRG/CC. Pursuant to AFI 36-3208, Administrative Separation of Airmen, these
         commanders may exercise separation authority for enlisted administrative discharge
         actions generated by their units, while authority to convene special courts martial
         remains with the host commander.

3. Nonjudicial Punishment Actions (Article 15). In accordance with the Manual for Courts-
Martial and AFI 51-202, Nonjudicial Punishment, paragraph 2.1, commanders who are
commissioned officers may impose nonjudicial punishment on members of their commands for
minor offenses. Officers in the grade of lieutenant colonel and below may not impose
nonjudicial punishment on officers. Officers in the grade of major and below may not impose
nonjudicial punishment on chief master sergeants or senior master sergeants.

   3.1. Officer Nonjudicial Punishment. Officer nonjudicial punishment actions imposed on
   AETC officers, and administered through AETC channels, will be imposed by no lower than
   the first AETC general officer in the offender’s chain of command. This paragraph does not
   limit the authority of non-AETC host commanders to exercise their concurrent nonjudicial
   punishment authority under AFI 51-202, paragraph 2.4. Officer nonjudicial punishments
   imposed on non-AETC officers pursuant to AETC host command jurisdiction will be
   imposed by no lower than the first AETC general officer in the host chain of command.

   3.2. SNCO Nonjudicial Punishment. AFRS/CC may impose nonjudicial punishment on
   chief master sergeants and senior master sergeants assigned to AFRS, subject to the
   punishment limitations detailed in AFI 51-202, Table 3.1, Note 2. All other nonjudicial
   punishment actions taken against chief master sergeants and senior master sergeants will be
   imposed by the member’s promotion authority. AETC/CC has delegated promotion
   authority to AETC/CV, 2 AF/CC, 502 ABW/CC and AU/CC.

4. Direct requests for any waivers to this policy to AETC/JA.
