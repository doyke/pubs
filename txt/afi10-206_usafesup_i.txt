                                           Chapter 1

             GENERAL CONCEPTS, POLICIES, AND RESPONSIBILITIES

1.1. Concept of the AFOREPS. The set of reports that make up the AFOREPS provide AF and
intermediate commands the information necessary for timely operational decisions. Major
commands (MAJCOM) will integrate their reporting systems into AFOREPS, thereby allowing
easy lateral and vertical transfer of information.
1.2. Reporting Instructions and Principles. The following instructions and principles apply to
the AFOREPS:
    1.2.1. AFOREPS reports draw information from numerous sources (e.g., personnel, materiel,
    equipment status, operations and logistics planning, situation monitoring, and intelligence)
    and give decision makers a concise picture of events. The main criterion for inclusion in the
    AFOREPS system is essential information for command and control of aerospace forces.
    1.2.2. Commands with both an Air Force and a joint or combined reporting requirement
    (e.g., air component commands) will use the AFOREPS and address both chains.
    1.2.3. Annually, AF will review new requirements to determine operational necessity.
1.3. Command Reporting Responsibilities. To identify and streamline host-tenant
responsibilities, host units will establish host-tenant agreements that meet the needs of both
organizations. This may be accomplished with either a Host Tenant Support Agreement (HTSA)
or Memorandum of Agreement (MOA). Commanders are responsible for timely and accurate
reporting for all events/incidents that meet Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) reporting
criteria (PINNACLE), CSAF reporting criteria (BEELINE), and MAJCOM/CC reporting criteria
(HOMELINE) for all assigned or attached units, as well as units staging through their command.
The agreement will establish procedures to ensure the installation commander is made aware of
all events/incidents occurring on or affecting their installation. Agreements must adhere to the
following stipulations as a minimum.
    1.3.1. Ensure established procedures do not delay the submission of OPREP-3 reports.
    1.3.2. Outline specific operational report (OPREP-3) responsibilities of host and tenant
    command posts (CP) units, i.e., 1C3s functioning as a CP entity such as an Air Operations
    Center (AOC), (including who will submit the reports and procedures based on OPCON),
    with emphasis on timely and accurate report submission.
    1.3.3. Installations operating under a single MAJCOM. Installations with one CP and one or
    more tenant units will establish an agreement that all OPREP-3 reports will be submitted by
    the host command post. The commander or delegate (O-4 or higher) operating the CP
    submitting the report will approve OPREP-3 reports prior to submission.
    1.3.4. Installations operating with multiple MAJCOMs. Tenant commanders assigned to a
    different MAJCOM than the host unit, have the sole responsibility to report an event/incident
    affecting their assets that meet OPREP-3 reporting criteria. Tenant commanders may waive
    approval/release authority for BEELINE and PINNACLE reports to the host/installation
    commander. A memorandum of agreement between the host and tenant wings with
    concurrence of the parent MAJCOMs is required. Tenant unit commander retains
AFI10-206_USAFESUP 14 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                          9


   approval/release authority for HOMELINE reporting. The commander or delegate (O-4 or
   higher) responsible for the report will have approval/release authority for all OPREP-3
   reports affecting his/her assets. When submitting a report for the tenant/s, the host CP will
   not interfere with, alter, or delay the tenant unit’s report.
   1.3.5. Ensure OPREP-3 reports have all required addresses, including the affected (host or
   tenant) MAJCOM command center, and affected units and MAJCOMs.
   1.3.6. Provide copies of the MOA to the host and tenant MAJCOMs, IAW MAJCOM
   procedures. MAJCOMs will maintain a current copy of the agreement on file.
   1.3.7. MAJCOMs, direct reporting units (DRUs), field-operating agencies (FOAs), Air
   Force Reserve Command (AFRC), and Air National Guard (ANG) personnel will develop
   instructions to ensure timely and accurate OPREP-3 reporting. Geographically Separated
   Units (GSUs) that do not fit under any of the above criteria will comply with parent
   MAJCOM guidance IAW this instruction.
      1.3.7.1. (Added-USAFE) In accordance with AFI 10-207_USAFESUP, USAFE
      Command Posts, each main operating base (MOB) is responsible for establishing
      procedures to ensure applicable geographically separated units (GSU) under their control,
      as well as expeditionary units under their purview, have up and down-channel reporting
      capabilities. GSU commanders or senior ranking military member will ensure a 24-hour
      point of contact (POC) is available to relay time-sensitive information to the servicing
      MOB CP when the Unit Control Center (UCC) is not activated. If the incident requires
      an OPREP-3, the MOB CP will prepare and submit the OPREP-3 and address the GSU
      commander and other agencies, as applicable. EXCEPTION: GSUs (i.e., Munitions
      Support Squadron (MUNSS)) that have a command post will be responsible for
      submitting their own reports.
      1.3.7.2. (Added-USAFE) The MOB CP will establish specific requirements,
      responsibilities and reporting criteria for GSUs. The MOB CP will also furnish the GSU
      UCC/POCs with appropriate reporting matrixes, as required. MOB CPs and tenant units
      will maintain a current copy of local procedures/memorandum of agreements (MOA),
      and will review those procedures semi-annually.
   1.3.8. Air Force component commanders of combatant commands and/or Joint Task Force
   (JTF) will develop written guidance to ensure compliance with this instruction within their
   command and de-conflict with combatant/JTF command directives.
1.4. Authority and References:
   1.4.1. Authority. This instruction includes the requirements of the various documents of the
   Joint Reporting System. Air Force units will use AFI 10-206 as the primary source for
   reporting instructions.
   1.4.2. Emergency Status Codes (ESC). These codes serve as a guide for reporting under
   emergency and crisis conditions. Each chapter reflects the ESC required for each type report.
   AFI 33-324, The Information Collections, and Reports Management Program: Controlling
   Internal, Public, and Interagency Air Force Information Collections prescribe ESC. Later
   chapters identify reference materials for specific reports. The phrase ―Continue reporting
   during MINIMIZE‖ or "Discontinue reporting during MINIMIZE‖ will be entered before the

     beginning of the narrative of the text. ESC does not apply to chapter 11,
     HURRICANE/TYPHOON CONDITION (HURCON/TCCOR) REPORTING.
       1.4.2.1. Status Code ―D‖ indicates: Immediately discontinue reporting data requirements
       during emergency conditions.
       1.4.2.2. Status Code ―C1‖ indicates: Continue reporting during emergency conditions,
       priority precedence. Submit data requirements in this category as prescribed or by any
       means to ensure arrival on the established due dates.
       1.4.2.3. Status Code ―C2‖ indicates: Continue reporting during emergency conditions,
       normal priority. Submit data requirements in this category as prescribed or by any means
       to ensure arrival on the established due dates.
       1.4.2.4. Status Code ―C3‖ indicates: Continue reporting during emergency conditions,
       delayed precedence. Submit data requirements in this category as prescribed, but they
       may be delayed to allow the submission of higher precedence reports. Submit by non-
       electronic means, if possible.

2.2. Transmitting Reports During Combat or Combat Related Operations. When combat
or combat-related operational requirements make speed of delivery paramount, military
commanders may modify transmission of classified information as necessary to meet local
conditions. (When doing so, commanders will cite at the end of the message "CJCSM 3150.03,
Joint Reporting Structure Event and Incident Reports, Enclosure A, paragraph 4a," as the
authority.)
2.3. Operating in a Degraded Communications Environment. AF may suspend the
submission of selected reports.
2.4. Report Formats. Prepare voice and record copy reports IAW CJCSM 3150.03, MIL-STD-
6040 (USMTF), AFI 10-206, AFI 33-324, and Air Force Records Information Management
System (AFRIMS) Website: https://afrims.amc.af.mil. When MIL-STD-6040, does not
contain a specific format for the record copy report, use the General Administration
(GENADMIN) format with the report's name as the SUBJECT
     2.4.1. Units are encouraged to establish an account on the Defense Information Systems
     Agency (DISA) web site (https://www.us.army.mil/suite/page/441756) in order to receive
     the latest United States Message Text Format (USMTF) Baseline (publications and
     software). Units can also obtain a downloadable copy of the USMTF on the Command Post
     AF Knowledge Now website (https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil)
     2.4.2. CPs will use the USMTF editor provided in DMS/AMHS and/or USMTF Joint
     Mission Planning System (JMPS) Common Operating Environment (COE) Message
     Processor (CMP) software available on the DISA web site to build and submit reports.
2.5. Correction of Reports. The originator will submit a correction (CORR) if an error is
noticed after submitting a report. Annotate the report numbers in the same fashion as a follow up
report; if the initial report was 001 annotate the CORR as ―CORR 001‖. Correction reports will
include the information from the previous report with the corrected changes. The corrected
report will be classified according to its content. Identify a corrected report by placing "CORR"
in the third field of the TIMELOC set.
2.6. Electronic Storage. If paper copy reports are not filed, all received/transmitted OPREP-3
reports will be stored in electronic format in a central location; i.e. on Defense Message System
(DMS/AMHS) capable computer, removable media, or on a network drive. Retained reports
must contain all sections of the message and the addresses to which it was sent. Separate the
reports into folders bearing the month in which the report was transmitted. Retain the reports for
1-year with each successive month from the current year replacing the previous year, reference
AFRIMS, T 10-10 R 06.00, Event/Incident Reports (Operations Report [OPREP]-3H/B/P). The
AFSWC maintains an annual archive of all reports received on the AFOG classified/SIPRNET
website, (http://www.a3a5.hq.af.smil.mil/a30/a300/archive.html). The AFSWC’s annual
archive is not a substitute for local archival, units must maintain a record of all reports locally.
2.6. (USAFE) Electronic Storage. Units maintaining electronic copies as the primary storage
method will ensure that all reports are backed up by a secondary method (i.e., removable hard
drive, hard copy print outs).
2.7. Digital Signature and Encrypting E-mail. All message traffic transmitted via email
should have the digital signature and encryption options activated, reference AFI 33-119, Air
Force Messaging. All units and MAJCOMS will have their personnel added to their
AFI10-206_USAFESUP 14 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                     13


organizations ―Role Based Certificate‖. The ―Role Based Certificate‖ is a pool of names with
permission to sign/encrypt on behalf of the organization. ―Role Based Certificate‖ are
established through local communication support agencies.
2.7. (USAFE) Digital Signature and Encrypting E-mail.OPREP-3s will be sent from the CP
organizational mailbox.

                                               Chapter 3

                           EVENT/INCIDENT REPORT (OPREP-3)

3.1. Subject and Purpose. CPs uses the OPREP-3s to immediately notify commanders of any
significant event or incident that rises to the level of DoD, AF, or MAJCOM interests. Submit
the applicable OPREP-3 regardless of whether or not the event is being reported through other
channels. OPREP-3 reports do not replace the requirement for more detailed reports such as the
Aircrew/Aircraft Loss Report (LOSREP), the Commander's Situation Report (SITREP), and
accident or incident investigation reports. Submitting an OPREP-3 report does not change nor is
a substitute for any report required by other directives.
3.2. Report Categories. OPREP-3 reports categorize events or incidents according to their
nature. FLAGWORDs associated with each category aid prompt transmission, processing, and
distribution of the reports by alerting people to their importance. The following flag word
reports make up the OPREP-3 system.
     3.2.1. PINNACLE (OPREP-3P). This message is used by any unit to provide the National
     Military Command Center (NMCC) and, as appropriate, combatant commands and services
     with immediate notification of any incident or event where national-level interest is
     indicated. The general OPREP-3P report is used for situations that do not require reporting
     via other OPREP-3P reports listed in subparagraphs 3.2.2. through 3.2.9. This report is not
     restricted to operational information. Any inadvertent, accidental, unauthorized, or
     unexpected event or incident will be reported if it:
        3.2.1.1. Generates a higher level of military action.
        3.2.1.2. Causes a national reaction.
        3.2.1.3. Affects international relationships.
        3.2.1.4. Is clearly against the national interest.
        3.2.1.5. Affects current national policy.
        3.2.1.6. Involves unidentified objects detected by a missile warning system
     3.2.2. PINNACLE NUCFLASH (OPREP-3PNF). Used to report an event, accident, or
     incident that could create the risk of a nuclear war. This message has the highest precedence
     in the OPREP-3 reporting structure. Report any of the following as an OPREP-3PNF:
        3.2.2.1. Ballistic missile launch or space launch.
        3.2.2.2. Space objects reentering the earth’s atmosphere.
        3.2.2.3. Loss, potential loss or degradation of US military space capability when the loss
        or degradation is because of actions by a suspected or known hostile source.
        3.2.2.4. Reports of cruise missiles or non-friendly, non-US or non-allied aircraft not on
        an approved flight plan that could pose a threat.
        3.2.2.5. Accidental, unauthorized, or unexplained incident involving possible detonation
        of a nuclear weapon.
AFI10-206_USAFESUP 14 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                        15


     3.2.2.6. Unauthorized flight or deviation from an approved flight plan, by a US nuclear-
     armed or nuclear-capable aircraft with the capability to penetrate the airspace of another
     nuclear-capable country.
  3.2.3. PINNACLE FRONT BURNER (OPREP-3PFB). Used to report pre-conflict
  occurrence of armed attack, harassment, or hostile action against US forces, territory, or
  interests.
  3.2.4. PINNACLE BROKEN ARROW (OPREP-3PBA). Used to report a US nuclear
  weapon accident that does not create the risk of a nuclear war. Report any of the following
  as an OPREP-3PNF:
     3.2.4.1. Nuclear detonation of a US nuclear weapon.
     3.2.4.2. Non-nuclear detonation or burning of a nuclear weapon.
     3.2.4.3. Radioactive contamination from a US nuclear weapon or component.
     3.2.4.4. The jettisoning of a US nuclear weapon or component.
     3.2.4.5. Public hazard, actual or implied, from a US nuclear weapon or component.
  3.2.5. PINNACLE EMPTY QUIVER (OPREP-3PEQ). Used to report the seizure, theft, or
  loss of a nuclear weapon.
  3.2.6. PINNACLE EMERGENCY DISABLEMENT (OPREP-3PED). Used for reporting
  operations involving the command disablement or nonviolent disablement of nuclear
  weapons.
  3.2.7. PINNACLE EMERGENCY EVACUATION (OPREP-3PEV).                          Used to report
  operations involving the emergency evacuation of nuclear weapons.
  3.2.8. PINNACLE COMMAND ASSESSMENT (OPREP-3PCA).                         Used to report a
  combatant commander’s assessment of a developing or potential crisis.
  3.2.9. LERTCON STATUS OF ACTION (OPREP-3LSOA). Used to immediately notify
  the NMCC of combatant commander’s actions relative to the alert condition of their forces.
  When this report is sent from AF and/or combatant commands it will be sent as a
  PINNACLE.
  3.2.10. BENT SPEAR (OPREP-3BS). Used to report incidents involving nuclear weapons
  that are of significant interest but are not categorized as PINNACLE NUCFLASH or
  PINNACLE BROKEN ARROW to the appropriate service headquarters. NMCC will be
  added as an ―Info‖ addressee on any OPREP-3BS message or report, a voice report is
  required.
  3.2.11. FADED GIANT (OPREP-3FG). Used to report nuclear reactor or radiological
  accidents or incidents to the appropriate service headquarters. The FLAGWORD
  PINNACLE may be added at any level of command to expedite forwarding of this message
  to the NMCC.
  3.2.12. BEELINE (OPREP-3B). Used to report any event or incident that requires Air
  Force-level interest, but not requiring OPREP-3 PINNACLE reports. Although the report
  normally remains within US Air Force channels, commanders may add other addressees, as
16                                              AFI10-206_USAFESUP 14 SEPTEMBER 2009


     appropriate to avoid duplicate reporting. AF may make BEELINE information available to
     agencies outside the Air Force (e.g., NMCC, State Department) based on the situation.
     3.2.13. HOMELINE (OPREP-3H). Used to report events or incidents, which do not meet
     Air Force-level criteria, but are of interest to the MAJCOM. Although these reports are not
     addressed to HQ Air Force, they are part of the AFOREPS program and will use the same
     basic format. MAJCOMs will determine specific reporting requirements and procedures for
     the HOMELINE report. ANG units report HOMELINE-level information to ANG
     Command Center, unless federalized or mobilized.
     3.2.13. (USAFE) OPREP-3 HOMELINE Reporting Matrix, Attachment 2, provides the
     criteria for determining whether an event/incident is reportable. If the commander feels an
     event/incident should be reported and it does not fall into one of the designated categories,
     the "Commander's Discretion" rule will be used. However, the ―Commander’s Discretion‖
     rule will not be used if another rule fits the incident.
     3.2.14. CRESCENT EDGE (OPREP-3CE). Used to immediately notify the Joint Staff, Air
     Force, or MAJCOM level of significant activities involving Special Access Programs (SAPs)
     operating IAW AFI 16-701, Special Access Programs. Affected unit CPs will submit voice
     reports through normal CP channels. The flag words BEELINE and PINNACLE are used to
     reference the SAP management level to be contacted. Regardless of the SAP management
     level, SAF/AAZ (Air Force Special Access Program Central Office) will be addressed.
     MAJCOMs will establish procedures for contacting program managers at and below the
     MAJCOM level.
        3.2.14.1. The OPREP-3CE report allows units operating SAPs to use the operational
        reporting channel to advise their program managers of events or incidents that meet
        OPREP-3 reporting criteria. The OPREP-3CE report is the single reporting channel for
        all SAP units reporting incidents to higher headquarters. OPREP-3CE reports will be
        forwarded through CP channels to MAJCOM Command Centers, the AFSWC, or the
        NMCC as required depending on the program manager level. Refer to Figure 3.10 to
        view a sample voice report.
        3.2.14.2. The unit with the SAP, not the CP, initiates OPREP-3CE reports. The initiating
        unit will notify the CP that they have an OPREP-3CE report to be submitted. No
        program names or incident details will be included, and CP personnel will not press for
        details. The CP will assign a report number and send the report up the chain to the
        appropriate level. After report submission, the CP requires no other action.
        3.2.14.3. Only the following information will be included in the report:
            3.2.14.3.1. The time the unit initiated the report.
            3.2.14.3.2. The name, phone number, and office symbol of the person at the unit
            initiating the report.
            3.2.14.3.3. The name, phone number, and office symbol of the program manager at
            the appropriate higher headquarters.
        3.2.14.4. An OPREP-3CE report will be submitted when an authorized individual from
        the unit has determined an event or incident involving a SAP, that higher-level awareness
        is warranted.
AFI10-206_USAFESUP 14 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                           17


        3.2.14.4.1. It is the reporting unit’s responsibility, not the CP’s, or wing
        commander’s, to determine the level the report will be submitted, and to provide all
        information IAW paragraph 3.2.14.3 above.
        3.2.14.4.2. The parent MAJCOM, SAF/AAZ, the AFSWC, and/or the NMCC (as
        deemed applicable) is the only addressees permitted on record copy OPREP-3CE
        reports. If report goes to the AFSWC or the NMCC, SAF/AAZ will be addressed.
        3.2.14.4.3. The OPREP-3CE voice and record copy reports will be sent via normal
        reporting channels using FLASH or IMMEDIATE precedence. This report is
        unclassified; however, record copy reports will be digitally signed and encrypted.
  3.2.15. PINNACLE--OPREP-3 WHITE PINNACLE (OPREP-3WP). OPREP-3WP is an
  unclassified exercise FLAGWORD used in exercise messages that contain simulated time-
  critical information from operating forces to the NMCC. The OPREP-3 WHITE
  PINNACLE report is used by the NMCC and combatant commanders to exercise OPREP–3
  procedures as a measure of report timeliness.
     3.2.15.1. Regional Operations Support Division (ROSD), Operations, Training, and
     Exercise (OT&E) Branch, J-3 DDRO, will recommend to unified commands via message
     the number of exercises to be conducted within the assigned period. Unified commands
     will designate the units to receive the exercise message and will select specific exercise
     start times.
     3.2.15.2. Detailed guidance is governed by CJCSM 3150.03. Only unified commands,
     units subordinate to unified commands, and the NMCC participate in this exercise.
  3.2.16. (Added-USAFE) Force Protection Condition (FPCON).
     3.2.16.1. (Added-USAFE) USAFE-wide FPCON changes will normally be transmitted
     to the units via General Administration (GENADMIN) message. Declaration of FPCON
     changes must contain the level to be attained, and list the nation or unit if the declaration
     is limited to an installation or region. Locally directed changes in FPCON status will be
     reported in accordance with (IAW) AFI 10-206.
     3.2.16.2. (Added-USAFE) USAFE units will report FPCON attainment status (hard
     copy) reports as directed in the ―UNFORMATTED INSTRUCTIONS and/or
     INFORMATION‖ line of the message directing FPCON change. Reports will be sent via
     Non-secure Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRNET)/ Secure Internet Protocol
     Router Network (SIPRNET) GENADMIN message, as appropriate, to the USAFE
     Command Center. Additional addressees may be added as necessary. Up-channeled
     FPCON reports will consist of three parts:
        3.2.16.2.1. (Added-USAFE) Part One - Condition Declared - contains the FPCON
        declared and being implemented at the unit submitting the report.
        3.2.16.2.2. (Added-USAFE) Part Two - Completion Time - contains the time the
        unit completed the last action required for attaining the directed FPCON or the word
        ―NONE‖ if reporting a delay in attainment.
        3.2.16.2.3. (Added-USAFE) Part Three - Remarks - contains amplifying remarks
        and is only used when the unit reports a delay in attaining the directed FPCON.
18                                               AFI10-206_USAFESUP 14 SEPTEMBER 2009


        3.2.16.3. (Added-USAFE) FPCON reports will be classified according to content.
     3.2.17. (Added-USAFE) Information Operations Condition (INFOCON).
        3.2.17.1. (Added-USAFE) USAFE-wide INFOCON changes will normally be
        transmitted to the units via GENADMIN message. Declaration of INFOCON changes
        must contain the level to be attained, and list the nation or unit if the declaration is limited
        to an installation or region.
        3.2.17.2. (Added-USAFE) Units will submit INFOCON change reports according to
        the instructions provided in the INFOCON directive.
3.3. Command Responsibilities. Due to the time sensitivity of OPREP-3 information, report
each event/incident as promptly and accurately as possible. If there is doubt, report it. Units at
all levels will develop procedures to quickly obtain and report the key elements of an OPREP-3
report. Since installations normally host units assigned to different MAJCOMs, notification and
coordination procedures between units must be agreed upon. Therefore, host, tenant, and
applicable MAJCOMs will have a MOA on file, IAW paragraph 1.3. Commanders who release
OPREP-3 reports will ensure all agencies under their command receive initial and semiannual
OPREP-3 training.
     3.3.1. CPs will train commanders on all reporting criteria and procedures outlined in this
     instruction. Prior to CP submission, the commander or designated alternate will review all
     OPREP-3 reports in a timely manner.
     3.3.2. The CP is responsible for providing commanders the necessary information to
     facilitate an informed decision and timely OPREP-3 voice and record-copy submissions IAW
     this instruction, reference paragraph
3.4. Report Submission. The first CP having knowledge of an event/incident meeting
BEELINE or PINNACLE criteria will submit the OPREP-3 report. Units will not delay
submission of an OPREP-3 to research if another CP is submitting a report. . When necessary,
the AFSWC may request, through the MAJCOM, that a unit report an event/incident because
that unit is located closest to where the event/incident occurred.
     3.4.1. Voice Reports. Air Force units will submit a voice reports for all INITIAL, FOLUP
     and FINAL reports through the appropriate MAJCOM command center via telephone
     conference. IAW CJCSM 3150.03, all PINNACLE reports will be submitted as soon as
     possible after an event or incident has occurred and sent at FLASH or IMMEDIATE
     precedence. PINNACLE Nuclear Flash reports are extremely time sensitive and require
     initial reporting within 5 minutes of the incident.
     3.4.2. The GOAL for PINNACLE reports (exception is Pinnacle Nuclear Flash, which is 5
     minutes) is to make initial voice reports within 15 minutes of an incident, with record copy
     reports submitted within 1 hour of the incident. For INITIAL HOMELINE/BEELINE
     reports, units will make initial voice reports within 15 minutes of notification, with record
     copy      reports    submitted      within     1     hour    of     the      voice     report.
     HOMELINE/BEELINE/PINNACLE initial record copy reports will contain only as much of
     the requested information as is immediately available. The initial record copy report must
     not be delayed to gain additional information. Follow-up reports will be submitted as
     additional information becomes available.
AFI10-206_USAFESUP 14 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                             19


  3.4.2. (USAFE) Do not delay the initial voice reports by preparing the record copy report
  prior to the voice report.
     3.4.2.1. Normal conferencing procedures for BEELINE and service-level reports will be
     unit-to-MAJCOM-to-AFSWC. Procedures for PINNACLE reports will be unit-to-
     MAJCOM-to-AFSWC-to-NMCC. Because the audible quality of some conferencing
     systems is degraded with each added conferee, the AFSWC will conference in the NMCC
     for PINNACLE reports. For BEELINE reports, if the MAJCOM cannot be reached units
     are to contact the AFSWC directly. For PINNACLE reports, if the MAJCOM/AFSWC
     cannot be reached, units are to contact the NMCC directly. MAJCOMs or lower
     echelons may add additional conferees to conferences as appropriate. Ensure the
     AFSWC is the last conferee added to the conference.
     3.4.2.1. (USAFE) The USAFE Command Center will conference all agencies, as
     required, providing it does not delay report timing requirements. Units submitting
     OPREP-3s are responsible for requesting applicable agencies be added to the voice
     conference and will back brief all appropriate agencies if not included in the
     initial/follow-up OPREP-3 conference(s).
     3.4.2.2. When reporting on any asset assigned to a MAJCOM other than that of the
     reporting unit, ensure the MAJCOM command center owning the asset is included in the
     voice conference and addressed on the record copy report.
     3.4.2.3. MAJCOM command centers will screen HOMELINE reports for possible
     BEELINE criteria. The AFSWC will screen BEELINE reports for possible PINNACLE
     criteria. When in doubt, consult the appropriate MAJCOM or the AFSWC through the
     MAJCOM.
     3.4.2.4. Units submitting the OPREP-3 PINNACLE or BEELINE voice report will
     provide the MAJCOM and the AFSWC the rule number and/or subject of the
     event/incident being reported. Providing the AFSWC with the rule number allows
     preliminary checklist steps to be accomplished prior to the unit beginning the voice
     report. After completion of voice reports, the AFSWC will give a reference time in Zulu
     for record-copy BEELINE reports, and their initials.
     3.4.2.4. (USAFE) Units submitting OPREP-3 HOMELINE voice reports will provide
     the USAFE Command Center the rule number and subject of the event/incident being
     reported.
     3.4.2.5. If MAJCOM command centers are unable to establish a teleconference or the
     unit is reporting a classified report and individual phone calls must be made in lieu of a
     teleconference, the unit will call the highest level organization in the reporting chain first,
     then back-brief all others. When possible, the AFSWC will patch the appropriate
     MAJCOM command center and the NMCC (if applicable) into the conference.
     3.4.2.6. As a minimum, conference the NMCC, STRATCOM, and the AFSWC for
     nuclear related PINNACLE reports. Intermediate command centers will be added to the
     conference if time permits and only if it does not cause a delay in immediately voicing
     these reports to the NMCC. Contact the NMCC at DSN 223-8196 for the Senior
     Operations Officer (primary) or DSN 227-6340 for the EA Cell (secondary). Contact
20                                              AFI10-206_USAFESUP 14 SEPTEMBER 2009


        STRATCOM at DSN 271-1806, Comm. 402-294-1806 or DSN 272-4405, Comm. 402-
        232-4405. Contact the AFSWC at DSN 227-6103 or 223-5511.
        3.4.2.6. (USAFE) Units will request adding EUCOM Joint Operations Center (JOC) to
        all nuclear related PINNACLE voice reports and courtesy copy EUCOM on all related
        record copy reports.
     3.4.3. Record-copy Reports: IAW CJCSM 3150.03, units will submit initial record copy
     PINNACLE reports within 1 hour of the incident. IAW this instruction, submit all record
     copy HOMELINE/BEELINE reports within 1 hour from the voice report. Intermediate
     levels of command will immediately pass the report to subordinate or lateral commands that
     need the information.
     3.4.4. Do not include the following statement: ―The commander has deemed the following
     reportable‖ in OPREP-3 BEELINE or PINNACLE reports.
     3.4.5. Class ―A‖ Mishaps are addressed to all MAJCOM command centers to include ANG
     Command Center using the minimum essential address (MEA) Listing (Attachment 3).
     Additionally, address appropriate MAJCOM command centers to include ANG when
     personnel and/or assets (active, guard or reserve, mobilized or non-mobilized) assigned to
     those organizations are affected. The originating unit is still responsible for ensuring all
     required MEA are in receipt of the record copy, reference paragraph 3.4.
     3.4.6. Intermediate levels of command and or the unit originating the report will
     immediately pass the report to subordinate or lateral commands whose units or assets are
     affected by the event/incident.
     3.4.7. Prompt reporting is imperative. Do not delay INITIAL voice reporting to obtain
     additional information or acquire NAF or HHQ permission. Use record copy and FOLUP
     voice to provide additional information when it becomes available.
        3.4.7.1. INITIAL reports must be timely and concise, but will contain as much
        information as immediately available within established time parameters. Record copy
        reports must thoroughly answer the following questions: who, what, when, where, why,
        and how. Continue reporting until these questions are answered.
        3.4.7.2. When time critical responses to HAF questions are required, the AFSWC may
        contact a unit’s wing commander through the MAJCOM.
     3.4.8. Transmit OPREP-3 reports by the fastest means available consistent with security
     constraints: usually by non-secure voice transmission, followed by a confirming record
     transmission. Ensure reports containing classified or special intelligence information are
     marked properly. OPREP-3s are transmitted via DMS/AMHS/NIPRNET/SIPRNET as
     appropriate. For classified reports, if secure DMS/AMHS and SIPRNET are not available,
     units will notify their MAJCOM command center that the report will be transmitted via
     secure fax. Units will format reports IAW USMTF guidelines. Units will ensure all MEA
     receive the report, regardless of how the report is transmitted. If electronic transmission
     capabilities are not available, faxing the record copy report to the AFSWC can be used to
     meet timing criteria, however electronic transmission is preferred. If the report is sent using
     NIPRNET/SIPRNET e-mail or faxed to the AFSWC, the originating unit is still responsible
AFI10-206_USAFESUP 14 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                             21


   for ensuring all required MEA are in receipt of the record copy. For OPREP-3 PINNACLE
   reports, the AFSWC will ensure the NMCC is in receipt.
   3.4.9. The initial record copy report will contain any updated information gathered after the
   initial voice report without exceeding the time criteria established in paragraph 3.4.2.
   3.4.10. Any actual OPREP-3 report takes precedence over all peacetime exercise
   communications.
   3.4.11. Submission of OPREP-3 reports will not be effected by the imposition of
   MINIMIZE.
   3.4.12. Use the ESC ―C1‖ designator - Continue reporting, priority.
3.5. Report Format and Contents: MIL-STD-6040 gives specific format information for
OPREP-3 reporting.
   3.5.1. The narrative section of each report must clearly convey the details of the incident but
   will not include any speculations about responsibility, failure of equipment or facilities, legal
   liability, causes, quotations or opinions from witnesses or other privileged sources. Use
   Figure 3.1. to assist in gathering and reporting all minimum required events/incident details.
   3.5.1. (USAFE) OPREP-3s will not contain Privileged Safety Information as identified in
   AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports, Chapter 3 or private health data of involved
   individuals protected under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996.
      3.5.1.1. (Added-USAFE) When reporting property or equipment damage, always
      attempt to include a valid cost estimate that has been validated through the safety office.
      However, if a cost estimate is unavailable during initial reporting, DO NOT delay
      submission. Submit a follow-up or final report when estimates are provided; do not
      report unverified cost estimates.
      3.5.1.2. (Added-USAFE) Time permitting, all safety-related messages should be
      reviewed by wing/group safety office for verification and privileged information before
      transmission. DO NOT delay report submission due to safety review or speculation on
      possible mishap causes.
   3.5.2. Include the aircraft type, tail number, owning unit, aircrew unit and squadron, type
   mission, and mission number in all reports that involve Air Force owned, contracted, or
   operated aircraft.
   3.5.3. The first statement in the text of INITIAL record copy reports will state the time the
   CP was notified of the event/incident, and the time the commander or designated alternate
   approved the voice report for CP submission. Example: ―The CP was notified at
   271829ZJUL2005, and the commander approved the voice report at 271818ZJUL2005‖. Do
   not include this information in the voice report.
   3.5.4. The statement ―Further reporting through XXX channels.‖ will only be used after
   consulting and confirming with the appropriate external agency(ies) that further reports will
   be accomplished through their channels, include POC, office symbol and contact number.
   This statement will not be used as a blanket statement and will not be used until all questions
   listed in Figure 3.1., 3.2., and/or 3.3. are answered via OPREP-3 channels.
22                                            AFI10-206_USAFESUP 14 SEPTEMBER 2009


     3.5.5. The AFSWC may request certain questions answered prior to submission of the final
     report. Information requested by the AFSWC that is unknown during the initial voice report
     will be provided (when the information becomes available) in the INITIAL record copy
     report or FOLUP/FINAL voice/hard copy reports.
     3.5.6. Upon request, unit commanders will provide the AFSWC photographs of
     events/incidents via email.
     3.5.7. Units will address all BEELINE/PINNACLE reports with the applicable MEA (refer
     to Attachment 3) combining rules into one report is encouraged. Ensure the MEA for each
     rule number is included in the INITIAL, FOLUP, and FINAL reports. Also, ensure follow-
     up and final reporting lists all applicable rule numbers.
        3.5.7.1. (Added-USAFE) Minimum Addressing. In addition to the required minimum
        essential addressees, units will ensure the following are ―TO‖ addressees on ALL record
        copy reports: USAFE Command Center, USAFE Command Post Policy and Procedures,
        applicable American Embassy, and appropriate major command (MAJCOM) command
        centers (when reporting event/incident affecting other MAJCOM assets) to include ANG
        and AFRC when personnel/assets (active, guard or reserve, mobilized or non-mobilized)
        assigned to those organizations. Communication problems do not alleviate the CP’s
        responsibility to ensure all required addressees receive the report.
        3.5.7.2. (Added-USAFE) EUCOM Joint Nuclear Operations Center (JNOC)
        (jnoc@eucom.smil.mil) and JOC (joc-xo@eucom.smil.mil), will be addressed on all
        nuclear related OPREP-3 record copy reports.
     3.5.8. DMS/AMHS/OPREP-3 Message Subject Line. Units will format the subject line for
     both the NIPRNET and SIPRNET subject line area of the report in this manner.

Table 3.1. DMS/AMHS/OPREP-3 Message Subject Line.
Overall Report         Include ―(U)‖, (C), or ―(S)‖ at the beginning (Reference AFI 33-119, Air
Classification         Force Messaging).
Report type            Specify if HOMELINE, BEELINE, or PINNACLE as applicable.
Report Number          Provide appropriate report number
OPREP-3                Subject of OPREP-3 (reference event/incident category from AFI 10-
Subject/Category       206, Attachment 2, OPREP-3 and Reports Matrix)
Reporting Unit         Provide unit designator, base name, and state (include country for
                       overseas locations)
Subject Classification Include ―(U)‖, (C), or ―(S)‖ at the end (every effort will be made to
                       ensure the subject is unclassified). (Reference AFI 33-119).
Example: (U) BEELINE, 001, GROUND MISHAP, 375 AW/CP SCOTT AFB IL (U)
3.6. Report Numbering. Number OPREP-3 reports consecutively for each calendar year by
type, (i.e. PINNACLE, BEELINE, HOMELINE) beginning with 001. Subsequent reports for the
same incident will add sequential letters to the basic report number (e.g., 002A, 002B, …, 002Z,
002AA, 002AB, …). After the number 999, revert to 001 for the next report. Report numbers
are designed for individual units to track the total number of OPREP-3 reports submitted per
year.
AFI10-206_USAFESUP 14 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                            23


3.6. (USAFE) Report Numbering.OPREP-3 reports and reports logs will be maintained and
disposed of according to AFRIMS.
3.7. Exercise Reports. Number exercise OPREP-3 reports independently of real-world
OPREP-3 reports. Begin exercise reports with 001 at the start of each exercise. Indicate
exercise name in the EXER set of each report.
3.7. (USAFE) Exercise Reports. Units will develop a separate exercise log. Reports will be
numbered sequentially for the duration of the exercise.
   3.7.1. (Added-USAFE) Exercise OPREP-3s will only be up-channeled when specified in
   the exercise plan, directed by the evaluator, directed by operation plans, or when prior
   coordination has occurred with appropriate agencies.
   3.7.2. (Added-USAFE) The last line in exercise reports will read RMKS/EXERCISE
   EXERCISE EXERCISE//except when submitting a classified report. When submitting a
   classified exercise OPREP-3 RMKS/EXERCISE EXERCISE EXERCISE// will precede the
   declassification, or DECL, data set. This does not affect the footer classification markings.
3.8. Initial, Follow-up, and Final Reports. INITIAL reports contain as much information as
immediately available within established time parameters about an event or incident. FOLUP
reports are essential to keep commanders informed of developing situations and to provide
additional details as they are learned. FINAL reports will provide required information not
previously reported and close event/incident reporting. An initial report may be submitted as the
FINAL report if it contains all of the required information to close the report. These reports will
identify INITIAL report status in both the TIMELOC set and add this statement at the end of the
GENTEXT IAW paragraph 3.8.1.
3.8. (USAFE) Initial, Follow-up, and Final Reports.Do not delay OPREP-3 reporting for the
purpose of sending a cosmetically or grammatically perfect report. Awareness of the
event/incident in a timely manner is more important.
   3.8.1. INITIAL, FOLUP, and FINAL reports will close with the applicable phrase, i.e.,
   ―This is a CP INITIAL, FOLUP, or FINAL report.
   3.8.2. Record copy FOLUP or FINAL reports may contain information previously provided
   in one or more voice reports. If a report is upgraded to a higher level, include the verbiage
   from previous reports for that event/incident. Continue reporting as long as the situation
   merits. When the immediacy of the OPREP-3 system subsides, commanders may use
   SITREP reporting to provide continuous information. Include a reference to applicable voice
   and record copy reports in each additional record report.
   3.8.2. (USAFE) If an OPREP-3 HOMELINE report is upgraded a subsequent FINAL
   HOMELINE is not required; the original HOMELINE will be automatically closed out.
   3.8.3. FOLUP reports will be submitted if additional information about the event/incident is
   received and does not complete/close the event/incident.
   3.8.4. FINAL reports will be submitted if the information completes/closes the
   event/incident. FINAL reports will be submitted no later than 30 days after INIT/FOLUP
   reporting has been submitted if no additional information is available. However, units will
   not close out the FINAL report without identifying a follow on agency for continuation of
   information.
24                                             AFI10-206_USAFESUP 14 SEPTEMBER 2009


     3.8.5. FOLUP and FINAL report(s) will contain enough information from the previous
     report(s) to aid the recipient.
     3.8.6. If it is determined that situations will no longer develop, or information sources will
     no longer provide relevant data, units will send the appropriate voice and record report (IAW
     paragraph 3.8.4.) and add the phrase, "No further information is/or will be made available.
     This is a CP final report" to close INITIAL and FOLUP reports.
3.9. Use of Personnel Identification. Do not include the name, social security number (SSN),
or address of individuals in OPREP-3 reports. However, provide the age, gender, duty status
(e.g., active duty, ANG or reserve, state if on or not on Title 10 or 32 orders), rank (if not
military, specify if dependent or DoD/Civilian employee), and assigned unit/agency. If a report
recipient requires names or SSN, request it as an addendum separate from OPREP-3 report
requesting only the last four digits. Exceptions: OPREP-3CE (the name and phone number of
both POCs are required), for aircraft accidents, the name, title, and phone number of safety board
president, for death of a public figure occurring on an Air Force installation, and for death of any
retired flag officer (do not provide names of retired flag officers if death is due to military
operations or the release of names would adversely affect an investigation). Exception: Civilian
Death (the name of the POC in the Civilian Personnel Flight). The Air Force Surgeon General
will ensure medical personnel provide medical related information, relevant to the
event/incident, to AF CPs for all OPREP-3H, B, and P reportable events.
3.10. Upgrading Reports. Units will upgrade OPREP-3 reports if FOLUP information to an
event/incident meets the criteria of a higher-level report (e.g., HOMELINE to BEELINE). Units
will report the INITIAL information and any FOLUP information as a new report. Also, include
any references to earlier reports. In the upgraded INITIAL report, provide all known facts even
if previously reported to the lower level organization. Upgrade reports will require both a voice
and record copy. Close lower level reports when they upgraded. Send all FOLUP reports to the
appropriate MEA addressees.

3.13. The OPREP-3 and Reports Matrix. The OPREP-3 and Reports Matrix (Attachment 2)
is a quick reference guide to assist users in determining the type of report to submit. The
OPREP-3 and Reports Matrix provides broad guidance and is not all-inclusive. Judgment on the
part of local CPs and commanders is essential to proper reporting. Base the level of the report on
whether or not the event or incident will attract national level interest (PINNACLE) or will only
be of interest to AF (BEELINE) or a MAJCOM (HOMELINE). Refer to Figures 3.1 through 3.9
for additional guidance on minimum OPREP-3 report content.
3.14. Guide for Reporting Defense Support to Civil Authorities (DSCA). AF response to
civil emergencies will fall into four categories (Immediate Response, MOU/MOA, 10 Day Rule,
and Disaster/Emergency). Units will report all DSCA events via GENADMIN. All DSCA
GENADMIN messages will address the parent MAJCOM, MEA 1, 3, 41, 60, 61, and 65 as a
minimum. Address other agencies as required. Refer to DoDD 3025.1, Military Support to
Civilian Authorities, DoDD 3025.15, Military Assistance to Civilian Authorities, and AFI 10-
802, Military Support to Civil Authorities, for a more detailed description of DSCA events. The
term DSCA is IAW AFI 10-2501, Air Force Emergency Management (EM) Program Planning
and Operations.
   3.14.1. Report DSCA events IAW Attachment 2, OPREP-3 and Reports Matrix. A DSCA
   GENADMIN message will be submitted as the events occur and as soon as, but no later than
   2 hours, an AF asset responds (departs from base/installation) to a request from civil
   authorities. Units will number the DSCA GENADMIN reports IAW paragraph 3.6. A voice
   report is not required for DSCA reporting, but units will state the following to the
   AFSWC/NMCC as applicable: ―This is the ____ (unit ID and base name); a DSCA
   GENADMIN report has been transmitted for your action‖. Submit a follow up GENADMIN
   message as significant changes or circumstances occur. Assets utilized for more than 24
   hours and/or if media attention occurs, require a follow up DSCA GENADMIN report once
   daily until the DSCA event is terminated or the asset returns to home base/installation.
   Include the following in the text portion of a DSCA GENADMIN message:
       3.14.1.1. Type of support, location, and specific assistance requested or provided.
       3.14.1.2. Estimated duration of military participation in reported event.
       3.14.1.3. Source, date, and time of civil authority’s request for military assistance. Show
       official titles, phone numbers, and e-mail addresses.
       3.14.1.4. Number of USAF personnel (military and civilian) employed in the DSCA.
       3.14.1.5. Amount and types of equipment used.
       3.14.1.6. Amount and types of supplies used.
       3.14.1.7. Title, rank, and telephone/e-mail/fax of unit POC.

        3.14.1.8. Describe the extent of any media interest in the USAF response.
        3.14.1.9. Appropriate DoD or Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
        mission designator, if applicable.
     3.14.2. For major events, submit an SITREP message to AFSWC and applicable MAJCOM
     with the most current information in paragraphs 3.14.1.1 thru 3.14.1.9. in addition, include
     the following information within 10 workdays after DSCA termination.
        3.14.2.1. Assessment of military operations and effectiveness.
        3.14.2.2. Photographs and video of military operations.
        3.14.2.3. Chronological summary of USAF and Civil Air Patrol (CAP) actions to include
        all DoD and FEMA mission numbers performed as Air Force assigned missions IAW
        AFI 10-2701, Organization and Function of the Civil Air Patrol.
        3.14.2.4. Highlights of relief operations, outstanding performers, unusual actions or
        occurrences, or other events of interest for the USAF after action report.
        3.14.2.5. Discussion of specific problem areas encountered and actions recommended
        precluding recurrence in the future.
        3.14.2.6. Summary of relief operations expenses requiring reimbursement.
     3.14.3. Units CP will ensure their installation commander is briefed to ensure their unit
     comptroller is aware of DSCA requests to facilitate reimbursement. The installation
     commander will also ensure base agencies provide the command post with all information
     required to complete the reporting.

with classification appropriate for the message content. Continue to report during MINIMIZE
unless directed otherwise by the implementing authority. Voice or Global Command Control
System (GCCS) may be used to submit this message when DMS/AMHS transmission is not
available.
4.6. General Reporting Instructions. The SITREP is a narrative report that keeps addressees
informed and enables higher levels of command to prepare for potential effects of ongoing
situations.
     4.6.1. Duplicate reporting is not desired; however, information available in another Joint
     Reporting Structure (JRS) report will be referenced to ensure operational impacts are noted.
     4.6.2. Any higher headquarters level in the reporting chain may direct additional reporting
     requirements. The Air Force Operations Group, in fulfilling the CSAF's Title 10
     responsibilities, is authorized to request any necessary additional/amplifying information on
     past events, current operations, or planned actions. A quick response to requests for
     information from the AFSWC, Air Force Crisis Action Team, or CSAF Presentation Division
     is required.
     4.6.3. During peacetime DSCA operations and under hostile conditions such as terrorism,
     comply with paragraph 3.14. and the daily reporting instruction timeline described in the
     supported Combatant Command’s Execute Order.
4.7. Report Content. Air Force SITREPs will evaluate significant factors relating primarily to
readiness, mobilization personnel, force protection, and logistics. Report content should
highlight key activities and build on previous reports. Duplicating or including information to

    COMMUNICATIONS INSTRUCTIONS REPORTING VITAL INTELLIGENCE
                       SIGHTINGS (CIRVIS)

5.1. Subject and Purpose. This report provides vital information to the security of the United
States and Canada which, in the opinion of the observer, requires very urgent defensive action or
investigation by the US and/or Canadian Armed Forces.
5.2. Submitted By. Any Air Force personnel.
5.3. Submitted To:
   5.3.1. Airborne reports: US, Canadian military, or civilian communications facility.
   5.3.2. Post-landing reports: Commander, North American Aerospace Defense Command
   (NORAD), Cheyenne Mt, Colorado, or HQ Northern NORAD Region, North Bay, Ontario,
   Canada, whichever is more convenient. If landing outside Canadian or US territories, submit
   reports through the nearest Canadian military or diplomatic representative or US.
5.4. When Submitted. As soon as possible after the intelligence sighting.
5.5. How Submitted. Reports are normally UNCLASSIFIED but handled as FOUO.
   5.5.1. Use the most rapid means of transmission available. For airborne reports, use the
   same procedures as for air traffic control. When pilots cannot establish contact with a ground
   station, make maximum effort to relay the report via other aircraft.
   5.5.2. To avoid delays while airborne, repeat the word CIRVIS three times before the
   message to preempt all other communications (except distress and urgency). If this fails to
   clear the frequencies, use the International Urgency Signal "PAN" spoken three times. For
   the ground relay of airborne reports or post-landing reports, use FLASH precedence.
   5.5.3. Transmit during MINIMIZE.
   5.5.4. Use the ESC C1 designator- Continue reporting, priority.
5.6. Reporting Instructions:
   5.6.1. Facilities receiving CIRVIS reports will rapidly process and forward them as
   prescribed by NORAD Instruction 10-19.
   5.6.2. Report all unidentifiable, suspicious, or hostile traffic (land, aerospace, or seaborne),
   which, because of its nature, course, or actions, considered a threat to the security of the
   United States or Canada. Such reporting extends the early warning defense system for the
   United States and Canada. There are five types of CIRVIS reports:
       5.6.2.1. Issue initial CIRVIS reports while airborne (or as warranted, upon landing).
       5.6.2.2. Issue post-landing CIRVIS reports if airborne reports made.
       5.6.2.3. Issue follow-up CIRVIS reports by anyone with additional information about an
       earlier report (refer to the initial report).

        5.6.2.4. Issue cancellation CIRVIS reports once sightings are positively identified as
        friendly or determined it was erroneously reported.
        5.6.2.5. Submit evaluation CIRVIS reports to each addressee of the above CIRVIS
        reports. Promptly submit evaluation reports to keep all interested parties fully informed.
     5.6.3. Report the following specific sightings:
        5.6.3.1. Hostile or unidentified aircraft, which appears directed against the United States,
        Canada, or their forces.
        5.6.3.2. Missiles.
        5.6.3.3. Unidentified flying objects.
        5.6.3.4. Hostile or unidentified military surface vessels or submarines.
        5.6.3.5. Any other individual surface vessels, submarines, or aircraft of unconventional
        design engaged in suspicious activity, observed in an unusual location, or on a course,
        which may threaten the United States, Canada, or their forces.
        5.6.3.6. Any unexplained or unusual activity, which may indicate a possible attack
        against or through Canada or the United States (includes the presence of any unidentified
        or suspicious ground parties in remote or sparsely populated areas, including the polar
        region).
        5.6.3.7. Unlisted airfields, facilities, weather stations, or air navigation aids.
     5.6.4. Make every effort to document sightings with as many photographs as possible. Send
     undeveloped film or prints and negatives, with a brief written report and other identifying
     information to the Director of Naval Intelligence, Department of the Navy, Washington, DC
     20305. The Department of the Navy will process the film and return one copy of each print
     and a roll of new film to the individual.
     5.6.5. Use Figure 5.1. to gather and report specific sighting details.

11.1. Hurricane Condition/Tropical Cyclone Conditions of Readiness (HURCON/TCCOR). The
terms ―Hurricane‖ and ―Typhoon‖ are regional specific names for a strong tropical cyclone. Once the
tropical cyclone reaches wind speeds of 74 mph, in the regions of the North Atlantic Ocean or the
Pacific Ocean, east of the international dateline, the storm is called a ―Hurricane‖. In the Northwest
Pacific Ocean west of the dateline, once the tropical cyclone reaches wind speeds of 74 mph the
storm is called a ―Typhoon‖.
11.2. HURCON/TCCOR Levels:
     11.2.1. HURCON 5: Automatic state of preparedness initiated on 1 June of each year.
     11.2.2. HURCON/TCCOR 4: 72 hours prior to possible arrival of sustained 50 KT/58 MPH

       to return to home station.
11.4. Consolidation of Reports. Merging of HURCON/TCCOR reports is permissible when
events outpace the decision process (i.e., a unit experiences a HURCON/TCCOR change and
simultaneously contemplates evacuation; submit an Evacuation Contemplation report and
include the HURCON/TCCOR change). If there is time between stages, 4 hours or more, submit
reports for the required stages. Do not delay reporting in order to submit consolidated reports.
All HURCON/TCCOR reporting is done via the OPREP-3 BEELINE. Reference AFMAN 15-
129, Air and Space Weather Operations - Processes and Procedures.
11.5. Aircraft Evacuation Plans. As a minimum, include the following information when
reporting aircraft evacuation plans:
