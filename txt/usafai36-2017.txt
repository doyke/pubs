1. Why a Scheduling System. Members of the cadet wing must report to various USAF Academy agen-
cies to complete uniform, administrative, training, supply, personnel, and financial requirements. Cadet
Scheduling (USAFA/CWTSA) schedules nonacademic appointments using the Cadet Administrative
Management Information System (CAMIS) database. This instruction is not intended to restrict, in any
way, appointments with health-care providers or access to care for acute illnesses or injuries. This instruc-
tion is also not intended to restrict, in any way, interviews of witnesses or suspects during a law enforce-
ment investigation, by either military or civilian law enforcement officials, where the nature of the
questioning or need to obtain information is considered time critical.

2. Scheduling Limits:
