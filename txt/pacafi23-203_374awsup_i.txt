                                            Chapter 1

                                       INTRODUCTION

1.1. Purpose. The Combat Oriented Supply Organization (COSO) is a decentralized supply
concept for aircraft mission support. COSO procedures promote expeditious parts processing in
a decentralized supply organization in peacetime as well as war in war. NOTE: References to
copies of DD Form 1348-1A, Issue Release/Receipt document may not be applicable for those
bases that have implemented Standard Asset Tracking System (SATS), except during degraded
operations. SATS bases refer to AFMAN23-110, CD Basic USAF Supply Manual, Volume 2,
Part 5 and applicable chapter(s) of Volume 2, Part 2.
1.2. Scope. COSO decentralizes specific direct mission support functions within supply and
maintenance. Primary Operating Stocks (POS), Readiness Spares Packages (RSP), and aircraft
spare parts are located adjacent to the flightline and repair activities. Items Awaiting Parts
(AWP) are stored in the responsible repair shops. Direct accessibility to aircraft parts is provided
to maintenance technicians.
1.3. COSO Organization. COSO decentralizes the materiel control functions, repair cycle
management (RCM), and maintenance supply support (MSS), and storage and issue functions.
Manpower resources to support COSO are sourced primarily from these functions in the LRS.
1.4. Applicability. This instruction is applicable to all PACAF bases. Unless otherwise
specified in an OPLAN/EXPLAN, these procedures apply to PACAF as well as non-PACAF
units deploying to locations within PACAF Theater of Operations. Normal Standard Base
Supply System (SBSS)/Enterprise System-Supply (ES-S) support will be provided to all other
organizations not identified as COSO participants. Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) for
this instruction is HQ PACAF/A4RM. Requests for waivers/deviations to procedures outlined in
this instruction will be submitted to HQ PACAF/A4RM for approval. Approved waivers require
recertification annually. An information copy will be sent to HQ PACAF/A4MM.
1.5. Relationship to Other Publications. This instruction provides organization delineation
and supplemental procedures for a decentralized supply operation and complements the
procedures contained in AFI 21-101 and AFMAN 23-110. Each unit is responsible for the
development of necessary supplements to this instruction to cover local operations. Units will
not change the basic COSO intent or policy without an approved waiver from OPR.
1.6. Basic Objectives/Key Concepts. The basic objectives and key concepts of COSO are:
   1.6.1. Decentralize select Logistics Readiness Squadron (LRS) functions into each
   maintenance/operations flight (MF/OF) and other maintenance sections to provide the
   management tools and expertise to quickly determine visibility over base stocks and thereby
   provide for enhanced asset management and a more effective maintenance operation.
   1.6.2. Place aircraft primary operating stock (POS) and readiness spares (RSP) as close to
   the flightline as possible. This creates an "over-the-counter" distribution method with the
   maintenance technician acquiring and transporting the part. This technique significantly
   reduces the time between request and issue of parts.

     1.6.3. Store POS/RSP in the Aircraft Parts Store (APS) and Flight Service Center (FSC).
     Mobility Readiness Support Package (MRSP) will be configured in a deployable mode if
     mobility tasked.
     1.6.4. Provide Maintenance Supply Support (MSS), Maintenance Flights (MF), and other
     key maintenance organizations with direct processing capability to the supply computer
     system.      Streamline supply and maintenance interface, and provide the supported
     flights/sections visibility over base stocks. NOTE: All maintenance workcenters have access
     to the SBSS/ES-S through the IMDS or G081 and must requisition parts via IMDS/G081.
     1.6.5. Standardize support functions for both peacetime and wartime operations and promote
     realistic operational training and unit readiness. Sufficient shift manning must be provided to
     ensure adequate supply support coverage whenever maintenance is in progress.
     1.6.6. Ensure maintenance turnaround transactions are processed to update repair cycle data.
     1.6.7. Decentralize AWP storage to responsible repair shops to provide maintenance with
     visibility of assets and simplify cross-cannibalization of in-shop assets.
1.7. Forward Stockage Procedures. To achieve COSO objectives, units will store aircraft
spares in the APS, FSC or at option of LRS any area that will best satisfy mission requirements
and provide optimal customer support. The objective is to push all applicable items to forward
locations within the maintenance complex.
     1.7.1. XD/XF Assets: The goal is to place 100 percent of all applicable XD/XF on/off-
     aircraft spares, Line Replacement Units (LRUs), Shop Replacement Units (SRUs), Test
     Station Replacement Units (TRUs), etc., within the APS/FSC.
        1.7.1.1. A conscious decision is required to justify every applicable line item that is not
        moved forward. If space constraints are documented as reason for non-movements,
        elements should have an established program to obtain additional warehouse space/bins;
        this includes classified and pilferable storage.
        1.7.1.2. The ACC214, Issue/Stockage Effectiveness Report, or equivalent local program,
        will be used to measure effectiveness and identify those COSO organization issues
        coming from other than their owning APS/FSC. The listing will be reviewed and
        relocation actions taken. If property is not moved forward an application code "NO" must
        be loaded to the item record. Local codes may also be used to identify reason why (i.e.,
        N1/classified or N2/size). This will prevent a "Z" card from being produced the next
        time the item is issued. The APS and FSC will retain this monthly listing for a minimum
        of 90 days. In addition, bases must process a local computer program at least annually to
        review past decisions on why assets were not moved forward and to determine if assets
        could be relocated based upon improvements in forward storage capacity.
     1.7.2. XB3 Assets. The LRS/LGRM will determine whether XB3 items will be located in
     the APS, FSC or main warehouse.
        1.7.2.1. (Added-374AW) . Based on storage space availability the Aircraft Parts Store
        (APS) will determine whether XB3 parts will be stored in APS after reviewing the
        ACC214 listing.
1.8. Bench Stock Procedures. The development, maintenance, and support of established
bench stocks are the keys to providing uninterrupted consumable support to maintenance
PACAFI23-203_374AWSUP_I 27 JULY 2010                                                             7


workcenters. Organizations may request items be added to their bench stock at any time, by any
method desired by the LRS Customer Service (telephone, letter, annotated listing, etc.). Items
may be added or retained on bench stock based on user's experience/desires regardless of
consumption patterns. In addition, quantities in excess of authorizations may be retained up to
200% of authorizations. Units are encouraged to maintain comparable bench stocks in each MF
for like weapon systems. Local procedures will be established for the workcenters to identify
bench stock problem items to LRS for action. Workcenter bench stock bin labels will have color
standards to aid in user visibility and identification of assets. Maintenance workcenters will fill
their own bench stock requirements through IMDS/G081.
   1.8.1. Routine bench stock requests are processed weekly using IMDS/G081 (screen #120)
   to replenish up to 11 bins per transaction.
   1.8.2. Emergency bench stock requests are processed as required using IMDS/G081 (screen
   #120) to replenish only one bin per transaction.
1.9. Resources/General Requirements. COSO will be supported through the effective use and
distribution of resources.
   1.9.1. Vehicles: Each base’s Vehicle Authorization Utilization Board will approve changes
   to vehicle requirements.
   1.9.2. Terminal Security for Sections outside the LRS Complex. The LRS/CC in
   coordination with the OG/CC AND MXG/CC will authorize specific transactions to be input
   over workcenter terminals. The LRS will ensure suspected terminal security violations are
   reviewed daily (D20, Part Eight - Terminal Security). The D20, Part Eight, reflects inputs
   that were attempted by individuals not authorized to input applicable Transaction
   Identification Codes (TRICs). Violations will be identified to the appropriate squadron
   commander and necessary training conducted to prevent recurrence. Unit commanders who
   have terminals external to the LRS are charged with the responsibility to ensure only
   authorized inputs are made and that physical security is provided.
1.10. Management Responsibility/Involvement. Commanders at all levels are charged with
maintaining good supply discipline and accountability as outlined in AFI 23-111, Management
of Government Property In Possession of the Air Force. Involvement of both maintenance and
supply senior leaders is an absolute necessity to ensure the COSO concept is implemented and
all participants are provided adequate training and resources. Commanders should also seek
measurable ways to improve the effectiveness and responsiveness of the COSO system. For
example, elements should establish "metrics" for such areas as issue effectiveness; number of
items forward stocked versus stocked in the main warehouse, and bench stock "fill" percentages.
   1.10.1. Objectives for metrics mentioned above and other command interest areas are listed
   below:
       1.10.1.1. Parts pickup time for APS and FSC - 15 minutes maximum (based on priority).
       1.10.1.2. Reparable processing time from flightline to MSS - 2 hours.
       1.10.1.3. Reparable processing time from MSS to repair shop/FSC – Mission Capability
       (MICAP) and Two Level Maintenance (2LM) requirements will be moved immediately
       and all others within 2 hours.

        1.10.1.4. Turn-in or have ready for pickup from repair shops to FSC upon status
        determination - 1 hour for serviceable assets and all others within 2 hours.
        1.10.1.5. FSC processing time - 1 hour for serviceable assets, 1 duty day for reparables.
        1.10.1.6. Movement of serviceable assets to stock - 2 hours.
        1.10.1.7. Parts delivery time from other than the APS/FSC - (based on delivery priority).
        Delivery time requirements may be locally established at the option of the commander of
        the delivery function.
        1.10.1.8. Two Level Maintenance items must be processed through the entire repair
        cycle, flightline to TMO, in less than 2 duty days.
        1.10.1.9. Bases operating a scheduled Due In From Maintenance (DIFM) movement
        system and/or time-definite delivery system will supplement this instruction and identify
        unit/organization responsibilities. NOTE: Bases operating a scheduled DIFM
        movement system and/or a time-definite delivery system must continue to move MICAP
        immediately and make a minimum of 2 runs per duty day for all other items.
1.11. Computer Products. The following reports are mandatory:
     1.11.1. The D23, Repair Cycle Asset Management List, or the ACC200, DIFM Record
     Readout, provides a tool to monitor the stock position and flow of XD/XF assets through the
     repair cycle.
     1.11.2. The ACC214 Report provides the capability to review the effectiveness of COSO
     forward stockage policy and to identify possible candidates for forward stockage. It may
     also be used to identify items for bench stock addition.
     1.11.3. The ES-S All Open MICAP Report provides a current list of all MICAP
     requirements with status.
     1.11.4. The Document Validation Report (DVR) is an IMDS/G081/SBSS/ES-S interface
     report that provides the ability to reconcile due-outs recorded in the SBSS/ES-S with all
     supply data records in IMDS/G081. In addition, this program can produce a complete listing
     of the supply data records currently in IMDS/G081.
     1.11.5. The ACC203, Repair Cycle Efficiency Report, provides command and base
     personnel with repair time estimates for Material Support Division (MSD) DIFM items
     (budget code 8).
1.12. Post-Post Processing. All post-post transactions will be processed at a location
designated by the Post-Post Control Team (PPCT) Chief. Maintenance/operations workcenters
that have an issue processing function (e.g., MSS, ISS, AGE, propulsion, etc.) will designate a
PPCT member (primary/alternate). The LRS may supplement this instruction, AFMAN 23-110,
Volume 2, Part 2, Chapter 32, and AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2, Part 11 to provide detailed post-
post operating procedures for all supported activities. Bases will establish a local contingency
plan to include a continuity plan for when IMDS/G081/SBSS is down.
1.13. Deployment/Employment Supply Operations. The LRS/CC and OG/CC AND
MXG/CC will ensure deployment/employment guidance and personnel assignments are current
to support deploying units as directed by operational plans and orders.
PACAFI23-203_374AWSUP_I 27 JULY 2010                                                           9


   1.13.1. The LRS will ensure that any time a Mission Readiness Support Package/Mission
   Spares Kit (MRSP/MSK) is deployed, at least one qualified individual from Supply is
   manifested on the first aircraft containing those assets. NOTE: not applicable to contracted
   LRS.
   1.13.2. When supporting an aviation unit deployment all supply personnel, regardless of
   homestation unit of assignment, should be collocated to allow for personnel cross-utilization.
   Personnel will be assigned as determined by the deployed commander, however, the senior
   supply individual will assume control and supervision of the MRSP and assigned supply
   personnel. Upon redeployment to homestation this individual will remain accountable for
   the MRSP until released of this obligation by the owning LRS commander.
   1.13.3. If subject to deployment, the LRS/CC will plan for and ensure deployed supply
   support is established.
   1.13.4. Personnel assigned to the APS, Maintenance Supply Liaison (MSL) and MSS will
   receive training in supply procedures and operations of the Contingency Processing System
   (CPS). Maintenance personnel should be trained on basic concepts and operations. Other
   supply personnel subject to deployment and identified to deploy should also receive this
   training.
       1.13.4.1. Training should include a crossflow/familiarization program of the duties and
       responsibilities of MSS, MSL, and APS to include RSP management, bench stock
       management, IMDS/G081 interface, pallet build-up, Material Handling Equipment
       (MHE), and shelf-life programs.
1.14. Delivery/DIFM Locations. DIFM locations will be established for each workcenter to
ensure an easily identifiable location code and to avoid multiple DIFM locations for a single
workcenter. Recommend the first position of the DIFM location code identifies the squadron.
1.15. SBSS/ES-S/IMDS/G081 Interface Changes. The IMDS/G081/SBSS/ES-S interface has
enhanced the maintenance capability to process SBSS/ES-S transactions via IMDS/G081
terminals, (using the maintenance/supply interface menu). All COSO personnel will use this
procedure. Training, if needed, should be provided to ensure rejects and problems are kept to a
minimum. Mainframe support will still be provided by base Comm and it’s a combined
responsibility by base level IMDS/G081/SBSS/ES-S database managers to identify their
interface problems to them.
1.16. Support Center Pacific Supply (SCPS). Maintenance/supply personnel will jointly
develop candidates for referral for repair at SCPS IAW AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2, Part 2,
Chapter 21, PACAF Supplement. These candidates should be reviewed at the Intermediate
Repair Enhancement Program (IREP) meeting.
1.17. Intermediate Repair Enhancement Program (IREP). Reference AFI 21-101,
paragraph 11.34 for procedures.

                         MAINTENANCE SUPPLY SUPPORT (MSS)

2.1. General. Under COSO, the MSS assumes additional supply responsibilities. These
responsibilities include assisting in research, monitoring Due-In From Maintenance (DIFM) and
performing the demand processing function for its maintenance technician's requirements.
IMDS/G081 will be used as the primary source of input for all transactions but the MSS should
also be equipped with a supply remote device and expanded research capability. The MSS may
also be responsible for moving repairables to the repair shop(s) or Flight Service Center (FSC),
IAW paragraph 1.10.1.9 of this instruction. The MSS is responsible for loading the initial DIFM
location and status in the supply computer, and assisting in aircraft MICAP determinations. Shift
manning will be structured to fit the needs of the unit. The MSS is an integral part of the
maintanence squadron, and all assigned personnel are managed through the MXG chain of
command. The NCOIC of the MSS has supervisory responsibility for the overall operation of
the MSS. When possible, key supervisors should be assigned for a minimum of 12 months to
allow cross-utilization training and continuity in the MSS. In addition, supply personnel
assigned to the MSS should be rotated back to the LRS complex after a period of 18 months but
not later than 36 months.
2.2. Responsibilities.
   2.2.1. Train maintenance technicians to perform issue requests using IMDS/G081. Also
   validate and perform all backorder (fill or kill) functions.
   2.2.2. LRS procedures element will provide each MSS a block of 8000 series (for supply
   terminal) (IMDS/G081 serial numbers are assigned automatically) serial numbers for post-
   post processing purposes. The MSS restart with the beginning serial number each calendar
   day.
   2.2.3. Assist maintenance technicians in research of part number/stock numbers.
   2.2.4. Receive and transport reparables to repair shops/FSC to include reparable returns from
   deployments IAW local supplement to paragraph 1.10.1.9 of this instruction.
   2.2.5. Participate in aircraft documentation reviews. Validate parts requirements in
   IMDS/G081 or in SBSS/ES-S and cancel requirements no longer needed. Review current
   status and request supply follow-up action on active backorders if status does not meet
   mission needs.
   2.2.6. Input initial DIFM location/status changes immediately after movement of reparables,
   through either IMDS/G081 or SBSS/ES-S.
   2.2.7. "Z" status will be input if provided by repair shops at the time of reparable item
   movement. If repair shop estimated time of completion (ETIC) exceeds 72 hours for MICAP
   conditions, the MSS will validate the requirement. MSS must provide justification and a
   verifier must be provided from either the backshop or FSS. Justification/verifier will be
   provided through the comments section of the original ES-S input before Air Force Global
   Logistics Support Section (AFGLSC) will requisition the assets from depot or laterally. The
   bullet in ES-S will also read ―AFGLSC PLEASE WORK.‖ However, primary responsibility
PACAFI23-203_374AWSUP_I 27 JULY 2010                                                        11


   for current DIFM status update remains with the repair shops. NOTE: DIFM status codes
   reflect the status of the reparable asset, not the issued serviceable asset.
   2.2.8. Manage and maintain FS bench stock IAW AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2, Part 2,
   Chapter 11; AFI 21-101; and the guidance contained in this instruction.
   2.2.9. Maintain and manage applicable reports and listings (i.e., D18, D23, and S04).
   2.2.10. Review the D23 report or ACC200 report to ensure asset accountability and correct
   status of assets located in the maintenance flights.
   2.2.11. Maintain security of remote devices and ensure only valid transactions are processed
   by reviewing D20, Part 8).
   2.2.12. Appoint a reject manager, delinquent document manager, and PPCT member.
   Appointments should be made in writing from the MXS/CC to the LRS/CC.
   2.2.13. Forward a copy of all 290 and 469 rejects to the LRS Operations and Compliance
   Section. As an LRS option, a copy of 296 rejects may be forwarded to the LRS Customer
   Service Element. Not applicable to squadrons that have decentralized their inventory
   process.
      2.2.13.1. (Added-374AW) . Do not forward a copy of 296 rejects to the 374 LRS
      Customer Support Section (374 LRS/LGRMC).
   2.2.14. Ensure mark-for and delivery destination data is correct on all due-outs.
   2.2.15. Ensure documentation and processing for cannibalizations are processed correctly.
   Update bullet statements in ES-S and Mark-For changes to accurately reflect cannibalization
   actions.
   2.2.16. Validate and perform all backorder (fill or kill) functions.
2.3. Requirements Processing:
   2.3.1. IMDS/G081 input TRICs include the following:
      2.3.1.1. Issues (ISU/MSI).
      2.3.1.2. Part Number Record Load (1AA/2BS).
      2.3.1.3. Inquiries (INQ).

  against an aircraft tail numbers will reflect either a MICAP or BQ UJC (except time
  change/TCTO requirements). UJCs AA, AZ and AW will not be used for backorders against
  aircraft tail numbers.
  2.3.4. Ensure delivery and document flow procedures provide uninterrupted mission support
  to the customer. A single point of contact within the Material Management Flight will be
  established to resolve any delivery problems. Delivery to the MSS from other than the APS
  or FSC will be the responsibility of the LRS.
  2.3.5. If a parts request is made to the MSS for which there is no established item record, the
  MSS will contact the Customer Service and provide national stock number (NSN), part
  number, T.O. reference, and priority for the new item record load. The Customer Support
  Section (CSS) will notify the MSS once the load is completed. As a wing/base option, the
  MSS or supporting APS may process new item record loads. When research reveals an
  incorrect part number is loaded or an NSN is loaded without a corresponding part number;
  the MSS will process a part number detail record update (TRIC 1AA).
     2.3.5.1. (Added-374AW) . APS will process new item record loads for all after hours
     support request.
  2.3.6. If the requested item is available at the APS or FSC, the maintenance technician will
  proceed to the APS or FSC and pick up the item. Warehouse refusals will be processed IAW
  Chapter 3 of this instruction.
  2.3.7. Use the AF Form 2520, Repair Cycle Control Log, or a like local form to track and
  control DIFM assets. Forward reparable assets to the repair shop or direct Not Repairable
  This Station (NRTS) items to the FSC for processing.
     2.3.7.1. If the reparable asset and reusable container are available at the time of the issue
     request, MSS personnel will take the property, AFTO Form 350, Reparable Item
     Processing Tag, or IMDS/G081 maintenance snapshot (Screen #122) of the completed
     action (IAW T.O. 00-20-2, Para 8-8), and the reusable container to the repair shop.
     MICAP and 2LM items will be moved immediately and all others not later than two
     hours after receipt of the reparable in MSS. MSS personnel will give copies 2 and 3 of
     the DD Form 1348-1A, Issue Release/Receipt Document to the repair shop or FSC along
     with the property. Copy 2 will be annotated by repair shop personnel with the DIFM
     asset location and "Z" status (if available), signature, date, time, and given to the MSS
     delivery driver, who will return it to the MSS. Upon return of copy 2, MSS personnel
     will immediately input the DIFM location/status to the remote device using IMDS/G081
     screen #497 or SBSS/ES-S. Copy 2 of the DD Form 1348-1A will then be filed in
     document number sequence and maintained IAW the Air Force Records Information
     Management System (AFRIMS) Record Disposition Schedule (RDS).
     2.3.7.2. If the reparable asset is not available at the time of issue, MSS personnel will
     hold copies 2 and 3 until the maintenance technician brings in the reparable asset and
     reusable container. The reparable asset and container should be received within two
     hours of the issue; once received, personnel will process the property and documentation
     IAW paragraph 2.3.7.1 above.
     2.3.7.3. MSS will ensure all serially controlled parts and time change items (TCI) being
     tracked on engines have an automated operating time report attached to the appropriate
PACAFI23-203_374AWSUP_I 27 JULY 2010                                                          13


     condition tag as required by T.O. 00-20-3 prior to processing these parts to the repair
     shop or FSC. In addition, Automated Ground Engine Test Systems (AGETS)
     Component Removal Reports will be attached to the condition tag.
  2.3.8. If the part is not available for issue an Other Asset Management Notice (I023) will be
  output. The remote operator will review the management notice for other possible assets (i.e.,
  MSK, Special Purpose Recoverables Authorized Maintenance (SPRAM), supply point,
  bench stocks, etc.), interchangeable and substitute group and/or applicable T.O. for substitute
  part numbers/next higher assembly. These actions, as a minimum, will be annotated/stamped
  on the I023 management notice.
     2.3.8.1. When firm MICAP conditions occur, the MSS will reinput the issue with TEX
     code "7" (cc 51), MICAP flag "N" (cc 54), and appropriate UJC (1A/JA) and enter the
     MICAP requirement into ES-S with the bullet ―MEMO MICAP ASSET GOING TO…
     REPAIR SHOP…‖ (ENTER APPROPIATE SHOP, DATE, TIME, AND INITIALS
     (I.E., AVIONICS, 10 AUG, 1600hr and JS). Reparable assets will be taken to repair
     shops immediately. If repair shop estimated time of completion (ETC) exceeds 72 hours
     for MICAP conditions, MSS will validate the requirement. MSS must provide
     justification/verifier. Justification/verifier will be provided through the comments section
     of the original ES-S input before AFGLSC will requisition the assets to depot or laterally.
     The bullet in ES-S will also read ―AFGLSC PLEASE WORK‖. NOTE: Deferred
     (delayed) discrepancies will be reinput by the MSS with TEX code "M" and UJC BQ.
     2.3.8.2. Complete MICAP verification when the decision is made to upgrade an AWP bit
     and piece requisition to MICAP and request cancellation of the due-in (TRIC REC, TEX
     E) for the end item. Process a DIT to change the bit and piece UJC to AA and mark-for
     to the aircraft tail number, System Reporting Designator (SRD) and Work Unit Code
     (WUC), and process computer Transaction Identification Code (TRIC) NOR to upgrade
     the bit and piece requirement(s) to 1A/JA.
     2.3.8.3. Process NOR inputs of both the end item and any applicable bit and piece due-
     outs marked against the aircraft tail number for cannibalizations. The bit and piece due-
     outs will be processed as administrative mark-for changes. Process a DIT to change the
     JCN on all "cann" actions. Support sections will process SBSS/ES-S cannibalizations and
     administrative mark-for changes.
     2.3.8.4. The due-out document number is provided by IMDS/G081/SBSS/ES-S
     interface. When the I004 management notice is received with a DUO indication, the
     maintenance technician annotates the aircraft AFTO Form 781, Aerospace Vehicle and
     Flight Data Document, and notifies the expediter. The expediter notifies the
     Maintenance Operations Center (MOC) of the zero balance condition.
     2.3.8.5. When DORs occur at the FSC as a result of a serviceable turn-in, the MSS will
     be contacted to pickup MICAP items immediately and all others within two hours.
     Regardless of parts source, the property, with attached DD Form 1348-1A, will be placed
     in the MSS Tail Number Bing (TNB) or Parts Holding Bin (PHB); an entry will be made
     in the applicable TNB or PHB inventory log IAW local procedures; and the DIFM
     location should be changed to TNB using IMDS/G081. In the case of MICAP
     requirements, the FS expediter will be notified by the MSS. They will then notify the
     MOC for aircraft status reporting purposes. The MSS will also update the ES-S bullet
 14                                               PACAFI23-203_374AWSUP_I 27 JULY 2010


         statement as follows, ―Memo MICAP repaired and received … (enter date, time and
         initial). The MSS will then close the MICAP Event Record in ES-S by processing
         miscellaneous update with the SBSS/ES-S Complete Code ―N‖, ISU Status Code ―N‖,
         and the Event Record status code ―C‖.
         2.3.8.6. During post-post conditions, the MSS will manually prepare a DD Form 1348-
         1A issue document and annotate/stamp the document "POST-POST DIFM."
   2.3.9. Post-post processing will be as outlined in AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2, Part 2,
   Chapter 32, AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2, Part 11, and applicable supplements.
         2.3.9.1. MSS PPCT personnel will be under the direction of the PPCT Chief during post-
         post processing.
         2.3.9.2. The LRS will determine and establish one central point for after hours post-post
         processing (e.g., APS, FSC, or Customer Service Section). Personnel from the MSS will
         assist in processing their transactions to completion and will ensure all post-post
         transactions are expeditiously processed.
             2.3.9.2.1. (Added-374AW) . APS will act as the central point for all post-post
             processing for all COSO, and maintenance organizations.
      2.3.10. Parts request with a frozen item record will be processed post-post.
   2.3.11. Initial issue requests must be approved by the squadron resource advisor and wing
   MSD manager and submitted to the LRS/CC or their designated representative. Initial issue
   requests should be reviewed at the IREP meeting. For an urgent situation, verbal approval is
   authorized; but the paperwork must be submitted NLT 24 hours following approval. Once
   approved, the MSS will process the issue request with the appropriate demand code. Letters
   of justification are required for alpha budget coded items only. Bases will supplement this
   paragraph to identify specific requirements and responsibilities for budget code 8 and 9
   items. Additional information is contained in AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2, Part 2, Chapter
   11.
         2.3.11.1. (Added-374AW) . 374 LRS/CC, Materiel Management Flight Commander or
         Flight Chief will approve or disapprove initial issue requests. Budget code 8 and 9 items
         are managed IAW AFMAN 23-110, Vol II, Part Two, Chapter 11. FSC will monitor and
         validate the Base Supply Surveillance Report (D20 Part 2) against the suspense file.
   2.3.12. Maintenance technicians, including those dispatched from repair shops, order aircraft
   parts through IMDS/G081 using the owning workcenter organizational shop code, and
   notifying the applicable expediter and MSS. If IMDS/G081 and SBSS/ES-S interface is
   down or exception processing is required, maintenance technicians order aircraft parts
   through the applicable MSS.
2.4. MSS Security. Access to the MSS will be restricted to MSS/MSS escorted personnel.
Procedures for physical security, use and restriction of remote devices are contained in AFMAN
23-110, Volume 2, Part 2, Chapter 2 and Chapter 1 of this instruction.
2.5. Supply Remote User Responsibilities. The MSS is responsible to the LRS for proper
supply remote operation. Rejects caused by the MSS will be cleared using the Cumulative
Reject Processor (D818) or reject notice. If rejects cannot be cleared by transaction, request
assistance from the LRS reject manager. Since the MSS produces accountable source documents
PACAFI23-203_374AWSUP_I 27 JULY 2010                                                             15


over its remote, the MSS is also responsible to the LRS for documents generated in the section.
Rejects which occur over IMDS/G081 terminals are cleared by affected workcenters.
2.6. Special Processing Procedures:
   2.6.1. Married or Fitted Items. Certain types of items, due to their nature and fit, are not
   interchangeable between aircraft. Examples include sheet metal items, work element code
   11000 items, panels, ladders, radomes, modified components, test or investigation items, etc.
   These type items require special processing using TRN procedures. When these items are
   routed to the repair shop, the AFTO Form 350 will be boldly stamped "SPECIAL
   PROCESSING REQUIRED" in the remarks section. Upon receipt of these items, the repair
   shop will order all parts with UJC AR, TEX code 4 and the end item SRD.
       2.6.1.1. If the request is issued and the end item repaired, the repair shop will process a
       TRN in IMDS/G081 (screen #352) and notify the applicable MSS the part is available.
       2.6.1.2. If the request is ―killed,‖ the repair shop notifies the MSS to order the part(s)
       based upon the condition of the aircraft. The end item may be stored as AWP in the shop
       or routed back to the FS for reinstallation. When bits and pieces are received and the end
       item was previously returned to the FS, the MSS is notified to deliver the end item to the
       shop for repair. When the item is repaired, the shop processes the TRN using screen
       #352 and notifies the applicable MSS the part is available for pickup.
       2.6.1.3. If the end item cannot be repaired (NRTS), the repair shop will take the NRTS
       item to the FSC for processing or have the FSC pick-up the item IAW paragraph 1.10.1.9
       of this instruction.
   2.6.2. Functional Check/Operational Flight Programs.
       2.6.2.1. The FS technician responsible for a particular aircraft system will establish a list
       of components that require functional check to include items which are affected by
       Operational Flight Program (OFP) releases prior to installation. This list will be
       maintained in each workcenter as required. Items that were repaired on base will not be
       routed to the repair shop for functional check. The DD Form 1574, Serviceable Tag-
       Material, will serve as the determining factor in this case.
       2.6.2.2. When items due-out release from off-base resources and the DD Form 1348-1A
       reads, ―Functional Check Required‖, the item will be routed to the repair shop. An
       AFTO Form 350 will be attached indicating the owning FS. However, a document
       number will not be assigned. If the item is found to be unserviceable, the repair shop will
       order a replacement end item or repair parts (as applicable) and place the functional
       check end item in AWP status or turn in the item to the FSC for NRTS processing.
       2.6.2.3. SPRAM assets will be routed to the repair shop with an AFTO Form 350 boldly
       stamped "SPRAM Asset - Return to Work Center, Telephone Number." A document
       number will not be assigned. Procedures for SPRAM assets are contained in AFMAN
       23- 110, Volume 2, Part 2, Chapter 22, Section M. SPRAM assets which need to be
       turned in NRTS, will be taken to the FSC for processing. SPRAM TINs will be
       processed by FSC.
2.7. Direct NRTS Identification. The D23 and Q04 identify repair cycle items determined by
applicable maintenance technical order or repair shop as having no base repair capability or
 16                                              PACAFI23-203_374AWSUP_I 27 JULY 2010


authority. These items will be expeditiously moved from the flightline directly to the FSC for
turn-in processing. Workcenters may use a separate list to identify direct NRTS, however, the
D23 or Q04 is the supply source document.
2.8. TNB, Facilitate Other Maintenance (FOM), and PHB Security. Each MSS will
establish a system for positive control of TNB/FOM assets. In addition, they will establish a
control log with the following minimum information: aircraft tail number, date received, NSN,
noun, document number (TNB), aircraft tail number, and removal information (FOB).
   2.8.1. Property placed in TNB/FOM will be identified by attached documentation, (i.e., DD
   Form 1348-1A/AFTO Form 350 (Part I). The aircraft identification (ID) number will be
   conspicuously marked on the documentation. MSS will use the IMDS/G081 Tail # Bin
   Maint-option to show assets placed in TNB. Use the same option to change it from TNB to
   the shop the part was issued to.
   2.8.2. When property is removed from the TNB, the date, time, employee number and
   signature of the individual picking up the property must be recorded in the control log.
   2.8.3. TNB/FOM assets may be stored together if space constraints dictate the need.
   However, separate logs must still be maintained.
   2.8.4. Partially complete TCTO kits/parts will have an inventory list attached, be sealed, and
   stored in the TNB. The aircraft identification (ID) number and TCTO number will be
   conspicuously marked on the TCTO kit/part.
   2.8.5. Panels removed during hourly post-flight and periodic inspections may be placed in
   panel racks with hardware attached in a screw bag with the aircraft serial number annotated
   without other documentation.
   2.8.6. Parts Holding Bin (PHB) Management. Each FSS, other than those providing direct
   aircraft maintenance support, will establish a system for positive control of PHB assets.
   Property placed in PHB will be identified by appropriately attached documentation (i.e., DD
   Form 1348-1A/AFTO Form 350 (Part I)). In addition, a method for recording these assets
   will be established and this control record should contain the following: date item received,
   applicable end item, part and serial numbers, and other pertinent data as desired. When
   property is removed from the PHB, record the end item, part and serial numbers, date, time,
   employee number and signature of individual picking up the property in the control log. If
   the end item serial number differs from the end item serial number that the property was
   turned in against, the FSS will check the cannibalization log to ensure the cannibalization
   processed correctly.
2.9. Asset Status. The MSS will process INQs or will have the D23, D18, and other
management products available to advise parts requesters when a serviceable replacement can be
expected. For items in the repair shop and not AWP, the shop will input a three-position DIFM
status code through IMDS/G081 to show estimated time-in-commission (ETIC). The first letter
of the code will be "Z" to reflect the item is in the repair shop. The last two positions of the code
will reflect the Julian date the shop expects to return the item to a serviceable condition. ETICs
will be assigned for each document number.
2.10. Cannibalization:
PACAFI23-203_374AWSUP_I 27 JULY 2010                                                        17


  2.10.1. maintenance production superintendents will notify the support sections when a cann
  is required. The MSS will initiate the cann action in IMDS/G081/SBSS/ES-S and make all
  entries onto a local cannibalization log.
     2.10.1.1. The MSS will process the cannibalization action and input the new JCN to
     update supply computer records.
     2.10.1.2. When the replacement part is received in the MSS, the MSS will annotate the
     "U COMP" column of the cannibalization log with the date and time the part was
     received and update IMDS/G081 from DAP/DGP to DAM/DGM status.
     2.10.1.3. The MSS will inform the FS OIC/NCOIC of any lost or late T and U actions
     using the IMDS/G081 on-line cannibalization inquiry. The FS OIC/NCOIC will ensure
     cannibalization documentation is processed through the Maintenance Data Collection
     (MDC) system.
     2.10.1.4. When mission requirements dictate, cann actions can be done between
     organizations when approved at the production superintendent level. For engine-to-
     aircraft cannibalization, the production superintendent coordinates with the Jet Engine
     Intermediate Maintenance (JEIM) shop chief. The JEIM chief coordinates the
     cannibalization of serially controlled and TCI with the Engine Management Section
     (EMS).
     2.10.1.5. The receiving MSS processes the cannibalization using IMDS/G081 screen
     #083 and putting an "X" for performing workcenter in order to print out at the donor
     support section.
     2.10.1.6. The donor support section provides the JCN to the receiving MSS. Procedures
     for documentation flow are the same as the paragraph above. When the donor is the
     Propulsion Flight, the Flight Support Section coordinates and processes the
     cannibalization IAW Chapter 7 of this instruction.
  2.10.2. IMDS/G081 elements will use programs IAW AFI 21-101, pg 15, IMDS DSD:
  G054/FS, Job Data Documentation Users Manual, to record and monitor cannibalizations.
  After notification of a cannibalization, the MSS will input the cannibalization action into
  IMDS generating the T action. After removal of the item from the aircraft, the maintenance
  technician will complete the T action in IMDS. The MSS will immediately notify the
  production superintendent when the replacement part is received. The production
  superintendent will decide whether the part will be reinstalled or deferred. The MSS will use
  the applicable IMDS program to defer reinstallation or notify the workcenter when the
  cannibalization part replacement is to be accomplished. The technician will complete the U
  action in IMDS using the necessary program after completion of the reinstallation. All
  received parts will be stored in TNB until reinstallation occurs. The MSS will reconcile the
  manual log with the IMDS cannibalization history inquiry. All completed T and U actions
  will be lined through in the T and U COMP blocks of the manual log daily when they show
  complete in IMDS. The FS OIC/NCOIC is responsible for ensuring cannibalization
  procedures and documentation is properly complied with.
     2.10.2.1. MRSP cannibalizations must be processed in IMDS/G081 IAW the following
     procedures:
 18                                             PACAFI23-203_374AWSUP_I 27 JULY 2010


       2.10.2.2. ENTER AN EQUIP-ID OF "AWRSK" on screen 073 and complete all other
       fields to properly load the event so that a cannibalization can be completed.
       2.10.2.3. If "AWRSK" is not loaded to your system, it will automatically load when you
       transmit.
       2.10.2.4. Order your part normally using screen 072.
       2.10.2.5. Use screen 083 to process your cannibalization as you normally would.
       2.10.2.6. When you process screen 083, it will automatically close the original event and
       pass you to screen 516 to transfer your document number. This will complete the
       Cannibalization (CANN) scheduling process.
2.11. Reusable Containers. The Base Reusable Container Monitor (LRS) will determine
reusable container storage locations. Reparable items are to be routed through the repair cycle
with a reusable container. When a serviceable item releases (DOR) with a reusable container
and the reparable is already in the repair cycle, the MSS will deliver the container to the repair
shop. If the unserviceable item has been shipped off-base, the reusable container will be retained
in the local reusable container storage area for future use.
2.12. Administrative Mark for Changes. When the FS production supervisor decides to use a
TNB asset for another aircraft, the MSS will process an administrative mark-for changes in the
SBSS/ES-S (TRIC NOR E for firm MICAP (Due-ins linked) and NOR J for memo MICAP (No
Due-in linked). Update IMDS/G081 using screen #498. This is not a cannibalization action.
Mark-for data and delivery destination code changes (TRIC DIT) for deferred discrepancies will
also be processed by the MSS. Mark-for changes on engine TCI will be coordinated with the
EMS.

   3.2.5. Act as the central post-post processing point for supported maintenance workcenters
   with supply.
   3.2.6. May serve as the central after-hours issue processing center at the option of the
   LRS/CC.
       3.2.6.1. (Added-374AW) . APS will serve as the central after-hour issue processing
       center.
   3.2.7. Maintain security of the APS.
   3.2.8. Manage RSP Program. Other facets of the War Reserve Materiel (WRM) Program,
   including mobility bags will not be added to APS responsibilities. The LRS/CC has the
   option to allow the APS to manage War Consumables Distribution Objective (WCDO).
       3.2.8.1. (Added-374AW) .      The Central Storage Element will manage War
       Consumables Distribution Objective (WCDO) items.
3.3. Customer Service Counter. The service counter is the focal point for all store activities.
Customer Service counter/APS personnel will:
   3.3.1. Locate and pull property for DD Forms 1348-1A issue documents that process on
   assigned remote terminals. APS personnel determine location/availability of assets (to
   include I&SG). If a location exists, personnel will physically check the location and advise
   the support section of item availability.
   3.3.2. Ensure DD Forms 1348-1A are properly annotated and signed if SATS is not
   available.
   3.3.3. Give the property to the maintenance technician or arrange for delivery when an item
   is bulky or outsized.
 20                                             PACAFI23-203_374AWSUP_I 27 JULY 2010


      3.3.3.1. (Added-374AW) . Bulky property will be coordinated for delivery through 374
      LRS Deployment and Distribution Flight (Pick-up and Delivery Section) (374
      LRS/LGRDDO).
   3.3.4. Forward accountable documents to Document Control as directed by a base
   supplement to this instruction and AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2, Part 2, Chapter 18.
   Frequency and method of movement is an LRS option.
   3.3.5. If property cannot be found in the location identified on the issue document
   (warehouse refusal), the following steps will be taken (before advising the technician to
   return to their workcenter within 15 minutes).
      3.3.5.1. Check the APS receiving/holding area for assets in the notice to stock or
      ISU/DOR hold area.
      3.3.5.2. If not located in APS receiving/holding area, run a daily transaction history
      inquiry for transactions that generated a warehouse balance and locate the asset. If the
      inquiry does not present an immediate resolution for the discrepancy, or if the computer
      is off-line, advise the technician to return to his/her workcenter. The APS will then
      follow steps in paragraph 3.3.5.3 through 3.3.6.4 below.
      3.3.5.3. If the inquiry indicates a possible solution (e.g., REC/DOR intransit, awaiting
      movement to the APS, etc.) identify the physical location and transfer property to APS
      immediately.
      3.3.5.4. If the issue was run through IMDS/G081 and the document didn't print on APS's
      printer:
          3.3.5.4.1. Verify location loaded in SBSS/ES-S.
          3.3.5.4.2. Same as 3.3.5.2 above.
   3.3.6. If above steps do not resolve the discrepancy, take the following actions:
      3.3.6.1. Advise the technician to return to his/her workcenter with instructions to
      establish a due-out with a new document number. The MSS will forward copies 2 and 3
      of the DD Form 1348-1A (original document number) to APS for warehouse refusal
      processing.
      3.3.6.2. Process a "6Z" type inquiry (and a "4" type inquiry if not already accomplished)
      and perform a complete balance check on all APS POS/MRSP/IRSP locations. Balance
      check must be completed within four hours of returning the warehouse refusal.
      3.3.6.3. If the balance check locates missing property, APS personnel will process a
      serviceable turn-in, with supply action taken code "X" against the original document
      number. Copy one of the original request (MSI/ISU) will be signed by the APS
      supervisor and forwarded to Document Control.
      3.3.6.4. If balance check does not locate missing property, process the warehouse refusal
      IAW AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2, Part 2, Chapter 10. In addition, DIFM status code
      "RFS" will be loaded.
3.4. Management Products. The ACC214 or equivalent local program will be maintained for
90 days and other management products will be developed and used as determined locally.

3.5. Warehouse Management. Procedures outlined in existing directives apply.
   3.5.1. To facilitate the forward stockage of assets, the use of pseudo locations/stockrooms
   are authorized for items (including all items within an Interchangeable and Substitute Group
   (I&SG) family identified for movement to COSO warehouse locations) with no warehouse
   location.
   3.5.2. Transfer and movement of items between warehouses will be coordinated with
   Storage.
   3.5.3. During post-post periods, the APS will act as the central locator for the MSS and will
   determine location/availability of assets (to include I&SG). If a location exists, personnel
   will physically check the location and advise the MSS of item availability.
3.6. MRSP/IRSP Management. MRSP reporting remains as stipulated in AFMAN 23-110,
Volume 2, Part 2 and AFI 10-201, Status of Resources and Training System. The MRSP
supervisor is responsible for the overall management of their MRSP IAW the directives
identified below.

   3.6.2. MRSP/IRSP assets will not be commingled with POS.
   3.6.3. MRSP will be stored in mobility MRSP bins, tire racks or on pallets. Bins and tire
   racks will be in subdued colors (i.e., olive drab, forest green or desert camouflage). Subdued
   colors used will depend on mobility commitment. MRSP bins and tire racks will be
   configured on 463L pallets.
   3.6.4. A dedicated MRSP crew chief may be assigned to each MRSP.
   3.6.5. Process reparable assets upon return from deployments as follows:
       3.6.5.1. Determine inventory requirements.
       3.6.5.2. MRSP Section will ensure an MSI is processed with TEX code "W."
       3.6.5.3. MSI source document (DD Form 1348-1A) distribution: Copy 1 to Document
       Control and copies 2, and 3 attached to property. If SATS is utilized there are no DD

                            FLIGHT SERVICE CENTER (FSC)

4.1. General. The FSC is a LRS function and the supervisor works directly for the Material
Management Flight Commander/Superintendent. It serves as a decentralized warehouse for off
equipment spares. The FSC absorbs the Repair Cycle functions and portions of the maintenance
RCM function. This section is the central point for repair cycle management. The FSC, space
permitting, should be collocated with the avionics facility.
4.1. (374AW)The 374th Logistics Readiness Squadron Flight Service Center (FSC ) (374
LRS/LGRMMF) will not function as a storage facility.
4.2. Responsibilities:

   and this instruction.
   4.2.2. Receive, prepare, and process issue requests IAW AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2, Part 2,
   Chapter 11. As agreed to by the LRS/CC and the OG/CC AND MXG/CC, the FSC and/or
   the Customer Service will be the submission point for issue request for repair shops
   geographically separated from the FSC, during post-post conditions, and when the requested
   item is exception or advice coded.
   4.2.3. Serve as the turn-in point for repair cycle assets for all flightline customers. Provide
   transportation of reparables from repair shops to the FSC. SPRAM assets will be processed
   through the LRS/EAO IAW AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2, Part 2, Chapter 22. Exception:
   The MSS is responsible for reparable movement to the initial repair shop or FSC for direct
   NRTS action. The agency required to transport reparables requiring multiple repair actions
   will be determined by the OG/CC AND MXG/CC and LRS/CC. NOTE: When agreed upon
   by the LRS/CC and a supported activity, reparable parts may be delivered by that supported
   activity.
   4.2.4. Deliver serviceable assets to appropriate warehouses, NRTS items to transportation,
   and condemned assets to the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Office (DRMO)/holding
   area.
   4.2.5. Actively monitor the D23/ACC200 for unsatisfactory or outdated status and notify
   each repair flight DIFM monitor, who is responsible for status and location changes, to make
   updates through IMDS/G081/SBSS/ES-S. Solicit and process updates when the
   IMDS/G081/SBSS interface is not available.
   4.2.6. Monitor the processing of TRN data by maintenance in IMDS/G081.
   4.2.7. Manage and maintain POS, MRSP, and/or IRSP for MXS avionics peculiar assets

4.3. Requirements Processing:
   4.3.1. LRS Operations Compliance Element will provide the FSC a block of serial numbers
   for IMDS/G081 processing purposes. The FSC will restart with the beginning serial number
   each calendar day.
   4.3.2. Repair shop personnel collocated with the FSC will order parts through IMDS/G081.
   Local processing requirements will be supplemented for periods when IMDS/G081 is
   unavailable.
      4.3.2.1. The technician will verify the impact of all parts with the shop chief, production
      supervisor, or element leader prior to ordering. The technician will check bench stock,
      shop stock, etc., prior to submission of parts request.
      4.3.2.2. Requests for test stations or mockups will be ordered using the applicable ID
      number, SRD, and appropriate UJC (e.g., 1G/AG/BG).
      4.3.2.3. After input of the issue request, distribution of the AF Forms 2005, Issue/Turn-in
      Request will be as follows: Copy 1 will be placed in the control register file; copy 2 and 3

      4.3.2.6. When the requested item is located in the main warehouse or other storage
      facility, delivery will be the responsibility of LRS.
24                                            PACAFI23-203_374AWSUP_I 27 JULY 2010


     4.3.2.7. If repair parts are not available, the maintenance workcenter will establish a due-
     out using the following procedures and those in AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2, Part 2,
     Chapter 11.
        4.3.2.7.1. When the MSS has established an issued DIFM detail or deferred
        discrepancy due-out, the repair shop will order UJC "AR" AWP bits and pieces fill or
        backorder. If the request backorders, the AFGLSC AWP manager will be notified for
        sourcing action. The AWP manager will follow procedures in AFMAN 23-110,
        Volume 2, Part 2, Chapter 17 for sourcing. When assets are located, the AWP
        manager will complete requisitioning action and notify the shop.
        4.3.2.7.2. When the MSS has established a MICAP due-out, the repair shop will
        order AWP bits and pieces fill or kill.
            4.3.2.7.2.1. If the bit/piece is issued, the end item will be repaired and returned to
            the FSC for turn-in processing.
            4.3.2.7.2.2. If the requested item is not issued, the repair shop and AFGLSC will
            jointly determine whether the end item or the required bit and piece will be
            initially verified and requisitioned as MICAP against the aircraft tail number.
            Command policy is to requisition the bit and piece, if the support posture of the
            LRU/SRU is equal. The decision making process should include the ability to
            repair the end item, availability of assets (wholesale level/lateral support), and
            which item can be obtained in the shortest period of time. Reference AFMAN
            23-110, Volume 2, Part 2, Chapter 17, PACAF Supplement 1, for additional
            guidance.
            4.3.2.7.2.3. If the decision is made to requisition the end item as MICAP, the
            AFGLSC will accomplish requisitioning action using the appropriate UJC. The
            repair shop will back order the bits and pieces AR against the end item due-out.
            If the decision is made to request the bits and pieces MICAP against the aircraft
            tail number, the repair shop will notify the Mission Support Section to change the
            UJC to the appropriate MICAP UJC, change the mark-for field to the aircraft tail
            number (including SRD and WUC) and input the request with TEX "7" (memo).
            The AFGLSC begins the MICAP verification process and requisitioning action.
            MICAP records in ES-S will be updated to cross-reference the memo end item
            and bit and piece requirements.
            4.3.2.7.2.4. Under no circumstances will both the end item and bits and pieces
            both be requisitioned as MICAP. However, if the supply situation changes, the
            requirements may be downgraded/upgraded to ensure required items are received
            expeditiously (e.g., the end item initially requisitioned MICAP can be changed to
            memo, and the bit and piece may be upgraded to MICAP, or the bits and pieces
            initially requisitioned MICAP against the tail number may be downgraded to
            "AR" and the end item can be requisitioned).
            4.3.2.7.2.5. The DIFM location code of the applicable repair shop will be used
            for repair parts. The shop technician will be provided copies of the output
            management notice, and these notices will be used to move the reparable asset.
PACAFI23-203_374AWSUP_I 27 JULY 2010                                                            25


      4.3.2.8. If a parts request is made to the FSC for which there is no established item
      record, the FSC will contact LRS's LRS Customer Service Element and provide the stock
      number, part number, T.O. figure and index, and priority of the requirement. The
      Customer Service Element will immediately load the item record/part number detail
      record (1AA) and notify the FSC. The FSC will then process the request in accordance
      with provisions outlined in this chapter. As a wing/base option, the FSC may process
      new item record loads. The FSC will process a 1AA update when research reveals an
      NSN is loaded without a corresponding part number.
      4.3.2.9. If the reparable asset is turned in at the time of the issue request, the technician
      will provide a prepared AFTO Form 350, two condition tags, reusable container/AF Form
      451, Request for Packaging Service, and copy 3 of the DD Form 1348-1A.
      4.3.2.10. If the reparable item is not turned in at the time of issue request, the workcenter
      will be responsible for updating DIFM status or for providing this info to the FSC.
4.4. Due -In from Maintenance (DIFM) Turn-In:
   4.4.1. All DIFM assets must be turned in through the FSC.
      4.4.1.1. As assets are picked up or received from base customers by FSC, the items will
      be in-checked, inspected, and computer processed. FSC personnel will ensure all serially
      controlled and TCI parts tracked on engines have an Automated Operating Time Report
      attached to the applicable item condition tag (IAW T.O. 00-20-3) prior to accepting these
      parts from base customers. In addition, Automated Ground Engine Test Systems
      (AGETS) component removal reports will be attached to the condition tag. For F-16
      elements, avionics intermediate shop LRU repair support data will be attached to the
      condition tag. Serviceable assets turned in to satisfy a MICAP condition will be
      processed immediately. All other serviceable turn-ins will be processed within two
      hours. Unserviceable 2LM assets will be processed immediately.
      4.4.1.2. AF Forms 2005 will be prepared by the FSC using the AFTO Form 350 and DD
      Form 1348-1A as source documents. The original copy of the AF Form 2005 will be the
      source document for computer processing. A copy will go to the Document Control
      Section. As a wing/base option, a copy of the AF Form 2005 may be attached to the
      property for reference purposes. In addition, as a LRS option, the DD Form 1348-1A
      may replace the AF Form 2005 as the source document and document control copy for
      turn-in action.
          4.4.1.2.1. (Added-374AW) .     A copy of the DD Form 1348-1A, Issue
          Release/Receipt Document, or SATS label will be attached to the property.
      4.4.1.3. As parts are processed, the property will be moved down the processing line to
      an applicable action station (i.e., off base/NRTS shipment; APS delivery; DOR to MS
      Avionics or MSS; APS stock; rejects, condemnations, non-COSO DORs, etc.).
   4.4.2. As serviceable stock is generated, the FSC will ensure movement within two hours
   after processing. For DORs to MXS Avionics and the MSS, the appropriate shop will be
   contacted immediately for MICAP releases and others within 30 minutes. MICAP DORs
   will be picked up immediately and all others within two hours. NOTE: Bases operating a
 26                                             PACAFI23-203_374AWSUP_I 27 JULY 2010


   scheduled DIFM movement system and/or time-definite delivery system will supplement this
   instruction and identify unit/organization responsibilities
   4.4.3. For NRTS items that require reporting prior to disposition, the FSC should move the
   items to the main reparable storage area of the Material Management Flight. However, if
   storage area in the FSC is adequate, retention may be authorized there at local discretion.
       4.4.3.1. (Added-374AW) . FSC will maintain the storage area for unserviceable recap
       tires awaiting disposition instructions.
   4.4.4. For condemned items that must be held for scheduled delivery to an off-base DRMO,
   the FSC will move the assets to a temporary holding area.
   4.4.5. Electronic components identified as electrostatic devices require special handling. To
   prevent damage use the handling procedures identified in T.O. 00-25-234, Chapter 7.
4.5. Exception Turn-In Processing. The MXG/CC or Deputy may authorize deviation to the
automated due-out release sequence. However, these deviations will apply only when there are
multiple requirements for an item and the respective shop is unable to turn sufficient serviceables
to satisfy all critical requirements. When necessary, the MOC, in coordination with the MSL,
will provide to the repair shop/FSC a priority release sequence list for selected items. MICAP
requirements will be processed immediately upon receipt of property in the FSC.
4.6. DIFM Updates/Control:
   4.6.1. The FSC is the central point for repair cycle management. Each repair shop DIFM
   manager is responsible for updating current status and location of all DIFM assets daily
   through IMDS/G081.
   4.6.2. The FSC will review the D23 daily to manage DIFM assets, identify outdated status
   and potential discrepancies between DIFM details and physical accountability of assets.
   COSO uses standard DIFM status codes except for items in shop. DIFM status codes for in-
   shop assets will reflect a Z (xx) ETIC. The first letter of the code will be ―Z‖ to reflect the
   item is in the repair shop. The last two positions of the code will reflect the Julian date the
   shop expects to return the item to a serviceable condition. ETICs will be assigned for each
   document number.
   4.6.3. Assets which reflect FSC as a location will be reconciled daily to ensure assets are
   processed. Determine asset accountability (3-workday maximum) or request special
   inventory.
   4.6.4. Contact customers on all ―issue/firm‖ DIFM assets in On Aircraft or Missile (OAM)
   status with excessive issue days (3-workday maximum). Determine asset accountability or
   request special inventory.
   4.6.5. Ensure each repair cycle record for items generated by organizational level
   maintenance contains the responsible organization and shop code designated as base repair
   activity. Assets that are direct NRTS will reflect ―009DN‖ as base designated repair activity.
   Bases with multiple wings/MDS may assign unique shop codes to identify by wing/MDS
   those items approved for direct NRTS.
PACAFI23-203_374AWSUP_I 27 JULY 2010                                                          27


   4.6.6. At the option of the LRS/CC, the FSC or Customer Service will load the
   organization/shop code of the base designated repair activity (AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2,
   Part 2, Chapter 27) to the repair cycle record.
       4.6.6.1. (Added-374AW) . Customer Support Center (Records Maintenance) will load
       the designated repair activity to the repair cycle records.
4.7. DIFM Reconciliation: A quarterly DIFM reconciliation and inventory (required by
AFMAN 23-110, Vol 2, Part 2, Chapter 10) will be conducted with all work centers to physically
account for issued DIFM details and validate each due-out on the D23, DIFM listing. If missing
DIFM assets are identified and can’t be recovered within 3 duty days of the reconciliation and
inventory, the owner of the DIFM detail will immediately initiate a report of survey. Each work
center DIFM monitor and the primary D23 manager in the FSC will acknowledge this
reconciliation and inventory by signing the D23. This signed listing and any supporting
documentation will be kept file in the FSC until completion of the next reconciliation.
4.8. Local Manufacture. IAW AFMAN 23-110, Vol 2, Part 2, Chapter 11, bases have the
option to not process local manufacture items through the supply account if the item is needed to
satisfy an internal maintenance requirement. If bases elect to use this option, they must develop
a maintenance operating instruction that outlines the procedures for manufacturing the item. If
bases elect to process local manufacture items through the supply account, the FSC NCOIC will
appoint a local manufacture manager to assume responsibilities in AFI 21-101.
   4.8.1. The FSC local manufacture function may assume local manufacture responsibilities
   and related tasks of stock control and receiving. Local supplements to this instruction and
   AFMAN 23-110, Vol 2, Part 2, Chapter 9, 10, and 11 must identify specific responsibilities
   based on local determination of need.
   4.8.2. LRS Customer Service will then forward the AFTO Form 350, management notices,
   and sample/ drawings (if required) to the FSC local manufacture manager. Systems
   management notifies the FSC local manufacture manager immediately upon receipt of all
   MICAP JBD requisition (A0(x)) documents.
   4.8.3. The requester, in conjunction with the appropriate fabricating section, determines bits
   and pieces required to manufacture the item, and process the issue requests. The FSC local
   manufacture manager will assist in verifying parts availability. If the items are issued, the
   bits and pieces, AFTO Form 350 tag, copy of A0(x) requisition, DD Form 1348-6, etc. will
   be forwarded to the repair section. If parts are not available and the requirement is MICAP
   the FSC local manufacture manager will input the bit and piece requirements with TEX ―7‖;
   appropriate MICAP UJC; JCN in the work-order field, aircraft tail number (SRD and WUC)
   in the mark-for, and notify the AFGLSC who will accomplish MICAP verification and
   requisitioning processes. To complete the MICAP process, when required bits and pieces are
   received they will be released to the appropriate shop for local manufacture of the item. The
   request for the local manufacture item will remain on order until the item is complete and
   received by Supply for due-out release (DOR).
   4.8.4. For non-MICAP requirements, the FSC local manufacture manager will back order
   the requirements with the appropriate UJC and JCN in the work order field.

            periodic surveillance (minimum of quarterly) of FSC inspection activities will remain
            the primary responsibility of the Chief Inspector. The chief inspector will be
            responsible to ensure all inspection activities are using current products, are in
            compliance with publications and are kept informed of changes to the manual.
            Periodic surveillance visits do not need to be documented. However, all training and
            certification of personnel will be documented.
            5.4.5.1.2. Semiannually, forward the functional check listing to MSS for update.
            Items included in the OFP program should be included in the functional check
            program.

                                        Chapter 6

     TIME COMPLIANCE TECHNICAL ORDER (TCTO) AND TIME CHANGE
                         MANAGEMENT

6.1. TCTO Management:
  6.1.1. TCTO responsibilities are assigned by AFI 21-101. However, responsibility for
  managing and reporting commodity series TCTOs other than aircraft will remain totally with
  the MF Plans, Scheduling and Documentation (PS&D) Section. The Engine Management
  Section (EMS) maintains responsibility for managing and reporting engine and associated
  engine commodity series TCTOs. EMS keeps OSS PS&D informed of problems with parts,
  kits, and completion of TCTOs.
  6.1.2. When the PS&D or EMS from QS receives a TCTO applicable to aircraft, a meeting
  will be held to plan and coordinate TCTO compliance. This meeting will be chaired by the
  MXS PS&D Section or EMS TCTO manager and attended by representatives from QS, each
  MXS scheduling section, the FSC, LRS Inspection Section and workcenters involved in the
  TCTO compliance. The total number of end units to be modified will be determined at this
  meeting. NOTE: The need for the FSC to attend the TCTO meeting is determined locally.
  6.1.3. Requirements for TCTO kits and/or parts required to assemble a kit are identified to
  the FSC TCTO monitor by the maintenance TCTO monitor. The maintenance TCTO
  monitor ensures that the FSC monitor receives a copy of the TCTO publication and any other
  information required to identify TCTO kit requirements.
     6.1.3.1. TCTO Kit Requisitioning Procedures.
         6.1.3.1.1. Upon receipt of the TCTO requirements from maintenance, the supply
         TCTO monitor requests the Research Element to load an item record for the TCTO.
         The Customer Service Element notifies the FSC TCTO monitor when the item record
         is loaded. The FSC TCTO monitor then notifies the maintenance TCTO monitor.
         6.1.3.1.2. If the TCTO kit applies to a major end item of equipment, aircraft or
         missile and is requisitioned from the depot, the maintenance TCTO monitor must
         complete certain actions. The monitor orders the TCTO kit requirement via
         IMDS/G081 screen #497, option 3 or screen #072. An issue request may be prepared
         for each kit or, if desired, the total TCTO kit requirement may be consolidated into
         one issue request. Demand code "I" is assigned to all requests for TCTO kits
         identified by "K" in the fifth position of the stock number. The issue request
         establishes a due-out and requisition for each TCTO kit. The TCTO due-out
         documents produced by the SBSS/ES-S ADS are returned to the FSC TCTO monitor.
         The FSC TCTO monitor places a copy of the TCTO due-out document in the TCTO
         kit jacket file. NOTE: The LRS/CC has the option to authorize the FSC TCTO
         monitor to order TCTO kit requirements.
         6.1.3.1.3. If the technical order stipulates that required parts and materials are
         automatically provided, the maintenance TCTO monitor processes a issue request (
         screen #072) with TEX "7" (do not requisition) for the requirements and then notifies
         the FSC TCTO monitor of action taken. The FSC TCTO monitor then notifies the
PACAFI23-203_374AWSUP_I 27 JULY 2010                                                      33


        AFGLSC to suppress requisitioning using requisition exception code (REX) "4"
        procedures as outlined in AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2, Part 2, Chapter 9.
        6.1.3.1.4. If parts or materials are locally obtained to complete a technical order
        requirement, an issue request is prepared for each item required by the FSC TCTO
        monitor. The technical order number (not the kit stock number) should be entered in
        the mark for field of the issue request.
        6.1.3.1.5. If the technical order stipulates that demand or adjusted stock levels are
        reduced or eliminated, the FSC TCTO monitor will notify Customer Service of this
        requirement.
        6.1.3.1.6. If the TCTO kit applies to a major end item of equipment, aircraft or
        missile, and is assembled from base stocks, the following action is taken:
            6.1.3.1.6.1. An issue request (screen #072) for a kit requirement is prepared by
            the maintenance TCTO monitor using TEX "7" (do not requisition). The
            maintenance TCTO monitor notifies the FSC TCTO monitor when the
            requirement has been placed on order.
            6.1.3.1.6.2. The FSC TCTO monitor prepares a special requisition input (SPR),
            reflecting an off-line routine requisition number, as outlined in AFMAN 23-110,
            Volume 2, Part 2, Chapter 9. The FSC TCTO monitor processes issue requests
            for each item requested, except for munitions. Munitions requirements are
            processed as outlined in AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2, Part 2, Chapter 33. The
            SPR input and issue request may also be processed by demand processing, as
            determined by local management.
        6.1.3.1.7. If the TCTO kit applies to the modification of parts or components (base
        stocks, mobile spares, or installed items), issue requests (screen #072) are prepared
        based upon the information passed to maintenance by supply.
     6.1.3.2. Receipt and Release of Kits.
        6.1.3.2.1. TCTO kit due-outs are not automatically released by the SBSS/ES-S;
        therefore, a notice to bin is always provided. All TCTO kits are forwarded to the FSC
        TCTO monitor. In addition to the notice to bin, the SBSS/ES-S produces a TCTO kit
        asset availability notice (I029 management notice) on the applicable terminal. All
        copies of the I029 management notice are forwarded to the TCTO kit monitor. One
        copy of the I029 management notice is placed in the applicable TCTO kit jacket file
        replacing any previous notices. A due-out status notification (1SH) transaction
        (status code "5") is sent to IMDS/G081 to indicate asset availability.
        6.1.3.2.2. As base assembled TCTO kits are completed, the FSC TCTO monitor
        prepares a receiving document as outlined in AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2, Part 2,
        Chapter 10. The SBSS/ES-S sends IMDS/G081 a due-out status notification (1SH)
        transaction (status code 5) to indicate availability of the quantity received.
        6.1.3.2.3. When TCTO kits are required, the maintenance activity verifies
        completeness of available kits with the FSC TCTO monitor. If complete kits are
        available, the maintenance TCTO monitor prepares and processes, via IMDS/G081
        screen #485, a request to release the TCTO kit. When complete kits are not available,
34                                            PACAFI23-203_374AWSUP_I 27 JULY 2010


         maintenance is advised of the current supply status of items still required. Incomplete
         kits may be released at the option of the MXG/MSG.
         6.1.3.2.4. Upon receipt of the DOR output document, the FSC TCTO monitor
         verifies completeness of available kits, and if available, matches the kits to the DOR
         document.
  6.1.4. MXS schedulers will work directly with the FSC without MSL intervention (i.e., MXS
  PS&D Section or EMS will maintain working files for their aircraft or engines and the FSC
  will requisition/store TCTO kits, etc.).
  6.1.5. The MXS PS&D Section or EMS will maintain primary TCTO jacket files. The FSC
  will provide availability notices to the OSS PS&D Section or EMS which will prioritize
  issues to the MFs and/or the JEIM shop.
  6.1.6. The MXS scheduler will order and the FSC will store all kitted/non-kitted TCTO
  requirements (except inspection TCTOs). A non-kitted TCTO is considered approved by the
  MAJCOM when the following statement is included in paragraph 5 of the TCTO: "The
  following parts will not be furnished as a complete kit, complete kit concept waived by
  (name/rank/office symbol/DSN phone number of using command/LG individual authorizing
  waiver for complete kit concept), for initial installation and will be requisitioned IAW
  AFMAN 23- 110.‖ If this statement is not included in paragraph 5 of the TCTO, the FSC
  will send a message to the issuing item manager (info copy to HQ PACAF/A4M and HQ
  AFMC/MME) and request confirmation of waiver before requisitioning action. NOTE: HQ
  PACAF/A4M will review and approve requests for TCTOs that do not include all items.
  6.1.7. Inspection TCTOs will be treated as normal replacement/wear out requirements, and
  the user is responsible for ordering, storing and turn-in of parts for such TCTOs. Engine
  TCTOs in this category will be stored in the Propulsion Flight parts holding bin (PHB) and
  be managed and controlled by the EMS.
  6.1.8. The maintenance technician submits IMDS/G081 workorder notification printout to
  the FSC TCTO monitor as a receipt for a TCTO kit. The FSC TCTO monitor ensures
  requests for TCTO kits against a serial number previously issued are referred to the MF
  PS&D Section or EMS. The MF PS&D Section or EMS verifies the tail number or
  engine/module/part serial number prior to due-out release to the technician.
  6.1.9. The maintenance technician will ensure reparable items, equipment components and
  consumable item residue (full unit of issue) generated by TCTO compliance are turned in to
  the LRS. Less than full unit of issue residue may be retained in the shop for attrition.
  6.1.10. TCTO reconciliation of assets and requirements will be accomplished monthly. A
  TCTO kit reconciliation listing will be produced and distributed by the FSC TCTO manager.
  The FSC TCTO manager will retain copy 1 and copy two will be given to the OSS PS&D
  Section or EMS. The LRS Inspection Section will also receive a copy.
     6.1.10.1. The OSS PS & D Section will perform MSL TCTO reconciliation
     responsibilities as prescribed in AFI 21-101. They will update the reconciliation listing
     and return it to the FSC TCTO manager.
     6.1.10.2. LRS Inspectors will use their copy of the listing to ensure TCTO kits required
     to modify base assets (including DIFM) are identified.
PACAFI23-203_374AWSUP_I 27 JULY 2010                                                       35


      6.1.10.3. The FSC TCTO manager will take action to correct all deficiencies identified
      (i.e., mark-for changes, deletions, excess, etc.).
      6.1.10.4. The reconciliation will be accomplished within five workdays after preparation
      of the listing.
      6.1.10.5. The MXG will be informed of all excess TCTO kits prior to disassembly or
      disposal.
      6.1.10.6. The current operations officer need not sign the TCTO reconciliation listing.
      However, they will be provided the minutes/update report as identified in paragraph
      6.1.12 below.
   6.1.11. At the option of the wing/base, TCTO reconciliation meetings may be held to
   reconcile TCTO requirements. If meetings are held, listings need not be returned to the FSC
   TCTO manager for update. The FSC TCTO manager will note updates during the meeting
   and take corrective action.
   6.1.12. Regardless of whether there is a meeting or not, minutes or a TCTO update report
   will be accomplished. The minutes or update report will include a summary of
   updates/corrections and a summary of total TCTO requirements (number of end items
   modified/unmodified, total kits on hand and on order, etc.). The minutes or update report
   will be provided to all TCTO managers as well as MXG/MSG and LRS senior leaders.
   6.1.13. Additional guidance is provided in AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2, Part 2, Chapter 24
   and T.O. 00-5-55.
6.2. Time Change Item (TCI) Management.
   6.2.1. The OSS PS&D section maintains overall responsibility for managing the time change
   item program. The EM maintains responsibility for managing the engine time change item
   program. All time change requirements will be forecasted IAW T.O. 00-20-9 and routed to
   the appropriate PS&D section. For squadron sized elements, as defined in AFI 21-101, the
   PS&D section is responsible for managing the time change item program unless the MX
   elects to assign schedulers to the OSS.
   6.2.2. The delivery destination of the Propulsion Branch Flight Support Section (PBFSS)
   and shop code "TC" will be used. Engine time change items will be stored in the Propulsion
   Flight parts holding bins (PHB) until issued for installation.
   6.2.3. Time change items are upgraded to MICAP when the item has not been received by
   the due date/time. Installed engine time change items are upgraded to MICAP (lM) through
   the FSC against the engine ID.
   6.2.4. The EMS reviews the Document Validation Report (DVR) ensuring that discrepancies
   are resolved.

PACAFI23-203_374AWSUP_I 27 JULY 2010                                                           37


     7.2.1.1. Issues (ISU/MSI).
     7.2.1.2. Part Number Record Load (1AA/2BS).
     7.2.1.3. Inquiries (INQ).
     7.2.1.4. DIFM Update (DFM).
     7.2.1.5. Due-in/Due-out Update (DIT).
     7.2.1.6. Bench Stock Issue Requests (1BS)
     7.2.1.7. Others as determined locally by the LRS.
  7.2.2. LRS Operations and Compliance provides each FSS with a block of serial numbers for
  processing purposes. These numbers are a J deck 8000 series used for Post-Post processing
  as well as advice and exception coded requisitions. The FSS restarts with the beginning
  serial number each calendar day.
  7.2.3. The     maintenance     technician   submits    all   requisitions   through   the
  IMDS/G081/SBSS/ES-S interface screen #497. All supply interface authorized terminals are
  identified to the Database Management Office for management notice linkage to the FSS
  IMDS/G081 terminal. The management notice returned from supply is printed by the
  maintenance technician and a copy is provided to the FSS as the controlling document and
  replaces the AF Form 2414, Verification Worksheet as the verification document for MICAP
  and other back ordered parts. In addition, the local supplement will provide operating
  procedures for reparable processing and flow of documentation.
  7.2.4. Ensure bench stock is checked prior to input of issue request. The part number
  sequence S04 will be available for checking element bench stock.
  7.2.5. If a parts request is made to the FSS for which there is no established item record, the
  FSS will contact the LRS Customer Service and provide NSN, part number, T.O. reference,
  and priority. Customer Service will then perform all mandatory actions as required by
  AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2, Part 2, Chapter 27. They will load the item record/part number
  detail record (1AA) immediately and notify the FSS. As a wing/base option, FSS may
  process new item record loads. Processing will then proceed in accordance with provisions
  outlined in this chapter. The FSS will process part number detail record updates (1AA) when
  research reveals an incorrect part number or an NSN is loaded without a corresponding part
  number.
  7.2.6. The FSS will retain copies 2, and 3 of DD Form 1348-1A, Issue Document, to
  facilitate processing of the reparable asset to the repair shop or FSC.
     7.2.6.1. If the reparable asset and reusable container are available at the time of the issue
     request, FSS personnel will take the property, AFTO Form 350, reusable container, and
     copies 2, and 3 of the DD Form 1348-1A to the repair shop or FSC. MICAP items will
     be moved immediately and all others within 2 hours after receipt of the reparable item in
     the FSS. FSS personnel will give copies 2 and 3 of the DD Form 1348-1A to the repair
     shop or FSC along with the property. Copy 2 will be annotated by repair shop or FSC
     personnel with the appropriate DIFM location, "Z" status (if available), signed, dated,
     time and given to the FSS driver who will return it to the FSS. Upon return of copy 2 to
     the FSS, personnel will input DIFM location/status on the remote device. Copy 2 of the
38                                            PACAFI23-203_374AWSUP_I 27 JULY 2010


     DD Form 1348-1A will then be filed (document number sequence) and maintained IAW
     AFM 37-139. Retaining copy 2 will delete the requirement for maintaining AF Form
     2520 except for tracking items that require multiple shop processing.
     7.2.6.2. If the reparable asset is not available at the time of issue, FSS personnel will
     hold copies 2 and 3 until the maintenance technician brings in the reparable asset and
     reusable container. The reparable asset and container should be received within two
     hours of issue. Once received, personnel will process the property and documentation
     IAW para 7.2.6.1 above.
     7.2.6.3. The Propulsion FSS will ensure all serially controlled and time change item parts
     tracked on aircraft engines have an Automated Operating Time Report attached to the
     condition tag (IAW T.O. 00-20-3) prior to processing these parts to the FSC. In addition,
     Automated Ground Engine Test Systems (AGETS) Components Removal Reports will
     be attached to the condition tag.
 7.2.7. If the part is not available for issue, an Other Asset Management Notice (I023) will be
 output. The remote operator will review the management notice for other possible assets.
  7.2.8. If the part is not available, the technician enters the document number on the end item
  form and notifies the shop chief. The technician checks FEDLOG (if available), IS&G
  (IMDS/G081/SBSS/ES-S interface screen #770), and technical order for substitute part
  numbers/next higher assembly and then have the FSS check the master bench stock listing.
  These actions are annotated on the reverse side of the controlling document
  (IMDS/G081/SBSS/ES-S interface screen image). The FSS processes the requirement
  following these procedures.
     7.2.8.1. During Post-Post the FSS will manually prepare a DD Form 1348-1A and
     annotate/stamp the name document "POST-POST DUE-OUT NOTICE FOR
     REPARABLE PROCESSING ONLY."
     7.2.8.2. The FSS will retain the management notices containing the input image for
     future reparable processing and ensure IMDS/G081 update.
     7.2.8.3. Units with ES-S access will load the new MICAP requirement into the ES-S
     with all pertinent verification data (See AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2, Part 2, Chapter 17,
     PACAF Supplement). Additionally, the requester will load the following statement in the
     ES-S bullet ―AFGLSC PLEASE WORK…Date, Time, and Initials.‖
     7.2.8.4. For delayed discrepancies, the FSS reprints the issue, screen #497, option 28
     with document number input, TEX code ―M‖ and the appropriate UJC.
     7.2.8.5. For future action/flow for MICAP incidents, see Chapter 5.
     7.2.8.6. When parts due-out release (DOR) from off-base sources, LRS Vehicle Ops will
     deliver the part to the FSS. When DORs occur at the FSC as a result of a serviceable
     turn-in, the FSS will be contacted to pick up and sign for the property. MICAP DORs
     will be picked up immediately and all others within 2 hours. Regardless of parts source,
     the property, with attached DD Form 1348-1A, will be placed in the FSS PHB.
 7.2.9. Post-Post processing will be as outlined in AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2, Part 2,
 Chapter 32 using J Deck 8000 series numbers.
PACAFI23-203_374AWSUP_I 27 JULY 2010                                                           39


       7.2.9.1. FSS remote operators will be members of the PPCT under the direction of the
       PPCT chief during Post-Post processing.
       7.2.9.2. The APS will be the central point for after hours Post-Post processing.
       Personnel from the FSS will process their transactions to completion.
   7.2.10. Requests for initial issue will be submitted by the requesting organization
   commander or superintendent and submitted to the LRS/CC or his/her designated
   representative. For an urgent situation, verbal approval is authorized, but the paperwork
   must be submitted NLT 24 hours following approval. Once approved, the FSS will process
   the issue request with the appropriate demand code specified in AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2,
   Part II 2, Chapter 11. Requests that require other than demand code R, will have to be
   ordered through the SBSS/ES-S page.
7.3. FSS Security. Access to the FSS will be restricted to FSS assigned/FSS escorted
personnel.
7.4. Supply Remote User Responsibilities. The FSS is responsible to the LRS for proper
supply remote operation. Rejects caused by the FSS will be cleared using the D818 or reject
notice. If rejects cannot be cleared by transaction, request assistance from the LRS Reject
Manager. Since the FSS will be producing accountable source documents over its remote, the
FSS is also responsible to the LRS for documents generated in the section. Consequently, the
FSS will be provided a complete copy of the Delinquent Document Listing (to include the
Delinquent Source Document (DSD) portion).
7.5. Direct Not Reparable This Station (NRTS). The FSS will take repair cycle items
identified as direct NRTS to the FSC. Direct NRTS items will be identified and the QO4 updated
at least semiannually by MSL and the repair shops.
7.6. Parts Holding Bin (PHB) Management. Each FSS will establish a system for positive
control of PHB assets. Property placed in PHB will be identified by appropriately attached
documentation (i.e., DD Form 1348-1A/AFTO Form 350 (Part One)). In addition, a method for
recording these assets will be established and this control record should contain the following:
date item received, applicable end item, part and serial number, and other pertinent data as
desired. When property is removed from the PHB, record the end item, part serial number, date,
time, and signature of individual picking up the property. If the end item serial number differs
from the end item serial number that the property was turned in against, the FSS will check the
cannibalization log to ensure the cannibalization processed correctly.
7.7. Reparable Status. COSO uses standard DIFM status codes except AWM and INW for
items in the repair shop. For items in the repair shop and not AWP, the shop will provide instead
a three position status code that indicates the ETIC. This status code will reflect first position
"Z" followed by last two positions of Julian date (e.g., Z84 = 25 May) that the shop expects to
return that item serviceable.
7.8. Cannibalization. If the flight/shop chief decides to cannibalize, he/she notifies the FSS.
Cannibalizations of serially controlled and TCI engine parts are coordinated with the EMS. The
FSS with ES-S access will record cannibalization in a local cannibalization log. The FSS also
updates supply computer records (ES-S/SBSS) using NOR Format H or J. For engine-to-engine
cannibalization the FSS sends the removal copy (T) of the IMDS/G081 workorder notification to
the technician performing the cannibalization action and retains the installation copy (U) of the
 40                                            PACAFI23-203_374AWSUP_I 27 JULY 2010


IMDS/G081 workorder notification in suspense until the replacement parts are received. For
engine-to-aircraft cannibalizations, the receiving MSS is responsible for generating the
cannibalization workorder (screen #053, option 8) and provides the workorder notifications and
I004 management notice printout to the FSS. When the replacement part is received in the FSS,
the FSS forwards the U copy workorder notification to the scheduler. FSS personnel will
reconcile the cannibalization log daily with the shop production manager and EMS and comply
with the additional guidance contained in T.O. 00-20-2.
7.9. Reusable Containers. Reusable container storage is the responsibility of the applicable
repair shop. Reparable items are to be routed through the repair cycle with reusable container.
When a serviceable item releases (DOR) with a reusable container and the reparable is already in
the repair cycle, the FSS will deliver the container to the applicable repair shop. If the
unserviceable item has been shipped off-base, the reusable container will be delivered to the
local reusable container storage area.
7.10. Administrative Mark-For Changes. When the flight/shop chief decides to use a DOR
asset for another end item, the FSS will do a transfer through IMDS/G081 and then process a
NOR Format E or J using ES-S/SBSS. Administrative mark-for changes on engine TCI will be
coordinated with the EMS.
7.11. Production Scheduling. See AFI 21-101 for Propulsion Flight scheduling procedures and
AGE scheduling.
7.12. Document Validation Procedures. The FSS reviews the Document Validation Report
(DVR) monthly, ensuring that all supported workcenters discrepancies are resolved.
