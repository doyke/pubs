This supplement implements and extends the guidance of Air Force Instruction (AFI) 10-401,
Air Force Operations Planning and Execution. This instruction applies to Air Force Reserve
Command (AFRC) procedures for use in conjunction with the basic AFI. This publication does
not apply to the Air National Guard (ANG). It identifies and clarifies AFRC force presentation,
generation and sustainment. The supplement captures policy, guidance and processes unique to
how this command supports Global Force Management (GFM) and the Air Force Air and Space
Expeditionary Force (AEF) concept.            It identifies the standup and current roles and
responsibilities of the Force Generation Center (FGC) and as the primary execution agent
responsible to meet utilization of Reserve asset requirements. FGC roles, responsibilities and
processes will be in on-going development through August 2012, Full Operational Capability
(FOC) Initiative - in general, attained when all units and/or organizations in the force structure
scheduled to receive a system 1) have received it and 2) have the ability to employ and maintain
it. The FGC Forces Division acts as the MAJCOM AEF Cell. Refer recommended changes and
questions about this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF IMT
847, Recommendation for Change of Publication; route AF Form 847s from the field through the
appropriate functional chain of command. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes
prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN)
33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with Air Force Records
Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at
https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm.

1.10.1.1.1. (Added) AFRC participates in Global Force Management (GFM) by identifying
assets to meet Air Force requirements utilizing the Air Force Combat Air Forces (CAF),

Mobility Air Forces (MAF) and Expeditionary Combat Service (ECS) Consolidated Planning
Schedules (CPS).
1.10.4. AFRC/A5XW is the Global Force Management policy and guidance OPR.
2.4.2.4.1. (Added) AFRC assets are not normally postured in an Enabler Library.
2.4.2.4.1.1. (Added) HQ FAMs can request Enabler Band posturing as opposed to placing
assets in the AFRC Base Alignment Template when similar AC capability is postured in an
Enabler Band.
2.4.2.4.1.2. (Added) Requests to posture in an Enabler Band will be included in the AFRC
Base Alignment Template approval process.
2.4.2.4.1.3. (Added) HQ FAMs provide a talking paper discussing the pros/cons for utilizing
an Enabler Band in lieu of posturing in the AFRC Base Alignment Template.
2.4.2.4.1.4. (Added) Requests to posture in an Enabler Band out of cycle with the Base
Alignment Template approval process will follow the FAM Two-Year Plan process.
2.4.3.2. AFRC FAMs and the Force Generation Center comply with the AF/A5XW and
AFPC/DPW AEF Sourcing and Tasking message’s guidance and timelines. See Attachment 6
for FGC AEF Volunteer Sourcing process.
2.5.1.1. (Added) AFRC unit personnel can volunteer with Wing Commander approval anytime
with coordination through their respective FAM. However, volunteering with approvals does not
guarantee a tasking. IMAs may volunteer for deployment with assigned unit active duty
commander approval and RMG Program Manager concurrence.
2.5.1.2. (Added) AFRC capability can participate in an on-call role only when in the correct
legal status.
2.5.1.3. (Added) Lead MAJCOM will provide the required MPA or an approved mobilization
authorization prior to a reservist entering on-call status.
2.5.3.1. (Added) AFRC personnel assigned to UTCs and postured in the UTA will not be
assigned an AEFI. Forces assigned to a UTC are visible and made available to the AC via the
UTA.
2.9.3.1. ADCON is defined by Air Force and Joint Doctrine. In accordance with established
doctrine AFRC/CC retains ADCON over all AFRC forces in all states short of full-mobilization.
However, specified ADCON will be exercised by the COMAFFOR over reserve component
forces.
2.9.3.2. Combatant Command (COCOM) is established by 10 USC § 167 and exercised only by
commanders of combatant commands. Operational Control (OPCON) and Tactical Control
(TACON) are subordinate authorities defined by Air Force and Joint Doctrine. OPCON is
inherent in COCOM. TACON is inherent in OPCON.
2.9.3.3. (Added) The authority to discipline forces is inherent in all command authorities
(ADCON, COCOM, OPCON, TACON) and may be exercised concurrently by the ADCON and
operational chains-of-command. The Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) grants
jurisdiction to commanders to enforce good order and discipline and delineates offenses. Good
order and discipline is enforced through both administrative and military justice means. Air
AFI10-401_AFRCSUP 19 JUNE 2012                                                              3


Force Instructions implement and provide further guidance for specific actions. As a general
proposition, military justice actions are covered in 51 series AFIs and adverse administrative
actions are covered in 36 series AFIs.
2.9.4. (Added) TFI Associations. TFI associations are governed by AFI 90-1001, Total Force
Integration and the specific agreements establishing the association. Normally, members of the
two associated units are not in the same ADCON chain of command. As a consequence, AFI 90-
1001 creates the concept of Operational Direction (OPDIR) as a substitute for direct command
authority. OPDIR will be the usual relationship across command lines within the association
when it is in garrison. When members of an association “rainbow” to fill a UTC or otherwise
become members of the same Air Expeditionary unit, they will still be subject to differing
ADCON chains, but will be under the singular specified ADCON of the COMAFFOR and the
same COCOM/OPCON/TACON chain of command. These latter authorities (not OPDIR) will
define the relationship of these members during the course of the ongoing military operations.
2.14.6. AFRC/A5XW is the AFRC OPR for the USAF War and Mobilization Plan (WMP).

DCAPES CRM code in the CCDR's TPFDD.
3.5.3.4.2. AFRC/A5XW is the command’s OPR for attending OPlan planning conferences;
receiving, sourcing, and verifying Support Commander’s TPFDDs; and, participating in required
OPlan development and refinement conferences.
3.6. AFRC forces are subject to Crisis Planning Orders only when they are subject to military
authority. (See paragraph 3.8.) Accordingly, competent authority must place reserve personnel
on orders as volunteers or direct them to report as part of an involuntary recall to Active Duty for
Crisis Planning Orders to lawfully apply to them. Involuntary recall is defined under AFI 10-402,
Vol I and AFH 10-416.
3.7.4.2.1. (Added) Requests to fill AMC “G”-series requirement commander billets who do
not qualify IAW AFI 10-401.3.7.4.2 require AFRC/CV approval.

3.8.1. For reserve members to be subject to military authority they must be placed in a military
status through activation. Orders or taskings (other than an order to report as part of an
involuntary recall to Active Duty) are not enforceable under the UCMJ when a reservist is in
civilian status. Involuntary recall is defined under AFI 10-402, Vol I and AFH 10-416.
3.8.1.1. (Added)    Volunteerism is the primary means utilized by AFRC to fill Air Force
requirements.

3.8.1.1.1 (Added) While volunteers should primarily come from those wings/units in the AEF
vulnerability period, volunteers with their Wing CC’s approval can be accepted from throughout
the command.

3.8.1.2. (Added) AGR Volunteerism.
3.8.1.2.1. (Added) AGRs are ordered to duty under the authority of Title 10 U.S.C. § 12301(d)
which authorizes the Secretary of Defense to call a member of the Reserve to active duty. AGRs
are then categorized by the law as Headquarters officer AGR, Headquarters enlisted AGR, or
unit AGR.
3.8.1.2.2. (Added) Title 10 U.S.C. § 10211 establishes Headquarters officer AGRs, placing
them “at the seat of government, and at headquarters responsible for reserve affairs, to participate
in preparing and administering the policies and regulations affecting those reserve components.”
3.8.1.2.3. (Added) Title 10 U.S.C § 12310 establishes Headquarters enlisted AGRs and all unit
AGRs “to perform Active Guard and Reserve duty organizing, administering, recruiting,
instructing, or training the reserve components.”
3.8.1.2.4. (Added) Title 10 law severely limits AGR deployments that are not in direct support
of reserve missions. The congressional intent in this law is clear and specifically drives the
following AGR deployment policy.
3.8.1.2.5. (Added) Under no circumstances will a Headquarters AGR be involuntarily tasked
to fulfill an active duty deployment requirement.
3.8.1.2.6. (Added) Voluntary AGR deployments will be considered on a case-by-case basis
when it is in the best interests of the Air Force Reserve, provides a significant career
development opportunity for the AGR, and meets the requirements in the paragraph above.
3.8.1.2.7. (Added) Unit AGRs, as participating members of a UTC-tasked Air Force Reserve
unit may be involuntarily tasked as part of an Air Force Reserve AEF deployment rotation.
3.8.1.2.8. (Added) All volunteer AGR deployment requests will be considered using the
following criteria. Maximum tour lengths will coincide with current Air Force standard AEF
deployment length. The current standard is 179 days, but maximum tour length per this
instruction will adjust with AF policy. If the current standard increases to 365 days or more, this
instruction will be reviewed to ensure compliance with applicable law and regulations. Required
ancillary training and travel days to and from the AOR are not included in tour-length
consideration.
AFI10-401_AFRCSUP 19 JUNE 2012                                                                    7


3.8.1.2.9. (Added) Only AGRs who have been granted “career status” as set out in AFI 36-
2132, Full-Time Support Active Guard Reserve Program will be eligible to volunteer for
deployment and no AGR may deploy within 12 months of their DOS.
3.8.1.2.10. (Added) The ratio for any AGR volunteering to deploy will be set to the current
career field dwell ratio, i.e., 1:5 or 1:4. (6-month deployment will require 30 (1:5) or 24 (1:4) at
home station before eligible to deploy again)
3.8.1.2.11. (Added) AGR deployments exceeding 179 days require the following approval:
3.8.1.2.11.1. (Added) HQ AFRC AGR deployments require AFRC/CV approval.

3. 8.1.2.11.2.   (Added) All other HQ AGRs require AF/RE(D) approval.

3.8.1.2.11.3. (Added) All colonel AGR deployment requests must be coordinated through
AFRC/A1L.
3.8.1.2.11.4. (Added) Approved AGR deployments will be routed through HQ AFRC/A1A
(for O-5s and below) or HQ AFRC/A1L (for O-6s).
3.8.1.2.11.5. (Added) For AGR deployment questions, contact HQ AFRC/A1A at DSN 497-
1461 for AGR O-5s and below and HQ AFRC/A1L at DSN 497-1743 for all O-6s.
3.8.1.3. (Added) Aviation (MAF/CAF) Volunteerism.
3.8.1.3.1. (Added) MAF IPT. AMC/AFRC/ANG holds MAF IPT meetings, scheduled by
AMC/A3O every 4 months and approximately one year prior to the 4-month AEF being planned.
Attended by AMC, ANG and AFRC to discuss changes to AEF schedule. AFRC/A3X,
AFRC/A3T, AFRC/A4 POCs attend for AFRC. Dwell numbers and planned COCOM changes
are discussed, and resultant AEF requirements changes are discussed.
3.8.1.3.2. (Added) CAF SIPT. The CAF Scheduling Integrated Product Team (SIPT) is
hosted by ACC/A3O and members include ACC/ANG/AFRC/PACAF and USAFE. The AFRC
attendees are the AFRC/DA3 and members of AFRC/A3X and A3T, if available; the
AFRC/DA3 is the voting member and AFRC/A3XX is the executive secretary and does most of
the coordination for flying deployment taskings. The CAF SIPT meets semiannually.
3.8.1.3.2.1. (Added) ACC/A3O is the manager of the CAF Aviation Schedule, the electronic
scheduling system that CAF SIPT results are posted on. The AFRC/DA3 and AFRC/A3XX
have access to the schedule and data entry/coordination privileges. AFRC/A3XX coordinates on
these contingency and training/exercise documents in the CAF Aviation Schedule process for
AFRC, after coordinating through 10AF. These steps are the only official coordination method
for taskings; all other forums are preparatory or planning in nature.
3.8.1.3.2.2. (Added) The CAF Aviation Schedule is a 2-year process. Proposed aviation unit
taskings are received in a number of methods; ACC FAM to AFRC FAM, mobilization
packages, AEF PLANORD, or Aviation Change Request (ACR). However, official taskings is
received only through the coordination of PLANORDs/DEPORDs via SIPRNET.
3.8.1.3.2.2.1. (Added) QUICKLOOK Contingency Schedule. The QUICKLOOK Contingency
Schedule is a compilation of established or projected deployments by AC/ARC units based on
AEF alignment, dwell factors and availability. It is loaded into the schedule for coordination by
 8                                                      AFI10-401_AFRCSUP 19 JUNE 2012


all commands. This is the first consolidated event listing that commands see for comment. It is
loaded and sent for coordination about 2 years in advance of the 4 month period in question.
3.8.1.3.2.2.2. (Added) PLANORD. The ACC PLANORD is published by ACC/A3O about 6
months prior to the AEF deployment window for that 4 month period. It is the result of the
coordinated QUICKLOOK as well as changes received/coordinated after that.
3.8.1.3.2.2.3. (Added) DEPORD. The DEPORD is published about 2-3 months prior to the
AEF deployment window for that 4 month period. Once a deployment is published on the
DEPORD, it is considered an official tasking.
3.8.1.4. (Added) Aviation-Only Training/Exercises/Inspection Scheduling. The exercise
and training schedule is built in 4 month increments with initial call for events 12-16 months in
advance. ACC FAMs submit proposed ACC unit taskings based on AEF preparatory
requirements; AFRC/A3X requests units (through 10AF) to submit known training events at this
point. The proposed training/exercise schedule is posted at the end of the 2 week input period.
Due to the advanced nature of the build, few AFRC events are finalized this far out.
3.8.1.4.1. (Added) Initial Executability Review. About 12 months in advance of the 4 month
period (approximately the second week of February, second week of June, second week of
October), as a result of compiling and deconflicting the initial call for events, ACC/A3O
publishes the Initial Executability Review, which lists all known training/exercise events for
coordination with affected commands. Units/commands have about 30 days to work any
reclamma taskings.
3.8.1.4.2. (Added) Final Executability Review. About 11 months in advance of the 4 month
period, (approximately last week of March, last week of July, last week of November), the Final
Executability Review is published for comment (by exception). The units/commands have about
one week to provide comments before the schedule is “frozen”. Training/exercise events after
the final executability review can be submitted by the command OPR (AFRC/A3X) via ACR
after this. AFRC/A3X submits ACRs to place them in the Aviation Schedule for “credit”.
3.8.2. AFRC/A5XW is the command’s OPR for mobilization policy and guidance.
3.8.3.1.1. (Added) AFRC FAM Two-Year Utilization Plans will be developed when their
functional AC capability changes to Tempo Band D. AFRC FAMs will utilize the FAM Two-
Year Plan process to obtain CV approval to change Tempo Bands IAW Attachment 4.
3.8.3.1.2. (Added) HQ FAMs will not include IMA capability when developing their Two-
Year Plan. The IMA should be identified with the appropriate UTC to augment active duty
deployment requirements based on the HAF FAM two year utilization plan.
3.8.3.1.2.1. (Added) Aviation IMAs may not be utilized to fill active flying requirements.
Aviation IMAs considered for mobilization are utilized to fill single person non-flying ULN
requirements.
3.8.5.1. (Added) While mobilization authorization is authorized, AFR members can choose to
deploy as MPA volunteers.
3.8.5.1.1. (Added) Mobilization authority is executed when a volunteer no longer desires to
deploy in MPA status.
AFI10-401_AFRCSUP 19 JUNE 2012                                                                 9


3.15.1. (Added) Units participating in operations as part of a continuous AEF cycle will submit
AARs to their AEF HHQ NLT than 45 days following the end of their deployment. Individual
Lessons Learned (L2) deserving urgent attention should not be delayed for inclusion in the next
AAR but should be forwarded up the chain of command via AF-JLLIS as soon as sufficient
information is gathered. The goal is to get the information to the next set of deployers and/or

is postured when the AC capability realigns to Tempo Band C/B.
7.12.4.1.4.1. (Added) AFRC/CV is waiver authority for AFRC FAMs requesting to align
capability in a different Tempo Band than the one to which the unit is assigned. FAMs use the
AFRC FAM Two-Year Plan process as a guide for their waiver request.
7.12.4.2. The two-hit policy is not applicable to AFRC.
7.12.4.5.1. (Added) AFRC FAMs will develop a Two-Year Plan (Tempo Band “M, N and
Enabler”) when the AC capability is rebanded to Tempo Band C/D. The FAM Two-Year Plan
data template is at Attachment 4.
7.12.8.2. AFRC/CV approves release of Enabler assets for AFPC/DPW sourcing.
7.14.2.3.1. (Added) Unit Commanders working with the AFRC FAMs, will review their
identified home station requirements coding. Deployable military resources will be the last
resources applied to the minimum home station mission; civilian and contractor resources will be
applied first. This ensures the unit can provide the maximum deployable capability while still
meeting the minimum critical home station requirements.
7.14.4.1. (Added) Unit commanders validate UTC P-coding during monthly review of both
ART assessments and AEF Library extracts. If standard UTCs (those found in ART) are
determined to be inappropriately coded, unit commanders will contact the UTC responsible
AFRC FAM and provide proposed coding and rationale for change. The AFRC FAM will work
with AFRC/A1MR and AFRC/A5XW to determine support for the requested change. If the
change request is considered significant, the AFRC FAM may request that the proposed change
be coordinated/approved by the wing commander or equivalent.
7.15.3.2. AFRC FAMs will follow paragraph 7.9.1.2.1.
7.17.1.3.1. AFRC will not posture overages. Overages are normally temporary fills waiting
some personnel action. Units will identify overages in the AEF Reporting Tool (ART)
Commander’s Remarks section.
7.17.1.7.4. (Added) If UMD authorizations can no longer support the postured UTCs the FAM
will work with both the unit, AFRC/A1MW and AFRC/A5XW to rectify posturing disconnects.
7.17.4.6.1. (Added) The MAJCOM/CV makes the final determination on the number of UTCs
that can be home station (DXX) coded. Significant changes to coding require wing commander
or equivalent concurrence. Unit commanders are responsible for obtaining and documenting
wing commander concurrence.
8.10.5. (Added) If sourcing is performed by a non-AFRC entity and the HQ FAM and FGC
have not coordinated on the process and/or sourcing methodology used, the sourcing will be
viewed as a nomination for sourcing. When this occurs, the nominated sourcing must be
confirmed by a wing’s deployment office and HQ FAM, and verified by the FGC to be viewed
as valid sourcing.

response and processes the recommended response for MAJCOM CV approval.
8.14.8.2.2.2.1.3. (Added) Risk assessments response will be processed through the TMT tasker
system.
8.14.8.2.2.1.1.4. (Added) Aviation risk analysis recommended response will be sourced
through A4, A2, SG and IG for the views of others and be incorporated in the A3 TMT tasker to
obtain CV approval.
8.14.8.2.2.1.1.5. (Added) ECS risk analysis recommended response will be staffed through the
IG for the views of others and be incorporated in the functional Director’s TMT tasker to obtain
CV approval.

discrepancies, concerns or suggestions should be vetted to the AFRC/FAM for further guidance.
The AFRC FAM will coordinate with AFRC/A5XW and AFRC/A1MW for applicable changes.
Units/organizations will be required to coordinate recommended changes with their wing
commander or equivalent. The HQ FAM will coordinate requested changes with AFRC/A1MW
and AFRC/A5XW. If all parties are in concurrence with changes, AFRC/A5XW will change the
coding in the AEF Libraries. If the AFRC/FAM does not concur with the proposed changes,
AFI10-401_AFRCSUP 19 JUNE 2012                                                               13


then HQ AFRC/A5XW will arbitrate proposals. However, wing commander’s position will
normally take priority.
9.9.1. MAJCOM/CV is approval authority to release Enabler assets for AFPC/DPW sourcing.
9.9.1.2.2.7. (Added) For AFRC, the AEFC works with AFRC/A1L for 0-6 deployment
requirements: (NOTE: All colonel AEF or other deployments must be approved by the Vice
Commander, Air Force Reserve Command, before the individual is authorized to depart on any
type of deployment.)
9.9.1.2.2.7.1. (Added) The AEF tasking Matrix is prepared by AFPC/DPWSM several months
prior to the start of the AEF cycle and coordinated with all MAJCOMs.
9.9.1.2.2.7.2. (Added) Taskings assigned to AFRC are advertised on HQ AFRC/A1L website,
(https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/community/views/home.aspx?Filter=RC-DP-00-27), in order of
their AEF Cycle. Each tasking is advertised for 30 days or more, depending upon the requested
reporting date.

9.9.1.2.2.7.6. (Added) HQ AFRC/A1L contacts selectee and confirms availability.
9.9.1.2.2.7.7. (Added) AFRC/A1L reaffirms CV selection and confirms concurrence via e-mail
with member's supervisor, RMG Program Manager and RMG/DPX (IMAs only), and HQ AFRC
IG (for clearance).
9.9.1.2.2.7.8. (Added) Approval e-mail is to AFPC/DPWSM who sources ULN/LNR
(R10MFBPP/UNIT TR & 963IF1Z2/IMA), then emails the FGC/FGF to verify tasking in
DCAPES.
9.9.1.2.2.7.9. (Added) FGC/FGFA or FGC/FGFE will source and verify and send email
confirming completion.
9.9.1.2.2.7.10. (Added) Unit member will work with wing LRS on out-processing and IMAs

who submits a recommendation to the AFRC/CV for approval.
 14                                                       AFI10-401_AFRCSUP 19 JUNE 2012


9.9.1.2.7.4.3. (Added) AFRC A3 staffs the nominee list through the FGC and AFRC/IG for
inclusion of the views of others.
9.9.1.4.1. (Added) When AFPC/DPW wants to source an Associate UTC from the AEF
TPFDD Libraries or UTC Availability Summary, they must coordinate the nomination with the
AFRC FAM prior to the nomination. This additional requirement is present since Associate
UTC readiness is not currently maintained in ART and; therefore, only the AFRC FAM can
determine the true readiness of an Associate UTC.
9.9.1.6. AFRC CV approves release of Enabler assets for AFPC/DPW sourcing.
9.9.3.2. FGC/FGF acts as the MAJCOM AEF Cell in this role.
9.9.4.1. (Added) Reservists Entitlements and benefits. See Attachment 3, Summary of
Entitlements for Reservists on Orders to Active Duty. Summary indicates entitlements/benefits
by duration of orders and also includes an asterisk (*) for some items. Orders must state in
support of contingency operations to be eligible for those Entitlements/Benefits.
9.9.4.2. (Added) Early TRICARE Notification. References: National Defense Authorization
Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2008 and NDAA for FY 2010 codified at Title 10, United
states Code, 1074 and DoDI 7730.54, RCCPDS, March 31, 2008; incorporating Change 2, July
28, 2010. RC members (on active duty orders for more than 30 days) and their family members
are eligible for TRICARE benefits for up to 180 days prior to activation. RC members and
their DEERS enrolled members become eligible effective on the orders issuing (certification)
date.
9.9.4.3. (Added) Mobilization Orders. Orders clerks should begin processing mobilization
orders immediately upon receipt of the lead MAJCOM’s Mobilization authority message.
9.9.4.3.1. (Added) Once an individual's information is loaded against the requirement in
DCAPES, the orders clerk submits the MPA request via CMAS, which is validated by the
FGC/FGS.
9.9.4.3.2. (Added) Once the mobilization or MPA order is certified in AROWS, the data on the
order, i.e., "Notification Date", "Effective Date", "Expiration Date”, and "Executive Order" will
flow from AROWS to the MOB area of the Military Personnel Data System (MilPDS) via
automatic interface. The data within MilPDS flows to DEERS to start the member's
entitlements/benefits.
9.9.4.4. (Added) 44-Day Military Leave. ARTs are authorized 44 additional workdays of
military leave in a calendar year. There are conditions placed on the use of this leave that are
addressed below. Timekeepers should use the administrative leave code (LN) to record use of
this category of military leave and supervisors must maintain a manual log to track the number of
hours used during the calendar year and ensure the maximum number of hours are not exceeded.
9.9.4.4.1. (Added) Military leave under this section can only be used to perform “active duty
without military pay” for participation in combat and non-combat operations outside the United
States, its territories and possessions. It is appropriate to use this leave on the day of deployment
from home station, any intervening stops within the United States, its territories and possessions,
and the day of return to home station as long as the ultimate destination on the military orders is
an overseas location and any intermediate destinations/stops are part of the continuing mission.
In addition, UAS crews conducting operations OCONUS from locations physically located
AFI10-401_AFRCSUP 19 JUNE 2012                                                                   15


CONUS are authorized to use this type of leave. ARTs receive their basic civilian pay, to
include premium pay for regularly scheduled overtime work that would have been earned during
the period covered by this leave, and points toward Reserve retirement while in this duty status.
Regularly scheduled overtime work means overtime work that is part of the employee’s regularly
scheduled administrative workweek. Within AFRC this is usually only applicable to firefighters
and law enforcement personnel. It does not apply to additional hours of work performed while
TDY, callback overtime, or additional hours of work performed due to long distance flights.
This is irregular or occasional work. Overtime pay, compensatory time or credit hours may not
be earned for performing work beyond the regular civilian work schedule while on “AD without
pay” since the employee is performing this work in military status. Military leave under this
section can be intermingled with traditional military leave, annual leave, leave-without pay
(Absent-US), earned compensatory time, and credit hours.
9.9.4.4.2. (Added) This military leave category is available on a calendar year basis and
leftover balances cannot be carried over to the next calendar year. The 44 days are converted
into hours and charged on the same basis that annual leave is charged. ARTs who work 80-hour
pay periods (including flexible and compressed work schedules) are entitled to a maximum of
352 hours. This category of military leave is charged for civilian workdays only. This means
that if an ART chooses to use only this category of leave for a military tour of duty that includes
weekends/holidays/scheduled days off (SDO), there would be no civilian pay received for those
days. In order for an ART to receive any pay for a civilian non workday, a change to “active
duty with pay” status is required. This requires use of a separate AF Form 938 for each period of
conversion. Changes to civilian duty status on workdays during the same military tour are also
authorized, if appropriate, and require the use of a DD Form 1610. Use of this military leave is
at the employee’s discretion.
9.9.4.4.3. (Added) Use of this category of military leave is not appropriate in Hawaii, Alaska,
Puerto Rico, or Guam unless the ultimate destination on the military orders is an overseas
location and one of these locations is an intermediate stop that is part of the continuing mission.
Use of this category of military leave is appropriate for Panama at all times, since it is no longer
considered a US possession.
9.9.4.4.4. (Added) Since the employee is on “active duty without military pay,” all
jurisdictional issues are covered by the military system; i.e., the employee is covered under the
UCMJ, injury compensation is covered under line-of-duty procedures, reimbursement for travel,
per diem, and lodging are computed based on military entitlements, etc. Certain military
entitlements such as Family Separation Pay and Hazardous Duty Pay will not apply due to the
fact they are only applicable when member is on a “military pay status”.
9.9.4.5. (Added) 22-Day Military Leave. There are two conditions when an ART is
authorized 22 days of military leave; in support of civil authorities in the protection of life and
property and those who perform full-time military service as a result of a call or order to active
duty in support of a contingency operation.
9.9.4.5.1. (Added) Although the DCPS code “LL” (Law Enforcement) may be used it is
recommended that “KG” (Absent-US) be used until the member returns to duty in order to avoid
any DFAS complications. When using this type of military leave, the ART receives all military
pay and allowances (excluding travel, transportation, and per diem allowances) and any civilian
pay that exceeds that amount. A DFAS remedy ticket will apply leave to the days leave is
 16                                                     AFI10-401_AFRCSUP 19 JUNE 2012


required and adjust civilian pay records for any funds due to the employee. This action must be
processed through the local FM representative. Employees may use Absent-US intermittently
with annual leave, military leave, compensatory time off, or credit time earned. An SF 50 should
be used to document an employee’s use of Absent-US for duty with the uniformed services of
one day or longer. There is no AFRC requirement to process return-to-duty actions for each
period of paid leave. Note: When Absent-US “KG” is entered into DCPS the balance of credit
and compensatory time will be paid to the employee.
9.9.4.6. (Added) Post Deployment/Mobilization Respite Absence (PDMRA). The Secretary
of Defense has directed establishment of a program to recognize members who are required to
mobilize or deploy with a frequency beyond established rotational goals. PDMRA became that
program and was established as a new category of administrative absence.
9.9.4.6.1. (Added) Personnel must be currently mobilized in order to be eligible for PDMRA.
Personnel performing duty in a volunteer status to one of the creditable areas as outlined in the
Mar 08 AFRC policy memo, will have that documented as creditable time pending the next time
they are mobilized. PDMRA OPR is A1XX
9.9.4.6.2. (Added) The wing Installation Personnel Readiness (IPR office) using MilPDS and
DCAPES data completes the PDMRA worksheet when unit Reserve members are identified for
mobilization.
9.9.4.6.2.1. (Added) When an IMA is identified for mobilization, the RMG Detachment
completes the PDMRA worksheet.
9.9.4.6.3. (Added) Once the creditable tours have been collected that data along with some
pertinent data from the mobilization authority message must be entered on to the Air Force
approved PDRMA calculator/spreadsheet. This is the only authorized method of performing
PDMRA calculations.
9.9.4.6.4. (Added) Once the calculations are complete, the affected member(s) must be
afforded an opportunity to review the PDRMA calculator/spreadsheet. If any data is determined
to be missing /incorrect and not available in the previously mentioned systems of record, the
burden of proof rests with the member to provide the information to their IDO.
9.9.4.6.5. (Added) Upon the member’s return from deployment, the PDMRA spreadsheet must
be submitted to AFRC/A1RR within 3 duty days of the member’s return. Upon receipt of the
spreadsheet AFRC/A1RR will validate the data. If it is determined the data is correct
AFRC/A1RR will approve PDMRA if applicable and approve demobilization dates within the
mobilization authority. If the award of PDMRA takes a member beyond the mobilization
authority the spreadsheet is forwarded to AF/A5XW for their adjudication.
9.9.4.6.5.1. (Added) Upon receipt of the adjudicated spreadsheet AFRC/A1RR will return the
spreadsheet to the applicable IPR(s) and/or RMG/DPX. Upon receipt the affected member’s
mobilization order must be amended as authorized in the spreadsheet.
9.9.4.7. (Added) Reconstitution/Downtime. Under current operations AF/A5XW has
determined that the majority of the mobilized personnel aren’t authorized Reconstitution.
According to AF/A1M MPA Policy Update (21 May 11), personnel are entitled to 2 days of Post
Deployment Administrative Action time for out-processing if not authorized downtime. Any
personnel requiring anything beyond this will have to be approved by the lead MAJCOM and
AFI10-401_AFRCSUP 19 JUNE 2012                                                                17


AF/A5XW. All requests should be worked through the functional community with information
copies to FGC/FGFM, Mobilization Branch, and AFRC/A1RR. IMA requests will be routed
through the RMG Detachment to RMG/DPX
9.9.4.7.1. (Added) Reconstitution time is authorized IAW the member's assigned units lead
command's policy not to exceed 14 days. Reconstitution involves all the activities, both official
and unofficial, Airmen must complete before returning to work.         The remaining time is
characterized as limited duty time in the local area, during which Airmen must be available to
report for duty if necessary.
9.9.4.8. (Added) Civilian Expeditionary Workforce. AFR assets can serve in an on-call
status when the requester provides the funding codes to place members on orders.
9.9.4.9. (Added) Discipline. Reserve members are subject to the Uniform Code of Military
Justice (UCMJ) as specified in Article 2. Jurisdiction over reservists includes anytime while on
active duty, or in the case of a person involuntarily called to duty from the date when they are
called to duty. For offenses committed or discovered while deployed a reserve member is
subject to discipline from their deployed commander or their AFRC commander. See also, AFI
51-201, Administration of Military Justice, para 2.9.
9.9.4.9.1. (Added) Notwithstanding any other provision of this instruction, a reserve member
may be involuntarily extended on active duty or recalled to active duty for offenses occurring
while the member is on active duty or active duty for training. See RCM 202 and AFI 51-201,
Administration of Military Justice, para 2.8.
9.9.4.9.2. (Added) When reserve members are TDY or deployed it is required for a
commander considering offering Nonjudicial Punishment under Article 15, UCMJ, to consult
with the member's parent organization commander AFI 51-202, Nonjudicial Punishment, para
3.7. While not required by instruction, this consultation is highly encouraged in more serious
cases where court-martial is being considered. In addition to the purposes stated in AFI 51-202,
such consultation may permit an avoidance of holding witnesses in theater, or facilitate the
