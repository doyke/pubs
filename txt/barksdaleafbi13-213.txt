       3.4.2.1. All vehicles operating in the CMA must use rotating beacon lights or hazard
       flashers at all times.
       3.4.2.2. QAVOs and pedestrians operating on the CMA are required to maintain two-
       way radio communication with ATCT, via Tower Net, at all times. EXCEPTION: Fire
       Department shall use the Fire Net on designated frequency and shall notify ATCT to
       monitor the Fire Net. All ATCT instructions must be read back verbatim. Vehicles
       operating in the CMA on a daily basis should have a permanent radio mounted in the
       vehicle to communicate with ATCT. Handheld radios should be used only as a backup or
       when communicating with ATCT from outside the vehicle. Perform an operational radio
       check with ATCT prior to entering the airfield.
       3.4.2.3. Distinct vehicle call signs must be utilized. Refer to Attachment 15 for a list of
       unit call signs. Coordinate with the WADPM for approval to use call signs not listed.
       Call signs cannot include wording used from ATCT phraseology (e.g. “Taxi“, “Clear”,
       etc.). Call signs must remain professional and in good taste (e.g. no profanity, slander,
       etc.).
       3.4.2.4. Stationary vehicles in the CMA shall be positioned facing ATCT to the
       maximum extent possible. Notify ATCT when vehicle positioning towards ATCT is not
       possible.

      3.4.2.5. QAVOs working on foot are required to maintain handheld radio contact with
      ATCT and vehicle keys left in the ignition.
      3.4.2.6. When given CMA exit instructions, acknowledge and exit at the nearest access
      point. If given “Expedite” instructions, acknowledge and exit at the nearest access point
      as fast and safe as possible. All QAVOs shall notify ATCT after exiting the CMA.
   3.4.3. Airfield Closures. The WADPM notifies UADPMs through the monthly ADP
   bulletin of upcoming airfield closures. UADPMs shall notify their unit’s QAVOs of the
   upcoming airfield closure. During airfield closures, QAVOs may cross the runway only by
   using the following procedures:
      3.4.3.1. Ensure the runway is not active by attempting to call ATCT three times. If no
      response, contact AM via Tower Net radio or phone.
      3.4.3.2. After exhausting all listed means during the published closure periods, look both
      ways and proceed with caution.
   3.4.4. Runway Access/Crossing Procedures. Vehicles requesting permission onto/across the
   runway shall be restricted to mission-essential operations only. All other vehicles shall
   utilize the Perimeter Road and Flightline Road. If instructed to “hold short” of the runway
   by ATCT, QAVOs shall hold short of the runway at the CMA access points identified in
   paragraph 3.4.1 When instructed to proceed onto/across the runway, read back instructions
   verbatim, and report to ATCT when off the runway (past the VFR Hold Line or the INST
   Hold Line, as appropriate).
      3.4.4.1. QAVOs performing escort duty shall contact ATCT and obtain approval for all
      vehicles in the convoy. Escort vehicle will contact ATCT with their vehicle call sign
      followed by “plus #” to represent the number of vehicles being escorted. When all
      vehicles have exited the CMA, report to ATCT with call sign and “plus #”.

   3.4.5. Emergency Removal of Vehicles and Pedestrians from the CMA. In the event ATCT
   loses radio communication with vehicles in the CMA, the ATCT will flash the runway edge
   lights on and off at the highest setting to alert QAVOs/pedestrians that there is a problem
   and/or emergency requiring their immediate exit out of the CMA. All vehicles/pedestrians
   exiting the CMA shall notify the ATCT when out of the CMA. All exited QAVOs shall
   attempt to re-establish radio communication with ATCT. If unable, contact AM via radio or
   phone and advise that you are off the runway and experiencing radio problems. ATCT must
   inform AM of the incident immediately.
3.5. Airfield Evacuation. When notified by competent authority, all QAVOs shall evacuate the
airfield immediately. If QAVOs or personnel are aware of any situation requiring the evacuation
of the airfield, notify AM.
3.6. Instrument Hold Line/Sign (INST). All vehicles must hold short at the INST hold lines
until permission to enter the respective critical area is obtained from the ATCT, regardless of
weather conditions. To obtain permission to enter the critical area, use phraseology examples
from tables 4.5 and 4.6. An INST hold line protects the ILS Critical Area (combination
Localizer and Glide Slope Critical Areas) on Taxiway Echo One. Stop signs and ILS Critical
Area signage (see Figure 3.3) mark the North and South areas when approached from Perimeter
Road. When approaching the signage on Perimeter Road, QAVOs are required to “hold short”
of the signage and request access from ATCT. Additionally, there are INST hold lines on
Taxiways Alpha and Delta positioned to protect the Precision Obstacle Free Zones (POFZ).
QAVOs requiring access to these areas must have two-way radio communications with ATCT
and must request access prior to entering the protected area. QAVOs must report to ATCT when
out of the area.

Figure 3.3. Stop sign with ILS Critical Area verbiage sign.




3.7. Restricted Areas. QAVOs shall be familiar with restricted areas listed on the airfield
diagram. QAVOs shall never cross restricted area “red lines” without prior coordination with 2
SFS. QAVOs will utilize ECPs into a restricted area and have their Barksdale AF IMT 1199
displayed while driving in the restricted areas. Contact your Unit Security Manager for specific
details. Security Forces may establish Free Zones for contractors without a Barksdale AF IMT
1199. Contractors may need security escort to the Free Zone if a driving corridor has not been
established. Contractors without a Barksdale AF IMT 1199 will not be allowed access anywhere
outside of the established Free Zone.
3.8. ATCT Light Gun Signals. In the event of radio failure on the airfield, ATCT will utilize
light gun signals to instruct QAVO movement. All airfield vehicles shall have an AFVA 11-240
 26                                         BARKSDALEAFBI13-213 26 NOVEMBER 2013


decal affixed in view of the QAVO or clipped to the inside of the QAVO’s sun visor. All
QAVOs must be familiar and comply with ATCT light signals:
   3.8.1. Steady Green - Permission to cross, proceed or go.
   3.8.2. Steady Red - STOP. Vehicle must not move.
   3.8.3. Flashing Red - Exit the taxiway or runway (minimum of 100 feet).
   3.8.4. Flashing White - Return to starting point.
   3.8.5. Alternating Red/Green - Exercise extreme caution.
   3.8.6. Flashing Green signals are not utilized.

   3.8.7. The airport’s rotating beacon is located on the water tower near Davis Avenue. Do
   not confuse the rotating beacon (green and double white lights) with ATCT light signals.
3.9. Vehicle Traffic Flow/Patterns. This plan is designed to safely support normal day-to-day
airfield operations.
   3.9.1. Sites Road. QAVOs shall utilize the left lane to keep the operator side of vehicle
   towards the aircraft, except as depicted on an exercise flow plan. Sites Road begins at Site 1,
   near Taxiway Alpha, crosses the MAPA near Site 21 and continues to the A-10 parking area
   (See Figure 3.5). Use the stop markings and visually check the taxi lane for aircraft
   movement prior to crossing the MAPA. Avoid prolonged vehicle stoppage in the driving
   lane.
BARKSDALEAFBI13-213 26 NOVEMBER 2013                                                         27


Figure 3.5. Sites Road Traffic Flow Plan.




   3.9.2. Flightline Road. QAVOs shall utilize the right lane. (See Figure 3.5). White “STOP”
   pavement markings are established on either side of the Fire Department. All QAVOs will
   stop and visually check for emergency response vehicle movement prior to proceeding.
   Passing another vehicle in the same direction of travel is permitted if passing can be
   accomplished safely and without exceeding the speed limit. Vehicles transporting passengers
   shall exit Flightline Road when off/on loading passengers.

   3.10.10. Speed limit for CMA authorized vehicles on the Runway - 40 MPH.
   3.10.11. Designated Emergency Responders may exceed speed limits by 10 MPH only if
   adherence to speed limits would prevent a timely response during emergency situations.
   3.10.12. QAVOs utilizing Perimeter Road and Access Roads are authorized to travel up to
   20 MPH. Reduce your speed if the terrain becomes unstable/degraded.
   3.10.13. Transient Alert/Follow Me personnel may operate in excess of speed limits only to
   accommodate the optimum safe taxiing speed of an aircraft and when safety is not
   compromised.
3.11. Airfield Signs, Markings and Lighting. QAVOs must be able to distinguish between
different airfield signs, markings and lighting identified IAW UFC 3-535-01, Visual Air
Navigation Facilities. See Attachment 16 for commonly used signs, markings and lighting at
Barksdale.
3.12. Access to Aircraft Parking Sites. QAVOs entering the airfield at an ECP shall proceed
directly across the MAPA to the designated site. Stop and yield to taxiing aircraft prior to
BARKSDALEAFBI13-213 26 NOVEMBER 2013                                                           29


proceeding across any taxiway/taxi lane. Non mission required entry to the sites is not
permitted. QAVOs shall watch for aircraft entering or leaving sites.
3.13. Vehicle Operations on Designated Taxiways. The taxiway system is designed to
provide an orderly flow of aircraft and vehicle traffic eliminating the potential for a mishap.
   3.13.1. QAVOs shall maintain straight line driving and complete all turns at 90-degree
   angles. Vehicles are prohibited from indiscriminate direction of travel, cutting corners,
   driving on taxiway/runway/ramp shoulders, or moving diagonally across the MAPA.
   3.13.2. QAVOs shall signal all turns during day and night operations.
   3.13.3. If a taxiway is unusable or blocked (e.g., an aircraft has been pulled forward from the
   normal parking spot to accomplish an engine run), vehicles shall exercise extreme caution
   and proceed around the area in a direct and expeditious manner. Do not drive through a
   hazardous area or between aircraft and hazard cones.
3.14. Vehicles Delivering or Retrieving Munitions. Trailers may be towed, pushed or pulled
under bomber aircraft in performance of their duties. These procedures shall be incorporated
into the unit’s Airfield Vehicle Operations Training Course. The following procedures shall be
strictly adhered to:
   3.14.1. Do not back or drive vehicles forward directly toward any aircraft, except as
   authorized in certain loading, unloading, or fueling operations. In these instances, QAVOs
   will adhere to the following procedures:
       3.14.1.1. The QAVO shall position two spotters between the vehicle and the aircraft.
       Spotters are required to be QAVOs. One spotter shall be on the left side of the vehicle
       and the other spotter on the right side. Spotters are required to monitor clearance at all
       times. The QAVO shall ensure spotters position a wheel chock between the vehicle and
       the aircraft, in line with the vehicle path.
       3.14.1.2. Once the vehicle reaches the wheel chock and has stopped, spotters shall check
       the vehicle alignment to ensure adequate clearance is maintained between the
       vehicle/trailer and the aircraft. If adequate clearance can be maintained, spotters shall
       remove the wheel chock and place it where the vehicle/trailer shall be positioned or
       retrieved. The QAVO shall continue under the aircraft and position the vehicle/trailer
       while spotters monitor the clearance. After positioning or retrieving the trailer, spotters
       shall monitor the clearance as the vehicle/trailer pulls out from under the aircraft.
   3.14.2. Weapons escorts have the right of way over all vehicular traffic except emergency
   response vehicles responding to an emergency. QAVOs shall give way to weapons escorts
   and come to a complete stop. Weapons escorts arriving at their destination shall exit the road
   so as not to impede other traffic on the roadway.
3.15. Vehicle Parking. Vehicles can only be left unattended for mission-essential duties and
should only occur when no other options exist. Vehicles parking on east side of Flightline Road
shall have an airfield authorized driver remain in the vehicle operator’s seat at all times.
Transient Alert personnel are exempt from these restrictions while performing duties. If an
aircraft approaches the area, the QAVO shall move the vehicle immediately so as not to interfere
with aircraft operations.

   3.16.1. Vehicles shall not be driven directly towards an aircraft when within 25 feet, and
   shall never be driven underneath any part of an aircraft, except during approved servicing
   and/or loading procedures (i.e. towing operations). All vehicles operating within 25 feet of
   an aircraft shall have a spotter. For weapons deliveries, see paragraph 3.13 No vehicle shall
   operate between or behind aircraft parked on Sites row, unless in direct support of towing
   operations or approved for such movement by the appropriate squadron operations officer or
   superintendent.
   3.16.2. Vehicles servicing or loading an aircraft may be left unattended. All vehicles left
   unattended shall be left unlocked, keys in the ignition and engine off. Unattended vehicles
   shall not block taxiways or other aircraft parking locations.
   3.16.3. The vehicle path should be planned so that if brake failure occurs, the vehicle shall
   not strike the aircraft. Vehicles parked in front or behind an aircraft shall be parked
   perpendicular to the aircraft. Vehicles parked beside an aircraft must be parked parallel to
   the aircraft. Park so that the vehicle’s front or rear shall not face any part of the aircraft.
   3.16.4. Vehicles shall not park or drive within 35 feet in front of or 300 feet behind any
   aircraft whose engines are in operation or being started. (Note: This area is known as the
   circle of safety). QAVOs shall not, under any circumstances, stand or park in front of or
   drive into the path of taxiing aircraft or drive between an aircraft and its Transient Alert
   guide vehicle.
BARKSDALEAFBI13-213 26 NOVEMBER 2013                                                           31


3.16.5. When any aircraft larger than a C-130 approaches, all vehicles shall exit the area
immediately and come to a complete stop until the aircraft has passed. For all other aircraft,
the QAVO shall stop on the road until the aircraft has passed. In addition, vehicles operating on
Sites Road shall stop as taxiing aircraft approach.
   3.16.6. Departing the paved surface to ensure clearance from aircraft should only be used as
   a last resort. In the event the QAVO does depart the paved surface, the QAVO shall perform
   a FOD check upon returning to the paved surface.
   3.16.7. Helicopters are considered taxiing when hovering 100 feet or less above the ground
   or when traversing down a taxiway. QAVOs are not allowed to drive under, between or
   around helicopters hovering 100 feet or less.
3.17. Towing Operations.
   3.17.1. Prior to towing, Maintenance Operations Control Center (MOCC) shall notify ATCT
   and provide current aircraft parking location and proposed tow location. MOCC shall relay
   any ATCT instructions to personnel towing aircraft.
       3.17.1.1. QAVOs shall not approach within 50 feet of an aircraft being towed. Any
       QAVO who encounters taxi or tow operations shall yield to the aircraft by moving right
       or left and hold in position until the aircraft has passed or has stopped and the QAVO can
       determine whether to continue.
       3.17.1.2. QAVOs may cross the apron boundary markings (i.e. double-yellow lines)
       when towing aircraft to hangers.
   3.17.2. Equipment/Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE) Towing. AGE-towing vehicles
   shall be placed in park, parking brake set or tire chocked and ignition turned off while the
   QAVO completes hook-up operations. All wheeled AGE and maintenance equipment shall
   have the breaks on or chocked if not equipped with brakes.
3.18. Emergency Vehicle Operations. During emergencies, emergency response vehicles may
deviate from established routes, based on the nature of the situation and existing conditions. In
all cases, QAVOs are responsible for minimizing risk by exercising extreme caution.
   3.18.1. Emergency Response vehicles must obtain ATCT approval prior to entering the
   CMA.
   3.18.2. Secondary response agencies (outlined in paragraph 1.15) shall maintain positions at
   the entrance to each Taxiway, until called forward by the Fire Chief or incident/on-scene
   commander. If CMA access is required, secondary response agencies will obtain approval
   for entry from ATCT prior to proceeding into the emergency area.
   3.18.3. Ground vehicles not supporting the emergency shall remain off of taxiways, the
   runway, and airfield access points until the emergency is terminated. Under no circumstance
   shall a vehicle proceed in front of an Emergency Response vehicle.
   3.18.4. Non-emergencies include, but are not limited to, maintenance red-ball responses,
   exercises, etc. At no time is speeding permitted for any non-emergency.
3.19. Restricted Visibility and Night Operations. During periods of reduced visibility and
night operations, vehicle headlights shall not be pointed towards taxiing aircraft. In order to
preserve a pilot’s night vision and to enable the aircrew to observe your position, QAVOs shall
 32                                        BARKSDALEAFBI13-213 26 NOVEMBER 2013


turn headlights “off” and parking lights “on” until the approaching aircraft has passed. Ensure
your vehicle is clear of an aircraft’s taxi route.
   3.19.1. When visibility is less than 300 feet, refueling and explosive loaded (laden) vehicles
   shall not be operated, unless directed by the 2 BW Commander. When visibility is less than
   100 feet, POVs and airfield vehicles, with exception to emergency and alert vehicles, shall
   not be operated on the airfield. When the visibility is less than 50 feet, a walking guide,
   equipped with flashing or luminescent wand, must be used during movement of emergency
   and alert vehicles.
   3.19.2. Flashing hazard lights or rotating beacons shall be used on all vehicles parked on the
   airfield at night or during periods of poor visibility.
3.20. Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE)/Mobile Obstacles on the Airfield.
   3.20.1. Support equipment may be staged on the MAPA, within the non-standard white AGE
   boxes, three hours prior to engine start and three hours after the aircraft has returned to
   parking. Support equipment may be staged on the appropriate AAPA stub three hours prior
   to engine start and three hours after aircraft has returned to parking. Outside of the
   prescribed operations window, all support equipment must be removed from the parking
   area. The use of support equipment on taxiways (i.e. arm/de-arming, etc.) may only be
   utilized for the duration of mission support and must be promptly removed upon completion
   of duties. Equipment not being utilized must remain 200 feet from taxiway centerlines.
   Support equipment must remain outside of 1000 feet from the runway. 2 BW support
   equipment shall be stored at Sites 5 and Sites 21. 307 BW equipment shall be stored at the
   storage pad North of Taxiway Charlie. AM shall close all locations where a clearance
   criterion from fixed or mobile obstructions is not met.
   3.20.2. Vehicles shall not be parked temporarily or allowed to stand in empty aircraft
   parking spots. This requirement does not apply to equipment in established equipment
   parking areas or pre-positioned for aircraft recovery, which must be parked, clear of
   roadways and taxi/tow lines. During periods when maintenance equipment, work stands and
   aircraft materials are not actually required for work in progress or planned, they shall be
   removed from the aircraft parking area to designated storage locations. Vehicles and
   equipment must be clearly visible from the aircraft cockpit.
   3.20.3. Non-standard white lines have been placed on the parking ramp to identify wingtip
   clearance for taxiing/towed aircraft. Wingtip clearance criterion is established IAW Unified
   Facilities Criteria 3-260-01, Table 6-1 Item 5. The white line provides 30 feet of wingtip
   clearance for a B-52 (185 foot wingspan), established on the east/west interior taxilanes. On
   B-52 parking rows, the distance from the interior taxilane centerline to the white markings is
   122.5 feet. This distance provides safe, adequate wingtip clearance for B-52 aircraft when
   parked or taxiing through on the interior taxilanes. Once the B-52 is established on the taxi
   line, the wingtip clearance shall be maintained between the B-52 wingtip and white line until
   the B-52 starts the turn into/out of the parking spot. NO FIXED OR MOBILE OBJECTS
   SHALL BE POSITIONED WITHIN THIS ROUTE, as designated in Figure 3.8 (Note: The
   vertical blue lines in Figure 3.9 depict the non-standard white lines painted on the parking
   ramp. The diagonal black lines are depicting the area that no mobile object shall be
   positioned. There are no diagonal lines painted on the parking ramp. The diagonal lines are
   pictured below only for the purpose of describing the area within this regulation.).

3.21. Disabled Vehicles. All possible efforts shall be made to remove disabled vehicles from
aircraft parking and movement areas. Such vehicles pose safety hazards and must display
emergency flashers at all times. The QAVO shall avoid blocking the runway, taxiway or
roadways. At a minimum, the QAVO shall:
   3.21.1. Leave emergency flashers on and remain within the vicinity while seeking help.
   3.21.2. If the vehicle has two-way radio capabilities, make the following transmission: “All
   parties BREAK, BREAK-This is (call sign) with an emergency for Airfield Management,
   Tower and Maintenance Operations Control Center.” State the nature of the problem and
   report your position on the airfield.
   3.21.3. QAVOs of other radio-equipped vehicles shall make every effort to assist in
   removing the disabled vehicle off the airfield, especially if the vehicle is located on MAPA,
   AAPA, taxiways or runway.
   3.21.4. If a vehicle is not equipped with a two-way radio, stay with the vehicle and continue
   attempts to alert any taxiing aircraft or other vehicle in the vicinity.
   3.21.5. In the event of a disabled vehicle on the CMA, the QAVO shall immediately notify
   ATCT and AM, by any means possible, to coordinate removal of the vehicle from the CMA.
       3.21.5.1. The QAVO shall ensure the disabled vehicle is not left unattended in the CMA.
       3.21.5.2. The disabled vehicle shall be removed using any method in the quickest and
       safest fashion possible.
3.22. ATCT/Vehicle Blind Spots. A vehicle cannot be seen by ATCT in the following
locations:
   3.22.1. Behind the Warrior Center.
   3.22.2. Under the A-10 Parking Shades.

3.23. Procedures for Vehicle Supplemental Traction Control Devices. Tire chains may only
be employed on airfield pavements after obtaining coordination and approval from the AFM,
Safety, and CE. To minimize pavement damage and FOD hazard, requesting agency shall
conduct an operational risk assessment with the above agencies when evaluating the need for tire
chains on the airfield.
3.24. Foreign Object Debris (FOD) Control and Prevention. All airfield personnel have a
responsibility in the FOD Control Program to remove FOD from the airfield when found. AM is
the focal point for notifying the airfield sweeper for all sweeping requests on the airfield. Notify
AM of significant FOD on any paved operational areas.
   3.24.1. Prior to entering the airfield, all vehicles must perform a rollover FOD check. Stop
   the vehicle at the designated FOD checkpoint or immediately after leaving an unpaved area

         RADIO COMMUNICATIONS PHRASEOLOGY AND TECHNIQUES

4.1. General.
   4.1.1. Radio communication is a critical link in the ATC system. The single-most important
   factor in communications with ATCT understands the procedures. It is essential to
   acknowledge each radio communication with controllers verbatim, using the appropriate call
   sign.
   4.1.2. Brevity and clarity are also important factors. Radio transmissions must be kept as
   brief and comprehensible as possible. Controllers must know what you want to do before
   they can properly carry out their control duties. Conversely, QAVOs must know exactly what
   the controller wants them to do. Maintain vigilance in monitoring ATCT radio
   communication frequencies for situational awareness, especially when operating in the CMA.
4.2. Radio Techniques.
   4.2.1. Listen before transmitting. If other QAVOs are talking, the keying of another radio
   will override the current transmission. Pause and listen. Proceed to transmit your request
   when assured no other transmissions are taking place.
   4.2.2. Think before keying the radio. Know exactly what you need to say before you say it.
   4.2.3. When keying the radio, keeping it close to your mouth, press and hold the
   transmission button and allow a slight delay before speaking your first word. This shall
   ensure your full transmission is broadcasted clearly. Speak in a normal, conversational tone.
   4.2.4. Release the transmission button a few seconds after your last word. If the
   transmission was not acknowledged, pause momentarily and repeat again. ATCT may be
   locating your position on the airfield, transmitting on a different frequency, or scanning the
   runway to enable the request.
   4.2.5. Be alert to the tones or lack of tones through the radio. Check volume, recheck
   frequency, and check to make sure the transmission key is not stuck in the transmit position.
   Frequency blockage can occur for extended periods due to unintentional radio operation.
   This type of interference is commonly referred to as a “stuck mike” and controllers may refer
   to it in this manner when attempting to correct the problem.
   4.2.6. Be sure that you are within the performance range of your radio equipment and the
   ground station equipment.
   4.2.7. Use caution when using a vehicle mounted/handheld radio and operating a vehicle at
   the same time. When possible, only use the radio when safely parked.
4.3. Phraseology. QAVOs must contact ATCT each and every time they enter on or exit off of
the CMA. When proceeding into a CMA, QAVOs must advise ATCT of three things: WHO you
are, WHERE you are, and WHAT your intentions are. QAVOs must acknowledge all
communications to ensure the message was received. QAVOs shall always give aircraft and
ATCT transmissions priority, unless an emergency exists. VHF/UHF transmissions are reserved
for the primary use of aircraft and ATCT personnel. Never use the words “Clear, Cleared, or
 38                                        BARKSDALEAFBI13-213 26 NOVEMBER 2013


Clearance” in radio communications with the tower. These words are reserved for
communications between the tower and aircraft. Utilize Tables 4.1 – 4.9 for common runway
cross and access phraseology.

                  “OPS 1, TOWER, HOLD SHORT OF RUNWAY 15/33 AT
                  TAXIWAY ALPHA.”
   4.3.1. Vehicles must read back instructions verbatim before taking any action and allow time
   for correction, if misinterpreted. If you are unsure what the controller has transmitted, or if
   you do not understand an instruction, you MUST request ATCT to repeat the last
   transmission. Good communications only occur when each party knows and understands
   what the other is saying.

                                            Chapter 5

      AIRFIELD DRIVING ENFORCEMENT, REPORTING VIOLATIONS AND
                           CONSEQUENCES

5.1. General. Several different types of airfield violations exist on Barksdale that QAVOs must
be aware of. Two major types include CMAVs and Runway Incursions. In addition, QAVOs
may also be cited for minor infractions, such as failing to perform a FOD check, invalid AF IMT
483, etc.
5.2. CMAVs and Runway Incursions.
   5.2.1. CMAVs constitute an unauthorized crossing of the VFR Hold Line, but not infringing
   upon the runway (e.g. airfield mowers too close to the runway, etc.). Unauthorized crossing
   of the activated INST Hold Line on Taxiway Alpha, Delta, and Echo 1 also constitutes a
   CMAV.
   5.2.2. Runway Incursions constitute unauthorized entry onto the runway and overruns.
   Runway Incursions are the most severe type of airfield violation.
   5.2.3. The QAVO’s Unit Commander, UADPM, and AM must be notified immediately of
   any CMAV/Runway Incursion and that the incident is under investigation. AM shall notify
   HQ AFGSC/A3BA within 24 hours of a Runway Incursion/HATR incident.
   5.2.4. The individual’s AF IMT 483 must be surrendered to AM and airfield driving
   privileges temporarily suspended until an investigation and retraining is completed. Note:
   Unit Commanders, UADPMs, AM, and SF have the authority to temporarily suspend airfield
   driving privileges. When suspended by agencies other than AM, prompt notification must be
   provided to the WADPM.

c.       VFR Hold Line Marking. This marking is defined by its double dashed and double
solid design and is typically located 100 feet to 250 feet from the near edge of the runway.




d.       Instrument/ILS Hold Line Marking. This marking is defined by a distinct “ladder”
design, with the letters “INST” positioned on the side closest to the runway. This marking is
positioned to prevent QAVOs from entering the Glide Slope Critical Area and interfering with an
activated instrument landing system.




e.       Restricted Marking. This marking is red in color and is designed to protect a restricted
area of the airfield. Personnel must have an authorized restricted area badges (AF IMT 1199) in
their position prior to entering a restricted area through a defined entry control point.




f.        Entry Control Point Markings. This marking defines an entry control point into a
restricted area on an airfield. Personnel must have an authorized restricted area badges (AF IMT
1199) in their position prior to entering a restricted area.




g.       Driving Lane Markings. Driving lanes are marked with retro-reflective white paint and
are designed to appear as a typical roadway.




3. Lighting.
a.       Taxiway edge lights. These lights define the lateral limits and direction of a taxiing
route (Taxiway).

b.      Runway edge lights. These lights define the lateral and longitudinal limits of the
runway surface. These lights provide visual guidance during takeoff and landing operations at
night and under low visibility conditions.




c.        Runway edge light with split yellow/amber. These lights are identical to runway edge
lights, except that the light is half white and half yellow/amber. This light is designed as a
visual, cautionary tool to inform aircrews that only 2000 feet of the instrument runway remains.
The yellow/amber portion of the light will be facing the approach end of the runway, with the
white light facing the departure end of the runway.




d.       Obstruction lights. These red lights are used to define the vertical and horizontal limits
of natural or manmade objects which are considered a hazard to air navigation. White lights may
also be used on structures less than 200 feet tall with MAJCOM approval; however, these lights
shall not be located in clear zones or near the immediate vicinity of the runway(s).




e.      Construction lights. These lights are placed on construction barricades to provide visual
aid of the construction area. These lights will be yellow/amber or red in color and will flash at a
rate of 55 to 160 flashes per minute.

f.        Rotating beacon. This lighting system rotates 360 degrees and consists of a single-
peaked green light and a double-peaked white light. The purpose of this lighting system is to
help pilots identify the airfield. For example, a double-peaked white light represents a military
airfield, where a single-peaked white light represents a civil airfield.




g.       Approach lights. This complex, multi-colored lighting system provides visual guidance
during landing operations at night and under low visibility conditions.




h.     Ballpark light. These white lights are used to illuminate large areas, such as a parking
apron.
