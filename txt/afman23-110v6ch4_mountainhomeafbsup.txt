added safeguarding procedures for precious metals. Paragraph 4.11., added website for current

to authorized individuals."

4.2.3.1. (Added)Upon appointment of a new (primary or alternate) organizational PMRP
monitor, provide the installation PMRP manager a copy of the new appointment letter
(Attachment 2 (Added), Sample Appointment of Precious Metals Recovery Program Monitor).

4.2.3.2. (Added)Appointments will be for a minimum of 2 years, when possible.

4.2.3.3. (Added)Organizations must also appoint PMRP monitors for deployed locations. New
PMRP appointments must be made at least 90 days prior to a Permanent Change of Station
move, leave or Temporary Duty exceeding 30 days (when possible).

4.2.8.Organizations using, generating or producing precious metals will utilize, as a minimum,
the organization PMRP monitor checklist (Attachment 3 (Added), Precious Metals Recovery
Program Monitor) to conduct their semiannual self-inspections. Items listed do not constitute
the order or limit the scope of inspections. Organizations should add items which require
examination. Results of the inspections are documented in letter format to include date of
inspection, checklist used and individual conducting the inspection. Report will also indicate
whether discrepancies noted are opened or closed. An estimated completion date will be
assigned to all open items. PMRP monitors will provide action taken on any discrepancies noted
during their self/bi-annual inspections to the PMRP manager. The PMRP manager will review
copies of the self-inspection reports filed in the organization’s PMRP monitor's continuity folder
during their bi-annual inspection. The organization’s PMRP manager comments on results of the
inspection and adequacy of the program in their bi-annual report. PMRP manager will use the
manager checklist (Attachment 4 (Added), Precious Metals Recovery Program Manager) to
conduct self-inspections.

4.2.9.The commander has elected to maintain frequency of visits to once every 2 years. PMRP
manager must conduct these visits within 60 days (plus or minus) of the date of the previous bi-
annual surveillance.

4.2.10.Challenges are directed to the PMRP manager for coordination with appropriate
integrated material managers. Precious metals code challenges are in letter format (Attachment

4.7.2.Organizations participating in the PMRP will have a central collection point. Precious
metals bearing scrap, sludge, flakes, amalgam, black and white photographs/negatives and
excess fine precious metals are turned into DRMS when a sufficient amount is accumulated (at
least every 30 days for large quantity generating organizations, and 180 days for small quantity
generating organizations). If a sufficient amount has not been accumulated, annotate in the
DRMS log that the current amount does not warrant a DRMS TIN. Place a container marked
"Precious Metals" near the generating activity, and secure it with a lock to prevent theft (if
feasible). Only the primary or alternate organizational monitors and shop chiefs should have
access to the precious metals container.

4.7.2.1. (Added)In general, precious metals accumulated for recovery are exempt from federal
and state hazardous waste management requirements. However, certain precious metals DRMS
processes for disposal, rather than recovery, must be managed as hazardous wastes during the
accumulation period. Newly appointed organizational Precious Metals monitors must contact
the 366th Civil Engineer Squadron, Environmental Flight to coordinate hazardous waste
management requirements.

4.8.4.1. (Added)Establish organizational procedures for collecting hypo solution when
equipment is out of commission. Ensure sufficient equipment (drums/containers) are available

Form 1348-1A, Issue Release/Receipt Document, disposal turn-in document, and a ledger
reflecting silver flake harvesting, silver recovery cartridges and precious metal scrap, serial
number, quantity/type of precious metal, date or turn-in and remarks.
