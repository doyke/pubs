                                           Chapter 1

   GENERAL INFORMATION REGARDING SPECIAL TROPHIES AND AWARDS

1.1. Nominating Procedures. Commanders at all levels actively advertise the nomination
procedures for trophies and awards. Commanders verify achievements and nominate those
qualified for appropriate awards. MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU commanders, vice commanders, or
executive directors indorse nominations on their personnel. When nominating persons or units
assigned to other commands, commanders acquire by letter, the coordination of the commander
or vice commander of the owning MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU. Submit nominations to HQ
AFPC/DPPPRS, with the parent MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU commander's coordination.
1.2. Air Force-level Awards. Air Force functional activities or private organizations establish
Air Force-level awards. The designated OPR and HQ USAF/DPXPQ approve implementing
instructions. Notify HQ USAF/DPXPQ when the award is terminated.
   1.2.1. The experts in a given function will manage functional awards. Functional managers
   will ensure nomination write-ups are limited to two pages, using the Air Force Form 1206,
   Nomination for Award. Exceptions to this requirement must be approved by HQ
   USAF/DPX. Functional areas requiring the use of base visits to determine award winners
   will limit such visits to one visit per base per award.
1.3. Wartime Guidance. Programs governed by this instruction will continue during conflicts
below the level of declared war. In the event of a national emergency declared by Congress or
the President of the United States, programs sponsored by Headquarters (HQ) USAF may be
suspended. The Air Force will suspend administrative support for programs sponsored by
private organizations.
1.4. Establishing Special Trophies and Awards Programs. Commanders at any level may
establish special trophies and awards programs to recognize military and civilian members and
units or organizations. Include such recognition programs in appropriate base supplements.
   1.4.1. Awards may be named in honor of living or deceased Air Force military members and
   Department of the Air Force (DAF) civilians who had honorable records and made
   significant contributions to the Air Force or to the functional area in which the award is being
   established. Consider individuals of prominence or those whose careers or actions were
   important and meaningful to the function in which the award will be established.
   Thoroughly review the career and personal history of the individual to ensure the individual
   is worthy of such honor before naming an award in their honor. When establishing an award,
   the designated award OPR or manager will send a letter, signed by the appropriate
   commander or vice commander, to HQ AFPC/DPPPRS notifying of the establishment of the
   award. Include the award and criteria in an appropriate supplement or instruction. Process
   all supplements and instructions in accordance with AFI 37-160V1, The Air Force
   Publications and Forms Management Programs – Developing and Processing Publications.
   Commanders at all levels are responsible for ensuring and maintaining the integrity of special
   trophies and awards programs. All awards named for individuals will be established only in
   accordance with this instruction. The requirements of this instruction are mandatory when
   considering memorial-type awards.         List what sources were reviewed to perform the
6                                                   AFI36-2805_PACAFSUP_I 14 MAY 2010


    background check and that verification has been made that no derogatory information was
    found on the individual which would preclude naming an award in their honor.
    1.4.2. Possible sources    to   review   when     determining   individuals'   suitability for
    memorialization are:
       1.4.2.1. Military personnel records (retired or deceased military members), which are
       located at the National Personnel Records Center (NPRC), Air Force Reference Branch,
       9700 Page Boulevard, St. Louis MO 63132-5100.
       1.4.2.2. Civilian personnel records (retired or deceased DAF civilians), which are located
       at the National Archives and Records Administration, NPRC (Civilian Personnel
       Records), 111 Winnebago Street, St. Louis MO 63118.
       1.4.2.3. Public libraries for archived newspaper articles.
       1.4.2.4. Local newspapers.
       1.4.2.5. Local courthouse records.
       1.4.2.6. Local Air Force Office of Special Investigations or Security Police.
       1.4.2.7. Interview family, friends, acquaintances, and coworkers.
    1.4.3. Do not duplicate existing trophies and awards programs in either name or criteria.
    (Recognizing an achievement or accomplishment in performance reports or a citation to
    accompany an award is not considered duplication or dual recognition.) Award elements will
    not duplicate elements of existing formal award programs. Refer to AFI 65-601, volume 1,
    USAF Budget Guidance and Procedures, for further guidance regarding funding for award
    elements. Awards must be of nominal value. Awards may not be redeemable for cash,
    merchandise, or services. The cost of awards will be commensurate with the significance of
    the achievement being recognized.
    1.4.4. A one-time unique trophy or award may be given to an individual or unit whose
    achievements make a significant contribution to the effectiveness and efficiency of the Air
    Force.
    1.4.5. (Added-PACAF) Recognition and Appreciation Coin Program. This program is
    intended to provide commanders, directors, and command chief master sergeants with an
    official, yet informal, means to show special recognition of, and appreciation for, specific
    outstanding mission accomplishment.

           meritorious achievement. Note: The term “function” as used in this paragraph refers
           to a project, task, or purpose; it does not include unit functions like picnics or other

           1.4.5.2.3. (Added-PACAF) Cannot be personalized with the presenter‟s name.
           (EXCEPTION: Four (4) star general officers and four (4) star civilian equivalents

           commemorative, or personal gifts, for purely morale building, as these may be
           authorized IAW AFI 34-201, Use of Nonappropriated Funds (NAFs). Note: The
           limitations listed in this paragraph do not apply if coins are donated by a private

of the term; they need only be assigned to the same career field. The AFA honors the five
members and their spouses (if applicable) at a ceremony each May in Washington DC. The
period of the award is 1 January - 31 December. HQ AFPC/DPPPRS solicits nominations from
the appropriate Air Force functional manager for that career field and provides further guidance

3.4. 12 Outstanding Airmen of the Year (12 OAY) Award. Established by the Air Force, this
program recognizes 12 enlisted members in a range of grades representing a cross section of
career fields. The AFA honors the 12 OAY and their spouses at its annual convention in
Washington DC each year. HQ AFPC/DPPP sends a message outlining nomination procedures
to the MAJCOMs, FOAs, and DRUs each year. Send nominations to HQ AFPC/DPPPRS by 30
April.
   3.4.1. There are three categories of competition: Airman (airman through senior airman);
   NCO (sergeant and technical sergeant); and Senior NCO (master sergeant through chief
   master sergeant).
      3.4.1.1. (Added-PACAF) Nominate individuals based on the rank held for the majority
      of the year. For individuals promoted at the 6-month point, they will compete in the
      category for the previous rank. For instance, a SrA promoted to SSgt at the 6 month
      point will compete in the Airman category.
   3.4.2. Base nominations only on achievements that occurred during the current calendar
   year. For example, the nominees' achievements for the 1998 program should cite
   achievements occurring from 1 January 1997 through 31 December 1997. Since nominees
   are representatives of the Air Force enlisted force, they must also stand the test of a "whole
   life/whole career" scrutiny, although the observation period for the award is 1 year.
      3.4.2.1. (Added-PACAF) Do not nominate previous Air Force-level 12 Outstanding
      Airmen.
   3.4.3. All nominees must sign a statement of intent agreeing if selected as a MAJCOM,
   FOA, or DRU nominee, they will obtain the required retainability in order to compete at Air
   Force level. All nominees who meet the Air Force selection board must have sufficient
   retainability so that, if selected as a 12 OAY, they can serve on the AFA Enlisted Advisory
   Council for a 12-month period which commences the month of their induction (September)
   as a 12 OAY. For example, the 1998 12 OAY serve from September 1998 through
   September 1999. Therefore, the 1998 MAJCOM and DRU nominees would need
   retainability through 30 September 1999. The annual HQ AFPC/DPP nomination message
   outlines procedures to follow to obtain retainability for those MAJCOM and DRU nominees
   who do not have sufficient retainability. Contact AFPC Personnel Procurement Division,
   Reenlistment Branch (HQ AFPC/DPPAE), for assistance regarding retainability. Failure on
   the part of the MAJCOM or DRU to meet retainability requirements on their nominee will
   result in the nominee being withdrawn from the Air Force-level competition. If an individual
   is not selected as a 12 OAY, cancel the extension.
   3.4.4. Send statement of intent, signed and dated by the nominee, which includes the
   following statements verbatim:
      3.4.4.1. “I have not applied for a commissioning program and, if selected as a 12 OAY,
      will not apply for a commissioning program at any time during my tenure as a 12 OAY.”
