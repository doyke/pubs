                                GOALS AND RESPONSIBILITIES

1.1. Need for Career Retention Program. The increasing complexity of equipment, programs, and
responsibilities under the total force policy requires that the Air Force Reserve (AFRES) maintain a
dynamic career retention program. The quality of the AFRES program depends on the quality of its

accomplishment.

1.2. Program Goals. The overall and specific goals of the Career Retention Program support the
USAFR role in national defense.
   1.2.1. Overall Goal. The Career Retention Program aims to perform the highest order of USAFR
   mission by:

       •Motivating members to take an active part in the program.
   1.2.2. Specific Goals. The following specific goals show areas where commanders can direct reten-
   tion efforts.
       1.2.2.1. Provide a career environment that encourages members to take an active part in the pro-
       gram and to reenlist in the USAFR.
       1.2.2.2. Establish personnel policies and set up programs that show a real concern for people.
       When possible, eliminate career problems caused by existing policies.
       1.2.2.3. Promote service to our country as an honorable and rewarding profession.
       1.2.2.4. Create a challenge and sense of recognition in each person's job and career in the
       USAFR.
       1.2.2.5. Ensure that policies add to the status, responsibility, and dignity of personnel in the
       USAFR.
       1.2.2.6. Educate members and their families on the rewards and benefits of a USAFR career.
       1.2.2.7. Make sure supervisors know their responsibilities in advising subordinates of USAFR
       advantages, opportunities, and challenges.
       1.2.2.8. Provide enlisted members with career retention information and help them make positive
       career decisions.

1.3. Responsibilities:
   1.3.1. HQ USAF/REP. The Director of Personnel, Office of Air Force Reserve (HQ USAF/REP), is
   the central authority for career motivation and retention. Work with HQ AFRES/DPR and the Air

6                                                                            AFI36-2612 25 July 1994

       1.3.1.1. Develop policies, procedures, and materials to support the Career Retention Program;

1.4. Wing or Group Retention Plan 22. Plan 22 is a comprehensive outline of operating procedures.
Use the following guidelines to create the plan:
    1.4.1. Selective Retention Process (SRP) (RESRE0):
       1.4.1.1. The retention program manager establishes the procedure for distributing the SRP
       (RESRE0 RIP) to UCAs (not earlier than 12 months before current ETS) by means of APDS/
       PCIII (unit program only).
       1.4.1.2. The UCA ensures proper coordination of the SRP.
       1.4.1.3. The supervisor selects or nonselects members for reenlistment with initials, X, or check
       mark. Member then signs and dates the form.
       1.4.1.4. The unit commander selects or nonselects members for reenlistment with initials, X, or
       check mark. The member then signs and dates the form.
       1.4.1.5. The commander or supervisor completes AF Form 418, Selective Reenlistment Pro-
       gram Consideration, when not selecting a member for reenlistment and sends it with the SRP to
       the retention program manager.
       1.4.1.6. The member selects "will," "will not," or "undecided" with initials, X, or check mark.
       The member then signs and dates the SRP.
       1.4.1.7. The unit commander counsels members who are undecided about or who decline reenlist-
       ment. The commander then writes comments in the space provided on the SRP.
AFI36-2612 25 July 1994                                                                             9

      1.4.1.8. The UCA also counsels members who are undecided or decline to reenlist. The UCA
      completes AF Form 158 and sends the original to the retention program manager along with the
      SRP.
      1.4.1.9. The UCA returns the SRP to the retention program manager 7 months before the mem-
      ber’s current ETS. The UCA keeps a unit file copy in accordance with AFMAN 37-139.
      1.4.1.10. The retention program manager updates the USAFR unit-level data identification num-
      ber (DIN) reenlistment eligibility status (RBA) code and files the SRP upon receiving it. The
      retention program manager keeps the original SRP in accordance with AFMAN 37-139.
      1.4.1.11. When members are undecided or decline to reenlist, the retention program manager
      counsels members 6 months before expiration of term of service (ETS) to see whether the cause of
      their decision has changed. If the cause hasn’t changed, the retention program manager:
          •Counsels members on other options (such as the category B individual mobilization augu-
              mentee (IMA) program and participating individual ready reserve (IRR)).
          •Updates DIN RBA to the appropriate code.
          •Notifies the personnel relocation section of members that remain undecided (RBA-5B) or
              decline (RBA-5L).
   1.4.2. Reserve Initial Orientation (RESINT) (Unit Program):
      1.4.2.1. The retention program manager establishes the procedure for distributing and completing
      the RESINT RIP by means of APDS/PCIII.
      1.4.2.2. The gaining commander personally welcomes newly assigned USAFR enlisted members
      and invites their spouses to attend the initial orientation.
      1.4.2.3. The unit commander briefs the member on:
         •Participation requirements (excusal procedures, reasons, and required documentation)
         •Training requirements and schedule
         •Member's responsibility for current records at the MPF
         •Medical requirements (physicals, immunizations, weight control, and physical fitness)
         •Civilian and USAFR jobs
         •Self-improvement opportunities
         •Promotional opportunities
         •Commissioning programs
         •Wing, group, and unit missions
         •Unit alert roster
         •Unique local items
      1.4.2.4. The member signs and dates the RIP or AF Form 158, acknowledging orientation.
      1.4.2.5. The unit commander validates orientation on the RIP or AF Form 158 with their signa-
      ture and date.
      1.4.2.6. The UCA files the original RIP or AF Form 158 in accordance with AFMAN 37-139. No
      reply to the retention program manager is necessary.

     1.4.3. Individualized Newcomer Treatment and Orientation (INTRO) Program:
        1.4.3.1. The AFRES INTRO Program is a method for smoothly integrating new members into the
        USAFR. The MPF customer service section controls the program.
        1.4.3.2. All USAFR units must establish a viable unit INTRO program and demonstrate to new
        members that they are welcome additions to the USAFR and the unit. AFI 36-2103, along with
        these guidelines, explains how to set up and operate an effective INTRO program.
        1.4.3.3. The sponsor program is oriented to the unit and unit work center. Unit commanders must
        appoint unit sponsors from the newcomer’s workcenter and make sure that sponsors meet their
        responsibilities. The unit commanders’ involvement in the program is vital to its success. They
        must:
            •Appoint sponsors during the members' first unit training assembly (UTA).
            •Explain sponsor job requirements.
            •Conduct the initial orientation briefing.
        1.4.3.4. Sponsors must make themselves available to assist newcomers. They must treat new-
        comers as welcome additions to the unit, assisting them individually from the day they enter the
        unit until they become acclimatized.
        1.4.3.5. Unit commanders appoint a unit INTRO manager, in writing, sending a copy of the
        appointment letter to the MPF Customer Service section. A copy is maintained in accordance
        with AFMAN 37-139.
        1.4.3.6. During the INTRO Program, only the following people may address newcomers:
            •Wing or group commander
            •Career enhancement section
           •Senior enlisted advisor
           •MPF chief
        1.4.3.7. The INTRO Program must include the wing or group commander and the retention pro-
        gram manager.
        1.4.3.8. Confine the newcomer's INTRO program to 2 hours or less, if possible. At the conclu-
        sion of the newcomers orientation, inprocessing and ancillary training may be conducted.
        1.4.3.9. Newly assigned members must attend the INTRO program within two UTAs of their
        assignment to the unit.
        EXCEPTION: Members who will attend basic military training (BMT), technical school, or
        other form of training within 60 days of their assignment to the unit may be temporarily excused
        from INTRO. These members must attend INTRO within two UTAs of their return from applica-
        ble training.

                     REENLISTMENT AND EXTENSION OF ENLISTMENT:

2.1. Who Is Eligible for Reenlistment:
    •Members assigned to regular or reserve units formed as supplements in the event of mobilization.
    •Individual mobilization augmentees (IMA).
    •Participating individual reservists assigned to RRPS or the USAFR squadrons.
    •Individual ready reserve (IRR) members participating in the IRR bonus program.
    •Standby reserve members assigned to the nonaffiliated reserve section ND (includes reservists with
        or without MSOs who have requested assignment to this section to continue participation after
        being designated a key employee, or an appointed or elected official.)
    •Members being assigned to the selected reserve from ARPC who are within 180 days of expiration
        of term of service (ETS) and who require reenlistment.
    •Members who are eligible for reenlistment and are within 6 months of current ETS.
    •Members who are serving in a bonus AFSC and are within 30 days of current ETS (unless HQ
        AFRES/DPRV waives the requirement or the member is reenlisting for the Montgomery GI Bill
        program).
    •Statutory tour applicants (USC 678). Members who are eligible for reenlistment and are more than 6
        months from current ETS.
    •Members in Reserve Sanctuary. These members have at least 18, but less than 20 satisfactory years
        for reserve retirement.

2.2. Qualifications for Reenlistment. Members are initially eligible if they meet the age, grade, physi-
cal, and screening requirements outlined in Table 6.1..
     2.2.1. The commander must discharge eligible members according to AFI 36-3209. Members will be
     discharged on the effective date before reenlistment. However, ETS may not exceed the member's
     high year of tenure date (HYTD).
     2.2.2. For Air Force enlisted members who have not completed their military service obligation
     (MSO), the obligation carries forward into the new reenlistment.

2.3. Requirements for Reenlistment:
     2.3.1. In the United States and Its Possessions and Territories. The members servicing MPF reen-
     lists members. MPFs do not reenlist IMAs without prior notice from HQ ARPC/MSP.
     2.3.2. Outside the United States and Its Possessions and Territories. Any overseas Air Force
     MPF with the authority to do so reenlists members. To reenlist members not under their jurisdiction,
     the MPF must get authorization from HQ AFRES/DPR (HQ ARPC/MSP for IMAs and participating
     IRR/NDs).

2.4. Members Not Eligible for Reenlistment. Members whose DIN RBA is anything other than 5A are
ineligible to reenlist. (See Table 6.2. for ineligible reasons and RBA codes.)
AFI36-2612 25 July 1994                                                                                 19

2.5. Retention After Completion of 18 or More, But Less Than 20, Years of Ser v i c e ( T i t l e 1 0
U.S.C. 1176):
    •Prohibits AFRES from involuntarily separating enlisted personnel.
    •Except for physical disability or for cause, if they have completed at least 18 but less than 20 years
        satisfactory service for retirement purposes.
    •Enlisted personnel in this category must be afforded the opportunity to reach minimum eligibility for
        retirement.
    •Personnel with 18 but less than 19 years satisfactory service are authorized to serve to:
    •The date on which they are entitled to be credited with 20 years satisfactory service, or
    •The third anniversary of the date on which they would otherwise be discharged or transferred from
        an active status.
    •Personnel with 19 but less than 20 years satisfactory service are authorized to serve to:
    •The date on which they are entitled to be credited with 20 years satisfactory service, or
   •The second anniversary of the date on which they would otherwise be discharged or transferred from
      an active status.
   •Personnel who have been denied reenlistment and have exhausted their appeals will have their ETS
      computed according to the formula stated above.
   •Commanders and MPF chiefs cannot deny extensions of enlistment requested by these personnel.
   •Commanders and MPF chiefs cannot cancel extensions for quality force reasons. Commanders must
      pursue involuntary administrative discharge for cause if they do not want personnel in this cate-
      gory to retire.
   •MPF chiefs will approve requests for extension of enlistment on sanctuary protected enlisted person-
      nel for the years, months, and/or days necessary for the member to meet minimum Reserve retire-
      ment eligibility.

2.6. Waivers of Reenlistment Ineligibility. The Secretary of the Air Force (SAF) may grant or deny
reenlistment to any person if it is in the best interest of the Air Force. Generally, waiver and approval
authority is the same as for members reenlisting (AFI 36-2215) and enlisting (AFI 36-2002) in the regular
Air Force. The wing or group commander (that is, the senior Reserve ART commander) authorizes the
final determination on grade waiver.
   2.6.1. Unit members send requests for secretarial-level waivers through command channels to HQ
   AFRES/DPR, Robins AFB GA 31098-1635.
   2.6.2. IMAs submit requests through command channels to HQ ARPC/MSP, 6760 East Irvington
   Place #3800, Denver CO 80280-3800.
   2.6.3. HQ AFRES/DPR and HQ ARPC/MSP send requests they think worthy of consideration to HQ
   USAF/REP, Washington DC 20330-5000, for final review. HQ USAF/REP sends requests to SAF.
   AFRES, ARPC, or HQ USAF/REP may disapprove requests and return them to the requestors.
       2.6.3.1. If a member is not eligible for reenlistment, the unit commander does one of three things:
           •Initiates a request for waiver of the disqualification.
           •Denies reenlistment.
20                                                                          AFI36-2612 25 July 1994

        •Requests termination of the reenlistment by an administrative discharge.
     2.6.3.2. If administrative discharge is approved, the commander sends the member a copy of the
     administrative discharge order and a letter stating that existing directives did not authorize reen-
     listment and that this reenlistment is invalid. In the letter, the commander gives specific reasons
     for the discharge and explains that service during the reenlistment may not be credited to any pur-
     pose.

                                       SELECTION PROCESS

3.1. Reenlistment Policy. Reenlistment in the Air force Reserve is not a right; it is a privilege. It obli-
gates the individual to serve in the active military service in the event of mobilization. Members have the
right to be considered for reenlistment or extension if they:
    •Are eligible for reenlistment.
    •Have qualities that are essential for continued service in the USAFR.
    •Can perform duty in a career field for which the Air Force has a specific need (or the Air Force
        approves their retraining requests to fill valid requirements).
    •Have 18 but less than 20 satisfactory years for reserve retirement.

3.2. Selection Objectives. Only by maintaining a force of dedicated, productive career airmen can the
USAFR fulfill its national security obligation. The quality of the career airmen force depends on how
supervisors and commanders make their selections. Those selected for reenlistment must show the capa-
bility and dedication for a reserve career.

3.3. Selection Level:
   3.3.1. Unit Commander. The unit commander has selection authority for all assigned enlisted mem-
   bers. For IMAs, the selection authority is either the commander of the unit of assignment or the com-
   mander of the unit of attachment.
   3.3.2. Reserve Commander. The senior Reserve commander has appointing authority for reenlist-
   ment appeal review boards and serves as the final selection authority in appeal cases. Only NAF per-
   sonnel may serve as board members, for NAF assigned members who are appealing their
   reenlistment.
   EXCEPTION: An ART denied reenlistment after appeal has the option to further appeal to HQ
   AFRES/CV through the NAF commander and HQ AFRES/DP.
     •A non-ART Reserve member being denied reenlistment by the supervising wing commander has
        the option to further appeal to the NAF commander (4 AF, 10 AF, 22 AF).

3.4. Selection Factors:
   3.4.1. Primary Factors. In selecting Air Force enlisted members for reenlistment, give primary con-
   sideration to:
       •Initial eligibility according to paragraphs 2.1. and 2.2.
       •Performance
       •Recommendations of their immediate supervisor
   3.4.2. Other Factors. In addition, for each member consider:
       •Potential
       •Grade and skill-level
       •Aptitudes
22                                                                            AFI36-2612 25 July 1994

        •Education
        •Motivation
        •Self-improvement efforts
        •Training and participation
        •Derogatory information
        •Physical condition
        •Attitude and behavior
        •Assumption of responsibilities
        •Other related information
     3.4.3. Nonfactors. A person's own desire to reenlist or not will have no bearing on selection determi-
     nation.

3.5. Selection and Nonselection Procedures:
     3.5.1. Notice of Application. For each member due to be considered to reenlistment, the retention
     program manager (HQ ARPC/MSP for IMAs) gives the unit commander (unit of assignment for
     IMAs and participating IRR/NDs) a reserve selection retention process roster (RESSRP) (for IMAs, a
     reenlistment eligibility brief [REB]), within 14 months before current ETS (within 12 months for
     IMAs).
        3.5.1.1. When the member must be considered for reenlistment more than 14 months (12 months
        for IMAs) before current ETS, the unit commander sends written notification to the MPF (reten-
        tion program manager), (unit of assignment for IMAs and participating IRR/NDs) of the member's
        selection or nonselection for reenlistment.
        3.5.1.2. For members with an 8-year military service obligation (MSO) who have completed
        fewer than 6 years of their MSO:
            •Current ETS is adjusted to equal completion of 6 years MSO.
            •Term of enlistment (TOE) is 6 years.
            •Date of enlistment (DOE) is the date MSO was initially incurred (normally, the date the
                member initially entered military service (DIEMS)).

NOTE:
This rule does not apply to PALACE CHASE.
        3.5.1.3. For members with an 8-year MSO who have completed at least 6 years of their MSO:
            •Reenlistment will be concurrent with their assignment to the unit program (first UTA is
                 acceptable).
            •TOE must cover the remaining MSO.
            •If the member has no remaining MSO, term of enlistment will be 2 to 6 years.
            •RESSRP and recommendation of the commander is not required.
AFI36-2612 25 July 1994                                                                             23

NOTE:
This rule does not apply to PALACE CHASE.
      3.5.1.4. For PALACE CHASE, see paragraph 3.7.
   3.5.2. Supervisor Evaluation. The immediate supervisor reviews the selection factors in 3.4. to
   determine whether to recommend the member for reenlistment.
      3.5.2.1. If the supervisor recommends reenlistment, they will use either initials, Xs, or check
      marks and signs the appropriate blocks on the RESSRP RIP or REB and sends it to the unit com-
      mander.
      3.5.2.2. If not recommending reenlistment, the supervisor completes the RESSRP RIP or REB
      and submits it with an AF Form 418, Selective Reenlistment Program Consideration, to the unit
      commander. On AF Form 418, the supervisor explains why they did not recommend the member
      for reenlistment.
   3.5.3. Selection Processing. The unit (or unit of assignment) commander weighs the supervisor’s
   recommendation and other pertinent data and decides whether to select the member for reenlistment.
      3.5.3.1. To select the member, the commander:
          •Initials, Xs, or check marks selection and signs the appropriate blocks on the RESSRP RIP or
              REB.
          •Destroys the AF Form 418 submitted by the supervisor.
          •Notifies the member of selection for reenlistment (adding words of appreciation for the mem-
              ber's past and potential contribution to the unit's mission).
          •Has the member complete the appropriate block on the RESSRP RIP.
          •Counsels members who are undecided about or decline reenlistment. Annotates comments in
              the space provided on the SRP. (For IMAs, HQ ARPC/MSP obtains the member's reen-
              listment intent.)
      3.5.3.2. To not select the member, the commander:
          •Personally advises the member of the nonselection.
          •Completes AF Form 418.
          •Has the member initial acknowledgment, sign,and date the AF Form 418.
          •Advises the member in writing of the right to appeal nonselection under paragraph 3.8. of
              this instruction.
          •Submits AF Form 418, with supporting documentation, to the retention program manager
              (HQ ARPC/MSP for IMAs).
   3.5.4. Final Processing:
      3.5.4.1. After completing selection processing, the commander or unit career advisor sends the
      RESSRP RIP or REB to the retention program manager (HQ ARPC/MSP for IMAs/ participating
      IRR/NDs).
      3.5.4.2. The retention program manager (HQ ARPC/MSPC-2) updates the DIN RBA to:
          •5A for the members who will reenlist.
24                                                                             AFI36-2612 25 July 1994

            •5L for members projected for ETS discharge (will not reenlist).
            •5B for members who are undecided about reenlistment.
            3.5.4.2.1. The retention program manager schedules counseling at least 6 months before ETS
            for members declining reenlistment.
            3.5.4.2.2. Members required to reenlist concurrent with their assignment to the unit program
            that decline to reenlist will be reassigned to the non-participating IRR within 30 days of the
            date they declined to reenlist. Do not apply this rule to PALACE CHASE.
            3.5.4.2.3. If members declining reenlistment have completed 6 years of their MSO:
                •Reassign them to the IRR on the 6th anniversary of their MSO.
                •Change TOE to 8 (before assignment).
                •Change ETS to equal expiration of term of obligation (ETO) (before assignment).

     paragraph 3.8. of this instruction.
        3.5.5.1. The member must submit a written appeal to MPF by the next scheduled UTA after the
        date they were notified. (IMAs submit their appeal to their MAJCOM within 30 days of notice.)
        3.5.5.2. For unit members, the retention program manager processes the AF Form 418 when it is
        received from the unit commander, for appeal action, if applicable.
        3.5.5.3. For IMAs/participating IRR/NDs, HQ ARPC/MSP forwards the commander's nonselec-
        tion package and member's appeal package to the member's MAJCOM.

          •Ensures reassignment to the non-participating IRR within 30 days of the date final nonselec-
             tion occurred.
          •Changes TOE to 8 (before assignment).
          •Changes ETS to equal ETO (before assignment).
          •Updates RBA code to 5E (nonselection for reenlistment) before personnel relocation updates
             the member's assignment in the personnel data system (PDS).
   3.5.7. Changes in Reenlistment Status:
      3.5.7.1. If the unit commander selects a member for reenlistment but later deems the member
      ineligible to reenlist, the commander prepares AF Form 418 and processes it as if it were an initial
      nonselection. The commander:
          •Places an "X" in the "not recommended" block of AF Form 418.
          •Sends the form to MPF Career Enhancement Section for processing.
      3.5.7.2. For PALACE CHASE, see paragraph 3.7.
      3.5.7.3. If the commander does not select the member initially but later reconsiders the member
      for reenlistment, the commander prepares AF Form 418 as the RESSRP RIP or REB for IMAs.

          •Places an "X" in the "selected" block in AF Form 418.
          •Sends the form to MPF Career Enhancement Section (HQ ARPC/MSP) for processing.
          •Career Enhancement updates the DIN RBA code in accordance with this instruction.
   3.5.8. Waivers of Reenlistment Disqualification . If the unit commander recommends a grade
   waiver, they send the recommendation through Career Enhancement to the wing or group commander
   for a final decision. (Waivers of reenlistment disqualification for age require SAF approval. The com-
   mander sends these waivers to HQ USAF/REP).
      3.5.8.1. The retention program manager (for IMAs, the MAJCOM advises HQ ARPC/MSP)
      updates DIN RBA to spaces (no entry in this data field is necessary) on approved waivers.
      3.5.8.2. The retention program manager processes the RESSRP RIP.
      3.5.8.3. Career enhancement attaches the approved grade waiver to DD Form 4 in accordance

who are without MSO and are transferring directly to the unit program follows.
   3.6.1. Members who possess a valid DD Form 4 and are not serving on an extension of enlistment do
   not require reenlistment.
   3.6.2. Members who are serving on an extension of enlistment must be reenlisted concurrent with
   their assignment (first UTA is acceptable).
   3.6.3. Members who are assigned before the reenlistment changes take effect and who are serving on
   an extension of enlistment, may request reenlistment under the provisions of paragraph 5.3. Reenlist-
   ment under these circumstances terminates their extension.
26                                                                          AFI36-2612 25 July 1994

     3.6.4. Members who are serving on an extension that exceeds 23 months at the time of assignment
     must reenlist to cover this period. They may be in direct violation of AFRES 23 months maximum
     extension rules.
     3.6.5. PALACE CHASE members must be reenlisted by the gaining reserve MPF, unless (for mem-
     bers without remaining MSO) this action was accomplished by the losing active duty MPF.

3.7. Selection and Nonselection Procedures: (PALACE CHASE)

3.8. Appeal Options. Members may appeal their nonselection for reenlistment through one of two
options:
     3.8.1. Appeals to Senior Reserve Commander. Unit members may appeal to their senior reserve
     commander (IMA members may appeal through the unit commander to HQ ARPC/MSP) for final
     selection or nonselection authority. (For ART personnel, see paragraph 3.3.2.)
         •The senior reserve commander is the NAF, wing, or detached group commander of the com-
             mander making the nonselection.

4.5. Handling Erroneous Reenlistment Documents. There are two types of errors on reenlistment doc-
uments: contractual errors and administrative errors. Requests to correct these errors are made in the best
interest of the Air Force.
      4.5.1. Contractual Errors. These are errors made in violation of this instruction. For example, reen-
      listment of an airman who is not eligible to reenlist is a contractual violation. Only NAF personnel
      liaison, HQ AFRES/DPR, HQ ARPC/MSP, or HQ USAF/REP may correct this kind of error.
         4.5.1.1. When it identifies a contractual error, MPF/Career Enhancement sends a request to void
         the reenlistment through channels to NAF/Personnel Liaison (HQ ARPC/MSP for IMAs). In the
         request, include:
             •Circumstances of the error.
             •Recommendation of the unit commander.
             •Statement of circumstance from the airman.

        4.5.1.2. Send requests that cannot be resolved to HQ AFRES/DPR (HQ ARPC/MSP, for IMAs).
        4.5.1.3. If HQ AFRES/DPR or ARPC/MSP decides that the contract is invalid, it may recom-
        mend the airman for separation.
            4.5.1.3.1. A member who disagrees with this decision must apply to the Air Force Board of
            Correction of Military Records according to AFI 36-2603.
     4.5.2. Administrative Errors. These are technical errors such as typographical mistakes, strikeovers,
     and misspellings.
        4.5.2.1. The member and the reenlistment officer must initial each correction. Correct adminis-
        trative errors discovered in any block of the DD Form 4 at base-level.
            4.5.2.1.1. The MPF chief represents the AFRES in initializing and overseeing the correction
            required if the reenlistment officer is not available.
            4.5.2.1.2. The member must initial each correction in the presence of the enlistment officer or
            MPF chief, as appropriate.
        4.5.2.2. Make corrections only if the airman and AFRES consent to them.
        4.5.2.3. Resolve disagreements by filling out a statement of understanding and agreement (Fig-
        ure 4.1.).
        4.5.2.4. Remove only the pages that require correction, not the entire set.
        4.5.2.5. Type the appropriate corrections (or sign, if signature is incorrect) on the record copy of
        the DD Form 4. On the upper margin of the corrected pages, type in capital letters "CORRECTED
        COPY--CORRECTIONS AUTHORIZED ACCORDING TO AFI 36-2612."
        4.5.2.6. On completion of the correction, reproduce a copy of the corrected DD Form 4.
        4.5.2.7. Attach the reproduced copy to the DD Form 4 in the airman’s UPRG.
        4.5.2.8. Send the corrected pages of the DD Form 4 to HQ ARPC/DSMPB 6760 E IRVINGTON
        PL #4400, Denver CO 80280-4400.

        Records Transmittal/Request.
     4.5.3. File Updates. If necessary, MPF/Career Enhancement (HQ ARPC or MSP for IMAs updates
     the PDS and DIN DATA. Specifically, it updates the DOE, TOE, ETS, and sources of original entry
     (SOE).

                                    EXTENSION PROCEDURES

5.1. Eligibility for Voluntary Extension. The following may ask for an extension of enlistment:
   5.1.1. College students who enlisted under AFRESR 33-1 but did not graduate on time. If the period
   of enlistment is not enough to meet the contractual agreement, they may apply for extension.
   5.1.2. Members under waiver consideration by HQ ARPC/SG for physical disqualification.
   5.1.3. Members with less than 2 years remaining for entitlement to retired pay. The extension may
   not go beyond the member’s 64th birthday. This paragraph is the authority for such an extension.

NOTE:
Members who are 58 or 59 years old and have at least 20 satisfactory years for retirement, may extend
only to their 60th birthday or HYTD, whichever occurs first.
   5.1.4. Members who are in ISLRS and whose enlistment expires. HQ ARPC/DPRA must decide that
   retention is in the best interest of the Air Force.
   5.1.5. Members who are applying for transfer or assignment to the retired reserve under AFI 36-3203.
   The member must request an extension for an unspecified period contingent on transfer to the retired
   reserve (paragraph 5.2.1 does not apply). If approved, HQ ARPC/DPRA extends enlistment for an
   unspecified period. This extension takes effect on the date the member transfers to the retired reserve.
   (You do not need AF Form 1411, Extension of Cancellation of Extensions of Enlistment in the
   Regular Air Force/Air Force Reserve.)
   5.1.6. Selectees for the US Air Force Academy Preparatory School (AFI 36-2021). Members may
   extend if their enlistment will expire before they complete their required period of active duty.
   5.1.7. Members who need service retainability to attend technical school.
   5.1.8. Members who need service retainability to go on statutory tour (U.S.C. 678).
   5.1.9. Members who receive a recommendation. The recommendation may be for any reason in the
   best interest of the service or may be required by other directives or announced programs.
       5.1.9.1. Convenience of the member is not grounds for extension.
       5.1.9.2. Members must otherwise qualify for reenlistment.
   5.1.10. Members who are applying for benefits under the Reserve Montgomery GI Bill Program and
   have fewer than 6 years left of selected reserve enlistment. The extension should cover enough years
   to carry current TOE to 6 or more years.
   5.1.11. Members who are on the weight management program. Extend enlistment only to the date the
   program requires the member to meet weight standards according to AFI 40-502 (paragraph 5.2.1
   applies). Do not authorize additional extensions.
   5.1.12. Members who need fewer than 23 months of extending to meet their HYTD. You may extend
   a member’s contract at any time for this purpose. Extend enlistment for the exact years, months, and
   days needed.
38                                                                             AFI36-2612 25 July 1994

     5.1.13. Period of voluntary extension. Voluntary extensions are for whole month periods needed to
     serve their purpose but not more than 23 months unless HQ AFRES/DPR or HQ ARPC/MSP
     approves a waiver.
     5.1.14. Members who have 18 but fewer than 20 satisfactory years for Reserve retirement.

5.2. Reasons for Involuntary Extension. The commander designated under paragraph 5.3. may autho-
rize involuntary extensions of enlistments:
    •For members with an MSO whose enlistment expires before they complete a period of active duty
        ordered because of unsatisfactory participation.
    •When directed in the event of war or national emergency (Title 10, U.S.C., Sections 511(c), 671a,
        671b, 672(a), and 673(a)).
    •For a member's trial by court-martial, if begun while the member is subject to the Uniform Code of
        Justice (UCMJ).
    •For a member's positive urinalysis test results, if identification is within the time frame that would
        not allow for administrative discharge action to take place without an extension to current ETS.
EXCEPTION: The 23-month requirement does not apply to extensions in the IRR under paragraph 5.1.5.
or 5.1.8.

5.3. Extension Approval Authorities:
     5.3.1. Unit Commander. The unit commander (unit of assignment commander, for IMAs) makes the
     final decision on any request for voluntary extension. The unit commander may also cancel or termi-
     nate a voluntary extension. Commanders who have MPF under their command may delegate this
     responsibility to the MPF.
     5.3.2. HQ ARPC/DPRA. This office may direct (for IMAs), process (for IRR members), or cancel
     involuntary extensions under paragraph 5.2.
     5.3.3. MAJCOMs. MAJCOMS may direct or cancel involuntary extensions of enlistments for IMAs
     under paragraph 5.2.

5.4. Completing Documentation for Extensions:
     5.4.1. MPF Actions. The chief of the MPF completes AF Form 1411, section 5, designating someone
     to decide on extension requests. The following people may be designees.
        5.4.1.1. NCOs assigned to MPF/Career Enhancement or HQ ARPC/MSP in the grade of technical
        sergeant or higher, and their rating and endorsing officials. Civilians assigned to MPF career
        enhancement in the pay grade of GS-05 or higher.
        5.4.1.2. The chief customer support, if serving in the grade of technical sergeant or higher.
        5.4.1.3. A technical sergeant or above (AFSC 3S0X1) or officer assigned to the MPF during
        mobility deployment and readiness exercises. These people may decide on extensions only during
        the period of the exercise only.
AFI36-2612 25 July 1994                                                                              39

NOTE:
The MPF chief appoints these authorities in writing and, at the end of the exercise, destroys AF Form
1411 used for exercise purposes.
   5.4.2. Career Enhancement Actions. Career enhancement personnel (HQ ARPC/MSP, for IMAs):
       •Send the original AF Form 1411 to HQ ARPC/DSMPB, 6760 E Irvington Pl #4400, Denver CO
           80280-4400.
       •File a copy of AF Form 1411 (with duplicate DD Form 4) in the member's personnel record.
       •Update PDS.
       •Give a copy of AF Form 1411 to the member.
       •Announce involuntary extensions under paragraph 5.2. by special orders citing Title 10, U.S.C.,
           Section 673(a), and AFI 36-2612, paragraph 5.2., as authority. Distribute orders according to
           paragraph 5.4.2.
       •Announce involuntary extensions under paragraph 5.2. by Reserve Orders citing Title 10,
           U.S.C., Section 270(b), as authority. Distribute orders according to above.
       •IRR Bonus Recipients. A commissioned officer or notary public may sign extensions for IRR
           bonus recipients.

5.5. Canceling an Extension. Cancel extensions that the member has not yet entered if:
    •The Air Force cannot meet the terms on which it agreed to extend service (thus, completion of the
       extension would be unfair to the member).
    •Cancellation would be in the best interest of the service and the member.
    •The member wants to reenlist on original ETS instead of entering the extension.

NOTE:
Documentation. Use an AF Form 1411 to effect the cancellation. Sign and distribute the form according
to paragraph 5.4.2.

5.6. Terminating an Extension. Terminate extensions that the member has already begun serving if:
    •The member wants to reenlist and the new contract is sufficient to cover the extension period.
    •The reason for an involuntarily extension no longer exists.
    •The member meets weight standards according to AFI 40-502 and is now eligible to reenlist.
    •The unit commander's recommendation of nonselection for reenlistment has been upheld under para-
       graph 3.3.2. or 3.9.

NOTE:
Use AF Form 1411 to terminate a voluntary extension. Announce termination of an involuntary extension
by special order or reserve orders. Distribute forms and orders according to paragraph 5.4.

     ENLISTED PERSONNEL APPOINTMENT TO NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICER (NCO)
                       STATUS AND OFFICER RETENTION

                                                 Chapter 6

     NCO QUALIFICATIONS AND REASSIGNMENT UPON MAXIMUM SERVICE OR AGE

6.1. Policy on NCO Qualifications:
    •The Air Force terminated appointment to NCO status on 1 May 1991.
    •Applicants transferring or enlisting who have no break in service and are sergeants, retain that status
       until 30 April 1997, unless they are promoted or demoted.
    •Applicants enlisting on or after 2 May 1991 who have a break in service are enlisted as senior air-
       men, whether or not they previously held NCO status.

6.2. Reassignment Upon Maximum Service or Age.

6.3. Reserve Commissioned Officers. The Air Force separates reserve commissioned officers accord-
ing to AFI 36-3209, when the officers reach the prescribed maximum service or age limit for their grade,
whichever occurs first. There are two exceptions to this rule.
     6.3.1. Officers may be retained beyond the maximum service or age limit under the sanctuary provi-
     sions of Title 10 U.S.C. 1006.
     6.3.2. SAF may waive maximum service or age retention requirements under certain circumstances
     (see table 3.3). For such waivers it considers the following factors:
         •Air Force medical service wartime readiness requirements and taskings (if the applicant is a
             medical services officer).
         •The USAFR medical career development program (if the applicant is a medical services officer).
         •Whether the applicant has been awarded constructive service credit.
         •Availability of a suitable replacement.
         •The applicant's duty performance.
         •The best interest of the nation and the US Air Force.
         •Medical recruiting shortfalls and US Air Force medical staffing projections by corps and AFSC.
         •The date the reservist will earn 20 satisfactory years for paid retirement (applications for waivers
             under Title 10 U.S.C. 8855 do not ensure retention to age 60 or 68, as applicable.) NOTE:
             Normally, reservists are not retained beyond this date. For certain reservists, however, SAF
             may approve retention (Title 10 U.S.C. 676, and table 3.3).

6.4. Enlisted Members. Enlisted members may not take part in the Selected Reserve past the prescribed
maximum service or age limit, whichever occurs first. The following are exceptions to this rule:
    •The enlisted member may serve beyond the prescribed maximum age or service if they are retained
       for an additional 3 years (through an extension).
AFI36-2612 25 July 1994                                                                                  41

    •The enlisted member may be retained if they reach the service or age limit before serving 20 satisfac-
       tory years for Reserve retirement (SYRR).
    •Enlisted members who cannot achieve 20 SYRR before age 60 must apply for a waiver. If the
       waiver is approved, the member will be allowed to take part for the specific number of years,
       months, and days needed to attain 20 SYRR, up to age 64.
    •Such waivers are denied to members who have an unsatisfactory Retirement/Retention (R/R) year
       during the grace period unless the unsatisfactory R/R year was due to circumstances beyond the
       member's control. The grace period is 1 January 1989 through the member's adjusted HYTD.
    •Enlisted members who reach the prescribed maximum service or age and have 20 SYRR are dis-
       charged from the USAFR according to AFI 36-3209, unless they are transferred to the Retired
       Reserve (AFI 36-3203).

NOTES:

     1.Member may opt to extend if required retainability is 23 months or less.
     2.Reenlistment is accomplished upon award of 3-level AFSC.
     3.Reenlistment more than 30 calendar days before current ETS requires waiver by HQ AFRES/DPRV
         unless reenlisting for the Montgomery G.I. Bill Program.
     4.Members must reenlist for a period equal to their temporary nonmilitary or religious mission (not
         more than 30 months) plus the service remaining on their previous enlistment. (See Figure 4.1.
         for required statement of understanding and agreement.)
     5.First-term airmen serving in the grade of airman first class may reenlist without waiver, if they have
         less than 4 years total service at time of reenlistment. See paragraph 3.5. for grade waiver

     6.Members who are age 54, but less than age 60 and are within 23 months of age 60, are extended to
         age 60, or HYTD whichever occurs first. Individuals who are age 54 or greater are reenlisted for
         the number of years, months, and days required to reach age 60 or HYTD, whichever occurs first.
     7.Members who are age 60 and who can attain retirement eligibility by age 64, but require more than
         23 months of service to attain eligibility, are reenlisted for the years, months, and days required to
         reach retirement eligibility.
     8.Reenlistment for 1 year is limited to members who will complete their MSO by current ETS (Unit
         Program Only).

                                                Chapter 7

                                             PROCEDURES

7.1. USAFR Membership. Membership in the USAFR is a privilege. It obligates a person to serve in
the active military service in the event of mobilization or emergency, or at other times as the national
security may require.

7.2. USAFR Tenure Program. A tenure program within the USAFR is essential to avoid the loss of
combat readiness resulting from a maturing force. The objective of the USAFR tenure program is to
effectively manage the USAFR officer and enlisted force, thereby achieving the military objectives
assigned to the USAFR.

7.3. USAFR Enlisted HYT Program. This program is designed to improve grade ratios, ensure sus-
tained promotion opportunity for lower graded enlisted personnel, and increase readiness by providing a
force fit for the rigors of war.
     7.3.1. The HYT program limits participation in the selected reserve and the participating IRR pro-
     grams to a total of 33 years creditable service for military pay (CSMP or pay date) for all USAFR
     enlisted members of the USAFR unless they are selected for retention beyond HYT.
     7.3.2. Except as provided for in paragraph 7.5.1.2., each member’s high year tenure date (HYTD) cor-
     responds to the first day of the month following either member’s pay date plus 33 years or age 60,
     whichever occurs first.

7.4. Who Qualifies for the HYT Program.
     7.4.1. The Air Force considers all USAFR enlisted personnel in the selected reserve, participating
     IRR, and participating Standby, regardless of grade who have or will achieve 33 years of CSMP.
     7.4.2. The Air Force does not enlist members of any regular, guard, or USAFR component if they
     would have 33 or more years of total federal military service (TFMS) at the time of enlistment in the
     USAFR.
         •Members who have at least 28 TFMS must be enlisted for the exact years, months, and days
            needed to reach 33 years' TFMS.

7.5. Procedures:
     7.5.1. Statutory Tour (ST):
        7.5.1.1. Members who were on a statutory tour before 1 January 1989 are eligible to complete
        their normal tour.
            7.5.1.1.1. If their tour completion date (TCD) is before HYTD, they are eligible for follow-on
            Selected Reserve participation up to HYTD.
AFI36-2612 25 July 1994                                                                              45

          7.5.1.1.2. If their TCD is after their HYTD, they serve out their statutory tour, if otherwise
          qualified.
       7.5.1.2. Members not on a statutory tour on 1 January 1989 who are selected to serve a statutory
       tour may serve up to their HYTD if TCD would extend past HYTD.
           •Members with a pay date year 1957 or later may request waiver of HYTD according to AFI
               36-2115. If they are selected they may have their TCD extended to the normal TCD for
               their statutory tour or adjusted HYTD, whichever occurs first. Waiver of HYTD is pro-
               cessed by HQ USAF/REP and approved by HQ USAF/RE.
   7.5.2. ART Personnel:
       7.5.2.1. Establish initial ART HYTD according to paragraph 8.5.
       7.5.2.2. 14 months before HYTD, MPF or personnel relocation notifies the servicing civilian per-
       sonnel office to place ARTs under the DOD priority placement program (PPP). (NOTE: The
       CPO enrolls the ARTs in the PPP 12 months before HYTD.
   7.5.3. Enlistment and Assignment Constraints. Prospective enlistees and assignees having 33 or
   more years CSMP are not eligible for enlistment or assignment to the participating ready or standby
   reserve.

7.6. Adjustments. Only HQ AFRES/DPRV or HQ ARPC/MSPC-2 may adjust HYTD. If an adjustment
to HYTD is necessary for a USAFR unit member, the following procedures apply:
    •MPF personnel relocation section prepares request containing relevant information and sends it to
       HQ AFRES/DPRV.
    •HQ AFRES/DPRV adjusts HYTD as required.
    •HQ ARPC/DPAD verifies established HYTD for IMAs and makes adjustments when necessary.
   7.6.1. .Adjustment Criteria. Adjust HYTD to age 60 to allow members to complete 33 years CSMP.
   Such members must have 20 SYRR but fewer than 33 years CSMP before normally established
   HYTD.

NOTE:
Do not use this provision for members who are 60 or older and have 20 SYRR. Members with at least 20
SYRR may not participate past age 60.
   7.6.2. Adjust HYTD to allow members to attain 20 SYRR by age 64. During this grace period (1 Jan-
   uary 1989 or thereafter), the member may not have an unsatisfactory year.
   7.6.3. Adjust HYTD to coincide with normal TCD for members who entered a statutory tour before 1
   January 1989 and have a TCD that extends beyond normally established HYTD.
   7.6.4. Adjust HYTD to current ETS for members who reenlisted before 1 November 1988 and whose
   current ETS extends beyond normally established HYTD.
   7.6.5. Adjust HYTD for ARTs to the earliest date the member can retire from civil service without
   incurring a reduced annuity or established military HYTD, whichever is greater. For example, use
   this rule to adjust HYTD for ARTs who reenlisted before 1 November 1988.
46                                                                            AFI36-2612 25 July 1994

     7.6.6. When a member losses ART status and HYTD was adjusted to allow for civil service retire-
     ment, adjust HYTD back to its original date.
     7.6.7. If the military HYTD has expired, the member is released from the military position on the date
     their ART status terminates.
     7.6.8. Reassign, retire, or separate the ART member no later than 120 days after member vacates
     ART position. The member may not participate after HYTD or during the actions just mentioned.
     7.6.9. Adjust HYTD for members selected for continuation. For ARTs, compute adjustment on the
     basis of established military HYTD.

7.7. Personnel Data System (PDS) Products. Use these products with the USAFR enlisted HYT pro-
gram (category A or unit program). For the Direct English Statement Information Retrieval (DESIRE):
     7.7.1. MPF’s develop a local DESIRE to identify all members with HYTDs within the next 14
     months. For example, roster run in Jul 93 would identify HYTDs in September 1994 for review and
     consideration.
     7.7.2. Upon request, HQ AFRES/DPRV gives each MPF a list of the HYTD data in the HAF file.
     7.7.3. The MPF uses this list to validate HYTDs at base-level.
AFI36-2612 25 July 1994                                                                              47

                              WAIVERS (EXTENSIONS TO HYTD)

8.1. Criteria. The Air Force only rarely grants waivers to the 33-year maximum HYTD. It:
    •Considers waivers on a case-by-case basis.
    •Does not grant waivers to members with a pay date of 1956 or earlier (increment 1).
    •Considers for waivers only those members deemed essential to unit readiness.
    •Considers traditional USAFR (non-ART) and ART members who are within 14 months of their cur-
       rent HYTD.

8.2. Authority. Commanders may recommend for waivers only those members deemed essential to unit
readiness. Any level of the chain of command may disapprove a continuation waiver. This decision is
final and cannot be appealed.
   8.2.1. For Unit Members. HQ AFRES/CV is the waiver approval authority.
   8.2.2. For IMAs. The MAJCOM commander or designee is the waiver approval authority.
   8.2.3. For Members on Statutory Tour. The chief of the AFRES is the waiver approval authority.
   8.2.4. For Centrally Managed Programs. The IMA program manager (HQ ARPC/SG/JA/HC) is
   the waiver approval authority.
   8.2.5. For Elements, Federal Emergency Management Agency, and Selective Ser v i c e .           HQ
   ARPC/DR is the waiver approval authority.

8.3. Eligibility:
   8.3.1. ARTs whose civil service retirement date is at least 3 years later than HYTD are automatically
   continued to the civil service retirement date. They may not continue beyond that date.
   8.3.2. Members with pay date year 1957 or later (increments 2 and 3) may request an HYTD waiver.

8.4. Procedures:
   8.4.1. Member Notification. 14 months before the member's HYTD, Personnel Relocation section
   notifies all concerned parties that the member's HYTD is due to expire in 14 months. Notification
   consists of:
       •A letter mailed to the member's mailing address (listed in the PDS).
       •A letter to the member's unit commander.
       •A letter to the member's servicing CPO if the member is an ART. (The CPO uses this letter to
           enroll ARTs in the PPP at least 12 months before HYTD.)

NOTE:
MPF may give the wing or group commander and senior enlisted advisor (SEA) a list of members' pro-
jected HYT expiration dates.
48                                                                            AFI36-2612 25 July 1994

     8.4.2. Code Updating. MPF/Career Enhancement updates (all eligible HYTD waiver) reenlistment
     eligibility codes to "5S-Elects Consideration." (All members are presumed to elect consideration for
     continuation unless they decline such consideration in writing to their commander or the MPF.)
     8.4.3. Commander Decision:
        8.4.3.1. Upon notification by the MPF that an assigned member’s HYTD is to expire within the
        next 14 months, the member’s unit commander decides whether to request continuation of the
        member’s HYTD.
        8.4.3.2. The unit commander tells both the member and MPF whether they are requesting or dis-
        approving an extension to the HYTD. The commander makes this notification in writing no later
        than 6 months before the member’s HYTD expires.
     8.4.4. Request Procedures. Commanders may request a one-time, 3-year continuation waiver
     beyond the 33-year maximum HYTD. The Air Force safeguards requests throughout the waiver con-
     sideration process.
        8.4.4.1. In the request, the unit commander specifies:
            •Staffing by grade in member's AFSC.
            •Number of qualified members who could fill this position.
            •Number of personnel presently in or awaiting technical school.
            •Number of personnel in upgrade training to levels 5 and 7.
            •That recruiting efforts have not attracted another qualified candidate.
            •Why the member's service is indispensable to the unit's mission-ready status.
        8.4.4.2. The commander sends the request to MPF personnel relocation section.
        8.4.4.3. MPF personnel relocation section sends the request to the parent wing or group com-
        mander for endorsement.
        8.4.4.4. If the parent wing or group commander recommends approval, they return the request to
        MPF personnel relocation section.
        8.4.4.5. MPF personnel relocation section sends the request through NAF/CC to HQ AFRES/
        DPRV. The request should arrive no later than 4 months (about 120 days) before HYTD.
        8.4.4.6. HQ AFRES/DPRV sends the request to AFRES/CV for a final decision.
     8.4.5. When the Request is Disapproved:
        8.4.5.1. HQ AFRES/DPRV updates DIN RBA to code 5U (not selected), using personnel transac-
        tion identifier (PTI 41I).
        8.4.5.2. A transaction register (TR) is produced when DIN RBA updates to code 5U at base-level.
        8.4.5.3. MPF personnel relocation section uses the TR to complete the nonselection letter. Per-
        sonnel relocation section gives this letter to the parent wing or group commander for signature.
        NOTE: Personnel relocation is responsible for mailing the letter to the member.
        8.4.5.4. When notified that they have been denied continuation of HYTD, the member may elect
        one of several options:
            •Reassignment to the retired reserve, effective on HYTD.
AFI36-2612 25 July 1994                                                                                   49

           •Discharge on HYTD (see note 1).

NOTES:

   1.The MPF personnel relocation section then sends a list of disapproved continuation waivers to HQ
      AFRES/DPRV.
   2.Members who elect to separate, be discharged, or resign rather than transfer to the retired reserve
      must receive counseling on their reduced benefits and entitlements. If they have 20 years of satis-
      factory service, they must also sign a statement:


I have been counseled on my reduced benefits and entitlements, related to my discharge, separation, or
resignation, in lieu of retirement. I do not elect to retire and understand that I will not be eligible for
retirement at a later date.

Member's Signature Military Personnel


       8.4.5.5. The Air Force retires or separates nonselected members no later than 120 days from the
       date they were nonselected.
   8.4.6. Supplemental Consideration. If the unit commander determines that consideration for the
   member's continuation was denied because of an error, administrative oversight, or termination of
   ART status, they may ask for supplemental consideration according to paragraph 8.1.
       •Members who fail to receive or return a letter of notification are not eligible for supplemental
          consideration and may not participate beyond HYTD.
   8.4.7. When the Request Is Approved:
       8.4.7.1. The Air Force adds a 3-year extension to the original HYTD. Comparing this with the
       date the member turns age 60, it adjusts the HYTD to whichever date comes first.
       8.4.7.2. HQ AFRES/DPRV updates the adjusted HYTD and DIN RBA to code 5T (selected),
       using PTI 41I.
       8.4.7.3. A transaction register is produced when DIN RBA updates to code 5T at base level.
       8.4.7.4. The MPF personnel relocation section uses the TR to complete the selection letter. It then
       gives this letter to the parent wing or group commander for signature and mailing to the member.

NOTE:
Once extended or reenlisted, a member is not eligible for further participation beyond HYTD.
50                                                                            AFI36-2612 25 July 1994

8.5. Air Reserve Technicians (ART). For the purpose of the following explanation, military-HYTD
(MHYTD) is defined as 33 years of service based on pay date and civilian-HYTD (CHYTD) as civil ser-
vice retirement date.
     8.5.1. Eligibility. ART members with a pay date of 1958 or earlier may participate to age 60 in accor-
     dance with legislative approval. (See FY93 DOD Authorization/Appropriations Acts.)
     8.5.2. Criteria. Consideration for continuation is based on CHYTD or MHYTD, whichever is
     greater. Continuation of HYTD, however, is computed according to MHYTD.
     8.5.3. Loss of ART Status:
        8.5.3.1. When ARTs lose their ART status and their original HYTD expires, they may not con-
        tinue participating. The Air Force retires or discharges them within 120 days of their loss of ART
        status.
        8.5.3.2. When an ART loses ART status before CHYTD, the MPF personnel relocation section
        notifies HQ AFRES/DPRV to adjust CHYTD back to MHYTD.
        8.5.3.3. If the commander has not previously considered the ART member for continuation, they
        may request supplemental consideration. (See paragraph 8.4.6.)
AFI36-2612 25 July 1994                                                                               51

   9.1.1. HQ ARPC/MSPAR:
       •Notifies the member by certified mail 12 months before the established HYTD.
       •Sends a courtesy copy of the notification to the MAJCOM program manager (HQ ARPC/SG/JA/
          HC for centrally managed programs; HQ ARPC/DRM for Air Force elements, FEMA, and
          Selective Service System).

   electing discharge or retirement, HQ ARPC/MSP sends the necessary forms.

9.2. Waiver Consideration.
   9.2.1. The MAJCOM commander or their designee has the authority to grant a one time, 3-year con-
   tinuation waiver beyond the 33-year maximum. This waiver may be granted to members with a pay-
   date of 1957 or later. Extensions for continuation beyond the HYTD should be an exception, not a
   rule.
   9.2.2. The member initiates the waiver request and sends it through the organization's chain of com-
   mand to the MAJCOM of assignment.
   9.2.3. Any endorsing official in the chain of command may disapprove the request during the consid-
   eration process. Disapproval of a continuation waiver is final and cannot be appealed.

                   THE LINE LIEUTENANT COLONEL TENURE PROGRAM

10.1. Tenure Criteria. The Line Lieutenant Colonel Tenure Program limits participation in the selected
reserve to lieutenant colonels who:
    •Have 20 satisfactory years for reserve retirement (SYRR) (including the last 8 years USAFR service
       rule).
    •Have 6 or more years in grade.
   10.1.1. Eligibility . The lieutenant colonel tenure policy applies to all line officers, including rated
   officers, assigned to the selected reserve, participating IRR, and participating standby programs.
   10.1.2. Guidelines:
       10.1.2.1. Reassign or voluntarily retire officers meeting policy criteria no later than the last day of
       the month in which they reach 6 years time in grade (computed from promotion service date
       (PSD)). Exempt those members who have 6 years time-in-grade, but have not met retirement eli-
       gibility. Reassign or voluntarily retire these members no later than 60 days from verification of
       retirement eligibility by HQ ARPC/DPK.
       10.1.2.2. Compute time in grade from the officer's PSD.
       10.1.2.3. Reassign officers not electing retirement to the inactive status list reserve section
       (ISLRS).
       10.1.2.4. Officers may not resign their commission for the purpose of continued service in
       enlisted grades.
       10.1.2.5. If officers are within 90 days of the mandatory separation date (MSD), continue them to
       MSD.
       10.1.2.6. Develop procedures for advance identification and verification of members to ensure
       compliance with established effective dates.
       10.1.2.7. Notify members at least 180 days in advance of member's tenure date.
       10.1.2.8. Retain members meeting the criteria for tenure during the period 1 October through 30
       November and eligible for promotion until 31 December pending release of the promotion board
       results.
   10.1.3. ARTs Prior to Eligibility for Civil Service Retirement. Do not reassign or retire ARTs
   under this policy prior to their obtaining eligibility for civil service retirement--immediate annuity
   with no reduction due to age.
       •Under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS), 55 years of age and 20 years civil ser-
           vice--unreduced discontinued service retirement.
       •Under the Federal Employee's Retirement System (FERS), minimum retirement age (MRA) and
           20 years civil service--technician retirement.
   10.1.4. Tenure Within 12 Months. The MPF career enhancement section identifies officers who
   will meet tenure criteria within 12 months. For ARTs so identified, it:
54                                                                             AFI36-2612 25 July 1994

        •Asks the civilian personnel office (CPO) in writing to verify their civil service retirement eligi-
           bility.
        •Upon verification, notifies HQ AFRES/DPCS so that the latter can place ARTs in the PPP (this
           notification should occur at least 13 months before retirement eligibility).
        •Notify the personnel relocation section of officers who do not elect retirement (this notification
           should occur at least 30 days before tenure or retirement eligibility date).
     10.1.5. Notification. Guidelines for participating IRR and participating standby section.
        10.1.5.1. HQ ARPC/MSPAR will notify the MAJCOM Reserve program manager (HQ ARPC/
        DRM for AF Elements, FEMA, and Selective Service) 12 months before the member meets the
        criteria of the tenure program. Member will be projected to ISLRS 180 days before meeting the
        criteria.
        10.1.5.2. HQ ARPC/MSPAR will notify by certified mail, each lieutenant colonel affected by the
        tenure program of the available options 12 months before meeting the criteria:
            •Be reassigned to ISLRS.
            •Apply for transfer to the retired reserve.
     10.1.6. Waivers of "Tenure." Waivers are not generally authorized. Submit an "exception to pol-
     icy" request, through command channels to HQ USAF/RE, only in extremely rare cases where the
     loss of an individual would result in a mission failure. Rule of thumb: is the mission going to fail or
     suffer substantially as a result of the loss of the individual?
        10.1.6.1. Submit "exception to policy" requests through command channels and HQ AFRES/DP
        to AFRES/CV.
        10.1.6.2. AFRES/CV sends recommendations for "exception to policy" to HQ USAF/RE (HQ
        ARPC/CC or designee is the commander for 9631XXXX reservists) for final review and approval.
        10.1.6.3. Any level in the chain of command may disapprove the request for exception.
        10.1.6.4. Submit waiver requests at least 90 days prior to member's tenure date.

NOTES:

     1.Under Title 10 U.S.C. 8855, an officer may not be retained in an active status after the officer
         becomes 68 years of age.
     2.Officers may be retained to fulfill a mission-based requirement, i.e., aerospace medicine physician
         (AFSC 48GX), surgical skills (AFSC 45SX and 45BX), anesthesiologist (AFSC 4SAX), and
         nurses (AFSC 46XX). Waivers will be recommended for 3-year intervals. Individuals who com-
         plete 20 satisfactory years for paid retirement and do not possess a mission-based critical AFSC
         will not be favorably considered for waiver.
     3.If a member is currently serving in the ready reserve and has completed 20 years of satisfactory ser-
         vice, disregard column C. The member may be retained under this rule if it is in the best interest
         of the service.
     4.A reserve officer retained beyond age 60 under Title 10 U.S.C. 8855, who is or becomes eligible for
         paid retirement, is deemed to have been retained under Title 10 U.S.C. 676.
     5.Chaplains who are not, or will not be, eligible for paid retirement at age 60 may apply and be
         retained beyond age 60, based on the needs of the service, to date when 20 satisfactory years for
         paid retirement will be earned or until age 62 (Title 10 U.S.C. 1003). Chaplains who are or will
         be eligible for paid retirement at age 60, or at or before age 62, may apply and be retained beyond
         age 60, based on the needs of the service, until age 62 (Title 10 U.S.C. 676).
