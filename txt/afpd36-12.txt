1. Prompt and fair resolution of employeesâ€™ dissatisfactions provides better morale and increased pro-
ductivity. When these dissatisfactions arise from impermissible discrimination or the violation of the law,
the Air Force is committed to swift corrective action. This directive provides the policies for assuring
employees the redress of wrongs.

2. The Air Force will process fairly, impartially, and in a timely manner, all lawful expressions of dissat-
isfaction on matters of civilian employment.

3. In every situation, the Air Force will ensure that persons who take part in presenting or processing
expressions of dissatisfaction in approved forums are free from restraint, interference, coercion, discrimi-
nation, and reprisal.

4. The Air Force will resolve all civilian disputes as early as possible.

5. The Air Force will use alternative dispute resolution (ADR) approaches such as mediation, settlement
conferences, or other ADR techniques whenever possible, with the consent of the parties to the dispute.

6. This directive establishes the following responsibilities and authorities:
   6.1. The Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Manpower, Reserve Affairs, Installations and Envi-
   ronment (SAF/MI) is responsible for civilian personnel policy matters as described in Air Force Pol-
   icy Directive 90-1, Strategic Planning and Policy Formulation, paragraph 1.5.2. SAF/MI approval is
   required before this document is changed, reissued, or rescinded.
   6.2. The Deputy Chief of Staff, Personnel (HQ USAF/DP) develops, coordinates, and executes per-
   sonnel policy and approves essential procedural guidance for the management of the Dispute Resolu-
   tion Program.
   6.3. The Judge Advocate General provides legal advice, coordination, and litigation support.
7. These policies apply to Air Force civilian employees and, in discrimination matters, to applicants for
employment. They do not apply to Air National Guard technicians administered under Title 32 of the
United States Code, private contract employees, Army and Air Force Exchange Service employees, or
local national employees employed overseas. In addition, non-US citizens employed by the Air Force
outside the United States are not covered by the statutory discrimination complaint procedure codified at
Title 29, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 1614, Federal Sector Equal Employment Opportunity, current
edition. Specific additional exceptions to employees or matters covered are outlined in the implementing
instructions (AFI 36-1201, Discrimination Complaints [formerly AFR 40-1613]; AFI 36-1202,
Labor-Management Relations [formerly AFR 40-711]; and AFI 36-1203, Grievance Procedure [formerly
AFR 40-771]).

8. This policy implements Title 5, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 771, Agency Administrative Griev-
ance System, November 30, 1992; Title 29, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 1614; DoD 1400-25-M,
CPM 711, Installment 12, Labor-Management Relations, November 10, 1988; and DoD Directive
1426.1, Labor-Management Relations in the Department of Defense, November 10, 1988.

9. This policy interfaces with AFPD 36-7, Employee and Labor-Management Relations; AFI 36-1201;
AFI 36-1202; and AFI 36-1203.

10. See Attachment 1 for measuring compliance with this policy.

                          MEASURING COMPLIANCE WITH POLICY

A1.1. Compliance with dispute resolution policy will be assessed by measuring processing timeliness
and use of alternative dispute-resolution approaches such as mediation or settlement conferences. Each
base will do its own measuring, which will later be reviewed by quality assessment teams during their
periodic visits.

A1.2. Processing Timeliness. The policy of processing cases in a timely manner will be assessed as fol-
lows:
   A1.2.1. For grievances under the agency grievance procedure, bases will measure average overall
   processing time per case (Figure A1.1. ).
   A1.2.2. For discrimination complaints, bases will measure the average time per case from the filing
   of the formal complaint to the date of receipt by the Air Force Civilian Appellate Review Agency
   (AFCARA). Simultaneously, HQ USAF/DPCW will assess timeliness based on AFCARA com-
   plaint-tracking data (Figure A1.2.).
   A1.2.3. To assess compliance with the policy on using ADR approaches, bases will calculate, sepa-
   rately for complaints and grievances under the Air Force procedure, the percentages of cases where
   such ADR approaches were used as well as the percentages of cases resolved through ADR (Figure
   A1.3.).
