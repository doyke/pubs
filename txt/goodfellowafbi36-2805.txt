     Civilian of the Year Awards Program. Personnel on temporary duty (TDY) to 17 TRW units
     are NOT eligible to participate. 17 TRW and geographically separated units (GSU) compete
     as part of their assigned groups. Each joint service assigned to GAFB administers their own
     awards programs; however, their outstanding personnel will be recognized during the
     quarterly and annual recognition programs, and will compete in the Team Goodfellow
     Awards.
     1.2. Purpose of the Program. To recognize deserving personnel for appropriate award based
     on outstanding accomplishments during a specific award period.

     ceremonies and annual awards ceremonies. Attendance is mandatory for all nominees unless
     TDY, deployed, or assigned to a GSU and cannot attend. Attendance is encouraged for
     commanders, chiefs, first sergeants, supervisors, family members, and friends. The 17th
     Training Wing Command Chief (17 TRW/CCC) provides guidance for the 17th Training
     Wing Awards Program. The 17 TRW/CCC coordinates with 17th Training Wing Protocol
     (17 TRW/CCP) for award arrangements including script, emcees, procedures, and awards
     procurement/engraving.
        1.3.1. GOODFELLOWAFB Form 32, Certificate of Recognition, may be used in lieu of
        engraved plaques for all quarterly and annual awards winners.

     publicity.
     1.5. Civilians are considered supervisory if the Office of Personnel Management (OPM)
