SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This revision updates the Operations Plans Function with changes due to new electronic methods of
maintaining, tracking, and reviewing plans. It also attempts to restructure the plans process after the
elimination of guidance when the Wing XP function was dissolved. Currently Higher Headquarters
(HHQ) is working on guidance to re-establish the plans program. Paragraphs 2.2.5, 2.2.6, 2.2.7 were
deleted.
1. General. The Operations Plans office receives, evaluates, and maintains all tasking of the 919 SOW,
in conjunction with 919th Logistics Plans and Mobility (919 LRS/LGRR). Each Plan/Tasking received,
or correspondence received relevant to mission requirements will be reviewed by Plans (XP) to
determine the required actions to be taken. Tasking will be forwarded to the appropriate Unit Plans
Coordinator (UPC) and/or OPR to fulfill the mission, assigned tasks, or support required. Additionally,
all plans/Operational Orders (OPORDS) will be coordinated through XP, prior to starting and before

finalization, to ensure feasibility, proper format, security classification and proper Operations Security
(OPSEC)/Communications Security (COMSEC) procedures are adhered to.

       2.1.1. Maintain a copy of the directory of the 919 SOW IND 5, Index of 919th SOW Plans and
       Operations Orders, and a library of all plans/tasking pertinent to the 919 SOW.
       2.1.2. Conduct a feasibility/capability study for each war-plan/ Time Phased Force Deployment
       Document (TPFDD) tasking.

    that require the plan reviews expertise.
    2.3. Meet all HHQ and Host Base (96th Air Base Wing (96 ABW)) plans review inquiries and
    suspense’s.
3. Procedures.
    3.1. Briefings: Commanders, Key Staff Personnel, unit UPCs, and other pertinent OPRs of various
    plans are required to be briefed on all unit tasked plans annually. The 919 SOW/XP will send
    reviews for non-classified plans and plans that don’t require an annual exercise electronically; the
    read receipt will be verification of review. Classified plans, plans requiring special review, and
    plans which require the Battle Staff to be stood up will be briefed when deemed necessary at the
    convenience of the 919 SOW/CC.
    3.2. Upon receipt of a plan/tasking, 919 SOW/XP will brief the Wing Commander and key staff.
    3.3. For classified plans/tasking 919 SOW/XP will brief only the personnel that have a "need to

    information.
