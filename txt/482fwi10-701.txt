Combat Command Supplement 1(ACC), Operations Security (OPSEC). It applies to all 482 FW
personnel. Tenant units will comply in accordance with agreements between the tenant unit
commander and 482 FW. Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to
the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the Air Force Form 847 (AF Form 847),
Recommendation for Change of Publication; route AF Form 847 from the field through the
appropriate functional’s chain of command. Ensure that all records created as a result of
processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with (IAW) Air Force

1. The Goal of OPSEC. Identify critical unclassified information from the wing’s daily and
wartime operation which could give an adversary an advantage if exploited. Determine the
threat and the ways in which this information could be collected or exploited. Assess the level of
damage that would occur to wing operations if this information is successfully exploited and
assess the risk. If the risk level is not acceptable, find ways to prevent the adversary from
exploiting the information or deny them an advantage. OPSEC is an analytical tool which
should be used in planning and operation of all wing activities.
