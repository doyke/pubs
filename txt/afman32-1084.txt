This Manual supplements AFI 32-1024, Standard Facility Requirements. It provides guidance
for determining space allocations for Air Force facilities and may be used to program new
facilities or evaluate existing spaces. It provides facility space allowance guidance by category
code (CATCODE). These criteria are used in assigning occupancy of existing facilities and in
programming new facilities. This Manual is applicable to all active duty, civilian, Air Force
Reserve (AFR) personnel and units; particularly Air Force commanders and managers, who plan,
program, review, certify, and approve Air Force facilities. Civil Air Patrol may adopt this
guidance at the discretion of the applicable installation commander, per AFI 10-2701. This
Manual does not authorize the use of appropriated funds, nonappropriated funds, or private funds
for the construction or conversion of facilities. Refer recommended changes and questions about
this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF Form 847,
Recommendation for Change of Publication; route AF Forms 847 from the field through
appropriate functional chain of command. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes
prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with AFMAN 33-363, Management
of Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule
(RDS) located at https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm. The use of the name
or mark of any specific manufacturer, commercial product, commodity, or service in this
publication does not imply endorsement by the Air Force.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Revisions
include incorporating the list of Offices of Primary Responsibility (OPR) previously found in
AFI 32-1024, Standard Facility Requirements within this document and updating office
symbols. The Air Force Category Code designations have been replaced using the Real Property
Classification System (RPCS), and each facility-type is described using a new format. Where
applicable, office spaces have been realigned with rank-based standards. Space management
priorities have been cross-referenced with industry standards (e.g., OSCRE [Open Standards
Consortium for Real Estate] and BOMA [Building Owners and Managers Association]) for use
in future Asset Management databases. The standard facility requirements for most Air Force
missions have been updated, however, facility requirements for newer, unique or future weapon
systems are unknown or under development at the time of this document’s publication and
therefore not included in this revision. Contact the lead MAJCOM or OPR for standard facility
requirements not contained in this Manual.

                                         OVERVIEW

1.1. Description. This Manual is a tool to assist commanders, their management and technical
staff in programming the acquisition of facilities and in managing the inventory of real property
facilities. This Manual also aids all base personnel in correctly identifying classes of real
property and assigning correct category codes, ensuring that real property documentation is as
accurate as possible.
1.2. Application. This Manual applies to Air Force Active and Reserve facilities. The Air Force
Reserve Command Handbook (AFRCH) 32-1001, Standard Facility Requirements, supplements
space standards for Air Force Reserve facilities. The Air National Guard Handbook (ANGH) 32-
1084, ANG Standard Facility Requirements, defines space standards for Air National Guard
facilities. This Manual takes precedence over Air Force design guides for developing space
requirements for Air Force facilities.
   1.2.1. This Manual contains guidance for the type, number, and size of facilities to support
   Air Force and Air Force Reserve missions. The guidance contained in this Manual pertains to
   all Air Force facilities at military installations in the United States and, to the extent
   practicable, in other locations worldwide.
   1.2.2. This guidance shall be used as a baseline in the planning and design of construction
   projects: new facilities in the military construction (MILCON) program; minor construction
   projects; nonappropriated fund (NAF) projects; Sustainment, Restoration, and Modernization
   (SRM); and major alterations to existing facilities.
   1.2.3. Application to Existing Facilities. This Manual shall also be used as a baseline in
   determining the appropriate allocation of space within existing facilities. The configuration
   of existing spaces may preclude the exact application of the space standards contained in this
   document, but space planning should adhere as closely to this guidance as possible. All
   available existing space must be considered in establishing a space deficiency and a
   justification for programming action.
   1.2.4. Facilities Not Defined. Standard facility requirements have not been determined for
   some facility types. In those cases, project programming or space allocations must be
   accomplished based on requirements analysis, input from the facility type OPRs identified in
   Attachment 2, Table A2.2 of this Manual, and justification through established project
   approval procedures. As requirements are established, they will be added to this Manual.
   1.2.5. Adding New Facilities to and/or Updating the Manual. AFI 32-1024 addresses the
   procedures for adding new facilities and for updating facilities already included in this
   Manual.
   1.2.6. Approved Weapons Systems Requirements Plans. Unique facility requirements as
   approved in Weapons Systems Requirements Plans will be followed. Discrepancies between
   weapons systems criteria and this Manual should be resolved by the appropriate host
   command civil engineer (MAJCOM/A7).

1.3. Requirements.
   1.3.1. Mandatory Requirements. Although there is considerable flexibility in most of the
   guidance provided in this Manual, those sections identified as based on law, applicable
   Codes, Executive Orders, DoD Directives, Federal Regulations, Air Force Policy, and other
   governing standards must be treated accordingly and deviations must be approved by
   requests made through command channels.
   1.3.2. General Requirements. Facility requirements are developed under a wide variety of
   procedures and techniques. While the steps involved will vary with the nature of the facility
   requirement, there are basic criteria to consider for all design projects. This Manual contains
   criteria which serve as guidance in the planning and programming of high quality facilities
   that are durable, functional, sustainable, economical, safe, aesthetically pleasing, and have
   reasonable operating and maintenance costs. Space requirements in this Manual apply to all
   building and construction alternatives including permanent construction, semi-permanent
   construction, temporary construction, mobilization construction, relocatable buildings, leases,
   and portable buildings.
1.4. Limitations.
   1.4.1. Projects should not be approved or disapproved solely on the basis of this Manual.
   Improvement of existing facilities for the sole purpose of meeting this Manual shall not be
   undertaken. Existing facilities or existing situations which meet current criteria (prior to
   implementation of this Manual) should remain unchanged. All new requirements, and
   particularly those which exceed this guidance, must be fully explained and justified where
   directed herein, and in accordance with other applicable DoD and Service
   programming/budget directives to ensure understanding by the reviewing officials.
   1.4.2. Although this Manual may be used as a reference document for procurement activities
   such as contracting for professional design services and Green Procurement, it shall not be
   used as a reference document in military or federal specifications, for procurement of
   material, or in other similar procurement activities. Listing a facility in this Manual does not
   provide automatic justification for programming the facility or for including it on the base
   master plan.
1.5. How to Use the Manual.
   1.5.1. General Guidance. This Manual provides general guidance for developing facility
   requirements. Its companion document, AFI 32-1024, Standard Facility Requirements,
   describes the facility requirement system, assigns responsibilities, and explains how new and
   revised guidance criteria are initiated and processed for publication. Both this document and
   AFI 32-1024 emphasize the importance of anticipating mission requirements and taking
   timely actions to establish and revise guidance and criteria for facilities needed to fulfill
   mission objectives.
   1.5.2. Organization. This Manual is organized into chapters by broad category of facility.
   Within each chapter, each specific facility type is discussed in terms of general description,
   requirements determination, scope determination, dimensions, and design considerations.
   Where appropriate, tables are included for various size alternatives based on different
AFMAN32-1084 20 APRIL 2012                                                                        11


   weapon systems or different sized populations served. Technical details that might have
   significant impact on cost are included here, but technical guidance for design is not. Each
   facility type is organized by category code.
   1.5.3. Facility Type Descriptions. For each type of facility, the Facility Analysis Category
   (FAC), the Category Code (CATCODE), the office symbol of the Office of Primary
   Responsibility (OPR), and the Office of Collateral Responsibility (OCR) are listed. For
   example:

  FAC: 1234

  CATCODE: 123456

  OPR: AF/A7CPA

  OCR: MAJCOM/A7



  1.1.1. Description. A general description of the facility type is provided in this section.



  1.1.2. Requirements Determination. This section provides the basis for determining the
  functions of the facility and the major subcomponent spaces as they relate to the mission.
  See paragraph 1.5.4.



  1.1.3. Scope Determination. The scope section contains the data required to make the
  initial determination about the overall size of the facility.



  1.1.4. Dimensions. This section contains information about any specific dimensions which
  must be included. Often this section makes reference to a design guide.



  1.1.5. Design Considerations. The intent of this section is to point out any key cost drivers
  for the facility that would impact the programmed amount for new construction or
  renovation. It is not intended as a repository for the contents of a design guide.

   1.5.4. Requirements Determination. Facility requirements are developed under a wide
   variety of procedures and techniques. Use this Manual only as one step in determining
   facility requirements. Requirement determination is a process that:

       1.5.4.1. Establishes one OPR as the requesting organization for establishing the facility
       requirement.
       1.5.4.2. Acquires a full understanding of the proposed facility functions by a) analyzing
       the relationship of the functions to mission objectives, operational concepts, or other
       programs, b) acquiring detailed information from experts on published material and
       functions, c) initiating special research and investigation into any aspect of functions
       requiring clarification, and d) observing, if possible, actual operations comparable to the
       operations in question.
       1.5.4.3. Explores the possibility of combining or integrating the proposed facility
       requirements with other existing or proposed facility requirements.
       1.5.4.4. Translates functional requirements into design and planning criteria by
       investigating factors such as a) the number of personnel and types of organizations using
       the facility; b) time, workload, and scheduling requirements; c) environmental control
       requirements; d) effects of climate, site location, and master plan requirements; e) major
       equipment or material requirements; f) hazardous considerations; g) costs including both
       initial costs and operating and maintenance costs (e.g., life-cycle costs); h) criteria used
       by other governmental or civilian organizations for comparable facilities; i) accessibility
       for persons with disabilities; and j) compliance with the most current Air Force
       Sustainable Design and Development (SDD) and Antiterrorism/Force Protection (AT/FP)
       policies.
1.6. Facility Planning Considerations. The following is a partial list of considerations for
facility planning as they impact space requirements, and ultimately cost. For more information
on facility planning, refer to the Air Force Planner’s Handbook.
   1.6.1. Design Quality. The Air Force is committed to excellence in the design and
   development of its sites and buildings. For the Air Force, this means an integrated approach
   that achieves the highest quality of aesthetics in meeting the requirements of the building’s
   users and accomplishing the mission, while at the same time delivering a building that is cost
   effective to maintain throughout its useful life.
   1.6.2. Flexibility, Adaptability, and Expansion. Air Force buildings undergo many
   changes during their lifetime. As missions change and priorities change, Air Force
   departments are created, expanded, and abolished. As a consequence, requirements for space
   and services change frequently and space must be reconfigured often. The flexibility to
   accommodate continual change needs to be built in to the building design from the outset and
   respected in subsequent alterations.
   1.6.3. Sustainability and Energy Performance. Refer to paragraph 1.8 of this chapter for
   environmental policies and practices, paragraph 1.14 for site planning considerations, and
   paragraph 1.15 for installation planning considerations.
   1.6.4. Operations and Maintenance. Systems and materials should be selected on the basis
   of long-term operations and maintenance costs, as those costs will be significantly higher
   over time than first costs. The design of the facility operating systems should ensure ease and
   efficiency of operation and allow for cost effective maintenance and repair during the
   facility’s useful life.
AFMAN32-1084 20 APRIL 2012                                                                      13


  1.6.5. Life-Cycle Costing (LCC). LCC is an important economic analysis used in the
  selection of alternatives that impact both pending and future costs. It compares initial
  investment options and identifies the least costly alternatives over a twenty year period. LCC
  is mandated by law and is defined in 10 CFR, Part 437, Federal Energy Management and
  Planning Programs. The Air Force OPR for LCC is the Air Force Civil Engineer Support
  Agency (AFCESA).
  1.6.6. Historic Buildings. To the extent feasible, the Air Force seeks to achieve the
  rehabilitation of historic structures through repair, alterations, and additions while preserving
  those portions or features which convey its historical, cultural, or architectural values. The
  Air Force OPR for Historical Buildings is the Air Force Center for Engineering and the
  Environment (AFCEE)/Technical Support, Built Infrastructure Division (TDB).
  1.6.7. Accessibility. Persons with disabilities are entitled to use many facilities on military
  installations. It is DoD and Air Force policy to make buildings accessible to persons with
  disabilities unless the building is to be used only by able-bodied military personnel.
  Accessibility guidance has been clarified in an OSD policy letter dated October 31, 2008
  adopting the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, with amendments, as it applies to DoD
  facilities. The Air Force OPR for accessibility is AFCEE/TDB. A copy of the policy letter
  can be obtained through the AFCEE/TDB office or on their website at www.afcee.af.mil.
  1.6.8. Telecommunications Infrastructure. A total integration of all building systems will
  provide for current operations as well as for future changes. A technology infrastructure
  should be planned in each building to accommodate power systems including normal;
  emergency and uninterrupted power; mechanical systems and controls; fire detection and
  suppression systems; security systems; video and television systems; communications
  systems, including voice and data; lighting controls; plumbing services; and special utility
  services, such as gas or exhaust systems. The intent is not to provide infinite amounts of
  space for these systems, but to recognize their dimensional characteristics and the ability to
  service system components. The infrastructure must provide adequate spare capacity and
  integrate the utility entrance facilities, equipment rooms, backbone pathways, horizontal
  distribution pathways, and workstation outlets for each system. In part, floor-to-floor heights
  are determined by the depth of space required for the technology infrastructure, including
  structural, mechanical, electrical, and communications systems. Size telecommunications
  closets per Telecommunications Industry Association/Electronics Industries Alliance
  (TIA/EIA) 569-A-5, Commercial Building Standards for Telecommunications Pathways and
  Spaces, Table 7.2-1. Also see UFC 3-580-01, Telecommunications Building Cabling Systems
  Planning and Design.
  1.6.9. Security/Facility Hardening/Antiterrorism/Force Protection. Designing and
  constructing safe and secure cost effective buildings has always been one of the Air Force’s
  primary goals. Each building system and element should support risk mitigation and reduce
  casualties, property damage, and the loss of critical functions. Designs should include the
  ability to increase security in response to a heightened threat, as well as reduce security if
  changes in risk warrant it. Space for facilities requiring additional hardening and
  antiterrorism measures are captured in the Net-to-Gross multiplier (see paragraph 1.10.3).
  Consult UFC 3-340-01, Design and Analysis of Hardened Structures to Conventional
  Weapons Effects for facility hardening space requirements, and UFC 4-010-01, DoD
 14                                                             AFMAN32-1084 20 APRIL 2012


   Minimum Antiterrorism Standards for Buildings and UFC 4-010-02, DoD Minimum Standoff
   Distances for Buildings for antiterrorism space requirements.
   1.6.10. Fire Protection Space. Space for fire protection is captured in the Net-to-Gross
   multiplier (see paragraph 1.10.3). Complete automatic sprinkler protection must be
   provided in all new and renovated DOD facilities. All new and renovated facilities must
   comply with the requirements of the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 101, Life
   Safety Code. See UFC 3-600-01, Fire Protection Engineering for Facilities.
1.7. National Codes and Standards. The Air Force requires that each building constructed or
altered by the Air Force shall, to the maximum extent feasible, be in compliance with nationally
recognized model building codes and with other state and local codes. The technical
requirements of these nationally recognized codes will supplement other Air Force requirements
mandated by federal laws and executive orders, as well as other criteria noted within this
document that has been established to meet mission needs and their unique requirements. Refer
to UFC 1-200-01, General Building Requirements.
1.8. Environmental Policies and Practices. The Air Force is committed to incorporating
principles of sustainable design and energy efficiency into all of its building projects. Sustainable
design seeks to locate, design, construct, and operate buildings to reduce negative impact on the
environment and the consumption of natural resources. Sustainable design improves building
performance while keeping in mind the health and comfort of building occupants. It is an
integrated, synergistic approach, in which all phases of the facility lifecycle are considered. The
result is an optimal balance of cost, environmental, societal, and human benefits while meeting
the mission and function of the intended facility or infrastructure.
   1.8.1. Requirements. Refer to SDD Guidance available through AFCEE/TDB and UFC 4-
   030-01, Sustainable Development for the most current policies and regulations.
   1.8.2. Sustainable Development Defined. Sustainable Development means to plan,
   program, site, design, construct, renovate, operate, maintain, deconstruct, and remove
   facilities in ways that efficiently use energy, water, and materials; improve and protect built
   and natural environments; and provide long-term benefits for occupant health, productivity,
   and comfort. Sustainable Development is also known by such terms as ―green‖, ―high
   performance‖, or ―environmentally friendly.‖
   1.8.3. Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Certification. Current
   Air Force SDD policy supports the principles of LEED and requires all new MILCON
   projects be designed and built to achieve LEED Silver, with a percentage set aside for actual
   LEED Certification. LEED is a third-party certification program developed by the United
   States Green Building Council (USGBC) and is a nationally accepted benchmark for the
   design, construction, and operation of high performance green buildings. LEED focuses on
   sustainable sites, water efficiency, energy and atmosphere, materials and resources, and
   indoor environmental quality. See the latest Air Force SDD policy for current guidance.
   1.8.4. Protect and Conserve Water. Current executive orders as well as the Energy
   Independence and Security Act require agencies to reduce water consumption. Each Air
   Force facility shall base water management plans for new MILCON projects on FEMP
   guidance. Among these, the key strategies are reducing potable water consumption and
   minimizing the impact of wastewater systems.
AFMAN32-1084 20 APRIL 2012                                                                        15


   1.8.5. Compliance with the National Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA). NEPA
   is a prime driver in the Air Force planning process and is formalized in the Environmental
   Impact Analysis Process (EIAP). NEPA requires federal agencies to address environmental
   values in their decision-making processes by considering the environmental impacts of their
   proposed actions and weighing reasonable alternatives to those actions. To comply with this
   requirement, the Air Force must prepare an Environmental Assessment (EA) or
   Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for projects that may have significant effects on the
   environment. Responsibilities are outlined in AFI 32-1024, para. 2.4.
   1.8.6. Exceptions. The application of some United States (US) or Continental United States
   (CONUS) environmental policies is not applicable in all situations. In such instances, consult
   the Overseas Environmental Baseline Guidance Document and Final Governing Standards
   (OEBGD/FGS) for guidance in overseas locations not covered by US or CONUS
   environmental policies.
1.9. Definitions.
   1.9.1. Net Organizational Space. Net Organizational Space is a term defined as space used
   by occupying organizations in a facility that includes office spaces, administrative support
   areas, organizational special purpose spaces, and accompanying circulation space. Structural
   elements, openings for vertical cables, and vertical penetrations built for private use of the
   organization for new facilities are captured in the multipliers, and included in the
   measurement for existing buildings.
   1.9.2. Special Purpose Space. Special Purpose Space is defined as space which may be
   required to meet specific or special organizational functional needs. Special Purpose Space in
   Administrative Facilities/Areas is described in Chapter 6.
   1.9.3. Net Building Area. The Net Building Area is the total of all Net Organizational
   Spaces plus all the shared Special Purpose Spaces used by all organizations.
   1.9.4. Usable vs. Net. For the purposes of this Manual, these terms are often used
   interchangeably and should not be confused to mean separate space definitions. Net
   Organizational Space for one organization is the same thing as the Total Usable Space for
   that organization.
   1.9.5. Major Vertical Penetrations. Major vertical penetrations include stairs, elevator
   shafts, flues, pipe shafts, vertical ducts, and the like. Also included are atria, lightwells, and
   similar penetrations above the finished floor. Structural columns, openings for vertical
   electrical cable or telephone distribution, and openings for plumbing lines are not considered
   major vertical penetrations.
   1.9.6. Common Areas. Common areas are those areas that are available to all occupants
   (organizations) such as washrooms, janitorial closets, electrical rooms, telephone rooms,
   mechanical rooms, elevator lobbies, and public corridors. This will vary based on the
   configuration of each floor. Common areas are used to figure both Usable and Rentable
   Space. BOMA refers to this as Core Building Services.
   1.9.7. Gross Building Area. Gross building area, or constructed area, is the total
   constructed area of a building. It is measured to the outside finished surface of permanent
 16                                                           AFMAN32-1084 20 APRIL 2012


   outer building walls, without any deductions. Non-enclosed roof areas are counted at 0.5 (See
   Table 1.2).
      1.9.7.1. Calculate the following spaces as full area: basements, above grade floors,
      mezzanines; service and equipment rooms; boiler plant and heater rooms; penthouses;
      enclosed passages, walks, porches, balconies, stairs and loading facilities; and raised and
      covered loading platforms.
      1.9.7.2. Calculate the following spaces as half area: covered (but not enclosed)
      walkways, ramps, porches and balconies; covered and uncovered open stairs; uncovered
      raised loading platforms; covered ground level and covered/uncovered below grade
      loading facilities.
      1.9.7.3. Exclude the following spaces: roof overhangs, utility tunnels, exterior uncovered
      walks, ramps, and paved terraces; and enclosed crawl and utility spaces with an average
      ceiling height of less than 2.1 m (7 ft) that are not considered half scope.
   1.9.8. Rentable Space. Rentable Space is typically a figure used to assess a tenant’s space
   charges. For simplified programming purposes, Rentable Space is figured by adding 5% to
   the Net Building Space, or total Usable Space. For definitive measurement, it includes
   Usable Space in addition to a prorated share of common and circulation areas. Rentable
   Space does not include major vertical penetrations and exterior walls. See BOMA Z65.1 for
   measurement guidance for Rentable Space. NOTE: The Air Force in 2009 adopted the
   BOMA net usable square feet (NUSF) protocol for all space designed and built under the
   '610' classification. This NUSF is now required on all drawings and records and is being
   retroactively calculated for all CONUS facilities with administrative space.
1.10. Space Allowances and Multipliers.
   1.10.1. General. Space allowances for some of the facilities mentioned in this Manual are
   established by DoD. For all other facilities, the sizes and scopes are guidance and may be
   exceeded as detailed below:
      1.10.1.1. Exceeding Allowances. AFI 32-9002, Use of Real Property Facilities,
      provides guidance to the MAJCOMs on exceeding allowances. When the Air Force Civil
      Engineer (AF/A7C) approval is required per the 32-series policy directives, the approval
      request must fully explain and document the need to exceed published allowances. When
      the projects or actions do not require AF/A7C approval, increases beyond the scopes
      shown may be made when approved by the MAJCOM Civil Engineer.
   1.10.2. Circulation Multipliers. Although typically used in administration buildings, other
   facilities may also require additional space for circulation. A multiplier of up to 10% may be
   added to authorized net Facility Specific Special Purpose Spaces for circulation (see Table
   1.1). For programming administrative facilities/areas, see Chapter 6.
   1.10.3. Net-to-Gross Multiplier. Regardless of facility type, the initial programming of a
   facility involves adding the sum of required net space and converting it to a gross area for the
   purposes of estimating project cost. A maximum Net-to-Gross multiplier of 25% should be
   added to Net Building Area to reach the gross building area. This ―Net-to-Gross multiplier‖
   captures the following space: sustainability features, mechanical and electrical space, anti-
   terrorism/force protection, fire protection, circulation, and unusual construction. Overages in
AFMAN32-1084 20 APRIL 2012                                                                   17


   allowable Gross Building Area Totals that occur due to additional space needed for one or
   more of those captured in the Net-to-Gross multiplier shall be justified on DD Form 1391,
   FY____ Military Construction Project Data.
1.11. Space Programming. Programming is the research and decision-making process that
identifies the scope of work to be designed. The programming of space for renovation or a new
facility uses the space allocations in this Manual and specific guidance from applicable OPRs,
where necessary, along with various multipliers (defined above) to determine the Gross Building
Area. The Gross Building Area may then be used as an aid in establishing budgets and overall
pricing. See UFC 3-701-09, DoD Facilities Pricing Guide.
   1.11.1. Space Programming for Administration Facilities. Programming guidance for
   administration facilities is covered in Chapter 6 and UFC 4-610-01 Administration
   Facilities.
   1.11.2. Space Programming for Facilities other than Administration. Table 1.1 is
   provided to aid in programming a new facility or to renovate existing construction for a
   facility whose primary purpose is other than administration. It is meant as a guide and may
   not be all inclusive. The programmer should research other approved tools that may exist for
   space planning.
       1.11.2.1. Non-administrative facilities may include office, special purpose, and assembly
       spaces. See Chapter 6 of this Manual for allowances on these spaces.

1.12. Space Management. The Air Force has adopted industry standard models for the
purposes of measuring and managing space. Although the programmer may not be required to
use these models when programming a new facility, he or she may be required to use these
standards when documenting existing space for potential renovation or for accurately
documenting existing space for inclusion in the Air Force real property inventory.
   1.12.1. Measurement. To ensure an accurate, consistent inventory of Air Force space, the
   methods and standards by which those spaces are measured must be consistent. For this
   purpose, the Air Force has adopted the BOMA Z65.1 standard for measurement of new and
   existing space. The BOMA standard is a method by which space is measured and tabulated.
   It includes definitions such as Gross Building Area, Rentable Area, and Usable Area. It also
   contains detailed instructions on how to perform the actual measurements for various
   building types. The OPR for BOMA is AFCEE/TDB.
   1.12.2. Classification. To ensure an accurate, consistent inventory of Air Force space, the
   methods and standards by which those spaces are classified must be consistent. For this
   purpose, the Air Force has adopted the OSCRE (Open Standards Consortium for Real Estate)
   standard for classifying and managing its inventory of new and existing space. Classification
   of space is normally used to determine, and ultimately categorize, available space in an
   existing facility. It may also be done after programming a new facility, or when renovating
   an existing one, for the purposes of adding that new space to the total inventory. The OPR for
   OSCRE is AFCEE/TDB.
   1.12.3. BOMA/OSCRE Relationship. The BOMA and OSCRE standards are
   interdependent. Simply put, BOMA measures the space that OSCRE classifies into detailed,
   manageable ―Levels.‖ The OSCRE levels start with general space types and become more
   specific. Refer to Table 1.2 for an example.

Table 1.2. BOMA/OSCRE Relationships Example (Level 1 only).
             Gross Building Area=Usable + 25% or Rentable + 20%

                           Rentable=Usable + prorated space or 5%

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Spaces
1.13. Determining Space Requirements.
   1.13.1. Space Requirements based on Military Strength. Unless otherwise noted, the
   space requirements shown throughout this Manual are based upon the documented projected
   military strength or the base population of the installation at the anticipated time of project
   completion or beyond. Short duration spikes in military strength or base population should
   not be used as the basis for justifying larger facilities than is reasonable for the long-term,
   steady-state population.
                           1.13.1.1. Military Strength includes permanent party, supporting agencies, and transients
                           as described below. Military strength in this usage applies to those who are to be served
                           by the facility, which may include personnel of other Services.
                                 1.13.1.1.1. When the installation regularly serves a substantial number of military
                                 transients (such as technicians, trainees, or students), the average daily strength, based
                                 on a firm projection of the total yearly load of such transients, may be added to the
                                 projected military strength of the installation.
                                 1.13.1.1.2. Judgment is called for in instances where transients impact the facility
                                 size; transient population should not be used simply to justify more space than is
                                 reasonable.
                                 1.13.1.1.3. When the transient load is clearly seasonal rather than continuous year
                                 round, the average daily strength will be based on a firm projection of the total
                                 seasonal load.
                           1.13.1.2. When a number of installations or concentrations of military personnel are
                           located close to one another, such as in a metropolitan area, the total number of facilities
                           provided in the area will be related to, and governed by, the aggregate military strength in
                           that area.
   1.13.2. Space Requirements based on Base Population. Base populations as they apply to
   some of the facilities in this Manual are varied and complex. Facilities that depend on base
   populations for space allocation will need to be determined on a case by case basis.
1.14. Site Planning Considerations.
   1.14.1. Site Analysis. A complete site survey is required for all new construction projects
   and for alterations that involve work outside the existing building lines.
20                                                           AFMAN32-1084 20 APRIL 2012


     1.14.1.1. All construction projects on air bases shall refer to UFC 3-260-01, Airfield and
     Heliport Planning and Design, and Title 14 CFR Part 77, Objects affecting the Navigable
     Airspace, to determine design requirements, height limitations, and permit/approval
     requirements. UFC 3-260-1 must be used for describing and projecting potential
     violations of imaginary surfaces.
     1.14.1.2. To address aircraft safety (BASH, visual obscurants and noise issues related to
     land development around airfields), the Air Force developed the AICUZ program. The
     purpose of the AICUZ program is to promote land use and development patterns, both on
     and off base, that are compatible with airfield operations. Refer to AFI 32-7063, Air
     Installation Compatible Use Zone Program; AFH 32-7084, AICUZ Program Manager’s
     Guide; Title 14 CFR Part 77, Objects Affecting the Navigable Airspace; and AFPAM 91-
     212, Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) Management Techniques.
  1.14.2. Existing site Features and Vegetation. Existing natural features on the site should
  generally be preserved and used as a starting point for the overall site design. Efforts should
  be made to preserve existing vegetation, particularly healthy trees and plant specimens. The
  Air Force promotes the protection and integration of existing vegetation and natural terrain
  into site design. See UFC 3-201-02, Landscape Architecture.
  1.14.3. Optimize Energy Use. Current executive orders as well as the Energy
  Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA2007) require agencies to install cost-effective
  energy conservation measures in their facilities. The key strategies are conserving energy,
  encouraging the use of non-grid source energy, and protecting the atmosphere.
  1.14.4. Energy Conservation. The use of site design to aid energy conservation and
  sustainability is encouraged. Solar orientation of the building and well-placed plant material
  can be used to increase heat gain in the winter and reduce heat gain during the summer.
  1.14.5. Sustainable Site Planning. The Air Force promotes practices that are
  environmentally beneficial and conserve resources. Design and construction strategies should
  reduce stormwater runoff and polluted site water runoff. To the maximum extent feasible, all
  Air Force MILCON projects shall incorporate the features of Low Impact Development
  (LID). Refer to UFC 3-210-10, Low Impact Development.
  1.14.6. Utilities. Consideration should be given to the size and placement of major utilities
  that will be inside, attached to, or near (on-site) any Air Force MILCON projects.
  1.14.7. Site Security. Air Force facilities must be safe and secure, yet still be accessible,
  welcoming, and effective workplaces. Security countermeasures shall be customized in each
  case, based on established principles, criteria, risk analysis, and site conditions. Refer to
  UFC 4-010-01.
  1.14.8. Site Circulation. Site circulation design for Air Force projects will vary greatly
  depending on the context, which can range from tight urban sites to suburban campuses or
  isolated rural settings. However, the basic criteria remain the same in all situations: Site
  design should consider pedestrian access, vehicular access (including parking), fire apparatus
  access, and service vehicle access. See also UFC 3-210-02, POV Site Circulation and
  Parking.
AFMAN32-1084 20 APRIL 2012                                                                    21


1.15. Installation Planning Considerations. Integration of the facility into the base general
plan should be accomplished and may have an impact on supporting utilities or other cost factors
of the facility. Refer to AFI 32-7062, Air Force Comprehensive Planning, AFPAM 32-1010,
Land Use Planning, Area Development Planning Bulletin, and the Planners Handbook for
additional guidance.
1.16. Energy Policies and Practices
   1.16.1. Responsibilities. Refer to AFPD 90-17, Energy Management, and AFI 90-1701,
   Energy Management, for current policies and guidance.
       1.16.1.1. In accordance with AFI 90-1701 para 1.2.13.6.2, AF/A7C ensures AFIs written
       within their area of responsibility are consistent with Air Force energy goals and
       objectives.
   1.16.2. Optimize Energy Use. Current Executive Orders, the Energy Policy Act of 2005
   (EPAct 2005), and EISA 2007 require agencies to install cost-efficient energy conservation
   measures in their facilities. The key strategies are conserving energy, encouraging the use of
   non-grid source energy and protecting the atmosphere.
1.17. Energy Management. MAJCOMs, ANG, and DRUs must take energy management
responsibilities and activities into consideration when exercising custody and control over real
property. See AFPD 90-17, Energy Management, and AFI 90-1701, Energy Management, for
requirements and details.
   1.17.1. Considerations include, but are not limited to, energy standard compliance for newly
   purchased appliances, energy audit findings, green house gas monitoring, SAF/IEE review
   and approval requirement for waivers to standards, and general infrastructure energy program
   management requirements.
1.18. Energy and Water Evaluations.
   1.18.1. Audits. Per AFPD 90-17 and AFI 90-1701, energy managers shall complete, for
   each calendar year, a comprehensive energy and water evaluation for approximately 25
   percent of the facilities of each agency in a manner that ensures that an evaluation of each
   such facility is completed at least once every four years.
1.19. Energy Security. MAJCOMs, ANG, and DRUs will evaluate the energy security of all
their missions and bases in accordance with AFPD 90-17.

                  FACILITY CLASS 1, OPERATION AND TRAINING

2.1. Category Group 11, Airfield Pavements.
   2.1.1. Overview.
      2.1.1.1. General Description. The Airfield is the portion of the base used for airfield
      operations, i.e., take offs, landings, servicing, parking, etc. The designation of airfield
      pavements applies to runways, taxiways, aprons, pads, paved shoulders, and paved
      overruns; it is a paved surface designed for the landing and take-off of fixed-wing aircraft
      that can also accommodate rotary-wing aircraft. The surface is usually concrete or
      asphalt. Runway lighting is not included here, but is captured under Category Group 13,
      Communications, Navigation Aids and Airfield Lighting. Additional information is
      provided in AFI 32-1042, Standards for Marking Airfields, for standards for marking
      airfield pavements and obstructions; AFI 32-1044, Visual Air Navigation Systems for
      lighted signs required for runways, taxiways, and aprons; and ETL 04-2, Standard
      Airfield Pavement Marking Schemes on dimensions, colors, and layout details for
      standard airfield pavement marking schemes.
      2.1.1.2. Environmental Considerations. When planning airfield pavements, consider
      stormwater runoff and control of pollutants being discharged into stormwater to maintain
      compliance with the stormwater and discharge permit requirements, including deicing
      operations. Comply with requirements under 33 USC § 1251 - 1387, Clean Water Act
      (CWA), AFI 32-7041, Water Quality Compliance, and federal, state, and local
      stormwater permit requirements.
      2.1.1.3. Explosives Safety Considerations. When planning aircraft support facilities
      where personnel or explosives are involved, ensure explosives safety standards (DoD
      6055.9-Std, DoD Ammunition and Explosives Safety Standards and AFMAN 91-201,
      Explosives Safety Standards) are considered. These standards are designed to protect
      facilities and personnel from the damaging effects of explosions involving munitions and
      explosives.
      2.1.1.4. Pavement Thickness Requirements. Pavement design criteria and standards
      are discussed in detail in UFC 3-260-02, Pavement Design for Airfields. Airfield
      pavements have six design types based on mission and aircraft load criteria defined as
      light, medium, heavy, modified heavy, auxiliary, and assault landing zone. Airfield
      pavements are further grouped into four traffic areas based on operational use defined as
      Types A, B, C, and D. Refer to Chapter 3 and Figures 3-1, 3-2, and 3-3 of UFC 3-260-02
      for further discussion of airfield pavements and traffic areas. Additional design criteria
      are contained in UFC 3-260-01, Airfield and Heliport Planning and Design and ETL 09-
      1, Airfield Planning and Design Criteria for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), for
      dimensions, geometry, and pavement design.
AFMAN32-1084 20 APRIL 2012                                                                23



  2.1.2. Runways.
       FAC: 1111

       CATCODE: 111111

       OPR: AFCESA/CEO

       OCR: AF/A3O-A

     2.1.2.1. Description. The runway is the paved surface provided for normal aircraft
     landings and take offs. Runways are classified as either Class A or Class B based on the
     intended aircraft use per Table 3-1 of UFC 3-260-01. Relative characteristics of Class A
     and Class B runways are presented in Table 3-2 of UFC 3-260-01. For landing zone
     operations, a special paved or aggregate surface strip is provided (see Take off and
     Landing Zone [CATCODE 116116]). For normal helicopter operations, a square pad is
     provided (see Pad, Helicopter [CATCODE 116663]). In addition to the actual paving of
     the runway (CATCODE 111111), CATCODE 116663 includes grading and drainage of
     the runway, runway shoulders, lateral safety zones, and clear zone (see UFC 3-260-01
     and UFC 3-260-02). The following are descriptions for the types of runways:
        2.1.2.1.1. Primary Instrument. The primary runway is equipped with navigational
        aids (NAVAIDS) for restricted visibility operations. The primary runway is the
        runway oriented in the direction of maximum wind coverage. Terrain conditions or
        populated areas on the extended runway centerline may make minor deviations
        necessary.
        2.1.2.1.2. Crosswind. A runway oriented so that its centerline intersects the primary
        instrument runway at an angle greater than 15 degrees. Refer to UFC 3-260-01,
        paragraphs 3-4.3, 3-5, and 3-6 for further discussion.
        2.1.2.1.3. Instrument. A runway which has NAVAIDS, lighting, and markings for
        restricted visibility operations. The two basic types of instrument runways are
        precision instrument runways and non-precision instrument runways.
            2.1.2.1.3.1. Precision Instrument Runway. A precision instrument runway has
            an instrument landing system (ILS), microwave landing system (MLS), or
            precision approach radar (PAR) as NAVAIDS. These systems provide electronic
            glide slope information to the pilot.
            2.1.2.1.3.2. Non-Precision Instrument Runway. A non-precision instrument
            runway has a VOR (VHF Omnidirectional Range), VOR-DME (distance
            measuring equipment), TACAN (tactical air navigation), NDB (non-directional
            beacon), LOC (localizer), LOC-DME, LDA (localizer directional aid), or SDF
            (simplified direction facility) as NAVAIDS providing azimuth and range
            information only (no glide slope information). Refer to AFI 32-1044, AFI 32-
            1042, and ETL 04-2 for additional information on identifying runway lighting and
            marking requirements.
24                                                         AFMAN32-1084 20 APRIL 2012


        2.1.2.1.4. Alternate Combat Runway (ACR). An ACR is used to launch and
        recover aircraft while bomb-damaged main runways are under repair. The
        requirement for an ACR applies only to air bases in high threat areas without a
        secondary runway. An ACR can be used as a Minimum Operating Strip (MOS)
        during airfield damage repair operations with the following features:
            2.1.2.1.4.1. Lighting. Lighting may be provided by emergency or expedient
            lighting sets. See AFH 10-222 V7, Emergency Airfield Lighting Systems, for
            additional guidance.
            2.1.2.1.4.2. Arresting System. Arresting capability may be provided by mobile
            aircraft arresting system (MAAS). See Aircraft Arresting Systems (CATCODE
            116922). Permanent anchoring foundations may be installed.
     2.1.2.2. Requirements Determination. Most Air Force missions can safely operate
     with only one runway. New crosswind or parallel runways are authorized only under the
     conditions described below. These restrictions also apply to existing secondary runways;
     therefore, an existing secondary runway should not be widened, lengthened, or
     extensively rehabilitated or strengthened unless the retention of a secondary runway is
     essential to the mission.
     2.1.2.3. Scope Determination. Steps for determining runway requirements are:
        2.1.2.3.1. Step 1. Determine the basic runway requirement. Each Air Force
        installation assigned an aircraft flying mission is authorized a runway. Length, width,
        and other design parameters depend on the assigned aircraft; however, it should also
        support other operations. For rotorcraft runway requirements, reference UFC 3-260-
        01.
        2.1.2.3.2. Step 2. Determine the need for a crosswind runway. A crosswind runway
        may be considered when wind coverage on the primary runway is less than 90 percent
        or when the beam wind component on the primary runway is greater than 21 kph (11
        knots) during periods of restricted visibility. Wind coverage studies to determine
        runway orientation are addressed in Appendix B, section 4, of UFC 3-260-01. A
        crosswind runway must not be planned or programmed unless authorized by
        AF/A3O-A. Reference the methodology included in Federal Aviation Administration
        (FAA) Advisory Circular (AC) 150/5300-13, Airport Design, to determine the
        percentage of time and the extent of reduced visibility required when the beam wind
        component exceeds 21 kph (11 knots) before authorization for a crosswind runway
        may be requested.
        2.1.2.3.3. Step 3. Determine the need for a secondary runway based on air traffic
        volume. A secondary runway is a runway in addition to the primary instrument
        runway. A secondary runway may be parallel or crosswind. A second runway parallel
        to the primary runway may be required if aircraft operations exceed practical
        capacities. Follow the procedure below to determine whether traffic volume makes a
        secondary runway necessary:
            2.1.2.3.3.1. Traffic Mix. Determine the traffic mix (the percent of each type of
            aircraft) using the airfield by comparing flight data over the previous three years.
            Refer to FAA AC 150/5060-5, Airport Capacity and Delay). Table 2.1 indicates
AFMAN32-1084 20 APRIL 2012                                                                     25

             2.1.2.3.3.2. Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC). Determine the
             percent of time IMCs prevail at that location. IMCs are in effect when the ceiling
             is lower than 300 m (1,000 ft) or visibility is less than 4.8 km (3 mi).
             2.1.2.3.3.3. Instrument Flight Regulations (IFR) Percentages. Use air traffic
             data for the past three years to determine the percent of time aircraft operate under
             IFR conditions. Aircraft may operate under IFR conditions during clear weather
             to build pilot proficiency.
             2.1.2.3.3.4. Calculations. Use the more restrictive of paragraphs 2.1.2.3.3.2
             and 2.2.1.3.3.3 with the traffic mix percent of item paragraph 2.1.2.3.3.3 to
             determine the need for a secondary runway. A secondary runway is required when
             any of following situations exceed the parameters of Table 2.2:
                 2.1.2.3.3.4.1. The Practical Annual Capacity (PANCAP) is exceeded in any
                 two consecutive years.
                 2.1.2.3.3.4.2. The Practical Hourly Capacity (PHOCAP) is reached or
                 exceeded for at least 20 hours in one year as shown in Table 2.2.
                 2.1.2.3.3.4.3. Aircraft are delayed by five minutes during two adjacent,
                 normal, peak hours each week during a year.
             2.1.2.3.3.5. PHOCAP may reach 54 operations during visual meteorological
             conditions (VMC) weather conditions and 44 operations during IMC for the
 26                                                         AFMAN32-1084 20 APRIL 2012


             following traffic mix: 20 percent four engine jet and larger; 40 percent two and
             three engine jet, four engine piston and turboprop; 20 percent small jet and twin
             engine piston; and 20 percent light wing and single engine piston. PANCAP may
             reach 180,000 operations for a single runway for the same traffic mix. The factors
             involved in identifying capacities include aircraft mix, frequency of IFR
             operation, runway occupancy time, and air traffic separation.
         2.1.2.3.4. Advance Planning. Advance planning is required due to lead time
         requirements and the time required to develop supporting documentation. To project
         traffic loads three to five years in the future, use growth factors of five percent per
         year or the average air traffic growth of the individual air base over the past three
         years. Include proposed mission changes in the traffic projection. A detailed
         engineering analysis may be used to further justify the need for a secondary runway.
         2.1.2.3.5. Design Factors. Secondary runways may not require the same pavement
         load bearing capacity if there is a reasonable spread in aircraft mix. Landing aids are
         restricted to visual aids: Runway edge, threshold and endlighting precision approach
         path indicator (PAPI), and short approach lighting system (SALS). Since instrument
         landing aids are not authorized, the runway is authorized for visual use only if
         meteorological conditions and traffic volumes clearly show that a second instrument
         runway is mission-essential for the based aircraft. See AFI 32-1044 and UFC 3-535-
         01, Visual Air Navigation Systems, for further information.

         2.1.2.4. Runway Dimensions. Geometric criteria for runway pavements are specified in
         Table 32 of UFC 3-260-01.
             2.1.2.4.1. Runway Width. The authorized width of a runway depends on the aircraft
             programmed for the base. See Table 2.3 for authorized widths.
             2.1.2.4.2. Runway Length. Runway length shall be sufficient to accommodate all
             aircraft programmed for the base. Performance curves for each aircraft are in the
             performance data section of the "Dash One" series of the aircraft technical orders.
             Length is based on the take off or landing phase, whichever gives the greater length.
             The designer of the airfield runway shall coordinate with the respective
             MAJCOM/A3 to determine the most accurate and economical methods of
             determining the requirements for individual runway lengths based on the aircraft each
             base supports. See Table 2.4 for authorized runway lengths.
             2.1.2.4.3. Shoulders. Shoulders can be both paved and unpaved and are located on
             each side of the runway. See Table 2.5 for authorized shoulder widths.

                        1,067 m (3,500 ft), not including overruns. See UFC 3-260-01 and ETL
                        09-6 for length based on pressure altitude, Runway Condition Reading

   Alternate            The length of an ACR is 2,300 m (7,500 ft). The ACR facility is a paved
   Combat Runway        strip, 2,300 m (7,500 ft) long, with 91 m (300 ft) paved overruns on
   (ACR)                each end, and 11 m (36 ft) wide access taxiways. It may be
                        superimposed on a secondary runway, taxiway, or parking apron that
                        meets the desired criteria. There is no specific CATCODE assigned to
                        ACR facilities. Use the code which most closely relates to adjacent
                        pavement. For example, if the ACR is a separate runway, use
                        CATCODE 111111; or if it is superimposed on a taxiway, use
                        CATCODE 112211. Refer to UFC 3-260-01 for additional design
                        criteria.

   Helicopter Pad       Generally, a square pad is provided for normal helicopter take
                        off/landing operations. However, for specific types of operations or
                        extensive operations, a runway 490 m (1,600 ft) long may be authorized.

         2.1.3.1. Description. The runway overrun is an extension of the runway (excluding
         shoulders) to allow for the possibility of short landings and possible aircraft overruns.
         2.1.3.2. Requirements Determination. Overruns are provided for all runways. See
         CATCODE 111111.
         2.1.3.3. Scope Determination. See CATCODE 111111.
         2.1.3.4. Dimensions. See Table 2.6 for paved overrun dimensions, or Table 3-4 of UFC
         3-260-01.
         2.1.3.5. Design Considerations. Flexible pavements are generally satisfactory for paved
         portions of overruns or other areas not specifically required to have a rigid pavement
         surfacing. Flexible pavement is defined in Chapter 10 of UFC 3-260-02 and paragraph 3-
         10 of UFC 3-260-01. Paving requirements for overruns are provided in paragraph 8,
         Special Areas, in Chapter 10 of UFC 3-260-02.

      2.1.4.1. Description. Taxiways are the pavements provided for the ground movement of
      aircraft. Taxiways connect the parking and maintenance areas of the airfield with the
      runways and provide access to hangars, docks, and various parking aprons and pads.
      Taxiways are normally parallel to runways to facilitate aircraft ground movement on the
      taxiways during landings and take offs on the runway.
      2.1.4.2. Requirements Determination. Provided for all runways. (See CATCODE
      111111). Consult UFC 3-260-01 for widths, grades, configuration, and clearance
      distances and UFC 3-260-02 for pavement design requirements.
      2.1.4.3. Scope Determination. See CATCODE 11111.
      2.1.4.4. Dimensions. See Tables 2.7 and 2.8. Geometric criteria for taxiways are
      specified in Table 5-1 of UFC 3-260-01.
          2.1.4.4.1. Taxiway Width. Taxiway widths of 15.2 m (50 ft) and 22.9 m (75 ft) are
          standard for Class A and B runways, respectively, with exceptions noted in Table 2.7
          below.

   2. C-17 aircraft can execute ―star turns‖ which require forward and reverse taxi within
   27.5 m (90 ft). However, for normal 180-degree turn maneuvers, the C-17 turn radius is
   35 m (116 ft).

          2.1.4.4.2. Taxiway Shoulders. Taxiway shoulder widths of 7.5 m (25 ft) and 15.2 m
          (50 ft) are standard for Class A and B airfields, respectively, with exceptions noted in
          Table 2.8. Airfields supporting wide-bodied aircraft may require soil stabilization
          beneath outer engines.

         2.1.4.5. Design Considerations.
             2.1.4.5.1. Taxiway Pavement Strength. All taxiways are built of heavy-load,
             medium-load, light-load, landing zone-load, or ACR pavement, as specified in this
             chapter. The strength of pavement in segments of a taxiway system varies according
             to the requirements of the critical aircraft. For example, on a base supporting heavy
             bomber, cargo, and fighter aircraft, the principal taxiways are heavy-load pavement;
             at aircraft facilities restricted to cargo or fighter aircraft by their dimensions and
             location, taxiways are medium-load strength. Refer to UFC 3-260-02 for technical
             design criteria.
             2.1.4.5.2. Treatment of Shoulders. For Class A airfield taxiways, the entire 7.5 m
             (25 ft) shoulder width is paved. For Class B airfields, shoulders are paved depending
             on the intended use. For fighter and trainer aircraft, the first 3 m (10 ft) is paved. For
             cargo mission taxiways, the first 7.5 m (25 ft) is paved. For taxiways intended for B-
             52 operations or for C-5, E-4, and 747 aircraft where vegetation cannot be
             established, pave the full 15 m (50 ft).

         2.1.5.1. Description. Aprons are paved areas provided for aircraft parking, servicing,
         and loading. Apron space is required for operational aircraft; alert aircraft; transient
         aircraft; the loading and unloading of cargo aircraft; mission support aircraft (Base
         Flight); aircraft undergoing depot maintenance; and aircraft access to hangars, docks, and
         shelters.
         2.1.5.2. Requirements Determination. Aprons are individually designed to support
         specific aircraft and missions at a particular installation. The actual dimensions of an
         apron are based on the number of authorized aircraft, maneuvering space, and type of
         activity the apron serves. See Chapter 6 of UFC 3-260-01for further guidance.
             2.1.5.2.1. Cargo Loading. Air Mobility Command (AMC) aircraft are authorized an
             apron for terminal operations. Apron size is determined by the type of cargo aircraft
AFMAN32-1084 20 APRIL 2012                                                                  33


        involved, the volume of traffic, the nature of the loading and unloading operation, and
        associated equipment and facilities.
        2.1.5.2.2. Commercial Aircraft. Commercial aircraft operations under Air Force
        contract are provided an additional apron for terminal operations. Apron size is based
        on individual projects and missions but does not exceed the size required to operate
        ten large commercial aircraft.
        2.1.5.2.3. Hazardous Cargo. Aircraft carrying hazardous cargo do not use the
        apron. Separate facilities, such as Dangerous Cargo Pad (CATCODE 116662), serve
        this need.
        2.1.5.2.4. Mission Support Aircraft (Base Flight). All assigned mission support
        aircraft are provided apron space.
        2.1.5.2.5. Transient Aircraft. Transient aircraft such as courier aircraft, personnel
        airlifts, administrative flights, AMC aircraft, and en route aircraft delayed by bad
        weather are provided an apron. The apron is designed to accommodate the average
        daily number of transient aircraft requiring parking space. The average daily number
        is determined from base records from previous years. A maximum of 16,700 m 2
        (20,000 yd2) is permitted at new bases where the demand cannot be predicted.
     2.1.5.3. Scope Determination. A proper apron allowance is the amount required to
     afford maximum operational efficiency with a minimum amount of paving. The
     paragraphs below describe the basis for calculating apron allowances for various types of
     operations. Paragraph 2.1.5.3.4 describes a method for estimating apron requirements
     for broad planning purposes. High threat areas may require additional pavement to meet
     aircraft dispersal requirements.
        2.1.5.3.1. Access to Hangars, Docks, and Shelters. Apron configuration is
        influenced by the size of the door openings and by the dimensions and turning radius
        of the largest aircraft using the buildings. A mass apron or a taxiway configuration is
        used, depending on access requirements. To avoid building non-usable pavement,
        design for adequate wingtip clearances of any obstacles near the apron.
        2.1.5.3.2. Assigned Aircraft. Assigned aircraft will, at a minimum, consist of the
        Primary Assigned Aircraft (PAA) inventory established from the funded flying
        program for the base. Many bases will have other aircraft inventory that will require a
        parking apron. This inventory will vary by base and depot repair cycles. These
        aircraft may be annotated as backup inventory, ready reserve, or attrition reserve. The
        monthly average of these non-primary assigned aircraft remaining on station must be
        accounted for in determining apron requirements.
        2.1.5.3.3. Operational Aircraft. Operational aircraft are parked on mass aprons,
        strip aprons, or where authorized, on dispersed stubs. To determine how many
        operational aircraft require apron space, proceed as follows: Begin with 100 percent
        of the assigned aircraft as established by official documents (see exceptions in
        paragraph 2.1.5.3.3.3 for AMC aircraft); subtract the number of aircraft located on
        separate aprons, such as alert aircraft; subtract the number of aircraft located in
        maintenance hangars or docks under normal maintenance schedules; and finally,
        subtract aircraft that are parked elsewhere on existing paving of a suitable nature and

     location. Other factors affecting the size and configuration of aprons for operational
     aircraft follow:
        2.1.5.3.3.1. Aircraft Parking Arrangements. On a typical mass apron, aircraft
        are parked in rows and spaced according to the dimensions given in Tables 2.9,
        2.10, 2.11, and 2.13 (NOTE: Additional criteria can be found in Army ETL
        1110-3-394, Engineering and Design – Aircraft Characteristics for Airfield-
        Heliport Design and Evaluation, and in Chapter 6 of UFC 3-260-01). This
        spacing permits aircraft to move in and out of parking places under their own
        power. Parking arrangements should be studied carefully to achieve the parking
        layout that requires the least amount of pavement per parked aircraft. One
        example of the possibilities for economy is changing the parking arrangement on
        an apron for eight aircraft from four rows of two aircraft to two rows of four
        aircraft, resulting in reduced pavement requirements by 20 percent.
        2.1.5.3.3.2. Parking for Fighter Type Aircraft. Some aircraft are often parked
        at an angle. This is an efficient way to achieve adequate clearance to dissipate the
        temperature and velocity of jet blast to levels that will not endanger aircraft or
        personnel; that is, about 38°C (100°F) and 56 kph (35 mph). To achieve adequate
        dissipation of heat and blast, some aircraft require a wider lane than shown in
        Figure 2.1 (below). To achieve a safe lane width, obtain the minimum safe
        distance to the rear of a jet engine operating at 80 percent power from the
        appropriate aircraft technical order. If this distance exceeds 38.1 m (125 ft),
        minimize pavement requirements by parking aircraft so that two rows of aircraft
        blast into a common lane, with alternate lanes of minimum taxiway width. See
        paragraph 6-13 of UFC 3-260-01 and ETL 07-3, Jet Engine Thrust Standoff
        Requirements for Airfield Asphalt Pavements, for additional information on jet
        engine thrust standoff requirements.
        2.1.5.3.3.3. Parking for Air Mobility Command (AMC) Aircraft Tanker
        Aircraft. Parking for all large AMC Aircraft (e.g., C-17, KC-10, and like-size
        aircraft) requires apron parking spots for 75 percent of the difference between
        PAA and the number of covered maintenance spaces. CONUS parking spots
        should be sized for the AMC Generic Aircraft (e.g., C-17 Wing Span, KC-10
        Length, KC-10 Height). This provision specifically does not apply to C-5 and
        C130 aircraft. This provision does not limit authorization for additional apron
        parking required to support transient, back-up inventory, or other mission-needs
        as described above. The load-bearing pavement extends 11.4m (37.5 ft) beyond
        the centerline of the aircraft (the same as the peripheral taxiway). Any pavement
        beyond is shoulder pavement.
     2.1.5.3.4. Estimating New Apron Requirements. For broad planning purposes, use
     the following method to estimate new apron requirements. Multiply the wingspan of
     the selected aircraft by its length. Multiply the product by a factor of 5.3 (use a factor
     of 4.4 for fighter type aircraft). EXAMPLE: To estimate apron requirements for ten
     (10) C-17 aircraft, multiply 51.8 m x 52.7 m x 10 aircraft x 5.3 factor = 145,000 m2 of
     apron needed. This is a planning tool for sizing new aprons only and should not be
     used to estimate the number of aircraft (specifically, large aircraft) that can park on an
     existing apron. Many variables such as length, width, and taxi lane locations
AFMAN32-1084 20 APRIL 2012                                                                    35


        determine an existing apron's suitability to support specific aircraft types. At existing
        bases, develop a conceptual aircraft parking plan to determine the apron square meter
        requirements.
 36                                                               AFMAN32-1084 20 APRIL 2012



         2.1.5.4. Dimensions.
               2.1.5.4.1. Parking Dimensions. Table 2.9 presents the minimum geometric criteria
               for fixed-wing apron design. When designing new aprons for AMC bases hosting C-
               5, C-17, KC-10, and KC-135 aircraft, provide 15.3 m (50 ft) of wingtip separation.
               EXCEPTION: When you are rehabilitating an existing apron, provide the maximum
               wingtip separation the existing apron size will allow (up to 15.3 m [50 ft] but not less
               than 7.7 m [25 ft]). This additional separation is both desirable and permitted.
               2.1.5.4.2. At non-AMC bases, the maximum separation which can reasonably be
               provided for these aircraft is desirable. At a minimum, these separations must always
               meet current aircraft Technical Order (TO) requirements.

  wingspan of aircraft that frequently uses the taxiway. Example: If E-4s taxi past a ramp of
  KC-10, taxilane should be based on the wingspan of the E-4.

  3. See paragraph 2.1.6.4.5.3.

  4. Tankers require a 15.2 m (50 ft) separation from wingtip to wingtip to accommodate
  fuel load change requirements. (See paragraph 2.1.5.4)

  5. For aircraft not listed, the minimum wingtip clearance is 3 - 7.7 m (10 - 25 ft) for
  wingspans < 33.5 m (110 ft) and 7.7 - 15.3m (25 - 50 ft) for wingspans 33.5 m (110 ft) or
  more.

  6. The criteria within Table 2.10 do not apply during contingencies. In these cases, refer
  to the current aircraft Technical Order. In locations where the mix of aircraft changes
  during contingencies, consider the use of universal aircraft servicing pit locations to

      1. Another factor requiring evaluation when developing aircraft parking plans is aircraft
      exhaust wake velocity. Check the particular aircraft performance guide for wind velocity
      and temperature ranges to assess safe distances for nearby aircraft facilities.

      2. For transient aircraft, the minimum clearance is 7.6 m (25 ft).

          2.1.5.4.3. Taxi Lanes. Interior and peripheral taxi lanes must exceed the required
          width for aircraft parked in the area if larger aircraft must taxi through en route to
          docks, hangars, or pads. Confine this width variation to the fewest taxi lanes possible.
          2.1.5.4.4. Peripheral Taxi Lanes. Taxi lanes are not provided along the rear edge of
          aprons unless required for access to docks or hangars or to meet a critical need for
          alternate circulation routes for aircraft operating on the apron. On peripheral taxi
          lanes where the apron is designed for aircraft with wingspans up to 33.5 m (110 ft),
          the aircraft are expected to taxi along the outer 15.24 m (50 ft) of pavement. Where
          the apron is designed for aircraft with wingspans of 33.5 m (110 ft) or more, the
          peripheral taxi lane is the outer 22.9 m (75 ft) of pavement. Therefore, wing overhang
          areas beyond the paved shoulder are not normally paved, but they may require
          stabilization to prevent damage from jet blast.
          2.1.5.4.5. Air Combat Command (ACC) Alert Area Parking Criteria. Alert Pad
          Apron layout criteria are provided in paragraph 6-13 of UFC 3-260-01. The
          established, day-to-day, ACC alert parking areas must conform to the standards stated
          below as well as those outlined in Table 2.12, which shows the distance from the
          nose or wingtip of the parked aircraft to the centerline of the egress taxiway,
          measured perpendicular to the taxiway centerline.
              2.1.5.4.5.1. Nose or wingtip to centerline criteria are based on the largest aircraft
              taxied along the egress taxiway regardless of the type of aircraft being parked.
              2.1.5.4.5.2. Desired distances are reduced, as required, down to, but not below,
              the specified minimum when space is limited due to a lack of ramp area.
              2.1.5.4.5.3. The wingtip clearance between parked alert aircraft is 15.2 m (50 ft).

                 Distances are measured along a line perpendicular to the aircraft centerline to
                 provide a 15.2 m (50 ft) wingtip passing clearance when aircraft exit the parking
                 spot.

      NOTES:

      1. See paragraph 2.1.5.3.3.2 for additional criteria.

      2. See Table 2.11 for Dimensions C and D.

      3. Find dimensions W and L as follows:

        W = D*(NW -1) + C

        L = C*(NL - 1) + IT

        Where:
AFMAN32-1084 20 APRIL 2012                                                                    41


      W = Width of operational parking apron.

      L = Length of operational parking apron.

      C = Block dimension of aircraft.

      D = 1.414 (wingspan + 3.1 m (10 ft)).

      NW = Number of aircraft per row in width of apron.

      NL = Number of aircraft per row in length of apron.

      IT = 27.4 m (90 ft) or wingspan plus 12.2 m (40 ft) if greater than 27.4 m (90 ft).
      (Also consider safe distance for jet blast which may be a greater distance.)

   4. Aircraft with forward-firing munitions should be reviewed as to safety concerns and
   a Commander's Risk Assessment performed according to AFMAN 91-201.

   5. The criteria in Figure 2.1. are minimums. Further separation is permitted and
   desired.

           2.1.5.4.6. ACC Waivers.
              2.1.5.4.6.1. ACC Numbered Air Force (NAF) Director of Operations may grant
              waivers to the 15.2 m (50 ft) wingtip clearance when sufficient ramp area is
              unavailable. In no case may the wingtip clearance be waived to less than 9.1 m
              (30 ft).
              2.1.5.4.6.2. If the distance between the nose or wingtip and the egress taxiway
              centerline is below the desired distance stated in Table 2.12, the NAF minimum
              waiverable wingtip distance, 9.1 m (30 ft), must be increased by 0.31 m (1 ft) for
              each 0.31 m (1 ft) reduction in nose-to-taxiway centerline distance. For example,
              the B-52 nose-to-taxiway centerline of 43 m (140 ft) is 3.1 m (10 ft) below the
 42                                                                 AFMAN32-1084 20 APRIL 2012


                   desired distance; therefore, the minimum NAF waiverable wingtip distance is
                   12.2 m (40 ft). If the B-52 nose-to-centerline distance is 39.6 m (130 ft) or less,
                   the minimum wingtip clearance of 15.2 m (50 ft) would be required.
              2.1.5.4.7. Apron for Helicopters.
                   2.1.5.4.7.1. Parking space is provided for helicopters as follows: for six or more
                   assigned helicopters, provide apron space for 80 percent of the total assigned
                   helicopters; for fewer than six assigned helicopters, provide apron space for all.
                   Apron dimensions are based on the separation distances for parked helicopters
                   given in Table 2.13 or the US Army rotary wing criteria presented in Chapter 6 of
                   UFC 3-260-01.
                   2.1.5.4.7.2. For a rough estimate of the apron area needed, obtain the block area
                   each helicopter occupies by multiplying its operating length by its operating
                   width, then multiply each block area by 13.
                   2.1.5.4.7.3. The apron is usually part of, or contiguous to, the main airfield apron.
                   Helicopter Pads (CATCODE 116663) are built for isolated operations.

  rotor diameters for skid-mounted helicopters.

  4. For CV-22, interior, or secondary peripheral taxilane width, including rotor tip
  clearance is 51.8 m (170 ft). Through, or primary peripheral taxilane width, including
  rotor tip clearance is 74.7 m (245 ft.). Centerlines of peripheral taxilanes are positioned
  7.62 m (25 ft) inward from the apron boundary marking. See UFC 3-260-01, Figure 6.38.

        2.1.5.5. Design Considerations. All aprons are built of heavy, modified heavy,
        medium, light load, and auxiliary-load pavement as described in Chapter 3 of UFC 3-
        260-02. Apron shoulders are constructed of existing soils, thoroughly compacted, and
        covered with turf or a soil binder. Paved shoulders are authorized as indicated under
        Paved Shoulders (CATCODE 116642).
           2.1.5.5.1. Hangar access aprons and floors are designed to support a maximum
           aircraft load of 163,000 kg (360,000 pounds) for heavy and modified heavy-load
           pavements and a maximum load of 118,000 kg (260,000 pounds) for a medium-load
           pavement. This pavement is capable of supporting the basic, empty weight of all
           aircraft undergoing maintenance, including the largest aircraft. (The basic empty
           weight is the weight of the aircraft stripped of cargo, ammunition, and all but
           entrapped fuel.)
           2.1.5.5.2. Pavement for alert hangar and shelter floors are designed for either light-
           load, medium-load, modified heavy-load, or heavy-load as specified earlier in this
           chapter.
           2.1.5.5.3. Layout of aircraft parking locations and taxi lanes should consider aircraft
           taxiing routes when an aircraft is refueled. Refueling operations should not prevent an
           aircraft from leaving the parking apron.
           2.1.5.5.4. Other factors include the arrangement of refueling outlets, explosives
           clearances, required clearances to fixed or mobile objects (see UFC 3-260-01), and
           the siting of blast deflectors.

     2.1.6.1. Description. The Landing Zone (LZ) is used to train crews of cargo aircraft (C-
     130 or C-17) to conduct airlift operations in the type of airfield environment found at
     forward operating locations or actual contingency operations. LZs can be prepared
     (paved) or semi-prepared (unpaved) surfaces consisting of soil, stabilized soil, or airfield
     matting. LZs are typically shorter and narrower than standard runways.

       OCR: N/A

     2.1.7.1. Description. The shoulders of runways, aprons, taxiways, and airfield pads are
     paved to protect the shoulder areas against jet blast, reduce maintenance of the unpaved
     shoulder area, support aircraft outrigger gear, or accommodate snow removal equipment,
     aircraft service vehicles, and emergency vehicles.
     2.1.7.2. Requirements Determination. At minimum, pave shoulders to extend at least
     0.6 m (2 ft) beyond the edge lights. For apron edges where fire hydrants must be
     installed, widen the paved shoulder to within 4.6 m (15 ft) of the hydrant to allow paved
     access for firefighting vehicles. See paragraph 2.1.7.4 below.
     2.1.7.3. Scope Determination. Consult UFC 3-260-01 and ETL 07-3 for further
     guidance.
     2.1.7.4. Dimensions. See paragraph 3-9 and Table 3-2 of UFC 3-260-01. Wider paved
     shoulders are authorized as follows:
AFMAN32-1084 20 APRIL 2012                                                                 45


        2.1.7.4.1. Runways and Helipads. A minimum 3.1 m (10 ft) paved shoulder is
        required on all runways used by fighters, trainers, and B-52 aircraft. A 7.5 m (25 ft)
        paved shoulder is required for cargo mission runways, except where the runway
        width exceeds 45 m (150 ft). In these cases, pave shoulders to provide a combined
        hard surface width (runway and paved shoulders) of not less than 60 m (200 feet)
        with at least 0.6 m (2 ft) of paved surface beyond the edge lights. For rotary wing
        runways and helipads, provide 7.5 m (25 ft) paved shoulders.
        2.1.7.4.2. B-52s. Provide paved shoulder 15.2 m (50 ft) wide along the apron
        perimeter taxi lanes.
        2.1.7.4.3. Jet Transport, Cargo, or Tankers. Provide paved shoulders 7.6 m (25 ft)
        wide along the entire apron. Allow 15.2 m (50 ft) shoulders on aprons for C-5, E-4,

     2.1.8.1. Description. Pads are relatively small paved areas that serve specific functions
     such as dangerous cargo loading, helicopter parking, aircraft power check, and aircraft
     warm-up and holding. Consideration should be given to containment of runoff of
     potential spills; however, design pads to promote positive drainage. See apron grading
     criteria in Chapter 6 of UFC 3-260-01, Airfield and Heliport Planning and Design.
     2.1.8.2. Requirements Determination.
46                                                         AFMAN32-1084 20 APRIL 2012


        2.1.8.2.1. Tactical Fighter or Tactical Combat Crew Training Missions. Bases
        having tactical fighter or tactical combat crew training missions require arm/disarm
        pads; one near each end of each runway. The pads are used for arming aircraft
        immediately before take off and for disarming (safing) weapons retained or not
        expended after the aircraft's return. The pads are sited so that armed aircraft head in
        the direction of least populated areas or toward revetments.
        2.1.8.2.2. Personnel Shelter. A personnel shelter is required for weapons loaders
        and quick check crews stationed at the pad. This requirement is described further
        under Aircraft Organizational Maintenance Shop (CATCODE 211154).
        2.1.8.2.3. Special Operations Aircraft. Bases with Special Operations Aircraft
        require arm/disarm pads. The pads are used for munitions upload prior to a mission
        and disarming (safing) guns which malfunction.
     2.1.8.3. Scope Determination. The pad size and location is based on an analysis of the
     base and aircraft assigned and validated by the MAJCOM. The allowable scope is the
     minimum necessary for aircraft parking and access. For further guidance, see paragraph
     6-10 of UFC 3-260-01.
     2.1.8.4. Dimensions. Each pad is capable of servicing four to six aircraft at a time. The
     dimensions of the pad vary with length and wingspan of the aircraft to be served. See
     UFC 3-260-01 for applicable dimensions and separations.
     2.1.8.5. Design Considerations. Pads are built of heavy, medium, or light-load
     pavement. Shoulders are constructed of existing soils and thoroughly compacted and
     covered with turf or a soil binder. Paved Shoulders (CATCODE 116642) are authorized
     in areas receiving jet blast. Locate pads to satisfy explosives safety standards found in
     AFMAN 91-201.
  2.1.9. Pad, Dangerous Cargo, Load/Unload.

     2.1.9.1. Description. Dangerous cargo pads are paved areas for loading and unloading
     explosives and other hazardous cargo from aircraft.
     2.1.9.2. Requirements Determination. The pad is required at installations where
     explosives or other dangerous materials must be loaded frequently on cargo aircraft and
     where existing aprons cannot be used without violating quantity-distance (Q-D) safety
     criteria.
     2.1.9.3. Scope Determination.
AFMAN32-1084 20 APRIL 2012                                                                  47


         2.1.9.3.1. For installations other than aerial ports of embarkation/debarkation
         (APOE/APOD), a circular pad with a 33.5 m (110 ft) radius and 3,530 m2 (4,225 yd2)
         is authorized.
         2.1.9.3.2. APOE/APODs that store or process in-transit explosives require two pads
         to accommodate C-5, C-17, and Boeing 747 aircraft. Additional pads are required
         where there is an unusual volume of activity. Details are as follows:
            2.1.9.3.2.1. Area for each pad is approximately 7,440 m2 (8,900 yd2). See UFC3-
            260-01, Figures 6-25 and 6-26.
            2.1.9.3.2.2. Siting and configuration of the pads are based on 13,600 kg (30,000
            pounds) of net explosive weight (NEW) of class/division 1.1 explosives.
     2.1.9.4. Dimensions. See paragraph 6-12 of UFC 3-260-01.
     2.1.9.5. Design Considerations. See UFC 3-260-01for additional design considerations.
         2.1.9.5.1. Locate the pad to satisfy explosives safety standards, DoD 6055.9-Std and
         AFMAN 91-201.
         2.1.9.5.2. Use medium-load pavement for the pad and its access taxiway. Install tie
         down anchors and grounding points in the pad. Paved Shoulders (CATCODE
         116642) are authorized. Provide blue, flush-type taxiway lights around the edge of the
         pads in accordance with AFI 32-1044 and UFC 3-535-01.
         2.1.9.5.3. Provide revetments where required by Q-D safety criteria or where their
         installation produces a net reduction in construction and land acquisition costs.
  2.1.10. Pad, Helicopter.

     full-power engine diagnostic testing of aircraft engines while the aircraft is held
     stationary.
     2.1.11.2. Requirements Determination. This facility is authorized for bases having jet
     aircraft when suppressed pads are not required.
     2.1.11.3. Scope Determination. See paragraph 6-9 of UFC 3-260-01.
     2.1.11.4. Dimensions. Power checked pads may be either rectangular, square, or
     circular shaped. See UFC 3-260-01for specific pad layout and dimensions.
     2.1.11.5. Design Considerations. Locate the pad to satisfy explosives safety standards,
     DoD 6055.9-Std and AFMAN 91-201. Unsuppressed power check pads should be
     located near maintenance hangars but at a location where full power engine diagnostic
     testing of jet engines can be performed with minimal noise exposure to inhabited areas
     both on and off the installation. A power check pad includes a thrust anchor or anchors
     for aircraft serviced by the pad, paved shoulders, and a blast deflector to protect the
     surrounding area from jet engine blast (see UFC 3-260-01, Appendix B, Section 15,
     Aircraft Trim Pad and Thrust Anchor for up to 267 Kilonewtons [60,000 Pounds] Thrust,

        OPR: AFCESA/CEO

        OCR: AF/A4L

     2.1.13.1. Description. The warm-up/holding pad is a paved area adjacent to the taxiway
     at or near the end of a runway. The intent of a warm-up pad is to provide a parking
     location, off the taxiway, for aircraft which must hold due to indeterminate delays and
     allows other departing aircraft unencumbered access to the runway.
     2.1.13.2. Requirements Determination. A warm-up/holding pad is authorized for each
     end of a runway.
     2.1.13.3. Scope Determination. See paragraphs 6-8 in UFC 3-260-01 for further
     guidance.
     2.1.13.4. Dimensions. Sized to accommodate two of the largest aircraft assigned to the
     base, observing wingtip clearances given in Table 6-1 of UFC 3-260-01, and to provide a
     minimum of 7.62 m (25 ft) of blast-resistant pavement behind the tail of an aircraft to
     prevent damage from jet blast.
     2.1.13.5. Design Considerations. The pad is constructed of light-load or medium-load
     pavement, with or without paved shoulders, as applicable. Consult paragraphs 6-8.2 and
     6-8.3 in UFC 3-260-01 for location and siting consideration.

         OPR: AF/A4L

         OCR: AFCESA/CEO

     2.1.14.1. Description. The calibration pad is a paved area where aircraft are positioned
     during calibration of the magnetic standby compass and the magnetic azimuth detector.
     2.1.14.2. Requirements Determination. Reference paragraph 6-11 of UFC 3-260-01 or
     the criteria provided in FAA Advisory Circular 150/5300-13, (Appendix 4) for additional
     guidance.
     2.1.14.3. Scope Determination. Generally, the circular pad is sized for the assigned
     aircraft and its calibration equipment. Locate the pad in an area of minimum magnetic
     disturbances, away from transmission lines, vehicular traffic, and facilities containing
     ferrous metals.
     2.1.14.4. Dimensions. See Figure 6-24 of UFC 3-260-01.
     2.1.14.5. Design Considerations. The pad is constructed of light-load or medium-load

         OPR: AF/A4L

         OCR: AFCESA/CEO

     2.1.15.1. Description. Aircraft washracks are paved areas provided at all installations to
     clean aircraft in conjunction with periodic maintenance and to prevent corrosion.
     2.1.15.2. Requirements Determination. Each Air Force base having assigned aircraft
     must have a Corrosion Control Facility (CATCODE 211159). Washrack pads are an
     economical way to supplement the capability of the Corrosion Control Facility,
     particularly in warmer climates or at remote sites. Pads may also be covered to provide
     relief from heat and rain conditions.
     2.1.15.3. Scope Determination. The size and configuration of an aircraft washrack is
     determined by the type of mission aircraft expected to use it. At mixed mission facilities,
     it may be possible to accommodate several smaller (fighter) aircraft on one larger aircraft
     washrack pavement. A separate utility storage building, Corrosion Control Utility Storage
     (CATCODE 211161), is also needed for aircraft cleaning supplies and equipment. A
     utility storage building of 22.3 m2 (240 ft2) is allowed, if justified. See paragraphs 6-14 of
     UFC 3-260-01 for additional information on aircraft washracks.
     2.1.15.4. Dimensions. The dimensions of the largest aircraft plus the clearances shown
     in Table 6-4 of UFC 3-260-01 determine the minimum washrack pavement dimensions.
AFMAN32-1084 20 APRIL 2012                                                                  51

        OPR: AFCESA/CEO

        OCR: WR-ALC/642 CBSG

     2.1.16.1. Description. Aircraft arresting systems consist of engaging devices and energy
     absorbers. Engaging devices are net barriers, such as MA-1A and BAK-15; disc-
     supported pendants (hook cables); and cable support systems, such as BAK-14 and the
     Aerazur Type H, that raise the pendant to the battery position or retract it below the
     runway surface. Energy absorbing devices are ships' anchor chains; rotary friction brakes,
     such as the BAK-9 and BAK12; rotary hydraulic systems, such as the BAK-13; tearing
     strap modules, such as Textile Brake Systems; and soft ground systems, such as the
     Engineered Material Arresting System (EMAS).
     2.1.16.2. Requirements Determination.
        2.1.16.2.1. All Aircraft arresting systems, except the Soft Ground Arrestor System
        (SGAS) (also known as the Engineered Material Arrestor System), are centrally
        procured. Except for the SGAS, requirements for arresting systems are determined
        and submitted by each MAJCOM to AFCESA/CEO for validation. WR-ALC budgets
        for, procures, and distributes arresting systems according to validated requirements.
        See AFI 32-1043, Managing, Operating, and Maintaining Aircraft Arresting Systems,
        for details. SGAS systems may be used to enhance safety where the standard 305 m
        (1,000 ft) overrun cannot be provided. In such cases, the SGAS must be designed,
        funded, and installed as part of the facility to accommodate the aircraft intended to
        use the runway. In most cases, the arrestor bed is designed to stop an overrunning
        aircraft departing the runway at 70 knots within the available distance. See FAA
        Advisory Circular 150/5220-22A, Engineered Materials Arresting Systems (EMAS)
        for Aircraft Overruns.
        2.1.16.2.2. Required Facilities.
            2.1.16.2.2.1. The energy absorber governs the facilities for the aircraft arresting
            system. The type and model of energy absorber determines the runout of the
            engaging device. The runway pavement, or the 300 m (1,000 ft) overrun
            pavement for runout, is designed for the loadbearing characteristics specified in
            paragraph 2.1 (Airfield Pavements) of this chapter.
            2.1.16.2.2.2. Aircraft arresting systems installed within the shoulder area of
            runways or within the unpaved overrun area require a paved service road to the
            equipment installation site, both from the runway or overrun, as well as from
            another location that does not require access from operational pavements such as
            the runway. All below-grade structures located within the shoulder area of the
52                                                        AFMAN32-1084 20 APRIL 2012


           runway or within the overrun area must be constructed to support the wheel loads
           for runway, taxiway, or apron shoulder areas required by UFC 3-260-01. Support
           ramps are constructed to lead up to exposed vertical surfaces of fairlead beams
           and tape tubes to allow an aircraft to roll over them smoothly.
           2.1.16.2.2.3. BAK-12 arresting gear that is installed on grade must have an
           "airfield friendly" structure built over it to protect the equipment from
           environmental degradation. Design should be in compliance with typical
           installation drawings, the applicable 35E8-2 series TO, and the requirements
           detailed within UFC 3-260-01. Shelters and pits must also contain adequate
           ventilation to avoid confined space permit entry requirements, and on-grade
           shelters must have windows located so operators can see the arrestment area and
           directly across the runway.
           2.1.16.2.2.4. Do not install any arresting system where the runout will conflict
           with any other arresting system or any obstacle such as elevated airfield lights or
           signs. In cases where these criteria cannot be met, a waiver must be established
           according to UFC 3-260-01 and/or the applicable TO, as appropriate.
           2.1.16.2.2.5. Minimum runout distances (not including the distance from the nose
           wheel to the aircraft tail hook) applicable to the various arresting systems are:
               2.1.16.2.2.5.1. MA-1 or MA-1A with anchor chain: 260 m (850 ft).
               2.1.16.2.2.5.2. BAK-12, 1.68 m (66 in) Reel: 290 m (950 ft) or 370 m (1,200
               ft).
               2.1.16.2.2.5.3. BAK-14 or Type H cable retraction system: These are
               engaging devices only; the runout is dependent upon the type of energy
               absorber used.
               2.1.16.2.2.5.4. Mobile Aircraft Arresting System (MAAS): 300 to 370 m
               (1,000 to 1,200 ft).
               2.1.16.2.2.5.5. BAK-15 (commercial designation, 61QSIIM), net arresting
               system: Runout is dependent upon type of energy absorber used.
               2.1.16.2.2.5.6. Textile Brake SystemL A one-time use energy absorber in
               either a uni-directional (MB 100.10.C, 271 m [889 ft]) or bi-directional (MB
               60.9.9.C, 305 m [1,000 ft]) configuration.
     2.1.16.3. Scope Determination. See AFI 32-1043 and paragraphs 3-16 of UFC 3-260-
     01.
     2.1.16.4. Dimensions. See AFI 32-1043, UFC 3-260-01, and UFC 3-535-01.
     2.1.16.5. Design Considerations.
        2.1.16.5.1. Critical Areas. The 60 m (200 ft) preceding the approach side of the
        engaging device is a critical area. Protruding objects and undulating surfaces are
        detrimental for successful engagements. No changes in pavement type are allowed in
        this area within the center 22.9 m (75 ft) of the runway.
AFMAN32-1084 20 APRIL 2012                                                                  53


         2.1.16.5.2. Siting. Siting criteria for arresting systems depend on the type of
         installation and the arresting system. The 38E8 Series TOs and AFI 32-1043 provide
         general guidance. Typical installation drawings are available from AFCESA/CEO or
         WR-ALC (642 CBSG/GBEB) upon request. Criteria for siting systems are as follows:
             2.1.16.5.2.1. Operational Systems. The best location for an operational
             arresting system, such as BAK-12, is 450 to 540 meters (1,500 to 1,800 feet) from
             the threshold.
             2.1.16.5.2.2. Emergency Systems. Locate unidirectional arresting systems and
             barriers (nets) in the overrun area of the runway. Do not locate unidirectional
             systems or net barriers closer than 11 m (35 ft) from the threshold of the runway.
         2.1.16.5.3. Equipment Location. Equipment location and associated requirements
         conform to criteria established in AFI 32-1043.
         2.1.16.5.4. Mobile Aircraft Arresting System (MAAS). The MAAS is not
         intended for permanent or long term installation. However, all necessary foundations,
         anchors, and utility support may be installed to support recurring MAAS installation
         in support of exercises or air shows. MAJCOMs have the responsibility to determine
         these requirements. Equipment location and associated requirements shall conform to
         criteria established in AFI 32-1043.
         2.1.16.5.5. Joint-Use Airfields. Arresting systems on joint use civil/military
         airfields are sited in accordance with FAA Advisory Circular 150/5220-9A, Aircraft
         Arresting System on Civil Airports and local agreements (see AFI 32-1043,
         Attachment 5, Sample Letter of Agreement with the Federal Aviation Administration).
         Systems are normally installed underground.
  2.1.17. Jet Blast Deflector.
         FAC: 1464

         CATCODE: 116945

         OPR: AFCESA/CEO

         OCR: AF/A3O-A

     2.1.17.1. Description. Jet blast deflectors are equipment to shield parked aircraft,
     taxiing aircraft, vehicles, personnel, and pavements from jet blast effects.
     2.1.17.2. Requirements Determination. Jet blast deflectors are installed where
     continual jet engine run-up interferes with the parking or taxiing of aircraft, the
     movement of vehicles, and the activities of maintenance personnel, or where jet run-up
     causes the erosion of a pavement shoulder not protected by stabilization or concrete
     surfacing.
     2.1.17.3. Scope Determination. Size and configuration are selected to satisfy aircraft
     taxiing, parking, and jet blast requirements. See paragraphs 6-19.1 and Appendix B,
     Section 8, of UFC 3-260-01.
 54                                                           AFMAN32-1084 20 APRIL 2012


      2.1.17.4. Dimensions. A deflector is generally 2.4 to 3.7 m (8 to 12 ft) tall and located
      21 to 37 m (70 to 120 ft) aft of the jet engine nozzle, but not less than 15.2 m (50 ft) from
      the tail of the aircraft.
      2.1.17.5. Design Considerations. Two blast deflector types are commonly used. One is
      a concave, single curved, corrugated metal surface, with or without baffles, fastened and
      braced to a concrete base to withstand the force of the jet blast and deflect it upward. The
      most widely deployed model of this type when used for F-15, F-16, and F-22 aircraft is
      the GS-12 Deflector manufactured by Blast Deflector, Inc. The second is a rectangular
      metal frame anchored to the ground at an angle, with multiple horizontal curved vanes to
      deflect the jet blast upwards. Other deflector types may be used.
2.2. Category Group 12, Liquid Fueling and Dispensing Facilities.
   2.2.1. Overview. This section contains the general criteria and standards for petroleum
   dispensing and operating facilities for Air Force installations worldwide. Each base is
   provided adequate facilities for receiving, storing, distributing, and dispensing the fuel
   products necessary for its assigned mission. See UFC 3-460-01, Petroleum Fuel Facilities,
   and UFC 3-460-03, Operation and Maintenance: Maintenance of Petroleum Systems, for
   additional information and guidance.
      2.2.1.1. Waiver Process. Changes in criteria must be approved through the DoD Fuel
      Facility Engineering Panel, which sets DoD fuel system criteria. Submit requests for
      waivers through AFCESA/CEO.
      2.2.1.2. Projects for facilities storing or handling bulk fuel supplied by Defense Energy
      Support Center (DESC) are normally programmed through the appropriate MAJCOM.
   2.2.2. General Guidance.
      2.2.2.1. Security. AFI 31-101, The Air Force Installation Security Program, requires all
      dispensing and operating facilities to have security protection. See criteria elsewhere and
      herein on Lights (CATCODE 812926), Fences (CATCODE 872247), and Security
      Alarms (CATCODE 872841). Other security aids such as sensors and other detection
      devices are provided as feasible. Dispensing and operating facilities in controlled areas,
      such as liquid fuel storage areas, do not require separate protection.
      2.2.2.2. Environmental. All liquid fuel storage, distribution, and dispensing facilities
      must be provided with positive methods to preclude discharge of pollutants to the
      surrounding atmosphere, ground, or waters. Spill containment shall comply with Section
      311(j) of the CWA and with Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasures (SPCC)
      requirements contained in Part 112 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).
      Control devices such as leak detection and automatic tank gauging will be provided as an
      integral component of the facility. Fuels facilities shall comply with local, state, federal,
      and host nation environmental law as applicable.
      2.2.2.3. Explosives Safety Considerations. Explosives safety standards, DoD 6055.9-
      Std and AFMAN 91-201, establish minimum separation standards for fuel storage and
      dispensing activities. These standards shall be met for construction of fuel facilities.

      2.2.3.4. Dimensions. The petroleum operations building includes a laboratory for
      conducting prescribed tests. The smaller building requires approximately 30 m2 (315 ft2)
      of laboratory space for equipment and working area; the larger building requires 33 m 2
      (352 ft2). This space requires year-round environmental control. The petroleum
      operations building should be located adjacent to the refueler vehicle parking area.
             2.2.3.4.1. The petroleum operations building also requires (1) a ready room for
             fueling operators; (2) administrative offices; (3) a fuels control center; (4) men's toilet
             and locker room and women's toilet and locker room; (5) conference room and
             classroom; (6) a vehicle checkpoint and operator maintenance room; and (7) an
             emergency shower and eyewash in the work area in accordance with AFOSH Std 91-
             38, Hydrocarbon Fuels and ANSI Z358.1-2004, American National Standard for
             Emergency Eyewash and Shower Equipment.
             2.2.3.4.2. The 23 m2 (250 ft2) vehicle checkpoint operator maintenance room may be
             in a separate building if it is operationally desirable or if adding the room onto an
             existing petroleum operations building is impractical. The room contains working
             space for a vehicle maintenance inspector, storage space for small replacement parts,
             and benches and equipment for vehicle operators to use in performing minor repair
             work.
             2.2.3.4.3. An additional bulk storage operations building of approximately 42 m2
             (450 ft2) is necessary to provide office space and latrine for bulk fuel storage
             personnel, if this building is immediately adjacent to the storage facility. If a site is
56                                                          AFMAN32-1084 20 APRIL 2012


        not available adjacent to the storage facility, provide the bulk storage operations
        building adjacent to the primary storage area.
     2.2.3.5. Design Considerations. Installations with waterfront unloading facilities
     require a small storage building on-shore near the facilities for pollution control
     activities. Requirements are given under Liquid Fuel Off-Shore Unloading Facility
     (CATCODE 163311) and UFC 3-460-01.

     2.2.5.1. Description. A hydrant fueling system provides all the necessary equipment
     and controls to deliver clean, dry fuel to fueling points in the aircraft parking apron. The
     system includes a minimum of two Operational Storage Tanks (CATCODE 124131), but
     it does not include bulk storage. Bulk storage is programmed under Category Group 41,
     Liquid Fuel Storage.
     2.2.5.2. Requirements Determination. Hydrant fueling systems are not authorized for
     bases where the property is not owned by the Air Force, except where the Air Force has
     operational control of real property at a joint base, where terms of the lease do not allow
     for long term Air Force tenure, or for other than main air bases. A hydrant fueling system
     is required for the following aircraft:
        2.2.5.2.1. Aircraft with a total tank capacity exceeding 76,000 liters (20,000 gallons).
AFMAN32-1084 20 APRIL 2012                                                                    57


         2.2.5.2.2. Aircraft, regardless of tank capacity, if a complete economic analysis
         shows that the annual cost of owning and operating a hydrant fueling system is less
         expensive than a truck fueling operation.
         2.2.5.2.3. Tactical aircraft, regardless of tank capacity, in support of combat
         turnaround requirements.
         2.2.5.2.4. Tactical aircraft in hardened shelters, docks, or specially designed hangars;
         that is, fuel loop system to aircraft shelter.
     2.2.5.3. Scope Determination. Where hydrant fueling systems are justified, fueling
     positions will be provided at all aircraft parking positions and at all cargo loading
     positions. Connections compatible with the aircraft design and necessary flow rates will
     be provided.
     2.2.5.4. Dimensions. The MAJCOM Fuels Engineer and MAJCOM Fuels Management
     section will determine the hydrant system size based on base specific mission
     requirements and airframe specific upload rates.
     2.2.5.5. Design Considerations.
         2.2.5.5.1. For system design guidance, characteristics, and capacities, consult Section
         4 of UFC 3-460-01. Types III, IV, and V fueling systems each have standard designs
         that shall be used. Design criteria for fueling systems are established by the DoD Fuel
         Facility Engineering Panel. Waivers for changes must be processed through
         AFCESA/CEO.
         2.2.5.5.2. All fueling and tank systems will comply with local, state, and federal
         requirements in respect to fuel vapor emissions, as required by AFI 32-7040. For fuel
         spills compliance consult AFI 32-7041 and AF Policy Letter, Oil/Water Separators

     2.2.7.1. Description. These facilities (also called Base Service Stations) are provided
     for fueling government owned vehicles and equipment. The facilities and equipment are
     similar to commercial service stations with separate storage and dispensing facilities for
     each type of fuel issued.
     2.2.7.2. Requirements Determination.
        2.2.7.2.1. Base Civil Engineer (BCE) Facility. At bases where the Base Civil
        Engineer compound is more than one mile from the base service station, a separate
        Civil Engineer fueling station is authorized.
        2.2.7.2.2. Aircraft Support Equipment (Aerospace Ground Equipment,
        [AGE]). Remote fueling stations for AGE vehicles may be provided where it is not
        practical to drive such equipment to the vehicle fueling station (base service station).
        Normally this will be limited to locations having more than ten pieces of equipment
        when the distance to the motor pool area is over one mile.
        2.2.7.2.3. For programming purposes operating tanks are included as part of the
        facility they serve. CATCODE 124135 is used for inventory purposes for these
        tanks.
     2.2.7.3. Scope Determination. At stations where high volumes of fuel issues require
     constant replenishment, a minimum of two tanks per grade of product must be provided,
     and the tanks should be 45,000 liters (12,000 gallons) or larger capacity to accommodate
     commercial tank truck deliveries. Provide one fuel fill stand for each grade of product.
     For facilities with fewer than 100 assigned vehicles, a minimum of one 38,000 liter
     (10,000 gallon) tank and one commercial type dispensing pump and meter will be
     provided per tank. Above ground tanks are preferred if clearance criteria is available.
        2.2.7.3.1. BCE Facility. One commercial-type dispensing pump and meter will be
        provided for each tank. A minimum of one 19,000 liter (5,000 gallon) storage tank
        will be provided for each type of fuel issued.
        2.2.7.3.2. AGE Facility. A single storage tank with a capacity of 3,800 liters (1,000
        gallons) per each ten pieces of AGE or an underground tank up to 45,000 liters
        (12,000 gallons) may be provided for each type of fuel issued. A commercial type
        dispensing pump and meter will be provided for each tank.
     2.2.7.4. Dimensions. At locations where base bulk ground fuels stocks are maintained at
     the vehicle fueling station, provide a dispensing pump, meter, and hose or loading arm to
     load ground fuel delivery vehicles. See paragraph 2.2.7.3 and UFC 3-460-01.
     2.2.7.5. Design Considerations.
        2.2.7.5.1. Operating tanks for vehicle fueling stations will be above ground where
        possible. If underground tanks are required to meet distance criteria, they will be
AFMAN32-1084 20 APRIL 2012                                                                  59


        double wall horizontal cylindrical type tanks of steel or fiberglass and equipped with
        a leak monitoring and detection system. Tanks will be sized in accordance with
        paragraph 2.2.7.3.
        2.2.7.5.2. All vehicle fueling stations shall comply with local, state, and federal
        requirements in respect to fuel vapor emissions, as required by AFI 32-7040 and other
        guidance as defined in paragraphs 1.3.1 and 1.8.6 in this Manual. At locations where
        no fuel vapor emission requirement exists and a new system (or modification to an
        existing system) is being installed, include necessary piping for a vapor recovery
        system in the installation (or modification). Vehicle service stations must be designed
        to accommodate the Automated Fuels Service Station hardware. A consolidated
        station for vehicles and support equipment, such as AGE, should be considered where
        practical.
        2.2.7.5.3. Secondary containment with holding capacity equal to the largest single
        compartment of the tank trucks to be loaded will be provided at fueling stations.
        2.2.7.5.4. Compressed natural gas service stations are generally skid mounted
        equipment versus real property. For criteria on connection to base natural gas systems
        contact AFCESA/CEO.
        2.2.7.5.5. Operating fuel storage tanks are provided wherever dispensing facilities are
        remote from bulk storage tanks. These tanks provide a means of storing fuel
        immediately prior to issue into aircraft or vehicles. Operating storage tanks will be
        constructed above ground at CONUS locations. In all cases, above-ground tanks are
        preferred wherever airfield clearance criteria permit and where survivability issues
        are not a concern.

     facilities should request pre-technical assistance from the supporting engineering and
     installation Command, Control, Communications, and Computers (C4) organizations in
     accordance with AFI 33-104. During the technical assistance, communications engineers
     will identify the special purpose space requirements for the proposed equipment and
     facility. For new installations, the Base Private Branch Exchange (PBX) Switching
     Center (commonly referred to as the base telephone switch) may be leased from a
     telephone company or it may be government owned. HQ USAF or DoD will determine
     whether leased or government wired telephone equipment/facilities will be used.
     2.3.2.3. Scope Determination. Size of the telecommunications facilities will vary with

     2.3.4.1. Description. This facility consists of antennae for a communications receiver
     site only.
     2.3.4.2. Requirements Determination.
        2.3.4.2.1. Very High Frequency/Ultra High Frequency (VHF/UHF) Air Traffic
        Control (ATC) radio equipment is usually at one or two remote locations either on or
        off base. Transmitters may all be located on one site with receivers located at a
        second site, physically separate to minimize interference. They may also be
        collocated in one building at a single "transceiver" site. Collocated sites are to be used
        whenever possible. Primary Air Traffic Control (ATC) radio equipment may be
        remotely controlled using telephone keying and audio lines or small capacity
        microwave radio systems from the control tower, Radar Approach Control
        (RAPCON), etc. The transmitter-receiver site consists of a building, usually
        constructed of concrete masonry units, with appropriate interior accommodations for
        routing electrical, telephone, and equipment cables. Ports are provided in the building
        for entry/exit of power, telephone, and coaxial cables. The site is normally equipped
        with an emergency power generator located either in the building or in a nearby
        exterior building. The generator is usually diesel powered and activated manually or
        automatically upon primary power failure. The power generator room/outbuilding has
        special ventilation, electrical, fuel safety, and environmental considerations. Land
        immediately adjacent to the building is required for the installation of wooden poles
        or metal towers to support VHF/UHF antennas.
        2.3.4.2.2. Physical security equipment required includes safety and emergency
        lighting, obstruction lighting, security fencing, and controlled area signs as indicated
        in AFI 31-101. Work space may be required along with storage space for paint,
        flammable materials, and fuel tanks.
        2.3.4.2.3. High Frequency (HF) Point/Point and Ground/Air Sites. Unlike
        VHF/UHF sites, which are closely tied to base ATC facilities (control tower,
        RAPCON, etc.), HF systems are often operated at the receiver or transmitter site or in
        a separate facility and may be remotely connected to the transmitter facility. Some HF
        radio stations are user-operated or operator-operated transceiver facilities in
        command posts or other on-base locations, and do not have specific radio facilities.
        Antennas are often located alongside base buildings or on rooftops and vary in nature.
        Some multi-HF transceiver sites may be operated locally (in conjunction with radio
        equipment) or remotely from another location. The size of the transceiver building
        and its associated antenna farm varies significantly based upon the number of radio
        levels involved, the mission of the station (point/point, air/ground, etc.), and azimuths
        of the antennas (or rotating antennas). Antennas should be located away from high
68                                                            AFMAN32-1084 20 APRIL 2012


        tension power lines, metal fences (depending upon the type of antenna), and away
        from noise generating devices or machinery. Collocated (transceiver) HF sites are
        considerably larger than the VHF/UHF sites, but the split site HF sites will be the
        largest, and may be separated by up to 40 km (25 miles) to minimize electromagnetic
        interference between sites. Associated buildings must accommodate large numbers of
        high power radio transmitters/receivers, emergency power source, maintenance, and
        supply areas.
     2.3.4.3. Scope Determination. The size of the antenna "farm" varies with the scope and
     complexity of air operations at each base, the character of the facility (i.e., a transmitter
     site only, a receiver site only, or a collocated transmitter/receiver site), and the technical
     complexity of the facility (quantity of radios, operating frequencies, use of duplexers,
     electromagnetic compatibility, etc.). Each facility is generally tailored to its specific
     mission, incorporating technical, functional, environmental, geographical, and local
     considerations.
     2.3.4.4. Dimensions. Varies (see paragraph 2.3.4.3). For latest information and
     drawings, plans, utility, siting and electronic requirements, consult AFFSA.
     2.3.4.5. Design Considerations. Consult the Air Traffic Control Tower and Radar
     Approach Control Facility Design Guide.

        OPR: AFFSA

        OCR: AFNIC, AF/A3O, AFCESA/CEO

     2.3.27.1. Description. A TACAN is a short range, UHF, line-of-sight air navigation
     system that provides continuous, accurate slant-range distance and bearing information.
     The information is presented to the pilot in two dimensions, distance and bearing, to and
     from a selected ground station. The TACAN station theoretically produces an infinite
     number of signals similar to the spokes of a wheel.
     2.3.27.2. Requirements Determination. TACAN stations may be used as either
     terminal or enroute aids. The maximum service range is approximately 360 km (195
     nautical miles) at high altitude. Therefore, the installation may be on or off base. When
     used as a terminal aid, the TACAN should be installed on base adjacent to the runway, as
     close to the runway centerline as criteria specified in UFC 3-260-01 will permit. For an
     on-base installation, the maximum angle of convergence between the runway centerline
     and TACAN final approach course is 30 degrees at a point 900 m (3,000 ft) from the
     runway threshold. See AFI 32-1044 for additional guidance.
     2.3.27.3. Scope Determination.
        2.3.27.3.1. Fixed TACAN Air Navigation Station (AN/FRN-45). The AN/FRN-45
        Solid State TACAN modification replaces the outmoded tube-type TACANs. They
        will be housed in the existing TACAN buildings. They will also utilize the existing
        backup power generators and the existing antenna and tower structure. The AN/FRN-
        45 TACAN is designated to provide the same service with solid state reliability.
        2.3.27.3.2. Mobile TACAN Stations (AN/TRN-26 and AN/TRN-41). The
        AN/TRN-26 is a highly mobile TACAN system. It is designed on the building block
        concept for quick reaction TACAN service at locations where weight and cube are

        critical. The AN/TRN-26 has the capability to be housed in a mobile van or operate
        freestanding for short durations, when under field conditions. It has the capability to
        operate with commercial power or generator power. When properly sited, it is
        designed to provide the same service as a fixed based TACAN.
            2.3.27.3.2.1. The AN/TRN-41 is a light-weight air-dropable TACAN set to be
            used by Air Force combat control teams as a navigational aid (NAVAID) for
            aircraft operating in contingency or forward areas. It operates without hardstand
            or shelter. It is intended to be used in VMC (Visual Meteorological Conditions)
            and is not equipped with the monitors required for use during Instrument Flight
            Rules (IFR) weather conditions.

        OPR: AFFSA

        OCR: AFNIC, AF/A3O, AFCESA/CEO

     2.3.29.1. Description. The VOR system is a ground-based, short range, line-of-sight
     radio NAVAID producing a theoretically infinite number of signals emanating from the
     station (similar to spokes of a wheel) that provides the pilot with bearing information
     only.
AFMAN32-1084 20 APRIL 2012                                                                  83


     2.3.29.2. Requirements Determination. VOR stations may be used as either terminal
     or enroute NAVAIDS. When used as a terminal aid, the VOR may be installed on base
     adjacent to the runway, as close to the runway centerline as criteria specified in UFC 3-
     260-01 will permit. It may also be installed on the extended runway centerline as a Final
     Approach Fix (FAF), in accordance with criteria specified in AFI 13-204, Functional
     Management of Airfield Operations; AFJMAN 11-226, United States Standard for
     Terminal Instrument Procedures (TERPS); AFI 11-230, Instrument Procedures; and
     FAA Handbook 8260.3B, US Standard for Terminal Instrument Procedures (TERPS).
     For on-base installations, the maximum angle of convergence between the extended
     runway centerline and VOR final approach course is 30 degrees at a point 900 m (3,000
     ft) from the runway threshold. Where practical, the VOR should be installed as part of an
     on-base VORTAC facility (see paragraph 2.3.30). This follows the Air Force policy for
     reducing monetary expenditures for land acquisition and remote location maintenance.
     2.3.29.3. Scope Determination. See UFC 3-260-01.
     2.3.29.4. Dimensions. See UFC 3-260-01.
     2.3.29.5. Design Considerations. The AN/FRN-44 Solid State VOR modification
     replaces the outmoded tube type VORs. If possible, they will be housed in the existing
     VOR buildings. They will also utilize the existing backup power generators, and the
     Alford Loop type antenna. The AN/AFN-44 VOR is designed to provide the same service
     with solid state reliability.

        OCR: AFNIC, AF/A3O, AFCESA/CEO

     2.3.30.1. Description. Navigation aids consisting of collocated TACAN and VOR
     facilities are known as VORTACs. They provide bearing information on both VHF and
     UHF bands plus compatible DME. This enables aircraft equipped with either TACAN or
     VOR/DME to make use of the navigational guidance.
     2.3.30.2. Requirements Determination. Air Force policy requires that TACAN and
     VOR stations located on the same base and permanently required to support operational
     missions should be collocated and operated as VORTACs. This enables pairing of facility
     frequencies according to an established schedule and allows substantial maintenance
     savings and other ancillary cost savings.
     2.3.30.3. Scope Determination. VORTAC facilities are usually made up of facilities
     whose antennas are vertically stacked and thus identically located, but antennas located
     within 30 m (100 ft) of one another are considered collocated, for terminal use. For other
     than terminal use, antennas are considered to be collocated when within 600 m (2,000 ft)
     of one another.

     2.3.30.4. Dimensions. See UFC 3-260-01.
     2.3.30.5. Design Considerations. If used as a terminal aid for instrument approach
     procedures, both the VOR and TACAN radials of the VORTAC must be aligned in the
     same direction. When collocated, the AN/FRN-45 TACAN and the AN/FRN-44 VOR
     become the AN/FRN-43 VORTAC.

     2.3.31.1. Description. This is a lighted visual aid to indicate the direction of the wind
     and thus enable the pilot to select the proper runway for landing. A visual wind indicator
     is especially essential if radio contact with the control tower is lost and the pilot cannot
     receive oral information and instructions for landing the aircraft. The wind direction
     indicator will be a lighted wind cone or a wind sock.

     2.4.3.1. Description.
         2.4.3.1.1. Ready Aircraft Shelter. This shelter is for fighter or tactical aircraft with
         an alert commitment.
         2.4.3.1.2. Alert Aircraft Shelter. This is a shelter for aircraft with an alert
         commitment to be airborne within prescribed time limits.
AFMAN32-1084 20 APRIL 2012                                                                       89


     2.4.3.2. Requirements Determination. Shelters are authorized for 75 percent of unit-
     equipped aircraft assigned to tactical air defense missions. Shelters needed for tactical
     aircraft not assigned to air defense are based on individual missions and locations. See
     UFC 3-260-01 for additional information. Obtain additional guidance from MAJCOM
     sources.
     2.4.3.3. Scope Determination.
        2.4.3.3.1. Ready Aircraft Shelter. This structure has minimal insulation and
        utilities. Doors are installed front and rear with no specific opening speed. Rear doors
        are required for engine exhaust. These shelters are usually created on existing aprons
        and are not intended for maintenance purposes. This shelter protects aircraft parked
        on the apron in a ready condition and during operational checks on electronic
        equipment. This shelter is necessary to protect equipment from dust, moisture, and
        high winds.
        2.4.3.3.2. Alert Aircraft Shelter. Unlike shelters for ready aircraft, shelters for alert
        aircraft may be insulated and heated. Typically, each site will support up to six
        aircraft (four on alert and two spares). Each aircraft on alert status should be sheltered
        in a hangar or hangar substitute, with or without doors, depending on local climate
        and operational conditions. Spare aircraft are not required to be sheltered unless local
        climate or other conditions warrant. As a general rule, Air Sovereignty Alert (ASA)
        facilities north of the 38th parallel should have fully enclosed facilities with shelters
        for all aircraft, including spares (cold weather location), and facilities south of the 38th
        parallel may use ramp parking spaces for spare aircraft (hot weather location). All
        shelters shall have minimal insulation and sufficient lighting. At least one of the alert
        shelters should be fully enclosed, to include doors, to provide an appropriate work
        area for aircraft maintenance. Include lightning protection and grounding
        requirements IAW DoD and service directives for all new facilities to support flight
        line maintenance activities. Shelter design and siting shall comply with DoD and
        service directives safety standards. See ACC Air Sovereignty Alert Site Template
        (August 2008) for further information.
     2.4.3.4. Dimensions. Shelters are sized based on the aircraft being supported. See Table
     3.2 of this Manual for aircraft separation inside shelters.
     2.4.3.5. Design Considerations.
        2.4.3.5.1. Shelters are intended to be pre-engineered, concrete masonry unit (CMU)
        block, or tilt-up concrete panel construction. A hybrid design may also be considered.
        Doors on alert aircraft shelters must have fully automatic openers. Doors will be
        power-operated with manual override features at each end of the shelter. Door
        operating speed will provide full opening within 60 seconds of activation. Provide a
        minimum of two personnel doors which meet emergency exit criteria per NFPA and
        Life Safety Codes. All architectural features shall be consistent with local base
        standards and Base Architectural Compatibility Plan. Comply with all local codes for
        wind, snow, and seismic loads. Refueling operations will require a drainage system
        capable of handling a fuel spill.

        2.4.3.5.2. Provide minimal heat (50°F) and ventilation. Provide air compressors and
        other real property installed equipment (RPIE) and real property similar equipment
        (RPSE) per local requirements, and limited temporary hazard materials storage and
        cryogenics (liquid oxygen [LOX], Nitrogen) storage. Each shelter will include an
        eyewash/shower facility.
        2.4.3.5.3. Alert aircraft are considered to be loaded with explosives (loaded) and will
        be site planned according to DoD 6055.9-Std and AFMAN 91-201. Shelters for alert
        aircraft must be sited away from explosive munitions according to the Q-D safety
        provisions of AFMAN 91-201. Aircraft with forward-firing munitions may need a
        commander's risk assessment for siting purposes.
        2.4.3.5.4. Electrical. Provide electrical converters that generate adequate technical
        power for aircraft maintenance/start-up requirements throughout all hangar/shelter
        facilities. F-15 and F-16 aircraft require 250Vdc. F-22 and F-35 aircraft require
        270Vdc. Provide sufficient lighting to allow minimal flight-line level maintenance
        and servicing of aircraft. Emergency/back-up generators are required for shelter door
        operations as a minimum and should support the entire ASA site. Back-up power
        should be accomplished by series smaller, load shedding, commercially available
        generators. Use non-diesel (or dual fuel) generators when possible (propane or natural
        gas). Include lightning protection IAW DoD and service directives for all new
        facilities to support flight line level maintenance activities. Refueling operations will
        require provisions for Class 1, Division 1 hazardous locations below floor/grade level
        5.
        2.4.3.5.5. Fire-Protection. Comply with fire protection criteria per NFPA and Life
        Safety Codes. Permanent, fully enclosed shelters must have proper fire/safety
        equipment, meet National Electrical Code (NEC) and comply with UFC 3-600-1,
        ETLs 02-15, Fire Protection Engineering Criteria - New Aircraft Facilities and 01-4,
        Fire Protection Engineering Criteria – Protective Aircraft Shelters (PAS), and NFPA
        standards in order to support flight line level maintenance activities. Refueling
        operations will require an automatic foam-water fire suppression system.

      2.4.4.3. Scope Determination. Additional space for maintenance functions may be
      authorized in one or two shelters per squadron. Air Force-directed programs have
      additional provisions for tank, rack, and pylon storage; weapon storage security system;
      in-shelter refueling; and pilot telebriefing.
      2.4.4.4. Dimensions. Hangar size is based on assigned aircraft. First and second
      generation Tactical Air Base Hardened Aircraft Shelters (TAB-VEES), one aircraft each.
      Third generation and others may shelter more than one aircraft.
      2.4.4.5. Design Considerations. The shelter is usually constructed out of steel-lined,
      460 mm (18 in) thick Portland cement concrete. Obtain additional information from
      USAFE/A7 and PACAF/A7.

        statute miles (SM) of the center of the aerodrome. Additionally, for meteorological
AFMAN32-1084 20 APRIL 2012                                                                      99


          observations, the observing location is defined as the ―point of observation.‖ Points of
          observation are locations where the various elements of the observation are evaluated
          (see AFMAN 15-111). At automated weather observing locations, the point of
          observation is the location of the primary sensor group and the discontinuity sensor
          group. However, at manual observing locations and during augmentation of
          automated weather observations, the point of observation may coincide with the
          weather observing location. If this is the case, the normal operating location is in Base
          Operations (CATCODE 141453) or another suitable facility which provides
          consistent visually determined values. Either location should be as free from man-
          made obstructions as possible. Generally, locations with windows facing the runway
          complex that provide direct access to a view of the runway and approach zones and
          have appropriate safety features satisfy this requirement. Weather observing locations
          in base operations are normally combined with the base weather station for cost
          efficiency. NOTE: The Federal Interdepartmental Committee for Meteorological
          Services, Subcommittee for Aviation Meteorological Service (SC/AMS) defines the
          ideal site for representative weather observations for aircraft arrivals and departures.
          2.4.9.5.3. Locate to satisfy explosives safety standards in relationship to other flight
          line explosives storage and operating facilities. Noise attenuation measures are
          required due to the proximity of this facility to the runway. Factors to consider in site
          selection are climatology, available structures, length of weather equipment cable
          runs, and communications requirements
          2.4.9.5.4. Obtain further information from Air Force Flight Standards Agency,
          Director of Airfield/ATC Standards (AFFSA/A3A). Obtain further information for
          weather forecasting and observation information portion of base operations through
          AFWA/A5/8 or MAJCOM A3 weather staff.
          2.4.9.5.5. Underground connectivity to weather sensing equipment (on and off the
          airfield) supporting the airfield, Non-Secure Internet Protocol Router Network
          (NIPRNet) connections to the Global Information Grid (GIG) and weather observing
          equipment, Worldwide Class A DSN/land line connections, and direct/dedicated
          phone lines to air traffic control facilities supporting the installation.
          2.4.9.5.6. The requirement for emergency power is determined under AFI 32-1063.
          Provide stable electrical power 220 VAC and 110 VAC/60 Hz with backup power
          capability.

      2.4.10.1. Description. This facility provides space for one or two people with
      appropriate equipment for munitions movement control.
      2.4.10.2. Requirements Determination. This facility is required only at installations
      that expend ordnance in such large quantities that a control point is needed close to the
      flight line. The facility should be programmed only if the magnitude, nature, and
      diversity of ordnance handling justify it and if other facilities cannot provide the required
      space.
      2.4.10.3. Scope Determination. This facility should be near a roadway used for moving
      munitions. It is normally adjacent to a paved area which can be used as a staging area. A
      view of most of the flight line is also highly desirable.
      2.4.10.4. Dimensions. This facility is 251 m2 (2,700 ft2).
      2.4.10.5. Design Considerations. Locate facility to comply with explosive safety
      standards. Lightning protection must be provided except when it would interfere with
      safety of flight operations. An electrical grounding system may be required as determined
      by the using organization.

      2.4.12.1. Description. This facility provides space for operations, crew quarters, and
      recreation for strategic bomber and tanker forces.
      2.4.12.2. Requirements Determination.
         2.4.12.2.1. Strategic Bomber and Tanker Alert Crew Facilities. Air alert crews
         and supporting ground crews are on duty from 24 to 168 hours. The facility needs a
         separate room for operational support so that operational materials can remain ready
         for use in a room that can be secured when not in use. Operational areas include
         administrative, operational study and mission planning areas, a projection room, and a
         briefing room. Crew quarters include sleep and study rooms, bathrooms, laundry,
         lounge, kitchen, and dining rooms. Recreational space includes a library and a hobby,
         exercise, and game room.
         2.4.12.2.2. Tactical Air Defense Forces and High-Threat Area. Tactical air
         defense crews are on duty 24 to 48 hours. Tactical air defense facilities in high-threat
         areas include operational areas (if the crew exceeds six persons), crew quarters, and
         recreational space. Operational functional requirements are determined by
         MAJCOM/A3O-A. Crew quarters include sleep, study, kitchen, dining, and bathroom
         facilities. Recreational space includes only a lounge and game room. Crew facilities
         must be near alert aircraft so that crews can be airborne within the required time after
         the scramble order.
      2.4.12.3. Scope Determination.
         2.4.12.3.1. Table 2.18 shows space requirements for strategic bomber and tanker
         alert crews in net square feet based on three crew sizes: small crews (fewer than 50
         personnel), medium crews (50 to 80), and large crews (more than 80). Net floor area
         is defined in Chapter 1 of this Manual. Central bathrooms in crew quarters have a
         separate net area.
AFMAN32-1084 20 APRIL 2012                                                                          103


          2.4.12.3.2. Space requirements for air defense or high-threat areas are provided for
          four to six crew members, male and female. Each member has a private sleeping and
          study room. The kitchen/dining room may be omitted if other dining facilities are
          available.
          2.4.12.3.3. Compatible component areas may be combined into one or more multi-
          purpose rooms to reduce space requirements.
      2.4.12.4. Dimensions. See Table 2.18.
      2.4.12.5. Design Considerations. Crew readiness facilities are conventionally
      constructed; blast hardening is not required for CONUS locations. Hardened structures
      are authorized for high-threat areas. Because these facilities are close to the flight line,
      noise attenuation measures and fuel vapor and exhaust filtration are necessary. Utility
      systems should include sufficient redundancy to stay operational 24 hours per day, during
      equipment maintenance and contingencies. Locate facility to comply with explosive
      safety standards. Obtain further guidance through MAJCOM/A3O/A7.

      one of these facilities must be justified in terms of efficiency and economy. Obtain
      further guidance through MAJCOM/A3O/A7.
      2.4.13.3. Scope Determination. Space requirements are determined by the number of
      building occupants and the size and number of special purpose rooms. Space criteria for
      administrative facilities apply. Command posts may include space for base operations,
      maintenance training, maintenance analysis, quality control, records storage, and
      appropriate functions.
         2.4.13.3.1. High-threat areas. Storage space should be allocated for chemical and
         biological filtering equipment, food and water, chemical detection equipment,
         mobility equipment, chemical-warfare defense ensembles, pressurized air locks, and
         other shelter-essential equipment in high-threat areas.
         2.4.13.3.2. Headquarters (MAJCOM) and Wing Command Posts. Space must be
         provided for entry control point personnel.
         2.4.13.3.3. Components of the USAF command post are not reported under
         CATCODE 141461 unless they are in the USAF command post. For example,
         intelligence offices located in the Group Headquarters (CATCODE 610243), and
         weather offices located in Base Operations (CATCODE 141453) are not reported
         under CATCODE 141461.
      2.4.13.4. Dimensions. Refer to Chapter 6 of this Manual for office and special purpose
      space standards.
      2.4.13.5. Design Considerations. An uninterruptible power supply (UPS) is necessary
      to maintain operational capability. Semi-hardened, splinter-protected, and hardened
      construction criteria may apply.

      2.4.14.1. Description. This building is a main control point for all unit flight and flying
      training tasks including planning, briefing, administration, and critique of combat crews.
      The Squadron Operations provides an organized operation facility for each flying
      squadron to carry out its mission.
      2.4.14.2. Requirements Determination. Each squadron needs an operational building
      for administration, scheduling, training, briefing, personal equipment maintenance, and
      storage for aircrews. High-threat areas require additional design considerations to ensure
      facility and personnel survivability during hostile events. The North Atlantic Treaty
      Organization (NATO) may have additional criteria for tactical and transport airfields.
      Submit projects for unlisted missions, squadron types, or additional space requirements
      through the MAJCOM/A3/A7 to AF/A3O-A.
AFMAN32-1084 20 APRIL 2012                                                                    107


     2.4.14.3. Scope Determination. Space must be provided for the commander and staff.
     Crew training records are prepared and updated with other required squadron records.
     Space is required for aircrew flight equipment systems maintenance and the care, storage,
     and issue of flying clothing and equipment for each crew member. Equipment includes
     parachutes, survival kits, life rafts, anti-exposure suits, arctic clothing, life preservers,
     transceiver radios, mobility equipment, helmets, and oxygen masks. Space is required for
     an operations officer to direct flight operations and also for intelligence, mission
     planning, computers, radar and navigation, cruise control, photos and maps, briefing
     room, locker area, and radio and electronic countermeasures.
        2.4.14.3.1. Aircrew Flight Equipment Shop. This shop works on parachutes,
        flotation equipment, and the repair and manufacture of fabric items. Flotation
        equipment includes life rafts, life preservers, and emergency escape slides carried
        aboard aircraft that may make over water flights. Facility provides space for
        parachute inspection, packing, washing, drying, repair, chemical cleaning and
        fabrication. It also provides space for survival/flotation equipment storage (if
        required), inspection, inflation, and repacking.
            2.4.14.3.1.1. Provide space for parachutes and flotation equipment that must be
            periodically inflated, inspected, and repacked and where survival items and
            accessories are concurrently inspected.
            2.4.14.3.1.2. A large room equipped with long tables for inspecting and
            repacking parachutes is the core of the survival equipment shop. The number of
            tables needed largely determines the space requirement for the shop (see Table
            2.20). Provide the following spaces:
                2.4.14.3.1.2.1. Personnel parachute inspection and packing room;

               equipment are 40 square feet per aircrew member assigned. (EXAMPLE: 20 PAI
               unit @1.5 crew ratio = 150 aircrew members x 40 sf2 = 6,000 ft2 total
               ([20x(1.5x5)=150 150x40=6,000]). See Table 2.21.
               2.4.14.3.2.2. Search and Rescue Aircrew Alternate Insertion and Extraction
               (AIE) Equipment Storage, Cleaning, Rinsing, Inspection, and Drying (SCRID)
               requires 300 ft2 covered area to clean; rinse, inspect, and ―flat dry‖ recently
               utilized equipment. Area must be able to house at least two industrial wash basins,
               and two 10-foot long tables for flat drying recently rinsed equipment. See Table
               2.21.
       2.4.14.4. Dimensions. Table 2.19 lists space requirements for squadron operations. See
       Tables 2.19 and 2.20 for centralized aircrew flight equipment space requirements and
       Table 2.21 for Search and Rescue space requirements. Additional space may be
       authorized in high-threat areas for chemical and biological filters in the mechanical room,
       donning and doffing areas in air locks, chemical warfare defense ensemble (CWDE), and
       aircrew ensemble locker rooms, crew quarters, and subsistence supplies.
       2.4.14.5. Design Considerations.
            2.4.14.5.1. Locate to satisfy explosives safety standards in relationship to other flight
            line explosives storage and operating facilities. Special Q-D standards apply to
            hardened facilities; see AFMAN 91-201.
            2.4.14.5.2. Buildings used by fighter squadrons and fighter interceptor squadrons
            require special construction for storage areas used for personnel parachutes packed
            with ballistic deployment devices. These storage areas must meet the requirements of
            AFI 31-101 for non-nuclear munitions. These requirements include masonry walls,
            steel doors, and heavy screening on door grills, windows, and duct openings.
            2.4.14.5.3. Buildings in high-threat areas must be designed to operate during hostile
            events. Special design considerations may be necessary such as hardening exterior
            walls, chemical warfare filtration, over-pressurization, and additional storage space.

  NOTES:

  1. Space needs for units supporting aircrew flight equipment differ depending on mobility
  requirements. Consider whether a unit has full, partial, or no mobility requirements in
  determining equipment storage and servicing needs.

  2. Determine the number of tables for a single unit shop (or for each unit in a multi-unit
  shop). Space allowances for personnel parachutes not based on the following equation
  must be justified:

   Number of tables for personnel parachutes = Number of personnel parachutes on base x 3

                                                        88 work days per IPI x 8 hours per day

  Where:

   4 = The average number of hours required to inspect and repack each ACES II personnel

        parachute.

   IPI = The inspection and repacking interval -120 days.

   If supporting Combat Controllers or Pararescue, add 65 m2 (700 ft2) per table to the gross
   area for the square parachute packing table.

  3. Space allowances for deceleration parachutes is based on the following equation:

  Number of tables for deceleration parachutes =

                                    Number of deceleration parachutes used per month x 1.02

                                                22 work days per month x 8 hours per day

  Where:

   The number of deceleration parachutes used per month = the base average for a 6 month
 112                                                           AFMAN32-1084 20 APRIL 2012


            period, extrapolated to the end position time period.

    1.02 = a factor to compensate for alerts, generations, other exercises, and for deceleration

            parachutes returned wet or repacked more than 60 days ago.

    If supporting B-52 deceleration chutes, add 64 m2 (688 ft2) per table to the gross area to
    support the 27.4 m (90 ft) long packing table.

    If supporting Drones, add 161 m2 (1,731 ft2) per table to the gross area to support the
    53.9 m (177 ft) long packing table.

            FAC: 1412
AFMAN32-1084 20 APRIL 2012                                                                   113

     2.4.16.1. Description. An observing site is a designated location on an airfield where
     weather elements are observed and reported.
     2.4.16.2. Requirements Determination.
        2.4.16.2.1. The Federal Interdepartmental Committee for Meteorological Services,
        Subcommittee for Aviation Meteorological Services (SC/AMS) established standards
        for observing sites to ensure representative weather observations for aircraft arrivals
        and departures. The ideal site is at the airport reference point, the geometric center of
        the airport landing area. An observing site should be as close to the airport reference
        point as possible and, except in unusual cases, no more than 3.2 km (2 mi) away. The
        observing site should allow appropriate exposure of observing sensors and visual
        observation of weather elements that affect the airfield. Site selection considerations
        include climatology, available structures, length of weather-equipment cable runs,
        and communications requirements.
        2.4.16.2.2. At airfields requiring continuous weather observations, the observing site
        is classified as a representative observation site (ROS) and staffed by an observer
        dedicated to that task alone. The ROS may be in an existing Air Traffic Control
        Tower (CATCODE 149962) or in a separate building or existing building space
        identified as a Surface Weather Observing Facility (CATCODE 141629). The ROS
        should provide an unrestricted view of the most frequently used runway and its
        approaches and at least half of each quadrant of the natural horizon.
        2.4.16.2.3. At airfields that do not require continuous weather observations, the
        observing site is normally located in Base Operations (CATCODE 141453) or in
        another existing building designated as a Surface Weather Observing Facility
        (CATCODE 141629). In both locations, windows must face the runway complex,
        and the observer must have direct access to a point that provides a view of the runway
        and approach zones. The observing point or platform and its access should have
        appropriate safety features. Base operations sites incorporated with the base weather
        station are the most cost-effective.
     2.4.16.3. Scope Determination.
        2.4.16.3.1. Functional Requirements. Space for an observing site includes an
        observers' work area; installed weather communications equipment to compute,
        display, and record weather data; weather equipment maintenance; and supplies.
        2.4.16.3.2. Spatial Requirements. Space requirements vary according to local
        operational requirements. An ROS requires a space at least 6.1 m x 6.1 m (20 ft x 20
        ft). In the control tower, the ROS may share space in the tower cab or occupy a room
        on a lower floor. (See Air Traffic Control Tower, CATCODE 149962).
     2.4.16.4. Dimensions. See paragraph 2.4.16.3 above.

         See AFI 32-1063.
         2.4.16.5.2. Provide connectivity with on- and off-base weather sensors; base LAN
         connectivity to the GIG and connected weather sensors; dedicated land lines to base
         operations; air traffic control facilities; and a DSN Class A worldwide phone line.

      2.4.17.1. Description. This facility provides space for command, 24-hour war fighter
      reach back operations, planning, and training for Operational Weather Squadrons (OWS).
      2.4.17.2. Requirements Determination. PAD 97-10 drove the stand-up of OWSs
      worldwide. These squadrons provide airfield aviation forecasts; weather watches,
      warnings, and advisories; and flight weather briefings to all Air Force and Army
      locations in their area of responsibility. Space for administration, weather operations, and
      forecasting areas are required for the New Tactical Forecast System (NTFS), which
      includes Communications/Data management, Weather Station Terminals, and Staff
      Weather Officer Terminals; Weather Radar (WSR-88D) Open Principal User Processor
      Terminal (some weather stations will also have a Unit Control Position); desktop
      computers for receipt and display of satellite and radar data; and spatial requirements as

      2.4.18.1. Description.
         2.4.18.1.1. The Battlefield Weather (BW) squadron provides space for command,
         operations, planning, training, and maintenance (equipment and vehicle) activities, as
         well an armory for Battlefield Weather forces supporting modular Army operations.
         2.4.18.1.2. The BW detachment provides operational, administrative, maintenance,
         and storage space for BW organizations below squadron level. The term
AFMAN32-1084 20 APRIL 2012                                                                 117


        ―detachment‖ refers to any below-squadron BW organization. This can include, but is
        not limited to, BW detachments, operating locations, and liaison offices operating on
        Army installations.
     2.4.18.2. Requirements Determination. Obtain            further   information     through
     AFWA/A5/8 or MAJCOM A3 weather staff.
        2.4.18.2.1. PAD 06-05, Tactical Air Control Party (TACP), Air Support Operations
        Center (ASOC), and BW Integration with the Modular Army drove the stand-up of
        BW squadrons on Army installations. The facility should be programmed if the Army
        cannot fulfill their required facility obligations per AFJI 15-157, Weather Support for
        the US Army. Space is required for the NTFS, which includes Communications/Data
        management, Weather Station Terminals, and Staff Weather Officer Terminals;
        Weather Radar (WSR88D) –Open Principal User Processor Terminal (some weather
        stations will also have a Unit Control Position); desktop computers for receipt and
        display of satellite and radar data; and spatial requirements as outlined below.
        2.4.18.2.2. The BW detachment requirements are based on the number of personnel
        assigned to the organization and the span of their operational responsibility. Though
        the guidance listed in Table 2.24.1 falls into two categories, small (~15 personnel)
        and large (~25 personnel), specific space requirements for portions of the structures
        will be modified/assessed to accommodate actual manning as noted.
     2.4.18.3. Scope Determination. Table 2.24 lists space requirements for BW squadron
     operations. Table 2.24.1 provides space requirements for BW detachment operations.
     Space is required for a command section, operations management, operations areas,
     training classrooms, multipurpose/seminar, storage for CWDE, individual combat
     equipment, HAZMAT, CCI, tactical meteorological equipment, combat support
     equipment, subsistence supplies, weapons, locker/shower rooms, fitness facilities, and
     equipment and vehicle maintenance bays.
     2.4.18.4. Dimensions. See Chapter 6 of this Manual and Tables 2.24 and 2.24.1 below.
     2.4.18.5. Design Considerations.
        2.4.18.5.1. Requires 220 VAC/115 VAC, 60 Hz service with backup power and UPS.
        See AFI 32-1063.
        2.4.18.5.2. Provide connectivity with on- and off-base weather sensors; base LAN
        connectivity to GIG and connected weather sensors; dedicated land lines to base
        operations; air traffic control facilities; and a DSN Class A worldwide phone line.
        2.4.18.5.3. Locate to satisfy explosives safety standards in relationship to other
        explosives storage and operating facilities. Noise attenuation measures are required if
        located in close proximity to runway(s) or industrial area(s).

      2.4.21.1. Description. The photo laboratory provides photography and other visual
      services to support management, information, and operational functions of base
      organizations, including tenants.
      2.4.21.2. Requirements Determination. Work performed in the laboratory includes
      still photography and processing in color and black-and-white film, still-film printing in
      black and white, and production of slides, viewgraphs, photostats, and diazos. A
      laboratory supporting an upper-echelon headquarters may provide additional services
      such as still-film printing in color. A laboratory supporting an armament-recording
      function processes and prints 70 mm strike photograph film and processes motion picture
      gun-camera film. The laboratory does not perform photographic tasks that are the
      responsibility of reconnaissance laboratories, special mission laboratories, or the
      Audiovisual Facility (CATCODE 141383).
      2.4.21.3. Scope Determination.
         2.4.21.3.1. Three sizes of laboratories are designated: Type A for ten to 19 personnel,
         Type B for five to nine personnel, and Type C for one to four personnel. Table 2.27
         shows the space requirements for each type.
         2.4.21.3.2. The laboratory may be combined with CATCODE 141383 to create an
         audiovisual services center.
         2.4.21.3.3. A graphic arts shop may be combined with a base photo laboratory if the
         shop cannot be incorporated in CATCODE 141383. Combining the graphic arts shop
         with the laboratory reduces the graphic arts space requirements by at least 15 percent
         by consolidating support space. Graphic arts shop space in a photo laboratory is
         identified under CATCODE 141383.
      2.4.21.4. Dimensions. See Table 2.27 below.
      2.4.21.5. Design Considerations.
         2.4.21.5.1. Silver recovery equipment or apparatus should be included as an
         equipment item in the process operation to meet CWA requirements. If it is not
         included, collection and recovery facilities must be provided as an initial stage to any
         collection, treatment, and disposal (of silver) process.
         2.4.21.5.2. All photo laboratory facilities must control potential water, air, and
         hazardous waste pollutants generated by photographic processing and film
         destruction. If redesigning or modifying the process is not possible, adequate
         collection, treatment, and disposal facilities must be provided as integral components
         of the photo laboratory to meet compliance requirements contained in all applicable
         federal, state, and local environmental laws, and other guidance as defined in
         paragraphs 1.3.1 and 1.8.6. If hazardous chemicals are used, an approved eye wash
         and emergency shower may be required. Contact installation ground safety for
         assistance.
AFMAN32-1084 20 APRIL 2012                                                                    127


          2.4.21.5.3. A review by the base fire marshal is required to determine if special fire
          protection is needed due to the chemicals and other potentially flammable materials
          used during processing.

           administration/working area; and (5) the facility must be logistically located in an
           area that will ease access to rail/truck/air modes of shipments.
           2.4.25.3.11. Surface Freight/Packing and Crating Facility provides space for
           receiving, sorting, accumulating and processing conveyable and non-conveyable
           inbound and outbound freight. The processing area must provide sufficient space to
           prepare, package, process, and temporarily store freight of all kinds, including
           classified and hazardous, compatible and non-compatible. Floor space must be
           adequate for the safe operation of power saws, banding and wrapping equipment, etc.,
           as well as for a tool crib and storage of lumber, cardboard boxes, and other bench
           stock items. This facility is normally collocated with, or in close proximity to, the
           Warehouse Supply and Equipment Warehouse (CATCODE 442758). Space
           requirements must include sufficient room to safely operate materials handling
           equipment, as well as for loading docks with dock levelers for loading and off-
           loading commercial/military trucks.
        2.4.25.4. Dimensions. Space requirements are shown in Table 2.28. To calculate
        allowable terminal space, choose the four months when the greatest number of total
        passengers (inbound plus outbound) passed through the terminal (do not count exercise
        troops not processed through the terminal). Identify 35 peak, 3-hour passenger loads for
        arrivals, and 35 peak, 3-hour passenger loads for departures during the four months. Rank
        order the 3-hour loads. Using the 35th peak-period number from both lists, add the
        arrivals and departures to get the design peak 3-hour load. All new terminals and terminal
        additions operated by AMC must have a conceptual planning study and AMC/A4/A7
        approval before being sized.
        2.4.25.5. Design Considerations. Open storage space should be provided around the
        facility for baggage handling, an Aircraft Support Equipment Storage Yard (CATCODE
        852273), Non-organization Vehicle Parking (CATCODE 852262) for privately owned
        vehicles, and concessions (Category Groups 74 and 75). For additional guidance, see the
        AMC Passenger Terminal Facility Design Guide.

      2.4.26.1. Description. This facility provides space for receiving and processing
      personnel and baggage.
      2.4.26.2. Requirements Determination. A deployment processing facility is needed at
      any installation charged with deploying personnel and equipment in support of
      deployment taskings. AFI 10-403, Deployment Planning and Execution, establishes
      procedures to deploy units with a mobility commitment. Six deployment work centers are
      included for passenger and equipment processing.
      2.4.26.3. Scope Determination. A typical facility provides space for receiving and
      processing personnel and baggage, baggage pallet build-up, counseling, passenger
      processing, briefing, holding, miscellaneous space such as restrooms, and a vending area.
      In addition, space is required for a Cargo Deployment Function (CDF) and Personnel
      Deployment Function (PDF) to include a Deployment Control Center (DCC),
      Transportation Control Unit (TCU), Air Passenger Terminal (APT), Air Cargo Terminal
      (ACT), and Sub-Motor Pool (SMP). See AFI 10-402, Vol. 1, Mobilization Planning and
      Personnel Readiness, and AFI 10-403. An Airlift Control Element (ALCE) may also be
      required.
      2.4.26.4. Dimensions. The minimum gross area required for passenger processing is 5.6
      m2 (60 ft2) per passenger handled at peak workload. The minimum gross area required for
      control functions associated with execution of mobility operations (DCC, TCU, DPU,
      APT, ACT, SMP) is 7.4 m2 (80 ft2) per person. The placement and arrangement of the
      work center may be varied to satisfy local needs.
      2.4.26.5. Design Considerations. Adequate access and egress must be allowed for
      passenger busses, cargo trucks, and handling of mobility A, B, and C bags and personal
      bags. The APT and ACT do not have to be collocated, but should be close to improve
      command, control, and communication.

      2.4.31.1. Description. Consists of a primary suite of weather sensors and processor(s)
      capable of collecting, measuring, and reporting the following parameters for air traffic
      control operations: Wind speed and direction, temperature and dew point, visibility, cloud
      height, present weather, precipitation amount, lightning, and freezing precipitation. For
      airfields requiring additional weather sensors, one or more additional discontinuity sensor
      suites may be installed. A discontinuity sensor suite consists of weather sensors and
      processor(s) capable of collecting, measuring, and reporting the following parameters:
      Wind speed and direction, visibility, and cloud height.
      2.4.31.2. Requirements Determination. One Field Data Collection Unit (FDCU) is
      authorized at each facility; however, some airfields require two or more FDCUs if the
      aerodrome has two or more instrumented approaches or has terrain anomalies. One
      Operator Interface Devices (OID) is required for each location. Typical locations are the
      weather station and Meteorological Equipment and Navigational Aids (METNAV). One
      Terminal Data Acquisition Unit (TDAU) is required for each airfield. Obtain further
      information through AFWA/A5/8 or MAJCOM A3 weather staff.
      2.4.31.3. Scope Determination. The weather sensors are sited where they will best
      measure vital weather data representative of the touchdown area of a runway or helipad.
      The primary sensor suite and the discontinuity suite must be located approximately 152
      m (500 ft) from centerline of the runway and approximately 229 m to 305 m (750 ft to
      1,000 ft) from the designated runway threshold. The sensor suite should be parallel to the
      runway with the closest sensor 152 m (500 ft) from the centerline. Locating sensors more
      than 152 m (500 ft) from the centerline of the runway provides data less representative of
      the runway and could have a negative effect on aviation operations. A concrete pad and
      underground cabling and conduit are needed to support the mounting masts for the
      equipment, communication, and power requirements and FDCU. The TDAU is located in
      the Weather Observation Site (CATCODE 141629, 141453, or 149962). The TDAU
      provides a permanent record of all weather data reported from the FDCUs. The OID is
      mounted in the weather observation site, airfield maintenance facilities and in aircraft
      control facilities such as RAPCON and the air traffic control tower.
      2.4.31.4. Dimensions. Quantitative requirements are determined through the results of
      site surveys and coordinated with the use of Project Support Agreements (PSA). The
      standard facility requirement will also be outlined and coordinated through the PSA
      vehicle. A typical site primary sensor location needs an area 20 ft x 40 ft long to
      accommodate the space needed for the concrete pads and grounding system. If additional
      sensors are required for discontinuity requirements, the space requirements may be
      smaller.

      awareness. Obtain further information through AFWA/A5/8 or MAJCOM/A3 weather
      staff.
      2.4.38.3. Scope Determination. A NEXION site consists of a support building
      consisting of approximately 5 m2 (50 ft2), four receiving antennas placed in a triangular
      60 degree configuration 60 m (197 ft) apart with #2 and #3 antennas aligned to magnetic
      north, and the #1 antenna centered between antennas #2 and #3 but physically located
      34.64 m (114 ft) to the west of antenna #4. See Figure 2.2 for alignment and placement.
      Distance between the transmit tower and receiver antennas is 30 m (98.4 ft) minimum
      separation. The transmit antenna must have 15.24 m (50 ft) clearance between the
      transmit antenna and potential obstructions such as trees, shrubs, etc. The transmit
      antenna will be approximately 100 ft high. NEXION collects local ionosphere
      measurements using a transmitter that sweeps through the medium and high frequency
      radio bands (0.5-30 MHz). Each NEXION system consists of one desktop 4-D system
      (with monitor and key board), four active crossed loops turnstile receive antennas, and
      one transmit tower with two orthogonal radiating elements.
      2.4.38.4. Dimensions. A NEXION antenna field requires approximately one acre of
      land for the system. The support building requires environmental controls with a
      Heating, Ventilating, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system and contains a desktop 4-D
      system with keyboard and monitor and a UPS with associated system equipment.

         switch for the NEXION unit will be located near the main entrance that will be
         labeled and protected by a cover to prevent accidental shut-off. The system also
         requires automatic voltage control for the power source feeding the NEXION DPS-
         4D unit with a UPS system. The requirement for emergency power is determined
         under AFI 32-1063.
         2.4.38.5.3. Special Features. NEXION sites require non-metallic fencing to
         preclude electronic interference. Site/facility security ensures only authorized
         personnel with a need-to-know are granted physical access to computing facilities
         that house the NEXION DPS-4D unit. The facility requires controlled access during
         working hours and should be locked during non-work hours. A fire suppression
         system is required with a local and remote fire activation and alarm capability.

   2.4.39. Mark IVB (UMQ-13) (NEW Requirement).
         FAC: 1341

         CATCODE: 149XX8

         OPR: AFWA/A5/A8, MAJCOM/A3W

         OCR: MAJCOM/A6

      2.4.39.1. Description. MARK IVB (UMQ-13) is a 24/7 unmanned meteorological
      satellite (METSAT) direct readout (DRO) system. Four versions are fielded or in
      development. The legacy baseline system has a 17 ft geostationary and 10 ft dual
      polar/geostationary L-S band METSAT antennas, both domed. Depending on site
      obstructions, the 10 ft antenna may require a tower. Primary indoor processing equipment
      includes the satellite data acquisition system (SDAS), ingest data processor/server,
      maintenance computer, and network data server. Users worldwide access the network
      data server directly via NIPRNet common user communications using MARK IVB
      Forecaster Application Software (FAS), which also provides robust imagery analysis
      capability. SIPRNet users also employ FAS to access data re-hosted on Mirrored Data
      Servers (MDS) located at data centers. Six DRO systems located throughout the world
      provide global geostationary coverage and extensive polar coverage. The V1 upgrade
      (scheduled for initial operational capability in November 2009) adds X-Band and dual L-
      S band polar ingest capability by incorporating a domed 3 meter X-L-S band antenna
      mounted on a 20 ft tower, an X-band RF receiver and upgraded server H/W and S/W. It
      will be fielded at legacy MARK IVB sites. The V2 upgrade is a polar-only system with
      dual 3 ft or 4.6 ft (site selectable) L-S and 3 meter X-L-S band antennas, and indoor
      equipment common with the equivalent V1 suite (i.e., geostationary antenna indoor
      equipment is removed). The V3 upgrade, IOC TBD, is a polar-only system with a single

       3 ft or 4.6-ft site selectable L-S band antenna and the required suite of common indoor
       equipment.
       2.4.39.2. Requirements Determination. The MARK IVB provides real-time METSAT
       imagery and model input data that directly supports all DoD services’ wartime mission
       execution, resource protection, and training missions worldwide; national agencies, and
       other U.S. Government agencies including the U.S. Forest Service and the NWS. Obtain
       further information through AFWA/A5/8 or MAJCOM/A3 weather staff.
       2.4.39.3. Scope Determination. The geostationary antennas require an unobstructed
       equator-facing view to the site’s primary and secondary assigned geostationary
       METSAT. The polar antennas require a 360 degree unobstructed view (5 degree
       elevation angle threshold, 0 degree objective). The indoor equipment requires a normal
       temperature controlled electronic equipment environment.
       2.4.39.4. Dimensions. The legacy antenna equipment requires an approximately 46 m
       (150 ft) x 21 m (70 ft) fenced compound. The V1 requires an approximately 67 m (220 ft)
       x 21 m (70 ft) fenced compound. The V2 requires an approximately 40 m (130 ft) x 15 m
       (50 ft) fenced compound. The V3 requires an approximately 6.1 m (20 ft) x 6.1.m (20 ft)
       fenced compound.
       2.4.39.5. Design Considerations.
          2.4.39.5.1. Communications Requirements. One 12-strand dedicated single-mode
          fiber optic cable is required from the MARK IVB antenna location to the indoor
          equipment location. The site network server and the user computer hosting FAS
          software require common user access to NIPRNet. Classified data users and the MDS
          software host require common user access to SIPRNet. Additionally, the MDS host
          requires NIPRNet connectivity to MARK IVB site(s) and a TGS (or alternative cross-
          domain) path to the high side server provided by the MDS site.
          2.4.39.5.2. Special Features. Site/facility security must ensure only authorized
          personnel are granted physical access to antenna sites. Site/facility security must
          ensure only authorized personnel with a need-to-know are granted physical access to
          computing facilities that house the MARK IVB indoor processing equipment which
          includes COMSEC equipment. The computing facility will be locked and alarmed
          with features sufficient to meet unattended COMSEC storage requirements. A fire
          suppression system is required for the indoor equipment with a local and remote fire
          activation and alarm capability.
          2.4.39.5.3. Power Requirements. MARK IVB power requirements are specified in
          Table 2.29 below. The requirement for emergency power is determined under AFI
          32-1063.

          booms. Necessary quick boat launching capability is also required. The storage
          structure will be located as close to the fuel loading or unloading facilities as possible.
          Use Petroleum Operations Building (CATCODE 121111) for reporting purposes.
          The facilities shall also comply with local, state, and federal requirements in respect
          to fuel vapor emissions, as required by AFI 32-7040, and other guidance as defined in
          paragraphs 1.3.1 and 1.8.6.
2.7. Category Group 17, Training Facilities.
   2.7.1. General Guidance. The following guidance applies to all facility requirements
   described in this chapter that involve lecture or seminar classrooms, and all classroom
   requirements identified under operational facilities described elsewhere in this manual.
       2.7.1.1. The term "classroom" is included in the official nomenclature of only two
       facilities: Technical Training Classroom (CATCODE 171621) and Flying Training
       Classroom (CATCODE 171211). However, most of the facilities listed in this chapter
       include some classroom space. Classrooms are also included in some "non-training"
       facilities (see list in paragraph 2.7.1.3). Many training programs include instruction
       outside of the classroom and, therefore, classrooms designated for particular programs
       are often available for part-time use by other programs. The latter may include segments
       of major training programs or any of the variety of smaller training programs that require
       intermittent use of space.
       2.7.1.2. To achieve maximum utilization of existing classroom space and to ensure that
       any space acquisitions are thoroughly justified, training program managers should
       coordinate their plans and schedules so as to define a base-wide facility requirement for
       lecture and seminar classrooms. To determine the base-wide requirements and
       deficiencies, a three-step approach should be used:
          2.7.1.2.1. Step One establishes the desired learning environment. This involves a
          detailed analysis of curricula, student loads, group sizes, training schedules, security
          requirements, telecommunications requirements, and desired student proximity.
          2.7.1.2.2. Step Two translates this desired learning environment into specific facility
          requirements. This involves determining the ideal combination of rooms and students
AFMAN32-1084 20 APRIL 2012                                                                   153


        per room which will provide the highest rate of occupancy compatible with the
        training to be accomplished.
        2.7.1.2.3. Step Three establishes facility deficiencies. This involves identifying all
        facility assets and defining their capabilities for satisfying the requirements
        established under the preceding steps.
     2.7.1.3. In identifying facility assets under step three above, do not overlook lecture
     classroom space that may be available for part time use in certain "non-training" facilities
     such as Aerial Delivery Facility (CATCODE 141232), Squadron Operations
     (CATCODE 141753), Base Supply Administration (CATCODE 610122), Base
     Personnel Office (CATCODE 610128), Depot Operations Logistical Facility
     (CATCODE 610675), Security Forces Operations (CATCODE 730835), and Education
     Center (CATCODE 730441). Conference room space in various headquarters facilities
     (CATCODE 6102XX) should also be considered.
     2.7.1.4. Space allowances for lecture classrooms are given in Table 6.4 in Chapter 6.
     The criteria apply to rooms furnished with fixed tablet arm chairs or chairs and narrow
     tables occupying comparable space. The instructor station contains only enough space for
     small portable training aids. For types of instruction that require more area per seat than
     Table 6.4 allows, space criteria are established on the basis of individual training
     programs. In the interest of economy, space per seat should be the minimum compatible
     with the desired learning environment.
  2.7.2. Band Center.

       CATCODE: 171158

       OPR: SAF/PA

       OCR: N/A

     2.7.2.1. Description. This facility provides space for the operation and administration of
     a band and its musical units.
     2.7.2.2. Requirements Determination. Each Air Force Band is divided into several
     musical units that rehearse and perform simultaneously. The band center shall include the
     following.
        2.7.2.2.1. Acoustically Treated Rehearsal Studios and Individual Practice
        Rooms. All required band elements should be able to practice at the same time in
        different rooms. The size of each rehearsal studio is to be determined by the number
        of participants, type of music to be rehearsed, and additional space as required to
        achieve proper acoustical feedback. Studios shall not be designed as a performance
        space to accommodate spectators.
        2.7.2.2.2. Music Library. This is a secure storage area for musical instruments and
        supplies; separate lockers, dressing rooms, and restrooms for men and women; and an
        acoustically treated room for an arranger.

          2.7.2.2.3. Administrative Space. This space has separate offices for the
          commander, deputy commander (if authorized), band manager, first sergeant,
          operations section, and administrative support personnel. Consult Chapter 6 on
          approved office types and sizes.
          2.7.2.2.4. Acoustically Treated Training Room. Requirements implemented
          through the new Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) rely on machines
          and interactive computers to measure rhythmic and pitch accuracy, utilizing
          headphones, microphones, and listening devices. Auditions for program accessions
          and testing for upgrade training also require this room to be acoustically treated.
       2.7.2.3. Scope Determination. Space requirements will be determined by the number of
       performing groups and the size of the band. Reference AFI 35-101, Public Affairs
       Policies and Procedures, for further information.
       2.7.2.4. Dimensions. Minimum space requirements are shown in Table 2.31 below.

     2.7.8.4. Dimensions. See ETL 11-18.
     2.7.8.5. Design Considerations.
        2.7.8.5.1. The goal of the new Air Force small arms training philosophy is to increase
        the current 25 meter standard target distance and expand the diversity of training that
        can be accomplished on the range. Ranges should be designed to allow the greatest
        target distance possible within the available land at the site (e.g., 50 m, 100 m, 300 m,
        1,000 m). The desired target distance is at, or as close as possible, to the sight zero
        distance for the weapon.
        2.7.8.5.2. Design the range to control heavy metals and/or dust produced at both the
        21 muzzle, ejection port of the weapon, bullet trap, and from the ventilation exhaust
        to ensure compliance with local, state, and federal regulations. Review NMCPHC-
        TM 6290.10, Indoor Firing Ranges Industrial Hygiene Technical Guide, and
        AFMAN 48-155, Occupational and Environmental Health Exposure Controls. ETL
        11-18 for additional guidance.
        2.7.8.5.3. The ventilation system must control exposure to lead and heavy metals in
        accordance with 29 CFR 1910.1025, Lead. See ETL 11-18 for additional guidance.
        2.7.8.5.4. See 11-18 for additional design criteria.

       OCR: 575 CBSS/ WR-ALC, AFCEE/TDR, AFCESA/CEOA

     2.7.9.1. Description. This building supports the activities of a CA section.
     2.7.9.2. Requirements Determination. This contains space for classroom instruction,
     program administration and weapons maintenance, weapons cleaning and degreasing,
     alarmed weapons and ammunition storage, latrine facilities, and miscellaneous storage. It
     is used in conjunction with a ground weapons range system.
     2.7.9.3. Scope Determination. The basic facility supports a Small Arms Range System,
     (CATCODE 179475) with up to 21 firing points. The minimum net space requirement is
     167 m2 (1,800 ft2). (See ETL 11-1.) Facility components and net space criteria are:
160                                                     AFMAN32-1084 20 APRIL 2012


      2.7.9.3.1. Classroom. This is a demonstration/performance classroom. It must
      contain sufficient space to provide each student attending handgun, rifle, shotgun, or
      submachine gun training with a chair and a table work surface of at least 610 mm x
      915 mm (24 in x 36 in). Provide space for each student attending machine gun or
      mortar training with a work surface of at least 865 mm x 1145 mm (34 in by 45 in).
      The minimum size classroom is 84 m2 (900 ft2).
      2.7.9.3.2. Administrative Space. It provides space for program administrators and
      combat arms personnel. See Chapter 6 for further guidance on administrative space
      standards. This Manual supersedes other references for developing administrative
      space requirements for Air Force facilities.
      2.7.9.3.3. Weapons Simulator Room. This room is specifically designed for
      commercially purchased projection-based weapons simulators. A five-lane system
      requires a room approximately 10.7 m x 5.3 m (35 ft x 17.5 ft). A ten-lane system
      requires approximately 10.7 m x 10.7 m (35 ft by 35 ft). The room should have at
      least a 2.7 m (9 ft) ceiling height and no windows.
      2.7.9.3.4. Weapons Maintenance Shop. The weapons maintenance shop must have
      space for workbenches, hand tools, power tools, equipment, and spare parts storage.
      A range that supports fewer than 5,000 weapons requires a 28 m2 (300 ft2) shop. An
      installation that supports over 5,000 weapons requires 37 m2 (400 ft2). Provide a
      lavatory with potable water in the immediate area.
      2.7.9.3.5. Weapons Cleaning/Degreasing Room. This room accommodates
      workbenches, degreasing tanks, and spray hoods. Special design requirements include
      exhaust and ventilation air, vapor-proof electrical fixtures, compressed air service,
      and solvent-resistant wall and ceiling finishes. The minimum space requirement is
      typically about 12 m2 (130 ft2). A lavatory with potable water should be in the
      immediate area.
      2.7.9.3.6. Alarmed Weapons and Ammunition Storage Room. The vault provides
      secure storage for all weapons for which the CA section is responsible and a less-
      than-30-day supply of each type of ammunition is used on the range. A gross floor
      area of 14 m2 (151 ft2) is usually adequate. Room construction must satisfy the
      requirements of DoD 5100.76-M, Physical Security of Sensitive Conventional Arms,
      Ammunition, and Explosives, AFI 31-101, and UFC 4-020-01, Security Engineering:
      Project Development (FOUO), for construction materials and specifications. In
      general, vault construction must provide a minimum ten minutes of forced entry
      delay. Typical vault construction features walls, floors, and roofs of 200 mm (7.9 in)
      concrete reinforced with two layers of number 4 rebar on 225 mm (9 in) centers,
      fitted with a class V door.
      2.7.9.3.7. Latrines (Sanitary Facilities). Provide facilities for both men and
      women. Provide additional cold water hand-washing stations at the entrance to the
      CA building and at the firing range. The size of sanitary facilities depends upon the
      class size at that particular installation. Typically, the women's latrine need only
      accommodate about one-fourth the number of people as the men's latrine. Because
      instructors have daily contact with lead/heavy metals and may transfer these
      contaminants by casual contact, hand-washing stations, showers, changing areas,
AFMAN32-1084 20 APRIL 2012                                                                  161


         laundry facilities, and lockers should be provided for instructors to remove lead
         contamination.
         2.7.9.3.8. Miscellaneous Storage. This provides space for storage of administrative
         supplies, training aids, classroom equipment, tools, and other miscellaneous items.
         The size of this area is directly related to the type and quantity of training the CA
         section conducts.
         2.7.9.3.9. Student Weapons Cleaning Area/Room. This provides space for
         students to clean their weapons after completion of firing. It may be an outside
         covered area or a room large enough to accommodate cleaning tables/benches and
         cleaning materials for normally expected student loads. If a room is provided, it must
         be well-ventilated.
         2.7.9.3.10. Range Target Storage and Repair Building. This facility provides
         space for the secure storage and repair of targets. Provides an electrical power source
         for operating power tools.
     2.7.9.4. Dimensions. See Chapter 6 for administrative space standards and ETL 11-18
     for operational and special purpose space requirements.
     2.7.9.5. Design Considerations. A facility supporting a small arms range system of
     more than 21 firing points requires a proportionately larger classroom and latrine than
     provided above. Likewise, a facility supporting more than one range system or type of
     range requires a larger weapons and ammunition storage room. See ETL 11-18 for
     additional information and guidance.

         aisle space maintained. The classroom must be properly ventilated and equipped with
         a dimmer switch to control overhead lighting.
         2.7.16.3.2. Projection Booth (Soundproof). This includes space for the
         aforementioned standard equipment and space for software storage and equipment
         maintenance. Provisions should be made for a 60 cycle, 120 watt power source for
         operating the multimedia education trainer. Approximately 23 m2 (250 ft2) will
         suffice.
         2.7.16.3.3. Administrative Space. Space is provided for the program administrator
         and instructors (normally two persons). If the Base Vehicle Operations Office wishes
         to locate its Drivers Training and Licensing Section in this facility (rather than in
         Vehicle Operations Administration [CATCODE 610121]), additional office space
         may be provided. Administrative space criteria in Chapter 6 apply.
         2.7.16.3.4. Student Break Lounge. See Table 6.3 in Chapter 6.

      2.7.17.1. Description. This facility supports Enlisted Professional Military Education
      (EPME) courses operated under AFI 36-2301, Professional Military Education. EPME
      facilities must project an atmosphere of professionalism and excellence in which students
      can achieve educational objectives. These facilities must also create an environment
      where instructors can provide first-rate education in a quality Air Force setting.
      2.7.17.2. Requirements Determination. Historically, the development and operation of
      EPME centers have been largely controlled by the individual commands. In the process,
      commands have established individual preferences concerning the nature of the facilities
      they want to provide. Air Force supports the command’s role in this area and issues this
      guidance not to dictate development, but to indicate Air Force approval of the described
      requirements and provide desirable minimum space requirements.
      2.7.17.3. Scope Determination. Facility components and associated space criteria
      follow. In all components, the basic determinants of net space requirements are the size
      of the student body (which dictates the number of classrooms), size of the staff, and the
      curricula. A summary of all EPME space requirements is shown in Table 2.33
         2.7.17.3.1. Education Areas:
             2.7.17.3.1.1. Seminar Rooms. Instructors and students use these rooms as the
             primary area for academic discussions and case study analysis. Adequate space to
AFMAN32-1084 20 APRIL 2012                                                                  167


           allow free circulation while working on case projects, making presentations, and
           doing small group cluster work is essential. Space must be included in the seminar
           for student study materials, coats, lesson aids, etc. The classroom is also typically
           equipped with an array of equipment to include a lectern/podium, computers,
           large graphics monitors, videotape recorder and cameras, overhead projectors,
           projection screens, marker boards, and flip charts. In addition to being wired to
           support LAN connectivity and closed-circuit TV (CCTV) capability, classroom
           should also be acoustically rated to minimize sound transmission between
           seminars. Average seminars are comprised of 12-14 students plus the instructor.
           See Table 6.4 in Chapter 6 for classroom space standards.
           2.7.17.3.1.2. Auditorium. Schools with two or more seminars should have an
           auditorium. This is the central meeting place for the student body to participate in
           large group discussions. In addition, the auditorium supports presentations by
           guest lecturers, dignitaries, and various special EPME-related ceremonies. The
           auditorium should include appropriate lighting controls to include adjustable
           lighting in the audience seating area as well as the speaker platform. The audience
           should have an unobstructed view of the raised speaker platform and projection
           screen. In addition to a projection booth, a quality sound system, projection
           screen, and lighted podium are also considered standard. Seating should include
           retractable desktops for note taking. The auditorium should be designed to
           accommodate the maximum class load plus an additional seating capacity of 20
           percent for staff, distinguished visitors, and other invited groups. See Table 6.4 in
           Chapter 6 for auditorium space standards.
           2.7.17.3.1.3. Projection/Audiovisual Booth. EPME facilities use high-
           technology projection equipment to enhance student learning. This is typically
           designed to accommodate rear-screen projection (optional), securable storage for
           high-value equipment, and adequate shelving for audiovisual tapes, supplies, etc.
           Additional equipment usually includes video projectors, cameras, computers,
           CCTV capability, wireless microphones, speakers, and teleconferencing
           equipment. For planning purposes, the average net area is 23 m2 (250 ft2).
           2.7.17.3.1.4. Guest Speaker/ Distinguished Visitor (DV) Waiting
           Room. Provide a comfortable, private area for guest speakers to perform last
           minute preparations and relax prior to their presentations. Ensure this area
           presents a professional appearance. These areas should normally include CCTV
           and phone service. For planning purposes, the average net area is 14 m2 (150 ft2).
           2.7.17.3.1.5. Learning Resource Center. This area usually includes the school
           library, computer work stations, videotape review stations, and research space. It
           is also wired for LAN connectivity. Some locations, such as the Senior
           Noncommissioned Officer Academy (SNCOA), may require additional space for
           dedicated computer laboratories. Also, it is not essential that this space be all in
           one room. Although planned workstation requirements will vary, calculate the net
           area on the basis of 37 m2 (400 ft2) plus 9.3 m2 (100 ft2) for each seminar greater
           than four (e.g., a six-seminar school would earn 55.6 m2 [600 ft2]).
168                                                        AFMAN32-1084 20 APRIL 2012


      2.7.17.3.2. Interaction Areas. These areas are important for student social
      interaction and the display of unique accomplishments of distinguished airmen. These
      essential attributes support the mission requirement to inspire commitment to the
      profession of arms.
         2.7.17.3.2.1. Heritage Room. Provides important pictorial and static displays of
         unique enlisted contributions to airpower as well as locally-significant historical
         information. Space must be included to allow display case access, etc. This room
         ties directly to the effective educational goal regarding commitment to the
         profession of arms. The area should occupy a significant, highly visible space. For
         planning purposes, the average net area is 23 m2 (250 ft2).
         2.7.17.3.2.2. Student Lounge. This lounge should provide a comfortable,
         attractive setting for student interaction. In addition to serving as a student break
         area, this area is commonly used for events such as course icebreakers and pre-
         graduation socials. The lounge should include a sink and space for a refrigerator
         and microwave. It should also be wired for CCTV. Minimum net area is 11.6 m 2
         (125 ft2) per seminar (this roughly equates to one-fourth the area of the
         classrooms).
      2.7.17.3.3. Administrative Areas. These areas provide for personnel administration
      activities and student educational support services, as well as a receiving area for new
      students and visitors.
         2.7.17.3.3.1. Reception Area. This high-visibility area is the first part of the
         EPME center visited by most students, guests, and DVs. This area should
         establish the professional tone for the entire facility. Ideally, it is located near the
         facility entrance, but if this is not practical or possible, it should be located near
         the command section. For planning purposes, the average net area is 13.9 m2 (150
         ft2).
         2.7.17.3.3.2. Administrative Area. In addition to supporting the administrative
         staff, this area must accommodate high traffic and be designed with enough open
         space to allow easy access to support equipment. It must be sized to accommodate
         typical support equipment such as file cabinets, FAX machines, copiers, etc. See
         Chapter 6 for administrative space standards.
         2.7.17.3.3.3. Student Service Area. Ideally, this area will be located in
         conjunction with the Administrative Area, and designed to provide necessary
         space for student processing and customer service. For planning purposes, the
         average net area is 9.3 m2 (100 ft2 ) plus 2.3 m2 (25 ft2) for each seminar greater
         than four (e.g., an eight-seminar school would earn 19 m2 [200 ft2]).
         2.7.17.3.3.4. Commandant/Program Manager’s Office. This office must
         present a professional appearance and reflect the importance of this enlisted
         position. Furnishings typically include a conference table for small group
         consultations as well as hosting of dignitaries. This office is a C size office
         (13.94 m2 /150 ft2).
         2.7.17.3.3.5. Director Offices. Larger PME operations include a Director of
         Operations and a Director of Resources. The nature of these functions dictates a
AFMAN32-1084 20 APRIL 2012                                                                169


           private office of sufficient size for small group work, peer discussions, school
           management activities, and subordinate as well as student counseling. This office
           is a D size office (11.15 m2 /120 ft2).
           2.7.17.3.3.6. Instructor Offices. These should be of sufficient size and privacy
           to provide for student counseling sessions, one-on-one instructor training, storage
           of research/lesson support materials, computer stations, and seating for two
           (counseling/consultation). Where separate locker rooms cannot be provided,
           adequate space for uniform storage/changing should be included in the office
           space. Ideally, these offices should be as close to classrooms as possible. This
           office is an E size office (7.43 m2 /80 ft2).
           2.7.17.3.3.7. Instructor Lounge. This area supports the staff and instructors as a
           private break/discussion area. The lounge should provide a comfortable, attractive
           setting for staff interaction and include a sink and space for a refrigerator and
           microwave oven. It should also be wired for CCTV. See Table 6.3 in Chapter 6
           for break room/lounge space standards.
           2.7.17.3.3.8. Computer/Test Analysis Room. This securable area provides
           room for storage of sensitive test items and computerized workstations including
           scanner equipment and printers. For planning purposes, the average net area is 17
           m2 (180 ft2).
           2.7.17.3.3.9. Conference Room. Schools of four seminars or larger require a
           conference room. These rooms are typically equipped with a large CCTV
           monitor, podium, projection equipment, computer station, variable lighting, and
           some type of separate sound system. These areas are used to host internal and
           outside conferences, as well as conduct continued in-service faculty training. See
           Table 6.4 in Chapter 6 for conference room space standards. Provide 15 percent
           overflow seating for visitors.
           2.7.17.3.3.10. Locker Rooms. This is a highly desirable option where possible.
           Instructor-led and supervised physical fitness programs require regular use of
           changing/shower facilities for the faculty. This area supports those requirements,
           and is especially important where fitness center facilities are not in close
           proximity to the school. If possible, shower capability should be included.
           Minimum size should be based on size and demographics of staff.
     2.7.17.4. Dimensions. See paragraph 2.7.17.3 and Chapter 6 of this Manual.
     2.7.17.5. Design Considerations.
        2.7.17.5.1. An EPME center requires one or more adjoining outdoor areas for the
        following described activities. The areas are identified by Training Area (CATCODE
        939449).
           2.7.17.5.1.1. One outdoor area supports the physical fitness program prescribed
           by the particular PME level, which usually involves various activities such as
           volleyball and aerobic activity. The required size of the area will vary according
           to the size of the student body and program schedules; a typical area for 30
           students contains about 470 m2 (560 yd2). Indoor physical conditioning is
 170                                                           AFMAN32-1084 20 APRIL 2012


                conducted in the base gymnasium.
                2.7.17.5.1.2. An outdoor formation area with access to a stationary flag pole and
                room for open ranks inspections of students is required to support program
                requirements. Size should be based on the size of the student body.
                2.7.17.5.1.3. Classrooms and study areas require protection from outside noise so
                that a proper learning environment is maintained. This requirement must be
                considered in the facility design and location and in the control of the surrounding
                activities.
          2.7.17.5.2. Dormitory Requirements. The design, construction, and renovation of
          dormitories shall be based on existing criteria. Most EPME housing (i.e.,
          Noncommissioned Officer Academy [NCOA] and SNCOA) is supported exclusively
          as dedicated transient VA Lodging operated by the host base Services Squadron.
          Whenever practical, students should be housed as close to the PME academic facility
          as possible.

      2.7.18.1. Description. Responsibility for the weapons loading crew training rests with
      the Operations Group or Maintenance Group Commanders. The purpose of the training is
      to ensure that loading crews acquire and maintain the knowledge and physical
      proficiency necessary to perform their functions in a safe and efficient manner.
      2.7.18.2. Requirements Determination. The training is conducted in a lecture
      classroom and on an aircraft parked either in a facility dedicated to load crew training or
      in available covered aircraft maintenance space (dock or hangar) designated for training
      use. It is recommended that bomber aircraft have dedicated load-training facilities;
      however, where not practical, inside facilities should be provided to the maximum extent
      possible during periods of extreme inclement weather. Responsibility for the munitions
      loading crew training rests with the Squadron Commander and munitions supervision.
      2.7.18.3. Scope Determination.
         2.7.18.3.1. Adequate office and classroom space with appropriate heating and
         cooling are required in the academic and practical training area. Additional storage
         space for weapons training aids, support equipment, and tool kits may be required.
         Facility assets and deficiencies are determined under procedures given in paragraph
         2.7.1. Space requirements are determined under Tables 6.3 and 6.4 in Chapter 6 of
         this Manual and the guidance in paragraph 2.7.1.4. As per paragraph 2.7.1.4, space
         requirements can be increased to provide needed storage and handling space for
         training aids (munitions items). When the classroom adjoins the dock or hangar
         containing the training aircraft, the training aids can usually be stored in the larger
         space.
         2.7.18.3.2. The need to provide covered space for the training aircraft under
         CATCODE 171875 is determined on the basis of a study that encompasses (a) the
         feasibility of conducting the training outdoors and (b) the possibility that training
         requirements can be satisfied through part-time occupancy of space in existing
         covered aircraft maintenance space or in space to be acquired to meet a deficiency in
         covered maintenance space. Design requirements for space occupied either full- or
         part-time for training include provision of interior environmental conditions that
         support and enhance execution of the training mission. The space requirement for
         facility acquisitions under CATCODE 171875 is established by the dimensions of
         the selected training aircraft plus minimum clearances necessitated by safety, training,
         and storage needs.
      2.7.18.4. Dimensions. See paragraph 2.7.18.3 and Tables 6.3 and 6.4 in Chapter 6 of
      this Manual.
      2.7.18.5. Design Considerations. This facility should be located in close proximity to
      the operational parking apron to facilitate towing of designated aircraft utilized for load
      crew training. If operation of an aircraft's Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) is required during
      load crew training, facility design considerations must be made to properly purge the

         OPR: AF/A4L

         OCR: N/A

       3.1.2.1. Description. Maintenance hangars provide space for aircraft maintenance, tool
       rooms, aircraft weighing and other maintenance and inspection activities.
       3.1.2.2. Requirements Determination. Hangars must support aircraft maintenance,
       repair, and inspection activities that are most efficiently done under complete cover. One
       maintenance space may be provided in a hangar sized for the largest aircraft assigned to
       the base. Separate studies are used to determine hangar requirements to accommodate C-
       5, E-3A, E-4, and KC-10 aircraft. See UFC 3-260-01 for additional information on
       aircraft maintenance areas, support areas, and orientation of facilities.
AFMAN32-1084 20 APRIL 2012                                                                  177


     3.1.2.3. Scope Determination. Determine the square footage requirements for
     maintenance hangars by the method described below for computing covered maintenance
     spaces.
        3.1.2.3.1. Calculate the number of authorized covered maintenance spaces by using
        the procedures in Table 3.1 or paragraph 3.1.2.3.6. (Computation for Special
        Missions), or both. Dock space described under Large Aircraft Maintenance Dock
        (CATCODE 211173), Medium Aircraft Maintenance Dock (CATCODE 211175),
        Small Aircraft Maintenance Dock (CATCODE 211177), and Fuel System
        Maintenance Dock (CATCODE 211179) may be used to meet the space
        requirements.
        3.1.2.3.2. To determine the most efficient combination of facility use and aircraft
        positioning, use templates representing the aircraft (see CATCODE 113321 for
        aircraft dimensions) and floor plans of existing and proposed docks and hangars made
        to the same scale. Arrange the templates in various combinations to find the
        arrangement that most efficiently conserves space and permits maintenance
        operations. Do not overlook tail heights, the height and width of door openings,
        structural protuberances in facilities, and the turn radius of tow vehicles connected to
        aircraft.
        3.1.2.3.3. One additional covered work space is authorized if the corrosion control
        workload exceeds the covered work space allocated under Table 3.1 and/or for
        special missions. An excessive corrosion control workload occurs with some
        combinations of numbers and types of aircraft, environmental and climatic factors,
        and the availability of scheduled depot maintenance. The additional space must be
        provided as a single aircraft space because of isolation requirements stipulated in TO
        42A-1-1, Safety, Fire Precaution, and Health Promotion Aspects of Painting,
        Doping, and Paint Removal. Contact OPR for latest version of TO 42A-1-1.
        3.1.2.3.4. To determine the interior dimensions of dock and hangar bays, use the
        dimensions of the largest aircraft that occupies the bay plus the minimum clearances
        shown in Table 3.2. To compute the gross area of the hangar, multiply the interior
        dimensions by a factor of 1.15.
        3.1.2.3.5. Space will be provided for Contractor Operated Maintenance Base Supply
        (COMBS). Space requirements will be determined by the existing contract. The
        facility will be located in close proximity to the flight line and contain areas for
        receiving, inspection, storing, parking material, issuing, support equipment
        maintenance, and office functions.
        3.1.2.3.6. Computation for Special Missions. The formula in Table 3.1 applies
        only to units with repetitive flying hour programs or relatively constant monthly
        operations in non-arctic conditions. To calculate the number of authorized covered
        spaces for Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) and for installations in arctic
        climates, use the following formula:
178                                                          AFMAN32-1084 20 APRIL 2012




         S = H x A / 176

         Where:

         S = Spaces authorized

         H = Average number of hours in dock per aircraft, based on maintenance experience
         or development and test experience data for new aircraft

         A = Average number of aircraft programmed for maintenance each month

         176 = Hours per month (22 x 8)

         3.1.2.3.7. Generic Hangar Facilities for AMC Tanker Aircraft. For large Air
         Mobility Aircraft (e.g., C-17, KC-10, and like-size aircraft, excluding C-5),
         maintenance facilities should be designed to maximize current and future utility.
         Wherever feasible, design maintenance facilities for generic aircraft use. A generic
         aircraft facility is defined as being suitable for an aircraft with a C-17’s wing span, a
         KC-10’s length, and a KC-10’s height. Contact AMC/A7 for additional guidance and
         approval source documentation.
         3.1.2.3.8. Special purpose space may be authorized when justified.
      3.1.2.4. Dimensions. See Tables 3.1 and 3.2 below.
      3.1.2.5. Design Considerations.
         3.1.2.5.1. Siting of new hangars must comply with UFC 3-260-01. See paragraphs
         3.1.1.2 through 3.1.1.3 above.
         3.1.2.5.2. Floors of maintenance hangars should allow aircraft loadings as specified
         in Chapter 2 of this Manual. Door openings must be wide and tall enough for aircraft
         to be pulled into and out of the facility.
         3.1.2.5.3. Some aircraft utilize an Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) for engine start. Any
         area where the APU will be operated should be checked to prevent damage to
         overhead infrastructure. If an APU is to be used inside of a facility, considerations
         should be made for ventilation of the exhaust gases.
         3.1.2.5.4. Space may be required within the covered aircraft maintenance area for
         portable maintenance aid docking stations and/or maintenance support workstations
         and equipment. The amount of hardware at any particular covered aircraft
         maintenance area depends on the planned maintenance activities. For example, within
         the hangar, if one or two bays are used for completing scheduled aircraft inspections,
         then appropriate communication is required for supporting the docking stations and/or
         workstations. This will be determined during the site-specific facility planning.
         3.1.2.5.5. Security Requirement. Secured space will be required for the storage of
         classified components temporarily removed from aircraft. Classified secure areas will
         be alarmed in accordance with applicable local security directives.
AFMAN32-1084 20 APRIL 2012                                                                 179

AFMAN32-1084 20 APRIL 2012                                                                    181


     3.1.3.2. Requirements Determination. Most maintenance hangars and docks are
     inappropriate because the structure interferes with the radar or lacks a clear target area
     nearby. This facility is necessary to calibrate fire control systems.
     3.1.3.3. Scope Determination. A shelter is authorized for every 18 aircraft (F-22, F-15,
     F-16, and/or A-10).
     3.1.3.4. Dimensions. Contact OPR for additional guidance.
     3.1.3.5. Design Considerations. The shelter is open in warm climates and closed in
     cold climates. The shelter needs an open area for an optical target area.

     3.1.4.1. Description. The shop provides space for specialized maintenance activities
     such as metals technology, aerospace systems shops, egress shop and reclamation
     operations on crash damaged aircraft and equipment. The shop also has space for work,
     administration, telecommunications, tool cribs, bench stocks, lockers, storage, and
     security of supplies and reparable parts. Reclamation and fabrication activities may
     require an open storage yard for aircraft, aircraft parts, and equipment awaiting repairs
     (see CATCODE 452252).
     3.1.4.2. Requirements Determination. This facility provides for specialized and
     general aircraft maintenance functions. The electrical and environmental systems (E&E)
     element encompasses aircraft and related E&E maintenance, inspection, repair, and
     servicing functions. It may also be a holding area for aircraft cryogenic servicing carts. It
     normally includes work benches, bench stock, battery servicing area (two separate areas,
     if Ni-Cad and lead acid batteries both require servicing), cryogenics maintenance area,
     generator and constant speed drive (CSD) test stand area (if required), life raft bottle
     servicing area, tool crib, administrative space, and personnel locker space.
        3.1.4.2.1. Egress Shop. The Egress facility should be enclosed and separated from
        other inhabited buildings or areas whenever possible, for off-equipment egress
        maintenance. The location of the facility must be approved by the fire department,
        Security Forces, and Civil Engineering. This facility must be large enough to
        accommodate the average number of egress components requiring maintenance and
        storage at any one time. Explosives storage, maintenance, and grounding capabilities
        must be consider when maintaining Advanced Concept Ejection System (ACES) II
        units. See AFI 21-112, Aircrew Egress Systems, for additional information on egress
        facilities. The egress shop contains:
            3.1.4.2.1.1. Administration. Sufficient space is required to support technical
            order storage and management, Core Automated Management System (CAMS)

             input (or equivalent), time change management, and general administrative
             processes. See Chapter 6 of this Manual for additional administrative space
             standards.
             3.1.4.2.1.2. Maintenance. ACES II seat maintenance requires room for
             repacking drogue chutes as well as simultaneous canopy maintenance for F-16
             aircraft. Consolidated tool kits (CTK) and support equipment storage should also
             be placed in this area.
             3.1.4.2.1.3. Storage. This area must be solely utilized for explosives. No
             maintenance can be performed in this area in accordance with AFMAN 91-201.
             Size will vary depending upon weapon system.
      3.1.4.3. Scope Determination. Table 3.3 lists total gross space requirements for general
      purpose maintenance shops based on the mission. Table 3.4 for specific egress shop
      requirements). These shops may be in one building or several buildings. Dispersing the
      shops allows use of space in suitable existing buildings such as hangars. However, when
      possible and within funding constraints, the E&E functions should be collocated as
      closely as possible within the same building. Actual space requirements will depend on
      the mission and size of related E&E support equipment and the working area required to
      perform assigned functions.
      3.1.4.4. Dimensions. See Tables 3.3 and 3.4 (below).
      3.1.4.5. Design Considerations.
         3.1.4.5.1. Floor space and door openings must allow movement and repair of the
         largest item to be repaired in each shop. See Table 3.2 (above).
         3.1.4.5.2. Special ventilation and floor drainage is required, but not limited to, the
         following E&E maintenance areas: Battery servicing, life-raft servicing, cryogenic
         cart maintenance, and generator and CSD test stand areas. An emergency eye wash
         station and shower are mandatory near the battery servicing area. A waste oil disposal
         system to reclaim petroleum based oils and synthetic oils, is required. Consider
         providing a storage area for shop support equipment (e.g., portable hoists, jacks,
         refrigerant and ODC recovery systems, and cryogenic vacuum and purge carts).
         Provide a fire suppression system, ventilation systems (to accommodate fiberglass,
         plastic, welding, and plating shop operations), a compressed air source in each shop
         providing 1,030 kPa (150 psi) of air, a monorail crane hoist system, a multi-phase
         (110, 240 and 480 voltage) electrical system as required, and air conditioning to
         protect Computer Numerically Controlled industrial plant equipment as required.
         3.1.4.5.3. Locate facilities to comply with UFC 3-260-01. See paragraphs 3.1.1.2
         through 3.1.1.3 for general maintenance facility criteria.

 NOTES:

 1. Spatial needs for units supporting egress systems differ depending on total PAA and
 type MDS aircraft. The above figures are based on fighter shops using two 4.6 m (15 ft)
 tables to perform maintenance on ACES II seats. The above space requirements are based
 on the average maintenance capability. If seat/canopy maintenance capabilities needs to
 increase/decrease from the above average computations, space requirements will
 increase/decrease accordingly.

 2. Refer to Chapter 6 of this Manual for approved office types and sizes.

 3. Number of personnel require user justification.

 4. The first figure in the m2 column is the number of seats or canopies, the second figure is
 the allowable area in square meters.

 5. Tool and support equipment storage is figured in the computation. Simultaneous canopy
 maintenance must be performed on units providing canopy maintenance. All multi-mission
 design series (MDS) units have ACES II seats.

        3.1.7.1. Description. This shop maintains and stores aircraft engines, gas turbine
        compressors, and engine accessories. Major functions performed in the shop are
        disassembly, inspection, repair, replacement, technical order compliance, and assembly
        of engine components. A typical shop has a high-bay, direct engine maintenance work
        area with overhead crane; a direct and indirect support area for non-powered support
        equipment; accessories such as after burners, thrust reversers, compressor balancing, and
        modules; parts supply; tool room; training room; spare engines; cleaning room; bearing
        room; computer room; and administrative support.
        3.1.7.2. Requirements Determination. This           facility   is   necessary   to   provide
        maintenance for aircraft jet engines.
        3.1.7.3. Scope Determination. Use the following formula to determine space
        requirements:

Figure 3.2. Calculating Space Requirements for Jet Inspection and Maintenance Shop.
                                      X=AxBxCxD/E

  Where:

       X = Total space requirements

       A = Support space (see Table 3.6.)

       B = Work flow, average flow days per engine (see Table 3.6.)

       C = Workload, one-half the number of installed engines in authorized aircraft (USAF PD,

           include Queen Bee workloads)

       D = Engine work space area (double the engine length times quadruple the engine width, see

           Table 3.6.)

       E = Average number of workdays per month (22 days)



  Use the formula for each type of engine to be maintained, and add the results to determine the
  shop's total space requirements. Example: for the J85 engine, divide the product of A(2),
  B(16), C(102), and D(13) by E(22) for an X value of 1,930 m2 (20,770 ft2).

        3.1.7.4. Dimensions. See paragraph 3.1.7.3 above.
        3.1.7.5. Design Considerations. Locate facilities to comply with explosives safety
        standards. The engine maintenance areas require a ceiling height that will accommodate
        the installation of a bridge crane system and monorail system with a minimum overhead

        clearance of 4.58 m (15 ft) as measured from the floor level to the bottom of the hoist
        hook. The work bays should be set up in the shop under the bridge crane to adequately
        perform engine maintenance and module separation/installation. Adequate space is
        required in front of engine stands to allow for maneuvering and transferring of engines
        from trailers to stands.

 NOTES:

 1. In addition to the basic formula, the following factors will be used to adjust space
 requirements for units organized as a standard 72 PAA wing. These factors provide smaller
 units sufficient overhead and trim larger units of excessive space. Use a multiplication
 factor of 1.3 for units less than 72 PAA, and 0.85 for those units greater than 72 PAA. A
 72 PAA engine shop should generally include 10 work bays; a 24 PAA should generally
 have 4 work bays.

 2. For units organized as composite wings, the basic formula will be used for each engine
 type in the unit. The multiplication factors for PAA size do not apply.

 3. For engine types not shown, contact MAJCOM/A4M for latest guidance.

AFMAN32-1084 20 APRIL 2012                                                                  191


       OPR: AF/A4L

       OCR: N/A

     3.1.8.1. Description. This facility provides hangar space for corrosion treating,
     corrosion repairing, paint stripping, and repainting of an entire aircraft and an
     environmentally controlled area to wash aircraft. This facility also provides space for the
     corrosion control shop, which includes preparation and drying areas, abrasive blasting
     rooms, paint booths for mixing and/or applying paint, tool storage, lockers, and
     administrative areas. Corrosion control shops are also required to support small aircraft
     components, aerospace ground equipment, vehicles, weapons and munitions, and
     avionics shops.
     3.1.8.2. Requirements Determination. The number and size of corrosion control
     facilities is the minimum size required to accommodate the largest aircraft serviced and
     workload required to support the total Air Force corrosion control concept. A hangar
     provides enclosed space for aircraft washing and for inspecting the aircraft for corrosion
     damage. Additionally, the facility can accommodate surface preparation and repainting of
     the aircraft. Some installations, such as depot-type operations, AETC pilot training bases,
     and MAJCOM regional corrosion prevention and control facilities, may need a
     strip/repaint hangar in addition to an aircraft corrosion control hangar. The corrosion
     control shops are necessary to provide an enclosed area for corrosion treatment,
     inspections, stripping, and painting of aircraft components and other associated support
     equipment.
     3.1.8.3. Scope Determination.
        3.1.8.3.1. Corrosion control is both a base and a depot responsibility. Specific
        workloads vary from base to base, but the minimum required facilities include a wash
        rack, shop space for complete corrosion treatment, painting removable aircraft parts,
        ground support equipment, and a corrosion-approved facility to perform aircraft
        maintenance painting.
        3.1.8.3.2. Complete aircraft corrosion control and strip and repaint facilities are
        authorized only at AFMC depots, AETC bases, and at regional support bases as
        determined by MAJCOM needs. Mid-life scuff and complete repaint is required to
        support each base. At centralized and/or regional support bases, the MAJCOMs may
        use this facility to supplement depot painting requirements. The required size for this
        centralized or regional complete strip-and-repaint facility is the minimum size
        required to accommodate the largest aircraft supported. Due to the unique purpose of
        these facilities, the centralized or regional facility must not be linked to the maximum
        number of covered facilities as described in CATCODE 211111.
        3.1.8.3.3. Base facility requirements emphasize prevention and detection. Since
        freedom from dirt, oil, and other contaminants is important in this regard, base
        facilities are primarily designed for cleaning and maintaining protective
        coating/corrosion control systems.
     3.1.8.4. Dimensions. Determine the required interior dimension of an aircraft bay by the
     largest aircraft dimensions and the required structural clearances listed in Table 3.2
192                                                         AFMAN32-1084 20 APRIL 2012


      (above). The corrosion control shops may require up to 530 m2 (5,700 ft2) for medium
      size aircraft. Minimum requirements for an F-15 facility is 492 m2 (5,292 ft2) and an F-22
      facility is 495 m2 (5,330 ft2). Bases with a large number of aircraft (above 40 large or
      medium aircraft assigned) or in a severely corrosive area are authorized, with proper
      justification, a corrosion control hangar and a wash hangar. Minimum aircraft separation
      is 3 m (10 ft) on each side to facilitate maintenance stands.
      3.1.8.5. Design Considerations.
         3.1.8.5.1. Corrosion control facilities need hot and cold water, electric power, and
         compressed air. Base corrosion control operations require collection, treatment, and
         disposal facilities for oils, alkalis, salts, hydroxides, paint stripping agents, paint
         residue, and other substances generated by aircraft cleaning. For detailed information
         on corrosion control operations see TO 1-1-691, Aircraft Weapons System Cleaning
         & Corrosion Control, and TO 1-1-8, Application of Organic Coatings.
         3.1.8.5.2. The abrasive blasting rooms shall be located away from the paint booths to
         eliminate contamination.
         3.1.8.5.3. Siting of new hangars must comply with UFC 3-260-01. See paragraphs
         3.1.1.2 through 3.1.1.3 for general maintenance facility criteria.

      3.1.9.1. Description. This facility is a separate storage building for storing cleaning
      supplies, cleaning tools, paint, corrosion and stripping supplies, tools, etc., and is
      normally adjacent to the wash, corrosion control shop, and/or strip/paint hangars.
      3.1.9.2. Requirements Determination. A separate storage building is required for
      safety and fire prevention.
      3.1.9.3. Scope Determination. The required size for the storage building is the
      minimum size required to accommodate the corrosion work area.
      3.1.9.4. Dimensions. See paragraph 3.1.9.3 above.
      3.1.9.5. Design Considerations. The storage buildings must maintain temperatures
      between 10°C (50°F) and 27°C (80°F) and are to meet all federal, state, and local
      requirements and other guidance as defined in paragraphs 1.3.1 and 1.8.6 in this
      Manual.
  3.1.10. Large Aircraft Maintenance Dock.
         FAC: 2111

         CATCODE: 211173
AFMAN32-1084 20 APRIL 2012                                                                 193


         OPR: AF/A4L

         OCR: N/A

         (NOTE: Criteria below is also used for Medium Aircraft Maintenance Dock
         (CATCODE 211175), Small Aircraft Maintenance Dock (CATCODE 211177), and
         Fuel System Maintenance Dock (CATCODE 211179).

     3.1.10.1. Description. This facility has space for an aircraft parking bay and support
     space for heating, plumbing, latrines, ventilation, compressed air, and fire detection and
     suppression. The fuel system maintenance dock may need additional fire detection and
     suppression. Maintenance docks provide protected space for aircraft maintenance. They
     contain heating, plumbing, electricity, and compressed air systems and are usually
     insulated. Docks used for fuel systems maintenance also include mechanical ventilation,
     fume sensing and alarm, fire extinguishing systems, and wash down drainage trenches.
     3.1.10.2. Requirements Determination. Before planning an additional fuel systems
     maintenance dock, consider the possibility of converting an existing aircraft maintenance
     dock if remaining aircraft maintenance dock space could support other aircraft
     maintenance requirements.
     3.1.10.3. Scope Determination. CATCODE 211111 and Table 3.1 provide the
     required number of dock spaces for aircraft maintenance, including fuel systems
     maintenance. The normal requirement for Fuel Systems Maintenance Docks
     (CATCODE 211179) is one per base. However, some base missions have a
     demonstrable requirement based on workload records, PAA, weather conditions, and
     projections for additional docks. These may come out of the base total dock allowance
     (Table 3.1) or be added to it, depending on workload requirements.
     3.1.10.4. Dimensions. See Tables 3.1 and 3.2.
     3.1.10.5. Design Considerations. Siting of new hangars must comply with UFC 3-260-
     01. See paragraphs 3.1.1.2 through 3.1.1.3 for general maintenance facility criteria.

      3.1.11.3. Scope Determination. The size of the test cell depends on the type of engine
      to be tested. This facility generally does not accommodate an aircraft. The Jet Engine
      Intermediate Maintenance Shop, (CATCODE 211157), may require a test cell for
      support. The thrust capacity of the cell depends on the engines to be tested.
      3.1.11.4. Dimensions. Obtain additional information through WR-ALC/579 CBSS.

  3.1.12. Test Stand (/Hush House) Facility.
         FAC: 2118

         CATCODE: 211193

         OPR: AF/A4L

         OCR: WR-ALC/579 CBSS

      3.1.12.1. Description. A test stand and/or hush house consists of technical equipment
      procured with aircraft appropriations and real property constructed with military
      construction appropriations.
      3.1.12.2. Requirements Determination. Test and/or hush house stands are authorized
      by an applicable Table of Allowance (TA). Hush houses and test stands, where approved,
      are government furnished equipment. WR-ALC/579 CBSS is designated inventory
      manager and is responsible for equipment programming and procurement and for
      establishing criteria used in programming and constructing support items in the military
      construction program.
      3.1.12.3. Scope Determination. Space requirements depend on the type of aircraft or
      engine to be tested. Construction includes modifying an existing aircraft parking apron,
      utility support, installing technical equipment, and a test stand and/or hush house.
      Installed equipment remains equipment; it is not real property. (NOTE: Hush House
      sound suppressers are equipment items associated with CATCODE 116665.)
      3.1.12.4. Dimensions. The parameters of Table 3.1 apply. If the test stand is farther
      than 910 m (3,000 ft) from the shop and tests more than 25 engines each month, a ready
      room of 74 m2 (800 ft2) may be programmed. In the ready room, engines are prepared for
      the test stand, thus allowing more engines to be tested on the stand in a short time.
      3.1.12.5. Design Considerations. Test stands and/or hush house require utility support

     3.1.15.1. Description. The shop provides space and facilities for lubrication, inspection,
     general repair, and replacement of major assemblies; painting, welding, upholstery,
     testing, cleaning, and minor parts fabrication. It also houses support functions such as
     vehicle management and analysis, tool rooms, parts rooms, hazardous material/waste
     rooms, locker rooms, and offices.
     3.1.15.2. Requirements Determination. Vehicle maintenance shops maintain all
     government owned vehicles and vehicular equipment assigned to a base, including
     vehicles of tenant organizations. Vehicle maintenance is required to procure tires from
     Supply and will require special levels in the shop due to lack of storage within Supply.
     Shop operations are usually supported by a government operated parts store or contractor
     operated parts store (COPARS) established under AFI 23-302, Vehicle Management. The
     parts store usually occupies space in the shop or in a nearby building. Any changes or
     modifications to contractor operated facilities should be coordinated with the local
     contracting office. COPARS are not typical for parts support, but still exist in some units.
     Obtain additional information through your applicable MAJCOM/A4RE and AF/A4LE.
     3.1.15.3. Scope Determination. Tables 3.7 through 3.7.5 show space requirements for
     six types of vehicle maintenance shops. See Tables 4-12 and 4-13 of UFC 4-730-10 for
     fire department vehicle maintenance bay and equipment storage requirements. Vehicle
     management’s parking area requirement is 10% of the assigned vehicle fleet for each
     facility.

       suppression systems. Air and water pollution equipment will be required (IAW AFMAN
       48-155 and AFOSH Std 91-20 Vehicle Maintenance Shops). Vehicle Bay height and
       vehicle entry width must be considered to allow for current generation of aircraft loaders
       and other large vehicles. Consideration must also be given to shop approach angles to
       allow for vehicle turning radius.

     3.1.16.1. Description. This facility provides a covered and heated environment for
     certain assigned vehicles. The space includes vehicle parking stalls, vehicle maneuvering
     lanes, mechanical room, and other necessary management support functions.
     3.1.16.2. Requirements Determination. The space requirement is the minimum space
     required to efficiently accommodate the selected vehicles. Heated parking buildings are
     needed for motorized aircraft and fuel servicing vehicles at installations where winters
     are severe. Severe winters are those with 30 or more days per year of -12°C (10°F) or
     lower or with an average January temperature of -7°C (20°F) or lower as determined
     from two 10-year (or longer) weather databases.
     3.1.16.3. Scope Determination.
        3.1.16.3.1. To determine the required space, develop a parking plan that reflects
        typical vehicle dimensions and turning radii. For planning purposes, determine the
        total vehicle equivalents for the vehicles selected and multiply by 18.6 m2 (200 ft2).
        This is the same as multiplying each vehicle's length by its width and multiplying by
        two. If the parking plan has a center aisle, multiply each vehicle equivalent by 14 m2
        (150 ft2). For a shed-type structure with no interior access lanes, use 9.3 m2 (100 ft2)
        for 1.0 vehicle equivalent. Other facility category codes such as Base Engineer
        Pavement and Grounds Facility (CATCODE 219943), Ambulance Shelter
        (CATCODE 510264), and Fire Station (CATCODE 730142) recognize the

        with the flying mission and type of operation. The maximum allowance is 40 percent
        of the fuel servicing vehicles for motorized aircraft assigned to the installation. Not
        more than four large refueling units (such as the R-9 or R-11 type) should be parked
        in a single structure.
        3.1.16.3.3. Maintain 2.4 m (8 ft) separation between parked vehicles and 30 m (100
        ft) separation between this building and nearby structures.
     3.1.16.4. Dimensions. See paragraph 3.1.16.3 above.
     3.1.16.5. Design Considerations. An installation that warrants more than four units
     may define a single structure as a two hour rated fire wall separating every four bays. The
     wall should have few penetrations, and these should have two hour fire ratings. These

      3.1.23.1. Description. This facility performs organizational and intermediate
      maintenance and provides secure storage of pods and associated equipment.
      3.1.23.2. Requirements Determination. The maintenance shop provides a controlled
      environment to inspect, maintain, and repair pods and associated equipment. Equipment
 210                                                             AFMAN32-1084 20 APRIL 2012


       includes powered and non-powered aircraft generation equipment (AGE), test benches,
       and bench stock. (See paragraph 3.1.23.5)
       3.1.23.3. Scope Determination. The storage area for pods and associated equipment
       provides physical security and optimum system availability for bench maintenance and
       aircraft loading, using approved lifting and transporting AGE. Major items of equipment
       that require space are a pod lifting device (overhead crane, A-frame with hoist, or
       hydraulic crane); pod cradles or storage racks for serviceable pods; pod cradles or storage
       bins for pod systems waiting for parts; MJ1A bomb lift pod adapters; and pod dollies. See
       Table 3.9 for space requirements.
       3.1.23.4. Dimensions. See Table 3.9 below.
       3.1.23.5. Design Considerations. The preferred location is near avionics maintenance
       and the flight line. Combining maintenance and storage facilities is desirable. The pod
       maintenance area must be maintained at 26°C ± 1°C (78°F ± 2°F) and between 35 and 65
       percent humidity. The pod storage area must be maintained between 16°C (60°F) and
       29°C (85°F) with 65 percent maximum humidity. Dual Power requirements are needed:
       400 Hz, 115 VAC (3-phase) and 50-60 Hz, 110 VAC. Separate overhead power
       distribution busses with emergency power disconnect are required. Intrusion
       detection/security breach alert systems must be directly incorporated with Security Forces
       to ensure swift response. Building architecture must incorporate measures to provide for
       and protect SECRET information/assets. Shop design will comply with facility design
       instructions to minimize radiation exposure as outlined in paragraph 3.2. of AFI 48-148.

      munitions AGE, if assigned. It normally includes maintenance stalls with work benches,
      an indoor wash rack, tool crib, bench stock, sealed lead acid battery servicing area,
      engine exhaust education system, administrative space, and personnel locker space.
      3.1.26.3. Scope Determination. Table 3.10 lists space requirements for maintenance
      shops and standby storage facilities. These space requirements include total covered and
      open storage. Open storage is identified as Aircraft Support Equipment Storage Yard
      (CATCODE 852273) and is measured in square yards. Additive to the space
      requirements in Table 3.10 are requirements for maintenance and storage of munitions
      trailers and equipment that are maintained in or near the weapon storage areas.
      Requirements for munitions AGE are to be obtained from MAJCOM/A4 and A7. For
      powered munitions trailer maintenance and storage facilities, allow 192 m2 (230 yd2) per
      authorized trailer for each facility.

      Construction. Obtain operational information from the 562d Combat Sustainment Group
      (AFMETCAL)/WR-ALC through AF/A4LF. TO 00-20-14 contains day-to-day
      operational guidance for PMELs.
          3.1.27.5.1. The laboratory requires tight environmental controls for temperature,
          humidity, and dust and a calibration and repair area free from interfering vibration.
          These environmental constraints vary. New and modified facilities must conform to
          the specifications in AFMAN 32-1094.
          3.1.27.5.2. All PMELs require certification per AFI 21-113. There are two major
          operational criteria for certification: temperature and humidity must remain in
          tolerance at least 90 percent of the time, measured over a 12 month period, and the
          facility must meet the requirements of AFMAN 32-1094.

  3.1.31. Base Engineer Covered Storage Facility.
         FAC: 4421

         CATCODE: 219946

         OPR: AFCESA/CEO

         OCR: AFCEE/TDB

      3.1.31.1. Description. This facility provides environmentally controlled storage space
      and related operating space for the supplies and material the BCE organization uses in its
      day-to-day operation, maintenance, and construction facilities. The facility is used for
      supplies and materials that cannot withstand storage in sheds or yards. A typical storage
      facility provides storage space in bins, on shelves, on racks, or an automated storage
      system; support areas such as office space, break, lunch or meeting room space;
      restrooms; and shipping and receiving space. Three types of storage facilities store
      material and equipment and are accountable to the BCE, a designated representative, or
      the counterpart to the BCE in base tenant organizations. These three storage facilities are
      the Base Engineer Covered Storage Facility (CATCODE 219946), Base Engineer
      Storage Shed (CATCODE 219947), and Base Civil Engineer Open Storage
      (CATCODE 452255).
      3.1.31.2. Requirements Determination. The BCE has the following seven basic
      storage areas.
         3.1.31.2.1. Holding Area. The holding area is a secure storage area for material
         associated with work orders or job orders. Materials are stored until the job starts.
         3.1.31.2.2. Stores. Provides storage for materials on hand for day-to-day work
         orders and job orders. Stores keep such things as bench stock for base supply and
         storage areas for a contractor operated civil engineering supply store (COCESS). CE
         may have other stores to stock materials needed by craft workers and customers.
         These stores include self help stores, "U-Fix-It" stores, and stores with centralized
         bench stock. Any changes or modifications to contractor operated facilities should be
         coordinated with the local contracting office.
         3.1.31.2.3. Tool Crib. A tool crib stores and issues tools for worker’s tool kits.
         3.1.31.2.4. Residual Storage Area. A residual storage area stores items left over
         from job orders and work orders that may have future use and are not normally
         stocked in COCESS or bench stock supplies.
         3.1.31.2.5. Bulk Storage. This area stores large, unwieldy items issued with work or
         job orders such as sand and gravel.
         3.1.31.2.6. Appliances. Refer to the Air Force Family Housing Guide.
         3.1.31.2.7. Prime Base Emergency Engineering Force (BEEF)/Mobility
         Assets. The BCE may be required to store mobility bags, a home station training kit,
AFMAN32-1084 20 APRIL 2012                                                                    221


          and camouflage netting and may require a mobility staging area and space for
          repairing assigned equipment (including tents) and space for building team equipment
          into deployable packages.
      3.1.31.3. Scope Determination. The BCE activity usually requires 0.09 m2 (1 ft2) of
      environmentally controlled storage space for each square meter of zonal maintenance
      space. In regions that experience severe winters (other than arctic areas), the BCE may
      need 0.11 m2 (1.2 ft2) of storage space for each square foot for zonal maintenance space.
      In arctic regions, the requirement can be combined with CATCODE 219947 and, in part,
      CATCODE 452255. Support areas should be sized to maximize storage space while
      allowing adequate support for day-to-day administrative and personnel activities in the
      warehouse. Table 3.13 lists established planning factors for environmentally controlled
      warehouse gross space for BCE organizations. To estimate space for shipping and
      receiving, consider the type, number, and flow of items. Plan for 0.46 m2 (5.0 ft2) of
      combined storage (CATCODEs 214945, 214946 and 214947) for each square meter of
      zonal maintenance space.
      3.1.31.4. Dimensions. See Table 3.13.
      3.1.31.5. Design Considerations.
          3.1.31.5.1. Expanding Available Storage Capability. Several alternatives are
          available for expanding insufficient storage space. The first alternative is to redesign
          the warehouse layout and install equipment that increases storage capacity. The
          second alternative is to use vertical space for a mezzanine (if ceiling height permits).
          Free standing mezzanines can double the usable storage space by creating space
          above existing storage or administrative areas. A third alternative is to use staging
          containers for orders that are 100 percent material complete but not scheduled to start
          for several months. Staging containers weighing up to 907 kg (2,000 lbs) can be
          stacked four high away from the active section of the warehouse. Collapsible staging
          containers provide an alternative to storing oddly shaped and sized items for special
          work orders. A fourth alternative is to construct or acquire another facility.

      3.1.32.1. Description. This facility provides covered storage for installation and
      maintenance equipment and supplies that do not need warehouse storage but do need
      protection from the weather. Items stored in this facility usually include steel, vitreous
      clay, concrete pipe, roofing material, crating material, and certain plumbing and electrical
      supplies. See paragraph 3.1.28 for further information.
      3.1.32.2. Requirements Determination. See paragraph 3.1.28 in this Manual.
      3.1.32.3. Scope Determination. The size is approximately equal to the size of the Base
      Engineer Maintenance Shop (CATCODE 219944). In arctic regions, the ratio of shed
      space to shop space can vary from 0.0 to 4.0, depending on the amount of shed space
      allowance transferred to Base Engineer Covered Storage Facility (CATCODE 219946),
      and on the amount of Base Civil Engineer Open Storage (CATCODE 452255)
      transferred to covered storage or sheds. Plan for 0.46 m2 (5.0 ft2) of combined storage
      (CATCODEs 214945, 214946 and 214947) for each square meter of zonal maintenance
      space.

                              FACILITY CLASS 4, SUPPLY

4.1. Category Group 41, Liquid Storage - Fuel and Nonpropellants.
   4.1.1. Storage Requirement.
      4.1.1.1. The total requirement for liquid fuel storage will be calculated on the basis of
      programming guidance furnished by Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) and
      requirements established in the Inventory Management Plan. Tankage will be
      programmed in standard size tanks using guidance in UFC 3-460-01.
      4.1.1.2. Storage tanks for base liquids and liquid fuel, such as described in this chapter,
      require security protection under policies given in AFI 31-101. Areas containing these
      tanks are protected by lights (CATCODE 812926), fences (CATCODE 872274), and
      security alarms (CATCODE 872841). See criteria provided in this Manual for the
      individual category codes. Additional security aids such as sensors and other detection
      devices are provided as feasible. Storage areas may include dispensing and operating
      facilities, such as described under Liquid Oxygen Storage (CATCODE 442258).
      4.1.1.3. Projects for facilities storing or handling bulk fuel supplied by DESC are
      normally programmed through the appropriate MAJCOM to DESC for funding/MILCON
      program management. Locate facilities to comply with explosives safety standards.
   4.1.2. Number and Size of Tanks. The determination of the number of tanks to be used for
   a particular storage requirement will be based on the following requirements and Jet Fuel
   Storage (CATCODE 411135).
      4.1.2.1. A minimum of two bulk tanks are required, regardless of the storage quantity,
      due to fuels quantity control measures.
      4.1.2.2. Three or more tanks are required for all requirements over 31,800 m3 (200,000
      barrels).
      4.1.2.3. Individual capacity of any tank will not exceed 15,900 m3 (100,000 barrels)
      unless authorization is obtained from AFCESA/CEO.
   4.1.3. Use of Aboveground and Underground Tanks.
      4.1.3.1. Aboveground tanks will be used for bulk storage of petroleum products within
      CONUS unless special authorization for underground tanks is obtained from the DoD
      Fuel Facility Engineering Panel through the Air Force representative from
      AFCESA/CEO. The use of underground tanks will normally be limited to small size
      operating tanks, storage at highly essential overseas bases, and war reserve storage.
      Control devices such as leak detection and automatic tank gauging will be provided as an
      integral component of all tanks. See section 8.5 of UFC 3-460-01 for secondary
      containment requirements for aboveground tanks.
      4.1.3.2. Underground tanks include completely buried tanks, semi-buried, and cut and
      cover tanks, and surface-installed and mounded-over tanks.

  4.1.4. Types of Tanks.
      4.1.4.1. Aboveground covered floating pan tanks in capacities of 159 m3 (1,000 barrels)
      or greater IAW UFC 3-600-01.
      4.1.4.2. Aboveground cone roof tanks for low volatile products in all capacities. These
      are also used for highly volatile products in capacities under 1,000 barrels.
      4.1.4.3. Horizontal aboveground cylindrical tanks for operating storage of all types of
      products, usually in small-capacity tanks. Do not use tanks of this type in capacities of
      151 m3 (40,000 gallons) or more.
      4.1.4.4. Vertical underground tanks, when authorized, for all types of products,
      regardless of the volatility.
      4.1.4.5. Horizontal underground tanks for all types of products, usually in small-capacity
      tanks. They are provided for operating tanks serving vehicle service stations, for alcohol
      storage tanks, and for operating tanks at truck fill stands where required. Use double wall
      construction for all underground storage tanks and do not use tanks of this type in
      capacities of 189,000 liters (50,000 gallons) or more.
  4.1.5. Siting Requirements and Pollution Control.
      4.1.5.1. In planning storage areas, the criteria given in UFC 3-460-01 on siting
      clearances and dikes should be followed.
      4.1.5.2. All liquid fuel storage facilities must be provided with positive methods to
      preclude discharge of pollutants to the surrounding atmosphere, ground, or waters. Tanks
      with cone roofs and internal floating pans shall be used for above-ground storage of all
      types of jet fuel and for volatile petroleum products having a flashpoint under 38°C
      (100°F). All aboveground storage tanks 2.5 m3 (55 gal) capacity and larger will be
      enclosed within a diked area in accordance with Section 311(j) of the CWA, requirements
      set forth in 40 CFR part 12, and UFC 3-460-01. Provisions will be made for removing
      water from diked areas through a drain pipe with a lock-type shutoff valve. The valve
      will remain closed at all times except when draining water from the diked basin. A
      designated/authorized person will be physically present at all times in the immediate area
      when the dike drain valve(s) is in the open position.
  4.1.6. Diesel Fuel Storage.

         CATCODE: 411134

         OPR: AFPET/PTOT

         OCR: AFCESA/CEO, AF/A4LE

      4.1.6.1. Description. On-base tankage levels for peacetime operating stock (POS) in
      CONUS and overseas are provided on the basis of programming guidance provided by
      AF/A4LE.
AFMAN32-1084 20 APRIL 2012                                                                  229


     4.1.6.2. Requirements Determination. Fuel storage requirements should be obtained
     from either the base or MAJCOM/A4 office. From actual experience or planned ground
     fuel consumption and resupply, total bulk ground fuel tankage can be determined in a
     manner similar to that stated for jet fuel storage (CATCODE 411135). See AFI 32-7044,
     UFC 3-460-01 and 40 CFR 280, Underground Storage Tanks, for specific guidance and
     requirements. See Category Group 41 at the beginning of this chapter.
     4.1.6.3. Scope Determination.
         4.1.6.3.1. Tank Farms. Where motor gasoline is delivered by tank car, intermediate
         storage tanks of no less than 45,000 liter (12,000 gallon) capacity will be provided at
         the tank farm. Truck loading stations will be provided at the intermediate storage
         area.
         4.1.6.3.2. Exchange Service Stations. Storage capacity of 45,000 liters may be
         provided for each product. At bases where high volumes of fuels are dispensed, a
         minimum of two tanks per grade of product must be provided, and the tanks should
         be 45,000 liters or larger capacity to accommodate commercial tank truck deliveries.
         4.1.6.3.3. Civil Engineer Facilities. Storage capacity of 19,000 liters (5,000
         gallons) per type of fuel may be provided in the Civil Engineer compound.
     4.1.6.4. Dimensions. See paragraph 4.1.6.3 above. Bulk tankage for ground fuels
     requires tanks of no less than 45,000 liter capacity per type of fuel, either single or
     manifolded together.
     4.1.6.5. Design Considerations. There should be at least one 19 liter/second (300
     gallon per minute [gpm]) bottom-loading fillstand with a temperature compensated meter
     per type of fuel. The primary and secondary methods of fuel receipt (tank truck, rail)
     should be taken into consideration when determining total tankage, location, and off-
     loading requirements for each product. At isolated stations, specified supply levels may
     be inadequate. In such instances, higher levels may be justified.
  4.1.7. Jet Fuel Storage.
         FAC: 4111

         CATCODE: 411135

         OPR: AFPET/PTOT

         OCR: AFCESA/CEO, AF/A4LE

     4.1.7.1. Description. See paragraph 4.1.1 above.
     4.1.7.2. Requirements Determination. The total tankage required for jet fuel is the
     sum of the peacetime and war reserve tankage requirements. This may be adjusted up or
     down by DESC based on additional distribution needs or nearby available war reserve
     fuel.
     4.1.7.3. Scope Determination. POS authorization is the amount of fuel required to
     sustain peacetime operation in support of military demands to be maintained at a Defense
230                                                         AFMAN32-1084 20 APRIL 2012


      Fuel Support Point (DFSP). Peacetime requirement is based on the number and types of
      aircraft assigned to the base for the longest time period. The computation information for
      the POS calculation is in DoD 4140.25-M Volume II, DoD Management of Bulk
      Petroleum Products, Natural Gas, and Coal, available on the Defense Link website.
      4.1.7.4. Dimensions. See paragraph 4.1.1 above.
      4.1.7.5. Design Considerations. See paragraph 4.1.1 above.
  4.1.8. Storage Special Fuel.
         FAC: 4111

         CATCODE: 411139

         OPR: AFPET/PTOT

         OCR: AFCESA/CEO, AF/A4LE

      4.1.8.1. Description. The storage of liquid chemicals in bulk is authorized when the
      action will result in procurement, transportation, and handling economies, and bulk
      storage can be accomplished without danger or deterioration losses.
      4.1.8.2. Requirements Determination. Under the circumstances described above, bulk
      chemical storage is authorized for any Air Force activity that annually consumes at least
      one tank truckload of any one chemical, or approximately 19,000 liters (4,000 gallons).
      The method of commercial peacetime delivery of bulk chemicals to an installation must
      be determined in advance to provide adequate unloading facilities and to determine the
      quantity of the storage required.
         4.1.8.2.1. Peacetime bulk storage requirements will be based on tankage necessary to
         maintain a 15-day stock level, based on an average 15-day consumption rate, but in
         no case will tankage be less than a standard 30,000 liter (8,000 gallon) tank if
         deliveries are made by tank truck, or less than a standard 45,000 liter (12,000 gallon)
         tank if deliveries are made by tank car. Since the minimum tankage requirement in
         practically every instance will be substantially in excess of 15-day stock level, no
         additional tankage should be required to meet peak loads. If cleaning and
         maintenance of the facility is necessary, supply should be temporarily handled in
         drums.
         4.1.8.2.2. Within tankage availability, one full railroad tank car or tank truckload
         may be shipped, although this may temporarily raise stocks above a 15-day level.
         4.1.8.2.3. Any overseas war chemical reserves may be stored in underground tanks
         when economies will result, and acceptable sources of supply are thus developed.
      4.1.8.3. Scope Determination. Tankage requirements for any activity will not exceed
      the sum of the peacetime requirement plus the wartime requirement. Use underground
      storage tanks only when required by health and safety reasons or mission requirements.
      Tankage requirements will be fully justified in MAJCOM budget estimates and will be
      supported by mathematical calculations showing the savings to be derived from storing
      chemicals in bulk.

      stainless steel. Manual isolation valves should be either stainless steel or carbon steel type
      with electrolysis nickel internal coating. Any program changes to JPTS tankage must be
      coordinated with ACC/A4RM.
4.2. Category Group 42, Ammunition Storage
   4.2.1. Overview.
      4.2.1.1. Basis for Requirements. The quantity and type of explosives storage facilities
      required at an installation will vary with the following conditions:
          4.2.1.1.1. Operating requirements (i.e., the number and type of functions, operations,
          or specialized munitions activities to be performed);
          4.2.1.1.2. The quantity and type of munitions to be stored or handled, such as war
          readiness materiel (WRM) munitions, operating and training munitions, combat
          munitions, munitions for specialized activities such as area reserve storage and
          redistribution, and munitions airlift;
          4.2.1.1.3. Site characteristics such as physical limits and expansion capabilities of the
          ammo storage area, type and arrangement of existing storage facilities, and objectives
          of the base master plan; and
          4.2.1.1.4. The type of proposed storage structures preferred or required at the storage
          site.
   4.2.2. Security Criteria for Facilities Protecting Arms, Ammunition, and Explosives
   (AA&E). Refer to the following documents for further information: U.S. Air Force
   Installation Force Protection Guide; MIL HDBK 1013/1A, Design Guidelines For Physical
   Security of Facilities; MIL HDBK 1013/10, Design Guidelines For Security Fencing, Gates,
   Barriers, and Guard Facilities; DODI 2000.16, DoD Antiterrorism (AT) Standards; UFC 4-
   010-01, AFMAN 32-1071, Volumes 1, 2, and 3, Security Engineering Manuals (FOUO); and
   DoD 5100.76-M, Physical Security of Sensitive Conventional Arms, Ammunition, and
   Explosives.
      4.2.2.1. Facilities used to store AA&E must meet the following minimum requirements.
          4.2.2.1.1. Walls should consist of 200 mm (8 in) of concrete reinforced with No. 4
          reinforcing bars. The reinforcing bars must be placed 225 mm (9 in) on center both
          horizontally and vertically and staggered on each face to form a grid approximately
          113 mm (4.5 in) square. Walls may also be constructed of 200 mm (8 in) concrete
          blocks with No. 4 reinforcing bars threaded through the blocks. All block cavities
          must be filled with mortar or concrete. Walls will also have horizontal joint
          reinforcement at every course, or at a minimum, 200 mm (8 in) of brick interlocked
          between inner and outer courses.
          4.2.2.1.2. Ceilings and roofs shall be designed to meet the load and structural safety
          requirements of the spans. The slabs should offer security equal to that provided by
232                                                           AFMAN32-1084 20 APRIL 2012


         the walls. Reinforcing bar spacing, using No. 4 reinforcing bars, should form a grid
         where the area of any opening does not exceed 0.062 m2 (96 in2). If the ceiling or roof
         is of concrete pan-joist construction, the thinnest portion shall not be less than 150
         mm (6 in). The reinforcing grid requirements for flat slab construction apply. Roof
         structures and ceilings of existing facilities shall provide an equal or greater degree of
         security than the windows and doors.
         4.2.2.1.3. Floors shall be designed and constructed to meet load and structural safety
         requirements. Floors will be a minimum of 15 cm (6 in) of concrete construction
         reinforced with 150 mm x 150 mm (6 in x 6 in) W4xW4 mesh or equivalent bars. For
         the purposes of security, the ceiling standard applies where the floor slab acts as the
         ceiling of an underlying room or area.
         4.2.2.1.4. Doors will be 4.5 cm (1-3/4 in) solid or laminated wood with 12 gauge
         steel plate on the outside face, or standard 44 mm (1-3/4 in) hollow metal industrial
         type construction, with a minimum of 2 mm (14 gauge) steel skin plate, internally
         reinforced vertically with continuous steel stiffeners, spaced 150 mm (6 in) maximum
         on center. Door bucks, frames, and keepers shall be rigidly anchored and have anti-
         spread space filler reinforcement to prevent disengagement of the lock bolt by prying
         or jacking of the door frame. The frames and locks for both interior and exterior doors
         shall be designed and installed to prevent the removal of the frame facing or the built-
         in locking mechanism sufficiently to disengage the lock bolt from the outside when
         the door is locked. Construction requirements for door frames and thresholds shall be
         as exacting as for the doors. A Class 5 steel vault door with a built-in three position
         dial type changeable combination lock may be used in lieu of other doors or locks.
         4.2.2.1.5. Door hinges shall be fixed pin security hinge type or equivalent. The
         exposed hinge pins shall be peened by spot welding or some other means to prevent
         removal. Hinge mounting screws will not be exposed to the outside of the room.
         4.2.2.1.6. Exterior and interior lighting shall be provided for all arms storage rooms
         or buildings.
  4.2.3. Pertinent Documents.
      4.2.3.1. Munitions levels are described in the following documents or publications.
      4.2.3.2. Levels for War Readiness Materiel. The War Consumables Distribution
      Objectives (WCDO) lists the number and type of munitions items (along with other war
      consumables such as POL, chaff, film, etc.) that are desired to be prepositioned at the
      listed base. Subject to command guidance, this document provides the basis for WRM
      munitions storage guidance.
      4.2.3.3. Operating and Training Levels. Each active air base will have a requirement
      to store and maintain certain day-to-day usage munitions and residue generated during
      explosives operations. These will normally include training munitions per AFI 11-212;
      AFCAT 21-209, Volume 1; AFCAT 21-209 Volume 2, Demolition Munitions; Air Force
      Standard for Non-Expendable Air Munitions Training Authorizations; and current
      operational plans (OPLAN).
AFMAN32-1084 20 APRIL 2012                                                                     233


     4.2.3.4. Nuclear weapons storage facilities are additive to those required for other
     explosives storage and will be computed on the assigned and projected weapons
     requirements using applicable criteria in 11N series TOs, AFMAN 91-201, and DoD S-
     5210.41-M, Vols. 1-3.
     4.2.3.5. Basic reference documents for facility planning purposes consist of: AFI 32-
     1021, AFMAN 91-201, and pertinent TOs of the 11A, 11C, 11N, and 11P series.
  4.2.4. General Guidance.
     4.2.4.1. Explosives will normally be stored in a secure area reserved exclusively for
     explosives storage as defined in AFMAN 91-201 and AFI 21-201, Conventional
     Munitions Maintenance Management.
     4.2.4.2. Requirements    Determination. An      installation’s   explosive   storage
     requirements are based on the unit’s mission, support, training, and OPLAN
     requirements. The manner in which this requirement is met will be in accordance with
     pertinent TOs of the 11A, 11C, 11N, and 11P series as well as AFMAN 91-201.
     Supplemental documentation may include master storage plans and Storage Capability
     Reports.
        4.2.4.2.1. Calculating Storage Requirements. Storage space requirements will
        involve several factors unique to each individual installation. These factors may
        include Q-D limitations of existing storage facilities, availability of existing facilities,
        possible re-warehousing of existing stock, Net Explosive Weight (NEW) of items to
        be stored, physical size of the item to be stored, length of time the item is expected to
        be stored, frequency of replacement stockage, regulatory requirements as to type of
        facility, and storage configuration. The general guidance provided in Figure 4.1
        provides only some of the factors to be considered in calculations.
     4.2.4.3. Scope Determination. Explosives safety criteria applicable to all aspects of
     planning for explosives facilities are contained in AFMAN 91-201. Q-D class and storage
     compatibility groups must be considered for all items. All planned and programmed
     facility requirements must be based on a site plan which has been reviewed and approved
     under procedures given in AFMAN 91-201. Explosives storage and operating facilities
     must be equipped with lightning protection and may require grounding and bonding as
     required by AFMAN 91-201. Where two or more commands occupy an installation, the
     explosives storage facilities will be integrated to the maximum extent possible in
     accordance with the restrictions/requirements of AFMAN 91-201 and as specified in AFI
     32-1065.
     4.2.4.4. Dimensions. See paragraph 4.2.4.5 below.
     4.2.4.5. Design Considerations. Planning and land acquisition for explosives storage
     should ensure the following.
        4.2.4.5.1. Each existing and proposed facility will always be able to store a
        reasonable weight of explosives (i.e., at or near design capacity of the structure or the
        capacity as originally sited) without violating Q-D criteria given in AFMAN 91-201.
        4.2.4.5.2. The multi-mission concept of base development is met or maintained. See
        AFI 32-1021 for additional guidance.
234                                                        AFMAN32-1084 20 APRIL 2012


        4.2.4.5.3. In planning storage requirements at overseas locations, host country Q-D
        criteria must be considered in providing protection to their exposures. However,
        AFMAN 91-201 criteria will be followed in connection with all planning and
        operations involving exposures of U.S. personnel and property (equipment, buildings,
        etc.) to explosives hazards, unless otherwise specifically authorized to deviate from
        this procedure.
        4.2.4.5.4. Developing storage requirements involves joint efforts by munitions,
        explosives safety, and civil engineering offices. Munitions offices develop explosives
        storage facility requirements including basic floor space requirements, determine
        special functional requirements, and justify the need to build or modify facilities.
        Using this information, civil engineering offices will, in coordination with explosives
        safety, perform site selection, develop site plans and land requirements, establish
        design specifications, and forward completed plans for explosives safety review as
        required by AFMAN 91-201. The foregoing applies to all facilities being sited that
        affect Q-D criteria in any way or that involve manufacturing, processing, storing,
        handling, using, and disposing of explosives. When major modifications to explosives
        facilities or to associated structures within inhabited building distance of explosives
        facilities are planned, a change to the site plan will be forwarded in accordance with
        AFMAN 91-201.
        4.2.4.5.5. Planning for explosives storage areas must give recognition to other
        facilities used in processing, handling, maintaining, using, and disposing of weapons
        such as Explosives Ordnance Disposal (CATCODE 141165), Weapons and Release
        Systems Shop (CATCODE 215552), Surveillance and Inspection Shop (CATCODE
        215582), Conventional Munitions Shop (CATCODE 216642), and Demolition and
        Burning Facility (CATCODE 831173).
        4.2.4.5.6. All structures used in the storage of high explosives shall be designed to
        resist the effects of accidental explosions approved by the Department of Defense
        Explosive Safety Board (DDESB) and the United States Army Corps of Engineers
        (USACE), which meet the criteria for explosive storage.
        4.2.4.5.7. An environmental assessment, in accordance with AFI 32-7045, is
        required.
        4.2.4.5.8. Because of the potentially damaging effects of explosives mishaps,
        separate facilities should be provided for explosives operations based on the type of
        hazards involved.
        4.2.4.5.9. Numbers such as AD 33-15-63 refer to USACE drawings, which are
        available from the USACE Huntsville Division, 106 Wynn Drive, Huntsville,
        Alabama, 35805-1957.

        OPR: AF/A4LW

        OCR: AFSC/SEW

     4.2.10.1. Description. The steel-arch, earth-covered igloo has a concrete floor,
     foundations, side arches, and rear and front walls. The structures provide protection
     against propagating explosions between adjacent storage spaces within the common
     mound. The steel arch type is normally more economical to construct than the reinforced
     concrete igloo. This is especially true where the cost of additional land area and a
     connecting road net required to construct a multiple igloo complex is considered.
     4.2.10.2. Requirements Determination. For storage of large volumes of explosives
     above 113,000 kg (250,000 pounds) NEW, igloos approved as standard according to
     DoD 6055.9-Std, are mandatory. See general guidance under paragraphs 4.2.1, 4.2.2,
     4.2.3, and 4.2.4.
     4.2.10.3. Scope Determination. Igloos are usually constructed based on DDESB
     approval as standard structures, such as AW 33-15-64 (USACE drawing), for storage of
     explosives. USACE drawings are available from the USACE Huntsville Division, 106
     Wynn Drive, Huntsville, Alabama, 35805-1957.
     4.2.10.4. Dimensions. Igloos may be constructed in variable lengths of 0.6 m (2 ft)
     increments and widths up to 9.1 m (30 ft).

         4.2.11.1.7. Bomb Preload Station – The station consists of equipment used to preload
         bombs on bomb racks and supporting site improvements. Typical equipment includes
         a gantry and conveyer operation lines to inspect, assemble, and load bombs on bomb
         racks. There are various types of stations, and the amount of equipment required
         depends on unit missions.

Figure 4.1. Example A: Explosive Weight Limited Items (EWL).
 Computing Explosives Storage Requirements:

 EWL items have a high explosive weight to total weight ratio. The number of this type of item
 that may be stored in any one facility is limited by the total allowable NEW for any given
 facility or location. This is based upon the limits imposed by explosives Q-D criteria to
 existing and programmed facilities or other exposures and/or maximum net explosives weight
 permitted for the particular explosives class or facility design. To determine the number of
 storage structures required, use the following formula:



                  A / B = C, and D / C = Number of Storage Structure Locations



 Where:

  A = Total allowable NEW for any single location.

  B = NEW of one type of EWL item to be stored (from references in paragraph 4.2.3.)

  C = Number of EWL items to be stored in a single location.

  D = Total number of each type of EWL item authorized (from published documents).



 Example:

 To store: 8,000 items of type M117, 340 kg (750 pound) bombs.

 Total allowable NEW for any single location = 45,000 kg (100,000 pounds).

 NEW of one item = 175 kg (386 pounds).



                  A/B=C                     45,000 kg / 175 kg = 257



          D / C = Number of storage 8,000 / 257 = 31.1 (31 rounded) structure locations.

Figure 4.1.1. Example B: Cube Limited (CL) Items.
 Computing Explosives Storage Requirements:

 CL items are bulky with a low explosive weight ratio. The number that may be stored in any
 one facility will be normally limited by their size and gross weight. However, full
 consideration must be given to limits imposed by Q-D criteria, storage compatibility criteria,
 and lot separation requirements. To determine the number of storage structures required, use
 the following formula for each grouping of compatible items to be stored. (See TO 11A-1-61
 for storage drawings for some high density magazine loading guidance.)


                                             PF x N = TC

 Where:

  PF = Package Cubic Meters (m3) Listed Per Item (from federal stock class [FSC] 1300)

  N = Total number of each type of CL items

  TC = Total cube of each type of CL items


                                           TC / SH = SF


 Where:

  SH = Planned stack height for each type of CL item

  SM = Preliminary floor space requirement in square meters


                                       SM x 1.38 = AFS


 Where:

  1.38 = Factor to allow for aisle space

  AFS = Actual floor space required


                          AFS / TF = Number of structures required.
AFMAN32-1084 20 APRIL 2012                                                                241


 Where:

  TF = Total floor space available in type of structure selected for storage



 Example:

 To Store: 350,000 rounds of 20 mm ammo

 Cube for 100-round T-46 Ammo Box = 0.037 m3 (1.3 ft3 from FSC 1300)

 Cube for one round of ammo = 0.00037 m3 (0.013 ft3)

 Stack height (selected) = 1.9 m (6.25 ft)

 Floor space available in selected storage structure = 74 m2 (800 ft2)



                   PF x N = TC               0.00037 m3 x 350,000 = 129.5 m3


                  TC / SH = SM                   129.5 m3 / 1.9 m = 68 m2


                  SM x 1.38 = AFS                68 m2 x 1.38 = 94 m2


            AFS / TF = Number of 94 m2 /74 m2 = 1.27 (2.0 rounded) structures required

                     PF x N = TC             0.217 m3 x 5,500 = 1,194 m3


                     TC / SH = SM           1,194 m3 / 1.8 m = 663 m2


                   SM x 1.38 = AFS          663 m2 x 1.38 = 915 m2

4.3. Category Group 44, Supply Storage Facilities (Covered Storage).
   4.3.1. General Criteria.
       4.3.1.1. Description. The term ―LRS facilities‖ applies to facilities required to store
       material and equipment under the accountability of the LRS or counterparts in base
       tenant organizations. They are Hazardous Storage (CATCODE 442257), Supply and
       Equipment (CATCODE 442628), Warehouse Supply and Equipment (CATCODE
       442758), and Open Storage Supply (CATCODE 452252).
       4.3.1.2. Requirements Determination. The four CATCODEs above are not to be used
       to identify sheds, warehouses, and yards that are used to store organizational storage
       items for which accountability rests with using organizations. The space criteria given in
       this Manual for operating buildings, shops, and so forth, are intended to provide storage
       space for the material and equipment used in daily operations as well as operating space.
       The facility code of the operating building applies to such storage space whether it
       occupies space in the operating building or in a separate building. An exception to this
       occurs when an activity's storage requirement represents a significant part of its total
       facility requirement and, therefore, has been recognized by the establishment of a
       separate facility and facility code. Where there is evidence that organizational storage
       needs are not adequately recognized in current criteria, the activity identifying the need
       should initiate corrective action under procedures given in AFI 32-1024.
       4.3.1.3. Computing Supply Storage Requirements.
AFMAN32-1084 20 APRIL 2012                                                                         243


             4.3.1.3.1. Space requirements for the four facilities listed in paragraph 4.3.1.1 are
             computed from the space factors given in Tables 4.1 and 4.2, from the additional
             criteria given below, and in the descriptions of the individual facilities. The factors
             used in Tables 4.1 and 4.2 represent space requirements for normal authorized stock
             levels to support all assigned aircraft and all assigned active military personnel and
             civilian employees.
             4.3.1.3.2. Space for Mobile Readiness Spare Packages (MRSP) is additive to that
             computed under Tables 4.1 and 4.2 (below). Total space requirements in any
             appropriate combination of warehouse, shed, or open yard are given in Table 4.3,
             below.
             4.3.1.3.3. Additional storage space is authorized for storing the property in the
             equipment account. This additional space is 10 percent of the space computed in
             accordance with paragraph 4.3.1.3.1.
             4.3.1.3.4. When existing warehouses have clearances between the floor and the
             bottom of the ceiling joist or truss of 5.5 m (18 ft) or more, use double-deck
             construction within the existing facility before programming a new facility or an
             addition to the existing facility. The effects of double-decking on the building fire
             protection system should be recognized.

NOTES:

(All notes are General Notes)

1. Space requirements for a specific Mobile Distribution System (MDS) will be computed
using the category which most closely relates to the MDS. The number of aircraft will be
the total of PAA aircraft plus the number of Backup Aircraft Inventory (BAI) aircraft
normally on hand.

2. Refer to Chapter 2, AFJMAN 23-210, Joint Service Manual (JSM) for Storage and
Materials Handling when developing storage space requirements.

3. Supplies stored in warehouses must make maximum use of attainable cube. This is
equally applicable to items stored in bins, pallet racks, or bulk areas.

4. Allow additional space for operational flexibility. This generally is 15 percent of net
available area (see paragraph 2-6f, AFJMAN 23-210).

5. The floor space created by a mezzanine will be added to normal floor space square
footage to determine space requirements versus assigned when the facility is equipped with
a mezzanine or a mezzanine is planned.

6. When high-rise bins or racks are used in a facility, reduce the square footage
requirements by 25 percent for each 1.2 m (4 ft) of vertical shelving that exceeds the
normal 2.1 m (7 ft). The percentage adjustment should only apply to the square footage
/square meters of the area where the bins or racks (high-rise) exceed 2.1 m (7 ft).
(Example: If bin/rack height is 3.4 m (11 ft), it equals a 25 percent reduction. If bin/rack

      4.3.2.1. Description. This facility is required to store hazardous materials that cannot be
      stored in supply and equipment sheds or warehouses (CATCODEs 442628 and 442758).
      The guidance on storage criteria and fire safety is given in Air Force Interservice Manual
      24-204(I), Preparing Hazardous Materials for Military Air Shipments, and AFJMAN 23-
      210, Joint Service Manual (JSM) for Storage and Materials Handling. Standards for
      hazardous waste containment buildings are contained in 40 CFR 264 and 265, Subpart
      DD. Consult AFCEE Facility Planning and Design Guide: HAZMART (Hazardous
      Material Pharmacy) for additional information and guidance.
      4.3.2.2. Requirements Determination. Space requirements vary with the availability of
      other suitable storage facilities as indicated above. Flammable/combustible liquids and
      compressed gases are stored in this facility. Standard sheds and warehouses may be used
      when available, and no serious fire or safety hazards will result. This facility will be a
      single purpose structure preferably of non-combustible construction, one story in height
      without basement or crawl space, and detached or separated from other buildings by at
      least 15 m (50 ft). This space requirement is included in CATCODE 442758 and/or
      CATCODE 442628 and is computed as described in paragraph 5.4.1.3 when standard
 248                                                               AFMAN32-1084 20 APRIL 2012


       facilities are used. As indicated in safety requirements limit the size of single facilities to
       1,860 m2 (20,000 ft2). See Note 1 in Table 4.4.
       4.3.2.3. Scope Determination. CATCODE 442257 applies only to the specially
       designed storage facility and not to standard structures that are used to store hazardous
       material. Furthermore, the category code does not apply to small outbuildings used to
       store an activity's working supply of hazardous materials. Such outbuildings are properly
       reported under the category code of the activity's operating building or shop. See notes in
       Table 4.4.
       4.3.2.4. Dimensions. See Table 4.4.
       4.3.2.5. Design Considerations. See AFCEE Facility Planning and Design Guide:
       HAZMART. Hazardous materials storage shall comply with local, state and federal
       requirements and other guidance as defined in paragraphs 1.3.1 and 1.8.6.

 NOTES:

 1. This facility is required to store, issue, reissue, and collect hazardous materials that
 cannot be stored in supply and equipment sheds or warehouses (CATCODE 442628 and
 442758) and other hazardous materials centrally controlled under the hazardous material
 pharmacy concept. These hazardous materials are generally defined as all items on Federal
 Standard 313C Table I regardless of hazard (Federal Stock Class 68XX, 7930, 80XX
 [8020 excluded], 9150 and 9160), items on Table II defined as hazardous, and other items
 requiring control for environmental, health, or safety reasons (e.g., Federal Stock Class
 6135 and 6140 for batteries, radioactive material, items containing mercury). The guidance
 on storage criteria and fire safety is given in AFJMAN 24-204 and AFJMAN 23-210.

 2. To conform to hazardous material storage requirements it is recommended that eight
AFMAN32-1084 20 APRIL 2012                                                                      249


 separated storage areas be used: reuse-reutilization, flammable, corrosive, reactive,
 oxidizer, poison, acid, and combustible.

 3. This space projection will meet storage, distribution, collection, reissue, and satellite
 hazardous waste accumulation point (72 hours limit when full) minimum requirements and
 is based on the following two assumptions: (1)The LRS will provide courtesy storage for
 oils and lubricants; and (2) civil engineering hazardous materials will be provided
 segregated storage in the CE warehouse.

 4. Multiply this figure by the base population.

 5. Multiply this figure by the maximum number of persons on any one shift, not by base
 population. The resulting figure is the gross area required to accommodate office, customer
 service areas, hallways, lockers, latrine, and mechanical room. See Chapter 6 of this
 Manual for authorized office types and sizes.

 6. For a base population of up to 2,000, recommended warehouse space is 260 m2 (2,800
 ft2) and safety storage or shed space is 93 m2 (1,000 ft2).

 7. LRS will allocate securable open storage space as required.

      4.3.4.1. Description. Shed space is required to store supplies, equipment, and material
      not requiring closed warehouse space but requiring covered protection from the weather
      because of the nature of material or manner in which they are packed. It may also include
      lumber storage exclusive of that stored by Civil Engineering. Space for receiving and
      shipping activities may be included.
      4.3.4.2. Requirements Determination. Shed storage space is constructed without
      complete side and end walls. See paragraph 4.3.1.3 for computing space requirements.

      4.3.5.1. Description. Warehouse space is required for bulk and bin storage of materials
      for which maximum protection from the weather is authorized.
      4.3.5.2. Requirements Determination. Warehouse space includes:
         4.3.5.2.1. Supplies and equipment needed to support base operations and fuels
         operations;
         4.3.5.2.2. Receiving, storage issue, inspection, pickup and delivery activities;
         4.3.5.2.3. Warehouse offices exclusive of offices in Supply Administration
         (CATCODE 610122);
         4.3.5.2.4. Flyaway or Mobility Kit Storage are for mobility readiness and contain
         spare parts, special equipment, and supplies needed to maintain aircraft for short
         periods of time away from their home base;
         4.3.5.2.5. Dangerous material, exclusive of explosives and ammunition, whose
         storage accommodations satisfy guidance given in AFJMAN 24-204 and AFJMAN
         23-210;

                authorized storage space for mobility bags. This space is additive to that listed
                under Tables 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3 (above).
                4.3.5.2.7.2. Space will be computed at 0.85 m3 (3 ft3) per bag if the type of bag to
                be stored has been approved by the Air Force.
                4.3.5.2.7.3. Commands will store bags in a manner to utilize the maximum
                attainable stacking heights in warehouses. The best space utilization can be
                obtained by storing in bulk or on pallet racks.
                4.3.5.2.7.4. Mobility bag storage is the responsibility of the LRS. While actual
                storage may be decentralized to other organizations if they have existing facilities
                available to store the bags, facilities will not be built at decentralized locations in
                order to accommodate mobility bag storage. Further, there is no objection to
                commanders issuing bags to personnel with mobility assignments in lieu of
                storing bags within the unit on a centralized or decentralized basis.
         4.3.5.3. Scope Determinations. In addition to the space provided under paragraph
         4.3.1.3, overseas installations that are en-route or turnaround-stations for AMC airlift
         aircraft and employ the AMC Forward Supply Support System require additional
         warehouse space. The storage consists of aircraft items, such as built-up engines,
         radomes, recovery kits, and so forth, that are peculiar to the AMC mission design and
         series of aircraft and that are not normally stocked by the host base. Total item
         requirements, and thus warehouse space requirements, vary with traffic, but the average
         requirement is approximately 700 m2 (7,500 ft2).
            4.3.5.3.1. See paragraph 4.1 for restrictions on the use of CATCODE 442758. The
            additive storage requirements in Table 4.5 may be authorized at the discretion of the
            MAJCOM.
         4.3.5.4. Dimensions. Space requirements are computed under paragraphs 4.3.1.3.

     4.3.6.1. Description. This facility stores and distributes forms and publications. The
     service facility should provide dry, heated, and reasonably dust-free space.
     4.3.6.2. Requirements Determination.
        4.3.6.2.1. Bulk and bin storage space for forms and publications is required. Space
        used for storing tabulating paper and cards used in automatic data processing
        operation requires special temperature and humidity controls.
        4.3.6.2.2. Where approved, equipment space for mechanized initial distribution and
        mechanized storage equipment is provided.
        4.3.6.2.3. Operating space is needed for activities related to receiving, shipping,
        packaging, distribution, and counter service. Where shipment and receipt of bulk
        quantities are required, the facility requires convenient access to a covered loading
        ramp or dock.
     4.3.6.3. Scope Determination.
        4.3.6.3.1. Storage requirements will be based on normal authorized levels for
        departmental forms and publications and augmented in those instances where
        worldwide/command-wide support is required, and where commands require storage
        of command forms and publications.
        4.3.6.3.2. Space requirements will vary from 186 to 929 m2 (2,000 to 10,000 ft2),
        depending on the size and type of activities served. Storage space for normal and
        reserve stocks of tabulating paper forms and card forms require between 93 to 279 m 2
        (1,000 to 3,000 ft2) of temperature and humidity controlled space.
        4.3.6.3.3. Space requirements for Publication Distribution Offices (PDO) operating
        major command distribution centers or worldwide support centers (such as AFMC’s)
        are determined on an individual basis.
        4.3.6.3.4. Where PDOs require less than 186 m2 (2,000 ft2) of space, the function
        may be located in the base or other operating headquarters, and the space reported
        under the appropriate headquarters category code.

         OCR: AF/A4LE

       4.3.8.1. Description. This facility provides storage of liquid oxygen tanks.
       4.3.8.2. Requirements Determination. All Air Force installations with a requirement
       for liquid oxygen for breathing purposes for aircrews will have a liquid oxygen
       generating/storage capability or liquid oxygen storage capacity to satisfy the requirement.
       (For Oxygen Generating Plant, see CATCODE 229986.) The decision to rely on storage
       capacity and commercial suppliers or organic Air Force generating capability will be
       based on an individual base analysis to determine the most practical procedure which will
       provide assurance of meeting the requirements.
       4.3.8.3. Scope Determination. The normal source of supply for liquid oxygen for
       breathing purposes for Air Force bases within the United States, its territories, and
       possessions is by procurement from commercial sources wherever suitable sources of
       supply are available to meet quantitative and specification requirements. In these
       instances base storage capacity will be sufficient to provide for 30 days peacetime
       requirement or 15 days alert, whichever is greater, plus WRM, plus sufficient storage to
       permit receipt of resupply in economical quantities from suppliers. In every instance a
       minimum of at least two tanks in multiples of 1,500, 7,600, or 19,000 liters (400, 2,000,
       or 5,000 gallons) will be provided to ensure continuous operation and permit periodic

     4.4.1.1. Description. This facility is an improved or paved area used to store materials
     authorized for open storage.
     4.4.1.2. Requirements Determination. At bases where mission generates a sufficient
     volume of wrecked or damaged aircraft and/or equipment to require a continuing
     reclamation activity, there may be a requirement for a storage yard.
     4.4.1.3. Scope Determination. The open yard is used to park aircraft and equipment
     being disassembled, to maneuver ground equipment used in the reclamation operation,
     and to store parts and equipment temporarily pending disposition. At bases where this
     requirement exists, the area of the open storage yard, as provided under Table 4.2, may
     be increased by 1,250 m2 (1,500 yd2). The size of the area is determined by its overall
     dimensions with no deductions for interior trackage and permanent roads. Exterior lights
     and fencing may be installed as required to deter theft.
     4.4.1.4. Dimensions. Space requirements are given in Tables 4.1           and 4.2 and in
     paragraph 4.4.1.3.
     4.4.1.5. Design Considerations. See paragraph 4.4.1 for restrictions on the use of

                                           Chapter 6

                         FACILITY CLASS 6, ADMINISTRATIVE

6.1. Category Group 61, Administrative and Administrative Support Spaces.
   6.1.1. Introduction and Program Considerations. This chapter identifies program
   requirements for Administrative and Administrative Support Spaces. These spaces support
   the administrative affairs of a military establishment and should be programmed and
   designed such that it enhances the main mission or functions of an organization. In addition
   to the area requirements, administrative and support spaces should be programmed and
   designed so that these facilities can be flexible, cost-effective, and create an atmosphere that
   increases morale, productivity, and collaboration. This Manual provides the data needed
   when programming Air Force projects using UFC 4-610-01, Administrative Facilities. Space
   authorizations listed herein may be used to establish space requirements for new
   administrative facilities, administrative relocations, or administrative space in renovated
   facilities. This Manual shall be used for administrative facilities or for administrative areas
   that are part of facilities that are not primarily administrative.
       6.1.1.1. Administrative Design Standards and Office Space Measurements. Consult
       UFC 4-610-01 for definitions and general design criteria.
       6.1.1.2. Establishing User Requirements. When using the criteria given, project
       planners and facility designers should analyze the types and numbers of building
       occupants. Justify the number of offices based on the number of authorized full time
       equivalents (FTE) in an approved manning document. Justifications for additional
       personnel must be accompanied by approved plans. This should be followed by an
       analysis of special purpose space requirements taking into account the types of activities
       being housed and efficient (maximized) usage of the space. Justifications for all special
       purpose space such as conference rooms, auditoriums, training, and computer rooms
       should include information on the number of people, recurrence of use, the amount of
       equipment, and size of equipment that requires floor space. Adjustments in both areas
       may be necessary to satisfy the criteria but must be justified. At installations,
       justifications should be vetted through CE Asset Management officials.
   6.1.2. Office Areas. Office areas are generally located in areas designated for administrative
   work and administrative support functions. Offices located within special purpose areas
   should not be counted as Office Space. Offices are typically divided into two main
   categories: ―private‖ and ―open‖. Administrative Support Space should be programmed for
   all offices. Consult AFRCH 32-1001 and ANGH 32-1084 for variances applicable to Reserve
   and Guard facilities.
       6.1.2.1. Private Offices. Private offices are assigned to individuals based on rank and/or
       duty assignment. These offices are intended to provide visual and sound privacy required
       in the course of the occupant’s duties. These offices typically have full height walls or
       partitions from finished floor to finished ceiling. Calculate the required space by
       determining the number and types of open offices (office types A-D) needed. Refer to
       Table 6.2 for allowable space for private offices.
AFMAN32-1084 20 APRIL 2012                                                                    261


     6.1.2.2. Open Offices. Open offices are programmed and designed to incorporate
     modular workstations and are typically occupied by general administrative and/or
     functional support staff. Calculate the required space by determining the number and
     types of open offices (office types E-H) needed. Refer to Table 6.2.1 for allowable open
     office area.
        6.1.2.2.1. Command Suites. A command suite is an office area configuration that
        typically houses a private office for a Commander, private offices for key staff, open
        offices for support staff, a waiting area, and administrative support space.
     6.1.2.3. Administrative Support Space. This space supports the administrative
     functions and includes all such functions not included in personal office space. For Air
     Force facilities, it includes circulation in and around office areas and space for working
     office storage, copiers, working files, printers, scanners, shredders, safes, and facsimile
     machines.
     6.1.2.4. Special Purpose Spaces. Special purpose space is defined as space which may
     be required to meet specific or special organizational functional needs. The type, size,
     and quantity of special purpose space are project specific. Refer to Table 6.3 for typical
     special purpose spaces. In facilities with multiple organizations, provide shared special
     purpose spaces for efficiency.
        6.1.2.4.1. Assembly Spaces. Assembly spaces are also special purpose spaces that
        include spaces that may be used for conferences, meetings, and training. Refer to
        Table 6.4 for assembly space calculations.
     6.1.2.5. Circulation Space. This is space used to traverse in and around all the
     administrative space types above. Use the multipliers below to establish programming
     estimates of the space needed.
  6.1.3. Categories of Administrative Space. Categories of space have been established to
  define space calculations common to administrative facilities for programming purposes.
     6.1.3.1. The Net Administrative Area includes all of an organization’s office,
     administrative support, and administrative circulation. A per person average of this can
     be used when programming, analyzing, or estimating space for relocations or space in
     renovated facilities.
     6.1.3.2. The Net Organization Space is the space defined for a distinct organization that
     is part of a shared facility. It includes the Net Administrative Area, special purpose space,
     and circulation for that organization. This is also called Usable Space and can be helpful
     when establishing the relative percentage of a shared facility that should be attributed to
     an organization.
     6.1.3.3. The Average Net Square Foot (ft2) Per Person is a calculation of the Net
     Administrative Area divided by the number of persons/offices.
     6.1.3.4. The Rentable Space is the prorated area of the overall building shared by an
     organization, excluding major vertical penetrations and exterior walls. This can be
     calculated by multiplying the relative percentage of a shared facility attributed to an
     organization by the gross area of the building.
262                                                           AFMAN32-1084 20 APRIL 2012


      6.1.3.5. Net Building Area includes Shared Special Purpose space and Shared Special
      Purpose space circulation.
      6.1.3.6. The Gross Building Area includes the entire building measured to the outside
      walls. To estimate Gross Building Area for administrative facilities, multiply the Net
      Administrative Area for all organizations by the programming multipliers below. The
      multipliers below include lobbies, restrooms, shared circulation, shared special purpose
      spaces, and other common shared building functions/spaces.
  6.1.4. Metrics. Net Administrative Area Metrics for Programming Administrative Spaces
  (without detailed justification):
      6.1.4.1. Use an average maximum of 120 ft2 per person (minimum 90 ft2 per person) for
      Net Administrative Area. NOTE: The minimum 90 ft2 per person space standard is
      typically used for relocations or renovation projects. The mix of office types (sizes A-H)
      may have to be revised to meet these limitations.
      6.1.4.2. For Administrative Support Space, use a maximum of 40 ft2 per person, and a
      minimum of 20 ft2 per person.
      6.1.4.3. A maximum Circulation multiplier up to 10% may be added to Net
      Administrative Area and Special Purpose (Organizational and Shared) space.
      6.1.4.4. A maximum Net-to-Gross multiplier of 25% should be added to Net Building
      Area to reach the gross building area.
      6.1.4.5. Conference Rooms. For organizations up to 49 personnel, provide one team
      room for up to 10 persons. For organizations with 50-99 personnel, provide a conference
      room for up to 25 persons and one team room for up to 10 persons. For organizations
      with 100-149 personnel, provide a conference room for up to 50 persons and two team
      rooms for up to 10 persons each. For organizations of over 150 personnel, provide an
      additional 10-person conference room capacity and one additional team room for up to 10
      persons for each additional 100 personnel in the organization. Additional
      conference/team space may be justified with projections that demonstrate the space will
      be occupied at least 50% of the time during duty hours on an annual basis.
  6.1.5. Multipliers. These are used by programmers to estimate the next level of space
  required.
      6.1.5.1. Circulation Multipliers are added to Special Purpose (Organizational and
      Shared) space to account for the space needed to circulate in, and around theses spaces.
      6.1.5.2. Net-to-Gross Multipliers are added to account for the shared space such as
      restrooms, mechanical, lobbies, vestibules, janitor, etc. It is intended to estimate and
      program the size of an entire building to the outside walls for facilities that are primarily
      administrative.
      6.1.5.3. Rentable Space may be estimated by adding 5% to the Net Organization Space,
      or the actual prorated areas to be shared by the organization, excluding major vertical
      penetrations and exterior walls. Rentable to Gross add 20%. Actual Rentable Space
      should be calculated based on design or actual building configuration.
AFMAN32-1084 20 APRIL 2012                                                                   263


   6.1.6. Programming Methods. There are three methods shown here with progressive levels
   of accuracy. The method used depends on the availability of programming information
   (Rank-Based Programming requires the most information). The three methods are: Rapid
   Programming Method (paragraph 6.1.6.1), Private/Open Office Method (paragraph
   6.1.6.2), and Rank-Based Programming Method (paragraph 6.1.6.3).
      6.1.6.1. Rapid Programming. Rapid programming is used for estimating space
      requirements quickly based on an estimated number of occupants and special purpose
      space. For primarily administrative facilities, use the Net-to-Gross Multipliers below to
      determine the gross building area. Note that some CATCODE facilities in the 610-series
      have a specific authorized gross building area.

 NOTES:

 1. These space limitations may be exceeded by 10% for relocation into un-renovated,
 existing space to accommodate the required spaces. If the resulting space allocation
 exceeds 110% of the available space or the Net Administrative Area per person or if the
 resulting space allocation is below 90 ft2 per person; renovate the existing space;
 reconfigure the existing space; or program a new project.

       6.1.6.3. Rank-Based Programming Method. The rank-based programming method is
       used for calculating space requirements based on the number of occupants, the detailed
       office-type (private or open) for each occupant, and special purpose space. This
       information is then used to establish the net administrative area. For facilities that are
       primarily administrative, use the Net-to-Gross Multiplier to determine the full building
       scope.

NOTES:

1. The Rank-base programming method is based on a Max Net Office Area Per Person, for a
building that is primarily an administrative facility housing two organizations with 175
personnel and 5,800 ft2 of Special Purpose Space (including 800 ft2 of Shared Special
Purpose Space).

  6.1.7. Tenant Administrative Offices. Air Force or non-Air Force tenant organizations or
  activities that require administrative office space on an Air Force installation are provided
  such space under AFI 25-201, Support Agreements Procedures, or other type agreements.
  The category code and nomenclature assigned to such space is determined as follows.
      6.1.7.1. Administrative-type facilities that are specifically developed or provided for an
      Air Force tenant activity are assigned the category code appropriate to the activity.
      6.1.7.2. When the Air Force tenant is not, or cannot be, provided with its own
      administrative-type facility, or the space required is too small to warrant the use of a
      separate category code, the space is provided under the category code of the wing or
      group headquarters that is responsible for operating the installation. The amount of tenant
      space thus provided should constitute a small percentage of the total space occupied
      under the wing or group headquarters category code. When an individual tenant requires
      a substantial amount of space, it may be desirable to ask AF/A7C to establish new or
      revised facility requirements. Such requests should be made only with respect to specific
      activities and organizations; codes for general activities, such as "Tenant Office‖ will not
      be approved. For unique headquarters, a request to revise Specified Headquarters
      (CATCODE 610287), may be in order.
AFMAN32-1084 20 APRIL 2012                                                                        275


       6.1.7.3. All non-Air Force tenants (except Air Force Plants) are provided administrative
       space under Non-Air Force Administrative Offices (CATCODE 610811), which applies
       to the space used for all types of administrative activities. Non-Air Force tenants include
       organizations such as Army, Navy, Marine, Coast Guard, DoD Agencies, other
       governmental agencies, private contractors, or other private organizations. Air Force
       Plant Administrative Offices are identified under CATCODE 610123.
6.2. Judge Advocate Facilities. Adequate facilities are needed for the proper administration
and supervision of the Air Force's legal needs. Typical unique special purpose spaces include
courthouse and legal libraries. See AF Legal Facilities Design Guide for facility design
guidance.

      6.2.1.1. Description. The ADC is an independent, tenant office servicing installations.
      The office is usually manned by one or two JAs and an administrative staff who provide
      private counsel to military members.
      6.2.1.2. Requirements Determination. In order to prevent perception of command
      influence, law centers and ADC offices shall not be combined unless designated by
      AF/JA. At locations designated by AF/JA, a circuit defense counsel office will be
      collocated with the ADC office and will require additional office and administrative
      space.
      6.2.1.3. Scope Determination. See Table 6.5.
      6.2.1.4. Dimensions. See Table 6.5.
      6.2.1.5. Design Considerations. Special Purpose Space required includes a waiting
      room/reception area, library, professional staff offices, administrative offices, and a

       6.2.2.1. Description. This facility contains the office of the installation staff JA and a
       courtroom.
       6.2.2.2. Requirements Determination. Space required includes offices for the staff JA,
       assistant staff JAs, a reserve JA, court reporters, and administrative personnel; library;
       waiting room; conference room for use by staff personnel; and a courtroom. At locations
       designated by AF/JA, a circuit prosecutor and/or trial judiciary office is collocated with
       the law center and requires additional office and administrative space.
       6.2.2.3. Scope Determination. See Table 6.5.
       6.2.2.4. Dimensions. The courtroom portion of the facility functionally consists of a
       courtroom, 111 m2 (1,200 ft2) minimum, the judge's chamber with a private toilet, jury
       deliberation room with a private toilet, two witness waiting rooms so that victims and
       government witnesses may be separated from accused and defense witnesses, and an
       administrative area.
       6.2.2.5. Design Considerations. The witness waiting area is located to preclude the
       possibility that witnesses will mix with the judge, court or board members, or spectators.
       See AF Legal Facilities Design Guide for facility design guidance.
6.3. Other Administrative Facilities.
   6.3.1. Family Housing Management Office
         FAC: 6100

         CATCODE: 610119

         OPR: AF/A7CH

         OCR: N/A

       6.3.1.1. Description. This facility accommodates the family housing management office
       of the BCE organization.
       6.3.1.2. Requirements Determination. The facility includes sufficient reception space
       to accommodate incoming personnel and their families, space for display of information
       on available community housing, toilet facilities for both sexes, and other special
       requirements. The customer service area should have sufficient space to provide a
       waiting room for children (e.g., tables, chairs, playpen, etc.). The Housing Officer
       (branch chief) and Referral Officer each require a private office (Type D) to conduct
       tenant-landlord counseling. Housing referral counselors and clerks should have semi-
       private areas to provide personalized customer service.
       6.3.1.3. Scope Determination. The given category code is used whether the office is
       located in the main office building of the Base Engineer Administration (CATCODE
 278                                                          AFMAN32-1084 20 APRIL 2012


       610127) or elsewhere. See the Air Force Housing Support Facilities Guide and UFC 4-
       610-01 for design and programming criteria.
       6.3.1.4. Dimensions. See Table 6.6.
       6.3.1.5. Design Considerations. The office is usually the first stop for arriving
       personnel and, therefore, a prominent location that is also convenient to other family
       service and military processing facilities is desirable. However, an existing office should
       not be considered for relocation to a better operating location unless other valid
       justification exists; for example, inadequacies in the office working space or structural
       condition.

      6.3.2.3. Scope Determination. Figure 6.3 is an example of the space requirements for a
      vehicle operations administration building. This is based on supporting a fleet of 1,500
      vehicles as broken out in the notes to the table. This is an example only; the size of the
      facility will depend upon fleet size and local mission and operational requirements. For
      additional guidance see paragraph 6.1.7 of this chapter.
      6.3.2.4. Dimensions. See Figure 6.3.
      6.3.2.5. Design Considerations. The facility must be collocated with the Vehicle
      Parking Operations area (CATCODE 852261) and Vehicle Maintenance Shop
      (CATCODE 214425) and situated so that the dispatcher has visual coverage of the
      parking area and the entry and exit point.

         6.3.6.5. Design Considerations. A separate and private office (for both Employee
         Relations functions and Labor Relations specialists) must be established so that
         confidentiality in these areas is not compromised.

       access. Security fencing at least 2 m (6.56 ft) in height, topped with at least three strands
       of barbed wire affixed to outriggers is required, with floor to ceiling fencing preferred.
       Depending on the type of cargo, some locations will require an outside Customs Holding
       Area which need not be covered but must be on hard-stand and fenced. Space
       requirements will vary from base to base depending on the mission and type of cargo.
       Each overseas command has different directives. Contact respective MAJCOM POC for
       current guidance.

       6.3.9.1. Description. The squadron orderly room space is normally located in the
       building that serves as the squadron's principal place of work and the space is identified
       under the category code of that facility. However, if a squadron elects to locate its
       squadron orderly room in a dormitory, the space used as the squadron orderly room
       should still be categorized under CATCODE 610241.
       6.3.9.2. Requirements Determination. Orderly room space should not be duplicated in
       other squadron-occupied facilities. Also, the use should be confined to office space and
       should not include any common use, service, and storage space properly coded as
       dormitory space or other type space.

      information and safety divisions. Office space is also provided for the deputy
      commanders for operations (or missions) and material and their various divisions such as
      intelligence, communications, operations plans, supply, and maintenance. See Table 6.2
      for office space authorizations for wing commanders, group commanders, and officials in
      equivalent positions.
      6.4.1.2. A wing or group headquarters with the additional responsibility of operating a
      base will usually include additional staff offices such as administrative services,
      accounting and finance, and the base procurement activity. The latter activity involves
      procurement and contracting of supplies, equipment, services, and construction for the
      entire base and for logistically-supported off-base units. It requires space for the
      Contracting Squadron Commander, Deputy for Business Operations (DBO), and contract
      specialists, as well as office support space such as conference and bid opening rooms.
      There are also other staff offices, many of which are normally housed in their own
      operational facilities, identified in the subparagraphs below. These spaces are not to be
      duplicated in the wing or group headquarters category code if already covered by
      allocations of space in their respective category code.

       6.4.9.1. Description. This is a ―collector‖ category code that accommodates
       miscellaneous major headquarters not otherwise identified. On bases where these
       headquarters are a tenant, the availability of the code reduces the amount of tenant space
       that might otherwise be assigned to the base operating wing or group headquarters. The
       category code should not be used for any headquarters not listed above. Requests for
       additions or deletions should be submitted to AFCEE/TDB with supporting information.
       6.4.9.2. Requirements Determination. See paragraph 6.4.
       6.4.9.3. Scope Determination. The facility accommodates the staff comprising the

         OCR: N/A

       6.5.1.1. Description. This facility is used to store, maintain, and service non-current
       official Air Force records with a retention period of eight years or less. It is also used to
AFMAN32-1084 20 APRIL 2012                                                                     293


     consolidate shipment of records with longer retention periods that are destined for a
     Federal Records Center.
     6.5.1.2. Requirements Determination. The facility is established under AFI 33-364,
     Records Disposition—Procedures and Responsibilities, and is a requirement of each
     installation, including its off-base activities, that have an annual accumulation of 2.83 m3
     (100 ft3) or more of official Air Force records with a retention period of two years or
     more.
     6.5.1.3. Scope Determination. Under 36 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Chapter
     XII, the size of the facility will not exceed 465 m 2 (5,000 ft2) of storage space and must
     contain less than 708 m3 (25,000 ft3) of records. (Larger facilities constitute "Agency
     Records Centers" and require approval from the Archivist of the United States through
     SAF/CIO A6P.) Warehouse storage space is preferred but must provide adequate heat,
     light, and ventilation for the comfort of servicing personnel. Staging areas used to store
     classified, For Official Use Only, Privacy Act information, or other types of protected
     information, require special safeguards.
     6.5.1.4. Dimensions. The required size of the facility is determined on an individual
     basis based on storing between 0.057 m3 and 0.085 m3 (2 ft3 and 3 ft3) of files per square
     meter (square foot) of floor area. Facilities smaller than 93 m2 (1,000 ft2) that are located
     within a base headquarters building can be reported under the building's category code.
     6.5.1.5. Design Considerations.
        6.5.1.5.1. The facility should normally be a single-story building, at or above grade
        level, of Type I-A to Type II-B construction as defined in UFC 3-600-01 and the
        International Building Code (IBC).
        6.5.1.5.2. A structural engineer shall establish a floor load limit. Post the load limit in
        a conspicuous place and do not exceed this limit.
        6.5.1.5.3. The records staging area should be equipped with an anti-intrusion alarm
        system, or equivalent, to protect against unlawful entry.
        6.5.1.5.4. Records areas shall be enclosed in four-hour fire resistant construction not
        exceeding 3,700 m2 (40,000 ft2) per fire area.
        6.5.1.5.5. Provide a complete facility automatic wet pipe sprinkler system.
        6.5.1.5.6. Storing hazardous cellulose nitrate film requires special facilities not
        covered by the above standards (see NFPA 40, Standard for the Storage and
        Handling of Cellulose Nitrate Film, and NFPA 232, Standard for the Protection of
        Records).
        6.5.1.5.7. Archival materials require a significantly higher level of protection than
        temporary records, such as environmentally controlled and filtered storage space. Fire
        safety criteria shall be the same as that for records centers, except that fire detection
        equipment shall be incorporated into the archival storage areas in accordance with
        NFPA 72, National Fire Alarm Code. Fire divisions in the archival storage areas may
        be reduced in size to reflect a management decision on the maximum amount of
        archives subject to damage or loss from fire.
294                                                           AFMAN32-1084 20 APRIL 2012


         6.5.1.5.8. For electronic and microfilm records storage, the relative humidity shall
         range from 20 to 40 percent with an optimum of 30 percent. Avoid rapid and wide-
         ranging temperature and humidity changes and do not exceed a five percent change in
         a 24-hour period. Temperature shall not exceed 21°C (70°F). Use a storage
         temperature of 2°C (35°F) or below for color films.
         6.5.1.5.9. Solid particles, which may abrade microfilms or react with the image,
         should be removed by mechanical filters from the air supplied to housings or rooms
         used for archival storage. Mechanical filters of dry media type having an arrestance,
         or cleaning efficiency, of not less than 85 percent (as determined by the stain test
         described in American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning
         Engineers [ASHRAE] Standard 52.2) are preferable.
         6.5.1.5.10. Gaseous impurities such as peroxides, oxidizing agents, sulfur dioxide,
         hydrogen sulfide, and others are to be removed by suitable washers or absorbers. Do
         not store archival microfilms in the same room with non-silver gelative films or in
         rooms with shared ventilation systems, as gasses emitted by the other films may
         damage or destroy the images in the silver archival films.

      6.5.2.1. Description. This facility accommodates the Air Logistics Center (ALC)
      commander and staff, including the directorate of plans and programs and all
      administrative functions of the following directorates: material management,
      maintenance, distribution, procurement, and production.
      6.5.2.2. Requirements Determination. Analyze facility population and provide
      justification for all spaces.
         6.5.2.2.1. Excluded are administrative and staff offices within the base operating
         headquarters (group, wing, and so forth) that are properly reported under other
         administrative category codes. Also excluded are servicing offices located in ALC
         operational facilities (production facilities, research, development, test facilities, and
         depot storage facilities).
         6.5.2.2.2. Servicing offices are defined as those offices occupied by personnel whose
         primary functions pertain solely to the operation being performed in the building.
         Functions include first echelon supervision, inspection, material control, work order
         processing, workload scheduling, certain phases of quality control, and similar duties.
         Servicing office space is reported under the basic facility being serviced.

     6.5.3.1. Description. The data processing installation (DPI) accommodates base-level
     automated data processing equipment (ADPE) and the related operational and support
     functions. The ADPE is used at base level for two programs:
         6.5.3.1.1. Standard Base Supply System (SBSS); and
         6.5.3.1.2. Base Level Data Automation Standardization Program (BLDASP), which
         supports base personnel, finance and accounting, civil engineering, aircraft
         maintenance, and other base activities.
     6.5.3.2. Requirements Determination. Analyze facility population and provide
     justification for all spaces.
     6.5.3.3. Scope Determination. See paragraph 6.1.1 of this chapter and below.
         6.5.3.3.1. An 808 m2 (8,700 ft2) DPI is needed at the following bases to support
         additional automated data processing programs: Andrews, Davis-Monthan (ACC
         mission), Eglin, Elmendorf, Nellis, Randolph, and Travis. Space requirements for
         parts of the center supporting SBSS and BLDASP operations are determined under
         guidance in preceding paragraphs. Facility requirements at two AFMC installations
         (separate from the six described above) consist of the basic requirement plus
         additional requirements to support the Aerospace Guidance and Metrology Center at
         Newark AFB and the Military Aircraft Storage and Disposition Center (MASDC) at
         Davis-Monthan AFB. Space requirements are determined by AFMC under the
         guidance provided for Logistical Systems Operations Centers. Base level programs
         supported by MASDC include only SBSS - not BLDASP.
         6.5.3.3.2. DPIs at selected ACC bases require an additional 28 m2 (300 ft2) in the
         field engineer office (normally 21 m2 [225 ft2 ]) to accommodate a "blue suit"
         maintenance function.
         6.5.3.3.3. DPIs serving the base supply complex require additional space for one of
         two possible configurations for remote processing stations: RPS-1, 17 m2 (185 ft2);
         RPS-2, 28 m2 (300 ft2) for the equipment plus 8 m2 (80 ft2) for storage.
         6.5.3.3.4. Information on component areas of the four standard DPIs appear in notes
         of Table 6.13. See paragraph 6.5.6 and Table 6.16 for space requirements generated
         by remote job entry terminal system (RJETS).
 296                                                                  AFMAN32-1084 20 APRIL 2012


           6.5.3.3.5. Facility requirements at designated AFMC installations (Wright-Patterson
           AFB and all Air Logistics Centers) consist of the basic requirement described above
           plus additional requirements associated with Logistical Systems Operations Centers.
              6.5.3.3.5.1. The center provides automated data processing support for most of
              AFMC's operating directorates and for interactions with systems managed by
              DoD, DLA, and other Air Force agencies. ADPE titles supported (besides SBSS
              and BLDASP) include Air Force Wholesale Logistics System, Maintenance
              Analysis and Structural Integrity Information Systems, Automatic Test
              Equipment and Numerical Control, and other titles.
       6.5.3.4. Dimensions. See Table 6.13 and 6.14.
       6.5.3.5. Design Considerations. Features of the DPI are a raised computer room floor,
       vapor barriers, special air-conditioning, telecommunications, electrical, security control
       systems, and, usually, an intrusion alarm system. The make/model and quantity of ADPE
       and size of the staff varies from center to center and, thus, project space requirements are
       individually determined by AFMC.

       6.5.4.1. Description. The Congressional Joint Committee on Printing authorizes these
       plants to provide direct printing, duplicating, and copier program management support to
       the Air Force mission. Each plant supports all base and tenant activity printing
       requirements.
       6.5.4.2. Requirements Determination. Analyze facility population and provide
       justification for all spaces.
       6.5.4.3. Scope Determination. This plant may support other DoD agencies, MWR or
       Non-reprographics management (in-house, commercial procurement, base copier
       program management, etc.) office space, a customer service area, and separate customer
       conference area. The production functions require space for a lithographic camera
       (including separate darkroom), negative stripping, plate processing, electrostatic plate
       making, offset press, electrostatic duplicator equipment, paper cutting, collating, folding,
       stitching, drilling, padding, hand assembling, and job distribution. The plant must have
       warehouse space for storing paper, inks, chemicals (developers, toners, replenishers,
       fixers, cleaners, etc.), and bindery supplies (switcher wire, padding compound, etc.). The
       printing plant may also include a micrographics service center which would include a
       work review/quality assurance area, camera room, and processing area.
       6.5.4.4. Dimensions. Space requirements depend upon the equipment type, size and
       configuration, volume of work, and type of reproduction required. Space required is
       determined by adding the equipment footprint and a normal working perimeter.
       6.5.4.5. Design Considerations.
           6.5.4.5.1. Some reproduction equipment generates excessive heat. Therefore, the
           plant must have adequate air conditioning, and paper must be stored in a
           dehumidified atmosphere. The plant must have OSHA-approved hazardous material
           storage cabinets as well as a staging area for hazardous waste awaiting removal.

      6.5.5.1. Description. The duplicating center provides direct duplicating, commercial
      procurement, and copier program management support to the Air Force mission. Each
      center supports all base and tenant activity duplicating requirements. It may, as agreed,
      support other DoD agencies, MWR, or Nonappropriated Fund activities. Each center
      requires reprographics management office space and a customer service area. The
      production functions require space for electrostatic plate making, offset press,
      electrostatic duplicator equipment, collating, stitching, drilling, hand assembling, and job
      distribution. Each plant requires space for storing paper, inks, developers, toners,
      cleaners, and bindery supplies.
      6.5.5.2. Requirements Determination. Analyze facility population and provide
      justification for all spaces.

       610717.
       6.5.5.4. Dimensions. See Table 6.15 for space requirements.
       6.5.5.5. Design Considerations. Some reproduction equipment generates excessive
       heat. Therefore, the center must have adequate air conditioning, and paper must be
       stored in a dehumidified atmosphere. The center must have OSHA-approved hazardous
       material storage cabinets as well as a staging area for hazardous waste awaiting removal.
   6.5.6. Remote Job Entry Terminal System (RJETS). RJETS are located at small active
   installations under the jurisdiction of the Air Force, the Air Force Reserve, and the Air
   National Guard. A RJETS system communicates with host Air Force RPS II at the computer
   support base. The RPS II is usually located in DPIs (CATCODE 610711). Space
   requirements for RJETS equipment and operations vary according to equipment
   configuration type. See Table 6.16.

       6.5.7.1. Description. This facility supports the Air Force Social Actions Program (AFI
       36-2706, Military Equal Opportunity (MEO) Program).
       6.5.7.2. Requirements Determination. A Social Actions facility is required for each
       installation. The facility should be in a central location with access and convenience to
AFMAN32-1084 20 APRIL 2012                                                                       301


       the Wing Staff offices, enlisted dormitory facilities, and other base offices that may refer
       personnel to the social actions office.
       6.5.7.3. Scope Determination.
             6.5.7.3.1. Provide lecture/seminar classrooms with room dividers used primarily for
             Equal Opportunity/Human Relations instruction. Other uses include training,
             committee meetings, councils, and associated forums involved in social action work.
             Rooms should be specifically designated to accommodate ―state of the art‖ audio-
             visual equipment modeled after base education classrooms. Ensure adequate space for
             use of audio-visual aids and experimental training exercises.
             6.5.7.3.2. For each authorized Social Actions position, provide a Type D office.
             Provide one Type C office for mediation. See Table 6.17.
       6.5.7.4. Dimensions. See Table 6.17.
       6.5.7.5. Design Considerations.
             6.5.7.5.1. Sound proofing is required between administrative offices and consultation
             areas.
             6.5.7.5.2. The facility requires special consideration to provide features that promote
             accomplishment of program objectives. This involves providing an environment that
             visitors perceive as non-threatening and one that encourages free access and
             expression. From a design standpoint, this means that counseling rooms must have
             floor-to-ceiling walls to ensure privacy. The interior design should create an
             environment that has a non-institutional character.

7.2. Category Group 72, Unaccompanied Personnel Housing (UPH).
   7.2.1. Overview. The Air Force Dormitory Master Plan (DMP) provides the Air Force with
   a comprehensive investment planning tool for future project programming of unaccompanied
   housing requirements across the Air Force. The Air Force DMP integrates facility condition
   assessments, functional adequacy analysis, scoring, anti-terrorism/force protection (AT/FP)
   analyses, and dormitory campus area development planning to produce a consolidated Air
   Force position for long-term dormitory investment. Dormitory construction projections are
   based on detailed phasing plans that take into account each of these factors in a weighted
   calculation. Master Plans are developed for each level in the Air Force corporate process:
   Installation, MAJCOM, and HQ USAF. The DMP includes a functional analysis that
   compares each facility to the new Air Force standards defined for each grade in the Air Force
   Unaccompanied Housing Design Guide. Consult the applicable DMP and Air Force
   Unaccompanied Housing Design Guide prior to project programming of unaccompanied
   housing requirement.
       7.2.1.1. Determining Requirements. As stated in paragraph 7.2.1, UPH requirements
       are determined by the DMP. See the Air Force Unaccompanied Housing Design Guide
       for further information and guidance.
       7.2.1.2. Definition of Unaccompanied Personnel. Unaccompanied Personnel either
       have no dependents or are geographically separated from all dependents. At locations
       where dependents are not authorized, all permanent party personnel are considered
       involuntarily separated and are included when calculating permanent party UPH
       requirements.
AFMAN32-1084 20 APRIL 2012                                                                   309


     7.2.1.3. Adequacy Standards. Lodging adequacy standards and assignments are
     provided in AFI 34-246, Air Force Lodging Program. Permanent party UPH assignment
     and adequacy standards are provided in AFI 32-6005, Unaccompanied Housing
     Management.
     7.2.1.4. Support Areas.
        7.2.1.4.1. Gross areas given in Table 7.1 are new construction and major renovation
        programming allowances (not existing facility space adequacy standards) for
        dormitories and Officers Quarters (OQ). They include support space such as lounges,
        vending machines, central office, laundry, linen supply, housekeeping equipment,
        personal item storage, and general-purpose storage.
        7.2.1.4.2. Squadron orderly rooms may be located in dormitories and reported as
        Orderly Room in Dormitory (CATCODE 610241). As indicated in the requirements
        criteria for this facility, space thus coded should be limited to office space and should
        not include any of the dormitory support space in 7.2.1.4.1.

      enlisted military personnel.
      7.2.3.2. Requirements Determination. Living space allowances and accommodations
      are established by OSD (Grades E-1 to E-4 line of Table 7.1). Consult the applicable
      DMP and Air Force Unaccompanied Housing Design Guide.
      7.2.3.3. Scope Determination. Program to provide sufficient dormitory rooms to house
      all unaccompanied personnel in grades E-1 to E-4 with fewer than three years in service
      (YOS) on base. Unaccompanied personnel in grades E-1 to E-4 (fewer than 3 YOS) are
      considered space required. Unaccompanied personnel in grades E-4 (more than 3 YOS)
      to E-9 are considered space available. One exception is noted below in paragraph
      7.2.3.3.1.
         7.2.3.3.1. Regardless of location, if the installation’s Housing Requirements and
         Market Analysis (HRMA) (or equivalent for Japan and Korea) reflects a deficit of
         adequate and affordable off-base housing to support any portion of unaccompanied E-
         4 (more than 3 YOS) through E-9 personnel at that installation, then the affected
         personnel may be considered space required. The HRMA must fully justify the lack
         of housing for E-4 (more than 3 YOS) through E-9 personnel. At these installations,
         program to house the affected grades (as identified in the HRMA) on base at the
         appropriate standard provided in Table 7.1. As a related NOTE: Air Force
         assignment standards (AFI 32-6005) stipulate that all space available personnel will
         only be authorized one room per person.
      7.2.3.4. Dimensions. See Table 7.1.
      7.2.3.5. Design Considerations. Design must include requirements, scope, and costs

         (standard and accessible guest rooms and suites) based on usage data.
         7.2.6.3. Scope Determination. The final determination of the project scope will be
         based on the results of an independent Project Validation Assessment (PVA) performed
         through Headquarters Air Force Services Agency. The PVA validates the site selection,
         determines the overall number of room types, support areas, guest services to be
         provided, and identifies any companion appropriated fund (APF) projects necessary to
         provide a complete and usable facility. All guest rooms will be single occupancy for all
         ranks (except under surge conditions) and shall include sleeping/living areas and private
         shower rooms. Refer to the Architectural Barriers Act guidelines to determine number of
         accessible rooms required. See AFSDG 4-724-01 to determine actual numbers of rooms.

      7.2.8.1. Description.
         7.2.8.1.1. Storage Area. The storage area includes refrigeration and storage space
         for semi-perishable subsistence and a receiving area. This is approximately 35 percent
         of the total facility (without a seating area).
         7.2.8.1.2. Kitchen Area. The kitchen area contains food preparation and support
         space, staff locker area, expendable storage, an office, and a janitor's closet. This is
         approximately 30 percent of the total facility (without a seating area).
         7.2.8.1.3. Serving Area. The serving area includes the counter area to serve walk-in
         customers and a window service area to accommodate drive-through customers. This
         is approximately 10 percent of the total facility (without a seating area).
         7.2.8.1.4. Customer Area. The customer area includes the patron waiting space,
         patron restrooms, and entry vestibules. This is approximately 15 percent of the total
         facility (without a seating area).
         7.2.8.1.5. Mechanical Room. The mechanical room is approximately 10 percent of
         the total facility (without a seating area).
         7.2.8.1.6. Dining Area. The dining area is optional. For space computations see
         paragraph 7.2.8.4.
      7.2.8.2. Requirements Determination. The various elements that comprise a fast food
      service facility and their sizing will be based on a study performed at the location being
      considered. The evaluation of need will be reviewed by the MAJCOM/A1 with an
      information copy to AFSVAFB, 10100 Reunion Place, Suite 502, San Antonio, TX
      78216-4138.
      7.2.8.3. Scope Determination. See paragraph 7.2.8.2.
      7.2.8.4. Dimensions. The industry standard for a nationally franchised fast food facility
      is approximately 260 m2 (2,800 ft2) gross area, excluding a seating area. If a seating area
AFMAN32-1084 20 APRIL 2012                                                                  315


     is required, then the seating capacity desired, times 1.4 m2 (15 ft2) per person, should be
     added to the basic facility.

     7.2.9.1. Description.
        7.2.9.1.1. Receipt and Issue Area. The receipt and issue area includes refrigeration
        and dry storage space used to store perishable and semi-perishable food prior to
        processing or use, a receiving platform including garbage and trash areas, and an
        issue point. The space does not accommodate food preparation.
        7.2.9.1.2. Kitchen Area. The kitchen area contains food preparation and support
        space including the kitchen proper, a dishwashing room, utensil wash, a refrigerated
        holding area for perishable food during processing, staff toilets and locker area,
        office, training room, storage room for expendables, and janitor's closet.
        7.2.9.1.3. Serving Area. The serving area includes space for the food serving line(s)
        and cashier(s).
        7.2.9.1.4. Dining Room Area. The dining room area includes patron seating, aisles,
        patron restrooms, a protected entrance way, office, and storage room. A patron
        seating plan that uses a combination of tables, chairs, and booths set in a mixture of
        2-, 4-, and 6-person dining configurations should be used. This mix will aid in the
        turnover rate and produce less dead seats. Dead seats occur in a floor plan that uses
        all of one type of seating (i.e., 4-person tables and most of the customers dine in
        groups of two, producing two dead seats at a four person table). This seating concept
        is unique to each location’s clientele.
     7.2.9.2. Requirements Determination. Space requirements vary according to required
     serving capacity which is determined under instructions in paragraph 7.2.9.3.
        7.2.9.2.1. The following categories of personnel may be included in calculating
        serving requirements: a) total personnel in subsistence in-kind status; b) personnel of
        foreign governments per agreement; c) the three-year historical average use of base
        dining facilities by enlisted personnel who receive Basic Allowance for Subsistence
        (BAS).
        7.2.9.2.2. Personnel in temporary duty status, assigned officers, and civilians, while
        authorized to use this dining facility and pay applicable surcharges, will not be
        included in this serving requirements calculation.

         7.2.9.2.3. Valid future increases in the number of authorized patrons (a, b, and c),
         based on mission changes, should be considered.
         7.2.9.2.4. Installations in designated isolated locations (per DFAS-DER 7010-1,
         General Accounting and Finance System at Base Level) may increase the gross area
         by 28 percent. Refer to DoD FMR, Volume 12, Chapter 19, Food Service Program,
         as an additional source for serving space requirements. Serving requirements are
         given in Table 7.3 , and space allowances are given in Tables 7.4 and 7.5.
      7.2.9.3. Scope Determination.
         7.2.9.3.1. Computing Dining Facility Requirements: A deficiency in dining
         capacity exists whenever the total serving capacity required for the installation
         exceeds the sum of the rated serving capacity of all existing dining facilities. The
         rated serving capacity of existing facilities is determined as follows:
            7.2.9.3.1.1. First determine the total area of the seating area; that is, the parts of
            the dining room reserved for tables and chairs, and divide by 1.4 m2 (15 ft2 ) per
            seat. This establishes the normal seat capacity.
            7.2.9.3.1.2. To determine the existing serving capacity, multiply the number of
            seats by the turnover rate of three customers per seat in a set meal period.
            7.2.9.3.1.3. This is the turnover for the meal period, regardless of the length of
            the period. (EXAMPLE: Assume a seating area of 139 m2 (1,500 ft2) and divide
            that by 1.4 m2 (15 ft2), as explained above. The result is 100. Next, multiply this
            number by the turnover rate of 3. The rated capacity is determined to be 300
            persons.)
            7.2.9.3.1.4. To compute the total serving requirement, multiply the total E-1 to E-
            9 base population by the appropriate factor in Table 7.3. Officers, E-5s to E-9s,
            and civilians should not be included in the serving requirement when planning,
            except in overseas or remote locations where support is authorized.
         7.2.9.3.2. The Air Force criteria are based on DoD space allowances. Assistance in
         developing dining facility designs based on Air Force criteria, including functional
         layouts of component areas, should be obtained from AFSVA.
         7.2.9.3.3. Projects for a given serving capacity that exceed Air Force space
         allowances for the same capacity must be approved by AF/A7CH.
      7.2.9.4. Dimensions. See Tables 7.3 and 7.4.
      7.2.9.5. Design Considerations. See UFC 4-722-01 and the USAF Dining Facilities
      Design Guide.

 NOTES:

 1. Serving Requirement. The maximum number of enlisted personnel to be served during a
 meal period should be determined by multiplying the normal unaccompanied Enlisted
 personnel housing capacity by the appropriate percentage(s) provided above. However,
 enlisted personnel on separate rations should not be included in the serving requirement
 when planning new dining facilities. Officers and civilians should not be included in the
 serving requirement when planning, retaining, or modernizing enlisted personnel dining
 facilities, except in overseas or remote locations where support is authorized.

 2. The percentage of 110 should be applied against the maximum facility capacity for
 administrative, confinement, and security personnel, to determine the serving requirement.

      7.2.10.1. Description. Programs for the construction of new officer dining facilities or
      major modification of existing dining facilities for officers' use will not be initiated
      without advance approval by MAJCOM/A1S. The possibility of serving officers in
      existing airmen dining facilities, without detriment to the service for airmen, should be
      explored.
      7.2.10.2. Requirements Determination. Space requirements are the same as for airmen
      dining facilities.
      7.2.10.3. Scope Determination. See paragraph 7.2.9.3.

            7.2.10.5.1. Dining Facility Storage Annex. Some existing facilities, designed under
            earlier space criteria, do not contain as much storage space as current criteria would
            provide. Where this condition significantly impairs operational efficiency, a storage
            annex may be provided, preferably adjacent to the dining facility. Annex space uses
            either CATCODE 722351 or 722356, as appropriate, with two units of measure,

          square meters (ft2) and persons (in this case, one person). The latter unit must be
          included to ensure the facility's acceptance in the computer system. The space
          provided in existing dining facilities and their existing or proposed storage annexes
          must not exceed the dining facilities serving capacity provided under paragraphs
          7.2.8, and 7.2.9. All proposed acquisitions of space or facilities to serve as storage
          annexes must be submitted to AFSVA for review. The preceding instructions do not
          apply to annexes to Dependent Boarding School Dining Facility (CATCODE
          730781), which are reported under CATCODE 730783.

     7.3.2.1. Description. Education Service Centers (ESC) provide facilities for the
     academic and professional development of officers, airmen, and DoD civilian employees
     in support of Air Force and national goals.
     7.3.2.2. Requirements Determination. Minimum allowance determinations should
     include, but not be limited to, the following considerations: installation military and
     civilian population, staff, number and size of on-base institutions, average annual
     enrollments, program variety, and overall use of ESCs. Allowance determinations should,
     in any event, ensure execution of quality programs.
     7.3.2.3. Scope Determination.
        7.3.2.3.1. ESCs will make use of joint-use facilities, of existing classrooms, or other
        suitable facilities on an installation, to the maximum extent practicable. Joint use of
        classrooms or other suitable facilities may be necessary to support the on-base
        education programs when space in the ESC is insufficient to satisfy recognized needs.
        7.3.2.3.2. All newly constructed Education Centers should provide office space for
        personnel managing base-level functions of the Education and Training Flight –
        education, Professional Military Education (PME), On-the-Job Training (OJT), base
        training, classification and training, formal training, civilian training, academic and

         military testing, labs for science and computers, distance learning delivery, and base
         library. Classrooms for these activities must also be included.
         7.3.2.3.3. Space allowances for overseas bases should be adjusted to reflect Status of
         Forces Agreements (SOFA) and the logistics requirements of education contracts.
         7.3.2.3.4. Additional space requirements must be submitted from MSSQ/CC/MSE
         and BCE through MAJCOM/A1/A7 to AF/A1PT/A7C.
      7.3.2.4. Dimensions. See Chapter 6 for classroom size allowances.
      7.3.2.5. Design Considerations. ESCs should be located in or very near major on-base
      enlisted housing areas. Provisions should be made to accommodate a Branch Library in
      accordance with the criteria for Base Library (CATCODE 740675) when justified by
      installation requirements, except when the library is included in same facility.

      7.3.3.1. Description. The Central Post Office requires space for a lobby, postal finance
      section, mail processing area, postal directory section, accountable mail area, registered
      mail section, postal administration, postal supply storage, and custodian of postal effects
      (COPE) areas. A separate space allocation shall also be made for non-postal
      administrative functions and for storage of non-postal supplies and equipment.
      7.3.3.2. Requirements Determination. Criteria, Applicability and Justification:
         7.3.3.2.1. See DoDD 5101.11, DoD Executive Agent for the Military Postal Service
         (MPS).
         7.3.3.2.2. Space criteria shown in Table 7.7 represent the basic central post office
         gross area and provide general guidance. Additional space may be provided if a
         central post office serves specialized functions, such as:
             7.3.3.2.2.1. Major and subordinate headquarters, commands, personnel centers,
             training centers, military service schools, hospitals, supply depots, or other high
             volume mailers;
             7.3.3.2.2.2. Activities generating a high volume of accountable mail that requires
             secure overnight storage;

        7.3.3.2.3. Special Features:
            7.3.3.2.3.1. Each postal facility shall have sufficient docking space defined as a
            docking platform or ramp providing adequate area for the maneuvering of two
            trucks at one time for postal facilities with a direct support mission and three
            trucks at one time for postal facilities with a general support mission. However,
            when docking space is not available, maximum utilization of conveyer systems
            shall be made. Loading docks shall have sufficient overhang of room to permit
            loading and off loading of mail without its being exposed to inclement weather.
            7.3.3.2.3.2. Each postal facility shall have toilet facilities or access to toilet
            facilities in the same building for both sexes. Both hot and cold water shall be
            provided.
            7.3.3.2.3.3. Intrusion Alarm Devices (IAD) shall be installed in postal facilities
            that are not operational on a 24-hour basis.
            7.3.3.2.3.4. Postal facilities shall have adequate parking space for customer
            parking and unit mail clerks' vehicles. Limited parking space may create traffic
            problems and mail processing delays.
            7.3.3.2.3.5. Postal facilities shall be equipped with open counters to afford a more
            pleasant and efficient working environment. The postal finance service counters
            shall be constructed in modules that have adequate space for postal equipment,
            expendable postal supplies, and separate, lockable cash drawers for USPS stamp
            funds and money order funds.
        7.3.3.2.4. Installation population is the unit of measure for CONUS/overseas direct
        support post offices. The number of personnel receiving general support is the unit of
        measure for overseas postal facilities with a general support mission (Air Mail
        Terminals, etc.).
     7.3.3.3. Scope Determination.
        7.3.3.3.1. Space allowances for central post offices are given in Table 7.7. Space for
        general support facilities shall be 1.9 m2 (20 ft2 ) net floor space for every 1,000
        personnel receiving general support. The space shall be allocated as follows:
            7.3.3.3.1.1. Mail Processing Section: 1.4 m2 (15 ft2) per 1,000 population: and
            7.3.3.3.1.2. Registry Section: 0.5 m2 (5 ft2) per 1,000 population.
        7.3.3.3.2. See Table 7.7 for space criteria for Military Postal Finance Units or
        Sections.
        7.3.3.3.3. Branch post offices, not exceeding 139 m2 (1,500 ft2) gross area, may be
        provided as required at large military installations to serve concentrations of
        personnel when service from the central post office is impractical.
     7.3.3.4. Dimensions. See Table 7.7 and 7.8.
     7.3.3.5. Design Considerations.
        7.3.3.5.1. Additional space shall be allocated for non-postal supplies and equipment.
        The space criteria for "postal supply" applies only to storage space for United States
326                                                      AFMAN32-1084 20 APRIL 2012


      Postal Service (USPS) supplies, which include expendable and non-expendable items
      required to be on hand at military post offices (MPO) for their operation.
      7.3.3.5.2. A separate space allocation shall be made for non-postal administrative
      functions. The space criteria for "postal administration" apply only to daily postal
      operations such as claims, complaints, and compiling reports.
      7.3.3.5.3. The space criteria for a COPE section shall be based on the total population
      served by all postal facilities operated under the COPEs supervision. Space allocation
      for a COPE section shall be deducted from the mail processing section of postal
      facilities serving a population of 2,500 or more.
      7.3.3.5.4. Postal Finance section or unit space allocations shall be based on the
      number of postal finance clerks required to meet the customer workload. Data
      included in space computations for a postal finance section or unit will apply to (a)
      customer service lobby, (b) postal finance, (c) mail holding area, and (d) postal
      administration.
      7.3.3.5.5. Postal Service Centers (PSC) may be combined with, or separate from, a
      central or branch post office. Space criteria for PSCs shall be based on a combination
      of population served and the number of receptacles installed (Table 7.7). When the
      PSC is combined with a central or branch post office, the additional authorized space
      shall be added to the gross area figures shown. At CONUS installations, the number
      of receptacles will not exceed the number of assigned PCS unmarried military,
      unaccompanied married military, and civilian personnel on TDY status, multiplied by
      a factor of 1.25. At overseas locations the number of assigned PCS military and
      civilian personnel shall be used, multiplied by a factor of 1.25. The above factors
      compensate for the vacancy period required before reassigning a receptacle.
      7.3.3.5.6. The registry section shall be enclosed in a separate room or wire mesh cage
      to provide security against unauthorized entry.
      7.3.3.5.7. Waiver         Process,       Coordination        and      Sources       of
      Information. Determinations of specific total requirements and space provisions for
      specialized functions, as listed in paragraphs 7.3.3.2 through 7.3.3.5.6 above, should
      be coordinated with the USPS Regional Postmaster General. Coordination should
      occur during the initial planning stage and annotated on the project DD Form 1391.
      7.3.3.5.8. Air Force Courier Station.
         7.3.3.5.8.1. The station supports operations of the Armed Forces Courier Service
         and is provided at locations designated by the service. Stations are generally
         located where large amounts of courier material and cryptographic supplies and
         equipment are received for movement to and from overseas, or where supplies
         and equipment are generated or stored. The facility contains an administrative
         area, a vault, and, where needed, a loading platform. Provide vault security
         features as required.
         7.3.3.5.8.2. The station is preferably located in Air Freight Terminal
         (CATCODE 141782). This consolidates interfacing functions, facilitates material
         handling, and reduces security hazards.
AFMAN32-1084 20 APRIL 2012                                                                    327


              7.3.3.5.8.3. Due to the limited number of stations required, a separate category
              code has not been established. Since the activity is associated with Air Force, the
              space is properly reported as Air Force Headquarters (CATCODE 610282). The
              vault is designated as administrative special purpose space.

      7.3.4.1. Description. Laundry and dry cleaning facilities.
      7.3.4.2. Requirements Determination. Air Force policy requires that necessary laundry
      and dry cleaning services be obtained from the most effective and economical source.
      Laundry and/or dry cleaning facilities will be equipped and operated only when a
      determination has been made by the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Manpower,
      Reserve Affairs, Installation and Environment (SAF/MI) that adequate commercial
      capabilities are not available at reasonable cost and within a reasonable distance, or that
      the services are not available from other DoD or government facilities. A reasonable
      distance is considered to be under 161 kilometers (100 miles), the maximum economical
      transportation distance to a servicing facility.
      7.3.4.3. Scope Determination. The size of the requested plant facility will be based on
      Table 7.9 and the average military population served (including average military
      population(s) of other DoD installations/bases receiving services from the plant facility),
      dependents of military members, retired military members and their dependents, average
      transient population (annual total divided by 12), DoD civilians and their dependents in
      overseas areas, and all other categories of customer population approved/authorized by
      competent authorities to use the plant facility.
      7.3.4.4. Dimensions. See Table 7.9.
      7.3.4.5. Design Considerations. Some existing laundry and dry cleaning facilities,
      designed under earlier space criteria, may not contain employee locker rooms and break
      rooms or as much storage space, maintenance room, and cash customer retail store space.
      Where these conditions significantly impair operational and customer service efficiency,
      adequate annexes or facility expansions may be provided.

          OCR: N/A

      7.3.6.1. Description. These facilities provide spaces for community worship, individual
      meditation, religious education, pastoral counseling, spiritual support, interpersonal
      relationships, religious guidance, and related functions.
      7.3.6.2. Requirements Determination. For additional guidance, refer to the USAF
      Religious Facility Design Guide.
          7.3.6.2.1. The number of chapels at an installation, as well as the size of each chapel,
          is based upon the population of the installation. This population figure includes
          military strength assigned to or residing at the installation, as well as family members
          and civilian personnel dependent upon the installation for religious support.
          Attendance trends and projected changes in the installation population and mission
          are relevant in determining the number and size of the chapels at an installation.
          7.3.6.2.2. Availability and location of government provided housing, traditional or
          anticipated, composition of the particular chapel communities, and the percentage of
332                                                           AFMAN32-1084 20 APRIL 2012


         the installation’s population residing in civilian communities (CONUS only), are
         variables to be considered in the chapel planning process.
         7.3.6.2.3. In addition to space for worship, Chapels normally include provisions for
         individual and group counseling, clergy-congregation relationships, sacramental rites
         and ceremonies, religious observances, and other activities normally associated with
         the Chaplain Corps. Religious facilities should be constructed with all appropriate
         safety and accessibility features required of Air Force facilities.
      7.3.6.3. Scope Determination. The USAF Religious Facility Design Guide provides
      guidelines to be used in conjunction with other command and installation requirements
      for determining spatial allowances for chapel facilities. Specific and unique chapel
      facility spatial requirements may be justified on the basis of local installation needs. See
      AFI 52-101 for additional guidance.
      7.3.6.4. Dimensions. Most chapels are constructed with a seating capacity of
      approximately 300, and normally it is not recommended that a chapel exceed 400 seats.
      Requirements for larger or smaller chapels may be established by validated local needs.
      Installations with a population of 500 or less are not normally authorized a free-standing
      chapel, although an area for worship, or the requirements of religious practices and needs,
      may be provided in a multipurpose facility with spaces for services, meditation, office(s),
      and storage.
      7.3.6.5. Design Considerations.
         7.3.6.5.1. Provide reasonable separation of meeting areas to enable simultaneous
         activities such as, the conduct of worship services while counseling, religious
         instruction, or meetings occur.
         7.3.6.5.2. Office space must be arranged to facilitate counseling and protect the
         clergy-parishioner relationship. Privileged communication requires both visual and
         acoustical confidentiality (see AFI 52-101 and UCMJ Rules of Evidence, Rule 503).
         7.3.6.5.3. Chapels should be designed and constructed by those with professional
         experience in providing aesthetics that are conducive to worship and meet the
         religious needs of multi-faith users.

     7.3.7.2. Requirements Determination. Religious education facilities include
     classrooms for all age groups, infant through adult, and other identified needs. Normally
     a kitchen, administrative offices, reception areas, restrooms, storage spaces (for kitchen,
     administrative, custodial and religious education materials; tables and chairs; and multi-
     media and sound equipment), and maintenance rooms are in the facilities. Facilities must
     include features that support users who are physically challenged.
     7.3.7.3. Scope Determination. The USAF Religious Facility Design Guide provides
     guidelines to be used in conjunction with other command and installation requirements
     for determining spatial allowances for religious education facilities. Specific and unique
     facility spatial requirements may be justified on the basis of local installation needs.
     7.3.7.4. Dimensions. The total area of religious education facilities is calculated in
     addition to (independent of) other chapel facilities, and is based upon the total installation
     population (military and civilian personnel and their family members).

   7.4.1. Overview.
       7.4.1.1. Use of Criteria. The criteria given in this chapter are established by the Air
       Force and have evolved from DoD criteria. They apply to appropriated and
       nonappropriated fund (NAF) projects. Additional guidance concerning NAF project
       requirements can be found in paragraph 7.4.1.9 and 7.4.1.10. Projects may involve the
       construction of new facilities or the conversion or enlargement of existing facilities of
       permanent, semi-permanent, or temporary construction. Improvement and enlargement of
       existing facilities solely to attain these standards is not authorized.
       7.4.1.2. Change in Use. When an existing building is changed to a recreational facility,
       the authorized space allowance stated in this chapter may be increased by not more than
AFMAN32-1084 20 APRIL 2012                                                                    347


     20 percent, when necessary, to effect economical and efficient use of the existing
     building.
     7.4.1.3. Space Allowances. Space allowances given in this chapter do not include the
     required mechanical equipment space.
     7.4.1.4. Community Center Enclosed Malls and Covered Walkways. When elements
     of a community shopping center, such as the exchange main retail store, exchange service
     outlets, commissary, credit union and bank, are combined in a common structure and
     connected by a covered mall, space occupied by the mall or space occupied by public
     toilets and janitor closets located off the malls will not be deducted from space
     allowances for the respective elements. Likewise, where such elements are in close
     proximity to each other and are connected by a covered walkway, space occupied by the
     covered walkway will not be deducted from space allowances for the respective
     elements. These described spaces are instead identified under Enclosed Mall
     (CATCODE 740111) and Covered Walkway (CATCODE 852287).
     7.4.1.5. Justifying Requirements. The requirements for exchange, welfare, or
     recreational facilities will be carefully determined, giving consideration to pertinent
     factors such as tenure of the installation, number of assigned military to be served,
     capabilities of existing facilities at nearby installations or in local communities, climatic
     conditions affecting the use of the proposed facilities, and the impact on morale.
     7.4.1.6. Population Basis. The population basis for determining facility and space
     requirements is expressed variously in this chapter according to individual facilities. The
     population basis "military strength" is specified in the overview in Chapter 1 of this
     Manual. Other terms, such as "total customer base", are as defined in the text or table
     related to the individual facility. In applying the foregoing terms to overseas installations
     (excluding those in Hawaii), civilian employees (United States and other than host
     country nationals) are counted as military members in the term "military strength", and
     the dependents of such employees are counted as military dependents in applicable
     criteria. A PVA should ultimately be the determining factor for programming facility and
     space requirements.
     7.4.1.7. Multi-Service Use. Consider use by multi-military services in the local area
     instead of only considering military personnel assigned to the installation.
     7.4.1.8. Use Restrictions. No welfare or recreational project will be approved which
     creates future requirements for military construction or real estate, either by diverting
     inventories or facilities intended for operational purposes, or by occupying sites in
     conflict with higher priority use under the installation master plan.
     7.4.1.9. Waivers and Exceptions. The criteria established in this chapter are considered
     ample, under normal circumstances, to provide adequate facilities. Where there is an
     evident need for greater allowances or for facilities not listed in this chapter, SAF/IEI
     must approve waivers or exceptions to the criteria. Procedures to be followed on NAF
     projects appear in AFI-32-1022, Planning and Programming Nonapproprated Fund
     Facility Construction Projects.
     7.4.1.10. NAF Project Requirements. The guidelines provided in this Manual are for
     preliminary programming purposes only. Actual scopes for NAF Services projects are

      7.4.3.1. Description. Although credit unions are private organizations not under the
      control of the DoD, a Federal credit union facility may be established on any military
      installation for the convenience of the installation personnel, military and civilian and
      their dependents, and other personnel as permitted in the approved by-laws of the credit
      union. Membership normally includes all assigned DoD personnel.
      7.4.3.2. Requirements Determination. Only one credit union is permitted on an Air
      Force base except where more than one credit union existed prior to May 1, 2000, or
      where a waiver has been granted IAW DoDD 1000.11, Financial Institutions on DoD
      Installations. Where more than one credit union already exists, each is entitled to the
      benefits defined in this regulation as if it were located on a separate base. A complete
      credit union facility includes reception and lobby space, teller space, interview space,
      operating (machine and/or record) space, record holding space, management office space,
      vault (fire and security) space, employee lounge space, and meeting rooms (conference
      room).
      7.4.3.3. Scope Determination. Credit union facilities are established under DoD FMR
      Volume 5, Chapter 34. When a credit union is authorized to construct its own building, at
      its own expense, on government-owned land, the space criteria limitations herein do not
      apply.
      7.4.3.4. Dimensions. Space requirements are determined for individual credit unions by
      the characteristics of their business operations. These characteristics are expressed under
      five categories in Table 7.13. Extrapolation should be used to determine the factor where
      the variable of a credit union exceeds any of the five categories. Table 7.14 should also
 350                                                            AFMAN32-1084 20 APRIL 2012


       be extrapolated when the total factors from Table 7.13 exceed the factors shown in this
       table. The total of all credit union facilities on an Air Force base will not exceed the space
       allowances specified in Table 7.14, as extrapolated, except that a ten percent increase is
       permitted to allow for future business expansion.

      7.4.4.1. Description. The A&FRC assists commanders in their responsibility for the
      readiness of all DoD personnel and their families through financial and family
      counseling/education, relocation information, and employment/transition assistance.
      7.4.4.2. Requirements Determination. Functional space requirements, shown in Table
      7.15, are for an example facility. Programmers should work with base and MAJCOM/A1
      and manpower representatives to determine specific functional requirements for the
      proposed A&FRC (i.e., some functions shown in the table below may not be required at
      all bases).
      7.4.4.3. Scope Determination. Increase of space requirements, above the minimum
      guidelines shown in Table 7.15, may be justified according to larger base populations,
      mission, and A&FRC requirements.

      Assistance, Personal Financial Management, Air Force Aid Society, Readiness
      NCO/NCOIC, Personal and Work Life, Survival Benefits Program (SBP), Casualty,
      School Liaison Officer, and Special Needs Advocacy need private offices because of
      confidential discussions/consultations with clients or work with confidential information.
      Some installations have combined Casualty Assistance Representative and Survivor
      Benefits Counselor functions; however, at installations where the functions are separate,
      separate offices are authorized. The Discovery Center (this is in lieu of a Computer Room
      listed in the UFC) provides intake, initial self-assessment as well as print and computer-
      based resources for customer use. A Discovery Center typically has computers, printers,
      scanners, and copier.

       7.4.10.1. Description. An Armed Forces aero club is a recreational flying activity
       approved under pertinent regulation that is located on or near a military installation and
       used by authorized personnel.
       7.4.10.2. Requirements Determination. The activity requires hangar space for aircraft
       maintenance and for aircraft storage during inclement weather. It also requires
       multipurpose space for administration, training, classrooms, operations, scheduling,
       safety meetings, and flight planning. Space allowances, based on the number of aircraft
       operated by the club, are given in Table 7.19.
       7.4.10.3. Scope Determination. Table 7.19 shows authorized scope only, not the scope
       that may be approved. The scope used for programming, budgeting and design must be
       based on need as documented by a professional, in-depth market survey. The scope is
       also influenced by the Services NAF construction prioritization system, which
       encourages economy in scope and composite facilities. The scope can be influenced by
       PVA studies. Because of higher utilization of overseas facilities, consider adding 5 to 10
       percent to the authorized scope for these facilities (including Alaska and Hawaii). DoD
       civilians assigned to overseas facilities are to be counted as active duty strength for
       facility sizing purposes (including Alaska and Hawaii). Contact MAJCOM Director of
       Services for current criteria and guidelines.
       7.4.10.4. Dimensions. See Table 7.19.
       7.4.10.5. Design Considerations. Design will be based on commercial standards for
       general aviation aircraft hangars.

 NOTES:

 1. Mechanical equipment room space as required should be added to the gross areas
 shown when determining a single gross area figure for each facility.

     7.4.11. Exchange Facilities. AFI 34-219 contains space allowances for all exchange and
     subordinate exchange facilities.
        7.4.11.1. Subordinate Exchange Facilities. Subordinate exchange facilities operated
        for the convenience of separate specialized activities and established as an integral part of
        these activities, such as snack facilities in bowling centers and operations building;
        outlets in air terminals; snack and retail facilities; service outlets for hospitals; barber
        shops in clubs; dining facilities in dependent schools, colleges and academic buildings;
        and snack facilities in theaters will be provided out of space allowances authorized for the
        separate specialized activities themselves.
        7.4.11.2. Military Strength in Overseas Commands. In computing the military
        strength figure for an overseas command, add the number of civilian employees (United
        States and other than host country nationals), excluding dependents, paid from
        appropriated or nonappropriated US dollar funds and afforded full exchange service
        privileges.
        7.4.11.3. Exchange Central Facilities. These facilities support exchange activities at a
        number of installations within a certain geographical area. The need for the facilities and
        space requirements will be determined by AAFES. The facilities may be located in
        buildings of temporary construction, relocatable buildings, or available semi-permanent
        or permanent structures.
        7.4.11.4. Shopping Centers. Major exchange facilities will be planned, where feasible,
        as elements of the installation's community shopping center. (See guidance in paragraph
362                                                          AFMAN32-1084 20 APRIL 2012


      7.4.1.4 on designation of space consisting of covered/enclosed malls and walkways
      integrated with shopping center elements.)
      7.4.11.5. Overseas Area Community Shopping Centers. An area community
      shopping center may be provided in overseas commands where a group of military
      installations are located within a geographical area with a radius of up to 40 kilometers
      (25 miles). The shopping center will preferably be located at one of the installations in
      the center of the area and will obviate the need for other comparable main exchange
      facilities at that installation. The main retail store at the area community shopping center
      will feature complete selections of merchandise, thus permitting the retail stores at the
      served installations to feature limited selections (items of necessity and general
      convenience).
      7.4.11.6. Base Package Stores. See Base Package Store (CATCODE 740269).
      7.4.11.7. Construction from Private Funds.
         7.4.11.7.1. Construction of exchange facilities may be accomplished from private
         funds by private individuals or commercial concerns subject to approval by the
         Secretary of the Air Force (SAF) where pertinent contracts specify that title thereto
         passes to the government and stipulate conditions and restrictions which will prevent
         any future conflict with military requirements and eliminate any future obligations
         against appropriated funds. The requirement for passage of title does not apply to
         portable or relocatable buildings.
         7.4.11.7.2. Air and water pollution control facilities will be provided.
      7.4.11.8. Relocatable Buildings. Relocatable buildings provided from AAFES
      nonappropriated funds for temporary exchange facilities will be operated and maintained
      entirely from AAFES nonappropriated funds. Title to relocatable buildings provided from
      AAFES funds will remain with AAFES.

     examples of these activities are automobile repair garages, toy lands, taxicab and bus
     service, flower shops, baggage check points, bookstores, furniture stores, medical
     services (optometrist, dental, pharmacy, etc.), and in overseas areas exclusively, steam
     bath facilities, new car sales points, and stock investment offices.
     7.4.21.2. Requirements Determination. Contact OPR for latest requirements and
     guidance. Facilities for exchange special sales and service outlets may be provided when
     the following conditions are met:
        7.4.21.2.1. When it has been firmly established that no appropriated funds will be
        expended for an AAFES project and that no future obligation of appropriated funds
        will be involved in the maintenance and operation of this facility. Utilities services

         will be provided in overseas areas without reimbursement. Exception to this provision
         requires prior approval from the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense, Installations and
         Environment. Reference AFI 32-1022, Table 3.3, and Attachment 2, for Cat C
         Revenue-generating activities that may qualify for some APF maintenance/repair
         work.
         7.4.21.2.2. Where the use of an existing building is involved, the space to be
         occupied is the minimum needed for efficient operations, and this space is surplus to
         all other than exchange and recreation facility needs of the same priority.
         7.4.21.2.3. Where the facility is to be provided through new construction from
         private funds and the provisions for the use of private funds have been complied with.
         7.4.21.2.4. Where the facility is to be provided through new construction from
         nonappropriated funds and the project has been fully authorized.
         7.4.21.2.5. Space occupied by special sales and service outlets will not be deducted
         from other space allowances provided by these criteria.
      7.4.21.3. Scope Determination. Outlet facilities may be provided for the basic services
      indicated below, normally as adjuncts of the main retail store, including beauty shops.
      When a service outlet is being installed in an existing building, the space allowances may
      be increased by 20 percent or 9.3 m2 (100 ft2), whichever is greater, if such increase is
      necessary to effect economical and efficient use of the existing building.

      7.4.22.1. Description. Temporary lodging facilities (TLF) required to provide short-
      term temporary housing. Refer to AFI 34-246 for assignment policies.
      7.4.22.2. Requirements Determination. TLFs are required when an official
      determination has been made that there is a continuing demand for such facilities and that
      the lack of such facilities will impose unacceptable hardships or inconvenience on their
      authorized users.
         7.4.22.2.1. These determinations and a determination as to the number of living units
         required are developed from an analysis of the following data concerning
         requirements, on-base facilities, and off-base facilities within 16 km (10 mi)
         commuting distance of the installations involved.
             7.4.22.2.1.1. A survey of private accommodations, including hotel/motel
             facilities, prevailing year-round rates (low, peak and average), and military

            discount rates which exist or could be obtained, and associated or related food
            service facilities.
            7.4.22.2.1.2. Information as to the feasibility of government leasing of suitable
            private facilities and the cost of leasing.
            7.4.22.2.1.3. The extent and nature of on-base accommodations (including
            messing facilities).
            7.4.22.2.1.4. A review of monthly PCS traveler data for the past three years to
            identify saturation points. Separate the numbers of accompanied versus
            unaccompanied personnel to determine total potential customers and which
            seasons/months the TLF use is highest and lowest. Where applicable, gather data
            on base hospital outpatients and civilian/military friends and relatives of patients
            in Air Force hospitals. This data is available from base lodging managers using
            the property management system.
            7.4.22.2.1.5. A statement as to why available or obtainable facilities cannot meet
            TLF requirements.
        7.4.22.2.2. It is Air Force policy that the number of living units to be provided at
        individual installations will not exceed the average number of guests or number of
        families in PCS status during the six most active months of the year. The number of
        units and two bedroom/one bedroom mix shall be provided by AFSVA/SVOL.
        Reference the Architectural Barriers Act guidelines to determine number of
        accessible rooms required.
     7.4.22.3. Scope Determination. The scope used for programming, budgeting, and
     design is limited by very specific financial considerations and by market need as
     documented by a professional, in-depth market survey. The scope is also influenced by
     the Services NAF construction prioritization system, which encourages economy in scope
     and composite facilities. The scope may also be influenced by PVAs, performed through
     Headquarters Air Force Services Agency.              Refer to AFI 34-205, Services
     Nonappropriated Fund Facility Projects, and contact MAJCOM Director of Services or
     AFSVA/SVXF for current PVA criteria and guidelines. Support space is additive to that
     in living units. It may include circulation space and space to support the administrative,
     lounge, recreational, mechanical, and service requirements of the facility. The space will
     vary depending on the number of living units, building configuration, and availability of
     adjacent facilities to support required functions. Where support space is provided in a
     detached structure or detached module, the facility is reported as Transient Lodging
     Support Building (CATCODE 740459).
     7.4.22.4. Dimensions. It is Air Force policy to provide kitchenettes in all TLFs included
     in programs for new construction. These space criteria do not apply to living units in
     facilities built or acquired prior to October 1, 1972 or to units in leased commercial
     facilities. Reference Table 7.20 and the United States Air Force Temporary Lodging
     Facilities Design Guide.
     7.4.22.5. Design Considerations. TLFs are designed to residential (i.e., Air Force
     family housing) construction standards and are to be architecturally compatible with the
     base environment. TLF units must include kitchen facilities and accommodate a family of
 370                                                        AFMAN32-1084 20 APRIL 2012


       five. Facilities may be acquired by new construction, conversion, change in use of
       existing buildings, or leasing privately owned facilities. Consult the United States Air
       Force Temporary Lodging Facilities Design Guide for further guidance.

NOTES:

1. Total customer base is defined as active duty officers, enlisted, or combined active duty
officers and enlisted, as appropriate, assigned to the military installation, plus 50 percent of
their spouses, plus 50 percent of the retired military supported by the facility. (Consideration
should be given to increasing the total customer base at installations with consistently large
numbers of TDY personnel or conducting PCS moves.) The total customer base shall be
verified by a validated PVA Study.

2. Mechanical equipment room space required should be added to the gross area shown when
determining a single gross area for each facility.

3. Provide in other facilities at 4.1 m2 (44 ft2) gross area per person.

 1. Total customer base is defined as active duty officers, enlisted, or combined active duty
 officers and enlisted, as appropriate, assigned to the military installation, plus 50 percent
 of their spouses, plus 50 percent of the retired military supported by the facility.
 (Consideration should be given to increasing the total customer base at installations with
 consistently large numbers of TDY personnel or conducting PCS moves.) The total
 customer base shall be verified by a validated PVA study.

 2. Mechanical equipment room space required should be added to the gross area shown
 when determining a single gross area for each facility.

 3. Provide in other facilities at 4.1 m2 (44 ft2) gross area per person.

 4. Example follows for scope computation for officers' club.

 a. Assume total customer base is 900.

 b. Use formula from appropriate line ―751-1000‖ in ―total customer base‖ column in
 table.

 Then authorized scope = 929 + .74 (P-750).

 c. Substitute total customer base, 900, for P. Then, authorized scope = 929 + .74 (900-
 750).

 d. Compute: Authorized Scope = 929 + .74 (150) = 1040 m2 (11,200 ft2)

       The scope is also influenced by the Services NAF construction prioritization system,
       which encourages economy in scope and composite facilities.
            7.4.28.3.1. The scope can be influenced by PVA studies. Contact MAJCOM Director
            of Services for current criteria and guidelines.
            7.4.28.3.2. For overseas installations, increase the total customer base by 25 percent
            before selecting the appropriate formula from the table. This will increase the
            authorized space to accommodate the higher facility use which is normal overseas.
            7.4.28.3.3. DoD civilians assigned to overseas facilities are to be counted as active
            duty strength for facility sizing purposes (including Alaska and Hawaii).

      7.4.30.1. Description. This facility provides space for private, semi-private, and/or
      dormitory-type sleeping quarters to support outdoor activities and recreation areas.
      Lodging may be provided at off-base recreation sites or at on-base recreation sites located
      in remote parts of large reservations.
      7.4.30.2. Requirements Determination. The number of authorized users will be
      determined for individual installations based on a survey and analysis which will
      establish the average number of users requiring lodging in the recreation area during an
      average week of the season. Determination of the number of users will take into account
      the limitations of the recreation area. Users will include active duty and retired military
      personnel and their dependents.
      7.4.30.3. Scope Determination. The scope used for programming, budgeting, and
      design is limited by very specific financial considerations and by market need as
      documented by a professional, in-depth market survey as mentioned in paragraph
      7.4.30.2. The scope is also influenced by the Services NAF construction prioritization
      system which encourages economy in scope and composite facilities.
          7.4.30.3.1. The scope can be influenced by PVA studies. Contact MAJCOM Director
          of Services for current criteria and guidelines.
          7.4.30.3.2. Air and water pollution control facilities will be provided.
      7.4.30.4. Dimensions. The total area of lodging per installation recreation area will not
      exceed that derived by multiplying the projected user requirement by a space allowance
      per person corresponding to that provided in barracks for enlisted grades E-2 through
      E-4.
      7.4.30.5. Design Considerations. Additional guidance concerning off-base recreation
      area acquisition and development is contained under Category Group 75 in this chapter.
          7.4.30.5.1. Because of higher utilization of overseas facilities, consider adding 5 to
          10 percent to the authorized scope for these facilities (including Alaska and Hawaii).
          7.4.30.5.2. DoD civilians assigned to overseas facilities are to be counted as active
          duty strength for facility sizing purposes (including Alaska and Hawaii).

      7.4.32.1. Description. This facility provides space for recreational activities having no
      space allowances at installations with military strengths of less than 500, where separate
      buildings are not authorized.
      7.4.32.2. Requirements Determination. Multipurpose recreation buildings should be
      considered for larger installations where appropriate for economies of construction,
      operation, energy savings, and user convenience. Large installations will require a study
      of actual installation needs to determine space requirements.
      7.4.32.3. Scope Determination. The size of the building will be determined from Table
      7.24. Space allotment for the various activities within the building may be determined

 NOTES:

 1. Total customer base is defined as all eligible personnel defined in AFI 34-262, Services
 Programs and Use Eligibility. (Consideration should be given to increasing the total
 customer base at installations with consistently large numbers of TDY personnel or
 conducting PCS moves.) The total customer base shall be verified by a validated PVA.

 2. For each increment increase of 700 total customer base above 12,600, two additional lanes
 totaling 232 m2 (2,500 ft2) gross area may be provided. Additional lanes should not be
 provided for any increase below a full increment and no additional lanes should be provided
 at military installations in the 48 contiguous states without a complete and full study of the
 needs and economic factors involved.

 3. DoD civilians assigned to overseas facilities are to be counted as active duty strength for
 facility sizing purposes (including Alaska and Hawaii).

 4. Mechanical equipment room space as required should be added to the gross areas shown
 when determining a single gross area for each facility.

 5. CONUS includes space for equipment and storage. For each increment of four lanes, an
 additional 185 m2 (2,000 ft2) gross area may be added for a game room for amusement
 games, billiards and pool, as well as food service, offices, and maintenance area.

 6. Overseas includes space for equipment and storage. For each increment of four lanes, an
 additional 232 m2 (2,500 ft2) gross area may be added for a game room for amusement
 games, billiards and pool, as well as food service, offices, and maintenance area.

 7. Table shows maximum authorized scope only, not the scope that may be approved. The
 scope used for programming, budgeting, and design is limited by very specific financial
 considerations and by market need as documented by a professional, in-depth market survey.
 The scope is also influenced by the Services NAF construction prioritization system which
 encourages economy in scope and composite facilities.

 8. Because of higher utilization of overseas facilities, consider adding 5 to 10 percent to
 authorized scope for these facilities (including Alaska and Hawaii).

      7.4.34.1. Description. Outdoor Recreation and Equipment Center supports a program
      that may, contingent upon the size of an installation and its geographical location, require
      multiple facilities under this category code (i.e., an Outdoor Recreation Center,

       Equipment Check-out) and possibly a marina support component. However, in the
       interest of operational efficiency and construction economy, components are collocated
       whenever possible. The facility or facilities may be located on-base or at off-base
       recreation areas.
       7.4.34.2. Requirements Determination. At some locations, in the interest of
       operational efficiency, a marina operation may be supported out of the Outdoor
       Recreation and Equipment Center. For bases having waterfront areas with boating
       activities (including space for equipment storage, checkout and repair), this may be
       incorporated into the Outdoor Recreation and Equipment Center or developed as a free
       standing facility. (Marina operation must also provide for water pollution control and
       small boat pump-out capability.)

 NOTES:

 1. The population used to calculate allowable area is as follows and shall be verified by a
 valid PVA study:
388                                                           AFMAN32-1084 20 APRIL 2012


  a. 100 percent of Assigned Military Personnel – includes Air Force and other U.S.
  Military personnel, full-time Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard assigned to the
  installation. Include the number of military personnel from interservice support
  agreements with other U.S. and foreign/NATO services.

  b. 50 percent of Family Members ages 13 years or older – includes all spouses, and
  children 13 years or older for those included in the Assigned Military personnel
  category. If the actual number is not available from the installation, the number may be
  calculated from the total family member population.

  c. 100 percent DoD civilians assigned overseas – this category applies only if the base is
  overseas or in Alaska or Hawaii. Include DoD, NAF, AAFES, and DoDEA personnel.
  Do not include personnel as DoD civilians if they are counted as Family Members.

  d. 100 percent of PCS members, students, or members TDY – when the installation
  regularly serves a substantial number (100 or more) of military transients greater than 30
  consecutive days, the average daily strength, based on a firm projection of the total
  yearly load of such transients, may be added to the base population.

  e. 100 percent of Host Nation Military or NATO Alliances – at PACAF and USAFE
  installations, assigned military members of host nations or NATO alliances may be
  added to the base population.

2. A minimum of two racquetball courts are authorized. Additional courts constructed as
additives to fitness centers will count against the total space authorization.

3. For populations less than 250, combine with community activity center, CATCODE
740669.

4. Space for mechanical equipment, rest rooms, and circulation has been added by a factor
of 35 percent.

5. Shows maximum authorized scope only, not the scope that may be approved.

6. Due to higher utilization of overseas facilities, consider adding up to 10 percent to
authorized scope for these facilities (including Alaska and Hawaii).

7. For populations over 7,000, the installation should determine whether it is more cost
effective and manpower-efficient to build one large complex or multiple smaller sized
facilities.

  7.4.36. Base Library.
        FAC: 7416

        CATCODE: 740675

        OPR: AF/A1S

        OCR: AFSVA, MAJCOM/A1S

     7.4.36.1. Description. This facility provides space for use, housing, and issuance of
     print, non-print, telecommunications, and electronic materials at each base for the support
     of the primary mission of the base, professional military education, voluntary education,
     lifelong learning, and for unstructured leisure use.
     7.4.36.2. Requirements Determination. The base library supports a program that may,
     contingent upon the base mission, encompass or require three separate facilities under
     this category code (i.e., a main library, a branch library, and a library service center).
     Include space and infrastructure to support a fully equipped internet center for customer
     use. Include adequate storage for removable media and computer peripherals. Libraries
     do not house fast food establishments other than small coffee cafes operated by AAFES,
     a NAF concessionaire, or Services Clubs.
     7.4.36.3. Scope Determination. Space allowances are given in Table 7.29 for Main
     Libraries and Table 7.30 for Library Service Centers. These allowances may be increased
     by ten percent when the facility is designated a command reference center. AFI 34-270,
     Air Force Library and Information System (AFLIS), establishes policies and procedures
     for the organization, administration, and operation of Air Force libraries. Space
     allowances for branch libraries, where justified, are specific, and a table is not required.
     Refer to UFC 4-740-20, Libraries, for space requirements in library functional areas.
        7.4.36.3.1. Branch Libraries. When justified by the requirements of a particular
        installation, branch libraries, not exceeding 372 m2 (4,000 ft2) in gross area, may be
        provided in support of an education center or for each 3,000 increment of military
        strength over 10,000. Where troop concentrations permit consolidation, the gross area
        authorized for each 3,000 increment of military strength over 10,000 may be
        combined into one branch library. These space allocations are in addition to the space
        criteria for main libraries.
        7.4.36.3.2. Library Service Centers. When justified by the requirements of a
        particular area or command, a library service center may be authorized. Building size
        is to be determined by the maximum quantity of library materials to be on hand at any
        one time, i.e., the number of books or other items held in reserve plus the number of
        items on hand to be processed for distribution. Space allowances are shown in Table
        7.29.
     7.4.36.4. Dimensions. See Tables 7.29 and 7.30.
     7.4.36.5. Design Considerations. See UFC 4-740-20.

 NOTES:

 1. Total customer base consists of military strength plus 40 percent of dependent
 population.

 2. DoD civilians assigned to overseas facilities are to be counted as active duty strength for
 facility sizing purposes (including Alaska and Hawaii).

 3. Because of higher utilization of overseas facilities, consider adding 5 to 10 percent to
 authorized scope for these facilities (including Alaska and Hawaii).

 4. Mechanical equipment room space as required should be added to the gross areas shown
 when determining a single gross area for each facility.

     7.4.39.1. Description. This facility requirement is generated by programs and activities
     associated with nonappropriated fund entities established under AFJI 34-122, Civilian
     Nonappropriated Funds and Morale, Welfare, and Recreation Activities, established to
     operate revenue producing activities primarily for base civilian employees. A portion of
     the profit from the restaurant fund revenue producing activities is used to provide a
     source of income for the installation civilian welfare fund.
        7.4.39.1.1. AFJI 34-122 provides guidance on acceptable programs and facility
        descriptions. There are no standard programs except that certain activities are
        prohibited by AFJI 34-122. For example, civilian nonappropriated funds may not be
        used to finance approved facilities and services normally provided from appropriated
        funds. Also excluded from fund support are the special interest clubs or groups
        established under AFI 34-223 Private Organizations (PO) Program, to serve
        purposes other than those for which civilian nonappropriated funds are primarily
        intended.
     7.4.39.2. Requirements Determination. Facility requirements to support approved
     activities are developed by the base restaurant fund council. The major commander
     approves facility requirements for base restaurant funds.
     7.4.39.3. Scope Determination. Contact OPR for latest requirements and guidance.
     7.4.39.4. Dimensions. Refer to Table 7.32.
     7.4.39.5. Design Considerations. At overseas installations (excluding Hawaii, Alaska,
     and the Panama Canal Zone), approved activities will exclude any activity normally
     supported by joint-use military/civilian employee facilities. Most base restaurant fund

     7.4.41.1. Description. This facility identifies space occupied by a restaurant or food
     court or by restaurant-operated snack bars, vending machines, or other food service
     related activity.
     7.4.41.2. Requirements Determination. Space allowances for restaurants and food
     courts are established by DoD. (To economize on the use of category codes, CATCODE
     740735 is also used to identify existing space at overseas bases occupied by foreign
     national civilian canteens. In inventory records, this usage is normally indicated by the
     presence of an outgrant symbol.)
     7.4.41.3. Scope Requirements. The total scope of base restaurant operations, including
     satellite operations, should be a minimum of 4,646 m2 (50,000 ft2) for bases with a
     civilian population of at least 10,000. The actual scope will be determined by a PVA
     conducted by the MAJCOM.

     7.4.42.1. Description. The theater has three basic functions. It is used to show moving
     pictures and to present live stage productions. It is also used as an auditorium where
     commanders can assemble their personnel for group instruction. Such activities as
     graduation exercises, organizational meetings, character guidance lectures, troop
     information programs, officer and airmen calls, and general meetings of clubs are held
     regularly in this facility.
     7.4.42.2. Requirements Determination. Space allowances for theaters are given in
     Table 7.33. All theaters include a stage.
     7.4.42.3. Scope Determination. Designs have been developed by AAFES for a snack
     stand to be located in the Base Theater. Drawings for site adaptation can be obtained
     from AAFES.

       7.4.42.4. Dimensions. See Table 7.33.
       7.4.42.5. Design Considerations. Seating capacity is influenced by the number of
       military families living on or near base; the distance to, and availability of, adequate off-
       base recreational facilities; and the base military strength.

          OCR: AFSVA, MAJCOM/A1S

      7.4.44.1. Description. Child Development Centers may be established to provide child
      care for children from the ages of six weeks through five years of age for full-day, part-
      day, and hourly service.
      7.4.44.2. Requirements Determination. Development of the facility space program
      should take into consideration the demand for care for each age group to determine the
      number and distribution of care room types, the anticipated proportion of full- versus
      part-day care, and the existing child care facilities on base and their adequacies or
      inadequacies relative to current and future needs. For planning criteria see UFC 4-740-14,
      Design: Child Development Centers. Any criteria not specifically addressed in the Air
      Force guidance is established by the reference manual, National Health and Safety
      Performance Standards: Guidelines for Out-of-Home Child Care Programs, by the
      American Public Health Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics.
      7.4.44.3. Scope Determination. Estimate the number of children that can be served in
      child development center annexes. Subtract this number from the projected need. If child
      care services comparable in quality, cost, and service to those in the child development
      center are available in the civilian community or through family care homes on base,
      these should also be considered in projecting unmet needs. Other functions to be

       accommodated include administrative support oversight of family day care, information
       and referral services, and special needs care.
       7.4.44.4. Dimensions.
          7.4.44.4.1. Sizing Parameters. The minimum size should accommodate no fewer
          than 48 children. Space allowance per child shall be based on an average of 7.9 m2
          (85 ft2), not including mechanical or administrative space, including space for the
          family day care administrative office and lending program, which should be added to
          the gross total for the facility. Limit facility size to no more than 305 children per site.
          See UFC 4-740-14.
          7.4.44.4.2. Experience Data. The capacity of the facility should be based on
          historical data experience when available. Waiting lists should be reviewed and
          updated to project unmet need. Consider expected changes in mission. Where no
          experience data is available, use the DoD formula for projecting need in AFI 34-248,
          Child Development Centers, or consult AF/A1S for need data.

       designed to obtain maximum voluntary participation in the most commonly recognized
       fitness and sports programs. In the interest of good play, the fields and courts must be
       regulation size and design.
       7.5.1.2. The criteria given in this chapter are established by the DoD and apply to both
       appropriated and nonappropriated fund projects. They are considered ample to satisfy the
       requirements of typical fitness and sports programs. Where there is an evident need for
       greater allowances or for facilities that are not listed in this chapter, guidance given in

 NOTES:

 1. DoD civilians assigned to overseas facilities are to be counted as active duty strength for
 facility sizing purposes (including Alaska and Hawaii).

 2. The scope can be influenced by PVA studies. Contact MAJCOM Director of Services
 for current criteria and guidelines.

 4. For every 1,000 personnel over 10,000, increase field and court allowance in accordance
 with a valid PVA.

 5. The population used to calculate allowable area is as follows and shall be verified by a
 valid PVA.

   a. 100 percent of Assigned Military Personnel – includes Air Force and other U.S.
   military personnel, full-time Air Force Reserve, and Air National Guard assigned to the
   installation. Include the number of military personnel from interservice support
   agreements with other U.S. and foreign/NATO services.

   b. 50 percent of Family Members ages 13 years or older – includes all spouses, and
   children 13 years or older for those included in the Assigned Military personnel
   category. If the actual number is not available from the installation, the number may be
   calculated from the total family member population.

   c. 100 percent DoD civilians assigned overseas – this category applies only if the base is
   overseas or in Alaska or Hawaii. Include DoD, NAF, AAFES, and DoDEA personnel.
   Do not include personnel as DoD civilians if they are counted as Family Members.

   d. 100 percent of PCS members, students, or members TDY – when the installation
   regularly serves a substantial number (100 or more) of military transients greater than 30
   consecutive days, the average daily strength, based on a firm projection of the total
   yearly load of such transients, may be added to the base population.

   e. 100 percent of Host Nation Military or NATO Alliances – For PACAF and USAFE
   installations, assigned military members of host nations or NATO alliances may be
   added to the base population.

  7.5.25. Off-Base Recreation Areas.
     7.5.25.1. Establishing Requirement. Prior to establishing any new off-base recreation
     areas, existing on-base outdoor recreation resources must be reviewed to ensure they are
     utilized to their full potential. If this review indicates that on-base resources are not
     adequate or available, and private or public facilities cannot meet the requirement, the
     installation should examine possible joint operation agreements with other military
     installations in the area that have existing on-/off-base outdoor recreation areas. If this
     attempt proves negative, the installation may initiate action to develop an off-base
     recreation area within the following guidelines:
        7.5.25.1.1. Installations will determine if long term, annually renewable leases (up to
        50 years) at nominal cost could be consummated with a public agency (federal, state,
        city, county, etc.) within any of the 50 states.
        7.5.25.1.2. If public agency leases are not available, private leases may be
        considered. These should be considered only if costs are not excessive (CONUS,
        Hawaii and Alaska only). Fee acquisition of land for outdoor recreation areas is not
        authorized without written approval of SAF/MIIR and AFSVA/SVP.
        7.5.25.1.3. Permanent construction of off-base sites will be held to an absolute
        minimum. Portable facilities will be utilized to the maximum extent feasible.
        7.5.25.1.4. Requests for establishment of off-base recreation sites must be approved
        by AFSVA/SVP. Acquisition of real property for outdoor recreation will be IAW AFI
        32-9001. Facility requirements at off-base sites must be documented in the base
        Recreation Program Planning folder prepared IAW AFI 34-101, Volume I.
     7.5.25.2. Scope Determination. The scope used for programming, budgeting, and
     design is limited by very specific financial considerations and by market need as
     documented by a professional, in depth comprehensive market research and analysis. The
     scope is also influenced by the Services NAF construction prioritization system, which
     encourages economy in scope and composite facilities. The scope may also be influenced
     by PVA studies. Contact MAJCOM Director of Services for current criteria and
     guidelines.
     7.5.25.3. Facility Allowances. Two types of facilities may be provided at off-base
     recreation areas, Lodging and Support Facilities.
        7.5.25.3.1. Lodging Facilities. See criteria under CATCODE 740666.
        7.5.25.3.2. Support Facilities. This includes any recreational structures that are
        needed to ensure safe and efficient use of a site's recreational capabilities. Standard
        facilities, such as Recreation Pavilions (CATCODE 750371), should be identified
        under the appropriate code, and the total scope (on-base and off-base) will not exceed
        the allowances in this Manual. Other support facilities should be identified under

         streets.
            8.5.3.1.1.1. Open areas are areas within the site limits of the base, but outside its
            built-up areas, designed for training, maneuver, ammunition storage, bulk fuel
            storage, or other incidental purposes.
            8.5.3.1.1.2. Built-up areas are within the site limits of a base and contain
438                                                         AFMAN32-1084 20 APRIL 2012


             buildings, reasonably spaced and arranged for administration, housing,
             warehousing, and storage plant or depot purposes. Street intersections usually
             occur at intervals of 400 meters (1/4 mile) or less.
         8.5.3.1.2. Roads and streets are categorized as primary (P), secondary (S), tertiary
         (T), and patrol roads (PR).
             8.5.3.1.2.1. Primary (P). Base roads and streets serving as main distributing
             arteries for all traffic originating outside and within a base are designated
             Primary. They provide access to, through, and between various functional areas.
             They are planned and designed to accommodate large volumes of traffic
             composed of all types of vehicles required to operate regularly within the base for
             the anticipated life of the highway.
             8.5.3.1.2.2. Secondary (S). Base roads and streets supplementing the primary
             system by providing access to, between, and within various functional areas are
             designated Secondary. They are usually planned and designed to accommodate a
             reasonable volume of comparatively light weight vehicles, and an occasional
             passage of the maximum size vehicle expected to operate regularly on base.
             8.5.3.1.2.3. Tertiary (T). Roads and streets providing access from other roads
             and streets to individual units or facilities of a functional area are designated
             Tertiary. They are planned and designed according to traffic anticipated at the
             individual facility they serve.
             8.5.3.1.2.4. Patrol Road (PR). Roads planned and designed for use in
             surveillance or in patrolling areas for security purposes of light traffic.
      8.5.3.2. Requirements Determination.
         8.5.3.2.1. For planning and design purposes, roads and streets are divided into classes
         depending on topography, land use, speed, volume, and composition of traffic. Class
         A roads and streets are multi-lane (four or more lanes) and may be divided or
         undivided. Class B, C, D, and E roads are two-lane. There is seldom any requirement
         for Class A roads and streets on Air Force bases. See UFCs 3-250-01FA and 3-250-
         18FA.
         8.5.3.2.2. For programming purposes, roads and streets shall be shown by category
         (P, S, T, or PR) followed by the class (A, B, C, D, E, or F).
      8.5.3.3. Scope Determination. Volume and composition of traffic determines the
      geometric requirement for roads and streets. Wheel load, tire pressure, wheel
      configuration, and frequency of operation determine structural requirements. Type,
      volume, character, frequency, and composition of traffic are related to size, type, and
      mission of the base.
      8.5.3.4. Dimensions. See UFCs 3-250-01FA and 3-250-18FA.
      8.5.3.5. Design Considerations. See UFCs 3-250-01FA and 3-250-18FA.

        OPR: AFCESA/CEO

        OCR: AF/A4LE

     8.5.4.1. Description. This facility provides parking space for organizational vehicles at
     two types of locations: The main pool, normally adjacent to Vehicle Operations
     Administration (CATCODE 610121), and authorized sub-pools at the operating site or
     adjacent to the operating location of designated activities whose function requires 24 hour
     access to a substantial number of their assigned vehicles. Authorization to establish a sub-
     pool must be obtained from the transportation office. (The term sub-pool does not apply
     to any parking space identified by other category codes, space reserved for a few
     organizational vehicles in non-organizational parking areas [see CATCODE 852262],
     on-street parking spaces, or in an activity's storage yard).
     8.5.4.2. Requirements Determination. Typical organizations requiring sub-pools are
     CE, hospital, communications, security forces, aircraft maintenance, and vehicles exempt
     from pooling by DoD or Air Force. Vehicle operators use pool and sub-pool space to
     perform daily and weekly maintenance on their equipment.
        8.5.4.2.1. Pools and sub-pools require a paved or stabilized surface. The vehicle
        operations central pool requires floodlighting, a security fence at least 1.8 m (6 ft)
        high, and one or more controlled paved entrances. These features are provided at sub-
        pools only when the operation presents a special need for safeguarding and night
        lighting.
        8.5.4.2.2. One of the major sub-pools is operated by CE. The facility is usually a part
        of the CE complex and usually adjoins the Base Civil Engineer Open Storage,
        (CATCODE 452255) and the Base Engineer Pavement and Grounds Facility
        (CATCODE 219943). Due to the type of vehicles parked in this sub-pool, facilities
        for washing, consisting of washracks and steam cleaning equipment, will be required.
        Provide one open washrack space for each 25 assigned vehicles.
     8.5.4.3. Scope Determination. Determine the quantity required at the main pool and at
     individual sub-pools with the following steps.
        8.5.4.3.1. Using the base Vehicle Authorization List, identify all vehicles for which
        the Base Transportation Officer is responsible.
        8.5.4.3.2. Subtract all vehicles that are regularly parked at open locations other than
        the pools and sub-pools described above. Also subtract those regularly parked (or to
        be parked) in buildings and sheds such as Base Engineer Pavements and Grounds
        Facility (CATCODE 219943), Vehicle Operations Heated Parking (CATCODE
        214426), Vehicle Operations Parking Shed (CATCODE 214428), Fire Station
        (CATCODE 730142), and Ambulance Shelter (CATCODE 510264).

           8.5.4.3.3. Among the remaining vehicles, identify those that will be assigned to the
           main pool and each sub-pool. Then, refer to Table 8.1 to obtain the required amount
           of vehicle parking space.
           8.5.4.3.4. Refer to CATCODE 123335 if a vehicle fueling station is to be collocated
           with the main pool or sub-pools.
       8.5.4.4. Dimensions. Space requirements are given in Table 8.1.
       8.5.4.5. Design Considerations. See UFCs 3-250-01FA and 3-250-18FA. Facility
       design will include, as an integral component, provisions to preclude discharge of
       pollutants to the surrounding atmosphere, ground, or waters. Consult AFI 32-7041 for
       additional guidance on wastewater and storm water collection, treatment and disposal
       compliance.

       8.5.5.1. Description. It is the policy of the DoD to provide off-street parking at military
       installations instead of building wider streets that would accommodate on-street parking.
       Where facilities are located near each other, parking areas should be combined and
       reduced to the extent consistent with normal operations.
AFMAN32-1084 20 APRIL 2012                                                                       441


      8.5.5.2. Requirements Determination. Authorized parking spaces for selected facilities
      are listed in Table 8.2. Parking spaces for facilities not listed shall be based upon a
      special traffic analysis at the installation, taking into account the availability of public or
      government furnished transportation and group car riding. Parking spaces for listed
      facilities, whether existing or programmed, may be increased where special traffic
      analyses substantiate the need. The analyses for listed and unlisted facilities should be
      verified by the MAJCOM and should then be attached to the appropriate project
      documents as part of the justification. Facilities with multiple functions may provide
      parking for each function limited to the amounts listed in Table 8.2.
      8.5.5.3. Scope Determination.
            8.5.5.3.1. A space allowance of 29 m2 (35 yd2) per vehicle shall be used. This
            allowance includes maneuvering space for parking the vehicle and for normal interior
            lanes. Facilities shall be designed for 90 degree parking whenever practicable.
            8.5.5.3.2. Vehicle parking areas shall be surfaced and have sufficient slope to control
            drainage. Surfacing may be either flexible or rigid pavement and shall be determined
            on the basis of least life cycle cost.
            8.5.5.3.3. Vehicle parking areas located at installations having severe winters may be
            provided with exterior type electrical outlets for connection of vehicle engine heating
            devices. For purposes of these criteria, severe winters are those with temperatures of
            -23°C (-10°F) or lower for 30 or more days per year, or with an average January
            temperature of -7°C (+20°F) or lower, as determined from two 10-year (or greater)
            weather data bases. The outlets are programmed as components of the electrical
            secondary distribution lines, Overhead (CATCODE 812224) or Underground
            (CATCODE 812226).
      8.5.5.4. Dimensions. See Table 8.2.
      8.5.5.5. Design Considerations. See UFCs 3-210-02, POV Site Circulation and
      Parking, 3-250-01FA and 3-250-18FA. Facility design will include, as an integral
      component, provisions to preclude discharge of pollutants to the surrounding atmosphere,
      ground, or waters. Consult AFI 32-7041 for additional guidance on wastewater and storm
      water collection, treatment, and disposal.

      8.5.6.1. Description. This facility is intended to provide parking space for all assigned
      refueling units and hose trucks.
      8.5.6.2. Requirements Determination. A paved area is required to support continuous
      operation of loaded refueling units and hydrant hose trucks that provide fuel and oil to
      aircraft and facilities.
      8.5.6.3. Scope Determination.
         8.5.6.3.1. Separation from Buildings and Aircraft Aprons. The optimum
         separation between refueling storage areas and surrounding buildings is 30 m (100 ft).
         Use 30 m (100 ft) in planning new areas and, where conformance will not require
         extensive relocations or ground improvements, in developing existing areas. At
         existing storage areas, smaller separation distance may be established based on an
         evaluation of the size, nature, and importance of nearby exposed buildings. The
         minimum permissible separation between storage areas and buildings is 15 m (50 ft);
         between storage areas and aircraft parking aprons the minimum is 30 m (100 ft).
         8.5.6.3.2. Criteria for Parking Area Configuration.
             8.5.6.3.2.1. Provide 7.6 m (25 ft) on-center separation between parked vehicles.
             Also, establish a configuration that permits vehicles to enter parking positions in a
             single turn and exit in a single turn. (The most widely used refueling unit is the R-
             11 type, which measures 11.6 m x 2.7 m [38 ft x 8 ft 10 in] and has a 32 m [106
             ft] turning radius.)
             8.5.6.3.2.2. Select the configuration (i.e., the parking and access lane widths, and
             the parking angles) that requires the fewest square yards of pavement per parking
             position. The per-position scope is determined by dividing the total paved area by
             the total parking positions. The maximum permissible access lane width is 15.2 m
             (50 ft).
      8.5.6.4. Dimensions. See information in paragraph 8.5.7 and Refueling Vehicle Shop
      (CATCODE 214467).
      8.5.6.5. Design Considerations. Design pavement for fuel resistant surface. Use rigid
      pavement for initial construction and tar rubber concrete for overlays. Design for proper
      surface drainage. Under circumstances described under Petroleum Operations Building
      (CATCODE 121111), a 23 m2 (250 ft2) vehicle checkpoint and operator maintenance
      building may be located in the yard. A heated two-bay facility with internal washrack
      may be constructed for locations with heavy snowfall and/or winter design temperatures

  8.5.7. Private Vehicle Parking Compound.
       FAC: 8521

       CATCODE: 852271

       OPR: AFSFC/SFO, AFCESA/CEO

       OCR: N/A

     8.5.7.1. Description. This facility is a fenced storage yard with a stabilized surface and
     floodlighting. It is used to store privately owned vehicles and recreational equipment and
     abandoned and impounded vehicles. The facility may be developed as two yards at
     separate locations or a combined yard. In either case, the yard area used for abandoned or
     impounded vehicles must be separately fenced and locked so that only security forces
     have access.
        8.5.7.1.1. This facility helps alleviate various problems created by the Air Force
        members living in family quarters, dormitories and officer quarters. Because of the
        limited amount of off-street parking space, particularly in family housing areas, these
        vehicles often crowd yards and streets, and create visual blight and safety hazards.
        The hazards affect both moving vehicles and pedestrians, particularly children.
        Another problem is the vulnerability of boats, recreational trailers, and inactive
        second cars to theft, pilferage, and vandalism. This problem is magnified at bases
        where entire units are sent on extended temporary duty (TDY), such as airlift mission
        bases.
     8.5.7.2. Requirements Determination. The required size of the compound is
     determined by individual installations based on experience in impoundment requirements
     and the base commander's estimate as to how many privately owned vehicles and pieces
     of equipment must be removed from objectionable parking locations to achieve a
     satisfactory reduction in the problems described above.
     8.5.7.3. Scope Determination. The scope used for programming, budgeting, and design
     of auto stripping yards, pay parking lots, and recreation vehicle storage lots are limited by
     very specific financial considerations and by market need as documented by a
     professional, in-depth market survey. The scope is also influenced by the Services NAF
     construction prioritization system, which encourages economy in scope and composite
     facilities. The scope may be influence by needs assessment studies. Contact MAJCOM
     Director of Services for current criteria and guidelines.
     8.5.7.4. Dimensions. Varies.
     8.5.7.5. Design Considerations. See UFCs 3-210-02, 3-250-01FA and 3-250-18FA.

        OPR: AF/A4L

        OCR: AFCESA/CEO

      8.5.8.1. Description. This facility is required for standby storage of powered and non-
      powered AGE that have been repaired and are awaiting dispatch. The area is paved and,
      where necessary for efficient operations or safeguarding, fenced and lighted.
      8.5.8.2. Requirements Determination. The requirement applies to yards adjoining
      Aircraft Support Equipment Shop/Storage (CATCODE 218712) or at dispersed sub-pool
      locations. The storage yards are part of the total AGE standby storage requirement which
      may include heated and unheated buildings or sheds. For reasons of economy, yards are
      the preferred facility wherever climate and operational factors permit.
         8.5.8.2.1. Yard space requirements (in square meters) are provided out of the total
         space allowances for standby storage facilities given in Table 3.10 in Chapter 3 of
         this Manual.
         8.5.8.2.2. The above-mentioned requirements do not apply to spacing and/or placing
         fueling vehicles in structures designed for servicing equipment of this nature.
      8.5.8.3. Scope Determination. To determine the area required, a factor of 334 m2 (400
      yd2) per vehicle may be used as a guide. This factor is predicated on the use of the F-6
      type semi-trailer with M-52 type tractor.
      8.5.8.4. Dimensions. See paragraph 8.5.8.2.1.
      8.5.8.5. Design Considerations. See UFC 3-250-18FA. Facility design will include, as
      an integral component, provisions to preclude discharge of pollutants to the surrounding
      atmosphere, ground, or waters. In particular, consider oil-water separators with integral
      grit chamber for storm water runoff from AGE parking areas. Additionally, storm water
      pretreatment must comply with all applicable regulations, permits such as the National
      Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Permit Program, and the base's Storm
      Water Pollution Prevention Plan." Consult AFI 32-7041 for additional guidance on
      wastewater and storm water collection, treatment and disposal compliance.

      8.6.1.1. Description. Railroad trackage is required to serve the warehouse area and bulk
      fuel storage area. Spur track is required for switching and storing empty cars while
      awaiting pickup.
      8.6.1.2. Required Determination. Railroad trackage will have standard gauge,
      clearance, and weight of rail as specified in interstate regulations. It will connect with the
      common carrier delivering shipments to the base. Sidings will be provided for holding
      and unloading freight cars as required.
      8.6.1.3. Scope Determination. Amount of railroad trackage to be constructed is
      determined by the proximity of common carrier lines, volume of traffic, and grade
      requirements imposed by accepted railroad practices.
      8.6.1.4. Dimensions. See UFC 4-860-01FA, Railroad Design and Rehabilitation, for

   8.7.1. Fencing.
      8.7.1.1. General. A fence serves as a legal and physical demarcation of a boundary. It is
      an obstruction which must be jumped, climbed, or cut through to gain entry. From a
      security and law enforcement point of view, such actions would be regarded as
      unauthorized entry. Signs are displayed at appropriate and regular intervals on the
      exterior boundary of the fence line or on posts immediately adjacent to the exterior
448                                                          AFMAN32-1084 20 APRIL 2012


      boundary, describing the type of area and conditions for entry. This combination of
      fencing and signs is intended to discourage trespass or unauthorized entry to legal entry
      points.
      8.7.1.2. The type of fence installed for any given use depends upon the degree of
      prevention of unauthorized entry desired. For example, if the security operation requires a
      continuous surveillance of the fence line, the most substantial barrier available (Type A
      below) should be utilized. On the other hand, a sturdy multiple strand wire fence will
      serve as an adequate physical and legal barrier along the unwatched boundary of a base
      area. In every case the most economical type of fence which will satisfy the need of the
      security operation will be used. All practical use will be made of natural and structural
      features to reduce the amount of fencing required, provided they constitute an obstruction
      equal to the barrier of which they are a part.
      8.7.1.3. Among the factors which affect the selection of the type of security fencing to be
      used are:
         8.7.1.3.1. Permanency of the need;
         8.7.1.3.2. Degree of prevention or deterrence of unauthorized entry desired;
         8.7.1.3.3. Physical layout of the installation or area and its immediate environs;
         8.7.1.3.4. Topography and climate;
         8.7.1.3.5. Nearness and nature of adjacent populated or built-up areas;
         8.7.1.3.6. Adjacent land use;
         8.7.1.3.7. Existing fencing or barriers;
         8.7.1.3.8. Degree of military control exercised in the areas immediately adjacent; and
         8.7.1.3.9. Local threat assessment, considering both criminal and terrorist threats.
      8.7.1.4. Determinations and recommendations are made by the installation Resource
      Protection Executive Committee. See AFI 31-101.
      8.7.1.5. The majority of requirements for fencing can be satisfied by the types of fences
      described below, singly or in any combination. Fences and barriers for contingency
      operations, including base defense, are specified in UFC 4-020-01.
         8.7.1.5.1. Type A - Chain link, 50 mm (2 in) square mesh, woven 9 gauge (3.76 mm
         or 0.148 in) steel wire fabric, 2.1 m (7 ft) high, surmounted by 3 strands of barbed
         wire, angled outward at 45 degrees for a total height of 2.4 m (8 ft). Typical uses are
         for nuclear weapon storage areas, aircraft parking areas, areas containing resources of
         high mission or monetary value, and as a barrier between flight line activities and
         cantonment and base or immediately contiguous housing areas. In each instance,
         except for NATO sites where a coated (metal or vinyl coating) steel wire is used, the
         steel core must be 9 gauge (3.76 mm or 0.148 in), not including the coating. Coated
         steel wire purchased or installed before January 1, 1980 is considered to meet
         requirements as long as the core wire is 11 gauge (3.05 mm or 0.1205 in).
             8.7.1.5.1.1. Type A1 - Chain link, 2.1 m (7 ft) high, surmounted by 6 strands of
             barbed wire, 3 on each side of a "Y"-shaped outrigger, for a total height of 2.4 m
AFMAN32-1084 20 APRIL 2012                                                                    449


            (8 ft). Typical uses are for nuclear weapon storage areas and alert aircraft areas.
            8.7.1.5.1.2. Type A2 - Chain link, 1.8 m (6 ft) high, surmounted by 3 strands of
            barbed wire, angled outward for a total height of 2.1 m (7 ft). Typical uses are for
            areas containing high mission or monetary value and as a barrier between flight
            line activities and the base cantonment or housing area.
        8.7.1.5.2. Type B - Barbed wire, 3-strand, 1.2 m (4 ft) high. Typical uses are
        extension of flight line area barriers, perimeter boundary for isolated portions of
        installations, livestock barrier, and area boundary for on-base bulk material storage
        areas. Fence used for livestock barrier may be designed to higher standards if
        necessary to satisfy the requirements of local and state law.
        8.7.1.5.3. Type B - Barbed wire, 4-strand, 1.2 m (4 ft) high. The fence is provided for
        livestock barrier at the boundaries of livestock grazing lands that adjoin airfield
        operational areas if justified under Boundary Fence (CATCODE 872245).
        8.7.1.5.4. Type C - Concertina Wire. In normal use one coil provides a barrier 0.9 m
        (3 ft) in diameter. Concertina wire should be used in multiple stacked coils. It is
        primarily considered an expedient for short term use or pending the erection of
        permanent type fencing.
     8.7.1.6. Requirements for fencing by type of installation and application are stated in
     AFMAN 31 series for restricted areas, AFI 31-101 for controlled areas, and DoD
     5100.76-M for base defense. Details on installation of Type A fencing are found in
     USACE Specification, which guides Air Force construction.

     8.7.2.1. Description. As a general rule the perimeter of Air Force installations will be
     delineated by some type of fencing.
     8.7.2.2. Requirements Determination.
        8.7.2.2.1. In exceptional cases the entire installation may have a uniform degree of
        security importance, however, as a practical matter, all areas, materials, and facilities
        within an installation are not of equal security priority. In effect, extensive security
        effort protecting Air Force real property per se is not warranted. Notwithstanding the
        use of fencing for resource protection purposes, the need for unmistakable installation
        boundary delineation becomes all the more acute as military bases become lucrative
        targets for dissident individuals or groups seeking entry for private or political
        motives. Therefore, economical and realistic satisfaction of an installation
        commander's legal and moral responsibilities for the protection of property under his
        command can be satisfied by the use of Type A2 fence, described above.

         8.7.2.2.2. The type of fence required at the boundaries of livestock grazing land that
         adjoin airfield operational areas requires special study and determination. The
         effectiveness of Type B, 3-strand fence in confining livestock must be evaluated on a
         case-by-case basis. If a survey reveals that locally existing and properly installed 3-
         strand fence is providing satisfactory confinement under conditions (including
         livestock pressures) similar to that prevailing or foreseen at the airfield in question,
         such fencing should be used for new installation and replacement. If there is clear
         evidence that a stronger fence is needed, Type B, 4-strand fencing may be installed.
         With either 3- or 4-strand fences, provide, as required, hinged rigid steel gates with
         break-away features for emergency type vehicles.

Building Definitions—The definitions provided below are used in this Manual and used by the
Military Departments and DoD Components to describe the levels and types of construction of
most DoD buildings and related facilities.
Building System and Subsystems—A building system is an assembly of dimensionally and
functionally pre-coordinated subsystems which, when combined, produces an essentially
complete and functional building. A subsystem is one of many building components designed
and manufactured to be combined and integrated with other types of subsystems to produce an
entire building system.
Industrialized Buildings—Buildings in which major components and some subsystems are
constructed at a factory, transported to the job site and erected. An example is factory
construction of individual walls with the plumbing and electrical wiring already installed.
Manufactured Buildings—Buildings constructed from whole building modules that are
constructed at a factory, transported to the job site and connected to other modules to form an
entire structure. An example is multistory unaccompanied personnel housing in which each
living unit is factory constructed with walls, floors, ceilings plumbing, and electrical wiring.
Mobilization and Emergency Construction—Buildings and facilities designed and constructed
to serve a specific mobilization or emergency requirement. Buildings should be austere to
minimize construction time and maximize conservation of critical materials. Maintenance
factors and longevity should be secondary considerations.
Permanent Construction—Buildings and facilities designed and constructed to serve a life
expectancy of more than 25 years, should be energy efficient, and should have finishes,
materials, and systems selected for low maintenance and low life cycle cost.
Pre-Engineered Buildings—Buildings constructed entirely from a manufacturer’s system of
standard stock items. Pre-engineered buildings often rely on a modular dimension system and
can be constructed in a wide range of configurations and sizes.
Portable Buildings—Buildings designed to be easily moved intact.
 476                                                         AFMAN32-1084 20 APRIL 2012


Relocatable Buildings—Buildings designed to be dismantled to facilitate relocation and
normally purchased as equipment to fill a temporary requirement.
Semipermanent Construction—Buildings and facilities designed and constructed to serve a life
expectancy of more than five years but less than 25 years, should be energy efficient, and should
have finishes, materials, and systems selected for a moderate degree of maintenance using the
life cycle approach.
Temporary Construction—Buildings and facilities designed and constructed to serve a life
expectancy of five years or less using low cost construction, and with finishes, materials, and
systems selected with maintenance factors being a secondary consideration.
Interior Taxilane—A taxilane which provides a secondary taxi route to an individual parking
position or a hangar and is not intended or used as a primary taxi route for through traffic.
Peripheral Taxilane—A taxilane located along the periphery of an apron and intended as a
primary taxi route.
Through Taxilane—A taxilane providing a route through or across an apron which is intended
as a primary taxi route for access to other taxilanes, aprons, taxiways or the runway.
AFMAN32-1084 20 APRIL 2012                                                                     477


                                          Attachment 2
                          FACILITY REQUIREMENTS SYSTEM

A2.1. The DoD Real Property Classification System (RPCS). The RPCS is a hierarchical
scheme of real property types and functions that serves as the framework for identifying,
categorizing, and analyzing, DoD’s inventory of land and facilities around the world. This
scheme is comprised of a 5-tier structure represented by numerical codes, with 1-digit codes
being the most general and 6-digit codes representing the most specific types of facilities.
A2.2. Category Codes. At the most detailed level, numerical codes, commonly known as
CATCODE, represent each type of facility in the Air Force’s inventory. CATCODE are
generally similar but not identical between the Military Departments. Because of these
differences, and to allow consistent macro-level analysis and planning across all of the Military
Departments, DoD established a higher-level facility classification that groups facilities with
similar functions and units of measure from each Military Departments into common Facility
Analysis Categories (FAC). FACs are represented by a 4-digit code. Successively larger
groupings of facility types are represented by 3-, 2-, and 1-digit numerical classifications.
A2.3. Real Property Classification System (RPCS) Structure. The RPCS structure is
numerically consistent between the 1-digit level and the 4-digit level. For example, the Facility
Class represented by the code "1" for "Operation and Training facilities" consists of the 2-, 3-,
and 4-digit codes that also begin with the numeral 1. Likewise, the Category Group represented
by the code "11" for "Airfield Pavements" consists of the 3- and 4-digit codes that also begin
with 'l1." The exception to this rule is FAC 9999, "Not real property," which has no two-or three-
digit counterparts. (See Table A2.1) Further information on the DoD Real Property
Classification System can be viewed on the Office of the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense,
Installations               and                Environment                Web                 site:
http://www.acq.osd.mil/ie/fim/programanalysis_budget/tool_metrics/RPCS/rpcs.shtml.
   A2.3.1. The names for each level in the RPCS are as follows, with Table A2.1 providing an
   example of the hierarchy:
   Facility Class (FC)                       1-digit level

   Category Group (CG)                       2-digit level

   Basic Category (BC)                       3-digit level

   Facility Analysis Category (FAC)          4-digit level

   Category Code (CATCODE)                   5- and 6-digit level

   A2.3.2. Table A2.2 provides a complete list of all the Air Force RPCS codes broken
   down by CATCODE, FAC, CATCODE Title, OPR, OCR and location within the Manual, if
   applicable.
