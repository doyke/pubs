to AFMAN 23-220, Reports of Survey for Air Force Property. Ensure that all records created as
a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with AFMAN
33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with Air Force Records
Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at
https://www.my.af.mil/gess-af61a/afrims/afrims/. Refer recommended changes and questions
about this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF Form 847,
Recommendation for Change of Publication; route AF Form 847s from the field through the
appropriate functional’s chain of command.

1. Scope: The ROS program was established to research and investigate the cause of loss,
damage, or destruction of property and determine if it was attributable to an individual’s
negligence or abuse. Refer to Chapter 3, AFMAN 23-220 for determining when a ROS is
required.
2. Organization Responsibility/Procedures for Processing a ROS: IAW AFMAN 23-220,
when property is lost, damaged, or destroyed by an individual or organization, the organization
that has possession of the property will initiate the ROS and that unit commander will appoint an
investigating officer who will determine the facts in the case. Utilizing DD Form 200, the
organization initiating the ROS will promptly contact the 934 AW ROS Program Manager so
that a ROS number can be assigned and a suspense date established to ensure timely completion
of the investigation. The initiator of the ROS must advise the 934 AW ROS Program Manager if
any person involved in the loss or damage to government property is scheduled for separation.
When this situation occurs, every effort should be made to expedite both the completion of the
ROS and the collection action (if applicable).
2                                                                  934AWI65-101 10 JULY 2012


    2.1. The investigating officer will be an officer, non-commissioned officer (E7 or above) or
    civilian employee in grades GS-7, WG-9, WL-5, or WS-1 or above. The investigating
    officer cannot be the individual responsible for the equipment and must have no interest in
    the custodianship, care, accountability, or safekeeping of the property. If feasible, the
    investigator will be senior in rank to the person(s) being investigated and be from a unit
    different from the one involved in the ROS. When the investigating officer is not senior in
    rank or grade to the individual(s) being investigated, the person who appointed the
    investigating officer will advise the group commander in writing as to why this was
    necessary. This document will be included as an exhibit as part of the ROS file.
       2.1.1. The investigating officer, at a minimum, will answer six basic questions:
           2.1.1.1. What happened?
           2.1.1.2. How did it happen?
           2.1.1.3. Where did it happen?
           2.1.1.4. When did it happen?
           2.1.1.5. Who was involved?
           2.1.1.6. Was there any evidence of negligence, misconduct, or deliberate
           unauthorized use or disposition of the property?

           2.1.2.2. Block 2: Inquiry/Investigation Number. This is the number received from
           the ROS Program Manager. This number provides a control and/or suspense for
           completion of this phase of the investigation.
           2.1.2.3. Block 3: Date Loss Discovered. Self-Explanatory.
           2.1.2.4. Block 4: National Stock Number. Enter either the national stock number or
           manufacturer’s part number. If none of these exist enter “N/A”.
           2.1.2.5. Block 5: Item Description. Enter the correct name of the property including
           any serial numbers. If the property is not stock listed, give an accurate description
           sufficient for identification. If only a portion of the item is damaged, describe the
           item fully, and then describe the damages. If a vehicle is damaged, describe the type
           of vehicle and vehicle number. If additional space is needed, utilize bond paper
           identified as a continuation sheet.
           2.1.2.6. Block 6: Quantity. Enter the quantity, and if applicable, standard unit of
           measure for the item.
           2.1.2.7. Block 7: Unit Cost. Enter actual unit cost or standard price (current
           replacement cost). A copy of the organization’s CA/CRL or ADPE listing should
           also be included as an exhibit to the ROS if it identifies the current cost of the item(s).
           Questions regarding prices should be referred to the individual who is accountable for
           the property.
934AWI65-101 10 JULY 2012                                                                      3


        2.1.2.8. Block 8: Total Cost. Enter the quantity times unit cost. If a vehicle is
        involved, include labor and material cost. If a vehicle has been damaged, include a
        copy of the estimate of damage or actual cost document, if the vehicle has been
        repaired.
        2.1.2.9. Block 9: Circumstances. Based on the facts, the investigating officer makes
        findings and recommendations on the issue of liability for those involved. At a
        minimum, the block will contain answers to the questions in 2.1.1 above. If
        negligence, willful misconduct, or deliberate unauthorized use appears to be evident,
        the amount of financial liability recommended will also be computed. If a vehicle is
        involved, include the equipment authorization inventory data (EAID) detail document
        number.
        2.1.2.10. Block 10: Actions Taken To Correct Circumstances Reported In Block 9
        And Prevent Future Occurrences.            If the investigation reveals deficiencies in
        directives, procedures, controls, etc., a statement of corrective action will be prepared
        by the investigating officer to document the action that was taken or will be taken to
        prevent recurrence of the incident.
        2.1.2.11. Block 11: Individual Completing Blocks 1-10. Self-Explanatory.
        2.1.2.12. Block 12: Responsible Officer. Completed by the individual within the
        organization who has responsibility for safekeeping of property. This is normally the
        unit custodian.      This individual enters comments, recommendations and
        concurrence/non-concurrence with the findings of the investigating officer. Upon
        completion of blocks 1-12, the DD Form 200, with any attachments, will be
        forwarded to the 934 AW ROS Program Manager, for further processing.
        2.1.2.13. Block 13:       Appointing Authority. Once the ROS Program Manager
        receives the completed DD Form 200 from the organization, it will be reviewed for
        completeness prior to forwarding to the appropriate Group Commander who has been
        designated as the Appointing Authority for all reports within their change of
        command. The Appointing Authority will review the report to determine whether or
        not financial liability should be assessed. In most cases, financial liability IS NOT
        assessed if there is no evidence of negligence or abuse surrounding the loss of the
        equipment.
        2.1.2.14. Block 14: Approving Official. If the total dollar value of the loss is less
        than $2,000 and financial liability will not be assessed, then the Appointing Official
        (Group Commander) can finalize the ROS and sign off in block 14. Any loss over
        the $2,000 threshold requires final approval of the Wing Commander.
        2.1.2.15. Block 15: Financial Liability Officer. In instances where the Appointing
        Authority has determined that financial liability should be assessed, the person
        appointed as the Financial Liability Officer will further investigate the situation and
        complete this section of the form. Otherwise, the section is left blank.
        2.1.2.16. Block 16: Individual Charged. Leave blank unless financial liability is
        recommended.
 4                                                                 934AWI65-101 10 JULY 2012


            2.1.2.17. Block 17: Accountable Officer. In order to adjust property records, base
            supply or the communications section will complete block 17 to document record
            adjustments. Base supply will adjust records for equipment on the unit’s CA/CRL
            and the communications section will adjust records for any loss reported on IT
            equipment.
        2.1.3. Once the DD Form 200 has been completed by all required offices, the original
        will be returned to the ROS Program manager with a copy to the unit.
