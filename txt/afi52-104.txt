                             JOINT READINESS ENVIRONMENT

2.1. Deployed Chaplain Corps Members: Deploy in accordance with (IAW) the Chaplain
Corps Supplement to The War Mobilization Plan - 1, War and Mobilization Plan (WMP -1); AFI
10-403, Deployment Planning and Execution; the current Chaplain Corps Posturing and
Sequencing Guidance and the Mission Capabilities (MISCAPS) in the Deliberate and Crisis
Action Planning and Execution Segments (DCAPES).
     2.1.1. Chaplain Conduct: Chaplains will refrain from all activities that could create
     perceptions of combatant behavior or that compromise the protected status of other chaplains
     in the field. It is a Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC) violation to use chaplains in any direct
     military capacity that could jeopardize a chaplain’s noncombatant status. Chaplains will not
     act nor give the appearance of acting as informants, intelligence officers, or political agents.
     Chaplains will not take part in psychological operations or in manipulating civilian
     relationships for political or military motives. Chaplains do not bear or transport arms or
     ammunition. Chaplains will not engage in other traditional combatant activities, e.g.,

     2.1.2. RST Conduct: Chaplain Corps personnel engage with senior military chaplains and
     local religious leaders to support the religious, spiritual, moral and ethical needs and the
     morale of personnel assigned or attached to the commander, as directed by the appropriate
     commander. Chaplain assistants will refrain from activities that would compromise the
     integrity of the RST and the role of the chaplain as liaison. The RST must only engage in
     religious functions, such as providing ministry to the sick and wounded, and spiritual support
     to the fighting force which do not violate the provisions of Geneva Conventions I and II.
     2.1.3. Non-compliance with Noncombatant Status. A violation of the chaplain’s
     obligations as a noncombatant constitutes a breach of duty as well as a failure to meet Air
     Force standards. Actions may be taken against a chaplain under the provisions of the
     Uniformed Code of Military Justice (UCMJ).
     2.1.4. Military Chaplains in Service to Detainees or Enemy Prisoners of War (EPW).
     The requirements of the Geneva Conventions are to be followed in the spiritual care of

     Prisoners of War, August 12, 1949)
        2.1.4.1. Military chaplains may assist and support retained clergy and appointed lay

Refer to JP 1-02, DoD Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms, and AFDD 1-2, Air Force
Glossary, for a complete listing of abbreviations, acronyms and definitions of terms.

Terms
Administrative Control (ADCON)—Direction or exercise of authority over subordinate or
other organizations in respect to administration and support, including organization of Service
forces, control of resources and equipment, personnel management, unit logistics, individual and
unit training, readiness, mobilization, demobilization, discipline, and other matters not included
in the operational missions of the subordinate or other organizations. (JP 1-02)
Command and Control (C2)—The exercise of authority and direction by a properly designated
commander over assigned and attached forces in the accomplishment of the mission. Command
and control functions are performed through an arrangement of personnel, equipment,
communications, facilities, and procedures employed by a commander in planning, directing,
coordinating, and controlling forces and operations in the accomplishment of the mission (JP 1-
02).
Emergency Responders—The response elements of a DRF that deploy to the accident scene
after the First Responders to expand C2 and perform support functions. Emergency Responders
include follow-on elements such as firefighters, law enforcement personnel, security personnel,
and emergency medical technicians, as well as emergency management personnel, EOD
personnel, physicians, nurses, medical treatment providers at medical treatment facilities, public
health officers, bioenvironmental engineering personnel, and mortuary affairs personnel.
AFI52-104 30 AUGUST 2012                                                                           23


Emergency Responders also include specialized teams such as the EMST or SMT. Not all
Emergency Responders are First Responders, but all First Responders are Emergency
Responders. Emergency Responders are not assigned to additional duties that will conflict with
their emergency duties.
High Demand/Low Supply (HD/LS)—Limited assets/forces with unique mission capabilities
stressed by continual high OPTEMPO because of Combatant Commander requirements.
Individual Augmentee (IA)—Individual Augmentation represents unfunded temporary duty
positions (military or civilian) requested to augment a supported combatant commander’s or
governmental agency’s staff operations during contingencies. Similar to requests for forces
(RFFs) in support of contingencies, IA requirements are inherently temporary in nature and are
not to be used to solve permanent manning or capability shortages. (see AFI 10-401 for
additional information on IAs)
Joint Expeditionary Tasking (JET)—If a standard force solution (i.e. a mission ready, Joint
capable force with associated table of organization and equipment executing its core mission)
cannot be made, the JFP may recommend a non-standard force solution. While the Joint Staff
has defined three categories of non-standard force solutions, the Air Force collectively refers to
its contribution to these as JET. A JET sourcing solution becomes a factor when the traditional
force provider for the requested force or capability cannot fill the requirement or there is no
traditional force provider. (See AFI 10-401 for additional information on JETs)
Mission Capability (MISCAP)—A short paragraph that describes the capability a specific unit
type code is expected to have at execution. The statement usually contains pertinent information
such as type base to be deployed to, functions included, and other augmentation requirements
necessary to conduct specific missions.
Noncombatant Evacuation Operation (NEO)—Operations directed by the Department of
State, the Department of Defense, or other appropriate authority whereby noncombatants are
evacuated from areas of danger overseas to safe havens or to the United States.
Operational Control (OPCON)—Operational control normally provides full authority to
organize commands and forces and to employ those forces as the commander in operational
control considers necessary to accomplish assigned missions; it does not, in and of itself, include
authoritative direction for logistics or matters of administration, discipline, internal organization,
or unit training.
Operations Tempo (OPSTEMPO)—A readiness term referring to the number of hours
personnel are working in support of military operations.
Personnel Reclama—When a wing/tasked unit/installation cannot meet an individual
augmentee tasking, they will request relief by submitting a personnel reclama through the local
manpower and military personnel flight to their parent MAJCOM personnel readiness office.
Personnel Tempo (PERSTEMPO)—A readiness term referring to length of time personnel are
TDY from their home base in support of military operations.
Reachback—The process of obtaining products, services, and applications or forces, equipment,
or material from Air Force organizations that are not forward deployed . This capability allows
commanders to obtain or coordinate support from units not physically located with the forward
force. By leveraging advances in communications technology, reachback capabilities make it
 24                                                               AFI52-104 30 AUGUST 2012


possible to utilize CONUS and/or rear-based assets and organizations to perform various
functions in support of AEF operations. Effective use of reachback will reduce the number of
personnel and amount of equipment which deploys to the AOR, reduce airlift and support
requirements, and will positively impact a commander’s ability to protect the deployed force.
Reachback is predicated on global communications, rapid global mobility, and time-definite
resupply capabilities.
Ready Reserve—The Selected Reserve, Individual Ready Reserve, and Inactive National Guard
liable for active duty as prescribed by law (US Code, Title 10 (DOD), sections 10142, 12301,
and 12302).
Required Delivery Date (RDD)—A date, relative to C-day, when a unit must arrive at its
destination and complete off-loading to properly support the concept of operations (JP 1-02).
Religious Support Team (RST)—A team that is composed of a chaplain and an Army
Chaplains Assistant or Navy Religious Program Specialist or Marine Corps chaplain assistant or
Air Force chaplain assistant and/or Coast Guard assigned personnel. The team works together in
designing, implementing, and executing the command religious program (JP 1-05).
Tactical Control (TACON)—The detailed and usually local direction and control of
movements or maneuvers necessary to accomplish missions or tasks assigned (JP 1-02).
Time—Phased Force and Deployment Data (TPFDD)—The JOPES data base portion of an
operation plan contains time-phased force data, non-unit-related cargo and personnel data, and
movement data for the operational plan, including: in-place units, units to be deployed to support
the operation plan with a priority indicating the desired sequence for their arrival at the port of
debarkation, routing of forces to be deployed, movement data associated with deploying forces,
estimates of non-unit-related cargo and personnel movements to be conducted concurrently with
the deployment of forces, and estimate of transportation requirements that must be fulfilled by
common-user lift resources as well.
Total Mobilization—Expansion of the active Armed Forces resulting from action by Congress
and the President to organize and/or generate additional units or personnel, beyond the existing
force structure, and the resources needed for requirements of a war or other national emergency
involving an external threat to the national security.
Unit Line Number (ULN)—A seven-character alphanumeric code that uniquely describes a unit
entry (line) in a JOPES TPFDD (JP 1-03.2)
Unit Type Code (UTC)—A five-character alphanumeric code that uniquely identifies each type
unit of the Armed Forces (JP 1-02).
UTC Shortfall—When a wing/installation tasked does not possess sufficient qualified personnel
to support a UTC tasking, they will request relief by submitting a UTC shortfall request from the
installation deployment office to their MAJCOM operation plans or deployment office. This
request will be coordinated with the local manpower office and MPF. There are two types of
personnel UTC shortfalls: a wing/installation cannot support the entire UTC and a
wing/installation can support part of the tasked UTC, but cannot fill one or more of the AFSC
requirements within the UTC.
AFI52-104 30 AUGUST 2012                                                              25


War and Mobilization Plan (WMP)—Provides the Air Staff and Air Force commanders with
current polices and planning factors for conducting and supporting wartime operations. It
establishes requirements for developing mobilization and planning programs for industrial
production to support sustained contingency operations of the programmed forces (WMP-1).
 26                                                              AFI52-104 30 AUGUST 2012
