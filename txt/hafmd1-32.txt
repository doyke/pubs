                                      ATTACHMENT 3

                  STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES
                               FOR THE
               ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF THE AIR FORCE
                  (MANPOWER AND RESERVE AFFAIRS)
                               AND THE
      DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF, MANPOWER, PERSONNEL AND SERVICES

These standard operating procedures (SOPs) apply to individuals assigned to SAF/MR and
AF/A1 who are responsible for developing policy, managing programs, and preparing guidance
on approved policies and plans for the field. These procedures are intended to facilitate routine
staff actions and functions and reduce duplication of effort between SAF/MR and AF/A1 staff
roles while increasing operating effectiveness and efficiency.

A3.1 Subject to the standard operating procedures that follow, a general description of the flow
of work between SAF/MR and AF/A1 is:

       A3.1.1. AF/A1 develops policies and submits them to SAF/MR for coordination and
       concurrence prior to SECAF approval;
       A3.1.2. AF/A1 develops AF Instructions and submits them to SAF/MR for coordination
       and concurrence prior to A1 approval;
       A3.1.3. AF/A1 develops strategic plans and submits them to SAF/MR for coordination
       and concurrence prior to A1 implementation; and,
       A3.1.4. AF/A1 executes approved policies and guidance, AF instructions, and strategic
       plans, providing additional guidance to the field as necessary.

Additionally, by establishing conditions and parameters that signal when an issue, initiative, or
performance measure requires the involvement of SAF/MR to fulfill inherent policy oversight
responsibilities (see paragraphs A3.3 thru A3.5), these standard operating procedures will help
prevent the development of a permission-seeking/permission-granted dynamic between SAF/MR
and AF/A1. SAF/MR and AF/A1 will combine senior leader field visits with reviews by the Air
Force Inspector General and Auditor General to verify the effectiveness of these standard
operating procedures, as well as the effectiveness of manpower, personnel and services
programs.

A3.2. AF/A1 Support of the Chief of Staff in his Role as a Member of the Joint Chiefs:
AF/A1 will act independently of SAF/MR when AF/A1 is providing support to the Air Force
Chief of Staff or Vice Chief of Staff in their roles as members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
including the Joint Requirements Oversight Council. To the extent not inconsistent with the
direction of the Chief of Staff or the Vice Chief of Staff, AF/A1 will keep SAF/MR informed of
significant matters in these areas.
