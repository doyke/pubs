a revision from the previous edition.
Chapter 3, REPLACED. This chapter has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed.
(66ABW) This publication reflects the Security Forces (SF) reorganization into the S-functions and adds
the requirements for expired AF Form 75s. Changes organization from 66 ABW/JA to ESC/JAB.
Changes organization from ESC/SE to 66 ABW/SE. Deletes the need for the DD Form 2220, Department
of Defense Vehicle Registration Decal. Clarifies the HAFB Parking Plan, as pertaining to privileged park-
ing, based off the change of the Federal Civil Service National Security Personnel System (NSPS) pay
grade structure. Implements various changes reflected in AFI 91-207, AFMC Sup, dated 1 Oct 07.

                                       DRIVING PRIVILEGES

2.1. Requirements for Driving Privileges.
    2.1.1. Driving a government owned vehicle (GOV) or POV on an Air Force installation is a privilege
    granted by the installation commander. If you accept that privilege, you must comply with the laws
    and instructions governing motor vehicle operation and registration on the installation. Consequently,
    everyone operating a motor vehicle on a military installation must produce, upon request from the
    security police, the following:
    2.1.1. (66ABW) Unless otherwise instructed by military instructions, policies or exigencies, the Mas-
    sachusetts Motor Vehicle Law is applicable to traffic and vehicles. In accordance with the provisions
    of this supplement, paved base roadways are open to the use of the public, but are subject to military
    requirements. Operation of privately owned vehicles (POVs), including motorcycles, motor-driven
    cycles, all-terrain vehicles and snowmobiles, off paved base roadways is prohibited. Only govern-
    ment-owned vehicles (GOVs) on official government business may operate off paved base roadways,
    and only when there are no safety or environmental restrictions imposed on the area to be used.
       2.1.1.1. Proof of vehicle ownership or registration if required by the issuing authority.
       2.1.1.2. A valid state, overseas command, host nation, or international driver’s license and/or AF
       Form 2293, US Air Force Motor Vehicle Operator’s Identification Card, supported by a DD
       Form 2, US Armed Forces Identification Card. Locally determine acceptable identification
       media for civilian personnel and base contractors. Note: Each installation commander must deter-
       mine if international drivers licenses are recognized and accepted by the local (civilian) jurisdic-
       tion, and if so, will their use be authorized on the installation. As a general rule, most CONUS
       civilian jurisdictions will honor use of international drivers licenses for short periods of time by
       non-resident visitors and assigned military personnel. When practical, installation commanders
       should assimilate local policy to preclude conflicting policy.
       2.1.1.2. (66ABW) A valid state driver’s license constitutes acceptable driving authorization
       media for civilian personnel and base contractors. International driver’s licenses will be accepted
       for up to 30 days for newly-assigned military personnel.
       2.1.1.3. If required by the jurisdiction in which the vehicle is operated, a valid record of motor
       vehicle safety inspection, emission control test, or any other test, evaluation, safety inspection, or
       other documents required by local, state, or host nation law or agreement. Note: In some
       instances, a state or other governing jurisdiction in which a vehicle is registered may require, as a
       condition for keeping registration/plates issued by that state or jurisdiction, a safety or other
       inspection even when the vehicle is operated in another state or jurisdiction. Though not enforce-
       able (in another state), failure to comply may invalidate the vehicle registration leaving the owner/
       operator in a precarious legal position. In such cases, it becomes the owner's responsibility to
       comply with their "home state" or other issuing jurisdiction requirements in addition to host state
       requirements. Owners should secure host registration when unable to comply with licensing and/
       or registration requirements issued by their home state or other jurisdiction.
       2.1.1.4. Proof of current vehicle insurance when required by state, host nation, or the installation
       commander.
AFI31-204_66ABWSUP_I 28 MAY 2008                                                                           9


       2.1.1.4. (66ABW) Personnel operating a motor vehicle on Hanscom AFB must produce, upon
       request from the Security Forces, proof of current vehicle insurance meeting the minimum
       requirements as prescribed by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

2.2. Stopping and Inspecting Personnel or Vehicles.
   2.2.1. The security police may stop vehicles on military installations based on the installation com-
   mander's authority. The following principles govern the stopping of motor vehicles:
       2.2.1.1. In overseas areas, security police may stop, search, and detain vehicles on or off base as
       determined by host nation agreements and local command policy.
       2.2.1.2. AFI 31-209, The Air Force Resource Protection Program, local command instructions,
       and policies established by the installation commander will detail stop, inspection, search, and
       impoundment of motor vehicles at CONUS installation entry gates and in Air Force restricted
       areas.
       2.2.1.2. (66ABW) 66 ABWI 31-101, Installation Security Instruction, details stop, inspection,
       search and impoundment of motor vehicles at Hanscom AFB. The Hanscom AFB Random Instal-
       lation Entry Point Check (RIEPC) program is established pursuant to AFI 31-101, The Air Force
       Installation Security Program, Chapter 8, Paragraph 8.7. RIEPC policy and procedures are identi-
       fied in 66 ABWI 31-101, Paragraph 6.6.
       2.2.1.3. On-base traffic stops and inspections (other than at entry gates and restricted areas) of
       POVs is authorized when there is a reasonable basis to believe it’s necessary to enforce a traffic
       regulation or when there is suspicion of criminal activity.
   2.2.2. MAJCOMs responsible for overseas military installations must provide their installation com-
   manders with written guidelines governing stop, inspection, search, and impoundment of vehicles.
   This guidance must reflect host nation agreements and pass appropriate legal review. Note: A theater
   commander or those commanding unified forces may direct policy covering all installations under
   their command. In this case, MAJCOMs must review those policies before issuing their guidance.

2.3. Implied Consent to Blood, Breath, or Urine Tests. Drivers give consent to evidential tests for
alcohol or other drug content of their blood, breath, and/or urine as a condition to accepting installation
driving privileges. This consent applies when lawfully detained, apprehended, or cited for any impaired
driving offense committed while driving or in physical control of a motor vehicle on an Air Force instal-
lation.
2.3. (66ABW) Vehicle operators on Hanscom AFB must comply with Massachusetts General Law,
Chapter 90, §24, regarding implied consent.

2.4. Implied Consent to Vehicle Impoundment. As a condition to accepting installation driving privi-
leges, drivers must give their consent for the removal and temporary impoundment of their POV if their
POV is: 1) Illegally parked for unreasonable periods; 2) Interferes with traffic operations; 3) Creates a
safety hazard; 4) Disabled by accident or incident; 5) Left unattended in, or adjacent to, a restricted, con-
trolled, or off-limits area; and 6) Abandoned. Drivers also agree to reimburse an authorized agency or
contractor for the cost of towing, storage, and disposal should a need arise to remove or impound their
motor vehicle because of a situation described above.
10                                                            AFI31-204_66ABWSUP_I 28 MAY 2008


2.4. (66ABW) Drivers give their consent for the removal and temporary impoundment of their POV if
their POV is parked during times and in areas prohibited by 66 ABWI 32-1002, Snow and Ice Control
Plan.
     2.4.1. Installation commanders define in local procedures or supplement to this instruction, the defi-
     nitions for "unreasonable periods," "abandoned," and other terms relevant to enforcement action
     under paragraph 2.4. Incorporate those instructions, procedures, and definitions into the local instal-
     lation traffic code and make them known to the general public.
     2.4.1. (66ABW) “Unreasonable period” is defined as “at least 72 hours”. “Abandoned” will include
     any vehicle parked for an unreasonable period in a public area, in a state of disrepair or with expired
     registration and/or improper installation registration.

2.5. Suspension or Revocation of Driving Privileges . Installation commanders may suspend or
revoke installation driving privileges and POV registration for lawful reasons both related and unrelated
to traffic violations or safe vehicle operations. Installation commanders must incorporate procedures gov-
erning suspension and revocation in local publications or supplement to this instruction. Make these
known to the general public.
     2.5.1. Suspensions.
        2.5.1.1. Installation commanders can suspend driving privileges for serious violations or when
        lesser measures fail to improve a driver's performance. The commander may also suspend or
        revoke licenses for up to 12 months if a driver continually violates installation parking standards,
        or habitually violates other standards considered non-moving in nature. Installation commanders
        determine suspension and revocation policy for non-moving violations, as well as what constitutes
        a non-moving violation on their installation (i.e., performing unauthorized repair; failure to regis-
        ter; unauthorized modifications or alterations; failure to maintain safety standards, etc.). Make
        these standards part of the local installation traffic code and take reasonable steps to make them
        known to the general public.
        2.5.1.1. (66ABW) Non-moving violations include, but are not limited to, parking in prohibited
        areas and parking a vehicle with expired registration in public areas. The Reports and Analysis
        Section (66 SFS/S5R), through 66 SFS/CC, will notify 66 MSG/CC of habitual offenders. The 66
        MSG/CC will make the final determination for suspension and revocation of base driving privi-
        leges.
        2.5.1.2. The installation commander has discretionary authority and may withdraw anyone's
        authorization to operate a government or privately owned motor vehicle on the installation.
        2.5.1.3. Installation commanders will immediately suspend installation GOV or POV driving
        privileges pending resolution of an intoxicated driving incident which involves active duty mili-
        tary personnel, their family members, retired members of the military service, and DoD civilian
        personnel. This applies regardless of the geographic location of an intoxicated driving incident.
        Installation commanders can only suspend privileges of non-DoD affiliated civilians for incidents
        occurring on the installation or in the areas subject to their military traffic jurisdiction. After a
        review of available evidence as specified in paragraph 2.6., suspend driver’s privileges pending
        resolution of the intoxicated driving incident under the circumstances outlined below:
        2.5.1.3. (66ABW) 66 MSG/CC will issue, through the 66 SFS/CC, a written, temporary suspen-
        sion of installation driving privileges order to offenders as soon as possible after the incident. If
AFI31-204_66ABWSUP_I 28 MAY 2008                                                                       11


     this cannot be immediately accomplished, apprehending Security Forces personnel will verbally
     advise the offender of the regulatory driving restrictions before release. The advisement will be
     followed up in writing by 66 MSG/CC within 72 hours or a reasonable period of time thereafter.
         2.5.1.3.1. Refusal to take or complete a lawfully requested chemical test to determine blood
         alcohol content BAC) or breath alcohol content (BrAC) for alcohol or other drugs.
         2.5.1.3.2. Operating a motor vehicle with BAC or BrAC of 0.10 percent by volume or higher.
         2.5.1.3.3. Operating a motor vehicle with a BAC or BrAC below 0.10 percent blood alcohol
         by volume if the jurisdiction in which the vehicle is operated imposes a suspension for a BAC
         or BrAC level below 0.10.
         2.5.1.3.3. (66ABW) The Commonwealth of Massachusetts imposes a driver’s license suspen-
         sion for a Blood Alcohol Content (BAC) or Breath Alcohol Content (BrAC) level of 0.08 or
         higher for operators over 21 years old and a suspension for a BAC or BrAC level of 0.02 or
         higher for vehicle operators under 21 years old. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts
         imposes a suspension for a BAC or BrAC level of 0.05 or higher for vehicle operators operat-
         ing on a Commercial Driver’s License while operating a commercial vehicle.
         2.5.1.3.4. On an arrest report or other official document reasonably showing an intoxicated
         driving incident occurred.
  2.5.2. Revocation.
     2.5.2.1. The installation commander will immediately revoke driving privileges for a period of
     not less than one year in the following circumstances:
         2.5.2.1.1. A person is lawfully detained for intoxicated driving and refuses to submit to or
         complete tests to measure blood alcohol or drug content as required by the law of the jurisdic-
         tion, installation traffic code, or this instruction.
         2.5.2.1.2. A conviction, nonjudicial punishment, or a military or civilian administrative action
         resulting in the suspension or revocation of a driver’s license for intoxicated driving. Official
         documentation is required as the basis for this type of revocation action.
         2.5.2.1.2. (66ABW) A one-year base driving privilege revocation will be imposed for convic-
         tion in an off-base civilian court of Operating Under the Influence (OUI) or a lesser-included
         alcohol-related offense, such as alcohol-related reckless driving, when the original offense
         charged was OUI.
         2.5.2.1.3. When a serious incident involving a motor vehicle occurs and the installation com-
         mander determines immediate revocation of driving privileges is required to preserve public
         safety or the good order and discipline of military personnel.
         2.5.2.1.4. (Added-66ABW) Any illegal drug detection may result in a one-year base driving
         suspension pending due process.
     2.5.2.2. The CSP develops plans and procedures to forward revocation, suspension, and driving
     records to gaining commanders and to initiate appropriate staff action when receiving similar
     records from losing commanders of inbound personnel.
         2.5.2.2.1. (Added-66ABW) When 66 SFS/S5R is notified (via the Virtual MPF Out Process-
         ing system) of personnel changing duty stations, it will forward an “Individual History
12                                                             AFI31-204_66ABWSUP_I 28 MAY 2008


            Record” to the gaining commander if the individual’s driver’s license is revoked or suspended,
            if the individual has accumulated traffic points or if the individual has any other history logged
            in the Security Forces Management Information System (SFMIS). If the gaining base’s SFS
            unit is equipped with SFMIS, S5R will send the “Individual History Record” via SFMIS His-
            tory Transfer. If the gaining base’s SFS unit is not equipped with SFMIS, S5R will send a
            paper copy to that SFS unit. The gaining SFS unit will then forward the individual’s informa-
            tion to the gaining commander.
            2.5.2.2.2. (Added-66ABW) When 66 SFS/S5R receives an “Individual History Record” for
            an inbound individual, it will send a copy to that person’s gaining commander and retain a
            copy in SFMIS.
        2.5.2.3. When temporary suspensions are followed by revocations, compute the revocation period
        from the original suspension date, exclusive of any period during which full driving privileges
        were restored pending resolution of charges.
        2.5.2.4. Installation commanders may impose multiple suspensions to run consecutively or con-
        currently.
        2.5.2.4. (66ABW) Multiple suspensions will run consecutively unless otherwise determined by
        the revoking authority.

2.6. Reciprocal Procedures.
     2.6.1. Air Force installation commanders will honor revocations issued by other installation com-
     manders regardless of service component affiliation. Revocations remain in effect during reassign-
     ment unless the issuing authority terminates the revocation before reassignment. Installation
     commander may honor suspensions as determined on a case by case basis. Anyone with suspended or
     revocated privileges may petition an installation commander for partial or limited driving privileges.

2.7. Administrative Due Process for Suspensions and Revocations.
     2.7.1. When considering suspending or revoking someone’s driving privileges, notify that person in
     writing and tell them what action you are taking and the reason for it. Coordinate this notice with the
     base legal office.
     2.7.1. (66ABW) When an individual accumulates 12 points on their base driving record within a
     12-month period, 66 SFS/S5R notifies Base Legal (ESC/JAB). ESC/JAB will coordinate with 66
     MSG/CC to determine if the individual’s driving privileges should be suspended or revoked. If 66
     MSG/CC determines the individual’s driving privileges should be revoked or suspended, 66 MSG/CC
     creates a letter for the individual addressing the action taken and the reason for it. 66 SFS/S5R sends
     the letter to the individual via certified mail and updates the individual’s record in SFMIS and the Sus-
     pension, Revocation, Barment, & Wanted (SRBW) roster. Also, when an individual accumulates six
     points, 66 SFS/S5R sends a courtesy letter to that individual through their First Sergeant or Com-
     mander explaining the actions that may be taken if the individual accumulates 12 points within a
     12-month period. The letter will also explain that anyone who accumulates six or more points must
     contact ABW Safety and complete the Defensive Driving Course within 60 days upon receipt of the
     letter.
     2.7.2. Except for incidents outlined in para 2.5.1.3. and 2.5.2.1., do not suspend or revoke a person's
     driving privileges until they are notified (or reasonable attempts made) and offered an administrative
AFI31-204_66ABWSUP_I 28 MAY 2008                                                                        13


  hearing. Installation commanders determine when a suspension or revocation takes effect once mak-
  ing or attempting this written notice. Only in unusual circumstances should you make verbal notifica-
  tions. Unless an application for a hearing is made within the prescribed period, suspension or
  revocation takes place on the prescribed date and time. Installation commanders determine the time
  period for staying a suspension or revocation action after receiving a request for a administrative hear-
  ing. For offenses outlined in para 2.5.1.3. and 2.5.2.1., an installation commander will authorize an
  immediate preliminary suspension based on reliable evidence. Such evidence can include witness
  statements, a military or civilian police report, chemical test results, a refusal to complete chemical
  testing, video tapes, written statements, field sobriety test results, or other evidence.
     2.7.2.1. Installation commanders or their designee must conduct evidence reviews as soon as pos-
     sible, but no later than three duty days following final assembly of evidence.
     2.7.2.2. For active duty military personnel, send a written notice of preliminary suspension for
     intoxicated driving to their commander or reasonable equivalent. For non-installation, non-DoD
     affiliated civilians, present the written notice of preliminary suspension for intoxicated driving
     either in person (preferred) or by certified mail. If the person is employed on the installation, send
     the notice to their commander or reasonable equivalent.
     2.7.2.3. Advise the individual of the following in the preliminary suspension notification for
     intoxicated driving:
         2.7.2.3.1. Suspension can be made a revocation under the authority of paragraph 2.5.2. of this
         AFI.
         2.7.2.3.2. The right to request restoration of driving privileges pending investigation or reso-
         lution of the incident (direct request letters to the installation commander or designee).
         2.7.2.3.2. (66ABW) Direct “Restoration of Driving Privilege Request” letters through the 66
         SFS/CC to the 66 MSG/CC.
             2.7.2.3.2.1. (Added-66ABW) Reinstatement of an individual’s base driving privileges
             following a revocation or suspension enacted as a result of non-moving violations is auto-
             matic. Reinstatement of an individual’s base driving privileges for moving violations is not
             automatic. In this case, an individual seeking reinstatement must submit a written request
             endorsed by their unit commander (military), supervisor (civilian) or military sponsor
             (dependents) through the 66 SFS/CC to the 66 MSG/CC. If the revocation or suspension
             was issued due to alcohol or drug use, the reinstatement request must also be routed
             through the 66th Medical Group Family Advocacy Counseling and Prevention (66 MDG/
             SGOFH) office. Additionally, individuals must complete the Defensive Driving Course
             identified in paragraph 2.7.1.
         2.7.2.3.3. The right of military personnel to present evidence and witnesses and be repre-
         sented by a civilian counsel (at their own expense) or assigned military counsel. Commanders
         determine the availability of specific (by name) military counsel requests.
         2.7.2.3.4. The right of DoD civilian employees to have a personal representative present at the
         administrative hearing in accordance with applicable laws and instructions.
         2.7.2.3.5. Amount of time the individual has to respond and request the administrative hearing
         before the preliminary suspension or revocation becomes permanent.
14                                                              AFI31-204_66ABWSUP_I 28 MAY 2008


            2.7.2.3.6. Direction to sign the acknowledgment of receipt and to return the signed letter to
            the address shown in the letter.
            2.7.2.3.7. Requested hearings must take place within a reasonable period which is determined
            by the installation commander. A preliminary suspension for intoxicated driving remains in
            effect until the installation commander makes a final decision. However, if no decision is
            made within 30 days of the preliminary suspension or revocation, restore full driving privi-
            leges until the accused is notified of the final hearing results.
     2.7.3. Hearings for intoxicated driving will cover only the pertinent issues of whether: 1) The law
     enforcement official had reasonable grounds to believe the person was driving or was in physical con-
     trol of a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or other drugs; 2) The person was lawfully
     cited or apprehended for an intoxicated driving offense; 3) The person was asked to submit to a test for
     alcohol or other drug content of blood, breath, or urine and was informed of the consequences for
     refusing to take or complete such a test; 4) The person refused to submit to the test for alcohol, breath,
     or urine; failed to complete the test; submitted to the test and the result exceeded the amount of
     allowed blood alcohol content; results indicate the presence of other drugs for an on-installation
     apprehension or in violation of state laws for an off-installation apprehension; and 5) The testing
     methods used were valid and reliable, and the results accurately recorded and evaluated.
        2.7.3.1. For revocation actions under paragraph 2.5.2.1. for intoxicated driving, the revocation is
        mandatory on conviction or other findings that confirm the charge.
            2.7.3.1.1. The date of conviction or other findings that confirm the charge is the effective date
            of the revocation.
            2.7.3.1.2. You may place the notice that revocation is automatic in the suspension letter, or
            send a separate letter. Revocation is not effective until receipt of the written notice, or the
            showing that you made reasonable attempts to notify the individual.
            2.7.3.1.3. Revocations cancel any partial or restricted driving privileges previously granted.
            Once revocation is acknowledged, a person may petition for the restoration of all or partial
            driving privileges.

2.8. Alcohol and Drug Abuse Programs.
     2.8.1. Refer military personnel involved in any intoxicated (drug or alcohol) motor vehicle incident to
     Substance Abuse Office, Drug and Alcohol Control for evaluation.

2.9. Restoration of Driving Privileges on Acquittal. When an official report or finding determines
lack of guilt (not guilty) or when charges are dismissed or reduced to an offense not amounting to intoxi-
cated driving, vacate the suspension of driving privileges except when:
     2.9.1. The preliminary suspension was based on refusal to take a BAC test.
     2.9.2. Operating a motor vehicle with a BAC of 0.10 percent by volume or higher or in violation of
     the law of the jurisdiction that is bring assimilated on the military installation.
     2.9.3. The person was driving or in physical control of a motor vehicle while under another prelimi-
     nary suspension or revocation.
AFI31-204_66ABWSUP_I 28 MAY 2008                                                                         15


   2.9.4. The state or host nation authorities made an administrative determination to suspend or revoke
   driving privileges based on local law or pertinent regulations.
   2.9.5. The individual failed to complete a formally directed substance abuse or driver’s training pro-
   gram.

2.10. Restricted Driving Privileges or Probation.
   2.10.1. Unless prohibited by higher authority, host nation authority, or other publication, installation
   commanders may authorize partial or restricted driving privileges to those whose authority to drive on
   military installations was suspended or revocated by a military service authority. Ensure the individ-
   ual’s driving credentials (civilian state, international, host nation, etc.) are still valid.
   2.10.1. (66ABW) Personnel who have had their privileges to operate POVs suspended or revoked
   also lose privileges to operate GOVs.
   2.10.2. Without due cause, do not grant restricted driving privileges, probation, or reinstatement to
   any person whose civilian driver’s license is under suspension or revocation by a state, federal, or host
   nation licensing authority. If absolutely necessary to do so (and for on base privileges only), coordi-
   nate with the installation staff judge advocate. Note: This option applies only to installations exercis-
   ing exclusive military jurisdiction. Outline procedures for applying for partial or restricted privileges
   in the base supplement to this AFI or in another appropriate publication. Only consider requests in
   which there is extreme hardship and there are no other workable alternatives. Do not consider the
   granting of limited privileges as an alternative to administrative discharge action when discharge is
   the more appropriate action. Installation commanders must weigh heavily the potential liability
   inherent when an individual with a suspended or revoked state, host nation, or other license is
   allowed to operate a motor vehicle on the installation. Administrative separation may be appropri-
   ate when the loss of driving privileges renders someone ineffective and incapable of performing their
   military duties, and a change in duty position is not reasonable.

2.11. Extensions of Suspensions and Revocations.
   2.11.1. Increase by two years the suspension or revocation period when someone is discovered driv-
   ing in violation of their original suspension or revocation. The unit or installation commander may
   also take administrative or disciplinary action.
   2.11.2. Extend the suspension or revocation of installation driving privileges until the offender com-
   pletes an approved remedial driver training course, drug or alcohol program, or other program deemed
   necessary by the installation commander or local authorities.
   2.11.2. (66ABW) With the exception of the drug and alcohol program administered by 66 MDG/
   SGOFH, unit commanders of military personnel and supervisors of civilian personnel determine
   appropriate program requirements necessary to complete prior to seeking reinstatement of base driv-
   ing privileges.

2.12. Reciprocal State-Military Action.
   2.12.1. Statutory authority may exist within some host nations or states for reciprocal suspension and
   revocation of driving privileges. If so, the installation commander should honor the reciprocal agree-
   ments with the state or host nation driver licensing authorities. On receipt of written notice, the
16                                                            AFI31-204_66ABWSUP_I 28 MAY 2008


     receiving party may suspend or revoke driving privileges as if the violations or incidents occurred
     within its own jurisdiction.
        2.12.1.1. Use the following procedures if statutory authority does not provide for formal military
        reciprocity:
            2.12.1.1.1. When such authority suspends or revokes a license, automatically terminate the
            individual’s installation GOV and POV driving privileges. Take only comparable military
            administrative actions (suspensions, revocation, or point assessment) for those off-base viola-
            tions reported by local, state, or host nation authorities.
            2.12.1.1.2. In the CONUS, notify the licensing authority of the state where a license is issued
            when revoking a person’s installation driving privileges (for a period of one year or more only)
            following final adjudication of an intoxicated driving offense or for refusal to submit to a
            BAC/BrAC test. Include in the notification the basis for the revocation and the BAC/BrAC
            level.
            2.12.1.1.2. (66ABW) 66 SFS/S5R will notify the licensing authority of the state where a
            license is issued when revoking a person’s installation driving privileges (for a period of one
            year or more only) following final adjudication of an on- or off-base intoxicated driving
            offense or for refusal to submit to a BAC/BrAC test. Include in the notification the basis for
            the revocation and the BAC/BrAC level.
     2.12.2. Provisions of the applicable status of forces agreement (SOFA) and the law of the host nation
     concerning reciprocal suspension and revocation can affect OCONUS installation commanders.
     When permitted at a particular overseas installation and to the extent an agreement concerning reci-
     procity exists, the installation commander must have prior authorization to negotiate and conclude
     such an international agreement in accordance with applicable directives.
2.13. (Added-66ABW) Reinstatement and Restriction of Driving Privileges.
     2.13.1. (Added-66ABW) Reinstatement of base driving privileges applies to operation of GOVs
     only. Any request for reinstatement must be in writing, justified as mission essential and submitted by
     the subject individual’s commander or equivalent.
     2.13.2. (Added-66ABW) Restriction of base driving privileges applies to operation of POVs only.
     Any request for restricted privileges must be submitted in writing by the subject individual and be
     endorsed by their commander or equivalent.
     2.13.3. (Added-66ABW) Requests for reinstatement or restriction of base driving privileges may be
     submitted at the time of the administrative due process hearing or at any other time. Requests must be
     addressed to the 66 MSG/CC through 66 SFS/S5R.
     2.13.4. (Added-66ABW) Individuals with suspended or revoked base driving privileges are not
     allowed to enter the base driving a vehicle or to park anywhere on the installation.
AFI31-204_66ABWSUP_I 28 MAY 2008                                                                          17

                PRIVATELY OWNED VEHICLE OPERATION REQUIREMENTS

3.1. General. The installation commander is responsible for ensuring all vehicles entering their installa-
tion are controlled. Installation commanders may extend or deny the privilege of operating a motor vehi-
cle on the installation to anyone they deem appropriate.
   3.1.1. (Added-66ABW) Per the AFMC/CC memo, dated 11 Sep 07, privately owned vehicles no
   longer require a DD Form 2220, Department of Defense Vehicle Registration Decal.
       3.1.1.1. (Added-66ABW) For short-term contracts of less than 90 calendar days, long-term con-
       tracts where the contractor will only have occasional visits to the installation or where a contractor
       does not work in government-provided office space, the contractor can receive a vendor’s pass
       (AF Form 75, Visitor’s Pass). The signatory will be responsible for sending the required informa-
       tion to the Visitor Center and shall be responsible for verifying the validity of the information pro-
       vided by the contractor.
   3.1.2. (Added-66ABW) Off-road vehicles (ORVs), with the exception of government vehicles, are
   not allowed to be driven on Hanscom AFB.

   CG-4801, US Coast Guard Registered Vehicle Decal, shall be allowed entry onto the base.
   3.1.4. (Added-66ABW) To obtain an AF Form 75, the individual must either be sponsored by a mil-
   itary member assigned to Hanscom AFB or be sponsored by an organization, e.g., 66th Services
   Squadron (66 SVS) sponsoring summer hires. The AF Form 75 is issued on a temporary basis not to
   exceed one year.
           3.1.4.1.(Added-66ABW) Prior to being issued an AF Form 75, the individual must possess
           and present a valid state driver’s license, valid state vehicle registration and valid proof of
           insurance. If the vehicle is a motorcycle, the operator must show proof of completing an
           approved motorcycle safety course (if applicable per paragraph A3.7.1.2. (Added)).
           3.1.4.2. (Added-66ABW) Expired AF Forms 75 are not required to be returned to the 66 SFS.
           3.1.4.3. (Added-66ABW) Further guidance on issuance of the AF Form 75 can be found in
           66 ABWI 31-101.

3.2. Driver and Vehicle Requirements. All operators of privately owned vehicles on Air Force installa-
tions will possess the following:
3.2. (66ABW) Vehicles may not be operated on Hanscom AFB unless they bear a valid state registration.
All vehicles operated or parked on base roads or in base parking lots must equal or exceed the insurance
requirements prescribed by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and must meet the safety inspection
requirements imposed by the state their vehicle is registered in. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts
requires insurance for those individuals who work in Massachusetts or spend at least 30 days per year in
Massachusetts. Overseas military registrations and registration plates are valid in the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts and at Hanscom AFB for 30 days after a vehicle’s date of arrival. All operators must have
in their possession a valid state or international driver’s license. They may also utilize a valid driver’s
18                                                               AFI31-204_66ABWSUP_I 28 MAY 2008


license from any country identified in Massachusetts General Law, Chapter 90. International and other
country driver’s licenses are valid for no more than one year.
     3.2.1. A valid state, overseas command, host nation or international driver’s license (within appropri-
     ate classification), supported by identification authorizing base entry.
     3.2.2. A certificate of state registration as required by the state in which the vehicle is registered.
     3.2.3. Proof of compliance with the minimum requirements of the automobile insurance laws or reg-
     ulations of the state, host nation, or command.
     3.2.4. Proof of compliance with safety and emissions inspection for the state or local jurisdiction in

     3.2.5. Proof of compliance with local vehicle emission inspection if required by the State, and main-
     tenance requirements.

3.3. Motorcycles, Motor Scooters, and Mopeds. See AFI 91-207, The US Air Force Traffic Safety Pro-
gram, for safety course requirements to operate motorcycles, motor scooters, and mopeds on AF installa-
tions.

3.4. Rental Vehicles. Rental vehicles will be treated as government vehicles when being used for official
business by military or DOD personnel. For base entry, driver identification will be checked and if all is
in order, the vehicle may proceed in the same manner as a marked government vehicle.

3.5. AF Form 75, Visitor/Vehicle Pass. The AF Form 75 is one method to control and identify person-
nel and vehicles on a temporary basis. It is issued to installation visitors who do not have the authorized
credentials needed for unescorted or unchecked entry to the base. Installation commanders determine the
use of AF Forms 75 on their installation and, if used, to what degree and to whom issued. Issue other
access credentials when a pass is needed for longer than one year. Installation commanders determine if
and how to retrieve passes once the visit is finished.

3.6. Handicapped Person Identification. Honor local and state-issued handicap decals, placards, signs,
etc. on all Air Force installations. The installation commander may authorize issue of a locally devised
card or form, which should contain an issue and expiration date. Issue and display per local procedure.

                                                Chapter 4

                                TRAFFIC PLANNING AND CODES

4.1. Traffic Planning
   4.1.1. Safe and efficient movement of traffic on an installation requires traffic supervision. A strong
   traffic supervision program includes sound traffic circulation planning, supervision, and control of
   motor vehicle traffic. Proactive publication and enforcement of traffic laws and regulations together
   with timely and professional investigation of motor vehicle accidents are also important. Finally,
   every successful program must include meaningful interaction, education, and communication with
   the general public.
   4.1.2. Installation commanders develop traffic circulation plans that provide for the safest and most
   efficient use of primary and secondary roads. A major focus of installation traffic planning is circula-
   tion control. The base traffic engineer, CSP, safety officer, and other concerned staff agencies develop
   the traffic circulation plan. Consult with highway engineering representatives from adjacent civilian
   communities to ensure the installation plan is compatible with plans developed by the state and sur-
   rounding local communities. As a minimum, your base traffic plan should consider the following:
      4.1.2.1. Normal and peak load routing based on traffic control studies.
      4.1.2.2. Effective control of traffic, using planned traffic flow patterns which include measures
      for special events and adverse road conditions.
      4.1.2.2. (66ABW) Air Show Traffic Plan - Traffic Advisory Council. Hanscom AFB has two
      main gates that directly correlate to the primary roads, Barksdale Street and Vandenberg Drive, for
      traffic flow. During day-to-day operations and special events, these two roadways are extensively
      used to facilitate the expeditious movement of traffic both on and off the installation. The Marrett
      Street Gate will be opened to facilitate traffic off the installation and to serve as the primary emer-
      gency response gate. Secondary roads, such as Eglin Street, Bestic Drive, Chennault Street and
      Grenier Street, help facilitate access to parking lots and facilities on the installation. During peak
      traffic hours, two lanes of traffic flow will be available on the installation at the Vandenberg and
      Hartwell Gates. The Wood Street Gate will be made available by MIT/LL Security Personnel to
      improve the flow of traffic.
      4.1.2.3. Point control at congested locations by law enforcement personnel or designated traffic
      directors or wardens, including trained school-crossing guards.
      4.1.2.4. Use of traffic control signs and devices.
      4.1.2.4. (66ABW) Traffic control signs have been installed where needed to properly and safely
      control traffic. All base traffic lights are designed with motion detectors to maximize traffic flow
      while minimizing waiting periods for lights to change. Mobile speed carts are utilized at specific
      locations to make motorists more aware of their speed.
      4.1.2.5. Efficient use of available parking facilities.
      4.1.2.6. Efficient use of mass transportation.
      4.1.2.7. Every installation commander should appoint a primary and alternate base traffic engi-
      neer. The engineer directs, develops, and staffs the base traffic circulation plan. This is normally
20                                                              AFI31-204_66ABWSUP_I 28 MAY 2008


        a civil engineering responsibility and those considered for the position should have an infrastruc-
        ture planning and engineering background.
     4.1.3. Traffic control studies provide factual data on existing roads, traffic density and flow patterns,
     and points of congestion. The CSP and traffic engineer usually conduct coordinated traffic control
     studies to obtain the data. Accurate data helps determine major and minor routes, locations for traffic
     control devices, and special conditions requiring engineering or enforcement services.
     4.1.4. The Military Traffic Management Command Transportation Engineering Agency (MTMC-
     TEA) will help installation commanders solve complex highway traffic engineering problems. MTM-
     CTEA traffic engineering team services include:
        4.1.4.1. Traffic studies of lifted areas and other special situations.
        4.1.4.2. Complete studies of traffic operations of entire installations.
        4.1.4.3. Assistance in complying with established traffic engineering standards.
     4.1.5. Installation commanders submit requests for MTMCTEA assistance in accordance with AFR
     75-88, Highways for National Defense.

4.2. Installation Traffic Codes.
     4.2.1. Installation commanders must establish a traffic code for operation of motor vehicles on the
     installation. Commanders in overseas areas establish a traffic code to the extent military authority is
     empowered to regulate traffic under applicable treaties or agreements. Installation traffic codes must
     contain the base rules of the road and will, to the degree possible, conform to the code of the state or
     host nation in which the installation is located. The CSP is responsible for developing the traffic code
     and for ensuring it meets all local and legal requirements, this AFI, and the standards published in the
     following:
     4.2.1. (66ABW) The Handbook of Massachusetts Motor Vehicle Laws and its accompanying rules,
     regulations and amendments will apply at Hanscom AFB and in all facilities under control of the
     installation commander unless otherwise noted in this supplement. In addition, Attachment 3
     (Added), entitled Hanscom Air Force Base “Rules of the Road,” contains the traffic codes established
     for Hanscom AFB and areas under the control of the installation commander.
        4.2.1.1. The National Highway Safety Program Standards, as published in 23, CFR 1230.
        4.2.1.2. Applicable portions of the Uniform Vehicle Code and Model Traffic Ordinance published
        by the National Committee on Uniform Traffic Laws and Ordinances, which is contained in 23,
        CFR 1204.
        4.2.1.3. DoDI 6055.4, DoD Traffic Safety Program.
     4.2.2. The installation traffic code must contain policy and procedures for the towing, searching,
     impounding, and inventorying of vehicles. Publish these provisions and ensure they contain the fol-
     lowing:
        4.2.2.1. Violations and conditions to tow or impound a vehicle.
        4.2.2.2. Procedures to notify the vehicle owner.
        4.2.2.3. Procedures for towing, storing, and protecting impounded vehicles.
AFI31-204_66ABWSUP_I 28 MAY 2008                                                                      21


     4.2.2.4. Procedures for disposing of vehicles after lawful impoundment.
  4.2.3. Where applicable, installation traffic codes must supplement the various basic provisions con-
  tained in the subparagraphs below:
  4.2.3. (66ABW) Midget motor vehicles, go-carts, snowmobiles, motorized scooters, mechanical
  carts, all-terrain vehicles or dirt bikes may not be operated on Hanscom AFB or in areas under the
  jurisdictional control of the Installation Commander. 66 MSG/CC reviews all requests for exceptions;
  however, only written requests for controlled or special events are considered.
     4.2.3.1. Motorcycles and mopeds. Operators must comply with special requirements when driv-
     ing motorcycles, mopeds, or other open two-, three-, and four-wheel vehicles powered by a motor-
     cycle-type engine. See paragraph 4.2.6. for information concerning off-road vehicle use.
     Installations should adopt local, state, or host nation guidance concerning the legal definition,
     operation, use, and control of mopeds, motorized bicycles, and other such devices on installation
     roadways. Such guidelines will be modified or restricted as necessary to ensure personal safety or
     the safe and orderly flow of installation traffic. Refer to AFI 91-207 for helmet, eye, and clothing
     safety requirements.
     4.2.3.1. (66ABW) See Attachment 3 (Added), Hanscom Air Force Base Rules of the Road, for
     basic rules concerning motorcycles and mopeds.
     4.2.3.2. Restraint systems.
         4.2.3.2.1. Operators and passengers of all vehicles operated on Air Force installations must
         wear restraint systems. In addition, operators and passengers of GOVs must wear restraint
         systems when driving or riding off the installation as well.
         4.2.3.2.2. All Air Force active duty and reserve component members on active duty must
         wear restraint systems while driving or riding in a POV whether on or off the installation.
         4.2.3.2.3. US Department of Transportation requires approved infant/child restraint devices in
         POVs for children 4 years old or under and not exceeding 50 pounds in weight.
         4.2.3.2.3. (66ABW) Massachusetts Motor Vehicle Law requires infants and small children
         who are under five years old and weigh less than 40 pounds to ride in correctly installed feder-
         ally approved child passenger seats. Children who are under five years old but weigh more
         than 40 pounds must ride in a belt positioning booster seat. Children who are five years old or
         older, and who weigh more than 40 pounds but are less than four feet nine inches (4’9”) tall
         should continue to ride in a belt positioning booster seat until they are over 4’9” tall. Massa-
         chusetts Law requires all passengers in moving vehicles to wear seatbelts.
         4.2.3.2.4. Cars manufactured after model year 1966 require a manufacturer-approved restraint
         system meeting federal traffic safety standards.
         4.2.3.2.4. (66ABW) Base Safety (66 ABW/SE) and 66 SFS are authorized to conduct seat-
         belt-usage checkpoints, and violators may be cited.
         4.2.3.2.5. Operators using vehicles equipped with air bags must still wear the manufacturer's
         primary restraint system (seat belts).
     4.2.3.3. Headphones and earphones. The wearing of headphones and earphones is prohibited
     while driving a motor vehicle on base. This does not negate wearing of hearing protection when
22                                                             AFI31-204_66ABWSUP_I 28 MAY 2008


        conditions and good judgment dictate its use such as when driving in noise hazard areas. This
        restriction does not apply to intercom systems worn by motorcycle operators and their passengers.
     4.2.4. Take only administrative actions (reprimand, assessment of points, loss of installation driving
     privileges, etc.) for off-installation violations of the installation traffic code.
     4.2.5. At bases with concurrent or exclusive federal jurisdiction, make violations of state traffic codes
     applicable to base driving records when those violations are included in that state’s criminal offense
     code. This provision is covered under the authority of Title 18 United States Code 13 (USC).
        4.2.5.1. DoDD 5525.4, Enforcement of State Traffic Laws on DoD Installations, adopts the vehic-
        ular and pedestrian traffic laws of states where traffic law violations are not considered criminal
        offenses and cannot be assimilated under 18 USC. It makes these laws applicable to military
        installations having concurrent or exclusive federal jurisdiction. It also delegates authority to
        installation commanders to establish additional vehicular and pedestrian traffic rules and regula-
        tions for their installations. Those found guilty of violating traffic laws made applicable on instal-
        lations under provisions of DoDD 5525.4 are subject to a fine of not more than $50 or
        imprisonment for not more than 30 days or both for each violation. In those states where you can-
        not assimilate traffic laws, post an extracted copy of this paragraph and a copy of DoDD 5525.4 in
        a prominent place accessible to persons assigned, living, or working on the installation.
            4.2.5.1.1. Take only administrative actions in states where you cannot assimilate violations of
            traffic laws under either Title 18 USC 13 or DoDD 5525.4. Generally, this applies to installa-
            tions under part or full proprietary jurisdiction.
     4.2.6. Off-road vehicles usage: The installation commander or his or her designee determines if,
     when, and where off-road vehicles may be operated on base. In many areas, the operation of off-road
     vehicles is unregulated while other jurisdictions have strict requirements concerning age, safety train-
     ing, and vehicle equipment. Generally, some "on-street" safety practices such as reflective vests,
     gloves, headlight on, and goggles may not apply when operating off road in a recreational capacity.
     However, ensure full compliance with local, state, or host nation requirements. When necessary,
     develop additional procedures and guidance locally and publish in the installation traffic safety plan or
     supplement to this instruction. Ensure environmental considerations are reviewed prior to designating
     any off-road vehicle use area.
     4.2.6. (66ABW) Off-road operation of GOVs on- or off-base is permitted for official business, pro-
     vided there are no safety or environmental restrictions imposed on the area to be used. See paragraph
     4.2.3. for prohibited vehicles.

4.3. Traffic Law Enforcement Principles.
     4.3.1. Traffic law enforcement should motivate drivers to operate vehicles safely within traffic laws
     and regulations and maintain an effective and efficient flow of traffic. Effective enforcement should
     emphasize selective enforcement and voluntary compliance by drivers. You can reach these goals by
     developing effective programs in the following areas.
        4.3.1.1. Publishing a realistic traffic code well known by all personnel.
        4.3.1.2. Adopting standard signs, markings, and signals in accordance with National Highway
        Safety Program Standards (NHSPS) and the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for
        Streets and Highways.
AFI31-204_66ABWSUP_I 28 MAY 2008                                                                        23


      4.3.1.3. Ensuring enforcement personnel establish courteous, personal contact with drivers, and
      act promptly when driving behavior is improper or when observing a defective vehicle in opera-
      tion.
      4.3.1.4. Maintain an aggressive program to detect and apprehend those who drive with suspended
      or revoked privileges.
      4.3.1.5. Use sound discretion and judgment in deciding when to apprehend, issue a citation, or
      warn the offender.
   4.3.2. Enforcement activities against intoxicated driving will include:
      4.3.2.1. Detecting, apprehending, and testing persons suspected of driving under the influence of
      alcohol or drugs.
      4.3.2.2. Training law enforcement personnel in special enforcement standards, detection tech-
      niques, and equipment standards unique to your location and jurisdiction.
      4.3.2.3. Enforcing blood-alcohol concentration standards (see paragraph 4.11.).
      4.3.2.4. Denying installation driving privileges to those whose use of alcohol or drugs prevents
      their safe operation of a motor vehicle.

4.4. Speed-measuring Devices. Use speed-measuring devices in traffic control studies and enforce-
ment programs. Post signs to indicate the use of speed-measuring devices.
   4.4.1. Equipment purchases. Installations located in states having a formal civilian police training
   and certification program for speed measurement should consider purchasing the same brand and
   model of equipment used by their civilian counterparts. Where possible, attend the same or similar
   certification courses used by local authorities.
   4.4.2. Training and certification standards.
      4.4.2.1. The CSP should strive to ensure operators of speed-measuring devices meet training and
      certification requirements prescribed by the state or jurisdiction where the installation is located.
      Obtain specific information on course dates, costs, and prerequisites for attending by contacting
      the state agency responsible for police traffic radar training. Notwithstanding the above informa-
      tion, the CSP may establish other local training and certification programs for operators of
      speed-measuring devices. If exercising this option, you must ensure your qualification and train-
      ing standards are admissible as evidence and considered reliable by both military and civil author-
      ities. This requirement applies to courts-martial, nonjudicial proceedings, and civilian courts used
      to prosecute civilian offenders. Coordination between the military staff judge advocate and attor-
      ney general (or equivalent) is necessary.
      4.4.2.2. Develop local training programs or attend a civilian institution or manufacturer's training
      program if security police are unable to attend local or state-sponsored radar certification courses.
      4.4.2.3. The objective of civilian or manufacturer-sponsored courses is to improve the effective-
      ness of speed enforcement through the proper and efficient use of speed-measurement radar. On
      successful completion, the course graduate must know how to:
          4.4.2.3.1. Describe the association between excessive speed and accidents, deaths, and inju-
          ries, and describe the traffic safety benefits of effective speed control.
24                                                              AFI31-204_66ABWSUP_I 28 MAY 2008


            4.4.2.3.2. Describe the basic principles of radar speed measurement.
            4.4.2.3.3. Identify and describe Air Force speed measurement and speed enforcement policy
            and procedure.
            4.4.2.3.4. Identify the specific radar instrument used and describe the instrument’s major
            components and functions.
            4.4.2.3.5. Demonstrate basic skills in calibrating and operating the specific radar instru-
            ment(s).
            4.4.2.3.6. Demonstrate basic skills in preparing and presenting records and courtroom testi-
            mony relating to radar speed measurement and enforcement.
     4.4.3. Recertification. Certify operators every three years or more frequently when required by the
     state or governing jurisdiction. The CSP must document and maintain certification and training stan-
     dards in the unit training section. Forward records to gaining unit commanders when personnel PCS.
     4.4.4. Use the following sources in local training and certification programs:
        4.4.4.1. State or local training guides, plans, and procedures.
        4.4.4.2. Publish techniques for radar speed detection and legal aspects of speed-measuring
        devices by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the International Association
        of Directors of Law Enforcement Standards and Training.

4.5. Traffic Accident Investigation.
     4.5.1. Conduct detailed investigations of the following:
        4.5.1.1. All accidents involving a fatality or personal injury.
        4.5.1.2. Vehicle and private property damage over the amount specified by the installation com-
        mander. This applies to government as well as private vehicles and property damage; however,
        the installation commander may establish different damage amounts for each category.
        4.5.1.2. (66ABW) Detailed investigations will be conducted for vehicle and/or property damage
        over $10,000.
     4.5.2. Conduct investigations of off-installation accidents involving military personnel according to
     local policy developed by the CSP and local police leaders.
NOTE: Generally, a detailed accident investigation includes, but is not limited to, an accident report
form, field sketch, scale diagram, and accident narrative.
     4.5.2. (66ABW) 66 SFS will not conduct investigations of off-base accidents.

4.6. Traffic Accident Investigation Reports.
     4.6.1. Anyone involved in an on-base vehicle accident must immediately report the incident to the
     security police. Report off-base accidents to the security police if they involve injuries to military per-
     sonnel or damage to military property. The installation commander determines what agencies to notify
     and for what type of accidents to notify them. The CSP must develop a local notification matrix or
     other procedures that will ensure notification of appropriate base and civilian agencies. Develop and
     publish these notification procedures locally.
AFI31-204_66ABWSUP_I 28 MAY 2008                                                                        25


  4.6.1. (66ABW) 66 SFS will investigate major accidents at the scene and notify the Logistics Readi-
  ness Division (66 MSG/LRD) if the accident involves a GOV or if wreckage must be removed from
  the scene, and will notify 66 ABW/SE and/or the ESC/JAB if the accident results in a claim for or
  against the government.
  4.6.2. The security police will act as the focal point for gathering off-base accident information.
  Record the information in the security police desk blotter. When possible, obtain copies of major
  accident reports prepared by investigating civilian police agencies.
  4.6.3. Security police respond to all on-base major vehicle accidents (unless local conditions or poli-
  cies prohibit) to accomplish the following:
     4.6.3.1. Render first aid and arrange for medical assistance.
     4.6.3.2. Protect personal property.
     4.6.3.3. Normalize traffic.
     4.6.3.4. Identify witnesses and personnel involved.
     4.6.3.5. Conduct a formal investigation.
     4.6.3.5. (66ABW) 66 SFS will document the investigation on the AF Form 1315, Accident
     Report.
     4.6.3.6. The CSP determines (with installation commander approval) when and/or if minor vehi-
     cle accidents require investigation or a police response. He or she may delegate this authority to
     on-duty security police supervisory personnel. Develop policy in this area locally.
     4.6.3.6. (66ABW) On Hanscom AFB, minor vehicle accidents require a Security Forces response
     only and do not need to be investigated. For those minor accidents where a blatant violation of
     motor vehicle law is evident, e.g. improper backing, illegal turn, etc., the offender will be issued a
     DD Form 1805, United States District Court Violation Notice, for civilian personnel, or a DD
     Form 1408, Armed Forces Traffic Ticket, for military personnel.
  4.6.4. Report minor accidents not involving a security police response to the security police within 72
  hours. Record accident information in the security police blotter. This information should include the
  accident type, time and date, location, name(s) of vehicle operator(s), unit (or address when civilian
  not affiliated with military), vehicle description, and license number(s). You should also include a
  brief summary of any damage and circumstances behind or causing the accident. A minor accident is
  any accident in which there are no fatalities/injuries or vehicle/property damage above the amount
  established by the installation commander. Consequently, a major accident is any accident involving
  a fatality, injury, or property damage above the amount established by the installation commander.
  The installation commander may set differing amounts for government versus private vehicle and
  property damage. The investigation of major accidents involve specialized accident investigative
  techniques to draw conclusions and opinions about how and why the accident occurred.
  4.6.4. (66ABW) Minor vehicle accidents will be documented on the AFMC Form 625, Minor Vehicle
  Accident Worksheet; AF Form 1168, Statement of Suspect/Witness/Complainant; and in the Security
  Forces blotter.
     4.6.4.1. Injury is defined as any one of the following caused or aggravated by a motor vehicle
     accident:
26                                                             AFI31-204_66ABWSUP_I 28 MAY 2008


            4.6.4.1.1. Any condition requiring medical attention
            4.6.4.1.2. Complaint or report of pain or injury regardless if medical attention is sought
            4.6.4.1.3. Any visible injury. This includes bruises, contusions, cuts, scrapes, compression, or
            any other visible damage to the body.

4.7. Use of Traffic Accident Investigation Report Data.
     4.7.1. Analyze data derived from traffic accident investigations to determine accident causes. When
     frequent accidents occur in one area, analyze location conditions, type of accidents, and other factors
     in an attempt to isolate causes. With the exception of privacy act information, make accident data and
     trend analysis available to agencies requesting the data for reporting and analytical purposes. With the
     exception of requests filed under the Freedom of Information Act, the CSP determines the agencies
     cleared to receive accident and incident data.
     4.7.1. (66ABW) 66 SFS/S5R will analyze data on a monthly basis and report the information to all
     authorized requesting agencies by the 5th day of the first month of every quarter.
     4.7.2. Law enforcement personnel and others who prepare traffic accident investigation reports will
     indicate if a seat restraint was used at the time of the accident, and where applicable, if air bags
     deployed.

4.8. Parking.
     4.8.1. Illegal parking contributes to congestion and slows traffic flow on the installation. Strong
     enforcement of parking rules results in better use of available parking while reducing traffic accidents
     and hazards. Combine enforcement with community education and awareness initiatives in areas
     where illegal parking is a problem. When education and awareness fail, installation commanders may
     authorize more serious enforcement measures such as towing and "booting" of vehicles. Do not use
     towing and booting if less severe means of enforcement such as warnings, ticketing, reprimands, revo-
     cations, etc., prove effective. When using towing and booting, follow the guidelines below:
     4.8.1. (66ABW) See Attachment 3 (Added) to this supplement for the parking rules and regulations
     that apply at Hanscom AFB and areas under the control of the installation commander.
        4.8.1.1. Publish operating instructions to control discretion of enforcers and limit towing or boot-
        ing to specific offenses.
        4.8.1.2. Focus on specific reasons for towing or booting. Booting is effective for immobilizing
        unsafe vehicles, or vehicles not inspected or registered. Use booting in high offense areas or to
        compel the presence of repeat offenders. Towing is more effective for moving vehicles that pose
        safety hazards. Some examples include double parking, and blocking fire hydrants and fire lanes.
        4.8.1.3. Notify drivers that certain violations or multiple violations may result in towing or boot-
        ing. Also, provide drivers a prompt opportunity to obtain release of their property.
        4.8.1.4. Warn drivers when a boot is attached to their vehicle and instruct them on how to have the
        boot removed without damaging the vehicle.
     4.8.2. Reserved Parking. When not addressed by MAJCOMs, installation commanders determine
     reserved parking policy for their installations. Number of available spaces, facility design and layout,
     traffic flow, and number of vehicles using facilities will help determine the number and location of
AFI31-204_66ABWSUP_I 28 MAY 2008                                                                          27


  reserved parking spaces. Make policy and procedures governing reserved parking a part of the instal-
  lation supplement to this instruction, separate traffic control instruction, or base parking plan. The
  publication must address approval, issue, control, and review of reserved parking and should give spe-
  cial consideration to bicycle, motorcycle, visitor, and car pool parking. Handicap parking is regulated
  under the uniform federal accessibility standards and applies to all Air Force installations.
  4.8.2. (66ABW) Parking is extremely limited on Hanscom AFB, with the number of registered vehi-
  cles increasing each year without a corresponding increase in parking spaces. To reduce the expense
  of construction and repair of signs, and to provide Hanscom AFB with a cleaner, less cluttered look,
  this instruction limits the number of reserved parking signs.
     4.8.2.1. (Added-66ABW) General. Reserved (preferred) parking spaces will be established in
     lots where parking is limited and premium parking is identifiable. Spaces will be located at the
     discretion of the ranking organization located in the particular building and assigned as outlined
     below in the listed priority order. The installation commander or his designee will have final
     authority to determine what type of spaces will be located at a particular building. All references
     to unit commander should be considered to include unit directors.
         4.8.2.1.1. (Added-66ABW) All accessible parking lots shall provide handicapped spaces
         complying with 28 CFR, Part 36, Appendix A.
         4.8.2.1.2. (Added-66ABW) Entryway parking spaces that are reserved for government vehi-
         cles that are designated for “Official Use Only.”
         4.8.2.1.3. (Added-66ABW) Visitor/Customer parking will be considered “timed parking”
         and will be provided at all facilities with a customer service function that have a high turnover
         of patrons. Parking at these facilities will be limited to visitors/customers only and restricted to
         no more than three hours.
         4.8.2.1.4. (Added-66ABW) Car/Van Pool Parking: Spaces reserved for personnel that partic-
         ipate in car pools consisting of two or more people. These spaces are reserved for the person
         actually operating the vehicle for the car pool.
             4.8.2.1.4.1. (Added-66ABW) Privileged parking – limited to the following:

             attachments to 66 MSG/CEKR through 66 SFS/S3 for the desired work.
             4.8.2.4.2.5. (Added-66ABW) When a need for reserved parking no longer exists, the
             Facility Manager will submit a work request through 66 SFS/S3 to 66 MSG/CEKR for
             removal of signs.
  4.8.3. You can use distinctive emblems, decals, stickers, etc., to control parking space assignments
  and to indicate authorized use of the parking slot. If this identification media is placed on a vehicle
  bumper, separate it from the vehicle registration identification. MAJCOMs (or installation command-
  ers if not addressed by the MAJCOM) may develop policy concerning the issue and control of the
  identification media discussed above.
  4.8.4. You can use parking wardens (unit personnel) to monitor and cite parking violators, especially
  within off-street parking facilities.
     4.8.4.1. (Added-66ABW) The Hanscom AFB Traffic Warden Program is administered by Police
     Services (66 SFS/S5L). Each organization assigned responsibility for parking lots or spaces will
     appoint at least one Traffic Warden. Additional Traffic Wardens may be appointed as deemed nec-
     essary by the two-letter or three-letter chief. If an organization is responsible for more than one
     parking lot, Traffic Wardens may be appointed for each lot. Where more than one organization
     uses a parking lot, each organization will appoint a Traffic Warden for its respective portion. Traf-
     fic Wardens will conduct daily checks of the parking areas they are responsible for.
     4.8.4.2. (Added-66ABW) All Traffic Warden appointments will be in writing, and a copy of the
     letter will be sent to 66 SFS/S5L. The letter will include the Traffic Warden’s name, office symbol,
     duty phone, date trained and the parking lot appointed. The letter will be updated annually or upon
     change of Traffic Wardens, whichever occurs first.

        4.8.4.3. (Added-66ABW) Primary Traffic Wardens will receive training from 66 SFS/S5L. Their
        responsibilities are to:
            4.8.4.3.1. (Added-66ABW) Control and verify the issuance of all DD Forms 1408 IAW AFI
            31-204, paragraph 4.9.3., and AFI 31-204/66 ABW Sup 1, Attachment 3 (Added), Hanscom
            Air Force Base “Rules of the Road.”
            4.8.4.3.2. (Added-66ABW) Ensure parking requirements for their parking lots are strictly
            enforced IAW AFI 31-204/66 ABW Sup 1, Attachment 3 (Added), Hanscom Air Force Base
            “Rules of the Road.”
            4.8.4.3.3. (Added-66ABW) Issue DD Form 1408 for parking violations in their assigned
            parking lots, submit the white and yellow copies to the Law Enforcement Desk within 24
            hours or the next duty day after issuance and keep track of the number and location of DD
            Form 1408 books issued. Non-primary Traffic Wardens may be delegated authority to issue
            the DD Form 1408 in their assigned parking lots and when relieved of these duties, they will
            relinquish all unused books to the primary Traffic Warden.
            4.8.4.3.4. (Added-66ABW) Issue only one citation per vehicle, per violation. For example, if
            a citation has previously been issued to a vehicle, the vehicle has not been moved and the orig-
            inal citation is still present, do not issue a subsequent citation for the same offense.
            4.8.4.3.5. (Added-66ABW) Contact the Law Enforcement Desk if confronted by an argu-
            mentative, aggressive or combative violator. Traffic Wardens will never become engaged in an
            argument with a violator.
            4.8.4.3.6. (Added-66ABW) Submit a semiannual report to 66 SFS/S5L of all assigned park-
            ing slots including a list of all reserved parking slots.
            4.8.4.3.7. (Added-66ABW) Train alternate Traffic Wardens and provide them continuing
            guidance.
            4.8.4.3.8. (Added-66ABW) Contact 66 SFS/S5L for replacement ticket books.
            4.8.4.3.9. (Added-66ABW) Post their name and duty phone number within the common
            areas or bulletin boards of their facilities so personnel within the facility will be aware of who
            the Traffic Warden is for that facility.
            4.8.4.3.10. (Added-66ABW) Make periodic reminders to the occupants of their respective
            facilities through e-mail, bulletins or Commander’s Call.

4.9. Traffic Violation Reports.
     4.9.1. Commanders should deal with most traffic violations occurring on Air Force installations
     within Air Force channels.
     4.9.2. You can refer traffic violations occurring on Air Force installations (within the United States or
     its territories) to the proper US Magistrate. Do not refer violations in the following circumstances:
        4.9.2.1. The operator is driving a government vehicle at the time of the violation.
        4.9.2.2. A US Federal Magistrate is either not available or lacks jurisdiction to hear the matter
        because the violation occurred in an area where the federal government has only proprietary legis-
        lative jurisdiction.
AFI31-204_66ABWSUP_I 28 MAY 2008                                                                         31


     4.9.2.3. Mission requirements make referral of offenders impractical.
     4.9.2.4. A US Magistrate is available, but the accused refuses to consent to the jurisdiction of the
     court and the US attorney refuses to process the case before a US district court.
  4.9.3. Issue traffic violators on military installations a DD Form 1408, Armed Forces Traffic Ticket,
  or a DD Form 1805, United States District Court Violation Notice. The CSP determines who is autho-
  rized to issue those forms and what training they must complete before issuing either form. The DD
  Form 1408 is issued to the following personnel: active duty personnel, Cadets/Midshipmen of the Mil-
  itary Academies to include the Coast Guard Academy, reservists on orders or performing inactive
  duty training including commuting to and from training, and guardsman in federal service under Title
  10 of the United States Code. Title 10 status is reflected on the guardsman’ s orders. Issue civilians the
  DD Form 1805, or the DD Form 1408 when a US Magistrate system is not available.”
  4.9.3. (66ABW) The Installation Chief, Security Forces determines who is authorized to issue the
  DD Form 1408, and the DD Form 1805, and what training they must complete before issuing either
  form. The DD Form 1408 is primarily issued to the following personnel: active duty personnel,
  Cadets/Midshipmen of the Military Academies to include the Coast Guard Academy, reservists on
  orders or performing inactive duty training including commuting to and from training and guardsmen
  in federal service under Title 10 of the United States Code. Title 10 status is reflected on the guards-
  men’s orders. The US Magistrate System is used at Hanscom AFB; however, court is held in Worces-
  ter, MA. In most cases, civilian violators will be issued the DD Form 1805.
  4.9.4. Installation commanders establish procedures for disposing of traffic violation cases through
  administrative or judicial action consistent with the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) and
  federal law. Additionally, forward a copy of all violation reports on military personnel and DoD civil-
  ian employees apprehended for intoxicated driving to the Substance Abuse Office, Drug and Alcohol
  Control.
  4.9.4. (66ABW) Unit commanders/directors of ticketed personnel decide if an individual is guilty of
  a violation indicated on the DD Form 1408 and, if so, issue out disciplinary or administrative action as
  appropriate. Military personnel are held responsible for the actions of their dependents. Commanders/
  directors are responsible for indicating the action taken by checking the appropriate block in the
  “action taken” section located on the reverse side of the original DD Form 1408 and including a brief
  synopsis of the action taken (e.g., administered counseling, oral admonishment, letter of reprimand,
  etc.) in the “remarks” section. A check mark in the “no action taken” block requires a statement
  explaining why no action was taken. 66 SFS/S5R will automatically assess points for all guilty find-
  ings. (See AFI 31-204, paragraph 2.5.1.1. and Table 5.2.).
     4.9.4.1. (Added-66ABW) Persons found guilty for a traffic offense on a DD Form 1408 may
     appeal the findings of their commander/director within seven calendar days of the decision.
     Offenders must send a written memorandum of appeal outlining why they feel the finding of
     guilty is unjustified through their commander/director to the 66 MSG/CC through the 66 SFS/CC.
     An individual will normally not be allowed to rebut a parking violation after seven calendar days
     if the individual is facing suspension of base driving privileges. In order to successfully rebut
     parking violation(s) after the seven calendar day period, the individual must be able to justify why
     they could not rebut the parking violation within the seven calendar days; for example, the indi-
     vidual was TDY during this period. The final appeal authority is the 66 MSG/CC. 66 SFS/S5R
     sends an information copy of the completed case to the appropriate commander/director.
32                                                            AFI31-204_66ABWSUP_I 28 MAY 2008


        4.9.4.2. (Added-66ABW) If a citation is issued for a major defect, i.e., one that prevents the fur-
        ther safe operation of a vehicle, on-duty Security Forces may instruct the driver to park the vehicle
        in a designated location. Drivers are then prohibited from operating the vehicle until the safety
        defect is corrected.
     4.9.5. Unless restricted under the provisions of para 4.9.2., use the DD Form 1805 to refer civilian
     violators of state and federal traffic laws to the appropriate US magistrate. Notify the commander,
     first sergeant, or supervisor when any military personnel or DoD civilian employees is cited with the
     DD Form 1805. If requested, locally reproduce a copy of the DD Form 1805 and make it available to
     the commander, first sergeant, or supervisor.
        4.9.5.1. Preparation of the DD Form 1805. This prenumbered form is issued through standard
        publication channels and is only accountable once it is issued to an offender. Before issuing this
        form, stamp (type) in black ink the specific address of the clerk of the US District Court (Central
        Violations Bureau) to which the violator must address the communication, on the reverse of the
        violator’s copy (manila card stock) of the four-part form. Determine the entry for the amount of
        the fine, mandatory court appearance of the offender, and the date of appearance according to
        guidance furnished by the governing district court.
        4.9.5.1. (66ABW) The preset collateral amount, determined locally by the US Magistrate Court,
        will be entered in Box B. If offenders wish to appear before a US magistrate, they do not send in
        the collateral amount by mail. The US Magistrate Court will inform them of their court appear-
        ance date. When a mandatory appearance violation notice is prepared, check Box A indicating the
        offender must appear in court. The box showing the court address of the clerk of the US Magis-
        trate Court for Hanscom AFB will be filled in with the appropriate address as shown below:
                U.S. District Court Clerk
                District of Massachusetts
                595 Main Street, Rm 404
                Worcester, MA 01608
        4.9.5.2. Identify the assimilation of state traffic laws by a specific state code reference in the
        CODE SECTION block of the DD Form 1805 or in a complaint filed with the US magistrate.
        4.9.5.3. Use the statement of probable cause on the DD Form 1805 according to local staff judge
        advocate and US magistrate court policy. The statement of probable cause is required by the fed-
        eral misdemeanor rules to support the issuance of a summons or arrest warrant.
        4.9.5.4. For cases referred to US magistrate, normal distribution of DD Form 1805 is as follows:
            4.9.5.4.1. The CSP forwards copy 1 (white) and copy 2 (yellow) to the US District Court
            (Central Violation Bureau).
            4.9.5.4.2. Security police file copy 3 (pink).
            4.9.5.4.3. Provide copy 4 (envelope) to the violator.
NOTE: Ensure unit personnel are notified IAW para 4.9.5. above.
        4.9.5.5. When DD Form 1408 is used, distribute the form as follows:
AFI31-204_66ABWSUP_I 28 MAY 2008                                                                       33


          4.9.5.5.1. Provide the pink copy to the violator with normal reporting instructions and rebuttal
          instructions as determined by the installation commander.
          4.9.5.5.2. Forward the white copy to the service member’s commander, to the commander of
          the family member’s sponsor, or to the civilian’s supervisor or employer for administrative
          action within the unit/organization.
          4.9.5.5.3. Forward the yellow copy to the security police administration branch for processing
          and tracking until the white "action copy" is returned by the unit commander, section com-
          mander, or first sergeant. When the white copy is received, review it for action taken, annotate
          the information in SPAS or the AF Form 1313, Driver Record, with the moving or non-mov-
          ing violation and any points assessed. File the white and yellow copies with the driver record.
   4.9.6. (Added-66ABW) Violations that warrant suspension or revocation of base driving privileges,
   in addition to those listed in AFI 31-204, are found in Attachment 4 (Added), Table A4.1. (Added)
   Driving Violations and Penalties. NOTE: Any individual who is on a suspension or revocation and is
   charged with another violation that warrants suspension or revocation is subject to the additional sus-
   pension or revocation being imposed. If imposed, the additional suspension or revocation will run
   consecutively to the term of the original suspension or revocation. Any individual charged with driv-
   ing on-base while base driving privileges are suspended or revoked is subject to revocation of an
   additional two years. The additional two years will run consecutively to the term of the original sus-
   pension or revocation.

4.10. Standards and Procedures for Processing Intoxicated Drivers.
   4.10.1. As a minimum, the CSP must train installation law enforcement personnel to do the follow-
   ing:
      4.10.1.1. Recognize signs of alcohol and other drug impairment in persons operating motor vehi-
      cles.
      4.10.1.2. Prepare DD Form 1920, Alcohol Influence Report, or other form which adequately
      documents sobriety and sobriety testing of an individual.
      4.10.1.2. (66ABW) In addition to the DD Form 1920, Alcohol Incident Report, Security Forces
      personnel will utilize their locally devised Drunken Driving Field Note Worksheet.
      4.10.1.3. Perform standard field sobriety tests. The standardized Air Force field sobriety test con-
      sists of the one leg stand, the walk and turn, and the horizontal gaze nystagmus. Also consider any
      local, state, or host nation sobriety test requirements in addition to the above standard Air Force
      tests.
      4.10.1.4. Determine to a reasonable and practical degree when a person appears intoxicated, but
      is actually physically or mentally ill and requires prompt medical attention.
      4.10.1.5. Understand the operation of breath-testing devices.
   4.10.2. Each installation using breath-testing devices will ensure operators of these devices:
      4.10.2.1. Are chosen for integrity, maturity, and sound judgment.
      4.10.2.2. Meet installation, and where possible, state certification standards.
34                                                              AFI31-204_66ABWSUP_I 28 MAY 2008


     4.10.3. Use only breath-testing devices listed on the approved NHTSA conforming products list pub-
     lished in the Federal Register. Ensure only trained personnel administer tests as specified in para-
     graph 4.13. and adhere to the procedures described in paragraphs 4.14. and 4.15. relating to voluntary
     and involuntary testing.
     4.10.3. (66ABW) Only personnel possessing a certificate of qualification from the Massachusetts
     Criminal Justice Training Counsel (MCJTC) will be allowed to administer breath tests utilizing
     Hanscom Air Force Base’s breath-testing device. 66 SFS re-certifies operators every two years as
     required by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
     4.10.4. Installations located in states or overseas areas with no formal training program will develop
     their own training program following material and guidance from selected civilian institutions or
     manufacturers of the equipment. Coordinate local training programs with the installation staff judge
     advocate and state's attorney general (or local equivalent) to ensure your program meets local require-
     ments for legal admissibility. Conduct refresher training at the intervals determined by the CSP and
     staff judge advocate.

4.11. Blood Alcohol Concentration Standards.
     4.11.1. Uniformly apply administrative revocation of driving privileges and other enforcement mea-
     sures to offenders driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs. When a person is tested per para-
     graph 2.3., evaluate the results of the test as follows:
        4.11.1.1. If the percentage of alcohol in the person’s blood is less than 0.05 percent, presume the
        person is not under the influence of alcohol.
        4.11.1.2. If the percentage is 0.05 but less than 0.10, presume the person is impaired. Consider
        this standard with other competent evidence in determining whether the person was under the
        influence of alcohol. Suspend driving privileges according to para 2.5. Note: The 0.10 threshold
        delineating impaired from intoxicated can be lesser level when assimilating a more stringent local,
        state, or host nation standard.
        4.11.1.2. (66ABW) The threshold adopted by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and
        Hanscom AFB is 0.08. If the percentage is 0.05 or greater, but less than 0.08, presume the person
        is impaired.
        4.11.1.3. If the percentage is 0.10 (or lesser amount when assimilating local, state, or host nation
        standards) or more or if tests reflect the presence of illegal drugs, the person is considered to have
        been driving under the influence of intoxicants. Suspend driving privileges according to para
        2.5.1.3.
     4.11.2. Percentages in paragraph 4.11.1. are percent of weight by volume of alcohol in the blood
     based on grams of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood. Installation commanders will modify military
     standards to agree with a more stringent state, local authority, or host nation standard. Refer to Assess-
     ment #3, Table 5.1.

4.12. Chemical Testing Policies and Procedures.
     4.12.1. Results of chemical testing are valid under this instruction only under the following circum-
     stances:
AFI31-204_66ABWSUP_I 28 MAY 2008                                                                          35


       4.12.1.1. Testing of blood, breath, urine, or other bodily substances using generally accepted sci-
       entific and medical methods and standards.
       4.12.1.2. Qualified personnel administer breath tests.
       4.12.1.3. Use of a nonportable breath-testing device approved by the state or host nation.
       4.12.1.3. (66ABW) The 66 SFS uses an Intoxilyzer brand breath-testing device certified by the
       Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
   4.12.2. If the state or host nation has not established procedures for use of breath-testing devices, then
   apply the following procedures if you use portable breath-testing devices: 1) During the initial traffic
   stop as a field sobriety testing technique in lieu of or in conjunction with other field sobriety testing
   techniques as long as the state or host nation does not prohibit such use, and 2) According to the man-
   ufacturer's operating instructions.
       4.12.2.1. Use nonportable evidentiary breath-testing devices as follows:
          4.12.2.1.1. Observe the suspected person for at least 20 minutes before collecting the breath
          specimen. During this time, the person must not drink, eat, smoke, chew tobacco, or ingest
          any substance.
          4.12.2.1.2. Verify calibration and proper operation of the instrument according to manufac-
          turer's specifications and any specific local, state, or host nation requirements.
          4.12.2.1.3. Comply with operational procedures in the manufacturer’s current instruction
          manual. Perform the preventive maintenance as required by the owner's manual.
   4.12.3. Chemical tests of personnel involved in fatal accidents.
       4.12.3.1. Installation medical authorities will immediately notify and brief the CSP upon death of
       any person involved in a motor vehicle accident. Subject to military jurisdiction, medical author-
       ities will examine anyone killed in an on-base motor vehicle accident or mishap. Conduct tests for
       the presence and concentration of alcohol or other drugs in the blood, bodily fluids, or tissues as
       soon as possible and where practical within eight hours of death. Include the test results in the
       medical reports.
       4.12.3.2. As provided by law and medical conditions permitting, obtain a blood or breath sample
       from any surviving operator whose vehicle is involved in a fatal accident.

4.13. Detection, Apprehension, and Testing of Intoxicated Drivers.
4.13. (66ABW) Specific procedures for administering the standardized field sobriety tests can be found
in Security Forces Operating Instruction 31-22, Operations.
   4.13.1. Most of the time you will detect drunk drivers by observing unusual or abnormal driving
   behavior. Stop these drivers and determine the cause of their unusual driving behavior. If you reason-
   ably conclude that the individual in control of the vehicle is impaired, perform field sobriety tests.
   The DD Form 1920 is used in examining, interpreting, and recording results of such tests. Use the
   standard field sobriety tests outlined in para 4.10. Specific procedures for administering them can be
   found in AFH 31-227, Air Force Motor Vehicle and Traffic Control. Also see AFH 31-227 for proce-
   dures and guidance concerning the use of traffic mazes, DWI checkpoints, and other drunk driving
   reduction measures.

4.14. Voluntary Breath and Bodily Fluid Testing Based on Implied Consent.
     4.14.1. Implied consent policy is explained in paragraph 2.3.
     4.14.2. Administer tests only when the following conditions are met:
        4.14.2.1. The person was lawfully stopped while driving or while in physical control of a motor
        vehicle on the installation.
        4.14.2.2. Reasonable suspicion exists to believe the person was driving under the influence of
        alcohol or drugs.
        4.14.2.3. A request was made of the person to consent and he or she was advised that failure to
        voluntarily submit to or complete a chemical test of bodily fluids or breath may result in revoca-
        tion of on-base driving privileges.
     4.14.3. The installation commander prescribes the type of chemical tests used. Advise the driver that
     the installation commander may revoke driving privileges if they fail to voluntarily submit to or com-
     plete a requested chemical test and that they do not have the right to have an attorney present before
     deciding if they will or will not take the test. Testing will follow policies and procedures in paragraph
     4.12. Also advise the driver that you can use the results of chemical tests conducted under the implied
     consent provisions of this instruction as evidence in courts-martial, nonjudicial proceedings under
     Article 15 of the UCMJ, administrative action, or civil court proceeding.
     4.14.3. (66ABW) The 66 SFS Intoxilyzer brand breath-testing device will be utilized for chemical
     testing on Hanscom AFB. If this device is inoperative, and no local civilian law enforcement agency
     device is available, a blood sample will be drawn by qualified medical personnel in lieu of breath test-
     ing.
     4.14.4. Special rules exist for persons who have hemophilia, other blood-clotting disorders, or any
     medical or surgical disorder under treatment with an anticoagulant. Such people may refuse a blood
     extraction without penalty, but you can offer a breath or urine test, or both. You must outline these
     procedures and the type of medical conditions that qualify for nonpunitive refusal in readily available
     medical guidelines located in emergency rooms or other reasonable areas where blood samples might
     be drawn from those suspected of drunk driving. Valid refusals must have the concurrence of a med-
     ical doctor.
     4.14.5. If a person suspected of intoxicated driving refuses to submit to a chemical test, do not admin-
     ister a test except as specified in paragraph 4.15.

4.15. Involuntary Extraction of Bodily Fluids in Traffic Cases.
     4.15.1. These procedures pertain only to the investigation of individuals stopped, apprehended, or
     cited on a military installation for any offense related to driving a motor vehicle and for whom proba-
     ble cause exists to believe that such individual is intoxicated. Rule 312d, Military Rules of Evidence,
     and regulatory rules concerning requesting and granting authorizations for searches govern the extrac-
     tion of body fluids in furtherance of other kinds of investigations. Air Force policy on nonconsensual
     extraction of blood samples is further addressed in AFI 44-102, Patient Care and Management of
     Clinical Services.
     4.15.2. Involuntary bodily fluid extractions (blood or urine) require valid search and seizure authori-
     zations. A person subject to the UCMJ who does not consent to chemical testing, and who subse-
AFI31-204_66ABWSUP_I 28 MAY 2008                                                                           37


   quently refuses a lawful order to surrender to the test,. may nonetheless be forced to submit to an
   involuntary extraction of bodily fluids. As a general rule, forced extractions are considered only when
   an individual is involved in an accident in which there is a death, serious personal injury, or significant
   property damage. Probable cause must exist to believe the individual was driving or was in control of
   a vehicle while under the influence of an intoxicant. Conduct the extraction in accordance with the
   following procedures: 1) A search authorization by an appropriate commander or military magistrate
   obtained pursuant to Rule 315, Military Rules of Evidence, is required prior to such nonconsensual
   extraction; 2) A search authorization is not required under such circumstances when there is a clear
   indication that one will find evidence of intoxication and there is reason to believe that the delay nec-
   essary to obtain a search authorization would result in the loss or destruction of the evidence sought;
   and 3) Conduct warrantless searches only after coordination with the servicing staff judge advocate
   and attempts to gain authorization from an appropriate official fail because of the unavailability of the
   appropriate commander or military magistrate.
      4.15.2.1. If authorization from the military magistrate or commander proves unsuccessful (due to
      nonavailability), the commander of a medical facility is empowered by Rule 315(d), Military
      Rules of Evidence, to authorize such extraction from an individual located in the facility at the
      time an authorization is sought.
          4.15.2.1.1. Before authorizing the involuntary extraction, the commander of the medical facil-
          ity should, if circumstances permit, coordinate with the servicing staff judge advocate.
          4.15.2.1.2. The medical facility commander authorizing an extraction under Rule 315(d) need
          not be on duty as the attending physician. Any qualified medical person can perform the
          extraction.
          4.15.2.1.3. The authorizing official may consider his or her own observations of the individ-
          ual in determining probable cause.
   4.15.3. Authorization for the nonconsensual extraction of blood samples for evidentiary purposes by
   qualified medical personnel is independent of and not limited by provisions defining medical care,
   such as the provision for nonconsensual medical care pursuant to AFR 160-12. Only qualified medi-
   cal personnel administer extractions and use only reasonable measures to accomplish the procedure.
   Assistance to overcome an individual’s resistance to the extraction is normally provided by law
   enforcement personnel or unit personnel acting under orders from the member’s commanding officer
   or designee. Do not use any form of life endangering force to effect nonconsensual extractions.
      4.15.3.1. Nonconsensual extraction will not interfere with or delay proper medical attention.
      Medical personnel determine the priority given to involuntary fluid extractions when other medi-
      cal treatment is required.

4.16. Testing at the Request of the Apprehended Person.
   4.16.1. A person subject to tests under paragraph 2.3. can request additional testing. These tests are
   paid for by the requesting individual, and an approved facility such as an off-base hospital or research
   laboratory performs the tests. If they desire admissibility of other tests in a military or civilian court
   of law, they must ensure the state (or host nation when in an overseas area) approves the test and test
   method. Complete all tests as soon as possible, noting any delay on the resulting documents.
   4.16.2. If someone requests additional testing, the apprehending official may help make those
   arrangements. However, tests conducted under authority of the UCMJ remain valid when circum-
38                                                             AFI31-204_66ABWSUP_I 28 MAY 2008


     stances prevent timely release of the individual, or for whatever reason additional testing is not com-
     pleted.

4.17. Off-installation Traffic Activities. Civil authorities enforce traffic laws in areas not under mili-
tary control. Likewise, the security police often investigate on-base accidents and incidents of interest to
local authorities. Consequently, the CSP must develop a program for the sharing and exchanging of infor-
mation with civil authorities. In overseas areas, these procedures are generally well documented in formal
agreements with the host nation. Local procedures must cover the receiving, processing, and securing of
traffic and related incident reports received from other investigative agencies.
4.17. (66ABW) If a local agency requests information regarding an on-base accident or incident of inter-
est to that local authority, they may receive all information pertaining to the incident with the exception of
Privacy Act information. The local agency will make the request through 66 SFS/S5R. Any reports or
accidents that Security Forces receive from local agencies will be filed through SFMIS and given a case
file number in order to be filed appropriately.

4.18. Compliance With Local and State Laws.
     4.18.1. Installation commanders must ensure drivers comply with state and local traffic laws when
     operating government vehicles on or off base.
     4.18.2. Commanders coordinate with the proper civil law enforcement agency before moving gov-
     ernment vehicles or property that require special handling or exceed legal limits such as weight,
     length, width, or other standards.
     4.18.3. Installation commanders should maintain a close liaison with civil enforcement agencies and
     encourage the following:
        4.18.3.1. When possible, the prompt release of government vehicles and operators involved in
        accidents or incidents.
        4.18.3.2. Prompt notice to military authorities when military personnel or drivers of government
        motor vehicles are involved in traffic accidents or detained for serious violations of civil traffic
        laws.
        4.18.3.3. Prompt notice of any state, local, or host nation action to suspend, revoke, or restrict the
        driving privileges of personnel assigned to the installation.

4.19. Civil-Military Cooperative Programs.
     4.19.1. The State-Armed Forces Traffic Workshop Program is an organized effort to coordinate mili-
     tary and civil traffic safety activities throughout a state or area. Installation commanders should coop-
     erate and provide proper support and participation.
     4.19.2. The installation commander should establish a community-installation traffic workshop pro-
     gram to coordinate the installation traffic efforts with those of local communities. Sound and practical
     traffic planning depends on a balanced program of traffic enforcement, engineering, and education.
     Civilian and military legal and law enforcement officers, traffic engineers, safety officials, and public
     affairs officers should take part.
4.20. (Added-66ABW) Flight Line Driving. The Chief, Transient Alert (66 MSG/LRDT) controls oper-
ation of vehicles on the Hanscom AFB aircraft-parking ramp. Mission-essential vehicles that have a need
AFI31-204_66ABWSUP_I 28 MAY 2008                                                               39


to cross the ramp or a taxiway/runway controlled by MassPort must be coordinated through Transient
Alert.

                    DRIVING RECORDS AND THE TRAFFIC POINT SYSTEM

5.1. Driving Records. Use SPAS or the AF Form 1313 to record vehicle traffic accidents, moving and
parking violations, suspension or revocation actions, and traffic point assessments involving military and
DoD civilian personnel, their family members, and other personnel operating motor vehicles on a military
installation. In filling out the form, use the following codes in the “accident classification” block:
5.1. (66ABW) The 66 SFS uses SFMIS to record vehicle accidents, moving and parking violations, sus-
pension or revocation actions and traffic point assessments.
     5.1.1. Identify individuals who are principals in a motor vehicle accident as “S” subject or “V” vic-
     tim.
     5.1.2. Identify accidents appropriately with “MVA” minor vehicle accident; “NLD” no liability deter-
     mined; “PD” property damage; “PI” personal injury; “G” government; “P” private; “V” vehicle; and
     “FO” fixed object.
AFI31-204_66ABWSUP_I 28 MAY 2008                                                                        41


Table 5.1. Suspension/Revocation of Driving Privileges (See Notes 1 and 2).
 Assessment: 1. Two-year revocation is mandatory on determination of facts by installation commander.
 Violation: Driving while driver’s license or installation driving privileges are under suspension or
 revocation.
 Assessment: 2. One-year revocation is mandatory on determination of facts by installation commander.
 Violation: Refusal to submit to or failure to complete chemical tests (implied consent).
 Assessment: 3. One-year revocation is mandatory on conviction.
 Violation:
 1. Manslaughter (or negligent homicide by vehicle) resulting from the operation of a motor vehicle.
 2. Driving or in physical control of a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor
 0.10% or greater. Note: Where state or local authority use a more stringent standard (i.e., 0.08 instead of
 0.10), Air Force units will assimilate the more stringent standard.
 3. Driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of any narcotic or while under the influence of any
 other drug (including alcohol) to the degree rendered incapable of safe vehicle operation.
 4. Use of a motor vehicle in the commission of a felony.
 5. Fleeing the scene of an accident involving death or personal injury (hit and run).
 6. Perjury or making a false statement or affidavit under oath to responsible officials relating to the
 ownership or operation of motor vehicles.
 7. Unauthorized use of a motor vehicle belonging to another, when the act does not amount to a felony.
 Assessment: 4. Suspension for a period of six months or less or revocation for a period not to exceed
 one year is discretionary.
 Violation:
 1. Mental or physical impairment (not including alcohol or other drug use) to the degree rendered
 incompetent to drive.
 2. Commission of an offense in another state which, if committed on the installation, would establish
 grounds for suspension or revocation.
 3. Permitting an unlawful or fraudulent use of an official driver’s license.
 4. Conviction of fleeing or attempting to elude a police officer.
 5. Conviction of racing on the highway.
 6. Excessive parking and other non-moving violations as covered under paragraph 2.5.1.1.

NOTES:
  1. When imposing a suspension or revocation because of an off-installation offense, the effective
     date is the same as the date of civil conviction or the suspension or revocation date of state or host
     nation driving privileges. This effective date can be retroactive.
   2. No points are assessed solely for revocation or suspension actions. Except for implied consent
      violations, base revocations on a conviction by a civilian court, military courts-martial, nonjudi-
      cial punishment under Article 15 of the UCMJ, or a separate hearing as otherwise addressed in
      this instruction. If revocation for implied consent is combined with another revocation such as
      one year for intoxicated driving, revocations may run consecutively (total of 24 months) or con-
      currently (total of 12 months). Apply the installation commander’s policy systematically and not
      on a case-by-case basis.
42                                                            AFI31-204_66ABWSUP_I 28 MAY 2008


5.2. The Traffic Point System. The traffic point system provides a uniform administrative device to
impartially judge service personnel's driving performance. This system is not a disciplinary measure or a
substitute for punitive action. Further, this system is not intended to interfere in any way with the reason-
able exercise of an installation commander’s prerogative to issue, suspend, revoke, deny, or reinstate
installation driving privileges.

5.3. Point System Application. The use of the point system and procedures prescribed herein are man-
datory. The point system applies to civilian personnel operating government vehicles on and off the
installation and to their POVs driven on-base. It applies to military personnel operating GOVs and POVs
on or off the installation and to dependents, civilian employees, and all other individuals subject to this
instruction operating POVs on the installation. Unless an individual submits a rebuttal, assess points
according to the Table 5.2. Also assess points to individuals found guilty by a military or civilian court,
or upon payment of fine or forfeiture of pay and allowances, or posted bond or collateral. Do not use the
point system for non-moving violations.

Table 5.2. Point Assessment for Moving Violations (See Note 1).
Violation                                                                                 Points

instruments or to transmit simulated erroneous speed (prohibited on DoD installations).
Driver involved in accident is deemed responsible (only added to points assessed for           1
specific violations).

NOTES:
  1. When two or more violations are committed on a single occasion, assess the points for the offense
     having the greater value.
   2. Use this measure for other than minor vehicle safety defects or when a driver or registrant fails to
      correct a minor defect (for example, a burned out headlight not replaced within the grace period
      on a warning ticket).
   3. Applies to not using or improper use of a child restraint device, i.e., car seat, infant carrier, booster
      seat, belt/strap modification (when required by manufacturer) etc. Assess four points when no
      restraint system of any kind is used.

5.4. Point System Procedures.
   5.4.1. Reports of moving traffic violations recorded on DD Form 1408 or DD Form 1805 will serve
   as a basis for determining point assessment.
   5.4.2. On receipt of DD Form 1408 or other military law enforcement report of a moving violation
   (e.g., AFI 3545) the unit commander or designated supervisor will conduct an inquiry. The com-
   mander will take or recommend proper disciplinary or administrative action.
   5.4.3. Distribute citation copies and process point assessments IAW para 4.9.
   5.4.4. Installation commanders may require the following driver improvement measures as appropri-
   ate:
       5.4.4.1. Advisory letter through the unit commander or supervisor to any person who has
       acquired six traffic points within a six-month period.
44                                                            AFI31-204_66ABWSUP_I 28 MAY 2008


        5.4.4.2. Counseling or driver improvement interview by the unit commander of any person who
        acquires more than six points but less than 12 traffic points within a six-month period.
        5.4.4.3. Referral for medical evaluation when a driver, based on reasonable belief, appears to
        have mental or physical limits that had, or may have, an adverse effect on driving ability.
        5.4.4.4. Attendance at driver improvement program (DIP) to improve driving skill, awareness, or
        attitude.
        5.4.4.5. Referral to an alcohol or drug treatment or rehabilitation facility for evaluation, counsel-
        ing, or treatment. This action is required for active duty military personnel in all cases in which
        alcohol or other drugs are a contributing factor to a traffic citation, incident, or accident.
     5.4.5. The installation commander may suspend or revoke driving privileges as provided by this
     instruction regardless of whether these improvement measures are accomplished.
     5.4.5. (66ABW) This authority is delegated by the 66 ABW/CC to the 66 MSG/CC.
     5.4.6. Notify in writing anyone whose driving privileges are suspended or revoked (for one violation
     or an accumulation of 12 traffic points within 12 consecutive months, or 18 traffic points within 24
     consecutive months). Installation commanders determine suspension and revocation periods for
     offenses not covered in Table 5.1.; however, any revocation must be for a period of 6 months or more.
     The installation commander may impose a longer suspension or revocation period (to include offenses
     in Table 5.1.) based on the person’s overall driving record. Consider the frequency, flagrancy, and
     severity of moving violations, and the response to previous driver improvement measures. In all
     cases, military members must successfully complete a prescribed course in remedial driver training
     before reinstatement of driving privileges.
     5.4.6. (66ABW) This authority is delegated by the 66 ABW/CC to the 66 MSG/CC.
     5.4.7. Points assessed against a person remain in effect for point accumulation purposes for 24 con-
     secutive months. Routinely review driver records to delete traffic points during records update while
     recording new offenses and forwarding records to new duty stations. Completion of a revocation
     based on points requires removal from the driver record of all points assessed before the revocation.
     5.4.8. Removal of points does not authorize removal of driving record entries for moving violations,
     chargeable accidents, suspensions, or revocations. Recorded entries will remain posted on individual
     driving records for the period of time indicated below.
        5.4.8.1. Chargeable nonfatal traffic accidents or moving violations--three years.
        5.4.8.2. Nonmandatory suspensions or revocations--five years.
        5.4.8.3. Mandatory revocations--seven years.

5.5. Disposition of Driving Records. Establish procedures to promptly notify the CSP when a person
assigned to or employed on the installation is transferred to another installation, released from military
service, or ends employment or affiliation with the installation.
5.5. (66ABW) Hanscom AFB personnel will clear 66 SFS/S5R, located in Bldg 1725, Security Forces
Squadron, as part of their out-processing. 66 SFS/S5R is notified of an individual changing duty stations
via the VMPF. If an individual has any history, to include driver’s license revocation or suspension, the
individual has accumulated traffic points or the individual has any other history logged in the SFMIS, 66
AFI31-204_66ABWSUP_I 28 MAY 2008                                                                           45


SFS/S5R obtains a copy of the individual’s orders and will forward an Individual History Record to the
gaining commander. If the gaining base’s SFS unit is equipped with SFMIS, 66 SFS/S5R will send the
Individual History Record via SFMIS’s History Transfer. If the gaining base’s SFS unit is not equipped
with SFMIS, 66 SFS/S5R will send a paper copy to that SFS unit. That SFS unit will then forward the
individual’s information to the gaining commander.
   5.5.1. If persons transferred to another Air Force installation have valid points or other entries on
   their driving records, the CSP must forward the records to the CSP of the gaining installation. The
   gaining CSP should coordinate with applicable commanders and continue any Air Force suspension
   or revocation based on intoxicated driving or accumulation of traffic points. Traffic points for persons
   transferred will continue to accumulate as specified in para 5.4.7.
   5.5.2. Follow AFI 37-138, Records Disposition--Procedures and Responsibilities, and AFMAN
   37-139, Records Disposition Schedule, to maintain and destroy records of military personnel released
   from active duty. Driving records remain active in the case of immediate reenlistment, change of
   officer component, or military and civilian retirement when continued vehicle registration is autho-
   rized. Retain or destroy according to AFMAN 37-139 records on civilian personnel who are terminat-
   ing on-base employment or on-base registration.
   5.5.3. Forward driving records of military family members containing point assessments or other
   entries to the sponsor’s gaining installation and review in the same manner as for service members.

                           IMPOUNDING PRIVATELY OWNED VEHICLES

6.1. General. This chapter provides the standards and procedures for law enforcement personnel when
towing, inventorying, searching, impounding, and disposing of POVs. This policy is based on:
     6.1.1. The interests of the Air Force in crime prevention, traffic safety, and the orderly flow of vehicle
     traffic movement.
     6.1.2. The vehicle owner's constitutional rights to due process, freedom from unreasonable search
     and seizure, and freedom from deprivation of private property.

6.2. Standards for Impoundment.
     6.2.1. You should not impound a vehicle unless it interferes with traffic, threatens public safety or
     convenience, is involved in criminal activity, contains evidence of criminal activity, or is stolen or
     abandoned.
     6.2.2. The impoundment of vehicles is inappropriate if other reasonable alternatives exist. When
     possible, attempt to locate the owner of the POV and have the vehicle removed. If reasonably feasi-
     ble, allow another responsible person to drive or tow the POV, if they first have permission from the
     owner, operator, or person empowered to control the vehicle. However in such cases, the security
     police (or towing contractor) is not responsible for safeguarding the vehicle.
     6.2.3. Impounding of POVs is justified when any of the following conditions exist:
        6.2.3.1. The vehicle is illegally parked:
            6.2.3.1.1. On a street or bridge, in a tunnel, or is double parked and interferes with the orderly
            flow of traffic.
            6.2.3.1.2. On a sidewalk, within an intersection, on a crosswalk, on a railroad track, in a fire
            lane, or is blocking a driveway so that the vehicle interferes with operations or creates a safety
            hazard to other roadway users or the general public.
            6.2.3.1.3. When blocking an emergency exit door of any public place.
            6.2.3.1.4. In a “tow-away” zone that is so marked with signs.
        6.2.3.2. The vehicle interferes with or is involved in one of the following:
            6.2.3.2.1. Street cleaning or snow removal operations after attempts to contact the owner fail.
            6.2.3.2.2. Emergency operations during a natural disaster, fire, or other emergency.
            6.2.3.2.3. The vehicle was used in a crime or contains evidence of criminal activity.
            6.2.3.2.4. The owner or person in charge of the vehicle is apprehended and therefore unable
            (or unwilling) to arrange removal of the vehicle.
            6.2.3.2.5. The POV is mechanically defective and is a menace to others using the public road-
            ways.
            6.2.3.2.6. The POV is disabled by a traffic accident and the operator is unavailable or physi-
            cally incapable of having the vehicle towed to a place of safety for storage or safekeeping.
AFI31-204_66ABWSUP_I 28 MAY 2008                                                                       47


          6.2.3.2.7. Law enforcement personnel reasonably believe the vehicle is abandoned.

6.3. Towing and Storage.
   6.3.1. The Air Force or a contracted wrecker service may tow and store impounded POVs depending
   on availability of towing services and the local commander’s preference.
   6.3.1. (66ABW) A Memorandum of Agreement has been established with local wrecker companies
   to provide towing and impoundment services on Hanscom AFB.
   6.3.2. The installation commander designates a securable enclosed area on the installation for use as
   an impound lot. You may use an impoundment area belonging to a contracted wrecker service pro-
   vided the area is reasonably secure. The CSP approves contractor impoundment areas and maintains
   keys for all on-base impoundment areas.
   6.3.2. (66ABW) 66 SFS will maintain an impound lot on Hanscom AFB. The Investigations Section
   (66 SFS/S2I) is the OPR for the lot. The designated impound lot is located in the Southeast corner of
   the Transportation Compound.
   6.3.3. Impound or tow POVs for appropriate violations of the installation traffic code or involvement
   in criminal activities under the direct supervision of law enforcement personnel.
   6.3.3. (66ABW) When the operator of a POV is apprehended or detained for drunken driving, 66 SFS
   personnel will secure the vehicle by one of the following methods:
      6.3.3.1. (Added-66ABW) If another person in the vehicle is unimpaired, possesses a valid
      driver’s license, has the consent of the driver or owner and if the vehicle is insured, that person
      may take possession of the vehicle.
      6.3.3.2. (Added-66ABW) If the vehicle is blocking or impeding traffic, coordinate through 66
      SFS/S3 so the vehicle can be towed off-base by a civilian wrecker service.
   6.3.4. (Added-66ABW) When a driver cannot produce proof of insurance and states their vehicle is
   not insured, the vehicle will be towed off-base by a civilian wrecker service. No one, including 66 SFS
   personnel, will drive the vehicle any further. An uninsured POV will not be operated on-base under
   any circumstances.
   6.3.5. (Added-66ABW) When a driver cannot provide valid proof of insurance but states the vehicle
   is insured, issue a DD Form 1408 (military) or DD Form 1805 (family members, civilians) to the
   driver and release. The military driver will have 72 hours to bring evidence of insurance, valid at the
   time the ticket was issued, to the Security Forces Desk Sergeant. A civilian driver will have 72 hours
   to contact the US Magistrate Court at the location identified on their notice. If proof is not verified
   within 72 hours, the military member’s commander or the US Magistrate Court will process the ticket
   for action.

6.4. Procedures for Impoundment.
   6.4.1. Unattended POVs.
      6.4.1.1. Conspicuously place DD Form 2504, Abandoned Vehicle Notice (See DODD 5525.4),
      on POVs considered abandoned or improperly unattended. Document this action with an entry in
      the security police blotter.
48                                                             AFI31-204_66ABWSUP_I 28 MAY 2008


        6.4.1.1. (66ABW) A vehicle is considered abandoned if there is “reasonable belief” that the
        owner has left the POV without intending to return or reclaim the POV. Abandoning or parking a
        vehicle on-base in any way that presents a hazard is prohibited. Such vehicles are subject to
        impoundment at the owner’s expense, without warning. A vehicle is presumed abandoned if it is
        left unattended for a period of more than three duty days. Additionally, vehicles parked more than
        10 days missing the engine or other major parts (e.g., fender, windshield, wheel, etc.) are deemed
        abandoned. If the vehicle does not have to be moved immediately, a DD Form 2504, Abandoned
        Vehicle Notice, will be conspicuously placed on the vehicle. If the vehicle has not been moved and
        three duty days have elapsed without contact from the owner, the vehicle will be towed. All rea-
        sonable attempts to contact the owner will be made before towing a vehicle. NOTE: If the owner
        is on temporary duty or leave, the vehicle will not be considered abandoned or towed unless it is a
        safety hazard.
        6.4.1.2. Allow the owner three days from the date the POV is tagged to remove the vehicle. Have
        the vehicle towed if it's not moved within the allotted time. If a contracted wrecker service is used,
        complete a DD Form 2505 according to local procedures.
        6.4.1.3. After the vehicle is removed, security police or the contractor completes the DD Form
        2506, Vehicle Impoundment Report (See DODD 5525.4), as a record of action taken.
            6.4.1.3.1. Law enforcement personnel or the towing contractor conduct an inventory listing
            personal property. Do not open closed containers such as a suitcase unless necessary to iden-
            tify the owner or if the contents might present a danger to the public. In most cases, listing the
            container and sealing it with security tape will suffice.
            6.4.1.3.2. Place personal property in a secure area for safekeeping.
        6.4.1.4. Forward DD Form 2507, Notice of Vehicle Impoundment (See DODD 5525.4), by cer-
        tified mail to the address of the last known owner of the vehicle to advise the owner of the
        impoundment action and request information concerning the owner’s intentions concerning the
        vehicle.
     6.4.2. Stolen POVs or vehicles involved in criminal activity.
        6.4.2.1. Keep vehicles in Air Force custody when holding them for evidentiary purposes. Release
        recovered stolen POVs to the registered owner, unless held for evidentiary purposes, or to the law
        enforcement agency reporting the vehicle stolen, as appropriate.
        6.4.2.2. At times, civilian law enforcement or civilian government agencies will request the Air
        Force impound an on-base vehicle for reasons not related to military issues. Staff such requests
        through the Staff Judge Advocate and CSP. When appropriate, comply and support such requests
        and impound the vehicle for a reasonable period. Release the vehicle if civil authorities do not
        take custody of the vehicle within a reasonable period as determined by the installation com-
        mander.
        6.4.2.3. (Added-66ABW) All vehicles seized for evidentiary purposes will be towed and secured
        in the base impound lot.

6.5. Search Incident to Impoundment Based On Criminal Activity. Search of a POV in conjunction
with impoundment based on criminal activity will likely occur in one of the following general situations:
AFI31-204_66ABWSUP_I 28 MAY 2008                                                                         49


6.5. (66ABW) If a vehicle is impounded by S2I or the AF Office of Special Investigations because it was
used in a crime or they have reason to believe that evidence is contained within, search and seizure will be
conducted IAW procedures established in AFI 31-201, Security Police Standards and Procedures, Chap-
ter 8, and AFMAN 31-201V2, Legal Considerations, Chapter 1.
   6.5.1. The owner or operator is not present. This situation could arise during traffic and crime-related
   impoundments and abandoned vehicle seizures. Do not search the vehicle unless evidence or contra-
   band is in plain view or is readily discernible on the outside as evidence of criminal activity. When in
   doubt, obtain proper search authority before searching.
   6.5.2. The owner or operator is present. This situation can occur during a traffic or criminal incident
   or if the operator is apprehended for a crime or serious traffic violation and sufficient probable cause
   exists to seize the vehicle. In some cases, the operator is present but is unwilling, incapacitated, or
   otherwise unable to make adequate arrangements to safeguard the vehicle. As a general rule, you may
   search vehicles without search authority when there is a reasonable danger to police or public, there is
   a risk of loss or destruction of evidence, or the search is reasonable under rules governing search inci-
   dent to apprehension.

6.6. Disposition Of Vehicles After Impoundment.
   6.6.1. When a vehicle is impounded, hold it for as long as necessary for evidentiary, law enforcement,
   or other legal purposes. Unless directed otherwise by competent authority, release vehicles and prop-
   erty when no longer needed for one of the reasons stated above. Review Title 10, USC 2575, Dispo-
   sition of Unclaimed Property, and DoD Directive 4160.21-M, Defense Reutilization Marketing
   Manual, (when DRMO is used) before taking action to dispose of vehicles not claimed by the owner
   or an authorized agent.
   6.6.2. A vehicle is considered abandoned 60 days after making reasonable good faith efforts to con-
   tact the owner or when the owner is contacted and fails to take appropriate steps to assume responsi-
   bility for the vehicle. When owners decline to recover their vehicles, attempt to secure release of the
   vehicle by having the registered owners complete and sign the DD Form 2507. The 60-day waiting
   period does not apply when the owner releases the vehicle to the Air Force on DD Form 2507, signed
   letter, power of attorney, or other legally recognized document.
       6.6.2.1. Once the vehicle becomes the lawful possession of the Air Force, process the vehicle as
       abandoned property in accordance with local procedures. Unless otherwise directed, installation
       commanders have considerable latitude in determining the best use for, or disposal of, abandoned
       property. Scrap, auction, or use to support Morale, Welfare, and Recreation (MWR) activities are
       potential options. Consider local, state, or if applicable, host nation requirements. If you process
       vehicles through the Defense Reutilization Marketing Office (DRMO), follow applicable DRMO
       and DoD directives.

                                      Attachment 3 (Added-66ABW)

                                     HANSCOM AIR FORCE BASE
                                       RULES OF THE ROAD
A3.1. (Added-66ABW) Applicability. This attachment identifies the traffic codes or “rules of the road”
that are used to regulate the movement of all vehicular, pedestrian and other traffic on Hanscom AFB and
facilities under the jurisdictional control of the Installation Commander. These rules are not all inclusive
and personnel who operate vehicles on Hanscom AFB should familiarize themselves with the provisions
of AFI 31-204 in its entirety and the Handbook of Massachusetts Motor Vehicle Laws. Personnel subject
to the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) who violate any of the Rules of the Road may be pun-
ished under the provisions of Article 92 of the UCMJ, and be subject to administrative action or judicial/
non-judicial punishment or both. Individuals not subject to the UCMJ may be cited and referred to US
Magistrate Court and/or may be subject to administrative action.
A3.2. (Added-66ABW) Invalid Identification. Personnel will not, without proper authority, permit oth-
ers to use or borrow their vehicle’s registration, vehicle visitor’s pass, operator’s permit or other required
identification associated with motor vehicle registration or operation.
A3.3. (Added-66ABW) Traffic Enforcement.
     A3.3.1. (Added-66ABW) While on Hanscom AFB, no motorist shall willfully refuse or fail to com-
     ply with any lawful order or directions of Security Forces personnel or other person designated by the
     installation commander (as delegated) to direct, control or regulate traffic. These personnel will wear
     a highly-visible reflective vest. Supervisors of traffic controllers will ensure they know how to prop-
     erly direct traffic. Traffic directions may be given by hand, emergency light or siren. Motor vehicle
     operators are prohibited from playing radios or other stereo equipment at such a high level that would
     hinder their ability to hear emergency sirens or other audible signals.
     A3.3.2. (Added-66ABW) Motorists will obey official traffic signs; markings, barricades or other
     traffic control devices unless Security Forces personnel or traffic control officials direct them to do
     otherwise. Drivers must not move or bypass barricades.
     A3.3.3. (Added-66ABW) Motorists will yield and give right of way to responding emergency vehi-
     cles operating emergency lights or sirens. Emergency operators may assume the right-of-way at inter-
     sections, but only after first ensuring other traffic is in a position to yield.
     A3.3.4. (Added-66ABW) During actual emergency responses, emergency vehicle operators will
     maintain a speed that is safe and prudent for existing traffic, weather and road conditions, and will uti-
     lize audio and visual emergency warning devices as appropriate given the circumstances.
     A3.3.5. (Added-66ABW) A motorist who approaches an oncoming convoy that is escorted by a
     Security Forces vehicle or similar vehicle displaying an emergency light or warning device must pull
     the vehicle to the right of the roadway and remain stationary until the last vehicle of the convoy has
     passed. Motorists following the convoy are prohibited from passing and will follow at a distance of
     not less than 100 feet.
     A3.3.6. (Added-66ABW) Motorists will come to a complete stop at stop signs and traffic lights.
     They will yield to cross traffic in the intersection or to traffic that approaches the intersection so
     closely it creates a hazard.
AFI31-204_66ABWSUP_I 28 MAY 2008                                                                      55


   A3.3.7. (Added-66ABW) The use or open display of radar and laser detection devices that indicate
   the presence of speed recording instruments, or transmit simulated erroneous speeds, is prohibited and
   must be removed while on the installation.
   A3.3.8. (Added-66ABW) Any individual who observes someone operating any POV or GOV
   on-base in an unsafe, careless or reckless manner may initiate a traffic complaint at the Law Enforce-
   ment Desk. The complaint must be accomplished describing the vehicle, license number and state of
   issue, description of the driver and details of the violation.
A3.4. (Added-66ABW) Speed Restrictions.
   A3.4.1. (Added-66ABW) Basic Speed Limit. A driver’s speed must be reasonable and proper in rela-
   tion to the traffic, the proper use of the roadway and public safety considerations, including when:
      A3.4.1.1. (Added-66ABW) Approaching and crossing intersections.
      A3.4.1.2. (Added-66ABW) Approaching and rounding curves.
      A3.4.1.3. (Added-66ABW) Approaching the crests of hills.
      A3.4.1.4. (Added-66ABW) Traveling upon narrow or winding roadways.
      A3.4.1.5. (Added-66ABW) Special hazards exist due to pedestrians, organizational runs or for-
      mations, other traffic, weather or roadway conditions.
   A3.4.2. (Added-66ABW) General On-Base Speed Limits. The maximum speed is 25 miles per hour
   (mph) unless otherwise posted.
   A3.4.3. (Added-66ABW) The following speed limits apply in the areas indicated, unless otherwise
   posted or the basic speed limit is in effect:
      A3.4.3.1. (Added-66ABW) 20 mph on Arnold Street and on Marrett Street from Building #1993,
      Youth Center, to the Ent Road intersection.
      A3.4.3.2. (Added-66ABW) 15 mph when approaching or passing children waiting for or depart-
      ing from a school bus.
      A3.4.3.3. (Added-66ABW) 15 mph in all residential areas, including from the intersection of
      Vandenberg Drive and Langley Road to the intersection of Langley Road and Scott Circle and
      along Marrett Street from the Intersection of Marrett Street and Ent Road to Gate 2A.
      A3.4.3.4. (Added-66ABW) 15 mph when exiting the Hartwell (Gate #4) and Vandenberg (Gate
      #1) gates.
      A3.4.3.5. (Added-66ABW) 10 mph in parking zones and parking lots and when passing troop or

A3.12. (Added-66ABW) Snow Alerts. A snow alert warns of an impending snowstorm and establishes
on-street parking restrictions. ABWI 32-1002, Snow and Ice Control Plan, contains information on park-
ing restrictions. Security Forces personnel will cite vehicles not complying with snow alert provisions and
may tow and store vehicles at the owner’s expense. Penalties for not complying with snow alert provi-
sions are contained in Attachment 4 (Added), Table A4.1. (Added) Driving Violations and Penalties.
Personnel who use on-street parking and expect to be away from the base during the winter months should
park in the Long-Term Parking Lot identified in paragraph A3.6.2. (Added).
A3.13. (Added-66ABW) Retreat. Motorists will pull their vehicles to the right of the roadway and
remain stationary during the playing of “Retreat” and the National Anthem. Pedestrians, joggers and oper-
ators of bicycles, scooters, skateboards, roller blades, roller skates or other vehicles will remain stationary
and render appropriate courtesies.
A3.14. (Added-66ABW) Impounding of Vehicles. Impounding means to take control of a vehicle and
remove it to a safe place. Generally, we do not want to take responsibility for someone’s vehicle.
   A3.14.1. (Added-66ABW) There are three situations in which 66 SFS would need to take responsi-
   bility for someone’s vehicle:
       A3.14.1.1. (Added-66ABW) The vehicle is evidence or contains evidence. This means the 66
       SFS believes that it was used in a crime or have reason to believe that evidence is in it.
       A3.14.1.2. (Added-66ABW) The vehicle is an obstruction. It could be a fire lane, a crosswalk, on
       a sidewalk, blocking a driveway, preventing cleaning or snow removal, etc. The preferred course
       of action is for 66 SFS to contact the owner to move it or to have a responsible person who is act-
       ing for the owner move it. If unable to locate a responsible party, the vehicle will be moved a short
       distance--in sight of the original location--to a legal parking space and left for the owner to collect.
       If this is not possible, the vehicle will be impounded.
       A3.14.1.3. (Added-66ABW) The vehicle is abandoned. That is, “reasonable belief” that the POV
       is abandoned, which means the owner has left the POV without intending to return or reclaim the
       POV.
   A3.14.2. (Added-66ABW) Impoundment will only be accomplished by the 66th Security Forces
   Squadron Investigation Section (66 SFS/S2I).
   A3.14.3. (Added-66ABW) Responsibilities.
       A3.14.3.1. (Added-66ABW) On-Duty Shifts (66 SFS/S3O) will:
           A3.14.3.1.1. (Added-66ABW) Identify the POVs that are candidates for impoundment via
           AF Form 3545, Incident Report, and attach third copy of DD Form 2504, Abandoned Vehicle
           Notice.
           A3.14.3.1.2. (Added-66ABW) If the POV does not have to be moved, fill out a DD Form
           2504 and place the original copy in a conspicuous place on the POV. Place the second copy in
           the 72-hour suspense file at the Law Enforcement Desk and forward to 66 SFS/S2I after 72
           hours. Make a blotter entry with the reason for suspecting the vehicle is abandoned.
           A3.14.3.1.3. (Added-66ABW) If the POV has to be moved or 72 hours elapses without con-
           tact from the owner, coordinate with 66 SFS/S2I and supervise the towing of the POV.

     A3.14.3.2. (Added-66ABW) 66th Security Forces Squadron Investigation Section (66 SFS/S2I)
     will:
        A3.14.3.2.1. (Added-66ABW) Supervise all POV impoundments.
        A3.14.3.2.2. (Added-66ABW) Control access to the impoundment lot.
        A3.14.3.2.3. (Added-66ABW) For POVs to be stored in the impoundment lot (for eviden-
        tiary purposes only), conduct an inventory of the contents of the POV and tag and secure
        acquired property needing additional safeguarding via DD Form 2506, Vehicle Impoundment
        Report. Fill out a DD Form 2507, Notice of Vehicle Impoundment, and mail it to last known
        owner by certified mail. If the POV is not claimed by the owner, dispose of the POV in accor-
        dance with the rules printed on the DD Form 2507 and AFI 31-204 (90 days if no contact from
        owner; 120 days if contact is made). If the POV is claimed by the owner, release the POV to
        the owner.
        A3.14.3.2.4. (Added-66ABW) For abandoned vehicles, contact one of three non-fee con-
        tracted towing services per the established Memorandum of Agreement and arrange for tow-
        ing off the installation.
