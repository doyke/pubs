1. Scope: Approximately 220,000 people die each year from sudden cardiac arrest. Most arrests are due
to underlying heart disease and result in irregular rhythms called ventricular tachycardia or ventricular
fibrillation. These non-life supporting heart rhythms cause the pumping action of the heart to stop
abruptly and the victim to lose consciousness and become pulseless and breathless. The technique of
delivering an electrical shock, called defibrillation, is the only known treatment for ventricular fibrillation
and pulseless ventricular tachycardia. To be effective, defibrillation must be administered within minutes
of a cardiac arrest. For every minute that passes without defibrillation, a victim’s chance of survival
decrease 7 to 10 percent. After as little as 10 minutes, very few resuscitation attempts are successful. In
the past the ability to defibrillate was solely in the hands of trained emergency medical personnel, which
may have long response times. With the advent of the automated external defibrillator (AED), a trained
rescuer can quickly and easily defibrillate a cardiac arrest victim and potentially save lives. New genera-
tion AEDs are safe, effective, lightweight, low maintenance, and relatively inexpensive. In August 2003
the Secretary of Defense mandated that military installations establish public access defibrillation (PAD)
programs with consideration for placement of AEDs in federal buildings. This document describes
AFMC guidance on roles and responsibilities deemed necessary to ensure the broadest training and appro-
priate first response AED utilization. The scope of training and use is applicable to all federal employees
and active duty personnel throughout AFMC.

2. Roles and Responsibilities:
   2.1. Installation Commander:
       2.1.1. Has overall responsibility for the PAD program. Appoints an installation PAD Coordinator.
       2.1.2. Appoints a Director of Base Medical Services/Medical Group Commander who follows
       and ensures current medical guidelines are maintained.
       2.1.3. Ensures each organization with an AED appoints a unit individual as the AED point of con-
       tact (POC) to meet guidelines set forth in this document.
       2.1.4. Facilitates notification of Traumatic Stress Response Team upon unit Commander request.
   2.2. Installation PAD Coordinator:
       2.2.1. Will maintain a log of all installation AEDs and their specific location.
       2.2.2. Coordinates with the PAD medical director and medical logistics and maintenance on all
       installation AED purchases.
       2.2.3. Conducts annual inspection of unit AED operational and exercise logs to ensure compli-
       ance to this instruction.
   2.3. Medical Group Commander (MDG/CC):
       2.3.1. Is responsible to the installation commander to ensure all AED medical objectives are
       maintained and provide professional guidance on PAD program administration.
       2.3.2. Appoints, in writing, a physician medical director, who will be proficient in emergency
       medical protocols, cardio-pulmonary resuscitation, and the use of AEDs IAW local state laws.
   2.4. PAD Medical Director:
       2.4.1. Has direct medical oversight over the PAD program and its participants.
4                                                                        AFMCI10-301 8 APRIL 2008


       2.4.2. Has general responsibilities that include the review of the "AED-Chain of Survival" and
       "Post-Use Procedure" guidelines included in this document (Attachment 2, Attachment 3).
       2.4.3. Will be available to organizations for consultation on unit compliance with this guidance.
       Continuation of CPR/AED training is the responsibility of the purchasing organization.
       2.4.4. Critically reviews all recorded data from all AED usage events and provides feedback to
       the impacted organization and unit commander, as needed.
    2.5. Logistics and Maintenance:
       2.5.1. Procurement and receipt of AEDs will be coordinated by the purchasing unit with the near-
       est medical logistics office. Each unit’s AED POC will be responsible for daily visual checks and
       operational checks using the respective manufacturer’s AED functional operations checklist.
       2.5.2. The nearest medical equipment repair center (MERC) will provide limited maintenance
       such as battery replacement (which must be provided by the owning unit), if indicated. Should an
       AED require further servicing, the unit AED POC will arrange this maintenance or service with
       the manufacturer. The local MERC is responsible for certifying new AEDs, periodic accountabil-
       ity, monitoring safety recall/health device alert notification, and ensuring subsequent recall reme-
       dies are completed. Accountability and management of safety recalls and health device alert
       notifications will be accomplished utilizing the Defense Medical Logistics Standards Support Sys-
       tem (DLMSS). AED units will be placed in this system to monitor the locations and points of con-
       tact, in the event of any recall or notification. The cost of routine and periodic maintenance (and
       immediate replacement of a failed AED) will be funded by the owning unit.
    2.6. Unit Commander:
       2.6.1. The unit commander of the purchasing organization will appoint an AED POC who will
       serve as the primary liaison between the local organization’s AED program, the installation PAD
       Coordinator, Base Medical Director and medical logistics.
       2.6.2. The PAD program is not a “medical” program. It is a “user” program. Therefore, each unit
       commander funds the purchase, reuse supplies, and long-term training for unit personnel in the
       facility where the AED is located.
       2.6.3. Each unit commander has full authority to purchase and implement any number of AEDs as
       they desire in coordination with the installation PAD Coordinator and the AED Medical Director.
       2.6.4. Determine need for Traumatic Stress Response intervention following AED usage.
    2.7. AED Point of Contact (POC):
       2.7.1. Is a member of the local organization where the AED is posted and deployed.
       2.7.2. Is responsible for the maintenance (daily visual unit check IAW manufacturer’s guidance
       and minimal monthly check expiration dates of all supplies) of the AED to ensure its readiness for
       use and follows manufacturer's suggested maintenance protocol for the particular AED model.
       2.7.3. Re-stocks AED supplies after use in an emergency situation (Attachment 7).
       2.7.4. Ensures validation of annual American Red Cross or biannual American Heart Association
       CPR/AED of core staff members to ensure they are properly trained, certified, and/or recertified in
       CPR and AED procedures. The AED POC will maintain a list of certified personnel.
AFMCI10-301 8 APRIL 2008                                                                                 5


      2.7.5. Conducts and documents quarterly CPR/AED exercise scenarios to ensure certified,
      trained staff knows AED locations, all equipment is operational, and that staff respond appropri-
      ately. If the AED POC needs additional guidance, contact the installation PAD coordinator or Base
      Medical Director as the local resource. (Attachment 9, Attachment 10, Attachment 11)
      2.7.6. Ensures AEDs and supplies are centrally located to ensure quick, easy access.
      2.7.7. Installs AED location signage at all AED locations and posts information signs, along with
      an AED photo, within the facility to readily identify location of all AEDs (Attachment 8).
      2.7.8. Ensures a core group of the organization's members are trained in CPR/AED use and can
      respond to an event. Certified training is available through the American Heart Association or the
      American Red Cross.
      2.7.9. After an AED is used in an emergency situation, the AED POC or the responder will imme-
      diately complete the AED Coordination Report for Medical Director (Attachment 6), and for-
      ward it to the Medical Director for review. The Medical Director should receive the completed
      report within one duty day of the AED use event.
      2.7.10. Arranges for Traumatic Stress Response (TSR) debriefing sessions to be offered for all
      individuals involved in providing assistance in an emergency situation (Attachment 6) as needed.
      2.7.11. Coordinates all concerns with AED use, training and new purchases, with PAD medical
      director and/or medical logistics as needed.
   2.8. Responders:
      2.8.1. Are currently certified in CPR/AED use and will respond to an emergency. Specific train-
      ing and certification is available through the American Heart Association or the American Red
      Cross.
      2.8.2. Follow the protocol in an emergency situation as depicted in the AED Treatment Algorithm
      (Attachment 4).

3. AED Model Selection:
   3.1. AED model selection will be determined by the installation Medical Director, based on recom-
   mendations from the installation’s Medical Logistics staff. They will utilize a list of comparable prod-
   ucts. A single AED model should be purchased for the installation. Standardization of AED models
   will ease responder familiarization, unit maintenance and supply logistics. AED models should be
   considered based on simplicity of use, durability, battery life, internal memory, warranty, cost, and
   available training packages.

4. AED Location and Installation:
   4.1. The essential key to surviving a heart attack is early CPR and defibrillation, when indicated.
   Therefore, AEDs should be strategically placed throughout a unit facility to reduce time between vic-
   tim collapse and ability to provide initial shock when indicated to a heart attack victim.
      4.1.1. Factors to consider in determining AED placement include the following:
          4.1.1.1. Facility size and or accessibility.
          4.1.1.2. Number of employees in the facility.
6                                                                          AFMCI10-301 8 APRIL 2008


           4.1.1.3. Identified high risk environments.
           4.1.1.4. Number of people that may have public access to the facility on a daily basis.
           4.1.1.5. Average age of the facility occupants; older populations are at higher risk.
           4.1.1.6. Security levels that may hinder access to the facility by emergency response crews.
           4.1.1.7. Increase risk of incidence of heart disease given the communication population as
           reported by local, state and national health departments.
           4.1.1.8. Use of high voltage electrical equipment.
           4.1.1.9. Emergency response protocol that may already be in place for your facility, keeping
           in mind that early initial shock when indicated increases potential for survival.
    4.2. To achieve optimal area coverage within a building, an AED should be positioned no more than
    one minute's travel time (one way) from any given point within the building.
    4.3. Optimal response time from the identification of a person "down" to the arrival of AED on-scene
    is three minutes or less.
    4.4. Optimal response time from the identification of a person down to the delivery of a shock (i.e.
    drop-to-shock) should be less than five minutes.
    4.5. AED accessory kits should be packed with the AED so that the responder will not lose time
    deciding what to take to the emergency. These kits should provide items such as gloves, scissors,
    razor, tape, extra electrodes and a barrier mask (Attachment 7).
    4.6. AEDs should be stored in such a way that an alarm is activated when the unit is removed for use.
    This can be set up as a central alarm, whereby the local EMS is automatically notified, or as a local
    sounding alarm that can draw assistance to the scene.

5. Emergency Response:
    5.1. An event timeline for a responder should ideally be as follows:
       5.1.1. Minute #1.
           5.1.1.1. Discovery of “downed” victim: Initiate Chain of Survival; Activate 9-1-1.
           5.1.1.2. Decision to retrieve AED.
           5.1.1.3. Identify closest AED.
       5.1.2. Minute #2-3.
           5.1.2.1. Retrieval of AED (round trip).
       5.1.3. Minute #4.
           5.1.3.1. Re-familiarization with AED instructions.
           5.1.3.2. Preparation of victim and application of chest pads.
           5.1.3.3. Detection of shockable rhythm.
           5.1.3.4. Delivery of shock.
AFMCI10-301 8 APRIL 2008                                                                              7


  5.2. Depending on the population served in the facility, some AED locations will contain both adult
  and child chest leads. AEDs with both adult and child leads will be clearly marked by a sign stating
  “This device is equipped with both Adult and Child chest pads. Please check to ensure appropriate
  pads are utilized.” on the outside of the AED cabinet. Specialized child chest leads are labeled CHILD
  on the package to prevent accidental misuse. Users should check to ensure they have the correct chest
  pads prior to application.

                                          TSR INFORMATION

A6.1. Traumatic Stress Response [formerly Critical Incident Stress Management (CISM) Informa-
tion]
     A6.1.1. What is TSR?
        A6.1.1.1. The primary goal of TSR teams is to foster resiliency in those exposed to potentially
        traumatic stress. This is accomplished through preparatory education for those likely to experience
        potentially traumatic stress, and through education, creening, psychological first aid, and referral
        for those exposed to potentially traumatic stress. TSR teams (1) serve as trauma response consult-
        ants to unit leaders; (2) prepare personnel likely to be exposed to potentially traumatic events; and
        (3) provide screening, education, psychological first aid, and referral for those exposed to poten-
        tially traumatic events. This document also provides revised training guidance.

A6.2. What events might precipitate a request for TSR services?
     A6.2.1. TSR services may be provided in response to events at the request of the unit commander.
     The services provided will vary depending on the nature of the mishap and the needs of the squadrons
     involved in the mishap. In general, the commander of any unit that incurs loss of personnel or signifi-
     cant injury to personnel as a result of a mishap should consult with a TSR team leader to determine
     whether there is a need for TSR support. Then, if the commander subsequently requests service, the
     nature of those services should be developed by the commander in collaboration with the TSR team
     leader.
     A6.2.2. Many types of events have the potential to produce individual and community traumatic
     stress. Events include: large scale disasters (tornadoes, bombings, hurricanes, etc.) and small scale
     disasters (suicide, death or near-death of coworker, workplace violence event, etc.). TSR services will
     be provided after traumatic events to help those who have experienced the events. The goal is to assist
     those affected by traumatic events to cope with the normal stress reaction in an effective manner.
     These actions are intended to minimize the impact of exposure to these events and prevent or mitigate
     permanent disability if possible.

A6.3. What is the procedure for requesting TSR services?
     A6.3.1. The office of record for TSR services is the Life Skills Support Center. The affected wing
     commander will support or arrange for consultation between the TSR team chief and the affected unit
     commander to determine what level of service, if any, is needed.
