                                            Chapter 1

                                  GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. General. All evaluations will be conducted IAW the provisions of AFI 11-202V2 and this
volume.
1.2. Waivers. Waiver authority for this publication is the MAJCOM/A3. Waivers will be
requested from the parent MAJCOM Stan/Eval through appropriate channels.
1.3. Procedures.
     1.3.1. Flight examiners (FE) will use the evaluation criteria in this volume to conduct all
     flight, Aircrew Training Device (ATD), and EPE. To ensure standard and objective
     evaluations, flight examiners will be thoroughly familiar with the prescribed evaluation
     criteria.
     1.3.2. Authorized recording devices, Air Combat Maneuvering Instrumentation (ACMI),
     Range Integration Instrumentation System (RIIS), or Video Tape Recorders (VTR) should be
     used, when available, to reconstruct/evaluate the mission. When used, these recordings will
     managed as official electronic records IAW AFMAN 33-363 and disposed of only IAW the
     AF RDS. Contact supporting records professionals.
     1.3.3. Unless specified, the examinee or FE may fly in any flight position/seat which will
     best enable the FE to conduct a thorough evaluation.
     1.3.4. The FE will brief the examinee on the purpose of the evaluation and how it will be
     conducted prior to flight. The examinee will accomplish required flight planning in
     accordance with the flight position during the evaluation. Higher Headquarters FEs (and unit
     FEs as determined locally) may assist in mission planning/briefing as tasked and will be
     furnished a copy of necessary mission data, mission materials, and data transfer cartridge
     loads.
     1.3.5. Required areas are shown in Table 2.1. When it is impossible to evaluate a required
     area in flight, it may be evaluated by an alternate method (i.e., ATD, or by a verbal
     examination) in order to complete the evaluation. Initial qualification checkrides that do not
     complete required items may use events from the previous sortie if flown with a FE to
     complete a checkride. The reason why required area(s) were not evaluated in-flight and the
     alternate method of evaluation used will be documented in the Comments portion of the AF
     Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification.
     1.3.6. FEs, during any phase of the evaluation, may require the examinee to
     demonstrate/instruct and/or present verbal explanation of performance computations, system
     operation, or procedures and techniques. FEs will exercise sound judgment to ensure oral
     questions are comprehensive and pertinent to the crewmember’s duties and responsibilities
     and will not interfere with normal mission accomplishment.
     1.3.7. The FE will thoroughly debrief all aspects of the evaluation. This debrief will include
     the examinee's overall rating, specific deviations, area grades assigned (if other than
     qualified) and any required additional training.
AFI11-2B-2V2 7 AUGUST 2009                                                                      5


     1.3.8. If an actual emergency occurs, only the initial reaction will be evaluated. Evaluator
     discretion will be used to determine when to terminate an evaluation.
1.4. Grading Instructions. Standards and performance parameters are contained in AFI 11-
202V2 and this instruction.
     1.4.1. The FE will base tolerances for in-flight parameters on conditions of smooth air and a
     stable aircraft. Do not consider momentary deviations from tolerances, provided the
     examinee applies prompt corrective action and such deviations do not jeopardize flying
     safety. The FE will consider cumulative deviations when determining the overall grade.
     1.4.2. When grading criteria requires a specific airspeed/angle of attack (AOA) be evaluated
     and the flight manual lists only a minimum/maximum/recommended airspeed/AOA for that
     area, the desired airspeed/AOA will be briefed by the examinee.
     1.4.3. The FE will compare examinee performance for each area accomplished during the
     evaluation with the standards provided in this volume and assign an appropriate grade for the
     area. Derive the overall flight evaluation grade from the area grades based on a composite
     for the observed events and tasks IAW this instruction.
        1.4.3.1. FEs will use the grading criteria in this volume to determine individual area
        grades. FE judgment must be exercised when the wording of areas is subjective and
        when specific situations are not covered.
        1.4.3.2. If the examinee receives an unqualified area grade in any of the critical areas
        identified by this volume, an overall qualification level of “Q-3” will be assigned.
        1.4.3.3. FE judgment will be the determining factor in arriving at the overall grade.
        1.4.3.4. The following general criteria apply during all phases of flight except as noted
        for specific events and instrument final approaches:

Table 1.1. General Criteria.
Q          Altitude                +/- 200 feet
           Airspeed                +/- 5%
           Course                  +/- 5 degrees/3 NM (whichever is greater)
           Tactical Air            +/- 2 NM
           Navigation
           (TACAN) Arc
           Fix-to-Fix              < 2 NM
Q-         Altitude                +/- 300 feet
           Airspeed                +/- 10%
           Course                  +/- 10 degrees/5 NM (whichever is greater)
           TACAN Arc               +/- 3 NM
           Fix-to-Fix              > 2 NM
U                                  Exceeded Q- limits
1.5. Emergency Procedures/ATD Evaluation. If available and configured appropriately, the
Weapons System Trainer (WST) should be used to conduct the requisite EPE. Note: For
evaluations conducted in the WST, tolerances from Table 1.1 for both Q and Q- criteria are
increased by a factor of 50%. If the WST is unavailable, the EPE will be given verbally. This
 6                                                              AFI11-2B-2V2 7 AUGUST 2009


evaluation will include areas commensurate with the examinee's mission status (Combat Mission
Ready [CMR] or Basic Mission Capable [BMC]).
     1.5.1. The following items are required on all emergency procedure evaluations:
        1.5.1.1. Emergency Procedures. Evaluate a minimum of two emergency procedures per
        phase of flight to include weapons delivery (i.e., pre-flight, takeoff, cruise and landing).
        All Bold Face will be evaluated.
        1.5.1.2. Aircraft General Knowledge.
        1.5.1.3. Unusual Attitude Recoveries.
        1.5.1.4. Crew Coordination.
     1.5.2. All INSTM/QUAL EPEs will include the following additional items:
        1.5.2.1. AFMAN 11-217, Instrument Flight Procedures.
        1.5.2.2. Alternate/divert airfields. Evaluate a minimum of one approach at other than
        home base.
     1.5.3. All Mission (MSN) EPEs will include the following items (tailor MSN evaluation
     scenarios to unit tasking/mission). Optional for BMC and Basic Aircraft Qualification
     (BAQ) aircrew EPEs.
        1.5.3.1. Weapons system operation.
        1.5.3.2. Electronic attack (EA)/Electronic Protection (EP)/All Aspect Missile Defense
        (AAMD).
        1.5.3.3. Evasive action/Threat Reaction.
        1.5.3.4. Weapons employment and switchology.
     1.5.4. Examinees receiving an overall unqualified grade will be placed in supervised status
     until recommended additional training is completed and/or a reevaluation is successfully
     accomplished.      Examinees receiving an overall unqualified grade because of an
     unsatisfactory CAP accomplishment will not be permitted to fly until a successful
     reevaluation is accomplished. For EPEs in which the examinee is qualified, but requires
     additional training, the FE will indicate whether the additional training will be accomplished
     before the next flight. Additional training and reevaluations will be accomplished IAW AFI
     11-202V2.
     1.5.5. Normally, an EPE will be a combined INSTM/QUAL/MSN. In the event the flight
     evaluation is a nuclear mission the EPE will be conventional and vice versa.
     1.5.6. The following grading criteria will be used to grade individual items on EPEs:
        1.5.6.1. Q. Performance is correct. Quickly recognizes and corrects errors.
        1.5.6.2. Q-. Performance is safe, but indicates limited proficiency. Makes errors of
        omission or commission.
        1.5.6.3. U. Performance is unsafe or indicates lack of knowledge or ability.
1.6. Examinations:
AFI11-2B-2V2 7 AUGUST 2009                                                                   7

                                            Chapter 2

                                EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS

2.1. General.
     2.1.1. All evaluations will follow the guidelines set in AFI 11-202V2.
     2.1.2. Required areas for flight evaluations are shown in Table 2.1. For CMR aircrew and
     instructors to complete an evaluation, all areas annotated with an “R” must be accomplished.
     BMC aircrew will only be evaluated on those missions routinely performed and in those
     areas which they are qualified to perform unsupervised. For efficiency, strive to complete all
     evaluation requirements on one flight.
     2.1.3. Performance and Planning Data. Examinee will be graded on the performance data
     actually used for takeoff.
     2.1.4. Preplanned Mission Data. If any portion of mission data is “canned” by appropriate
     staff agencies for crew use, that portion of the data will not be graded under “mission
     planning”. In the event that any mission data was derived by use of a command computer
     product, the crewmember will be responsible for the mission parameters initially input to the
     computer by the crewmember. The pilot in command (Mission Commander/Instructor Pilot
     (MC/IP) for/instructor evaluations; FE for pilot evaluations) is ultimately responsible to
     insure data used in the aircraft is accurate and affords effective mission accomplishment.
     2.1.5. Publications Check. Publications that will be checked are:
        2.1.5.1. T.O. 1B-2-1.
        2.1.5.2. T.O. 1B-2-1CL-1.
        2.1.5.3. T.O. 1B-2-34-1-1CL-1.
        2.1.5.4. Local In-flight Guide.
        2.1.5.5. Any additional publications issued to aircrews and specified in the unit
        addendum to AFI11-202V2.
     2.1.6. Cockpit/Crew Resource Management (CRM). In accordance with AFI 11-290,
     Cockpit/Crew Resource Management, CRM skills will be evaluated during all evaluations.
     CRM skills are integral to all phases of flight and are embedded within specific grading
     criteria. Therefore, no specific evaluation criteria area titled CRM exists.
     2.1.7. Normally, the INSTM/QUAL evaluation and the MSN evaluation will be combined as
     a single evaluation. Evaluations flown in this manner must fulfill all current INSTM/QUAL
     and MSN evaluation requirements, including ground phase requisites. For combined
     MSN/INSTM/QUAL evaluations, one EPE may be accomplished that encompasses
     requirements of both EPEs. Additional simulator time may be required to complete these
     items.
2.2. Instrument/Qualification Evaluation. A mission flown according to instrument flight
rules (to the maximum extent practical) best fulfills the objective of the INSTM/QUAL
evaluation.
AFI11-2B-2V2 7 AUGUST 2009                                                                     9


   2.2.1. Minimum ground phase requisites are:
       2.2.1.1. Instrument examination.
       2.2.1.2. Closed and open book qualification examinations.
       2.2.1.3. EPE/ATD.
       2.2.1.4. BOLD FACE Exam.
   2.2.2. Air work/Advanced Handling/Tactical Maneuvering. (WST Only) This area will be
   used for evaluating specific flight characteristics demonstration maneuvers. The pilot and
   mission commander must each demonstrate the ability to safely accomplish the required
   maneuvers in accordance with the procedures and limitations outlined in the flight manual
   and governing directives.
   2.2.3. Emergency Traffic Patterns:
       2.2.3.1. The simulated engine loss must be given during level flight with sufficient time
       provided to allow completion of the emergency procedures checklist prior to final
       approach. Simulated engine out go-arounds may be accomplished in the WST per Table
       2.1.
       2.2.3.2. The following emergency procedures are required:
          2.2.3.2.1. Simulated single engine out approach/go (WST only).
          2.2.3.2.2. Simulated two engines out approach/go (WST only).
   2.2.4. Touch-and-Go Required for all qualification evaluations.
2.3. Mission Evaluation. MSN evaluation will be flown IAW current tactics, unit tasking and
theater Area of Responsibility scenarios and will incorporate all appropriate evaluation
requirements from Table 2.1. Mission evaluations will reflect real-world threats and threat
avoidance to the greatest extent possible; weather and flight conditions permitting. These
evaluations will demonstrate the individual’s ability to accomplish any unit combat tasking to
include special missions. The crewmember will demonstrate defensive/evasive action bombing
and Emission Control (EMCON) to the maximum extent possible. On missions when Special
Mission Instructions (SPINS) are not available or used, use command guidance from appropriate
regulations. MSN evaluations will normally be flown using established tactics, techniques, and
procedures, and in accordance with published unit standards. Evaluations during exercises or
exercise deployments are encouraged. Evaluations during contingency/combat deployments will
be given as a last resort in order to maintain miss ion qualification status. Note: BMC aircrew
will only be evaluated on those missions routinely performed. Examinees will only be evaluated
on those areas for which they are qualified.
   2.3.1. Air Refueling. The air refueling evaluation will include air refueling communication,
   rendezvous (point parallel or en route), aircraft control, descent, contact, fuel management
   and transfer, visual signals (may be done orally if necessary), post refueling, and breakaway
   (air refueling practice emergency separation procedures must be initiated with the receiver in
   the refueling envelope).
       2.3.1.1. Refueling may be day or night and there are no weight requirements. Boom
       Limit demonstrations should be accomplished during day refueling.

       2.3.1.2. Air refueling tracks should be of sufficient length to allow 30 minutes of air
       refueling. Deviations from this requirement are permissible when tanker/receiver
       formation ratio or length of the published air refueling track prohibits compliance.
       2.3.1.3. Ten minutes of contact time (initial qual checks 15 minutes) must be completed
       within 30 minutes after initial pre-contact position.
   2.3.2. Weapons Employment. As a minimum, a single nuclear bomb run or single
   conventional weapon release/bomb run should be accomplished.
       2.3.2.1. The intent is to schedule and demonstrate procedures and techniques for a mixed
       load of weapons. However, the evaluation may be completed when any type bomb
       run/weapon release is accomplished. Each bomb run/weapon release must result in a
       simulated/actual release of a weapon. Alternate methods of bombing may be used as
       equipment malfunctions dictate and will satisfy the requirements of the evaluation.
       Accomplish bomb run/weapon release using delivery tactics as specified in Air Force
       Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (AFTTP) 3-1. When weather or equipment
       malfunctions preclude accomplishing low altitude bomb runs (if applicable) at TF
       clearance plane altitudes, the bomb runs may be completed at Instrument Flight Rules
       (IFR) altitude.
       2.3.2.2. Heading tolerances will be from mission directives (e.g., SPINS) or governing
       directives whichever is more restrictive. Heading must be evaluated at release of the first
       weapon by comparing the planned heading versus actual and Horizontal Situation
       Indicator (HIS) heading to ensure prescribed tolerances are met. Both lower and upper
       (if applicable) altitude parameters for conventional weapons must be met. Airspeed will
       be graded through the release of all weapons.
2.4. Instructor Evaluation. Instructor evaluations will be conducted IAW AFI 11-202V2.
   2.4.1. All instructors/instructor candidates must be evaluated to determine judgment,
   technical knowledge, instructor ability (including error analysis of student activity), use of
   grading documents, and proficiency in their aircrew specialty. Instructors/instructor
   candidates must demonstrate their ability to instruct while performing all instructor
   proficiency items.
   2.4.2. Subsequent aircrew evaluations (i.e. INSTM/QUAL and MSN) will include instructor
   portions during the evaluations.
   2.4.3. Air Refueling. Receiver instructor pilots must demonstrate envelope limits.
   Inadvertent disconnect tolerances that would count toward an overall Air Refueling grade are
   not applicable during demonstration of boom envelope limits. Contact time may be reduced
   to 5 minutes excluding the time required to demonstrate boom envelope limits.
   2.4.4. Instructor Demonstrations. All special maneuvers will be evaluated in flight on initial
   instructor evaluations.
   2.4.5. FTU and Weapons Instructor Course (WIC) Mission Evaluations. USAF Weapon
   School (USAFWS) and FTU Instructor Pilot mission evaluation profiles will normally be
   IAW the formal course syllabus for any MSN which the IP is qualified to instruct. The only
   required items for an FTU or WIC IP mission check are those items required by the syllabus,
   for the specific sortie being flown.
AFI11-2B-2V2 7 AUGUST 2009                                                                        11


2.5. Difference Requirements (If Applicable). Individuals qualifying in a different area,
tactic, weapon, or weapon system must complete the training required by governing directives
and receive a Difference Certificate. If appropriate, prior to receipt of a difference certification,
the individual must complete emergency procedures and qualification examinations covering the
new items and demonstrate proficiency to a qualified instructor pilot. A weapon preflight may
be required for any changes in unit tasking. If an in-flight evaluation is required, a new AF Form
8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification, will be completed. If an in-flight evaluation is not
required, certify individual’s new qualification level on unit Letter of X’s and individual’s
training folder, as appropriate.
2.6. Dual Seat Qualification (If Applicable). Dual-seat qualified mission commanders will
take their recurring evaluations in the right seat.

                                 EVALUATION CRITERIA

3.1. General Grading Standards:
   3.1.1. The grading criteria in this chapter are divided into three sections: General,
   Instrument, and Tactical Employment. Use all sections for criteria applicable to the events
   performed on the evaluation.
   3.1.2. Areas marked (MC) are for mission commanders and areas marked (P) are for pilots
   only. All other areas are common to all aircrews.
   3.1.3. Where major areas are divided into subareas, only one grade will be assigned to the
   major areas. Discrepancies on the back of the AF Form 8 will be annotated by subarea.
3.2. General:
   3.2.1. Area 1--Flight Publications:
      3.2.1.1. Q. Assigned flight publications were current and contained only minor
      annotation or filing discrepancies.
      3.2.1.2. Q-. Assigned flight publications contained deviations, omissions and /or errors.
      However, they contained the information necessary for effective mission accomplishment
      of all phases of the mission and did not compromise safety of flight.
      3.2.1.3. U. Contained major deviations, omissions and/or errors. Required information
      was not available. Note: The mission commander is responsible for compliance with the
      compartment requirement of AFI 11-215 and command supplements, and will be graded
      appropriately if non-compliant.

      File (FCIF)/Read Files.
      3.2.2.2. Q-. Same as above, except minor deviations, omissions, and/or errors that did
      not detract from mission effectiveness. Knowledge of performance capabilities or
      approved operating procedures/ rules was marginal in some areas.
      3.2.2.3. U. Major deviations, omissions, and/or errors that would preclude safe or
      effective mission accomplishment. Displayed faulty knowledge of operating data or
      procedures. Did not sign off FCIF prior to flight.
   3.2.3. Area 3--Briefing:
      3.2.3.1. Organization:
          3.2.3.1.1. Q. Well organized and presented in a logical sequence.           Concluded
          briefing in time to allow for formation briefing (if applicable).
14                                                            AFI11-2B-2V2 7 AUGUST 2009


         3.2.3.1.2. Q-. Events out of sequence, hard to follow, some redundancy.
         3.2.3.1.3. U. Disorganized. Illogical sequence during presentation caused confusion.
         Did not allow time for formation briefing (if applicable).
     3.2.3.2. Presentation:
         3.2.3.2.1. Q. Presented briefing in a professional manner, well organized and in a
         logical sequence. Flight/crew members clearly understood mission requirements.
         3.2.3.2.2. Q-. Dwelled on non-essential mission items.
         3.2.3.2.3. U. Presentation created doubts or confusion.
     3.2.3.3. Mission Objectives:
         3.2.3.3.1. Q. Established objectives for the mission. Presented all training events
         and effectively addressed methods for accomplishing the mission.
         3.2.3.3.2. Q-. Objectives undefined and poorly quantified. Omitted minor training
         events. Limited discussion of techniques.
         3.2.3.3.3. U. Did not establish objectives for the mission. Omitted major training
         events or did not discuss techniques.
     3.2.3.4. Flight/Crew Member Consideration:
         3.2.3.4.1. Q. Considered the abilities of all flight/crew members. Briefed corrective
         action from previous mission and probable problem areas when appropriate.
         3.2.3.4.2. Q-. Did not consider all flight/crew members’ abilities. Did not identify
         possible problem areas.
         3.2.3.4.3. U. Ignored flight/crew members’ abilities and past problem areas.
  3.2.4. Area 4--Pre-Takeoff: (Includes all activity up to crossing the hold line).
     3.2.4.1. Q. Established and adhered to station, start engine, taxi times to assure thorough
     preflight, check of personal equipment, crew briefing, etc. Performed all checks and
     procedures prior to takeoff in accordance with approved checklists and applicable
     directives. Deviations occurred as a result of moving to another piece of equipment
     while awaiting timeout.
     3.2.4.2. Q-. Minor deviations, omissions, and/or errors occurred which did not detract
     from mission effectiveness or performance and/or knowledge was the minimum
     acceptable and indicated a definite need for assigned study and/or additional training.
     3.2.4.3. U. Omitted major item(s) of the appropriate checklist. Major deviations in
     procedure, which would preclude safe mission accomplishment. Failed to accurately
     determine readiness of aircraft for flight. Crew errors directly contributed to a late
     takeoff, which degraded the mission or made it non-effective.
  3.2.5. Area 5--Takeoff. Includes all activity from initiation of takeoff checklist up to and
  including establishing climb configuration and airspeed.
     3.2.5.1. Q. Accomplished prescribed procedures and checklists in accordance with the
     flight manual and governing directives. Smooth aircraft control throughout takeoff.

     over control at liftoff.
     3.2.5.3. U. Lift-off potentially dangerous. Exceeded aircraft/systems limitations. Failed
     to establish proper climb attitude. Over-controlled aircraft resulting in excessive
     deviations from intended flight path.
  3.2.6. Area 6--Departure:      (Includes the portion of flight after establishing climb
  configuration and airspeed up to, but not including, level-off.)
     3.2.6.1. Q. Performed departure as published/directed and complied with all restrictions.
     Accomplished procedures and checklists required by the flight manual and governing
     directives accurately and efficiently.
     3.2.6.2. Q-. Minor deviations in airspeed and navigation occurred during completion of
     departure. Minor omissions, deviations, and/or errors in procedures detracted from
     overall mission efficiency.
     3.2.6.3. U. Failed to comply with published/directed departure instructions. Major
     omissions, deviations, and/or errors in procedures.
  3.2.7. Area 7--Level-off. This area does not include level-offs during instrument departures,
  penetrations, en route descents and traffic patterns.
     3.2.7.1. Q. Leveled off smoothly. Promptly established proper cruise airspeed.
     3.2.7.2. Q-. Level-off was erratic. Slow in establishing proper cruise airspeed.
