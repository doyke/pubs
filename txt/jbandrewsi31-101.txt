1.1. Mission.
   1.1.1. The 11 Security Forces (SF) Group (SFG)/S2 Threat Analysis Cell (TAC) and the
   Threat Working Group’s (TWG) mission is to provide threat based information and
   intelligence in support of Protection Level (PL) resources regarding current world conditions,
   enemy readiness, potential terrorists and projected changes, if available.
1.2. Purpose.
   1.2.1. The purpose of intelligence collection and briefings is to provide information to 11
   SFG/CC, 11 WG/CC and Crisis Action Team (CAT), to assist in responding to threats
   against PL resources.
   1.2.2. Standard intelligence methods will be in effect. The Threat Analysis Cell (TAC) will
   be prepared to operate on a 24- hour basis to analyze and disseminate pertinent message
   traffic. Intelligence will be obtained from higher headquarters or through local threat
   working groups. All intelligence will be processed through the TWG and briefed with
   recommendations to the Installation Defense Council (IDC), CAT, 11 SFG/CC or 11 WG/CC
   as appropriate.
1.3. Responsibilities.
   1.3.1. Security Forces S-2/Threat Analysis Cell:
   1.3.2. The TAC is the point of contact within the SFG for Force Protection information
   dissemination to the Defense Force Commander (DFC), from AFDW/A2 and Air Force
   Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) 7 FIS. Personnel assigned to the TAC will be a
   minimum grade of E5 or GS-7 and possess a TS/SCI clearance. These personnel should be
   read in to SI/TK/HCS/G programs to ensure full knowledge of intelligence sources of
   information.
   1.3.3. Coordinates and facilitates all threat fusion operations to support the DFC, as required.
   At a minimum, the TAC will participate in the threat fusion meeting between AFOSI and
   AFDW/A2.       Ensure Suspicious Activity Reports (SAR) or similar information is
   disseminated appropriately.
   1.3.4. Monitors law enforcement data, to include data in the Security Forces Management
   Information System (SFMIS), for threat information. S-2 personnel will ensure law
   enforcement information is incorporated into the threat and analysis process. Analytical
   efforts will focus on identifying current and emerging actors that pose a threat to JBA
   interests in order to obtain a comprehensive threat picture which includes LE threat
   information with a Department of Defense (DOD) nexus.
   1.3.5. Ensure SF generated reports, blotters, SALUTEs, AARs, SITREPs, field interview
   cards, and debriefings are incorporated into analytical products for dissemination.
   1.3.6. Support SF and other investigations (when requested) with crime analysis techniques
   and processes.

     1.3.7. In cooperation with AFOSI, coordinate the exchange of general crime activity and
     trend data with other non-DOD federal/regional/local law enforcement agencies. Ensuring
     strong relationships with these organizations and agencies will facilitate increased
     coordination and information exchange.        Information exchange must comply with
     Intelligence Oversight (IO) guidance, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
     (HIPAA), and Privacy Act provisions should be reviewed by the JA as required.
     1.3.8. Ensure relevant information and intelligence is disseminated promptly to ID forces, to
     include briefing at guardmount at least monthly or as necessary.
     1.3.9. Identify, validate, and prioritize information requirements originated by the DFC. Use
     unit Commander’s Priority Intelligence Requirements (PIRs) (Attachment 2 to this
     instruction) to determine the type of information required for known threats that may affect
     friendly forces and mission success.
1.4. AFOSI.
     1.4.1. AFOSI 7 FIS will be responsible for counter-intelligence activities and for reporting
     local terrorism, subversion, sabotage and espionage threats to the, 11 WG/CC, DFC, and 11
     MSG/CC.

     Requirements (PIR), or as warranted such as the situational awareness bulletins.
     1.7.5. AFDW/A2 will also produce a weekly classified world-wide situational intelligence
     beacon that is posted on the SIPR SharePoint hosted by Intelink.
1.8. Potential Violent Offender Watchlist (PVOWL).
     1.8.1. The PVOWL promotes the pre-identification of those few people who have a
     substantial potential to harm others (e.g., active shooter, lethal domestic).
     1.8.2. PVOWL will pre-identify those few personnel who are a substantial risk of harm to
     others. Once pre-identified, Security Forces will take a variety of actions depending on the
     threat. For example, they may develop safety plans with the potential targets of violence,
     increase patrols in the vicinity of the PVO’s residence or workplace, conduct rehearsals with
     the emergency services team, meet with the chain of command, etc. Security Forces, chain
     of command and mental health are critical participants in the PVOWL process.
     1.8.3. Road Map: Incident occurs/information is received that identifies an individual as a
     potential violent offender. Gather information from individual’s unit such as medical/mental
     health history (the screening tool can be used, see Discharge Checklist section).
     Coordination and information gathering occurs between AFOSI, 11 SFG Threat Analysis
     Cell, 11 SFS Investigations, Family Advocacy and local authorities. Add individual to
     PVOWL (PVOWL Board will convene quarterly). For any emergent/emergency situations,
     the Potential for Violent Offender Working Group (PVOWG) will be convened as soon as
     needed. The PVOWG will consist of a representative from 11 SFG, 11 SFS, 11 WG/SJA,
     779 MDG/Mental Health, OSI and a member of the individual’s unit. Action: Implement
     appropriate countermeasures. This can be as simple as increasing patrol awareness or as
     significant as immediately moving a potential victim(s) to a safe house for their protection.
     A list of potential countermeasures is listed in 1.8.3.4.
JBANDREWSI31-101 18 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                              9


      1.8.3.1. An individual will be added to the PVOWL by the 11 SFS PVOWL Board after
      being notified of a potentially violent offender. The primary notification methods are
      notification from a First Sergeant/Commander, as part of the discharge process,
      notification from Mental Health, and any patrol response for domestic violence or threats
      to harm others.
      1.8.3.2. Once notified, the PVOWL Board will meet. The Board is comprised of the
      PVOWL Manager (Police Services), Operations NCO, Operations Superintendent,
      Operations Officer and 11th Security Forces Squadron Commander. The steps provided
      below will outline how a person may be added to PVOWL.
      1.8.3.3. The PVOWL Manager will bring appropriate information to the Board, to
      include: details of the event/cause for PVOWL consideration, results of a background
      check, and any appropriate mental health and/or threat information not contained in the
      background check. If the Board determines the individual should be added to the
      PVOWL, the Manager will create a six-part binder and immediately notify appropriate
      posts and patrols. Additionally, S2 will be notified and updates provided weekly at the
      SFG Staff Meeting. The six part folder will contain the following: Cover page: A brief
      synopsis of the incident, First Page: Update page annotated anytime folder is reviewed or
      edited, Second page:          All incidents reports/protective orders.      Third page:
      DBIDS/SFMIS report, Fourth page: Pictures of subject, home/office blue prints, vehicle
      registration information, Fifth page: Criminal history/NCIC print out and Sixth page:
      Miscellaneous information.
      1.8.3.4. Countermeasure Toolkits: Various countermeasures can be utilized and they
      include, safety plans for potential victims (at both the residence and/or work areas), chain
      of command briefings, be on the lookout (BOLO), publication/posting at all base entry
      points/Visitor Control Center, share information with civilian law enforcement agencies
      (if applicable), barment, increased patrols in residence/work areas, EST rehearsals,
      relocating potential victims to a safe house and/or civilian/military protective orders.
      1.8.3.5. Violent Offenders Watch-list Removal: When an individual is assessed to no
      longer pose a substantial risk of harm to others, they will be removed from the PVOWL.
      The same process to add someone to the PVOWL will be used to remove them from the
      PVOWL. The PVOWL Board will convene quarterly to review the active PVOWL. The
      Board will take into consideration actions taken by the individual after being placed on
      PVOWL. Any current criminal behavior will also be taken into consideration. The
      Board will also take into consideration any barments placed upon them or valid
      information the individual has left the local area or has PCS’d to another installation.
      Using any and all information on the individual, the board will make a determination for
      the individual to be removed from the active PVOWL effective immediately. Their file
      will be placed in the inactive file and maintained for three years. If there is no further
      incident involving the individual, the file will then be destroyed.
1.9. Screening for Discharged Military Members.
   1.9.1. Two of the top security concerns we are addressing here at Joint Base Andrews are
   lethal domestic and active shooter events. While they are extremely rare, history indicates
   these events will be preceded by warning indicators. For the Air Force, our worst active
   shooter event was perpetrated by an Airman discharged for mental health concerns just
10                                                 JBANDREWSI31-101 18 SEPTEMBER 2014


  months prior. As a result, all military members being discharged administratively will be
  briefly screened as a part of the JA Discharge Checklist.
  1.9.2. For 11th Wing personnel being discharged through the administrative discharge
  process, the screening process will involve First Sergeants, the 11th Wing Legal Office and
  the 11th Security Forces Squadron.
  1.9.3. First Sergeants duties will consist of:
     1.9.3.1. Coordinating with the member’s mental health provider to make sure that there
     is no serious and imminent threat from the member being discharged.
     1.9.3.2. If there are mental health concerns, prepare a Mental Health Records request
     (Attachment 3) so that the Squadron Commander of the member can request and receive
     relevant information that indicates the member is more likely to engage in violent
     activity, and turn over any positive indicators to the appropriate Security Forces
     personnel.
     1.9.3.3. Immediately contact 11th Security Forces Squadron Police Services to file a
     report if the member has made any threatening statements towards any person on any
     military installation or the United States Government. When making this report, the First
     Sergeant will consider the questions asked in the attached screening tool (Attachment 4)
     and will have the discretion to incorporate the answers to those questions into the report
     insofar as the answers are relevant.
  1.9.4. For tenant units/worldwide mission partners whose personnel are stationed at, or
  regularly visit, Joint Base Andrews, they will supply information regarding military members
  with mental health concerns to the 11 SFG/CC or designee so that a barment decision can be
  made. In those rare instances where sufficient indicators of violence are present, Security
  Forces and the chain of command will work together to minimize the threat. Additional
  agencies may also be included as appropriate.
JBANDREWSI31-101 18 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                               11

             SECURITY FORCES INVESTIGATIONS-POLICE SERVICES

2.1. Security Forces Investigations.
   2.1.1. Concept of Operations. Security Forces Investigations has the responsibility to
   investigate all crimes, offenses, and incidents falling within their jurisdiction as set forth in
   AFI 31-206/Attachment 2, when committed on JBA, MD; Brandywine Receiver Site,
   Brandywine, MD; and Davidsonville Receiver Site, Davidsonville, MD. When directed by
   the DFC, investigators may conduct off-base investigations of minor incidents involving
   military-connected personnel, in accordance with Article 2, UCMJ. Investigations will
   cooperate with civil police in investigations of off base incidents in which military personnel
   are involved. Investigators are authorized to carry concealed weapons in Maryland and
   surrounding states when conducting official business, as documented with an AF FM 523.
   2.1.2. The Installation Commander has the responsibility for referring all cases to AFOSI.
   Investigations is the point of contact for Security Force investigative matters with the
   Installation Commander; DFC; and AFOSI.
   2.1.3. The NCOIC, Investigations will ensure that:
       2.1.3.1. All completed investigative reports are forwarded to S5AR, after careful review.
       2.1.3.2. An Investigations case log is maintained.
       2.1.3.3. A secure evidence room, which will be used to store all real evidence, is
       maintained.
       2.1.3.4. Liaison is maintained with AFOSI, other investigative agencies, and all civilian
       police agencies in the local area.
       2.1.3.5. Assistance is provided to civil police agencies IAW AFI 51-1001, Delivery of
       Air Force Personnel to US Civilian Authorities for Trial and AFP 110-3, Civil Law, in
       serving warrants and subpoenas.
       2.1.3.6. An abandoned vehicle program is maintained.
       2.1.3.7. A Security Forces point of contact (POC) is designated for the Victim/Witness
       Program Council.
       2.1.3.8. Annotate and maintain permit numbers once an AF FM 523 is issued by DFC,
       granting investigator permission to carry their duty weapon in a concealed configuration.
       2.1.3.9. Safeguard, track and annotate the issuance or destruction of AF FM 688
       Investigator Credentials once issued by DFC.
   2.1.4. Investigators must ensure that:
       2.1.4.1. They investigate all cases when practical and feasible within a reasonable
       amount of time as monitored by the NCOIC, Investigations and the Reports and Analysis
       Section (S5A). When a case is predicted to take an inordinate amount of time to
       complete, telephonic updates will be provided to S5A to inform them of the estimated
       completion date.
 12                                             JBANDREWSI31-101 18 SEPTEMBER 2014


      2.1.4.2. When initiating a suspect/subject interview, document start/stop times and
      breaks via AF FM 3985/Interview Record.
      2.1.4.3. Following initial interviews, personnel who are subjects of an investigation are
      referred to their First Sergeant, Commander, or supervisor. These referrals must include
      person-to-person contact between investigations and unit personnel, and must be
      documented via DD FM 2708.
      2.1.4.4. If during any interview, the individual appears to be emotional, distraught,
      and/or stunned, he/she will not be allowed to depart alone and must be released
      personally to the first sergeant, commander, supervisor, or designee.
      2.1.4.5. In each case mentioned above, if a suspect has been read and invoked their
      Article 31 rights, inform the unit so they can avoid further questioning.
   2.1.5. Drug Cases.
      2.1.5.1. All cases involving drug abuse, possession, or use which are initiated or
      investigated by Investigations, the ranking investigator on scene will coordinate with
      AFOSI. All cases involving the simple use of drugs can be investigated by
      Investigations; however AFOSI should be notified immediately prior to initiating an
      investigation. All other drug cases should be referred to AFOSI immediately and a
      courtesy call should be made to the standby SF investigator. The AF Form 3545 should
      reflect this coordination and will record the AFOSI agent's name.
      2.1.5.2. Creation of a Joint Drug Enforcement Team (JDET). This is coordinated and
      initiated between DFC and AFOSI/Detachment Commander. This team consists of
      AFOSI agents and an SF Investigator detailed to AFOSI. The Investigations
      representative acts as the liaison between SF and AFOSI. The team is responsible for
      handling all abuse, possession or use of narcotics incidents and investigations.
   2.1.6. Evidence, Found & Abandoned Property Inventories. Inventories will be conducted
   quarterly. They will be conducted by at least two listed custodians and accomplished on all
   evidence, lost and found, and abandoned property to include abandoned vehicles. In case the
   two custodians are not available due to TDY’s, Leave, etc., one custodian and a neutral party,
   E-7 or above, may conduct the inventory. Any discrepancies will be identified to the DFC
   immediately.
2.2. Crime Prevention.
   2.2.1. Crime prevention is a pattern of attitudes and behaviors directed both at reducing the
   threat of crime and enhancing the sense of safety and security to improve the quality of life in
   our society and help develop environments where crime cannot flourish.
   2.2.2. The Air Force Vision. The goal of the Air Force crime prevention program is to
   eliminate or minimize the opportunity and desire to engage in criminal activities. Prevention
   and elimination of crime are quality of life issues.
   2.2.3. Crime prevention is more than a single focus, law enforcement effort. Effective crime
   prevention requires interaction among commanders, staff, officers, NCOs, Airmen, civilian
   employees, and dependents.
JBANDREWSI31-101 18 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                          13


  2.2.4. To have an effective program, clearly describe and widely publicize crime prevention
  objectives, which include:
     2.2.4.1. Upgrade the protection of personnel and property by educating people to
     recognize and avoid situations in which they are likely to end up the victim of an assault
     or robbery. Encourage the installation to invest in better locks; stress the need for
     consistent use of existing locks and safeguards.
     2.2.4.2. Increase surveillance by encouraging residents and workers to challenge
     unidentified individuals in dormitory, housing, and work areas; establish neighborhood
     watch programs; encourage permanent marking of property.
         2.2.4.2.1. Achieve maximum involvement of the Air Force community and Security
         Forces in crime prevention activities.
         2.2.4.2.2. Crime prevention is everyone’s responsibility. All members of the base
         community must be convinced of the need to protect themselves, their
         neighborhoods, and work areas by supporting crime prevention goals.
  2.2.5. Connection to Integrated Defense. The Air Force Crime Prevention Program, by
  design, complements and works with the Integrated Defense concept. Achieve the goals of
  both programs through active participation of the total Air Force community.
     2.2.5.1. Role of Security Forces. The role of Security Forces, though pivotal to crime
     prevention, is that of an educational, technical, and supportive resource an "enabler or
     catalyst" rather than a "doer." The primary role of Security Forces law enforcement is
     that of installation entry control, preventive patrol, armed response, detection, and
     investigative services. Security Forces also provide equally important technical services
     such as physical security and resources protection. Security Forces must achieve and
     maintain proficiency in prevention and resource protection programs.
     2.2.5.2. Program Manager. The Crime Prevention Program is a function of Police
     Services in the S3 branch. The Installation Defensive Forces Commander selects an
     individual to manage resource protection and crime prevention functions. Installation
     Defensive Forces Commander focuses resources based on the installation’s requirements.
     The NCOIC, Police Services Branch, should attend course WCIP07A - Resource
     Protection/Crime Prevention Theory, Practice and Management, PDS Code 1F2.
     2.2.5.3. Considerations. Personnel selected for these positions should have top oral and
     written communication skills, have the flexibility to work with both young and mature
     groups, and be willing to work varied hours. Crime prevention specialists keep direct
     communication with law enforcement shifts, investigations, and reports and analysis, and
     should have access to operations and command leadership.
     2.2.5.4. Program Responsibilities. The following is a list of the types of crime
     prevention services the crime prevention program manager may choose to provide for the
     installation:
         2.2.5.4.1. Establish installation-wide crime prevention programs. This would include
         assessing needs, identifying problems, establishing objectives, coordinating training,
         and managing program implementation. It further includes providing continuing
14                                            JBANDREWSI31-101 18 SEPTEMBER 2014


         analysis, program revision, and community-wide crime prevention consultation
         services.
         2.2.5.4.2. Use crime statistics to examine crime patterns. Use analyzed data to
         determine strategies for employment of crime-risk management, as well short- and
         long-term crime prevention to fight local crime problems.
         2.2.5.4.3. Provide crime trend data to unit commanders, law enforcement, and other
         interested base agencies. Security Forces use this information to determine selective
         enforcement techniques and element-level crime prevention techniques.
         2.2.5.4.4. S3I will work with 11 WG/PA to develop and implement a media
         campaign to publicize the base crime prevention program, prevailing crime problems,
         and disseminate command leadership’s proposed measures to counter these problems.
         2.2.5.4.5. Conduct speaking engagements to promote crime prevention goals. Use
         Commander's Calls, First Sergeant briefs, social activities, youth gatherings, spouses’
         club meetings, school visitations, etc.
         2.2.5.4.6. Participate in community projects that foster joint police and community
         efforts; for example, Operation Identification, neighborhood watch, crime stop, and
         crime hazard reporting. Determine the effectiveness of each program.
         2.2.5.4.7. Conduct citizen awareness programs that educate the military community
         on the crime risks they face. Emphasize specific problems and precautions to protect
         themselves and their property.
         2.2.5.4.8. Provide crime prevention statistics, rates and trend analysis to members of
         the Installation Defense Council (IDC). Implement programs identified by the IDC.
         2.2.5.4.9. Assist in formulating youth activity programs and selecting volunteers to
         act as youth leaders and advisors in youth programs.
         2.2.5.4.10. Conduct on-base residential, dormitory, and work area crime prevention
         surveys for occupants and organizations.
         2.2.5.4.11. Request and distribute crime prevention literature and forms to promote
         crime prevention programs.
         2.2.5.4.12. Maintain close liaison with civilian organizations and authorities on crime
         prevention programs. Where possible, set up joint programs to promote military and
         civilian community involvement and combat mutual crime problems. Participate in
         local, state, and federal crime prevention activities that benefit the military
         community.
         2.2.5.4.13. Encourage unit commanders to establish crime prevention programs
         within their unit and suggest they designate a focal point to coordinate program
         activities within the unit.
  2.2.6. Basic Crime Prevention Programs. As a primary source of information on crime
  patterns, Security Forces should provide guidance to the community on prevailing kinds of
  crime and the specific mode of operation used by criminals. Each base has its own unique
  community environment and crime prevention needs. Some successful programs help
  prevent the most prevalent types of crime occurring on JB Andrews, including:
JBANDREWSI31-101 18 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                          15


     2.2.6.1. Operation Crime Stop. An essential element of crime prevention is the prompt
     and accurate reporting of imminent crime situations or criminal acts. Some people will
     report their observations to police only when they know they can remain anonymous.
     Operation Crime Stop helps overcome reluctance to become involved with Security
     Forces by providing a single telephone line for crime reporting while allowing witnesses
     to remain anonymous. Crime Stop provides a safe way to report suspected or actual
     crimes anonymously. Anonymous crime reports can include domestic violence,
     suspicious activity, threatening acts or behavior, possession of weapons and or the use or
     sale of illegal drugs.
        2.2.6.1.1. Units may install a dedicated Crime Stop telephone at the Base Defense
        Operations Center (BDOC), capable of receiving calls from both on and off base,
        with a single number dedicated to Crime Stop reporting. Advertise the purpose of the
        dedicated line and the ability to remain anonymous. Distribute Crime Stop reporting
        materials to other unit personnel and encourage their support of the program. Bases
        having access to either 911 or Enhanced 911 (E911 provides automatic caller ID)
        Emergency Reporting Systems may elect to use that system instead.
        2.2.6.1.2. Log each Crime Stop call on an AF Form 53, Security Forces Desk Blotter.
        Begin each entry with "Crime Stop" to aid in statistical retrieval.
     2.2.6.2. Crime Hazard Identification Program. One goal of crime prevention is to
     identify, report, and eliminate as many crime hazards as possible, and thus reduce the
     opportunity for crime.
        2.2.6.2.1. Security Forces and base-level crime prevention program managers may
        solicit and issue Crime Hazard Reports to commanders and agency chiefs for
        corrective actions.
        2.2.6.2.2. Crime Hazard Reminder. Security Forces should leave crime hazard
        reminders when they discover insecure vehicles, office areas, equipment, or
        unattended property.
     2.2.6.3. Citizen Awareness Program. The thrust of this program is to educate the base
     community on crime prevention. Base newspapers and other media are good ways to get
     the word out on typical crimes, victims, and offenders. Additionally, the installation
     crime prevention program manager may brief all newly assigned personnel on the local
     crime program, with an emphasis on precautions to avoid becoming victims of crime.
     Maintaining open communication with 11 WG/PA allows for faster and accurate means
     of using base publications and social media within their purview.
     2.2.6.4. Community Oriented Policing (COP). COP techniques are used to show a law
     enforcement presence and create a working relationship with the residents or employees
     of the installation. These can include, bike patrol, walking a beat or conducting random
     checks of business and workplaces during duty hours. Getting out and talking to people
     creates a bond of trust between Security Forces and the base populace, enabling greater
     awareness of crime trends and problems before they become a larger issue.
     2.2.6.5. Military Working Dogs (MWDs). MWDs are great deterrents to crime. Article
     in the local news media announcing their presence and capabilities serve to increase
     public awareness and acceptance. Coordinate with 11 WG/PA for development of news
16                                           JBANDREWSI31-101 18 SEPTEMBER 2014


     releases to promote local MWD program to avoid revealing precise tactics or details of
     operations.
     2.2.6.6. Selective Enforcement.   Selective enforcement focuses Security Forces
     manpower on local crime and incident problems. It is based on accurate analysis of the
     time, place, type, and frequency of incidents or violations. The crime prevention
     program manager tabulates information from complaints, and reports of offenses and
     vehicle accidents.
         2.2.6.6.1. A good analysis of this information will show the underlying conditions or
         behaviors that need to be corrected. In many instances, selective assignment of
         Security Forces may be an effective solution. Crime prevention program managers
         provide their analysis to the operations flight leadership for patrol activity
         consideration.
         2.2.6.6.2. Before applying selective enforcement to correct a traffic problem, the
         analysis should consider whether other solutions would be more effective. For
         example, analysis may show that the best way to cut accidents at a particular
         intersection is to trim shrubbery, install a larger stop sign, or repaint the pavement
         markings. Repeated reports of speeding may require speed enforcement, along with
         the deterrence of a marked Security Forces vehicle.
     2.2.6.7. Physical Protection Surveys. Security Forces units may establish a program to
     offer physical protection surveys to residents of base housing, dormitories, and to
     supervisors of activities not normally inspected or surveyed under the resource protection
     program. These surveys educate personnel about how to protect themselves and their
     property. The survey is a critical analysis of the physical protection of the facility.
     Coordinate surveys with AFOSI when done as part of the antiterrorism or Force
     Protection program. When feasible, the crime prevention program manager should
     consider using help from law enforcement specialists who normally patrol the area.
  2.2.7. Situational Crime Prevention. Other sources of crime prevention information include:
     2.2.7.1. The Crime Prevention Coalition of America (CPCA). The CPCA is a
     nonpartisan group of national, state, and federal organizations united to promote citizen
     action to prevent crime. The USAF is one of the original members of this broad-based,
     interdisciplinary group whose members represent youth development organizations,
     municipalities, health care providers, law enforcement, and federal and state
     organizations, to name a few.
     2.2.7.2. National Crime Prevention Council (NCPC). The NCPC is a nonprofit
     organization that acts as an advocate for crime prevention policies and programs
     throughout the nation. Its mission is to enable people to prevent crime and build safer
     communities. The NCPC Campaign is represented by the crime dog, McGruff, and the
     "Take a Bite Out of Crime" slogan. NCPC manages the day-to-day activities of the
     public service advertising campaign by providing the following services to coalition
     members:
         2.2.7.2.1. Develops materials, including posters, brochures, and books that help teach
         crime prevention skills to citizens of all ages.
JBANDREWSI31-101 18 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                            17


          2.2.7.2.2. Provides information, referral services, and technical assistance to people
          trying to enhance a crime prevention effort.
          2.2.7.2.3. Conducts training in crime prevention skills and techniques.
          2.2.7.2.4. Establishes demonstration programs and practical research to find the most
          effective ways to prevent crime.
      2.2.7.3. NCPC grants authorization to the USAF to reproduce NCPC-copyrighted
      material. Security Forces may adopt elements of the national program to meet local
      needs. For further information, contact the National Crime Prevention Council, 2345
      Crystal Drive, Suite 500, Arlington, VA, 22202, www.ncpc.org.
2.3. Corrections Operations.
   2.3.1. Concept of Operations. Joint Base Andrews does not have a corrections mission, but
   the Corrections NCO is still an important part of the corrections process. The Corrections
   NCO on Andrews is the liaison for all Air Force members assigned to the NCR. There is no
   permanent confinement facility on JBA, therefore all prisoners are transported to the Navy
   Consolidated Brig, Chesapeake, VA. IAW the MOA between Air Force Security Forces
   Center and Deputy Chief of Naval Personnel Commander, Navy Personnel Command US
   Navy.
   2.3.2. Prisoner Escort Rules. The following rules apply anytime a prisoner is escorted to a
   detention facility.
      2.3.2.1. As soon as it is known that the prisoner is to be confined, it should be assumed
      there is a risk of escape and/or suicide.
      2.3.2.2. Conduct a search of the prisoner’s person to ensure they have no weapons which
      could harm you. Keep in mind that pens, keys and other such items can be used as
      weapons.
      2.3.2.3. Always maintain direct observation and physical control of the prisoner.
      2.3.2.4. Prior to entering the vehicle, check the back seat for any items which could be
      used as weapons. While in the vehicle, one of the escorts will ride in the back seat of the
      car with the prisoner. The escort in the back seat will sit directly behind the driver and
      the prisoner will sit behind the empty seat. Ensure the prisoner wears a seatbelt.
      2.3.2.5. Do not allow anyone to have physical or verbal contact with the prisoner. No
      one gets between you and the prisoner.
      2.3.2.6. Everywhere the prisoner goes, the escort must go; this includes close visual
      supervision while using the latrine. Latrines should be checked prior to use. Look in
      trashcans, paper dispensers, or anywhere contraband may be concealed. Only after
      clearing the area should the prisoner be allowed to use the facility.
      2.3.2.7. Prisoner should be handcuffed behind the back and not released until in a secure
      area.
      2.3.2.8. Prior to departing the installation, landline the BDOC and advise the BDOC
      Operator you are departing. Ensure the BDOC Operator is provided with a good
      description of the prisoner, and all their pertinent information. Also, ensure you provide
 18                                              JBANDREWSI31-101 18 SEPTEMBER 2014


      a vehicle description, to include make, model, color and registration number. The BDOC
      Operator will contact the detention facility and advise them the transport/prisoner is on
      the way. The BDOC telephone number is 301-981-2001/2002/7222. DSN extension is
      858.
      2.3.2.9. If at any time during the transport the prisoner escapes, immediately notify the
      BDOC Operator. If the escape occurs while on Andrews, have one person (with radio)
      attempt to maintain contact with the escapee while the other person notifies the BDOC
      using 911 or 2911. This number is for emergencies only! Give the BDOC Operator the
      following information:
          2.3.2.9.1. Your exact location.
          2.3.2.9.2. Direction of travel of the prisoner.
          2.3.2.9.3. Mode of travel (foot or vehicle).
          2.3.2.9.4. Description of prisoner/vehicle.
          2.3.2.9.5. Exact time the prisoner escaped.
      2.3.2.10. In the event of an emergency that requires immediate armed intervention while
      off base, dial 911. This will alert civilian police to respond. Ensure you also notify the
      BDOC after calling 911. As soon as the prisoner is released to the detention facility,
      notify the BDOC by calling 301-981-2001/2002. Be prepared to give the date, time,
      location and the name of the individual you released the prisoner to.
   2.3.3. Transporting Military Personnel to Confinement Facility:
      2.3.3.1. When a military member is ordered into confinement, the confinement liaison
      will coordinate with AF corrections to determine what facility will be utilized for
      confinement. The applicable unit sponsoring the confined member will ensure all
      personal items needed for confinement are provided to the personnel at the confinement
      facility prior to incarceration.
      2.3.3.2. Two escorts must escort the detainee.
      2.3.3.3. All escorts (non-Security Forces) must be briefed on Prisoner Escort Rules.
2.4. Victim/Witness Assistance Program (VWAP).
   2.4.1. According to DoD Directive 1030.1, Victim and Witness Assistance; and DoDI
   1030.2, Victim and Witness Assistance Procedures, identification of victims and witnesses is
   the responsibility of the agency that investigates the crime, e.g., SF, OSI. This also applies to
   first responders. These two DoD publications and AFI 51-201, Administration of Justice,
   provide guidance on the implementation of these programs in the Air Force.
   2.4.2. Scope of VWAP. VWAP applies in all cases in which criminal conduct adversely
   affects victims or in which witnesses provide information regarding criminal activity. Pay
   special attention to victims of violent crime, but ensure all victims and witnesses of crime
   who suffer physical, financial or emotional trauma receive the assistance they are entitled to.
   2.4.3. SF Role in VWAP. SF are critical members of a multi-disciplinary team. As first
   responders and investigators, Security Forces members contribute to the success of other
   team members (e.g. OSI, SJA, Chaplains) who follow during resolution of the incident.
JBANDREWSI31-101 18 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                            19


  2.4.4. Security Forces goals in VWAP. Security Forces goals are more far-reaching than
  effective first response. They are:
     2.4.4.1. Immediate and permanent termination of the harmful act(s).
     2.4.4.2. Favorable resolution of the incident. Incidents are considered favorably resolved
     when offenders have been identified and held accountable, and the victim has been
     referred to the appropriate agencies for assistance in recovering from the incident.
     2.4.4.3. Recovery of the victim. Complete recovery from an incident is largely
     dependent on a victim’s willingness to participate in the recovery process. Although SF
     cannot do the actual recovery for the victim, they can ensure the victim is properly treated
     and informed about available resources.
     2.4.4.4. Providing Information. Every on-duty SF member must carry a supply of the
     DD Form 2701, Initial Information for Victims and Witnesses of Crime. Distribute the
     DD Form 2701 to any person meeting the requirements of paragraph 2.4.1. When in
     doubt as to whether a person meets the requirements to be issued a DD Form 2701, issue
     the form anyway. Annotate the AF Form 3545(A) or the SFMIS Report whenever a DD
     Form 2701 is issued. If no AF Form 3545(A) is completed, then the SF Blotter must
     annotate a DD Form 2701 was issued.
     2.4.4.5. Provide all victims with reasonable ideas for protection. Examples of reasonable
     ideas for protection would be properly securing homes, work places and property. For
     victims of domestic violence or abuse, staying with family members or friends would be
     an example of a reasonable idea for protection.
     2.4.4.6. Brief all victims and witnesses on the four phases of the judicial process
     (response, investigation, prosecution and confinement) and provide them with
     information on what may be expected from them during each phase.
  2.4.5. SF, in conjunction with the base SJA, develop a training syllabus for local use that
  includes those items unique to the base and local area as well as any state law and available
  resources that might apply to the victim (e.g. Status of Forces Agreements (SOFA), age of
  adults, etc.). This training applies to investigators and other Security Forces personnel as
  appropriate.
  2.4.6. If necessary, SF and AFOSI will provide protection or coordinate with other federal,
  state or local law enforcement authorities to protect the victim/witness. SF must notify the
  SJA when they identify a victim. This allows the SJA to administer the victim/witness
  assistance process.
  2.4.7. Units must "flag" incident reports to indicate it is a "victim/witness" case. Adding a
  prefix or suffix to the case number, aids in the SJA auditing process of victim/witness cases.
  2.4.8. Per DoDI 6495.02, Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Procedures, all SF
  personnel are required to complete initial and periodic training on responding to sexual
  assault incidents. The topics required to be covered in this training are listed in Enclosure.

                                           Chapter 3

                                  SECURITY CONSTABLE

3.1. The Installation Security Constable.
   3.1.1. The Installation Security Constable is a key player in an effective security education
   and training program which has direct impact on the security of USAF protection level
   resources. The Constable’s reach extends outside the restricted area to the controlled areas
   located around the installation that support protection level resources. Security awareness is
   paramount in providing protection for our resources.
   3.1.2. The Constable is an educator, motivator, public relations representative and
   professional who provides guidance and assistance. The 11 SSPTS/CC appoints the
   Installation Security Constable in writing and informs all commanders on the installation of
   the appointment. Duties are determined by the 11 SSPTS/CC to achieve the following
   minimum requirements:
3.2. Training.
   3.2.1. Phase I, Orientation Training. Conduct this training during indoctrination to the
   installation. NOTE: JBA accomplishes this via the newcomers’ in-brief. Proper
   documentation records reflecting date of completion must be maintained. If a non-US
   national normally works in a security support position, commanders must train an AF
   member to perform the function in an emergency.
   3.2.2. Phase II, Continuation Training. This training is tailored to the individual job and
   encompasses detection exercises in restricted and controlled areas.
3.3. Responsibilities.
   3.3.1. Installation Security Constable will perform the following duties:
       3.3.1.1. Communicate security policy and procedures, establish a relationship of trust
       with commanders across the entire installation and provide supervisors with support and
       guidance to educate and motivate their personnel.
       3.3.1.2. Ensure information is submitted to 11 WG/PA promptly for effective
       distribution to installation personnel through any visual media deemed appropriate by the
       11 SSPTS/CC.
       3.3.1.3. Conduct Phase I, Orientation Training during indoctrination to the installation.
       3.3.1.4. Document all training. As a minimum, maintain a list of all personnel who
       attended the training sessions for a period of one year. Sign-in sheets are the preferred
       method.
       3.3.1.5. Work closely with each unit to ensure they have current training materials and
       test to evaluate their personnel.
       3.3.1.6. Be constantly visible. Spend more time outside the normal security forces work
       center with serviced units.
JBANDREWSI31-101 18 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                           21


     3.3.1.7. Ensure Phase II, Continuation Training, is accomplished continuously. This
     includes detection exercises conducted on a recurring basis in restricted and controlled
     areas. This phase of training should focus on detection exercises and continued
     awareness briefings to unit personnel. The constable will work with unit security
     managers and unit training managers to ensure they have updated information in their
     respective programs.
        3.3.1.7.1. Senior Executive Training (SET) exercises should be designed to test the
        security awareness of non-security personnel assigned to controlled and restricted
        areas.
        3.3.1.7.2. Specific exercises to test the security awareness of security forces
        personnel should be coordinated with the security forces Standardization and
        Evaluation Section and meet the standards established by AFI 36-2646.
        3.3.1.7.3. Exercise objectives should never take precedence over safety of personnel,
        equipment or resources.
        3.3.1.7.4. Using actual perpetrators is authorized; however, exercise perpetrators
        WILL NOT simulate any action which could be interpreted as hostile.
        3.3.1.7.5. Additionally, perpetrators will explicitly follow all directions given by the
        exercise participants unless it causes a potential safety hazard or would violate the
        law.
        3.3.1.7.6. Consider implementing an exercise safety briefing.
        3.3.1.7.7. The exercise grading scale for use during SET exercises is based on a
        GO/NO GO system.
     3.3.1.8. Exercise failure procedures must be developed to ensure correct lessons are
     learned from the exercises being conducted. If a unit or work center fails a SET exercise,
     a re-evaluation with similar circumstances must be conducted after 30 days, but no longer
     than 60 days from the date of the failure. While it is realized that the same personnel
     may not be involved during the re-evaluation, exercise results and lessons learned should
     be shared by personnel throughout their organization.
     3.3.1.9. All SET exercises will be documented via formal report. Face-to-face de-
     briefings with exercise participants and supervisory personnel will always take place.
        3.3.1.9.1. All exercises will be tracked and logged on a locally developed exercise
        log. Annotate the time, date and location of the exercise.
        3.3.1.9.2. Additionally, a brief summary of the scenario, personnel involved and the
        outcome of the exercise will be included.
        3.3.1.9.3. Maintain a log of exercises by calendar year. SET exercise logs will be
        maintained for a period of one year after closeout.
     3.3.1.10. Written knowledge tests will be given on a random basis.
        3.3.1.10.1. Questions will be specific to restricted area security and separate
        questions for controlled area security as appropriate.
22                                             JBANDREWSI31-101 18 SEPTEMBER 2014


         3.3.1.10.2. Construct additional questions which apply to those non-security
         personnel who don’t work in restricted or controlled areas, but who require security
         awareness training.
  3.3.2. Security Managers will perform the following duties:
     3.3.2.1. Ensure they have updated and current training materials and test to evaluate their
     personnel.
     3.3.2.2. Tailor training to the specific duties of their work centers.
     3.3.2.3. Disseminate duress codes to personnel working in Restricted Areas in a timely
     manner.
     3.3.2.4. Document Phase II training on a locally devised form. When knowledge tests
     are administered as part of the training, document the number tested, number of failures
     and heavily missed items. Forward the information to Security Constable for trend
     information to tailor future briefings and exercise scenarios for personnel assigned to the
     work center.
JBANDREWSI31-101 18 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                            23


                                          Chapter 4

                                  CONTROLLED AREAS

4.1. General.
   4.1.1. The 11 WG/CC is ultimately responsible for all Controlled Areas. At JBA, this
   responsibility has been delegated to the owning unit commander.
   4.1.2. It is the owning commander’s responsibility to establish balanced needs for stringent
   entry controls against normal operational requirements and sensitivity of protected resources.
   Basic unescorted entry qualifications can range from local file checks to in-depth special
   investigations. Exception: AF/A2 establishes entry procedures for controlled areas
   containing Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities (SCIFs).
   4.1.3. Units requesting establishment of temporary controlled areas will submit a letter
   requesting the period of designation. Contact 11 SSPTS/S5R 60 days prior to the requested
   temporary controlled area start date to initiate process. Once notified, 11 SSPTS/S5R, in
   conjunction with CE personnel, will conduct an initial survey within two weeks, to determine
   if the proposed temporary controlled area meets protection requirements.
4.2. Procedures for Protection of Arms, Ammunition and Explosives (AA&E).
   4.2.1. Joint Base Andrews will keep only those munitions needed for mission requirements.
   Partner units that store items in the Nonnuclear Munitions Storage Area (NMSA) will follow
   the same security procedures as the 11 WG units. This includes conducting end of day cross
   checks with the BDOC upon completion of duty hours, submitting to resource protection
   surveys and penetration exercises, establishing Controlled Area monitors and contacting 11
   SSPTS/S5R prior to making physical changes that will affect the security of the facilities.
   4.2.2. When entering storage facilities at least one person will be armed with a 9 mm pistol
   and 30 rounds of ammunition. Personnel must arm up prior to entering the storage facility or
   immediately after entering.
   4.2.3. Changes in Risk Categories. 11 SSPTS/S5R will develop a munitions storage listing
   by structure that will be maintained at the BDOC and the NMSA.
   4.2.4. Sensitive Munitions Removed from NMSAs. Owner/user personnel will notify
   BDOC to inform them of pending munitions movements. Owner/user personnel trained on
   escort procedures by 11 SSPTS/S5R may provide their own escort. Training information
   will be part of the Controlled Area Folder and must be presented during the annual
   inspections by 11 SSPTS/S5R. When trained owner/user personnel are not available, 11
   SFG will provide an escort. Sensitive munitions must be continuously attended unless they
   are on an aircraft, installed for use, or located in approved storage areas. 11 SSPTS/S5R will
   develop and publish a munitions escort briefing guide that will be briefed by owner/user
   personnel prior to any movements. Briefing guide will include the following as a minimum:
      4.2.4.1. Primary and Alternate Routes.
      4.2.4.2. Safe Areas.
      4.2.4.3. Reaction to dangers.
24                                            JBANDREWSI31-101 18 SEPTEMBER 2014


     4.2.4.4. No radio transmissions within 100 feet of munitions.
     4.2.4.5. Phase lines/checkpoints for long routes (telephone communications with
     BDOC).
     4.2.4.6. Category I weapons will have a lead and trail escort vehicle.
     4.2.4.7. Other weapons movements will have a trail escort vehicle.
  4.2.5. Protection of Category I, II, and III Missiles and Rockets, and all Categories of
  Ammunition and Explosives in Bulk Storage Areas.              BDOC will make hourly
  communications checks and have a patrol make random checks (not to exceed 3 hours) of
  owner/user personnel posted to provide constant surveillance duties. If this is not possible,
  owner/user personnel must get written permission from 11 SSPTS/S5R.
  4.2.6. NMSA personnel must conduct random inspections of personnel and government
  vehicles entering/exiting the storage area. These checks will be documented on a locally
  generated form and maintained for one year. 11 SSPTS/S5R will provide inspection training
  to owner/users personnel. POVs are prohibited from entering the NMSA. Owner/user
  personnel may request K-9 support for these inspections and will be supported as law
  enforcement duties permits. The absence of K-9 support will not prohibit the checks from
  being conducted.

   Areas to the extent specified on the team EAL. EXCEPTION: Visits to Presidential and
   Hangar 20 aircraft and facilities will be coordinated with the PAG/CC. All visits to the
   Presidential and Hangar 20 aircraft and facilities will be escorted. An AF Form 1199 series
   and an EAL for supporting verification, satisfy unescorted entry requirements for inspectors.
   Do not subject inspectors to any identification or search requirements not imposed on unit
   personnel. Additionally, grant access to information for which an inspector has a need-to-
   know to complete an inspection.
   7.15.2. Air Force, AFDW, AMC and USSTRATCOM inspection teams and staff assistance
   visit teams will not be permitted to use their Restricted Area Badge (RAB) or EAL to
   circumvent the entry control system. Ruses to circumvent entry control procedures are
   prohibited. If an error is discovered between an inspector and evaluator’s badge, it must be
   considered an administrative error. Inspectors/evaluators will be delayed at the entry control
   point until 11 SFG Flight Commander and/or Flight Sergeant can rectify the problem. The
   Flight Commander and/or Flight Sergeant will make pen and ink changes with authentication
   authority until the team corrects the EAL. Do not detain or apprehend inspectors/evaluators
   for administrative errors. Immediately notify the team POC for administrative matters and
   relay the incorrect information. Team POCs are responsible for providing a correction to the
   EAL IAW AFI 31-101, chapter 9.
7.16. EALs and MRABLs. EXCEPTION: Visits to Presidential and Hangar 20 aircraft and
facilities will be coordinated with the PAG/CC. All visitors to the Presidential and Hangar 20
aircraft and facilities will be escorted. Additionally, EALS and MRABLs are used as a
verification technique for single badge entry procedures or in conjunction with escorted entry
procedures as a means of identification prior to allowing entry. EALs will be posted at PL 1
ECPs and close-in security areas. A MRABL will be maintained at the BDOC.
   7.16.1. Maintaining MRABLs and EALs. The 11 SFG Visitor Control Center will be
   responsible for maintaining MRABLs and EALs for PL 1 ECPs and close-in security areas.
   7.16.2. MRABL Requirements. These listings are used as an aid in accounting for issued
   AECCs. They do not authorize entry into PL 1 aircraft, restricted or close-in security areas,
   but may be used as a verification technique for a single badge system.
       7.16.2.1. The DFC will ensure a listing is prepared monthly.
       7.16.2.2. This listing will reflect the AECCs currently issued, to whom they are issued,
       the organization, last six of SSAN, badge number and areas authorized unescorted entry
       and escort privileges. NOTE: Enter locally developed control digits in place of the first

8.1. General.
   8.1.1. Airfields and mission support aircraft are vital to the accomplishment of AF missions
   and sortie generation. The airfield houses most of the top priority resources on the
   installation and as a result must be afforded top level protection.
8.2. Procedures.
8.2.1. The following procedures provide measures necessary to protect all airfield
resources and mission support aircraft.
   8.2.1.1. Responsibilities. Every person working within the flight line area is responsible for
   assisting with airfield protection.
   8.2.2. Protection Measures. The flight line area and associated aircraft are protected by the
   flight line Controlled Area system in conjunction with security forces posts/patrols and
   owner/user personnel.
      8.2.2.1. Flight line Controlled Area System. There is one flight line controlled area on
      JBA.
      8.2.2.2. The Installation Base Defense Security System (IBDSS) consists of four basic
      component subsystems; the flight line Controlled Area Command Control and Display
      Equipment (CCDE) annunciator and AMAG. These sub-systems provide flight line
      controlled area boundary detection, with immediate visual assessments for all covered
      sectors. As new areas are incorporated, the coverage provided by this system can be
      expanded to meet operational needs.
          8.2.2.2.1. Entry into the flight line controlled area is controlled through the flight line
          Controlled Area system utilizing AECC for vehicle or pedestrian access through the
          automated entry control points along the flight line Controlled Area fence.
                8.2.2.2.1.1. The flight line Controlled Area controller has the ability to open or
                lock down any gate remotely from Bldg. 1281.
                8.2.2.2.1.2. Patrols will be dispatched to any incident involving the flight line
                Controlled Area system, either directly from the flight line Controlled Area
                controller or through the BDOC.

Table 8.1. Owner/User Responsibilities.




      8.2.2.4. 11 SFG oversees the flight line controlled area badge system. When personnel
      enter the flight line controlled area gate they are in a controlled area and are required to
      display their controlled area badge on the outer most garment above the waist at all times.
      If personnel are utilizing a restricted area badge to gain access to the controlled area they
      are also required to display the badge once they enter the controlled area. It is everyone’s
      responsibility to challenge any person(s) not displaying a badge within a controlled area.
      If the person challenged does not have a badge, they should be detained and security
      forces should be called to respond.
      8.2.2.5. Only personnel with proper credentials listed below and a valid need for duty
      related purposes may enter the flight line controlled area. The 11 WG/CC has delegated
      the authority to grant unescorted/escorted entry to the flight line controlled area to unit
      commanders. Personnel requiring unescorted entry will have a federal criminal history
      background check, as a minimum.
          8.2.2.5.1. Flight line Entry Control Credentials. All personnel authorized unescorted
          entry to the flight line controlled area will be issued either an AECC or a CAAC.
