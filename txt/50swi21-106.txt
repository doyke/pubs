                                                                                             Pages: 9

This instruction implements AFPD 21-1, Air and Space Maintenance, for the 50th Space Wing, detailing
specific wing-level requirements for all depot maintenance requests; it does not apply to the Air National
Guard or the Air Force Reserves. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this
publication are maintained IAW AFMAN 37-123 (and succeeding AFMAN 33-363), Management of
Records, and disposed of IAW the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at https://
afrims.amc.af.mil/ and AFI 33-364, Records Disposition Procedures and Responsibilities.


1. Requirements for Depot Maintenance Requests.
   1.1. Programmed Depot Maintenance (PDM). The Chief of Maintenance (COM) submits PDM
   requests IAW Technical Order (TO) 00-25-108, Communications-Electronics Depot Support.
   OO-ALC/LJJ approves the work schedule and notifies the site/work center. Once approved, any
   requests for additional PDM must be routed through 50 SCS/SCM for coordination.
       1.1.1. Organic Depot Maintenance. Work centers route requests for organic depot maintenance
       via the COM to 50 SCS/SCQA using AF Form 227, C-E Depot Maintenance Requirements and
       Schedule. 50 SCS/SCQA is solely responsible for coordinating all requests through
       HQ AFSPC/A4SP for incorporation into the master organic maintenance schedule maintained by
       OO-ALC/LJJ.
       1.1.2. Forecasted Requirements. Work centers, via the COM, submit requirements one year in
       advance to 50 SCS/SCQA; i.e., submit requirements in FY07 for maintenance to be completed in
       FY08. Work centers will also include a four out-year projection to allow for funds programming
       and work plan scheduling. Refer to Attachment 2 for local procedures and
       TO 00-25-108, paragraph 2-2, for additional information.
2                                                                   50SWI21-106 30 JANUARY 2008


    1.2. Unprogrammed Depot Maintenance (UPDM). When a requirement for out-of-cycle depot
    maintenance develops, refer to Attachment 3 for request procedures and TO 00-25-108, paragraph
    2-4 for additional information.
    1.3. Emergency/Urgent Depot Level Maintenance (EDLM/UDLM) and Maintenance Assis-
    tance. Work centers coordinate requests for urgent or emergency depot level maintenance with the 50
    SCS Maintenance Operations Center (MOC). During non-duty hours, the MOC will contact 50 SCS/
    SCQ for emergency requests. Refer to Attachment 4 for local request procedures. Refer to TO
    00-25-108, paragraph 2-5.4 for additional information on EDLM/UDLM. See TO 00-25-108, para-
    graph 2-5 for maintenance assistance.
    1.4. Mobile Depot Maintenance (MDM). When any MDM is requested, the site CC, COM, or des-
    ignated representative of requesting work centers will ensure all work center requirements stated
    below are met:
       1.4.1. The OO-ALC MDM team performs a pre-MDM survey and documents the survey on
       AFTO Form 216, Pre-Mobile Depot Maintenance Survey Record and Certification. One copy
       of AFTO Form 216 is provided to the work center IAW TO 00-25-108, paragraph 2-7.1 through
       2-7.1.3.4. The work center is then responsible for completing requirements in paragraph 2.1. of
       this OI.
       1.4.2. The MDM team provides inputs to the work center for entry into IMDS (Integrated Main-
       tenance Data System). The work center documents these inputs into IMDS IAW TO 00-25-108,
       paragraph 2-7.2. The work center completes the MDM job data documentation in a timely manner
       and reflects all work accomplished.
       1.4.3. The MDM team completes an AFTO Form 217, Certificate of Mobile Depot Maintenance
       Accomplished. A government representative inspects and accepts the MDM by signing the AFTO
       Form 217 IAW TO 00-25-108, paragraph 2-7.3 through 2-7.3.3. The MDM team may include
       comments on the AFTO Form 217, indicating the need for additional maintenance. Should this
       occur, the work center is responsible for submitting an additional AF Form 227 IAW Attachment
       2 of this OI. During the inspection, the government representative makes note of any substandard
       maintenance, refers discrepancies to the MDM team and ensures corrections are completed prior
       to the MDM team departure.

2. Support Equipment Funding. Work centers coordinate requests for funds to sustain organic mainte-
nance and site support through 50 SCS/SCQ. Items include, but are not limited to, all local purchase rent-
als and services necessary to facilitate successful completion of organic depot maintenance. Work centers
are required to coordinate with local vendors and provide cost estimates as soon as possible after receiv-
ing confirmation that organic maintenance has been approved/scheduled, but no earlier than 60 days prior
to estimated start date. Coordinate all other support requests, to include Contract Line Item Number pur-
chases, through 50 SCS/SCQ for approval.

Terms
Depot Management Activity—The SPM/IM of the ALC or other source of repair, having responsibility
for the logistic support of assigned systems and equipment.
Emergency Depot Level Maintenance—Requirements of such an urgent nature that repairs cannot be
delayed. Equipment or systems are inoperative and active missions have failed.
Engineering Assistance—Assistance required to resolve structural, component or system deficiencies
that cannot be resolved through depot maintenance support. Engineering assistance may be performed in
conjunction with or separate from depot maintenance support.
Mobile Depot Maintenance—Programmed depot maintenance or unprogrammed depot maintenance
accomplished by an MDM Field Team dispatched to the system or equipment location.
MDM Field Team—A group of individuals assigned to perform programmed or unprogrammed depot
maintenance at a location other than a depot facility. Field teams will be composed of personnel (Air
Force, another service, contractor or combination thereof) possessing the necessary skills, special tools
and equipment to accomplish their assigned tasks at an operating location.
Organic Depot Maintenance—Maintenance performed by a military service under military control
using government-owned or controlled facilities, tools, test equipment, spares, repair parts and military or
government civilian personnel. This is normally conducted by an Air Force ALC or other service
equivalent, e.g. Army MDM for Defense Satellite Communications Systems.
Out of Cycle Maintenance—Maintenance which may have been accomplished at another time or
originally programmed but conditions dictate it be accomplished on other than the programmed
(scheduled) date.
Out-year—Any fiscal year after the current fiscal year.
Programmed Depot Maintenance—Depot modifications and maintenance normally scheduled on a
cyclic basis.
Routine Depot Maintenance Support—Those requirements which exist that have minimal mission
impact, but do not fall under the category of emergency or urgent. These requirements are nonetheless
beyond the capability of the maintenance activity and command. This type of support is normally
scheduled on a cyclic basis as PDM support requirements or as additions to them.
Technical Assistance—The providing of advice and assistance pertaining to installation, operation, and
maintenance of equipment. Technical assistance may be provided to the maintenance activity by verbally
supplying technical information by telephone; providing printed matter by message, mail or by MDM
Field Team members in conjunction with depot maintenance support.
Unprogrammed Depot Maintenance—Those requi rements that could not be foreca sted or
programmed. Unprogrammed depot maintenance is not used to perform routine or cyclic depot
maintenance. This type of support is anticipated to normally satisfy requirements for emergency or urgent
depot maintenance support.
Urgent Depot Maintenance Support—Requirements which are unexpected in nature and could not be
foreseen. Although the equipment is not inoperative, a mission-impacting problem (degradation) exists
that must be resolved in a timely manner. This includes systems operating on backup. The main difference
between this requirement and an emergency is response time.

Validation Official—A person designated to certify that problems found are beyond the maintenance
capability of the maintenance activity requesting the depot support.
Wing Approval Official—The 50 SCS Commander or designated representative who has been
authorized by the 50 SW/CC to approve depot support requests and to allow obligation of funds to
implement each individual depot support response.
Work Center—The activity responsible for performing organizational (level 1) maintenance.
