The purpose of this supplement is to describe the activities the OO-ALC uses to administer its
SQIP. The SQIP is a tool for leaders to create a climate of no-notice compliance readiness
through first-hand supervisory involvement by providing direction, methodology, roles and
responsibilities, program implementation, and documentation requirements.

2.4.2.4.11.1. (Added) Manage/maintain Maintenance 1 (MX1) database and SQIP SharePoint.
Serve as the OO-ALC SIP focal point for guidance and support.
2.4.2.5. (Added) Self-inspection will be completed each year by the 30th of September, and all
results will be documented in MX1 database under SQIP module based on the Squadron
Surveillance Plan (SSP).
2.4.2.5.1.1. (Added) Create a corrective action plan (CAP) for all deficiency trends.
2.4.2.5.1.2. (Added) CAP will be documented in MX1 under corrective action request
(CAR)/preventative action request (PAR)/continuous process improvement (CPI) module.
2.4.2.5.6.1. (Added) Ensure unit self inspection (USI) is completed by 30th of September each
year. OO-ALC Quality Program (OO-ALC/QP) will submit a compliance letter to center
inspector general (IG) by IG required due date.
2.4.4.2.1. (Added) OO-ALC USI is conducted continuously throughout the year beginning in
October and ending 30th September. The USI documentation is available in MX1 database

MX1 was approved by center IG stored on the SQIP SharePoint under continuity book folder.
2.4.4.5.1. (Added) SIP deficiencies will be collected and maintained in MX1 database. A
waiver letter to use MX1 was approved by center IG stored on the SQIP SharePoint under
continuity book folder.

SQIP SharePoint under continuity book folder.
2.4.5.1.1.1. (Added) Applicable checklists located on Headquarter (HQ) sites can be accessed

2.4.5.1.2.1. (Added) Locally developed USI checklists are created when no functional HQ
checklist exists. This checklist is used to guide program compliance long term. The OPR can be
assigned at base, complex, group or squadron level. Only the OPR can modify the checklist.
2.4.5.1.2.2. (Added) Locally developed special interest item (SII) checklists are created to
address local issues short term. Local SII checklists should target specific areas of the program
to determine systemic problems and/or developed to target specific areas from a HQ checklist for
possible root cause analysis, or to validate CAP effectiveness. The OPR is assigned at the
complex, group or squadron level. Only the OPR can modify the checklist.
2.4.5.1.9.1. (Added) Critical and significant deficiencies require an Eight-Step Problem
Solving Model CAP documented in MX1 database under CAR/PAR/CPI module.
2.4.6.1.2. (Added) Deficiencies recorded in MX1 database meet all data point requirements.
