                                             Chapter 1

                INFORMATION SECURITY PROGRAM MANAGER (ISPM)

1.1. Role of the ISPM.
     1.1.1. The installation Chief of Information Protection (IP) is designated as the Information
     Security Program Manager (ISPM). The day-to-day program management responsibilities
     are delegated through the Chief of Information Protection to subordinate staff members.
     1.1.2. The information security program outlines methods for transmitting classified
     information, safekeeping and storage criteria, specific marking requirements, disposal and
     destruction, access, dissemination, accountability and control, reproduction of classified,
     classification and declassification procedures, and preliminary inquiries or formal
     investigations of information security incidents. Also covered is the requirement and
     procedures for identifying, marking and protection of DOD UCNI. Management of the
     information security program encompasses two other closely related programs—the
     Personnel and Industrial Security Programs.
     1.1.3. The purpose of the personnel security program is to ensure security clearances and
     access authorizations are only granted in the best interest of national security. This program
     addresses all personnel security investigations, clearances, access authorizations,
     investigations for granting unescorted entry to restricted areas, and security information files
     (SIFs). This program is our internal defense in the fight against terrorism as it provides the
     initial and continuing suitability screening for all Air Force personnel.
     1.1.4. Perhaps the least understood of these programs is the Industrial Security Program.
     The objective is to assure Department of Defense classified information entrusted to
     government affiliated contractors is protected against unauthorized disclosure. It involves
     security supervision of contractors, inspection and oversight responsibilities, classified
     contracts, visitor controls, facility security clearances and classification guidance. Most AF
     contractors are integrated into the sponsoring unit and receive security inspections and
     oversight as part of the unit.
1.2. ISPM Responsibilities. Each program is very involved and requires continuous guidance
and support. Personnel assigned to the Information Security function of 94 AW/IP assist in
fulfilling the following ISPM responsibilities.
     1.2.1. Managing the overall installation Information, Personnel, and Industrial Security
     Programs.
     1.2.2. Ensuring appointed security managers for units or staff agencies are quickly and
     completely trained to perform their duties.
     1.2.3. Managing the information security training program and providing technical guidance
     to unit or staff agency security managers.
     1.2.4. Conducting security manager meetings. Preparing and distributing minutes of each
     meeting to all security managers and their commander, equivalent or staff agency chief for
     use in their security programs.
94AWI31-401 11 MARCH 2014                                                                      5


   1.2.5. Providing indoctrination training to Original Classification Authorities (OCAs) and
   designated activity personnel involved in the preparation of security classification guides or
   guidance.
   1.2.6. Conducting information security program reviews (ISPR).
1.3. ISPM Support Staff. Manpower is allocated to support the Information, Personnel and
Industrial Security Programs.

                                             Chapter 2

                           INFORMATION SECURITY PROGRAM

2.1. Security Manager Appointments.
     2.1.1. Each unit commander or equivalent or staff agency chief, will appoint a full-time and
     an alternate security manager. The appointing official provides a copy of the appointment
     letter to the information security section for their files. Units having fewer than 25 personnel
     may have only one full-time security manager. Security managers must have a SSBI,
     NACLC or ANACI personnel security investigation or reinvestigation completed or in
     process. If in process, the security manager must have had previous clearance eligibility to
     access the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS).
     2.1.2. Small organizations may have joint or mutual security managers when they fall under
     the jurisdiction of a single commander. Examples include such organizations as the Safety
     Office, Historian or Chaplain who are often grouped together under the Wing Commander’s
     program.
     2.1.3. Tenant USAF units may normally participate in the programs. Usually there is only
     one operational ISPM per installation. If someone else is claiming ISPM responsibilities,
     contact the ISPM for guidance and coordinate their participation through Wing Plans and
     Logistics Readiness.
     2.1.4. The 94 AW/IP retains records of appointments and tenant participation and support.
2.2. Security Manager Training.
     2.2.1. The ISPM is responsible to provide formal training to security managers as soon as
     possible after their appointment or within 90 days, whichever is sooner. Every day of delay
     has adverse impact on their unit, and ultimately the program.
     2.2.2. Training is based on the requirements of, DOD 5200.1-R, DOD 5200.2-R, AFI31-401,
     AFI 31-406, Applying North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Protection Standards; and
     AFI 31-501. Additional training will be based on need and capability.
     2.2.3. Although the information security program interfaces with other security-related
     programs, such as COMSEC, COMPUSEC, EMSEC, OPSEC, etc., 94 AW/IP is not
     normally responsible for providing related training.
     2.2.4. The 94 AW/IP documents and records security manager training.
2.3. Security Manager Meetings.
     2.3.1. The 94 AW Chief of Information Protection serves as Chairperson and approves the
     agenda for these meetings.
     2.3.2. Attendance by all primary security managers is mandatory. Alternates attend in the
     absence of the primary. If neither the primary nor alternate is available, a representative
     attends.
     2.3.3. The meetings provide a forum for interaction between security managers and
     resolution of common problems.
94AWI31-401 11 MARCH 2014                                                                      7


   2.3.4. Meeting minutes are published, recorded and distributed to all agencies by the
   information security section.
2.4. Security Manager Responsibilities.
   2.4.1. Provides advice and assistance to the unit commander or equivalent, or staff agency
   chief and personnel assigned to the activity.
   2.4.2. Develops and implements internal security operating instructions.
   2.4.3. Ensures assigned personnel fulfill security education training requirements outlined in
   DOD 5200.1-R and AFI 31-401.
   2.4.4. Monitors internal information security self-inspections. Ensures self-inspections are
   conducted semi-annually. Reviews reports and ensures timely corrective actions are taken.
   (Security managers do not inspect their own functions.)
   2.4.5. Participates in security managers’ meetings and training. Addresses problem areas
   and assists other security managers in resolving similar situations.
   2.4.6. Reviews and processes challenges to classification decisions.
   2.4.7. Manages JPAS within the unit, to include a frequent check for notifications and
   changes.
   2.4.8. Notifies unit personnel when their Periodic Reinvestigation (PR) is due.
   2.4.9. Monitors the Information, Personnel, and Industrial security programs.        Specific
   responsibilities are outlined in the Security Manager’s Handbook.
   2.4.10. Debriefs personnel of their continued responsibility to safeguard classified after
   access to the information has been terminated. Debriefings are documented using AF Form
   2587, Security Termination Statement, which is maintained on file for two years. Military
   members and civilian employees are debriefed under the following conditions:
      2.4.10.1. When discharged, retired, or employment is terminated.
      2.4.10.2. When access to a Special Access Program is terminated, i.e., SCI, NATO,
      CNWDI, or SIOP.
      2.4.10.3. When a Security Information File (SIF) is established, only if access to
      classified information is withdrawn.
   2.4.11. Maintains a current Security Manager Book with the following contents:

      2.4.11.4. Security Manager meeting minutes
      2.4.11.5. Information letters
      2.4.11.6. List of security containers (make, model, type of lock) and locations
      2.4.11.7. Program review reports
 8                                                               94AWI31-401 11 MARCH 2014


        2.4.11.8. Signed annual information security training plan

        2.4.11.10. Copy of the annual review of the Unit Manning Document.
     2.4.12. Informs 94 AW/IP of all classified contractors working within their area. Once the
     contract has been completed they will notify 94 AW/IP.
2.5. Information Security Program Reviews (ISPR).
     2.5.1. The ISPM ensures the Information Security section conducts ISPRs of all serviced
     activities. If the activity stores or processes classified information, the program review is
     conducted annually. If the activity doesn’t store or process classified information the
     program review is every two years.
     2.5.2. Reviews are “staff assistance” oriented to identify noteworthy and problem areas.
     2.5.3. The ISPR examines elements of the Information, Personnel and Industrial programs.
     Reviews may be based on a random sampling, but must be extensive enough to determine
     overall status of programs run by the security managers. They are not compliance
     inspections and are not assigned ratings.
     2.5.4. The Chief of Information Protection signs the report before it is forwarded to the
     visited activity for their review and corrective action, but may delegate the responsibility.
     There is no mandate that the visited activity respond to the report, unless requested by 94
     AW/IP. The 94 AW/IP retains the last 2 copies of the ISPRs.
2.6. Preliminary Inquiries and Formal Investigations. The 94 AW/IP has a detailed
handbook for inquiry officials if they desire to learn more.
     2.6.1. Initial notification of security incidents is made to 94 AW/IP representative by the end
     of the first duty day after discovery.
     2.6.2. When an incident occurs, a preliminary inquiry must be conducted to determine
     whether a compromise of classified material has occurred and to properly categorize the
     incident. A preliminary inquiry official (commissioned officer, senior noncommissioned
     officer, or DOD civilian, usually GS-9 or above) is appointed by the commander, equivalent,
     or staff agency chief. The ISPM is responsible to brief the inquiry or investigation official
     and assist as needed.
     2.6.3. Security incidents are categorized as follows:
        2.6.3.1. Compromise
        2.6.3.2. Probable Compromise
        2.6.3.3. Security Deviation
     2.6.4. The ISPM or his or her staff monitors the inquiry’s progress to ensure it is completed
     in a timely manner (normally 10 workdays, but some may take as long as 30 days).
     2.6.5. If the inquiry determines a compromise occurred and the probability of damage cannot
     be ruled out, a formal investigation is initiated by the appointing authority unless the
     appointing authority believes no further information will be developed and uses the
94AWI31-401 11 MARCH 2014                                                                    9


   preliminary inquiry to close the incident. The originating agency of the classified material
   must be notified if compromise or probable compromise occurred.
   2.6.6. The 94 AW/IP will retain records and forms as required.
2.7. Additional ISPM Responsibilities.
   2.7.1. Provides technical guidance to Original Classification Authorities (OCAs).
       2.7.1.1. Within the Air Force, OCAs are identified by the Secretary of the Air Force or
       the Administrative Assistant to the Secretary by position, not individual name. The
       incumbent of the position (identified on an OCA list at the AFSFC web site) may
       exercise the authority only after completing OCA training.
       2.7.1.2. The only current OCA on Dobbins ARB, GA is 22 AF/CC. If 22 AF/CCV will
       have to perform OCA duties in the absence of 22 AF/CC, training must be conducted.
       The list of OCAs is available at the AFSFC web site.
   2.7.2. The ISPM or his or her staff provides advice on preparation of classification guides.
   The ISPM is in a position to oversee many of the original decisions or derivative
   determinations. The information security section should maintain copies of the latest
   classification guidance available which may impact the wing’s mission. Base agencies will
   often seek technical guidance in helping make accurate derivative classification decisions.
   The information security section should be well versed in this area and know where to obtain
   the applicable classification guidance. The information security section should also keep
   DOD 5200.1-I, Index of Security Classification Guides, available for review.
2.8. ISPM Responsibilities for DOD Unclassified Controlled Nuclear Information (DOD
UCNI). The installation commander and 94 AW/IP Chief are designated by AFI 31-401 as
UCNI Officials. For the greater part, ISPM responsibilities are generally to educate the base
populace on protection measures for DOD UCNI and reviewing DOD UCNI safeguarding
measures during information security program reviews. Each unit/staff agency should, in turn,
include a review of DOD UCNI safeguarding procedures during their semiannual security
inspections.
   2.8.1. Specific responsibilities are:
       2.8.1.1. Identify information meeting definition of UCNI.
       2.8.1.2. Determine criteria for access to UCNI and approve special access requests.
       2.8.1.3. Approve or deny the release of UCNI information.
       2.8.1.4. Ensure all UCNI information is properly marked, safeguarded, transmitted, and
       destroyed.
       2.8.1.5. Document decisions and report them through command ISPM channels to HQ
       USAF/XOS-FI. RCS Number DD-C3I (AR)1810 applies to this data collection.
2.9. Protecting Classified Material on Aircraft.
   2.9.1. Aircraft commanders (owners/users) are responsible for the protection of classified
   material and components aboard their aircraft whether on a DOD facility, at a civilian
   airfield, or when stopping in foreign countries IAW DOD 5200.1-R, paragraph C6.3.9.
 10                                                          94AWI31-401 11 MARCH 2014


   Aircraft commanders should consult with the 94 AW/IP Chief for assistance in complying
   with these requirements.
       2.9.1.1. To provide security-in-depth for classified components and material on aircraft,
       park the aircraft in an established restricted area.
       2.9.1.2. Lock the aircraft using a GSA-approved changeable combination padlock
       (Federal Specification FF-P-110) series available from GSA at 800-525-8027, under
       NSN 5340-00-285-6523 to secure the crew entry door.
       2.9.1.3. If the aircraft cannot be locked, place all removable classified material (e.g.,
       paper documents, floppy disks, videotapes) in a storage container secured with a GSA-
       approved lock. The storage container must be a seamless metal (or similar construction)
       box or one with welded seams and a lockable hinged top secured to the aircraft. Hinges
       must be either internally mounted or welded. Containers installed for storage of weapons
       may also be used to store classified material even if weapons/ammunition are present,
       provided the criteria listed above have been met. Check the container every 12 hours for
       tampering.
       2.9.1.4. If the aircraft cannot be locked and is not equipped with a storage container,
       place the removable classified in an approved security container. Contact 94 OG/OGA
       for proper courtesy storage of classified material. Classified components attached to the
       aircraft, do not have to be removed.
2.10. Equipment to Process or Destroy Classified Material. All units possessing shredders,
facsimile machines, and copiers or other equipment approved for processing or destroying
classified information and materials will report this equipment to 94 AW/IP as part of the
classified container list. This equipment will be used jointly by all organizations in the
information security program to reduce expense. The 94 AW/IP will provide a list of this
equipment annually to all unit security managers. Units will inform 94 AW/IP of the need to
purchase such equipment so the need to develop a central destruction facility may be continually
assessed.
94AWI31-401 11 MARCH 2014                                                                       11

                           PERSONNEL SECURITY PROGRAM

3.1. Program Management. The personnel security program is administered by the personnel
security specialist. Requests for personnel security investigations, clearances, special access
authorizations, and administrative withdrawal of personnel security clearances are monitored and
processed through 94 AW/IP. The following is an overview of other major functions of the
personnel security section.
   3.1.1. Technical Guidance. Provides technical guidance and assistance to the installation
   commander, squadron commanders or equivalents, staff agency chiefs, security managers,
   and all other base personnel on matters involving personnel security.
   3.1.2. Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS). Manages the installation-wide
   application of user levels 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10.
3.2. Personnel Security Investigations (PSIs). All requests for personnel security
investigations go through the 94 AW/IP office. PSIs are conducted by the Office of Personnel
Management (OPM) as a means of determining employment suitability as well as eligibility for
access to classified information or unescorted entry into restricted areas.
   3.2.1. As the point of contact for submitting PSI’s, the personnel security section ensures all
   investigative forms are accurately completed. Once investigations are submitted they are
   monitored until closed. Investigations are tracked in JPAS and Central Adjudication Security
   Personnel Repository (CASPR).
   3.2.2. When an investigation is completed, the AFCAF reviews the results to determine
   whether it is favorable or contains derogatory information. The AFCAF grants security
   clearance eligibility to the highest level possible based on the type of favorable investigation
   conducted. The following are the personnel security specialists’ responsibilities relative to
   PSIs:
       3.2.2.1. Process investigation requests to Office of Personnel Management (OPM).
       Assist unit/staff agency personnel with e-QIP and process their requests for personnel
       security investigations.
       3.2.2.2. Provide guidance to the servicing CPF concerning investigation requests
       submitted to OPM.
       3.2.2.3. Monitor opening transactions.
       3.2.2.4. Maintain a wing tracking spreadsheet for activated investigations, security
       manager listing, required security manager training, SIF/SOR status.
       3.2.2.5. Manage the JPAS program for all non-Sensitive Compartmented Information
       activities.
       3.2.2.6. Monitors CASPR for security clearance status.
   3.2.3. Periodic personnel security investigations (PSIs) and periodic reinvestigations (PRs)
   for access to classified information will be conducted as follows:
 12                                                            94AWI31-401 11 MARCH 2014


       3.2.3.1. For secret access, initiate a periodic investigation 6 months before the last
       investigation is out of scope, i.e. 9.5 years from the close date.
       3.2.3.2. For top secret, SCI-DCID 6/4 access, initiate a periodic investigation 6 months
       before the last investigation is out of scope, i.e. 4.5 years from the close date.
       3.2.3.3. All investigations will be submitted through e-QIP.
       3.2.3.4. The 94 AW/IP will initiate a SIF on any employee who fails to comply and
       submit their PSIs through e-QIP after the 3rd missed activation. The commander,
       equivalent, or staff agency chief will initiate progressive disciplinary action (i.e. LOC,
       LOA, LOR, Article 15, dismissal) on any employee who fails to comply and complete
       successive PSIs through e-QIP in the specified time.
3.3. Security Information Files (SIF’s). A SIF is a temporary file used as a repository to
maintain pertinent documents related to a case in which a person’s trustworthiness, judgment, or
reliability has been questioned. Investigations are initiated to support or resolve unfavorable
information. The decision to establish a file is made either by the individual’s commander,
equivalent or staff agency chief due to behaviors identified in DOD 5200.1-R or by the Air Force
Central Adjudication Facility (AFCAF) based on derogatory information uncovered during an
investigation.
   3.3.1. If the ISPM disagrees with a commander, equivalent or staff agency chief as to the
   appropriateness of establishing a file, the case is forwarded to the installation commander for
   resolution. Access to classified information and unescorted entry into restricted areas are
   normally suspended whenever a SIF is established; however, it is the unit commander,
   equivalent or staff agency chief’s decision. If the adverse information involves a civilian
   employee, notify the civilian personnel flight. If the individual has access to SCI
   information, the Special Security Officer (SSO) is responsible for the SIF.
   3.3.2. The personnel security section advises the ISPM on matters relating to the SIF
   establishment. SIF custodial responsibilities include:
       3.3.2.1. Advising the installation commander and subject’s commander, equivalent or
       staff agency chief of the contents of the file, including significant information placed in
       the file after it is established.
       3.3.2.2. Safeguarding the file.
       3.3.2.3. Recording all notifications, reviews, and other transactions occurring to the file
       during the entire life of the file.
       3.3.2.4. Ensuring completeness of a SIF before sending it to the AFCAF for final
       adjudication. Information in the files includes, but is not limited to, the following:
           3.3.2.4.1. AFOSI reports.
           3.3.2.4.2. Local police reports.
           3.3.2.4.3. Documents of administrative action.
           3.3.2.4.4. Evaluation by base agencies. i.e., Security Forces, Social Actions, Staff
           Judge Advocate, Mental Health, etc.
           3.3.2.4.5. Any other pertinent information relating to the case.
94AWI31-401 11 MARCH 2014                                                                      13


       3.3.2.5. The ISPM, through the personnel security specialist, must take the following
       actions when establishing a SIF:
           3.3.2.5.1. Notify the AFCAF and the installation commander of SIF establishment.
           3.3.2.5.2. Ensure access to classified information and unescorted entry to restricted
           areas are suspended, if considered necessary by the subject’s unit commander,
           equivalent or staff agency chief.
           3.3.2.5.3. Provide the AFCAF timely status reports on open SIFs.
           3.3.2.5.4. Maintain the SIF as outlined in AFI 31-501.
           3.3.2.5.5. Destroy the file once the AFCAF completes the adjudication process.
   3.3.3. Once a SIF/SOR is received from the AFCAF to suspend a security clearance notify
   94 CF for termination of Local Area Network (LAN) and information technology systems. If
   a member needs continued access, the unit security manager must accomplish a network
   waiver.
3.4. Central Adjudication Security Personnel Repository (CASPR). CASPR is used by the
AFCAF to notify our office of security clearance changes to personnel statuses, i.e., clearance
granted, sent to due process, SIF, SOR, Denials and Revocations.
   3.4.1. AFCAF generated Suitability’s, SIF, SORs, Denials and Revocations will be sent
   through CASPR.
   3.4.2. All responses/intents from the members will be processed through CASPR.
3.5. Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS). JPAS is an on-line system that reflects
current clearance eligibility and other pertinent data.
   3.5.1. Information entered into JPAS by the AFCAF is immediately available to system
   users. JPAS provides a periodic update to the personnel data systems operated by AFPC,
   however JPAS is the only source for confirming clearance eligibility. Security managers and
   information and personnel security personnel are required to check JPAS for updates
   frequently and to update information in JPAS including in- and out-processing, PSI
   submission information, Non-disclosure agreements, US and NATO accesses.
   3.5.2. JPAS use is restricted to the security community and security managers. JPAS
   accounts may be established for entry controllers also. Military members need a minimum of
   a current NACLC before the system will allow access. Civilian employees require a
   minimum of a current ANACI. The personnel security specialist maintains a list of all non-
   SCI installation authorized users. All JPAS users will accomplish Personal Identifiable
   Information (PII) training and will send their certificate to 94 AW/IP office to maintain. This
   is a one time requirement.
   3.5.3. JPAS provides access to position access requirements, investigative and clearance
   eligibility data as well as records of select briefings/accesses such as Personnel Reliability
   Program, Critical Nuclear Design Information, and North Atlantic Treaty Organization
   access briefings.
3.6. ISPRs. While the personnel security section isn’t normally manned to visit every agency
during the information security program review, they should get out as often as possible, discuss
 14                                                               94AWI31-401 11 MARCH 2014


special interest items and changes with security managers, coordinate findings, and assist in
making recommendations for improvement.
3.7. Position Coding.
   3.7.1. Commanders are responsible for determining the appropriate code for the
   organization’s manpower positions IAW AFI 31-501, Personnel Security Management,
   Chapter 7, para 7.2
   3.7.2. Position codes are assigned by the type of investigation required for mission purposes
   versus security clearance requirements. Positions must be coded with the appropriate
   investigative level. Investigation types and definitions follow:
       3.7.2.1. Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI) (Code 5): Initial investigation to
       access up to Top Secret, certain AFSCs and sensitive programs.
       3.7.2.2. National Agency Check, Local Agency Checks and Credit (NACLC) (Code 6):
       Initial investigation for access up to Secret for military and contractors. Required for
       military entry and retention.
       3.7.2.3. Access National Agency Check and Inquiries (ANACI) (Code 7):                    Initial
       investigation for access to Secret for civilians.
       3.7.2.4. National Agency Check Plus Inquiries (NACI) (Code 8): Required for entry to
       government service for civilians and federal employees in positions not requiring access
       to classified.
   3.7.3. A corresponding code is assigned to the investigation type and reflected in both the
   Headquarters Air Force Manpower Data System and Unit Manpower Documents.
   3.7.4. A select group of AFSCs have been designated with a mandatory SSBI requirement,
   e.g., Intelligence (14N); Pilots (11B/11F); Navigator (12B/12F), etc. There are also several
   sensitive programs that have been designated as a mandatory SSBI requirement, e.g.,
   Presidential Support, PRP, SCI. Please refer to the mandatory AFSC list.
   3.7.5. The 3-Star/Civilian Equivalent approval is required for additional SSBI requirements
   that fall outside the mandatory AFSC or program lists.
   3.7.6. Positions designated for military deployments will be coded as a NACLC, unless the
   position requires an SSBI based on day-to-day mission requirements. Commanders have
   authority to grant interim TS access for deployment purposes for 180 days, and can renew
   this access for extended deployments. An SSBI is not required in these instances.
   3.7.7. Unit commanders, staff agency chiefs and section heads are required to conduct an
   annual review of their position codes in May and maintain a copy of the review in the
   security managers handbook.
   3.7.8. Prior to allowing access to classified information, custodians of classified information
   must ensure military, civilians and contractors have the following:
       3.7.8.1. Current eligibility as identified in JPAS. Current eligibility is defined as
       eligibility at the level required (top secret, secret, confidential) and the investigation is in
       scope. In scope means that the investigation is no more than 5 years old for top secret
94AWI31-401 11 MARCH 2014                                                                      15


       and no more than 10 years old for secret and confidential. Document US Access levels in
       JPAS after NdA indoctrination.
       3.7.8.2. Attestation for top secret is annotated on the NdA, block 11. The signed NdA
       and the indoctrination are documented in JPAS.
       3.7.8.3. Need to know for official government business.
       3.7.8.4. Current and required training to include initial or recurring information security
       training and unit/duty specific training.
   3.7.9. Those granting access to classified information must gain the originator’s approval
   before releasing the information outside the Executive Branch or as specified by the
   originator of the classified material.
3.8. Denied or Revoked Clearance Eligibility. When the AFCAF makes the final decision to
deny or revoke a security clearance, commanders, staff agency chiefs and section heads will
immediately evaluate the retention and employment policies for that member. Render a decision
to retain, retrain, or release the member within 90 days. Ensure coordination with 94 FSS/DPC
and or 94 FSS/DMP.

                           INDUSTRIAL SECURITY PROGRAM

4.1. Overview. Classified contracts may involve research and development; installation,
modification, and maintenance of weapons systems or communications systems; or installation
and maintenance of systems that handle classified information. Whatever the involvement and
whatever the type of contract, it is the 94 AW/IP Chief who represents the installation
commander in the security supervision of the contractor operations for all except Special Access
Programs (SAP) or Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) efforts.
4.2. Program Management. The initial steps are to review the DD Form 254, Contract
Security Classification Specification, and discuss with the contractor, contracting officer, and
program manager to determine the degree of involvement with classified information and degree
of oversight required.
   4.2.1. In some cases, contractor operations will only involve intermittent visits to the
   installation. The contractor is then told of the installation’s policies regarding entry and exit,
   vehicle registration, alerts, personal identification, firearms and explosives, and procedures
   for entry into controlled and restricted areas.
   4.2.2. In other cases, the contractor operations will occupy space on the installation. In these
   cases, 94 AW/IP must use knowledge of the contractor operations to determine the extent of
   security support required. Within the Air Force, we establish the contractor activity as a
   Visitor Group (VG). VGs are always under the security cognizance of the installation
   commander and are usually integrated into the security program of the unit that requires their
   services. This allows control and flexibility in dealing with the contractor. It also recognizes
   the way we do business with most contractors, i.e., their operations are merged with Air
   Force operations and it’s not feasible to establish them as a separate operating entity.
   4.2.3. The 94 AW/IP takes the following actions:
       4.2.3.1. Performs initial visit to discuss the security agreement with the contractor.
       4.2.3.2. Ensures the contractor knows what the security requirements are and what
       security support will be made available by the 94 AW/IP office.
       4.2.3.3. Completes the security agreement and advises the contractor that they will be
       included in the host unit information security program review schedule. The 94 AW/IP
       staff do not conduct a separate ISPR for contractors integrated into a unit.
       4.2.3.4. The ISPM and the information security section will be responsible to forward,
       retain and review all relevant contracts, forms, agreements, and inspections.
94AWI31-401 11 MARCH 2014                                                                      17

                        SECURITY EDUCATION AND TRAINING

5.1. Overview. Security education is essential to prevent security violations. Make the training
as interesting as possible. Periodicals and newsletters will help to fill the gap between training
sessions.
   5.1.1. The 94 AW/IP will ensure the base security education program is comprehensive and
   effective. Specific responsibilities include:
   5.1.1.1. Developing local policy and providing guidance to base units/staff agencies
   pertaining to the security education program.
       5.1.1.2. Developing security education products and disseminating them to base
       units/staff agencies.
       5.1.1.3. Reviewing unit/staff agency security education programs during Information
       Security Program Reviews.
       5.1.1.4. Ensuring security education receives appropriate emphasis in unit metrics and
       self-inspections.
   5.1.2. Security education is directed in DOD 5200.1-R and AFI 31-401.
5.2. Formal Training for Information Security Specialists.
   5.2.1. Each year the service receives a limited number of formal training allocations for
   courses sponsored by DSSA. Courses offered are in-residence and web-based and designed
   to train security specialists. Some courses are funded by HQ AETC and others are unit
   funded. Available courses are listed on the DSSA web site. Correspondence courses are also
   available.
   5.2.2. Air Force military, civilians, and contractors who perform security manager duties are
   strongly encouraged to participate in the DSSA courses.
5.3. Training Cycles and Requirements.
   5.3.1. Initial Training: All personnel will receive initial information security education at
   their initial assignment. If proof/documentation of training is not provided, the USM will
   ensure training is conducted and documented within 90 days of arrival on station or before
   accessing classified information, whichever is sooner. 94 AW/IP can assist USMs and
   supervisors and provides training materials specified below.
       5.3.1.1. Personnel assigned in non-sensitive positions, i.e. no clearance required, will
       receive non-sensitive (unclassified) and NATO classified training.
       5.3.1.2. Personnel assigned in critical-sensitive or non-critical sensitive positions, i.e.
       security clearance required and all military, will receive sensitive (classified) and NATO
       classified training.
