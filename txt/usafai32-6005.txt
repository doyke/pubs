1. Air Force Responsibilities.
     1.1. Unaccompanied Housing (UH) Management Concept.
        1.1.1. The Air Force Academy utilizes the Unaccompanied Housing (UH) Management
        Concept as outlined in AFI 32-6005, paragraph 2.1.
        1.1.2. The dormitory manager’s office is in Room 108B in dormitory 5223; phone: 333-
        4229.
     1.2. Dormitory Council. The Dormitory Council consists of the 10 Air Base Wing
     Command Chief, (10 ABW/CCC), first sergeants, selected dormitory residents, and the
     dormitory manager. The council advises and recommends adoption of standards governing
     the appearance of public and personal areas and the conduct of the residents as it affects these
     areas. The council's meetings are held periodically as required by the Dormitory Council
     Charter or as needed by the 10 ABW Commander, 10 ABW/CCC, first sergeants, or the
     dormitory manager. Dormitory meetings include the dormitory council and dormitory
     residents.
     1.3. Quarters Improvement Committee (QIC).            In accordance with AFI 32-6004,
     Furnishings Management, Attachment 3, the QIC is required to meet semi-annually (or more
     often as needed). In accordance with AFI 32-6005, Unaccompanied Housing Management,
     the Installation Commander chairs the QIC. The QIC chairmanship may be delegated in
     writing to the vice commander. This committee is established so dormitory representatives
     may voice their concerns on living conditions in the dormitories, and be informed of
     dormitory improvements and facility projects. Each unit is highly encouraged to have a
     representative attend. The date for the meeting will be posted in each dormitory on the first
     floor bulletin board.
     1.4. Room Inspections. Unit commanders will conduct morale visits annually, and first
     sergeants retain the responsibility to perform/track room inspections quarterly. More
     frequent inspections are encouraged and will be performed as circumstances dictate. The
     focus for dorm inspections is safety and health as defined in AFI 32-6005. Attachment 2 of
     this instruction, Items of Concern for Room Inspections, outlines the policy for inspections at
     this installation. Inspections may be scheduled or unscheduled. Commanders and first
     sergeants will need to record each visit on the sign-in log. USAFA Form 60, Dormitory
