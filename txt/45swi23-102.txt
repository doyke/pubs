SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Major changes
include the title of publication changed to meet the contents of the publication and adds
instructions and procedures for customer ordering parts. A margin bar (|) indicates newly revised
material.
1. Purpose. The 45 MSG/CC seeks to facilitate the issuance of aircraft spare parts by locating
Primary Operating Stock (POS) and Readiness Spares Package (RSP) in a facility adjacent to
aircraft maintenance. This includes establishing an Aircraft Parts Store (APS) and providing
over-the-counter services of POS spares. APS is the single receiving/processing point for all
Repair Cycle and DIFM turn-in functions/actions.

2. General. These instructions will be used to operate the APS. Normal supply procedures
contained in AFMAN 23-110 will be followed except for those unique procedures stated in this
instruction.
3. Location. The APS, providing over-the-counter service, is located in building 710 and the
Readiness Spares Package storage is located in building 708.
4. Hours of Operation. The APS normal operating hours are 0730 to 1630 hours. After-hours
support will be handled by the Base Supply After Hours Support (AHS) function. The RSP
Store will be handled by personnel in the APS and will maintain the same hours of operation as
the APS.
5. Customer will:
     5.1. Utilize IMDS to the maximum extent possible as outlined in AFI 21-101 for all supply
     transactions.
     5.2. Utilize appropriate delivery priorities and Urgency Justification codes (UJC) as outlined
     in AFI 21-101, Ch 11.
     5.3. Process TRN procedures for all items repaired, aligned and replaced as outlined in AFI
     21-101, Ch 11.
     5.4. In the event that IMDS is not available, the customer may contact the Base Supply
     Customer Service to order parts.
     5.5. The Quick Reference List (QRL) may be utilized. This will eliminate the need for the
     customer to identify the stock number, unit of issue, demand code, nomenclature, T/O, figure
     and index information.
     5.6. Items called into Customer Service that are located in the APS operation, will be
     processed as a Fill/Kill (F/K), with a delivery destination of PIK, customer pick-up.
        5.6.1. For all issues, customers will pick-up items at APS within the proper timeframe
        according to the delivery priority that was used.
            5.6.1.1. The delivery time frames are outlined in AFMAN 23-110, Vol. 2, Part 2, Ch
            11, 45 SW Supplement.
        5.6.2. If the items are not picked-up within the required timeframe, a TIN without credit
        will be processed and the item(s) will be put back in stock and it will be considered
        priority abuse and the organization commander will be notified.
        5.6.3. If the issue request is a kill, the MSL will provide support to customer service for
        back order procedures for items not on and. MICAP backorders will be validated
        according to procedures outlined in AFMAN 23-110.
        5.6.4. If the item is a kill, but the asset is on-hand in the MRSP, Customer Service will
        validate with MRSP and if authorized process the issue. Customer Service will notify the
        customer that the issue was processed and that the asset can be obtained from the kits.
        (Customer must go to APS to pick the item up within the allotted timeframe according to
        the delivery priority that was used.)
     5.7. The After Hours Support will process the MSI after normal duty hours.

6. APS Operation.
   6.1. Except as noted in paragraphs 1 – 5.7 above, normal operating procedures contained in
   AFMAN 23-110 will be used to manage the APS warehouse functions.
   6.2. Stockage policy. Only POS aircraft spares primarily used by the aircraft maintenance
   activity will be stored in the APS. Bench stock replenishment items will be maintained in the
   main base supply warehouses. HAZMAT will not be stored in the APS. Controlled items
   will be stored in the vault located in building 822.
   6.3. Issue procedures. APS personnel will use over-the-counter procedures to issue items
   from the APS once the issue is processed in IMDS or by Customer Service.
   6.4. The APS will process MSI transactions for approved requests for withdraw from MRSP
   kits. The requestor will sign the issue document and take possession of the part. If available,
   the technician may turn in the reparable asset at the same time. Normal processing will
   apply.
       6.4.1. APS will make arrangements to pick up/deliver large assets from the customer.
7. RSP Operation. All RSP will be stored at the APS facilities. Controlled items will be stored
in the vault located in building 822. Except as noted in paragraphs 1 – 5.7 above, normal
operating procedures contained in AFMAN 23-110 will be used to manage the RSP.
