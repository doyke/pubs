2. Responsibilities:
    2.1. The Commander, 435th Communications Squadron (435 CS/CC) will act as the final approval
    authority for emergency PA support requests, PA support requests for events off base, requests for a
    higher level of support than defined in this Operating Instruction (OI), or requests not covered in this
    OI. Additionally, the 435 CS/CC determines the level of support given when there is a conflict
    between two different PA setups requested for the same date/time.
    2.2. The Mission Systems Flight Commander (435 CS/SCM) will act as the final approval authority
    on all short notice PA support requests as defined in paragraph 1.5. The 435 CS/SCM will forward
    emergency requests as defined in paragraph 1.6. to the 435 CS/CC for final approval.
    2.3. The NCOIC, Base Radio and Security Systems (BRASS) (435 CS/SCMBB) will act as the final
    approval authority on all routine PA support requests and will appoint a work center manager to over-
    see the PA support program.
    2.4. The 435th Communications Squadron Base Radio and Security Systems (BRASS) work center
    (435 CS/SCMBB)

       (LMR) system, D-base security system and Giant Voice emergency broadcast for the Kaiserslaut-
       ern Military Community (KMC) area. These systems carry a high priority and have a critical

           types of functions.

       basis.
       2.4.4. Provides sign-out PA equipment support requests for base community relations functions
       and private organizations such as heritage associations, Boy Scouts, or other special events when

      an availability basis.
      2.4.6. Will not operate fixed PA systems belonging to another unit to include permanent systems
      at Officers and/or Enlisted Clubs unless it is approved/directed by the 435 CS/CC.

      expenses).
      2.5.4. Provide BRASS support personnel access to event location at least 1 hour prior to event
      start time.

3. Procedures:
   3.1. 435 CS/SCMBB is not responsible for procurement, installation or maintenance of PA systems
   for other base units. Fixed PA systems can be obtained as outlined in AFI 33-103, Requirements
   Development and Processing. Installation and maintenance should be obtained through the Base Con-
   tracting Office. All organizations are authorized to procure their own PA equipment to meet individual
   needs. Permanently installed PA systems are justified and procured by using organizational funds in
4                                                                RAMSTEINABI33-102 28 MAY 2008


    accordance with Table of Allowance 006 and AFMAN 23-110. 435 CS/SCMBB may be used as a tech-
    nical consultant on PA system acquisition by properly submitting a Project Workflow Requirement
    Resource request through 435 CS/SCX.
    3.2. Call BRASS at DSN: 480-4MIC (4642) for guidance in requesting PA support. System descrip-
    tions and the Public Address Support Request Form is available at the 435 CS webpage via the AF
    Portal; under the quick links section:
    https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af/USAF/AFP40/Attachment/20070322/PA_request.doc?chan-
    nelPageId=-1406424&programId=1041593 or
    https://ice.usafe.af.mil/sites/435MSG/CS/SCO/scot/PA%20Requests/Forms/AllItems.aspx
    3.3. A PA request form must be filled out and coordination/authorization must be accomplished not
    less than 10 duty days prior to the day of the event. E-mail the completed form to Ramstein - Public
    Address Support at public.address@ramstein.af.mil. This provides adequate time for processing
    and scheduling and also provides the requesting customer time to locate an alternate source in the
    event a request cannot be satisfied or is denied.
    3.4. The requesting customer will be contacted regardless of the support provided. If approved, the
    customer will be contacted for confirmation and for any additional information that may be required.
    The customer is required to contact BRASS if changes occur and are encouraged to contact us with
    questions or concerns at DSN: 480-4MIC (4642).
    3.5. Training for sign-out systems is provided at the time of receipt to ensure the customer can operate
    the equipment. PA equipment signed out can be picked up at building 108, 1 duty day prior to the
    event and must be returned no later than 0900 the first duty day after the event.
    3.6. All sign-out PA systems are checked out on an AF Form 1297, Temporary Issue Receipt, at the
    time it is issued. Equipment must be returned in the same condition it was issued. Any existing prob-
    lems must be identified at time of equipment sign out. Coil and/or tie cables to prevent tangling prior
    to turn in. Identify broken parts, problems or discrepancies when the equipment is returned. The cus-
    tomer is responsible for security and any loss or damage of the equipment.
    3.7. Official functions will be supported by the full complement of PA equipment at the final cere-
    mony only. Sound requirements for practices must be scheduled in advance. Customers may use a
    sign-out PA system for practices, if available.
    3.8. All agencies (that is, base visual information, public affairs, local media and so forth) requesting
    interface with the BRASS PA system will be connected and tested not less than 1 hour prior to the start
    of an event. All interface cables must be supplied by the customer. BRASS must be notified of any
    planned interface when the PA request is submitted. Should this additional equipment cause interfer-
    ence with or damage to the PA system, the BRASS technician is authorized to disconnect equipment
    and deny the interface.
