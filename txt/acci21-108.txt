                                          Chapter 1

                                 CONCEPT AND POLICY

1.1. Concept. This instruction establishes a CAF-wide network for the recovery of stranded
aircraft.
      1.1.1. Component Numbered Air Forces (C-NAFs) are responsible for recovery of
      stranded aircraft under operational control of their respective Component Commands.
      The ACC/A4 Stranded Aircraft Support Team (SAST) has responsibility for stranded
      aircraft under operational control of ACC. The SAST operates on a C-NAF
      commensurate level in order to better facilitate networking and coordination across the
      commands. The CAF C-NAFs and the SAST collectively comprise the CAF Stranded
      Aircraft Support Network (SASN). The CAF SASN provides support to AMC (MAF),
      AFSOC, AFRC, and ANG aircraft to the extent of its capabilities in order to establish a
      global mutual support network system which maximizes aircraft availability AF-wide.
      1.1.2. The C-NAFs/SAST operate within the guidance outlined in AFI 21-series
      Instructions and this instruction to leverage the global logistics enterprise to maximize
      effectiveness and efficiency.
      1.1.3. The owning organization MXG/CC (or designated representative) determines if
      stranded aircraft recovery will be accomplished organically (owning unit), or if assistance
      is required from the Stranded Aircraft Support Network, via the owning C-NAF or
      SAST.
          1.1.3.1. Organic Recovery:       When the owning MXG/CC (or designated
          representative) determines the most efficient means to recover a stranded aircraft is
          organic support:
             1.1.3.1.1. The owning MXG will notify appropriate C-NAF/SAST to inform
             them of the situation and course of action being taken.
             1.1.3.1.2. The owning MXG will send an informational copy of a completed CAF
             Form 1 to the appropriate C-NAF/SAST.
             1.1.3.1.3. The owning MXG‘s MOC will provide daily updates to the C-
             NAF/SAST until the aircraft is returned to airworthy status.
             1.1.3.1.4. The C-NAF/SAST will use the provided information for capture of
             stranded aircraft occurrences for on-going analysis and historical documentation.
          1.1.3.2. Assisted Recovery:       When the owning MXG/CC (or designated
          representative) determines assistance is required from Stranded Aircraft Support
          Network.
             1.1.3.2.1. The owning MXG will send an action copy of a completed CAF Form
             1 to the appropriate C-NAF/SAST identifying required assistance in terms of
             personnel, parts and equipment.
             1.1.3.2.2. The C-NAF/SAST will ‗plug in‘ to the global CAF Stranded Aircraft
             Support Network to coordinate cross-command support.
ACCI21-108 8 DECEMBER 2010                                                                    5


              1.1.3.2.2.1. Some occasions may warrant coordination with more than one C-
              NAF/SAST, or with MAF and SOF agencies.
           1.1.3.3. Organic and/or Assisted recovery:
              1.1.3.3.1. C-NAF/SAST will maintain continuous contact with owning and
              supporting agencies throughout process to ensure efficient recovery.
              1.1.3.3.2. MXG will maintain continuous contact between C-NAF/SAST and
              supporting agencies to keep all parties informed on the recovery process.
       1.1.4. The supporting C-NAF/SAST will source the supporting unit and            maintain
       OPCON of the unit Maintenance Recovery Team (MRT) throughout the                recovery
       process, while the owning MXG maintains fiscal authority throughout the         recovery
       process. The supporting C-NAF/SAST and owning C-NAF/SAST will                   maintain
       information flow to ensure timely updates and status reports.
1.2. Organizational Structure. C-NAFs A4 Operations office and the ACC/A4 Stranded
Aircraft Support Team (SAST) are the offices that directly support Combat Air Force (CAF) off-
station aircraft in a non-airworthy condition at a location lacking required support (personnel,
parts and/or equipment) to return the aircraft to an airworthy condition. The owning C-
NAF/SAST coordinates with their respective MAJCOM A4 Maintenance Divisions (A4M, A4F,
A4C, etc.), Logistics Readiness Divisions (A4R), Air Operations Centers (AOCs), other C-NAF
(or equivalent) offices, and the Air Force Global Logistics Support Center (AFGLSC) to affect
rapid recovery of stranded aircraft.

1.3. Primary Objective:
       1.3.1. The CAF SASN provides 24-hour coverage through manned shifts and standby
       personnel. Its objective is to expedite logistics support for CAF aircraft that are off-
       station, and in a non-airworthy condition at a location lacking the required support to
       return the aircraft to an airworthy condition. Off-station aircraft recoveries are facilitated
       through close coordination for personnel, parts, equipment, and timely transportation.
       1.3.2. The SASN will provide support to AMC, AFSOC, ANG and AFRC aircraft within
       the limits of its capabilities.
       1.3.3. Funding for recovery of stranded aircraft is the responsibility of the owning unit.
       1.3.4. Contact information for the C-NAF/SAST can be found on CAF Stranded
       Aircraft          CoP            at        the        following       URL:

NOTES: Due to the dynamic nature of maintenance operations, it is recognized that not all
maintenance recovery scenarios can be captured in this document. Deviations may be necessary
to meet unique mission requirements. Such deviations will be coordinated between the C-
NAFs/SAST and the appropriate MXGs. The CAF Form 1 will be utilized to the maximum
extent possible.

                                             Chapter 2

                       C-NAF/SAST ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

2.1. General Responsibilities. Upon receipt of an assistance request from the owning unit, the
owning C-NAF/SAST becomes the single point of contact and directly responsible for aircraft
recovery operations which include planning, coordinating, and executing the recovery of CAF
stranded aircraft. Aircraft recovery operations leverage the global logistics enterprise in sourcing
and transporting personnel, parts, and equipment to maximize aircraft availability. The owning
C-NAF/SAST is the lead agency when sourcing required support from multiple C-NAFs.
     2.1.1. The owning C-NAF/SAST is responsible for developing and maintaining in-transit
     resource visibility tools such as GDSS, etc.; liaison with MAJCOMs and other entities as
     required; maintaining contact lists for the logistics enterprise; building, coordinating and
     executing stranded aircraft recovery plans; sourcing and coordinating personnel, parts and
     equipment to expedite stranded aircraft recoveries; collecting, analyzing and sharing stranded
     aircraft data and lessons learned; building and presenting status reports; ensuring continuous
     communications with applicable stakeholders during recovery operations.
     2.1.2. The owning C-NAF/SAST will validate stranded aircraft priorities and allocating
     resources as follows:
                Priority 1: Alert, war plan, or national emergency aircraft.

                           C-NAF/SAST will immediately dedicate resources to coordinate
                           aircraft recovery in the most expeditious manner. On-call personnel
                           will be recalled, as appropriate. Priority 1 aircraft take precedence over
                           all other aircraft recoveries, and duty priorities.

                Priority 2: Operation plan, special mission, low-supply/high-demand, deployment
                            or deploying tail swap aircraft.

                           C-NAF/SAST will immediately dedicate resources to coordinate
                           aircraft recovery in the most expeditious manner. On-call personnel
                           will be recalled, as appropriate. Individual aircraft priorities shall be
                           stratified on a first-come, first-served basis.

                Priority 3: Routine/training mission, redeployment or returning tail-swap aircraft.

                           C-NAF/SAST will dedicate resources to coordinate aircraft recovery
                           in an expeditious manner during normal duty hours. Individual
                           aircraft priorities shall be stratified on a first-come, first-served basis.
ACCI21-108 8 DECEMBER 2010                                                                      9


2.2. Recovery Responsibilities. The owning C-NAF/SAST will coordinate with the supporting
C-NAF or SAST for subordinate unit personnel, equipment, and resources for expeditious
recovery of non-airworthy aircraft.
   2.2.1. Research/Sourcing. The primary means of receiving a request is via a completed CAF
   Form 1, Stranded Aircraft Worksheet (attachment 2). The Owning C-NAF/SAST will:
      2.2.1.1. Validate stranded aircraft support requests. Confirm particulars with the owning
      unit‘s MOC and/or Maintenance Operations.
      2.2.1.2. Validate the AFGLSC solution for sourcing of required part(s) meets operational
      requirements. If needed, contact the 635 Supply Chain Management Group (SCMG) or
      the 735 SCMG (as appropriate) to coordinate for parts sourcing and shipment.
      2.2.1.3. If the request is for a non-supply item, coordinate sourcing actions with the
      appropriate base MOC or equivalent when within the owning MAJCOM. When
      requesting assistance from another MAJCOM, coordinate with the respective C-NAF,
      AOC, or equivalent to request such support.
      2.2.1.4. For priority 1 and priority 2 aircraft recoveries, ensure applicable items being
      shipped via Air Mobility Command (AMC) are shipped as prescribed in AMCI 23-102,
      Expeditious Movement of AMC VVIP, and marked ―AMC MICAP Very Very Important
      Parts (VVIP)‖ or through World Wide Express (WWX) for items being shipped via
      commercial carriers. Use project codes as prescribed to ensure proper handling. NOTE:
      This paragraph is pending approval of MOA between the CAF and the MAF.
      2.2.1.5. Coordinate with the appropriate Logistics Readiness Squadron (LRS)
      Deployment and Distribution Flight or aerial ports to ensure proper handling of support
      items.
      2.2.1.6. In the event assets are not available through supply channels, contact the owning
      MOC to discuss alternate sourcing options such as CANN actions, etc.
   2.2.2. Transportation. The owning C-NAF/SAST may request the most expeditious
   transportation for parts, equipment, and personnel to the recovery site. Note: When
   commercial airlift of personnel is required, it is the responsibility of the supporting unit to
   arrange travel.
      2.2.2.1. Commercial Air Transportation. WWX carriers will be utilized for premium
      transportation of MICAP parts and support equipment to support recovery of en route and
      deployed NMC aircraft.
          2.2.2.1.1. All packaged cargo must meet the carrier‘s shipping requirements, i.e. size,
          weight, classification, etc. and have an acceptable delivery time to meet the recovery
          aircraft‘s mission requirements.
      2.2.2.2. Military Air Transportation. The SAST, or owning C-NAF will coordinate with
      their MAJCOM/A4R for military air transportation when it is determined to be the fastest
