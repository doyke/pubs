     transient, AR will assist Transient Alert.
     1.4.5. Respond to any incident involving aircraft departing the prepared surface, assess
     damage to the aircraft, and accomplish recovery of aircraft if possible.
  1.5. Upon notification, 6 MXS Production Supervisor will:
     1.5.1. Activate the major accident response checklist (Attachment 3) and determine
     preliminary CDDAR capability by applying known aircraft MDS, damage, and condition

       Attachment 7 lists AGE assigned to MacDill for the CDDAR team chief to choose the
       required equipment for that particular recovery operation.
    1.6. Upon notification, the CDDAR team chief will:
       1.6.1. Assemble CDDAR team in the AR Section, Hangar 2, north side, downstairs

       LRS for transportation requirements.
       1.6.3. Immediately contact the appropriate 6 AMXS production supervisor for a situation
       update. Once turnover has been accomplished, notify the MOC that the 6 MXS CDDAR
       team chief has assumed recovery responsibilities under the direction of the incident
       commander.
       1.6.4. Be responsible for directing and coordinating CDDAR operations as directed by
       the incident commander. CDDAR team chief will be designated by 6 MXG/CC.
       1.6.5. Prior to any recovery actions, coordinate with Wing Safety (6 AMW/SE), 6th
       Civil Engineer Squadron, Fire Protection Flight (6 CES/CEF), 6 AMDS/SGPB,
       Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) (6 CES/CED) (if applicable), and incident
       commander about aircraft condition and removal procedures to ensure all hazards
       including toxic materials, munitions, and radioactive materials are eliminated, and the
       aircraft is made safe for recovery activities and investigation team members. Major fuel
       spills will be reported to MacDill Fire Department and the 6 CES Environmental Office
       at Commercial 813-828-0465 or 813-610-4383. Note: Always notify the Fire
       Department (911) immediately if the spill is beyond your capability to safely contain and
       clean the site, or if medical assistance is needed. CAUTION: The area will be
       maintained in an undisturbed state until the aircraft is released to maintenance by the
       appropriate authority. The crash site will only be disturbed to the extent necessary to
       eliminate a situation that is detrimental to the aircraft, support equipment, or personnel.
       Once recovery actions begin, only personnel designated by the CDDAR team chief will
       enter the recovery area.
       1.6.6. Evaluate the aircraft damage and prepare for recovery operations. If more
       recovery personnel are required, a recall of additional qualified personnel will be
       initiated. Provide updated CDDAR capability (Attachment 5) to MOC, incident
       commander, and others as necessary.
       1.6.7. Request additional expertise or equipment through the MOC. If the items or
       personnel are not under the jurisdiction of the 6 MXG/CC, they will be requested through
       the incident commander. If recovery of aircraft requires a crane, refer to Crane Company
MACDILLAFBI21-104 18 OCTOBER 2011                                                              5


      Information (Attachment 4). If extra shoring is required, it will be acquired through local
      purchase.
      1.6.8. Maintain continuous communications with the MOC and keep them informed on
      the progress of the recovery operation to include CDDAR team limitations.
      1.6.9. Ensure complete safety briefings are given at shift change, detailing hazards to
      personnel and equipment.
