This instruction implements AFPD 21-2, Non-nuclear and Nuclear Munitions and AFI 21-201,
Management and Maintenance of Non-Nuclear Munitions, by assigning responsibilities and
establishing procedures for acquisition and review of technical data necessary to ensure safe and
efficient testing, storage, assembly, disassembly, inspection, maintenance, modification and
disposal of munitions and munitions components. It applies to all activities involved in munitions
development, testing, or modification on the Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC) complex.
Interim Technical Orders (TOs) must be authorized in writing by the MAJCOM IAW TO 00-5-
1, AF Technical Order System, and only for a limited period of time. Test or trial programs
involving munitions that deviate from AFI 21-201, Management and Maintenance of Non-
Nuclear Munitions instruction or technical orders require MAJCOM and item manager approval.
Ensure all records created as a result of the processes prescribed in this publication are
maintained in accordance with (IAW) Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of
Records,     and     the    Air   Force     Records     Disposition     Schedule     located    at
https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61a/afrims/afrims.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This instruction has been revised in content and is in compliance with recently changed Air
Force policies and procedures. Added references to AFI 21-201, Management and Maintenance
of Non-Nuclear Munitions. Also added references to the following Data Item Descriptions: DI-
SAFT-80182B, Technical Data for Munitions; DI-SAFT-81299B, Explosive Hazard
Classification Data; DI-SAFT-80931B, Section I Explosive Ord- nance Disposal (EOD)
Procedures; and DI-SAFT-81640, Section J (Demilitarization/Disposi-        tion Procedures)
Ammunitions Demilitarization and Disposition Plan.

1. Policy on Preparation and Delivery of Technical Data. The timely preparation and
delivery of accurate, adequate technical data for munitions and munitions components will be
considered equal in importance to completion and delivery of test hardware. Munitions shipped
to Edwards AFB for which this data has not been provided will be impounded and disposition
2                                                                     EAFBI 21-207 7 Dec 09

action taken as appropriate. No test mission will be scheduled until the required technical data
has been reviewed and approved in accordance with paragraph 3 of this instruction.

2. Technical Data Information Requirements. Attachment 1 is a consolidated requirement of
the technical information required for testing munitions and munitions components; this includes
modifications to munitions and munitions components. Attachment 1 will be used by the
technical writer to ensure all areas have been covered. Attachment 1 was derived from the
following Data Item Descriptions (DID) in the format of DI-SAFT-80182B, Technical Data for
Munitions; DI-SAFT-81299B, Explosive Hazard Classification Data; DI-SAFT-80931B, Section
I Explosive Ordinance Disposal (EOD) Procedures; and DI-SAFT-81640, Section J
(Demilitarization/Disposition Procedures) Ammunitions Demilitarization and Disposition Plan.

3. Routing, Review, and Approval of Technical Data.

3.1. The responsible agency, as defined in paragraph 4, compiles the required technical data and
forwards the munitions procedures to Plans and Programs Manager (412 MXS/MXMWSA), who
will validate the required tech data procedures. After the Plans and Programs Manager approves
the tech data procedures, the tech data will be forwarded to the Senior Munitions Inspector,
Conventional Maintenance and Precision Guided Munitions for any inputs. Once all inputs have
been received the Plans and Program Manager will contact the responsible agency who will then
forward tech data procedures to the Safety Office (AFFTC/SEW), Quality Assurance 412
MXG/MXQ and EOD Division, and 95th Air Base Wing Civil Engineer Directorate
(95 ABW/CED). All actions must be completed no later than 30 days prior to the arrival of
items to Edwards AFB.

3.2. The AFFTC/SEW, 412 MXG/MXQ and 95 ABW/CED will review the tech data package
and forward any changes to the tech data generating agency no later than 21 days prior to arrival
of the test item. The responsible agency makes changes and will send the final version of the
tech data package back to AFFTC/SEW, 412 MXG/MXQ and 95ABW/CED for final review and
approval signature. The signed/approved tech data package will then be returned to the tech data
generating agency who will, in turn, forward to Munitions Plans and Programs within 14 days
prior to the arrival of the test item.

3.3. The 412 MXS/MXMWSA will forward interim TOs and TO deviations electronically to
HQ AFMC/LGMW and item managers for authorized approval in writing, no later than 7 days
prior to arrival of the test item.

3.4. Once final, tech data packages will be kept on ERM under the Edwards’ Munitions Flight
412 MXS/MXMW file plan (URL: \\afftc-center\erm$\412 MXS\MXMW\25\Munitions
Reference Records). The Munitions Flight Plans and Programs Monitor will keep the original on
file.

4. Responsibilities.
