1. Fire Prevention Program Objectives. The objectives of the Maxwell AFB Fire Prevention
Program are to prevent fires, provide an environment for building occupants and the public that
is reasonably safe from fire and similar emergencies, facilitate early intervention at fires that
occur and ensure the safety of exposed personnel, firefighters and emergency responders during
fires. Any delay in the performance of the mission or sacrifice of personnel or equipment due to
fire is a waste of resources. The Air Force requires every activity to have an aggressive fire
prevention program in order to eliminate all potential sources of accidental fire. This requires
effective fire prevention programs and positive individual responsiveness at all levels. Unit
MAXWELLAFBI32-2003 6 MARCH 2013
                                                                                                 3
commanders, facility managers and supervisors must continuously monitor their fire prevention
program and place special emphasis on the indoctrination of personnel regarding their
responsibilities in the prevention of fires.

2. Fire Prevention Regulatory Guidance. In the absence of an applicable Air Force directive
or policy relative to fire prevention issues, criteria contained in National Fire Protection
Association Standards and other recognized agencies apply. In the event of a conflict between
the fire prevention guidance in national consensus standards and Air Force directives, Air Force
directives will take precedence. The Base Fire Marshal will resolve fire prevention issues for
which criteria has not been established or published.

Annex who discovers a fire shall immediately notify the Fire Department by the quickest means
available. All fires, suspected fires and evidence of past fires must be reported to the Fire

   someone to direct the fire apparatus to the fire scene. If it is safe to do so, attempt to

   manager. The functional manager will specify the corrective action taken for each
   discrepancy, sign it, and return it to the Fire Prevention Office by the suspense date. The
