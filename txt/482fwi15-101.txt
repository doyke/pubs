                                          Chapter 1

                               GENERAL INFORMATION.

1.1. General: Operating from 482d Operations Group, Base Operations (482 OG/OSA),
Building 702, the 482 OSS/OSAW provides weather services to the 482 FW, 125th Fighter
Wing, Detachment 1 (125 FW/Det.1), transients, federal agencies and United States (US).
Government contractors assigned to, working on, or operating from, Homestead Air Reserve
Base (HARB). The BWS provides surface weather observations; mission execution forecasts;
observed weather watches, warnings and advisories; pilot-to-metro-service; climatic and
environmental services; meteorological assessments for plans and operations; staff weather
support; and flight weather briefings. The 26th Operational Weather Squadron (26 OWS),
Barksdale Air Force Base (BAFB), Louisiana (LA) is the servicing OWS and provides electronic
flight weather briefings, Terminal Airdrome Forecasts (TAF), as well as forecast weather
watches, warnings, and advisories. If for any reason the 26 OWS is inoperable, the BWS will
assume the backup roll. If building 702 becomes unusable the BWS will relocate to the
Alternate Operating Location (AOL) and resume normal operations. The AOL is located in
room 112 of building 596 and the phone number is Defense Switch Network (DSN) 535-8595.
   1.1.1. Agencies requiring special weather support should contact the BWS to coordinate
   support requirements and provide any pertinent details as early as possible (72 hours’ notice
   is preferred). Agencies requiring recurring support should contact the Weather Operations
   Manager at DSN 535-7511/7513/7786. Users should pick up special products that cannot be
   disseminated via Joint Environmental Toolkit (JET) or emailed from the weather station in
   building 702.
   1.1.2. Adequate notice and close coordination is essential for optimal support. The BWS
   must be kept informed of all changes to the weather sensitivities of assigned aircraft,
   weapons and guidance systems, as well as any other weather criterion affecting operations.
1.2. Terms Explained. See Attachment 1.
1.3. Duty Priorities. Weather personnel can become task saturated at times; e.g., sudden onset
of severe weather, tropical storms, etc. To assist unit personnel in prioritization of customer
support during such situations, principal duty priorities are defined below and posted in the
workplace. Forecasters and observers will adhere to, and supported agencies should have an
understanding of, these priorities.
   1.3.1. Complete Emergency War Order (EWO) Tasking.
   1.3.2. Execute BWS evacuation.
   1.3.3. Respond to aircraft and ground emergencies.
   1.3.4. Respond to Pilot to Metro Service (PMSV) contacts / relay urgent PIREP’s to OWS.
   1.3.5. Provide Supervisor of Flying (SOF) support.
   1.3.6. Review automated observations from the FMQ-19, manually augment (supplement or
   backup) as required by AFMAN 15-111 Chapter 3.
   1.3.7. Provide “Eyes Forward” and MISSIONWATCH support.
 6                                                            482FWI15-101 26 AUGUST 2014


     1.3.8. Severe Weather (SWAP) Operations.
     1.3.9. Perform RADAR interrogation during periods of severe weather.
     1.3.10. Provide Mission Weather Products (MWP’s) / Flight Weather Briefings.
     1.3.11. Prepare and disseminate TAF’s and TAF amendments (Back-up role to 26 OWS).
     1.3.12. Accomplish administrative tasks.
1.4. Capabilities and Limitations.
     1.4.1. The 26 OWS, BAFB, LA issues operational forecasts (TAF) valid for 30 hours.
     Beyond 30 hours, forecasts are intended for planning purposes only. Forecasts or outlooks
     beyond 2 days are largely based on medium and long range forecast models, which decrease
     in accuracy with time.
     1.4.2. A weather observing facility does not exist at the Avon Park range and few reliable
     reporting stations are near it. Observed conditions often differ significantly between the
     range and the surrounding weather observing stations.
     1.4.3. Surface Weather Observing Limitations when augmenting (supplementing or backing
     up) the FMQ-19.
        1.4.3.1. Buildings restrict the view of the horizon from the West through the North.
        1.4.3.2. When the ramp lights are in use, the sky condition is difficult to assess in the
        northeast through southwest quadrants, due to the brightness and glare from the lights.
        1.4.3.3. High noise levels due to transient aircraft operations adjacent to the observation
        site may make it difficult or impossible to hear thunder.
        1.4.3.4. Pilot to Metro Service (PMSV) contact is unreliable between 180° to 270° from
        HARB.
        1.4.3.5. No other Air Force unit uses the same PMSV frequency. As a result, when the
        HARB weather radio is down, tower will perform limited back-up and request aircraft
        contact the 482nd Command Post to initiate a phone patch.
1.5. Tasks and Responsibilities.
     1.5.1. The Weather Operations Manager is responsible for all meteorological support at
     HARB and will:
        1.5.1.1. Communicate with commanders and supported agencies concerning weather
        operations and support requirements to enable warfighters to fully exploit weather and
        space environmental information.
        1.5.1.2. Organize, train, equip, and provide operational, administrative, and logistical
        support for all weather personnel and functions.
        1.5.1.3. Ensure the technical health of all weather products.
        1.5.1.4. Ensure customers are properly notified of weather phenomena posing a threat to
        resources or personnel on HARB.
        1.5.1.5. Plan for the acquisition, integration, and support of weather sensing and
        processing systems to meet current and future Base / Wing mission requirements.
482FWI15-101 26 AUGUST 2014                                                                    7

                                   OBSERVING SERVICES

2.1. General. The weather station is manned 24 hours per day, 7 days a week, including federal
holidays. The AN/FMQ-19 Automated Meteorological Station is the primary source of weather
observations. These are taken automatically by the FMQ-19 and checked for accuracy by the
duty METECH. During periods when the equipment is not functioning, or weather is beyond the
capabilities of the system as outlined in AFMAN 15-111, Chapter 3, the duty METECH will
augment (supplement or back-up) or revert to taking manual observations using a Kestrel 4000
until the issues are resolved. During these periods a BWW surface weather observing program is
conducted with the official observing site in the grass area just east of Building 702, adjacent to
the rain gauge. Due to the limitations discussed in Chapter 1, paragraph 1.4, and in accordance
with AFMAN 15-111, a cooperative weather watch (CWW) is performed by ATC personnel.
The requirements of the CWW are discussed in Attachment 4.
2.2. Measurement of Observed Elements. The following elements are measured and
disseminated for use by various agencies:
   2.2.1. Sky condition. The sky condition is a visual assessment of clouds and atmospheric
   phenomena aloft consisting of an amount, in eighths, and height of the cloud layer base
   above ground level. Heights of layers up to 25,000 feet can be measured using the FMQ-19.
   When a measurement cannot be obtained, heights will be estimated. Local pilot reports
   (PIREPs), RADAR data, ground-based structures and other surface weather observations in
   the area will be used as aids in estimating cloud layer bases.
   2.2.2. Prevailing Visibility and Obstructions to Vision. Prevailing visibility is the greatest
   visibility equaled or exceeded in at least half of the horizon circle and is reported in statute
   miles (SM). Prevailing visibility is determined by evaluating the clarity of line of sight
   visibility to landmarks (i.e., buildings, unfocused lights, markers, etc.) of known distances.
   Obstructions to vision will be reported only when the prevailing visibility is less than 7 miles.
   Precipitation of any type is reported whenever it occurs at the station (within 5SM), or in the
   vicinity (5-1OSM) of the center of the runway complex.
   2.2.3. All elements of the surface weather observation (cloud heights, sky condition,
   visibility, RVR, weather, obstruction to vision, temperature, dew point, and pressure
   readings) are evaluated by the AN/FMQ-19 sensors. During periods when the FMQ-19 is
   not functioning and observations are being taken manually, all elements will be visually
   observed by the duty METECH, and readings from a Kestrel 4000, or other approved backup
   equipment will be used. Runway Visual Range (RVR) will not be available.
   2.2.4. The METECH will monitor the FMQ-19 readings, and perform Operational Risk
   Management (ORM) based augmentation procedures while following the defined duty
   priorities that include augmentation. In all cases, the highest priority will be flight safety. If
   required, the METECH will manually reevaluate the surface prevailing or sector visibility as
   soon as practical, or upon receipt of a differing tower visibility value, and upon receipt of
   subsequent reportable tower visibility value changes.
2.3. Gibson Ridge RADAR Software (GR). The GR RADAR Software can be used to provide
movement, distance, and intensity of clouds containing precipitation, especially thunderstorms,
 10                                                       482FWI15-101 26 AUGUST 2014


within a 248 NM radius of its antenna for inclusion into the observation when seen by the
METECH. It can also provide estimated cloud heights, rainfall amounts, and wind velocities
within 124 NM.
2.4. Types of Observations.
   2.4.1. METAR is a routine scheduled observation as well as the primary observation code
   used by the US to satisfy requirements for reporting surface meteorological data. Complete
   observations are taken every hour between 55 and 59 minutes past the hour. METAR
   observations are recorded on AF Form 3813, Weather Observation Log and disseminated
   both long-line and locally.
   2.4.2. SPECI is an unscheduled observation taken when any of the special criteria listed in
   Attachment 2 has been observed. SPECI observations normally contain all data elements
   found in a METAR observation. SPECI observations are recorded on AF Form 3813 and
   disseminated both long-line and locally.
   2.4.3. Content of observations as seen locally:

                                 FORECASTING SERVICES

3.1. General. The BWS provides forecasting support 24/7 including MWP, flight weather
briefings, PMSV, and observed weather watches, warnings, and advisories. The BWS will issue
the TAF only as backup to the 26 OWS. The 26 OWS Forecast services are available 24/7 and
consist of TAF’s and forecast Weather Watches, Warnings and Advisories.
3.2. Terminal Aerodrome Forecast (TAF). A TAF will be issued for a 30 hour period at
0000, 0800, and 1600 hours ZULU by the 26th OWS, Barksdale AFB, LA. TAF’s will be
disseminated locally and long-line via JET. The BWS will serve as the primary backup, and
assume the TAF responsibilities whenever the OWS is unable to perform this function.
Forecasts focus on the area within 5 nautical miles of the center of the runway complex.
   3.2.1. The following is a labeled example of the forecast format as seen on local
   disseminations:
   3.2.2. TAF Specification Criteria. The forecast, scheduled or amended, will specify the time
   of occurrence to the nearest hour, duration, and intensity (where applicable), of the following

       include weather for all scheduled flying areas.
       3.3.2.2. MWP’s will be updated 1 hour before 93d FS brief time prior to the next
       scheduled takeoff time. Updated MWP’s will supersede those previously issued and will
       be valid from one hour prior to the next scheduled takeoff until 1 hour after scheduled
       recovery only.
       3.3.2.3. MWP’s will be completed 7 days a week due to FANG alert requirements.
   3.3.3. Route and flight METWATCH is provided by the METECH continuously monitoring
   weather conditions effecting, or having the potential to effect, base resources, flight
   operations, special missions, and/or VIP arrivals/departures at HARB. If a significant change
   to route, range, or landing weather is observed or forecast, the duty METECH will make
   every effort to relay the changes to the appropriate individuals. This will be done via the
   most expeditious means; i.e., SOF, 482d Operations Group, Control Tower (482 OG/OSAT),
   93FS, Operations (93 FS/DO), etc.
   3.3.4. Out-of-station briefings for special missions or multi-ship formations, flying safety,
   seasonal, and instrument refresher briefings, are provided upon request and must be
   coordinated as far in advance as possible.
   3.3.5. Other unscheduled briefings for HARB units should be requested at least 72 hours in
   advance. Note: Homestead BWS is manned to have only one person on duty Monday thru
   Friday from 16:30L – 0730L and also all weekends and federal holidays. It is essential that
   arrangements be made in advance if customers require out of station support during these
   periods.
3.4. Pilot-to-Metro Service.

                WEATHER WATCHES, WARNINGS AND ADVISORIES

4.1. General. Certain weather conditions endanger property or life, pose a safety hazard, or
adversely affect a supported agency’s operations. The 26 OWS and BWS operate under a
watch/warning system, through the issuance of watches when the “potential” for specified
hazardous weather exists and the issuance of weather warnings and advisories when it is
imminent or occurring. Supported agencies then make appropriate operational decisions and
take necessary protective actions.
   4.1.1. Forecast 26 OWS and observed BWS weather watches, warnings, and advisories are
   issued 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
   4.1.2. Weather personnel issue, amend, extend, upgrade and downgrade weather watches,
   warnings and advisories for HARB encompassing an area not greater than 5 nautical miles,
   except as noted, from the center of the runway complex.
       4.1.2.1. All forecast 26 OWS and observed BWS weather watches, warnings and
       advisories will be disseminated via JET to 482 FW/CP, 482 OG/OSAT, 93 FS, 125
       FW/CP, and 482 OG Deployed Unit Complex (DUC) when operational.
       4.1.2.2. Except for an observed lightning warning, only one warning will be in effect at a
       time, and it will include all elements which meet warning criteria.
       4.1.2.3. In the case of a warning for strong wind, the text will include the peak wind
       expected during the valid period.
       4.1.2.4. In the case of the heavy rainfall warning, the BWS will notify the 482 FW/CP
       once 2” of rainfall has occurred in the preceding 12 hours. This is in addition to
       notification of the warning being issued or cancelled.
       4.1.2.5. In the case of observed lightning warnings and all other observed advisories, the
       valid period may be transmitted as “UFN”, meaning “until further notice”.
       4.1.2.6. More than one advisory may be in effect at any given time.
       4.1.2.7. All newly issued watches, warnings and advisories will state, in the text, their
       effect on any previously issued watches, warnings and advisories.
       4.1.2.8. Extensions will be issued prior to the original product’s expiration and can only
       change the ending valid time.

7.2. Procedures.
   7.2.1. Homestead BWS will fully exploit online forecast resources provided by the tropical
   cyclone forecast centers such as the National Hurricane Center located in Miami, Florida
   (FL) and the 26 OWS.
   7.2.2. METCH will not deviate from the official forecast position, track, movement, forecast
   cone, and maximum wind speed associated with a tropical cyclone except for the following:
       7.2.2.1. Warnings and advisories issued for feeder band convective activity (away from
       the storm center) may exceed forecast maximum wind for that time period.
       7.2.2.2. The TAF may have differing hurricane wind speeds if terrain, foliage, and land
       use data for HARB indicates higher or lower wind speeds than originally forecasted.
       7.2.2.3. The 26 OWS hazard products will depict tropical cyclone centers, and caveat
       that moderate to severe flight hazards are implied in and near tropical cyclones. The non-
       convective hazards in areas where synoptic-scale features interact with the tropical
       cyclone will be depicted on graphical charts.
       7.2.2.4. Homestead BWS will perform METWATCH responsibilities and serve as the
       primary liaison between the National Hurricane Center and local customers.
       7.2.2.5. Requests for tropical storm information from non-operational sources will be
       directed to publically available products from responsible forecast agencies (National
       Weather Service, National Hurricane Center, etc).
7.3. Tropical Cyclone Threat Assessment Product (TC-TAP).
   7.3.1. The purpose of the TC-TAP is to provide a standardized product for exploitation units
   to use in assisting installation commanders and Emergency Management personnel in
   making decisions on the evacuation and sheltering of aircraft and personnel, and on other
   mitigation actions.
   7.3.2. The 26 OWS will produce a coordinated TC-TAP for HARB when sustained wind
   speeds of ≥ 35 knots are forecast during the next 96 hours as a result of a tropical cyclone.
       7.3.2.1. The TC-TAP will contain, at a minimum, the following:
           7.3.2.1.1. Time and date the TC-TAP was produced and the NHC bulletin number
           used to create the product.
           7.3.2.1.2. Onset and duration of sustained 35 knot and 50 knot winds.
           7.3.2.1.3. Peak wind and time of occurrence, including gusts.

         7.3.2.1.4. Onset and duration of 25 knot crosswinds, including gusts, for the primary
         instrumented runway.
         7.3.2.1.5. Closest point of approach of the storm relative to HARB.
         7.3.2.1.6. Forecast cone product.
7.4. Preparation and Dissemination of TC-TAP.
   7.4.1. The 26 OWS will:
      7.4.1.1. Use approved software applications.
      7.4.1.2. The standardized software for producing TC threat assessments is the tropical
      cyclone software contained in the baseline OWS Production System.
      7.4.1.3. The TC-TAP will be valid through a minimum of 96 hours and updated as new
      information is received from the National Hurricane Center.
      7.4.1.4. Develop procedures to expeditiously disseminate the TC-TAP information to all
      applicable organizations. Ensure TC-TAP information is consistent from initial
      dissemination through actual posting of the information on the webpage.

Terms
Aircraft Mishap—Used to denote the occurrence of an aircraft accident or incident. It does not
include in flight emergencies.
Basic Weather Watch (BWW)—During periods when the FMQ-19 Automated Observing
System is not operational, or the weather is beyond the equipments ability to accurately measure,
the duty METECH will visibly check weather conditions as appropriate. Depending on the
situation the METECH will Augment, Supplement, or back up the FMQ-19 (IAW AFMAN 15-
111 Chapter 3) until the issue is resolved.
Ceiling—The height above ground level of the lowest broken (5/8ths coverage or more) or
overcast (8/8ths coverage) cloud layer or the vertical visibility into an indefinite ceiling.
Cooperative Weather Watch (CWW)—The name given to the cooperative effort between
weather and control tower personnel, in identifying significant weather changes. Due to the
METECH’s limited view of the horizon and the need to perform other duties, tower personnel
notify the METECH of the occurrence of previously unreported weather conditions, which could
affect flight safety or could be critical to the safety of other local operations and resources.
Desired Lead Time—The amount of advance notice an agency requires prior to the onset of a
particular weather phenomenon.
Hurricane Conditions (HURCON)—Special forecasts for high winds associated with
hurricanes or tropical storms. When storms threaten South Florida, the 482 FW/CC declares
HURCON levels based on information provided by BWS personnel.
HURCON V— In effect annually between 01 June and 30 November (hurricane season)
HURCON IV— Declared 96 hours prior to the onset of 50 knot winds.
HURCON III— Declared 72 hours prior to the onset of 50 knot winds.
HURCON II— Declared 48 hours prior to the onset of 50 knot winds.
HURCON I— Declared 24 hours prior to the onset of 50 knot winds.
HURCON I-E— Storm arrival. Sustained 50kt winds are occurring and dangerous conditions
associated with the storm are present. Outside activity is prohibited.
HURCON I-R— Recovery. When winds in excess of 35kt have subsided for a sustained period
of two hours or more. Life-threatening storm hazards have passed but damage may persist and
only emergency responders and damage assessment personnel are released to move about.
Indefinite Ceiling—The vertical visibility, reported in feet, into a surface based total
obscuration which hides the celestial dome (8/8ths coverage).
Joint Environmental Tool Kit (JET)—The primary means of dissemination for all weather
data and products at Homestead ARB.
METWATCH—The process of monitoring the weather and informing designated agencies
when certain weather conditions could impact operations or pose a hazard to life or property.
Mission Weather Product—A forecast used for the execution of a specific military mission or
activity.
482FWI15-101 26 AUGUST 2014                                                                     29


Planning Forecast—A forecast, usually provided well in advance, for the planning of a military
mission or activity. This forecast is intended solely for mission planning only and should never
be used for operational purposes.
Prevailing Visibility—The greatest visibility equaled or exceeded throughout at least one-half
the horizon circle. The visibility does not have to be continuous throughout 180 consecutive
degrees; i.e., it may be composed of sectors distributed anywhere around the horizon circle.
Runway Visual Range (RVR)—The maximum distance at which the runway, or specified
lights or markers delineating it, can be seen from a position above a specified point on its center
line at a height corresponding to the average eye level of pilots at touch-down.

Terminal Aerodrome Forecast (TAF)–The TAF is the summation of the 30 hour projected
forecast. Pertinent data and meteorological reasoning are combined into a concise text depiction
of what the atmosphere is expected to do for a 30-hour period. The TAF is used primarily to
support flight operations and general base activities.
Weather Advisory (WA)—A special notice provided to supported customers that alerts them to
weather conditions that could affect their operation.
Weather Warning (WW)—A special notice provided to supported customers that alerts them to
weather conditions of such intensity as to pose a hazard to life or property.
Weather Watch (WATCH)—A special notice issued to advise affected agencies of the
potential for warning level weather conditions before actually issuing the warning.
