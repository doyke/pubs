1. General: The primary mission of Base HG (BHG) is to provide well-trained, highly
professional members to honor and carry out the primary mission of rendering military funeral
honors. The compositions of military funeral honors are required by law that is cited in DODI
1300.15, Military Funeral Support. Upon request, the BHG will ensure that a funeral honors
ceremony is provided for all eligible members. The BHG will also support protocol and joint
ceremonial functions for military and select civilian personnel, time and resources permitting.
     1.1. Military Funeral Honors (MFH) takes precedence over all other HG duties. The
     preferred method of receiving requests is through the Funeral Home Director (FHD).
JBCHARLESTONI34-242 26 OCTOBER 2011                                                           3


   Families should not call the base directly. Request for MFH may be made 24 hours/7 days a
   week by faxing request to (843) 760-1764; confirm receipt of fax by calling (843) 767-2134.
   1.2. FHDs should allow at least a 48-hour lead time to allow preparation time for the Honors
   Team. Requests for Fly-over for eligible veterans require at least five duty days lead time.
   1.3. Joint Ceremonial Honors will be performed by the Navy-Air Force Honors Team when
   requested and/or deemed appropriate by wing leadership.
   1.4. The area of responsibility (AOR) for the BHG covers a combined 41 counties in North
   Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. The area encompasses 36,000 square miles and
   extends north to the southern portion of North Carolina and as far south as Darien, Georgia.
   This area includes Florence and Beaufort National Cemeteries (reference Attachment 1).
   Given the importance of the BHG mission, this instruction establishes a quota-based system
   to ensure adequate manning is available to render honors.
   1.5. The BHG program expenses will be supported with base O&M funds and budgeted
   through the 628th Force Support Squadron (628 FSS/CC).
   1.6. Basic Allowance for Subsistence (BAS) will be provided to members who reside in base
   dormitories during active membership on BHG “tour”.
2. Unit Quotas and Rotation:
   2.1. The BHG will consist of two flights: Alpha and Bravo. Each flight will be comprised of
   23 full-time members assigned. Each member will serve two alternating 90-day rotations
   within a consecutive 12 month period to complete a BHG “tour”. Each rotation will
   commensurate with recognized calendar quarters, i.e., January-February-March (reference
   Attachment 2).
      2.1.1. Due to mission requirements, members of the Airlift Squadrons will be assigned
      on monthly rotations. Two of said squadrons will maintain one member per rotation at
      all times.
      2.1.2. Units may choose to rotate members on sequential 90-day rotations for a total of 6
      consecutive months to complete a BHG “tour”.
   2.2. Unit allocations will be based on the enlisted strength of E-6 and below. However,
   quotas can be filled from all enlisted and officer ranks (reference Attachment 3). Each year,
   the Mortuary Affairs Coordinator will recalculate the manning quotas. Allocations shall be
   assigned to each Group and should be viewed as minimum levels expected from each
   function. Units are allowed and encouraged to exceed their quotas. Any request to decrease
   a unit’s BHG quota must be approved by the installation commander.
      2.2.1. The BHG NCOIC is recruited from SSgt thru MSgt personnel. This number is not
      included in the BHG unit quotas. The BHG NCOIC will be appointed in writing by the
      628 FSS/CC for a minimum period of 18 months to a maximum of 24 months. He/She
      will be responsible for the overall performance, discipline, appearance, and competence
      of BHG team members
   2.3. During active rotation, the BHG training facility at 4450 New Mexico Avenue, Hunley
   Park, will serve as the BHG member’s official duty location. Guardsmen on rotation are
   exempt from participating in Base exercises. While the BHG NCOIC assumes tactical

     control, respective units will continue to maintain administrative control of all BHG
     members. All appointments, leaves, and AFS-related training will be coordinated though the
     BHG NCOIC.
     2.4. The following units are tasked to support the BHG program:

Figure 1. Units Tasked to Support the BHG Program.




        2.4.1. Honor Guard volunteers are preferred but not mandatory. Assigned members will
        report directly to the BHG as their primary duty section while assigned on rotation.
     2.5. All units must provide an alternate if shortfalls occur with a primary BHG member.
     Shortfalls include but are not limited to PCS, PT failures, profiles, separation, discharge, etc.
        2.5.1. Units will be responsible for the ceremonial uniform replacement cost of
        approximately $650.00 if a member is withdrawn without replacement prior to “tour”
        completion through no fault of the member or the BHG.
3. Tour of Duty.
     3.1. The minimum BHG commitment is two 90-day rotations per “tour”. This will provide
     Airmen and supervisors with greater predictability and stability while ensuring the BHG
     program has the trained and ready cadre needed to support rising requirements. Assignments
     will not be during a member’s deployment timeframe to include reach-back and
     reconstitution periods. Upon completion of “tour”, BHG members are highly encouraged to
     return for another cycle.
     3.2. A BHG member may not be released from the BHG before the complete “tour”
     commitment has been served. Exceptions include:
        3.2.1. A unit replaces a non-volunteer member with a uniformed/trained volunteer from
        his/her unit.
JBCHARLESTONI34-242 26 OCTOBER 2011                                                            5


      3.2.2. The member receives an assignment. If this happens, the unit will be required to
      provide a replacement within 60 days of assignment notification.
      3.2.3. The member receives UCMJ punishment. The BHG NCOIC will be notified by
      the unit’s First Sergeant if a member is no longer fit to be a BHG member. Final
      dismissal of the member rests with his/her Commander, Chief, and First Sergeant.
   3.3. As a prospective member of the BHG, the member is required to maintain the highest
   standards of military bearing, dress, appearance, behavior, and attitude both on-and-off duty.
   Members failing to comply with these instructions may be removed from the BHG. In the
   event that an individual is “removed” before completing their commitment, it automatically
   negates consideration for any awards and decorations. The member will return his/her entire
   uniform and/or the unit will repay the 628th Force Support Squadron for all issued uniform
   items.
4. Application Procedures and Screenings.

                JOINT BASE CHARLESTON HONOR GUARD CONTRACT


I, _________________                           (Print Rank/Name), SSN:                        is
appointed as a member of the Charleston AFB Honor Guard team effective:
______________(yyyy/mm/dd). I understand that I will be committed to the team for a time not to be
less than 9 months. Once assigned to the team, my unit’s first sergeant, chief or commander written
approval will be required prior to my resignation/removal (if prior to commitment expiration time); I
also understand that I must submit a 60-day written notice of resignation.

I am aware and will adhere to the following policy/criteria:

DUTY/DETAILS:                                          Initials: ____________________
I understand that I will make every effort possible to avail myself in fulfilling details that are tasked
to me. The JBC Honor Guard duty hours are “when called upon.” Every effort must be made by me
to be available for Honor Guard details. It is imperative that request(s) for funeral details be filled in
a timely and orderly fashion. I have been made aware that funeral detail requests often lend as little
as 24-hours notice prior to honors performance date/time. As an Honor Guard member, I will be in
compliance with time(s) “posted” to meet for a detail.

I am aware that I must report no later than the posted arrival time for each function and be ready for
uniform inspection prior to departure. I also realize that I must contact the designated detail leader if
I am running late for any function. If I am unable to perform a function that I have committed to, I
must notify the HG NCOIC and detail leader immediately. All JBCHonor Guard team members are
considered to be on “Telephone Stand-By” at all times with the exception of excused absences. I am
required to call the HG recorder, (843) 767-9214, between the hours of 1700-2000 each day during
reserve rotation.

ABSENCES:                                                Initials: ___________________
As a member of the AFB Honor Guard, I understand that it is MY responsibility to expeditiously
inform the Honor Guard NCOIC of any projected absences to include: scheduled leave, TDY, Day-
passes (from regular duties), hospital quarters, and/or appointments. Absences in excess of 24 hours
from the local area must be coordinated through the HG NCOIC with appropriate documents, i.e.,
travel orders, AF Form 988, Leave Request/Authorization. Honor Guard duty is not to be used as an
excuse to miss mandatory appointments. Request for absences to meet official/real-world related
duties must be submitted in writing with sufficient time to allow for scheduling adjusted if required.
A simple email will be sufficient.

TRAINING:                                                Initials: ___________                   ______
I am not currently on any profiles that will preclude me from fully participating in Honor Guard
training sessions and details. By endorsing this contract, I agree to attend posted training/practice
sessions. I understand that my first two months on the team is a probationary period in which time I
will progressively increase in proficiency all aspects of Honor Guard protocol.

BEARING AND BEHAVIOR:                               Initials: ___________________
I am a member of the JBC Honor Guard. I realize that I will maintain the highest standards of
conduct and professionalism, fully upholding the Air Force core values of “Integrity first, Service
 24                                            JBCHARLESTONI34-242 26 OCTOBER 2011


before Self, and Excellence in all we Do”, on and off duty. I will refrain from consumption of
alcoholic beverages 12 hours prior to performance of any detail. I understand that public smoking is
forbidden while in the ceremonial uniform.

DRESS AND APPEARANCE:                                   Initials: __________________
I will be issued a Ceremonial Service Dress uniform and all accouterments free of charge with the
exception of authorized ribbons and badges, which I must provide. It is mandatory that all
authorized accouterments be worn on the uniform. I am solely responsible for maintaining and
keeping uniform and accouterments clean, pressed, and in serviceable condition at all times. I am
authorized cleaning of the ceremonial uniform free of charge. If removed from the JBCHonor Guard
team, I understand that all issued uniform items must be returned promptly. I am also aware that I
will be required to always comply with the dress and appearance and fitness standards outlined in
AFI 36-2903 and AFI 10-248. I have been briefed that failure to achieve/maintain a passing score of
75% or better during scheduled unit fitness test may be cause for my removal from the team.

FUNERAL REQUIREMENTS:                                     Initials: ____________________
I understand that military funeral honors are mandated by Congress and requests may not go unfilled.
I also understand that I may only be excused from funeral details by my unit’s first sergeant, chief
or commander.
I have read and understand all information presented in this membership agreement. I will act in
accordance with all the rules and regulations stated in this contract:
