This instruction implements AFPD 36-8, Employee Benefits and Entitlements. This instruction establishes
policy and defines procedures for implementing and maintaining the 5/4-9 Compressed Work Schedule
Program at the 939th Air Refueling Wing, Portland IAP.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This revision changes unit designation from 939th Rescue Wing to 939th Air Refueling Wing. A bar (|)
indicates revision from previous edition.


1. Policy:
   1.1. The 5/4-9 Compressed Work Schedule Program, an alternate work schedule (AWS), applies to all
   939th Air Refueling Wing (939 ARW) organizations and its civilian employees.
   1.2. The following factors will be continuously monitored in assessing whether to maintain an AWS;
   efficiency and productivity, impact on morale, tardiness and turnover rates, job opportunities for
   working spouses/parents, car pools, use of mass transportation, and utility consumption.
   1.3. Approval of AWS schedules will be preceded by a careful study of the foregoing factors and the
   extent of flexibility possible in a particular organization based on relevant considerations such as mis-
   sion accomplishment, peak workload periods, and necessary contacts with other organizations.
   1.4. Supervisors will determine the minimum numbers and kinds of employees required for any given
   tour of duty, and may restrict an employee's choice of AWS “off day” during the pay period. Supervi-
   sors will exempt from the AWS program any employee whose participation would create an adverse
   impact. Supervisors who wish to appoint employees to permanent schedules that are not congruent
   with the predetermined AWS scheduled hours may do so only with the senior air reserve technician’s
   (ART) approval.

    1.5. While TDY, employees will work the hours that coincide with duty hours at the temporary duty
    location. For training, inspections, by higher headquarters, etc., the duty hours will normally be deter-
    mined by the OPR. The maximum possible advance notice will be given to affected employees. Nor-
    mally, employees on TDY of more than two days will be required to revert to a 5 day, 8 hour
    workweek for that pay period(s). The facts and circumstances of each case will determine the deci-
    sion. Duration of the assignment and purpose will be prime considerations.

2. Definitions:
    2.1. Basic Work Requirement: The number of hours, excluding overtime hours which an employee is
    required to work or to account for by leave or otherwise is 80 hours bi-weekly. This consists of eight
    (8) 9-hour days and one (1) 8-hour day during the bi-weekly pay period. For most employees, the
    recurring day off must be selected as the first or second Monday of the pay period, or the first or sec-
    ond Friday of each pay period. The eight hour day may be before or after the recurring day off, but
    must fall within the same pay period.
    2.2. Part-time Employment: Under this program, the definition of part-time employment is changed
    from a weekly work requirement of 16 to 32 hours to a bi-weekly requirement of 32 to 64 hours. This
    meant that a part-time career employee can be scheduled for more than 32 hours per week, as long as
    the total scheduled hours per bi-weekly pay period do not exceed 64.

3. Request for AWS Schedule:
    3.1. An employee will request, in writing, approval of the requested schedule in accordance with
    Attachment 1. The schedule must be approved prior to the beginning of the pay period and conform
    to the times described in paragraph 4.1. below. The request must be submitted no later than the
    Wednesday prior to the beginning of the pay period affected. The most recent letter must be main-
    tained by the supervisors or timekeeper until superseded by a new approved request. All changes to
    the AWS schedule of a subject employee should be maintained IAW AFMAN 37-139, Records Dispo-
    sition Schedule.
    3.2. An employee has the option, with supervisory approval, to select a lunch period of 45 minutes or
    one (1) hour in duration. Deviations may be entertained by supervisors on an exception basis. At the
    minimum, an employee must take a thirty minute lunch period.

4. AWS Schedule:
    4.1. Tour of Duty:
       4.1.1. On the 9-hour days:
           4.1.1.1. 0630 to 1615 with a 45 minute lunch; or
           4.1.1.2. 0630 to 1630 with a one hour lunch.
       4.1.2. On the 8-hour days:
           4.1.2.1. 0630 to 1515 with a 45 minute lunch; or
           4.1.2.2. 0630 to 1530 with a one hour lunch.

   4.2. Student Aid (Stay-In-School Employees): These employees are limited to working 20 hours per
   week. Their scheduled tour of duty, however, must be within the hours established in paragraph 4.1.
   above and be approved by their supervisor.

5. Responsibilities:
   5.1. The Senior ART retains the authority and is responsible for making determinations concerning
   continued use of the program.
   5.2. The Civilian Personnel office is responsible for furnishing guidance and assistance to all levels of
   management on the administration of the AWS program in accordance with governing authorities.
   5.3. Management officials are responsible for:
       5.3.1. Reviewing for regulatory compliance, all request letters for AWS schedule.
       5.3.2. Approving when possible and disapproving when necessary, requests for AWS schedules
       consistent with the need for efficient operations.
       5.3.3. Assuring integrity of time and attendance sheets.
       5.3.4. Ensuring that employees comply with approved schedules and regulatory requirements.
       5.3.5. Recognizing and acting upon abuses of the program.
   5.4. Employees are responsible for:
       5.4.1. Complying with the regulations and administrative procedures governing the program.
       5.4.2. Being flexible in their schedules to meet heavy workloads or unusual work requirements.

6. Premium Pay:
   6.1. Overtime Pay. AWS provisions do not affect overtime pay provisions. Hours of work officially
   ordered in advance and in excess of the scheduled daily work requirement or in excess of 80 hours
   during the bi-weekly pay period are overtime work. Employees are entitled to overtime pay for
   over-time work according to applicable provisions of the law.
   6.2. Holiday pay. A full-time employee who performs non-overtime work on a holiday (or a day des-
   ignated as the “in lieu of” holiday) is entitled to basic pay plus premium pay equal to basic pay for that
   holiday work, not to exceed 9 hours.

7. Absence and Leave:
   7.1. Time Off. Any time off during an employee’s scheduled basic work week must be accounted for
   by approved leave or compensatory time off for the specific number of hours absent from duty. This
   will be up to the number of hours scheduled for that day (8 or 9 hours).
   7.2. Military Leave. Military leave is not affected by the AWS program even though it is earned and
   charged on the basis of hours. Employee will be charged the amount of hours he or she is scheduled to
   work. No leave will be charged for weekends or scheduled day off (SDO).
   7.3. Holidays. A full-time employee who is relieved or prevented from working on a day designated
   as a holiday is entitled to pay for the scheduled hours for that holiday (8 or 9 hours). When an
4                                                                      939ARWI36-807 1 APRIL 2003


    employee has three consecutive workdays off and a holiday falls on one of these non-workdays, the
    following rules apply in designating the “in lieu of” holidays:
       7.3.1. When the holiday falls on the employee’s first non-workday, the preceding workday shall
       be designated as the “in lieu of” holiday.
       7.3.2. When the holiday falls on the employee’s third non-workday, the following workday shall
       be designated as the “in lieu of” holiday..
    7.4. Hazardous Weather Conditions:
       7.4.1. Late Reporting. A case-by-case basis for granting excused absence should be used where
       employees are delayed for reporting to work because of hazardous weather conditions. The
       amount of time to be excused should be based on the amount of extra time it takes the employee to
       commute to work. For example, normally it takes employee “A” ½ hour to commute to work, but
       because of extreme weather conditions it takes 1½ hours to reach work. In this case, one hour of
       absence may be excuse. If employee “B” normally commutes to work in 15 minutes, but because
       of hazardous weather conditions it takes 45 minutes to reach work, ½ hour of excused absence
       would be appropriate. Normally, tardiness for less than two hours may be excused. The granting of
       excused absences in excess of two hours must be in accordance with AFI 36-815, Chapter 7,
       Paragraph 7.6.2.
       7.4.2. Early Dismissal. When the commander/senior ART makes a decision to dismiss employees
       from work because of hazardous weather conditions, all employees, except those designated as
       critical service employees, will normally be allowed to leave a specified length of time in advance
       of their normal quitting time.

8. Other. The statutory provisions of Title 5 relating to the earning of sick and annual leave or entitle-
ment to military and funeral leave, and in some cases creditable service for retirement purposes, have as a
frame of reference the 8-hour day with the result that the provisions are stated in terms of “days.” Such
references to a day or workday shall be considered to be references to 8 hours. The AWS program is not
intended to either decrease or increase an employee’s existing entitlement to leave or creditable service
for retirement purposes.
