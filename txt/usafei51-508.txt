SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and should be completely reviewed. Major
changes include a title change from 3AFI51-304 to USAFEI51-508 and the OPR change from
3rd Air Force-United Kingdom (3AF-UK) to Headquarters, United States Air Forces in Europe,
Detachment 1, which is referred to throughout this document as United States Air Forces in
Europe-United States Air Forces Africa/United Kingdom (USAFE-AFAFRICA/UK). It changes
the title and other references from British Nationals (BN) to Local Nationals (LN). It also sets
out in detail the duties of the Complaints Review Board and the Investigating Officer appointed
to assist the Board.
1. Forwarding of Complaints. Complaints by LN’s alleging mistreatment by USAF members
while stationed in the UK and while in performance of their official duties may be initially
received by a local police force, the Ministry of Defense Police (MDP), the Royal Air Force
(RAF) Commander on a USAF occupied base, or the USAF itself. In each case, such complaints
should be passed via the RAF Commander to the USAF Law Enforcement desk at the relevant
base and to the Senior RAF Liaison Office (RAFLO) at USAFE-UK, RAF Mildenhall (T-1).
2. Processing of Complaints. If a complaint is not capable of informal resolution, it shall be
forwarded to the office of the United States Country Representative to the United Kingdom (UK
USCR), RAF Mildenhall. A member of his administrative staff shall log in the complaint (T-1).
3. Complaints Review Board.
     3.1. The UK USCR or his designated representative in his absence will convene a board with
     due diligence. The board shall be composed of three members: a representative from the
     Office of Legal Services, USAFE-UK/JA; a representative from the Air Force Office of
     Special Investigations (AFOSI); and a Security Forces representative from USAFE-UK/IR,
     (International Relations). The junior ranking member shall serve as the recorder. The board
     is authorized to augment with other advisors, as they deem appropriate; however only the
     three board members shall be voting members. Once convened, the review board shall be the
     primary duty of the board members (T-1).
     3.2. The UK USCR or his designated representative in his absence may appoint an
     Investigating Officer (IO) to assist the board. Once appointed, the duties of the investigating
     officer shall be the primary duty of the IO (T-1).
4. Duties of the Board.
     4.1. The board will immediately provide a copy of the complaint and any available
     documentation regarding the complaint to the investigating officer for use in gathering
     further evidence (T-1).
     4.2. The board will investigate the complaint, ensuring the investigation is conducted
     independently of all other investigations, though evidence obtained by other investigations
     may be used (T-1).
     4.3. The board will ensure, and may request from UK authorities, access to all pertinent
     documentation necessary to facilitate a thorough understanding of the facts.
USAFEI51-508 17 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                3


   4.4. The board will receive all documentation and evidence gathered and review the same to
   assure a complete investigation. If the board has authority to explore further avenues
   regarding the complaint, the board may direct an IO to reopen his inquiries (T-1).
   4.5. The board will provide a report of its findings to the USCR for his consideration,
   attaching a copy of the IO’s Report of Investigation (Paragraph 5.4). The board may include
   recommendations for corrective actions in its report (T-1).
5. Duties of the IO.
   5.1. The IO will collect written statements from the complainant and any other witnesses the
   complainant may produce or whom the IO deems has relevant information to provide to the
   board.
   5.2. The IO may, at the discretion of the board, also interview the complainant or any other
   witness, if the witness is willing to be interviewed. The UK police force may assist if
   requested to do so by the IO. Any interview of the complainant should be recorded and
   transcribed verbatim.
   5.3. The IO will gather all pertinent regulations, operating instructions and guidance
   concerning any standards alleged by the complainant to have been breached by members of
   the U.S. Forces, and provide copies of the same to the board.
   5.4. The IO will provide the evidence and documentation gathered to the board in the form
   of a Report of Investigation (ROI).          The ROI will not contain conclusions or
   recommendations for corrective action (T-1).
6. Reporting Results of Complaint Review. After completion of the investigation, and review
and consideration by appropriate USAF authorities, the results of the investigation will be
conveyed through the RAFLO (or his designated representative in his absence) to the RAF
Commander of the base concerned, who will then write to the complainant, informing the
complainant of the results of the investigation. NOTE: The USAF will release only the results of
the investigation to the RAFLO, and not the complete report. A copy of the letter to the
complainant shall be sent to the agency, which originally received the complaint (T-1).
