This instruction provides policy guidance that is common to investigating and reporting all US Air Force
mishaps. Four safety manuals supplement this AFI and provide detailed guidance to discipline specific
mishaps. AFMAN 91-221, Weapons Safety Investigations and Reports, provides additional guidance for
investigating and reporting nuclear, guided missile, explosives and chemical agents, and directed energy
mishaps. AFMAN 91-222, Space Safety Investigations and Reports, provides additional guidance for
investigating and reporting space mishaps. AFMAN 91-223, Aviation Safety Investigations and Reports,
provides additional guidance for investigating and reporting aviation mishaps. AFMAN 91-224, Ground
Safety Investigations and Reports, provides additional guidance for investigating and reporting afloat,
motor vehicle, off-duty military, and ground and industrial mishaps. AFI 91-204 implements AFPD 91-2,
Safety Programs, and DODI 6055.7, Accident Investigation, Reporting and Record Keeping. AFI 91-204
applies to commanders, managers, supervisors, and safety staffs at all levels, all persons who investigate
and report Air Force mishaps, and those persons who handle such reports. This instruction provides guid-
ance regarding the control and use of privileged safety reports and information. Failure to observe the pro-
hibitions and mandatory provisions in Chapter 3 by active duty Air Force members, USAFR members on
active duty or inactive duty for training, and ANG members in federal status, is a violation of Article 92,
Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). Violations by civilian employees may result in administrative
disciplinary actions without regard to otherwise applicable criminal or civil sanctions for violations of
related laws. This regulation implements North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Standardization
Agreements (STANAG) 3101, Exchange of Safety Information Concerning Aircraft and Missiles, 3102,
Flight Safety Co-operation in Common Ground/Air Space; 3531, Safety investigation and Reporting of
Accident/Incidents Involving Military Aircraft and/or Missiles; and 3750, Reporting and Investigation of

SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This change incorporates Interim Change 2006-1 and reflects DoDI 6055.7 guidance regarding mishap
categories. It also provides additional information on how to classify and record injuries. It provides addi-
tional guidance for compliance with the Privacy Act of 1974 and handling of privileged information. It
updates Table 6.2. Reporting and Briefing Schedule, and updates the use of some AF Forms. Finally, it
clarifies the definitions of some terms in Attachment 1. The entire text of the IC is at the last attachment.

                                     GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Purpose of Safety Investigations and Reports.
   1.1.1. Safety investigations and reports are conducted and written solely to prevent future mishaps.
   Safety investigations take priority over any corresponding legal investigations, except Friendly Fire
   mishaps (paragraph 4.11.1.). Conduct safety and legal investigations separately to protect privileged
   safety information in the safety report. Privileged safety information will be used solely for mishap
   prevention.
   1.1.2. Legal investigations provide a publicly releasable report of the facts and circumstances sur-
   rounding a mishap. Legal investigations may include a statement of opinion on the cause of the acci-
   dent, gather and preserve evidence for claims, litigation, disciplinary and adverse administrative
   actions, and for all other purposes. An Accident Investigation Board (AIB) is one type of legal inves-
   tigation and is convened for many space, aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), and missile mis-
   haps IAW AFI 51-503, Aerospace Accident Investigations. A Commander Directed Investigation
   (CDI) is another type of legal investigation that may be convened for mishaps.

1.2. Waivers to this Instruction. Waivers to this instruction will be requested through the MAJCOM/
SE to HQ USAF/SE.

1.3. Mishaps and Events that Require Safety Investigations and Reports.
1.3. (ACC) Mishaps and Events that Require Safety Investigations and Reports. See appropriate
AFMAN 91-22X series.
   1.3.1. A mishap is an unplanned occurrence, or series of occurrences, that results in damage or injury
   as described in paragraph 1.3.1.1. and meets Class A, B, C, or D mishap reporting criteria IAW para-
   graph 1.8. All mishaps require a safety investigation and report.
       1.3.1.1. Damage or injury includes: damage to DOD property; occupational illness to DOD mili-
       tary or civilian personnel; injury to DOD military personnel on- or off-duty; injury to on-duty
       DOD civilian personnel; damage to public or private property, or injury or illness to non-DOD
       personnel caused by Air Force operations.
   1.3.2. An event is an unplanned occurrence, or series of occurrences, that does not meet mishap
   reporting criteria as defined in paragraph 1.3.1. Class E events require a safety investigation and
   report.
   1.3.3. Exceptions to mandatory reporting requirements. The following occurrences do not need to be
   reported under this instruction. However, other instructions may require their reporting and the
   absence of a requirement for a safety report does not relieve the need to conduct an investigation.
       1.3.3.1. Damage or injury by direct action of an enemy or hostile force. This does not include sus-
       pected cases of Friendly Fire, which may involve a safety investigation and report IAW paragraph
       4.11.1.
       1.3.3.2. Intentional, controlled, in-flight jettison or release of canopies, cargo, doors, drag chutes,
       hatches, life rafts, auxiliary fuel tanks, aerial refueling hoses, missiles, drones, rockets, explosive
8                                                       AFI91-204_ACCSUP_I 16 NOVEMBER 2007


    munitions, and externally carried equipment nonessential to flight. Includes intentional activation
    of flares, manually or by automatic countermeasure systems, with normal system function and no
    damage to property on the ground. NOTE: Report intentional jettison of missiles, drones, rockets,
    and munitions when the reason for jettison is their malfunction. Report all release of missiles or
    explosives that impact off range.
    1.3.3.3. Except when required to be reported as a Class E event, a report is not required for
    replacement of component parts due to normal wear and tear when all associated damage is con-
    fined to that component part. This "normal wear and tear" reporting exemption only applies to
    items that are normally used until they fail or until pre-determined wear limits are reached. If dam-
    age is not confined to the component part, all associated damage costs must be added to determine
    if the occurrence is a reportable mishap. Aircraft subsystems (such as engines, engine modules,
    APUs, landing gear, and gearboxes) are assemblies and NOT component parts. Flight line replace-
    able engine components and electronic boxes, tires, pump motors, and drag braces are examples of
    component parts.
    1.3.3.3. (ACC) Jeg Fuel Starters (JFS) are considered a fly-to-failure component of the secondary
    power system on F-15C’s and F-15E’s. No report is required if a JFS fails and damage is self-con-
    tained. Report as required by dollar amount if damage is not contained to the JFS.
    1.3.3.4. Injuries associated with non-occupational diseases, when the disease, not the injury, is the
    proximate cause of the lost time, such as diabetes and its resultant complications like loss of
    vision. Complications of the injury (such as the infection of a cut aggravated by a work-related
    activity) that result in lost time are reportable.
    1.3.3.5. Attempted or consummated suicide, homicide, or intentionally self-inflicted injuries, e.g.,
    Russian roulette.
    1.3.3.6. Injuries resulting from altercations, attack, or assault, unless incurred in the performance
    of official duties when an attack or assault would not be a felony, such as a medical provider
    assaulted by an incompetent patient.
    1.3.3.7. Injuries sustained before entry into military service or employment by the US Govern-
    ment, unless specifically aggravated by current tenure of service.
    1.3.3.8. Hospitalization for treatment where the patient is retained beyond the day of admission
    solely for administrative reasons. Hospitalization for observation or administrative reasons not
    related to the immediate injury or occupational illness.
       1.3.3.8.1. Observation and/or Diagnostic Procedure. Hospitalization or restriction from
       assigned work activities for observation or diagnosis is not a "lost time case," "no lost time
       case," or "first aid case" provided no treatment or medication is given for the suspected injury
       or occupational illness and competent medical authority determines the individual could have
       returned to his or her normal job without impairment or disability. This classification also
       applies where an individual is temporarily restricted from regularly assigned duties to prevent
       exceeding time-weighted exposure limits.
    1.3.3.9. Injuries that result from the following:
       1.3.3.9.1. Pre-existing musculoskeletal disorders unless aggravated or accelerated by Federal
       employment.
AFI91-204_ACCSUP_I 16 NOVEMBER 2007                                                                       9


        1.3.3.9.2. Minimum stress and strain (simple, natural, and nonviolent body positions or
        actions, as in dressing, sleeping, coughing, or sneezing.) Those are injuries unrelated to mis-
        hap-producing agents or environments normally associated with active participation in daily
        work or recreation.
     1.3.3.10. Injuries or fatalities to persons in the act of escaping from or eluding military or civilian
     custody or arrest.
     1.3.3.11. Death due to natural causes that are unrelated to the work environment. NOTE: Report
     the following deaths by natural causes:
        1.3.3.11.1. An aircrew member during flight.
        1.3.3.11.2. A missile crewmember on alert.
        1.3.3.11.3. A training-related death.
     1.3.3.12. Intentional or expected damage to DOD equipment or property incurred during autho-
     rized testing or combat training, including missile and ordnance firing or destruction of DOD
     property to prevent capture by an enemy or hostile force.
        1.3.3.12.1. Intentional electro-explosive device activation when part of it is a normal missile
        test or launch sequence, the launch is aborted, and there is no other reportable damage.
        1.3.3.12.2. Expected damage or destruction of equipment, pallets, parachutes, etc., during air-
        drop operations.
        1.3.3.12.3. Damage to or destruction of Air Force equipment or property during authorized
        testing, including missile and ordnance firing, and UAVs used as targets or on critical profile
        missions, provided all of the following conditions exist:
            1.3.3.12.3.1. The extent of the damage or destruction was an expected or desired result of
            the test.
            1.3.3.12.3.2. The damage or destruction occurred at planned times and for anticipated rea-
            sons.
     1.3.3.13. Foreign object damage (FOD) to aircraft, air-breathing missiles, or drone/UAV engines
     discovered during scheduled engine disassembly (e.g., depot engine overhaul for maximum oper-
     ating time, not for known or suspected FOD). NOTE: FOD may be reportable under TO
     00-35D-54, USAF Deficiency Reporting and Investigating System.
     1.3.3.14. Property damage, death, or injury as a result of vandalism, riots, civil disorders, sabo-
     tage, terrorist activities, or criminal acts (where injury or property damage is intentional, e.g.,
     arson).
        1.3.3.14.1. Motor vehicle mishaps. Although motor vehicle mishaps often result from some
        form of misconduct, e.g., speeding, driving while intoxicated, and reckless driving, they will
        be reported.
     1.3.3.15. Adverse bodily reactions resulting directly from the use of drugs under the direction of
     competent medical authority.
     1.3.3.16. Death or injury resulting solely from illegal use of drugs or other substances.
     1.3.3.17. Normal residual damage as a result of a missile launch.
10                                                      AFI91-204_ACCSUP_I 16 NOVEMBER 2007


        1.3.3.18. Injury or occupational illness to contractor personnel or damage to contractor property
        or equipment unless caused by DOD operations.
        1.3.3.19. ANG state employee (Title 5) injury or illness on- or off-duty unless their injury or ill-
        ness mishap involved Air Force personnel, contractor operations, or property.
        1.3.3.20. Injuries or illness from animal, insect, or reptile bites to military personnel while
        off-duty.
        1.3.3.21. Natural phenomena ground mishaps where adequate preparation, forecasting, and com-
        munication actions were taken and there were no injuries to DOD personnel.

1.4. Acting on Critical Safety Information. If safety personnel or investigators discover information
that seriously impacts the operations of a weapons system, the continuation of an exercise, or other oper-
ations; immediately notify the convening authority by telephone and follow up with a confirming mes-
sage, regardless of whether or not such information is associated with a mishap currently under
investigation. Convening Authority Safety Offices will take action IAW paragraph 2.6.7.

1.5. Accounting for Losses. The Air Force records each mishap to the command (MAJCOM) that expe-
rienced the loss of an owned asset (personnel or property). For statistical purposes, the occurrence is
recorded as a mishap in that command (or in the Air Force at large, when applicable) regardless of any
determination as to the responsibility for the mishap. Generally, the mishap is recorded in the command
that has investigative responsibility for the mishap (Chapter 4). Mishap accounting in no way implies
blame or mishap responsibility. NOTE: For purposes of this instruction, the term "MAJCOM" includes
ANG, DRUs, and FOAs.

1.6. Mishap Categories. The Air Force categorizes mishaps based upon the materiel involved (e.g.,
space systems, weapons, aircraft, motor vehicles, person, etc.) and the state of the involved materiel (e.g.,
launch, orbit, existence of intent for flight, on- or off-duty, etc.) when the mishap occurs. Mishap catego-
ries and subcategories are defined below and diagramed in Figure 1.1. For the purposes of reporting and
data collection, select the one category and subcategory that best defines the mishap under investigation.
Normally mishaps involve only one category and subcategory, see paragraph 1.6.3.
1.6. (ACC) Mishap Categories. Categorization according to this instruction does not dictate who inves-
tigates particular mishaps and under what specific guidance they are reported. For instance, engine test
cell mishaps are sub-categorized as industrial aviation mishaps in the ground and industrial mishap cate-
gory; however, it may be more appropriate for flight safety personnel to investigate them but report them
through the ground safety automated system. Sub-scale remotely piloted vehicle mishaps are categorized
as aviation mishaps; however they should be investigated IAW AFI 99-151, Air Launched Missile Analy-
sis Group (ALMAG) guidelines.
     1.6.1. Specific Mishap Categories.
        1.6.1.1. Nuclear. An Air Force mishap involving radioactive materiel.
            1.6.1.1.1. Nuclear Weapon. A mishap that involves destruction of, or serious damage to,
            nuclear weapons, nuclear weapons systems, or nuclear weapons components, resulting in an
            actual or potential threat to national security or life and property. Reportable nuclear surety
            violations and damage to support equipment unique to a nuclear weapon system will be
            reported under this subcategory.
AFI91-204_ACCSUP_I 16 NOVEMBER 2007                                                                   11


        1.6.1.1.1. (ACC) Nuclear Weapon. Report Dull Swords IAW AFMAN 91-221, Weapons
        Safety Investigations and Reports, Attachment A4.3.
        1.6.1.1.2. Reactor and Radiological. Mishaps involving fissile materiel used in a self-support-
        ing chain reaction (i.e., nuclear fission) to produce heat and/or radiation for both practical
        application and research and development.
     1.6.1.2. Space. An Air Force mishap involving a space system and/or unique space support equip-
     ment.
        1.6.1.2.1. Pre-Launch. Space mishaps occurring during ground handling, processing, and
        transportation operations.
        1.6.1.2.2. Launch. Space mishaps occurring during launch vehicle operations, including
        upper stages. This includes payloads that do not obtain orbit and range safety system failures.
        1.6.1.2.3. Orbit. Space mishaps occurring during spacecraft operation after separation from
        all launch vehicle components, including upper stages and transfer motors.
     1.6.1.3. Aviation. An Air Force mishap involving a DOD aircraft or DOD UAV.
        1.6.1.3.1. Aircraft Flight. Any mishap in which there is intent for flight and reportable dam-
        age to a DOD aircraft. Explosives and chemical agents or guided missile mishaps that cause
        damage in excess of $20,000 to a DOD aircraft with intent for flight are categorized as aircraft
        flight mishaps to avoid dual reporting. This is the only aviation mishap subcategory that con-
        tributes to the flight mishap rate.
        1.6.1.3.1. (ACC) Aircraft Flight. Manned QF-4s are not ACC rate-producing but will be
        added into Air Force mishap rates.
        1.6.1.3.2. Aircraft Flight-Related. Any mishap in which there is intent for flight and no report-
        able damage to the DOD aircraft itself, but the mishap involves a fatality, reportable injury, or
        reportable property damage. A missile or UAV that is launched from a DOD aircraft, departs
        without damaging the aircraft, and is subsequently involved in a DOD mishap is reportable as
        a guided missile mishap or UAV mishap, respectively.
        1.6.1.3.3. Aircraft Ground Operations Mishap. A mishap involving DoD aircraft, with an air-
        crew member on board, that occurs between engine start/shutdown and prior to/following
        intent for flight that results in reportable property damage or any injury or fatality. Damage to
        a missile prior to the completion of weapons upload procedures, or after initiation of weapons
        download procedures is a Missile mishap. Note: The three key factors required to meet the
        AGO category are: Aircrew member on board, Engines running, and intention to become air-
        borne at some point.
        1.6.1.3.4. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). Any mishap involving a DOD UAV as defined
        in this instruction, but not involving a DOD aircraft. Damage to a DOD UAV, when it is being
        handled as cargo, is a ground and industrial, industrial aviation mishap.
     1.6.1.4. Guided Missile. An Air Force mishap involving guided missiles or unique missile sup-
     port equipment. Missiles that are damaged or destroyed after launch from an aircraft, but cause no
     aircraft damage, will be classified as a guided missile mishap.

     loading and/or off-loading or receiving services at dockside and mishaps occurring up to the high
     water mark during amphibious or inshore warfare training operations. It applies also to all injuries
     to DOD personnel occurring on board, whether or not job-related. Fatalities and/or injuries occur-
     ring on board that result from shipyard, repair facility, or private contractor operations are not
     afloat mishaps.
     1.6.1.8. Motor Vehicle. An Air Force mishap involving the operation of a motorized land vehicle
     operated by Air Force personnel. An Air Force mishap involving the operation of a DOD-owned
     or leased motorized land vehicle by non-Air Force personnel while operationally controlled by a
     DOD component. Fatalities or injuries to pedestrians or bicyclists involving moving motor vehi-
     cles are included in this category. This category does not include ground and industrial mishaps
     such as injuries occurring while loading or unloading, mounting or dismounting a non-moving
     vehicle; cargo damaged by weather; damage to a properly parked DOD vehicle, unless caused by
     an operating DOD vehicle. Additionally, damage to an Air Force vehicle caused by objects

        1.6.1.10.9. Industrial. A ground and industrial mishap that occurs in the work environment
        that does not meet the mishap subcategory definition of sport and recreational or miscella-
        neous as defined by this instruction. This also include categories for fire, combat training,
        physical and Athletic Conditioning, Contractor, and Natural Phenomena. (The work environ-
14                                                       AFI91-204_ACCSUP_I 16 NOVEMBER 2007


            ment, as defined in 29 Code of Federal Regulations 1960, is “The establishment and other
            locations where one or more Air Force employees are working or are present as a condition of
            their employment; this would include those areas or locations where persons are TDY for
            training purposes. The work environment includes not only physical locations, but also the
            equipment or materials used by the employee during the course of his or her work).
            1.6.1.10.10. Miscellaneous. On- or off-duty mishaps that do not fit into the industrial, sports
            and recreational subcategory. Also included in this subcategory are reportable mishaps occur-
            ring while using a commercial carrier such as a commercial bus, airplane, or taxicab.
     1.6.2. Multiple Occurrence Mishaps. Damaging occurrences that happen in logical succession are
     considered to occur in a single mishap and will result in a single safety investigation, unless there is
     clearly no possible initiating or sustaining relationship between occurrences. An emergency vehicle
     responding to a mishap that collides with another motor vehicle is a separate mishap. MAJCOM/SE
     should contact HQ USAF/SE for resolution of questions regarding whether occurrences constitute a
     single or separate mishaps.
     1.6.3. Mishaps Involving Multiple Categories. Occasionally mishaps have characteristics that fit two
     or more mishap categories. In these cases, for the purposes of reporting and data collection, use the
     mishap category hierarchy to select the one primary category/subcategory and up to two cross catego-
     ries/subcategories that define the mishap under investigation. Paragraph 1.6. and Figure 1.1. depict
     the mishap category hierarchy. The category/subcategory appearing first in the hierarchy that
     describes the mishap under investigation is the primary mishap category/subcategory. Similar logic is
     used for selecting cross categories/subcategories. For example, an inadvertent release of a conven-
     tional weapon from an aircraft in flight that does not damage the aircraft would be categorized as an
     aviation, aircraft flight-related mishap with, explosives and chemical agents, explosives involvement.
     An inadvertent initiation and launch of an ejection seat during ground maintenance would be catego-
     rized as aviation, aircraft ground operations mishap with, explosives and chemical agents, explosives,
     ground and industrial, industrial aviation involvement. Lastly, the drop of a conventional weapon
     being loaded onto an aircraft that does not explode but injures personnel would be categorized as an
     aviation, aircraft ground operations mishaps with, explosives and chemical agents, explosives, ground
     and industrial, industrial weapons involvement.

1.7. Non-USAF Mishaps. Paragraph 1.6. and Figure 1.1. are concerned with Air Force mishaps and
their categorization. However, periodically the Air Force investigates mishaps that DO NOT fit the defi-
nition of an Air Force mishap. The Air Force generally investigates non-USAF mishaps because of an
existing agreement with the involved party or because it has unique expertise, an interest in the mishap,
and has agreed to lead an investigation. For example, the Air Force, by way of an existing Memorandum
of Agreement (MOA) or Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), may have previously agreed to investi-
gate any mishap involving the equipment of a foreign nation occurring on US soil. Non-USAF mishap
categories are defined below and diagramed in Figure 1.2. For the purposes of reporting and data collec-
tion, select the one category that best defines the mishap under investigation. NOTE: Non-USAF mishaps
fall into one of three categories while USAF mishaps fall into one of ten DOD categories previously dis-
cussed in paragraph 1.6. and diagramed in Figure 1.1.
     1.7.1. Non-USAF Aviation. Aviation mishaps involving:
        1.7.1.1. A non-DOD aircraft or non-DOD UAV, regardless of the existence of intent for flight,
        that only results in damage to non-USAF equipment or injury to non-USAF personnel. An Air
        Force pilot who is uninjured during a successful ejection from a foreign-owned, single-seat fighter
        that is subsequently destroyed is categorized as a non-USAF aviation mishap since there was no
        damage to Air Force equipment or injury to Air Force personnel.
        1.7.1.2. A DOD aircraft or DOD UAV, regardless of the existence of intent for flight, resulting in
        damage or injury to the Air Force (paragraph 1.3.1.1.) and another DOD component is responsible
        for reporting. An Air Force person killed in an aircraft belonging to another DOD component, typ-
        ically would be investigated and reported by the DOD component owning the aircraft. However,
        if the Air Force wrote its own limited report, usually to document and report the loss of life, it
        would be categorized as a non-USAF aviation mishap.
     1.7.2. Contractor. Instances where contractor operations on government property during the execu-
     tion of a government contract result in significant damage to contractor-owned equipment or injury to
     contract employees but not reportable damage to DOD property or injury to DOD personnel.
     1.7.3. Other. Mishaps that do not fit into the non-USAF aviation or contractor categories.

1.8. Mishap and Event Classifications. Classify mishaps by total direct mishap cost and the severity of
injury/occupational illness. EXCEPTION: Classify Class D mishaps and Class E events according to the
AFI91-204_ACCSUP_I 16 NOVEMBER 2007                                                                       17


definitions below. Calculate direct cost of a mishap IAW paragraph 1.9. NOTE: Severity of injury/occu-
pational illness, NOT injury/occupational cost, is used to classify mishaps.
   1.8.1. Class A Mishap. A mishap resulting in one or more of the following:
       1.8.1.1. Direct mishap cost totaling $1,000,000 or more.
       1.8.1.2. A fatality or permanent total disability.
       1.8.1.3. Destruction of a DOD aircraft (Attachment 1). NOTE: A destroyed UAV is not a Class
       A mishap unless the criteria in paragraphs 1.8.1.1. or 1.8.1.2. are met.
   1.8.2. Class B Mishap. A mishap resulting in one or more of the following:
       1.8.2.1. Direct mishap cost totaling $200,000 or more but less than $1,000,000.
       1.8.2.2. A permanent partial disability.
       1.8.2.3. Inpatient hospitalization of three or more personnel. Do not count or include individuals
       hospitalized for observation, diagnostic, or administrative purposes that were treated and released.
   1.8.3. Class C Mishap. A mishap resulting in one or more of the following:
       1.8.3.1. Direct mishap cost totaling $20,000 or more but less than $200,000.
       1.8.3.2. Any injury or occupational illness or disease that causes loss of one or more days away
       from work beyond the day or shift it occurred. When determining if the mishap is a Lost Time
       Case, you must count the number of days the employee was unable to work as a result of the injury
       or illness, regardless of whether or not the person was scheduled to work on those days. Weekend
       days, holidays, vacation days, or other days off are included in the total number of days, if the
       employee would not have been able to work on those days. NOTE: Occurrences that result from
       voluntary participation in wellness and fitness programs, or recreational activities such as exercise
       class, racquetball, or baseball or injuries or illnesses resulting from an employee eating, drinking,
       or preparing food for personnel consumption will be reported as on or off-duty mishaps to comply
       with DODI 6055.7 Department of Defense mandates.
       1.8.3.3. An occupational injury or illness resulting in permanent change of job.
   1.8.4. Class D Mishap. Class D Mishap. Any nonfatal injury or occupational illness that does not
   meet the definition of Lost Time. These are cases where, because of injury or occupational illness, Air
   Force personnel only works partial days, restricted work or were transferred to another job, required
   medical treatment greater than first aid, lost of consciousness, or a significant injury or illness diag-
   nosed by a physician or other licensed health care professional, even if it does not result in death, days
   away from work, restricted work or job transfer, medical treatment greater then first aid, or loss of
   consciousness. NOTE: Occurrences that result from voluntary participation in wellness and fitness
   programs, or recreational activities such as exercise class, racquetball, or baseball or injuries or ill-
   nesses resulting from an employee eating, drinking, or preparing food for personnel consumption will
   be reported to comply with DODI 6055.7 Department of Defense mandates.

     1.8.5. Class E Events. These occurrences do not meet reportable mishap classification criteria, but are
     deemed important to investigate/report for mishap prevention. Class E reports provide an expeditious
     way to disseminate valuable mishap prevention information.
     1.8.5. (ACC) Class E Events. Refer to AFMAN 91-221, Table 6.1 and AFMAN 91-224, Ground
     Safety Investigations and Reports, for Class E events.
        1.8.5.1. Hazardous Air Traffic Report (HATR) Events. Any air traffic or movement area hazard-
        ous occurrence that endangers the safety of an aircraft or UAV.
        1.8.5.2. High Accident Potential (HAP) Events. Any hazardous occurrence that has a high poten-
        tial for becoming a mishap that does not fit the definition of a HATR.
        1.8.5.3. Wildlife Strike (BASH) Events. Any wildlife strike to an aircraft or UAV that does not
        meet Class A, B, or C mishap reporting criteria.
        1.8.5.4. Property Damage Events (Non Aviation). Mishaps that do not have an injury or illness
        and the direct cost is totaling $2,000 or more but less than $20,000.
        1.8.5.5. Other occurrences as directed in the discipline specific safety manuals (AFMAN
        91-22X)..

1.9. Mishap Costs. It is DOD policy to determine the total direct mishap cost in order to provide a fac-
tual basis for the allocation of resources in support of DOD mishap prevention programs. Direct mishap
costs ONLY include property damage costs (DOD and Non-DOD) and environmental cleanup costs.
1.9. (ACC) Mishap Costs. Units should borescope damaged aircraft engines and provide as much dam-
age information to the depot as feasible, to obtain an accurate and timely repair cost estimate, expedite
identification and mishap classification, and investigation/reporting requirements when practical.
     1.9.1. Determining DOD Property Damage Costs. This includes damage to materiel and the cost of
     labor to repair the materiel.
        1.9.1.1. Field Level Repair.
            1.9.1.1.1. Material Cost. If an item is repairable locally by unit personnel, calculate the cost of
            the materials used to repair the item. When determining the cost of Class I ODS use the value
            of $100.00 per pound for the inadvertent release of Class I ODSs.
            1.9.1.1.2. DOD Labor Costs (DOD military and civilian personnel). Determine the number of
            hours of labor to repair the damaged materiel. Obtain the hourly rate from:
            http://afsafety.af.mil/, Labor Rates for Safety Reporting. The hourly rate is for DOD military
            and civilian personnel. Multiply the number of hours of labor expended by DOD personnel by
            the hourly rate.
            1.9.1.1.3. Contractor Repairs.
                1.9.1.1.3.1. No Warranty. Use the actual cost charged to the government for repairs per-
                formed by contractors.
                1.9.1.1.3.2. Warranty In Place. Costs to repair damage must be reported even if the Air
                Force is reimbursed or if the repair is accomplished under warranty. Contact the Single
                Manager (SM) to determine the damage costs as if no warranty or reimbursement existed.
        1.9.1.2. Depot Level Repair.
AFI91-204_ACCSUP_I 16 NOVEMBER 2007                                                                     19


         1.9.1.2.1. Materiel. Obtain the exchange cost for each damaged stocklisted item from the Air
         Force Master Item Identification Data Base (D043A) or the SM. If the sum total of the
         exchange costs is equal to or greater than $1,000,000, obtain an estimated cost of repair based
         upon actual damage from the depot/repair facility. Report this estimated cost. If the sum total
         of the exchange costs is less than $1,000,000, report this cost. If the depot/repair facility can-
         not provide an estimated cost of repair based upon actual damage, use exchange cost from
         D043A or the SM. The Base Supply Representative has access to D043A.
         1.9.1.2.2. Depot Labor Costs. Determine the number of hours of labor to repair the damaged
         materiel. Obtain the hourly rate from: http://afsafety.af.mil/, Labor Rates for Safety Report-
         ing. The hourly rate is for depot level personnel. Multiply the number of hours of labor
         expended by depot personnel by the hourly rate.
         1.9.1.2.3. Contractor Repairs.
             1.9.1.2.3.1. No Warranty. Use the actual cost charged to the government for repairs per-
             formed by contractors.
             1.9.1.2.3.2. Warranty In Place. Costs to repair damage must be reported even if the Air
             Force is reimbursed or if the repair is accomplished under warranty. Contact the SM to
             determine the damage costs as if no warranty or reimbursement existed.
     1.9.1.3. Destroyed Assets.
         1.9.1.3.1. Determining destroyed aircraft/UAV cost. If the aircraft/UAV is destroyed, obtain
         flyaway cost from AFI 65-503, US Air Force Cost and Planning Factors, Table A10-1, Unit
         Flyaway Costs. Table A10-1 is available at: http://www.e-publishing.af.mil/, AFI 65-503,
         Table A10-1 (utilize hyperlink). Get the unit flyaway cost and contact the SM to get the cost of
         all modifications done to the aircraft/UAV up to the mishap date. For aircraft and UAVs not
         listed, contact the appropriate SM for cost information. NOTE: An aircraft/UAV that is dam-
         aged but will not be repaired is not automatically a destroyed aircraft/UAV. In this case, calcu-
         late repair cost IAW 1.9.1.1. and 1.9.1.2.
         1.9.1.3.2. Other destroyed or lost assets with no item to exchange. Use the standard (unit) cost
         from D043A or the Single Manager (SM). The Base Supply Representative has access to
         D043A.
  1.9.2. Determining Costs to Non-DOD Property Damage. If Air Force operations result in damage of
  non-DOD property, calculate and report the damage cost. Determine non-DOD property damage costs
  using the following priority:
     1.9.2.1. Legal office claims officer's damage statement.
     1.9.2.2. Official estimates, such as from security police reports, civil police reports, and/or logis-
     tics readiness offices.
  1.9.3. Determining Environmental Clean-Up Costs. Obtain these costs from the local civil engineer-
  ing environmental section. The end cost of this type of clean up may not be available inside the nom-
  inal 30 day investigation timeframe. Use the best estimate available at the time of the final message.
  Environmental clean up costs include costs for:
     1.9.3.1. Clean up.

        1.9.3.2. Environmental decontamination.
        1.9.3.3. Restoration of private and government property.

1.10. Mishap Injury and Occupational Illnesses. Report the type of person (1.10.1.) and the severity
of injury/occupational illness (1.10.2.).
     1.10.1. Type of person: rated officer, nonrated officer, enlisted, cadet, DOD civilian, DOD contrac-
     tor, Foreign Nationals, or non-DOD civilian. NOTE: Foreign Nationals include military (rated or
     non-rated) officer, military enlisted, or civilian.
     1.10.2. Severity of injury or occupational illnesses: fatality, permanent total disability, permanent
     partial disability, lost time case, or no lost time case. (See Attachment 1 for definitions.) For lost time
     cases, also report the number of days hospitalized and the number of days of lost time beyond the days
     hospitalized. In cases when the actual number of days hospitalized or lost time is not known at the
     time the safety report is submitted, the best official estimates made by a competent medical authority
     will be used.

1.11. Recording Injuries and Occupational Illnesses. Use the OSHA Form 300, Log of Work-Related
Injuries and Illnesses, for recording injuries and occupational illnesses to civilian and military personnel
meeting Class A, B, C, or D criteria. See AFMAN 91-224, Chapter 6, for specific guidance. Note. Use
separate logs (OSHA 301) to record military and civilian personnel. Contractor personnel who are super-
vised on a daily basis by Air Force personnel may be required to record their own injuries/illness.

1.12. Obtaining and Using Health Information.
     1.12.1. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA). This act is implemented by
     DOD 6025.18-R, DOD Health Information Privacy Regulation. Mishap investigation and reporting
     requires acquisition of information from the medical community.
     1.12.2. Safety officials at all levels are responsible to establish a liaison with the local medical agen-
     cies to ensure an information flow has been established (paragraph 2.3.). Chapter 7, of DOD
     6025.18-R, directive provides for release of information for safety related mishap investigation and
     reporting as required by laws and directives encompassing public health and safety.
     1.12.3. Safeguarding Protected Information. Disclosure rules are identified in Chapter 8, DOD
     6025.18-R.

     investigator within 15 days for Class A mishaps and within 30 days for all other mishap classes. The
     15 and 30 day timelines begin when the depot receives the requested information/materiel.
AFI91-204_ACCSUP_I 16 NOVEMBER 2007                                                                     23


   2.5.2. Provide technical assistance in response to Deficiency Reports (DR) to support Air Force
   safety investigations. Ensure technical assistance is provided to the safety investigator within 15 days
   for a Category I DR and 30 days for a Category II DR. The 15 and 30 day timelines begin when the
   depot receives the information/materiel. Category I DRs are normally submitted for Class A mishaps
   and Category II DRs are normally submitted for Class B and C mishaps. See TO 00-35D-54 for more
   information.
   2.5.3. Ensure the appropriate SM for the weapon system or items involved, receive and review
   MOFEs applicable to their systems and initiate publications or hardware changes as required. Maxi-
   mize mishap prevention by transferring useful information from one weapon system to another.

2.6. The Convening Authority. The Convening Authority will:
   2.6.1. Determine the scope and size of the safety investigation.
   2.6.2. Ensure ongoing safety investigations issue required safety reports IAW Table 6.2.
   2.6.3. Ensure all safety reports prepared and transmitted via the Defense Messaging System (DMS)
   when AFSAS is not available (paragraph 6.1.) will be entered into AFSAS as soon as possible. This
   includes changes made to safety reports.
   2.6.4. Ensure safety investigations cover all relevant mishap factors and meet the requirements of the
   Air Force mishap prevention program.
   2.6.5. Forward formal safety reports as required. If more information is found after a formal report
   has been submitted, the convening authority will send this information to the same addressees who
   received the formal report.
   2.6.6. Authorize the release of non-privileged information to news media, relatives, and other agen-
   cies through the legal board president, Survivor Assistance Program point of contact, Family Liaison
   Officer, or Public Affairs representative as appropriate.
   2.6.7. Upon receiving notification of a critical safety concern (paragraph 1.4.), take the following
   actions:
      2.6.7.1. Notify other action agencies, the appropriate SM for the weapon system or items
      involved, the weapons system lead command, (AFPD 10-9, Lead Operating Command Weapon
      Systems Management) and HQ AFSC. These action agencies must evaluate the nature and serious-
      ness of the information, determine the proper response, and issue required instructions.
      2.6.7.2. Ensure the SM has access to specific technical information and other critical information
      as it becomes available so the SM can meet Operational Safety, Suitability, and Effectiveness
      (OSS&E) responsibilities required by AFI 63-1201, Assurance of Operational Safety, Suitability,
      & Effectiveness.
      2.6.7.3. Ensure originating units send critical safety hazard information to appropriate agencies
      IAW AFI 11-215, Flight Manuals Program (FMP), and TO 00-5-1, AF Technical Order System.
      2.6.7.4. Forward to AFSC/SEF as quickly as practical all critical safety information related to
      military variants of civil aircraft and commercial-off-the-shelf aircraft. HQ AFSC/SEF will ensure
      all such information contributing to the promotion of aviation safety is forwarded to the Adminis-
      trator of the Federal Aviation Administration and/or the Chairperson of the National Transporta-
      tion Safety Board for appropriate action.

2.7. The Commander of the Active Duty Air Force installation nearest a mishap. The Commander
of the Active Duty Air Force installation nearest a mishap will:
     2.7.1. Respond to a mishap involving DOD assets IAW AFI 10-2501, Full Spectrum Threat
     Response (FSTR) Planning and Operations, and AFMAN 32-4004, Emergency Response Operations.
     Air Reserve Component installations, if nearest the mishap, will respond with available resources to
     the maximum extent possible, in coordination with the responding active duty installation. NOTE: All
     mishap response and SIB support MOA/MOUs between active duty and ARC units will be estab-
     lished by the active duty installation and maintained by the MAJCOM/SE, HQ AFRC/SE, and ANG/
     XO.
     2.7.2. Provide logistical and investigative support as required.
     2.7.3. Appoint an On-Scene Commander (OSC) IAW AFI 10-2501.
     2.7.4. Appoint an Interim Safety Board (ISB).
     2.7.5. Ensure toxicology testing is immediately considered following a mishap, if required or deemed
     necessary. Accomplish promptly and IAW applicable directives (AFI 44-120, Drug Abuse Testing
     Program, for military personnel and The Air Force Civilian Drug Testing Plan for civilian personnel).
     The Air Force Civilian Drug Testing Plan is available from the civilian personnel office.
        2.7.5.1. Military Members. For all classes and categories of mishaps, commanders have the dis-
        cretion to test involved military members whose actions or inactions, in their judgment, may have
        been factors in the mishap sequence. However, for all Class A and B aviation mishaps, command-
        ers must test all military crewmembers on the flight orders (includes UAV controllers). Because
        the evidence is perishable, commanders should test all military crewmembers on the flight orders
        (includes UAV controllers) for aviation mishaps that have the potential of meeting the Class B
        threshold.
        2.7.5.2. DOD Civilians. DOD civilians will be subject to testing when their action or inaction
        may have contributed to the mishap subject to the limitations and guidance in The Air Force Civil-
        ian Drug Testing Plan.
        2.7.5.3. Government Contract Employees. Government Contract Employees (includes UAV con-
        trollers) will be tested IAW the terms and conditions of the applicable contract or if they consent,
        when their actions or inaction in the commander's judgment may have been a factor in the mishap
        sequence.
        2.7.5.4. Blood testing is superior and the preferred method for all categories of safety investiga-
        tions over urine testing since it provides an opportunity to determine the concentration of the sub-
        stance and thus the expected performance decrement. Also, not all substances are excreted in the
        urine. Blood will be used for toxicological testing of military members for aviation safety investi-
        gations and is the preferred method for all safety investigations. Coordinate with the Civilian Per-
        sonnel Office or Contracting Officer before requiring blood samples from DOD civilian or
        contractor employees. All blood samples will be sent to the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology
        (AFIP). Rely on chain of custody procedures in AFI 44-120 or The Air Force Civilian Drug Test-
        ing Plan in order to ensure sample testing accuracy. Toxicological analyses should be directed
        toward controlled substances, as well as any medications, as indicated by the medical history and
        environmental substances (such as carbon monoxide) as indicated by the nature of the mishap or
        event.

     service.
     2.7.6.5. Notify AFIP, whenever there is a fatality of an Air Force member.
     2.7.6.6. Notify the Air Force Communications Agency’s Hammer ACE (Adaptive Communica-
     tions Element) if communications support is deemed necessary. Hammer ACE is funded to pro-
     vide services to safety investigations at no cost to MAJCOMs or Air Force wings.
     2.7.6.7. Notify the Military Traffic Management Command, when a mishap involves explosives
     or other dangerous articles being transported or handled by a commercial motor or rail carrier
     under Department of Transportation (DOT) regulations.
     2.7.6.8. Notify local Command Post (Command Post may have reporting requirements IAW AFI
     10-206, Operating Reporting).
  2.7.7. Make the Appropriate Civilian Notifications:
     2.7.7.1. Notify the nearest National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) regional or field office
     or the nearest Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Air Traffic facility if a civil aircraft is
     involved in a mishap on their installation.
     2.7.7.2. Notify the FAA at FAA/AST Combined Operations Center if licensed commercial space
     systems are involved in the mishap. During launch of a commercial space vehicle from an Air
     Force facility, the on-site FAA/AST representative will fulfill this notification requirement and
     up-channel as required.
     2.7.7.3. Notify the nearest Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) area or
     regional office when an on-duty mishap results in an Air Force civilian employee fatality or
     involves the inpatient hospitalization of three or more people (one of which must be a DOD civil-
     ian employee) within 8 hours of the on-duty mishap. If unable to contact the nearest OSHA area or
     regional office within required 8-hour time frame, contact the OSHA 24-hour toll-free hot line
     (Attachment 2). Although outside OSHA’s investigative jurisdiction, overseas locations are
     required to notify HQ AFSC/SEG of these types of incidents.
     2.7.7.4. Notify federal and state Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) officials of environ-
     mental hazards associated with the mishap.
     2.7.7.5. Notify appropriate medical or law enforcement authorities as soon as possible in case of
     non-Air Force injury or property damage.

2.8. The On-Scene Commander. The On-Scene Commander will:
     2.8.1. Be responsible for safety, security, medical, fire protection, legal support, and care of person-
     nel IAW AFI 10-2501. NOTE: When the mishap occurs outside a military installation, civil authori-
     ties may assume control of the mishap site. Coordinate with the servicing legal office before
     establishing a National Defense Area (NDA).
     2.8.2. Work with the Disaster Control Group (DCG) and provide a briefing to the ISB, SIB, and AIB
     or CDI on all known hazards and personal protective equipment (PPE) requirements before allowing
     them access to the site. OSCs must ensure personnel are properly trained and equipped to enter any
     site where hazardous materiels (including blood-borne pathogens) pose a threat to their safety.
     2.8.3. Grant access to the mishap site to properly designated personnel when the site is safe.
     2.8.4. Transfer custody of wreckage and other physical evidence to the ISB/SIB president, but retain
     control of site during investigation up through and including site restoration.
     2.8.5. Coordinate requests for host installation DCG assets needed for follow-on investigative sup-
     port.

                                                Chapter 3

                               PRIVILEGED SAFETY INFORMATION

3.1. General Information. All safety reports contain privileged safety information, but not all informa-
tion in a safety report is privileged. EXCEPTION: The preliminary message, HATRs, Wildlife Strike
Reports, and non-DOD aviation safety reports do not contain privileged safety information. Also ground
and industrial, and explosive and chemical agents safety reports regarding mishaps that occurred before 3
Oct 00 do not contain privileged safety information (paragraph 3.4.). This chapter identifies privileged
safety information and directs how to handle it. This chapter also describes the promise of confidentiality
and states how to use it during an investigation. Finally, this chapter states how privileged safety reports
and privileged safety information can be used after a safety report is completed.

3.2. Identifying and Handling Privileged Safety Information. Privileged safety information refers to
information that is exempt by statute or case law from disclosure outside the Air Force safety community.
The military safety privilege is judicially recognized and protects the investigative process. The Air Force
treats this information confidentially to ensure commanders quickly obtain accurate mishap information
thereby promoting safety, combat readiness, and mission accomplishment. NOTE: Safety investigations
of non-DOD aviation mishaps are conducted using this instruction as guidance and do not contain privi-
leged safety information.
     3.2.1. Privileged information includes:
        3.2.1.1. Findings, conclusions, causes, recommendations, analysis, and the deliberative process
        of all safety investigators. Diagrams and exhibits if they contain information which depicts the
        analysis of safety investigators. This includes draft versions of the above materiel.
        3.2.1.2. Information given to safety investigators pursuant to a promise of confidentiality (para-
        graph 3.2.5.).
        3.2.1.3. Computer generated videotape animations, simulations, or simulator reenactments in
        which safety investigator analysis is incorporated. Animations made exclusively from recorder
        data (including Military Flight Operations Quality Assurance (MFOQA) data) are not privileged.
        3.2.1.4. Photographs, films, and videotapes, which are staged, reconstructed, or simulated reen-
        actments of possible or probable scenarios developed by or for the analysis of the safety investiga-
        tor.
        3.2.1.5. Any Life Science Materiel, including photographs with markings or other indicators that
        contain analysis by a safety investigator. For example, 72-hour histories, 14-day histories, and
        interview narratives obtained during the post-mishap physical examination.
     3.2.2. Prohibited Uses of Privileged Safety Reports and Information. These prohibitions apply to Part
     2 of formal safety reports, status and final safety messages, and any other reports or documents con-
     taining privileged safety information.
        3.2.2.1. Air Force employees, military members, and government contractors, will not wrong-
        fully use, permit the use of, gain access to, or allow access to the privileged information in any
        safety report, or portions thereof, for other than officially authorized mishap prevention purposes.
AFI91-204_ACCSUP_I 16 NOVEMBER 2007                                                                     29


     3.2.2.2. Violations of the prohibitions in paragraphs 3.1. through paragraph 3.4. of this instruction
     are punishable under Article 92(1), UCMJ and may be grounds for disciplinary actions according
     to civilian personnel regulations, or may lead to contract actions.
     3.2.2.3. The Air Force does not use privileged safety information as evidence for punitive, disci-
     plinary, or adverse administrative actions, for determining the misconduct or line-of-duty status of
     any person, in flying evaluation board hearings or reviews, to determine liability or liability in
     claims for or against the United States, or in any other manner in any action by or against the
     United States.
  3.2.3. Controlling and Handling Privileged Safety Reports and Information. Personnel having access
  (authorized access or unauthorized access) to privileged safety reports and information have a duty to
  control the reports to prevent their use for anything other than mishap prevention. When these reports
  and information are no longer needed for mishap prevention purposes, dispose of IAW the Air Force
  Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at https://webrims.amc.af.mil.
  3.2.4. Privileged Safety Information and Safety Reports. Safety reports are for official use only
  (FOUO) if they are not classified. However, not each document in the report is FOUO. The factual
  documents in Part 1 of formal safety reports are not considered FOUO by this AFI, and should not be
  marked as such. However, documents from other sources included in Part 1 may already be marked
  FOUO. Only the OPR for the document may remove FOUO markings.
  3.2.5. Promise of Confidentiality.
     3.2.5.1. Purpose. The Air Force gives a promise of confidentiality to encourage frank and open
     communications with individuals who provide witness statements (to a safety investigator) and
     with government contractors, who built, designed, or maintained the equipment and participate in
     the safety investigation. However, if an individual provides a false statement to a safety investiga-
     tor under a promise of confidentiality, that statement (and any other information that witness gave
     to the safety investigator) loses its privileged status and can be used to support disciplinary and/or
     adverse administrative actions.
     3.2.5.2. Promises of Confidentiality Authorized. Promises of confidentiality are only authorized
     in investigations of Air Force nuclear, space, aviation, guided missile, and directed energy mis-
     haps. However, there may be occasions, such as mishaps involving complex systems, mili-
     tary-unique items (such as armored vehicles), or military-unique operations or exercises, where a
     witness or involved contractor will not provide a statement or information without a promise of
     confidentiality. When this appears to be the case, contact HQ USAF/SE for approval to grant con-
     fidentiality to that (those) witness(es).
     3.2.5.3. Promises of Confidentiality Not Authorized. Promises of confidentiality are not autho-
     rized for explosives and chemical agents, afloat, motor vehicle, off-duty military, and ground and
     industrial mishaps (see the exception for complex systems, military-unique items, or mili-
     tary-unique operations or exercises in paragraph 3.2.5.2.). Promises of confidentiality are also not
     authorized for HATRs.
     3.2.5.4. Persons Authorized to Make Promises of Confidentiality. Only members of a designated
     ISB/SIB (or a SIO) may offer promises of confidentiality and only during safety investigations
     where promises of confidentiality are authorized. When conducting safety investigations in which
     promises of confidentiality are authorized, the safety investigators have the discretion to decide
     who will be offered a promise of confidentiality. The investigators’ decision should be based upon
30                                                       AFI91-204_ACCSUP_I 16 NOVEMBER 2007


        a witness or contractor’s reluctance to cooperate, involvement in the mishap sequence, or apparent
        self-interest in not disclosing information. Promises of confidentiality will only be given as
        needed to ensure forthright cooperation of the witness and may not be given on a blanket basis to
        all witnesses.
        3.2.5.5. Persons to Whom Promises of Confidentiality May be Offered. Promises of confidential-
        ity may be offered to any witness and contractors who built, designed or maintained the equipment
        in order to encourage their full cooperation and candid statements.
        3.2.5.6. Non-privileged Witness Statements. If witnesses provide a statement without a promise
        of confidentiality, ensure they are informed that their statement will be provided to the legal inves-
        tigation (if applicable) and/or may be released to the public pursuant to a Freedom of Information
        Act (FOIA) request.
     3.2.6. Marking and Documenting Safety Information.
        3.2.6.1. The cover and individual pages of documents containing privileged information will be
        clearly marked with the warning statement (FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY) in Figure A3.1. All
        media containing privileged information (audiotapes, videotapes, animations, simulations, com-
        puter generated profiles, etc.) will be clearly marked with the warning statement in Figure A3.1.
        See paragraph 3.2.7. for further information on email. Part 1 (Factual Information and Releasable
        Material) of a formal report will not be marked with the warning statement in Figure A3.1.
        3.2.6.2. Promises of Confidentiality. If a promise of confidentiality is offered and accepted, it
        must be documented. Use the sample witness statement format in Figure A3.2. for written state-
        ments. Read, record, and transcribe the statement in Figure A3.3. for recorded interviews of wit-
        nesses. Use Figure A3.6. to document that contractor personnel (those personnel not serving as
        technical experts to a SIB) acknowledge and understand the limitations on the use of privileged
        safety information and media. Use Figure A3.7. to document promises of confidentiality to con-
        tractor representatives serving as technical experts for a SIB. Use Figure A3.8. as a cover sheet for
        confidential technical reports and analysis provided by contractors.
        3.2.6.3. Non-privileged Witness Statements. If witnesses or contractors provide a statement with-
        out a promise of confidentiality, it must be documented by using the sample witness statement for-
        mat in Figure A3.4. for written statements. Read, record, and transcribe the statement in Figure
        A3.5. for recorded interviews.
        3.2.6.4. For all written witness statements (privileged and non-privileged) reproduced for other
        government agencies/bodies (e.g., the legal board), ensure the appropriate signed, dated memo-
        randum (Figure A3.2. or Figure A3.4.) from Attachment 3 is included as the first page of the
        reproduced statement.
     3.2.7. Transmitting Safety Information.
        3.2.7.1. To protect the privileged status and to ensure the correct handling of safety reports, orig-
        inating organizations will use the Air Force Safety Automated System (AFSAS) reporting system
        to transmit messages. AFSAS is a user ID and password system ensuring the protection of privi-
        leged information. If AFSAS is not available (paragraph 6.1.) use DMS and the addressing
        requirements of this instruction. All DMS safety messages containing privileged safety informa-
        tion or Privacy Act information must be digitally signed and encrypted.
AFI91-204_ACCSUP_I 16 NOVEMBER 2007                                                                     31


       3.2.7.2. If AFSAS and DMS are not available, or not practical, use one of the following ways to
       send privileged safety reports and information:
           3.2.7.2.1. Password protect the privileged safety report or information and then email the doc-
           ument. Send the applicable password in a separate message or by another mode of transmis-
           sion.
           3.2.7.2.2. Fax the document ensuring that the recipient will receive the faxed document
           immediately upon receipt.
           3.2.7.2.3. Intrabase. This includes wide area networks or local area networks served by a sin-
           gle network control center. The transmitting and receiving units will use appropriate lim-
           ited-use, Privacy Act, and FOUO markings as required and may be transmitted unencoded and
           unencrypted.

3.3. Authorized Use and Release of Privileged Safety Reports and Information. I n o r d e r t o h e l p
ensure courts honor the assertion of privilege, the rules described in this paragraph must be followed. The
Air Force ensures privileged safety reports and information are used only by persons and agencies whose
duties include relevant mishap prevention responsibilities (paragraphs 3.3.2. and 3.3.3.). All personnel
and agencies authorized access to privileged safety reports and information will follow the policy in para-
graphs 3.2.2. and 3.2.3. Only HQ USAF/SE approves release of privileged safety information outside the
Air Force, even to members of Congress or officials of the Department of Justice. Unique circumstances
described in paragraphs below allow certain authorized individuals to release privileged information out-
side the Air Force. Privileged safety information remains Air Force property. Questions regarding access
to privileged safety information should be referred to HQ AFSC/JA. Access is limited to information that
is necessary for and consistent with mishap prevention. Whenever privileged safety information is
requested, first determine whether or not mishap prevention goals can be met by sanitizing the informa-
tion (paragraph 3.3.1.). If the answer is no, then provide only the necessary information to the authorized
persons or agencies with the restrictive markings affixed.
   3.3.1. Sanitizing Privileged Safety Reports. Sanitizing reports or extracts from reports means obscur-
   ing the relationship between the identity of a mishap and the findings, conclusions, causes, recom-
   mendations, deliberative processes resulting from the investigation, and statements made under a
   promise of confidentiality. Wing safety officers or their designated representatives (that are properly
   trained) may sanitize privileged safety reports and other media for unit use and for use by authorized
   contractor personnel. Some mishaps, because of widespread publicity or unique circumstances, can-
   not be fully sanitized. When a report is sanitized, the findings, causes, recommendation, conclusions,
   or opinions of the investigation are no longer privileged. (Note: Sanitized reports are not necessarily
   releasable to the public since they may still contain information protected by the Privacy Act, Arms
   Export Control Act, or Export Administration Act. Ensure sanitized reports are appropriately
   labeled.) Sanitizing a report involves separating the following identifying information from related
   safety investigator findings, causes, recommendations, conclusions, or opinions:
       3.3.1.1. Date and place of the mishap.
       3.3.1.2. Aircraft, UAV, missile, vehicle, or weapon serial number.
       3.3.1.3. Names and social security numbers (SSN), if included, of persons involved.
       3.3.1.4. Any other detail identifying the mishap.

        3.3.1.5. Remove identifying information and markings identifying the documents as privileged or
        FOUO before reproducing sanitized reports or extracts of reports.
        3.3.1.6. Do not release statements or contractor reports obtained with a promise of confidentiality.
     3.3.2. Limiting Use or Release within the Air Force. Safety officers and their staffs, duly appointed
     safety investigators, AFSC personnel and AF/SE and his staff, are authorized access to and use of
     privileged safety information based on their safety duties. Other Air Force officials, when their duties
     include mishap prevention and when it is necessary to develop, take, or review preventive actions,
     may obtain access to privileged safety information. See paragraphs 3.2.2., 3.2.3., and 3.3. MAJCOM,
     NAF/Center or unit Chiefs of Safety are authorized, when sanitized information is inadequate, to pro-
     vide privileged safety information as lessons learned to Air Force members on a need-to-know basis
     and solely for mishap prevention. They will ensure members are instructed on properly protecting
     information and their responsibilities to prevent further, unauthorized release. Lessons learned will
     not include confidential statements or contractor reports.
        3.3.2.1. AF/SE; AFSC/CD and division chiefs; MAJCOM, NAF/Center or unit Chiefs of Safety;
        SIB presidents or SIOs; are authorized to disclose privileged safety information to AF officials as
        described in 3.3.2.
        3.3.2.2. AIB investigators, with a safety need to know, (e.g., pilots, commanders, operations per-
        sonnel) may have access to privileged safety information from the corresponding safety investiga-
        tion, only after final approval of the AIB report. AIB investigators must first coordinate with the
        convening authority JA and SE if the AIB report has not been released to the public. The conven-
        ing authority will determine if access is appropriate before next-of-kin are briefed following a fatal
        mishap.
        3.3.2.3. Part 1 of the two-part formal safety report and certain factual information is given to the
        legal board president (paragraph 5.14. and the discipline specific safety manual AFMAN 91-22X).
        3.3.2.4. Deleted.
        3.3.2.5. Other Air Force officials such as the SJA (other than HQ AFSC/JA), criminal investiga-
        tive agencies such as the Air Force Office of Special Investigations (OSI), Security Police, Histo-
        rian (HO), and PA do not normally receive privileged safety information because of possible
        conflicts of interest and because use of such information by such officials would not be for mishap
        prevention purposes.
        3.3.2.6. ANG Personnel. Apply the test for releasing privileged safety information that is
        described in paragraph 3.3. Do not withhold privileged safety reports from ANG personnel who
        have a need to know when sanitized information is not adequate to develop, take, or review cor-
        rective action. Person having a need to know include, but are not limited to, those involved in mis-
        hap; whose duties included the preparation dispatch, or internal distribution of safety reports; and
        those who act in response to mishap prevention recommendations. Releasing information under
        this paragraph does not constitute release outside the Air Force.
     3.3.3. Limiting Release Outside the Air Force. In certain cases, the Air Force has agreed to exchange
     privileged safety information with other DOD agencies solely for mishap prevention purposes. Also,
     the Air Force shares certain mishap prevention information with other entities in the interests of the
     general safety community. See paragraphs 3.2.2., 3.2.3., and 3.3.
AFI91-204_ACCSUP_I 16 NOVEMBER 2007                                                                     33


     3.3.3.1. Responding to Subpoenas and Legal Process. Upon receipt of a legal process requiring
     participation in a court proceeding, including depositions and requests for production of docu-
     ments, contact HQ AFSC/JA and the nearest Air Force base legal office. Fax a copy of the legal
     process to AFLSA/JACT. Encourage requesters to ask the MAJCOM/JA for the AFI 51-503 acci-
     dent report if one has been prepared.
     3.3.3.2. Responding to FOIA Requests. FOIA requests under Title 5, United States Code, section
     552 (5 U.S.C. 552). Send requests to HQ AFSC/JA.
     3.3.3.3. Historical Safety Reports. HQ USAF/SE/SED may release the findings of a Safety
     Board, contained in historical safety reports prepared IAW DODI 6055.7 (or its predecessors),
     provided no national defense or safety interest exists. For the purpose of this provision, historical
     reports shall be defined as those concerning mishaps more than 25 years old. (Note: Safety
     Reports on pre-1956 mishaps are not protected by the safety privilege and are stored at the Air
     Force Historical Research Agency, Maxwell AFB.)
     3.3.3.4. Safety Reports Where a Promise of Confidentiality is Not Authorized IAW DODI
     6055.7, paragraph E4.5.3.3.1. HQ USAF/SE/SED is designated by the Secretary of the Air Force
     to assert the privilege to oppose any court-ordered release of privileged safety information for all
     investigations where promises of confidentiality are not authorized. Further, upon determination
     by HQ USAF/SE/SED that no safety or national defense interest is jeopardized, HQ USAF/SE/
     SED may authorize the release of safety investigation findings. See paragraph 3.2.5.3. for investi-
     gations where safety investigators are not authorized to grant promises of confidentiality.
     3.3.3.5. Limiting Release to Contractors. Contractors may need access to privileged safety infor-
     mation when they are performing an Air Force function involving mishap prevention. Contractors
     may also need access to privileged safety information if they designed, built, maintained or oper-
     ated Air Force weapon systems, their components, or other Air Force equipment, in order to cor-
     rect defects or other problems and help prevent future mishaps. When contractors need access to
     privileged safety information, the appropriate memorandum in Figure A3.6. or Figure A3.7. must
     be used and kept on file with the individual authorizing access to the information. Access will be
     limited to what is needed to prevent future mishaps. Contractors will not release the information
     outside contractor safety channels; for example, privileged safety information will not be released
     to the general counsel’s office or public relations personnel. The number of contractor employees
     who have access to the information shall be strictly limited to only those individuals who have a
     need to know the information in order to enhance the safety of the Air Force weapon systems.
     After a project is complete, contractors will not maintain the information in their files. Contractors
     must understand and agree to their responsibilities to treat such information as confidential. See
     paragraphs 3.2.2., 3.2.3., and 3.3.
        3.3.3.5.1. Contractors who built, designed, or maintained equipment involved in mishaps
        send representatives to support Air Force SIBs at the request of the Air Force. SIB presidents
        and safety investigators will ensure those representatives understand that the Air Force may, at
        the contractor’s request, extend a claim of privilege over documents provided by the contrac-
        tor representatives to the SIB when the Air Force maintains sole possession or control. A claim
        of privilege may not be sustained over notes, documents, and other matter produced during the
        SIB investigation by the contractor but retained by the contractor representatives. SIB presi-
        dents grant these contractors access to privileged safety information only if it is essential to
        assist the SIB.

        3.3.3.5.2. Contractors providing weapon system maintenance support are performing an Air
        Force function. Advise them that disclosure of privileged safety information is necessary for
        fulfillment of contractual obligations. The wing chief of safety, MAJCOM/SE, or HQ AFSC
        may provide the contractors safety information for this function.
        3.3.3.5.3. Air Force operations conducted at contractors’ facilities require privileged safety
        information handling.
        3.3.3.5.4. Contractors providing weapon system crew training are performing an Air Force
        function, and need information from safety reports, videos, and other similar media to build
        training scenarios. The wing chief of safety, MAJCOM/SE, or HQ AFSC may provide the
        contractors safety reports for this function.
        3.3.3.5.5. Contractors who instruct safety programs in mishap investigation or safety program
        management contracted by the Air Force or ARC require access to privileged safety informa-
        tion. The wing chief of safety, MAJCOM/SE, or HQ AFSC may provide the contractors safety
        reports for this function.
        3.3.3.5.6. Contractors who build, design, maintain, or operate Air Force weapon systems,
        their components, or other Air Force equipment may need privileged safety information to
        correct defects or other problems and prevent future mishaps. The wing chief of safety, MAJ-
        COM/SE, System Program Office safety officer or equivalent, or HQ USAF/SE/SED may
        provide contractors privileged safety information for this function. This includes Space Sys-
        tem Contractors, Space Technical Support Contractors, Advisory & Assistance Services
        (A&AS), and Federally Funded Research & Development Centers (FFRDC) when they are
        performing an Air Force function.
        3.3.3.5.7. Any other release of privileged safety information to contractors will first be
        approved by HQ USAF/SE/SED.
     3.3.3.6. Limiting Release to Other Services and DOD Agencies. Other US military services and
     DOD agencies responsible for flying, supporting or maintaining Air Force aircraft may receive
     privileged safety information when needed for mishap prevention. Joint project or program offices
     may share privileged safety information with members of other DOD agencies working on the
     same project or program without prior approval. Approval authority for exchanging formal safety
     reports with other military services is HQ USAF/SE/SED or HQ AFSC/JA.
     3.3.3.7. Limiting Release to Foreign Military Organizations. All agreements regarding the release
     of safety information to foreign military organizations are subject to the limitations and guidance
     found in DoDI 6055.7. Release of safety information to NATO military organizations is governed
     by NATO STANAGs 3101, Exchange of Safety Information Concerning Aircraft and Missiles,
     and 3531, Safety Investigation and Reporting of Accidents/Incidents Involving Military Aircraft
     and/or Missiles. Many other foreign military organizations have MOAs/MOUs with HQ USAF/
     SE discussing the release of safety information.
        3.3.3.7.1. Foreign Nationals Flying USAF Aircraft or Participating in USAF Training.
        Release of safety information to foreign nationals is governed by DoDI 6055.7. Note that for-
        eign national military personnel assigned to the DoD Components are defined as DoD military
        personnel by DoDI 6055.7.
AFI91-204_ACCSUP_I 16 NOVEMBER 2007                                                                      35


      3.3.3.8. Limiting Release of Nuclear Safety Reports to Agencies outside the Air Force. HQ
      USAF/SE may approve the release of extracts of nuclear safety reports to US governmental agen-
      cies with statutory jurisdiction, such as the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA); and oper-
      ations offices or authorized contractors of the Department of Energy. The MAJCOM commander
      may provide DULL SWORD reports about weapons and common equipment deficiencies to the
      unified commander as deemed appropriate and necessary for the theater commander to accom-
      plish his or her role in nuclear surety. Send this information by inclusion of the appropriate unified
      command address in the message report as provided by the MAJCOM supplement to this instruc-
      tion. The unified commander ensures the information is treated as privileged information and not
      released or distributed outside the respective headquarters without first obtaining permission from
      HQ USAF/SE. The Air Force releases this information only to reach its nuclear surety goals.
      3.3.3.9. Limiting Release to NTSB and FAA. AFJI 91-206, Participation in a Military or Civil
      Aircraft Accident Safety Investigation governs the release of safety information to the NTSB and
      FAA for aviation mishaps. For other mishaps, use AFJI 91-206 as a guide.
      3.3.3.10. Limiting Release to NASA and National Reconnaissance Office (NRO). Applicable
      space safety reports will be distributed to NASA and NRO upon completion.

3.4. Handling and Disclosing Reports on Ground and Industrial, and Explosives and Chemical
Agents Mishaps that occurred before 3 Oct 00.
   3.4.1. The purpose of these reports is mishap prevention. The reports were normally considered gen-
   eral-use reports in that witnesses were not promised confidentiality, and the reports were not consid-
   ered privileged. However, they are FOUO and are handled according to DODI 5400.7-R/AF
   Supplement, DOD Freedom Of Information Act Program.
   3.4.2. Do not disclose the identities of involved personnel in educational or promotional materiels.
   3.4.3. These reports can be released outside the Air Force safety community and outside the Air
   Force once protected information, including Privacy Act information, findings, and recommendations
   are removed. The installation chief of safety is the release authority for providing these reports to
   other Air Force personnel. The reports may not be used for any purpose other than mishap prevention,
   with the exception that the complete report may be released to Air Force claims personnel to assist
   them in evaluating claims for damages filed against the Air Force. When release will be made outside
   the Air Force, HQ AFSC/JA is the release authority.
   3.4.4. To control reports retain only one copy of each safety report at wing or base, intermediate com-
   mand, and MAJCOM safety offices. Air Force and unified command agencies may view these reports
   for official purposes, but they do not release copies without approval of the appropriate disclosure
   authority. Advise personnel viewing these reports that findings of cause, conclusions, recommenda-
   tions, corrective actions, and witness statements taken by safety investigators in the course of the
   investigation are used primarily for mishap prevention purposes. (AFI 91-301, Air Force Occupa-
   tional and Environmental Safety, Fire Protection, and Health (AFOSH) Program, provides guidance
   on the Air Force relationship with OSHA.) Refer all requests for release to HQ AFSC/JA.
   3.4.5. Upon written request, HQ AFSC/JA provides the releasable portions of ground and explosive
   safety reports to the requester.

                                                Chapter 4

                       DETERMINING INVESTIGATIVE RESPONSIBILITY

4.1. General Information. The Air Force generally assigns mishap investigative responsibilities to the
command (MAJCOM) that experienced the loss of an owned asset (property). The command (MAJCOM)
with investigative responsibility may or may not have Operation Control (OPCON) over the asset (prop-
erty). In some cases, mishaps may involve assets or individuals from multiple agencies. Follow the guid-
ance in this chapter to determine investigative responsibility.

4.2. Convening Authority Determination. The convening authority is the individual who has the
authority to order a safety investigation. The MAJCOM/CC of the organization that owns the asset is con-
sidered to be the convening authority unless: HQ USAF/SE assumes investigative responsibility, another
MAJCOM/CC assumes investigative responsibility (with the concurrence of the owning organization and
HQ USAF/SE), or investigative responsibility is delegated to a lower level of command.
4.2. (ACC) Convening Authority Determination. The convening authority for ACC mishaps is desig-
nated in Table 4.1. (Added) (below).

Table 4.1. (Added-ACC) Convening Authority Delegation.

NOTES:
1. All Ground (Off-duty) mishaps will be convened by the nearest installation with a
   full-time ground safety manager.
2. Or as directed by ACC/SE.

     4.2.1. For all on-duty Class A, all nuclear Class A, and all NUCFLASH or BROKEN ARROW mis-
     haps, the MAJCOM/CC is the convening authority. This authority will not be delegated to a subordi-
     nate commander. EXCEPTION: ARC Class A mishaps that are not aviation mishaps (paragraph 4.5.)
     4.2.2. For all other mishaps and events, convening authority may be delegated to an appropriate level
     of command.

4.3. Mishaps Involving Multiple Commands. Involved MAJCOM/CCs will determine which com-
mand will assume investigative responsibility and advise HQ USAF/SE within 24 hours. In general, the
command whose asset initiated the mishap will assume investigative responsibility. If mishap initiation is
AFI91-204_ACCSUP_I 16 NOVEMBER 2007                                                                        37


initially unclear, the command sustaining the highest level of loss in the mishap will assume investigative
responsibility. MAJCOM/CC may determine other compelling reasons exist for assigning investigative
responsibility differently. If MAJCOMs cannot reach agreement, HQ USAF/SE will determine mishap
investigation responsibility.

4.4. Mishaps Involving Multiple Services. For a multi-service or joint operational mishap, activate
Memorandum of Understanding Among the US Army, Air Force and Naval Safety Centers, Headquarters
Marine Corps (Safety Division) and the US Coast Guard Health and Safety Directorate for Safety Inves-
tigation and Reporting of Joint Service Mishaps. MAJCOM/SE should contact HQ USAF/SE if there are
questions.

4.5. Mishaps Involving Air Reserve Component Assets. The convening authority for all ARC Class A
aviation mishaps is the gaining MAJCOM/CC. For all other mishaps and events, convening authority is
determined by the AFRC/CC or NGB/CF as applicable.

4.6. Mishaps Involving NATO Systems or Personnel. Investigate and report mishaps involving Air
Force aircraft, space vehicles, or missiles according to this instruction. Comply with NATO STANAG
3102, Flight Safety Co-operation in Common Ground/Air Space, 3318, Aeromedical Aspects of Aircraft
Accident/Incident Investigation, 3531, Safety Investigation and Reporting of Accidents/Incidents Involv-
ing Military Aircraft and/or Missiles, and Air Standard 85/02A, Investigation of Aircraft/Missile Acci-
dents/Incidents. The investigation required under STANAG 3531 is in addition to, and conducted
separately from, the investigation required by this instruction.

4.7. Mishaps Involving Non-NATO Foreign Military Equipment or Personnel in CONUS. I t                       is
desirable to conduct only one safety investigation that has the full support and participation of all involved
nations. However, separate investigations are authorized if necessary due to law, agreement, or procedure.
   4.7.1. When a mishap/event involves only foreign military assets and/or personnel, the foreign nation
   military authorities are responsible for the investigation. The USAF generally reserves the right to
   participate as an observer on the foreign safety investigation or, if no investigation is conducted, the
   right to conduct its own safety investigation.
   4.7.2. When a mishap/event involves a foreign military aircraft and a US civilian aircraft in the
   CONUS, the NTSB has priority over the investigation. See paragraph 4.8.
   4.7.3. When a mishap/event involves both USAF and foreign assets and/or personnel (military or
   civilian), the Air Force will conduct a safety investigation. Depending on the circumstances the NTSB
   may take priority over the investigation.

4.8. Mishaps Involving Civil Aviation or Commercial Spacelift and/or Federal Air Traffic Ser-
vices.
   4.8.1. The NTSB investigates mishaps involving both Air Force and civil aircraft that occur within
   US jurisdiction. The Air Force may send an observer to the NTSB investigation and/or may conduct a
   separate investigation. However, the NTSB has priority over all evidence.
   4.8.2. Air Force mishaps that occur within US jurisdiction involving commercial spacelift may be
   investigated by the NTSB, the FAA/AST, and the commercial vendor depending on the extent of the
   mishap. The Air Force may send an observer to any of these investigations and/or may conduct a sep-
38                                                      AFI91-204_ACCSUP_I 16 NOVEMBER 2007


     arate investigation. If the NTSB leads the investigation, the NTSB has priority over all evidence. See
     AFMAN 91-222 for more information.
     4.8.3. See AFJI 91-206 for guidance on NTSB, FAA, and Air Force cooperation in these investiga-
     tions.

4.9. Mishaps Involving Contractors.
     4.9.1. Government contractor involvement.
        4.9.1.1. If the Air Force administers the contract and the mishap involves reportable damage or
        injury to the Air Force (paragraph 1.3.1.1.), the MAJCOM/CC administering the contract is the
        convening authority. Convening authority may be delegated IAW paragraph 4.2. The convening
        authority will ensure the mishap is investigated and reported IAW this instruction and the terms of
        the contract.
        4.9.1.2. If the Air Force administers the contract and the mishap involves reportable damage or
        injury to another DOD agency (paragraph 1.3.1.1.), the MAJCOM/CC administering the contract
        will ensure all mishap information is sent to the involved agency with an information copy to HQ
        AFSC.
        4.9.1.3. If another DOD agency administers the contract and the mishap involves reportable dam-
        age or injury to the Air Force (paragraph 1.3.1.1.), the contracting command (MAJCOM who
        owned the resources) will ensure the mishap is investigated and reported according to this instruc-
        tion.
     4.9.2. Mishaps Involving Non-Accepted Air Force Aerospace Vehicles. The MAJCOM/CC who
     negotiates the contract for the aerospace vehicle is the convening authority. Convening authority may
     be delegated IAW paragraph 4.2. The convening authority is responsible for the safety investigation
     and reporting, although the aerospace vehicle may not be under the operational control of the Air
     Force. The aerospace vehicle loss is recorded as a mishap to the Air Force at large (paragraph 1.5.).
     4.9.3. Mishaps involving Aerospace Vehicles Leased to a Non-DOD Organization for Modification,
     Maintenance, Repair, Test, Contract Training, or Experimental Project for a DOD Component, when
     the Government has assumed Ground and Flight Risk. The MAJCOM/CC who negotiates the contract
     for the aerospace vehicle is the convening authority. Convening authority may be delegated IAW
     paragraph 4.2. The convening authority is responsible for the safety investigation and reporting,
     although the aerospace vehicle may not be under the operational control of the Air Force. The aero-
     space vehicle loss is recorded as a mishap to the Air Force at large (paragraph 1.5.).
        4.9.3.1. HQ AFMC normally negotiates all aircraft and engine leases. If another agency negoti-
        ates a lease, the agency and HQ AFMC shall determine whom the convening authority will be
        prior to executing the lease.
     4.9.4. Other Aerospace Vehicle Contractor Mishaps. If a mishap involves government-furnished or
     leased aerospace vehicles, or new production aerospace vehicles (accepted by the Air Force on a DD
     Form 250, Material Inspection and Receiving Report, but not yet delivered), the MAJCOM/CC of the
     command negotiating the contract/lease is the convening authority unless otherwise specified in the
     contract/lease agreement. In cases where contract/lease agreements specify investigative jurisdiction,
     follow the terms of such agreements. In no case will a non-Air Force agency have safety investigation
     jurisdiction.
AFI91-204_ACCSUP_I 16 NOVEMBER 2007                                                                     39


4.10. Civilian Occupational Mishaps.
   4.10.1. OSHA officials may accompany Air Force safety investigators as observers, or they may con-
   duct a separate investigation of occupational mishaps involving either a DOD civilian fatality or the
   inpatient hospitalizations of three or more civilian personnel (one of which must be an on-duty DOD
   civilian employee). Ensure Air Force personnel accompany OSHA officials.
   4.10.1. (ACC) If the Occupational Safety and Health Administration plans to visit or conduct a sepa-
   rate investigation, provide them a complete in-brief and immediately notify the Numbered Air Force
   (NAF) Chief of Safety and HQ ACC/SE. HQ ACC/SE will notify appropriate HQ ACC staff agencies
   and the Air Force Safety Center (AFSC) Ground Safety Division (HQ AFSC/SEG).
   4.10.2. OSHA will be notified when an on-duty mishap resulting in an Air Force civilian employee
   fatality or involving the inpatient hospitalization of three or more people (one of which must be a
   DOD civilian employee) within 8 hours of an on-duty mishap (paragraph 2.7.7.3.).

4.11. Special Circumstances.
   4.11.1. Mishaps Involving Friendly Fire. For all mishaps falling within the definition of Friendly
   Fire, the combatant commander will convene a legal investigation to determine the facts of the inci-
   dent and guide further actions. In consultation with the combatant commander, service or other com-
   manders may convene a safety investigation as required.
   4.11.2. Mishaps Involving Potential Criminal Acts. If safety investigators discover evidence of crim-
   inal acts causal to the mishap, they must immediately stop the investigation and report this fact to the
   convening authority. The convening authority will, after coordinating with HQ USAF/SE, determine
   whether the safety investigation should continue or be suspended, and ensure that an appropriate legal
   investigation is initiated. Safety investigators should contact HQ AFSC/JA to discuss this issue.
      4.11.2.1. If the convening authority decides to suspend the safety investigation, investigators will
      give all non-privileged materiel to the legal investigators and provide them with the names of all
      known witnesses. Alert the criminal investigator if the safety investigator or SIB has interviewed
      any witnesses.

                                                  Chapter 5

                                       SAFETY INVESTIGATIONS

5.1. General Information. The convening authority determines the depth of investigative effort required
for each mishap, subject to this instruction and the appropriate discipline specific safety manual (AFMAN
91-22X). Several factors influence the depth of investigative effort required: severity of injury or occupa-
tional illness, future mishap potential, and whether another agency’s investigation will produce a report
the Air Force can use for mishap prevention. Other agencies, such as the local police or NTSB, may inves-
tigate mishaps that occur within their jurisdiction. A separate Air Force investigation will be completed
when required by this instruction, however, the safety investigator may use the other agencies’ reports and
information when applicable.

5.2. Investigation Timeline. The safety investigation should be completed within 30 days of the mishap.
The investigation should place a greater priority on a complete and accurate safety report than on trying to
finish in the 30 day timeline. If the investigation cannot be completed within this 30 day period, the SIB/
SIO will request an extension from the convening authority. The convening authority will send a copy of
their extension approval to HQ AFSC. EXCEPTION: There may be standing agreements for certain types
of mishaps where the 30 day suspense is extended (see the discipline specific safety manual (AFMAN
91-22X).

5.3. Investigation Funding.
     5.3.1. Local Support. The commander of the Air Force installation hosting the SIB funds all in-house
     support even if the host installation is not assigned to the investigating MAJCOM. See paragraph
     5.3.5. for expenses that exceed the resources of the host installation.
     5.3.2. TDY Travel. Each MAJCOM, via their respective wings/units, funds TDY of its assigned per-
     sonnel who are Air Force SIB members or technical experts, according to AFI 65-601, Volume 1,
     Budget Guidance Procedures. TDY SIB members should be placed on full per diem for the duration
     of the SIB. Dual billeting and rental car should be authorized. For joint service boards, each service
     funds its own members’ TDY. The investigating MAJCOM funds travel costs of members from
     another service appointed to an Air Force SIB. Observers to an Air Force SIB fund their own TDY.
     5.3.2. (ACC) TDY Travel. TDY expenses for Class A Safety Investigation Board (SIB) members are
     the funding responsibility of HQ ACC. TDY expenses for Class B SIB members are the funding
     responsibility of the convening NAF/Direct Reporting Unit. TDY expenses for Class C investigators
     are the funding responsibility of the mishap wing. Funding for Air Launched Missile Analysis Group
     investigations, depending on the circumstances, will come from either the 53d Wing or the system
     program office responsible for the munitions item involved in the mishap. For Class A mishaps, each
     unit will use their own fund cite and will be reimbursed by "after the fact" funding. Include ESP code
     "EM" in the fund cite. Funds will then be reimbursed by the ACC Comptroller (HQ ACC/FM). ANG
     funding will be made through ANG Safety, Jefferson Plaza 1, Arlington, VA (DSN 327-2211/Com-
     mercial 703-607-2211).
     5.3.3. Contractor support. Normally contractors will always travel via their own funding. To provide
     easier access to the base and its facilities required during the investigation, the contractor may request
     a Letter of Identification from the Contracting Officer. The convening authority will honor these
AFI91-204_ACCSUP_I 16 NOVEMBER 2007                                                                        41


   requests. The Letter of Identification will not have a fund cite, i.e., no cost to the government. Joint
   Travel Regulations, Volume 2, Appendix E, Part I, paragraph D and E are applicable.
   5.3.4. Other Support. The convening authority funds leasing of special equipment/vehicles, leased
   communications, and other contractual services. For technical assistance and laboratory analysis
   (paragraph 5.5.) from non-Air Force specialist, the convening authority or SM may have to provide
   funding to obtain a response.
   5.3.5. Cost Overruns. Request an operating budget authority (OBA) adjustment per AFI 65-601, Vol-
   ume 2, Budget Management for Operations, if investigation costs cannot be financed through repro-
   gramming within the OBA.
   5.3.6. (Added-ACC) Units should advise the ACC Flight Safety Branch (HQ ACC/SEF) and notify
   the local FMA (Financial Analysis Division) office if unable to provide funds. The local FMA office
   will, in turn, contact ACC Base Support (HQ ACC/FMAOS), 216 Sweeney Blvd, Suite 210, Langley
   AFB VA, 23665-2792, DSN 574-4709.

5.4. Investigation Options. The size and membership of the investigation depends on the category and
complexity of the mishap being investigated. The investigation must have the correct complement of
members to properly complete the investigation. Investigations may be made up of multiple members
(SIB), or a single member (SIO). Refer to the discipline specific safety manual (AFMAN 91-22X) for
requirements. The SIB will inform the convening authority of all members of the investigation (SIB mem-
bers, observers, and technical experts).
   5.4.1. Safety Investigation Boards (SIB). SIBs are made up of multiple members assigned to investi-
   gate a mishap. Contractor representatives will not be members of a SIB. They are technical experts
   providing assistance to a SIB.
       5.4.1.1. At least one SIB member must be equal to or senior in rank to the senior person directly
       involved in the mishap. Normally, the SIB president is the senior SIB member.
       5.4.1.2. Select SIB members who do not have a personal interest in the investigation and who are
       able to act impartially. SIB members will be selected from outside the mishap wing whenever pos-
       sible.
       5.4.1.3. Select a SIB member qualified in safety investigation for each safety discipline involved
       in the mishap.
       5.4.1.4. Do not assign foreign exchange officers or other foreign officers serving with the USAF
       as formal SIB members. This exclusion does not apply to HQ AFSC SIB representatives. Comply
       with provisions in standing international agreements.
       5.4.1.5. ARC participation in SIBs. Convening authority may appoint Reservists/Air National
       Guardsmen to SIBs with the concurrence of the AFRC/National Guard Bureau (NGB). Ensure
       SIB duties do not create a conflict of interest with the individual's civilian occupation or interests.
           5.4.1.5.1. AFRC. Air Reserve Technicians may elect to participate in either military or civil-
           ian status, as appropriate. Traditional reservists will be in a military status.
           5.4.1.5.2. ANG. ANG personnel may elect to participate in either military or technician sta-
           tus, as appropriate.
42                                                       AFI91-204_ACCSUP_I 16 NOVEMBER 2007


        5.4.1.6. All safety investigations involving ARC assets that are conducted by a SIB shall be per-
        mitted to have at least one member selected by the AFRC or NGB, as applicable.
     5.4.2. Single Investigating Officer (SIO). Depending on the circumstances of the mishap, an individ-
     ual investigator may be appointed to conduct the investigation.
     5.4.3. Air Force Participation in Non-Air Force Investigations. When Air Force representation to
     another Service’s investigation is desired, HQ AFSC will contact the MAJCOM(s) that can best meet
     the requirement. The MAJCOM/SE will coordinate the selection with HQ AFSC. Once HQ USAF/
     SED approves the nominee, HQ AFSC will provide a fund site to the MAJCOM and establish direct
     communication with the individual. Air Force representatives to Joint Safety Investigations should be
     graduates of formal Air Force safety training courses.
     5.4.4. Participation in Air Force Investigations by Non-Air Force Personnel. Sometimes a mishap
     involves weapon systems or equipment common to another US military service or agency (FAA,
     NASA, etc.). In these cases personnel from the other service or agency may request to observe the Air
     Force investigation. HQ AFSC forwards these requests to the convening authority. Refer to AFJI
     91-206 and applicable MOA/MOUs for interagency involvement. Observers are authorized to
     observe SIB activities and may participate to the extent authorized by the SIB president and published
     guidance. An observer is not a member of the Air Force SIB. Non-DOD observers may not participate
     in interviews where a witness is given a promise of confidentiality or in the safety investigators’ anal-
     ysis. EXCEPTION: For NTSB and FAA observers, see AFJI 91-206.

5.5. Obtaining and Using Technical Assistance and Laboratory Analysis. When the investigation is
beyond the expertise of the SIB/SIO, request technical assistance.
     5.5.1. For all Class A and B mishaps, technical assistance and laboratory analysis will be requested
     through HQ AFSC IAW published convening authority procedures. For all other mishap classes, tech-
     nical assistance and laboratory analysis is available through HQ AFSC. NOTE: See Attachment 2 for
     technical assistance contact information.
     5.5.2. Using Technical Experts.
        5.5.2.1. Technical experts supporting an investigation are under the control and authority of the
        SIB president or SIO. This applies to DOD military and civilian personnel as well as contractor
        representatives.
        5.5.2.2. Upon completion of their investigations, technical experts must provide a written report
        (signed paper copy and an electronic copy) detailing results of their work. A specific report format
        is not required, but the format in Figure 5.1. is suggested.
        5.5.2.3. SIB presidents and SIOs must ensure a "non-disclosure statement" on protection of priv-
        ileged data is prepared (Figure A3.7.) and endorsed by all technical experts (e.g., contractors,
        NTSB, FAA, etc.) who are offered a promise of confidentiality or provided access to privileged
        information. NOTE: See paragraph 3.2.5.2. for safety investigations where a promise of confiden-
        tiality is authorized. This memorandum is not required from Air Force civilian employees.
     5.5.3. Reports from Technical Experts.
        5.5.3.1. All technical experts are encouraged to summarize observations, analysis, and conclu-
        sions based solely on physical evidence and other factual information. The SIB/SIO will thor-
AFI91-204_ACCSUP_I 16 NOVEMBER 2007                                                                       43


       oughly review all reports from technical experts to ensure they do not contain privileged
       information.
       5.5.3.2. Technical experts may also provide analysis and conclusions regarding privileged infor-
       mation (paragraph 3.2.5.5. and 3.3.3.5.1.). See Figure A3.8. for the cover sheet on privileged
       reporting.
       5.5.3.3. If conflicting reports from different technical experts or laboratories are received, include
       both reports in the formal report. In the investigative narrative, provide rationale explaining why
       one report was determined to be more applicable and why opposing views were discounted.

Figure 5.1. Suggested Technical Analysis Summary Format.


    Mishap System: Type and serial number
    Mishap Date:
    Investigator: Name, organizational address, and phone numbers.
    INTRODUCTION: Intent of the report or analysis; purpose.
    BACKGROUND: Not always required. If used, a statement of the mishap scenario, limited to
    facts.
    EVALUATION: Investigator analysis.
    DETERMINATION: Investigator observations, opinions and conclusions about the analysis
    performed. Describe strong and weak points of analysis if appropriate. Do not include any
    opinion as to whether or not a particular failure contributed to or caused the mishap. (This does
    not preclude stating an opinion that a failure would likely create a certain condition, even if the
    mishap was inevitable under such a condition. For example, an opinion could be expressed that a
    widget failure would have caused trim to move to the full nose up position, without making the
    connecting statement that such a trim position would inevitably cause a crash.) If any analysis or
    conclusions are based on privileged information the report must be marked with privileged
    warning statement in Figure A3.1.

5.6. Controlling Information Collected by the SIB/SIO. SIB presidents/SIOs will ensure that all
information, privileged or not, collected by safety investigators, is not released outside safety channels
except in accordance with this instruction or upon approval of the convening authority. The SIB presi-
dent/SIO is the final point of release for all information (including electronic/digital media, photographs,
etc.) from the safety investigation.
   5.6.1. SIB presidents/SIOs will ensure that everyone working on their team is briefed on the restric-
   tions. Every member of a safety investigation team that produces a formal report (Table 6.2.) will sign
   the memorandum at Figure 5.2. acknowledging the guidance and restrictions placed on information
   gathered during a safety investigation. The memorandum will be filed in Tab A of the formal report.
44                                                         AFI91-204_ACCSUP_I 16 NOVEMBER 2007


Figure 5.2. Memorandum Documenting Guidance to Investigators on Controlling Information.


       1. The members, whose names and signatures appear below, of the safety team formed to
       investigate the mishap on (date of mishap) involving (aircraft/vehicle/equipment/etc.) have been
       advised by (name of board president/SIO) of the following:
          a. This investigation is being conducted under the provisions of AFI 91-204 for the purpose of
          mishap prevention within the United States Air Force and to determine all factors relating to the
          mishap in order to prevent future mishaps.
          b. It is very important that the investigating team avoid: tainting potential witnesses for this or
          any subsequent investigation; contributing to speculation about mishap causes; or releasing
          potentially offensive images to friends and/or families of those involved in a mishap.
          c. All information, privileged or not, collected by safety investigators, will not be released out
          side safety channels except in accordance with AFI 91-204 or upon approval of the convening
          authority. The SIB president is the final point of release for all information (including electronic/
          digital media, photographs, etc.) from the safety investigation.
       2. We understand and acknowledge the guidelines for controlling information collected by safety
       investigators.

        5.6.1.1. The SIB/SIO is not prohibited from sharing information with technical experts who,
        although not members of a board, analyze information or wreckage on behalf of safety investiga-
        tors.

5.7. Investigative Evidence.
     5.7.1. Impounding Air Force Materiel/Wreckage. ISB/SIB/SIO have inherent priorities over other
     activities and investigations connected to the mishap, including the right to impound Air Force prop-
     erty involved in the mishap. Group commanders or higher are required to act on their impoundment
     requests. However, safety of personnel (to include emergency response forces) and control of hazard-
     ous materiels always take precedence over safety investigations, even at the risk of losing evidence.
     An installation commander in coordination with the ISB president or SIB president may choose to
     remove wreckage interfering with essential mission activities or causing a hazard at the mishap scene.
     Wreckage may need to be removed or destroyed to prevent interference with operations or vital civil
     functions. If wreckage must be moved prior to the arrival of the SIB/SIO, thoroughly document the
     site (photographs, video) prior to moving if time permits.
     5.7.2. Life Science Evidence. This includes the physical exam, laboratory and radiological testing of
     survivors, personal equipment, life support equipment, medical/dental/mental health/OB/GYN/sub-
     stance abuse/family advocacy charts and past histories and initial medical interviews, and other infor-
     mation which points to the mental and physical capability of the personnel involved in the mishap.
     Human remains are also evidence. The SIB medical member should be aware of where all remains are
     and what their status is, i.e., awaiting autopsy, return to family, etc. Consult the mortuary officer of the
     supporting base to determine if civil authorities have jurisdiction over human remains. The mortuary
     officer should have an MOA/MOU with civil authorities according to AFI 34-242, Mortuary Affairs
     Program. Safety personnel, ISB and SIB medical members shall ensure AFIP is notified and given
     contact information for civil authorities exercising jurisdiction over human remains when a fatal mis-
     hap occurs.
AFI91-204_ACCSUP_I 16 NOVEMBER 2007                                                                  45


  5.7.3. Witnesses. Use the following guidelines for witnesses:
     5.7.3.1. Do not administer truth serums, hypnotic techniques, drugs, or polygraph tests. If a wit-
     ness provides a statement while under medication, add a notation to their statement.
     5.7.3.2. If a witness refuses to testify, contact the MAJCOM/JA.
     5.7.3.3. Do not have witnesses testify under oath. Ensure witnesses understand that they are
     obliged to give honest, good faith testimony. See paragraph 3.2.5. for a discussion on the promise
     of confidentiality.
     5.7.3.4. If a safety investigator believes Air Force personnel questioned in the investigation may
     be guilty of criminal misconduct, refer to paragraph 4.11.2.
     5.7.3.5. Interviewing witnesses suspected of criminal misconduct. If, after suspending a safety
     investigation because of potential criminal acts, the convening authority decides to continue the
     safety investigation, safety investigators may have to interview witness(es) suspected of criminal
     misconduct. Contact HQ AFSC/JA if the SIB is required to interview suspected criminals.
     5.7.3.6. Retaining Access to Participants. Safety investigators may need frequent access to or
     multiple interviews with participants in a mishap. Commanders will make all participants avail-
     able to the investigation upon request of the SIB president/SIO. The SIB president/SIO will advise
     the commander when participants are no longer needed.
     5.7.3.7. Returning Participants to Duty. Safety investigators make no determinations regarding
     the fitness of participants to be returned to normal duties. Commanders decide if and when partic-
     ipants are to be returned to duty.
     5.7.3.8. Commercial Space Launch Mishap. Refrain from interviewing witnesses until the FAA/
     NTSB representative has arrived, unless there is a compelling reason to take the witness’ state-
     ment(s) immediately.
     5.7.3.9. This instruction requires collecting and maintaining information protected by the Privacy
     Act of 1974 as authorized by Title 10 United States Code, section 8013 and Executive Order 9397.
         5.7.3.9.1. Safety investigators will request the SSN of military members and civilian employ-
         ees involved in reportable mishaps. Inform individuals that Title 10 USC 8013 and EO 9397
         are the legal authority for requesting the SSN and that the SSN will be used for safety mishap
         investigating and reporting.
  5.7.4. Disposing of Evidence.
     5.7.4.1. Operational assets. Once the investigation has recovered all necessary evidence from the
     asset involved in the mishap, the safety investigator will, at an appropriate time, advise the con-
     vening authority (after coordinating with the legal board if required) when the asset can be turned
     over to the operating unit. The legal board is responsible for operational assets given to them by
     the SIB. The convening authority is the final authority to release the asset to the operating unit.
     EXCEPTION: All wreckage from Class A space, aviation, and guided missile mishaps require a
     formal release from AFLSA/JACT before being released to the operating unit.
     5.7.4.2. Wreckage.
46                                                       AFI91-204_ACCSUP_I 16 NOVEMBER 2007


            5.7.4.2.1. After the SIB has gathered all necessary information from the wreckage, and there
            is a legal investigation, transfer custody of the wreckage to the legal board president in writing
            IAW AFMAN 91-22X.
            5.7.4.2.2. Release wreckage not needed in support of depot, laboratory, or the legal investiga-
            tion to the host installation commander in writing for storage until the wreckage is released for
            disposal. AFLSA/JACT is the release authority for Class A space, aviation, and guided missile
            mishaps. The host legal office is the release authority for all other mishaps.
            5.7.4.2.3. All reasonable actions must be made to remove and properly dispose of wreckage.
            Special care must be given to the removal of all wreckage on private or state owned property.
        5.7.4.3. Other Evidence.
            5.7.4.3.1. For Class A mishaps, or when notified there will be a legal board for other mishaps,
            provide all non-privileged evidence (photographs, videotapes, data, documentation, and other
            evidence) to the legal board in writing IAW AFMAN 91-22X. The legal board will be respon-
            sible for final disposition of all materiel released to them by the SIB. For other than Class A
            mishaps, when there is no legal board, contact the host installation staff judge advocate for
            guidance on disposing of materiels that may needed in potential claims or litigation. If there
            are no such requirements, reproduce enough copies for the safety report and then return the
            original documents and records used by the SIB to their proper custodian.
            5.7.4.3.2. In the case of fatalities, the disposition of human bodies and human tissue is depen-
            dent on who has legal jurisdiction over the remains; often this may be a local civilian coroner
            or medical examiner. Work with Mortuary Affairs and the local JA to clarify jurisdiction and
            disposition of human remains.

5.8. Identifying Hazards.
     5.8.1. The requirements in this section apply to all Class A and B mishaps. These same requirements
     can be applied to other occurrences if desired.
     5.8.2. Identify and document hazards that played a role in the mishap sequence. Hazards are defined
     as "any real or potential condition that can cause injury or occupational illness to personnel; damage
     to or loss of a system, equipment or property; or damage to the environment." Determine whether
     individuals or management addressed these hazards during preparation and execution of the mishap
     sequence.

5.9. Determining and Documenting Findings.
     5.9.1. Findings are based on the weight of evidence, professional knowledge, and good judgment.
     5.9.2. Each finding is a single event or condition. Each finding is an essential step in the mishap
     sequence, but each finding is not necessarily causal. Do not include any more information than is nec-
     essary to explain the event.
     5.9.3. Each finding must have a logical connection to preceding findings. If no logical relationship
     exists, the sequence of the mishap has not been correctly described.
AFI91-204_ACCSUP_I 16 NOVEMBER 2007                                                                      47


  5.9.4. Ensure critical events required to sustain the mishap sequence have not been omitted. Con-
  versely, do not include events interesting to the reader, but not necessary to sustain the mishap
  sequence.
  5.9.5. In some cases the sequence begins long before the actual mishap sequence with such things as
  design problems, improperly written directives, or an inadequate training program.
  5.9.6. Ensure the sequence continues to the point where all damage or injury has occurred and the ini-
  tial rescue or recovery actions are completed.
  5.9.7. Include injuries occurring in the mishap, at the appropriate chronological point in the event
  sequence. For example, insert ejection injury events occurring before the aircraft-ground impact find-
  ing at the proper chronological point. Injuries or fatalities suffered by persons on the ground following
  a crash would be at the end of the main sequence, (e.g., "the Range Safety Officer successfully initi-
  ated the self-destruct sequence; debris from the launch booster crashed into a fishing boat, fatally
  injuring two people" or "the pilot ejected successfully; the aircraft crashed in a parking lot adjacent to
  the runway, fatally injuring two persons").
  5.9.8. Findings are arranged in chronological order. Number the findings consecutively. Precede each
  number with the word "Finding" (e.g., Finding 1, Finding 2, etc.).
  5.9.9. Write findings as full sentences, not bullet points. Use past tense, since the events occurred in
  the past. (Example: Incorrect – Crew chief clears pilot from chocks and the pilot taxis to runway. Cor-
  rect – The crew chief cleared the pilot from the chocks and the pilot taxied to the runway.)
  5.9.10. When the safety investigator cannot pinpoint a correctable event in a sequence, list as much of
  the sequence as can be supported and insert a statement relating to the undetermined area. If there are
  supportable alternatives identify them as such and list them. Show them as subordinate to the applica-
  ble finding by using a format such as "event X most likely occurred due to one or more of the follow-
  ing reasons."
     5.9.10.1. The reasons should be listed from most probable to least probable.
     5.9.10.2. Do not list all of the possible alternatives that could have existed merely because they
     cannot be eliminated. Place this sort of conjecture in the analysis and narrative.
  5.9.11. Do not include people’s names, names of Air Force bases or companies in the findings. Use
  terms as "the aircraft," "the flight lead," "the wingman," "the F-16 pilot," "the pilot," "the crew," "the
  instructor loadmaster," "the evaluator boom operator," or "the crewchief." NOTE: Do not use the term
  mishap in front of the object, i.e., mishap aircraft, mishap pilot, mishap crewchief. Be specific, but do
  not include supporting evidence in the findings. The report narrative includes supporting evidence and
  conclusions.
  5.9.12. Findings shall not include new materiel not addressed in the narrative. If the finding is not
  identifiable in the narrative, you have not written the narrative completely.
  5.9.13. After developing the findings, apply the following "Findings Test" for validation:
     5.9.13.1. Is the Finding necessary to sustain the mishap sequence?
     5.9.13.2. Is the Finding a single event or condition?
     5.9.13.3. Is the Finding specific enough without including supporting evidence?
48                                                       AFI91-204_ACCSUP_I 16 NOVEMBER 2007


        5.9.13.4. Does the Finding logically connect to the preceding finding? Read the last finding; ask
        "why"? Does the finding above answer the "why"? Continue for each finding.
        5.9.13.5. Is the Finding relevant or simply interesting to the reader?

5.10. Determining and Documenting Causes.
     5.10.1. A cause is a deficiency, which if corrected, eliminated, or avoided, would likely have pre-
     vented or mitigated the mishap damage or significant injury. Cause does not imply blame. The intent
     is to identify the point where corrective action is needed.
     5.10.2. Findings that sustained the mishap sequence, but were normal to the situation as it developed
     are not causal. In most instances a causal finding is correctable by commanders, supervisors, or indi-
     viduals.
     5.10.3. Apply the reasonable person concept when determining a cause. If a person’s performance or
     judgment was reasonable considering the mishap circumstances, do not assign cause. It is not appro-
     priate to expect extraordinary or uniquely superior performance in such cases. Human factors (physi-
     ological or psychological) may be causal even though they are reasonable. These are often the
     unavoidable effects of a preceding cause.
     5.10.4. Do not list a party as causal for not taking an action unless they should reasonably have been
     expected to take such action, but they did not. Similar rationale applies to lack of a system or proce-
     dure. Do not list failure to provide a system or procedure as causal unless a party should reasonably
     have been expected to do so given the information available prior to the mishap.
     5.10.5. Not every finding is causal. Some are effects or the expected result of a previously identified
     cause even though their inclusion sustains the sequence leading to the mishap. An engine flameout
     precipitated by a fuel boost pump failure is the expected result of the boost pump failure and is not
     causal. The boost pump failure may have been a result of an even earlier cause such as a bearing fail-
     ure.
     5.10.6. Environmental conditions such as a bird strike, lightning, high wind, solar wind, meteorites,
     or flood, may be causal only if all reasonable avoidance and damage/injury mitigation actions were
     taken.
     5.10.7. An individual, group or organization is virtually always responsible for a failure. Publications
     or objects should almost never be found causal. Rather, the party responsible for ensuring the publica-
     tions are correct or the party responsible for ensuring an object does not fail with catastrophic conse-
     quences is causal, unless the party took all reasonably expected actions. In such cases, there may be
     process or organizational failures, and appropriate parties may be identified as responsible for these
     failures.
        5.10.7.1. The intent of identifying causal parties in an investigation is to identify the point where
        corrective action is needed, not to place blame. As such, safety investigators need to ensure they
        identify the correct causal agent. This can be done by asking "Why" something occurred until the
        investigator comes to a "dead end."
     5.10.8. Occasionally, an investigator may not be able to conclusively determine a specific causal
     event. In these special cases, the investigator may choose to list two or three most probable causes for
     each option. In rare instances the causal event may be unknown.
AFI91-204_ACCSUP_I 16 NOVEMBER 2007                                                                     49


   5.10.9. Causal findings should always be worded in active voice, clearly identifying the actor(s) and
   causal action (deficiency), along with any necessary explanation. Examples: Passive – No safety pins
   were installed in the widget. Active – The crew chief failed to install safety pins in the widget as
   required by tech orders. Passive – Mission planning did not cover en-route obstacles. Active – The
   crew failed to address en-route obstacles in mission planning as required.
   5.10.10. Identify causal findings by adding the word "CAUSE" to the beginning of the finding state-
   ment. Do not list causes under a separate heading. Word a causal finding as a clear and simple state-
   ment of a single condition or event.
   5.10.11. Causal findings should identify the causal agent ("Who") and the action taken ("What").
   Why the action (or lack of action) occurred should be fully explained in the narrative and may be
   included in the causal finding if appropriate.
   5.10.12. After determining the causal findings, apply the following "Cause Test" for validation:
      5.10.12.1. Is the Causal Finding correctable by commanders, supervisors or individuals?
      5.10.12.2. Is the Causal Finding a clear and simple statement of a single condition or event?
      5.10.12.3. Is the Causal Finding in the active voice and does it follow the format: Who did what
      to whom/what and why?
      5.10.12.4. If the Causal Finding is an effect or an expected result of a previously identified cause,
      even though its inclusion sustains the mishap sequence, it is not causal.

5.11. Determining and Documenting Recommendations.
   5.11.1. Recommendations are feasible and effective solutions to eliminate identified hazards, or if the
   hazard cannot be eliminated, to mitigate the hazard’s potential consequences. With few exceptions, all
   safety investigations (including Class E reports) should include recommendations to prevent or miti-
   gate future mishaps. If no recommendations are made, investigators will explain their rationale in the
   report narrative.
   5.11.2. Developing feasible and effective recommendations is a methodical process, which seeks to
   identify risk mitigation alternatives. It is essential to know precisely what deficiency, or identified
   hazard, one is addressing and to stay focused on it.
   5.11.3. Developing sound recommendations also requires recognition of the "order of precedence"
   concept, which recognizes that not all risk mitigation alternatives are equal. Design fixes are the most
   preferable solution because they can often completely eliminate the hazard, but these types of fixes
   often have the highest upfront costs. They may require unacceptable operational constraints so addi-
   tional alternatives must be considered. Along with design fixes, one should look for potential fixes
   that incorporate safety and warning devices. Lastly, look at changes to procedures and training.
   5.11.4. All recommendations should target one or more of the hazards identified during the investiga-
   tion. It is also sometimes prudent to make two or more recommendations against one hazard. In all
   cases use the order of precedence to develop risk mitigation alternatives. As an example, to eliminate
   or mitigate the identified hazard of "pilot’s failure to command landing gear extension," which results
   in a gear-up landing of a training aircraft, one might consider the following:
      5.11.4.1. Design: Implement a fixed gear.
50                                                       AFI91-204_ACCSUP_I 16 NOVEMBER 2007


        5.11.4.2. Incorporate Safety Devices: Implement an auto-extend system.
        5.11.4.3. Provide Warning Devices: Implement cockpit warning lights, warning tone or voice.
        5.11.4.4. Develop Training and Procedures: Improve the written checklist, or its use via training
        with instructors and in simulators.
     5.11.5. Based upon the specific information discovered during the investigation, selected alternatives
     should be formulated into feasible and effective recommendations and other alternatives discarded.
     The purpose of using the ‘order of precedence’ is to ensure investigations consider the entire range of
     available options and not just the cheap and easy ones – which usually have the least mishap preven-
     tion value.
     5.11.6. A great deal of debate usually surrounds what is feasible and effective. Sometimes a risk mit-
     igation alternative is technically feasible and effective, but it is clearly not economically feasible or
     has unacceptable mission consequences. In this case, discard the alternative. In other cases it may not
     be clear that an alternative is either technically feasible or economically feasible. In these cases,
     include a recommendation for formal evaluation.
     5.11.7. Most causal findings should have recommendations for future prevention or mitigation,
     although exceptions are permitted. Likewise, findings that are not causal may also have recommenda-
     tions written against them.
     5.11.8. Recommendations may also vary in scope. Some actions can be taken at unit level. Other rec-
     ommendations require MAJCOM or other agency actions.
     5.11.8. (ACC) Recommendations for action agencies above wing level for Class C and below mis-
     haps will be coordinated through the ACC Flight Safety Branch (HQ ACC/SEF), ACC Ground Safety
     Branch (HQ ACC/SEG) and the ACC Weapons Safety Branch (HQ ACC/SEW) as applicable, via
     e-mail or telephone prior to report submission, to ensure proper agencies are appointed.
     5.11.9. If a recommendation depends on tests or analyses that are incomplete when the report is trans-
     mitted, explain this and provide a reference to the tests or analyses (such as deficiency report, study,
     or contract number).
     5.11.10. Recommendations should require the action agency to correct a deficiency rather than to
     implement a particular solution. The action agency normally has greater expertise than the investiga-
     tors and should be given the opportunity to develop the optimal solution for a problem. The following
     examples illustrate this point: Poor – Move the right engine fire pushbutton to the right side of the
     cockpit. Better – Implement changes to the engine fire pushbuttons to help preclude engine shutdown
     errors.
     5.11.11. Avoid recommendations that only require a study or evaluation. Action should be required
     based upon results of any recommended study. In most cases, it is not necessary to recommend a study
     or evaluation, since studies or evaluations are implicit in the process. The recommendation can simply
     require corrective action. Examples: Poor – Evaluate the feasibility of changes to the anti-lock system.
     Better – Implement changes to the anti-lock system to prevent loss of feedback.
     5.11.12. General, vague, sweeping, or open-ended recommendations that cannot be closed by the
     action agency are not appropriate. Write recommendations that have a definitive closing action.
     5.11.13. Do not recommend briefing personnel on the mishap. Such a briefing is a basic commander
     responsibility and a normal function of safety offices at all levels of command.
AFI91-204_ACCSUP_I 16 NOVEMBER 2007                                                                  51


  5.11.14. Do not recommend reminding personnel of the importance of simply doing their jobs prop-
  erly. However, recommendations to place CAUTIONS and WARNINGS in TOs guidance relating
  the adverse consequences of not doing one’s job properly may be appropriate. Recommendations for
  specific action such as refresher training, implementing in-process inspections, etc., to ensure job
  duties are being properly performed, may also be appropriate since they are specific and can be
  closed.
  5.11.15. Number recommendations consecutively and precede each number by the word "Recom-
  mendation." (e.g., Recommendation 1, Recommendation 2, etc.). Include only one statement for each
  recommendation. Rather than sub-grouping recommendations (e.g., 1a, 1b, 1c, etc.) use a new recom-
  mendation number.
  5.11.16. Recommendations to Change Publications.
     5.11.16.1. Recommendations may be made to change publications, technical orders, flight manu-
     als, or checklists. Submit AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication (flight publi-
     cations), according to AFI 11-215, Flight Manuals Program. Submit AFTO Form 22, Technical
     Manual Change Recommendation and Reply, according to TO 00-5-1, Air Force Technical Order
     System. Utilize local base support personnel (Stan Eval and/or QA) for assistance in completing
     the forms. If the proposed change is time sensitive, use the emergency critical safety hazard mes-
     sage format in AFI 11-215 or the emergency report format in TO 00-5-1.
     5.11.16.2. Obtain tracking number from MAJCOM Stan Eval for AF Forms 847 and unit QA for
     AFTO Forms 22. Place the tracking number, the mishap event number, and the mishap’s AFSAS
     number (if mishap is reported via AFSAS) on submitted Forms 847 or 22, to ensure these recom-
     mendations receive the appropriate levels of review. Also, place the tracking number after corre-
     sponding recommendation in the final message/report. Submit completed forms to the MAJCOM
     Stan Eval or LG Command Control Point (CCP), as applicable after the investigation is complete
     (paragraph 6.5.).
     5.11.16.3. In all cases, protect privileged safety information by sanitizing (paragraph 3.3.1.) the
     "reason for recommended change" section of AFTO Form 22 or AF Form 847. The SIB/SIO will
     place copies of the submitted forms in the applicable formal report tab.
  5.11.17. Determining the appropriate action agencies for each recommendation.
     5.11.17.1. Assign action agencies for all recommendations. An office of primary responsibility
     (OPR) is required for every recommendation. Although an office of collateral responsibility
     (OCR) is not required, they are appropriate for many recommendations. List only one OPR per
     recommendation. More than one OCR may be listed for an individual recommendation. Limit
     OPR and OCR assignment to two or three-digit organizational levels to ensure proper manage-
     ment level attention.
     5.11.17.2. Assign OPRs and OCRs based upon the lead command and user command philosophy.
     The Air Force assigns responsibility for overall management of each system to a "lead command"
     to ensure that all requirements associated with every system receive comprehensive and equitable
     consideration. This lead command provides primary input into the process of developing and
     maintaining a force structure with a balance of complementary capabilities, and it establishes a
     basis for rational allocation of scare resources among competing requirements. See AFPD 10-9,
     for more information.
52                                                     AFI91-204_ACCSUP_I 16 NOVEMBER 2007


      5.11.17.3. Normally, if a recommendation requires funding to effect changes to a weapon system
      (e.g., performing risk analyses or engineering studies, developing aircraft or component modifica-
      tions, obtaining new test or support equipment, etc.), assign the appropriate office for the mishap
      weapon system, within the lead command as OPR. If the lead command only provides funds for
      the effort and another organization is responsible for performing or managing the work, assign
      these organizations as OCRs. For example: Implement changes to the B-1 to reduce the probabil-
      ity of encountering "hot brake" temperatures. OPR: ACC/DRA OCR: OC-ALC/LAB. In this
      example ACC/DRA is assigned as OPR because, as the appropriate office in the lead command,
      they would be responsible to arrange for the funding required to effect changes to the aircraft.
      Assuming that funding is provided, the B-1 system program office at OC-ALC/LAB is assigned as
      OCR since they would either perform the required work in-house or manage the contracted effort.
      5.11.17.4. Not all funding comes from the lead command. Sometimes it is possible for a system
      program office, item management office, laboratory or other organization to fund efforts through
      separate budgets. If a recommendation does not require funding from the lead command to effect
      changes to a weapon system (e.g., performing risk analyses or engineering studies, developing and
      obtaining preferred spares, developing inspection techniques and procedures, simple modifica-
      tions and testing of software in conjunction with scheduled updates, limited flight and ground test-
      ing, etc.), assign the appropriate office that has the funding as OPR. Assign OCRs as required.
      5.11.17.5. Although changes to training programs, training equipment, and publishing new or
      changed paper documents (e.g., Air Force Policy Directives, Air Force Instructions, flight manu-
      als, technical orders, etc.), require funding, assign the organization responsible for controlling the
      content of these products as OPR. Assign OCRs as required.
      5.11.17.6. Sometimes the responsibility for a recommendation lies outside the Air Force (e.g., the
      FAA for various air traffic control issues). Since the Air Force may not have the authority to task
      such agencies to perform recommended actions, do not assign non-Air Force agencies as OPRs or
      OCRs. In these cases, write the recommendation as an Air Force action and assign the appropriate
      Air Force organization as OPR. This Air Force organization is typically responsible for interaction
      with or contractual oversight of the outside agency and will ensure proper recommendation evalu-
      ation and disposition. Assign OCRs as required.
      5.11.17.7. Field Operating Agencies (FOA) normally accomplish Air Force-level actions, not the
      Air Staff itself. Therefore, assign the appropriate Field Operating Agencies as OPRs and OCRs,
      not the Air Staff. For example, air traffic issues are managed by the Air Force Flight Standards
      Agency (AFFSA), not the Deputy Chief of Staff for Air and Space Operations (HQ USAF/XO).
      Similarly, Air Force Civil Engineer Support Agency (AFCESA) is the manager for civil engineer-
      ing issues in the Air Force.
      5.11.17.8. Coordinate all recommendations with their proposed action agencies. Safety investiga-
      tors must ensure they have correctly identified all OPRs and OCRs by making positive contact
      with each of them (call or email them) prior to publishing the formal report and/or final message.
      If circumstances prevent making positive contact with all action agencies, coordinate with the
      convening authority safety office to ensure proper action agencies have been identified.

5.12. Determining and Documenting Other Findings and Recommendations of Significance (OFS,
ORS). Guidance for developing and documenting primary findings and recommendations applies simi-
larly to OFSs and ORSs.
AFI91-204_ACCSUP_I 16 NOVEMBER 2007                                                                        53


   5.12.1. Other Findings of Significance (OFS) are findings that the safety investigators believe could
   contribute to future mishaps and/or which warrant command attention, but were not part of the mishap
   sequence. OFS should be listed following the mishap recommendations in message and formal
   reports.
   5.12.2. Other Recommendations of Significance (ORS) are recommendations resulting from OFS.
   Each OFS will be followed by its corresponding ORS. Assign an OPR(s) to each ORS.

5.13. Releasing Investigative Information. It is Air Force policy to keep the public informed of Air
Force mishaps and safety investigations and to release non-privileged information, both favorable and
unfavorable. Air Force policy complies with the requirements of Title 10, United States Code, Section
2254(b) regarding the public disclosure of certain non-privileged aircraft accident investigation informa-
tion. The SIB president is the final point of release for all information (including electronic/digital media,
photographs, etc) from the SIB, but will not communicate directly with the media or other members of the
public. The release of non-privileged information to news media, relatives, and other agencies is through
the AIB president, Survivor Assistance Program point of contact, Family Liaison Officer, or Public
Affairs representative as appropriate.
   5.13.1. The convening authority or designated information officer releases factual information about
   a mishap, including photographs, only as directed in AFPD 35-1, Public Affairs Management, and
   AFI 51-503. Federal statute does not permit officials involved in the safety investigation to be the offi-
   cials releasing the information to the media or other members of the public.
   5.13.2. The AIB, in accordance with AFI 51-503, can release factual mishap information upon
   request. If an AIB is not formed, the local commander, through the public affairs or legal office, will
   release factual information. Information will not be released if it will jeopardize national defense,
   impede an ongoing or pending investigation (including the SIB or AIB), or if it is privileged safety
   information. The SIB president will coordinate with the AIB president as to whether the release of
   information will impede the SIB’s investigation.
   5.13.3. Following mishaps where AFI 51-503 does not apply (nuclear, explosives and chemical
   agents, directed energy, afloat, motor vehicle, off-duty, ground and industrial) the convening authority
   through the public affairs or legal office may release factual information. Information will not be
   released if it will jeopardize national defense, impede an ongoing or pending investigation (including
   the SIB or legal investigation) or if it is privileged safety information. The SIB president will coordi-
   nate with the legal board president as to whether the release of information will impede the SIB’s
   investigation.

5.14. Coordinating with the Legal Board.
   5.14.1. The SIB president provides Part 1 of the formal report and certain factual information to the
   legal board president as soon as possible (prior to completion of the investigation). See discipline spe-
   cific safety manual for further guidance.
       5.14.1.1. Examples of information given to the legal board president include (this list contains
       examples only); a list of witnesses, cockpit and tower audio recordings, data recorders, coroner’s
       report, autopsy report, toxicology test results, police reports, personnel and medical records.
   5.14.2. Persons occupying full-time safety positions routinely examine privileged documents. They
   are not permitted to serve on legal investigations as long as they are performing full-time safety
54                                                      AFI91-204_ACCSUP_I 16 NOVEMBER 2007


     duties. Legal investigators will not attend SIB/SIO proceedings, or meetings, or have access to or dis-
     cuss any Part 2 privileged information with the SIB/SIO or Air Force safety officials. This prohibition
     also applies to the briefing given to the convening authority on the safety investigation results.
     5.14.3. ISB/SIB/SIO members will not be witnesses for other boards investigating the same mishap
     except to provide Part 1 factual information or to provide purely factual information within their
     knowledge that is not otherwise available.
     5.14.4. ISB/SIB/SIO members and technical advisors will not act as investigators or technical advi-
     sors for a legal investigation of the same mishap.

                                     REPORTS AND BRIEFINGS

6.1. General Information. Safety reports include message reports (preliminary, status, and final), for-
mal reports, and injury and occupational illness forms and logs. Whenever possible safety reporting will
be via the Air Force Safety Automated System (AFSAS). Use the following URL for AFSAS:
https://sas.kirtland.af.mil/. If AFSAS is not available, safety reporting will be via DMS IAW the disci-
pline specific safety manual (AFMAN 91-22X). The type of safety report required and the timeline to
report mishaps and brief the convening authority (if a briefing is required) is in Table 6.2. Briefing inves-
tigation results is covered in paragraph 6.4. The convening authority will determine what investigations
can be briefed to the NAF/CC and COMAFFOR (paragraph 6.4.1.) and what investigations will be
briefed to the convening authority. Aviation mishaps involving fatalities or other mishaps when requested,
require a briefing to the CSAF and SECAF. HQ AF/SEI will be the focal point for scheduling all briefings
to the CSAF and SECAF. If a final message or formal report needs to be changed after it is completed, all
primary SIB members must reconvene as only the primary SIB members are authorized to change the
report. The discipline specific safety manuals (AFMAN 91-22X) provide guidance on primary SIB mem-
bers.
   6.1.1. Report classified mishap information (the classified portion of safety reports) via DMS. Report
   the unclassified portion of the report into AFSAS with classified data masked.
   6.1.2. The mishap event number is vital to tracking safety reports and serves as the single common
   worldwide identifier. The mishap event number and the mishap’s AFSAS number (if mishap is
   reported via AFSAS) will be included on all safety reports and referred to in all related correspon-
   dence, and DRs. Consult the discipline specific safety manual (AFMAN 91-22X) for guidance on
   determining the mishap event number.
   6.1.2. (ACC) Detachments and geographically separated units will receive their aircraft mishap con-
   trol numbers from the wing-level safety office they are accountable to (i.e., home unit vs. host unit).
   6.1.3. (Added-ACC) The ACC Form 164, Ground Mishap Report, is an optional form that may be
   used by units to have their groups/squadrons initially report mishaps to the safety office.

6.2. Safety Message Reports. These safety reports are licensed as a part of the "Mishap Message
Reports" group (RCS: HAF-SE(AR)9402). Produce safety messages during declared or war emergency
conditions (emergency status code C2) IAW AFI 33-324, The Information Collections and Reports Man-
agement Program; Controlling Internal, Public, and Interagency Air Force Information Collections.
   6.2.1. Guidelines
       6.2.1.1. Messages will be marked with appropriate privileged markings IAW paragraph 3.2.6.
       6.2.1.2. Table 6.2. and the discipline specific safety manual (AFMAN 91-22X) provides message
       reporting requirements.
       6.2.1.3. Message Reports During MINIMIZE. During emergency condition MINIMIZE, send
       only the following messages by electronic transmission:
56                                                       AFI91-204_ACCSUP_I 16 NOVEMBER 2007


            6.2.1.3.1. Preliminary and status messages on nuclear mishaps and safety deficiencies result-
            ing in a significant degradation of nuclear surety or having a serious operational impact (such
            as a possible code compromise).
            6.2.1.3.2. Preliminary and status messages on Class A and B on-duty mishaps.
            6.2.1.3.3. Send all other messages by first-class mail within 7 working days of the established
            timeline until MINIMIZE is canceled. MAJCOMs may consolidate messages from their units
            and subsequently mail them to addressees outside their command within 15 working days.
     6.2.2. Preliminary Message. The first electronically transmitted safety message advising of a
     non-nuclear occurrence is titled Preliminary Message (NOTE: OPREP-3 Reports do not satisfy this
     requirement). Preliminary messages are fully releasable (factual information only).
     6.2.3. Status Messages: Status messages are sent to explain report delays/extensions and relay new
     information discovered since the previous message. Status messages may include investigative con-
     clusions such as what areas are considered to be factors and areas considered unlikely to be factors. If
     the status message is explaining a safety report delay/extension, explain the reason for the delay and
     the expected completion date. Safety investigators may send status messages as they deem necessary.
     Required status messages are listed in Table 6.2. Status messages are normally privileged.
        6.2.3.1. The convening authority’s safety staff will closely follow mishaps that have damage esti-
        mates close to the threshold limits or injuries/occupational illnesses that have the potential for
        improving or worsening.
        6.2.3.2. A status message is required when a mishap class or category changes, e.g., due to
        updated damage cost figures, a subsequent death from mishap injuries, or erroneous initial catego-
        rization.
            6.2.3.2.1. When a mishap classification increases, issue a status message within 1 day.
            6.2.3.2.2. When a mishap classification decreases, issue a status message within 10 days.
     6.2.4. Final Message. This message provides a narrative of the mishap/event sequence, states the mis-
     hap cause, and recommends preventive actions. It contains the investigation, analysis, and conclu-
     sions of the safety investigator. It is written so the reader clearly understands how the findings and
     causes were determined and clearly states the role of the individuals found causal in the mishap
     sequence. Include logic in how the recommendations were chosen as well as OPR/OCRs for the rec-
     ommendations. The message may also include other findings and recommendations of significance,
     which do not relate directly to the causes of the mishap, but can be of value in risk management and
     mishap prevention. The final message is privileged. Complete the investigation and prepare the final
     message within the specified time limits in Table 6.2. The convening authority will release the final
     message after the investigation is complete (paragraph 6.5.). The convening authority may delegate
     this responsibility to the SIB/SIO. DO NOT delay release of the final message for internal command
     staffing.
     6.2.5. (Added-ACC) Telephonic/FAX Reports. The following telephonic/FAX reports are also
     required for ACC units:
        6.2.5.1. (Added-ACC) The owning unit safety office will make a telephonic and/or FAX report
        (FAX DSN 574-8975, commercial (757) 764-8975) NLT four hours after learning of a Class A

       intermediate command safety offices using the same procedures and format. Do not delay the
       report for lack of complete information.
       6.2.5.2. (Added-ACC) The director of wing/base medical services (or the designated representa-
       tive) will make a telephonic report to the ACC Aerospace Medicine Branch (HQ ACC/SGPF)
       within eight hours after learning of a mishap (Attachment 7 (Added), this supplement) for Class
       A aviation mishaps or explosives or missile mishaps involving human factors. Make a report
       directly to HQ ACC/SGPF (DSN 574-1213, commercial (757) 764-1213) during duty hours
       (0800-1700 EST); make the report to HQ ACC/SG Staff Alert Officer through the ACC Com-
       mand Post (DSN 574-1555) during non-duty hours.
       6.2.5.3. (Added-ACC) In addition to the above, the following message reports are required for
       Class A aviation mishaps. The owning unit wing safety staff will assist in the preparation of these
       reports:
          6.2.5.3.1. (Added-ACC) A personal telephonic report to ACC Directorate of Air and Space
          Operations (HQ ACC/A3), ACC Directorate of Logistics (HQ ACC/A4), HQ ACC/SE and the
          owning NAF/DRU commander by the appropriate commander (WG/CC or equivalent) NLT
          one hour after learning of the mishap. Do not delay the report for lack of complete informa-
          tion.
          6.2.5.3.2. (Added-ACC) The HQ ACC Air Operations Squadron (ACC/AOS) safety officer
          will make a telephonic report to HQ ACC/SE within four hours on mishaps involving aircraft
          being ferried under ACC/AOS movement control (AFMAN 91-223, ACC Sup 1).
          6.2.5.3.3. (Added-ACC) HQ ACC/SEF and the owning NAF Safety office will notify their
          respective staff judge advocates upon determination that an aviation mishap might be a Class
          A.
          6.2.5.3.4. (Added-ACC) Class B Aviation Mishaps. The safety office of a mishap unit will
          make a telephonic/fax report to the owning NAF/DRU safety office using the procedures in
          paragraph 6.2.5.1. (Added) above.

6.3. Formal Reports. Formal reports present detailed factual and analytical information about mishaps.
They are made up of Air Force Form 711-series forms and attached exhibits. All forms in the Air Force
Form 711-series are licensed as "Safety Investigation Reports" (RCS: HAF-SE(AR) 9404). Formal
reports will be released during declared or war emergency conditions (emergency status code C2) IAW
AFI 33-324.
   6.3.1. Privileged formal reports contain two parts: Part 1, Factual Information and Releasable Mate-
   rial; and Part 2, Board Conclusions and Non-Releasable Material. There may also be some supple-
   mental information such as Comments Messages for MOFE, the MOFE, and any other significant
   information that was received after the MOFE is released. Part 1 contains factual information that may
   be disclosed outside the Air Force; Part 2 contains privileged safety information and will not be dis-
   closed outside Air Force safety channels. Table 6.1. contains tab designations of Part 1 and Part 2. Tab

     6.3.2. MAJCOMs or HQ AFSC may direct preparation of a formal report for any mishap, even under
     circumstances where this instruction does not specifically require one.
AFI91-204_ACCSUP_I 16 NOVEMBER 2007                                                                        59


   6.3.3. Formal reports will be formatted and assembled IAW with the discipline specific safety manual
   AFMAN 91-22X.
   6.3.4. Distributing the Formal Report
       6.3.4.1. The convening authority will distribute privileged formal reports to those in the Air Force
       with a need to know. Distribute the formal report to addressees as listed in the discipline specific
       safety manual (AFMAN 91-22X). If there is a requirement to brief the convening authority, do not
       distribute the formal report prior to that briefing. Do not provide copies or extracts to agencies out-
       side the Air Force. If an agency outside the Air Force needs a copy of the formal report for mishap
       prevention, corrective actions, or other purpose, notify HQ AFSC/JA by message or telephone
       before sending copies to these organizations.
       6.3.4.2. Do not produce "information only" copies of formal reports.
       6.3.4.3. The SIB president may keep a complete copy of the formal report (for briefing purposes)
       for 60 days. List this copy on the distribution memorandum and return it to the MAJCOM safety
       office for disposition.
       6.3.4.4. Formal reports will be maintained IAW AFMAN 37-123, Management of Records and
       disposed of IAW Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at
       https://webrims.amc.af.mil.

6.4. Briefing Investigation Results. Once the SIB completes the investigation and finalizes the formal
report and the final message, the SIB will provide briefings at the discretion of the convening authority.
All briefings will be given with no prior screening of content. Board independence is critical to the integ-
rity of the SIB process. Historically, SIB independence is a Congressional interest item, periodically
reviewed by GAO and DOD/IG. The convening authority will dictate briefing attendance.
6.4. (ACC) Briefing Investigation Results. The SIB will ensure an electronic copy of the final TAB T,
TAB Y and the final message arrive at HQ ACC/SEF NLT two work days before the briefing to the Com-
mander, Air Combat Command (COMACC).
   6.4.1. When the MAJCOM is the convening authority and with MAJCOM/CC approval, the SIB may
   brief the NAF/CC (or equivalent such as the Air Warfare Center Commander) and the affected
   COMAFFOR for a contingency mishap, for INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY, prior to brief-
   ing the MAJCOM/CC. All other briefings or disclosures of the report content, are prohibited.
   6.4.1. (ACC) All primary SIB members will attend the briefing to COMACC unless waived by HQ
   ACC/SE. The SIB president will indicate to COMACC whether there are any minority positions and
   their subject upon completion of the briefing. The mishap NAF/DRU commander, or representative,
   and wing commander will attend the briefing. Dual projection electronic PowerPoint presentations are
   required. Boards may use videos and exhibits to supplement the PowerPoint briefing.
       6.4.1.1. The NAF/CC (and COMAFFOR) and those invited per this instruction to the informa-
       tional briefing will not direct changes to the SIB report or direct further investigation. The briefing
       must be free from the appearance of undue command influence that advice and directions can
       sometimes create.
       6.4.1.2. Except as noted below, the only personnel authorized to attend the informational NAF/
       CC briefing are the NAF/CC, and with NAF/CC concurrence, the NAF/SE and the mishap wing
       commander. In the case of an ANG mishap, in addition to the above authorized attendees, the
60                                                      AFI91-204_ACCSUP_I 16 NOVEMBER 2007


        Director of the Air National Guard, and the mishap units’s state Adjutant General may attend. In
        the case of an AFRC mishap, in addition to the above authorized attendees, the mishap AFRC
        NAF/CC may attend. For COMAFFOR information briefings, authorized attendees are the
        COMAFFOR, and with COMAFFOR concurrence, the AFFOR/SE, and the mishap air expedi-
        tionary wing commander.
        6.4.1.3. In instances where the convening authority has been delegated, there will be no interme-
        diate or informational briefings prior to briefing the convening authority.
     6.4.2. Safety investigation briefings will be afforded the same protection given the formal report. The
     following format is a guide to building the briefing:
        6.4.2.1. Title Slide. Include mishap type, unit, vehicle or materiel, date, time of occurrence, and
        SIB president.
        6.4.2.2. SIB Composition. Show SIB members as well as technical experts consulted and used at
        the mishap scene.
        6.4.2.3. Overview. In bullet format present the basic circumstances of the mishap and give the
        bottom line cause(s) of the mishap.
        6.4.2.4. Personnel Background. Give a chronological list of assignments for personnel involved
        and their experience. Include skill and training qualifications. List the member’s name on the
        slide. Consider a subjective appraisal of the personnel if appropriate.
        6.4.2.5. Mishap Sequence. Use as many slides as necessary. Map/route segments, vertical view of
        maneuvers, artist’s conceptions, or models can be helpful. Explain what should have happened if
        things had gone right, who was in charge, the rules of engagement and if they were followed,
        where things went wrong and what the involved persons should have done.
        6.4.2.6. Areas Investigated and Determined Not To Be a Factor. Do not dwell on these. A listing
        is usually adequate.
        6.4.2.7. Areas Found To Be Factors in the Mishap. Discuss each in detail in follow-up slides. Be
        sure to discuss training, supervision, discipline, tactics, and weather, as appropriate.
        6.4.2.8. Findings and Causes. Use the number of slides necessary without overcrowding.
        6.4.2.9. Conclusions and Recommendations. Use the number of slides necessary without over-
        crowding.
        6.4.2.10. Other Findings and Recommendations of Significance. Number sequentially. Place
        "Other Finding of Significance One" followed by "Other Recommendation of Significance One."
        6.4.2.11. Comments. Convening authority comments.
        6.4.2.12. Backup slides as determined by the SIB president. May include:
            6.4.2.12.1. 72-Hour and 14-Day Medical History. Be prepared to brief the 72-hour and
            14-day history.
            6.4.2.12.2. Maintenance History on Aircraft or Vehicle. Include significant write-ups, Time
            Compliance Technical Orders (TCTO), and materiel problems.
            6.4.2.12.3. Any other pertinent information that supports the findings, conclusions, and rec-
            ommendations.

NOTES:
1. If the investigation will not be complete (paragraph 6.5.) within the 30-day timeframe, transmit a
   status message on day 30 and every 30 days until the investigation is complete. Include estimated
   date of investigation completion.
2. See discipline specific safety manual (AFMAN 91-22X).
3. Class A and B off-duty military mishaps normally do not require a formal report. See AFMAN
   91-224 for additional guidance.

6.5. Convening Authority Actions. The convening authority has two options upon the completion of an
investigation. The investigation is considered complete when the final message, formal report (if
required), and briefing to the convening authority (if required) are accomplished.
   6.5.1. Accept the report as written and release the final message and formal report (if a formal report
   was required). DO NOT delay release of the final message or formal report for internal command
   staffing.

     6.5.2. Direct the SIB president and its members to conduct additional investigations. The convening
     authority will provide additional guidance to the SIB to ensure the report fulfills the purpose, intent,
     and requirements of the Air Force Mishap Prevention Program.
        6.5.2.1. After the SIB re-examines the areas identified by the convening authority and completes
        their reinvestigation, the convening authority will have the same two options outlined above. Once
        this sequence is completed, the convening authority will release the final message. DO NOT delay
        release of the final message or formal report for internal command staffing.

6.6. Notifying Person(s) Found Causal in Formal Reports. When a formal report mentions a USAF
individual (military member or civilian employee) as causal in the findings, that individual (i.e., causal
individual) will be given an opportunity to submit a witness statement commenting on the findings. This
statement is in addition to any other witness statements or testimony provided by the individual. The
statement is considered privileged safety information and will be handled and protected IAW this instruc-
tion. Use the guidelines below to notify causal individuals and forward their comments:
     6.6.1. Use the memorandum in Figure 6.1. to notify the causal individual(s).
     6.6.2. Once the convening authority accepts the formal report and releases the final message, the con-
     vening authority will send a copy of the memorandum to the mishap unit safety office. Individuals
     must not be notified until after the SIB out briefs the convening authority and the final message is
     released. The mishap unit (wing or equivalent) Chief of Safety will notify the causal individual(s).
     6.6.3. The causal individual(s) may use only the final message to make additional comments. The
     individual(s) will not be allowed access to the formal report. The individual(s) may not remove the
     final message from the safety office nor copy portions of any of the safety reports pertaining to the
     mishap naming that individual causal.
     6.6.4. The individual(s) has 15 days to submit the statement back to the mishap unit (wing or equiva-
     lent) safety office. The individual(s) must submit a statement, though the statement may simply
     acknowledge the opportunity to comment and decline to do so.
     6.6.5. The unit (wing or equivalent) Chief of Safety will forward any statements to the convening
     authority SE and a copy to HQ AFSC for use in preparation of the MOFE.
     6.6.6. If the causal individual is attached or assigned to another MAJCOM, the convening authority
     sends a copy of the final message and the memorandum in Figure 6.1. to the person’s immediate com-
     mander with a cover memorandum. Provide information copies to the individual’s MAJCOM/SE. The
     cover memorandum should caution the commander against taking any disciplinary or other adverse
     action based upon the safety investigation and instruct the commander to:
        6.6.6.1. Notify the person of their opportunity to review relevant findings and to provide a wit-
        ness statement within 15 days.
        6.6.6.2. After obtaining causal individual’s statement forward it HQ AFSC with a copy to the
        convening authority.
     6.6.7. Notifying Non-Air Force Military Personnel and Civilians Outside Air Force Jurisdiction.
     Non-Air Force personnel are not offered the opportunity to review Air Force safety investigation mes-
     sages or formal reports, nor to submit witness statements in these cases. This includes Air Force per-
     sonnel serving outside the Air Force, such as with the Defense Logistics Agency or NATO.
     EXCEPTION: Those Non-Air Force personnel assigned to fly Air Force aircraft and afforded safety

                                                 Chapter 7

                                         FOLLOW-UP ACTIONS

7.1. General Information. Follow-up actions start after the release of the final message. All concerned
agencies and organizations have a continuing responsibility for managing the preventive action process.
Reviewing authorities for safety reports include HQ AFSC, higher levels in the chain of command (e.g.,
NAF/Center and MAJCOM), and action agencies outside the command. For each report, the reviewing
authority is tasked to assess the final message or formal report and determine the adequacy of the overall
safety report, investigation, findings, causes, and recommendations (including OPR/OCR assignments).

7.2. Review Process. Organizations will review the final message or formal report and send their
response (Comments Message for MOFE, Table 6.2.) back to HQ AFSC. The following organizations
review the formal report:
     7.2.1. The convening authority, lead command of the weapons system (AFPD 10-9), and subordinate
     elements specified by the investigating MAJCOM commander.
     7.2.2. Agencies with technical or logistic support responsibility.
     7.2.3. Air Force agencies outside the investigating command if their functions were involved in the
     mishap (e.g., HQ AFFSA/XA for air traffic services and airfield management, DCMA for mishaps
     involving contracts managed by DCMA).
     7.2.4. Each MAJCOM tasked for action in the mishap recommendations. OPRs for recommendations
     may include organizations both within and external to the chain of command of the mishap organiza-
     tion. Air component commanders of unified commands if tasked for action.
     7.2.5. Air component commanders of unified commands when the mishap occurred during contin-
     gency operations. NOTE: The unified command staff offices must agree to safeguard the information
     according to rules contained in this instruction.
     7.2.6. If during the review process the convening authority or higher authority learns facts that were
     not available to safety investigators or that shed new light on the published findings, causes, and rec-
     ommendations, he or she may do one of the following:
        7.2.6.1. Reopen the safety investigation.
        7.2.6.2. Include the new facts in the Comments Message for MOFE (Table 6.2.).
        7.2.6.3. Amend the final message with a status report if there is no formal report.
     7.2.7. Commanders at each level must take preventive actions within their areas of responsibility. If
     an investigation is inadequate or poorly documented, the convening authority may return the report
     for additional work.
     7.2.8. (Added-ACC) ACC Formal Report Review Process: HQ ACC/SE will send TAB T and TAB
     Y to the appropriate staff agencies upon completion of the COMACC briefing. All safety-privileged
     files will be password protected when emailed to outside of the Langley local area network. The nor-
     mal “bottomline” suspense for each agency to evaluate and provide comments on the TAB T/TAB Y
     is five working days following the briefing. Providing comment at this time does not preclude agen-
AFI91-204_ACCSUP_I 16 NOVEMBER 2007                                                                   65


   cies from commenting further upon receipt of AF Safety Center's request for comments and endorse-
   ments.
       7.2.8.1. (Added-ACC) Each agency tasked to review a formal report evaluates and comments on
       findings, causes, recommendations, and other findings and recommendations of significance.
       Refer to AFI 91-204, Chapter 5 for definitions and Chapter 6 for the review process.
       7.2.8.2. (Added-ACC) Comments on the board’s findings, causes and recommendations will be
       from one of the following three categories:
          7.2.8.2.1. (Added-ACC) Concur: Accept the finding/recommendation as written. Annotate
          as a "concur with comment" if comments are added but do not change the intent of the SIB
          finding/recommendation. Comments may be added to annotate (but are not limited to) actions
          already taken, presenting information that was not available to the investigation board and
          information that clarifies the directorate's position during the staffing process.
          7.2.8.2.2. (Added-ACC) Concur in part: A portion of a finding or recommendation should be
          reworded or deleted. Causal findings are in this category when the staff concurs with the find-
          ing but does not consider it causal. List the reworded finding/recommendation and give ratio-
          nale. Use concur in part to correct OPR/OCR assignments.
          7.2.8.2.3. (Added-ACC) Non-concur: Indicates that a finding/recommendation should be
          deleted or completely reworded. The ACC staff may suggest the rewording or the addition of
          a finding and/or recommendation. Summarize the scenario you consider most probable if dele-
          tion of a finding significantly alters the mishap sequence logic.

7.3. Memorandum of Final Evaluation (MOFE). At the completion of the review process, HQ AFSC
will publish the MOFE. HQ AFSC prepares a MOFE on each formal report regardless of mishap class. A
MOFE will also be prepared for Class A and B final message reports when the formal report is waived.
Exceptions to this are detailed in discipline specific safety manuals.
   7.3.1. HQ AFSC will consider inputs from the following in preparation of the MOFE:
       7.3.1.1. Convening authority.
       7.3.1.2. Lead command of weapons system (AFPD 10-9).
       7.3.1.3. Designated action agencies.
       7.3.1.4. Commander of the mishap wing.
       7.3.1.5. Statements of person(s) found causal in the formal report.
       7.3.1.6. Unsolicited comments. Agencies and organizations reviewing the final message report
       may comment on the investigation, findings, causes, and recommendations even though they are
       neither in the chain of command nor a designated action agency.
   7.3.2. The MOFE is prepared by HQ AFSC and is an evaluation of the formal report/final message,
   the reviews and comments provided by the convening MAJCOM and all other inputs as listed in para-
   graph 7.3.1. The MOFE may make changes to the findings, causes, and recommendations (including
   OPR/OCR assignments).
       7.3.2.1. If the MOFE adds a person to a causal finding or significantly changes a person’s role in
       the findings, HQ AFSC will notify the individual’s MAJCOM and unit safety office and will pro-
66                                                      AFI91-204_ACCSUP_I 16 NOVEMBER 2007


        vide the individual an opportunity to submit a witness statement, following the procedures in para-
        graph 6.6.
     7.3.3. HQ USAF/SE will transmit the MOFE to all final message report recipients. When transmitted,
     the MOFE becomes the official Air Force position on findings, causes, and recommendations.

7.4. Managing Recommendations Validated through the MOFE.
     7.4.1. HQ USAF/SE validates recommendations in the MOFE. Once recommendations are validated
     and assigned in the MOFE, they become a part of the system of record keeping mandated by public
     law and required of each service by DODI 6055.7.
     7.4.2. Recommendations are assigned to action agencies and given suspense dates. The suspense date
     is the date action agencies must report on completed actions or on progress toward completed actions.
     The action agency will give any identifying data to HQ AFSC to monitor progress of actions (para-
     graph 7.4.5.).
     7.4.3. HQ AFSC manages the disposition of each open recommendation until final action is com-
     pleted. Agencies and organizations that decline to take action on SIB or HQ USAF/SE recommenda-
     tions will provide detailed rationale to HQ AFSC. AFSAS users may track open recommendations
     and input rationale and/or status reports directly into the system. HQ USAF/SE will determine
     whether to close the recommendation or leave it open for future action. If the recommendation is left
     open, HQ USAF/SE will provide feedback to the applicable OPRs.
     7.4.4. The following are examples of acceptable updates toward closing actions:
        7.4.4.1. Actions planned or taken.
        7.4.4.2. Results of development or testing.
        7.4.4.3. Significant problems encountered.
        7.4.4.4. Delays experienced.
        7.4.4.5. Rationale for decision made, to include details of supporting risk analysis.
        7.4.4.6. Concurrence and non-concurrence by other agencies.
     7.4.5. The following examples are acceptable closing actions:
        7.4.5.1. Recommended changes to all applicable publications were issued.
        7.4.5.2. Recommended modifications to all applicable systems or items were completed.
        7.4.5.3. Recommended studies or evaluations were completed, conclusions were validated, and
        actions on all validated requirements were completed. In these cases, the OPR shall include
        detailed rationale, to include a risk analysis, to support their conclusions.
        7.4.5.4. Recommended actions were determined not feasible due to cost, operational constraints,
        or programmed removal of the system or item from service.
     7.4.6. Follow Up Actions for Publication Recommendations. MAJCOM/SE will brief and advocate
     for SIB recommendations at the flight manual and technical order review boards. For Class A and B
     mishaps, if recommended changes are disapproved by the flight manual or technical order review
     boards, MAJCOM/SE will ensure the appropriate directorate (DO/LG) is aware of the disapproval
AFI91-204_ACCSUP_I 16 NOVEMBER 2007                                                                       67


   and concurs with the review board’s action. Forward copies of completed changes to AFSC/SEFM for
   AF/SE review.
   7.4.7. MAJCOM/DRU/FOA/ANG will establish a Mishap Review Panel (MRP) or equivalent pro-
   cess (e.g., Materiel Safety Task Group or System Safety Group) for all safety disciplines to ensure
   mishap recommendations are methodically addressed. The MRP or similar process will meet once
   every six months. A consolidated recommendation status report is due to HQ AFSC on 15 Nov and 15
   May every year. The report will be compiled using data as of 30 Sep and 30 Mar each year (end of FY
   and end of second quarter). This report will cover all disciplines. This report is a way of ensuring these
   responsibilities are completed. It also advises all parties of the status of open recommendations.
       7.4.7.1. (Added-ACC) Aircraft Class C and below mishap report recommendations will be
       tracked at the unit level. Semiannually report status of open recommendations to NAF flight safety
       office who in turn will provide a report, with the U.S. Air Force Warfare Center (USAFWC), by
       mission design series of open recommendations to HQ ACC/SEF by January 15th and July 15th of
       each year. Recommendations from Class A and B aircraft mishap reports will be tracked by ACC/
       SEF to closure.
       7.4.7.2. (Added-ACC) Missile and explosive mishap report recommendations will be tracked at
       the unit level. Report status of open Class A and B recommendations to HQ ACC/SEW NLT Jan-
       uary 15th and July 15th of each year and immediately upon closure; report status of Class C and D
       and HAP reports NLT March 31st and September 30th of each year and immediately upon clo-
       sure.
       7.4.7.3. (Added-ACC) All Ground mishap report recommendations will be tracked at the unit
       level. Report status of recommendations until closure through the appropriate NAF to HQ ACC/
       SEG NLT the fifth day of the beginning of each quarter (Jan, Apr, Jul and Oct).

7.5. Managing All Other Recommendations. HQ AFSC does not normally prepare a MOFE for Class
C and D mishaps without a formal report, and Class E events. MAJCOMs will establish an internal pro-
gram to effectively manage final disposition of recommendations and ORSs resulting from these mishaps
and events. Class A and B ORSs will be managed IAW the discipline specific safety manual (AFMAN
91-22X). MAJCOM/SEs should notify HQ USAF/SE of Class C, D, and E recommendations/ORSs that
have broad applicability. After evaluation and concurrence, HQ AFSC will manage these broad recom-
mendation/ORSs for final disposition.
7.5. (ACC) Managing All Other Recommendations Each wing/DRU safety office will track their own
aircraft Class Cs, HAPs and Hazardous Air Traffic Reports through closure, to include the status of any
AFTO Forms 22, Technical Manual Change Recommendation and Reply, AF Form 847 or deficiency
report. Closure occurs when all recommendations from the subject mishap are closed (this includes rec-
ommendations with a local OPR and those recommendations with OPRs outside local channels).

GROUND AND INDUSTRIAL MISHAP—An Air Force mishap that occurs to on-duty DoD civilian
and on- or off-duty DoD military personnel and does not meet the mishap category definition of nuclear,
space, aviation, guided missile, explosives and chemical agents, directed energy, afloat, or motor vehicle
as defined by this instruction. NOTE: A mishap involving both on- and off-duty military personnel is
considered to be an on-duty mishap. This category also includes old ground mishaps categories such as
80                                                      AFI91-204_ACCSUP_I 16 NOVEMBER 2007

have been replaced with questions in AFSAS.
GROUND MISHAP—For the purposes of this instruction, a mishap that falls into one of the following
mishap categories: afloat, motor vehicle, or ground and industrial. NOTE: A ground mishap may involve
materiel/equipment that is not traditionally thought of as happening on the ground (e.g., an off-duty
military person flying a private plane). Former category Off-Duty Military and sub-categories of fire,
combat training, physical and athletic conditioning, contractor, and natural phenomena have been
replaced with questions in AFSAS. Damage to public or private property or injury or illness to none-DOD
personnel caused by DOD operations are ground mishaps.
INDUSTRIAL AVIATION MISHAP—Delete
INDUSTRIAL MISHAP—A ground and industrial mishap that occurs in the work environment that
does not meet the mishap subcategory definition of sport and recreational or miscellaneous as defined by
this instruction. Also includes categories fire, combat training, physical and Athletic Conditioning,
Contractor, and Natural Phenomena. (The work environment, as defined in 29 Code of Federal
Regulations 1960, is “The establishment and other locations where one or more Air Force employees are
working or are present as a condition of their employment; this would include those areas or locations
where persons are TDY for training purposes. The work environment includes not only physical
locations, but also the equipment or materials used by the employee during the course of his or her work).
INDUSTRIAL SPACE MISHAP—Deleted.
INDUSTRIAL WEAPONS MISHAP—Deleted.
LOST TIME CASE—(Class C)—Any injury or occupational illness or disease that causes loss of one or
more days away from work beyond the day or shift it occurred. When determining if the mishap is a Lost
Time Case, you must count the number of days the employee was unable to work as a result of the injury
or illness, regardless of whether or not the person was scheduled to work on those days. Weekend days,
holidays, vacation days, or other days off are included in the total number of day’s loss, if the employee
would not have been able to work on those days. Don’t count the day of the injury/illness or the day the
individual returns to work. NOTE: Occurrences that result from voluntary participation in wellness and
fitness programs, or recreational activities such as exercise class, racquetball, or baseball or injuries or
illnesses resulting from an employee eating, drinking, or preparing food for personnel consumption will
be reported to comply with Department of Defense mandates.
MISCELLANEOUS MISHAP—A ground and industrial mishap that is on- or off-duty and does not fit
into the industrial or sport and recreational subcategory. Also included in this subcategory are reportable
mishaps occurring while using a commercial carrier such as a commercial bus, airplane, or taxicab.
MISHAP—A mishap is an unplanned occurrence, or series of occurrences, that results in damage or
injury and meets Class A, B, C, D and E mishap reporting criteria IAW paragraph 1.8. Damage or injury

prepared for or for which all reasonable preparations had been taken. Do not report incidents that are
AFI91-204_ACCSUP_I 16 NOVEMBER 2007                                                                        81


natural phenomena related where adequate preparation, forecasting, and communication actions were
taken and there were no injuries. However, report military and civilian injuries resulting from these
mishaps as ground and industrial mishaps. NOTE. Natural phenomena mishaps are categorized as
industrial mishaps.
NO LOST TIME CASE—(Class D)— Any injury or occupational illness or disease that restricts work
activities and does not meet the definition of Lost Time. These are cases where, because of injury or
occupational illness or disease, Air Force personnel only work partial days, restricted work or were
transferred to another job, required medical treatment greater than first aid, loss of consciousness, or a
significant injury or illness/disease diagnosed by a physician or other licensed health care professional,
even if it does not result in death, days away from work, restricted work or job transfer, medical treatment
greater then first aid, or loss of consciousness. NOTE: Occurrences that result from voluntary
participation in wellness and fitness programs, or recreational activities such as exercise class,
racquetball, or baseball or injuries or illnesses resulting from an employee eating, drinking, or preparing
food for personnel consumption will be reported to comply with Department of Defense mandates.
NONFATAL CASES WITHOUT LOST WORKDAYS—These are cases other than lost workday

job, required medical treatment greater than first aid, lost consciousness, or were diagnosed as having an
occupational illness.
OFF-DUTY MILITARY RELATED—A fatality or injury to off-duty DOD military personnel whether
or not on a DOD installation, excluding private motor vehicle (PMV) mishaps. NOTE: A mishap
involving on- and off-duty military personnel in the same mishap will be categorized as an on-duty
mishap.
ON-DUTY—DOD personnel are on-duty when: Physically present at any location where they are to
perform their officially assigned work. Officially assigned work includes organization-sponsored events
an employee is permitted to attend, regardless of location. This includes those activities incident to normal
work activities that occur on DOD installations, such as lunch, coffee, or rest breaks, and all activities
aboard military vessels. NOTE: Personnel walking to and from work place parking areas at the start and
end of the duty day are in an on-duty status. Personnel who eat lunch and then deviate from normal lunch
activities (example shopping) are considered off-duty.

temporary assignment. Essential or incidental activities include travel between places of business or lodg-
ing and eating establishments, drugstores, barbershops, places of worship, cleaning establishments, bowl-
ing centers, officer and enlisted clubs, gymnasiums, and similar on-base non-appropriated fund (NAF)
facilities and similar places required for the health or comfort of the member, are considered on-duty.
However, when personnel deviate from the normal incidents of the trip and become involved in activities,
personal or otherwise, that are not reasonably incidental to the duties of the temporary assignment con-
templated by the employer, the person ceases to be considered on-duty for investigation and reporting
purposes of injuries or occupational illnesses. Injuries or occupational illnesses to personnel resulting
82                                                       AFI91-204_ACCSUP_I 16 NOVEMBER 2007

ation activities (e.g. jogging, golfing, basketball) will be reported as off-duty mishaps.
Taking part in compulsory physical fitness training, sporting events, and physical fitness evaluation activ-
ities (including cycle ergometric testing when permitted). On-duty compulsory fitness training and activ-
ities include directed sports activities at professional military education (PME) and formal training
courses such as Basic Military Training, Technical Training Schools, Airman Leadership School, Squad-
ron Officer School, and the Air Force Academy. These activities are considered on-duty when a superior
directs participation at a specific location and time. This includes supervision directed physical condition-
ing activities when a mandatory location and time are designated. Air Force civilian employees autho-
rized to participate in physical fitness activities during normal duty hours are also on-duty.

result in death or permanent total disability, but in the opinion of competent medical authority, results in
permanent impairment through loss or loss of use of any part of the body. EXCEPTIONS: Loss of teeth,
fingernails, toenails; loss of fingertips or toe tips without bone involvement; repairable inguinal hernia;
disfigurement; sprains or strains that do not cause permanent limitation of motion.
PERMANENT TOTAL DISABILITY—(Class A) Any nonfatal injury or occupational illness that, in
the opinion of competent medical authority, permanently and totally incapacitates a person to the extent
that he or she cannot follow any gainful occupation and results in a medical discharge, retirement,
separation. The loss, or the loss of use of both hands, both feet, both eyes, or a combination of any of those
body parts as a result of a single mishap will be considered as a permanent total disability. For purposes of
this instruction, any mishap resulting in injury severe enough for an individual to be in a non-medically
induced coma is a permanent total disability. (NOTE: Upgrade injury to a fatal mishap if death occurs
within 30 days of medical discharge, retirement, or separation from service due to complications arising
from the mishap injury).

     recordings, and staged photographs) for use outside the proceedings of this board. You may not
     have a copy of Part 2 of the Board’s final report or any part of a draft thereof. You must report to
     me (or, after the SIB is dissolved, to HQ Air Force Safety Center) any attempt by anyone, other
     than a SIB member or other duly authorized person, to obtain any confidential or deliberative
     information from you about this investigation.
     4. Before beginning your service to this SIB, please sign and date the endorsement below. I will
     give you a copy of this memorandum.
                                                                        (SIB President’s signature block)

             IC 2006-1 TO AFI 91-204, SAFETY INVESTIGATIONS AND REPORTS


14 FEBRUARY 2006
SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This change incorporates Interim Change 2006-1 and reflects DoDI 6055.7 guidance regarding mishap
categories. It also provides additional information on how to classify and record injuries. It provides addi-
tional guidance for compliance with the Privacy Act of 1974 and handling of privileged information. It
updates Table 6.2. Reporting and Briefing Schedule, and updates the use of some AF Forms. Finally, it
clarifies the definitions of some terms in Attachment 1. The entire text of the IC is at the last attachment.
A bar ( | ) indicates a revision from the previous edition.
1.1.2. Legal investigations provide a publicly releasable report of the facts and circumstances surrounding
a mishap. Legal investigations may include a statement of opinion on the cause of the accident, gather and
preserve evidence for claims, litigation, disciplinary and adverse administrative actions, and for all other
purposes. An Accident Investigation Board (AIB) is one type of legal investigation and is convened for
many space, aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), and missile mishaps IAW AFI 51-503, Aerospace
Accident Investigations. A Commander Directed Investigation (CDI) is another type of legal investigation
that may be convened for mishaps.
1.5. Accounting for Losses. The Air Force records each mishap to the command (MAJCOM) that expe-
rienced the loss of an owned asset (personnel or property). For statistical purposes, the occurrence is
recorded as a mishap in that command (or in the Air Force at large, when applicable) regardless of any
determination as to the responsibility for the mishap. Generally, the mishap is recorded in the command
that has investigative responsibility for the mishap (Chapter 4). Mishap accounting in no way implies
blame or mishap responsibility. NOTE: For purposes of this instruction, the term "MAJCOM" includes
ANG, DRUs, and FOAs.
1.6. Mishap Categories. The Air Force categorizes mishaps based upon the materiel involved (e.g., space
systems, weapons, aircraft, motor vehicles, person, etc.) and the state of the involved materiel (e.g.,
launch, orbit, existence of intent for flight, on- or off-duty, etc.) when the mishap occurs. Mishap catego-
ries and subcategories are defined below and diagramed in Figure 1.1. For the purposes of reporting and
data collection, select the one category and subcategory that best defines the mishap under investigation.
Normally mishaps involve only one category and subcategory, see paragraph 1.6.3.
1.6.1.3.3. Aircraft Ground Operations Mishap. A mishap involving DoD aircraft, with an aircrew member
on board, that occurs between engine start/shutdown and prior to/following intent for flight that results in
reportable property damage or any injury or fatality. Damage to a missile prior to the completion of weap-
ons upload procedures, or after initiation of weapons download procedures is a Missile mishap. Note: The
three key factors required to meet the AGO category are: Aircrew member on board, Engines running,
and intention to become airborne at some point.

1.6.1.10. Ground and Industrial. An Air Force mishap that occurs to on-duty DoD civilian and on- or
off-duty DoD military personnel and does not meet the mishap category definition of nuclear, space, avi-
ation, guided missile, explosives and chemical agents, directed energy, afloat, or motor vehicle as defined
by this instruction. NOTE: A mishap involving both on- and off-duty military personnel is categorized as
an on-duty mishap. This category also includes old ground mishaps categories such as fire, combat train-
ing, physical and Athletic Conditioning, contractor, and Natural Phenomena. These have been replaced
with questions in AFSAS.

1.6.1.10.2. Deleted.
1.6.1.10.3. Sports and Recreational. Mishaps involving injuries that occur during participation in some
form of recreational or athletic activities whether on- or off-duty. The activity may be for leisure,
designed to develop an Air Force member’s physical ability or to maintain or increase individual/collec-
tive combat and/or peacekeeping skills (see Training Related Death, Attachment 1).

1.6.1.10.9. Industrial. A ground and industrial mishap that occurs in the work environment that does not
meet the mishap subcategory definition of sport and recreational or miscellaneous as defined by this
instruction. This also include categories for fire, combat training, physical and Athletic Conditioning,
Contractor, and Natural Phenomena. (The work environment, as defined in 29 Code of Federal Regula-
tions 1960, is “The establishment and other locations where one or more Air Force employees are work-
ing or are present as a condition of their employment; this would include those areas or locations where
persons are TDY for training purposes. The work environment includes not only physical locations, but
also the equipment or materials used by the employee during the course of his or her work).
1.6.1.10.10. Miscellaneous. On- or off-duty mishaps that do not fit into the industrial, sports and recre-
ational subcategory. Also included in this subcategory are reportable mishaps occurring while using a
commercial carrier such as a commercial bus, airplane, or taxicab.

1.8.3.2. Any injury or occupational illness or disease that causes loss of one or more days away from work
beyond the day or shift it occurred. When determining if the mishap is a Lost Time Case, you must count
the number of days the employee was unable to work as a result of the injury or illness, regardless of
whether or not the person was scheduled to work on those days. Weekend days, holidays, vacation days,
or other days off are included in the total number of days, if the employee would not have been able to
work on those days. NOTE: Occurrences that result from voluntary participation in wellness and fitness
programs, or recreational activities such as exercise class, racquetball, or baseball or injuries or illnesses
resulting from an employee eating, drinking, or preparing food for personnel consumption will be
reported as on or off-duty mishaps to comply with DODI 6055.7 Department of Defense mandates.
1.8.4. Class D Mishap. Class D Mishap. Any nonfatal injury or occupational illness that does not meet the
definition of Lost Time. These are cases where, because of injury or occupational illness, Air Force per-
sonnel only works partial days, restricted work or were transferred to another job, required medical treat-
ment greater than first aid, lost of consciousness, or a significant injury or illness diagnosed by a physician
or other licensed health care professional, even if it does not result in death, days away from work,
restricted work or job transfer, medical treatment greater then first aid, or loss of consciousness. NOTE:
Occurrences that result from voluntary participation in wellness and fitness programs, or recreational
activities such as exercise class, racquetball, or baseball or injuries or illnesses resulting from an

1.9.1.1.1. Material Cost. If an item is repairable locally by unit personnel, calculate the cost of the materi-
als used to repair the item. When determining the cost of Class I ODS use the value of $100.00 per pound
for the inadvertent release of Class I ODSs.
1.10. Mishap Injury and Occupational Illnesses. Report the type of person (1.10.1.) and the severity of
injury/occupational illness (1.10.2.).
1.11. Recording Injuries and Occupational Illnesses. Use the OSHA Form 300, Log of Work-Related
Injuries and Illnesses, for recording injuries and occupational illnesses to civilian and military personnel
meeting Class A, B, C, or D criteria. See AFMAN 91-224, Chapter 6, for specific guidance. Note. Use
separate logs (OSHA 301) to record military and civilian personnel. Contractor personnel who are super-
vised on a daily basis by Air Force personnel may be required to record their own injuries/illness.
3.2.1.5. Any Life Science Materiel, including photographs with markings or other indicators that contain
analysis by a safety investigator. For example, 72-hour histories, 14-day histories, and interview narra-
tives obtained during the post-mishap physical examination.
3.2.4. Privileged Safety Information and Safety Reports. Safety reports are for official use only (FOUO)
if they are not classified. However, not each document in the report is FOUO. The factual documents in
Part 1 of formal safety reports are not considered FOUO by this AFI, and should not be marked as such.
96                                                      AFI91-204_ACCSUP_I 16 NOVEMBER 2007


However, documents from other sources included in Part 1 may already be marked FOUO. Only the OPR
for the document may remove FOUO markings.
3.2.5.4. Persons Authorized to Make Promises of Confidentiality. Only members of a designated ISB/SIB
(or a SIO) may offer promises of confidentiality and only during safety investigations where promises of
confidentiality are authorized. When conducting safety investigations in which promises of confidential-
ity are authorized, the safety investigators have the discretion to decide who will be offered a promise of
confidentiality. The investigators’ decision should be based upon a witness or contractor’s reluctance to
cooperate, involvement in the mishap sequence, or apparent self-interest in not disclosing information.
Promises of confidentiality will only be given as needed to ensure forthright cooperation of the witness
and may not be given on a blanket basis to all witnesses.
3.3.1. Sanitizing Privileged Safety Reports. Sanitizing reports or extracts from reports means obscuring
the relationship between the identity of a mishap and the findings, conclusions, causes, recommendations,
deliberative processes resulting from the investigation, and statements made under a promise of confiden-
tiality. Wing safety officers or their designated representatives (that are properly trained) may sanitize
privileged safety reports and other media for unit use and for use by authorized contractor personnel.
Some mishaps, because of widespread publicity or unique circumstances, cannot be fully sanitized. When
a report is sanitized, the findings, causes, recommendation, conclusions, or opinions of the investigation
are no longer privileged. (Note: Sanitized reports are not necessarily releasable to the public since they
may still contain information protected by the Privacy Act, Arms Export Control Act, or Export Admin-
istration Act. Ensure sanitized reports are appropriately labeled.) Sanitizing a report involves separating
the following identifying information from related safety investigator findings, causes, recommendations,
conclusions, or opinions:
3.3.1.6. Do not release statements or contractor reports obtained with a promise of confidentiality.
3.3.2. Limiting Use or Release within the Air Force. Safety officers and their staffs, duly appointed safety
investigators, AFSC personnel and AF/SE and his staff, are authorized access to and use of privileged
safety information based on their safety duties. Other Air Force officials, when their duties include mis-
hap prevention and when it is necessary to develop, take, or review preventive actions, may obtain access
to privileged safety information. See paragraphs 3.2.2., 3.2.3., and 3.3. MAJCOM, NAF/Center or unit
Chiefs of Safety are authorized, when sanitized information is inadequate, to provide privileged safety
information as lessons learned to Air Force members on a need-to-know basis and solely for mishap pre-
vention. They will ensure members are instructed on properly protecting information and their responsi-
bilities to prevent further, unauthorized release. Lessons learned will not include confidential statements
or contractor reports.
3.3.2.1. AF/SE; AFSC/CD and division chiefs; MAJCOM, NAF/Center or unit Chiefs of Safety; SIB
presidents or SIOs; are authorized to disclose privileged safety information to AF officials as described in
3.3.2.
3.3.2.4. Deleted.
3.3.3. Limiting Release Outside the Air Force. In certain cases, the Air Force has agreed to exchange priv-
ileged safety information with other DOD agencies solely for mishap prevention purposes. Also, the Air
Force shares certain mishap prevention information with other entities in the interests of the general safety
community. See paragraphs 3.2.2., 3.2.3., and 3.3.
3.3.3.3. Historical Safety Reports. HQ USAF/SE/SED may release the findings of a Safety Board, con-
tained in historical safety reports prepared IAW DODI 6055.7 (or its predecessors), provided no national
AFI91-204_ACCSUP_I 16 NOVEMBER 2007                                                                        97


defense or safety interest exists. For the purpose of this provision, historical reports shall be defined as
those concerning mishaps more than 25 years old. (Note: Safety Reports on pre-1956 mishaps are not
protected by the safety privilege and are stored at the Air Force Historical Research Agency, Maxwell
AFB.)
3.3.3.5. Limiting Release to Contractors. Contractors may need access to privileged safety information
when they are performing an Air Force function involving mishap prevention. Contractors may also need
access to privileged safety information if they designed, built, maintained or operated Air Force weapon
systems, their components, or other Air Force equipment, in order to correct defects or other problems
and help prevent future mishaps. When contractors need access to privileged safety information, the
appropriate memorandum in Figure A3.6. or Figure A3.7. must be used and kept on file with the individ-
ual authorizing access to the information. Access will be limited to what is needed to prevent future mis-
haps. Contractors will not release the information outside contractor safety channels; for example,
privileged safety information will not be released to the general counsel’s office or public relations per-
sonnel. The number of contractor employees who have access to the information shall be strictly limited
to only those individuals who have a need to know the information in order to enhance the safety of the
Air Force weapon systems. After a project is complete, contractors will not maintain the information in
their files. Contractors must understand and agree to their responsibilities to treat such information as con-
fidential. See paragraphs 3.2.2., 3.2.3., and 3.3.
3.3.3.5.1. Contractors who built, designed, or maintained equipment involved in mishaps send representa-
tives to support Air Force SIBs at the request of the Air Force. SIB presidents and safety investigators will
ensure those representatives understand that the Air Force may, at the contractor’s request, extend a claim
of privilege over documents provided by the contractor representatives to the SIB when the Air Force
maintains sole possession or control. A claim of privilege may not be sustained over notes, documents,
and other matter produced during the SIB investigation by the contractor but retained by the contractor
representatives. SIB presidents grant these contractors access to privileged safety information only if it is
essential to assist the SIB.
3.3.3.5.2. Contractors providing weapon system maintenance support are performing an Air Force func-
tion. Advise them that disclosure of privileged safety information is necessary for fulfillment of contrac-
tual obligations. The wing chief of safety, MAJCOM/SE, or HQ AFSC may provide the contractors safety
information for this function.
3.3.3.5.5. Contractors who instruct safety programs in mishap investigation or safety program manage-
ment contracted by the Air Force or ARC require access to privileged safety information. The wing chief
of safety, MAJCOM/SE, or HQ AFSC may provide the contractors safety reports for this function.
3.3.3.5.6. Contractors who build, design, maintain, or operate Air Force weapon systems, their compo-
nents, or other Air Force equipment may need privileged safety information to correct defects or other
problems and prevent future mishaps. The wing chief of safety, MAJCOM/SE, System Program Office
safety officer or equivalent, or HQ USAF/SE/SED may provide contractors privileged safety information
for this function. This includes Space System Contractors, Space Technical Support Contractors, Advi-
sory & Assistance Services (A&AS), and Federally Funded Research & Development Centers (FFRDC)
when they are performing an Air Force function.
3.3.3.5.7. Any other release of privileged safety information to contractors will first be approved by HQ
USAF/SE/SED.

3.3.3.6. Limiting Release to Other Services and DOD Agencies. Other US military services and DOD
agencies responsible for flying, supporting or maintaining Air Force aircraft may receive privileged safety
information when needed for mishap prevention. Joint project or program offices may share privileged
safety information with members of other DOD agencies working on the same project or program without
prior approval. Approval authority for exchanging formal safety reports with other military services is HQ
USAF/SE/SED or HQ AFSC/JA.
3.3.3.7. Limiting Release to Foreign Military Organizations. All agreements regarding the release of
safety information to foreign military organizations are subject to the limitations and guidance found in
DoDI 6055.7. Release of safety information to NATO military organizations is governed by NATO
STANAGs 3101, Exchange of Safety Information Concerning Aircraft and Missiles, and 3531, Safety
Investigation and Reporting of Accidents/Incidents Involving Military Aircraft and/or Missiles. Many
other foreign military organizations have MOAs/MOUs with HQ USAF/SE discussing the release of
safety information.
3.3.3.7.1. Foreign Nationals Flying USAF Aircraft or Participating in USAF Training. Release of safety
information to foreign nationals is governed by DoDI 6055.7. Note that foreign national military person-
nel assigned to the DoD Components are defined as DoD military personnel by DoDI 6055.7.
3.4.3. These reports can be released outside the Air Force safety community and outside the Air Force
once protected information, including Privacy Act information, findings, and recommendations are
removed. The installation chief of safety is the release authority for providing these reports to other Air
Force personnel. The reports may not be used for any purpose other than mishap prevention, with the
exception that the complete report may be released to Air Force claims personnel to assist them in evalu-
ating claims for damages filed against the Air Force. When release will be made outside the Air Force,
HQ AFSC/JA is the release authority.
5.5.2.3. SIB presidents and SIOs must ensure a "non-disclosure statement" on protection of privileged
data is prepared (Figure A3.7.) and endorsed by all technical experts (e.g., contractors, NTSB, FAA, etc.)
who are offered a promise of confidentiality or provided access to privileged information. NOTE: See
paragraph 3.2.5.2. for safety investigations where a promise of confidentiality is authorized. This memo-
randum is not required from Air Force civilian employees.
5.6.1.1. The SIB/SIO is not prohibited from sharing information with technical experts who, although not
members of a board, analyze information or wreckage on behalf of safety investigators.
5.7.3.9. This instruction requires collecting and maintaining information protected by the Privacy Act of
1974 as authorized by Title 10 United States Code, section 8013 and Executive Order 9397.
5.7.3.9.1. Safety investigators will request the SSN of military members and civilian employees involved
in reportable mishaps. Inform individuals that Title 10 USC 8013 and EO 9397 are the legal authority for
requesting the SSN and that the SSN will be used for safety mishap investigating and reporting.
5.14.1.1. Examples of information given to the legal board president include (this list contains examples
only); a list of witnesses, cockpit and tower audio recordings, data recorders, coroner’s report, autopsy
report, toxicology test results, police reports, personnel and medical records.

AIRCRAFT GROUND OPERATIONS MISHAP. A mishap involving DoD aircraft, with an aircrew
member on board, that occurs between engine start/shutdown and prior to/following intent for flight that
results in reportable property damage or any injury or fatality. Damage to a missile prior to the completion
of weapons upload procedures, or after initiation of weapons download procedures is a Missile mishap.
Note: The three key factors required to meet the AGO category are: Aircrew member on board, Engines
running, and intention to become airborne at some point.
DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE (DAF) CIVILIAN PERSONNEL-Includes Senior Executive
Service (SES), general schedule (GS), and wage board (WB) employees, including ANG and AFRC tech-
nicians, unless in military duty status. Includes non-appropriated fund (NAF) employees who are not mil-
itary personnel working part time. Includes Youth Opportunity Program (YOP) and Student Assistance
Program employees. Includes foreign-national civilians employed by Air Force (Air Force Foreign
Nationals (AFFN)). This includes Air Force responsibility for any compensation claims arising from
employment injury.
FATAL INJURY—(Class A) — Injuries resulting in death, either in the mishap or at a later time, to
include within 30 days subsequent to being medically discharged, retired, or separated from the service,
due to complications arising from mishap injuries.
FIRE RELATED MISHAP—A mishap with reportable damage to real property or equipment or report-
able injury to Air Force personnel resulting from fire, but does not involve a DOD aircraft or DOD UAV
weapon system, or explosives. Fire mishaps are categorized as industrial mishaps and includes non-Air
Force personnel when Air Force property or equipment fires cause injury.
FIRST AID CASE— Any initial one-time treatment and any follow-up visit for observation of minor
scratches, cuts, burns, and splinters, etc., that does not ordinarily require medical care. Such one-time
treatment and follow-up visit for observation is considered first aid, even though provided by a physician
or medical professional. The following information describes those cases that would be considered first
aid. Treatment outside this finite list is considered medical treatment greater than first aid:
   –Using a non-prescription medication at non-prescription strength (for medications available in both
   prescription and non-prescription form, a recommendation by a physician or other licensed health care
   professional to use a non-prescription medication at prescription strength is considered medical treat-
   ment);
   –Administering tetanus immunizations (other immunizations, such as Hepatitis B vaccine or rabies
   vaccine, are considered medical treatment);
   –Cleaning, flushing or soaking wounds on the surface of the skin;
   –Using wound coverings such as bandages, Band-Aids™, gauze pads, etc.; or using butterfly ban-
   dages or Steri-Strips™ (other wound closing devices such as sutures, staples, etc., are considered

      –Using any non-rigid means of support, such as elastic bandages, wraps, non-rigid back belts, etc.
      (devices with rigid stays or other systems designed to immobilize parts of the body are considered
      medical treatment);
      –Using temporary immobilization devices while transporting an accident victim (e.g., splints, slings,
      neck collars, back boards, etc.).
      Drilling of a fingernail or toenail to relieve pressure, or draining fluid from a blister;
      –Using eye patches;
      –Removing foreign bodies from the eye using only irrigation or a cotton swab;
      –Removing splinters or foreign material from areas other than the eye by irrigation, tweezers, cotton
      swabs or other simple means;
      –Using finger guards;
      –Using massages (physical therapy or chiropractic treatment are considered medical treatment); or
      –Drinking fluids for relief of heat stress.
NOTE: See 29 CFR 1904, Recording and Reporting Occupational Injuries and Illness, for further guid-
ance for injury and illness classifications.
GROUND AND INDUSTRIAL MISHAP—An Air Force mishap that occurs to on-duty DoD civilian
and on- or off-duty DoD military personnel and does not meet the mishap category definition of nuclear,
space, aviation, guided missile, explosives and chemical agents, directed energy, afloat, or motor vehicle
as defined by this instruction. NOTE: A mishap involving both on- and off-duty military personnel is con-
sidered to be an on-duty mishap. This category also includes old ground mishaps categories such as Fire,
Combat Training, Physical and Athletic Conditioning, Contractor, and Natural Phenomena. These have
been replaced with questions in AFSAS.
GROUND MISHAP—For the purposes of this instruction, a mishap that falls into one of the following
mishap categories: afloat, motor vehicle, or ground and industrial. NOTE: A ground mishap may involve
materiel/equipment that is not traditionally thought of as happening on the ground (e.g., an off-duty mili-
tary person flying a private plane). Former category Off-Duty Military and sub-categories of fire, combat
training, physical and athletic conditioning, contractor, and natural phenomena have been replaced with
questions in AFSAS. Damage to public or private property or injury or illness to none-DOD personnel
caused by DOD operations are ground mishaps.
INDUSTRIAL AVIATION MISHAP. Delete
INDUSTRIAL MISHAP—A ground and industrial mishap that occurs in the work environment that
does not meet the mishap subcategory definition of sport and recreational or miscellaneous as defined by
this instruction. Also includes categories fire, combat training, physical and Athletic Conditioning, Con-
tractor, and Natural Phenomena. (The work environment, as defined in 29 Code of Federal Regulations
1960, is “The establishment and other locations where one or more Air Force employees are working or
are present as a condition of their employment; this would include those areas or locations where persons
are TDY for training purposes. The work environment includes not only physical locations, but also the
equipment or materials used by the employee during the course of his or her work).

LOST TIME CASE (Class C)—Any injury or occupational illness or disease that causes loss of one or
more days away from work beyond the day or shift it occurred. When determining if the mishap is a Lost
Time Case, you must count the number of days the employee was unable to work as a result of the injury
or illness, regardless of whether or not the person was scheduled to work on those days. Weekend days,
holidays, vacation days, or other days off are included in the total number of day’s loss, if the employee
would not have been able to work on those days. Don’t count the day of the injury/illness or the day the
individual returns to work. NOTE: Occurrences that result from voluntary participation in wellness and
fitness programs, or recreational activities such as exercise class, racquetball, or baseball or injuries or ill-
nesses resulting from an employee eating, drinking, or preparing food for personnel consumption will be
reported to comply with Department of Defense mandates.
MISCELLANEOUS MISHAP —A ground and industrial mishap that is on- or off-duty and does not fit
into the industrial or sport and recreational subcategory. Also included in this subcategory are reportable
mishaps occurring while using a commercial carrier such as a commercial bus, airplane, or taxicab.
MISHAP—A mishap is an unplanned occurrence, or series of occurrences, that results in damage or
injury and meets Class A, B, C, D and E mishap reporting criteria IAW paragraph 1.8. Damage or injury
includes: damage to DOD property; occupational illness to DOD military or civilian personnel; injury to
DOD military personnel on- or off-duty; injury to on-duty DOD civilian personnel; damage to public or
private property, or injury or illness to non-DOD personnel caused by Air Force operations.
NATURAL PHENOMENA MISHAP – Deleted.
NATURAL PHENOMENA RELATED —Injury to persons or damage to DoD property resulting from
wildlife or environmental conditions of such a magnitude that they could not have been predicted or pre-
pared for or for which all reasonable preparations had been taken. Do not report incidents that are natural
phenomena related where adequate preparation, forecasting, and communication actions were taken and
there were no injuries. However, report military and civilian injuries resulting from these mishaps as
ground and industrial mishaps. NOTE. Natural phenomena mishaps are categorized as industrial mishaps.
NO LOST TIME CASE (Class D)— Any injury or occupational illness or disease that restricts work
activities and does not meet the definition of Lost Time. These are cases where, because of injury or
occupational illness or disease, Air Force personnel only work partial days, restricted work or were trans-
ferred to another job, required medical treatment greater than first aid, loss of consciousness, or a signifi-
cant injury or illness/disease diagnosed by a physician or other licensed health care professional, even if it
does not result in death, days away from work, restricted work or job transfer, medical treatment greater
then first aid, or loss of consciousness. NOTE: Occurrences that result from voluntary participation in
wellness and fitness programs, or recreational activities such as exercise class, racquetball, or baseball or
injuries or illnesses resulting from an employee eating, drinking, or preparing food for personnel con-
sumption will be reported to comply with Department of Defense mandates.
NONFATAL CASES WITHOUT LOST WORKDAYS—These are cases other than lost workday
cases where, because of injury or occupational illness, Air Force personnel were transferred to another
job, required medical treatment greater than first aid, lost consciousness, or were diagnosed as having an
occupational illness.
OFF-DUTY MILITARY RELATED—A fatality or injury to off-duty DOD military personnel whether
or not on a DOD installation, excluding private motor vehicle (PMV) mishaps. NOTE: A mishap involv-
ing on- and off-duty military personnel in the same mishap will be categorized as an on-duty mishap.

ON-DUTY—DOD personnel are on-duty when: Physically present at any location where they are to per-
form their officially assigned work. Officially assigned work includes organization-sponsored events an
employee is permitted to attend, regardless of location. This includes those activities incident to normal
work activities that occur on DOD installations, such as lunch, coffee, or rest breaks, and all activities
aboard military vessels. NOTE: Personnel walking to and from work place parking areas at the start and
end of the duty day are in an on-duty status. Personnel who eat lunch and then deviate from normal lunch
activities (example shopping) are considered off-duty.
Being transported by DOD or commercial conveyance to perform officially assigned work. (This includes
travel in PMVs or commercial conveyances while performing official duty, but not routine travel to and

ing centers, officer and enlisted clubs, gymnasiums, and similar on-base non-appropriated fund (NAF)
facilities and similar places required for the health or comfort of the member, are considered on-duty.
However, when personnel deviate from the normal incidents of the trip and become involved in activities,
personal or otherwise, that are not reasonably incidental to the duties of the temporary assignment con-
templated by the employer, the person ceases to be considered on-duty for investigation and reporting
purposes of injuries or occupational illnesses. Injuries or occupational illnesses to personnel resulting
from activities unrelated to the temporary duty assignment or non-commander directed sports and recre-
ation activities (e.g. jogging, golfing, basketball) will be reported as off-duty mishaps.
