1. SORTS General Policy. The 31st Fighter Wing Commander (31 FW/CC) will ensure SORTS reports
for assigned units are accurate, timely, clear, and complete. Unit commanders will make the final deter-
mination concerning a unit’s overall C-level using commander’s judgment.
    1.1. The wing SORTS office acts as the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) for SORTS and will
    accomplish all installation SORTS reporting.
    1.2. SORTS data is classified and declassified IAW AFI 10-201, paragraph 1.4 and USAFE Sup 1.
    1.3. Increased frequency/exercise reporting will be submitted to the command post (CP) as directed
    by the Wing SORTS Monitor IAW Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff Manual (CJCSM) 3150.02A, AFI
    10-201, AFI 10-201_USAFESUP 1, and HQ USAFE guidance.
    1.4. All unit SORTS reports will be submitted to the wing SORTS office IAW the “Preparing Monthly
    SORTS Reports” checklist (see Attachment 1). Unit monitors must ensure they meet their scheduled
    appointment per the monthly SORTS turn-in letter.
    1.5. All agencies that develop and submit SORTS data will maintain the following publications and
    operating instructions:
       1.5.1. AFPD 10-2, Readiness.
       1.5.2. AFI 10-201, Status of Resources and Training System, and USAFE Supplement 1.
       1.5.3. AVIANOI 10-201, Instruction, Status of Resources and Training System.
       1.5.4. USMTF User Format CD-ROM (formerly AFPAM 10-709 V1).

2. Designed Operational Capability (DOC) Statement. The unit Designed Operational Capability
(DOC) statement provides specific measurement standards for unit C-level reporting. CJCS SORTS pol-
icy requires the unit overall C-level to be based on the unit resources and training required to perform the
unit’s full wartime mission.
    2.1. The unit’s DOC statement will not be used to establish, organize, or design a unit. DOC state-
    ments are not tasking instruments. Do not modify the requirements in DOC statements, as inaccurate
    reporting could result.
    2.2. Most units will only have a single DOC statement, called the primary DOC. If parts of a unit’s
    total wartime mission are significantly different, the MAJCOM may produce multiple DOC state-
    ments for that particular unit. In those cases, the most resource intensive portion of the total mission
    will normally be the primary DOC. The next most resource intensive portion of the mission will be
    the secondary DOC, and the third portion is the tertiary DOC.
    2.3. All unit DOC statements will be sent to the Wing SORTS Office from the MAJCOM. The new
    DOC statement will immediately be given to the unit SORTS monitor for the unit commander to
    review, sign, and date. The original copy of the DOC statement will be returned to 31 FW/CP within
    seven (7) duty days. A copy of the unit DOC statement will be given to the unit SORTS monitor and
    to the 31st Fighter Wing Manpower Office (31 FW/MO).

3. SORTS Responsibilities.

     tional manager is aware of the impending rating. The wing SORTS manager will query the unit

*NOTE: DO NOT PUT ANY CLASSIFIED INFORMATION ON THIS CHECKLIST. ALL
SORTS READINESS DATA (CATEGORY LEVELS (P, R, S, T), OVERALL CATEGORY
LEVEL, REASON CODES ASSOCIATED WITH THEIR REMARKS, AND LIMITING FAC-
TORS) IS CLASSIFIED. (AFI 10-201 PARA. 1.4)
I. PREPARE WORKSHEETS

_____ 1. Ensure that you are using the correct worksheets. (i.e.: use USAFE IMT Forms 215A, 215B,
215C, 215D, 215E, and 216 for your Primary DOC and a second set, without IMT Form 216 for your Sec-
ondary DOC report.)
_____ 2. Before any data is entered, stamp appropriate classification on the top, bottom, front, and back
of all worksheets.
_____ 3. Fill in header information on all worksheets. (Measured unit, DOC Number, DOC Response
Time, DOC Title and Supporting Unit, if applicable.)
_____ 4. When you receive a new DOC statement, compare with old DOC statement to determine what
areas have changed. If any of the data fields for Equip. & Supplies, Equip. Condition or Training have
changed, annotate on worksheet. Do this by going to the appropriate worksheet and filling in the label that
is to be added or deleted in block 3, on the ADD/DELETE lines.
_____ 5. Each report will consist of at a minimum, the first page of each of the form packages. i.e. page
one of 215A, B, C, D, E, and 216. If any pages are not use in a specific package on the first page of that
package write pages xx were not used and initial.
II. PERSONNEL WORKSHEETS (USAFE IMT 215B)

_____ 1. Enter the Total Personnel numbers for Assigned, Available, and Authorized.
_____ 2. On the Critical Worksheets (USAFE IMT 216B, pg 2) list all AFSCs or critical functions that
are required by the unit. (Ref Doc statement and AFI Table 3.1.)
_____ 3. Take the total numbers from Critical Worksheets and place each in their appropriate slot on page
1 of USAFE IMT 215B Personnel Worksheet. Ensure that the numbers are entered correctly!
NOTE: For 9 or less, use the 9 or less table. (AFI 10-201, table 3.2)
_____ 4. Determine percentage for both Total Personnel and Critical Personnel. Double check numbers
and results.
