   level of supervision required to accomplish training. (T-2) If the mission objectives include
   introduction to tasks or instruction to correct previous discrepancies, a highly experienced
   ICSI may be required. If mission objectives require direct supervision, the lead weapon
   system CSI may be warranted.
1.9. Training Records and Reports. Units will:
   1.9.1. Maintain a training folder for each assigned CSI and non IP/ICSO qualified MSIs. (T-
   2) The training folder will include records of individual training to include, but not limited to,
   QT, BSI, AI training, and certifications, in accordance with the records disposition schedule
   (RDS). Training records for IP/ICSO qualified MSIs will be maintained in their established
   training folder. Note: A model electronic training folder can be found on the AETC/A3V
   SharePoint site located at: https://eis.aetc.af.mil/hq/A23/A3V/default.aspx.
   1.9.2. The AF Form 4348 provides a permanent record and certification source for simulator
   instructor certifications not attained through an AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew
   Qualification. Following signature on the AF Form 4348, records of training leading up to
   the certification may be removed from the training folder.
       1.9.2.1. For each certification achieved and listed on the letter of Xs, units will maintain
       documentation on an AF Form 4348 in the individual’s training folder. (T-2) Use one line

       for each certification. If a certification is given with restrictions, state the restrictions on
       the AF Form 4348 in the Remarks block. (T-2)
       1.9.2.2. Decertification of events fall into two categories: Decertification for Cause (with
       prejudice) and Discretionary Decertification (without prejudice).
           1.9.2.2.1. Decertification for Cause. This action is normally associated with
           Commander-Directed Downgrade of a simulator instructor, but also applies to
           commander-directed decertification of examiners (resulting from substandard
           performance). To document Decertification for Cause, place an “X” in the
           appropriate box; enter date of decertification under Decertification Date block; enter
           name, rank, organization and office symbol and signature of the decertifying official
           under Decertifying Official/Organization block.
           1.9.2.2.2. Discretionary Decertification. An administrative action not based on
           performance. Such decertification is warranted when loss of certification occurs that
           will not be regained, when instructor certified events become core mission events, or
           when a higher certification is obtained making the previous entry obsolete.
           Discretionary Decertification is also applicable for decertification of CSIEs as a result
           of reasons other than substandard performance. To document Discretionary
           Decertification, place an “X” in the appropriate box; enter date of decertification
           under Decertification Date block; enter name, rank, organization and office symbol
           and signature of the decertifying official under Decertifying Official/Organization
           block.
       1.9.2.3. For simulator instructors who change weapon systems while assigned/attached
       to the same organization, prepare a new AF Form 4348 indicating the new weapon
       system and transcribe all events which apply to the new weapon system. (T-2)
       1.9.2.4. During the initial review of individual training folder for new CSIs (if one
       exists), review previous AF Form 4348 (or other certification documentation) entries to
       determine all applicable certifications of the newly assigned CSI. (T-2) Document
       applicable certifications accepted by the gaining unit commander/lead CSI on a new AF
       Form 4348. (T-3) The Lead CSI or other individual designated by the lead CSI will sign a
       one line entry below all other entries verifying that above certification transcriptions are
       accurate. (T-2)
       1.9.2.5. Computer-generated AF forms must mirror AF forms published on the Air Force
       e-Publishing web site.
       1.9.2.6. Describe unit AF Form 4348 procedures/program in the unit supplement. (T-2)
       Include a list of certifications applicable to the unit and designated certifying officials.
       Document procedures to ensure certifications reflected on AF Form 4348 are also
       included in ARMS. (T-2)
    1.9.3. Use AF Form 4293, Student Activity Record, to document any unusual occurrence that
    could affect training progress. ICSIs should annotate areas of difficulty on the form. (T-2)
    1.9.4. Document training in ARMS/GTIMS. (T-2) Track the following information for all
    CSIs, as applicable: (Note: IP/ICSO qualified MSI requirements will be tracked IAW MDS-
    specific volume 1.)

                                          TRAINING

2.1. Qualification Training (QT).
   2.1.1. On completion of the MAJCOM approved CSI syllabus, CSI and non-aircraft
   qualified MSI candidates will be qualified as simulator instructors. Except in unusual
   circumstances, candidates undergoing QT will receive ground and simulator instruction with
   a minimum of interruption, and complete training within the time specified by the syllabus.
   (T-2)
   2.1.2. MSI candidates qualified as IPs/ICSOs in the aircraft are automatically qualified to
   operate the simulator from the cockpit without further training. Qualified IPs/ICSOs who will
   instruct from the simulator instructor operator station (IOS) must be trained to operate the
   appropriate IOS. (T-2) Units will publish an IOS training program for qualified IPs/ICSOs.
   (T-2) As a minimum, they should include the training requirements specifically listed in
   paragraphs 2.3.2 and 2.4.2
Note: IPs/ICSOs who learned to operate the simulators during their instructor upgrade course
need not accomplish additional MSI training.
   2.1.3. MSI candidates not qualified as IPs/ICSOs in the aircraft must meet all requirements
   of the appropriate CSI syllabus and this instruction. (T-2)
2.2. Prerequisites. QT course prerequisites will be according to the appropriate MAJCOM
approved syllabus. Applicants who were not previous flight instructors must have the CSI
syllabus tailored to meet any additional training or evaluation requirements. (T-2) They must
also complete an expanded BSI program. (T-2)
2.3. Ground Training.
   2.3.1. Ground training will follow the CSI syllabus flow, but may be tailored to the
   individual's background and experience as well as local weapon system requirements. (T-2)
   2.3.2. IP/ICSO qualified MSI candidates, who will instruct from the simulator IOS, must
   accomplish at least one ground training session relating to operation of the appropriate flying
   training device and IOS with a current and qualified simulator instructor. (T-2) Units may
   establish more requirements in a unit supplement to this instruction.
2.4. Simulator Training.
   2.4.1. CSI candidates in QT will train under the supervision of an ICSI until completing the
   qualification evaluation. (T-2) The CSI course syllabus mission objectives and tasks are
   minimum requirements for qualification. Additional training due to nonprogression is only
   available within the constraints of the formal course syllabus.
   2.4.2. IP/ICSO qualified MSI candidates, who will instruct from the simulator IOS, must
   observe a current and qualified simulator instructor during at least one student syllabus
   mission in any category. (T-2) Following completion of the observation mission(s), a CSIE
   will monitor and critique the MSI candidate while conducting at least one student
   instructional mission. (T-2) Units may establish more requirements in a unit supplement to
AETCI11-203 14 MAY 2014                                                                        11


   this instruction. Upon the recommendation of the CSIE, the unit commander will certify the
   MSI. (Note: IPs/ICSOs who learned to operate the simulators during their instructor upgrade
   course need not accomplish additional MSI training.)
2.5. Multiple Qualifications. Qualification in more than one weapon system simulator requires
AETC/A3V approval. Simulator instructors qualified in more than one weapon system must
meet all training and evaluation requirements of each weapon system. (T-2)
2.6. Conversion and Difference Qualifications. Conversion qualification will be
accomplished IAW the guidance in the appropriate CSI qualification syllabus. (T-2) Difference
training is not authorized without AETC/A3V approval.
2.7. Loss of CSI Qualification. Failure of an evaluation, a commander-directed downgrade, or
failure to perform CSI duties for more than 225 calendar days will result in loss of CSI
qualification. To regain qualification, CSIs must, at a minimum, successfully complete an
evaluation according to Chapter 3 of this instruction. (T-2)
2.8. Loss of MSI Qualification.
   2.8.1. MSIs not qualified as IPs/ICSOs will follow guidance in paragraph 2.7 above. (T-2)
   2.8.2. IP/ICSO qualified MSIs who fail an aircraft instructor evaluation (or any evaluation
   for instructional reasons), allow the evaluation to lapse, or receive a commander-directed
   downgrade will not instruct in the simulator until a successful instructor requalification
   evaluation is accomplished in accordance with the appropriate MDS-specific, volume 2. (T-
   2) MSIs who fail an aircraft mission evaluation or allow it to expire will not instruct those
   areas in the simulator until a successful requalification evaluation is accomplished in
   accordance with the appropriate MDS-specific, volume 2. (T-2)
2.9. Simulator Instructor Requalification. The following provides criteria for requalifying
simulator instructors who have not performed simulator instructor duties for:
   2.9.1. A period of 226 calendar days to 2 years. OG/CCs are the approval authorities for
   locally-generated simulator instructor requalification programs used in lieu of completing a
   formal qualification syllabus for flying training programs under their oversight. Locally
   generated programs will be developed considering the simulator instructor’s previous
   experience and currency. (T-2) Highly experienced ICSIs will conduct the training. (T-2) An
   RQ INSTR evaluation will be completed for CSIs according to Chapter 3 of this instruction.
   (T-2) Forward copies of the training plan to AETC/A3F, AETC/A3Q, and AETC/A3Z as
   appropriate. (T-2)
   2.9.2. A period of more than 2 years. The simulator instructor must complete the appropriate
   qualification syllabus. (T-2) Note: IP/ICSO qualified MSIs must accomplish IOS training.
   (T-2)
2.10. Continuation Training (CT).
   2.10.1. Judicious scheduling of CT is required to develop instructors and ensure training
   standardization. As part of the CT program, ID sorties are flown to develop individual
   instructional skills and enhance basic simulator proficiency. These sorties allow less
   experienced simulator instructors to learn and refine techniques from more experienced
   simulator instructors. Units will track all CT requirements in ARMS/GTIMS. (T-3)
 12                                                                 AETCI11-203 14 MAY 2014


    2.10.2. IP/ICSO qualified MSIs will comply with all appropriate MDS-specific, volume 1
    CT requirements. (T-1) They are not responsible for other CT requirements in this instruction
    unless their MDS-specific volume 1 requirements are not met. IP/ICSO qualified MSIs
    unable to maintain MDS-specific, volume 1 currency due to extended DNIF (or other reasons
    beyond the aircrew member’s control), may continue to instruct students in the simulator as
    long as their INSTR evaluation is current and they are cleared for simulator duty by the flight
    surgeon. After expiration of MDS-specific, volume 1 CT requirements, they will comply
    with all CT requirements listed in this instruction until regaining currency in the aircraft. (T-
    2)
2.11. Training Cycle. There are two semiannual CT training cycles, 1 January to 30 June and 1
July to 31 December of each calendar year. Semiannual requirements are reviewed at the end of
each semiannual period.
2.12. CT Administration:
    2.12.1. Quarterly CT Meetings:
       2.12.1.1. To encourage training cross flow, CSIs should attend CT meetings sponsored
       by the flying training squadron (FTS) flight to which they are assigned or attached when
       their primary duty schedule allows. (T-3)
       2.12.1.2. Units may hold a separate CSI CT meeting if desired. The purpose of these
       meetings should be to discuss standardization, safety, mission-related topics, instructional
       techniques, grading practices, and to increase general knowledge. IP/ICSO qualified
       MSIs are highly encouraged to attend CSI CT meetings if held.
       2.12.1.3. All available CSIs will attend CSI-Specific CT meetings (or the FTS meeting if
       no CSI-specific meetings are held). (T-2) The unit will determine a method to track
       attendance. (T-2) Individuals not available for CT meetings will read the meeting minutes
       or be briefed by a supervisor. (T-2)
    2.12.2. Requirements. This instruction establishes minimum simulator instructor CT
    requirements. Units may direct additional training, to include cockpit performance, in a
    supplement to this instruction as necessary for individual weapon system requirements. ID
    sorties are meant to help build and maintain instructor proficiency.
    2.12.3. Prorating End-of-Cycle Requirements. At the end of the training cycle, the
    squadron commander/lead CSI may prorate training requirements for instructors who were
    not available for duty. Use the prorating allowance in Table 2.1 to determine the number of
    months to be prorated based on each period of consecutive calendar days of non-duty.
    Requirements may be prorated to zero.

    2.12.4. Failure to Complete CT Requirements:
       2.12.4.1. Simulator instructors who fail to maintain ground and/or simulator training
       requirements will not instruct in the new training cycle until a review is completed to
       determine the cause of the deficiency and whether additional training is required. (T-2)
       2.12.4.2. The OG commander is the review authority. The reviewer should consider the
       type and magnitude of the deficiency and the individual’s experience level to determine if
       the previous training cycle requirements must be accomplished or if additional training or
       increased supervision is warranted. Document reviews in the individual’s training folder.
2.13. Periodic Emergency Procedures (EP) Simulator Training: (Note: Not required for
IP/ICSO qualified MSIs.)
    2.13.1. All simulator instructors will accomplish a semiannual EP simulator. (T-2)
    Accomplish the mission in the simulator cockpit with another simulator instructor operating
    the IOS. (T-2) Note: Instructors may swap positions after all requirements have been met.
    2.13.2. Because of local emergency scenarios, a locally generated simulator EP instructor
    guide will be used when administering the simulator. (T-3) The simulator mission should
    include:
       2.13.2.1. A cross section of critical action procedures and selected noncritical action
       emergencies.
       2.13.2.2. A cross section of thrust deficient situations.
       2.13.2.3. Applicable mishap lessons learned identified by MAJCOM, wing, or unit safety
       staffs.
2.14. BSI Program: (Note: Not required for IP/ICSO qualified MSIs.)
    2.14.1. Following QT, the Flt/CC or the lead weapon system CSI will assign each new
    simulator instructor to a highly qualified BSI who will monitor the new instructor's
    performance and provide guidance in all areas of job requirements until the new instructor
    has instructed through each category of training. (T-2) Note: The BSI program is not
    required for any simulator instructor who has previously completed a Buddy Instructor
    Pilot/BSI program in the same MDS aircraft or simulator.
    2.14.2. The training prescribed in Attachment 2 is the minimum required. Squadron
    commanders/lead CSIs should tailor each individual's BSI program and provide additional
    training as required. Document additional BSI training in the instructor’s training folder. (T-
    3)
2.15. Ground Training Requirements. (Note: Not required for IP/ICSO qualified MSIs.)
    2.15.1. Table 2 2 summarizes ground training requirements. For ground training prescribed
    by other instructions, units must refer to those instructions for the latest requirement. Initial
 14                                                               AETCI11-203 14 MAY 2014


   ground training accomplished during QT may be credited toward CT requirements for the
   training cycle in which it was accomplished.
   2.15.2. Refer to the ETCA web page at https://etca.randolph.af.mil/ for ancillary ground
   training requirements.
   2.15.3. Academic Instructor currency will be IAW AETCI 36-2604.

Notes:
1. The 558 CC/DO and all lead CSIs must accomplish at least 25 student instructional sorties.
Units may adjust requirements to meet resource availability and syllabus requirements.
2. Two student instructional sorties may be logged when two students are instructed on the
sortie.
3. Certified AIs may log a student instructional sortie for every 3 hours of classroom instruction
or every class they teach.
4. Simulator instructors may log instructional sorties on any simulator mission providing training
to students or permanent party members.
5. One semiannual EP simulator from line 3 (even when multiple are flown) and all BSI sorties
count in this total.
6. Simulator instructors may log instrument approaches in a solo simulator. (Solo simulator
cannot be logged as an ID sortie.)

2.17. Instructional Category Currency. All simulator instructors must accomplish an
instructional sortie every 60 days, and must instruct in each category of training every 90 days to
remain current. (T-3) Instructional category currency may be updated anytime a student mission
or ID sortie (including BSI sorties) in that category is accomplished from the cockpit or IOS.
Non-current instructors must regain currency before instructing in any non-current category. (T-
3) To regain category currency, the non-current simulator instructor will instruct from the IOS
while being monitored by a current and qualified simulator instructor in that category or
complete an ID sortie with a current and qualified simulator instructor which focuses on
maneuvers in the non-current category of training. (T-2)
   2.17.1. For T-1A PIT simulator instructors, the categories of training tracked are Q
   (XCS01), E (XCS04), and M (XCS02).
   2.17.2. T-1A PIT simulator instructors accomplishing an "I" syllabus event will log this as
   an "E" currency event (XCS04).
   2.17.3. T-1A PIT simulator instructors accomplishing a "TN" syllabus event will log this as
   a "Q" currency event (XCS01).
2.18. ID Sorties. (Note: Not required for IP/ICSO qualified MSIs.) There are several ways to
accomplish ID sorties. Each option listed in paragraphs 2.18.3 through 2.18.5 below may be
AETCI11-203 14 MAY 2014                                                                       17


used for credit only once during each semiannual period, although the missions may be flown
more than once each semiannual period. The option in paragraph 2.18.1 must be flown at least
once each semiannual period. Maneuvers from each syllabus category of training should be
flown each semiannual period. Instructional categories may be combined on ID sorties provided
sufficient time is allotted to each category (e.g. a low-level route flown for 30 minutes with a
forced weather abort to an instrument approach would qualify to accomplish a Low Level and
Instrument category of training).
   2.18.1. CSI with CSI option 1. CSI/CSI IP/EP ID sorties are flown when one CSI receives
   emergency procedures while occupying the seat while another CSI inputs emergency
   situations. The intent is for the receiving CSI to accomplish emergency procedures from a
   variety of locations and situations. CSIs may switch positions halfway through sortie to get
   training from both positions. All CSI must accomplish this option once each semiannual
   period.
   2.18.2. CSI with CSI option 2. CSI/CSI ID sorties are flown when one CSI is in the cockpit
   manipulating the controls and another CSI operating the IOS (2 T-1 CSI may complete an ID
   sortie by using the wireless IOS remote from either the left or right seat). CSIs must occupy
   the seat (not the IOS) to receive credit for the ID sortie. CSI may switch positions halfway
   through sortie to get training from both positions.
   2.18.3. CSI with CSI/Student option 3. CSI/Student/CSI ID sorties are flown when one CSI
   instructs a student mission and another monitors the prebrief, simulator mission, and debrief.
   Only the CSI monitoring the training may log the ID sortie.
   2.18.4. CSI with IP option 4. CSI/IP ID sorties are flown when a CSI instructs on any active
   duty IP missions (IP/EP, upgrade training, requalification, proficiency, etc). The CSI should
   spend a minimum of ½ hour prebriefing with the IP to cross flow techniques and
   instructional methods.
   2.18.5. CSI with ICSO/GSIP option 4 (UCT only). CSI/ICSO/GSIP IP/EP ID sorties are
   flown when a CSI receives or gives emergency procedures while occupying the seat while
   another CSI inputs emergency situations. The CSI occupying the seat is a supplemental crew
   member on GSIP or ICSO IP/EP missions. CSIs may switch positions halfway through
   sortie to get training from both positions.

                                       EVALUATIONS

3.1. Conducting Simulator Instructor Evaluations. All CSI and non IP/ICSO qualified MSI
evaluations will be conducted in accordance with the provisions of this instruction and should be
accomplished on actual student instructional missions whenever possible. (T-2) Note: MSIs
qualified as IPs/ICSOs in the aircraft will comply with all appropriate MDS-specific, volume 2
and AFI 11-202, volume 2 evaluation requirements (T-1) and need not complete separate
simulator evaluations unless deemed necessary by the unit.
3.2. CSI Examiners (CSIE):
   3.2.1. CSIE Selection. The SQ/CC/lead CSI will select and designate in writing (AF Form
   4348), all CSIEs from the most highly qualified and experienced instructors. (T-2) Selection
   and designation will be annotated on the unit certification document, recorded in
   ARMS/GTIMS and reported in the stan/eval Board (SEB) minutes. (T-3)
   3.2.2. CSIE Functions:
       3.2.2.1. Conduct simulator and EP evaluations as required.
       3.2.2.2. Maintain CSI qualification. (T-2)
       3.2.2.3. Administer evaluations only within their weapon system and only evaluate
       missions in which they maintain qualification. (T-2) Exception: CSIEs may conduct
       SPOT evaluations in weapons system in which they are not qualified.
       3.2.2.4. Prior to the mission, brief the examinee on the purpose of the evaluation and
       how it will be conducted. (T-2)
       3.2.2.5. Conduct a thorough post-mission debriefing for the examinee on all aspects of
       the evaluation. (T-2) The debrief will include the examinee’s overall grade, specific
       deviations, area grades assigned (if other than qualified), and any required additional
       training. The flight commander/lead weapon system CSI must be debriefed on all
       evaluations. (T-3) Additionally, the flight commander/lead weapon system CSI must
       attend the debrief if the overall grade is Q3. (T-3)
       3.2.2.6. Immediately correct breaches of safety or flight discipline during an evaluation.
       (T-2) If this situation occurs, the CSIE will debrief the flight commander/lead weapon
       system CSI and document the deviation on an AF Form 8. (T-3)
       3.2.2.7. CSIEs will not evaluate simulator instructors for whom they were the primary
       instructor during training or upgrade. (T-3)
3.3. Types of Evaluations. The CSI stan/eval program utilizes three types of evaluations to
ensure qualification of instructors and standardization of operations: simulator evaluations,
EPEs, and supplementary evaluations. Simulator evaluations are administered periodically and
will be documented on an AF Form 8. (T-2) EPEs are requisites for simulator instructor
qualification evaluations and will also be documented on the AF Form 8. (T-2) Qualification
evaluations and EPEs are combined, along with other requisite events (e.g., examinations,
Boldface/CAPs) to form simulator instructor Qualification Evaluations. Supplementary
AETCI11-203 14 MAY 2014                                                                         19


evaluations are tools to be used by the commander to ensure standardization of training and other
operations.
3.4. Simulator Instructor Qualification Evaluations. Simulator instructor qualification
evaluations consist of two structured phases, ground and simulator. Each phase requires the
completion of requisite tasks. The ground phase includes a series of examinations and evaluation
of emergency procedures knowledge. The simulator phase includes operation of the IOS and
effective instruction of a flying training student. Note: Units may require cockpit manipulation
of the controls if appropriate. If cockpit performance is required, the unit supplement must
document all requirements. (T-2) Evaluation criteria from the appropriate AFI 11-2MDS,
Volume 2 will be used to grade all maneuvers flown from the cockpit. (T-2)
   3.4.1. Simulator Instructor Qualification Evaluation Categories. There are three types of
   simulator instructor qualification evaluations: instructor qualification (INSTR/QUAL),
   mission (MSN), and SPOT. INSTR/QUAL and MSN evaluations are administered
   periodically to ensure basic qualification as instructors in the weapon system. SPOT
   evaluations of specific simulator instructor performance may also be accomplished.
       3.4.1.1. INSTR/QUAL Evaluations. All simulator instructors will complete initial and
       periodic INSTR/QUAL evaluations, to include requisites, in their primary weapon
       system. (T-2)
       3.4.1.2. MSN Evaluations. The requirement for a MSN evaluation is optional but may
       be required by individual units in their unit supplement. MSN evaluations may be
       required for those weapon systems where performance of normal operational and training
       sorties involves tasks not covered during the accomplishment of an INSTR/QUAL
       evaluation. INSTR/QUAL and MSN evaluations may be combined into a single
       evaluation.
       3.4.1.3. SPOT Evaluations. A SPOT evaluation is not intended to satisfy the
       requirements of a periodic evaluation (e.g., INSTR/QUAL or MSN) and have no specific
       requisites or requirements, unless specified in unit supplements. They may be
       administered as No Notice. An examinee may utilize a SPOT evaluation to update an
       INSTR/QUAL/MSN evaluation expiration date provided all requirements for the
       evaluation are completed within the periods described in paragraph 3.4.7. Note: When
       the CSIE administering a SPOT evaluation is not qualified in the weapon system, the
       evaluation will not be credited towards a periodic evaluation.
   3.4.2. Combined Simulator Instructor Qualification Evaluations. To promote efficient
   use of resources, accomplish evaluations concurrently, whenever practical. If combined,
   include the designation of each evaluation in the Flight Phase of the AF Form 8 (e.g.,
   INSTR/QUAL/MSN). (T-2)
   3.4.3. Simulator Instructor Qualification Evaluation Prefixes. The following prefixes
   will be used, when applicable, to further describe evaluations.
       3.4.3.1. Initial (INIT). The first evaluation of any type for an instructor qualification in
       a weapon system (e.g., INIT INSTR/QUAL, INIT MSN).
       3.4.3.2. Requalification (RQ). An evaluation administered to remedy a loss of
       qualification due to expiration of a required periodic evaluation, a flight recheck
20                                                               AETCI11-203 14 MAY 2014


     following a failed periodic evaluation or loss of qualification due to a commander-
     directed downgrade.
         3.4.3.2.1. When loss of qualification is for expiration of a required periodic
         evaluation, the evaluation given will be IAW the guidance for that periodic
         evaluation. (T-2) The AF Form 8 Mission/Check description will be documented with
         an RQ prefix. (T-2)
         3.4.3.2.2. When loss of qualification is for failure to pass a periodic evaluation, the
         recheck evaluation will be IAW the provisions of paragraph 3.4.11 (T-2) The AF
         Form 8 Mission/Check description will be documented with an RQ prefix. (T-2)
         3.4.3.2.3. When loss of qualification is due to a commander-directed downgrade (see
         paragraph 3.4.15), the evaluation profile will be as directed by the commander/lead
         weapon system CSI. The AF Form 8 Mission/Check description will be documented
         with an RQ prefix or RQ SPOT, as applicable. (T-2)
         3.4.3.2.4. Do not use RQ to prefix a recheck following a failed INIT evaluation. No
         qualification was achieved, thus requalification is not possible.
     3.4.3.3. No-Notice (N/N). A no-notice evaluation is one where the examinee is notified
     of the evaluation at or after the beginning of normal preparation for the mission. The
     beginning of normal preparation for a mission will be defined in unit supplement to this
     instruction. (T-3) The intent is to preclude extraordinary preparation for the mission.
         3.4.3.3.1. The no-notice evaluation provides commanders a sampling of daily
         simulator instructor performance and an assessment of unit training effectiveness
         3.4.3.3.2. An examinee may utilize a no-notice evaluation to update an
         INSTR/QUAL/MSN evaluation expiration date provided all requirements for the
         evaluation are completed within the periods described in paragraph 3.4.7. If all
         requirements were not completed on the first sortie, the SQ/CC may authorize
         subsequent sorties to complete required events. For out-of-the-eligibility-period No-
         Notice evaluations, if the examinee elects not to update a periodic evaluation
         expiration date, the evaluation will be documented as a N/N SPOT evaluation. (T-2)
  3.4.4. Ground Phase Requisites. The ground phase for periodic simulator instructor
  evaluations includes requisites listed below. See paragraph 3.7 of this instruction for
  additional guidance on simulator instructor examinations.
     3.4.4.1. INSTR/QUAL Evaluations. Open book examination, closed book
     examination, Instrument examination, and Boldface/Critical Action Procedures (CAPs)
     examination (if applicable to the MDS)/EPE.
     3.4.4.2. MSN Evaluations. As specified in the unit supplement to this instruction.
  3.4.5. Simulator Phase Requisites. The examinee will accomplish all required planning in
  accordance with the training mission requirements and instruct from the IOS during a student
  training mission while the CSIE observes. (T-2) (Note: The CSIE may role play a student
  from the cockpit while the examinee instructs from the IOS.) The simulator phase for
  simulator instructor evaluations includes a suitable simulator profile that will allow
  evaluation of simulator instructor performance. (T-2) The profile used to fulfill the simulator
  phase requisite must incorporate all appropriate requirements set in Table 3.3 and allow
AETCI11-203 14 MAY 2014                                                                          21


  accurate measure of the proficiency of the examinee. (T-2) Evaluation profiles will reflect
  unit tasking, daily training missions, be realistic, and incorporate current tactics applicable to
  the unit mission. (T-2)
  3.4.6. Timing of Simulator Instructor Qualification Evaluations:
     3.4.6.1. Expiration Date. Required periodic evaluations expire on the last day of the
     17th month following the month in which the flight phase was successfully flown (e.g., a
     periodic evaluation in which the flight phase was completed on 9 Oct 14 expires on 31
     Mar 16.). (T-2)
     3.4.6.2. Eligibility Period. Periodic evaluations should be scheduled in the eligibility
     period, defined as the six-month period prior to the expiration date.
  3.4.7. Requisite Completion. One set of requisites may be used to satisfy the requirements
  of combined evaluations. Requisites from a completed evaluation may be used for
  subsequent evaluations provided they cover all required areas and are within the requisite
  zone for each evaluation. For all evaluations, accomplish requisites as follows:
     3.4.7.1. In-the-Eligibility Period. For scheduled or no-notice periodic evaluations in
     the eligibility period, all requisites must be completed within the eligibility period of the
     current evaluation. (T-2)
     3.4.7.2. Out-of-the-Eligibility Period. For periodic evaluations accomplished outside
     the eligibility period, all requisites must be completed within a six-month period
     beginning with the month in which the evaluation was administered. (T-2)
     3.4.7.3. Recheck. For evaluations used to remedy a failed evaluation, requisites that
     were valid for the failed evaluation remain valid. Valid requisite completion dates from
     the Q3 AF Form 8 will not be annotated on the recheck AF Form 8. The recheck AF
     Form 8 will only include documentation of the flight phase evaluation, unless requisites
     were not completed or are required to complete the recheck. If the recheck is completed
     prior to completion of required requisites, delay completion of the AF Form 8 until
     requisites are complete and enter the requisites on the recheck AF Form 8. (T-2)
  3.4.8. Alternate Means of Evaluation. When evaluation of a required area is not possible
  during the training mission, the area may be evaluated verbally. CSIEs will make every effort
  to evaluate all required areas during the training mission before resorting to this option.
  CSIEs will document the alternate means of evaluation in the examiner’s remarks section of
  the AF Form 8. (T-2)
  3.4.9. Grading System. A two level grading system is used to evaluate and document
  simulator instructor performance. On one level, individual scores are recorded for
  examinations while areas/subareas of simulator instructor performance are individually
  graded against evaluation grading criteria established in Tables 3.1 and 3.2. Performance less
  than fully qualified is documented. On the second level, an overall qualification level is
  determined from the compilation of these individual scores/grades.
     3.4.9.1. Area/Subarea Grades. Areas/subareas will have a two-tier (Q/U) or three-tier
     (Q/Q-/U) grading system.
 22                                                               AETCI11-203 14 MAY 2014


           3.4.9.1.1. Q is the desired level of performance. The examinee demonstrated a
           satisfactory knowledge of all required information, performed simulator instructor
           duties within the prescribed tolerances, and accomplished the assigned mission.
           3.4.9.1.2. Q- indicates the examinee is qualified to perform the assigned area/subarea
           tasks, but requires debriefing or additional training as determined by the CSIE.
           Deviations from established standards must not exceed the prescribed Q- tolerances
           or jeopardize safety.
           3.4.9.1.3. U indicates that performance was outside allowable parameters,
           compromised safety, and/or deviations from prescribed procedures/tolerances
           adversely affected mission accomplishment. An examinee receiving an area/subarea
           grade of U requires debriefing and/or additional training, as determined by the CSIE.
       3.4.9.2. Critical Area(s). Grade all critical areas identified in Table 3.3 as either
       Qualified (Q) or Unqualified (U). If the examinee receives an unqualified area grade in
       any of the critical areas identified in this instruction, an overall grade of Q3 will be
       assigned. (T-2)
       3.4.9.3. Performance Areas/Subareas.
           3.4.9.3.1. The CSIE must grade the areas/subareas listed as “required” in Table 3.3.
           (T-2)
           3.4.9.3.2. The CSIE will grade any area/subarea observed during an evaluation if
           performance in that area/subarea impacts the specific evaluation accomplished or
           overall safety. (T-2)
           3.4.9.3.3. Minor momentary deviations from grading criteria tolerances are
           acceptable, provided the examinee applies prompt corrective action and such
           deviations do not jeopardize safety. Consider cumulative deviations when
           determining the overall area/subarea grade.
           3.4.9.3.4. The CSIE may further identify an area/sub-area as “Commendable” if, in
           the examiner’s determination, the simulator instructor has demonstrated exceptional
           skill and knowledge in that particular area/sub-area. Document commendable areas in
           the examiner’s remarks section of the AF Form 8. (T-2)

        3.4.9.4. Overall Simulator Instructor Qualification Evaluation and EPE
        Qualification Levels. Overall simulator instructor evaluation and EPE performance are
        graded as a compilation of all area/sub-area grades based on the following guidance:
            3.4.9.4.1. Qualification Level 1 (Q1). The examinee demonstrated desired
            performance and knowledge of procedures, equipment and directives within
            tolerances specified in the grading criteria. This will be awarded when no
            discrepancies were noted, and may be awarded when discrepancies are noted if:
               3.4.9.4.1.1. The discrepancies resulted in no U grades being given in any
               area(s)/subarea(s).
               3.4.9.4.1.2. In the judgment of the CSIE, none of the discrepancies preclude
               awarding of an overall Q1.
               3.4.9.4.1.3. All areas/sub-areas graded as Q- during the evaluation were cleared
               during the debrief of that evaluation.
            3.4.9.4.2. Qualification Level 2 (Q2). The examinee demonstrated the ability to
            perform duties safely, but:
               3.4.9.4.2.1. There were one or more area(s)/subarea(s) where additional training
               was assigned.
               3.4.9.4.2.2. In the judgment of the CSIE, there is justification based on Q-
               performance in one or several areas/subareas regardless of whether or not
               additional training was assigned.
               3.4.9.4.2.3. A non-critical area/subarea grade of U was awarded. (The CSIE may
               award a Q3, but the maximum grade will be Q2).
            3.4.9.4.3. Qualification Level 3 (Q3). The examinee demonstrated an unacceptable
            level of safety, performance or knowledge.
               3.4.9.4.3.1. An area grade of U awarded in a critical area requires a Q3 for the
               applicable evaluation or EPE.
AETCI11-203 14 MAY 2014                                                                     29


            3.4.9.4.3.2. A Q3 can be awarded if, in the judgment of the CSIE, there is
            justification based on Q- or U performance in one or more areas/subareas.
     3.4.9.5. Boldface/CAPs. Grade Boldface/CAPs examinations on the two-tier grading
     system (i.e., either Q or U).
     3.4.9.6. Overall Qualification Levels. The overall qualification level awarded on an
     evaluation is based on performance during both the flight and ground phases. An overall
     grade of Q1 or Q2 will be awarded only after all evaluation requirements have been
     completed and given due consideration. An overall grade of Q3 may be awarded at any
     time.
         3.4.9.6.1. The CSIE will consider performance on requisite examinations in
         assigning the overall qualification level. If requisite examinations have not been
         accomplished by the time the CSIE gives the evaluation, the CSIE will be consulted
         after requisite exams have been completed to finalize the overall grade.
         3.4.9.6.2. To receive a qualified grade (Q1 or Q2) on an evaluation, the examinee
         must demonstrate the ability to operate the IOS (and manipulate the flight controls if
         required by the unit supplement) safely and effectively during all phases of an
         evaluation. However, CSIE judgment will always be the determining factor in
         deciding the overall qualification level.
     3.4.9.7. Exceptionally Qualified (EQ) Designation. An EQ designation may be
     awarded by the CSIE, but may only be applied to the total evaluation - not to separate
     requisites. The designation may be awarded when:
         3.4.9.7.1. The examinee has demonstrated exceptional skill and knowledge in all
         phases of the evaluation;
         3.4.9.7.2. The examinee has not failed any requisite and;
         3.4.9.7.3. The examinee received a Q on all areas/subareas evaluated during the
         evaluation and EPE.
  3.4.10. Remedial Action. All grades of Q- or less require action to remedy the discrepancy
  and/or deficiency in performance. (T-2) Remedial action includes debriefing discrepancies
  and/or assignment of additional training. See paragraph 3.4.11 when discrepancies result in
  failure to pass a flight evaluation.
     3.4.10.1. Debriefed Discrepancy. Remedial action accomplished during debrief of the
     evaluation wherein the CSIE provides briefing/instruction concerning the discrepancy
     and determines that the examinee has gained the necessary knowledge or proficiency to
     remedy the discrepancy. The discrepancy area/subarea description is annotated with
     “Debriefed” in paragraph B of the Examiner’s Remarks section of the AF Form 8
     Comments. (T-2)
     3.4.10.2. Additional Training. Any training recommended by CSIE to remedy
     deficiencies identified during an evaluation. Assignment of additional training by a CSIE
     should result in no higher than a Q2 on the applicable evaluation or EPE. The overall
     grade is still at the discretion of the CSIE IAW paragraph 3.4.9.6.
30                                                                AETCI11-203 14 MAY 2014


         3.4.10.2.1. Additional training may include self-study, ground instruction, or use of a
         simulator. To complete additional training, the examinee must demonstrate
         attainment of satisfactory knowledge or proficiency.
         3.4.10.2.2. Additional training is documented in paragraph C, Recommended
         Additional Training, under Examiner’s Remarks in the AF Form 8 Comments
         section. (T-2) Description of assigned additional training will include how
         satisfactory knowledge or proficiency will be demonstrated to an ICSI. (T-2)
         3.4.10.2.3. Due dates and dates on which additional training is completed will be
         documented in the appropriate areas of the AF Form 8 (see paragraph 3.8.1.7.5). (T-
         2)
         3.4.10.2.4. The ICSI who completed the additional training (or final event if more
         than one) will sign as the Certifying Official on the AF Form 8 under Additional
         Training, Section II. (T-2) This serves to verify completion of all assigned training as
         documented in paragraph C, Recommended Additional Training, under Examiner’s
         Remarks.
         3.4.10.2.5. Accomplish additional training by the last day of the third month
         following the date of the discrepancy (e.g., for an evaluation on 21 Jan 14, additional
         training must be accomplished by 30 Apr 14). (T-2) If a simulator instructor exceeds
         the allotted time for completion of additional training, the squadron commander/lead
         CSI will review the situation and direct appropriate action. (T-2) Document the
         circumstances with an MFR to be included in the AF Form 8 IAW paragraph
         3.8.1.9.3.5.5 (T-3)
  3.4.11. Failure to Pass an Evaluation.
     3.4.11.1. Simulator instructors receiving a Q3 evaluation are non-mission ready (NMR)
     and will not conduct student training.
     3.4.11.2. If an examinee fails an evaluation, a successful recheck must be completed by
     the end of the third month after the date of the first failure, (e.g., for an evaluation on 20
     Jun 14, complete the recheck by 30 Sep 14). (T-2) The CSIE that administered the
     original check will not administer the recheck. A recheck is successfully completed when
     the examinee performs to Q criteria (Q or Q-/debriefed) for each area graded U.
     3.4.11.3. SQ/CCs/lead CSIs may approve changes to the time limits in this paragraph on
     a case-by-case basis. Every reasonable effort must be made to requalify the examinee. (T-
     2) Commanders/lead CSIs will determine the training required based on the individual’s
     experience level. (T-3) Document the changes with an MFR to be included in the AF
     Form 8 IAW paragraph 3.8.1.9.3.5.5 (T-3)
  3.4.12. Restrictions. When deemed necessary in the judgment of the CSIE, restrictions will
  be imposed on the examinee until successful completion of assigned additional training
  and/or a recheck.
     3.4.12.1. Restrictions should address the specific operation that requires supervision and
     the criteria for removal of the restrictions.
AETCI11-203 14 MAY 2014                                                                        31


     3.4.12.2. Specific restrictions and the criteria for the removal of the restrictions will be
     documented as the first item of the AF Form 8 Comments. (T-2) Restrictions associated
     with failed requisite examinations will not be documented on the AF Form 8.
  3.4.13. Supervised Status. If unsatisfactory performance or restriction requires the
  simulator instructor be placed on supervised status, the type of supervisor (i.e., instructor or
  designated supervisor) will be determined by the squadron commander/lead CSI. (T-2)
  Supervision will be accomplished by instructors or designated supervisors qualified in the
  specific weapon system. (T-2)
  3.4.14. Failure to Complete an Evaluation within the Required Period. If an examinee
  fails to complete an evaluation within the eligibility period for an in-the-eligibility period
  evaluation or within the period listed in paragraph 3.4.7.2 for an out-of-the-eligibility period
  evaluation, the simulator instructor loses the qualification covered by the evaluation and the
  restrictions of paragraph 3.4.11 apply. Qualification may be re-established by administering a
  requalification evaluation (see paragraph 3.4.3.2) or by completion of the delinquent
  evaluation.
     3.4.14.1. Sq/CCs/lead CSIs may approve a one-time extension of no more than 90 days
     due to pending separation of CSI or unforeseen illness. Document the one-time extension
     with an MFR in the FEF.
     3.4.14.2. OG/CCs may approve plans to preclude the re-accomplishment of completed
     requisites to complete the evaluation on a case-by-case basis. Document the
     circumstances with an MFR to be included in the AF Form 8 IAW paragraph
     3.8.1.9.3.5.5 (T-3)
  3.4.15. Commander-Directed Downgrade. Any commander/lead CSI/lead weapon system
  CSI (squadron or above) in the simulator instructor’s chain of command may direct a
  downgrade to unqualified status without administering an evaluation under the following
  guidance:
     3.4.15.1. For instruction-related cases, use for cause only (e.g., breach of flying
     discipline or safety) - including incidents not observed by an examiner, or observed, but
     by an examiner of another aircrew specialty.
     3.4.15.2. For non-instruction-related cases, do not use as a substitution for, or in lieu of,
     administrative or judicial actions. Use in cases where such actions directly affect the
     commander’s/lead CSI’s confidence in the simulator instructor’s ability to safely operate
     the IOS and/or equipment (e.g., lapse in judgment significant enough to cast doubt on the
     simulator instructor’s decision-making abilities).
     3.4.15.3. The simulator instructor will cease acting in the qualification(s) in which they
     have been downgraded effective with the date the commander/lead CSI initiated the
     downgrade. (T-2)
  3.4.16. Multiple Qualifications. Multiple qualification guidance applies to simulator
  instructors who maintain qualification in two or more weapon systems. When differences
  between weapon systems are great enough, the unit will identify requirements for separate
  qualification requirements in their supplement. (T-3) When separate qualification is not
 32                                                               AETCI11-203 14 MAY 2014


   required, the unit will document certification in different weapon systems using the AF Form
   4348. (T-2)
       3.4.16.1. Documentation. Document AETC/A3V authority for multiple qualifications,
       including a list of aircraft in which qualification will be maintained, in an MFR placed in
       Section II of the Flight Evaluation Folder (FEF). (T-3)
       3.4.16.2. Qualification and Mission Evaluations. All simulator instructors require an
       INSTR/QUAL evaluation, and, if applicable, a MSN evaluation, to include requisites, in
       each weapon system. (T-2)
       3.4.16.3. Failure to Pass a Flight Evaluation. A Q3 on an INSTR/QUAL or MSN
       evaluation applies only to the weapon system for which the evaluation was administered,
       unless, in the opinion of the evaluator, the discrepancy is applicable to additional weapon
       systems.
3.5. Emergency Procedures Evaluations (EPEs). The examinee will accomplish all required
planning in accordance with the training mission requirements and instruct emergency
procedures from the IOS during a student training mission while the CSIE observes. (T-2) Note:
The CSIE may role play a student from the cockpit while the examinee instructs from the IOS.
   3.5.1. Scope. Evaluate a simulator instructor’s knowledge of weapon system-specific EPs
   and systems knowledge for all INSTR/QUAL evaluations. If required by the unit, evaluate
   MSN specific emergency procedures and systems knowledge during MSN evaluations. Only
   one EPE needs to be accomplished for each combined evaluation (i.e., one EPE for a
   INSTR/QUAL/MSN evaluation). A single EPE may be used for separate evaluations (e.g., a
   MSN and INSTR/QUAL evaluation) if the EPE is of a scope and duration to cover required
   areas and must be within the requisite zone for each evaluation.
   3.5.2. Q1 Performance. Q1 performance for EPEs requires successfully passing a
   Boldface/CAPs exam and planning, instructing, and critiquing a comprehensive student EP
   simulator mission that accomplishes all student required training. (T-2) All student questions
   must be answered and the student mission must be graded appropriately. (T-2)
   3.5.3. Additional Training. For EPEs graded “Q” with additional training, the CSIE will
   indicate whether the additional training must be accomplished before the next mission under
   restrictions in the Comments block of the AF Form 8. (T-2)
   3.5.4. Boldface/CAPs Failure. An incorrect response to a Boldface/CAP situation during
   an EPE requires Q3 EPE grade. (T-2) A simulator instructor who receives a Q3 grade as a
   result of Boldface/CAPs error will not instruct again until a successful reevaluation is
   accomplished (either written, verbally, or in a simulator as determined by the CSIE). (T-2)
   3.5.5. Unqualified EPE. An examinee receiving an unqualified EPE grade (Q3) will be
   placed on supervised status until a successful reevaluation is accomplished. (T-2)
3.6. Supplementary Evaluations. Supplementary evaluations are administrative tools used by
the assigned commander/lead CSI to identify and evaluate implemented solutions to operational
problems, such as negative checkride trends. The form and content of supplementary evaluations
is at the discretion of the commander/lead CSI directing the supplementary evaluation.
   3.6.1. Supplementary evaluations are not qualification evaluations.
AETCI11-203 14 MAY 2014                                                                         33


   3.6.2. The commander/lead CSI directing the evaluation will determine evaluated areas. The
   appropriate stan/eval function (e.g., OGV or squadron stan/eval) will determine the method
   of evaluation, is responsible for administrative management of data collection, and will
   report results as directed by the commander/lead CSI.
   3.6.3. Individuals other than CSIEs as determined by the commander/lead CSI may conduct
   supplementary evaluations.
   3.6.4. Supplementary evaluations may be administered in conjunction with a
   qualification/mission evaluation. Supplementary evaluations should not result in the
   assignment of an overall grade for any specific simulator instructor, nor should it be
   documented on an AF Form 8.
   3.6.5. Supplementary evaluation results will be documented in SEB minutes. (T-2)
3.7. Simulator Instructor Examination Program. The simulator instructor program will use
the unit stan/eval aircrew examination program as outlined in Chapter 6 of AFI 11-202, Volume
2, Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program. (T-1) Units may add simulator instructor
specific questions to the appropriate examinations or develop simulator instructor specific
exams.
3.8. Documentation. Administration of the simulator instructor qualification evaluation
program requires accurate documentation. The qualifications for which a simulator instructor is
to be evaluated are determined from the unit certification document. The results of all simulator
instructor evaluations will be recorded on an AF Form 8. (T-2) The chronological history of
evaluations for a simulator instructor is recorded on an AF Form 942, Record of Evaluation.
(T-2) These AF forms are maintained in the FEF for the simulator instructor. (T-2) (Use of
electronic forms is authorized, to include use of electronic signatures and wholly electronic
FEFs.)
   3.8.1. AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification. Use the AF Form 8 to record
   simulator instructor qualification. The AF Form 8 is signed by four individuals in the
   following order: the CSIE who completes the evaluation, the Reviewing Officer, the Final
   Reviewing Officer and the examinee. (T-2) Exception: For a Commander-Directed
   Downgrade AF Form 8, only the commander/lead CSI directing the downgrade signs as the
   Final Approving Officer.
       3.8.1.1. General Data Entry. Use the following guidance when completing an AF
       Form 8.
           3.8.1.1.1. If an electronic form is used, the format required by the form will be used.
           3.8.1.1.2. For date fields in the AF Form 8 use a two-digit day, three-letter month and
           two-digit year format. (T-3)
           3.8.1.1.3. The Eligibility Period and Expiration Date of Qualification will use a
           three-letter month and two-digit year format. (T-3)
           3.8.1.1.4. To facilitate the entry of data on the form, except where specifically noted
           otherwise, use upper and lower case letters. (T-3)
34                                                              AETCI11-203 14 MAY 2014


        3.8.1.1.5. Requirements for letter font, numbers of spaces for indentation and
        justification (right, left or centered) of data are not specified. Unit supplements may
        direct specific format standards for such data entry.
     3.8.1.2. Date Completed. Use the latest completion date (ground or simulator phase) of
     the evaluation requisites or the additional training. Use this date on the AF Form 942. (T-
     3)
     3.8.1.3. Examinee Identification. Name, Civ or Grade and last four of SSAN. (T-3)
     3.8.1.4. Organization and Location. In order to maintain a consistent record of
     instructor history regardless of the simulator instructor’s actual office symbol, enter the
     unit designation and location where the examinee is assigned/attached for training. (T-3)
     3.8.1.5. Aircraft/Crew Position. Enter the weapon system in which the evaluation was
     given and SI as the crew position. (T-3) Only when a CSIE is receiving a SPOT CSIE
     Objectivity evaluation, should you enter CSIE as the crew position. For simulator
     instructors that are qualified in multiple weapon systems, list all additional weapon
     systems qualified in as a result of the evaluation in the Remarks section, paragraph A,
     following the mission description. (T-3)
     3.8.1.6. Eligibility Period. Enter the 6-month period preceding the expiration date from
     the last similar periodic evaluation (e.g., if the last INSTR/QUAL evaluation expires Sep
     14, enter Apr-Sep 14). (T-3) Enter N/A (not applicable) for INIT, SPOT, and RQ
     evaluations. (T-3)
     3.8.1.7. Qualification.
        3.8.1.7.1. Ground Phase. (If applicable)
            3.8.1.7.1.1. Examination/Check. Make a separate entry for each ground
            requisite examination/ evaluation. (T-3) Discrepancies will be noted in the
            examiner’s remarks. (T-3) If requisites exceed available lines, make combined
            entries or document additional requisite completion in the Comments section.
            Annotate “Instrument” for instrument requisite examination. Annotate “Boldface”

   or a “For Official Use Only” label/stamp on both sides of the FEF folder. (T-0)
   3.9.2. Maintenance. Each simulator instructor must have an FEF, which includes all AF
   Forms 8, AF Forms 942, and any additional unit specified items. (T-2) The FEF should be
   maintained by a stan/eval functional office - normally in the organization to which the
   individual is assigned or attached for training or as defined in the unit supplement. Note: A
   separate simulator FEF is not required for MSIs when an existing FEF is maintained by their
   unit.
   3.9.3. Contents of FEF. Divide the FEF into two sections. (T-3)
       3.9.3.1. (left side). This section contains AF Forms 942, AF Forms and those items
       authorized by the unit supplement to this instruction (e.g., logs of initial and annual
       reviews). (T-3) Section I may contain two tabbed sub-sections. Tabs are optional
          3.9.3.1.1. AF Forms 942 will be placed on top of Tab 1 (when tabs are used), in
          chronological order with the most recent on top. (T-3)
          3.9.3.1.2. Tab 2 (if used) maintain any additional information as directed by the unit
          supplement.
          3.9.3.1.3. If used, file backup electronic storage media in Section I of the FEF.
       3.9.3.2. (right side). This Section contains AF Forms 8 and MFRs for all evaluations
       listed on the AF Form 942 in Section I. (T-3)
          3.9.3.2.1. File AF Forms 8 in chronological order with the most recent on top. (T-3)
          Individuals who maintain qualification in two or more weapon systems will file AF
          Forms 8 in chronological order without consideration of weapon system. (T-3)
          3.9.3.2.2. MFRs documenting waivers are filed on top of the affected AF Form 8. (T-
          3) Incorporate the information contained in the MFR onto the applicable AF Form 8
          under Examiner Remarks paragraph D, Additional Comments, when action is
          complete, and remove the MFR from the FEF. (T-3) Permanent MFRs documenting
          major discrepancies relating to qualification are filed immediately above the latest
          affected AF Form 8 or, in cases where the memo is for items other than those found
          on AF Forms 8, in chronological order with AF Forms 8 (regardless of the date the
          discrepancy is discovered). (T-3)
42                                                                 AETCI11-203 14 MAY 2014


  3.9.4. FEF Discrepancies. FEF Discrepancies include those of the AF Forms 8 and AF
  Form 942. Discrepancies are categorized by their impact on qualification. Discrepancies that
  alter the qualification of the affected CSI are considered major. Those discrepancies that do
  not alter the qualification of the affected CSI are considered minor and include typos,
  formatting and misspellings.
     3.9.4.1. Major Discrepancies. Identified major discrepancies are documented on a
     permanent MFR filed in Section I or II immediately above the affected AF Forms 8/942,
     or in chronological order for items other than those found on AF Forms 8/942. (T-3)
     3.9.4.2. Minor Discrepancies. Minor discrepancies are documented on a non-
     permanent record as defined by the unit supplement to this instruction. (T-3) The record
     of minor discrepancies is to be used to ensure standardization of AF Forms 8/942 and
     simulator instructor FEFs. Record of minor discrepancies will reside in Section I of the
     FEF. (T-3) Any records of minor discrepancies kept in the FEF will be removed prior to
     any permanent change in station. (T-3)
     3.9.4.3. Corrections. As a source document, the AF Form 8 may be corrected by use of
     white-out/over-print or pen and ink alteration of the original document provided the CSIE
     signing Section III of the form initials the correction. If the original CSIE is not available
     after a reasonable effort to obtain his/her initials, priority will then be to obtain the
     reviewing official’s initials first, the approving official (if reviewing official unavailable),
     and finally the squadron commander. AF Forms 942, not being source documents, may
     be altered without restriction to reflect the assignment of the affected simulator instructor
     and the contents of Section II of the FEF.
  3.9.5. Review of FEF. Document the procedures on how to accomplish an initial review
  and how to implement the periodic review of FEFs in the unit supplement to this instruction.
  (T-3)
     3.9.5.1. Initial Review. The unit will review the FEF for all newly assigned CSIs to
     establish their qualification(s) prior to their first sortie. (T-3) The reviewing organization
     is responsible for establishing the qualification of the simulator instructor as determined
     from the latest applicable documentation in Sections I and II of the FEF. Following
     determination of the qualification of the simulator instructor, the unit maintaining the
     FEF is responsible only for documentation subsequently placed in the FEF.
     3.9.5.2. Posting Review. The unit will review each AF Form 8 when they are placed in
     the FEF to ensure accuracy and completeness. (T-3) This review will confirm that the
     eligibility period and qualification as documented are correct, all required evaluation
     events and requisites were accomplished within the eligibility period and that the AF
     Form 8 contains all signatures and initials within the allotted time. Do not log the
     evaluation on the AF Form 942 until the posting review has been accomplished. Posting
     the evaluation on the form 942 signifies the posting review has been completed.
     3.9.5.3. Periodic Review. The unit will review all unit FEFs to confirm expiration dates
     used to track required simulator instructor qualification evaluations are the same as those
     listed in the FEFs. (T-3) The interval between reviews will not exceed the qualification
     period window unless a more restrictive review period is established by the unit
     supplement. (T-3) Document the periodic review IAW unit supplement. (T-3)
AETCI11-203 14 MAY 2014                                                                          43


  3.9.6. Transfer of FEF. When custody of the FEF is transferred to a new unit or base,
  retain all records in the folder until reviewed by the gaining unit. (T-3) After review, return to
  the individual those forms not retained in the folder. (T-3) Simulator instructors will
  normally hand-carry their FEF to the gaining organization. When circumstances prevent this,
  the losing organization will mail the folder to the gaining unit. (T-3) When mailing an FEF or
  any of its contents, retain a copy until the gaining organization has received the original FEF.
  (T-3)
  3.9.7. Computer Generated Forms and Electronic FEFs. Computer generated forms
  must mirror AF Forms. (T-2) If used, electronic copies of the FEF will be forwarded with the
  individual when they move to a new squadron. (T-3) Electronic backups will be maintained
  on removable storage media (e.g., DVD-ROM/CD-ROM). (T-3)
  3.9.8. Disposition of FEF. Dispose of the simulator instructor FEF according to the Air
  Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS). (T-1)

                 BUDDY SIMULATOR INSTRUCTOR (BSI) PROGRAM

A2.1. BSI Program. This program should last approximately 1 to 3 months (minimum of 1
month). New simulator instructors will accomplish training requirements listed in paragraphs
A2.1.1. and A2.1.2. (T-2) Briefings accomplished during QT may be used to fulfill these
requirements.
   A2.1.1. Ground Training. Ground training consists of the following:
       A2.1.1.1. Squadron policies briefing (before training students).
       A2.1.1.2. BSI briefing (before training students).
       A2.1.1.3. Simulator instructor responsibilities briefing (before training students).
       A2.1.1.4. Commander’s review or Commander’s Awareness Program briefing.
       A2.1.1.5. Grading practices briefing.
       A2.1.1.6. CT requirements briefing.
       A2.1.1.7. Scheduling briefing.
       A2.1.1.8. TIMS/GTIMS briefing.
       A2.1.1.9. Grade book briefing.
       A2.1.1.10. Flying safety briefing.
       A2.1.1.11. Stan/eval briefing.
       A2.1.1.12. Check section briefing
       A2.1.1.13. Completing EP simulator
       A2.1.1.14. Completing open book syllabus test (locally generated).
       A2.1.1.15. Completing open book course training standards test (locally generated).
       A2.1.1.16. Completing IRC.
   A2.1.2. Simulator Training.
       A2.1.2.1. BSI Sorties. BSI sorties are student sorties accomplished by the new
       simulator instructor with the BSI monitoring. All BSI sorties will be accomplished with
       the assigned BSI, a flight unit stan/eval monitor (USEM), a CSIE, or any supervisor
       (assistant flight commander or above) in the new simulator instructor’s chain of
       command monitoring performance. (T-2) The objective of these flights is to further
       develop the new simulator instructor’s proficiency and instructional techniques. On each
       BSI sortie, the BSI will discuss instructional techniques, planning profiles, student
       progress, grading practices, local flying policies, common student errors, and possible
       pitfalls the new simulator instructor should avoid. (T-3) These sorties will be documented
       in the new simulator instructor’s BSI record. (T-3) At least one BSI sortie will be flown
       in each category of training. (T-2)
