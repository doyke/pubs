     Fire Prevention. Once the Assistant Chief determines the viability, and tentatively
     approves the request, the requester shall coordinate the request through the offices
     indicated in the return email using the AF Form 1768, Staff Summary Sheet.
     9.12.3. The default minimum required coordination are the Fire Prevention, Safety and
     Bio-Environmental Engineer offices, but each permit is a standalone document for a
     specific facility or event.
  9.13. Public Fire Education
934AWI32-2001 21 APRIL 2014                                                                     13


       9.13.1. Fire safety education is an essential part of workplace safety training, and is
       promoted during fire inspections and other personal contacts. It may be tailored for
       specific audiences and purposes, such as fire extinguisher training or public assembly
       employee training. Fire safety education objectives are to equip personnel with the
       information needed to prevent fires, protect themselves and intervene early when fire
       occurs.
       9.13.2. Fire Prevention Week (normally the first week of October) is a nationally
       established period to provide fire safety education to employees, their families and the
       public. The fire prevention office shall develop an event to publicize the annual fire
       safety message.
10. Aircraft Hangar Usage for Public Assembly Purposes: The occupancy classification for
an aircraft hangar is industrial. The National Fire Prevention Association (NFPA) Standard 101,
the Life Safety Code, Section 3.3.178.8, defines an Industrial Occupancy as “an occupancy in
which products are manufactured or in which processing, assembling, mixing, packaging,
finishing, decorating, or repair operations are conducted”. This description fits the normal usage
for the 934 MXG Hangar’s B821 and B870. The NFPA further delineates an industrial
occupancy as General Industrial Occupancy, High Hazard Industrial Occupancy, or Special
Purpose Industrial. The aircraft hangars used by the 934th Airlift Wing are Special Purpose
Industrial occupancies with high hazard contents. When an industrial occupancy operates as
assembly occupancy, it does so as festival seating. NFPA 101, Section 3.3.221.1, defines
festival seating as a form of audience/spectator accommodation in which there is no seating,
other than a floor or finished ground level, for the audience/spectators gathered to observe a
performance.
   10.1. Conditions for Hangar Usage as Public Assembly
       10.1.1. NFPA 13.2.5.4.1 defines the conditions under which the Authority Having
       Jurisdiction (AHJ), the BCE can approve festival seating. Specifically, “in assembly
       occupancies where occupant loads exceed 250; if there is an approved life safety
       evaluation”. This section of 934AWI32-2001 outlines the conditions under which 934
       MXG may use the hangar under their control as public assembly occupancies
       10.1.2. The 934 MSG/CEF will provide fire safety training for the MXG as requested.
       10.1.3. MAC Fire’s response plans for fires in the hangars contain automatic calls for
       mutual aid to the surrounding communities; MXG will need to inform the BDOC of any
       event where there are a large number of people in the Hangar.
       10.1.4. The 934 AW/MXG must develop and designate a group of individuals whose
       responsibility is operation of doors, event configuration, and occupant egress facilitation.
   10.2. High Expansion Foam (HEX) System
       10.2.1. Prior to the use of either B821 or B870 as public assembly occupancies, the high
       expansion foam firefighting systems in the facilities must have their foam inductor’s
       disabled. 934MSG/CEO utilities section has the overall responsibility for operational
       maintenance of the HEX systems. This includes removing them from and restoring them
       to service. No outside agency is allowed access to the HEX systems without prior,
       expressed written permission from the BCE.
14                                                          934AWI32-2001 21 APRIL 2014


         10.2.1.1. MXG must provide the 934 MSG/CEO a schedule of when they need the
         foam valves isolated which will disable the foam inductor, which in turn eliminates
         the foam engulfment hazard. The schedule will also indicate a time when 934
         MSG/CEO can restore the system to full service; this facilitates the scheduling of
         technicians for the operations
  10.3. Occupant Load
     10.3.1. The festival seating maximum occupant load in either B821 or B870 is 1300-
     people.
  10.4. Configuration Requirement
     10.4.1. The following is the B821 configuration requirement with an aircraft in hangar.
     The MXG will set the stage in the middle of the hangar with the egress paths directly
     behind the formation (the aircraft location will determine the direction of egress). B870
     cannot have an aircraft in the hangar during an assembly.
     10.4.2. There must be a clearly defined event area and exit corridors.
     10.4.3. The minimum event area for the maximum occupant load is 9100 sqft (91’ x
     100’). In B821, the stage must face north or south depending upon the presence of an
     aircraft in one of the hangar parking spots.
     10.4.4. One egress corridor on each side (Southeast and Southwest) of the event area
     leading to the existing corridors
  10.5. Facilitation of Occupant Egress
     10.5.1. At all B821 or B870 events, the MXG will provide one person for each of the
     closed powered rolling hangar doors bordering the formation (a total of two-personnel).
     These individuals shall function as safety monitors and in the event of fire alarm
     activation, they shall initiate the opening of the doors, facilitating the egress of all
     personnel.
  10.6. Equipment Safety
     10.6.1. MXG must segregate and safety all equipment (powered or otherwise) from the
     occupants.
  10.7. Occupant Fire Safety Briefing
     10.7.1. At the start of an event, a representative shall make an announcement that details
     the steps the occupants should take in the event of an emergency, the areas considered
     off-limits, the egress corridors, and the assembly point for accountability.

       SUPERVISOR'S ANNUAL FIRE PREVENTION REFRESHER HANDOUT

A6.1. The object of this briefing is to outline individual duties and responsibilities in the
prevention of injury or loss of life or property due to fires while working on this Air Force
Station.
A6.2. The prevention of fires is everyone's duty. All personnel must read the 934 AWI 32-2001,
Base Fire Protection Program. Your supervisor can get a copy for your review. Fire
instructions state that "individuals may be held liable for any violation of fire prevention rules or
practices", so it behooves us to read and understand them.
A6.3. Every employee should know what to do when they discover a fire, how to report it, how
to evacuate a building, and use an extinguisher to fight the fire. The best way to fight a fire is to
stop it before it starts; "Fire Prevention." If everyone recognized fire hazards and reported or
corrected them at once, most fires would be stopped before they started. "Fire Hazard" what is
it? It is a condition or situation, which if not corrected could lead to a fire causing injury or loss
of life and property. Some examples are trash, oil, or paintsmeared rags not placed in proper
containers, leaking or open flammable liquid containers, frayed or cracked electric wiring,
multiple electrical connections causing overloaded circuits, smoking in a no smoking area, and
cigarette butts put in trash cans. If everyone knew and took action upon finding a fire hazard,
fires would be reduced to a minimum. All it takes is a call to Base Civil Engineering, ext. 1918,
or telling your supervisor or facility manager.
A6.4. What should you do if you find a fire on base or in your work area? Most important is to
sound the alarm to warn others and call the fire department. Shout “FIRE" and trip the fire
evacuation alarm pull station in the building, call the fire department by dialing Security Police,
ext. 911. When reporting a fire by telephone, give name, organization, location of fire, and
building number, also type of fire, like building, auto, aircraft, or flammable liquid. By all
means let others in the building know where there is a fire; saving of life is most important;
buildings and property can be replaced. Find out where the fire alarm pull stations are located.
Be sure you know where all exits and emergency exits are located; this is a must for your own
safety. Know the location of the fire extinguishers in your area and how to operate and use them.
If there is any doubt about their operation or use, ask your supervisor who will either explain or
arrange for fire prevention section to do so. In case of a fire, no matter how small or what type,
sound alarm and call fire department before trying to put it out. The heat buildup and spread of
fire is fast; a few seconds can be the difference in containing a fire in one room or total burning
of a building. If we are fire minded and do our bit, we can make this the most fire safe base in
the Air Force.
A6.5. Fire Extinguisher Training: Every employee shall either complete an initial or refresher
fire extinguisher class. All new employees will contact with Assistant Chief for Fire Prevention
to schedule a hands on fire extinguisher training class. Annual refresher classes can be
accomplished by section supervisors. The supervisor or designated individual can sign out the
Fire Extinguisher Training video or complete the Fire Extinguisher power point presentation of
the base homepage. Upon completion a signed roster will be forwarded to the Assistant Chief
for Fire Prevention.
