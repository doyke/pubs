      2.3.1. Manage the exercise program.
      2.3.2. Use commander’s inputs, applicable OPLANs, contingency and local plans,
      previous exercise reports, MAJCOM special interest items, and inspector general findings
      from previous inspections to determine primary exercise objectives.
      2.3.3. Determine the basic scenario to satisfy the objectives.
      2.3.4. Obtain approval from wing commanders on the date and time of exercises.
      2.3.5. Coordinate with 75th Air Base Wing Safety Office (75 ABW/SE) to review safety
      issues.

       scenarios.
       2.4.3. Review AFI 90-201 and ACC Supplement 1 Addendum-A, AFMCI 90-202,
       Command Level Inspector General Inspection Activities, Hill Base-X Plan, Operations

       ABW/XP SharePoint site.
       2.4.4. Maintain a functional area continuity book containing applicable instructions,
       report writing guidance, appropriate simulations, and copies of each EET member’s
       appointment letter, training certificates, as well unit specific information.
       2.4.5. Develop specific exercise objectives and scenario inputs to test functional areas

       2.4.6. Publish MSEL exercise scenarios. Units will not conduct exercise play unless the
       event is listed on the MSEL and coordinated with the EET Team Chief during planning
       meetings.
       2.4.7. Conduct team meetings to establish individual assignments and schedules to
       ensure that exercise play is evaluated and safety considerations are monitored.
       2.4.8. Ensure applicable actions are evaluated per AFI 90-201 and written evaluations
       sent to their EET Team Chief using format provided.
       2.4.9. Accept taskings from EET Team Chief to work on ad hoc working groups, i.e.
       EM, Ability to Survive and Operate (ATSO), Mobility, Wartime Materiel Support
       (WMS), and Standard Air Munitions Package and Standard Tanks, Racks and Pylon
       Package.
       2.4.10. Notify 75 ABW/XP or 388 FW/XP of any changes to their team’s composition.
       2.4.11. Attend exercise EET planning meetings scheduled by the EET Team Chief.
       2.4.12. Coordinate with directors or commanders at the directorate or wing level or
       equivalent if scenarios require disruption of normal work schedules. Some examples are
HILLAFBI90-201 19 August 2010                                                               5


     evacuation of buildings, suspicious packages, bomb threats, fire drills, and 75 Security
     Forces Squadron (75 SFS) response scenarios.
     2.4.13. Handle MSELs as “Trusted Agent Material”.
     2.4.14. Prepare exercise input cards, evaluation sheets, and placards (if applicable)
     utilizing the MSEL database.
     2.4.15. Ensure scenarios are taken to a logical, coordinated conclusion.
     2.4.16. Prevent any “off-script” events from taking place.
     2.4.17. Attend the EET hot wash following every exercise to review significant exercise
     events and coordinate with outside agencies on potential findings affecting other units.
     2.4.18. Ensure EET Team Chief approves any deviations from the MSEL prior to
     deviation occurrence.
3. PAUSEX, RESUMEX, and ENDEX
  3.1. EET Team Chiefs have exercise control responsibilities including broad discretionary
  authority regarding-exercise timelines and event execution. While members must constantly
  monitor safety and security concerns, only wing commanders and EET Team Chiefs can
  declare PAUSEX and RESUMEX. Members who need to halt a particular action that will
  result in an unsafe condition or security violation can, and will, do so. The EET Team Chief
  will be back briefed as soon as the deficiency is corrected and operations resumed. Exercise
  events that were paused may be resumed; when time permits canceled MSELs may be added
  back into the exercise.
  3.2. Definitions:
     3.2.1. PAUSEX definition: The halt or temporary hold to any or all exercise activity for
     any number of reasons to include safety, security, weather, or any real world
     incident/event.
     3.2.2. RESUMEX definition: The resumption of exercise play activity.
     3.2.3. ENDEX definition: The termination of exercise activity.
  3.3. The following procedures apply for PAUSEX, RESUMEX, and ENDEX:
     3.3.1. Notification for a complete PAUSEX during an exercise will be by cellular,
     landline, radio, published Installation Control Center Directives, and/or announced
     through the Hill “Giant Voice” system by the Installation Control Center
     (ICC)/Emergency Operations Center (EOC) or Hill Consolidated Command Post.
     3.3.2. Resuming an exercise after a PAUSEX is the responsibility of the 75 ABW/XP or
     388 FW/XP Team Chiefs. Once the source or condition that generated the call to
     PAUSEX has been identified and mitigated or eliminated, and it has been determined by
     the initiator of the PAUSEX that the exercise can safely be resumed, they will notify the
     75 ABW/XP or 388 FW/XP Team Chiefs of their determination and recommendation to
     resume the exercise. The 75 ABW/XP or 388 FW/XP Team Chiefs will notify the
     ICC/EOC to RESUMEX. The exercise team leads will determine a reference time to
     restart the exercise as required to accommodate exercise events, timing criteria, and
     coordination of follow-on MSEL inject timing.
6                                                    HILLAFBI90-201 19 August 2010


    3.3.3. ENDEX is the termination of an exercise; no other exercise activity will take
    place. EETs are not authorized to declare ENDEX. The 75 ABW/XP Team Chief or 388
    FW/XP (depending on stand alone or combined play) recommends termination to the
    ICC/EOC Director when Operational Readiness Exercise (ORE) objectives are met. The
    final decision to ENDEX is made by the wing commanders or designated representative.
    Units will be relieved/released from exercise duties through their chain of command.
