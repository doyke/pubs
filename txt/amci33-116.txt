The purpose of this instruction is to set the standard for reporting the operational status of Air Mobility
Command (AMC) Air Traffic Control and Landing Systems (ATCALS), which includes RADAR Sys-
tems, Airfield/Navigational Aid Systems, Weather Systems, and Airfield Communications Systems. This
instruction supersedes all other polices of the same subject and is in effect until superseded by an AMC
Supplement to AFI 21-116, Maintenance Management of Communications-Electronics. Reporting proce-
dures below do not replace equipment status reporting under the equipment status reporting subsystem,
Integrated Maintenance Data System (IMDS) (replaced Core Automated Maintenance System) or opera-
tion reporting under AFMAN 10-206, Operational Reporting.
Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in
accordance with AFMAN 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air
Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at https://afrims.amc.af.mil/.

2. Responsibilities.
   2.1. AMC Base responsibilities
       2.1.1. When any of the aforementioned systems fail (RED - Not Usable status) or go in a partially
       capable operational status (AMBER - Degraded status), the maintenance operations center/com-
       munications focal point will provide equipment status to the AMC MAJCOM/Air Force Commu-
       nication Coordination Center (M/ACCC). Initial notification will be via telephone or email in
       accordance with the timing criteria detailed in Attachment 2. Use the AMC ATCALS Worksheet
       at Attachment 3 as a base-level tool to ensure necessary information is gathered prior to notifying
       the AMC M/ACCC.
           2.1.1.1. To contact the AMC M/ACCC, call DSN 576-1332/commercial 618-256-1332 for
           unclassified reporting or contact the AMC M/ACCC STE at DSN 576-8007/commercial
           618-256-8007 for classified reporting.
           2.1.1.2. Email: An email shall be sent to the AMC M/ACCC organization box on SIPRNET
           to amc.maccc@amc.smil.af.mil.
              2.1.1.2.1. The email subject line will be the base name followed by the system in question
              followed by a description of the outage (or incident/degradation/conflict, etc.). Example:
              “Scott ILS Degradation”.
              2.1.1.2.2. Classification. An ATCALS outage is normally unclassified; however, an out-
              age becomes classified by association of stated mission impact, classified location, or
              other user-specified classified information. All email messages must comply with DODI
              5200.1-R, Information Security Program, AFI 31-401, Information Security Program
              Management, and SAF Memo, dated 30 May 2006, Subject: Implementation of New Clas-
              sification Marking Requirements. The message editor will ensure that the document has
              proper classification markings.
       2.1.2. After exhausting organic capability to resolve an issue, units should request special mainte-
       nance team (SMT) assistance from AMC/A6OS (ATCALS Branch). To do so, contact AMC M/
       ACCC via aforementioned phone number/email address, 24x7. The AMC M/ACCC will route/
       track requested SMT action to AMC/A6OS.

       2.1.3. Units will fill out a Significant Outage Report (Attachment 4) and send to AMC M/ACCC
       via SIPR email (amc.maccc@amc.af.smil.mil) by local COB every duty day. This is an overall
       big picture of a base’s ATCALS status; therefore, the information provided in this report should
       contain any fix actions for incidents that closed throughout the previous 24 hours, and the
       real-time status of any open tickets with detailed notes of the last 24 hours’ progress.
    2.2. AMC M/ACCC responsibilities
       2.2.1. When the AMC M/ACCC receives an initial outage or degradation report and/or a Signifi-
       cant Outage Report from the bases, the AMC M/ACCC will forward these to AMC/A6OS and
       AMC/A3AR.
       2.2.2. The AMC M/ACCC will maintain situational awareness and report the status of AMC base
       ATCALS to the AMC/A6 and the 375 CG/CC.
       2.2.3. The AMC M/ACCC will coordinate any discrepancies between the AMC ATCALS Work-
       sheets and the Significant Outage Report each day. Any newly opened incident requiring an AMC
       ATCALS Worksheet should be contained as a current outage or closed outage in the daily Signif-
       icant Outage Report.
    2.3. AMC/A6OS responsibilities:
       2.3.1. The A6OS will assist bases with ATCALS repairs when needed by means of special main-
       tenance teams or other resources at their disposal.
       2.3.2. The A6OS will provide assistance to the AMC M/ACCC in the event that clarification is
       necessary for any outages or degradations.
