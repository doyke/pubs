                                             Chapter 1

                                            GENERAL

1.1. Scope and Purpose
     1.1.1. The purpose of this instruction is to establish procedures to govern all vehicle
     operations on the airfield. Only trained personnel will be assigned duties that include driving
     on the airfield. Trained personnel must have the necessary knowledge base to comply with
     this instruction. The use of vehicles on the airfield will be limited to the absolute minimum
     necessary to accomplish the mission. Safe operation of vehicles on the airfield is absolutely
     essential to normal aircraft operations and maintenance.
     1.1.2. Vehicles present a clear and definite danger to both aircraft and ground personnel.
     Carelessness, haste, and a disregard for established safety standards are major factors in
     aircraft/vehicle collisions, incidents, and personal injuries. Airfield drivers must be familiar

          3.2.1.5.5. A simulation of radio communications between a vehicle operator and
          Control Tower.
   3.2.2. Personnel requiring CMA access must also take an Airfield Communications test
   administered by AMOPS. This test consists of 5 questions and a passing score of 100% is
   required.
3.3. Test Failures.
   3.3.1. First time failures must receive additional training from the unit ADPM. Trainees can
   be rescheduled for testing upon completion of additional training but no earlier than 3 days
   from the failure.
   3.3.2. Second time failures must receive additional training from the unit ADPM and
   document on a memorandum for record, endorsed by the unit commander (may not be
   delegated) with justification stating the trainee is safe for airfield operations. Trainees can be
   rescheduled for testing upon completion of additional training and the commander’s
   endorsement letter but no earlier than 10 days from the second failure.

   3.3.3. Third time failures will normally not be granted airfield driving privileges without the
   approval of the AFM or DAFM.
3.4. AF IMT 483 Issuance. All base assigned personnel (e.g., military, DoD civilian,
Contractor, etc.) required to operate a vehicle on the Luke AFB Airfield must complete all
airfield drivers’ training and testing requirements outlined in AFI 13-213 and this instruction
prior to issuance of an AF IMT 483. Note: AFSC or career field training (e.g., aircraft
maintenance, aircrew, fire and emergency services, security forces, transportation, etc.) is not a
substitute for completion of airfield driving training and testing requirements outlined in this
instruction.
   3.4.1. Unit ADPMs will ensure the training requirements from Section III of Luke AFB
   Form 39 are completely signed off and certify completion of training by signing Section VI
   of the form. The ADPM will also ensure that all airfield restrictions (e.g., daytime only or no
   CMA access) are annotated.
   3.4.2. Individuals will bring a copy of the completed and endorsed Luke AFB Form 39 to
   AMOPS, along with a copy of their Airfield Driving CBT certificate and their written test
   score sheet. Personnel requiring access to the CMA will also be required to provide a CMA
   authorization letter endorsed by the unit Commander. Note: If the unit Commander has
   delegated certification authority, the unit ADPM may endorse the authorization letter.
   Personnel requiring CMA access will be administered an Airfield Communications Test
   IAW paragraph 3.2.2.
   3.4.3. Paperwork will be dropped off at AMOPS for processing. The AF IMT 483 and all
   paperwork will be available for pickup the next duty day. AMOPS personnel are the only
   authorized personnel that can sign the AF IMT 483 and will not be delegated outside of
   Airfield Management.
   3.4.4. As a quality control measure, approximately 10% of individuals that come in to
   AMOPS for their AF IMT 483 will be administered a General Knowledge, Runway
   Incursion Prevention, and Airfield Layout Spot Test.
       3.4.4.1. Failure of these tests will be handled in the same manner as test failures
       identified in paragraph 3.3.
   3.4.5. Personnel who PCS, separate, or retire must turn in their AF IMT 483 to their unit
   ADPM. The ADPM will ensure that they update their master listing of qualified drivers. The
   ADPM will return the Luke AFB Form 39 to the individual.
   3.4.6. When personnel PCA between units on base, the losing ADPM ensures all airfield
   driving records (Luke AFB Form 39, CBT printout, etc) are transferred to the gaining unit
   ADPM. The losing ADPM removes the individual from the unit’s list of airfield drivers.
   The gaining ADPM will verify currency of the individual’s training and transcribe
   information to a new Luke AFB Form 39 for the new unit. The new ADPM will add the
   individual to the list of qualified unit personnel. The individual will report to AMOPS with
   both old and new records. AMOPS will endorse the new Luke AFB Form 39 and update the
   master driver list. After the new form is endorsed, the old form will be destroyed.

   3.4.7. Personnel who lose their AF IMT 483 can be reissued a new one by hand carrying the
   original Luke AFB Form 39 and a current Airfield Driving CBT certificate to AMOPS.
   AMOPS will verify training/testing documentation and issue a new AF IMT 483.
   3.4.8. Personnel who lose their Luke AFB Form 39 and still have a valid AF IMT 483 for
   Luke AFB may be recertified to drive on airfield by the unit ADPM. The ADPM will
   complete a new Luke AFB Form 39 and make a statement on the form to indicate it is a
   replacement for a lost original and verify all training requirements are current.
   3.4.9. Runway access will only be allowed when mission requirements dictate and will be
   annotated on the AF IMT 483 when issued. All other personnel will have an AF IMT 483
   with restrictions annotated on the AF IMT 483 (e.g., PARKING RAMP ONLY or
   FLIGHTLINE ROAD ONLY). Personnel with an AF IMT 483 before the date of this
   instruction will be “grandfathered” until annual refresher training is due. After completing
   annual refresher training all personnel will be issued a license with the appropriate
   restrictions by Airfield Management.
       3.4.9.1. Personnel with restrictions will coordinate with the ADPM and AMOPS for a
       new AF IMT 483 when access to additional areas is required.
       3.4.9.2. Restrictions will be annotated on the Luke AFB Form 39.
3.5. Color Vision Testing.
   3.5.1. Color vision testing is for approved CMA airfield drivers only. Use Attachment 5,
   Section III for official documentation of results from the appropriate Hospital/Medical
   Treatment Facility Optometrist or off-base equivalent to the unit ADPM for verification. The
   unit ADPM must maintain documentation and provide to the Wing ADPM upon request.
   3.5.2. Note: An Officer/Enlisted Classification Directory and an approved memorandum
   listing of Enlisted AFSCs with a normal color vision requirement (provided by the
   Optometry Clinic/Flight Doc) will be maintained by the Wing ADPM and provided to unit
   ADPMs. Unit ADPMs must validate whether drivers within the unit have AFSCs listed in the
   Classification Directory and/or on the approved memorandum listing. Unit ADPMs must
   also ensure approved CMA drivers have normal color vision and/or no waiver to standards
   before drivers are shown as “exempt” on Attachment 5, Section III. If normal color vision
   cannot be validated as indicated above, the CMA airfield driver must accomplish color vision
   testing as indicated in 3.5.3.
   3.5.3. The Optometry Clinic will conduct color vision screening on a walk-in basis between
   the hours of 0730L-1630L, Mon-Fri for all personnel in support of the ADP.
   3.5.4. In cases where an individual fails the color the vision test, the unit ADPM will
   coordinate with the DAFM for a “Limited Access” AF IMT 483. The AFM will evaluate the
   requirement and grant the “Limited Access” AF IMT 483 if warranted. The AF IMT 483
   will be annotated with the appropriate restriction(s). Note: Access to the CMAs will not be
   granted to personnel who fail the color vision test.

                                          Chapter 4

                    OPERATING PROCEDURES AND STANDARDS

4.1. Procedures and standards for operating a vehicle on the airfield.
   4.1.1. All personnel on the airfield are responsible for monitoring airfield safety, detecting
   unauthorized personnel/vehicles and immediately reporting airfield violations to Airfield
   Management Operations (AMOPS) and/or the Security Forces Control Center (SFCC). If
   necessary, the SFCC will dispatch a patrol to apprehend violators. The AFM or DAFM will
   determine appropriate action, to include suspension of airfield driving privileges, and
   notification of the individual’s commander.
   4.1.2. Personnel driving on the airfield must complete airfield driver’s training or be
   escorted by a vehicle driver possessing a valid AF IMT 483 prior to entry to the airfield.
   4.1.3. Units sponsoring TDY personnel or non-base assigned contractors are responsible for
   providing training or an escort that possesses a valid AF IMT 483.
4.2. Procedures and standards for operating a vehicle on the CMA.
   4.2.1. The CMA encompasses all active runways, overruns and the area within 100 feet
   laterally from the edge of the runways; taxiways A, F, J; and the Interior Access Road.
   4.2.2. No vehicle operator or pedestrian may enter the CMA without specific approval from
   the ATCT. Exception: Vehicles and/or pedestrians may be escorted into the CMA by an
   AF IMT 483 licensed vehicle and/or pedestrian that has two-way radio contact with the
   ATCT.
   4.2.3. Radio contact with the Control Tower must be established before gaining access to,
   crossing, or working in the CMA. Once Control Tower approves access, radio contact will be
   maintained at all times while in CMA.
   4.2.4. Vehicle drivers and/or pedestrians must read back all ATC instructions verbatim.
   4.2.5. Vehicle operators and/or pedestrians must always monitor the appropriate radio
   frequency when in the CMA.
   4.2.6. Vehicle operators must use LED/rotating beacon lights and/or emergency flashers
   when driving in the CMA.
   4.2.7. Vehicles operating in the CMA on a daily basis should have a permanent radio
   mounted in the vehicle to communicate with the ATCT. A hand-held radio should only be
   used as a backup or when communication is required outside the vehicle. Note: Conduct an
   operational test of the radio before entering the airfield.
   4.2.8. Vehicle drivers and/or pedestrians operating on the CMA will use distinct call signs
   identified in Attachment 7. Call signs for TDY or non-base assigned contract personnel will
   be coordinated by the DAFM to avoid duplicating, confusing, or different agencies using
   similar names (e.g., Airfield 1, Airfield Lighting, Airfield Sweeper, etc.).
   4.2.9. ATC will not issue or use unconditional instructions (blanket approval) when
   authorizing vehicles to enter the runway or CMAs.
20                                                  LUKEAFBI13-213 26 JANUARY 2012


  4.2.10. Runway crossings are restricted to personnel performing mission essential duties and
  then only to an absolute minimum. The departure end of the runways is the preferred
  crossing point during wing flying operations.
  4.2.11. In the event of a vehicle or ATCT radio failure, the following procedures will be
  implemented:
     4.2.11.1. ATCT will flash the runway edge lights on and off to alert vehicle
     operators/pedestrians on the runway that there is a problem and/or emergency that
     requires them to immediately exit the runway.
     4.2.11.2. All vehicle operators/pedestrians must exit the runway immediately. Contact
     ATCT or AM immediately and advise off the runway and include any pertinent
     information that might affect safe runway operations. If not able to communicate with
     ATCT or AM via radio, use other means of communication such as a cellular phone
     (when available). Immediately report the incident to AM.
  4.2.12. Uncontrolled CMA Procedures.
     4.2.12.1. When ATCT is closed, the CMA becomes an uncontrolled movement area.
     Vehicles and other operators will use extreme caution when operating on the airfield due
     to the potential for aircraft landing and operating on the airfield at any time.
     4.2.12.2. Any activity on the airfield after hours will be coordinated through the SFCC
     prior to access. Individuals will provide location, duration and type of activity
     performed.
     4.2.12.3. Airfield access is restricted to authorized personnel who have been trained and
     licensed to drive on the airfield (Luke AFB Airfield Certified, AF IMT 483). Unqualified
     personnel must have an escort.
     4.2.12.4. Personnel driving on the airfield during uncontrolled periods will maintain two-
     way radio capability and will monitor the appropriate tower/ground frequency at all
     times. Personnel will follow all airfield operating rules as outlined in this instruction
     even when the tower is closed.
     4.2.12.5. Crossing or entering the runways will be kept to an absolute minimum, and will
     only be for performance of official duties. Access roads will be used whenever possible,
     even if that means taking a longer route.
         4.2.12.5.1. Drivers will ensure there are no aircraft in the immediate vicinity by
         performing a thorough visual check of the overhead traffic pattern and surrounding
         area. Operate vehicle emergency flashers/beacons while on the runways.
         4.2.12.5.2. Vehicle operators will attempt to contact the Control Tower prior to
         entering or crossing the runways. If there is no response, operators will make a
         general announcement of their activity (e.g., “Airfield lighting is proceeding on
         Runway 21L at Taxiway Bravo”). Likewise, when vehicle operators exit the runway,
         they will make an announcement.
     4.2.12.6. When the airfield opens in the morning at 0630, or prior to opening on
     weekends and holidays, ATC will make a general announcement via the ramp net
LUKEAFBI13-213 26 JANUARY 2012                                                                  21


      indicating that the airfield is open. They will then poll all personnel within the CMA and
      all personnel working on the airfield will respond with call sign and location.
4.3. Radio Communications.
   4.3.1. Radio communications are a critical link in the ATC system. The single most
   important thought in communications with the ATCT is understanding. It is essential to
   acknowledge each radio communication with controllers by using the appropriate call sign.
   4.3.2. Proper radio communications phraseology, discipline, and techniques will be used at
   all times. The words "clear" or “clearance” will not be used in communication with ATCT.
   Exception: Vehicle operators may reply “Loud and Clear” in response to an ATCT request
   for radio transmission quality or clarity.
   4.3.3. Brevity is important, therefore, radio transmissions must be kept as brief as possible.
   However, controllers must know what you want to do before they can properly carry out their
   control duties. Conversely, the vehicle operator must know exactly what the controller wants
   them to do.
   4.3.4. Vehicle operators must maintain vigilance in monitoring air traffic control radio
   communications frequencies for situational awareness, especially when operating on an
   active runway.
   4.3.5. Listen before transmitting. If someone else is talking, the keying of another transmitter
   will be ineffective and will probably override/block out the other receiver causing the other
   vehicle operator to repeat his or her call.
   4.3.6. Think before keying the transmitter. You must know exactly what you need to say
   before you say it.
   4.3.7. The microphone should be very close to your lips and, after pressing the “microphone
   button”, a slight pause may be necessary to be sure the first word is transmitted clearly.
   Speak in a normal, conversational tone.
   4.3.8. When releasing the microphone button, wait a few seconds before calling again. The
   controller may be looking for you on the airfield, transmitting on a different frequency, or
   scanning the runway to enable your request.
   4.3.9. Be alert to the sounds or the lack of sounds in the receiver. Check your volume,
   recheck your frequency, and make sure that your microphone is not stuck in the transmit
   position. Frequency blockage can, and has, occurred for extended periods due to
   unintentional transmitter operation. This type of interference is commonly referred to as a
   “stuck mike,” and controllers may refer to it in this manner when attempting to correct the
   problem.
   4.3.10. Use caution when using a vehicle mounted/handheld radio and operating a vehicle at
   the same time. When possible, only use the radio when the vehicle is safely parked.
   4.3.11. Vehicle operators must contact the ATCT controller each and every time they
   proceed onto or leave the CMA. When proceeding onto a CMA, vehicle operators must
   advise the controller of three things: WHO you are, WHERE you are, and WHAT your
   intentions are. Vehicle operators must always acknowledge all communications so ground
 22                                                  LUKEAFBI13-213 26 JANUARY 2012


   control and other persons know that the message was received. Vehicle operators must
   always give aircraft and ground control transmissions priority unless an emergency exists.
      4.3.11.1. A typical runway crossing transmission sequence is as follows:

Table 4.1. Sample Runway Crossing Phraseology.
VEHICLE OPERATOR:                              “LUKE GROUND AIRFIELD ONE”
ATCT:                                          “AIRFIELD ONE, LUKE GROUND”
VEHICLE OPERATOR:                              “LUKE GROUND, AIRFIELD ONE
                                               REQUEST PERMISSION TO CROSS
                                               RUNWAY 21 LEFT AT TAXIWAY JULIET”
ATCT:                                          “AIRFIELD ONE, PROCEED ACROSS 21
                                               LEFT AT TAXIWAY JULIET” or “AIRFIELD
                                               ONE HOLD SHORT OF 21 LEFT AT
                                               TAXIWAY JULIET.”
      4.3.11.2. Always read back instructions verbatim before taking any action and allow
      time for correction, if misinterpreted. If you are unsure what the controller has
      transmitted, or if you do not understand an instruction, you MUST ask the controller to
      repeat it. Good communications only occur when each party knows and understands
      what the other is saying.

Table 4.2. Sample Read Back Instructions.
VEHICLE OPERATOR:                              “AIRFIELD ONE UNDERSTANDS
                                               APPROVED TO CROSS RUNWAY 21 LEFT
Note: Airfield 1 visually scans the runway     AT TAXIWAY JULIET, WILL REPORT WHEN
prior to entry, then proceeds across the       OFF” or “AIRFIELD ONE HOLDING
runway                                         SHORT OF 21 LEFT AT TAXIWAY JULIET.”
VEHICLE OPERATOR:                              “LUKE GROUND, AIRFIELD ONE IS OFF
                                               RUNWAY 21 LEFT AT TAXIWAY JULIET”
ATCT:                                          “AIRFIELD ONE, LUKE GROUND COPIES
                                               OFF RUNWY 21 LEFT, REMAIN OFF.”
      4.3.11.3. If vehicle operators are issued hold short instructions, they are required to
      provide a read back to the ATCT.

Table 4.3. Sample Hold Short Instructions.
ATCT:                                          “AIRFIELD THREE PROCEED ACROSS
                                               RUNWAY 21 LEFT AT JULIET, HOLD
                                               SHORT OF RUNWAY 21 RIGHT.”
VEHICLE OPERATOR:                              “AIRFIELD THREE, ROGER.”
ATCT:                                          “AIRFIELD THREE, READ BACK HOLD
                                               INSTRUCTIONS.”
VEHICLE OPERATOR:                              “AIRFIELD THREE PROCEEDING ACROSS
                                               RUNWAY 21 LEFT AT JULIET, HOLDING

      4.3.11.4. Phonetic Aviation Alphabet. Because some letters have similar sounds, like B
      and P, the international aviation industry uses the following words to reduce confusion.
      For example, Taxiway B would be referred to as Taxiway Bravo on the radio. Vehicle
      operators must know and use the following Phonetic Aviation Alphabet:

Figure 4.2. Information Sign.




   4.5.2. Airfield markings.
      4.5.2.1. Runway Side Stripe Markings. Solid white lines running the length of the
      runway denote the runway edge.
      4.5.2.2. Dashed white lines running down middle of the runway indicate the runway
      centerline.
      4.5.2.3. White numbers at the ends of each runway indicate the runway designation.
      4.5.2.4. VFR Hold Position Markings. VFR hold positions are located at least 100 feet
      from the edge of runways on all taxiways leading to the runway. The markings consist of
      four parallel yellow stripes perpendicular to the axis of taxiway centerline (or runway
      edge), extending across the taxiway, including the shoulders (see figure 4.3.). The two
      stripes closest to the runway are dashed lines and other two are solid lines. These lines
      mark the boundary of the CMA. Vehicles will not cross runway hold positions or proceed
      onto the runway without obtaining permission from the Control Tower.

Figure 4.3. VFR Hold Position Markings.




      4.5.2.5. Instrument (INST) hold position markings. These lines are normally placed
      further away from the runway than the VFR hold position markings. These markings
      consist of two solid yellow lines, two feet apart, extending across width of taxiway,
      connected by pairs of solid yellow lines 10 feet apart, on black background (see figure
      4.4.). These hold positions will be used any time the weather falls below a ceiling of 800
      feet or visibility decreases to two statute miles or less, or when directed by ATC.

Figure 4.4. Instrument (INST) Hold Position Marking.




      4.5.2.6. Taxiway and Apron Markings. Solid double yellow lines denote the edge of
      taxiways or aprons (aircraft and tow crews may not cross these lines). Dashed double
      yellow lines denote the edge of a taxilane (aircraft and tow crews may cross these lines).
      Single solid yellow lines denote taxiway/taxilane centerlines.
   4.5.3. Airfield lighting (e.g., runway, taxiway, etc.).

   4.7.1. Vehicles operated near an aircraft will remain well clear of the aircraft, and be visible
   from the aircraft cockpit.
   4.7.2. Vehicles will not be backed in the direction of an aircraft without a spotter behind the
   vehicle. Position wheel chocks prior to backing to prevent accidental contact with the
   aircraft.
   4.7.3. Operators will not drive a vehicle within 50 feet of any fueling or de-fueling
   operations unless specifically authorized by a directive.
   4.7.4. Vehicles will never pass under any part of an aircraft.
   4.7.5. Vehicles must approach aircraft with the driver’s side of the vehicle toward the
   aircraft.
   4.7.6. Do not drive within 10 feet of a parked aircraft, except when the aircraft is being
   serviced, loaded/off-loaded as prescribed in applicable technical orders.
   4.7.7. Unless prevented by aircraft servicing procedures, traffic flow on the aircraft parking
   ramp shall be parallel to the noses of the parked aircraft with the driver’s side toward the
   nearest aircraft. Vehicles will not be driven diagonally across the parking ramp, but at 90-
   degree angles to the driving lanes.
4.8. Vehicle Parking and Chocking.
   4.8.1. All vehicles parked and left unattended on the airfield will:
      4.8.1.1. Have the ignition turned off. Keys will remain in the ignition when vehicles are
      parked in an aircraft movement area.
      4.8.1.2. Be in reverse (standard transmission) or park (automatic transmission) (diesel
      standard transmission – neutral).
      4.8.1.3. Have emergency brake set.
      4.8.1.4. Be parked so that the direction of travel, either forward or backward, will not be
      toward any aircraft.
   4.8.2. Chocks will be used for all vehicles and equipment mounted on wheels that do not
   have an integral braking system when left unattended on the airfield or when operating
   within 10 feet of any aircraft.
   4.8.3. No vehicle will be left parked unattended within the 25 foot fire lane between aircraft
   sunshades and the apron wall. Note: If a vehicle becomes disabled on the airfield the driver
   must notify Airfield Management (6-7131/7132) and Transportation as soon as possible.
   4.8.4. Vehicles with engines operating will never be parked unattended within aircraft
   critical areas or facing aircraft. EXCEPTION: Emergency vehicles responding to
   emergencies or aircraft servicing vehicles that must remain on to generate power to perform
   tasks.
   4.8.5. Vehicles towing AGE may be left running after setting parking brake and placing the
   vehicle in park while driver completes hook-up or unhook operations, or during FOD checks
   prior to entering the airfield. Drivers must shut off vehicle, set parking brake, and place
   vehicle in park or reverse if they do not drop off or drive off with AGE equipment
 28                                                    LUKEAFBI13-213 26 JANUARY 2012


   immediately following hook-up or unhook operations. Refueling trucks may be left running
   at ECP’s after setting parking brake and placing the vehicle in park. The vehicle must be
   chocked immediately before starting FOD check. General purpose vehicles may be left
   running after setting parking brake, and placing in “park” while conducting FOD checks
   prior to entry to the airfield.
   4.8.6. Line Delivery munitions towing vehicles may be left running after setting vehicle
   parking brake, munitions trailer parking, and placing the vehicle in park while driver
   completes munitions loading and unloading operations or during FOD checks prior to
   entering the airfield. Both the towing vehicle and munitions trailer must be chocked if the
   engine is running; if the engine is shut off only the trailer must be chocked. Munitions Line
   Delivery drivers must shut off vehicle, set parking brake, and place vehicle in park or reverse
   if they are not performing munitions loading/unloading operations.
4.9. Lateral Distance Requirements for Fixed and Mobile Obstacle.
   4.9.1. Runway lateral distance requirements. The area within 1,000 feet of either side of the
   centerline of the runways must be kept free of obstacles. Vehicles and other equipment must
   not be left unattended within 1,000 feet of any runway centerline.
   4.9.2. Taxiway lateral distance requirements. The area within 200 feet either side of taxiway
   centerlines must be kept free of obstacles. Vehicles and other equipment must not be left
   unattended within 200 feet of any taxiway centerline.
   4.9.3. Apron lateral distance requirements. The lateral clearance distance varies for parking
   aprons depending on the location of the taxilane line and the type aircraft. The apron
   boundary is defined by double yellow lines that surround the perimeter of the parking ramp.
   Care must be used to ensure wingtip clearance for aircraft on apron taxilanes is preserved.
   Ensure vehicles and equipment are operated and stored in accordance with paragraph 4.27
   All equipment and vehicles stored along the edge of the apron/ramp must be located behind
   the wing-tip clearance markings or within the designated holding areas to satisfy wing-tip
   and security requirements. Apron clearance distances for fixed and mobile obstacles are as
   follows:
      4.9.3.1. Transient parking rows (1 – 3, 8 – 10): Varies depending on type aircraft. At a
      minimum aircraft with wingspans less than 110’ must have at least 25’ wingtip clearance
      between the aircraft and the apron boundary marking.
      4.9.3.2. Row 4: At least 3 feet behind apron boundary marking.
      4.9.3.3. Row 5/6: At least 10 feet behind apron boundary marking.
      4.9.3.4. Rows 6/7, and 11 – 15: Behind the apron boundary marking.
      4.9.3.5. Rows 16 – 26 along taxiway Kilo: At least 9 feet behind apron boundary
      marking.
      4.9.3.6. Rows 16 – 18 along taxiway Lima: Behind the apron boundary marking.
      4.9.3.7. Rows 19 – 26 along taxiway Lima: At least 10 feet behind apron boundary
      marking.
      4.9.3.8. Row 27: At least 5 feet behind apron boundary marking.
LUKEAFBI13-213 26 JANUARY 2012                                                                     29


      4.9.3.9. Rows 28 – 43: Behind the apron boundary marking.
4.10. Control Tower Light Gun Signals.
   4.10.1. Air traffic controllers use a light gun as a backup system for communicating with
   aircraft or ground vehicles if their radios stop working. When a vehicle operator experiences
   a radio failure on a runway or taxiway, they must vacate the runway as quickly and safely as
   possible and contact the ATCT or AM by other means, such as a cellular telephone to advise
   of the situation. If this is not practical, then the driver, after vacating the runway, should turn
   the vehicle toward the tower and start flashing the vehicle headlights and wait for the
   controller to signal with the light gun. All vehicle operators are required to know and
   comply with the following signals:
      4.10.1.1. Steady Green Light: “Cleared to cross”, “Proceed”, “Go”.
      4.10.1.2. Steady Red Light: “STOP! Vehicle will not be moved”.
      4.10.1.3. Flashing Red Light: “Clear active taxiway/runway”.
      4.10.1.4. Flashing White Light: “Return to starting point”.
      4.10.1.5. Red and Green Light: General warning. Exercise extreme caution. During
      alerts and emergency conditions all non-essential personnel will withdraw to AM or their
      work control center until the emergency is terminated. The withdrawal of contractors
      will be at the discretion of AM.
   4.10.2. All vehicle operators will be familiar/comply with airfield signs, markings, and
   Control Tower light gun signals.
   4.10.3. All vehicles operating on airfield will have AFVA 11-240 Airport Signs and
   Markings signal decal (figure 4.7.) and AFVA 13-222, Runway/Controlled Movement Area
   (CMA) Procedures (figure 4.8.). The decals may be permanently affixed in plain view of
   driver or clipped to inside of sun visor on driver’s side of vehicle so it can be flipped down
   for ready reference.

   4.10.4. APDM’s may order these on E-Publishing website http://www/e-publishing.af.mil.
4.11. Foreign Object Damage (FOD) Prevention.
   4.11.1. Immediately upon entering the airfield, all vehicles operators will conduct a FOD
   check of the vehicle. Note: Vehicle operators must make every attempt to stay on paved
   surfaces and avoid driving on unimproved surfaces (e.g., dirt or grass). If driving on
   unimproved surfaces is required, conduct a FOD check upon exit of these areas or returning
   to paved surfaces.
   4.11.2. At a minimum, a FOD check will consist of the following:
       4.11.2.1. A roll-over inspection of vehicle tires.
          4.11.2.1.1. Stop the vehicle, check/remove debris from all four tires, pull the vehicle
          forward 18 to 24 inches, then once again check/remove debris from all four tires.
       4.11.2.2. A visual check to ensure all external vehicle components are secured. Secure
       any/all items loaded on payload vehicle, including all tie down device loose ends such as
       chains, ropes, packaging or other item that may become dislodged during movement
       while on the airfield.
       4.11.2.3. A thorough walk around of the vehicle to check for damaged, loose, or worn
       parts.
   4.11.3. Vehicle operators encountering FOD on the airfield will stop and collect it. Large
   amounts of debris will be reported to AMOPS or the Maintenance Operations Center.
   4.11.4. Hats will not be worn on the airfield, except hot and cold weather gear authorized by
   AFI 36-2903, Dress and Personal Appearance of Air Force Personnel. If a hat is worn on
   the airfield, it will be properly secured IAW LUKEAFBI 21-107, Preventing Foreign Object
   Damage.
4.12. Cell Phone Use on the Airfield.
LUKEAFBI13-213 26 JANUARY 2012                                                                 31


   4.12.1. Cell phones will not be used while driving on the airfield.
   4.12.2. Cell phones should not be used during aircraft servicing unless specified in the
   appropriate Technical Order or guidance for the particular operation being conducted. Cell
   phones should not be used:
       4.12.2.1. Within 50 feet of any pressurized aircraft fuel or oxygen servicing components.
       4.12.2.2. Within 25 feet of any aircraft fuel vent outlet during fuel transfer.
       4.12.2.3. Within 10 feet of any aircraft fuel vent outlet at any time.
4.13. Restricted Visibility and Night Operations.
   4.13.1. Poor weather conditions (e.g., fog, rain, etc.) might obscure visual cues, roadway
   markings, and airfield signs. Vehicle operators must remain vigilant of their surroundings
   and operating boundaries.
   4.13.2. In order to preserve aircrew night vision, during periods of darkness or reduced
   visibility do not direct headlights toward the cockpit of an aircraft. Use parking lights to
   identify vehicle positions.
   4.13.3. Instrument Hold lines: Vehicles will stop and hold at INST marking/sign during IFR
   and low visibility conditions. Tower will broadcast when IFR conditions are in effect via the
   ramp net when conditions dictate. Broadcasts will be made in 30 minute increments for the
   first 2 hours. The DAFM will also send out an Airfield Driving Information Flash via e-mail
   to unit ADPMs for dissemination to all drivers.
   4.13.4. Vehicles parked on the airfield during hours of darkness or reduced visibility will use
   emergency flashers (hazard lights). Exception: specialized equipment (e.g., bomb loaders)
   not equipped with emergency warning flashers will be equipped with reflective markings
   during hours of darkness and inclement weather.
   4.13.5. Top-mounted rotating emergency lights must be in operation for vehicles routinely
   operating on the runway. Emergency vehicles not operating on the runway may be equipped
   with dash or grill mounted emergency lights.
   4.13.6. Golf carts/electric cars not equipped with parking lights are exempt. However, golf
   carts/electric car operators should position their vehicles to prevent headlights from shining
   toward moving aircraft.
4.14. Daytime Running Lights (DRL).
   4.14.1. Vehicles equipped with daytime running lights will not shine headlights directly
   toward aircraft during darkness/reduced visibility operations.
   4.14.2. If unable to disable the DRLs, vehicle operators will position the vehicle so that the
   headlights are facing away from the aircraft, or turn the vehicle off.
   4.14.3. Emergency flashers will remain on at all times. Once the aircraft(s) pass out of range
   the vehicle may be turned back on.

                                   DISABLED VEHICLES

8.1. Procedures for a disabled vehicle on the airfield.
   8.1.1. When a vehicle has a malfunction that prevents operation under its own power, every
   means will be used to alert other vehicles or taxiing aircraft in the vicinity. At a minimum,
   the ground vehicle operator will:
       8.1.1.1. Leave the vehicle parking lights or emergency flashers on.
       8.1.1.2. If the vehicle has two-way radio capability, make the following transmission:
       “All parties BREAK, BREAK-This is (call sign) with an emergency for Airfield
       Management, Tower, and Maintenance Operations Center”. State the nature of the
       problem and report your position on the airfield.
   8.1.2. Operators of other radio-equipped vehicles (e.g. security forces, civil engineer,
   transportation, etc.) must make every effort to assist getting the disabled vehicle off of the
   airfield, especially if the vehicle is located on parking aprons, taxiways, or runway.
   8.1.3. If a vehicle is not equipped with a two-way radio, stay with the vehicle and continue
   attempts to alert any taxiing aircraft or other vehicles in the vicinity. If the vehicle operator
   or other occupants have a cellular phone, contact AM at 623-856-7132.
   8.1.4. In the event of a disabled vehicle on the CMA, the vehicle operator will immediately
   notify ATCT and AM by any means possible to coordinate expeditious removal of the
   disabled vehicle from the CMA.
       8.1.4.1. The vehicle operator will ensure the disabled vehicle is not left unattended in the
       CMA.
       8.1.4.2. The disabled vehicle will be removed using any method in the quickest and
       safest way possible.
   8.1.5. In the event of a radio failure and communications cannot be established between
   vehicle operators in the CMA and the Control Tower, the Control Tower will use light-gun
   signals to communicate. If light-gun signals fail, the Control Tower will raise and lower the
   intensity of the runway lights as an emergency runway exit signal.
       8.1.5.1. Vehicle operators will immediately exit the CMA and make contact with ATCT
       and/or AMOPS to inform they are out of the CMA
