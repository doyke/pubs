This instruction implements Air Force Instruction (AFI) 11-401, Aviation Management; Air
Education and Training Command (AETC), Supplement 1. This instruction establishes policies
and procedures for conducting orientation flights at Luke Air Force Base (AFB). It provides
additional clarification on incentive, familiarization, and public affairs (PA)/distinguished visitor
(DV) flights. This publication applies to the U. S. Air Force Reserve units and members
attached or assigned to Luke AFB. Refer recommended changes and questions about this
publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF Form 847,
Recommendation for Change of Publication; route AF Forms 847 from the field through the
appropriate functional’s chain of command. Any change to this instruction must be
coordinated with 56th Operations SS/OSO. Ensure that all records created as a result of
processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with AFMAN 33-363,
Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records Information
Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule (RDS).

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This publication has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Luke
Form 369 replaces the AETC Form 327. Familiarization flights no longer categorized as
restricted or unrestricted flights, requiring all individuals to receive physiological training prior
to a flight. Attachment numbering designations updated.

1.9.4.7.1.6.9.1. (Added) Incentive flights while deployed will be at the discretion of the
deployed commander. These flights will not count towards a squadron’s monthly goal unless
they are for a group/wing award winner. A list of names with all the required information must
be submitted to Current Ops NLT 21 days prior to departing for deployment. All individuals that
fly incentive flights at deployed locations must be on an approved Luke AFB Orientation
Flight Request eSSS (includes Luke Form 369, AETC Orientation Flight Request) and have
current egress training, flight surgeon medical clearance and physiological training prior to
flight. Upon return to Luke AFB, the SARM office of the deployed unit must report all incentive
flights accomplished by updating the OSS/OSOS Orientation Log.
1.9.4.7.1.6.9.1.1. (Added) Medical clearance must be given by the deployed Flight Surgeon or
the Aerospace Medical Clinic at the deployed location if it was not accomplished prior to
departure from Luke.
1.9.4.7.1.6.9.1.2. (Added) Prior to deployment, the squadron will designate multiple pilots to
receive certification training on Egress and Parachute Descent Training (EG/PDT) procedures
from a qualified 56 OSS Aircrew Flight Equipment Continuation Training instructor, and
document training on a memorandum for record. Deployed incentive flyers will receive training
on EG/PDT procedures from a certified pilot within 72 hours of the incentive sortie. If the
deployed location does not have F-16 EG/PDT equipment, training can be accomplished using
one of the deployed aircraft as a static seat trainer.
1.9.4.7.1.6.9.9.1. (Added) In addition to critical phases of flight as listed in AFI 11-
401_AETCSUP_1, 56 FW critical phases of flight include close formation, over-the-top
aerobatics, instrument approaches, and low level flying below 5,000 feet AGL.
1.9.4.7.4. (Added) Incentive Flight Procedures:
1.9.4.7.4.1. (Added) Incentive flights reward military personnel assigned to Luke AFB for
outstanding service with a back seat ride in an F-16 and motivate others to similar performance
levels. Incentive categories include Fighter Wing Annual Award winners, Fighter Wing
Quarterly Award winners and Group allocations.
1.9.4.7.4.2. (Added) The 56 FW goal is an average of 8 dedicated incentive sorties per month
(96 incentive flights annually). Each US fighter squadron in the 56 FW will provide an average
of two incentive flights per month. The average of two-sorties-per-squadron-per-month goal
reflects incentive flights only (award winners and allocations) and does not include any other
category of orientation flights given by a squadron.
1.9.4.7.4.3. (Added) The allocation of the 96 incentive rides per year are distributed amongst
the 56 FW Staff Agencies, the four groups (OG, MXG, MSG, and MDG) of the 56 FW, and the
944 FW. The number of incentive flights allocated to each unit above is based upon the number
of personnel assigned to each unit (refer to Attachment 6, Table A6.1). Each unit commander
controls how their incentive flight allocations are distributed amongst the individuals in their
unit, and will appoint an orientation flight point of contact (POC) to work directly with 56
OSS/OSOS. Commanders are encouraged to use their flight allocations for their Annual Award
winners. When a person receives an incentive flight, that sortie will then be charged against the
unit’s total allocation. The 944 FW may use a blanket approval for their allocations. The 944
FW POC will submit a Luke Form 369 with individual names to OSS/OSOS. OSO/OSOS will
AFI11-401_LUKEAFBSUP 6 AUGUST 2013                                                                3


add that individual's name to the weekly ATO slide for final approval. Unit allocations are
maintained and tracked by 56 OSS/OSOS.
1.9.4.7.4.3.1. (Added) In each case, requests are subject to mission requirements and sortie
availability. Unit orientation flight POCs are required to conduct a quarterly review of their
superior performers and award winners to eliminate personnel who have PCSd, retired, or who
do not wish to fly. Group Exec’s will submit quarterly flight requests to 56 OSS/OSOS NLT
Jan, Apr, Jul, and Oct of each year. Out of cycle requests will be considered on a case-by-case
basis.
1.9.4.7.4.3.2. (Added) Individuals selected for incentive flights will not have any current or
pending administrative actions against them. This includes but is not limited to a current passing
PT score. NOTE: Gp/CC can waive on a case-by-case basis.
1.9.4.7.4.3.3. (Added) IAW AFMOA/SG3P, AFI 11-403, Aerospace Physiological Training
Program, paragraph 2.1.9. physiological training will be accomplished for incentive flights no
earlier than 72 hours prior to flight.
1.9.4.7.4.3.3.1. (Added) 56 OSS/OSO will make every effort to schedule physiological
training in the following order: 1) Aerospace Physiologist, 2) Flight Doctor, 3) Aircraft
Commander.
1.9.4.7.4.4. (Added) Upon successful early completion of each group’s allocation, additional
incentive sorties requested by Gp/CCs will be approved on a case-by-case basis, aircraft
availability permitting, by the 56 FW/CC.
1.9.4.7.4.5. (Added) Incentive flights may be scheduled as a formation or single-ship. Special
care and attention must be taken before the flight to ensure the mission profile is tailored
specifically to the interests, needs, and physiological limitations of the recipient. During the
flight, the instructor must communicate with the recipient and change the planned profile if
necessary.
1.9.4.7.4.6. (Added)    Pilots will perform aerobatic maneuvers only when requested by the
passenger.
1.9.4.7.4.7. (Added) External ordnance will be downloaded from the aircraft and all guns will
be mechanically safe.
1.9.4.7.5. (Added) Familiarization flight procedures:
1.9.4.7.5.1. (Added) Familiarization flights do not normally restrict a mission profile, require
at least a secret security clearance, and will be scheduled at the discretion of the flying squadron
operations officer. Operations officers will consider the individual’s background, expertise, and
capability to use the experience in their work to determine the appropriate type of flight.
1.9.4.7.5.1.3. (Added) IAW AFMOA/SG3P, AFI 11-403, Aerospace Physiological Training
Program, paragraph 2.1.9. physiological training will be accomplished for familiarization flights
no earlier than 72 hours prior to flight.
1.9.4.7.5.1.3.1. (Added) 56 OSS/OSO will make every effort to schedule physiological
training in the following order: 1) Aerospace Physiologist, 2) Flight Doctor, 3) Aircraft
Commander.

1.9.4.7.5.2. (Added) Recommending Commanders will ensure that all personnel submitted for
familiarization flights do not have any current or pending administrative actions against them.
This includes but is not limited to a current passing PT score. NOTE: Gp/CC can waive on a
case-by-case basis.
1.9.4.7.5.3. (Added) Recommending Commanders will prioritize their lists, in case 56
OSS/OSOS is unable to schedule all individuals in the time allowed. If no priority is specified,
56 OSS/OSOS will prioritize in the best interest of the program.
1.9.4.7.5.4. (Added) The 56 FW/CC has determined that civilian award winners will be flown
under familiarization flight guidelines and flown on incentive flight profiles.
1.9.4.7.6. (Added) PA/DV flight procedures:
1.9.4.7.6.1. (Added) 56 FW/PA will manage the Luke AFB PA/DV flight program, and will
maintain a prioritized 56 FW/CC approved list of all requests.
1.9.4.7.6.2. (Added) 56 FW/PA will be authorized two PA/DV flights per month from October
through May. NOTE: FW/CC can waive on a case-by-case basis.
1.9.4.7.6.3. (Added) As soon as possible before a requested PA/DV flight, provide 56
OSS/OSOS the following information:
1.9.4.7.6.3.1. (Added) An email with pertinent background information that states why the
individual should receive the flight.
1.9.4.7.6.3.1.1. (Added) The following attachments must be included with the email: draft
Luke Form 369, DV Flight Worksheet, Flight Health Screening, Personal Physician’s Statement,
and Hold Harmless Agreement
1.9.4.7.6.4. (Added) Upon approval, 56 FW/PA will coordinate all PA/DV paperwork with the
hosting US fighter squadron to ensure all documents are in their possession prior to flight.
1.9.4.7.7. (Added) 56 OSS/OSOS (Current Operations) responsibilities:
1.9.4.7.7.1. (Added) Determine the level of approval required IAW AFI 11-401 and AFI 11-
401_AETCSUP_1.
1.9.4.7.7.2. (Added) Prepare and staff a consolidated Luke AFB Orientation Ride eSSS
(includes Luke Form 369) as required. By electronically signing the eSSS, those required to
coordinate are automatically coordinating on the Luke Form 369. A link to the Luke Form 369
will be provided, allowing those required to coordinate to view additional information. Approved
Luke Form 369s are valid for a period of six months from the date the FW/CC signs the eSSS.
1.9.4.7.7.3. (Added) Monitor, track, and prioritize incentive flight requests to ensure group
quotas are not exceeded (Attachment 6). Advertise the incentive ride master listing statistics at
the Thursday ATO and Production Meetings.
1.9.4.7.7.4. (Added) Determine incentive flight priorities from the 56 OSS/OSOS master
listing for the upcoming week based on availability of back seats allocated from the designated
US fighter squadrons. Individuals will be selected in sequential order if possible. Personnel on
the wing incentive list that are assigned to a fighter squadron will be given the opportunity to fly
with their assigned squadron.
AFI11-401_LUKEAFBSUP 6 AUGUST 2013                                                                  5


1.9.4.7.7.5. (Added) If an individual on the incentive ride master listing declines three
opportunities to fly (for any reason), he/she will be removed from the master listing. The 56
OSS/OSO Flight CC may waive this on a case-by-case basis.
1.9.4.7.7.6. (Added) Provide the individual receiving an orientation ride the approved eSSS
with the Luke Form 369 and notify them of the flight prerequisites.
1.9.4.7.7.7. (Added) Schedule appointments for orientation ride personnel to accomplish flight
prerequisites (medical clearance, egress training, physiological training).
1.9.4.7.7.8. (Added) Ensure orientation flight individuals meet weight requirements IAW AFI
48-123, Volume 3, Flying and Special Operations Duty, subparagraph A5.10.1.3. (amendment).
The F-16 has an ejection seat design limit (SDL) of 140-211 lbs. The F-16 weight for flight
(WFF) is 103-245 lbs. Persons outside the SDL (weighing less than 140 lbs or more than 211
lbs) must receive a waiver in order to receive an orientation flight. Persons outside the WFF
(weighing less than 103 lbs or more than 245 lbs) will not receive orientation flights. Waiver
approval authority for military personnel outside the SDL but within the WFF, including USAFA
and AFROTC cadets is 56 FW/CC. 56 OSS/OSOS maintains a current blanket waiver from the
56 FW/CC. For civilians that weigh outside the SDL but within the WFF, AETC/A2/3/10 is the
approval authority.
1.9.4.7.7.9. (Added) Staff a blanket Luke Form 369, via an eSSS, a minimum of semi-annually
to the 56 FW/CC requesting that United States Air Force Academy (USAFA) and Air Force
