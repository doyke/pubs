                                                Chapter 1

                                           INTRODUCTION

1.1. General. This instruction describes the tactical-level procedures and organization for providing air
defense of the North American Air Defense Command (NORAD) and Pacific Command (PACOM)
areas of responsibility. Headquarters Air Combat Command (HQ ACC) organizes, trains, and equips
the United States Theater Air Control System (USTACS) elements for the air defense of the Continental
United States. HQ PACAF organizes, trains, equips, and supports operations for the air defense of
Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, Republic of Korea, and Japan.
1.2. Threat Environment. America and our deployed forces confront a greater diversity of threats and
challenges than ever before. The traditional, strategic nuclear threat to our deployed forces and
Homeland remains, but the terrorist threat to our forces has become the preeminent threat. The air
threats include long-range military strategic aviation, commercial aircraft, (airliners, charter, cargo, and
business jets), unconventional aircraft (general aviation aircraft, crop dusters, unmanned aerial vehicles,
and ultra lights), and cruise missiles (internally and externally carried, air and sea launched). Combatant
Commanders employ Theater Air Control System (TACS) elements to combat these air threats.
1.3. Purpose. This instruction standardizes the structure, functions, and responsibilities for each of the
ACC and PACAF TACS elements listed below.
   1.3.1. CONUS Air Defense Sector (ADS). The CONUS Air Defense Sectors are Air National
   Guard, self-sustaining, geographically separated elements of the USTACS. The Air Defense Sectors
   are responsible to the NORAD Commander through the Continental NORAD Region (CONR)
   Commander for homeland defense, air defense, air sovereignty and aerospace warning and control of
   their assigned areas of operation.
   1.3.2. Alaskan Battle Control Center (ABCC). The ABCC, an Air National Guard element, is
   responsible to the NORAD Commander through the Alaska NORAD Region (ANR) Commander for
   homeland defense, air defense, air sovereignty, and aerospace warning and control of their assigned
   area of operation.
   1.3.3. Hawaii Region Air Operations Center (HIRAOC). The HIRAOC, an Air National Guard
   element, is responsible to the PACOM Commander through the Area Air Defense Commander
   (AADC) for homeland defense, air defense, air sovereignty, and aerospace warning and control of
   their assigned area of operation.
   1.3.4. Korean Theater Air Control System (KTACS). US and Korean TACS elements are
   responsible to the Commander Air Component Command (CACC) for planning, directing, and
   coordinating the execution of military air operations throughout the Republic of Korea (ROK).
   1.3.5. Japan Air Defense System (JADS). Government of Japan retains the sovereign responsibility
   for peacetime air defense of Japan. Agreements between the US and Japan dictate that command
   and control of military forces will be exercised through separate national structures. Tactical
   Control Operations Teams (TCOT) and the Air Defense Liaison Element (ADLE) are USAF TACS
   elements that collocate with key JASDF elements of the JADS to maximize bilateral contingency
   and wartime air operations.
1.4. Supplements/Waiver Authority.
6                                                                     AFI13-1ADV3 12 JUNE 2009


    1.4.1. All proposed supplements to this instruction will be submitted through channels to
    USAF/A3O- AYOB OPR for approval.
    1.4.2. Waivers.
       1.4.2.1. Waiver authority for requirements contained in this instruction rests with USAF/A3O-
       AYOB unless otherwise specified.
       1.4.2.2. Requests for waivers must contain a complete explanation of why the waiver is required
       and corrective actions to be taken.
       1.4.2.3. All waivers for ACC/PACAF/USAFE consideration will be forwarded through channels
       to the applicable MAJCOM.

            CONUS AIR DEFENSE SECTOR BATTLE CONTROL CENTER (BCC)

2.1. Mission. The CONUS NORAD Region (CONR) has been subdivided into two geographic air
defense sectors, East and West. Tactical execution of the defensive counter-air, interdiction, and
counterdrug operations missions is the responsibility of the Air Control Squadrons (ACSs) that operate
the respective BCCs. The BCCs fuse all-source sensor and intelligence data into a common operational
air picture and disseminate integrated tactical warning information and attack assessments. BCCs
maintain the capability to assume the mission of the adjacent sector, commonly called expansion
operations. Sectors support AOC Continuation of Operations when directed or required for real-time
execution.
2.2. BCC Organization. The weapon system employed by each of the CONUS air control groups is
the BCC, as described in the ACC Enabling Concept for US Theater Air Control System Battle Control
Center, dated 1 January 2005. The BCC is comprised of two separate, but complimentary elements; the
Battle Staff and the Mission Crew. The Battle Staff (BS) functions as the conduit for the exchange of
Command and Control (C2) information between the BCC and Higher Headquarters (HHQ). The
Mission Crew (MC) performs the functions of Battle Management, Weapons Control, Surveillance,
Identification and Tactical data link and airspace management. This chapter details the standardized
organizational structure and positional responsibilities for the Battle Control Center.
2.3. BCC Battle Staff (BS) . The BS is a component of the BCC and is a complimentary element to
the Mission Crew. Members of the Battle Staff are not separate personnel authorizations. Battle Staff
members are dual-hatted members of the operations, mission support and Commander‘s staff. The Battle
Commander (BC) may form the Battle Staff as necessary due to changes in the threat or directed
missions from HHQ. The Battle Staff may be activated for an indefinite period of time and each Battle
Staff position must be capable of sustained operations. The BC may also tailor and selectively man
positions within the Battle Staff for specific operations. The Battle Staff is responsible for:
   2.3.1. Executing homeland defense, air defense, and air sovereignty missions.
   2.3.2. Prioritizing the employment of assets under BCC tactical control.
   2.3.3. Translating the AOCs Operational-level plans [Joint Air Operations Plan (JAOP), air
   operations directive (AOD), air defense plan (ADP), airspace control plan (ACP), airspace control
   order (ACO), air tasking order (ATO), ATO special instructions (SPINS), tactical operations data
   (TACOPDAT), and Operations Task Link (OPTASKLINK)] into tactical-level orders for Mission
   Crew execution.
   2.3.4. Coordination with the Mission Crew.
   2.3.5. Disseminating tactical-warning and attack assessment information to the AOC.
   2.3.6. Performing real-time battle management in support of the Mission Crew.
2.4. Battle Staff Composition. The BS may be tailored by the Commander to execute the assigned
mission. Based on the mission tasking, the BS consist of any combination of:
   Battle Commander (BC),
   Fighter Officer (FO),
   Intelligence Officer (IN),
   Chief, Operations Control
8                                                                        AFI13-1ADV3 12 JUNE 2009


    Emergency Action Coordinator (EAC),
    Battle Staff Coordinator (BSC),
    Weapons and Tactics Officer,
    Airspace Management Officer,
    Joint Asset Control Officer,
    Communications and Electronics Officer,
    Antiterrorism Officer,
    Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) Officer

NOTE: The battle staff may require augmentation from outside the ACS (i.e. the Air Control Group).
    2.4.1. Battle Commander (BC). The unit commander/Director of Operations or his/her designated
    representative will be the BC. In the absence of the commander, the succession to the commander
    list will be used. The BC is responsible for executing the mission through employment of the
    assigned forces. The BC is operationally responsible to AFNORTH for the centralized C4 of the
    ACS resources. The BC will:

                          ALASKA BATTLE CONTROL CENTER (ABCC)

4.1. Mission. The Alaska Battle Control Center (ABCC) provides air sovereignty and air defense of the
Alaska area of operation by executing defensive counter air, interdiction and counterdrug operations in
support of NORAD, NORTHCOM, and/or PACOM and under the direction of the 611th Air and Space
Operations Center (611 AOC). The ABCC is subordinate to the 611 AOC and supports continuation of
operations when directed or required for time critical execution. The ABCC fuses all-source sensor and
intelligence data into a common operational air picture and disseminates integrated tactical warning
information and attack assessment. The 176th ACS conducts the mission of the ABCC.
4.2. Organization . The ABCC is a weapons system as described in the ACC Enabling Concept for
US Theatre Air Control System Battle Control Center, dated 1 Jan 2005. The ABCC is comprised of
those elements described in the enabling concept below and including the MCC. Since the ABCC and
611 AOC are collocated, the DO and BC functions are conducted by the AOC (ref AFI13-1AOCV3).
The ABCC includes operations and support functions.
     4.2.1. Operations Sections: Command and Control (C2), Weapons, Identification, Surveillance, and
     Interface Control Sections.
     4.2.2. Support Sections: Training, Standardization and Evaluation, Weapons and Tactics, and
     Operations Support (maintenance, personnel and facility issues).
4.3. Command and Control. The Mission Crew Commander (MCC) and the Chief of Combat
Operations (CCO) form the primary C2 link between the ABCC and the 611 AOC.
     4.3.1. When formed, 611 AOC Combat Operations (CO) directs Region air defense and air
     sovereignty activities. Additionally, CO directs and coordinates activities of subordinate radar units,
     relays instructions from senior NORAD/NORTHCOM/PACOM elements to subordinate and lateral
     units, and coordinates allocation and employment of air defense resources. CO is assigned or
     allocated air defense resources, e.g., interceptor, early warning aircraft, etc., that are necessary to
     defend the Alaskan AO. These resources are used by CO via the Mission Crew Commander (MCC)
     for the conduct of assigned responsibilities.
     4.3.2. When Combat Operations are not stood up, the MCC conducts operations under the direction
     of the 611 AOC Director or designated representative.
4.4. Battle Control Center (BCC) Mission Crew. The 176 ACS is the mission crew portion of the
BCC and is the focal point for Air Defense operations within the Alaska NORAD Region and is
responsible for detection and surveillance and identification of any air breathing threat to the AO.
Supervised by a Mission Crew Commander (MCC), the Mission Crew is tasked to support the mission

                4.11.3.2.3.16. Know governing military standards and HHQ directives
                4.11.3.2.3.17. Use COMSEC material required for BICC operations
4.12. Simulation . During exercises and crew training periods, an additional section is formed to
simulate external participants. All duty positions within the simulation section are unit certified.
4.13. ABCC Degraded Radar Procedures:
     4.13.1. Surveillance. When the loss of a radar picture prevents the ABCC from detecting aircraft:
        4.13.1.1. TADIL-A/J link or voice tell from an AWACS will be displayed in the ABCC
        computer and identified using standard operating procedures. The ABCC AST will take
        immediate action to establish the tell required, determining priority areas of voice tell to ensure
        mission requirements are met. If an AWACS is on station with ADIZ coverage, its surveillance
        TPA will be expanded within the ADIZ without an orbit change. The ABCC AST, through the
        MCC, will recommend to the BC an AWACS orbit change and/or other means to reconfigure the
        Sector to support the active air defense mission as necessary.
        4.13.1.2. An AWACS orbit may be adjusted to cover the loss of a single site‘s radar. The orbit
        change would offset the loss of ADIZ coverage without degrading overall coverage.
     4.13.2. Weapons. Interceptor control would be provided solely by AWACS or the site in the area
     affected. The deployed WD program does not exist anymore. The extent of the radar coverage loss
     would dictate whether or not the Battle Commander would transition the AWACS from Level I to
     Level II. If the ABCC has degraded coverage in an area, AWACS should anticipate transition to
     Level II or Level III, depending on the air situation at the time. Command would be retained at the
     BC. Airborne fighters would be informed of the situation by the ABCC WD and directed to contact
     the AWACS, or augmenting GTACS unit as appropriate.
4.14. Radar Configuration
     4.14.1. ADS/JSS. The ADS will develop Letters of Agreement (LOAs)/Memorandum of
     Understanding (MOUs) between the sector and FAA for FAA/USAF joint-use LRRs. As a
     minimum, these agreements will address procedures for the management of data controls and
     equipment malfunction reporting. The following guidelines will be used for determining the point of
     contact for reporting equipment malfunctions that affect operating parameters.
        4.14.1.1. Equipment Malfunctions. All malfunctions will be reported and coordinated through
        the ADS Air Force Job Control (AFJC).
        4.14.1.2. JSS Operating Parameters--Joint Use Radar Sites. For joint use radar sites, the AFJC
        is responsible for coordinating with the FAA National Airspace System Operation Manager
        (NOM) at the appropriate Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) for any changes to the
        basis operating parameters.
4.15. Radar Configuration Changes . The following procedures for configuration changes will
apply, unless specifically directed otherwise by the ADS.
AFI13-1ADV3 12 JUNE 2009                                                                            49


  4.15.1. USAF LRRs. When the FAA (NOM) requires setting changes to the beacon, search radar or
  the common digitizer that affect both users, coordination will be accomplished with the respective
  sector AFJC. AFJC will coordinate with the ASO/T regarding requested changes.
  4.15.2. USAF/FAA Joint Use LRRs. All radar changes at FAA/USAF joint use LRRs must be
  coordinated with FAA IAW established LOAs/MOUs prior to ADE. At ADE, actions taken to
  obtain data are considered dynamic in nature and are exempt from prior coordination. When
  immediate or emergency action is required, the ASO/T will be notified of the changes as soon as
  possible. Procedures will be developed for configuration changes requiring immediate or emergency
  actions. After the procedures have been coordinated and approved by the unit DO, checklists will be
  published and used to ensure expediency of configuration changes. When the sector ASO/T requires
  setting changes for live flying exercises, in-flight emergency, execution of CONPLAN 3310 or
  missions against an unknown target, coordination will be accomplished with the NOM through
  AFJC to return the feature/device change to their normal day-to-day setting at the termination of the
  event.

                        THE KOREAN THEATER AIR CONTROL SYSTEM

5.1. Mission . The mission of the Korean Theater Air Control System (KTACS) is to plan, direct, and
coordinate the employment of forces engaged in air operations throughout the Republic of Korea
(ROK), as directed by the Commander Air Component Command (CACC).
5.2. Organization . KTACS provides the organization and equipment necessary to plan, direct, and
control air operations as well as to coordinate and link combined, unified, and joint operations. The
KTACS is based on the principles of centralized control, decentralized execution, and coordinated
efforts.
     5.2.1. HTACC. The focal point of the KTACS is the Hardened Theater Air Control Center
     (HTACC), which exercises centralized control and coordination of air operations. The HTACC
     monitors the execution of OPLANs in the planning and conduct of day-to-day air operations. Its
     primary responsibility is to provide the means for directing the detailed employment of available air
     efforts, through two independently staffed divisions; the 607 Combat Plans Division (CPD) and the
     607 Combat Operations Division.
        5.2.1.1. The CPD produces and disseminates the Air Tasking Orders (ATO). Assisted by the
        deputy for operations and deputy for intelligence, the CACC sets the allocation of air efforts.
        5.2.1.2. The COD supervises the detailed execution of the air operations orders, ATO, and is
        responsible for conducting and integrating all air operations through use of the KTACS
     5.2.2. MCRC. Directly subordinate to the HTACC is the Master Control and Reporting Center
     (MCRC). The MCRC is responsible for surveillance, identification, and weapons control. The 1st
     MCRC consists of two units (ROKAF callsign ―WATCHMAN‖ and USAF 621 ACS callsign
     ―COBRA‖) that perform the primary Air Defense mission in the ROK within two operations centers
     inside the HTACC facility. Watchman conducts operations through a pc-based system while Cobra
     operates the pc-based Battle Control System-Korea (BCS-K) via the Tactical Display Framework
     (TDF). The 2nd MCRC (Callsign ―ACACIA‖) located in Daegu also shares in Air Defense
     operations. During armistice operations, Watchman assumes primary surveillance and identification
     for 1st MCRC as well as responsibility for control of ROKAF assets. Cobra personnel provide
     primary battle management and weapons control for US assets. The ROKAF Tactical Control
     Director (TCD) has overall responsibility for the MCRC during armistice. Working in conjunction
     with the TCD is the senior USAF representative, the Mission Crew Commander (MCC). The MCC
     performs all coordination with the TCD through the assistance of two ROKAF Coordinators
     attached to Cobra who serve as interpreters and are the crew‘s link to the ROKAF TCD and Senior
     Director (SD).
        5.2.2.1. Cobra is the primary USAF air battle management and weapons control element in the
        ROK. Cobra is comprised of MCC, SD, MCCT, DST, AWO/WD, and 3CO mission teams.
        Cobra also coordinates, directs, and deconflicts employment of US, and occasionally ROKAF,
        tactical aircraft in their assigned missions.

       for each applicable logbook. Logbooks are official records of events that occurred during a
       crew‘s tour of duty. The purpose is to maintain an accurate and detailed record of all significant
       events pertaining to operations.
       7.4.2. Air Defense Units may use the electronic logbook method (Dynamic Synchronized Event
       log (DSEL)) instead of the permanently bound book. However, the permanently bound book
       will be used as a back-up. In the event of a software outage or hardware equipment loss
       supporting the DSEL, permanently bound log books will be used during the outage and then
       transcribed back into DSEL when the equipment becomes available.
          7.4.2.1. HQ NORAD/USNORTHCOM/J35 (N/NCJ35) will provide the necessary training,
          funding, and technical/software support of the DSEL application.
       7.4.3. The following procedures apply for all permanently bound logbooks:
          7.4.3.1. Logbooks will be maintained in a permanently bound book, such as a ledger or
          journal. A ledger may be obtained under GSA Stock Number 7530-00-286-8363.
          7.4.3.2. Logbooks will be classified SECRET/RELCAN and releasable to appropriate
          individuals as they will contain information concerning actual or simulated exercise alert
          warnings, states of preparedness, IFF/SIF modes and codes of the day, air-to-ground
          frequencies, system capabilities, outages, and so forth. Logbooks will be marked, handled,
          and stored IAW AFI 31--401 Information Security Program Management.
          7.4.3.3. Entries in logbooks will be made in black or blue ink. Erasures will not be made.
          Errors will be corrected by lining through incorrect words and will be initialed by the person
          making the correction. Highlighting of critical items and times is authorized.
          7.4.3.4. All logbooks will be opened at 0001 or the beginning of each duty day and closed at
          2400Z or the end of each duty day. All entries will be made using ZULU time.
          7.4.3.5. It is not necessary to record information that has already been noted in another
          authorized document, unless it is deemed appropriate for clarity and understanding.
