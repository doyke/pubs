AFOSH Standard 48-14, 1 April 1996, is supplemented as follows:
This supplement applies to all AETC recreational swimming pools. It does not apply to the Air National
Guard or Air Force Reserve Command. Maintain and dispose of records created as a result of processes
prescribed in this publication in accordance with AFMAN 37-139, Records Disposition Schedule.
1.2.6. Lifeguards will receive training on the Bloodborne Pathogens Standard; and, if they have not
already been vaccinated, will be offered Hepatitis B vaccine within 10 days of their initial assignment.
For information on the coverage of lifeguards as emergency responders in 29 CFR 1910.1030,

Lifeguards, July 9, 1993.
2.1.5.1. Another reason for conducting preseason inspections at least 30 days prior to opening of the
