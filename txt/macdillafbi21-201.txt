approximately 100 feet inside the gate in the parking area specified by 6 SFS. Vehicles
transporting explosives will be escorted to Thunder Village/South Ramp Access Road, Suspect
Vehicle Holding Area/Inspection Area (see Attachment 2) by 6 SFS. 6 SFS will notify 6 LRS,
Cargo Movements Element (DSN 968-1800/2800, Commercial 813-828-1800/2800). 6 LRS,
Cargo Movement Element, will notify Maintenance Production Superintendent (DSN 968-
9210/9211, Commercial 813-828-9210/9211) and Munitions flight (DSN 968-1765/1763,
Commercial 813-828-1765/1763, normal duty hours) that a shipment has arrived and is awaiting

        3.3.2. Upon arrival at inspection site, Transportation Inspector will inspect vehicle
        including opening trailer to inspect blocking and bracing for adequacy. Inspector will
        prepare necessary forms and give driver a copy of DD Form 626. If there is any evidence
        of damage in shipment, emergency procedures will be followed (see Attachment 5). A
        Munitions Inspector (2W051/71/91) will be called to survey damage, determine cause for
        deficiencies, and state whether explosives may proceed safely to unloading area.
        Appropriate reports will then be initiated. Anytime sabotage is suspected, additional
        Security Forces will secure the area. Explosive Ordnance Disposal (DSN 968-
