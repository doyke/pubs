3.5. PRs for Critical Sensitive and Noncritical Sensitive Positions. Security mangers (SM)
track/direct period reinvestigations (PR) submittals. Security managers will run a PR roster
every 30 days through the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) and file it in Tab 8 of the
Security Manger Handbook. The report may be kept electronically; all security managers within
the unit must have access to the report. Seek support from commanders/staff agency chiefs for
those personnel who do not submit their PR in a timely manner; failure to complete a PR may
result in suspension of security clearance and establishment of Security Information File (SIF),
and other administrative actions. Commanders may suspend access to the local area network
