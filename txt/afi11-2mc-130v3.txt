                                GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. General. This Air Force Instruction (AFI) provides operational guidelines and restrictions
for MC130 and AFSOC C130 aircraft. It is a compilation of information from all aircraft flight
manuals, Flight Information Publications (FLIP) and other Air Force directives, and is an
original source document for many areas. This instruction is regulatory in nature and takes
precedence over guidance in Air Force Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (AFTTP). AFSOC
Standardization/Evaluation (AFSOC/A3V) has overall responsibility for the administration of
this volume.
1.2. Applicability. This AFI is applicable to all individuals and units operating MC130 aircraft
and AFSOC units operating Special Operations Forces (SOF) C130 airlift or tanker aircraft.
1.3. Key Definitions:
   1.3.1. ―Will‖ and ―Shall‖ indicate a mandatory requirement.
   1.3.2. ―Should‖ indicates a preferred, but not mandatory, method of accomplishment.
   1.3.3. ―May‖ indicates an acceptable or suggested means of accomplishment.
   1.3.4. ―WARNING‖ indicates operating procedures, techniques, etc., which may result in
   personal injury or loss of life if not carefully followed.
   1.3.5. “CAUTION” indicates operating procedures, techniques, etc., which may result in
   damage to equipment if not carefully followed.
   1.3.6. ―NOTE‖ indicates operating procedures, techniques, etc., which are considered
   essential to emphasize.
   1.3.7. See Attachment 1, Glossary of References and Supporting Information, for additional
   terms.
1.4. Deviations and Waivers. Do not deviate from the policies and guidance in this AFI except
when the situation demands immediate action to ensure safety.
   1.4.1. Although this publication provides guidance for aircraft operations under most
   circumstances, it is not a substitute for sound judgment. When it is necessary to protect the
   crew and aircraft from a situation not covered by this instruction and when immediate action
   is required, the Pilot In Command (PIC) has ultimate authority and responsibility for the
   course of action to be taken. Report deviations, without waiver, through channels to
   MAJCOM/A3 within 48 hours, followed by a written report, if requested. Unless otherwise
   indicated, AFSOC/A3 is the waiver authority for operational procedure requirements
   contained in this volume. Request waivers through Standardization/Evaluation (stan/eval)
   channels.
   1.4.2. In the absence of a designated Commander Air Force Special Operations Forces
   (COMAFSOF); the AFSOC/A3 may grant COMAFSOF waiver authority to an individual in
   writing.
 14                                                 AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011


       1.4.2.1. When waiver authority is delegated, AFSOC/A3V will receive a copy of all
       approved waivers.
   1.4.3. This instruction, 112MC130V3, is a source document for guidance and procedures
   within AFSOC. The dynamic nature of flying operations demands crew members and
   mission planners reference the parent source documents. Parent source documents are listed
   in order to ensure the operators have the most current and accurate information available to
   conduct flying operations.

                                          Chapter 2

                               COMMAND AND CONTROL

2.1. General. The AFSOC command and control (C2) system is based on the principles of
centralized monitoring and decentralized control and execution. The result is a C2 mechanism
which keeps the AFSOC Commander (CC) informed of the current status of AFSOC forces
while enabling the Wing or Group Commander to exercise control over day-to-day operations.
   2.1.1. Waiver request will be the responsibility of the C2 agency with the operational control
   of the mission. Operational waivers will be coordinated through the Stan/Eval channels.
2.2. Operational Control (OPCON). AFSOC is designated as the controlling agency for
United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM)-assigned Air Force SOF aircraft,
while Theater Special Operations Commands (TSOCs) have OPCON of theater-based assets. In
practice, responsibility for planning and executing home-station AFSOC missions is routinely
delegated to the Wing or Group Commander. The Wing or Group Commander, in turn, normally
exercises control of home-station missions through the command post supporting the wing or
group. In the event that assigned forces undergo a Change in Operational Control (CHOP),
responsibility for mission monitoring passes from the wing or group C2 facility to the gaining
command. Changeover will be accomplished IAW the pertinent Operational Plan, Operational
Order, or deployment or execution order.
2.3. 23d Air Force (23 AF). The 23 AF/CC exercises OPCON of AFSOC and Air Reserve
Component (ARC) units under Title 10 when transiting between Continental United States
(CONUS) and Outside Continental United States (OCONUS) destinations or supporting CONUS
missions tasked by headquarters Above Wing Level (AWL). The C2 agency responsible for the
23 AF/CC execution authorities is the 623d Air Operations Center (AOC). 23 AF OPCON is
described in detail in the AFSOC Supplement to AFI 11-202, Volume 3.
   2.3.1. 23 AF/CC will exercise OPCON of CONUS, OCONUS, and ARC forces when:
       2.3.1.1. CONUS forces depart home station for AWL tasked missions including:
          2.3.1.1.1. Deployments.
          2.3.1.1.2. Air Apportionment Allocation Conference taskings.
          2.3.1.1.3. Joint Air Apportionment Allocation Conference (JAAAC) taskings.
          2.3.1.1.4. Joint Combined Exchange Training (JCET)/Counter Narcotics Training
          missions.
          2.3.1.1.5. Other specified missions as tasked via the SOF air tasking order (ATO) in
          the Special Forces Web Application Suite (SOFAPPS).
       2.3.1.2. CONUS and OCONUS forces depart a TSOC or Joint Special Operations Air
       Component (JSOAC) area of responsibility (AOR) en route to United States Northern
       Command (NORTHCOM) AOR.
       2.3.1.3. ARC forces (under Title 10).
          2.3.1.3.1. Depart      home         station        for         AFSOC           directed
          contingencies/deployments/exercises (under Title 10).

   2.3.2. For missions under his/her operational control, 23 AF/CC holds waiver/approval
   authority for items normally authorized at or below wing level, and for those items delegated
   as COMAFSOF authorities.
   2.3.3. Operational waivers will be coordinated through Stan/Eval channels. Waiver requests
   will normally be the responsibility of the C2 agency with the operational control of the
   mission.
   2.3.4. 23 AF/CC OPCON terminates when forces arrive home station or enter a
   TSOC/JSOAC AOR. 623 AOC will continue to track, monitor, and support all AFSOC
   forces.
2.4. Mission Monitoring. Except for selected close-hold missions and AWL taskings, the
AFSOC Command Center monitors all AFSOC aircraft to, from, or between off-station
locations. The Command Center tracks off-station aircraft via the Air Mobility Command
(AMC) C2 system and direct reporting from aircrew and command post personnel. Key
components of the AMC C2 system are the Airlift Implementation and Monitoring System
(AIMS), the Global Decision Support System (GDSS), and the various AMC C2 facilities at
theater and wing locations. Information on scheduled activity comes from the wings who input
AIMS data for all upcoming missions except local missions not scheduled to land outside the
local flying area or close-hold missions that cannot be accommodated by classified AIMS setups.
When aircraft are deployed in support of operations and exercises, the C2 agency with OPCON
obtains additional information from situation reports (SITREP) and Deployed Status Reports
(DSR). The following mission monitoring procedures primarily apply to missions that are not
close-hold in nature and have not been chopped to another C2 agency:
   2.4.1. Wing (or equivalent) Command Posts track CONUS movements of their aircraft and
   directly input mission information into the GDSS.
   2.4.2. Data on CONUS movements of theater-based aircraft are collected by the AFSOC
   Command Center via GDSS updates. These are based on information received from AMC
   Command Posts and direct reporting from aircrews who take off or land at non-AMC
   locations.
   2.4.3. Information on OCONUS movements of AFSOC aircraft (CONUS or theater-based)
   comes to the AFSOC Command Center via GDSS or telephone notification from the
   overseas host group command posts. The host unit command posts receive their data from
   the aircrews directly or via the Special Operations Command and Control Squadron
   (SOCCS) or Special Operations Command and Control Element (SOCCE).
   2.4.4. PIC or mission commander flight reporting duties:
       2.4.4.1. Unclassified Missions at Bases with an AMC C2 Facility. Mission commanders
       will ensure that the following information is relayed to the AMC C2 facility at least 30
       minutes prior to landing: call signs, mission numbers, Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA),
       maintenance status, and additional service requirements. After landing, the mission
       commander will contact the C2 facility with ground handling requirements and departure
       information. In addition, CONUS based crews operating within the CONUS must keep
 18                                                  AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011


       their home station command posts appraised of all actual takeoff and landing times,
       projected takeoff times, and other related information.
       2.4.4.2. Unclassified Missions at Bases without an AMC C2 Facility. Mission
       commanders will report, as soon as possible, actual takeoff and landing times,
       maintenance status, projected takeoff times, and other pertinent data to the host wing
       command post, special operations control center, or AFSOC Command Center whichever
       is most applicable. Methods of communicating this information include high frequency
       (HF) phone patch, defense switched network (DSN), and commercial telephone.
       CONUS based crews operating within the CONUS must also ensure that their home
       station command posts receive real-time reports on aircraft movements.
       2.4.4.3. AIMS Missions.         When operating on classified missions, the mission
       commander will pass movement reports to the appropriate C2 facility. If necessary, the
       mission commander can call on an unclassified line and report. For example: ―Loaded
       and ready to go at site X, estimated time of departure (ETD) is 1400Z.‖
       2.4.4.4. Close-hold or Sensitive Missions. These missions may operate without AIMS
       setups.
   2.4.5. Reporting Agencies.

2.5. Search and Rescue Satellite-Aided Tracking (SARSAT). SARSAT is an international
satellite system for Search and Rescue (SAR). It consists of a constellation of seven satellites in
low earth orbit, 5 geostationary satellites and a network of earth stations, which provide distress
alert and location information to appropriate rescue authorities anywhere in the world for users in
distress. The SARSAT satellites detect beacons broadcasting on 406.025 Megahertz (MHz).
The current SARSAT system consists of 64 Local User Terminals (LUT) and 26 Mission
Control Centers in 32 countries, including 12 in the United States. SARSAT coverage on
406.025 MHz is worldwide. The Rescue Coordination Center (RCC) at Langley Air Force Base
(AFB), VA, maintains a deployable LUT capability (camper sized, air transportable vans) to
provide contingency coverage.
2.6. Designation of a COMAFSOF. The Commander, USSOCOM, or TSOC may designate a
COMAFSOF. This should be done in writing, and the designation letter will include the
individual by name, and the geographic area of authority. In the absence of a designated
AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011                                                              19


COMAFSOF; the AFSOC/A3 may grant COMAFSOF waiver authority to an individual in
writing.
2.7. Mission Commander. A mission commander will be designated when more than one
aircraft or crew is deployed away from home station for training, exercises, or other operations.
The mission commander will be rated, and should be a field grade officer. The mission will not
be a primary crew member for exercises, but may fly as a crew member on non-exercise related
missions. Mission commanders are responsible for overall mission execution as well as aircraft
and personnel supporting mission and duties which include, but are not limited to:
   2.7.1. Briefing crews on local operating procedures.
   2.7.2. Coordinating with Air Traffic Control (ATC), Combat Control Team (CCT), Special
   Tactics Squadron (STS), range control, users, and others that may have an impact on the
   mission.
   2.7.3. Ensuring personnel have ample and adequate billeting, eating, and transportation
   arrangements.
   2.7.4. Ensuring maintenance personnel know of aircraft and fuel requirements.
   2.7.5. Submitting timely reports on aircraft movements.

   2.8.6. Charged with keeping the applicable commander informed of mission progress and
   difficulties.
   2.8.7. For required maintenance support when away from home station, PICs will coordinate
   with 623d Combat Logistics Operations (623 AOC/CLO). CLO may be contacted at: DSN
   5798925/8935,       commercial     (850)-884-8925,     1-800-451-7705      or      e-mail
   623.AOC.CLO@afsoc.af.mil.
2.9. Airborne Mission Commander (AMC). The individual responsible for the overall
employment of all air assets assigned to the mission. Required for multi-element, multi-event
formations, and/or where mission complexity dictates. The AMC will not be a primary crew
member and should be on headset.
2.10. Deputy Mission Commander (DMC). Required on all missions employing a dedicated
AMC, on all multi-element formation missions, and on all single-element formations of three
aircraft or more. The DMC assumes command if conditions prevent the AMC from controlling
 20                                                  AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011


the mission. The DMC may be a primary crew member, and is usually the Formation
Commander on AMC controlled missions. The DMC will not be on the same aircraft as the
AMC. On missions not employing a dedicated AMC, the DMC is chosen from the PICs,
navigators, and CSOs involved in the formation.
2.11. Mission Clearance Decision. The final decision to delay a mission may be made either
by the agency with OPCON or the PIC when, in the opinion of either, conditions are not safe to
start or continue a mission. Final responsibility for the safe conduct of the mission rests with the
PIC. If the PIC refuses a mission, it will not depart until the conditions have been corrected or
improved so that the mission can operate safely. Another PIC and aircrew will not be alerted to
take the same mission under the same conditions.
   2.11.1. Diverting or rerouting a mission must be authorized by the commander with
   OPCON, except in an emergency or when required by en route or terminal weather
   conditions or facilities. In the event of an emergency or weather related divert or reroute, the
   mission commander PIC must notify the controlling authority as soon as possible.
       2.11.1.1. The controlling agency directing the diversion or rerouting is responsible for
       ensuring destination requirements or facilities are adequate for the aircraft and aircrew.
       2.11.1.2. The PIC will notify the controlling agency of any aircraft or aircrew limitations
       that may preclude diverting or rerouting the mission.
   2.11.2. When directing an aircraft to an alternate airfield, the controlling agency will ensure
   the PIC is provided existing and forecasted weather for the alternate. If the planned alternate
   is unsuitable upon arrival at destination, the controlling agency will advise the PIC of other
   suitable alternates.
2.12. Civilian Law Enforcement Support. It is the policy of the DoD to cooperate with
civilian law enforcement officials to the maximum extent practicable. AFI 10801, Assistance to
Civilian Law Enforcement Agencies, incorporates the appropriate directive and provides uniform
policies and procedures service members must follow when supporting federal, state, and local
civilian law enforcement agencies. It establishes specific limitations and restrictions on the use
of Air Force personnel, equipment, facilities, and services by civilian law enforcement
organizations. Report all requests for assistance and coordinate all requests from civilian law
enforcement authorities through the appropriate C2 channels.

                          AIRCRAFT OPERATING GUIDELINES

4.1. Objectives. The final responsibility regarding equipment required for a mission rests with
the PIC. If one crew accepts an aircraft to operate a mission or mission segment without an item
or system, this acceptance does not commit that crew, or a different crew, to accept subsequent
operations with the same item or system inoperative. When the PIC considers an item essential,
designate the component mission essential (ME) on the AFTO Form 781A, Maintenance
Discrepancy and Work Document, and the item will be repaired or replaced prior to departure.
4.2. Policy. This chapter provides guidance on how to operate with degraded equipment. If the
PIC elects to operate with degraded equipment or aircraft system(s), coordinate mission
requirements (i.e., revised departure times, fuel requirements, maintenance requirements, etc.)
prior to flight with the mission control agency to ensure the decision does not adversely impact
follow-on missions. AFRC aircraft on an AFRC mission identifier (MI) will comply with
AFRCI 11201, Flight Operations.
4.3. Aircraft Operating Guidelines:
   4.3.1. Pressurization and Air conditioning Systems: Pressurization and both air conditioning
   systems should be operational if patients are carried. If a system fails at an en route stop, the
   mission may continue (coordinate with the senior medical crew member when patients are
   carried) to a destination with repair capability. Required en route stops are authorized. Brief
   the passengers and patients on the possibility of personal discomfort. This is not required for
   low-level missions if a reasonable temperature can be maintained. Aircraft must comply
   with applicable T.O. avionics cooling requirements.
   4.3.2. Electrical System. All engine generators should be operational prior to departure from
   home station. If a generator fails at an en route stop, the mission may continue to a
   destination with repair capability. Required en route stops are authorized. If the aircraft is
   not equipped with generator disconnects, the generator will be removed and the mount
   padded before flight.
   4.3.3. An operative air turbine motor (ATM) or auxiliary power unit (APU) generator is
   required for unrestricted flight. If the system is inoperative, flight in daylight visual
   meteorological conditions (VMC) within 100 nautical miles (NM) of a suitable airfield is
   permissible provided no other electrical malfunction exists.
   4.3.4. Fuel System. The primary concern with inoperative fuel boost pumps or quantity
   indicators is fuel balance and wing loading. Degraded operation is permissible; however,
   flight crews must consider potentially trapped fuel and decreased range should further
   degradation occur. The following paragraphs provide guidelines for degraded fuel system
   operations under most circumstances.
       4.3.4.1. One pump must be operable for each external tank containing fuel.
       4.3.4.2. One main tank fuel indicator may be inoperative. Two main tank indicators may
       be inoperative provided they are not symmetrical tanks or on the same wing.
26                                                AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011


        4.3.4.2.1. Verify the tank with the inoperative indicator and its symmetrical tank
        quantity using a fuel tank dipstick.
        4.3.4.2.2. At en route stops when engines are shut down, dip check the tank with the
        inoperative indicator and the symmetrically opposite tank.
        4.3.4.2.3. Begin crossfeed operation when any main tank decreases to 2,000 pounds.
        4.3.4.2.4. Engine out training using the engine corresponding to the inoperative
        indicator or its symmetrically opposite will not be conducted during tank to engine
        operation.
        4.3.4.2.5. Maintain symmetrical engine fuel flow.
        4.3.4.2.6. Plan to land with a minimum of 8,000 pounds calculated main tank fuel.
     4.3.4.3. One external fuel tank indicator may be inoperative provided both external fuel
     tanks are checked full or empty. Both external fuel tank indicators may be inoperative
     provided both external tanks are checked empty. When an external tank indicator is
     inoperative and the tank cannot be visually checked empty due to foam modification,
     comply with the following prior to flight:
        4.3.4.3.1. Check pressure with each pump in the external tank. If no pressure is
        obtained, the tank is verified empty.
        4.3.4.3.2. If pressure is obtained, ground transfer the fuel from the external tank.
        Defuel the external tank if unable to ground transfer.
        4.3.4.3.3. When unable to verify an external tank is empty prior to engine start, place
        the tank on crossfeed until no pressure is obtained. This will be completed prior to
        takeoff.
     4.3.4.4. Both auxiliary tank indicators may be inoperative provided auxiliary fuel
     quantity is verified by the tank sight gauge.
     4.3.4.5. Both a main and external fuel tank indicator may be inoperative on the same
     wing provided steps in paragraphs 4.3.4.2 and 4.3.4.3 are followed.
     4.3.4.6. For other than normal ground refueling/defueling operations and associated
     guidelines per this chapter, fuel will not be transferred into or out of a main or external
     fuel tank with an inoperative indicator or its symmetrical tank except per the following
     guidance:
        4.3.4.6.1. Fuel transfer into a main or external tank with an inoperative indicator may
        be accomplished during contingency or emergency fuel situations only. All transfers,
        under these conditions, will be coordinated verbally and visually with the pilot/copilot
        as a backup for lateral wing balance.
            4.3.4.6.1.1. A reliable source of known quantity transferred must be available.
            This source can be either (AAR) gauges or internal operating fuel tank quantity
            indicators [HAAR/tilt-rotor air-to-air refueling (TAAR)].
            4.3.4.6.1.2. Maintain symmetrical tanks within 1,000 pounds at all times. If
            small amounts (4,000 pounds or less) must be transferred, then transfer up to
            1,000 pounds into the tank with the inoperative indicator followed by an equal
AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011                                                             27


             amount into the tank(s) with operative indicator(s). If large amounts of fuel must
             be transferred, then transfer 1,000 pounds into the tank with the inoperative
             indicator, then up to 2,000 pounds as needed into the tank(s) with the operative
             indicators, then up to 1,000 pounds as needed into the tank with the inoperative
             indicator to bring all tanks symmetrical, or continue up to 2,000 pounds as
             needed, repeating the cycle until desired fuel quantity and balance is achieved in
             applicable tanks.
         4.3.4.6.2. On MC130 tanker aircraft, fuel may be transferred from tanks with
         inoperative main or external tanks only if the receiver requires emergency fuel. In
         this situation, the following procedures will apply:
             4.3.4.6.2.1. The fuel flow counter for the refueling pod being used must be
             operational to track the amount of fuel transferred.
             4.3.4.6.2.2. Transfer from only one tank at a time.
             4.3.4.6.2.3. Transfer no more than 1,000 pounds at a time between the tanks with
             the inoperative indicator and its symmetrical tank to monitor fuel balance.
  4.3.5. Antiskid System: The antiskid may be inoperative for flight to a destination with
  repair capability. Required en route stops are authorized.
     4.3.5.1. A local training flight may continue once airborne if the antiskid fails provided
     the system is turned off. The mission is restricted to one termination landing.
     4.3.5.2. Maximum effort landings are not authorized with antiskid inoperative.
  4.3.6. Landing Gear System: If a landing gear system or position indicator malfunction is
  encountered, only a full stop landing will be made. The discrepancy will be corrected prior
  to the next flight. EXCEPTION: If repair capability does not exist and a positive
  determination is made that further flight can be accomplished with the gear down and locked,
  the aircraft may be flown to a destination where repair capability exists provided the gear is
  not moved from the down and locked position. Required en route stops are authorized.
  4.3.7. Doors and Ramp System: Aircraft will not depart on a pressurized flight unless the
  door warning light system for the cargo ramp is operative.
     4.3.7.1. Aircraft will not depart with a crew entrance door or crew entrance door warning
     light malfunction.
     4.3.7.2. Aircraft will not be flown pressurized with a cargo ramp lock malfunction.
     Unpressurized flight is authorized with a cargo ramp lock malfunction only when mission
     requirements dictate.
  4.3.8. Navigation Systems.
     4.3.8.1. Heading Sources. Two independent sources of heading are required. The C130
     standby compass is not considered a separate source of heading. NOTE: For flights
     above 72 degrees North two inertial navigation units (INU) or one INU and an operable
     global positioning system (GPS) are required.
28                                               AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011


         4.3.8.1.1. Inertial Navigation Units. On aircraft equipped with dual INUs both
         should be operational. If all the available INU(s) are inoperable refer to the flight
         manual to determine additional restrictions.
     4.3.8.2. Compass Systems. When two systems are installed, both should be operational.
     If one system fails, refer to the flight manual to determine what other equipment is
     affected.
     4.3.8.3. For flights on all other Category I routes, the PIC determines the minimum
     navigational capability required to safely accomplish the mission. Consider the
     following: length and route of flight, weather, experience, and proficiency of the crew.
     4.3.8.4. Drift and Ground Speed. Two independent sources of drift and ground speed are
     required for flight.
  4.3.9. Radar. Weather mode radar must be operative for flights into areas of known or
  forecast thunderstorms.
  4.3.10. The following systems (if equipped) should be operational as listed below for all
  departures unless parts are not available on station to repair the system.
     4.3.10.1. Enhanced Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (ETCAS). Comply
     with host nation rules governing aircraft flying without ETCAS.
     4.3.10.2. Ground Collision Avoidance System (GCAS).
  4.3.11. Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR). For failure after departure, flight may continue to a
  destination with repair capability. Required en route stops are authorized.
  4.3.12. Standby Instruments. On the MC130H, if the standby Attitude Direction Indicator
  (ADI) or Standby Vertical Velocity Indicator (VVI) is inoperative, the aircraft may only be
  flown in day VMC conditions. If any of the standby pitot-static instruments are inoperative,
  the aircraft will not be flown.
  4.3.13. Identification Friend or Foe/Selective Identification Feature (IFF/SIF). Refer to
  Chapter 6 for IFF/SIF requirements.

   5.3.7. PICs who possess less than 100 hours in command in the C130 aircraft since initial
   upgrade will make all takeoffs and landings when the right seat is occupied by a copilot (CP)
   or FP.
5.4. Copilot/First Pilot Landing Policy. Except as specified in paragraph 5.3.4., 5.3.6., and
provided no patients or distinguished visitor (DV) DV4 or higher are on board, copilots may
takeoff or land:
   5.4.1. From either seat if an IP or EP occupies the other seat.
   5.4.2. From the right seat if the PIC has accumulated at least 100 hours in command in the
   C130 aircraft since initial upgrade.
   5.4.3. Current and qualified mission copilots may accomplish NVG takeoffs and landings
   (non-maximum effort) from the right seat provided the pilot occupying the left seat is NVG
   airland current and qualified.
5.5. Landing Gear and Flap Operation.
   5.5.1. The pilot/CP occupying the right seat, or the Pilot Monitoring (PM) for MC130H, will
   operate the landing gear. Actuate the landing gear only after the command of the Pilot
   Flying (PF) the aircraft. Prior to actuation of the landing gear, the PM will acknowledge the
   command by repeating it. EXCEPTION: Not required during the INFIL/EXFIL checklist.
   5.5.2. The PIC may assign flap operation to either the PM or the FE. Operate the flaps only
   after the command of the PF. Prior to operating the flaps, acknowledge the command by
   repeating it and state ―Tracking‖ prior to initial flap movement.
5.6. Use of Outside Observers. Use crew members to assist in clearing during all taxi
operations and in-flight during arrivals and departures.
5.7. Seat Belts. Crew members occupying the pilot (P), CP and FE positions will have seat
belts fastened from engine start through shutdown, except as outlined in paragraph 5.3 and the
following.
   5.7.1. All occupants will be seated with seat belts fastened during taxi, takeoffs, and
   landings. EXCEPTION: Evaluators, instructors, mission commanders, crew members
   performing scanner duties, outside observers during taxi, FEs, LMs, and medical personnel

   when using combat loading procedures and required restraint available.
   5.7.2. Provide a safety belt for all occupants over 2 years of age. Occupants will fasten seat
   belts securely when turbulence is encountered or anticipated, or in areas of forecast clear air
   turbulence.
5.8. Aircraft Lighting. For single ship, non-tactical operations refer to AFI 11202V3. Use taxi
lights during all taxi operations. EXCEPTION: When taxi lights have infrared (IR) lens covers
installed, use the overt landing lights instead. Use landing lights at night in unlighted areas. Use
taxi lights in-flight any time the landing gear is extended unless reflections cause pilot
distractions in instrument conditions. Formation and leading edge lights should be on during
operations below 10,000 ft MSL. Landing lights may be used continuously during local traffic
pattern training and during low altitude maneuvering in high-density traffic areas.
AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011                                                              31


   5.8.1. NVG operations may dictate that external lights are turned off or IR lenses used.
   Conduct training operations with reduced or no external lighting within the confines of
   designated Restricted or Warning areas or host nation approved areas IAW AFI 11202V3.
   Single ship aircraft will display normal aircraft lighting outside Special Use Airspace (SUA).
   In standard formation, all aircraft except the last in the formation will display formation
   lights with brightness set and IR anticollision lights as required. The last aircraft in the
   formation will display lights in accordance with AFI 11202V3. NOTE: Formations may
   vary lighting as necessary provided adequate visual identification of the formation is
   maintained.
5.9. Advisory/Required Calls. The PF will periodically announce intentions during departures,
arrivals, approaches and when circumstances require deviating from normal procedures. Tables
5.1 through Table 5.4 depict mandatory calls for takeoff, climb out and descent, non-precision
and precision approaches.

 Note 1: With weather at CAT 1 minimums on a CAT 1 instrument landing system (ILS), the
 pilot may only see the initial portion of the approach lighting system (ALS). The pilot may
 continue to 100 ft height above touchdown (HAT) but may not descend below 100 ft above
 touchdown zone elevation using the ALS as a reference unless the red termination bars or the
 red side row bars are also visible and identifiable.
   5.9.1. Deviations:
       5.9.1.1. The PM will inform the PF when heading or airspeed deviations are observed, or
       when altitude is more than 100 ft from the desired and no attempt is being made to
       correct the deviation.
       5.9.1.2. Any crew member seeing a deviation of 200 ft altitude or 10 knots in airspeed,
       or a potential terrain or obstruction problem, will immediately notify the PF. Deviations
       from prescribed procedures will also be announced.
5.10. Runway Condition Reading (RCR) and Runway Surface Condition (RSC). The
performance charts used to determine braking action are based on concrete runways. The
runway surface should be considered wet when water on the runway causes a reflective glare.
The RCR values for the following runway surfaces in Table 5.5 are estimates based on
operational experience and should be used only as a guide.

Table 5.5. RCR Values.

   5.10.1. Limit C130 operations into and out of slush or water covered runways to a covering
   of one inch. This number is based on performance charts where an RSC of 10 is equal to one
   inch of slush or water.
5.11. Wake Turbulence Avoidance. Pilots must ensure wake turbulence avoidance criteria are
met during flight operations. Acceptance of a visual or contact approach clearance or
instructions to follow an aircraft is acknowledgment the pilot will maintain a safe interval for
wake turbulence avoidance. Adhere to aircraft wake turbulence avoidance and separation
criteria contained in DoD FLIP planning (General Planning (GP) Chapter 5).
AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011                                                             33


5.12. Landing Zone (LZ) Markings. LZ markings may vary depending upon the supporting
agency (refer to AFI 13217, Drop Zone and Landing Zone Operations. The markings to be used
must be firmly established during mission planning and included in the aircrew briefing.
5.13. Aircraft Rescue Fire Fighting Requirements (ARFF). ARFF requirements are as
follows:
   5.13.1. Not more than four takeoffs and four landings within seven consecutive days may be
   accomplished at a LZ or airfield without ARFF. This is an airfield restriction. Each
   Group/Wing should track totals at airfields under their control. If totals are not tracked at
   airfields owned/controlled by other agencies, Wing/Group current operations will track to
   ensure the restriction is not exceeded for assigned aircraft.
   5.13.2. For more frequent operations at a LZ or airfield, refer to AFPAM 322004, Aircraft
   Fire Protection for Exercises and Contingency Operations, to calculate ARFF requirements.
   NOTE: Non-USAF ARFF vehicles may be used if the agent and pumping capabilities are
   equivalent.
   5.13.3. Waivers to the ARFF requirements will be considered on a case-by-case basis.
   Required information for waiver request can be found in AFPAM 322004.
5.14. Runway and Taxiway Requirements. Use normal takeoff and landing procedures
whenever practical. For mission accomplishment, if approach end overruns are available and
stressed or authorized for normal operations, they may be used to increase the runway available
for takeoff. All speeds and distances will be computed ―without nosewheel steering.‖ When
required for mission accomplishment, the PIC may authorize ―with nosewheel steering‖
corrections on dry, hard-surfaced runways. Minimum runway width is 60 ft or 19 meters.
Minimum taxiway width is 30 ft or 9 meters.
   5.14.1. Normal Operations:
       5.14.1.1. Takeoff Minimum. The minimum runway length is the greater of balanced or
       unbalanced critical field length (CFL).
       5.14.1.2. Landing.   Minimum runway length is landing distance plus the following
       corrections:
          5.14.1.2.1. Runway Visual Range (RVR) less than 0400 (3/4 mile) – add 1,000 ft.
          5.14.1.2.2. RVR equal to or greater than 0400 (3/4 mile) – add 500 ft.
          5.14.1.2.3. If runway length available for landing is less than required by the
          previous criteria, crews may use landing ground roll plus 1,500 ft when approved by
          the squadron commander. Landing touchdown must occur in the first 500 ft of the
          runway/landing surface.
   5.14.2. Short Field Operations.
       5.14.2.1. Only maximum effort landing qualified crews may use short field procedures.
       Use of non-hard surfaced runways or taxiways requires Group Commander
       (COMAFSOF for contingency operations) approval. Groups may list approved locations
       in Chapter 10.
 34                                                 AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011


      5.14.2.2. Takeoff. Minimum runway length is charted minimum field length for
      maximum effort takeoff (MFLMETO). If runway available is greater than MFLMETO,
      then correct for one-engine inoperative air minimum control speed in ground effect
      (Vmca).
          5.14.2.2.1. When obstacles are a factor, use actual maximum effort takeoff speed
          (Vmeto) and climb out at maximum effort obstacle clearance speed. WARNING:
          Aircraft performance and obstacle clearance is based on obtaining and then
          maintaining obstacle clearance speed as quickly as possible. Aircraft performance
          below obstacle clearance speed may not allow safe clearance of obstacles.
          5.14.2.2.2. When conditions permit, takeoff at Vmca or Vmeto, whichever is greater.
      5.14.2.3. Landing. Minimum runway length is ground roll plus 500 ft.
      5.14.2.4. Training:
          5.14.2.4.1. Minimum runway length is 3,000 ft.
          5.14.2.4.2. Compute landing performance with 2 engines in reverse, 2 engines in
          ground idle and full brakes.
          5.14.2.4.3. Takeoff speed will be Vmca or Vmeto, whichever is greater.
          5.14.2.4.4. Obstacle clearance speed will be actual maximum effort obstacle
          clearance speed, or 10 knots above takeoff speed, whichever is greater.
          5.14.2.4.5. Simulated obstacle clearance height will not exceed 50 ft.
          5.14.2.4.6. Squadron commanders may authorize the use of actual max effort speeds
          (takeoff and obstacle clearance) on a case-by-case basis.
   5.14.3. NVG Operations:
      5.14.3.1. NVG normal and short field operations will be conducted IAW paragraphs
      5.14.1 and 5.14.2, respectively. If the touchdown zone is greater than 500 ft, or
      unmarked, minimum runway length is ground roll plus 1,000 ft. WARNING: On
      blacked out runways, a go-around point will be identified to all crew members prior to
      execution.
5.15. Aircraft Taxi Obstruction Clearance Criteria.
   5.15.1. Without wing walkers, avoid taxi obstructions by at least 25 ft; with wing walkers,
   by at least 10 ft. EXCEPTION: Locally based aircraft may taxi within 25 ft of obstacles
   without a wing walker when fixed taxi routes are marked and the obstruction is permanent,
   but will still be no closer than 10 ft. Taxi routes must be used by the same model aircraft for
   which they were designed and in the specifically designed parking spots. Support equipment
   shall be located in appropriately designated areas.
   5.15.2. Whenever taxi clearance is doubtful, use a wing walker.          If wing walkers are
   unavailable, deplane a crew member to ensure obstruction clearance.
   5.15.3. Use low speed ground idle when practical. If foreign object damage (FOD) is a
   problem, the outboard engines may be shut down provided gross weight, taxiway conditions,
   and weather are favorable.
AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011                                                                 35


   5.15.4. After landing and clearing the runway, with the approval of the pilot, the loadmaster
   may open the aft cargo door and lower the ramp to 12 inches above horizontal to prepare for
   cargo off-load or onload. Ensure all equipment, cargo, and passengers remain secured in the
   cargo compartment.
   5.15.5. Pilots will be advised of any known obstructions that penetrate shaded area in Figure
   5.1.

Figure 5.1. Ground Operations Obstruction Clearance Criteria.




5.16. Reverse Taxi.
   5.16.1. The pilot will coordinate engine status/utilization with the flight engineer and taxi
   directions and signals with the loadmaster and marshaller prior to commencing reverse taxi
   operations.
   5.16.2. Ensure all passengers are seated and cargo is secure prior to aircraft movement.
   5.16.3. Open aft cargo door and lower the ramp to approximately horizontal.
   5.16.4. The loadmaster will be on the ramp in a position to provide maximum visibility and
   direct reverse taxi. Report any hazards and provide the pilot with timely interphone
   instructions on turns, distance remaining, condition of the maneuvering area and stopping
   point. CAUTION: If four or five ground loading ramps or three canary slides are installed,
   at least one will be removed to allow unobstructed vision from the cargo ramp while backing.
   During night reverse taxi operations, the pilot and loadmaster will ensure that visibility in the
   taxi area is sufficient to conduct safe taxi operations, with or without wing walkers, avoid
   taxi obstacles by at least 25 ft.
5.17. Takeoff and Landing Obstruction Clearance Criteria.
   5.17.1. PICs will comply with the ASRR requirements prior to operating at airfields
   classified as ―special PIC airports‖ or ―certification airfields‖ by the ASRR.
 36                                                 AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011


   5.17.2. An airfield is considered suitable for C130 operations when no obstructions penetrate
   into the shaded area of Figure 5.2 This ensures obstruction clearance only if the aircraft is
   maintained within 35 ft of runway centerline and the angle of bank does not exceed 5
   degrees.
   5.17.3. When an obstruction penetrates the shaded area of Figure 5.2, specific approval by
   the Group Commander/COMAFSOF (for contingency operations) is required and the PIC
   must be advised of the height and location of the obstruction, as well as specific procedures
   to avoid the obstacle (i.e., landing beyond the obstacle).

Figure 5.2. Takeoff and Landing Obstruction Clearance Criteria.




5.18. Operations Over Arresting Cables.
   5.18.1. Avoid landing on (touching down on) arresting cables (does not include recessed
   cables). If the aircraft lands on or before the cable, the crew should contact the tower to have
   the cable inspected.
   5.18.2. Operations on runways where the arresting cable has less than eight tie-downs are
   authorized when required for mission accomplishment.
   5.18.3. For all operations over arresting cables, cross the cable on runway centerline at the
   minimum practical speed to minimize the potential for damage to the aircraft. Maintain
   appropriate back pressure on the aircraft yoke during taxi operations to reduce nose landing
   gear downforce.
5.19. Buddy and Windmill Taxi Starts. Buddy and windmill taxi starts may be performed
when required by the training syllabus or when approved by the Group Commander
(COMAFSOF for contingency operations).
   5.19.1. Group commanders may delegate this authority to their squadron or mission
   commanders when the unit is deployed. This authorization will not be construed to allow
   repeated buddy or windmill taxi starts at various scheduled en route stops. Load all
   passengers after completion of a buddy or windmill taxi start.
AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011                                                                 37


5.20. Inter. Takeoffs will normally be made from the beginning of the approved usable portion
of the runway. The decision to make intersection takeoffs rests solely with the PIC. Base
takeoff and landing data (TOLD) computations on the runway remaining at the point the takeoff
is initiated.
5.21. Minimum Engine Performance. Predicted torque will be checked on all AFSOC aircraft
prior to the first flight of the day. If predicted torque for a 95% engine (98% for MC130E terrain
following (TF) operations) cannot be obtained on all engines, the aircraft will not be flown. If
this check is not performed prior to lineup, a static takeoff will be performed to confirm torque
prior to takeoff roll.
   5.21.1. Request clearance from ground control or tower controller prior to an engine run-up.
   At no time will an engine run-up be attempted (throttles out of the ground range) unless the
   aircraft is in an approved engine run-up site or the active runway. Ensure the area behind the
   aircraft is clear before starting an engine run. NOTE: Clearance from either ground or tower
   does not constitute a safe environment for an engine run. Advise controller anytime
   propeller wash will cross the runway.
5.22. Reduced Power Operations. Reduced power operations are intended to prolong engine
service life (-15 engines).
   5.22.1. During proficiency flights (operations that are primarily confined to the traffic
   pattern), turbine inlet temperature (TIT) will normally be 900 degrees for takeoff, not to
   exceed 19,600 inch-pounds (in-lbs) of torque.
   5.22.2. TIT for tactical operations will normally be 970 degrees for takeoff, not to exceed
   19,600 in-lbs of torque. Higher power settings may be used, as required, and will be briefed
   by the pilot flying.
   5.22.3. Climb power to cruise altitude will be 970 degrees unless mission requirements
   dictate otherwise, not to exceed 19,600 in-lbs of torque.
   5.22.4. Use maximum power for max effort takeoffs (actual or simulated), not to exceed
   19,600 in-lbs of torque.
5.23. Three-Engine Takeoffs. Actual engine-out takeoffs require MAJCOM/A3 (COMAFSOF
for contingency operations) waiver.
5.24. Aircraft Recovery from Unprepared Surfaces. Aircrews should not attempt to recover
an aircraft after inadvertent entry onto surfaces that are not suitable for taxi. Ground crews using
appropriate equipment will normally recover the aircraft. Aircrews may recover the aircraft at
austere locations if, after thorough inspection, the PIC is sure there is no aircraft damage and the
surface will support the aircraft.
5.25. Engines Running Onload or Off-load (ERO). Do not use ERO procedures when
explosive cargo (hazard class 1.1-1.4) is involved unless authorized by the Joint Airborne/Air
Transportability Training (JA/ATT) or exercise operation order or contingency air tasking
orders. EXCEPTION: Small arms ammunition hazard class 1.4S may be on/off-loaded using
ERO procedures providing the total net explosive weight (NEW) does not exceed airfield
restrictions at the assigned on/off-load location.
   5.25.1. The ERO procedures in this paragraph may be used for any mix of personnel or
   cargo. The aft cargo door and ramp is preferred when more than 10 passengers are involved.
38                                                AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011


  The PIC will assess prevailing weather, lighting and parking location to ensure safe
  operations.
  5.25.2. General Procedures:
     5.25.2.1. The PIC will brief crew members on the intended ERO operation, emphasizing
     specific crew member duties.
     5.25.2.2. The parking brake will be set and one pilot will monitor brakes, interphone and
     radio.
     5.25.2.3. Operate engines in ground idle (low speed, if applicable). If conditions
     warrant, open air deflector doors and lower flaps to further reduce propeller blast.
     5.25.2.4. Turn wing leading edge lights on during night EROs. Taxi lights may be used
     at the discretion of the pilot.
     5.25.2.5. Complete passenger and cargo manifests, crew lists and DD Form 365-4,
     Weight and Balance Clearance Form F, for the subsequent sortie. NOTE: DD Form
     365-4 is not required for the subsequent sortie if the aircraft will depart empty.
     5.25.2.6. Resume taxi after the LM has verbally acknowledged the aircraft is ready to
     taxi.
     5.25.2.7. Do not onload or off-load through two different doors simultaneously.
     WARNING: Due to the hazards involved (i.e., propeller blast, proximity to engines and
     propellers, lack of paratroop door steps, etc.), only hand transferable items of cargo may
     be on/off-loaded through the paratroop doors during EROs.
  5.25.3. Personnel onload and off-load through the crew entrance door.
     5.25.3.1. The pilot will give clearance to open the crew entrance door.
     5.25.3.2. During on/off-load, station a crew member (normally the LM) on interphone
     (cord held taut) approximately 25 ft and at a 45-degree angle from the aircraft axis.
     5.25.3.3. Brief deplaning personnel to remain forward of the interphone cord.
  5.25.4. Personnel or cargo on/off-load through the aft cargo door and ramp.
     5.25.4.1. After the aircraft has slowed to taxi speed, the LM may remove all tie-downs
     except one forward and one aft restraint. Remove remaining restraints only after the
     aircraft is stopped and vehicle drivers are in place. Drivers will not release vehicle
     parking brakes until all restraints are removed and cleared to proceed by the LM.
     5.25.4.2. Upon clearance from the pilot, open the aft cargo door and lower the ramp to
     horizontal.
     5.25.4.3. The LM will direct all on/off-load operations using prebriefed signals.
     Passengers will be escorted by a crew member when enplaning or deplaning.
     5.25.4.4. Other qualified LMs may direct the operation, if available, but the crew
     loadmaster retains overall responsibility for the operation.
  5.25.5. Engine Running Crew Change (ERCC). Authorized during unit training missions.
  The enplaning crew will not approach the aircraft until the deplaning LM is in position on
AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011                                                       39


  headset outside the aircraft. Keep ERCCs to the absolute minimum necessary to accomplish
  the mission.

                                           Chapter 6

                         GENERAL OPERATING PROCEDURES

6.1. Aircrew Uniforms.
   6.1.1. See AFI 11301, Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE) Program, for minimum aircrew
   clothing requirements. All aircrew members will have flight gloves readily available during
   all flights and will wear them for takeoffs, landings, and when operating in a combat
   environment.
   6.1.2. Crew members will remove rings and scarves before performing aircrew duties.
6.2. Personal Requirements and Professional Equipment.
   6.2.1. Passports. Carry passports on missions when required by the Foreign Clearance
   Guide (FCG).
   6.2.2. Shot Records. Aircrew members will ensure they meet immunization requirements
   for the mission.
   6.2.3. Identification Tags. Identification tags should be worn around the neck or carried in a
   flight suit pocket.
   6.2.4. Restricted Area Badges. Carry the restricted area badge on all missions (except actual
   combat missions). Display the badge only in designated restricted areas.
   6.2.5. Tool and Airdrop Kits. A tool kit will be on board for all flights. Individual units will
   establish requirements for tools to be included in these kits and the crew member responsible
   for the kit (AFRC aircraft tool kits/aircraft Hostile Environment Repair Kit (HERK) satisfy
   this requirement). One LM airdrop kit will be on board for aerial delivery missions.
   6.2.6. Hostile Environment Repair Kit. One HERK will be on board for all OCONUS and
   contingency deployment missions. Units will identify where the HERK will be stored on the
   aircraft in the local supplement to this AFI. The flight engineer will ensure the HERK is on
   board and serviceable (secured) during the aircraft preflight prior to departure.
   6.2.7. Carry a headset, helmet and oxygen mask, and operable flashlight on all flights. Crew
   members will not wear wigs, hairpieces, rings, ornaments, pins, clips, other hair fasteners, or
   earrings in the aircraft or on the flightline. EXCEPTION: Plain elastic hair fasteners or
   plastic barrettes are allowed, providing they do not interfere with the wearing of headsets or
   helmets, or the donning of oxygen equipment. All devices will be accounted for before and
   after flight.
6.3. Aircrew Publications Requirements.
   6.3.1. Publications specified in Table 6.1 will be carried during all ground/flight operations.
   6.3.2. Electronic Publications (E-Pubs). All electronic media will be of equal or higher
   quality than paper versions and if used will require redundant e-tool viewing sources
   (hardware) on board the aircraft.
   6.3.3. Abbreviated checklists, approach/departures plates, standard instrument departure
   (SID), and standard terminal arrival route (STAR) publications will remain in paper format
AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011                                                              41


   unless an approved e-tool device is authorized. FLIP may also be viewed/utilized in-flight
   via an approved e-tools device.
   6.3.4. Operations Group Stan/Eval (OG/OGVs) will develop procedures and standards for
   the e-pubs program. At a minimum, procedures will address a data backup plan at the
   OG/OGV level for the master publications file. For this purpose, utilize three separate data
   media storage devices (e.g., CD-ROM, hard drive, and local area network drive). If at all
   feasible, these data sources should be physically separated from each other in the event of
   catastrophic failure (e.g., fire, tornado, etc.). Additionally, OG/OGVs will develop a plan to
   obtain the most current publications and aircrew members will update their publications at
   least monthly and prior to performing flight duties. OG/OGVs will also develop a method by
   which read-only publications will be provided to the end user/aircrew and the timing of and
   process by which supplements to each publication will be posted. This method will also
   include procedures for maintaining electronic and paper publications concurrently, if
   appropriate. Each level (MAJCOM, Group, and Squadron) will be responsible for posting
   their particular supplements to publications; ultimately, the end user still bears the
   responsibility for properly posted publications in either electronic or paper format. Lastly,
   OG/OGVs will establish procedures for in-flight use focusing on accessibility and reliability
   of information. In this regard, OG/OGVs are encouraged to restrict data source types to
   ensure hardware capability in all crew positions. OG/OGVs will publish additional
   restrictions as necessary to ensure the e-pubs program does not require a greater workload in
   flight than the current model of paper products.
       6.3.4.1. Electronic copies (CD-ROM, flash media, etc.) of unit publications library are
       acceptable for deployments with appropriate equipment/software to view publications.
       Ensure all copies are up-to-date and publications not available electronically are to be
       maintained in paper format. Appropriate equipment to view these files must be available.

       6.4.1.1. Crew members delinquent in FCIF and joining a mission en route will receive an
       FCIF update from their primary aircrew member counterpart on that mission. Instructor
       pilots flying with general officers are responsible for briefing appropriate FCIF items.
       6.4.1.2. Crew members that do not have a unit FCIF card (not assigned or attached to the
       unit) will certify FCIF review by entering the last FCIF number and their initials beside
       their name on the file copy of the flight authorization or the orders.
6.5. Aircraft Mission Kits. Units will maintain one mission kit per aircraft. The entire mission
kit may be stored electronically on an approved e-tools device and must follow the AF and
MAJCOM guidelines established. Prior to off-station departures, the PIC or a designated
representative will ensure a current mission kit is on board the aircraft in electronic or paper
format. The kit will contain, but is not limited to, the items listed in Table 6.2.
   6.5.1. Formal school units will establish the content of the mission kit for assigned aircraft.
   Items required by a unit or wing directive to be carried by an individual crew member need
   not be duplicated in the mission kit. Maintain sufficient quantities of directives and planning
   documents to allow implementation of evacuation and contingency plans.

 Note 1: Two required when a navigator is not part of the crew.
6.7. Communications Security (COMSEC) and Classified Material. Obtain and safeguard
current COMSEC and other classified/keying material required for the mission. Carry
authenticators and IFF Mode IV codes, when flying into an Air Defense Identification Zone
(ADIZ), participating in exercises, on overseas missions, deployments, and when specified in
operation plans.
   6.7.1. The base COMSEC custodian has access to the AFKAG 44/AFKAG 14 and can assist
   in obtaining the material required for the mission. Squadrons maintain the COMSEC
   material used on most missions. All squadron members that require access to COMSEC
   material will be properly trained. Base/squadron COMSEC Responsible Officer (CRO) is
   the point of contact (POC) for current training requirements.
   6.7.2. Command and Control Centers (CCCs) will provide temporary storage for
   COMSEC/classified materials during ground time at en route stops. Issue and turn-in of
   COMSEC is normally a function of the squadron CRO. At locations where no storage
   facilities exist, classified materials may be stored in the aircraft safe, if available.
       6.7.2.1. Remove classified/sensitive information (such as secure voice/DAMA, IFF,
       mission information) stored in all aircraft systems.
   6.7.3. In the event of an emergency, destroy classified material and equipment prior to crash
   landing or bailout, if possible.
6.8. Briefing Requirements. Refer to the appropriate AFSOC briefing guides for content.
Crew members will not fly unless they attend the crew briefings for their mission.
EXCEPTION: When pre-mission requirements dictate, PIC may excuse certain crew members
from the briefing. The PIC will ensure that those personnel receive a face-to-face briefing prior
to engine start.
6.9. Checklists. Aircrews must be familiar with notes, warnings, and cautions without direct
reference to the T.O.
   6.9.1. The only pages (or inserts) authorized in checklist binders are C130 series T.O.
   aircrew checklists, AFSOC-approved checklists, briefing guides, and unit-approved
   information guides. Units may construct locally approved in-flight guides using AF Form
   4124, Flight Crew Information Guide.
   6.9.2. Any personal notes on checklists, briefings, or information guides must be current.
   6.9.3. Abbreviated checklist items that do not apply to unit aircraft or mission may be lined
   out.
   6.9.4. The FE may read all checklists.
6.10. Call Signs. Use Voice Call Sign Listing (VCSL) or as specified in mission
directives/tasking for all missions except local area training missions. Use squadron or wing
static call signs as directed for local area training missions.
   6.10.1. Aeromedical Evacuation. Preface normal call sign with "AIR EVAC" when patients
   are on board.
AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011                                                                45


   6.10.2. Search and Rescue (SAR). When tasked to participate in SAR operations, use the
   call sign "AIR FORCE RESCUE" plus the last five digits of the aircraft tail number.
6.11. Fuel Planning. Use the appropriate fuel planning publication or Technical Order
specified in Chapter 11, or an approved mission planning system. Use primary fuel
management, in accordance with the aircraft flight manual and AFI 11-202 V3, MAJCOM Sup,
whenever practical.
6.12. Wind Limitations. Maximum crosswind limits are in accordance with aircraft T.O.
limitations. Remain within the ―Recommended‖ or ―Caution‖ areas of the crosswind charts for
normal takeoffs and landings.      All maximum effort operations must fall within the
―Recommended‖ area unless otherwise approved by the Group Commander/COMAFSOF (for
contingency operations).
6.13. Departure/Arrival Planning. Comply with AFI 11202V3 and AFMAN 11217V1,
Instrument Flight Procedures. If using a flight plan furnished by another agency, the PIC and
navigator will verify routes and flight altitudes to ensure proper terrain clearance.
   6.13.1. The PIC will provide the obstacle height, distance, and gradient information
   necessary for performance computations for the departure, alternate, and destination airfields
   to the flight engineer. A pilot crew member or additional flight engineer will cross check the
   TOLD card(s) for accuracy using the performance manual, TOLD computer, or approved
   tabulated data. At a minimum, the person checking the data will:
       6.13.1.1. Verify gross weight independently from both TOLD cards.
       6.13.1.2. Cross-check air minimum control, takeoff, and landing speeds.
       6.13.1.3. Review and compare the computed distances, ground roll, and climb gradient
       (if applicable) with the actual conditions, runway available, and departure procedures.
6.14. AFTO Form 781. Review the AFTO Form 781 before applying power to the aircraft or
operating aircraft systems. The exceptional release (ER) must be signed before flight. A
maintenance officer, maintenance superintendent, or authorized civilian normally signs the ER.
If one of these individuals is not available, the PIC may sign the ER. Ensure that the DD Form
1896, Jet Fuel Identiplate and AIR card are on board the aircraft.
6.15. One-Time Flights. An aircraft may be released for a one-time flight with a condition that
might be hazardous for continued use, provided the aircraft is airworthy for one flight to a repair
station. Refer to T.O. 00201, Aerospace Equipment Maintenance Inspection, Documentation,
Policies, and Procedures, for downgrade authority and procedures.
   6.15.1. One-time flight approval authority is OG/CC or equivalent level CC with OPCON.
   The owning Maintenance Group (MXG)/CC (or designated official), the senior maintenance
   officer, or the on-site chief of an AFMC repair team must first authorize the release. PIC
   concurrence is required before the aircraft can be flown. NOTE: AFRC crews also see AFI
   11202V3 and applicable AFRC Supplements.
   6.15.2. For Red X clearing at stations without maintenance support refer to Chapter 12.
6.16. Dash One Preflight. The aircrew Dash One preflight inspection, once completed, is valid
for 72 hours provided the aircraft is sealed, or continuously monitored by squadron personnel.
 46                                                  AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011


   6.16.1. When an aircrew assumes a preflighted spare or quick-turn, a thorough visual
   inspection will be performed, paying particular attention to areas affected by maintenance or
   servicing.
   6.16.2. Except to prepare for Operational Readiness Exercises (ORE), Operational
   Readiness Inspections (ORI), and contingencies/evacuations, Dash One preflight inspections
   are normally done in preparation for flight by the aircrew assigned to fly the mission
   designated for that aircraft, that day. Do not schedule preflight crews to perform preflight
   inspections on primary aircraft for local training flights.
       6.16.2.1. The following guidelines apply to aircrew assigned to preflight and/or seal
       aircraft. A crew will not preflight more than four aircraft in a 12-hour period. Refer to
       crew rest/flight duty period guidance in AFI 11202V3. Aircrews performing preflight
       duties will be afforded 12 hours rest between preflight shifts.
       6.16.2.2. Duties not involving flying (DNIF) crew members may accomplish preflights
       with the concurrence of the flight surgeon. It is the responsibility of the crew member to
       know his/her duty limitations. Crew members should have the flight surgeon document
       the AF Form 1042 appropriately IAW with AFI 48123, Medical Examinations and
       Standards.
6.17. Alert Aircraft Procedures. Maintain aircraft on alert status as follows:
   6.17.1. Park the aircraft in a designated alert parking area to expedite taxi and takeoff.
   6.17.2. Aircraft preflight times should align the alert period and aircraft preflight validity
   period, eliminating the need to update the preflight during the alert period.
   6.17.3. The alert aircraft may be flown for purposes other than actual alert missions provided
   the following conditions are met:
       6.17.3.1. Ensure sufficient fuel remains on board to meet alert commitments.
       6.17.3.2. Maintain communications with the primary controlling agency.
       6.17.3.3. If maintenance actions are not required, the aircraft can be resealed for alert
       once the THRU-FLIGHT inspection is completed. In all cases, a new preflight is not
       required until the end of the initial preflight period.
   6.17.4. A DD Form 365-4, Weight and Balance Clearance, Form F, will be prepared for the
   alert aircraft. Alert crews are authorized to prepare a TOLD card using the worst weather
   conditions expected for the alert period. Use the TOLD for alert scrambles. If the alert
   aircraft is flown for other reasons, use TOLD for the existing weather conditions.
   6.17.5. If the alert aircraft is changed to a different preflighted/sealed aircraft, or an alert
   crew change occurs and the same aircraft remains on alert, the preflight or alert crew will, at
   a minimum, apply power to the aircraft and check the following systems (as applicable):
       6.17.5.1. AFTO Form 781, Arms Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document.
       6.17.5.2. Interior and exterior for proper configuration and special equipment.
       6.17.5.3. Fuel quantity.
       6.17.5.4. Survival and emergency equipment.
AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011                                                                 47


      6.17.5.5. Navigation and communication equipment.
      6.17.5.6. Liquid oxygen quantity.
      6.17.5.7. Hydraulic reservoirs and accumulator charges.
      6.17.5.8. Publications.
   6.17.6. Should an aircraft remain on alert for more than 72 hours, a complete aircrew
   preflight is then required.
   6.17.7. Once the aircraft is accepted for alert, the flight engineer will ensure an entry is made
   in the AFTO Form 781H, Aerospace Vehicle Flight Report and Maintenance Document,
   stating, at a minimum, the date and time the aircraft was preflighted.
   6.17.8. Alert aircraft are off limits to all personnel except alert crew members. No
   maintenance may be performed on the aircraft without the approval of the unit/mission
   commander. Upon receiving orders to launch, the crew is required to check the area in which
   maintenance was performed prior to flight.
6.18. Aircraft Servicing and Ground Operations.
   6.18.1. Aircraft Refueling. Crew members may perform refueling duties at austere locations
   or at stations without maintenance support. Aircrews should not refuel except in cases when
   maintenance support is not readily available and the mission would be delayed.
   6.18.2. Concurrent Ground Operations. Simultaneous aircraft refueling/defueling and cargo
   loading or maintenance operations is authorized in accordance with T.O. 0025172, Ground
   Servicing of Aircraft and Static Grounding/Bonding. Refueling or defueling with passengers
   or patients on board is only authorized for aeromedical evacuation missions.
   6.18.3. Liquid Oxygen (LOX) Servicing. Under no conditions are crew members allowed to
   service liquid oxygen.
   6.18.4. Forward Area Refueling Point Operations. Refer to AFI 11235, Forward Area
   Refueling Point (FARP).
   6.18.5. Fire Protection, Ground Operations and Crash Rescue.
      6.18.5.1. The aircraft engine fire extinguisher system fulfills the minimum requirements
      for fire protection during engine start. If available, position a portable fire extinguisher
      for added fire protection.
      6.18.5.2. A fireguard is required for all engine starts. In the absence of additional ground
      personnel, the LM or ground controller may act as fireguard.
   6.18.6. Propulsion System Checks (Engine Runs). When conducting maintenance-requested
   propulsion system checks, comply with the following:
      6.18.6.1. Prior to conducting the checks, complete an operational risk management
      (ORM) assessment and review risk mitigation actions. The minimum crew complement
      for the checks will be the crew complement required for aircraft taxi. Start with the
      preflight checklist and accomplish all checklists through before leaving the aircraft
      checklist.
 48                                                  AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011


      6.18.6.2. During the propulsion system checks, follow normal flight manual procedures
      and limitations (do not combine maintenance procedures/limitations into the checks). Set
      power as requested and relay instrument readings, but limit troubleshooting to the scope
      of the aircraft flight manual. Checks requiring functional check flight (FCF) procedures
      will be performed by FCF-qualified crews.
      6.18.6.3. When conducting propulsion system checks in areas of reduced traction, ensure
      all personnel on board are seated with lap belts fastened.
   6.18.7. Towing. Aircrew members will not normally participate in towing operations. The
   PIC will coordinate with the senior maintenance officer or superintendent to ensure the
   towing supervisor and crew are qualified. At non-USAF installations, the PIC must have
   approval from the airfield operations officer or manager prior to towing. The PIC will ensure
   the tow team supervisor briefs all personnel on their duties and the associated hazards.
   Proper checklists will be used. If any doubt exists as to the qualification of tow team
   personnel or the safety of the operation, make no attempt to tow the aircraft until qualified
   Air Force personnel can be located. Under no circumstances will any crew member act as
   the towing supervisor.
   6.18.8. When thunderstorms are reported within 10 NM of the airfield, only operations
   leading to an immediate engine start and departure may continue. However, personnel must
   be prepared to cease all activities in the event lightning within 5 NM is declared. When
   advised of lightning within 5 NM of the airfield, all flight line activities will cease and
   personnel will seek shelter.
   6.18.9. Aircraft taxiing to parking or hot cargo when lightning is declared within 5 NM
   should not expect a marshaller. The aircrew will hold in place or proceed to parking if
   clearance is assured. Remain in the aircraft if ground transportation cannot be arranged.
   Time permitting, coordinate with Base Operations if the aircraft will be parked in a location
   other than one assigned.
   6.18.10. (MC130W) Munitions loading will not be initiated unless it can be completed
   before lightning becomes a hazard. If munitions loading has begun and lightning becomes a
   hazard, the crew will cease loading and depart the flightline. Ensure that the Command Post
   is aware that there will be an unattended aircraft with munitions. If lightning is declared
   within 5 NM, any taxiing aircraft with munitions on board will return to an appropriate
   parking location based on the munitions loaded. If an immediate takeoff is the safer course
   of action, crews may continue taxiing for takeoff.
6.19. Aircrew Flight Equipment and Oxygen Requirements.
   6.19.1. The PIC or designated representative will ensure appropriate serviceable protective
   clothing, aircrew flight equipment, survival equipment, and Dash 21 equipment for the entire
   mission are available prior to flight and all personnel are briefed or trained in their use prior
   to departing home station.
      6.19.1.1. Prior to departing home station and following en route crew changes, the PIC
      or designated representative will review the AFTO Form 46, Prepositioned Aircrew
      Flight Equipment, to ensure all required equipment is on board and required inspections
      have been completed. The PIC or designated crew member will document and ensure
AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011                                                               49


     missing aircrew flight equipment is annotated in both the AFTO Form 781A and AFTO
     Form 46.
  6.19.2. Oxygen. Oxygen on board for takeoff will be a minimum of 5 liters. On aircraft
  with two LOX systems, at least one system must meet this requirement. For the MC-130W
  75-liter LOX system, oxygen on board for takeoff will be a minimum of 10 liters. On
  missions with passengers, carry passenger emergency oxygen systems, passenger oxygen kits
  (POK), emergency passenger oxygen system (EPOS), or other approved system) if flight
  above FL 250 is anticipated. Do not block access to these systems during flight. Distribute
  and demonstrate proper use prior to climbing through FL 250. WARNING: The POK does
  not protect the wearer from smoke or fumes.
     6.19.2.1. Crew members will accomplish a communications and operations check of
     their oxygen system prior to flight, which will remain connected and readily available
     when occupying a primary crew position. Walk around bottles do not satisfy this
     requirement. EXCEPTION: (MC130W) Walk-around bottles may be used while crew
     members are transitioning between primary crew position stations.
  6.19.3. Life Rafts. Ensure sufficient wing well life rafts are onboard to accommodate all
  passengers and aircrew members on overwater flights.
  6.19.4. Life Preserver Units (LPU). For overwater flights, ensure a sufficient quantity of life
  preservers are onboard for all passengers and crew members. While overwater, LPUs will be
  sized and readily available at the crew member‘s station, and worn whenever below 2,000 ft
  overwater (except for takeoff, approach and landing). Crew members wearing a parachute or
  harness during air refueling overwater will also wear an LPU. For overwater missions
  carrying children and infants, ensure the appropriate number and types of LPUs are on board.
  NOTE: Infil/exfil and parachutist operations may preclude issuing aircraft LPUs to user
  personnel. In this case, ensure sufficient LPUs are on board for all personnel. The airlift unit
  is responsible for supply of LPU‘s.
  6.19.5. Anti-exposure suits. Anti-exposure suits will be available during overwater flights
  when route of flight is beyond power off gliding distance from land and the water
  temperature is 60 degrees Fahrenheit (F) or below. EXCEPTION: Anti-exposure suits are
  not required when only the approach or departure is flown over water. If the water
  temperature ranges between 51 degrees F and 60 degrees F, the unit or mission commander
  may waive or extend the anti-exposure suit requirement after consideration of all risk factors.
  6.19.6. Parachutes. All AFSOC C130 aircraft will be configured with one parachute for
  each crew member. Units will dictate use of parachutes during combat or acceptance flights.
  6.19.7. Restraint Harness.
     6.19.7.1. Personnel performing duties near an open door in-flight will preflight and wear
     a parachute or restraint harness. Wear a restraint harness during operations below 1,000
     ft AGL. Fit the restraint harness and adjust the lifeline prior to stations time. NOTE:
     Connect the hook to a point that will preclude the wearer from exiting the aircraft.
     Connect the lifeline when at or anticipating moving aft of flight station (FS) 677.
 50                                                  AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011


       6.19.7.2. The restraint harness lifeline may be attached to an unused, preflighted anchor
       cable that has an anchor cable stop positioned and taped at FS 737. Do not connect the
       lifeline to an anchor cable that has a parachute static line(s) attached to it for an airdrop.
   6.19.8. Survival Kits/Vests. All AFSOC C130 aircraft will be configured with one survival
   kit (ML-4) for each aircrew member for flights conducted beyond gliding distance of land.
   Survival vests may be used in lieu of survival kits if the mission will not be conducted
   beyond gliding distance of land.
   6.19.9. Helmets. All crew members will preflight and wear their helmets during
   contingency and combat missions. At a minimum, helmets will be worn between the
   COMBAT ENTRY and COMBAT EXIT checklists.
       6.19.9.1. (MC130W) All crew members in the cargo compartment will wear flight
       helmets while the gun is configured for live fire. Any other personnel in the cargo
       compartment will wear protective head gear, if available, and will remain aft of the
       mission operator pallet (MOP) while the gun is configured for live fire.
       6.19.9.2. Mobile crew members in the cargo compartment will wear helmets during all
       actual airdrop operations from the Twenty-Minute Warning through the completion of
       the airdrop checklist. EXCEPTION: Standard airdrop training bundles (SATB) drops.
       WARNING: Personnel in the cargo compartment will not be seated under the anchor
       cables or static line retriever cables that are rigged for use unless cargo compartment
       configuration or mission requirements dictate otherwise. In that event, protective
       headgear will be worn. Personnel will not position themselves directly under the center
       anchor cable supports (A-frames, FS 737) during personnel or equipment airdrops
       requiring the use of the anchor cable. NOTE: When conditions require personnel in the
       cargo compartment to wear protective headgear, the flight helmet will be worn with the
       chinstrap fastened.
       6.19.9.3. Eye Protection. All personnel aft of FS 617 should wear eye protection during
       any mission requiring doors to be open.
6.20. Departure Briefing. The pilot making the takeoff will brief the crew in accordance with
published AFSOC briefing guides.
6.21. IFF/SIF Operations.
   6.21.1. Aircraft will not depart with an inoperative IFF/SIF without the approval of ATC and
   the PIC. Exception: Formations must have at least one operational IFF/SIF per element.
   6.21.2. Perform a ground check of the IFF/SIF before takeoff, using either the self-test,
   ground radar interrogator or ground test equipment.
   6.21.3. If the self-test is unacceptable and radar facilities do not permit a ground check,
   takeoff is authorized if the IFF/SIF was operational on the previous mission. Accomplish an
   airborne check after takeoff.
   6.21.4. Use the IFF/SIF in accordance with Table 6.4 NOTE: Once set and transmitted,
   IFF/SIF modes 1, 2, and 3/A codes are unclassified and may be left in the transponder.

   6.21.5. Conduct an in-flight check of the Mode 4 after takeoff where facilities are available.
   Do not delay takeoff nor cancel a mission for an inoperable Mode 4. EXCEPTION:
   Aircrews will ensure they have an operable Mode 4 prior to departure if the aircraft will
   transit an area where safe passage procedures are implemented or when required for mission
   accomplishment.
   6.21.6. If Mode 4 fails in-flight, crews may continue to their intended destination if use is no
   longer required. If use is required, the aircraft will be landed and repairs will be
   accomplished at the first repair facility.
6.22. Ground Collision Avoidance System Operations. The GCAS system, if installed, on
AFSOC aircraft has two tactical annunciator/switches (audio and visual). Operate the GCAS in
the normal mode (audio on and visual on) for all non-tactical operations.
   6.22.1. When a GCAS alert advisory/warning occurs and terrain/obstacles are clearly in
   sight, the flying pilot will call terrain/obstacle in sight, state intentions and visually clear the
   terrain/obstacle.
   6.22.2. When a GCAS alert advisory/warning occurs and terrain/obstacles are not clearly in
   sight, immediately level off/begin a climb while rolling wings level and add maximum power
   until the warning has ceased and adequate terrain/obstacle clearance is verified. Conditions
   may require the execution of the emergency climb procedure described in Chapter 17.
   WARNING: Do not delay pull-up for diagnosis of a GCAS warning. Failure to roll wings
   level during the maneuver described above will decrease stall margin and climb gradient.
6.23. ETCAS Operations.
   6.23.1. ETCAS event documentation. The PIC will document all pertinent information
   surrounding an RA event on the AF Form 651 and submit the report to the nearest Air Force
   safety office. NOTE: This system was not designed for use in the low-level environment,
   but could provide valuable awareness of light aircraft or other military aircraft using military
   airspace.
6.24. Navigational Aid Capability.
   6.24.1. Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum (RVSM) Airspace. Airspace where RVSM
   is applied is considered special qualification airspace. The specific aircraft type must be
 52                                               AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011


   approved for operations in these areas.      Crews will refer to FLIP AP/2 for other
   requirements.
   6.24.2. Required Navigation Performance (RNP) Airspace and Basic Area Navigation
   (BRNAV) Airspace. Pilots will immediately notify ATC if any of the FLIP or International
   Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) required equipment fails after entry into RNP or
   BRNAV airspace. NOTE: Airspace and associated navigational aid equipment capability
   are rapidly evolving. Crews must maintain an in-depth knowledge of current FLIP
   requirements/policies.
6.25. Communications Policy.
   6.25.1. All crew members will monitor interphone. Crew members will notify the PIC
   before going off headset and when back on headset.
      6.25.1.1. Do not discuss classified information on the interphone during radio
      transmissions.
      6.25.1.2. Non-aircrew members may monitor interphone or radio transmissions only
      when specifically approved by the PIC. The PIC will brief communications policy to
      these personnel prior to flight. The PIC must ensure no one monitors classified
      information for which they are not cleared or transmits classified information over the
      radios.
      6.25.1.3. Sterile Cockpit. Limit conversation to that essential for crew coordination and
      mission accomplishment during taxi, takeoff, approach, landing, and any flight below
      10,000 ft mean sea level (MSL). Crew members will confine their activities to aircraft
      operation, descent and approach monitoring, and checklist accomplishment from the
      initial descent point to block in.
      6.25.1.4. Loadmasters may clear off interphone with PIC approval after
      acknowledgement of the 20-minute warning. After completing the required 20-minute
      checklist items, the primary LM will remain on interphone throughout the completion of
      the checklist.
   6.25.2. Command Radios:
      6.25.2.1. The pilot (or designated crew member) will inform the crew which radio is
      primary.
      6.25.2.2. All crew members will monitor the primary radio unless specifically directed to
      do otherwise by the PIC or subsequent chapters of this instruction. The PIC will
      designate crew members required to monitor the HF and/or SATCOM radio.
      6.25.2.3. During emergencies, monitor simultaneous ultra-high frequency (UHF) and
      very-high frequency (VHF) transmissions, if able, when operating in a terminal area
      under radar control.
      6.25.2.4. One of the pilots or AMSS will record and read back all ATC clearances. The
      navigator will record the clearance and monitor the read back. This may be disregarded
      when ATC instructions require immediate execution or when such action interferes with
      timely completion of more important duties.
AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011                                                                 53

             current listing of home telephone
             numbers for POCs.
   6.26.2. Continued Flight with Engine Loss. A flight may proceed on three engines to its
   destination if two-engine capability exists, favorable operating conditions prevail en route
   and at the point of intended landing and a suitable alternate airfield is available at all times.
   If these conditions cannot be met, the flight will terminate at the nearest facility (preferably
   military) which, in the judgment of the PIC, offers safe and favorable operating conditions.
   6.26.3. Fuel Jettisoning. Fuel will not be jettisoned except in combat, emergency conditions,
   or rescue missions requiring gross weight reduction.
       6.26.3.1. Advise ATC should it become necessary to jettison fuel.
6.27. Need for Medical Assistance. When a person on board the aircraft requires medical care,
the PIC will inform the station of next intended landing in sufficient time so medical personnel
may meet the aircraft.
6.28. Arrival Briefing. The pilot making the landing and the navigator/EWO will brief the
crew in accordance with published AFSOC briefing guides.
   6.28.1. The PM and navigator will monitor the approach and report any deviations from
   prescribed procedures.

6.30. Radar Altimeter Procedures. Set the radar altimeters in accordance with the flight
manual for non-tactical operations. Pilots and navigators will cross-check radar altimeters
during descent to ensure adequate terrain clearance is provided throughout the descent and
maneuvering portion of the approach. Once established in a visual flight rules (VFR) traffic
pattern, the radar altimeter may be set at the discretion of the pilot.
6.31. Maintenance. Complete the AFTO Form 781 after each flight.
   6.31.1. Immediately after arrival, the PIC and any crew position documenting a maintenance
   discrepancy will debrief maintenance personnel on the status of the aircraft and subsystems
   and discrepancies entered into the AFTO Form 781A document. At stations where there is
   no AFSOC maintenance and maintenance support is required, the PIC will ensure a thorough
   debrief is provided to the controlling CCC prior to entering crew rest.
   6.31.2. Aircrews will complete the AFTO Form 781A as needed. The PIC will review the
   aircraft forms, determine those discrepancies considered as mission essential, and indicate
   them by entering ‗ME‘ in block letters in the lower left hand corner of the AFTO Form 781A
   discrepancy block. Use ‗MC‘ (mission contributing) to indicate any discrepancies that, if not
   corrected, would substantially effect mission accomplishment, but are not mission essential.
   6.31.3. Use Block 14 (discrepancy) of the AFTO Form 350, Repairable Item Processing
   Tag, with an AFTO Form 781 entry to identify and tag any defective item of equipment such
   as headsets, thermos jugs, etc.
   6.31.4. Ensure flight time, landings, aircraft condition, and fuel onloaded/off-loaded during
   refueling operations is entered in the AFTO Form 781H.
6.32. Clearwater Rinse Facility (Birdbath).
   6.32.1. Crews should use a clear water rinse facility (birdbath) after every flight in which the
   aircraft is flown over saltwater below 3,000 ft, including tactical approaches. Two or more
   takeoffs and/or landings, including touch and go landings, over salt water require a clear
   water rinse after the last flight of the day per T.O. 11691, Cleaning and Corrosion
   Prevention and Control, Aerospace and Non-Aerospace Equipment. EXCEPTION: Aircraft
   equipped with large aircraft infrared countermeasures (LAIRCM) small laser turret
   assemblies (SLTA) will not utilize the bird bath with the turrets installed due to water
   intrusion problems.
   6.32.2. If a birdbath facility is unavailable, make the following annotation in the AFTO
   Form 781A: ―Aircraft subjected to salt spray, birdbath unavailable.‖ The following
   guidance will be used to maximize the effectiveness of the birdbath and to ensure safe
   operations.
       6.32.2.1. Ensure sensors such as the radar/infrared detection set (IDS) are off prior to
       entering the birdbath.
       6.32.2.2. The gas turbine compressor (GTC), ATM, ATM generator or APU will remain
       off with doors closed to prevent flameout and flooding of the GTC/APU compartment.
       6.32.2.3. Set flaps to 100%. Turn off and extend both normal and auxiliary landing
       lights (if applicable).
AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011                                                                55


       6.32.2.4. Complete the AFTER LANDING checklist after rinse is completed, run
       engines at normal ground idle for a minimum of two minutes to aid in drying out engine
       nacelles.
       6.32.2.5. Review local procedures for birdbath operating guidelines. Each birdbath is
       unique in design and function and local procedures such as direction of entry, wing tip
       clearance criteria, and noise abatement concerns need to be reviewed prior to use.
       CAUTION: It is possible to experience overheat indications during or immediately
       following the birdbath due to water intrusion in overheat warning systems.
6.33. Support Agencies. The PIC or a designated representative will pass significant
information to support agencies, such as weather, ATC, or base operations. The actual weather
encountered should be compared to forecast weather, and this information provided to weather
personnel to facilitate improved support. Debrief intelligence, when applicable.
6.34. Crew Debriefing. The PIC will conduct a debriefing after each mission. The debriefing
will include all applicable crew members so that common problems can be discussed and
resolved. Crew members may be excused from the debrief at the discretion of the PIC.
6.35. Aircrew Notification Procedures. When transiting installations, the PIC will establish a
point of contact with the CCC, base operations, or local airport manager. The PIC will be
notified immediately in case of incident or emergency affecting the safety or security of the
aircraft.
6.36. Cockpit Congestion and Loose Objects. Limit the number of persons on the flight deck
to the minimum commensurate with mission requirements. At no time will this exceed nine
(eight for C130E/H).
   6.36.1. Store only items required for use or immediate reference in-flight on the flight deck.
   Additional items, to include personal pubs bags, will be secured in the cargo compartment.
   All items will be secured prior to passing the combat entry point until passing the combat exit
   point.
   6.36.2. Do not place any item (checklist, chart, etc.) on the center pedestal in a position that
   covers or hides from view any switch, light, or gauge. Do not place any item behind the
   condition levers or on the throttle quadrant (EXCEPTION: TOLD and airdrop data cards).
   Do not hang any item on the flight deck escape ladder higher than the second rung from the
   bottom.
6.37. Dropped Objects. During aircraft exterior visual inspections, pay particular attention to
surfaces, panels, and components, which could potentially be dropped objects. If a dropped
object is discovered and the mission is continued, the flight crew will:
   6.37.1. Ensure a write-up is entered in the AFTO Form 781A.
   6.37.2. Notify the appropriate MAJCOM C2 agency as soon as practical. Include route of
   flight, altitude, and weather conditions (i.e., turbulence, etc.).
6.38. Impoundment. If an aircraft is involved in a serious in-flight incident, the PIC should
impound the aircraft immediately after landing and contact the AFSOC Command Center or
controlling agency for further instructions.

6.39. Cockpit Voice Recorder. If involved in a mishap or incident, after landing and
terminating the emergency, pull the CVR power circuit breaker.
6.40. Narcotics. Crew members will ensure narcotics and other unauthorized items are not
smuggled on board the aircraft. Maintain narcotics that are part of official medical kits in
accordance with appropriate directives.
6.41. Due Regard Procedures. When a unit commander authorizes a mission to be flown in
international airspace over the high seas, and in-flight operational requirements conflict with
ICAO rules and procedures, the PIC may make the decision to proceed using "Due Regard"
procedures IAW AFI 11202V3 and FLIP General Planning.
6.42. Sensitive Mission Operations. Certain missions require special flight planning
procedures or deceptive measures. Use of these procedures will be directed by mission operating
directives, MAJCOM/CC operations orders, or other tasking orders. Modification to normal
procedures will be fully briefed to aircrews prior to execution of the operation. All missions of
this type requiring coordination with non-AFSOC agencies must be approved by MAJCOM/CC
or the COMAFSOF/COMAFFOR prior to execution. The planning agency tasked with the
mission will provide the aircrew with the following information:
   6.42.1. Departure procedures.
   6.42.2. En route procedures to include tracks, altitude reservations (ALTRV), military
   assumes responsibility for separation of aircraft (MARSA), tanker rendezvous, and
   emergency divert procedures.
   6.42.3. Arrival procedures.

           Passengers will be seated and secured during threat maneuvers. The PIC will ensure
           supported forces are briefed on the mission profile and events before flight.
       6.43.7.2. Mission Essential Personnel. A sub-category of space-required passenger
       defined by AFI 11401, MAJCOM Sup 1 and this instruction. Off-station travel is
       documented by travel orders. A letter of authorization from the group commander or
       COMAFSOF will document local flights. Deployed squadron or mission commanders
       may approve squadron-assigned personnel, or maintenance personnel required for
       mission accomplishment. 18 FLTS/CC is the approval authority for supporting forces in
       conjunction with test missions. When frequent local flights are necessary, commanders
       may issue annual authorizations by name or AFSC, as appropriate. When using this
       option, the PIC will ensure that all restrictions in the following paragraph are complied
       with for each individual mission.
           6.43.7.2.1. Both pilots must be fully qualified (unless specified otherwise by AFI
           11401). Simulated EPs are prohibited (Exception: EPs required for the purposes of
           an FCF are authorized. Limit personnel to absolute minimum required). There are no
           restrictions on mission events. Passengers will be seated and secured during threat
           maneuvers. The PIC will ensure supporting forces are briefed on the mission profile
           and events before flight.
6.44. Cargo Documentation. Proper cargo documentation will accompany each load.
6.45. Airlifting Hazardous Cargo Material Procedures. The term "hazardous material‖
includes substances or materials that are capable of posing an unreasonable risk to health, safety,
and property when transported and has been so designated by this manual. May also be referred
to as hazardous cargo or dangerous goods. NOTE: For identification, listing, and rules
pertaining to hazardous waste, refer to Title 40 CFR, Parts 260-265, Protection of Environment,
established by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Hazardous materials are
assigned hazard classes. The category of hazard assigned to a hazardous material based on
defining criteria. Hazard classes are: explosives (Class 1), compressed gases (Class 2),
flammable liquids (Class 3), flammable solids (Class 4), oxidizers and organic peroxides (Class
5), poisons and infectious substances (etiologic agents) (Class 6), radioactive materials (Class 7),
corrosive materials (Class 8), and miscellaneous dangerous goods (Class 9).
   6.45.1. Cargo Documentation.        Do not accept hazardous materials unless proper
   documentation, certification, and identification of cargo are provided. This includes
   transportation control number entered correctly on both the cargo manifest and the Shipper‘s
   Declaration for Dangerous Goods.
       6.45.1.1. Shipper‘s Declaration for Dangerous Goods prepared by the shipper in
       accordance with AFMAN 24204(I), Preparing Hazardous Materials for Military Air
       Shipments, and AF Form 127, Traffic Transfer Receipt (if required), will accompany the
       manifest.
   6.45.2. Aircrew Responsibilities
       6.45.2.1. Briefings. At a minimum, the PIC or designated crew member must be briefed
       at the base of departure concerning onboard hazardous materials, including the
       information listed below. If any is omitted, request it before accepting cargo. Check the
       air cargo manifest (and attached Shipper's Declarations) before signing.

        6.45.2.2.1. Aircrews are required to check the FCG for DIP Clearance requirements
        prior to departure on international flights transporting Hazardous Materials. If DIP
        Clearance is required the crew will verify that clearance has been granted prior to
        departure. NOTE: Generally, DIP clearances are required for ―Hazardous Cargo‖
        and require flight plan annotation IAW the following paragraphs.
     6.45.2.3. Flight Plans. Flight plans will be annotated "Hazardous Cargo" when any

          6.45.2.4.4. If ETA is less than 1 hour, or other circumstances preclude message
          receipt at destination, provide hazardous information by priority telephone.
          6.45.2.4.5. At least 30 minutes prior to ETA, check with destination to verify that
          hazardous material notification information, if required, was received.
          6.45.2.4.6. If not, unless prohibited by the theater commander or FLIP planning,
          contact controlling agency at destination and, at a minimum, provide:
              6.45.2.4.6.1. PSN.
              6.45.2.4.6.2. Hazard class.

      6.45.2.5. Aircraft Parking.
          6.45.2.5.1. Parking of aircraft carrying hazardous materials is the responsibility of
          the host airfield.
          6.45.2.5.2. The following is provided for information only:
              6.45.2.5.2.1. Aircraft transporting Division 1.1 and 1.2 explosives, nuclear
              weapons, and Hazardous Materials requiring a SAAM, i.e., Toxic Chemical
              Ammunition, are normally parked at remote (hot cargo) spots.
              6.45.2.5.2.2. Division 1.3 and 1.4 explosives may or may not require hot cargo
              parking depending on quantity of explosives.
              6.45.2.5.2.3. Transient aircraft with explosives, when cargo is not handled, may
              be parked at isolated locations other than hot cargo spots.
              6.45.2.5.2.4. Other hazardous materials normally do not require remote or
              isolated parking.
              6.45.2.5.2.5. Military installations are responsible for proper placarding of
              aircraft.
6.46. Hazardous Medical Equipment.
   6.46.1. Nonstandard equipment possessed by medical facilities that use AFSOC air
   evacuation services should be regarded as potentially hazardous. Two types of equipment
   are of major concern:
      6.46.1.1. Electronic medical equipment produces electromagnetic interference (EMI)
      which is commonly beyond the limits specified by MIL STD 461A and 462, and
      therefore can interfere with aircraft communication and navigational equipment.
      6.46.1.2. Therapeutic oxygen systems present an increased hazard of fire or explosion.
      A potential hazard is the inadvertent disruption of the cylinder neck, manifold, or
      regulator resulting in explosion and propulsion of the container or accessories.
   6.46.2. For nonstandard electronic medical equipment, take the following precautions:
AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011                                                              61


     6.46.2.1. Medical personnel must inform the PIC when nonstandard electronic medical
     equipment is brought on board the aircraft.
     6.46.2.2. The PIC must be informed of the anticipated period of use of the equipment
     during the mission.
     6.46.2.3. The PIC must be alert for any interference with aircraft communications or
     navigation equipment during periods of use of this equipment.
     6.46.2.4. When continuous use of the equipment is required throughout the duration of
     the mission, flight must be restricted to VFR conditions. Furthermore, exercise
     additional caution on night VFR missions to ensure there are no adverse effects on
     navigational equipment.
  6.46.3. For nonstandard oxygen equipment, take the following precautions:
     6.46.3.1. All compressed oxygen equipment with exposed, unprotected cylinder neck,
     manifold, or regulator must be completely secured from all movement in its longitudinal
     and lateral axes.
     6.46.3.2. Medical personnel must continually monitor the operation of the equipment to
     detect possible malfunction during exposure to altitude.
  6.46.4. Mission capable parts (MICAP), very, very important parts (VVIP), sensitive cargo,
  courier materials, and registered mail moving within the normal airlift system are receipted at
  the onload and off-load stations using the air cargo manifest. For unit moves operated in
  accordance with Defense Transportation Regulation (DTR), Part III, Mobility, classified or
  sensitive cargo movement is normally manifested utilizing the DD Form 2130-2,
  C130A/B/E/H Cargo Manifest or similar automated product (such as CALM or AALPS), and
  will normally be accompanied by a unit courier. However, if classified/sensitive unit cargo is
  offered without an accompanying courier, the DD Form 1907, Signature Tally Record, must
  be used.
     6.46.4.1. Defense Courier Service (DCS). Couriers coordinating with the PIC are
     authorized to designate officer or enlisted (E-5 and above) crew members on military
     aircraft as couriers to escort and safeguard courier material when other qualified
     personnel are not available. Qualified passengers, if carried, are designated before
     designating crew members. The following restrictions apply:
         6.46.4.1.1. Primary crew members will not be designated couriers without the PIC‘s
         consent.
         6.46.4.1.2. Crew members on aircraft scheduled to make an extended en route stop at
         a location where DCS couriers cannot provide en route support will not be designated
         as couriers.
     6.46.4.2. During stops at en route locations supported by DCS stations, DCS couriers are
     required to meet designated couriers, guard and protect the material.
         6.46.4.2.1. During unscheduled en route stops crew members may place courier
         material in temporary custody of the following agencies in descending order of
         priority.
             6.46.4.2.1.1. DCS courier.
 62                                                AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011


             6.46.4.2.1.2. TOP SECRET control officer of the U.S. armed forces.
             6.46.4.2.1.3. U.S. Department of State Diplomatic Courier.
             6.46.4.2.1.4. U.S. Department of State activity.
             6.46.4.2.1.5. U.S. military guards.
             6.46.4.2.1.6. U.S. DoD civilian guards.
      6.46.4.3. If unable to follow the itinerary to the destination of the courier material, or
      material is lost, stolen, or otherwise compromised, report circumstances to the nearest
      Defense Courier Station and notify the local U.S. military commander or U.S.
      Government activity.
      6.46.4.4. Life or death urgency shipments consist of biological or other medical supplies
      of such urgency that human life is dependent upon immediate receipt. Shipments will be
      manifested separately and the manifest annotated with the words ―LIFE OR DEATH
      URGENCY.‖ All shipments will be handled on a hand-to-hand receipt basis, using either
      the air cargo manifest or the DD Form 1907 for unit moves. The PIC will be briefed on
      the urgency of the shipment and be made the custodian during flight.
6.47. Border Clearance.
   6.47.1. Normal Operations:
      6.47.1.1. Border Clearance Requirements. The requirements will be IAW the applicable
      Foreign Clearance Guide and AFI 24203, Preparation and Movement of Air Force
      Cargo.
      6.47.1.2. Pilot In Command Responsibility. Border clearance is the responsibility of the
      PIC, although many of the duties have been assigned to ground personnel and to the
      loadmaster. The PIC will ensure:
      6.47.1.3. Crew members and passengers possess current passports and valid visas, if
      required.
      6.47.1.4. Crew members and passengers have current shot records or certificates of
      immunization.
      6.47.1.5. Cargo entry documents are in proper order.
      6.47.1.6. Departure or arrival to the U.S. is through a port of entry where border
      clearance can be obtained.
      6.47.1.7. Border clearance for aircraft cargo, passengers, crew and baggage, if required,
      is obtained before takeoff to a foreign area, or after arrival from a foreign area.
      6.47.1.8. Aircraft spraying is accomplished, if required (see paragraph 6.52).
      6.47.1.9. En route to the U.S., the loadmaster has distributed personal customs
      declarations to all passengers and crew members, has briefed passengers and crew
      members on customs regulations, and has prepared and compiled necessary border
      clearance forms for PIC signature.
      6.47.1.10. En route to the U.S., the base of intended landing is notified of any change in
      ETA to ensure border clearance is accomplished as soon as possible after landing.
AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011                                                            63


      6.47.1.11. A Permit to Proceed, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Form 1400,
      Record of Vessels Engaged in Foreign Trade Entered or Arrived Under Permit to
      Proceed/Form 1401, Record of Vessels Engaged in Foreign Trade Cleared and Granted
      Permit to Proceed, is obtained when the mission requires an aircraft, which has landed in
      the U.S. for customs clearance, to proceed to another U.S. base to obtain border
      clearance. The permit delays customs inspection of cargo, passengers, and crew until
      arrival at the off-load station, saving intermediate off-loading and reloading normally
      required for customs inspection. The Permit to Proceed is valid only to the airport of
      next landing, where the border clearance must be completed, or a new permit obtained.
      Do not make intermediate stops unless required by an emergency situation or directed by
      C2 authority.
      6.47.1.12. When an aircraft lands for a U.S. border clearance, a U.S. customs
      representative normally meets the aircraft to obtain the required documents. Do not
      deplane passengers or crew members, except a scanner, unless necessary for safety. Do
      not unload until approved by customs and agriculture personnel or their designated
      representatives. This procedure applies to the initial landing in the U.S. and all
      subsequent landings until crew, passengers, and cargo complete final border clearance.
   6.47.2. Exercise and Contingency Operations.
      6.47.2.1. General. Certain missions, which do not transit normal ports of entry or exit,
      require special procedures to expedite compliance with customs, public health,
      immigration, and agricultural requirements. A joint memorandum of understanding
      (MOU) establishes procedures and waivers.
      6.47.2.2. Implementation. Traffic and border clearing agencies implement all or part of
      the agreement as necessary for each operation. Inspection and clearance may be
      accomplished at the CONUS onload or off-load base instead of the normal port of entry,
      or at the foreign onload or off-load base.
6.48. Customs Procedures.
   6.48.1. Outbound. No requirements. Filing of a CBP 7507, General Declaration
   (Outward/Inward) Agriculture, Customs, Immigration and Public Health, is waived.
   6.48.2. Inbound. Prepare one copy of the following documents before arrival.
      6.48.2.1. CBP 7507 (passenger list not required).
      6.48.2.2. Cargo manifest.
      6.48.2.3. For troops out of country less than 140 days.
          6.48.2.3.1. Troop commander‘s certificate from examination of troop baggage.
          6.48.2.3.2. One copy of CBP 6059B, Customs Declaration, for each passenger not
          under command of the troop commander, to include observers, support personnel,
          civilians, news reporters, and crew members.
          6.48.2.3.3. Upon arrival at a CONUS offload base, a Customs representative meets
          the aircraft and accepts the troop commander's certificate with respect to troop
          baggage. Individual baggage declarations are not required. The troop commander
          should have inspected troop baggage. Troops debark under the observation of the
 64                                                   AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011


          Customs representative with only a spot check of articles and baggage. The Customs
          officer may elect to make a more extensive inspection.
      6.48.2.4. For troops out of the country 140 days or more.
          6.48.2.4.1. One copy of CBP 6059B for each passenger. This includes observers,
          support personnel, civilians, news media personnel, and crew members.
          6.48.2.4.2. Upon arrival at a CONUS off-load base, a Customs representative meets
          the aircraft and collects all declarations. Troops debark under the observation of the
          Customs representative, who may make discretionary examination of the baggage.
6.49. Immigration Procedures.
   6.49.1. Outbound. No requirements.
   6.49.2. Inbound. Submit one copy of CBP 7507 to the Immigration inspector.
6.50. Customs, Immigration and Agricultural Inspections.
   6.50.1. Obtain Customs, Immigration, Agriculture, and Public Health clearance, as required,
   prior to opening any doors, hatches, or windows, other than the crew entrance door, or
   enplaning and deplaning personnel.
   6.50.2. Proceed directly from the aircraft to Customs, Immigration, or Agricultural
   inspection for processing when required by the inspector.
   6.50.3. U.S. military aircraft are sovereign territory. When cleared to overfly or land in
   foreign territory, it is U.S. policy to assert that military aircraft are entitled to the privileges
   and immunities which customarily are accorded to warships. These privileges and
   immunities include, in the absence of stipulations to the contrary, exemption from duties and
   taxation, immunity from search, seizure, and inspections (including customs and safety
   inspections); or other exercise of jurisdiction by the host nation over the aircraft, personnel,
   equipment, or cargo on board. The PIC will not authorize search, seizure, inspection or
   similar exercises of jurisdiction enumerated above by foreign authorities except by direction
   of USAF or the American Embassy in the country concerned.
      6.50.3.1. The PIC will not permit the inspection of their aircraft by officials of any
      foreign government. If requested to submit to these actions, the PIC and crew will deny
      access to the aircraft and seek aid from the senior AFSOC (or other USAF) representative
      in the U.S. Embassy or Consulate within the host nation. Customs or other officials will
      be informed of the above policy and requested to confirm their request through their own
      government and with U.S. Department of State representatives. If necessary, the crew
      will seal the aircraft, the crew entered into crew rest, and departure intentions will be
      canceled until resolution of the matter by the appropriate authority. Inform C2 authorities
      by the fastest available means should this situation occur.
      6.50.3.2. When confronted with a search request by foreign authorities, aircrews should
      consider the following procedures:
          6.50.3.2.1. In most cases, search attempts may be stopped by a statement to the
          foreign officials that the aircraft is sovereign and not subject to search without
          consent of USAF or the chief of mission in the country concerned. This should be
AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011                                                                65


          clearly conveyed in a polite manner so as not to offend foreign authorities that may
          honestly, but mistakenly, believe they have authority to search USAF aircraft.
          6.50.3.2.2. If foreign authorities insist on conducting a search, the PIC must negotiate
          to delay the search until contact is made with USAF/XOXXI or the appropriate
          embassy. The PIC should unequivocally state that they have no authority to consent
          to the search and that they must relay the host nation request to these agencies for
          decision. The PIC should then notify these agencies of the request by the most
          expeditious means available. Thereafter, the PIC should follow instructions provided
          by the appropriate embassy and USAF.
          6.50.3.2.3. If foreign officials refuse to desist in their search request, the PIC should
          indicate that they would prefer to fly the aircraft elsewhere (provided fuel and
          mechanical considerations permit a safe departure) and request permission to do so.
          6.50.3.2.4. If permission is refused and the foreign authorities insist on forcing their
          way on board an aircraft, the PIC should state that they protest the course of action
          being pursued and that they intend to notify both the appropriate American Embassy
          and USAF of the foreign action. The PIC should then allow the foreign agents on
          board the aircraft, without physical resistance, and thereafter report the incident to
          USAF and appropriate embassy, as soon as possible.
       6.50.3.3. In all instances, specific instructions may be briefed because of sensitive cargo
       or equipment. These instructions and applicable provisions of classified supplements to
       the FCG should be followed, where applicable.
6.51. Military Customs Preclearance Inspection Program:
   6.51.1. The military customs program outlined in DTR 4500-9-R Part 5 was developed to
   assist the DoD and other U.S. Government agencies in the control of narcotics, contraband,
   and prohibited agricultural products, and to expedite entry of DoD personnel and material
   into the customs territory of the United States.
   6.51.2. Military Customs Inspectors will accomplish this inspection immediately prior to
   departure and may conduct more than one preclearance inspection on CONUS-bound
   aircraft. When security considerations necessitate deviation from this policy, mission
   planners must coordinate with the appropriate agency to ensure the mission is not
   jeopardized.
6.52. Insect and Pest Control (Aircraft Spraying).
   6.52.1. The PIC will ensure required spraying is accomplished (if applicable), and certify the
   spraying on required forms.
   6.52.2. Aerosol normally is dispersed at a flow rate of 10 seconds per 1,000 cubic ft. Direct
   the nozzle toward the ceiling of the compartment or space being sprayed. Do not spray any
   plastic surface or allow the spray to wet it.
   6.52.3. Spray spaces inaccessible from within the aircraft after completely loading fuel,
   baggage, cargo, and passengers, including baggage compartments, wheel wells, and other
   similar spaces.
66                                                 AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011


  6.52.4. Spray the cabin, cockpit, and other spaces accessible from within the aircraft after the
  crew is on board and after closing all doors, windows, hatches, and ventilation openings.
  CAUTION: If the insecticide label directs disembarkation after use, spray prior to boarding
  crew or passengers. Close all doors and hatches for 10 minutes after dispensing and ventilate
  for 15 minutes before allowing anyone on board.
  6.52.5. Spray for 50 seconds unless longer periods are specified for the country being
  transited.
  6.52.6. When seeing any insect or rodent infestation of the aircraft in-flight, notify the
  destination CCC, base operations, or airport manager of the situation before landing so the
  proper authorities can meet the aircraft.
  6.52.7. Upon arrival, do not open cargo doors or hatches except to enplane officials
  inspecting the aircraft for insect or rodent infestation. Do not onload or off-load until the
  inspection is satisfactorily completed. This procedure may be altered to satisfy mission or
  local requirements, as arranged by the base air terminal manager.

                                           Chapter 7

                                   AIRCRAFT SECURITY

7.1. General. This chapter provides guidance for aircraft security during ground operations and
in-flight. AFSOC MC/C130 aircraft are Protection Level "C" resources. This security priority
designation applies to operational aircraft, wherever they are located, worldwide. Some aircraft
contain equipment and documents that require protection per DoD 5200.1R, Information
Security Program and AFI 31401, Information Security Program Management.
7.2. Procedures. The PIC is ultimately responsible for the security of their aircraft when
located away from U.S. military installations. AFJI 31102, Physical Security, covers security
arrangements when USAF aircraft are located on other DoD installations. Arrangements must
be made to protect the aircraft during crew rest status at non-U.S. protected locations. If U.S.
military security forces are not available, the U.S. embassy assigned to that country must be
consulted to ensure security arrangements are made. For missions involving a planning agency,
the agency must coordinate with the PIC to ensure the planned security measures conform to
mission requirements. The amount of security required will vary, depending on location and
ground time.
   7.2.1. For nonpermissive or uncertain environments, airfield and LZ security is the
   responsibility of the agency requesting the airlift. Aircrews will work with the agency
   requesting the airlift to ensure security meets the requirement for the mission.
   7.2.2. For permissive environments, PIC will receive a threat assessment and force
   protection capability evaluation briefing at home station prior to departure and receive
   updates en route, if required. When landing at DoD component installation, the installation
   commander is responsible to provide adequate security for the aircraft. The PIC will
   determine if security is adequate. Planning agencies and PIC will use Table 7.1 to help
   assess the risk to parked aircraft for planned overnight stops located at non-U.S. military
   installation overseas and civilian airfields. NOTE: Aircrews do possess the training to
   provide the appropriate security when present at the aircraft. For unscheduled or emergency
   landings at non-USAF installations, PIC will assess the aircraft security situation and take the
   following actions, if force protection capability appears insufficient:
       7.2.2.1. Aircrew surveillance. If the aircraft is not remaining overnight, aircrews are
       capable of maintaining appropriate aircraft security. The PIC will direct armed crew
       members to remain with the aircraft and maintain surveillance of aircraft entrances and
       activities in the aircraft vicinity.
       7.2.2.2. Area Patrol. Request area patrol coverage from local security forces to include
       backup response forces. If local authorities request payment for this service, use AF
       Form 15, USAF Invoice.
       7.2.2.3. Departure without Crew Rest. If local security forces are unacceptable or
       unavailable, the PIC may waive flight duty period (FDP) restrictions and depart as soon
       as possible for a destination with adequate force protection. If unable to depart the
       location due to system malfunction, the aircrew must secure the aircraft to the best of
       their ability. In no case, will the entire crew leave the aircraft unattended. Crew rest
       requirements will be subordinate to aircraft security when the airframe may be at risk.
68                                                  AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011


     The PIC should rotate a security detail among the crew to provide for both aircraft
     protection and crew rest until relief is available. PIC will coordinate through home
     station channels to acquire additional security.
  7.2.3. Tailored Security Measures. Standard physical security measures may be impractical
  at times due to mission, terrain, climate, sociopolitical sensitivities, or other factors. For
  example, some countries don't allow armed security personnel. On other deployments, the
  mission may rely on maintaining a low profile and attracting as little attention as possible.
  At such locations, tailor security measures to meet unique requirements when necessary. At
  a minimum, lock aircraft entry points and hatches. If it is not possible to lock aircraft, secure
  aircraft entry points and hatches in a manner to indicate unauthorized entry, i.e., taping hatch
  release handles or using seals. The PIC is the final authority for determining tailored security
  measures. Contact with U.S. Embassy personnel is required at locations where security
  agreements are not in existence.
  7.2.4. Ground security teams. Ground security teams may be considered to guard the
  aircraft for planned overnight stops. Teams may travel in MEP status and are responsible to
  the PIC at all times. The PIC will ensure security team members receive a mission briefing,
  aircraft egress, and passenger briefings, as appropriate. The squadron commander is the final
  approval authority for the need of ground security teams for their aircraft and authority may
  be delegated no lower than the PIC.
     7.2.4.1. Ground security teams will comply with AFMAN 24204 (Interservice), at all
     times when carrying weapons, ammo, and equipment on board the aircraft.
     7.2.4.2. Due to the sensitivity of weapons in foreign countries, ground security teams
     will keep their weapons inside the aircraft and out of sight of foreign nationals, even if
     the FCG allows them to be carried outside the aircraft. If a destination requires weapons
     be carried outside the aircraft, the controlling MAJCOM must approve such action prior
     to deployment.
  7.2.5. Unauthorized entry. If, in the PIC‘s judgment, the aircraft needs to be locked and
  sealed as a measure to detect unauthorized entry:
     7.2.5.1. Use the aircraft lock. NOTE: The aircraft should be locked during all off-
     station missions remaining overnight.
     7.2.5.2. If the aircraft lock is unavailable comply with paragraph 7.2.3 Close and seal
     the main crew entrance door using a metal boxcar seal or other controllable device to
     identify forced entry. Wipe the immediate area around the seal clean to help investigate
     forced entry. If the seals are damaged or have been tampered with, notify the appropriate
     local authorities, the controlling agency, and inspect the aircraft thoroughly.
     7.2.5.3. Coordinate with the local base operations representative on procedures for
     servicing the aircraft while the crew is away. If a padlock is used, the key or combination
     will be left with base operations or the representative for servicing and maintenance
     personnel.
     7.2.5.4. (MC130W) At a temporary duty (TDY) location with munitions on board, a
     crew member will be at the aircraft at all times or the aircraft will be locked. If the
AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011                                                                    69


       aircraft is left unattended, the PIC will ensure the appropriate protection is provided by
       flight line security forces.
   7.2.6. Security awareness is crucial to effective mission accomplishment. Aircrews must
   always remain vigilant to their surroundings, especially at high threat, low security locations.
   During preflight activities, aircrews will inspect accessible areas, to include aircraft wheel-
   wells, air conditioning compartments, and cargo compartment for unauthorized packages,
   personnel, or other unfamiliar devices. Report any suspicious items to host security forces.
   Aircrews will maintain a heightened security posture throughout all pre-takeoff activities.
7.3. Aircraft Security Risk Assessment Matrix. Planning agencies and the PIC will use this
matrix to help assess the risk to parked aircraft in a permissive environment. This matrix will be
used for planned overnight stops at non-U.S. military installations overseas and civilian airfields.
A cumulative score of less than 55 implies that normal unmanned aircraft security measures are
adequate. A score of 55 to 90 implies moderate security risk. Commander may consider
additional security measures. If the cumulative score is greater than 90, commanders should
consider deploying or contracting security personnel. The squadron commander or mission
commander is the final approval authority for aircraft security issues. Authority may be
delegated no lower than the PIC. EXCEPTION: during unscheduled or emergency landings the
PIC is the final approval authority for aircraft security. The PIC should contact the U.S.
Embassy or U.S. defense attaché officer (DAO) for security assistance. NOTE: Normally,
additional security for the aircraft is not required at military installation within a North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO) country or U.S. civilian airfields approved by the Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA)/TAS.

 Notes:
 1. Derive the local threat from valid intelligence sources only.
 2. ―Adequate lighting‖ is equal to the illumination provided by one standard USAF light cart.
 3. If a security response team and security patrol is not present, commanders should consider
 deploying or contracting security personnel.
7.4. Protective Standards for Aircraft Carrying Distinguished Visitors. This paragraph
applies specifically to aircraft transporting DV Code 4 or above. PICs are responsible for aircraft
security at en route stops.
   7.4.1. DoD Installations. Notify the base security forces of estimated arrival and departure
   times. Request continuous security surveillance during the entire ground time. If the
   installation is unable to comply, arrange for the best protection available.
   7.4.2. Non-DoD Installations. Contact the airport manager or installation commander to
   arrange for force protection. If available security is inadequate, purchase additional security
   using AF Form 15.
7.5. Arming of Crew members. When directed, at least one crew member each from the flight
deck and cargo compartment will carry weapons.
   7.5.1. Weapons Issue. Before departing home station, authorized crew members will obtain
   weapons, ammunition, lock, and key. Crew members must present a current AF Form 523,
   USAF Authorization to Bear Firearms, to be issued a weapon. Crew members will be
   reissued the same weapon until the mission terminates at home station. If an armed crew
   member must leave the crew en route, transfer the weapon to another authorized crew
   member, using AF Form 1297, Temporary Issue Receipt.
AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011                                                                 71


   7.5.2. Loading and Transfer of Weapons. Load and unload weapons at approved clearing
   barrels/facilities if available. To transfer a loaded weapon to another crew member, place the
   weapon on a flat surface. Do not use a hand-to-hand transfer.
   7.5.3. Wearing of Weapons. Wear weapons in a holster, concealed at all times to protect the
   identity of armed crew members. Do not wear weapons off the flight line, except to and
   from the CCC, armories, and other facilities associated with aircrew activities such as base
   operations, fleet service, cargo or passenger terminals, flight line cafeterias, snack bars, etc.
   7.5.4. Weapons Storage. Crew members will be armed before beginning pre-flight or onload
   duties. When no passengers are on board and after a satisfactory stowaway check, weapons
   may be stored in the gun box in-flight. If no gun box is available retain weapon for the
   duration of the flight. Crew members will rearm before landing. Weapons need not be
   unloaded before being placed in the gun box.
   7.5.5. Crew Rest. During crew rest, store weapons in the most secure facility available,
   normally the base armory. If a weapons storage facility is unavailable or the country
   prohibits or restricts the entry of weapons, secure firearms and ammunition in the gun box.
       7.5.5.1. Aircraft without a Gun Box. If an aircraft without a gun box must remain
       overnight at a location where a government-owned storage facility is unavailable, use the
       nearest acceptable facility. Acceptable storage facilities are U.S. or Allied military
       services armories, U.S. National Guard and Reserve armories, and U.S. civil law
       enforcement armories. If none of these are available, or the PIC believes weapons
       security may be compromised, crew members may secure their weapons in their quarters,
       one crew member will remain with the weapons at all times. In this case, turn the
       ammunition over to the PIC.
7.6. Antihijacking Guidance. Aircrews must make every reasonable effort to resist an aircraft
hijacking attempt, resistance may vary from dissuasion, to direct physical confrontation,
including the use of deadly force. Due to the sensitive nature of antihijacking procedures, crew
members should reference AFI 13207, Preventing and Resisting Aircraft Piracy (Hijacking)
(FOUO) and the FIH for specific guidance. Aircrews will not release any information
concerning those procedures or hijacking attempts. Antihijacking is a crew duty performed
exclusively by aircrew personnel. The hijacking of an AFSOC aircraft could create a serious
international incident and jeopardize the safety of passengers and property. An aircraft is most
vulnerable when the crew is on board and the aircraft is ready for flight. Hijackers cannot be
dealt with as ordinary criminals. Some are mentally disturbed, emotionally unstable individuals
for whom the threat of death is not a deterrent, but a stimulus to crime. Delay tactics have been
most successful in saving lives and property. Detection of potential hijackers before they board
the aircraft is the best solution to the problem.
   7.6.1. Acceptance of Passengers. The host station passenger processing and manifesting
   facility should conduct antihijacking inspections. Do not board passengers unless the PIC is
   fully satisfied with these inspections. EXCEPTION: Supporting/supported forces may be
   antihijack inspected at the aircraft by the aircrew.
       7.6.1.1. Aeromedical Procedures. Military medical facility commanders are responsible
       for the antihijacking inspection of patients. When patients are delivered to the aircraft by
       civilian sources, the aircrew will perform required inspections before departure.
72                                               AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011


     7.6.1.2. Contingency and exercise movements. During contingencies in support of
     combat operations and exercises involving the movement of large numbers of personnel,
     the supported unit should manifest passengers and perform antihijacking inspections.
  7.6.2. Arms and Ammunition. Passengers (including MEP) will not carry weapons and/or
  ammunition on their person or in hand-carried baggage on board an aircraft. EXCEPTION:
  special agents/guards of the Secret Service or State Department and other individuals
  specifically authorized to carry weapons with coordination of the PIC. In all cases the crew
  will be aware of location of weapons and ammunition.
     7.6.2.1. If individuals must clear their weapons before boarding the aircraft, and access
     to clearing barrel/facilities is limited, at a minimum, direct them to:
         7.6.2.1.1. Move to a safe, clear area at least 50 ft from any aircraft, equipment, or
         personnel before unholstering/unslinging their weapons.
         7.6.2.1.2. Clear their weapons in accordance with standard safety procedures.
     7.6.2.2. Troops and deadhead crew members will not retain custody of ammunition on an
     aircraft but will turn it in to the troop commander or PIC. EXCEPTION: During combat
     operations, troops may carry unloaded weapons and ammunition on board the aircraft.
     When the tactical situation dictates, personnel who will engage an enemy force
     immediately upon deplaning at the objective may carry loaded weapons aboard the
     aircraft at the discretion of the troop commander/team leader, with the PIC‘s concurrence.
     Weapons will not be breached until clear of the aircraft.

                                             Chapter 8

                          OPERATIONAL REPORTS AND FORMS

8.1. General. This chapter contains a description of applicable reports and forms. For
assistance in completing safety forms contact the wing/group, unit, or local flight safety officer.
8.2. AF Form 457, USAF Hazard Report. Refer to AFI 91202, The USAF Mishap Prevention
Program. The USAF hazard reporting system provides a means for Air Force personnel to alert
supervisors and commanders to hazardous conditions requiring prompt corrective action. A
hazard is any condition, act, or circumstance that jeopardizes or may jeopardize the health and
well being of personnel, or which may result in loss, damage, or destruction of any weapons
system, equipment, facility, or material resource.
8.3. AF Form 651, Hazardous Air Traffic Report. Refer to AFI 91202.
   8.3.1. The Air Force hazardous air traffic report (HATR) program provides a means for
   personnel to report all near midair collisions and alleged hazardous air traffic conditions.
   Use information in HATR reports only for mishap prevention.
   8.3.2. Procedures:
       8.3.2.1. Make an airborne report of the hazardous condition to the nearest ATC agency
       (e.g., center, flight service station (FSS), control tower, or aeronautical radio station), and
       give the following information as appropriate:
           8.3.2.1.1. Identification or call sign.
           8.3.2.1.2. Time and place (radial/distance measuring equipment (DME), position
           relative to the airfield, etc.).
           8.3.2.1.3. Altitude or flight level.
           8.3.2.1.4. Description of the other aircraft or vehicle.
           8.3.2.1.5. Include a verbal statement as soon as possible after occurrence that a
           written HATR report will be filed upon landing. NOTE: ATC agencies (e.g., FAA,
           etc.) must know if an official report is being filed.
       8.3.2.2. File the HATR as soon as possible (within 24 hours) using any available means
       of communication. Normally, it should be filed at the base operations office at the
       landing airport. If this is impractical and if communications permit, notify the safety
       office of the Air Force base where the condition occurred, the safety office at the home
       station, or as prescribed by the overseas MAJCOM. In any case, provide the safety office
       with all available information needed to prepare AF Form 651. Turn in a completed copy
       of AF Form 651 to the wing/group safety office. NOTE: HATR reports are not
       privileged information and may be released outside the USAF.
   8.3.3. Individuals submitting a HATR are granted immunity from disciplinary action
   provided:
       8.3.3.1. Their violation was not deliberate.
       8.3.3.2. They committed no criminal offense.

8.4. AF Form 711B, USAF Aircraft Mishap Report Worksheet. Refer to AFI 91204.
   8.4.1. Responsibilities. Notify the appropriate authorities of any mishap involving aircraft or
   crew. When notified, AFSOC units will initiate investigative and reporting actions in
   accordance with AFI 91204. NOTE: Do not attempt to classify a mishap.
   8.4.2. Reportable Mishaps:
      8.4.2.1. Report damage to the aircraft, or injury to the crew or passengers, as well as any
      damage or injury to another organization‘s equipment or personnel resulting from the
      movements or actions of an aircraft or crew.
      8.4.2.2. Report the following occurrences:
          8.4.2.2.1. A physiological episode. A physiological reaction, near accident, or
          hazard in-flight due to medical or physiological reasons. NOTE: In the event of a
          physiological episode, all crew members and passengers involved will report to a
          flight surgeon as soon as practical. Reportable incidents include:
              8.4.2.2.1.1. Proven or suspected case of hypoxia.
              8.4.2.2.1.2. Carbon monoxide poisoning or other toxic exposure.
              8.4.2.2.1.3. Decompression sickness due to evolved gas (bends, chokes, neuro-

              8.4.2.2.1.8. Unintentional loss of pressurization if cabin altitude is above FL180,
              regardless of effects on personnel.
              8.4.2.2.1.9. Alcohol intoxication and hangover (crew only).
              8.4.2.2.1.10. Illness (both acute and pre-existing), including food poisoning,
              dehydration, myocardial infarction, seizure, and so forth.
              8.4.2.2.1.11. Exposure to toxic, noxious, or irritating materials such as smoke,
              fumes, or liquids.

                                           Chapter 9

                               FLYING TRAINING POLICY

9.1. General. This chapter outlines requirements and restrictions for training and evaluation
missions.     Refer to AFI 11202V1, Aircrew Training, AFI 11202V2, Aircrew
Standardization/Evaluation Program, AFI 112MC130V1 and AFI 112MC130V2 for additional
information.
9.2. Instructor/Flight Examiner Briefings. Before all training/evaluation missions, the PIC or
instructors/flight examiners will brief their crew on the training/evaluation requirements,
objectives, planned profiles, and seat changes.
9.3. Debriefing. Review and assess overall training performed. Each student or crew member
should thoroughly understand what training has been accomplished. All required documentation
should be completed as expeditiously as possible.
9.4. Simulated Emergency Procedures.
   9.4.1. Simulate EPs (engine shutdown, placing switches in other than their normal positions,
   or an abnormal configuration such as no flap landings or simulated engine failure) only
   during training, evaluation, or currency flights when an instructor or flight examiner pilot is
   in one of the pilot seats. Instructor pilot candidates who occupy a pilot seat and are under the
   supervision of a flight examiner pilot, not in a pilot seat, may practice simulated emergency
   procedures during initial or requalification upgrade evaluations. Preface all simulated
   emergencies with the word "simulated" and terminate simulated emergencies if an actual
   emergency arises.
   9.4.2. When conducting simulated engine(s)-out training, the flight engineer will post actual
   charted minimum control speeds on the TOLD card (refer to the flight and performance
   manuals). The instructor pilot will maintain positive torque, of no less than 1,000 in-lbs, on
   the simulated inoperative engine(s).
   9.4.3. Turns into the simulated inoperative engine(s) should be minimized. Such turns
   require a higher degree of pilot skill than with actual inoperative engines and must be smooth
   and coordinated. WARNING: Improper rudder or power application can lead to an
   immediate out-of-control condition where recovery may not be possible.
   9.4.4. Simulated EPs are prohibited with passengers on board unless such personnel are
   required for mission accomplishment, such as FCFs and test missions. Limit personnel to the
   absolute minimum required.
   9.4.5. Conduct simulated EPs in accordance with AFI 11202V3, Chapter 5, and this
   instruction. Use a realistic EP scenario and do not compound EPs. Limit simulated EPs to
   noncritical phases of flight when possible. Notify the controlling agency if a nonstandard
   traffic pattern or pattern requiring special sequencing is anticipated.
   9.4.6. (MC130W) During live-fire operations, limit simulated emergency procedures to
   strike-specific scenarios (i.e., sensor malfunctions, gun malfunctions, etc.) to preclude
   channelizing attention away from the live-fire.
AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011                                                                77

   brake cooling restrictions. Do not shutdown an engine due to a simulated malfunction. Do
   not practice aborted max effort takeoffs from stop and go landings.
   9.5.5. Actual Engine Shutdown and Air-start. One engine may be shut down at not lower
   than 2,500 ft AGL in daylight VMC.
   9.5.6. No-flap Landing. Authorized in conjunction with simulated engine(s) inoperative

   go-around at not lower than 200 ft AGL. Initiate simulated engine-out missed approach no
   lower than the minimum altitude for the approach.
   9.5.9. Simulated Engine-out Landing. For simulate failure of the first engine one throttle
   may be retarded to flight idle no less than 1,000 in-lbs and not less than air minimum control
   speed (one-engine inoperative, out of ground effect). Authorized in daylight IMC (circling
   minimums for the approach being flown), or night (1,000-ft ceilings and 2 statute miles (SM)
   visibility or circling minimums, whichever is higher) not less than 300 ft AGL. Use all four
   engines for touch and go takeoff.

   engine air minimum control speed.
   9.5.12. Unusual Attitudes and Spatial Disorientation. Authorized at not lower than 10,000 ft
   AGL in daylight VMC.
   9.5.13. Slow Flight. Fly at approach, threshold, and 1.2 times power off stall speed with
   gear down and flaps 0, 50, or 100%. Do not exceed 15 degrees of bank.
   9.5.14. Practice Emergency Climb Procedure. Authorized in day/night VMC. Pre-brief
   torque values prior to execution. Minimum airspeed should not be less than charted obstacle
   clearance speed (0/50% flap) plus 20 knots. An instructor/flight examiner pilot is not
   required for the accomplishment of this event.
9.6. Touch and Go Landings. Authorized on designated training, evaluation, or currency
missions.
   9.6.1. Touch and go landings may be performed by:
      9.6.1.1. Instructor pilots, instructor pilot candidates on initial or requalification instructor
      evaluations, or flight examiner pilots in either pilot seat.
      9.6.1.2. Any pilot from either seat provided an instructor pilot, instructor pilot candidate
      on initial or requalification instructor evaluation, or flight examiner pilot is in the other
      seat.
      9.6.1.3. If the PIC is touch and go certified and is touch and go designated on the flight
      orders, any current and qualified pilot may conduct flight idle touch and go landings.
      NVG touch and go landings may be performed by current and NVG landing qualified
      pilots.
   9.6.2. Touch and go landings are authorized when crosswind component corrected for RCR
   is within the recommended zone of the landing crosswind chart. Ceiling and runway
   visibility range (RVR) must be at least 300 ft and 3/4 mile (0400).
   9.6.3. Touch and go landings are normally performed at flight idle. Brief the crew if
   performing a ground idle touch and go landing. Do not perform no-flap ground idle touch
   and go landings.
   9.6.4. Touch and go landings are not authorized when normal wake turbulence criteria is not
   met or when intercepting or crossing the flight path of a large multi-engine jet during
   approach or landing.

AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011                                                                 79


   9.7.1. Authorized only on designated training, evaluation, or currency missions. Any C130
   qualified pilot may perform stop and go landings if:
       9.7.1.1. The crosswind component corrected for RCR is within the recommended zone
       of the landing crosswind chart. Ceiling and visibility (RVR) must be at least 300 ft and
       3/4-mile (0400).
       9.7.1.2. Minimum braking is used to stop.
       9.7.1.3. The runway remaining for takeoff is the greater of balanced/unbalanced CFL.
       NOTE: This does not preclude crews from being aware of takeoff decision tree
       requirements IAW MDS 1-1.
   9.7.2. Not authorized:
       9.7.2.1. In conjunction with no-flap landings.
       9.7.2.2. When normal wake turbulence criteria is not met, or when intercepting or
       crossing the flight path of a large multi-engine jet during approach or landing.
9.8. Prohibited Maneuvers. The following maneuvers or procedures are prohibited in the
aircraft and may only be practiced in the flight simulator.

will not be accomplished with non-unilateral airdrop loads onboard the aircraft [i.e., combat
rubber raiding craft (CRRC), bike bundles, rigged alternate method zodiac (RAMZ)] in order to
prevent damage to actual loads. If landings are accomplished with training loads (i.e., SATB, 55
gallon drum CDS loads, concrete blocks) on the aircraft, the loadmaster will re-inspect the load
prior to airdrop. If any damage is noted on the honeycomb, skid board, ties, lashings, etc., the
load will be returned to Aerial Delivery. Training loads may remain onboard during assault
landings and may be dropped after they are re-inspected by the loadmaster prior to the airdrop.
Minimize assault landings with training loads on board.
9.10. Simulated Instrument Flight. Simulated instrument flight may be flown and logged
without use of a vision-restricting device. The use of a hood or other artificial vision-restricting
device for any phase of flight is prohibited.

                                          Chapter 11

                                NAVIGATOR PROCEDURES

11.1. General. In addition to the duties listed in the flight manual, other applicable technical
orders, and this instruction, the PIC may assign other duties to the navigator(s), as necessary.
This chapter provides guidance on navigator procedures for all missions and completion of
applicable forms. In addition, MC130P right navigators and MC130W navigators/CSOs will
comply with applicable Chapter 14, Electronic Warfare Officer Procedures.
11.2. Mission Planning. Regardless of whether a mission is prepared by the aircrew or is
furnished by another agency, the PIC and navigator will jointly verify routing, altitudes, terrain
clearance, airspace deconfliction, cargo and fuel load prior to departure. On overseas flights,
verify the flight planned routing against the diplomatic clearance, if applicable.
   11.2.1. Flight Plans. Forms printed from certified flight planning systems and manual flight
   plans are authorized. Computed data will match aircraft type, configuration, requirements,
   and limitations for mission to be flown.
   11.2.2. Fuel Plans. Forms printed from certified flight planning systems and manual fuel
   plans are authorized. Computed data will match aircraft type, configuration, requirements,
   and limitations for the mission to be flown. Refer to paragraph 11.5 of this regulation for
   mission fuel planning procedures. A fuel plan is required for all flights except local area
   training flights with established standard ramp fuel loads.
   11.2.3. Fuel Conservation. When practical, plan the most direct routing possible or utilize
   wind and altitude optimized routing to promote fuel conservation.. Plan missions using 95%
   engines. For -15 engines, this corresponds to a 970 TIT en route power setting, 900 TIT for -
   7 engines.
   11.2.4. Equal time point (ETP) Calculations. Wind factor and ETP data computations are
   required when portions of the planned route transit oceanic airspace and the total time
   between the last suitable airfield (LSAF) and the first suitable airfield (FSAF) is 5 hours or
   more. Suitable airfields are those within 100 NM of flight planned course centerline meeting
   criteria set in Chapter 5 (Airland Operations) that have single-tandem weight-bearing
   capacity for the anticipated gross weight. Refer to AFTTP 33.MC130 Attachment 5 for ETP
   calculations.
   11.2.5. Signature. Sign all fuel and flight plans that are used for missions. This signature
   will signify all data entered manually or derived electronically was checked for accuracy.
   11.2.6. Computer software. Uncertified, untested, or beta versions of developing software
   will not be used for actual mission planning.
   11.2.7. Data transfer. If the flight-planning computer transfers a flight plan to the aircraft
   electronically, it will be via an AFSOC approved system.
11.3. Flight Charts. Hardcopy charts and certified moving map systems with current digital
aeronautical flight information file (DAFIF), chart updating manual (CHUM)/Electronic CHUM
and compressed arc-second raster chart (ARC), compressed ARC digitized raster graphic
 82                                                 AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011


(CADRG) data are authorized. Appropriate scale hardcopy charts with applicable data will be
immediately available when moving map systems are used.
   11.3.1. Chart Scale. Use operational navigation chart (ONC), tactical pilotage chart (TPC),
   joint operations graphic (JOG), or equivalent scale charts for departure/arrival areas. Use jet
   navigation chart (JNC), JNC-high altitude (JNCA), or global navigation chart (GNC) scale
   charts when portions of the planned route transit oceanic airspace. Use JNCA scale chart or
   larger for non-oceanic high-level routes. Use TPC or larger scale charts for low-level routes.
   11.3.2. Chart Data.  Enough information will be present to ensure safe mission
   accomplishment. Display mission-appropriate information on charts IAW applicable
   employment sections of this regulation. At a minimum, the following items will be
   annotated on charts:
       11.3.2.1. All charts will display flight plan waypoints and course line. Each waypoint
       will be identified with an applicable label. Hard copy charts will display series and date.
          11.3.2.1.1. Display ADIZ/Flight Information Regions (FIR) boundaries pertinent to
          route.
          11.3.2.1.2. ETP if required.
          11.3.2.1.3. Identify and label suitable emergency airfields. Consider the following
          factors when selecting emergency airfields: type aircraft, weather conditions, runway
          length, runway weight-bearing capacity, runway lighting, radio navigational aids, and
          proximity to planned flight path.
          11.3.2.1.4. Display SUA pertinent to the route.
              11.3.2.1.4.1. Applicable items from airspace control order (ACO)/airspace
              control plan (ACP). NOTE: FLIP en route charts may be referenced in lieu of
              plotting airspace information if the en route charts are current and used during
              mission planning and flight.
       11.3.2.2. In addition to the above requirements, portions of route at or below 3,000 ft
       AGL, charts will include magnetic course, minimum safe altitude (MSA), and MSA
       location for each leg of the flight plan.
       11.3.2.3. Display Emergency Safe Altitude (ESA) for the route. The route may be
       segmented, requiring a separate ESA for each route segment.
       11.3.2.4. NVG altitudes will be annotated on charts when NVG low-level is planned.
       11.3.2.5. Display current vector vertical obstruction data (VVOD) data on low-level and
       departure/arrival charts.
11.4. In-flight Procedures.
   11.4.1. Departure and Approach Monitoring. During takeoff and landing, cross-check
   available flight instruments and navigational aids with the airborne radar to ensure the
   aircraft remains clear of obstructions. On all departures and arrivals, have the appropriate
   approach plate open to monitor course, timing, and altitude. Backup the pilots and assist as
   necessary. Report any deviations immediately. Assist in clearing for other aircraft when
   possible. Confine activities to these critical duties during all departures and arrivals.
AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011                                                                  83


   11.4.2. Flight Records Completion. On standard routes record entries in ETA/actual time of
   arrival (ATA) blocks of AF Form 4116, Computer Flight Plan (CFP), or other applicable
   form. On routes when portions of the planned route transit oceanic airspace and the total
   time between the last suitable airfield and the first suitable airfield is 5 hours or more, record
   time, aircraft position, and spot wind at least once each hour when present and future position
   is assured by either valid computed air navigation system (CANS)/self contained navigation
   system (SCNS)/mission computer (MC) data or moving map system. Begin manual log
   procedures using AF Form 4116 or other applicable form from last recorded fix when
   positional accuracy of these systems are degraded or denied. Whichever form is used, it will
   be completed in sufficient detail to fully evaluate or reconstruct the flight. NOTE:
   Immediately report malfunctions or loss of navigational capability that will degrade course
   centerline accuracy to ATC.
      11.4.2.1. Each hour after initial level off, plot each fix or position along with time at that
      position. Fixes/positions may be numbered and corresponding numbers entered into
      position column of the log instead of the geo coordinates or descriptive position.
   11.4.3. True Airspeed (TAS) Check. Compute a TAS check on all flights when portions of
   the planned route transit regions with no or unreliable navigation aids (NAVAID) exceeding
   three hours. Compute within one hour after reaching the initial cruise altitude.
   11.4.4. Deviation Check. Perform a compass deviation check for all magnetic compass
   systems on flights when route portions transit regions with no or unreliable NAVAIDs
   exceeding three hours. Accomplish as soon as practical after initial level off or coast out.
   Refer to AFTTP 33.MC130 Attachment 5 for deviation check calculations.
   11.4.5. In-Flight Fuel. In-flight fuel management is required on all missions. Monitor fuel
   status once per hour on all flights. Compute/record fuel status once per hour when route
   portions transit regions with no or unreliable NAVAIDs exceeding three hours. Averaging
   current en route burn rate and planned terminal fuel flow (TFF) to calculate fuels may be
   used.
   11.4.6. ETP. Re-compute the ETP when the actual arrival over any reporting point prior to
   the ETP exceeds 15 minutes ahead or behind and the change was caused by erroneous wind
   information. If the change was caused by factors other than a change in the wind (i.e., slow
   TAS or deviation for weather), simply compute a new ETA to the ETP, as the ETP itself will
   not have changed.

  11.5.1. Calculate highest acceptable flight level using the applicable performance T.O.
  information. Use Cruise Ceiling chart (four engines, normal bleed) corrected for drag and
  temperature deviation to compute cruise ceiling.
  11.5.2. En Route Fuel.
     11.5.2.1. En Route Fuel using performance T.O. Use the Range Summary Fuel Flow
     chart (four engines, 95% engines) for planned airspeed. Compute fuel flow corrected for
     drag and temperature deviation for starting and ending gross weights. Add the computed
     fuel flows and divide in half to compute average fuel flow. Multiply average fuel flow
     by four and mission duration in hours. EXAMPLE: (1.6 + 1.4) / 2 = 1.5 average fuel
     flow per engine. 1.5 x 4 x 6 = 36 thousand pounds of fuel required from level off to
     destination. Add to this the fuel required for climb-out using the Fuel to Climb chart
     corrected for drag and temperature deviation. EXAMPLE: 36 + 1.8 = 37.8 thousand
     pounds of fuel required from departure to destination.
     11.5.2.2. En Route Fuel using certified flight planning system. Use computed total fuel
     from departure to destination.
  11.5.3. Terminal Fuel Flow.

     Flow chart (four engines, 95% engines) for planned airspeed. Compute fuel flow
     corrected for drag and temperature deviation for ending gross weights. Multiply fuel
     flow by four. EXAMPLE: 1.5 x 4 = 6 thousand pounds per hour.
     11.5.3.2. Terminal Fuel Flow using certified flight planning system. Use computed fuel
     flow from last applicable en route leg prior to destination.
  11.5.4. Reserve. 10% of flight time between planned refueling points, not to exceed 45
  minutes at normal cruise. A minimum of 20 minutes reserve is required on all missions.

  11.5.5. Alternate. Determine flight time from overhead destination or end air refueling
  (EAR) to alternate/abort airfield, or most distant alternate when two are required. Compute
  at terminal fuel flow.
  11.5.6. Missed Approach. 2,200 pounds. Required if destination is below ceiling
  minimums, but above visibility minimums. Not applicable for remote or island destinations.
  11.5.7. Holding. Used when alternate not available, located in Alaska, or at latitudes greater
  than 59 degrees N/S. Use 3,500 pounds. May compute at terminal fuel flow for 45 minutes.
  11.5.8. Approach. 1,000 pounds. Entry always required.
  11.5.9. Landing. 4,000 pounds. Entry always required.
  11.5.10. Identified Extra.
     11.5.10.1. Pressure Loss. Additional fuel for pressure loss at ETP, used when
     pressurized, carrying passengers, and aircraft oxygen not available to the passengers.

              11.5.10.3. Off-course Maneuvers. Fuel for anticipated off-course maneuvering for
              terrain, thunderstorm avoidance, ATC requirements. Compute at 100 pounds/minute for
              departure, 50/minute for en route fuel.
              11.5.10.4. Icing. 500 pounds for each hour of anticipated icing.
              11.5.10.5. Known Holding Delays.       Fuel for anticipated or planned holding time.
              Compute at terminal fuel flow.
              11.5.10.6. Insufficient/Unreliable NAVAIDS. 1,000 pounds maximum.                                                                  Add for
              insufficient or unreliable NAVAIDs at destination.
              11.5.10.7. Refueling Off-load. Fuel planned for refueling off-load.
    11.5.11. Taxi and Runup. Normally 1,300 pounds. For known time delays or additional
    engine running ground time in excess of 30 minutes, add 50 pounds/minute.
    11.5.12. Unidentified Extra. Difference between required ramp fuel and actual ramp fuel.
    11.5.13. Endurance using applicable performance T.O. information. Use Specific Range
    chart (four engines, 95% engines) at planned airspeed, corrected for drag to compute nautical
    miles per 1,000 pounds of fuel. Multiply computed number by takeoff fuel, then divide by
    1,000. Next divide by planned average groundspeed. EXAMPLE: (54 x 40,000) / 1,000 =
    2,160 miles. 2,160 / 270 ground speed (GS) = 8 hours of endurance.

                    FLIGHT ENGINEER PROCEDURES AND FORMS

12.1. General. In addition to the duties listed in the flight manual, other applicable technical
orders, and this instruction, the PIC may assign other duties to the flight engineer, as necessary.
12.2. Authority to Clear a Red X. Flight engineers are normally not authorized to clear a red
X. In a situation where the aircraft is on a red X and qualified maintenance personnel are
unavailable, the flight engineer may obtain authorization to clear the red X from the home station
MXG/CC or designated representative in accordance with T.O. 00201.
   12.2.1. At en route stations, flight engineers are authorized to clear red X symbols for:
   intake and exhaust inspections, dust covers and plugs installed, and aircraft panels removed
   and installed to facilitate other maintenance.
   12.2.2. Other crew members are not authorized to clear a red X.
12.3. In-Process Inspections. Flight engineers must be aware of their responsibility to perform
in-process inspections when clearing red X symbols. During the assembly where further
assembly will prevent the required inspection of the item, an in-process inspection will be
performed. The inspection will be documented IAW T.O. 00201.
12.4. Aircraft Servicing. Flight engineers are normally not required to refuel or defuel aircraft;
however, the flight engineer is qualified and authorized to accomplish these duties when
maintenance personnel are not available. If ground support personnel are not available, the flight
engineer will act as the refueling supervisor and the PIC will designate other crew members to
assist the flight engineer. Use the appropriate checklist during all refueling and defueling
operations.
   12.4.1. Concurrent Ground Operations. The PIC and Concurrent Servicing Supervisor
   (CSS) shall ensure aircrew members and servicing personnel accomplish concurrent
   servicing (CS) in accordance with T.O. 0025172 and servicing technical orders.
       12.4.1.1. Simultaneous fuel and oxygen servicing is not authorized.
       12.4.1.2. Winching of rolling stock and non-spark producing (i.e., wooden) pallets is
       authorized. Driving vehicles equipped with spark arresters is authorized during fuel
       servicing. When loading vehicles without spark arresters, the vehicles must be either
       completely inside the cargo compartment, or outside of the established fuel servicing
       safety zone, before fuel servicing lines can be pressurized. EXCEPTION: Diesel and
       turbo-charged (without waste gates) gasoline-powered vehicles can be on/off-loaded
       without having to stop fuel flow.
   12.4.2. Hot Refueling. Hot refueling (refueling with aircraft engines running) will only be
   conducted by crews that have been authorized and certified according to AFI 11235.
12.5. Preparation for NVG Operations.
   12.5.1. Pull the nosewheel well light circuit breaker.
   12.5.2. Ensure blackout curtains are installed and functional.
 88                                                  AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011


   12.5.3. Check external IR lights for proper operation and possible bleed-through.
   12.5.4. Tape any non-compatible indicator lights on the flight deck.
   12.5.5. Ensure flight deck equipment/gear is secure/stowed.
12.6. Flight monitoring. The flight engineer will monitor all aircraft systems during all phases
of flight and ground operations. Notify the PIC of all abnormal indications and take appropriate
action. Additionally, the Flight Engineer will:
   12.6.1. During mountainous low-level, state ―190 Knots‖ when en route airspeed decays to
   190 knots and state in 10 knot increments below 190 knots (e.g., ―180,‖ ―170‖) until airspeed
   recovers or as directed by the PIC.
   12.6.2. Maintain outside vigilance and taxi clearances when flight deck duties allow.
   12.6.3. Advise and assist the pilots in maintaining required climb and cruise power.
   12.6.4. Monitor TF/low-level operations, particularly altitude, bank angle, airspeed, and
   heading.
   12.6.5. Ensure both pilots‘ heading markers are set correctly during the turn point briefing
   (MC-130E TF and MC-130P low-level operations). Ensure both pilots‘ and navigator radar
   altimeters are set correctly for the specific TF/low-level altitude or instrument approach.
   12.6.6. State ―17,000‖ over interphone when any engine torque approaches this value.
   NOTE: In the event of an inadvertent over-torque, refer to Table 12.1 Carefully consider
   the over-torque actions criteria in order to determine mission impact.

Table 12.1. Over-torque Actions.
  Torque Reading                                    Required Actions
       (in-lbs)
 19,600 – 21,500          781A Entry. Historical tracking only. No inspection required.
 21,500 – 23,000          781A Entry. Visual inspection within 25 flight hours.
                          781A Entry. Maintenance required for NDI and engine mounts change
 Over 23,000              within 25 flight hours. Mag plug check. Reduction Gearbox may
                          require change if gearbox oil pressure is lower than before over-torque.
 WARNING: Failure to comply with these criteria could result in catastrophic structural
 failure.
 NOTE: The 25-flight hour limit is based on flight time to return the aircraft for maintenance.
 AFSOC aircraft that experience an over-torque over 23,000 in-lbs are to immediately return
 the aircraft for inspection and required maintenance.
   12.6.7. Notify the pilots when aircraft configuration is incorrect for the maneuver.
12.7. Forms Management. In addition to the procedures in T.O. 00201 and AFI 11401, the
flight engineer will assist the pilot in maintaining the AFTO Form 781. Verify the exceptional
release is signed before flight and resigned, if necessary, at en route stops.
   12.7.1. After each flight, ensure the number of discrepancies (if any), landings, flight
   duration time(s), etc., are entered on the AFTO 781H. Review all AFTO 781A discrepancies
   and ensure symbols, date discovered, and clear, detailed entries are entered and the
   discovered by blocks are signed for each discrepancy.
AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011                                                             89


   12.7.2. IAW DESC-I-31, Purchase of Aviation Fuel and Services at Commercial Locations,
   all off-station fuel purchases (to include FARP and in-flight refueling) will be logged on
   AFTO 781H and AF Form 664 if applicable.
   12.7.3. An automated inspection, repair, corrosion and aircraft tracking (AIRCAT)
   worksheet (electronic or paper copy) will be completed for all flights IAW T.O. 1C130101.
   AIRCAT worksheets will be entered into the AIRCAT reporting system within 3 duty days
   of the flight or return from TDY. Deployed units will establish criteria to input AIRCAT
   data within a reasonable time period depending on network support of the deployed unit. If
   unable to obtain connectivity with the AIRCAT server due to austere conditions, units will
   attempt to inform OGV of the situation and any delays in AIRCAT reporting.
   12.7.4. IAW AFMAN 23110, USAF Supply Manual, the flight engineer will record all in-
   flight transfers from C130 tanker aircraft to any receiver aircraft on the AF Form 791. This
   form will also be accomplished for FARP off-loads and fuel jettison in excess of 1,000
   pounds. Turn completed forms into maintenance debrief. Instructions for completing AF
   Form 791 can be found on the AFSOC/A3V Community of Practice Website.
12.8. Performance Data Computations AF Form 4064, C130 TOLD Card.
   12.8.1. Flight engineers should make every effort to use the performance manual when
   computing performance data for the first takeoff of the day. Flight engineers may use
   approved tabulated data or approved TOLD computer. Complete TOLD card for takeoff
   prior to the BEFORE STARTING ENGINES checklist. Complete data applicable to the type
   of takeoff and landing to be made (i.e., landing distance for normal landing; ground roll for
   assault landings). Base all performance calculations on the worst case scenario, 95% engine
   efficiency without nosewheel steering, unless mission requirements dictate otherwise.
   Calculate an additional torque value based on 100% engine efficiency to identify the actual
   efficiency when setting takeoff power. Do not accept any engine with less than 95%
   efficiency. EXCEPTION: MC130E all engines will operate at a minimum of 98% engine
   efficiency for terrain following missions.
   12.8.2. When stop and go operations are planned, the flight engineer will compute and post
   critical field length using either reduced power TIT or maximum power.
12.9. AF Form 4063, Pilot Information Card. Group OGV is authorized to approve
overprinting the blank blocks of the AF Form 4063, Pilot Information Card (a.k.a. ―Mini TOLD
Card‖). Submit information copies to AFSOC/A3V upon approval.
   12.9.1. Record adjusted speeds to be used. For example, record minimum control speed
   (one engine inoperative in ground effect) as takeoff speed if minimum control speed is higher
   than computed takeoff speed.
   12.9.2. Following initial takeoff and landing, recalculate affected speeds if favorable
   conditions afford an additional margin of safety in all other areas (e.g., gross weight
   decreases due to fuel burn off, while pressure altitude and temperature remain constant). The
   minimum TOLD card computations required for a termination landing are: air minimum
   control speeds, obstacle clearance speed, three-engine climb speed, and 50% and 100%
   landing speeds.

   12.9.3. When total cruise time will exceed four hours, the flight engineer should post
   applicable cruise data one hour after the start of the cruise. Cruise data should be updated
   hourly. Flight Engineers will compute zero and 50% flap obstacle clearance speeds for all
   low-levels. Stall speeds along with other pertinent performance data should be posted for all
   low-level operations. Always have two- and three-engine service ceilings readily available.
12.10. Hostile Environment Operations. Remove all nonessential equipment from the aircraft
prior to combat missions. Hostile Environment Repair Procedures (HERP) and tool kit
requirements can be found in AFSOCM 11201, Hostile Environment Repair Procedures. If a
combat or contingency situation makes prior coordination impractical or impossible, complete
the necessary procedure and notify the approval authority at the earliest opportunity.

13.10. Supporting/Supported Forces Procedures. The loadmaster will ensure forces are
properly manifested as passengers. Give one copy of the manifest to the PIC for filing and retain
sufficient copies for border clearance. The loadmaster will ensure completion of antihijacking
requirements for forces in accordance with AFI 13207 and this instruction.
13.11. Border Clearance. Customs, immigration, and agriculture inspections require certain
forms for border clearance. The loadmaster will ensure that the required forms are contained in
the aircraft mission kit. Distribute the forms to the crew, ensure their completion prior to
landing, and deliver them to the proper inspection officials.
13.12. Weight and Balance. Accomplish weight and balance computation for the aircraft in
accordance with T.O. 11B50, Weight and Balance. A basic handbook of weight and balance
containing current aircraft status is maintained by the unit possessing the aircraft. A
supplemental weight and balance handbook for each aircraft is stored on board. This is a binder
containing a certified copy of Chart C providing the current basic weight and moment, and will
also include the applicable T.O. 1C130(M)X-5 and this AFI‘s addenda. Ensure sufficient blank
copies of DD Form 365-4 for the anticipated mission(s) are on board prior to flight.
   13.12.1. Compute weight and balance either using the Chart E mathematical (moments)
   method or approved Automated AF Form F (AFF) software. Compute DD Form 365-4 in
   accordance with this AFI‘s applicable addenda.
   13.12.2. Presently AFF software does not accommodate AFSOC-specific airframes. If used,
   center of gravity limits for takeoff and landing must be physically checked against T.O.
   1C130M(X)5. Estimated landing fuel function will also be used as software does not support
   HAAR/TAAR, AAR, and AFSOC fuel burn rates. These items and actual MDS will be
   annotated in the additional remarks block of the AAF. Two copies will be printed, one will
   remain on board until mission termination. Make every attempt to leave the other copy with
   air terminal/maintenance personnel remaining on the ground.
   13.12.3. The weight and balance section of the unit possessing the aircraft is responsible for
   providing the appropriate agency with information required to keep documents current and
   accurate.
13.13. Fuel Weight Computation. To compute takeoff fuel weight entered on the DD Form
365-4, read directly from each gauge and compute the sum for total fuel weight. Compute
limiting wing fuel computations using the charts in the appropriate flight manual, this AFI‘s
applicable addenda, or AFF software.
13.14. (MC130W) Munitions Operations Procedures.
   13.14.1. Ammunition will not be removed from the ammunition cans until they are in place
   for loading.
   13.14.2. Ensure a FOD check is accomplished under the aircraft and in the loading area
   when up/down loading is complete.

                                           Chapter 15

                  AIRBORNE MISSION SPECIALIST SYSTEMS (AMSS)

15.1. General. The Airborne Mission Systems Specialist is responsible to the PIC for the
proper programming, management, operation and in-flight troubleshooting of communications,
navigation, IFF/SIF, and specialized mission equipment. In addition to the duties listed in the
flight manual, other applicable technical orders, and this instruction, the PIC may assign other
duties to the AMSS as necessary. This chapter provides guidance on AMSS procedures for all
missions and completion of applicable forms.
   15.1.1. Specifically, the AMSS will tune, configure, operate, and troubleshoot voice and data
   communications systems and manage communications nets to support mission requirements;
   perform frequency management, recommend, and make required communications changes;
   compile and transmit required in-flight and position reports to appropriate facilities; be
   familiar with communication threat systems; and coordinate, obtain, use, and control
   COMSEC and transmission security (TRANSEC) material and equipment.
   15.1.2. Further, the AMSS will scan for ground and air threats using night vision devices
   (MC130P only); direct aircraft defensive maneuvers and operate aircraft defensive systems
   as required; scan for terrain and aircraft avoidance during ground/airborne operations.
   15.1.3. Additionally, the AMSS will provide assistance to the pilots and navigators by
   monitoring aircraft altitude, heading, and position through SCNS, control and display unit
   (CDU), portable flight planning system (PFPS) and charts. The AMSS will establish and
   maintain communications with appropriate C2 agencies; to include AWACS, CRC, ATC,
   FSS and Oceanic Control as directed.
15.2. Mission Planning. The AMSS will verify COMSEC/TRANSEC requirements,
frequencies, callsigns, routing, altitudes, terrain clearance, airspace deconfliction and equipment
status with the PIC and/or navigator prior to departure. Preferably mission planning should be
accomplished the day prior to flight. For overseas flights, verify the flight plan with the
navigator and clarify position reporting duties. If mission planning is completed by another
AMSS for any reason, the flying AMSS will ensure all required items are accomplished and
briefed to the PIC and navigator.
   15.2.1. Non-mission Sortie. Most sorties not using either the COMBAT ENTRY/COMBAT
   EXIT or INFIL/EXFIL checklist will be considered non-mission sorties.              Allied
   Communications Publications (ACP) 121-series, as supplemented, prescribes procedures for
   HF communication between aircraft and ground stations for most circumstances. All AMSSs
   must be proficient in the use of these ACP series (http://jcs.dtic.mil/j6/cceb/acps/) in
   addition to ACP 122, 131, 135, 160 (U.S. Sup 1C), and Joint Army Navy Air Force
   Publication (JANAP) 146. Ensure long-range communication, primarily HF and SATCOM
   secondary, are established prior to departing VHF/UHF range.
   15.2.2. Mission Sorties. Any sortie using either the COMBAT ENTRY/COMBAT EXIT or
   INFIL/EXFIL checklist will be considered a mission sortie. Communications requirements
   in support of covert or sensitive operations dictate the AMSS blend in with certain existing or
   mobile ground stations and avoid attracting attention to the mission. The AMSS will use
   "ground" style communication procedures in accordance with ACP 125, instead of ACP 121
98                                                 AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011


  U.S. Supp-2, when flying in a tactical environment and will make every effort to avoid
  identifying their station as an aircraft. Long-range communication channels will be as
  directed by the mission controlling authority.
  15.2.3. Aircraft Status. As soon as possible, verify communication, navigation, and IFF/SIF
  equipment status with maintenance. Advise the PIC and navigator of any limitations to
  support mission requirements. If possible, have a work-around plan available. NOTE:
  Once airborne, the PIC must approve continued operations of malfunctioning equipment that
  would affect the mission.
  15.2.4. Frequencies and Callsigns. The AMSS will review the ATO prior to each flight
  when deployed or during exercise participation; additionally, review at a minimum SPINS
  Chapters 2, 3, and 7. Use current FLIP, in-flight guides (IFG) and other documents and
  publications     for    current    frequencies.       FLIP     can    be     obtained   at:
  (https://www1.nga.mil/ProductsServices/Aeronautical/FlightInfoPubs/Pages/default.asp
  x). Obtain emergency airfield information from the navigator and identify communications
  and available services at the designated emergency airfields. Obtain aircraft types and
  callsigns for all aerial refueling operations; check IFGs and applicable DoD FLIP Area
  Planning publications for A/R track information as required. Be prepared to brief the crew
  on mission communications. NOTE: Figure 15.1 through Figure 15.5 contain listings of
  commonly used frequencies, including search and rescue, citizen band, and the AN/ARC-222
  International Maritime Channel presets.
  15.2.5. Communications Threat Planning. When deployed or during exercise participation,
  the AMSS will obtain information on enemy systems that can effect communications,
  navigation and IFF equipment in the mission area. On operational missions, the AMSS
  should be prepared to employ antijam communications. The AMSS will brief the crew on
  current ECM procedures. NOTE: HAVE QUICK II and SINGGARS antijam capability is
  not secure and will not be used for classified transmissions unless in conjunction with a
  secure voice system.
  15.2.6. Special Use Airspace. When planned flying in warning areas, military operations
  areas (MOA), restricted areas, or ATC-assigned working areas, the AMSS will contact the
  controlling station during mission planning and confirm timing, scheduled activity and
  communication procedures to the extent possible. During crew briefing, the AMSS will brief
  the PIC and navigator on any conflicts or issues that could effect the mission.
  15.2.7. COMSEC. As required, review the COMSEC Call Out or other applicable
  documents as soon as possible to ensure the correct materials are available or ordered in time
  for the mission. Maintain positive control of all COMSEC material IAW with instructions,
  supplements, and operating instructions (OI) once issued. Document safe inventory,
  complete daily destruction, and issue current COMSEC material IAW COMSEC
  instructions, supplements, and OIs as required. The AMSS will be responsible for the
  security of classified mission documents and software for equipment as required or directed.
  15.2.8. Briefings. Attend crew briefings and/or route study to obtain all pertinent
  information on purpose, route of flight, mission objective(s). Obtain a copy of the flight plan
  from the Navigator. The use of forms printed from certified flight planning systems and
  manual flight plans are authorized. Computed data will match aircraft type, configuration,
  requirements, and limitations for mission to be flown. Brief crew of airfield deconfliction as
AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011                                                               99


   required. NOTE: The PIC may release the AMSS from route study if attendance would
   adversely affect preflight duties. Every effort should be made to attend.
15.3. Communications Procedures.
   15.3.1. Communication Checks. Communication checks made during pre-flight, en route
   and post flight will be in accordance with ACP 121, U.S. Sup-2. It is the responsibility of the
   AMSS to be aware of OPSEC requirements prior to making any communication checks.
   15.3.2. ATC Communications: Unless tactical duties prohibit it, the AMSS will perform
   ATC communications in coordination with the PIC. During ground operations, assist in
   clearing for other aircraft when possible. NOTE: Confine activities to critical duties during
   all departures and arrivals.     NOTE: The AMSS will monitor the primary radio and
   interphone at all times. The AMSS will notify the PIC before leaving and when returning to
   his/her duty station.
   15.3.3. Position Reporting: Transmit all ATC communication and associated air reports to
   ICAO aeronautical stations in accordance with FLIP General Planning, FLIP charts, and the
   FIH. ICAO HF en route position reporting will be in accordance with the FIH and applicable
   FLIP documents.
   15.3.4. Mission Reporting. The AMSS will support the mission commander and/or the PIC
   with all C2 communications as required in Chapter 2 of this publication or as directed.
   Monitor SATCOM (primary) and USAF Global HF stations (secondary) on operational
   sorties for the duration of the mission and pass traffic as directed or required. Additionally,
   the AMSS will report "Ops Normal" as required by appropriate operations order (OPORD).
   If SATCOM is inoperative, the AMSS will send traffic via USAF Global HF stations
   primary, or by any available means, including: military affiliated radio station (MARS),
   military aeronautical communications system (MACS), or FSS relays to the controlling C2
   agency as specified in the OPORD, operations plan (OPLAN), theater concept of operations
   (CONOPS), and/or mission directive.
   15.3.5. Frequency Monitoring. The AMSS will normally control the use of primary C2
   frequency and notify the PIC of the primary C2 frequency and other mission/tactical
   frequencies in use. The AMSS will coordinate on radio configuration and use with the pilots
   and navigator. Support agencies may advise aircrews via the controlling ATC agency to
   establish contact when communication is needed. Periodic "Ops Normal" calls or continuous
   monitoring of global HF station frequencies is normally not required. In times of increased
   tensions, constant monitoring of command and control channels may be required.
   15.3.6. Joint Spectrum Interface Resolution (JSIR) Reports. EMI can be caused by enemy,
   neutral, friendly, or natural sources, the primary difference between hostile and no hostile
   EMI is intention. The AMSS will report any hostile interference experienced while
   supporting joint operations in accordance with Joint Task Force or Combatant Command
   procedures (see SPINS). When EMI is suspected to be non-intentional, file reports through
   the unit frequency manager. Refer to DoD FIH Section B for JSIR report procedures and
   AFI 10707, Spectrum Interference Resolution Program, for additional JSIR program
   information. NOTE: JSIR reports are always transmitted via secure means (air or ground).
   15.3.7. Weather Forecasts. For all flights outside the local area, the AMSS will obtain the
   destination and alternate (if applicable) forecasts, to include pressure altitude and
 100                                                 AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011


   temperature, before reaching the equal time point (ETP) and one hour prior to ETA. When
   marginal weather is expected, provide the PIC and navigator with forecasts and timely
   updates, to include alternate landing fields. Whenever SIGMETs are received from any
   source, contact the nearest USAF weather facility to determine mission applicability.
   15.3.8. AF Form 4122, Airborne Radio Log. Complete the AF Form 4122 in accordance
   with paragraph 15.4. The AMSS will complete a single AF Form 4122 for each day‘s flight
   or flights. Radio longs are normally unclassified; however, if classified information is
   entered into the radio log, it must be properly marked and will be handled and stored in
   accordance with current security directives. Unclassified radio logs when completed are
   legal flight records and will be kept in a chronological transitory file for at least 30 days.

                 DIRECT SUPPORT OPERATOR (DSO) PROCEDURES

16.1. General. This volume establishes procedures for AFSOC Direct Support Operators
(DSOs) for employment of MC130 aircraft. In addition to the duties listed in applicable
technical orders, directives, and this instruction, the PIC may assign other duties as necessary.
The DSO is primarily responsible for providing inputs to enhance aircrew situational awareness.
16.2. Mission Planning Factors.
   16.2.1. Mission Planning. Detailed information on mission planning can be found in AFTTP
   31.General Planning(S), AFTTP 31.Threat Guide(S), AFTTP 31.MC130(S), and AFTTP
   33.MC130(U).
   16.2.2. The DSO, after coordinating with the supporting analyst and other appropriate
   agencies, will conduct mission planning with the aircrew of all combat mission scenarios.
   The DSO will brief expected scenario inputs based on the analytical data, as required.
   16.2.3. The DSO is responsible for coordinating with all appropriate agencies to obtain all
   required or anticipated mission planning, professional, and SILENT Shield equipment for the
   duration of the flight/deployment. The DSO will ensure all equipment is inventoried and
   inspected prior to flight/deployment.
16.3. Preflight/In-flight Responsibilities. The DSO will:
   16.3.1. Brief the crew on the SILENT SHIELD equipment configuration and anticipated
   inputs.
   16.3.2. Ensure the crew is aware of SILENT SHIELD capabilities and limitations, as well as
   operational security considerations.
   16.3.3. Monitor situational awareness information and relay pertinent information to the
   crew.
   16.3.4. Advise the crew of any change in the status of mission equipment.
   16.3.5. The DSO is responsible for knowing approximate aircraft location, altitude, and
   intentions at all times.
16.4. Communications Procedures. When missions require the DSO to communicate, they
will obtain proper frequencies, time hack, schedules, and callsigns prior to flight. Depending on
the nature of the mission and the communications, the DSO will keep the crew updated on any
pertinent information and will coordinate with the PIC for authorization to transmit. On MC130
aircraft, the DSO will coordinate with the crew during mission planning regarding interphone
connectivity.
16.5. Post Mission. In addition to appropriate debriefs, the DSO will also ensure:
   16.5.1. Equipment write-ups are passed on to maintenance.
   16.5.2. Post mission technical summary (TECHSUM) inputs are provided to the supporting
   analyst.

   16.5.3. Provide information to their units summarizing mission events, as required.
16.6. Augmentation. Some contingency operations may require operators from other units, or
in some cases, non-aircrew personnel to provide tactical cryptologic support. In these cases, a
mission-ready instructor-qualified DSO will fly as the primary DSO and be responsible for DSO
inputs.

                                           Chapter 17

                        COMMON EMPLOYMENT PROCEDURES

17.1. General. This chapter provides regulatory guidance for MC130 common employment
procedures as well as AFSOC-operated C130s. This instruction and the tactical manuals are not
exclusive sources for their respective subject matters; some duplication exists to more effectively
convey the information.
17.2. Mission Planning. All pilots, navigators, and EWOs will conduct a route study prior to
any low-level operations. The route study will emphasize NVG limitations and performance
factors and their impact on terrain and obstacle clearance.
   17.2.1. Survival and Protective Equipment. All personnel will wear the survival and
   protective gear provided during hostile environment operations. EXCEPTION: Pilots may
   doff equipment that interferes with control yoke movement. Such equipment, if available,
   includes, but is not limited to the following: flak vest, LPU, survival vest and kit,
   parachute/harness (chute readily available), and protective headgear.
   17.2.2. Charts. Planned routes will be drawn on a 1:500,000 (TPC) or larger scale chart.
   Crews will use a 1:250,000 (JOG) or larger scale chart for overland threat penetration
   operations, mountainous NVG low-level operations, and objective areas, unless not available
   or of inferior quality to the TPC. If a TPC is used for planning, adjust MSA altitudes to
   account for the larger contour interval unless terrain elevation can be positively verified by
   other means. If electronic charts are used, a backup paper chart must be immediately
   available for each crew member using electronic charts. WARNING: Aeronautical charts do
   not depict man-made obstacles less than 200 ft AGL (may be higher outside the U.S.) or a
   change in terrain until it exceeds the chart contour interval. The worst situation would occur
   if a 199 ft tower sat on terrain with an elevation just below the next higher contour. For a
   1:500,000 (TPC) with a contour interval of 500 ft, this results in an uncharted obstacle
   existing 698 ft above charted terrain. Additionally, the highest spot elevation on any given
   leg may not be the highest terrain as in the case of gradually rising elevations. Crews must
   ensure accurate terrain analysis by evaluating spot elevations, the highest contour level, and
   digital terrain elevation data (DTED) information. NOTE: If an NVG route (any terrain
   condition) has been planned using a JOG and elevations and altitudes are verified, the route
   may be flown with reference to a TPC.
       17.2.2.1. Color copies and laminated charts are acceptable provided the contour and
       contrast remains intact and the same chart is used for preflight route study and flight. If
       laminated charts are used, the crew will ensure the laminate does not degrade quality or
       readability of the chart and all data remains intact.
       17.2.2.2. Minimize chart clutter. NVG altitudes will be annotated on charts when NVG
       low-level is planned. Start climb points and the controlling terrain location will be
       annotated on charts if required due to mission factors such as terrain elevation changes,
       hidden terrain, reduced visibility or low lunar illumination.
           17.2.2.2.1. NVG altitudes. NVG altitudes are an altitude designed to provide a
           degree of terrain masking and clearance along the planned flight path. Base NVG
108                                                AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011


         altitudes on terrain elevation 0.5 NM either side of flight planned route, added the
         planned en route AGL altitude.
         17.2.2.2.2. Start climb points are determined to identify where along the planned
         route of flight a climb must be initiated to maintain a specific NVG altitude profile in
         mountainous terrain. These points are determined by working backwards from the
         NVG altitude along the planned route of flight using a pre-planned vertical velocity
         indicator (VVI) or climb gradient.
      17.2.2.3. A daylight route survey will be conducted for all unpublished training routes
      prior to night/IMC operations below 500 ft AGL. Any route or route segment not
      surveyed within the last 12 months will be considered unsurveyed.
  17.2.3. En Route Planning. Crews should fly tactical missions at the highest altitude
  commensurate with the threat environment. During training, greater weather, or altitude
  minimums may be dictated by FLIP, ICAO procedures, or training considerations.
      17.2.3.1. Mountainous terrain is defined as a 500 ft or greater terrain differential in ½
      NM or less.
      17.2.3.2. Emergency Safe Altitude (ESA). ESA is an altitude that will provide positive
      terrain clearance in any weather condition during situations requiring exiting the low-
      level environment. To compute ESA, add 1,000 ft (2,000 ft in mountainous terrain) to
      the highest obstacle, contour line, or terrain feature within 10 NM of route centerline or
      planned flight path, rounded up to the next 100-ft increment. Use of area ESAs is
      recommended whenever possible; however, a single ESA is sufficient when there are no
      significant changes in topography. ESA will be annotated on all flight charts.
      17.2.3.3. Minimum Safe Altitude (MSA). An MSA will be computed and annotated for
      each leg, route segment, or entire low-level route. MSA provides terrain clearance and
      limited threat avoidance during situations interrupting low-level operations. To compute
      MSA, for each leg or leg segment, add 500 ft (or the planned set clearance for TF
      operations) to the highest obstacle, contour line, or terrain feature, within 3 NM of route
      centerline or the planned flight path, rounded up to the next 100-ft increment.
      17.2.3.4. Day VMC. Minimum altitude is 300 ft AGL modified contour (mountainous
      and non-mountainous).
      17.2.3.5. Night VMC (Non-NVG). Minimum altitude is 500 ft above the highest terrain
      or obstacle within 3 NM of route centerline or the planned flight path (mountainous and
      non-mountainous). When the altitude for the next leg or segment is higher than the
      altitude currently being flown, complete the climb prior to the turn point or segment.
      When the altitude for the next leg or segment is lower than the current altitude, do not
      initiate descent until established on the new leg or segment. EXCEPTION: During
      terminal area operations (airdrops and approaches), do not descend from en route altitude
      until the objective is identified and adequate terrain clearance is assured.
      17.2.3.6. NVG Low-level. The minimum altitude is 300 ft AGL (non-mountainous
      terrain) and 500 ft AGL (mountainous terrain). The minimum in-flight visibility is 3 SM
      (or higher if required by host nation VFR criteria). Higher minimum visibility may be
AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011                                                             109


     required to identify and clear obstacles. C130E/H are limited to 500 ft AGL per guidance
     in Chapter 22, Table 22.2
        17.2.3.6.1. Missions planned when the lunar illumination is forecast to be less than
        10% during the mission require an additional level of ORM. The squadron CC/DO
        will be made aware of the ORM assessment and risk mitigation conducted for
        missions planned to be flown in low illumination conditions. WARNING: Do not
        rely on NVGs alone to see and identify ground obstruction or aircraft collision
        hazards. Not all light-emitting diode (LED) obstruction lighting systems are
        compatible with NVGs. Because LEDs have a relatively narrow emission band and
        do not emit infrared energy like incandescent lights, it is possible for them to be
        clearly visible to the naked eye, but be below the range in which NVGs are sensitive
     17.2.3.7. Threat Penetration (TP). Must be pre-planned and is restricted to flat/rolling
     terrain and coastal penetrations. Limit the time at TP altitude to the duration needed to
     avoid/negate the threat. Minimum TP altitude is 100 ft AGL. C130E/H are limited to
     day VMC per guidance in Chapter 22.
     17.2.3.8. IMC Low-Level. Crews may fly low-level in IMC provided they have an
     operable mapping radar (ground map (GM) or precision ground map (PGM) for
     MC130E/H). When an operable TF system is not available, the minimum altitude is
     MSA. During training, conduct planned IMC routes under instrument flight rules (IFR)
     on a published or surveyed route unless FLIP or host nation rules define other
     procedures.
     17.2.3.9. Terrain Following. 250 Set Clearance Plane (SCP) (500 ft for MC130H Ku-
     band TF) is authorized for all terrain and meteorological conditions.
     17.2.3.10. Altimeter settings. Use the best available altimeter setting. Aircrews will
     accurately update all altimeters prior to low-level/objective areas. When a current local
     altimeter setting is not available, or a reliable altitude calibration (ALT CAL) or altitude
     update (ALT UPDATE) cannot be accomplished, use the lowest forecast altimeter setting
     (or TRUE ALT generated if lower than forecast for MC130H).
        17.2.3.10.1. An altimeter setting other than ATC specified should only be used
        outside ATC controlled environments. Use sound judgment when updating aircraft
        altitude/altimeters and cross-check elevations and new settings with all available
        information. WARNING: Obtaining an ALT CAL/ALT UPDATE at a significantly
        higher or lower altitude than the target can induce substantial altimeter error. Use
        extreme caution when updating the pressure altimeter to a higher setting, as lower
        absolute altitudes will result.
        17.2.3.10.2. Apply cold weather altimeter corrections to any barometric altitude
        (MSA, ESA, NVG altitudes, drop altitudes, SCA backup altitudes, SCA minimums,
        etc.) during low-level operations when the outside air temperature is below 32F/0C
        observed or forecast.
            17.2.3.10.2.1. If the aircraft has an operable true altitude function cold weather
            corrections are not required for NVG altitude, drop altitude, SCA backup
            altitudes, and SCA minimums.
 110                                               AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011


17.3. Self Contained Approach (SCA) Planning.
   17.3.1. SCA Restrictions. Comply with local ATC restrictions and host nation agreements,
   as appropriate.
       17.3.1.1. Weather minimums:
          17.3.1.1.1. For NIMA-published SCAs, use published minimums.
          17.3.1.1.2. All other SCAs must be conducted in VMC unless MAJCOM/A3 (or
          delegated approval authority) approves IMC operations. IMC SCA weather
          minimums will be no lower than 200 ft and 1/2 SM (500 ft and 2 SM for C130 E/H).
   17.3.2. Minimum Descent Altitude (MDA). To compute MDA for VMC operations, add
   100 ft to the Touchdown Zone Elevation (TDZE) (300 ft for C130E/H). For approved IMC
   SCA operations, add 200 ft to the TDZE (500 ft for C130E/H).
   17.3.3. Missed Approach Point (MAP). The MAP is no later than zero distance to go on the
   CANS/mission computer/SCNS.
   17.3.4. SCA Template Construction. Use the most current sources for topographic, point
   obstruction, and airfield information.
       17.3.4.1. En Route Altitude. The altitude profile may consist of MSL altitudes, TF radar
       set clearances (as appropriate), NVG altitudes or any combination. In all cases, an MSL
       altitude profile will be planned.
       17.3.4.2. Obstacle Clearance. The location of terrain and obstructions will dictate the
       glide slope and altitude profile used. Use the following procedures to analyze obstacles:
          17.3.4.2.1. Straight-in SCAs. Draw the horizontal obstacle clearance template,
          depicted in Figure 17.1, on a 1:250,000 or larger scale chart, if available. The
          template begins 0.3 NM either side of LZ centerline at the touchdown point,
          extending outward to 1 NM either side of centerline at 3 NM from the touchdown
          point and then extended 1 NM beyond the planned descent point (For example, a 3.2
          NM planned descent point requires a 4.2 NM long template). If the planned descent
          point is less than 2 NM from the touchdown zone, then the standard 3 NM template
          will not require extension. NOTE: These are minimum distances and may be
          increased. Consider such factors as the availability of radar or IDS/forward looking
          infrared (FLIR) targets, recent NAVAID performance, and time of last system
          position/altitude update.
AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011                                                             111


Figure 17.1. SCA Horizontal Obstruction Clearance Template.




         17.3.4.2.2. Turning and Circling SCAs. The obstacle template for a turning or
         circling SCA consists of a modified version of the straight-in template. Draw the
         turning SCA horizontal obstacle clearance template, depicted in Figure 17.2, on a
         1:250,000 or larger scale chart if available. Draw the straight-in portion of the SCA
         template as if planning a straight-in SCA. Select the feeder distance where the
         aircraft will intercept runway centerline. From the pre-planned radius intercepting the
         feeder distance draw an inner and outer corridor. For the outer corridor, draw a
         concentric circle with radius 1 NM greater than the planned radius of turn. For the
         inner corridor, draw a concentric circle with a radius 1 NM less than the planned
         radius of turn. Connect the inner and outer corridors with a line that is perpendicular
         to the approach path at the point where TERM CNST will be selected or 1 NM prior
         to glide slope intercept, whichever occurs first. When the TERM CNST distance or
         glide slope intercept occurs prior to intercepting the turning path, draw lines parallel
         to the offset course tangent to the outer and inner corridors. When using a large
         radius with a short feeder distance, draw a tangent line from the inner corridor to the
         template 0.3 NM abeam the runway. See Figure 17.2 example B.

      17.3.4.3. Significant and critical obstacles. Using current large-scale charts, airfield
      diagrams, airfield sketches, approach plates, and imagery, locate significant obstacles
      within the boundary of the horizontal template. Significant obstacles are those within
      300 ft of the desired glide slope. Determine the HAT for each obstacle by subtracting
      TDZE from the MSL elevation of the obstacle. For each obstacle, plot the along-course
      distance from touchdown and HAT on the critical obstacle graph as shown in Figure
      17.4, Critical Obstacle Chart. An obstacle is considered critical if it falls above the
      reference line for the planned glide slope or its extension along the depicted baseline.
 114                                                AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011


Figure 17.4. Critical Obstacle Chart.




          17.3.4.3.1. For each critical obstacle identified, pre-plan and brief a specific means of
          avoidance to be used during the approach. The following options may be used
          separately or in combination:
              17.3.4.3.1.1. Use a steeper glide slope. Glide slopes exceeding 4.0 degrees
              should be carefully considered due to the high rate of descent required.
              17.3.4.3.1.2. Move the touchdown point further down the runway.
              17.3.4.3.1.3. Increase MDA.
              17.3.4.3.1.4. Establish an intermediate step-down altitude above the MDA at
              which the aircraft will level off until positive separation from the obstacle is
              assured.
              17.3.4.3.1.5. Change the approach to the opposite end of the runway, to a
              crossing runway, parallel runway, etc.
       17.3.4.4. SCA Vertical Template Construction. Starting at the touchdown zone,
       construct a glide slope using the desired gradient (ft/NM) to a point along the final
       approach course (or transition path, if applicable) where it intercepts the planned
       approach altitude (refer to Figure 17.5). Annotate the glide slope MSL and AGL
       altitudes for each 0.5 NM distance-to-go increment out to the planned descent point.
AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011                                                             115


Figure 17.5. SCA Vertical Template.




         17.3.4.4.1. Draw the relative position of each critical obstacle on the template and
         annotate its distance-to-go, distance abeam final course centerline, and height (AGL
         and MSL).
      17.3.4.5. Missed Approach and Departure. For planning, allow a minimum of 0.3 NM
      along track error and 0.3 NM cross track error at the MAP. Assume IMC when choosing
      the missed approach/departure flight path. Construct a horizontal obstacle clearance
      template beginning at the MAP and incorporating the planned missed approach/departure
      flight path. Use TDZE as the MSL start point for the missed approach. If the terrain
      along this flight path (including the above errors) rises at a rate greater than 200 ft/NM,
      refer to the performance manual to verify that three-engine climb-out will clear terrain.
      Use the three-engine climb angle in place of glide slope (refer to formula below). Angle
      of Climb = Rate of Climb (ft/min) x 0.5652/groundspeed (knots)
      17.3.4.6. The horizontal obstacle clearance template for climb-out extends from the
      approach end of the runway out to 1.0 NM past level off at the initial escape en route
      altitude. The lateral limits of the climb-out template are the same as for the straight-in
      approach.

          17.3.4.6.1. If any critical obstacles are identified, consider using turns during climb
          out to avoid them. Ensure that the three-engine climb path provides sufficient
          clearance from obstacles and terrain along the flight path.
17.4. Airdrop Planning. Airdrops may be conducted in IMC and VMC. For detailed
information on drop zone (DZ) sizes, markings, types, and weather and wind limits, refer to AFI
13217. For information on aerial delivery airspeeds and altitudes, refer to AFI 11231. AFI
13217 wind limits take precedence if there are discrepancies between AFI 13217 and AFI 11231.
   17.4.1. The PIC and the navigator(s) will review the DZ survey during mission
   planning/route study.
   17.4.2. Only equipment rigged in accordance with T.O. 13C7-series and FM 10-500-series
   or USSOCOM 350-series rigging manuals, properly marked with accurate weights and
   shipper‘s declarations will be airdropped. Nonstandard equipment and loads require specific
   instructions and waivers from AFSOC/A3V (AFRC/A3V for AFRC approved missions) and
   AFSOC/A3TW prior to airdrop.
   17.4.3. Minimum en route time from takeoff to time over release point will be sufficient to
   safely accomplish all required checklists. For airdrop involving personnel, the jumpmaster
   must approve en route time of less than 25 minutes.
   17.4.4. Jumpmaster directed (JMD) personnel airdrops require unit/mission commander
   approval (Special Operations Group (SOG)/CC may delegate lower). The user accepts all
   responsibility for airdrop accuracy and damage to equipment or injury to personnel.
       17.4.4.1. Specific in-flight visual signals, verbal signals, and interphone procedures will
       be coordinated between the jumpmaster and crew.
       17.4.4.2. Navigators will accomplish a computed air release point (CARP) or high
       altitude release point (HARP) calculation to verify the jumpmaster‘s computations and
       in-flight directions.
       17.4.4.3. Navigators will update the jumpmaster in-flight on actual wind information and
       any changes to the briefed computed CARP/HARP location.
       17.4.4.4. After the slowdown checks are completed, the loadmaster permits the
       jumpmaster access to the door to begin spotting procedures. The slowdown should be
       adjusted to allow the jumpmaster to begin spotting procedures not less than two minutes
       out. The jumpmaster will visually relay steering signals to the loadmaster to relay to the
       pilot. The jumpmaster may spot from the aircraft ramp or a paratroop door.
       17.4.4.5. One minute prior to the navigator‘s release point (or as briefed), the pilot
       monitoring turns on the green light to indicate clearance for the jumpmaster to make a
       final decision as to the exact exit point. Jumpers may exit on the jumpmaster‘s direction
       while the green light is illuminated. The red light is turned on at the end of the
       navigator‘s computed usable DZ distance and time or when the last jumper or load exits,
       whichever comes first. No jumpers should exit after the red light is turned on. NOTE:
       The LM will not attempt to stop any remaining parachutists after the red light has been
       illuminated. The LM will count any parachutists that exit the aircraft after the red light
       has illuminated.
AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011                                                             117


      17.4.4.6. JMD releases will not be mixed with any other type of airdrop method. If JMD
      drop procedures are called for, the crew will follow the jumpmaster‘s instructions, while
      adhering to normal safety concerns. Should the crew believe the drop would occur
      outside of safe parameters, they will call "No Drop" and ensure the red light is
      illuminated.
   17.4.5. Crews will not perform airdrops using parachutes for which AFI 11231 does not list
   ballistics unless the user provides ballistic data or K-factor that has been verified by
   AFSOC/A3TW. Aeronautical Systems Division (ASD/ENFC), or U.S. Army Soldier‘s
   System Center Natick can also approve ballistic data or K-factors. This does not apply to
   formal test missions where the purpose of the test is to derive ballistic data for a specific
   load.
17.5. Preparation for NVG Operations. Additional equipment and actions are necessary to
prepare the aircraft and crew members for NVG operations. The minimum aircraft equipment
requirements and aircrew responsibilities are as follows:
   17.5.1. Aircrew Equipment. The PIC will ensure there is one spare set of pre-flighted NVGs
   for the flight deck crew members. Crew members will carry IR-filtered flashlights, finger
   lights, lip lights, or chem lights, as required.
   17.5.2. Aircraft NVG Kit. At a minimum, this kit will include aircraft blackout and eyebrow
   curtains, porthole covers for the cargo compartment, and chem lights for use in marking
   emergency exit handles. Aircraft are normally configured for NVG operations prior to
   departure.
17.6. Low-level Procedures.
   17.6.1. In-flight Use of Laptop Computers. EMI Certified laptop computers and software,
   such as PFPS or Falconview are allowed in-flight IAW AFI 11202V3, and use is highly
   encouraged. Depending on aircraft modification, these laptops can receive positional data
   from a portable GPS system with external/window mounted antenna or from the navigational
   system data bus. If used properly, these systems enhance situational awareness (e.g.,
   "Moving Map", Falconview, Task View, Threat Overlays, Intel Feeds, etc.) and provide an
   ability to re-plan missions in-flight. These systems do not replace existing navigation
   equipment, will not be used as the sole means of navigation, and must not interfere with the
   accomplishment of normal duties.
   17.6.2. Climb to MSA (segmented authorized) or 500 SCP/detent, when either pilot leaves
   the seat during low-level flight.
   17.6.3. Obstacle clearance speeds (0 and 50%) will be posted for all low-level flights and
   updated hourly or after significant changes in aircraft gross weight.
   17.6.4. The radar altimeter will be set to no lower than 10% below the planned en route
   altitude for low-level operations. (For example, the radar altimeter will not be set below 450
   ft when flying 500 ft NVG contour.) The pilot and navigator will use the same setting for
   their radar altimeters. EXCEPTION: When authorized per MDS T.O. checklists.
   17.6.5. Radar Altimeter Low Lights. Any crew member noting illumination of the low
   warning light on the radar altimeter will call ―Low‖ to indicate this to the PF. WARNING:
   Lack of immediate action could result in controlled flight into terrain (CFIT). WARNING:
 118                                                 AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011


   The radar altimeter may indicate a higher altitude than the aircraft's actual clearance
   overwater, due to energy reflected from beneath the water surface. NOTE: Regardless of
   the radar altimeter setting you use, if you are below the desired modified contour altitude, a
   correction to altitude should be made. Do not wait for the low light to illuminate to begin a
   correction. This is especially important when using the lower limit on the radar altimeter.
17.7. Low-level Emergency Procedures.
   17.7.1. Crew Disorientation. Threat permitting, when a crew becomes disoriented on a low-
   level mission, start a climb to ESA. Continue the climb until the ESA is reached or a positive
   fix is obtained. After obtaining a positive fix, descend and resume low-level operations. The
   navigator(s)/EWOs will cross-check timing and adjust as necessary.
   17.7.2. Spatial Disorientation. The pilot monitoring will be ready to immediately take
   control of the aircraft if the flying pilot experiences spatial disorientation or a NVG
   malfunction. In either event, start a climb to at least MSA until the pilot experiencing the
   problem is ready to assume pilot monitoring duties.
   17.7.3. Inoperative NVGs . During an NVG takeoff or landing, the pilot monitoring must
   react quickly to assume control and execute the appropriate action, regardless of qualification
   or pilot position. The crew must be ready to turn on overt landing and taxi lights to assist in
   the maneuver.
   17.7.4. Aircraft System Failure. Begin a climb to MSA when a known or suspected
   malfunction prevents continued safe low-level operations.
   17.7.5. Emergency Climb. The procedure should be considered in cases of, but not limited
   to: certain equipment malfunctions, spatial disorientation, inadvertent weather penetration,
   aircraft altitude and/or airspeed is critically low, and/or loss of situational awareness during
   low-level operations. Any crew member may initiate this procedure and emergency climb
   execution should be as soon as possible.

Table 17.1. Emergency Climb Procedure.
 1. Announce ―Emergency Climb‖ to the crew over interphone.
 2. Set maximum power on all operating engines and close all bleed air valve switches.

                                           WARNING:
 Power settings greater than 19,600 in-lbs of torque may be required to clear an obstacle.
                                           CAUTION:
 Closing the bleed valves will result in depressurizing the aircraft. Use caution in areas of high
 terrain as cabin altitude may exceed 11-202V3 oxygen requirements and the onset of hypoxia
 symptoms may complicate judgment.
                                           CAUTION:
 Closing the bleed valves may result in decreased equipment cooling and may degrade critical
 component operation.
 3. If initiating a climb at speeds greater than flaps up obstacle clearance speed (~140kts)
AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011                                                                 119


 climb at flaps up obstacle clearance speed. If initiating a climb at speeds below flaps up
 obstacle clearance speed, set flaps to 50% and climb at 50% flap obstacle clearance speed.
                                           WARNING:
 0% flap obstacle clearance speed provides the best angle of continuous climb. However, when
 obstacles are a factor and the aircraft begins the maneuver at speeds less than 0% flaps
 obstacle clearance speed, crews should not delay initiating a climb attempting to accelerate to
 0% flaps obstacle clearance speed, in these cases it is appropriate to use 50% flap obstacle
 clearance speed.
 4. Ensure temperature datum valve switches are in auto (unless malfunction prevents
 compliance).
 5. Close ramp and door (if open).
 6. Turn away (with consideration for stall margin) from terrain if feasible. If not possible,
 climb straight ahead for the maximum climb angle.
                                           WARNING:
 If at flaps up obstacle clearance speed and turning is required, additional flaps may be
 necessary to avoid an accelerated stall. To prevent a stall, do not slow below obstacle
 clearance speed. A low altitude stall has a high probability of resulting in a crash and loss of
 life.
                                              NOTE:
 A wings level climb will result in the maximum angle/rate of climb. Any bank angle during
 this procedure will result in a lower than possible climb gradient and increases stall speed.
 7. The pilot monitoring will monitor and call airspeed as appropriate.
 8. The navigator/EWO will state an MSA, monitor terrain (via radar, chart, etc.) and call
 ―Clear of Terrain‖ when above all critical terrain.
 9. When clear of all terrain, adjust pitch, power, and airspeed for a normal climb out and level
 off and return all switches to their normal position.
 WARNING: If impact with terrain is imminent, use 100% flaps, gear up, 10 knots above
 power off stall speed and crash the aircraft straight ahead.
17.8. Defensive Maneuvers and Equipment.
   17.8.1. Practice Combat Maneuvers. All crew members will be prebriefed and advised of
   the time period/portion of the flight when practice threat maneuvers will be executed. Crew
   coordination is essential in avoiding injury to crew members during practice threat
   maneuvers.
   17.8.2. Expendables/ECM Training. Conduct all expendables training IAW CJCSM
   3212.02, AFI 11214, AFI 10706, Electronic Warfare (EW) Operations, AFI 13212, Range
   Planning and Operations, and applicable host nation directives. Dispense only when
   approved by the controlling agency IAW agency procedures and restrictions. When over
   open water, do not drop expendables below 500 ft AGL or within 3 NM of any surface
   vessel, platform, or landmass. Operational electronic attack (EA) software can only be used
 120                                                AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011


   for training missions in CONUS, but only after the signal collection risk has been evaluated
   (see CJCSM 3212.02 OPSEC considerations).
17.9. Airdrop Communications Procedures. During airdrop, after acknowledgement of the
20-minute warning and donning of the helmet, loadmasters may clear off interphone, with the
PIC‘s approval, to facilitate movement around large platforms or CDS loads. The pilot flying
the airdrop will accomplish the brief associated with the 20-minute warning. After completing
the required 20-minute checklist items, the primary loadmaster will remain on interphone
throughout the remainder of the airdrop.
   17.9.1. Training Operations. Radio transmissions with the DZ are those required for safety
   of flight considerations or factors effecting airborne force employment. This includes ATC
   directions, range clearance, unsafe surface conditions or mission changes. When the mission
   dictates radio silence, transmission of wind information and range or drop clearance is not
   required. Radio silence procedures will be coordinated prior to mission execution.
   17.9.2. Drop clearance is normally inherent with mission clearance to unmanned DZs. The
   aircrew observing the proper briefed authentication confirms drop clearance in VMC. A no-
   drop or mission cancellation is communicated by the absence of pre-briefed markings (visual
   or electronic), jumbled block letter, observation of the block letter X, or red smoke, light, or
   flare.
   17.9.3. In IMC, drop clearance is confirmed via radio call or beacon acquisition. In IMC, a
   no-drop or mission cancellation is communicated by an authenticated radio transmission or
   absence of the beacon.
17.10. Ramp and Door and Paratroop Door Operations. WARNING: The ramp and door
and paratroop doors will not be open at the same time during flight.
   17.10.1. Do not open the ramp and door to accomplish SATB/simulated airdrops with loads
   rigged with an extraction parachute in the bomb rack or HSLLADS sling attached. If the
   actual airdrop loads cannot be dropped, the extraction parachute will be removed from the
   bomb rack and secured forward of the load and HSLLADS slings will be disconnected.
   17.10.2. The pilot may direct ramp and door/paratroop door opening any time after the six-
   minute advisory has been completed for personnel drops or six minutes prior to the time over
   target (TOT) for non-personnel drops and clearance from the loadmaster is received. This
   option must be planned and briefed prior to execution. After opening, the loadmasters are
   cleared to complete their slowdown and three-minute checklist. Consider added drag, power
   available, climb requirements, built up areas, and the possibility of dropped objects when the
   door is opened.
   17.10.3. Tailgate drops are when parachutists are dropped utilizing the cargo ramp and door.
   Use only one anchor cable for personnel static lines per pass to a maximum of 20. Static
   lines for equipment will be attached to opposite anchor cables and must be rigged for
   breakaway. Exception: When airdrop loads are rigged with pilot chutes packed in T-10
   bags, they will be attached to the same anchor cable as personnel and are included in the 20
   maximum limit. Static lines will be retrieved after each pass.
   17.10.4. Multiple Passes (i.e., Racetracks). When performing multiple equipment airdrops
   across the same DZ, all airdrop checklists will be accomplished. When performing multiple
AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011                                                                   121


   personnel drops across the same DZ, checklists may resume at the 6-minute warning
   assuming no airdrop parameters or aircraft configuration changes are made from the previous
   drop. Ensure the loadmaster has adequate time to complete all checklist items before the
   drop. EXCEPTION: During pilot directed airdrops, the checklist may be initiated at a point
   commensurate with the available time and type of drop. This will be coordinated at the
   briefing between the crew and jumpmaster. When airdrop parameters or aircraft
   configuration changes are made between drops, all checklists will be accomplished. Airdrop
   time advisories and checklists may be compressed, except for the one minute warning.
   Doors may remain open at the discretion of the PIC.
   17.10.5. If an air deflector door cannot be opened, its respective paratroop door will not be
   used.
   17.10.6. Combination drops are when parachutists exit from the ramp and door in
   conjunction with an airdrop load. The item requiring the highest altitude will determine the
   drop altitude. In addition to the equipment CARP, the navigator will compute a personnel
   CARP down track from the equipment release point using the computed exit time for the
   equipment drop as the interval between the equipment and personnel CARP. Use the same
   airspeed and altitude as for the equipment for this computation. If the computed release point
   will result in any jumper landing within 150 yards of any boundary of the DZ, inform the
   jumpmaster. Release the equipment at the equipment CARP, followed by the parachutists
   when the door is clear.
   17.10.7. Airspeed will not be increased above 140 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS)/KCAS
   until static lines are retrieved. Under normal conditions, static lines that cannot be retrieved
   manually, will be retrieved utilizing the static line retriever. If the static line retriever fails,
   static lines will be manually retrieved using procedures outlined in AFTTP. During combat,
   static lines that cannot be retrieved will be cut so doors can be closed
17.11. Low Altitude Airdrop Procedures. All equipment planned to be airdropped will be
rigged in accordance with T.O. 13C7-series, T.O. 1C130A9, FM 10-500, and USSOCOM 350-
series directives and aircraft configurations will be IAW T.O. 1C130A9.
   17.11.1. Personnel.
       17.11.1.1. The loadmaster will ensure the configuration of the anchor cables and seats
       are consistent with the number of personnel to be airdropped. Floor loading is authorized
       in accordance AFTTP 3.3-MC130. During aircraft preflight, the loadmaster will ensure
       that all seats have a serviceable retaining strap attached. Fit seats without a serviceable
       retaining strap with a suitable length of type III nylon, premeasured for sufficient length
       to secure the seat in a raised position to the seat back support frame. For single pass
       drops, ensure that parachutists have secured all seats (as required) and no part of the seat
       protrudes into the aisle. On multiple passes, the number of parachutists to be dropped on
       that pass determines the number of seats raised. Troop seats will be raised and secured,
       or lowered, as required, by personnel under the supervision and instruction of the
       loadmaster.
       17.11.1.2. When an aircraft emergency occurs during or after the time the parachutists
       stand and hookup, the following procedures will apply:
122                                               AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011


         17.11.1.2.1. Under acceptable conditions when parachutists bailout is required,
         maintain an acceptable altitude and attitude for the parachutists to evacuate the
         aircraft. The minimum acceptable altitude is as briefed due to the differences in
         parachute employment limitations. If the jump airspeed will be in excess of 150
         KIAS/KCAS, advise the parachutists of the airspeed and altitude. Order evacuation
         of the aircraft by giving the pre-briefed bailout emergency signals.
         17.11.1.2.2. When conditions are not acceptable for parachutist bailout or a drop is
         aborted for other reasons, the following procedures apply:
             17.11.1.2.2.1. The red light will be turned on and will remain on until exit doors
             are closed.
             17.11.1.2.2.2. The pilot will advise the loadmaster, who in turn will advise the
             jumpmaster to have the parachutists unhook, take their seats, and fasten safety
             belts.
  17.11.2. Container Delivery System (CDS). CDS is designed to airdrop A-22/A-23, A-7,
  A-21, double A-22/A-23 containers and loads rigged on combat expendable platforms. The
  weight of each container and type parachute used should be IAW T.O. 13C7-1-11/FM 10-
  501 and SOCOM 350-series rigging manuals.
      17.11.2.1. CDS rigging procedures. Utilize rigging procedures outlined in T.O.
      1C130A9. The following describes the types of CDS releases that may be used on
      AFSOC MC/C130 aircraft.
         17.11.2.1.1. Normal System Release. A normal system release utilizes the static line
         retriever and guillotine knife to cut/release the CDS gate. When using this method,
         the loadmaster may assist the release by pulling down sharply on the static line
         retriever winch cable.
         17.11.2.1.2. Manual Gate Cut. A manual gate cut is defined as using a knife or V
         blade type knife to cut/release the CDS gate for all single stick container loads.
         Loads rigged with type VIII/XXVI nylon not exceeding 5,000 may be manually cut
         using these procedures.
         17.11.2.1.3. Manual Combat Cut. A manual combat cut is defined as using a knife or
         V blade type knife to cut the CDS gate regardless of amount, weight, and
         configuration of CDS on board. It is used only when authorized as part of specific
         exercise operations order or plan, contingencies, or by COMAFSOF.
      17.11.2.2. When Manual Gate Cut is used, navigators will subtract 1.7 seconds from the
      parachute and load location exit time listed in AFI 11231. This procedure is similar to
      the container release system CARP, which subtracts the time required for the static line
      retriever to actuate and cut the CDS gate. The navigator will state ―Red Light‖ if the
      loadmaster fails to state ―Gate Release‖ within 3 seconds. WARNING: The aircraft
      tends to pitch up as the load exits the aircraft. This pitch must be anticipated and
      controlled to allow no more than 2 or 3 degrees additional pitch. Do not over control to
      the point that negative g-forces are encountered.
      17.11.2.3. The flaps should be set to 50% as soon as the loadmaster calls "Load Clear."
  17.11.3. Combat Rubber Raiding Craft (CRRC) Drop.
AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011                                                          123


     17.11.3.1. CRRCs may be dropped in a stacked configuration allowing up to four
     CRRCs to be dropped on a single pass. One CRRC platform can be dropped using the
     standard CDS or CRS checklist. When two CRRC platforms are dropped on a single
     pass, use the CDS checklist. Two CRRC platforms with up to 18 personnel or one CRRC
     platform with up to 19 personnel can be airdropped on one pass. Rigged IAW T.O.13C7-
     51-21. If aircraft gross weight exceeds 120,000 pounds, perform the airdrop at 140 KIAS
     using the 140 KIAS flap setting chart. EXCEPTION: For combination drops above
     120,000 pounds, perform the airdrop at 130 KIAS using the 130 KIAS flap setting chart.
     17.11.3.2. For training and exercises, one or more recovery boats will be in position to
     recover platforms, parachutes, and personnel. The boat should be coordinated to be
     displaced 400 yards or more from the DZ axis.
  17.11.4. Rigging Alternate Method Zodiac (RAMZ). The RAMZ consists of a deflated
  Zodiac F470 combat rubber raiding craft. The RAMZ engine is configured in a plywood box
  and secured in a standard A-22 container using two T-10 parachutes. When rigged, the
  RAMZ package weighs between 600 and 1,000 pounds.
     17.11.4.1. For training and exercises, one or more recovery boats will be in position to
     recover platforms, parachutes, and personnel. The boat should be displaced 400 yards or
     more from the DZ axis.
     17.11.4.2. The package is dropped using normal CDS combination procedures or
     Container Ramp Load procedures.
     17.11.4.3. Checklist items up to and including the six-minute advisory may be
     accomplished prior to identifying the target.
     17.11.4.4. The anchor cable stop will be rigged at FS 749 for RAMZ followed by
     military free-fall (MFF) jumpers. Static lines will be immediately retrieved prior to
     jumpers exiting the aircraft. Static line jumpers will exit immediately after the load
     release.
     17.11.4.5. The flaps should be set to 50% as soon as the loadmaster calls "Load Clear."
  17.11.5. Heavy Equipment (HE). Only equipment rigged in accordance with T.O. 13C7 and
  FM 10-500 series or USSOCOM 350-series rigging manuals will be airdropped.
  Nonstandard equipment and loads require specific instructions and waivers from
  AFSOC/A3V
  17.11.6. Door Bundle.
     17.11.6.1. A7A or A-21 containers weighing up to 500 pounds (excluding the weight of
     the parachute) that are dropped through the paratroop door or ramp and door using the
     personnel airdrop checklist. Door bundles may be dropped independently or in
     conjunction with personnel. A Joint airdrop inspection (JAI) is not required for door
     bundles..
     17.11.6.2. Paratroop Door. Door bundle drops are limited to one bundle per paratroop
     door. When dropped with personnel, the bundle will be the first object to exit the
     aircraft, and rigged non-breakaway. The maximum bundle size for paratroop door loads
     is 66‖ (height) x 48‖ (width) x 30‖ (length) or as specified in specific rigging manual.
 124                                               AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011


       17.11.6.3. Ramp and Door. Door bundles dropped off the ramp and door, followed by
       personnel, will be equipped with breakaway static lines in accordance with T.O. 13C7-1-
       11 or with parachutes packed in T-10 bags. Door bundles dropped from the ramp and
       door that exceed the weight or dimensions specified above will be equipped with a skid
       board compatible with the intermediate roller conveyors. When dropped with personnel,
       the bundle will be the first object to exit the aircraft.
   17.11.7. Container Ramp Load (CRL). CRL will be rigged in accordance with T.O. 13C7-1-
   11, FM 10-500, and USSOCOM 350-series directives. Skid boards/combat expendable
   platforms will be compatible with intermediate roller conveyors. The total rigged weight of
   the load will not exceed 2,335 pounds. The loads will be released by the loadmaster and may
   be followed by parachutists. These procedures can be accomplished from either side of the
   cargo ramp or from centerline. Specific aircraft preparations and rigging procedures are
   contained in T.O. 1C130A9.
       17.11.7.1. When CRL bundles are dropped with personnel, compute a personnel CARP.
       Compute an additional CARP for the CRL and plot the vectors from the personnel release
       point to ensure it will impact within the DZ boundaries. Release the CRL bundle at the
       personnel CARP, followed by the parachutists when the door is clear. An alternate
       procedure is to add the exit time of the CRL bundle to the personnel CARP and release
       the bundle at this point, followed by the jumpers. If this method is used, the crew must
       coordinate with the user to ensure the load lands at the desired location. When a CRL
       bundle is the only object being dropped, base the release on the CARP for the bundle.
   17.11.8. Container Release System (CRS).
       17.11.8.1. The CRS is employed to airdrop "A" series containers, HSLLADS containers,
       CRRC, and the AKHIO sled by MC130E/H/W aircraft. A total weight of 6,667 pounds
       may be airdropped per pass. Combination airdrops are authorized when dropping CRS,
       personnel follow the containers after the time interval required to confirm the pilot or
       cargo parachute has deployed properly (approximately 2 to 4 seconds after load exit).
       Aircraft attitude and aircrew procedures are similar to those for CDS delivery. The flap
       setting will be computed using the CDS/CRS flap setting chart.
       17.11.8.2. The flaps should be set to 50% as soon as the loadmaster calls "Load Clear."
   17.11.9. High-speed Low-level Aerial Delivery System (HSLLADS) Drop. Up to four
   containers may be dropped on one pass, providing the total weight does not exceed 2,200
   pounds.
   17.11.10. Free-Fall Delivery System. Free-fall airdrop is the delivery of non-fragile items
   without parachutes at very low altitudes (as low as 100 ft AGL). Use the HSLLADS,
   personnel, or CDS checklists or appropriate checklist depending on flap setting and deck
   angle desired. Additional crew members may be needed to eject the load.
   17.11.11. Standard Airdrop Training Bundle (SATB). Conduct SATB drops at the altitude
   and airspeed specified for the type of drop being simulated and use the applicable tactical
   airdrop checklist.
17.12. High Altitude Airdrop Procedures.
AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011                                                            125


   17.12.1. Airdrops conducted above 3,000 ft AGL are considered high altitude drops. For
   HALO, positive identification of the drop zone area must be confirmed electronically or
   visually prior to calling the release. For HALO or HAHO, all available navigational aids will
   be used to assist in positioning the aircraft over the HARP.
      17.12.1.1. To the maximum extent possible on training and exercise missions, unless
      prevented by airspace restrictions or other mission factors, update the preflight winds at
      each altitude used to compute the HARP. Obtain these winds as near the DZ as possible.
   17.12.2. High Altitude Mission Requirements. In addition to the normal mission planning
   requirements, the following are unique to high altitude operations:
      17.12.2.1. Aircrew will ensure all aspects of HALO/HAHO airdrops are discussed in
      detail at the aircrew/jumpmaster briefing. Insist on positive feedback when discussing
      HARP location and wind data as well as resolving what items will be passed to the
      jumpmaster during flight. Terminology should be clear and unambiguous.
      17.12.2.2. For all HALO/HAHO operations, navigators will provide the jumpmaster with
      a magnetic course +/- 5 degrees and a distance from the release point to the drop zone.
      In-flight changes to the HARP location or significant wind changes will be relayed to the
      jumpmaster as soon as possible.
   17.12.3. Cabin differential pressure will be managed to have cabin altitude equal to the
   ambient pressure prior to completion of the 10-minute checklist. Depressurization will not
   exceed 3,000 ft per minute. Pressurization after the drop will be maintained in accordance
   with mission requirements, but should return to a cabin altitude commensurate to the flight
   profile and duration as detailed in AFI 11202V3 or below 10,000 ft MSL as soon as possible.
   17.12.4. High Altitude Oxygen requirements.         Only essential personnel who have
   accomplished appropriate physiological training described in AFI 11403, Aerospace
   Physiological Training Program are permitted on mission aircraft for airdrops. AFI
   11202V3 General Flight Rules is the source document for oxygen requirements for
   unpressurized and pressurized aircraft operations and the associated time limitations. AFI
   11409, High Altitude Airdrop Mission Support Program, is the source document for high
   altitude oxygen, prebreathing, and Physiology Technician (PT) requirements/restrictions.
      17.12.4.1. Incident Notification. USAF/SGPA and MAJCOM/SG will be notified by the
      most expeditious manner of any physiological incident.
      17.12.4.2. General Emergency Procedures. If any person experiences decompression
      sickness or unusual pain, the pilot will:
          17.12.4.2.1. Abort the mission and begin a descent (pressurization and descent will
          be determined by the type and degree of sickness or pain).
          17.12.4.2.2. Proceed to the nearest base at which qualified medical assistance is
          available. Advise the control tower of the emergency and request a flight surgeon
          and an ambulance to meet the aircraft.
17.13. Joint Precision Airdrop System (JPADS) Procedures.
   17.13.1. The term JPADS refers to GPS-guided equipment, I-CDS and MFF airdrops that
   utilize the JPADS Mission Planner (JPADS-MP) system.
126                                               AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011


  17.13.2. JPADS Restrictions. Wind data derived from the JPADS four dimensional wind
  model is suitable for mission use, but the JPADS-MP does not calculate MFF high altitude
  release points (HARP) correctly. AFSOC crews will not use JPADS-MP as the sole source
  for personnel MFF HARP calculations until authorized. Aircrews will use sound judgment
  and evaluate the dropsonde derived winds, forecasted winds and preflight HARP location
  before conducting MFF operations.
  17.13.3. JPADS certified aircrews are authorized to use the JPADS-MP laptop and software
  (a stand-alone system) to calculate release points for JPADS operations.
      17.13.3.1. MFF airdrops only, aircrews can input dropsonde collected winds into
      onboard airdrop systems, utilize the Air Force Weather Agency forecast/model during
      mission planning, and incorporate dropsonde collected winds when calculating HARP in
      AFSOC approved airdrop planning software for personnel.
      17.13.3.2. (MC130H) Navigators may enter dropsonde collected winds into the
      wind/temperature summary layer for use in HARP calculation. NOTE: JPADS winds
      are collected in magnetic or true so winds may require conversion to true before entry
      into mission computers.
  17.13.4. JPADS certified crews are authorized JPADS airdrop operations in VMC and IMC
  above 3,000 ft AGL without the use of a Radar Beacon or Ground Radar Aerial Delivery
  System (GRADS).
  17.13.5. Drop zone size criteria during contingency operations are at the discretion of the
  user. Ultimately, the user accepts responsibility for the accuracy and the condition of these
  airdrop loads.
  17.13.6. The planned release point for actual JPADS training airdrops must be executed
  within the lateral and vertical limits of a restricted area.
  17.13.7. During the dropsonde release, use of zero flaps at speeds between 170 – 180 KIAS
  is required to preclude dropsonde tail strikes. Loadmasters should release the dropsondes
  from the corners of the cargo ramp.
  17.13.8. Wind Limits. Wind limitations are unrestricted for dropsonde operations, 18 knots
  for Firefly, Screamer, and Dragonfly and as published for all other parachutes.
  17.13.9. Altitude Restrictions
  17.13.9.1. I-CDS/JPADS: Maximum altitude 25,000 ft MSL.
      17.13.9.2. SCREAMER minimum drop altitude is 8,000 ft AGL.
      17.13.9.3. FIREFLY minimum drop altitude is 3,500 ft AGL.
      17.13.9.4. Dropsonde minimum drop altitude is 3,000 ft AGL.
  17.13.10. Dropsonde. For all training drops the dropsonde will be planned to land in the
  intended impact/drop area using the release point determined by the JPADS-MP. Navigators
  will program the planned release point into the mission computer as a normal (non-drop) leg.
  Aircraft position will be confirmed either by GPS with a figure-or-merit (FOM) of 3 or better
  or via aircraft sensor updates.
AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011                                                             127


   17.13.11. Equipment Drops. Navigators will program the planned release point into the
   mission computer as a normal (non-drop) leg. Aircraft position will be confirmed either by
   GPS with a FOM of 3 or better or via aircraft sensor updates. For non-GPS guided drops
   navigators will validate the JPADS-MP release point via normal CARP/HARP procedures.
17.14. Low Cost Aerial Delivery System (LCADS): The Low Cost Aerial Delivery System is
a one-time use, stand-alone airdrop system consisting of a modular suite of low cost airdrop
items comprised of parachutes, containers, platforms, and other air items configured for low-
velocity, high-velocity, and free-fall aerial delivery.
   17.14.1. Low Cost Aerial Delivery System-Low Velocity (LCADS-LV).
       17.14.1.1. LCADS-LV Ballistics. LCADS-LV will be dropped using the ballistics IAW
       AFI 11231 or published ATTLA memorandum. Exit times will be IAW AFI 11231
       Table 9.19.
       17.14.1.2. Drop Zone Size. The drop zone size will be IAW AFI 13217. The minimum
       reliable drop altitude is 1,000 ft AGL (drops below 800 ft AGL pose a significant risk of
       failure or damage). The maximum drop altitude is 13,000 ft MSL (drops above 10,000 ft
       MSL are restricted to a maximum of 1,700 pounds suspended weight).
       17.14.1.3. Rigging. Breakaway static lines will be used regardless of altitude. The static
       line break tie will be full strength type III nylon (550) cord for all LCADS-LV
       parachutes. NOTE: Use of gutted type III nylon (550) cord will result in chute
       deployment failure. Joint airdrop inspectors will ensure proper static line configuration,
       including anti-oscillation ties.
   17.14.2. Low Cost Aerial Delivery System-High Velocity (LCADS-HV).
       17.14.2.1. LCADS-HV is not authorized for training use. LCADS-HV is authorized for
       contingency missions and developmental/operational test & evaluation (DT&E/OT&E)
       missions
       17.14.2.2. LCADS-HV Parachutes are factory-rigged in a breakaway static line
       configuration and must always be rigged for breakaway on the aircraft regardless of drop
       altitude. Failure to use breakaway will result in damage to the aircraft. The static line
       break tie will be gutted Type III nylon (550) cord for all LCADS-HV parachutes. Joint
       airdrop inspectors will be vigilant and ensure proper static line configuration, including
       anti-oscillation ties.
   17.14.3. Low Cost Low Altitude (LCLA).
       17.14.3.1. LCLA is one of the army's low cost airdrop systems. LCLA was designed to
       provide very low altitude aerial resupply using small fixed wing and rotary wing aircraft.
       17.14.3.2. LCLA parachutes are compatible with A-7A           and A-21 containers.
       Containers may be rigged with a single parachute or with clusters of up to three
       parachutes. LCLA parachutes will be rigged with non-breakaway static lines.
17.15. No Drop Decisions.
   17.15.1. Prior to the 1 (2 for HALO/HAHO)-minute warning; notify the PIC when any
   condition exists that could jeopardize a safe drop.
 128                                                  AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011


   17.15.2. After the 1 (2 for HALO/HAHO)-minute warning, any crew member observing a
   condition that would jeopardize a safe drop will transmit "No Drop" on the interphone.
   17.15.3. A ―No Drop‖ will be called if all checklists are not completed by the ―10 Second‖
   call.
   17.15.4. The pilot monitoring, navigator, and loadmaster will acknowledge the "No Drop"
   call. (For MC130E/H) The non-flying pilot or flight engineer, loadmaster, and the navigator
   will immediately configure their automatic airdrop switches/auto carp switch to prevent
   automatic release of the load.
   17.15.5. If a no drop is called after the load restraint is removed and a racetrack is not
   planned, reapply the load restraint.
   17.15.6. Stopping a drop in progress. Any crew member recognizing an unsafe condition
   during an airdrop will state "Red Light." The pilot monitoring will turn on the red light to
   signal airdrop termination.
   17.15.7. On personnel airdrops where surface winds are unknown, advise the jumpmaster
   and the airborne ground force commander when drop altitude winds exceed 30 knots. In this
   instance, the decision to drop is at the user's discretion.
   17.15.8. During training operations, the drop zone safety officer (DZSO) will determine
   when surface conditions on the DZ are hazardous to airdrop operations.
17.16. Airdrop Malfunction and Emergencies. Specific emergency procedures for each type
airdrop are located in the expanded checklist of the applicable flight manual or this instruction.
During air drop missions, crews will identify what checklists will be run, a salvo area, and a race
track option for an immediate re-attack. Prior to stations time, the pilot will ensure all crew
members have reviewed the emergency procedures for the proposed airdrop. The loadmasters
will conduct detailed emergency briefings. Loadmasters will brief visual and verbal signals and
establish coordinated tasks for their crew position prior to the combat entry point or initiation of
airdrop checklists, whichever occurs first.
   17.16.1. General Amplified Fouled/Towed Parachutists Procedures
       17.16.1.1. The jumpmaster/safety observer is responsible for watching the fouled-
       parachutist to determine how the parachutist is entangled. If being towed by anything
       other than the static line, the jumpmaster or safety will attempt to free the parachutist. If
       being towed by the static line, the jumpmaster/safety observer will recommend to the
       pilot, through the loadmaster, whether to retrieve or cut the parachutist free. If all
       parachutists have exited the aircraft, and there is no safety on board, this responsibility
       rests with the loadmaster. The pilot will make the final decision whether to retrieve or
       cut the parachutist free. The loadmaster will initiate retrieval or cut the parachutist‘s
       static line on the pilot‘s command. If the parachutist is fouled during a paratroop door
       exit, the first priority is to retrieve, whether the parachutist is conscious or unconscious.
       If the parachutist cannot be retrieved and indicates consciousness, the parachutist will be
       cut free. For a ramp exit, the first priority is to cut the parachutist free if the parachutist
       indicates consciousness. If the parachutist is unconscious, does not signal, cannot be
       observed, or a condition exists that prevents cutting the static line, implement emergency
       retrieval procedures. WARNING: There is not an effective or consistently reliable
AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011                                                              129


     means to manually retrieve a fouled parachutist from either the paratroop door or ramp
     and door. Manual retrieval techniques should be exercised with extreme caution. During
     training, while towing a fouled parachutist, the pilot will maintain at least the minimum
     drop altitude (AGL) for the type parachute being used and the mission employed, and not
     more than drop airspeed, unless a greater emergency exists. WARNING: If possible,
     avoid turning the aircraft in the direction of the fouled parachutist. Turning into the
     parachutist often starts violent swinging of the parachutist and poses an increased
     possibility of injury. The parachutist will indicate consciousness and that his reserve
     parachute is ready by maintaining a tight body position and with both hands on his
     reserve parachute or as briefed.
     17.16.1.2. There are three methods of retrieval for towed parachutists from the paratroop
     door. The primary method of retrieval is the Towed Paratrooper Retrieval System
     (TPRS). The secondary method of retrieval is the paratroop retrieval bar for aircraft
     equipped with this system. The third and last method is to rig a 5,000 lb. tie-down strap
     in the paratroop door prior to retrieval. The maximum allowable weight for a towed
     paratrooper, without the TPRS, for troop door exit is 250 pounds. The limit is 400
     pounds when utilizing the TPRS (Does not apply to combat or actual contingency
     missions). Jumpmasters are responsible for parachutist weight restrictions. Use of the
     retrieval assist strap (RAS) without the roller assembly, is authorized for retrieving static
     lines only. The RAS together with Roller Assembly will be used for retrieval of a towed
     parachutist.      WARNING: The maximum weight of parachutists dropped off the cargo
     ramp during training is 325 pounds. Jumpmasters are responsible for parachutist weight
     restrictions.
  17.16.2. CDS Emergency Procedures.
     17.16.2.1. When notified of a malfunction the PF will direct the FE to extend additional
     flaps and lower the nose to maintain a slight nose down attitude until the ramp and door
     are closed.
     17.16.2.2. PF will maintain drop airspeed and no lower than the drop altitude AGL (if
     possible) and avoid flying over or upwind of water or built up areas. Maintain a stable
     position until the LM can secure the load and close the ramp and door.
  17.16.3. CRRC Emergency Procedures. Use CRS/CDS airdrop emergency procedures.
  17.16.4. RAMZ Emergency Procedures. Follow either the CDS emergency procedures or
  fouled parachutist procedures.
  17.16.5. General Amplified Heavy Equipment Emergency Procedures
     17.16.5.1. When notified of a malfunction, the pilot will maintain drop airspeed and
     altitude (if possible) and turn toward the salvo area. Avoid overflight of built up areas to
     the maximum extent possible. The loadmaster will take the appropriate corrective
     actions and notify the pilot when complete. After completion of the malfunction
     checklist, perform the completion of drop checklist.       WARNING: Do not proceed aft
     of the platforms/load until it is properly restrained. Preposition emergency aft restraint
     chains and additional tie-down equipment forward of the airdrop load. Attach emergency
     restraint to the item that has the extraction force applied to it and remove all slack. Total
     required restraint will be in accordance with T.O. 1C130A9.
 130                                                 AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011


   17.16.6. SATB Emergency Procedures. If a training bundle is outside and fails to separate,
   make no attempt to retrieve it. Cut the bundle loose over the pre-briefed salvo area or DZ. If
   the bundle falls on the ramp, close the cargo ramp and door. Do not attempt to remove the
   bundle from the ramp prior to closing the ramp and door. When using the cargo ramp and
   door, a hung bundle could become wedged in the aircraft elevator during turns. If possible,
   cut the static line prior to making a turn.
17.17. GCAS Operations. (N/A C130E/H) During low-level operations and in the objective
area, without an active or operable TF system, GCAS will be operated in the tactical mode
(audio or visual).   WARNING: When the visual alert button is deselected there will NOT be
a visual ―LOW ALT‖ warning when the aircraft is below the radar altimeter‘s variable altitude
limit index (VALI) or low altitude bug.
17.18. ETCAS Operations. (N/A C130E/H) ETCAS may be operated in traffic advisory (TA)
only mode during formation, low-level, air refueling and helicopter/tilt rotor air refueling
operations or IAW aircraft T.O.
17.19. SCA Procedures.
   17.19.1. SCAs will be conducted IAW applicable T.O. guidance (INFIL/EXFIL checklist)
   and the MDS-specific procedures given in Chapters 18-22. All MDS-specific procedures
   will comply with the following:
       17.19.1.1. Radar Altimeter. All radar altimeters will be set to MDA prior to initiating
       the SCA descent unless specified otherwise in MDS employment chapter.
       17.19.1.2. Mandatory SCA calls.
          17.19.1.2.1. ―Begin Descent.‖ Announced to initiate descent on the SCA glidepath.
          Prior to making this call, the navigator will verify that actual aircraft position is inside
          the planned SCA obstacle template.
          17.19.1.2.2. ―100 Above.‖ Announced 100 ft above the MDA. NOTE: MC130P/W
          crews conducting IMC SCAs will not descend below the ―100 Above‖ altitude until
          the LZ environment is positively identified on the IDS (MC-130P) or M1/M2 sensor
          (MC-130W). This restriction is not applicable if the LZ environment has been
          visually identified and confirmed by both pilots.
          17.19.1.2.3. ―Minimums.‖ Announced at the MDA. Do not descend below the
          MDA until the LZ environment is visually identified.
          17.19.1.2.4. ―Go-around.‖ A go-around will be announced and initiated at the MAP
          if the LZ has not been visually acquired, a safe landing cannot be accomplished, or if
          directed.
          17.19.1.2.5. ―Immediate Landing Feasible.‖ If a go-around occurs and an immediate
          landing is feasible and desired, the PF will announce intentions and maneuver to a
          VFR pattern. NOTE: When performing IMC SCAs, the copilot normally flies the
          IMC portion of the SCA and the pilot assumes control for the VMC portion and
          landing. All units will ensure IMC SCA procedures are incorporated into
          continuation training.
17.20. Tanker Air-to-Air Refueling (HAAR/TAAR).
AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011                                                                131


   17.20.1. Minimum Altitudes. Minimum HAAR/TAAR altitude is 500 ft AGL. Low altitude
   HAAR/TAAR training below 1,000 ft AGL will not be conducted at tanker gross weights
   above 130,000 pounds or without three engine climb capability of at least 500 fpm. Select a
   refueling altitude based on the threat environment, not lower than 500 ft AGL without a
   waiver. In these cases, the receiver join-up altitude will be at least 300 ft below the refueling
   altitude for all receiver low procedures and at least 200 ft above the refueling altitude for all
   receiver high procedures. TAAR: Prior to positive identification, a minimum vertical
   separation of 500 ft will be maintained between tanker and receiver during all rendezvous.
   Once the receiver is positively identified, minimum vertical separation may be reduced to
   300 ft. A minimum vertical separation of 500 ft will be maintained when conducting
   rendezvous to another C130 aircraft simulating HAAR/TAAR. EXCEPTION: A minimum
   vertical separation of 1,000 ft will be maintained between tanker and receiver during tanker
   orbit rendezvous procedures for TAAR.
17.21. Formation Procedures. For detailed information on formation procedures, refer to
MDS-specific employment chapters.
   17.21.1. Ground operations. Minimum taxi interval is one aircraft length.
   17.21.2. Takeoff. Minimum takeoff interval is 15 seconds. For simultaneous departures,
   aircraft separation must be at least 3,000 ft between aircraft. Lead must have at least 3,500 ft
   of useable runway for takeoff. Minimum visibility for formation takeoff is 1 mile (RVR
   0500).
   17.21.3. Rejoins. Aircraft joining a formation en route will rejoin as briefed to en route
   position. Otherwise, notify lead and remain at least 500 ft above or below the formation until
   the formation is in sight and clearance to rejoin is granted.
   17.21.4. En Route Procedures.
      17.21.4.1. At night or in IMC, lead will announce unplanned airspeed changes of greater
      than 15 knots, unless briefed otherwise.
      17.21.4.2. Aircraft aborting after assembly will notify lead and turn away from
      formation. The aborted aircraft will either rejoin at the end of the formation or proceed to
      a suitable recovery field. Aircraft within a flight will reposition as briefed.
   17.21.5. Formation Objective Area Procedures.
      17.21.5.1. VMC. MC130 crews are authorized to conduct all high-speed and 50% flap
      airdrops in visual formation. Only 50% flap airdrops may be conducted in radar trail.
      Minimum spacing for visual formation airdrop is 2,000 ft (EXCEPTION: MCADS
      minimum spacing is 500 ft). Minimum spacing for reduced flap setting drops, i.e., CDS
      and CRS, is 6,000 ft between aircraft. Waiver authority for reduced airdrop spacing is
      the Group Commander or COMAFSOF.
      17.21.5.2. IMC.  Procedures for IMC objective area employment (airdrop,
      HAAR/TAAR, airland, etc.) are contained in each MDS-specific employment chapter.
   17.21.6. Landings. The desired landing interval is 20 seconds; minimum landing interval is
   15 seconds, but consider extending this interval for strong crosswinds, narrow/short runways,
   or other adverse conditions. For simultaneous landings, planned touchdown point separation
   will be 3,000 ft minimum (approximately 20 seconds for MC130H) using 100% flaps.
132                                                AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011


  Consider extending the landing interval for excessive wind conditions or wet/slippery
  runway conditions. A combination of simultaneous and minimum interval landings may be
  planned. Unless otherwise briefed, for other than simultaneous landings, bring throttles into
  the ground range at 3,000 ft remaining, brakes and reverse at 2,000 ft remaining. For
  simultaneous landings, followers will slow to a safe taxi speed prior to the preceding
  aircraft's touchdown point. Minimum spacing between simultaneous landing elements is 90
  seconds. Use 30 seconds minimum spacing for a minimum interval element following a
  simultaneous element. Touch and go landings out of formation recoveries are prohibited.
  Minimum visibility for formation landing is 1 mile (RVR 0500).
  17.21.7. Dissimilar Formations. All AFSOC C130 variants are authorized to fly formation
  with other AFSOC C130 aircraft when mission requirements dictate. 500 ft lateral separation
  is the minimum spacing for different MDS aircraft. For formation HAAR/TAAR, use
  geometries, positions and lost contact procedures described in ATP 56B, Air-to-Air
  Refueling, Part 3/4. For formation AAR use geometries and positions described in ATP 56B
  Parts 1 and 2.
  17.21.8. Command and Control. Clear lines of command must be planned prior to formation
  flight. Personnel in the following roles will be identified during mission planning and will be
  annotated on the flight orders (unless noted otherwise):
      17.21.8.1. Air Mission Commander (AMC) and Deputy Mission Commander (DMC).
      For AMC and DMC formation duties see paragraphs 2.9 and 2.10
         17.21.8.1.1. Formation Commander. Required on every formation mission. The
         designated commander of a formation of aircraft is responsible for the successful
         completion of the formation's portion of the mission and is chosen from the PICs,
         navigators, and CSOs involved in the mission. The formation commander works
         closely with the AMC (if one is utilized) to accomplish the overall mission, and is
         usually designated DMC on missions employing a dedicated AMC.
         17.21.8.1.2. Formation Lead. The lead aircraft in a formation flight is responsible for
         proper mission execution and other immediate action events during a formation flight.
  17.21.9. Dissimilar Formation Briefings. A face-to-face briefing between all involved crew
  members is highly desired. At a minimum, dissimilar formation briefings must be attended
  by all PICs and at least one navigator from each crew. When geographic separation between
  units precludes a face-to-face briefing, the AMC will coordinate directly with each PIC to
  ensure each crew receives all appropriate formation and mission information prior to their
  individual crew briefings. At a minimum, brief the following items:
      17.21.9.1. Communications.
      17.21.9.2. Air-to-Air TACAN assignments.
      17.21.9.3. Aircraft Lighting.
  17.21.10. Inadvertent Weather Penetration. Upon entering marginal VMC or IMC, the
  following procedures apply: WARNING: Inadvertent weather penetration procedures must
  be briefed. These procedures are designed for use from trail formation during straight and
  level flight with no more than 3 aircraft. It may be necessary to modify these procedures due
  to formation geometries, terrain, airspace restrictions, etc. Inadvertent weather penetration in
AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011                                                           133


  mountainous terrain may be extremely hazardous. Mission planners must devise and brief
  procedures that best suit the situation.        NOTE: Inadvertent weather penetration
  procedures are for emergency use and do not constitute authority to violate AFI 11-202V3 or
  Federal Aviation Regulations. Exercising these procedures under actual weather conditions
  is a violation subject to appropriate action by the Air Force and Federal Aviation
  Administration (FAA). Individual aircraft should maintain VFR if there is sufficient warning
  to take evasive action. Flight leads will take all practical measures to avoid entering
  controlled airspace without clearance.
     17.21.10.1. Wing aircraft immediately initiates a climbing turn as required for its
     position in the formation and gives "(Call Sign)‖ then ―IMC Break" three times over the
     primary interplane radio. The lead aircraft responds with call sign, heading and base
     altitude. Base altitude will be as follows: MSA, if position is within the MSA corridor;
     or ESA, if not. NOTE: During training and exercise operations, the IMC Break call
     will be made on a non-secure radio. Lead‘s response will be made on the same non-
     secure radio by the Navigator (unless briefed otherwise), and the response should be
     called twice to ensure all wingmen copied the heading and altitude.
     17.21.10.2. All aircraft turn navigation lights to bright and turn transponder modes 1 and
     3 to normal (if the threat environment allows).
     17.21.10.3. Lead aircraft sets TIT to 1,010 degrees C (if necessary) and climbs at 180
     KIAS/KCAS straight ahead until reaching base altitude or VMC conditions, whichever
     occurs first. Upon reaching this altitude, maintain 180 KIAS/KCAS.
     17.21.10.4. The #2 aircraft immediately turns right 10 degrees or more (if feasible), sets
     TIT at 1,010 C (if necessary), and climbs at 170 KIAS/KCAS to base altitude plus 500 ft
     or VMC conditions, whichever occurs first. After 30 seconds, resume original heading.
     Upon reaching altitude, maintain 180 KIAS/KCAS.
     17.21.10.5. The #3 aircraft immediately turns left 10 degrees or more (if feasible), sets
     TIT at 1,010 C (if necessary), and climbs at 160 KIAS/KCAS to base altitude plus 1,000
     ft or VMC conditions, whichever occurs first. After 30 seconds, resume original heading.
     Upon reaching altitude, maintain 180 KIAS/KCAS.
     17.21.10.6. If still IMC at completion of the maneuver, wingmen should immediately
     maneuver into Radar Trail and continue on track using radar and air-to-air TACAN to
     maintain position until VMC is encountered. Recommended position of aircraft is in trail
     at 1 mile spacing. If air-to-air TACAN is not operational, continuing with radar alone is
     permissible. NOTE: Lead may increase cruise airspeed after ensuring all aircraft have
     completed their climb. Accelerating helps keep the formation on time to its objective and
     makes transition to Radar Trail easier.
     17.21.10.7. If VMC conditions are reencountered and can be maintained, rejoin the
     formation visually after obtaining permission from Lead. WARNING: The direction of
     turn for IMC breaks is based on a ―no terrain‖ situation. Terrain, threats, or fluid trail
     position may dictate a direction of turn different from what your formation position calls
     for. Situational awareness is critical to terrain and threat avoidance when weather is
     inadvertently encountered.
134                                                AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011


  17.21.11. Preplanned Weather Penetration. These procedures enable weather penetration en
  route to a VMC objective area. They are designed to transition a formation from visual trail
  to Radar Trail prior to entering weather and permit continued formation flight in IMC. Using
  these procedures, it is possible to fly an IMC route segment at a pre-planned safe altitude
  while still maintaining formation integrity.
      17.21.11.1. On lead‘s signal, lead accelerates 20 KIAS/KCAS, #2 maintains en route
      airspeed, and #3 reduces speed 20 KIAS/KCAS. The formation maintains this airspeed
      differential for 3 minutes, then resumes en route airspeed. This should establish
      approximately 1 mile separation between aircraft.            On the same signal, lead
      maintains/climbs to base altitude, #2 climbs at 1,000 ft per minute to base altitude plus
      500, and #3 climbs at 1,000 ft per minute to base altitude plus 1,000 ft. Base altitude will
      be as follows: MSA, if position is within the MSA corridor; ESA if outside the corridor,
      or an appropriate en route altitude if outside the low-level environment. Depending on
      threat environment, altitudes may be amended (i.e., base plus 100 ft, base plus 200 ft).
      NOTE: Radar Trail requires the lead aircraft to report all heading, altitude, and airspeed
      changes on interplane radio when operating in a permissive environment or requires these
      changes be thoroughly preplanned and flown precisely when operating in a hostile,
      comm-out environment.

   18.2.1. Terrain Following Radar. A fully functional terrain following system is required for
   TF operations. This includes a source of pitch (INU or vertical gyro [VG]), a mission
   computer, a source of drift (INU or Doppler), and a source of angle of attack (AOA) (mission
   computer).
        18.2.1.1. The AN/APQ-122(V)8 precision ground mapping subsystem with a
        presentation available for the right navigator is required for TF operations in IMC. TF
        operations may be flown in VMC using the procedures outlined in 18.3.2.4.2
   18.2.2. Radar Altimeter. The TF subsystem of the AN/APQ-122(V)8 radar is the primary
   height reference during TF operations. Radar altimeters provide the secondary height
   reference. At least one radar altimeter and both copilot and navigator repeaters must be
   functional for all low-level operations. NOTE: An inoperative low-altitude light on the
   pilot, copilot, or navigator radar altimeter is considered a malfunction. Do not conduct TF or
   NVG operations with an inoperative radar altimeter low-altitude warning light.
   18.2.3. Engine Efficiency. All engines must be operating at a minimum of 98% efficiency
   for TF operations.
18.3. Terrain Following/Terrain Avoidance (TF/TA) Procedures.
   18.3.1. In-flight Crew Duties. The following duties apply while terrain following. The non-
   flying pilot will use NVGs to clear during all night low-level operations.
        18.3.1.1. Pilots:
           18.3.1.1.1. Follow pitch bar commands. WARNING: The AN/APQ-122(V)8 is
           designed for the pitch bar to be used as the primary source of TF pitch commands.
           Do not attempt to fly the E2 "grass" when the use of the pitch bar is denied unless
           positive terrain clearance can be visually verified.
           18.3.1.1.2. The non-flying pilot will monitor clearance in VMC and the pitch bar in
           IMC. Advise the navigators when flying from VMC to IMC and vice versa.
           18.3.1.1.3. Set the radar altimeter altitude clearance set markers at 70% of selected
           radar set clearance. If the radar altimeter low-altitude warning light illuminates,
           climb to a safe altitude.
           18.3.1.1.4. Alternate flying at approximately 30-minute intervals.
           18.3.1.1.5. Accomplish obstacle-warning checks periodically during TF operations.
           WARNING: The pilot will evaluate the E2 display prior to checking the obstacle
           warning (OW) system so as not to mask a valid OW or climb command. NOTE:
           The copilot will alert the crew prior to checking the obstacle warning system. Either
           pilot will alert the crew prior to testing the radar altimeters.
AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011                                                              137


        18.3.1.1.6. The flying pilot will acknowledge turns by restating the navigator's TA
        heading or the leg course.
        18.3.1.1.7. The flying pilot will ensure turns have been cleared visually or by radar.
        18.3.1.1.8. The flying pilot will receive clearance from the right navigator before
        descending in turns greater than 10 degrees bank angle unless visually cleared by
        pilots. Make only level or climbing turns of no more than 10 degrees bank when the
        right navigator advises weather attenuation prevents him from clearing turns with
        PGM.
     18.3.1.2. Left Navigator:
        18.3.1.2.1. Issues terrain advisories and monitors TA in the direction of turns.
        Immediately direct a roll out, change in bank angle, or climb if terrain will jeopardize
        safety for the established route of flight.
        18.3.1.2.2. Confirms terrain clearance with the right navigator when issuing TA
        headings to the pilot. When clearing the pilot onto navigation system steering, the
        left navigator confirms terrain clearance with the right navigator.
        18.3.1.2.3. Advises pilots of the location and elevation of significant obstructions.
        18.3.1.2.4. Responds to OWs, TF system failures, or weather exceeding system
        limits by restating the MSA after the right navigator has directed any turns away from
        terrain and a climb has been started.
        18.3.1.2.5. Normally performs time control.
        18.3.1.2.6. Advises the pilot and the right navigator when unable to distinguish
        weather from terrain on the left display.
        18.3.1.2.7. May monitor E2 display if pilots are monitoring the TA display.
     18.3.1.3. Right Navigator:
        18.3.1.3.1. Monitors terrain ahead of the airplane using PGM radar and ensures the
        TF radar is providing adequate climb commands, using fan and pencil beams, tilt, and
        filters (STC, FTC, and polarization) as necessary to distinguish terrain from weather
        and to judge the height of terrain above the airplane. WARNING: The mapping
        radar filters (STC, FTC, and polarization) can remove terrain as well as weather from
        the PGM display, if improperly used. NOTE: The map antenna is not stabilized in
        pitch or roll as precisely as the TF antenna, and its tilt control is not calibrated. This
        may cause errors when using pencil beam to judge the relative height of terrain. The
        effect of any error can be nullified by using fan beam to display terrain shadows and
        verify terrain clearance. Disregarding tilt calibration errors, the worst-case height
        error due to vertical stabilization errors is approximately 65 ft for terrain 4 NM from
        the aircraft.
        18.3.1.3.2. Uses PGM radar to ensure all turns, regardless of bank angle, are clear of
        hazardous terrain and adjusts roll out heading or bank angle to maintain clearance.
        The right navigator may clear the pilot to descend in turns provided the PGM radar
        indicator is not attenuated by weather.

         18.3.1.3.3. Responds to threat maneuvers using PGM to clear turns at bank angles
         requested by the EWO (up to 30 degrees bank) and advises the crew of any possible
         terrain advantage.
         18.3.1.3.4. Advises the pilot and the left navigator when unable to distinguish
         weather from terrain on PGM radar.
         18.3.1.3.5. Uses all available means to update the CANS on a non-interference basis
         with the other required duties.
         18.3.1.3.6. Normally issues TA headings to the pilot flying based on PGM and TA
         radar interpretation and TA plan.
      18.3.1.4. Both navigators monitor aircraft position relative to the planned TA flight path,
      coordinate turn requirements with each other and direct TA turns to the pilot to maintain
      flight path. TA turns should be preplanned with only minor in-flight changes caused by
      terrain not clearly depicted on charts. NOTE: Although the TA flight path is normally
      planned at 10 degrees bank, the right navigator may clear turns up to 30 degrees bank at
      any point to maintain the planned flight path.
      18.3.1.5. EWO:
         18.3.1.5.1. Monitors navigation and maintains awareness of position relative to
         threats and terrain. The EWO will be prepared to supply the pilot with the highest
         altitude allowed, commensurate with the threat environment, for each leg of the
         planned route. The EWO will backup navigator-briefed headings, airspeeds, and
         altitudes.
         18.3.1.5.2. Monitors the electromagnetic environment, providing warning to the pilot
         of possible conflicting traffic with type and clock position.
         18.3.1.5.3. Advises the crew of anticipated threats and probable deviations prior to
         entering the threat area.
         18.3.1.5.4. Supplies maneuver calls, applies appropriate ECM, and informs the crew
         of detected threats with type, position, and mode of engagement.
         18.3.1.5.5. Advises the pilots and navigators when clear of the threat and when able
         to resume planned heading, altitude, and airspeed.
  18.3.2. Specific En Route Procedures. WARNING: Perform an in-flight check of the TF
  system, a level or cresting check, when commencing low-level operations to ensure the
  system is operating within tolerances. If the TF system is flying out of limits low, TF
  operations will not be flown. If the TF system is flying out of limits high, TF operations are
  restricted to VMC.
      18.3.2.1. Changing Selected Altitude Clearance.
         18.3.2.1.1. The pilots and left navigator set the radar altimeter set markers to 70% of
         the new set clearance. The flight engineer verifies the new settings.
         18.3.2.1.2. To descend, the pilot selects the new set clearance, receives permission to
         descend from the right navigator, and descends to the new altitude while monitoring
         the pitch bar. The right navigator monitors the PGM radar throughout the descent.

 Notes:
 1. Pilots must be able to visually acquire controlling terrain at least 3 SM from the aircraft
 along the projected route of flight. Visual reference to the ground must be maintained and a
 visible horizon is recommended.
 2. Climbs must be initiated so that the aircraft is established at the higher MSA prior to the
 next segmented point. Descent to a lower MSA will not be initiated until past the next
 segmented point.
          18.3.2.1.3. To climb, the pilot starts the climb and monitors the pitch bar. The pilot
          will select the new set clearance after reaching an altitude that will not activate the
          OW system.
       18.3.2.2. Changing Control of the Aircraft. The pilot flying the aircraft will state the
       desired ground speed and leg course or TA heading. The pilot not flying the aircraft
       repeats the speed and heading and ensures a positive change of control. NOTE: If either
       pilot must leave his seat during TF operations, climb to at least the 500 ft set clearance in
       VMC. Climb to MSA if flying NVG contours or in IMC.
       18.3.2.3. Evasive maneuvers. For specific terminology, refer to AFTTP 33.MC130. A
       hard break is a visual maneuver and the pilots must clear terrain prior to initiation. When
       operating in IMC, the navigators will clear for terrain in accordance with paragraphs
       18.3.1.3 and 18.3.1.4 WARNING: Practicing defensive threat maneuvering does not
       constitute authority to deviate from limitations in the flight manual.
       18.3.2.4. Aircraft Systems Failure. Begin an immediate climb to MSA. After
       troubleshooting, either resume TF/TA operations or transition to alternate low-level
       procedures.

          is necessary, select the 170K gross weight setting and fly in the highest set clearance
          commensurate with the threat (1,000 ft set clearance for training).
          18.3.2.4.2. Loss of PGM (KA R/T, ECA or map antenna fail).
              18.3.2.4.2.1. The pilot selects CS mode and makes only level or climbing turns of
              up to 10 degrees of bank.
              18.3.2.4.2.2. The right navigator may monitor TA to permit the left navigator to
              perform visual navigation as conditions permit.
              18.3.2.4.2.3. Conditions permitting, the pilots will visually clear all turns using
              NVGs. The bank angle used for visually cleared turns will be at the discretion of
              the pilots.
          18.3.2.4.3. Loss of DSC Channel. When one or more DSC channels fail, the lowest
          priority operators must share a channel.     NOTE: During training missions the
          following two procedures are restricted to VMC only.
          18.3.2.4.4. Pilot‘s DSC Indicator Display Failure. Continue TF operations using the
          pitch bar alone.
          18.3.2.4.5. Loss or Erratic Operation of the Pitch Bar. Continue TF operations using
          the E2 display only.
18.4. NVG Low-level Operations.
   18.4.1. General. Refer to AFTTP 33.MC130 and Chapter 17 of this regulation for detailed
   information on NVG low-level planning factors and limitations.
   18.4.2. Required NVG Equipment.
       18.4.2.1. Aircraft Kits. Aircraft blackout curtains, green fabric tape, and porthole covers.
       18.4.2.2. Aircrew Kit. IR filtered flashlights, chemical lights (covert and overt) and
       NVGs. The pilots will use helmet-mounted NVGs. The left navigator and flight
       engineer may use a hand held set of NVGs. Have a spare set of NVGs available in the
       cockpit at a minimum. Pilots may choose to have their own spare set immediately
       available for them in flight. When the mission requires the loadmasters to use NVGs, a
       spare set will be available for their use as well. All individuals must perform a thorough
       preflight of their NVGs. Pilots are responsible for pre-flighting the spare set of NVGs in
       the cockpit and their own spares if carried.
       18.4.2.3. Pressure Altimeters. Both pilots‘, the navigator's, and the EWO's pressure
       altimeter will be operational.
       18.4.2.4. CANS. At least one navigation subsystem must be operational (INU, GPS).
       18.4.2.5. Training Restrictions. Aircraft flying NVG low-level will have an operating
       PGM (Ka-Band) radar for training flights conducted in mountainous terrain.
   18.4.3. Crew Duties:
       18.4.3.1. Flying Pilot. Maintain contour altitude and ensure terrain clearance.
AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011                                                             141


       18.4.3.2. Non-flying Pilot. Responsible for backing up the flying pilot on terrain and
       obstacle clearance. Should help the navigator maintain proper flight path, and
       acquiring/identifying con-trolling terrain and the objective area.
       18.4.3.3. Flight Engineer.    Monitors instruments, cross-checks altitude, and terrain
       clearance.
       18.4.3.4. Left Navigator (LN). Gives terrain and climb/descent advisories to the pilots.
       If seated, briefs turn points, manages TOT control and calls warnings. If the PGM is
       denied, the LN will use NVGs to assist in terrain clearance, controlling terrain
       acquisition, and maintaining desired flight path.
       18.4.3.5. Right Navigator (RN). If LN is in the window chart reading, briefs turn points,
       manages TOT control, and calls drop warnings. Uses equipment to keep the CANS
       updated and cross-checks altitude and terrain clearance. Gives TA headings based on
       radar, if use of PGM is not denied.
       18.4.3.6. EWO. Monitors radar warning receiver (RWR) equipment and advises of the
       threat situation. Verifies all recommended altitudes and turn point briefs.
   18.4.4. Transition to NVG Operations. Run the BEFORE LOW-LEVEL checklist if not
   already completed. Before transitioning from TF/TA to NVG low-level operations, ensure
   the aircraft has been properly configured (NVGs on and focused, blackout curtains lowered,
   aircraft lighting set up). If the aircraft has not been properly configured, climb to MSA.
   18.4.5. En route Procedures. NOTE: If either pilot must leave the seat, climb to MSA.
       18.4.5.1. If a threat forces the aircraft to deviate, the crew must make the decision to
       continue NVG low-level procedures or transition to TF operations. The decision should
       take into account terrain, illumination/visual conditions, status of the threat, and radar
       warm-up time. During training, threat engagements will be terminated if the aircraft
       deviates more than 2 NM from the planned flight path or as briefed.
   18.4.6. Transition from NVG Low-Level. Maintain the desired TF altitude if transitioning to
   TF/TA flight. Begin a climb if not transitioning to TF/TA flight and complete the AFTER
   LOW-LEVEL checklist.
18.5. SCA Procedures. This operation requires a mission crew.
   18.5.1. Non-NVG Procedures:
       18.5.1.1. The pilot and navigator will brief and review the SCA during the ENROUTE
       portion of the INFIL/EXFIL checklist.
       18.5.1.2. Prior to the initial point (IP), the navigators will check the IP-LZ data in the
       CANS. The navigators will use all available means to verify position and terrain or
       obstruction clearance before descending below TF set clearance (MSL altitude if the TF
       radar is not used).
       18.5.1.3. Approaching the IP, initiate the turn to roll out on final. After the turn is
       initiated, the navigators will confirm the CANS is in the approach mode and notify the
       pilots of IP-LZ steering and cross track.
142                                                AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011


      18.5.1.4. Normally, the navigator will initiate the slowdown no later than 3 NM prior to
      glide slope intercept. The pilot flying the aircraft will slow to 140 KIAS or 50%
      approach speed, whichever is higher. The pilot flying the aircraft will call for flaps to
      50% and the copilot will lower the gear at the appropriate speeds. The pilot will not
      move the pitch signal select switch to the isolate position until terrain following is no
      longer required.
      18.5.1.5. On final approach, the left navigator will make distance to touchdown and
      cross track left or right of LZ centerline calls using the CANS (backed up by the mapping
      radar). The right navigator will confirm LZ centerline alignment on short final with
      mapping radar. The right navigator will give final verbal headings when the radar
      presentation indicates the aircraft is not aligned with the LZ centerline. The pilot not
      flying the approach will monitor the CANS or a ground approach aid.
      18.5.1.6. The aircraft will be slowed to normal or max effort threshold speed, as
      required. Do not extend flaps beyond 50% until terrain following is no longer required.
      For tactical operations, the pilot will set the desired egress detent and may isolate the
      pitch bar. The engineer completes the BEFORE LANDING checklist.
      18.5.1.7. At glide slope interception, the left navigator will state "Begin Descent" and
      repeat the desired descent rate. The left navigator will provide advisories with reference
      to the CANS, the servoed pressure altimeter, and the radar altimeter. These calls will be
      made at 1 NM intervals until start descent and then will be made at ½ NM intervals until
      reaching 300 ft above the TDZE, or when the pilot takes visual control, whichever occurs
      first. State deviations in excess of 150 ft explicitly.
      18.5.1.8. The left navigator, backed up by the EWO or AMSS, will call "100 Above" at
      MDA plus 100 ft and "Minimums" at MDA. The pilot flying the aircraft will
      acknowledge the MDA call.
      18.5.1.9. The left navigator calls "Missed Approach Point" at zero to go on the CANS.
  18.5.2. NVG SCA Procedures. Use the Non-NVG SCA procedures and add the following:
      18.5.2.1. General. An NVG landing qualified pilot (non-instructor) may takeoff and land
      from the right seat provided an NVG landing qualified pilot is in the left seat and normal
      (non-assault) procedures are used. Either pilot may fly the NVG SCA. Procedures
      described are for the copilot flying the SCA. Use normal performance unless max effort
      performance is required.
      18.5.2.2. Takeoff Procedures:
         18.5.2.2.1. Pilot. At takeoff speed, the pilot rotates to establish a seven-degree nose-
         up attitude. When the aircraft is in a definite climb, verified by the copilot, the pilot
         calls for gear retraction. The pilot may continue to fly or direct the copilot to take
         control. This positive change of control should not occur at less than 100 ft AGL.
             18.5.2.2.1.1. On takeoff roll, the copilot calls out airspeeds starting at 60 KIAS
             and continues to call every 10 knots. These calls are optional.
             18.5.2.2.1.2. After rotation, the copilot checks and verifies a seven-degree nose-
             up attitude and positive rate of climb are maintained. The copilot raises the gear
             on command. The copilot may take control of the aircraft when directed by the
AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011                                                           143


           pilot. Flaps should remain set at 50% until reaching a safe airspeed and altitude.
           The pilot flying the aircraft directs the accomplishment of the AFTER TAKEOFF
           checklist.
        18.5.2.2.2. Flight Engineer. Using NVGs, will back up the pilot during takeoff roll
        and climb-out. Clears for terrain and obstacles.
        18.5.2.2.3. Navigator. The navigator will provide a departure briefing including
        departure heading and terrain and obstacles. The navigator will call altitudes at 50,
        100, 150, and 200 ft AGL during climb-out. These calls are optional.
     18.5.2.3. Approach Procedures.
        18.5.2.3.1. Pilot:
           18.5.2.3.1.1. Upon visual acquisition of the runway state "Runway In Sight,
           Pilot" and may direct the copilot to the runway or maneuver the aircraft to runway
           alignment. The pilot will take control of the aircraft and make the landing. The
           copilot may make airspeed and descent calls if requested by the pilot.
           18.5.2.3.1.2. Upon landing and if briefed prior, the pilot may continue to receive
           airspeed calls from the copilot until 60 KIAS or taxi speed.
           18.5.2.3.1.3. Taxi aircraft into position and give the loadmaster clearance to on or
           off-load by stating "Clear To Off-load/Onload."
        18.5.2.3.2. Copilot:
           18.5.2.3.2.1. The copilot normally flies the aircraft from approximately the 20-
           minute warning until the pilot takes control of the aircraft on final approach. The
           copilot may lower the NVGs, if desired, but must not allow distraction from the
           primary duty of flying the approach and, if necessary, executing a go-around.
           18.5.2.3.2.2. The copilot will maintain the planned set clearance or MSL altitude
           until the descent point and follow the CANS steering or navigator's instructions.
           18.5.2.3.2.3. The copilot will not descend below MDA and will maintain the
           MDA until the pilot takes control or until reaching the missed approach point.
           Execute a go-around if the runway environment is not in sight at the MAP,
           directed, or a safe landing cannot be made.
           18.5.2.3.2.4. Once the pilot has taken control, the copilot may provide the pilot
           with air-speed and descent rate information if requested by the pilot. Intersperse
           this information with the HAT calls from the navigator: For example, "115,
           Down 6, 50 ft."
           18.5.2.3.2.5. Upon landing, the copilot will provide airspeed to the pilot until
           slowing to 60 KIAS. These calls are optional. The copilot will have NVGs
           focused and ready for immediate use during taxi operations and assist in locating
           the briefed location.
        18.5.2.3.3. Navigator: Call all warnings for the INFIL/EXFIL checklist (60-, 30-
        advisories, 20-, and 10-minute warnings).
           18.5.2.3.3.1. Intersperse height above touchdown calls with the copilot's airspeed
144                                                AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011


             and descent rate calls if briefed. EXCEPTION: The navigator will call 2 NM
             and minimums to alert the loadmaster to initiate the "One Minute Warning" and
             "Prepare To Land" calls respectively.
         18.5.2.3.4. Flight Engineer. The flight engineer's primary attention should be
         directed inside the cockpit. Assist in clearing for other aircraft or obstacles only
         when other duties permit.
             18.5.2.3.4.1. Cross check airspeeds, altitudes and headings. Check external
             lighting and cockpit for bleed through of non-IR light. Have NVGs available and
             ready for use prior to the IP. Assist in maintaining terrain and obstacle clearance.
             18.5.2.3.4.2. Call "Configuration Checked" after checking gear down and the
             flaps during the BEFORE LANDING portion of the INFIL/EXFIL checklist.
             Assist in field acquisition and call "Runway In Sight, Engineer" once the runway
             is identified. NOTE: An additional pilot may accomplish this step if the flight
             engineer is noncurrent in NVG landings.
             18.5.2.3.4.3. Sets the flaps and exterior lights during the BEFORE LANDING
             portion of the INFIL/EXFIL checklist.
             18.5.2.3.4.4. Assist in finding the off-load point. Clear for other aircraft and
             obstructions during taxi operations.
      18.5.2.4. Go-around. A go-around will be initiated at the MAP if the runway has not
      been visually acquired, a safe landing cannot be accomplished, or if directed.
         18.5.2.4.1. Pilots. The flying pilot will initiate the go-around and ensure a positive
         rate of climb is obtained and verified by the non-flying pilot. A change of aircraft
         control may be accomplished during the go-around but should not occur lower than
         100 ft AGL. Reconfigure the flaps and gear once a safe altitude and airspeed have
         been reached. Reset the TF radar set clearance and pitch bar (if applicable).
             18.5.2.4.1.1. If a go-around occurs but an immediate landing is feasible, the pilot
             may maneuver to a VFR pattern. The NVG VFR pattern must be part of the
             overall planning. The pilot will announce intentions and direct the engineer to set
             the flaps to 50%. The pilot will announce the planned altitude and airspeed for
             downwind. The flight engineer will complete the asterisked items of the
             BEFORE LANDING portion of the INFIL/EXFIL checklist. After the base turn
             is initiated all operations will be flown for a NVG landing.
         18.5.2.4.2. Flight Engineer. Backs up the pilots on airspeed, altitude, rate of climb,
         and terrain clearance.
         18.5.2.4.3. Navigators. Repeat the set clearance or MSL altitude and initial heading
         required if a go-around is executed. When a go-around is initiated below 200 ft AGL,
         call altitudes at 50, 100, 150, and 200 ft AGL during the climb. These calls are
         optional.
      18.5.2.5. The FLIR Pass is a method of ensuring an uncontrolled LZ is clear using the
      FLIR. Complete the Ten-minute warning on time and hold the checklist at this point.
      Normally, the copilot will fly during the FLIR pass. As a guide, at a pre-briefed point
      prior, slow the aircraft to 180 KIAS using the verbiage "Slow To 180 Now" (called by
AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011                                                             145


      the navigator). Normally the aircraft is flown at 500 ft AGL, aligned 100-200 yards to
      the right of the runway. This allows the pilot and navigator to "visually" acquire any
      obstacles placed on the runway. As soon as possible the navigator will call "Runway
      Clear (or condition)" and begin to retract the FLIR. Turn to a downwind, maintaining the
      planned set clearance or MSL altitude, and resume the INFIL/EXFIL checklist. After the
      base turn, all operations will be flown for a NVG landing.
      18.5.2.6. Aircraft NVG Preparations. Tape all non-NVG compatible lighting and select
      NVIS with the NVIS Lighting Mode Switch. All crew positions should tape all bright
      indicator lights, dim all panel lights, and close blackout curtains as applicable.
18.6. Airdrop Procedures.
   18.6.1. Navigating to the Release Point.
      18.6.1.1. General. Positioning at the release point is the most critical phase of the
      airdrop mission. Ensure all warnings and checklists are completed, proper DZ line-up is
      maintained, and the TOT is within established tolerances.
      18.6.1.2. Positioning. CANS AUTOCARP, manual CARP, manual beacon, and ground
      marked release system (GMRS) methods may be used to position the aircraft at the
      release point. For visual airdrops at night, the left navigator may wear night vision
      goggles (NVG) to accomplish drops on covertly marked or unmarked drop zones. The
      navigators are responsible for computing the release point for all airdrops (EXCEPTION:
      GMRS).
      18.6.1.3. Aircrew Procedures. These are basic procedures used to arrive at the release
      point.
          18.6.1.3.1. The left navigator will brief the crew on CARP location, the expected
          drift, magnetic heading, drop altitude, drop airspeed, MSA between IP and DZ,
          ground hazards and terrain in the drop area, escape heading, and altitude to be flown
          after the drop. The navigator will brief an updated CARP after slowdown if it has
          changed.
          18.6.1.3.2. Airspeed adjustments for TOT should be completed prior to slowdown.
          18.6.1.3.3. The navigator provides course corrections that will position the aircraft
          the required distance upwind from the centerline track so large corrections will not be
          required on the final approach.
          18.6.1.3.4. Upon departing the IP, the right navigator will confirm that IP - DZ
          steering is selected. The left navigator will select manual on the Cargo Release
          Control Panel at the 10-minute warning. This action will preclude inadvertent
          triggering of the system during the IP to DZ run in.
          18.6.1.3.5. The pilot will steer to the CARP using the flight director system or
          following the navigator's headings.
          18.6.1.3.6. If required, the navigator will call the slowdown. A 6 NM slowdown is
          normally used, but may be modified. A modified slowdown can be planned or
          briefed in flight prior to the slowdown. The modified slowdown allows the navigator
          to call the 1-minute warning before the slowdown check is complete. Loadmasters
146                                                AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011


         will complete slowdown and 1-minute checks in sequence and then call them
         complete.
         18.6.1.3.7. The navigators will advise when or if terrain following will terminate and
         request the pilot to fly the appropriate MSL altitude and airspeed. This normally
         takes place at the slowdown but may be modified due to terrain or obstacles. When
         MSL altitudes are flown, the pressure altimeter is the primary height reference, with
         the radar altimeter set to 50 ft below drop altitude. When the TF radar is used as the
         primary height reference, set the radar altimeter to 70% of set clearance.
         18.6.1.3.8. After the ten-second call, if it is determined that a safe AUTOCARP can
         be made, the navigator may select auto.
         18.6.1.3.9. If it is determined that a safe AUTOCARP cannot be made and conditions
         permit, a backup visual drop can be made. Ensure the manual release button has
         manual selected in order to preclude inadvertent triggering of the system.
         18.6.1.3.10. Ten seconds prior to the CARP, the navigator will give a verbal
         warning, "Ten Seconds."
         18.6.1.3.11. At the CARP:
             18.6.1.3.11.1. The navigator will give the command "Green Light."
             18.6.1.3.11.2. The non-flying pilot will turn on the green light, state ―On,‖ and
             simultaneously depress the aerial delivery system (ADS) button (if applicable).
             18.6.1.3.11.3. The loadmaster, after seeing the green light and hearing the oral
             signal, will activate the manual release handle if the extraction chute fails to
             release (if applicable).
         18.6.1.3.12. During the Drop:
             18.6.1.3.12.1. The flying pilot will maintain the desired track, making small
             corrections as necessary.
             18.6.1.3.12.2. The navigator will call "Red Light" at the end of the programmed
             or computed time delay, or load clear.
             18.6.1.3.12.3. If the loadmaster observes any delay or malfunction of equipment,
             or delay of a parachutist to jump, the pilot will be advised.
         18.6.1.3.13. Hostile Drop Zone Escape. After the aircraft has been reconfigured (for
         drops requiring a slowdown), the static lines have been retrieved or cut and the
         paratroop doors and deflectors closed, the remainder of the completion of drop
         checklist may be deferred to a time when threat avoidance does not take precedence.
  18.6.2. AUTOCARP. This is the primary method of airdrop. When waypoint and ballistic
  data are programmed, the CANS computes the CARP, provides navigational steering through
  the pilot's flight director system, and activates the green light. The right navigator normally
  updates the CANS with GPS or radar, providing an accurate blind airdrop capability.
  WARNING: AUTOCARP release will not be used for personnel airdrops. NOTE: The
  airdrop accuracy of this method is directly dependent on the accuracy of pre-computed
  relative radar targets and DZ coordinates. For this reason, both navigators will compute and

  plot the coordinates or offsets of planned relative radar targets and point of impact
  independently, then resolve any discrepancies prior to programming the CANS.
  18.6.3. Visual Airdrop Procedures. When visual markings or references are available and
  visibility permits, this method allows the left navigator or pilots to make final adjustments in
  aircraft alignment and call the drop visually. The left navigator or pilot directing the drop
  must ensure the flying pilot is notified when to fly headings versus following the CANS
  steering.
     18.6.3.1. The left navigator, with the assistance of the right navigator, determines the
     drop wind then solves and plots the CARP.
     18.6.3.2. The left navigator informs the pilots and the right navigator of the final CARP
     location relative to the point of impact.
     18.6.3.3. As soon as the DZ is visible and identified by the left navigator and pilot, they
     jointly confirm the release point location, lateral offset, and track required. The pilot
     flying the aircraft then assumes the responsibility for maintaining the desired track.
     NOTE: When the left navigator is using NVGs for primary or backup visual airdrops
     and is forward of the blackout curtain, the navigators should coordinate warning calls,
     drop winds, and CARP location over private interphone.

 3. If all pilot VDTs are operational, both pilots will have an ADI selected at all times.
AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011                                                                  149


 WARNING: IMC TF will only be conducted if the radar has been properly boresighted and
 the radar self tests with no persistent hard fails in the ―STAT‖ column on the equipment status
 page.

 NOTE: Regardless of test results or meteorological conditions crews should attempt to verify
 antenna limitations are met by flying all applicable SCPs intended for use. If the radar has not
 been boresighted, or if the radar self test cannot be accomplished, TF is restricted to VMC
 only (minimum visibility conditions for visual low-level apply). In this situation, the crew will
 verify flight manual antenna limitations are met by flying all applicable SCPs in flat and
 rolling terrain prior to flying in mountainous terrain.

Notes:
1. Flat/rolling terrain or over water only.
2. If all pilot VDTs are operational, both pilots will have an ADI selected at all times.
      19.2.1.1. The RALT OVRD function on the navigator/EWO E2 will only be used during
      day VMC or during combat/contingency operations.
  19.2.2. Change of Control. Pilot flying will initiate the change of control and state speed
  and steering reference when not following computer guidance. Pilot monitoring takes
  positive control of the aircraft and acknowledges the changeover.
  19.2.3. Altimeters. The pilot, copilot, and navigator will acknowledge all manual changes in
  altimeter setting. If TRUE ALT is selected, the navigator must still perform the required
  terminal area altitude calibrations. Crew members will monitor TRUE ALT altimeter
  settings for accuracy. The standby altimeters will be set to the lowest forecast altimeter
  setting for the route or area of operations. If TRUE ALT is selected, and the TRUE ALT
  altimeter setting falls below the lowest forecast altimeter setting, the TRUE ALT value will
  be set in the standby and used as the lowest altimeter setting for the route or area of
  operations. Use standby altimeters as the primary altitude reference when flying at
  MSA/ESA or obstacle warning reactions.
  19.2.4. Obstacle Procedures. Any tower or man-made obstruction within 3 NM of planned
  flight path must be positively identified visually or on radar. If not identified by 3 NM prior
  to the tower or obstacle, climb to at least 250 ft above the obstruction until clear.
  19.2.5. Terrain Following.
      19.2.5.1. The pilot monitoring will alert the crew, select the desired SCP and set the
      radar altimeter to 80% of SCP. After both pilots have selected TF and verified TF system
      tolerances are being met, they can intercept selected SCP after coordinating with the
      navigator or EWO. WARNING: Perform an in-flight check of the TF system, and a
      level or cresting check, when commencing low-level operations to ensure the system is
      operating within tolerances. If the TF system is flying out of limits low, TF operations
      will not be flown. If the TF system is flying out of limits high, TF operations are
      restricted to VMC. NOTE: Autopilot will not be used during low-level operations
  19.2.6. Visual, NVG, and Threat Penetration Low-level.
      19.2.6.1. Minimum visibility to conduct NVG low-level is 3 SM.
AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011                                                               151


      19.2.6.2. The pilot monitoring will use NVGs to clear during NVG low-level operations.
      19.2.6.3. Set the RALT TF function to the desired altitude, no less than 300 ft (100 ft for
      threat penetration operations). The radar altimeter will be set to no lower than 80% of
      this altitude.
      19.2.6.4. Prior to accepting any update, the navigator will inform the pilots by stating
      "Updating" followed by a heading or clearance to follow computer steering.
      19.2.6.5. Following each update, time and conditions permitting, the navigator will
      determine which navigation mode is most accurate (INS/GPS, INS1, INS2, GPS, etc.)
      and make the appropriate selection.
   19.2.7. Turn point procedures and Off Course Maneuvering.
      19.2.7.1. The navigator or EWO will provide the new course and MSA prior to the turn
      point. The EWO will brief anticipated threats and aircraft deviations for the next leg.
      19.2.7.2. The navigator and pilot monitoring share the primary responsibility of clearing
      terrain in the direction of turn and no other duties must be allowed to interfere with this
      responsibility.
      19.2.7.3. Use caution whenever maneuvering in excess of 2 NM from the planned flight
      path, as terrain in the immediate area may exceed the MSA and terrain masking may be
      rendered ineffective. NVG altitudes may also be inadequate for the unexpected flight
      path.
19.3. Low-level Emergency Procedures.
   19.3.1. Unplanned Obstacle Warning (OW) Reactions. WARNING: These procedures are
   not written to allow crews to ―visually‖ clear themselves while reacting to a TF system
   generated OW. Sound judgment and clear crew communication needs to be exercised
   throughout the execution of these maneuvers to quickly resolve the cause of an unplanned
   OW, regardless of its validity.
      19.3.1.1. Straight ahead corridors. The pilot flying will increase power towards max TIT
      (not to exceed 19,600 inch/pounds torque), initiate a positive G pull-up (to attain a pitch
      approaching CLA) and begin a climb towards MSA, while the pilot monitoring, navigator
      and EWO cross-check all other available means to identify the cause of the OW. The
      navigator/EWO directing the navigation will provide lateral guidance/direction in
      response to the determined cause of the OW. The flying pilot will resume flying the
      system after receiving confirmation from the navigator/EWO directing the navigation the
      TF system is functioning properly (i.e., no radar system fails or pointing errors).
      19.3.1.2. Course correction and turning corridors. If the OW occurs as a result of
      exceeding 10 degrees angle of bank, the pilot flying will immediately lessen the bank to
      less than 10 degrees while executing the steps outlined in 19.3.1.1
          19.3.1.2.1. If the cue returns after the reduction in bank angle to less than 10 degrees,
          the pilot flying will resume flying the system (i.e., no radar system fails or pointing
          errors).
          19.3.1.2.2. If the OW remains after the reduction in bank angle to less than 10
          degrees, the crew will continue with the procedures outlined in 19.3.1.1
 152                                                AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011


   19.3.2. Planned OW Reactions. Crews will thoroughly brief and positively identify a safe
   altitude, distance to go and intended crew actions for the OW during preflight planning and
   route study. Crews should also discuss actions to be taken if the OW occurs differently than
   planned.
   19.3.3. Avionics/Aircraft Systems Failure. When a failure of the selected TF system or
   other required equipment occurs or is suspected during IMC low-level operations, the pilot
   will immediately begin a climb to at least MSA for the leg or segment and select another
   low-level method (if available). Maintain the MSA until the malfunction is corrected and
   continued safe low-level operations can be resumed. When the failure cannot be corrected
   and an alternate low-level method is not available, discontinue low-level operations.
   WARNING: It is essential to verify terrain clearance prior to deselecting Radar TF. In IMC,
   do not deselect TF if the cue is directing a climb.     CAUTION: Due to possible system
   damage, do not use the X OVRD, KU OVRD and SPC OVRD keys on the navigator/EWO
   E2 layer except during actual combat or contingency operations.            NOTE: Weather
   conditions can reduce the effectiveness of mission-essential sensors to the point of effective
   failure. If this occurs, comply with the appropriate emergency procedures.
   19.3.4. Engine Failure.
       19.3.4.1. Discontinue low-level operations if feasible.
       19.3.4.2. If terrain following is necessary, select the X-band radar TF/TA mode if
       available, verify the system is in the three-engine TF mode and check the route of flight
       for obstacles which could exceed available climb performance.
19.4. Airdrop Operations.
   19.4.1. The engineer runs all airdrop checklists and will operate the flaps.
   19.4.2. MC automatic CARP/HARP, manual (visual) CARP/HARP, manual beacon and
   GMRS methods may be used to position the aircraft at the release point.
   19.4.3. Normally navigate to the DZ using MC guidance. The navigator may decide at any
   time to accomplish the drop visually, using NVGs if necessary. For GMRS airdrops, the
   pilot will visually position the aircraft and call the release.
   19.4.4. The MSL altitude used on the drop leg must be the true altitude for the drop (block 3
   on AF Form 4015) if the MC BALT setting is derived by in-flight altimeter calibration. If
   using a preflight altimeter use the indicated MSL altitude (block 8 on AF Form 4015).
   19.4.5. All controlled ETA procedures should be completed prior to reaching the slowdown
   point. Early or delayed slowdown calls or "S" turns after the IP for timing purposes should
   be avoided. After the slowdown, airspeed changes for TOT control should be avoided.
   19.4.6. After the IP. Upon departing the IP (or the slowdown point if one is programmed),
   the navigator, EWO, and pilots will confirm the MC is on a DROP or HARP leg. The pilot
   will steer to the CARP/HARP using the flight director system or follow the navigator's
   headings.
   19.4.7. Slowdown. Unless otherwise briefed, reduce power to 1,000 in-lbs of torque and
   depending on the tactical situation, maintain altitude or climb immediately. As airspeed
   permits, extend flaps to 50%, slowing to drop airspeed. If descent is required, reduce power
AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011                                                                153


   to 1,000 in-lbs of torque and maintain level flight. As airspeed permits, extend flaps to 50%
   and descend while maintaining 140 KCAS.
   19.4.8. The use of the TERM CNST function should be reserved for operations where terrain
   will cause an OW throughout the objective run-in or an OW in close proximity to the
   objective area; but in all cases its use will be thoroughly briefed. The pilot flying will retain
   radar TF cues or select TERM CNST as briefed, while flying the navigator‘s briefed True or
   Barometric Altitude, Magnetic Course, and Calibrated Airspeed. The pilot monitoring
   should retain radar TF cues and backup the pilot flying. Terrain or threat conditions may
   require a different location for leaving en route low-level altitudes and this will be prebriefed
   if planned. The navigator will cross-check the MC CARP/HARP display with the manual
   CARP/HARP.           WARNING: The mission computer will command a descent if TERM
   CNST is selected above the programmed leg altitude. The DROP leg altitude could be below
   the minimum en route altitude for the terrain, weather, and degraded equipment conditions
   actually encountered. Prior to selection of TERM CNST, careful evaluation of all sensors (or
   visual references), should be made to ensure the mission computer guidance will not direct
   the aircraft into terrain.
   19.4.9. A thorough study of the terminal environment will be conducted to identify the most
   suitable VDT radar altimeter setting for the airdrop being accomplished.
      19.4.9.1. When dropping in flat and rolling terrain, set VDT radar altimeter to 50 ft
      below briefed drop AGL altitude for personnel airdrops and no lower than the minimum
      chute actuation altitude for equipment airdrops.
      19.4.9.2. When dropping in sloped or mountainous terrain, set the VDT radar altimeter
      to 50 ft below the briefed CARP radar altitude for personnel airdrops. Set the VDT radar
      altimeter to the lowest expected terrain crossing altitude for equipment airdrops.
19.5. SCA Procedures.
   19.5.1. Crew Duties. NOTE: Normally the copilot flies the SCA and the pilot assumes
   control for the landing. During NVG operations, an NVG landing qualified pilot (non-
   instructor) may takeoff and land from the right seat provided an NVG landing qualified pilot
   is in the left seat and normal (non-assault) procedures are used. In this case, either pilot may
   fly the SCA, with the other pilot accomplishing the landing and subsequent takeoff.
   Instructor pilots may fly both the SCA and landing for demonstration purposes. During day
   operations or overt night operations to lit runways, either pilot may fly the SCA and landing.
      19.5.1.1. The navigator/EWO will determine the most accurate altimeter setting for the
      LZ using all available sources including GPS, weather forecasts, ground station reporting
      and altitude calibration, as available.
      19.5.1.2. Use this altimeter setting in the MC BALT. The standby altimeters will
      normally remain set at the lowest altimeter setting for the route or route segment.
      19.5.1.3. The flight engineer will have NVGs ready for immediate use. The PM will
      back up the PF on the displays and confirm terrain clearance using all means available.
      The PM and flight engineer will clear for obstacles and other traffic.
   19.5.2. At the Initial Point.
154                                                  AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011


      19.5.2.1. The navigator/EWO will verify final course guidance accuracy. The pilots,
      navigator, and EWO will confirm the system is in the APPR mode.
      19.5.2.2. The navigator or EWO will confirm LZ alignment with GM/PGM radar and
      IDS and give final headings as required.
  19.5.3. Slowdown.
      19.5.3.1. Slowdown should be initiated approximately 3 NM prior to the planned glide
      slope intercept point. The navigator/EWO will initiate the slowdown. The FE will state
      ―Tracking‖ once cleared for 50% flaps. When the flaps reach 50% and airspeed passes
      165 KIAS, the FE will state ―Landing Gear.‖ As soon as gear is down the FE will state
      ―Gear Down, Flaps‖ and standby for clearance to set flaps to 100%. Upon receiving
      clearance to move flaps, the FE will state ―Tracking‖ and resume the INFIL/EXFIL
      BEFORE LANDING checklist at the ―Landing Gear‖ step.
      19.5.3.2. Do not slow to threshold speed until established on final for both straight-in
      and turning SCAs. For turning SCAs, maintain 140 KCAS/KIAS or approach speed
      whichever is higher in the turn. Once the slowdown is initiated, no further airspeed
      corrections for TOA control should be made.
  19.5.4. Altimeters. The pilot will set the radar altimeter to the MDA (HAT). Throughout
  the approach, the pilot will monitor radar/barometric altimeters to ensure appropriate terrain
  clearance until taking over for the landing. WARNING: The obstacle clearance procedures
  in this chapter are not applicable to NVG operations conducted in a visual pattern. The pilot
  must maintain visual contact with the LZ and with surrounding terrain in order to execute a
  successful approach.
  19.5.5. One Mile Prior to Glide slope Intercept.
      19.5.5.1. When approaching the glidepath (or prebriefed distance to go), the navigator or
      EWO will clear the pilots to select TERM CNST after cross-checking all available
      sensors for significant terrain. The copilot will select TERM CNST after receiving
      clearance/confirmation from the pilot of adequate terrain clearance. WARNING: The
      navigator will verify the actual aircraft position is inside the planned SCA obstacle
      template prior to initiating descent (and prior to pilots selecting terminal consent).
  19.5.6. Glide slope Intercept. The pilot flying will begin descent following the flight
  director cue unless directed otherwise by the navigator/EWO, pilot, or flight engineer. The
  pilot flying will not descend the aircraft below MSL MDA. WARNING: The PM,
  navigator, and EWO must closely monitor radar altimeters to ensure accuracy of altimeter
  settings to prevent inadvertently flying below planned AGL minimums.
      19.5.6.1. At glide slope intercept the navigator or EWO will monitor course and glide
      slope deviation using the VSD or HSD display. Report deviations greater than 50 yd
      laterally or 50 ft vertically, along with an advisory as to whether the aircraft is correcting
      to, paralleling or diverging from course/glidepath.
  19.5.7. Level Off/Minimums.
      19.5.7.1. Level off at MDA if the pilot monitoring has not taken control of the aircraft.
      The flying pilot will maintain the MDA until the pilot monitoring takes control of the
      aircraft or until reaching the MAP (system position distance-to-go is 0.0 or as briefed by
AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011                                                                155


     the navigator or EWO). The pilot monitoring may direct the flying pilot to the LZ
     (remain at/above MDA) or may maneuver the aircraft himself. The navigator or EWO
     will select the IDS, if available, in FPV mode and MED FOV after completing the final
     position update and verifying the runway has been correctly identified and is clear of
     obstructions.
     19.5.7.2. IMC/VMC SCA. Do not descend below MDA until the touchdown zone is
     visually identified and confirmed by both pilots.
  19.5.8. Visual Acquisition of the LZ.
     19.5.8.1. The flight engineer will assist in field acquisition and visually check the LZ is
     clear.
     19.5.8.2. Aircraft lighting will be as briefed/directed by ground parties for authentication
     purposes. The use of covert lighting will be thoroughly briefed in respect to threat,
     runway environment, and authentication procedures.
  19.5.9. After Touchdown.
     19.5.9.1. The copilot and flight engineer will assist the pilot in locating the off-
     load/onload point once taxi speed is reached and clear for other aircraft and obstructions.
     If the pilot makes the landing from the right seat, the pilot in the left seat will be prepared
     to assume aircraft control once taxi speed is reached.
  19.5.10. Go-around Procedures.
     19.5.10.1. The navigator or EWO will advise the pilots upon arriving at the MAP and
     repeat the terrain clearance altitude (e.g., radar TF SCP, RALT TF, MSL altitude, pattern
     altitude, etc.), the initial heading, and will call altitudes climbing through from 50 ft to
     200 ft AGL (i.e., 50, 100, 150, 200) if a go-around is executed.
     19.5.10.2. The flight engineer will monitor engine instruments, airspeed, altitude, rate of
     climb, configuration, and terrain clearance.
     19.5.10.3. Go-around-Immediate Landing Feasible. The pilot will state "Go-Around,
     Immediate Landing Feasible." After establishing a safe climb, the pilot flying will direct
     the flaps set to 50%. The pilot flying will call for 100% flaps before or after rolling off
     the perch and call for the appropriate checklist. The engineer will pick up the checklist
     by reconfirming the landing gear position and accomplishing the remaining items of the
     checklist. Maintain 140 KCAS/KIAS or approach speed, whichever is higher until
     established on final.
         19.5.10.3.1. This maneuver should only require the movement of flaps and landing
         light switches. If any other change in configuration is accomplished, then the entire
         checklist will be used.
         19.5.10.3.2. The go-around button will be activated if terrain near the airfield dictates
         use of TF to safely fly visually back to the runway. The pilot's decision to use the go-
         around button should be coordinated with the navigator and EWO during preflight
         planning. WARNING: Be aware after G/A is selected, radar TF will not be active,
         nor will lateral steering begin until the selected SCP is reached.      WARNING: If
         G/A is not selected and the system remains in the APPR leg, the pilot must fly the
 156                                                 AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011


          MSL altitude directed by the navigator to ensure terrain clearance. The cue will not
          give reliable vertical guidance until reestablished on the glide slope.
          19.5.10.3.3. If the GO-AROUND button was selected, TERM CNST must be
          selected prior to descending below the selected SCP to prevent a LOW ALT.
   19.5.11. Takeoff Procedures.
       19.5.11.1. Accomplish the ON THE RUNWAY portion of the INFIL/EXFIL checklist.
       If a visual pattern or turning SCA back to the LZ is to be accomplished, use the ON THE
       RUNWAY touch and go steps of the INFIL/EXFIL checklist, if desired. Use the normal
       checklist procedures IAW applicable T.O. 1C130(MDS)-1, when not using the
       INFIL/EXFIL checklist.
       19.5.11.2. The navigator will provide a departure heading, altitude, and terrain
       considerations. NOTE: For departures into TF en route procedures, the navigator will
       program an APPR leg on the ground to ensure the selection of G/A results in an active TF
       system with valid steering.
       19.5.11.3. The pilot flying will make the takeoff wearing NVGs. The pilot monitoring
       will wear NVGs and be prepared to fly the planned departure on NVGs or transition to
       instruments and fly the navigator‘s directions in the event of NVG failure.
       19.5.11.4. Use IR taxi and landing lights to the minimum extent required to maintain
       visual references during takeoff roll. Interior lighting is the same as for the approach and
       landing. The flight engineer will clear the LZ for obstacles.
       19.5.11.5. Use normal takeoff performance unless max effort performance is required.
       At refusal speed, the copilot calls "Go." At takeoff speed, the copilot calls "Rotate." If
       takeoff and refusal speed are equal, the copilot will call "Go."
       19.5.11.6. At takeoff speed, the pilot will rotate the aircraft to establish a positive climb
       rate. The copilot checks the pitch attitude and will raise the landing gear on the
       command of the pilot after ensuring a positive rate of climb. The flight engineer will
       back up the pilot using NVGs during climb out. The copilot may take control of the
       aircraft if directed by the pilot and continue the climb out to the egress route altitude.
       The pilot flying directs the accomplishment of the appropriate AFTER TAKEOFF
       checklist.
          19.5.11.6.1. At or before takeoff speed, the pilot will select MC G/A mode.
       19.5.11.7. The navigator or EWO will advise the pilots of the initial on course heading
       and call altitudes climbing through from 50 ft to 200 ft AGL (i.e., 50, 100, 150, 200).
       19.5.11.8. As soon as conditions permit, the loadmaster will check equipment restraint
       and condition/needs of the onboard user.
19.6. Defensive Maneuvering.
   19.6.1. When operating in VMC, pilots must clear terrain prior to and during any threat
   reaction.
   19.6.2. When operating in IMC, the EWO or navigator will use the GM or PGM to clear for
   terrain prior to calling a turn or break that requires a faster turn rate than the radar turning
AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011                                                            157


   scan capability. In IMC, the navigator may clear the pilot up to a 30-degree bank angle using
   this method. The pilots/navigator/EWO will cross-check their altitude references to ensure
   the aircraft is not descending during the maneuver.       WARNING: Practicing defensive
   threat maneuvering does not constitute authority to deviate from limitations in the flight
   manual.
19.7. Collision Avoidance Operations.
   19.7.1. Operate the GCAS in the tactical mode (AUDIO ON or VISUAL ON) during non-
   TF low-level operations (RALT TF or dual terminal consent airdrops).
19.8. Tanker, Air-to-Air Refueling (HAAR/TAAR) Restrictions.
   19.8.1. Minimum equipment. An operational Air-to-Air TACAN is the minimum electronic
   equipment required to complete an electronic HAAR/TAAR.
   19.8.2. Minimum Safe Altitude (MSA). Heading and altitude must provide at least 1,000 ft
   of clearance above all obstacles within 5 NM of course to be flown in non-mountainous
   terrain, 2,000 ft of clearance in mountainous terrain.
   19.8.3. Minimum visibility for a visual rendezvous is 3 NM and 1 NM for electronic
   rendezvous.
   19.8.4. Unless directed otherwise by a specific exercise operations order/plan, in
   contingencies, or during emergency fuel situations, communication capability between
   tankers and receivers will be maintained during all normal rendezvous and air refueling
   operations. Voice transmissions, however, will be IAW the emission option used.
   19.8.5. Unplanned HAAR/TAAR tracks will be coordinated between tanker and receiver to
   ensure adequate in-flight mission planning and terrain clearance. Crews will compute and
   relay MSA and recommended refueling altitude prior to join-up on any unplanned
   HAAR/TAAR track.
   19.8.6. A loadmaster will be positioned at each paratroop door, or on each side of the ramp
   when refueling with ramp and door open.
   19.8.7. Unless an emergency fuel condition exists, receiver crews will not attempt probe to
   drogue contact in a turn at night. Once in contact, turns are permitted.
19.9. Radar Trail Procedures.
   19.9.1. Type and Size. Radar trail formation is normally flown in two or three ship
   elements, with each successive element separated by one minute. The squadron CC/DO may
   authorize 20 second spacing between elements for phases of the mission where reduced
   separation is required.
   19.9.2. Weather Minimums. For takeoff and landings as a formation, weather in the
   terminal area should allow for VMC operations; however, if required, minimum visibility is
   1 SM (RVR 0500). IMC rejoins or extended IMC flight is not authorized during training.
   Radar trail procedures may be used to penetrate IMC to regain VMC for mission
   accomplishment.
   19.9.3. Altitudes. Comply with Chapter 17 altitude restrictions. Threat Penetration is not
   authorized during peacetime in radar trail formation.
158                                               AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011


  19.9.4. Aircraft Lighting. If preceding aircraft have other than full external lighting, all
  crews will use NVGs. Formation and position lights set to dim, lower anticollision light and
  the IR rotating beacon on, are required for NVG formation operations in an ATC
  environment. Also, see AFI 11202V3 AFSOC Sup.
  19.9.5. Takeoff Intervals. For interval takeoffs, the minimum spacing is 15 seconds between
  aircraft. For simultaneous departures, aircraft separation must be at least 3,000 ft between
  aircraft. Lead must have at least 3,500 ft of useable runway for takeoff.
      19.9.5.1. Acceleration. Use a common reference for formation acceleration (e.g., time or
      geographic point). If elapsed time is used, begin timing when lead starts takeoff roll.
  19.9.6. En route Rejoin Procedures.
      19.9.6.1. General. No more than three aircraft will rejoin at the same geographic point.
      Plan to rejoin 30 seconds in trail then close to the briefed spacing (no closer than 20
      seconds).
      19.9.6.2. Rejoin Abort. If a crew determines they will miss their rejoin TOA by greater
      than 10 seconds, they will inform lead. The late aircraft will climb to a predetermined
      MSL altitude (threat allowing) and attempt to join the formation as soon as possible, but
      prior to the IP. Follow briefed instructions if proper formation position cannot be
      established prior to the IP. If any aircraft experiences aircraft/equipment problems just
      prior to the rejoin, they may elect to rejoin at the end of the formation or proceed to a
      suitable recovery airfield. Remaining aircraft within the formation will reposition as
      instructed by the formation leader to close the formation.
  19.9.7. En route Procedures.
      19.9.7.1. Airspeed/Groundspeed Changes. Airspeed and groundspeed changes should
      occur at the same geographic point referenced by a navigation reference point (NRP).
      Use timed spacing off of serial lead as a backup or when NRP is unavailable. This
      ensures proper timed spacing is maintained.
      19.9.7.2. Formation Positioning. Formation navigators will plan and brief the latest
      allowable time to a turn point and the subsequent actions to be taken if this time cannot
      be made. NOTE: Using PGM at high altitude will result in increased spacing due to the
      slant range computations. TA and weather (WX) presentations will reflect the actual
      aircraft in-trail position.   NOTE: During high level ops, formation aircraft may use
      autopilot to relieve crew task loading. Autopilot during low-level ops will not be used.
  19.9.8. Formation Airdrops. For visual formation airdrop spacing, see Chapter 17. Normal
  radar trail airdrop spacing is 20 second trend dot spacing for all high-speed and 50% flap
  setting drops. During contingencies, close-interval CDS/CRS airdrops may be flown using
  less than 30 second trend dot spacing with Group Commander/COMAFSOF approval. 30
  second trend dot spacing equates to the 6,000 ft spacing requirement outlined in Chapter 17.
  19.9.9. Formation Air Refueling. Lead aircraft is responsible for weather avoidance during
  the rendezvous until 0.5 NM from contact position. Any aircraft in the formation may advise
  the formation of inclement weather on the refueling track.

                         MC130P EMPLOYMENT PROCEDURES

20.1. General. This chapter describes the specific equipment requirements and restrictions for
MC130P Combat Shadow employment. It provides directives for aircraft employment and
operational procedures found in AFTTP 33.MC130, AFTTP 31., and other instructions. In the
case of any conflict between AFTTP and this regulation, AFI 112MC130V3 takes precedence.
20.2. Minimum Operating Equipment. Refer to Table 20.1, Tactical Operations, for
minimum tactical equipment. Aircrew experience level and the mission scenario may dictate
greater equipment requirements than those listed.

 Notes:
 1. Navigator‘s integrated display computer unit (IDCU) must be operational.
 2. Aircraft that do not meet this requirement are restricted to MSA or to the in-trail (directly
 behind lead, stacked high) position in a formation.
 3. If IDS is inoperative, must have SCNS G-I submode.
 4. IDS required for night overland penetrations.
 5. Must either have an operational radar or IDS for non-mountainous NVG LL.
 6. If refueling altitude is below 3,000 ft AGL.
   20.2.1. Degraded Systems Restrictions/Procedures. Degraded Systems Training (DST) is
   used to prepare crews to accomplish the mission simulating certain pieces of equipment
   inoperative (or intentionally turned off for emission control). Specifically, DST serves the
   purpose of training, via simulation of inoperative equipment. Designate DST route segments
160                                                 AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011


  during the route brief. DST will not be performed by inexperienced crews, and will be taken
  into consideration during the ORM assessment. The following restrictions and procedures
  are designed to maximize training and safety.
      20.2.1.1. DST Specific Restrictions:
      20.2.1.2. PICs will brief the equipment simulated as inoperative, aircrew coordination,
      crew duties, and disorientation/emergency procedures prior to flight.
      20.2.1.3. Visibility must be at least 5 SM in mountainous terrain.
      20.2.1.4. Illumination: Effective illumination must be greater than 10% or DST must be
      conducted between the forecasted hours of sunset and estimated end of nautical twilight
      (EENT). Effective illumination must be greater than 25% if a safety observer is not
      aboard IAW paragraph 20.2.1.9 Otherwise, DST may be conducted between the
      forecasted hours of sunset and EENT.
      20.2.1.5. Equipment/Personnel Requirements:
      20.2.1.6. Radar Altimeter. The aircraft‘s radar altimeter must be operational and on
      during the entire flight. Additionally, both pilot and navigator indicators must be fully
      functioning.
      20.2.1.7. Ground Mapping/Weather Radar. The radar must be fully functional before
      flight. The navigator will function check the radar periodically during DST NVG low-
      level operations to verify functionality. If at any time during the function check it is
      determined that the radar will not sufficiently provide terrain avoidance, DST operations
      will be discontinued. At this time tactical operations will revert to restrictions provided
      in Table 20.1.
      20.2.1.8. Navigation equipment. The SCNS INS or GPS must be operational and on
      during DST. A GPS moving map laptop with PFPS and DTED installed may be
      employed by the navigator. DTED coverage should encompass the planned flight area
      and data within 25 NM of all course centerline.
      20.2.1.9. Personnel: A mission qualified instructor pilot must be at the controls. A
      mission instructor/evaluator navigator must be on board. The instructor/evaluator
      navigator, if not manning the navigator position, will be acting in an instructor/evaluator
      capacity. Restriction: During NVG low-level radar denied DST operation, a second
      mission qualified navigator (or mission qualified pilot) will act as the safety observer, and
      will monitor the progress of the mission using NVGs. The scanner will wear NVGs and
      carry an additional low-level chart.
  20.2.2. Procedures:
      20.2.2.1. Single Radar Altimeter operations. For single radar altimeter operations the
      navigator‘s radar altimeter repeater only will be placed to off and the pilot monitoring
      and flight engineer will assume all responsibilities for radar altimeter altitude calls
      referencing the pilot‘s radar altimeter as directed by the PIC. Equipment/Personnel
      requirements must be met IAW paragraph 20.2.1.5
      20.2.2.2. Radar denied operations. The radar will be placed in the standby position
      during NVG low-level, radar denied operations in order to simulate an
AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011                                                              161


      inoperative/unavailable radar. A safety observer will be on board IAW paragraph
      20.2.1.9 Having the radar in standby will allow a quick transition to normal NVG low-
      level procedures during limited visibility or in emergency situations (inadvertent weather
      penetration, emergency climb, etc.). The navigator will turn on the radar any time cloud
      cover degrades effective illumination in flight. Equipment/Personnel requirements must
      be met IAW paragraph 20.2.1.5
      20.2.2.3. Simulated SCNS denied/degraded operations.               Simulated SCNS
      denial/degradation maybe accomplished during any phase of flight regardless of the
      illumination. Additionally, any crew position integrated display computer unit (IDCU)
      may be dimmed.          The crews primary navigational references become the
      copilots/navigator‘s charts and moving map PFPS. If any crew member becomes
      disoriented an immediate climb to ESA must be accomplished. Equipment/Personnel
      requirements must be met IAW paragraph 20.2.1.5
20.3. En route Operations.
   20.3.1. The pilot and copilot may share a single low-level chart during flight. If this option
   is used, both the pilot and copilot must participate in pre-mission route analysis using the
   single chart.
20.4. Airdrop Operations.
   20.4.1. SCNS Airdrop (AD)/Troop Jump (TJ) Computer-Manual Select Switch must be set
   to AD/TJ manual.
   20.4.2. The Radar Altimeter will be set to no lower than 50 ft below planned drop altitude
   EXCEPTION: High Altitude Airdrops.
   20.4.3. High-speed operations with the paratroop doors open will not be accomplished
   during training missions.
   20.4.4. A maximum of six static line parachutists may be deployed out a paratroop door that
   has a Benson tank installed on that side. Consideration should be given to the amount of
   equipment each parachutist will carry.
   20.4.5. IMC Air Drops.
      20.4.5.1. IMC Airdrop Procedures. The following procedures may be practiced in VMC.
      IMC airdrop from the MC130P requires OG/CC approval.
      20.4.5.2. IMC Drop Altitude. Fly minimum IMC drop altitudes at 500 ft above the
      highest obstruction to flight (man-made obstruction, terrain feature, or spot elevation), or
      400 ft plus one contour interval above the highest depicted terrain contour, whichever is
      highest, within 3 NM either side of the run-in centerline from DZ entry point to DZ exit
      point or as specified in AFI 11231, whichever is higher. The IMC drop altitude may be
      segmented per AFTTP 33.MC130(U).
      20.4.5.3. DZ Entry Point. Formation descent will not begin until the last aircraft is at or
      past the DZ entry point. The DZ entry point is a fixed point on DZ run-in course where
      an aircraft or formation of aircraft may safely begin descent from IMC en route altitude
      to IMC drop altitude. The DZ entry point is a maximum of 40 NM prior to the DZ exit
      point according to Federal Aviation Administration FAR exemption 4371C. Formation
 162                                                AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011


       descent will not begin until the last aircraft in the formation is at or past the DZ entry
       point.
       20.4.5.4. DZ Exit Point. The DZ exit point is a fixed point on the DZ escape flight path
       centerline, established during pre-mission planning, at which the formation will be at the
       minimum IMC en route altitude. Calculate the exit point based upon three-engine
       performance at airdrop gross weight. This point will be planned no less than 4 NM track
       distance beyond the DZ trailing edge.
       20.4.5.5. Earliest Descent Point (EDP). The earliest descent point is the earliest point on
       the DZ run-in course where the lead aircraft may begin IMC descent to IMC drop altitude
       and be assured of terrain clearance for the entire formation. Compute EDP by subtracting
       formation length from the computed DZ entry point.
       20.4.5.6. In IMC, drop clearance is confirmed via radio call or beacon acquisition.
       20.4.5.7. To position the aircraft accurately at the release point, use the following
       pilot/navigator procedures:
       20.4.5.8. Upon departing the IP (or the slowdown point if one is programmed), the LN
       and pilots will confirm that the Airdrop leg and sensitive steering are active. Normally
       navigate to the DZ using SCNS guidance. Once on final run-in course, position updates
       will correct steering information supplied to the flight directors. The LN will confirm LZ
       alignment with radar and IDS if available and provide final headings off steering if
       required. The pilot flying will steer to the CARP/HARP using the flight director system
       or follow the navigator's headings. The LN will confirm SCNS position using
       preplanned update points and provide corrections if required. Normally, the LN will
       provide course guidance, distance to go, and drift information approximately every mile
       during the run-in. The RN must be prepared at any time along the run-in to assume
       navigation, make all required calls, and accomplish the drop visually using NVGs if
       capable.
       20.4.5.9. At the release point: The pilot monitoring and the LN will confirm the aircraft
       is positioned within the pre-briefed visual safety box during VMC operations. Both
       pilots and both navigators will confirm the aircraft is positioned within the pre-briefed
       IMC safety box (i.e., ± 200 yds, ± 3 secs) for IMC operations.
20.5. SCA Procedures.
   20.5.1. IMC SCA Procedures. The following procedures may be practiced in VMC. IMC
   SCAs require OG/CC approval.
   20.5.2. Ensure the radar is operational, no less than a GPS of FOM-2, and a system update
   and altimeter update are conducted within 10 minutes of starting the IMC SCA.
   20.5.3. IMC SCA Altitude. Fly minimum IMC SCA altitudes at 500 ft above the highest
   obstruction to flight within 2 NM either side of the run-in centerline from 10 NM or IP to
   Begin Descent point whichever is closer to the LZ. The IMC SCA altitude may be
   segmented.
   20.5.4. Crew Duties.
AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011                                                            163


     20.5.4.1. The pilot flying will steer to the LZ using the flight director system or follow
     the navigator's headings. The LN will confirm SCNS position using preplanned update
     points and provide corrections if required. The right navigator will confirm LZ centerline
     alignment on short final using all available means and correct aircraft alignment if
     required.
     20.5.4.2. The navigator will determine the most accurate altimeter setting for the LZ
     using all available sources including GPS, weather forecasts, ground station reporting and
     altitude calibration, as available. Normally, navigate to the LZ using SCNS guidance.
     Once on final run-in course, position updates will correct steering information supplied to
     the flight directors.
     20.5.4.3. The flight engineer will have NVGs ready for immediate use. The PM will
     back up the PF on the instruments/displays and confirm terrain clearance using all means
     available. The PM and flight engineer will clear for obstacles and other traffic.
  20.5.5. At the Initial Point.
     20.5.5.1. The left navigator will make distance calls at every mile inside ten miles and
     every half mile inside three miles (or as briefed).
     20.5.5.2. The left navigator will confirm LZ alignment with radar and IDS and give final
     headings as required.
  20.5.6. Slowdown.
     20.5.6.1. Slowdown should be initiated approximately 3 NM prior to the planned glide
     slope intercept point. The navigator will initiate the slowdown.
     20.5.6.2. Do not slow to threshold speed until established on final for both straight-in
     and turning SCAs. For turning SCAs, maintain 140 KIAS or approach speed whichever
     is higher in the turn. Once the slowdown is initiated, no further airspeed corrections for
     TOA control should be made.
  20.5.7. Altimeters. Radar altimeters should remain set at en route altitude setting until
  slowdown. Once slowdown is initiated, the radar altimeters may be reset as briefed. The left
  navigator will set 300 ft to guard against shallow glide slopes. WARNING: The obstacle
  clearance procedures in this chapter are not applicable to NVG operations conducted in a
  visual pattern. The pilot must maintain visual contact with the LZ and with surrounding
  terrain in order to execute a successful approach.
  20.5.8. Approaching Glide slope Intercept.
     20.5.8.1. Approaching glide slope intercept, the navigator will confirm the accuracy of
     the barometric altimeter setting by comparing actual AGL and MSL altitudes with those
     depicted on the SCA template. WARNING: The navigator will verify that the actual
     aircraft position is inside the planned SCA obstacle template prior to initiating descent.
     20.5.8.2. Glide slope Intercept. The pilot flying will begin descent upon navigator
     direction unless directed otherwise by the navigator, pilot, or flight engineer. The pilot
     flying will not descend the aircraft below MSL MDA. WARNING: The PM, LN, and
     RN must closely monitor radar altimeters to ensure accuracy of altimeter settings to
     prevent inadvertently flying below planned AGL minimums.
164                                                 AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011


      20.5.8.3. At glide slope intercept the left navigator will state ―Begin Descent‖ and repeat
      the desired initial descent rate. The left navigator, backed up by the RN, will provide
      glidepath advisories referenced from navigator‘s pressure and radar altimeters backed up
      by SCNS. These calls will be made at ½ NM intervals until reaching the ―100 Ft‖ or
      ―Minimums‖ call. State deviations in excess of 150 explicitly. The left navigator also
      advises the pilot if the aircraft is correcting to or diverging from glidepath and how
      rapidly if appropriate.
  20.5.9. Level Off/Minimums.
      20.5.9.1. Do not descend below MDA until the LZ environment is identified visually and
      confirmed by both pilots. Whoever identifies the LZ first will call ―Zone In Sight,‖
      relative clock position and any discrepancies (i.e., lights out, etc.). Both pilots will then
      confirm the zone and cross-check the alignment for the proper heading.
      20.5.9.2. VMC SCA. Do not descend below 100 ft until the touchdown zone is visually
      identified and confirmed by both pilots.
      20.5.9.3. IMC SCA. Do not descend below 300 ft until the LZ environment is positively
      identified on the IDS. Do not descend below 200 ft until the LZ environment is visually
      identified and confirmed by both pilots.
  20.5.10. Visual Acquisition of the LZ.
      20.5.10.1. The flight engineer will assist in field acquisition and visually check the LZ is
      clear.
      20.5.10.2. Aircraft lighting will be as briefed/directed by ground parties for
      authentication purposes. The use of covert lighting will be thoroughly briefed in respect
      to threat, runway environment, and authentication procedures.
  20.5.11. After Touchdown. The copilot and flight engineer will assist the pilot in locating
  the off-load/onload point once taxi speed is reached and clear for other aircraft and
  obstructions. If the pilot makes the landing from the right seat, the pilot in the left seat will
  be prepared to assume aircraft control once taxi speed is reached.
  20.5.12. Go-Around Procedures.
      20.5.12.1. The left navigator calls ―Missed Approach Point‖ at zero to go on the SCNS
      and repeat the terrain clearance altitude (e.g., MSL altitude, pattern altitude, etc.), the
      initial heading, and will call altitudes climbing through from 50 ft to 200 ft AGL (i.e., 50,
      100, 150, 200) if a go-around is executed.
      20.5.12.2. The flight engineer will monitor engine instruments, airspeed, altitude, rate of
      climb, configuration, and terrain clearance.
      20.5.12.3. Immediate Landing Feasible. The pilot will state "Go-Around, Immediate
      Landing Feasible." After establishing a safe climb, the pilot flying will direct the flaps
      set to 50%. The pilot flying will call for 100% flaps before or after rolling off the perch
      and call for the appropriate checklist. The engineer will pick up the checklist by
      reconfirming the landing gear position and accomplishing the remaining items of the
      checklist. Maintain 140 KIAS or approach speed, whichever is higher until established
      on final.
AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011                                                               165


          20.5.12.3.1. This maneuver should only require the movement of flaps and landing
          light switches. If any other change in configuration is accomplished, then the entire
          checklist will be used.
   20.5.13. Takeoff Procedures.
      20.5.13.1. Accomplish the ON THE RUNWAY portion of the INFIL/EXFIL checklist.
      If a visual pattern or turning SCA back to the LZ is to be accomplished, use the ON THE
      RUNWAY touch and go steps of the INFIL/EXFIL checklist, if desired. Use the normal
      checklist procedures IAW applicable T.O. 1C130(MDS)-1, when not using the
      INFIL/EXFIL checklist.
      20.5.13.2. The navigator will provide a departure heading, altitude, and terrain
      considerations.
      20.5.13.3. The pilot flying will make the takeoff wearing NVGs. The pilot monitoring
      will wear NVGs and be prepared to fly the planned departure on NVGs or transition to
      instruments and fly the navigator‘s directions in the event of NVG failure.
      20.5.13.4. Use IR taxi and landing lights to the minimum extent required to maintain
      visual references during takeoff roll. Interior lighting is the same as for the approach and
      landing. The flight engineer will clear the LZ for obstacles.
      20.5.13.5. Use normal takeoff performance unless max effort performance is required.
      At refusal speed, the copilot calls "Go." At takeoff speed, the copilot calls "Rotate." If
      takeoff and refusal speed are equal, the copilot will call "Go."
      20.5.13.6. At takeoff speed, the pilot will rotate the aircraft to establish a positive climb
      rate. The copilot checks the pitch attitude and will raise the landing gear on the
      command of the pilot after ensuring a positive rate of climb. The flight engineer will
      back up the pilot using NVGs during climb out. The copilot may take control of the
      aircraft if directed by the pilot and continue the climb out to the egress route altitude.
      The pilot flying directs the accomplishment of the appropriate AFTER TAKEOFF
      checklist.
      20.5.13.7. The left navigator will advise the pilots of the initial on course heading and
      call altitudes climbing through from 100, 200, and 300 ft AGL.
      20.5.13.8. As soon as conditions permit, the loadmaster will check equipment restraint
      and condition/needs of the onboard user.
20.6. Tanker (HAAR/TAAR)-Receiver Air Refueling.
   20.6.1. The pilot in control of the airplane during air refueling operations with the autopilot
   engaged will keep one hand on the control column and the other hand available for
   immediate throttle operation, in order that prompt action can be taken in the event of an
   autopilot malfunction.
20.7. Formation Restrictions.
   20.7.1. Rejoins. Minimum altitude for rejoin is 500 ft AGL.
   20.7.2. En route. Minimum lateral spacing is 200 ft for visual formation, 1 NM for radar
   trail.

                                           Chapter 21

                         MC130W EMPLOYMENT PROCEDURES

21.1. General. This attachment describes the specific equipment requirements, training
restrictions, and regulatory guidance for MC130W Combat Spear employment. This chapter is
not a stand-alone reference and should be used in conjunction with the rest of this instruction, the
AFTTP series, and other directives. In the case of any conflict between the AFTTP series and
this instruction, this instruction takes precedence.
   21.1.1. Terminology. Joint terminology will be used for mission planning and execution.
   Crew members will have a working knowledge of the information contained in the following
   publications: JP 303, Doctrine for Joint Interdiction Operations; JP 309.1, Joint Laser
   Designation Procedures (JLaser); JP 309.3, Joint Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for
   Close Air Support (CAS). Crew members will also maintain a working knowledge of
   AFTTP(I) 32.6, JFIRE, Multi-Service Tactics, Techniques, And Procedures For The Joint
   Application Of Firepower (JFIRE).
   21.1.2. Control of Classified Information and Materials. It is the responsibility of every
   crew member to control the classified material they use. This includes maps/charts with
   target coordinates, friendly positions, battle lines, or threat positions drawn on them. Most
   imagery, target lists, Command Electronic Order Information (CEOI), SPINS, rules of
   engagement (ROE), and strike data are classified and must be controlled and handled as such.
   Imagery from the sensor systems that has been recorded must be handled IAW the
   appropriate security classification guide.
21.2. Aircrew Complement. Information in this section augments the guidance provided in
Chapter 3 of this instruction. MC130W aircrew complement for basic and mission sorties will
be IAW Table 21.1 and the following:
   21.2.1. Pilots. When required, supervision for 30MM and SOPGM live/dry-fire operations
   may be accomplished by a standing instructor provided both seats are occupied by at least
   basic qualified pilots.
   21.2.2. Navigator and CSO.
       21.2.2.1. Unit/mission commanders may authorize local basic flights without a navigator
       when not required for mission accomplishment.
       21.2.2.2. A single navigator may be considered a full mission complement for all
       mobility events.
       21.2.2.3. For AAR and HALO only the navigator or CSO performing the event needs to
       be certified in the event.
       21.2.2.4. On local training sorties, maximum effort and NVG takeoffs and landings
       conducted from the VFR pattern, tactical recoveries (excluding SCAs), and FARP may
       be accomplished without a navigator or CSO onboard.
       21.2.2.5. Unit/mission commanders may authorize local mission training flights without
       a CSO when manning or systems limitations dictate. In this case, live fire operations
       (30MM or SOPGM) are not authorized.
AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011                                                             167


      21.2.2.6. MOP supervision. A noncurrent navigator or CSO may be supervised by an
      instructor occupying the other MOP position. An unqualified navigator or CSO requires
      a standing instructor. If both the navigator and CSO are unqualified, two standing
      instructors are required.
   21.2.3. Loadmasters.
      21.2.3.1. Two LMs or one LM and another qualified crew member are required when 40
      or more passengers are being carried (except during contingencies and unit moves). Both
      crew members must remain in the cargo compartment.
      21.2.3.2. Two LMs are required on all mission sorties with the following exceptions:
          21.2.3.2.1. On personnel airdrops if only one paratroop door will be opened or when
          performing free-fall drops below 13,000 ft MSL.
          21.2.3.2.2. Non-tactical on/off-load of equipment or personnel.
          21.2.3.2.3. During hot refuel/FARP receiver operations (LM will perform panel
          operator duties).
          21.2.3.2.4. One instructor and two students are considered full mission complement
          on local training sorties.
          21.2.3.2.5. When approved by unit/mission commanders, armed overwatch local
          training sorties may be conducted with a single LM. In this case, live fire operations
          (30MM or SOPGM) are not authorized.
   21.2.4. Direct Support Operator. DSOs are added to the crew as required.

Notes:
1. The navigator‘s IDCU must be operational.
2. During local VFR pattern training only the pilots‘ radar altimeters are required.
3. If both sensors are inoperative, must have SCNS G-I sub-mode.
4. Not required for airdrops above 3,000 ft AGL.
5. Coarse/Acquisition Miniaturized Integrated GPS/INS Tactical System (C-MIGITS).
6. Advanced Tactical Navigation (ATACNAV) inertial navigation unit.
7. Need at least one operative sensor with an operative laser designator.
  21.3.1. Degraded Systems Training. DST is used to prepare crews to accomplish the
  mission simulating certain pieces of equipment inoperative or intentionally turned off for
  emission control.
      21.3.1.1. The equipment simulated as inoperative, aircrew coordination, crew duties, and
      disorientation/emergency procedures will be briefed prior to flight.
      21.3.1.2. For terminal area operations in mountainous terrain, visibility must be at least 5
      SM, and the pilot and navigator radar altimeters must be operational and on.
      21.3.1.3. During SCNS degraded operations the radar must remain operational and on.
      21.3.1.4. A mission instructor must be in either a pilot or navigator/CSO position.
      21.3.1.5. The SCNS INS or GPS must be operational and on during DST. IDCUs and
      flight director mode switches can be positioned to simulate the INS and/or GPS
      inoperative.
      21.3.1.6. DST Procedures.
         21.3.1.6.1. Radar denied operations. The radar will be placed in the standby position
         to simulate an inoperative/unavailable radar. Having the radar in standby will allow a
         quick return to normal procedures during limited visibility or in emergency situations
         (inadvertent weather penetration, emergency climb, etc.). When operating at low
         altitude, do not place the radar in standby if cloud cover degrades effective
         illumination.
         21.3.1.6.2. SCNS degraded operations. Simulated SCNS degradation may be
         accomplished during any phase of flight regardless of the illumination. The flight
         director mode switches can be positioned to simulate the INS and/or GPS inoperative
         or the navigator may select a degraded SCNS sub-mode via the IDCU. Additionally,
         any crew position IDCU may be dimmed. The crew‘s primary navigational
         references become the copilot/navigator charts, Brimstone, and moving map PFPS.
         21.3.1.6.3. C-MIGITS failure. Simulate C-MIGITS failure by turning it off. VMC
         required.
AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011                                                              169


21.4. Not Used.
21.5. En route Operations.
   21.5.1. Operations below 3,000 ft AGL are considered low-level operations. Crews will
   comply with all applicable low-level procedures and restrictions given in Chapter 17.
   21.5.2. Altimeter Updates.     Update locations will be briefed during route study and
   verbalized in-flight.
   21.5.3. Radar Altimeter. During armed overwatch, radar altimeters will be set per crew
   discretion but should not be lower than 3,000 ft.
   21.5.4. GCAS. Normal mode (audio and visual on) will be used during armed overwatch.
   21.5.5. ETCAS. Use the Above, below, and Normal settings as appropriate for the phase of
   flight and mission. The Below setting should be used for tactical descents.
21.6. SCA.
   21.6.1. SCAs are used to place the aircraft on final approach, properly configured, in a
   position to identify the landing area and complete a landing. SCAs are performed using the
   INFIL/EXFIL checklist. The FE reads the INFIL/EXFIL checklist. When the tactical
   situation dictates flying an instrument approach while utilizing the INFIL/EXFIL checklist,
   ensure all briefing items from Step 2 of the normal DESCENT checklist are covered in the
   crew briefing during the ENROUTE portion of the INFIL/EXFIL checklist.
   21.6.2. Order of Battle (OB) Analysis. The enemy OB (actual or simulated) is the most
   important factor in determining the route of flight to and from the LZ, including the location
   of the initial point (IP). Plan a minimum 10 NM straight-in approach unless prohibited by
   the OB. The type and direction of recovery should be varied (threat and airspace permitting)
   to avoid a predictable recovery pattern from day–to-day.
   21.6.3. Plan to intercept a 3-degree glide slope no later than one mile from touchdown unless
   terrain or obstructions dictate otherwise.
   21.6.4. A full SCA plate for the landing runway is required. The navigator will construct an
   approach plate using the SCA Creator 3.1, AF Form 4118, or an OGV-approved planning
   form. Copilots will carry plates for all preplanned SCAs.
   21.6.5. Chart Preparation. Use the largest scale chart available from 10 NM inbound. A
   1:50,000 chart is preferred, but in no case will it be smaller than 1:250,000. The navigator
   will select update points for the SCNS and altimeter. Charts will include the following items:
   IP; slowdown point; descent point; and the missed approach, departure, and go-around paths.
   Ensure update points for the SCNS and altimeter are annotated. It is of utmost importance to
   have sufficient, reliable position and altitude update points prior to the IP and final run-in.
   21.6.6. SCA Procedures.
      21.6.6.1. These procedures are based on the copilot flying the SCA and the pilot
      assuming control for the landing. During NVG operations, an NVG landing qualified
      pilot (non-instructor) or copilot may takeoff and land from the right seat provided an
      NVG landing qualified pilot is in the left seat and normal (non-assault) procedures are
      used. In this case, either pilot may fly the NVG SCA, with the other pilot accomplishing
170                                                AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011


      the landing/takeoff. Refer to Chapter 9 for touch and go restrictions. Instructor pilots
      may fly the entire approach and make the landing for demonstration purposes. For
      approaches and landings not requiring NVGs (day operations or overt night operations to
      lighted runways) either the pilot or copilot may fly the approach and accomplish the
      landing. EXCEPTION: Mission qualified instructor pilots may perform maximum
      effort landings/takeoffs from the right seat.
      21.6.6.2. SCA Coordination. During training missions with no onboard user involved,
      the PIC will determine and brief the time warnings (60-, 30-, 20-10-, 6-, and 1-minute)
      required for the mission. The pilot and navigator will brief the SCA using the appropriate
      aircrew mission briefing guide during the ENROUTE portion of the INFIL/EXFIL
      checklist. Additional briefing items may be added, as required, for the particular mission.
      NOTE: During training missions with no onboard user, time warnings may be deleted
      during multiple approaches. When an onboard user is involved, time warnings may be
      compressed with user concurrence.
      21.6.6.3. Twenty Minutes Prior to Landing.
         21.6.6.3.1. The navigator will determine the most accurate QNH altimeter setting for
         the LZ using all available sources including GPS, weather forecasts, ground station
         reporting, and altitude update, as available. Use this altimeter setting in SCNS.
         21.6.6.3.2. If required, the FE will close the blackout curtains and install eyebrow
         window curtains, and all crew members will set lighting for NVG operations.
         21.6.6.3.3. Each pilot will silently ensure both positions on their NVG battery packs
         are operational.
         21.6.6.3.4. Landing light usage will be briefed in the pre-mission brief and during the
         INFIL/EXFIL ENROUTE checklist.
         21.6.6.3.5. The copilot will check the LZ data in SCNS using approved sources (the
         SCA plate, Form 70, Pilot’s Flight Plan and Flight Log, and FLIP approach plate if
         available). NOTE: At least one pilot will monitor the SCNS airborne radar approach
         (ARA) page for glide slope cross-check. NOTE: Terrain permitting, at the IP the
         navigator will sequence steering to the approach leg in order to roll out on final
         course guidance without overshooting. Once on final approach, position updates will
         correct steering information supplied to the flight directors.
      21.6.6.4. Slowdown Procedures. Approximately 3 NM prior to the planned glide slope
      intercept point, the navigator will initiate the slowdown by stating "Slowdown,
      Slowdown, Now." Once the slowdown is initiated, no further reduction in airspeed for
      TOA control should be made.
         21.6.6.4.1. The pilots and navigator will set their radar altimeters to the MDA
         (HAT).
         21.6.6.4.2. The PF will slow the aircraft to no less than normal 50% threshold speed,
         configure the flaps and gear as airspeed permits, and call for the appropriate checklist.
         The PF will call for 100% flaps as airspeed permits and slow to normal or max effort
         threshold speed.
AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011                                                           171


        21.6.6.4.3. The FE will state ―Tracking‖ once cleared for 50% flaps. When the flaps
        reach 50% and airspeed passes 165 KIAS the FE will state ―Landing Gear‖. As soon
        as gear is down the FE will state ―Gear Down, Flaps‖ and standby for clearance to set
        flaps to 100%. Upon receiving clearance to move flaps, the FE will state ―Tracking‖
        and resume the INFIL/EXFIL BEFORE LANDING checklist at Step 3, ―Landing
        Gear.‖
        21.6.6.4.4. The FE will check that the gear is down and flaps are set as required and
        verify the hydraulic panel is set to the proper configuration. When the FE calls
        ―Landing Light Panel‖ the FE will verify the landing lights are extended and off or as
        briefed. NOTE: When slowdowns are initiated further out than 3 NM prior to glide
        slope intercept, consider maintaining 140 KIAS (or approach speed, whichever is
        higher) and delaying the call for 100% flaps until 1 NM prior to glide slope intercept.
     21.6.6.5. Glide Slope Intercept.
        21.6.6.5.1. Approaching glide slope intercept, the navigator will confirm the
        accuracy of the barometric altimeter setting by comparing actual AGL and MSL
        altitudes with those depicted on the SCA template. WARNING: The navigator will
        verify that the actual aircraft position is inside the planned SCA obstacle template
        prior to initiating descent.
        21.6.6.5.2. At 50 ft below glide slope intercept, the navigator will state "Begin
        Descent," and repeat the desired initial descent rate. The navigator will monitor glide
        slope deviation using the SCNS ARA display and provide glidepath advisories with
        reference to the SCNS, the navigator‘s pressure altimeter, and the radar altimeter.
        The navigator will report deviations greater than 50 ft along with an advisory as to
        whether the aircraft is correcting to, paralleling, or diverging from glide path or
        course. The PM will back up the PF on the SCNS/instrument displays and ensure the
        M1 sensor is selected on the 9 inch monitor to aid in visually identifying the LZ. The
        CSO will back up the navigator on all required calls and aid in visual acquisition of
        the LZ.
        21.6.6.5.3. When the navigator calls ―1 Minute‖ or ―2 Miles‖ the LM will notify
        cargo compartment personnel that there is ―1 Minute‖ to landing.
        21.6.6.5.4. The PF will descend following the navigator‘s direction and the SCNS
        ARA information.
            21.6.6.5.4.1. VMC SCA. Do not descend below 100 ft until the touchdown zone
            is visually identified and confirmed by both pilots.
            21.6.6.5.4.2. IMC SCA. Do not descend below 300 ft until the LZ environment
            is positively identified on M1 or M2 sensor. Do not descend below 200 ft until
            the LZ environment is visually identified and confirmed by both pilots.
        21.6.6.5.5. The navigator, backed up by the PM, will advise the crew at 100 ft above
        MDA and at MDA by stating ―100 Above‖ and ―Minimums.‖ The PF will
        acknowledge the call and level the aircraft at MDA. Execute a go-around if the
        runway is not in sight at the MAP or if a safe landing cannot be made.
172                                                AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011


         21.6.6.5.6. When the navigator calls ―Minimums‖ the LM will notify cargo
         compartment personnel to "Prepare to Land."
         21.6.6.5.7. The CSO will verify that the runway has been correctly identified and is
         clear of obstructions using the M1 or M2 sensor prior to reaching runway threshold.
         CAUTION: The M2 sensor will be stowed prior to touchdown. Both sensors will
         remain powered on for landing.
      21.6.6.6. Visual Acquisition of the LZ (usually within 2 NM).
         21.6.6.6.1. The first crew member to identify the LZ will call ―Runway In Sight‖ and
         give the clock position and any discrepancies noted (i.e., any lights out, etc.).
         21.6.6.6.2. The PM, upon visual acquisition of the LZ states ―Runway In Sight‖ and
         may direct the copilot to the LZ (remain above MDA) or may maneuver the aircraft
         to LZ alignment. The PM will ensure that the PF and navigator understand that the
         PM has taken over the responsibility for directing the aircraft.
         21.6.6.6.3. The FE should verbally clear the LZ by stating ―Runway In Sight,
         Runway Appears Clear‖ if duties allow.
         21.6.6.6.4. At the ―100 Above‖ call, the FE will state ―Lights‖ and the PM will state
         ―On‖ or as briefed.
         21.6.6.6.5. Transfer of aircraft control for the landing may occur anytime after the
         landing pilot has positively identified the touchdown point.
         21.6.6.6.6. After the transfer, the PM will monitor airspeed, descent rate, and bank
         angle. The PM will advise the PF if descent rate exceeds 1,000 FPM (or as briefed
         for a steeper glide slope) or if bank angle exceeds 15 degrees. The navigator will
         monitor the radar altimeter and glide slope and will notify the pilot of deviations
         greater than 50 ft along with an advisory as to whether the aircraft is correcting to,
         paralleling, or diverging from glide slope.
         21.6.6.6.7. No later than 100 ft AGL, the navigator will begin to provide HAT calls.
         Each HAT call will be followed by an airspeed call from the PM. The navigator will
         provide a 10 ft call.
      21.6.6.7. After Touchdown.
         21.6.6.7.1. All available crew members will assist the pilots in scanning during
         ground operations. Upon reaching a safe taxi speed the M2 sensor can be returned to
         normal operations to assist in scanning.
         21.6.6.7.2. When the aircraft is stopped at the on/off-load location, the pilot will give
         the LM clearance by stating "Clear To On/Off-load." Dim interior NVG lighting
         when practical. If the flight deck and cargo compartment curtains are drawn, the
         navigator may maintain sensor/IDCU video for follow-on flight planning. Do not
         move the aircraft until the LM calls "Clear To Taxi." When there is a delay in the
         on/off-load or an extended ground time is anticipated, raise the ramp approximately
         12 inches above the ground so the aircraft can taxi in the event of an emergency.
         21.6.6.7.3. The departure airfield control officer (DACO) should not clear personnel
         or equipment to board the aircraft until cleared by the LM. Vehicles will be driven
AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011                                                          173


        onto the aircraft. The LM will coordinate with the DACO to confirm that all
        personnel and equipment are aboard and onload is complete.
        21.6.6.7.4. Touch and go operations are authorized during INFIL/EXFIL operations
        with or without the use of NVGs. Complete the BEFORE LANDING portion of the
        INFIL/EXFIL checklist on the initial approach to the runway and transition to the ON
        THE RUNWAY touch and go steps of the INFIL/EXFIL checklist after touchdown.
        After the first touch and go, the touch and go steps of the INFIL/EXFIL checklist
        (* items) may be used. The crew will continue using normal SCA approach and
        landing procedures. The navigator may make calls as briefed by the PIC during
        visual patterns when established on downwind and the AFTER TAKEOFF touch and
        go steps of the INFIL/EXFIL checklist are complete. Time warnings are not
        required. Complete the full AFTER TAKEOFF portion of the INFIL/EXFIL
        checklist on the last departure from the airfield. WARNING: The obstacle clearance
        procedures in this chapter are not applicable to NVG operations conducted in a visual
        pattern. When conducting a visual pattern, the pilots must maintain visual contact
        with the LZ and with surrounding terrain in order to execute a successful approach.
     21.6.6.8. Go-around Procedures.
        21.6.6.8.1. General. Do not descend below the MDA until the LZ is in sight and the
        landing pilot has taken control of the aircraft (if required). A go-around is required
        when the LZ is not in sight at the MAP (SCNS distance-to-go is zero or as briefed by
        the navigator) or a safe landing cannot be made. If landing is desired, the crew may
        fly a visual pattern back to landing (Immediate Landing Feasible) or proceed to the IP
        for another approach.
        21.6.6.8.2. The navigator will advise the pilots upon arrival at the MAP and repeat
        the MSL altitude and initial heading required and will call altitudes during the climb
        until above cruise altitude. The navigator will call every 50 ft to 300 ft AGL, then
        every 100 ft until ―lights out.‖
        21.6.6.8.3. The FE will back up the pilots on engine instruments, airspeed, altitude,
        rate of climb, configuration, and terrain clearance.
        21.6.6.8.4. Immediate Landing Feasible. The PF will state "Immediate Landing
        Feasible." After establishing a safe climb, the PF will direct the flaps set to 50%.
        Once the go-around is established, the pilot closest to the runway will normally fly
        the pattern. The landing pilot may take control of the aircraft at any time. The PF
        will call for 100% flaps before or after rolling off the perch and call for the
        INFIL/EXFIL BEFORE LANDING checklist. The FE will resume the checklist at
        Step 2. The CSO will use available sensors to increase the crew‘s situational
        awareness by providing clock position and distance calls to the runway as well as aid
        in terrain/obstacle avoidance. CAUTION: Pilots are more susceptible to spatial
        disorientation during NVG go-arounds and departures.
     21.6.6.9. Takeoff Procedures
        21.6.6.9.1. Accomplish the ON THE RUNWAY portion of the INFIL/EXFIL
        checklist. If a visual pattern back to the LZ is to be accomplished, use the ON THE
        RUNWAY touch and go steps of the INFIL/EXFIL checklist, if desired. Use the
 174                                                AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011


          normal checklist procedures IAW T.O. 1C130(M)W1, Section II, when not using the
          INFIL/EXFIL checklist procedures.
          21.6.6.9.2. The navigator will provide a departure briefing including: heading,
          altitude, terrain and obstacles. CAUTION: The M2 sensor will be stowed for
          takeoff. It can be returned to normal operation when airborne.
          21.6.6.9.3. Lighting will be configured as required by the tactical situation.
       21.6.6.10. Loss of NVGs:
          21.6.6.10.1. On Approach. If the PF or PM lose use of their NVGs inside of 1 NM,
          perform a go-around or as briefed. If the FE loses use of NVGs, land at the discretion
          of the PIC.
          21.6.6.10.2. On the Ground. The pilots will transfer aircraft controls and continue
          takeoff/landing roll or reject as briefed. The FE will be prepared to turn on overt
          lighting at the direction of the PIC in the event of NVG failure during takeoff or
          landing roll.
          21.6.6.10.3. After takeoff. Continue the climb out and follow the appropriate
          procedures for loss of NVGs.
21.7. Tactical Recovery.
   21.7.1. Tactical recoveries include the random steep, random shallow, overhead, and
   downwind. The approach and landing is a visual maneuver backed up with SCNS, sensors,
   and radar.
   21.7.2. Slowdown points will be planned and briefed for all tactical recoveries.
   21.7.3. Unless briefed otherwise, the PF will call the slowdown for all tactical recoveries.
21.8. High Altitude Airdrop.
   21.8.1. The MC130W conducts personnel military free-fall (MFF) high altitude low opening
   (HALO) and high altitude high opening (HAHO) airdrops in VMC or IMC.
   21.8.2. DZ Survey Review. The pilots, navigator, and CSO will review the point of impact
   (PI) location, DZ dimensions, 10-second warning location, airdrop safety box, and prominent
   DZ features.
   21.8.3. Airdrop Computations. During mission planning, the navigator will compute a
   HARP using AF Form 4015, AF Form 4017, or approved computer-aided HARP program.
   Both the navigator and CSO will verify the results. At the aircraft, the navigator will verify
   the actual number of jumpers and parachute type matches the planned HARP data.
   21.8.4. IMC Drop Altitude. The minimum IMC drop altitude is 500 ft above the highest
   obstruction to flight (man-made obstruction, terrain feature, or spot elevation), or 400 ft plus
   one contour interval above the highest depicted terrain contour, whichever is highest, within
   3 NM either side of the run-in course or as specified in AFI 11231, whichever is higher. The
   IMC drop altitude may be segmented.
   21.8.5. Airdrop Procedures. The FE will run the airdrop checklists and operate the flaps.
AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011                                                            175


      21.8.5.1. Initial Point (IP). Terrain permitting, the navigator will sequence steering to
      the airdrop leg in order to roll out on final course guidance without overshooting.
          21.8.5.1.1. Departing the IP (or the slowdown point if one is programmed), the
          navigator and PM will confirm that the airdrop leg and sensitive steering are active.
          21.8.5.1.2. The navigator will confirm DZ alignment with radar. If on board, the
          CSO will confirm DZ alignment and DZ status using M1/M2.
          21.8.5.1.3. The navigator and PM will visually confirm SCNS position using
          preplanned visual update points and provide corrections if required. WARNING:
          The PF must be aware of paratroopers standing in the back and avoid abrupt pitch or
          bank changes after the Six Minute Advisory.
      21.8.5.2. Slowdown. Slowdown at a distance commensurate with the proficiency of
      crew, atmospheric conditions (pressure altitude and outside air temperature), and the
      threat environment.
          21.8.5.2.1. All controlled ETA procedures should be completed prior to reaching the
          slowdown point.
          21.8.5.2.2. After the navigator calls for the slowdown, the flying pilot will
          acknowledge the slowdown call and reduce the throttles (0-1,000 in-lbs of torque).
      21.8.5.3. Release point.
          21.8.5.3.1. During VMC operations, the PM and the navigator will confirm the
          aircraft is positioned within the pre-briefed VMC safety box.
          21.8.5.3.2. During IMC operations, both pilots and the navigator will confirm the
          aircraft is positioned within the pre-briefed IMC safety box.
      21.8.5.4. Escape. The navigator will call "Red Light" at the expiration of the usable DZ
      time or upon hearing the LM call "Load Clear," whichever occurs first.
          21.8.5.4.1. Begin the escape procedure no earlier than the ―Load Clear‖ call.
          21.8.5.4.2. After the paratroop doors and air deflectors are closed and the flaps have
          been reconfigured, the remainder of the COMPLETION OF DROP checklist may be
          deferred if required for threat avoidance.
   21.8.6. Airdrop malfunctions and Off-DZ airdrops. Reporting of airdrop malfunctions and
   off-DZ airdrops will be AFJI 13210 and AFI 13217. Local reporting procedures will be
   detailed in the group or unit supplement to this instruction.
21.9. Receiver Air-to-Air Refueling.
   21.9.1. Conduct IAW T.O. 1C130(M)W1 and ATP56(B).
   21.9.2. LAIRCM may be left in OPERATE mode during AAR.
21.10. Forward Area Refueling Point.
   21.10.1. The MC-130W will conduct single-point and two-point FARP operations without a
   forward area manifold (FAM) cart. Three-point FARP operations using a FAM cart will not
   normally be conducted.
 176                                                  AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011


   21.10.2. FARP planning and execution will be conducted IAW AFI 11235.
21.11. Armed Overwatch.
   21.11.1. Armed overwatch will be conducted using the PRECISION STRIKE MISSION
   checklist. During armed overwatch, the navigator repositions to the cargo compartment to
   perform primary crew duties on the MOP.
   21.11.2. OB Analysis. The CSO and navigator will coordinate with intelligence personnel to
   obtain a current and complete OB for the area of operations. Based on analysis of the OB,
   the CSO and navigator will ensure the planned route of flight minimizes aircraft exposure to
   the threat and the probability of detection.
   21.11.3. Chart Preparation. Use 1:50,000 (TLM) for all armed overwatch objective areas.
   Grid lines must be clearly displayed for accurate point annotation. A 10 NM MSA will be
   computed for every assigned objective area.
   21.11.4. Ground Operations.
       21.11.4.1. Landings (including touch and go) at jointuse or military fields with 30MM
       ammunition or SOPGM on board requires a letter of agreement on file between OGV, or
       COMAFSOF, and the airfield manager. Publish a list of approved fields in Chapter 10.
          21.11.4.1.1. If an emergency situation requires a full stop at the airfield, upon
          termination of the emergency, the PIC will attempt to ensure the aircraft is parked
          IAW Table 21.3 or as defined in the letter of agreement.
       21.11.4.2. Parking with Munitions. If required to park with munitions on board, comply
       with the separation distances given in Table 21.3 These separation distances are the
       minimum required between explosives loaded aircraft and any inhabited building,
       civilian aircraft, or civilian/joint use runway. All explosives-loaded aircraft should be
       parked in an approved, properly sited aircraft parking location if available.

 MC-130W operations.
 2. Includes maintenance facilities/structures; may be superseded by site survey results.
 3. Distance is measured from cargo bay to cargo bay when munitions are internal. IAW
 AFMAN 91-201, reduced separation requires written risk acceptance by the commander
 responsible for the aircraft.
       21.11.4.3. Emergency Procedures with Ammunition. Fire:
          21.11.4.3.1. Notify PIC/crew.
          21.11.4.3.2. Notify fire department.
AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011                                                            177


         21.11.4.3.3. Fight fire and remove munitions, if possible. Note time fire envelops
         munitions.
         21.11.4.3.4. All non-essential personnel will withdraw to 2,500 ft. Crew members
         fighting the fire will withdraw to 2,500 ft when fire envelops munitions, or after
         arrival of firefighters, whichever occurs first. If the Net Explosive Weight (NEW)
         exceeds 500 pounds with SOPGM on board, non-essential personnel must withdraw
         to 4,000 ft.
         21.11.4.3.5. With only division 1.3 munitions (markers and flares) on board, non-
         essential personnel must withdraw to 600 ft.        NOTE: Withdraw distance
         requirements are contained in AFMAN 91201.
  21.11.5. Crew Duties. General crew member responsibilities during armed overwatch:
     21.11.5.1. The PIC is primary on flying the aircraft and is the final authority on
     weapons/fuzing selection and weapons release parameters.
     21.11.5.2. The copilot is primary for SCNS operation and ATC, C2, and air stack
     communications.
     21.11.5.3. While stationed on the MOP, the navigator is primary for M1 sensor
     operations, ground party communications, weaponeering, and targeting.
     21.11.5.4. The CSO is primary for M2 sensor operations, ground party communications,
     CAS/on-station check-ins, battlefield SA and friendly position SA.
     21.11.5.5. Once the navigator transitions to the MOP, the FE assumes control of all flight
     deck navigator panel equipment and is primary for monitoring defensive systems.
     21.11.5.6. The LMs are primary for scanner duties and gun/SOPGM monitoring and
     operation, to include movement of SOPGMs between the storage rack and the cargo
     door.
  21.11.6. Prestrike Coordination.
     21.11.6.1. Accomplish the COMBAT ENTRY checklist prior to initiating the
     PRESTRIKE checklist. Mission timeline permitting, complete the PRESTRIKE
     checklist prior to reaching the objective area (restricted operating zone (ROZ), strike
     environment, etc.).
     21.11.6.2. During the PRESTRIKE checklist the navigator will give a navigation hand
     off briefing to the pilots and flight engineer. The briefing will cover: radar set up, SCNS
     settings, bullseye, steering, defensive system settings, MEA, MSA, and general situation
     (to include distances to ROZs or other SUA).
     21.11.6.3. Navigation. Once the navigator has transitioned to the MOP, the pilots and
     flight engineer are responsible for en route and tactical navigation. SCNS will be
     primary for en route navigation. Tactical navigation can be performed via Brimstone or
     SCNS.
         21.11.6.3.1. Brimstone will normally be the primary means of navigation within the
         tactical environment. The CSO will ensure the Brimstone airspace overlays are
         loaded in the system on the auxiliary computer. The copilot will pull the draw file up
 178                                                AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011


           on the copilot side monitor and, unless briefed otherwise, the pilot side monitor.
           Workload permitting, the copilot/FE should enter relevant tactical navigation points
           into SCNS throughout the mission. In the event of Brimstone degradation, the copilot
           or FE will input tactical navigation points into SCNS.
       21.11.6.4. Laser usage. Nominal ocular hazard distances (NOHD) are given in Table
       21.4

 2. Switchable wavelength laser subsystem (SWLS).
 WARNING: The Navigator/CSO will notify the crew prior to firing the MX-20HADD 1.06
 micron laser or MX-15Di CLDR. On training missions they will only be fired on laser-
 approved live-fire ranges. If ground parties are present they will be advised prior to lasing.

 WARNING: Loadmasters will not use binoculars during any lasing operations when weather
 is in close proximity to the aircraft or anytime the M2 is firing a non-eye-safe laser.

 NOTE: Aircrews will use J-Laser terminology to the maximum extent practical.

   21.11.7. Live-fire Operations.
       21.11.7.1. Maintain a minimum of 1,000 ft altitude separation from the highest known
       trajectory during combined live-fire operations with ground artillery, mortar, or
       helicopter fire.
       21.11.7.2. Danger Close distances are given in Table 21.5

Table 21.5. Danger Close Distances.

       21.11.7.3. Peacetime Restrictions. The following restrictions apply to all peacetime live-
       fire training missions. These restrictions do not apply anytime the GFC requests fire
       support under CJCSI 3121.10, Standing Rules of Engagement for U.S. Forces.
AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011                                                             179


           21.11.7.3.1. Minimum safe distances and ricochet fans are given in Table 21.6
           During training, fire no closer to ground parties than the minimum safe distance. If
           the ground party is located within the ricochet fan distance, use a no-fire zone to
           mitigate ricochet risk. The no-fire zone can be defined by radials from the target or
           (30MM only) by aircraft heading.
               21.11.7.3.1.1. No-fire radials are +/- 30 degrees from the friendly position to
               target bearing.
               21.11.7.3.1.2. To compute aircraft no-fire headings, determine the bearing from
               the friendly position to the target. Subtract 60 degrees to get the heading
               corresponding to the start of the no-fire zone. Subtract another 60 degrees to get
               the heading corresponding to the end of no-fire zone.

 Note 1: Hazard areas for guided weapons are highly dependent upon launch conditions and
 coordinate accuracies.
 WARNING: During peacetime, do not point a loaded and armed weapon at a friendly
 position. Failure to heed this warning could cause injury or death to friendly forces if
 inadvertent gun firing should occur.


   21.11.8. SOPGM Employment.
       21.11.8.1. A SOPGM engagement will normally be initiated by 9-line. All available
       crew members should record the information as it is received.
       21.11.8.2. Both the navigator and CSO will confirm the target.
       21.11.8.3. Any crew member recognizing an incorrect confirmation (friendly or target)
       or incorrect range/bearing will immediately advise the crew.
       21.11.8.4. Once the appropriate munition and conditions are determined, the navigator
       will state ―Pilot, Nav: Ripple #/Single, Weapon Type, Fuse, Maneuver, Run-In
       Restrictions (if required), Weapon Status.‖ Example: ―Pilot, Nav: Ripple 2 Griffins,
       PD, JHook, 120, 5 Minutes Remaining.‖
       21.11.8.5. The pilot will acknowledge the maneuver and any run-in restrictions.
       Example: ―Copy, JHook, 120.‖
       21.11.8.6. After the target data is entered into EM, the navigator will state ―Target Data
       Entered,‖ which initiates the STRIKE (SOPGM) checklist.
180                                               AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011


      21.11.8.7. Based on EM inputs and the selected maneuver, the navigator will state
      ―Cleared To Maneuver‖ at the appropriate time in order to facilitate a successful
      engagement.
      21.11.8.8. Delaying or terminating SOPGM release.
         21.11.8.8.1. Prior to SOPGM release, any crew member observing a condition that
         could jeopardize a successful release/strike will call ―Hold Release, (Reason)‖ on the
         primary NET. The navigator will acknowledge the call. Switch positions will be as
         required.
         21.11.8.8.2. Prior to SOPGM release, any crew member observing a condition that
         could jeopardize safety will call ―Cease Fire‖ on the primary NET. The navigator
         and pilot will acknowledge the call. All switches will be placed to the SAFE
         position.
      21.11.8.9. After weapons impact or EM mission abort, all switches will be returned to
      their pre-launch condition. EXCEPTION: The Pilot‘s Master Arm switch may remain
      on.
  21.11.9. RESERVED FOR FUTURE USE.
  21.11.10. RESERVED FOR FUTURE USE.
  21.11.11. Poststrike Coordination.
      21.11.11.1. Run the POSTSTRIKE checklist upon completion of strike operations and
      prior to subsequent mobility events. If mission requirements dictate, the PIC may
      authorize the navigator to remain at the MOP during AAR.
      21.11.11.2. Crew Coordination.
         21.11.11.2.1. The copilot and FE will brief departure plan, aircraft configuration, and
         SCNS setup (control points, reference points, waypoints, and bullseyes) once the
         navigator is on the flight deck.
         21.11.11.2.2. The navigator will position to the flight deck and complete the
         navigation hand off with the copilot and the radar/defensive system set up with the
         FE.
         21.11.11.2.3. Flight Engineer. The FE will complete a radar and defensive system
         hand off with the navigator.
         21.11.11.2.4. Loadmaster. The LM will ensure that the gun is safed/stowed,
         SOPGMs are safed/secured, and resume scanning duties. When operating in a hostile
         environment, if the 30MM gun cannot be stowed electrically, corrective actions may
         be delayed until the ENROUTE or DESCENT checklist.

 along the projected route of flight. Visual reference to the ground must be maintained and a
 visible horizon is recommended.
 2. Climbs must be initiated so that the aircraft is established at the higher MSA prior to the
 next segmented point. Descent to a lower MSA will not be initiated until past the next
 segmented point.
 3. A mission pilot must be in the left seat or a mission IP/EP in either seat.
 WARNING: Lack of sufficient illumination may prevent NVG contour operations in
 otherwise VMC conditions.

22.4. Degraded Systems Restrictions/Procedures. Degraded Systems Training (DST) is used
to prepare crews to accomplish the mission simulating certain pieces of equipment inoperative
(or intentionally turned off for emission control) during NVG low-level and airland operations.
Specifically, DST serves the purpose of training, via simulation of inoperative equipment, to
prepare for a possible lack of instrumentation aboard partner nation aircraft. Designate DST
route segments during the route brief. DST will not be performed by inexperienced crews, will
be taken into consideration during ORM assessment. The following restrictions and procedures
are designed to maximize training and safety.
   22.4.1. DST Specific Restrictions:
       22.4.1.1. PICs will brief the equipment simulated as inoperative, aircrew coordination,
       crew duties, and disorientation/emergency procedures prior to flight.
       22.4.1.2. Visibility must be at least 5 SM in mountainous terrain.
       22.4.1.3. Illumination: Effective illumination must be greater than 25% or DST must be
       conducted between the forecasted hours of sunset and estimated end of nautical twilight
       (EENT). Effective illumination must be greater than 50% if a safety observer is not
       aboard IAW paragraph 22.4.1.5 Otherwise, DST may be conducted between the
       forecasted hours of sunset and EENT.
       22.4.1.4. Equipment/Personnel Requirements:
          22.4.1.4.1. Radar Altimeter. The aircraft‘s radar altimeter must be operational and
          on during the entire flight. Additionally, both pilot and navigator indicators must be
          fully functioning.
          22.4.1.4.2. Ground Mapping/Weather Radar. The radar must be fully functional
          before flight. The navigator will function check the radar periodically during DST
          NVG low-level operations to verify functionality. If at any time during function
          check it is determined that the radar will not sufficiently provide terrain avoidance,
          DST operations will be discontinued. At this time tactical operations will revert to
          restrictions provided in Table 22.1.
          22.4.1.4.3. Navigation equipment. The SCNS INS or GPS must be operational and
          on during DST. A GPS moving map laptop with Portable Flight Planning System
AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011                                                                183


           (PFPS) and Digital Terrain Elevation Data (DTED) installed should be employed by
           the navigator. Chart coverage must meet the minimum requirements. DTED
           coverage will encompass the planned flight area and data within 25 NM of all course
           centerline.
       22.4.1.5. Personnel: A mission qualified instructor pilot must be at the controls. A
       mission instructor/evaluator navigator must be on board. The instructor/evaluator
       navigator, if not manning the navigator position, will be acting in an instructor/evaluator
       capacity. Restriction: During NVG low-level radar denied DST operation, a second
       mission qualified navigator (or mission qualified pilot) will act as the safety observer, and
       will monitor the progress of the mission using NVGs. The scanner will wear NVGs and
       carry an additional chart. Restriction: During NVG low-level radar denied DST
       operation, a second mission qualified navigator (or mission qualified pilot) will act as the
       safety observer, and will monitor the progress of the mission using NVGs. The scanner
       will wear NVGs and carry an additional chart prepared.
   22.4.2. Procedures:
       22.4.2.1. Single Radar Altimeter operations. For single radar altimeter operations the
       navigator‘s radar altimeter repeater only will be placed to off and the flight engineer will
       assume all responsibilities for radar altimeter altitude calls referencing the pilot‘s radar
       altimeter as directed by the PIC. Equipment/Personnel requirements must be met IAW
       paragraph 22.4.1.4
       22.4.2.2. Radar denied operations. The radar will be placed in the standby position
       during NVG low-level, radar denied operations in order to simulate an
       inoperative/unavailable radar. A safety observer will be on board IAW paragraph
       22.4.1.5 Having the radar in standby will allow a quick transition to normal NVG low-
       level procedures during limited visibility or in emergency situations (inadvertent weather
       penetration, emergency climb, etc.). The navigator will turn on the radar any time cloud
       cover degrades effective illumination in flight. Equipment/Personnel requirements must
       be met IAW paragraph 22.4.1.4
       22.4.2.3. Simulated SCNS denied/degraded operations.                 Simulated SCNS
       denial/degradation maybe accomplished during any phase of flight regardless of the
       illumination. The flight director mode switches can be positioned to simulate the INS
       and/or GPS inoperative or the navigator may select a degraded SCNS submode via their
       IDCU. Additionally, any crew position IDCU may be dimmed. The crews primary
       navigational references become the copilots/navigator‘s charts and moving map PFPS. If
       any crew member becomes disoriented an immediate climb to ESA will be initiated IAW.
       Equipment/Personnel requirements must be met IAW paragraph 22.4.1.4
22.5. NVG Low-level Operational Risk Management. Risk mitigation for low illumination
includes detailed recommended altitudes and an analysis of cultural lighting. If necessary, limit
the flight to flat terrain. Be prepared to explain to the Squadron CC/DO how these were used.
22.6. En route Operations.
   22.6.1. Pilot Charts. Copilots are required to carry a navigational chart (minimum of TPC in
   scale) during NVG LL operations. The pilot and copilot may share a single low-level chart
   during flight. This chart will be prepared to the same requirements as navigator/EWO charts.
 184                                                 AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011


   22.6.2. Fuel Planning. For tactical low-level operations, assume a 6,000 pound per hour
   burn rate unless more accurate data is available.
   22.6.3. Planned Groundspeeds. Normally plan low-level operations at a groundspeed of 230
   knots. In situations of heavy aircraft gross weight or where strong headwinds prevail
   consider using a groundspeed of 220 knots. When flying low-level in high density altitude
   situations normally plan to use a groundspeed of 240-250 knots. NOTE: Regardless of the
   radar altimeter setting you use, if you are below the desired modified contour altitude, a
   correction to altitude should be made. Do not wait for the low light to illuminate to begin a
   correction. This is especially important when using the lower limit on the radar altimeter.
   22.6.4. Tower Avoidance. Any tower or man-made obstruction within 3 NM of planned
   flight path must be positively identified visually or on radar. If not identified by 3 NM prior
   to the tower or obstacle, climb to at least 300 ft above the obstruction until clear.
   22.6.5. Pilot Seat Swaps. Climb to MSA when either pilot must leave the seat during low-
   level flight. During planned seat swaps, when a qualified instructor remains in the seat the
   crew may continue low-level flight or climb to a safe altitude.
   22.6.6. Radar Altimeter Low Lights. Any crew member noting illumination of the low
   warning light on the radar altimeter will call ―Low‖ to indicate this to the PF. WARNING:
   Lack of immediate action could result in controlled flight into terrain (CFIT).
   22.6.7. Altimeter Updating: Ensure that the radar altimeter is fully operational and use
   sound judgment when updating aircraft altimeters
   22.6.8. The navigator will provide the new magnetic course and MSA prior to the turn point.
   The navigator will brief anticipated threats and aircraft deviations for the next leg. The
   navigator and pilots share the responsibility of clearing terrain in the direction of turn, and no
   other duties must be allowed to interfere with this primary responsibility.
22.7. SCA Procedures.
   22.7.1. SCA Procedures. SCAs may be used for approaches to conventional airfields and
   assault zones, and for either overt or NVG airland operations.
       22.7.1.1. Chart construction will be IAW Chapter 11 and Chapter 17.
       22.7.1.2. SCA Weather minimums:
          22.7.1.2.1. For NIMA-published SCAs, use published minimums but no lower than
          300 ft ceiling and 1 SM visibility.
       22.7.1.3. Pilot/Copilot Landing Procedures. The SCA may either be flown and landed
       by a single pilot or flown by one and landed by the other. This distinction will be made
       during the ENROUTE portion of the INFIL/EXFIL checklist. In some situations (i.e.,
       low visibility or low illumination), it may be more advantageous for the copilot to fly the
       SCA, and for the pilot to take control of the aircraft for landing. This allows the landing
       pilot to visually search for the LZ while the copilot‘s focus is on flying the SCA.
          22.7.1.3.1. During NVG operations, an NVG landing qualified mission pilot (non-
          instructor) may fly the SCA, and takeoff and land from the right seat provided an
          NVG landing qualified pilot is also in the left seat. Copilots, if certified, or in
          upgrade, may land and takeoff from the right seat using only normal NVG procedures
AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011                                                             185


         provided that a NVG airland current and qualified PIC occupies the left seat and the
         runway width is 100 ft or greater.
         22.7.1.3.2. If the pilot and copilot positions are manned by NVG airland qualified
         MP/IP, it is allowable for the pilot to fly the SCA, and for the copilot to take control
         of the aircraft for landing. For approaches and landings not requiring NVGs (day
         operations or overt night operations to lighted runways) either pilot or copilot may fly
         the approach and accomplish the landing.
         22.7.1.3.3. Mission copilots will not descend below MDA and will maintain the
         MDA until the pilot takes control or until reaching the missed approach point.
         Execute a go-around if the runway environment is not in sight at the MAP, directed,
         or a safe landing cannot be made. A mission copilot may perform the NVG go-
         around; however, if an immediate landing feasible is attempted they will not descend
         below MDA and will maintain the MDA until the pilot takes control or until reaching
         the missed approach point unless authorized to land.
         22.7.1.3.4. See Chapter 5 for maximum effort takeoff and landing guidance and
         policy.
     22.7.1.4. All infil/exfil time advisories and respective actions will be conducted IAW
     Chapter 17 of this publication.
     22.7.1.5. VMC SCA. Do not descend below MDA until the touchdown zone is visually
     identified and confirmed by both pilots.
     22.7.1.6. IMC SCA. Do not descend below MDA ft until LZ environment is visually
     identified and confirmed by both pilots.
  22.7.2. SCA Coordination. During training missions with no onboard user involved, the PIC
  will determine and brief what time warnings (60-, 30-, 20-10-, 6-, and 1-minute) are required
  for the mission to be flown. The pilot and navigator will brief the SCA using the appropriate
  aircrew mission briefing guide during the ENROUTE portion of the INFIL/EXFIL checklist
  or the crew briefing step of the DESCENT checklist. Additional briefing items may be
  added, as required, for the particular mission. NOTE: During training missions, timed
  warnings may be compressed with user concurrence. The following infil/exfil procedures
  apply:
     22.7.2.1. Sixty Minutes Prior to Landing.
         22.7.2.1.1. When required, the navigator will alert the crew by stating, ―Crew, 60-
         Minute Advisory.‖ The loadmaster will acknowledge by stating ―Acknowledged,
         Loadmaster.‖ The loadmaster will notify the troop commander, check the load
         restraint, secure loose equipment, position or don required survival and emergency
         equipment, check NVGs, install and secure canary slide or type IV ground loading
         ramps, and set cargo compartment lighting for NVG operations.
     22.7.2.2. Thirty Minutes Prior to Landing.
         22.7.2.2.1. When required, the navigator will alert the crew by stating, ―Crew, 30-
         Minute Advisory.‖ The loadmaster will acknowledge by stating ―Acknowledged,
         Loadmaster.‖
186                                                 AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011


         22.7.2.2.2. The loadmaster will notify the troop commander and activate emergency
         exit chemical lights.
      22.7.2.3. Twenty Minutes Prior to Landing.
         22.7.2.3.1. When required, the navigator will alert the crew by stating, ―Crew, 20-
         Minute Warning.‖ The loadmaster will acknowledge by stating ―Acknowledged,
         Loadmaster.‖
         22.7.2.3.2. The loadmaster will notify the troop commander.
         22.7.2.3.3. The pilot will call for the ENROUTE portion of the INFIL/EXFIL
         checklist (this may be done earlier at the pilot's discretion) and configure NVG
         lighting. If normal checklists are being used, call for the DESCENT checklist.
         22.7.2.3.4. The navigator will determine the most accurate QNH altimeter setting for
         the LZ using all available sources including GPS, weather forecasts, ground station
         reporting, and altitude calibration, as available. If unsure of the most accurate
         altimeter setting, the altimeters will be set at the lowest altimeter setting for the route
         or route segment.
         22.7.2.3.5. The flight engineer will close the blackout curtains and install eyebrow
         window curtains (if required), and all crew members will set lighting for NVG
         operations.
         22.7.2.3.6. The pilots will don NVGs. The flight engineer will have NVGs ready for
         immediate use. The pilots will visually maintain terrain clearance and will clear for
         obstacles and other traffic. The pilots will cross-check airspeeds, altitudes,
         configuration, and headings, and will check for light bleed-through.
         22.7.2.3.7. The flight engineer will monitor aircraft systems and cross-check
         airspeeds, altitudes, headings, and configuration.
      22.7.2.4. Ten Minutes Prior to Landing.
         22.7.2.4.1. When required, the navigator will alert the crew by stating, ―Crew, 10-
         Minute Warning.‖ The loadmaster will acknowledge by stating ―Acknowledged,
         Loadmaster.‖
         22.7.2.4.2. The loadmaster will notify the troop commander, disconnect/disengage
         ADS arms, remove canary slide safety locks (if installed), and check NVGs.
      22.7.2.5. Six Minutes Prior to Landing.
         22.7.2.5.1. The loadmaster will relay the six-minute advisory to the onboard user.
         This is normally silent to the rest of the crew.
         22.7.2.5.2. The loadmaster will position and secure personnel, set cargo compartment
         lights as required for landing, and don NVGs if required.
      22.7.2.6. At the Initial Point.
         22.7.2.6.1. After visual acquisition of the initial point, terrain permitting, the
         navigator will sequence steering to the run-in leg so as to roll out on final course
         guidance without overshooting.
AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011                                                              187


        22.7.2.6.2. The navigator will make distance calls at every mile inside ten miles and
        every half mile inside three miles (or as briefed). The navigator will announce
        distance to go advisories in conjunction with course advisory information.
     22.7.2.7. Slowdown Procedures.
        22.7.2.7.1. Approximately 3 NM prior to the planned glide slope intercept point, the
        navigator will initiate the slowdown by stating ―Slowdown Now.‖
        22.7.2.7.2. The pilot flying will slow the aircraft to no less than normal 50%
        threshold speed, configure the flaps and gear as airspeed permits, and call for the
        appropriate checklist (BEFORE LANDING portion of the INFIL/EXFIL checklist or
        normal BEFORE LANDING checklist). He will call for 100% flaps as airspeed
        permits, slow to normal or maximum effort threshold speed. NOTE: Do not slow
        below 50% flap normal threshold speed until flaps are tracking to 100%.
        22.7.2.7.3. The engineer will advise the copilot as soon as the landing ―Gear Is
        Down‖ and standby for clearance to set the flaps to 100%. Upon receiving clearance
        from the PF, the engineer will state ―Tracking‖ and resume the INFIL/EXFIL
        checklist.
        22.7.2.7.4. Radar altimeters will remain set at en route altitude setting until the
        slowdown. The pilot will set the radar altimeter to the pre-briefed setting when called
        for in the checklist. A 25 or 10 ft setting on the pilot‘s radar altimeter helps judge the
        last few ft above the runway. The navigator should set 300 ft or as briefed to guard
        against shallow glide slopes and to prepare for a go-around and climb-out.
        22.7.2.7.5. Once the slowdown is initiated, no further airspeed corrections for TOA
        control should be made. NOTE: When slowdowns are initiated further out than 3
        NM prior to glide slope intercept, consider maintaining 140 KCAS (or approach
        speed, whichever is higher) and delaying the call for 100% flaps until 1 NM prior to
        glide slope intercept.
     22.7.2.8. One Mile to Glide Slope Intercept.
        22.7.2.8.1. Approximately 1 NM prior to glide slope intercept, the navigator will
        state "Expect Descent In One Mile." Approaching glide slope intercept, the navigator
        will confirm the accuracy of the barometric altimeter setting by comparing actual
        AGL and MSL altitudes with those depicted on the SCA template.
        22.7.2.8.2. If not already accomplished, the pilot flying will call for 100% flaps.
        22.7.2.8.3. The flight engineer will check gear down and flaps set to 100%.
     22.7.2.9. Glide Slope Intercept.
        22.7.2.9.1. At glide slope intercept, the navigator will state ―Begin Descent‖ and the
        desired initial descent rate. Approaching glide slope intercept, the navigator will
        confirm the accuracy of the barometric altimeter setting by comparing actual AGL
        and MSL altitudes with those depicted on the SCA template. The pilot flying will
        begin descent by setting and monitoring the planned/stated VVI.
        22.7.2.9.2. The navigator will monitor glide slope deviation. Report deviations
        greater than 50 ft, along with an advisory as to whether the aircraft is correcting to,
188                                               AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011


         paralleling, or diverging from glide path. Whoever identifies the LZ first will call out
         ―Zone In Sight‖ with clock position and any discrepancies noted (i.e., any lights out,
         etc.). Both pilots will then confirm the zone and cross-check the alignment for the
         proper heading.       WARNING: The navigator will verify that the actual aircraft
         position is inside the planned SCA obstacle template prior to initiating descent.
         22.7.2.9.3. The loadmaster will notify the onboard user of the 1 minute warning
         when the navigator calls ―2 Miles.‖ WARNING: Use of a 5-degree glide slope can
         cause descent rates in excess of 1,000 ft per minute. Extreme care must be taken to
         break high descent rates with application of power prior to touchdown.
         WARNING: Do not slow to threshold speed until established on final.
         22.7.2.9.4. The navigator, backed up by the pilot monitoring, will advise the pilot
         flying at 100 ft above the MDA and at MDA. The pilot flying will acknowledge the
         call and level the aircraft at MDA if the runway is not in sight. The pilot flying will
         maintain the MDA until the runway is in sight or until reaching the MAP (0 nautical
         miles to go to runway threshold on the SCNS).
         22.7.2.9.5. Visual Acquisition of the LZ.
         22.7.2.9.6. The pilot monitoring may direct the pilot flying to the LZ (remain at or
         above MDA). The pilot monitoring will ensure that the pilot flying and navigator
         understand that he has taken over the responsibility for directing the aircraft. After
         positively identifying the touchdown point, the pilot flying will accomplish the
         landing. In some situations, it may be more advantageous to have the other pilot take
         control of the aircraft for landing.
         22.7.2.9.7. The flight engineer will assist in field acquisition and visually check that
         the LZ is clear of obstacles.
         22.7.2.9.8. The pilot monitoring will monitor airspeed, descent rate, and bank angle
         and will advise the pilot flying if descent rate exceeds 1,000 FPM (or as briefed for
         steep glide slopes) or if bank angle exceeds 15 degrees. The navigator will provide
         the pilot with 100, 50, 25, and 10 ft height-above-touchdown calls. The copilot may
         provide the pilot with airspeed and descent rate information if requested by the pilot.
         Intersperse this information with the HAT calls from the navigator.
         22.7.2.9.9. When the navigator calls 100 ft, the loadmaster will notify the onboard
         user, ―Prepare To Land.‖
      22.7.2.10. After Touchdown.
         22.7.2.10.1. The loadmaster may open the ramp and door when throttles have been
         moved to reverse or as otherwise briefed.
         22.7.2.10.2. Upon landing, the copilot can provide airspeed to the pilot until slowing
         to 60 KIAS. These calls are optional. The copilot will have NVGs focused and ready
         for immediate use during taxi operations and assist in locating the briefed location.
         The copilot and flight engineer will assist the pilot in locating the off-load/onload
         point once taxi speed is reached, and clear for other aircraft and obstructions.
         22.7.2.10.3. When the aircraft is stopped at the off-load/onload location, the pilot
         will give the loadmaster clearance by stating ―Clear To Off-load/Onload.‖ Do not
AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011                                                             189


        move the aircraft after off-load/onload has commenced until the loadmaster calls
        ―Cleared To Taxi.‖ When there is a delay in the off-load/onload or an extended
        ground time is anticipated, raise the ramp approximately 12 inches above the ground
        so the aircraft can taxi in the event of an emergency. Refer to Attachment 2 and
        AFTTP 3-3 MC130, for further guidance.
        22.7.2.10.4. Touch and go operations are authorized during infil/exfil operations with
        or without the use of NVGs. Complete the BEFORE LANDING portion of the
        INFIL/EXFIL checklist on the initial approach to the runway and transition to the ON
        THE RUNWAY touch and go steps (asterisked) of the INFIL/EXFIL checklist after
        touchdown. After the first touch and go, asterisked of the INFIL/EXFIL checklists
        may be used. The crew will continue using normal SCA approach and landing
        procedures. The navigator may make calls as briefed by the PIC during visual
        patterns when established on downwind and the AFTER TAKEOFF touch and go
        steps of the INFIL/EXFIL checklist are complete. Time warnings are not required.
        Complete the full INFIL/EXFIL AFTER TAKEOFF checklist on the last departure
        from the airfield. Use normal checklist procedures IAW T.O. 1C130(E)E-1, Section
        II, when not using the INFIL/EXFIL checklist.
     22.7.2.11. Go-around. Execute a go-around if the runway is not in sight at the MAP or if
     a safe landing cannot be made.
        22.7.2.11.1. The navigator will advise the pilots upon arriving at the MAP and repeat
        MSL altitude, the initial heading, and will call altitudes as specified climbing through
        from 50 ft to 200 ft AGL (i.e., 50, 100, 150, 200) if a go-around is executed.
        22.7.2.11.2. If landing is desired, the crew may fly a visual (closed) pattern back to
        landing (Immediate Landing Feasible), or they may proceed to the IP for another
        approach.
     22.7.2.12. Immediate Landing Feasible. The pilot will state ―Go-around, Immediate
     Landing Feasible.‖ After establishing a safe climb, the pilot flying will direct the flaps
     set to 50%, and to leave the landing gear down and visually fly back to the runway. The
     pilot flying will call for 100% flaps before or after rolling off the perch and call for the
     INFIL/EXFIL BEFORE LANDING checklist. The engineer will pick up the checklist by
     reconfirming the landing gear position and accomplishing the remaining items of the
     checklist. The pilot will maintain 140 KIAS or approach speed, whichever is higher until
     rolling out on final.
        22.7.2.12.1. This maneuver should only require the movement of flaps and landing
        light switches. If any other change in configuration is accomplished, then the entire
        INFIL/EXFIL checklist will be used.
        22.7.2.12.2. The aircrew will route study all landing zones to ensure how an
        immediate landing feasible will be performed to each.
     22.7.2.13. Loss of NVGs:
        22.7.2.13.1. Airborne. Unless otherwise briefed, if the pilot or copilot loses use of
        their NVGs inside of 1 NM, perform a go-around. Instructor qualified pilots may
        continue to land IAW Chapter 17. If the flight engineer loses use of NVGs, land at
 190                                                AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011


          the discretion of the PIC. The other crew members must increase their clearing duties
          and confirm the zone. After takeoff, continue the climb out and follow the
          appropriate procedures for loss of NVGs.
          22.7.2.13.2. On the Ground. The pilot will determine whether to continue the
          landing rollout or takeoff roll as applicable. The copilot should be prepared to turn on
          overt lighting at the direction of the PIC in case of NVG failure during takeoff or
          landing roll.
       22.7.2.14. Takeoff Procedures. Also see Chapter 5.
          22.7.2.14.1. At takeoff speed, the pilot will rotate the aircraft to establish a positive
          climb rate (normally, this will be approximately a 7-degree nose-up attitude). The
          copilot checks the pitch attitude and will raise the landing gear on the command of
          the pilot after ensuring a positive rate of climb. The flight engineer will back up the
          pilot using NVGs during climb out. The copilot may take control of the aircraft if
          directed by the pilot, and continue the instrument climb out to the egress route
          altitude. The pilot flying directs the accomplishment of the AFTER TAKEOFF
          portion of the INFIL/EXFIL checklist, the AFTER TAKEOFF touch and go steps of
          the INFIL/EXFIL checklist, or the normal AFTER TAKEOFF checklist, depending
          on the scenario.
          22.7.2.14.2. As soon as conditions permit, the loadmaster will check equipment
          restraint, and check condition and needs of the onboard user.
22.8. Airdrop Operations.
   22.8.1. On personnel airdrops where surface winds are unknown, (such as unmanned DZs)
   advise the jumpmaster and Army airborne mission commander when drop altitude winds
   exceed 30 knots. In this instance, the decision to drop is at user's discretion.
   22.8.2. Drop zone (DZ) Survey Review. Both pilots and the navigator will review the DZ
   survey during mission planning. Memorize PI location, DZ dimensions, 10-second warning
   location, airdrop safety box, and prominent DZ features.
   22.8.3. The Radar Altimeter will be set to 50 ft below planned drop altitude.
   22.8.4. SCNS Airdrop/Troop Jump Computer-Manual Select Switch shall be set to AD/TJ
   manual.
   22.8.5. A maximum of ten static lines may be retrieved manually per paratroop door. A
   maximum of 20 static lines per cable may be retrieved with a static line retriever winch.
   22.8.6. Two loadmasters are required, except for SATB. At least one loadmaster should
   remain on interphone at all times.
   22.8.7. Navigating to the Release Point:
       22.8.7.1. Pilot and Navigator Release Point Procedures. To position the aircraft
       accurately at the release point, use the following pilot/navigator procedures:
          22.8.7.1.1. Airspeed adjustments should be completed prior to the IP or slowdown,
          whichever occurs first.
AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011                                                               191


         22.8.7.1.2. If the IP is visible from a distance and time control permits, overfly the IP
         on run-in heading. Otherwise, fly a curved path planned leg in order to rollout on
         course to the DZ.
         22.8.7.1.3. After departing the IP, the pilot not flying the aircraft will assist the
         navigator in maintaining the desired track inbound by confirming aircraft position
         with the planned run-in update points.
         22.8.7.1.4. The navigator provides headings that will position the aircraft the
         required distance upwind from centerline track so that large corrections will not be
         required on the final approach to the release point.
  22.8.8. Slowdown Procedures. During airdrop operations, the pilot will perform the
  slowdown maneuver and accomplish the SLOWDOWN checklist at a predetermined point
  prior to the release point. The preselected slowdown point will be an easily identifiable
  geographical point at or prior to the distance specified for the slowdown. A computer
  position or pre-briefed timing procedure may be used when a geographical point is not
  available. Begin slowdown at a distance commensurate with proficiency of crew. Decrease
  slowdown distance as proficiency increases. The objective is to reduce the time the aircraft
  is vulnerable at drop altitude and airspeed. After the navigator calls for the slowdown:
     22.8.8.1. The pilot retards the throttles to flight idle (0-1,000 inch pounds of torque) and
     calls for ―Flaps 50%, On Speed.‖
     22.8.8.2. The flight engineer lowers the flaps in 10% increments on speed.
     22.8.8.3. The copilot opens the air deflector doors (if required) upon slowing below 150
     KIAS. For tailgate drops, the flight engineer calls ―Ramp And Door‖ as part of the
     checklist, the loadmaster followed by the pilot state ―Clear To Open,‖ and the flight
     engineer opens the cargo door and ramp.        WARNING: For personnel airdrops, the
     pilot must be aware of paratroopers standing in the back and avoid drastic pitch or bank
     changes after the 6-Minute Advisory. NOTE: For CDS drops, reset the flaps IAW the
     CDS flap setting chart in the abbreviated checklist only.
     22.8.8.4. At slowdown, immediately double the drift used prior to slowdown and apply it
     to the run-in heading. This will keep the aircraft on the upwind side of the PI.
     22.8.8.5. The navigator informs the pilot of the expected drift, the heading required to
     parallel the DZ axis, and confirms the drop altitude and airspeed.
     22.8.8.6. As soon as the DZ is visible and identified by the pilot and navigator, they
     jointly confirm the release point location, lateral offset, and track required. The first crew
     member to identify the pre-briefed DZ markings will state ―PI IN SIGHT‖. The second
     crew member to identify the markings will state ―PI IN SIGHT, XX O‘CLOCK‖ (PI
     location clock position). The pilot then assumes the responsibility for maintaining the
     offset distance and required track. The navigator will pick the timing point, if required,
     control the green light and red light time and continually cross-check the offset distance.
     22.8.8.7. During the final seconds of the approach to the release point, the pilot not
     flying the aircraft places a hand near the jump light switch. 10 seconds prior to release,
     the navigator will give a preparatory call of ―10 Seconds.‖ At this call, if the aircraft
     location is not within pre-coordinated parameters, a ―No Drop‖ condition exists.
192                                                AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011


  22.8.9. During the drop:
      22.8.9.1. The loadmaster will not deploy equipment or personnel until hearing and
      seeing the green light.
      22.8.9.2. The pilot will make any small corrections required to maintain the track.
  22.8.10. Departure From Drop Zone (Escape). The navigator will call ―Red Light‖ at the
  expiration of the ―Green Light‖ time or upon hearing the loadmaster‘s call of ―Load Clear‖,
  whichever occurs first. When the red light is turned on crews may immediately begin the
  escape maneuver by tracking flaps to 50% if required, turning to the departure heading,
  increase airspeed to 140 KIAS, and attain en route altitude. To facilitate static line retrieval
  and preclude entanglement, do not exceed 140 KIAS until the static lines are retrieved.
  During combat, static lines that cannot be retrieved will be cut so that doors can be closed.
  Close all doors, raise flaps, and accelerate to en route airspeed. It is imperative that the
  aircraft be configured for high-speed evasive maneuvers. Therefore, after the static lines
  have been retrieved or cut, the doors and air deflectors closed, and flaps raised, the remainder
  of the COMPLETION OF DROP checklist may be deferred to a more convenient time while
  returning to the recovery base.
AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011                                                               193

                PSYCHOLOGICAL OPERATIONS/LEAFLET AIRDROP

23.1. General. Leaflet airdrops are accomplished in both hostile and permissive environments.
23.2. Mission Description. Mission requirements vary widely depending on the volume of
leaflets airdropped, leaflet packaging, and the altitude of the airdrop. Loads will normally not
exceed 25,000 pounds. Drop altitudes may vary from 500 ft AGL to the aircraft service ceiling.
Leaflet drops require the movement of boxes of various weights from throughout the cargo
compartment via intermediate rollers (if required) to the ramp area for dispersal off the ramp. If
specific mission requirements dictate deviation from information contained in this publication,
modify procedures to meet specific requirements. NOTE: For all airdrops conducted above
FL250 comply with AFI 11202V3. Long duration high altitude drops will require the aircraft
remain open. Consider outside air temperature and clothing requirements prior to step.
23.3. Equipment. In addition to normal aircraft equipment, the following items may be
required to perform leaflet drops:
   23.3.1. Parachutes or restraining harnesses must be available for use by all personnel
   working in the cargo compartment. Normally six are required.
   23.3.2. A portable oxygen console will be used IAW AFI 11409.
   23.3.3. An interval timer is desirable (alternating red and green jump lights may serve for
   sequencing the drops).
23.4. Aircraft Configuration. Determine if leaflets are floor loaded (on aircraft dual rail
intermediate conveyers) or are configured on pallets. Based on how the leaflets are prepared and
the volume of leaflets to airdrop, there are several possible configurations.
   23.4.1. Palletized Loads. Preload large volumes of leaflets on pallets and load as palletized
   cargo. Resources permitting, this is the recommended procedure for large volumes of
   leaflets.
       23.4.1.1. Use modified pallets with warehouse rollers attached to the top of the pallets in
       two sticks.
       23.4.1.2. Stack the leaflet boxes on the pallets in two sticks and secure them to the
       pallets before loading aircraft.
       23.4.1.3. In addition to the modified pallets, provide a bridge to span the gap between the
       last floor pallet and the ramp pallet.
           23.4.1.3.1. Construct the bridge so the rollers on it are the same height as the rollers
           on top of the pallets when loaded on the aircraft dual rails (MC/C130).
           23.4.1.3.2. Install the bridge after the ramp is lowered to the airdrop position and
           before completion of the slowdown or 3-minute checklist.
   23.4.2. Floor Loads. Leaflets may also be loaded directly on the aircraft intermediate
   conveyors, if available. Employ this procedure for smaller loads of leaflets or when the
   equipment mentioned above is not available.
 194                                                AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011


       23.4.2.1. Individual boxes have to be hand loaded and each group of boxes individually
       secured using aircraft tie-down equipment.
       23.4.2.2. Configure the aircraft IAW the applicable volume and addenda.
          23.4.2.2.1. Recommend the intermediate conveyors be moved inboard to the high-
          speed configuration (MC130E/H/W aircraft), if size of the load permits.
          23.4.2.2.2. If the intermediate conveyors must remain in the outboard configuration,
          exercise care during loading to ensure the individual boxes contact two intermediate
          rollers. The boxes may not roll or may be damaged if loaded on only one roller
          conveyor.
              23.4.2.2.2.1. If the intermediate conveyors must remain in the outboard
              configuration, consider using CDS skid boards or sheets of plywood as skids
              under the leaflet boxes.
              23.4.2.2.2.2. If using this option, secure each skid of leaflets individually using
              aircraft tie-down equipment.
              23.4.2.2.2.3. Drift each skid back to the ramp hinge during the airdrop, exercising
              caution not to let the skid board exit the aircraft.
              23.4.2.2.2.4. Secure the empty skids against the side wall until the airdrop is
              completed.
23.5. Preparation for Loading. Complete applicable portions of the appropriate T.O.
1C130A9 checklists as follows:
   23.5.1. Cargo Loading Preparation.
   23.5.2. Cargo Loading (Palletized/Floor Load).
   23.5.3. General Airplane Preparation for Ramp and Door Airdrop/Extraction.
   23.5.4. Anchor Cables. Rig one anchor cable on each side of the aircraft.
       23.5.4.1. Attach the aft latch of each anchor cable to the inboard U-bolt on the aft anchor
       cable support on each side of the airplane.
       23.5.4.2. Position the anchor cable stops to the very forward or aft end of the cable, or
       remove and stow the stops, unless they are used as stops for the restraint harness restraint
       strap.
       23.5.4.3. Attach the forward latch to the center U-bolts on the forward anchor cable
       support.
          23.5.4.3.1. If the center U-bolts are not accessible because of aircraft configuration,
          attach the forward latch to the outboard U-bolts.
          23.5.4.3.2. If connecting the forward latch to the outboard U-bolts, leave additional
          slack in the cable to allow anchor cable installation in the outboard location on the A-
          frame during the airdrop.
          23.5.4.3.3. Lower the center anchor cable supports and lock them in the vertical
          position with the tubular supports. Do not connect the anchor cable to the A-frame
AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011                                                              195


           during rigging. The cable may block the cargo door from properly opening and
           closing.
           23.5.4.3.4. The aft anchor cable support arm micro switches should be isolated so
           that the cargo ramp will operate with the anchor cables lowered.
              23.5.4.3.4.1. Isolate the micro switches by securing them back with 1/4-inch
              cotton webbing or gutted Type III nylon.
              23.5.4.3.4.2. Test the ramp for operation with the micro switches secured and the
              anchor cables lowered to ensure the ties were properly installed.
   23.5.5. Static line Retrievers. Suspend oxygen hoses from static line retriever cables for
   high altitude missions (not required if airdropping below 10,000 ft MSL).
       23.5.5.1. Unwind static line retriever cable(s).
       23.5.5.2. Install quick disconnects on the aft end of cable(s).
       23.5.5.3. Secure the quick disconnects to the inboard side of the A-frame with two turns
       of 1/4-inch cotton webbing. Make this tie approximately 18 inches above the anchor
       cable attaching point. If the static line retriever is inadvertently rewound, the tie will
       break and will prevent damage to the A-frame or static line retriever.
       23.5.5.4. Remove all slack from static line retriever cables.
   23.5.6. Oxygen Hoses and Interphone Cord. Tape or tie extended oxygen hoses and
   interphone cords together and suspend from static line retriever cables with G-13 clevis or
   suitable substitute.
       23.5.6.1. Ensure that approximately 12 G-13 clevises or suitable substitutes are available
       to tie oxygen hoses to the static line retriever cable(s).
       23.5.6.2. Recommend the kicker use the oxygen regulator and interphone cord aft of the
       left paratroop door. Route the cord and hose up and over the overhead structural beams,
       and back down next to the overhead ADS release. This technique keeps the hose and
       cord off the floor preventing them from becoming tangled or damaged. It also keeps it
       out of the kicker's way while kicking boxes and retrieving static lines.
23.6. Securing Boxes. Secure five boxes on the ramp for airdrop. If loading preloaded pallets,
two sticks of five boxes each, are secured on the ramp pallet.
23.7. Connecting Static Lines. Connect static lines to the anchor cable aft of the A-frame.
23.8. Restraint Strapping. Place a single length of Type III nylon, as final restraint, over the
stick of boxes. The cargo restraint strap over the boxes on the ramp is removed at the 1-minute
warning. The Type III nylon final restraint is cut at the release point.
 196                                                 AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011


Figure 23.1. Leaflet Box Rigging Procedures.




23.9. Leaflet Box Rigging Procedures. Rigging boxes for high-altitude static line
dissemination.
   23.9.1. Using a punch, cut four holes approximately 2 1/2 inches by 3/4 inches as indicated
   in Figure 21.1 If a punch is not available, a knife can be used. When using a punch, the box
   must first be placed upon an object slightly deeper and smaller than the box so that a hard
   surface is provided when striking the punch.
   23.9.2. Cut through the box from one hole to another as illustrated in Figure 23.1
   23.9.3. Place a 2-inch wide length of webbing through the holes. The length of webbing
   depends upon the size of the box, but must be long enough to tie after the box has been filled
   with leaflets.
   23.9.4. Place a 3- or 4-inch strip of masking tape over the 2-inch wide webbing.
   23.9.5. Cut all four corners of the box from the top to about three-fourths of the way down
   (or less).
   23.9.6. Again using masking tape, tape one strip up the cut portion and two across, as
   illustrated.
   23.9.7. After filling the box with leaflets, tie the two strips of webbing.
   23.9.8. Attach one end of the static line to the webbing ties. The length of the static line
   depends upon the type of aircraft, but it is normally about 15 ft long. The box is rolled out of
AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011                                                                  197


   the aircraft and as the container comes to the end of the static, line, the sides of the box split.
   In effect, it is turned inside out. The leaflets fall away followed by the empty box.
   23.9.9. This is one method, and may not be the method suited for your mission. Other
   variations do exist; however, this is the most universal and least complex.
23.10. Preparation for Airdrop. After takeoff, take the following actions before starting the
leaflet airdrop checklist.
   23.10.1. Tape all ramp control panel switches, except the auxiliary pump and ramp switch.
   23.10.2. Lower anchor cables and connect them to the outboard side of the anchor cable
   supports.
   23.10.3. Safety tie the aft anchor cable support micro switches.
   23.10.4. Position/don emergency equipment and survival gear.
   23.10.5. Begin Leaflet Airdrop checklist.
23.11. Aircrew Procedures. Under normal circumstances the crew required for leaflet
operations consists of a tactical crew plus two PTs (for high altitude airdrops) and three
additional crew members to act as feeders. The senior loadmaster will assign specific positions
for activity in the cargo compartment.
   23.11.1. Drop Configuration/Maneuvering. Base configuration on desired coverage and
   airframe airspeed limitations. All personnel should be constantly aware of the possibility of
   an emergency break upon encountering a threat.
       23.11.1.1. Flaps. Flaps are normally set at 50% and flap settings should not be changed
       during the drop unless the loadmaster is notified. NOTE: At very high altitudes, the
       aircraft may not be able to maintain drop airspeed with 50% flaps. Under these
       conditions, use an intermediate flap setting that allows for aircraft performance and also
       produces an acceptable deck angle for the drop. A flap setting near 20% gives the best
       aircraft wing performance while providing high rudder boost for controllability.
       23.11.1.2. Airspeed. Base KIAS/KCAS on desired groundspeed. This may range from
       125 to 150 KIAS/KCAS. Other speed ranges may apply if not dropping off the ramp
       (i.e., cargo door only).
23.12. Static Lines. To increase speed of closing the ramp if a hostile threat is detected and to
prevent damage to the aircraft, the static lines should be stowed after each box goes out. Do this
if the interval between boxes permits safe operation. Static lines may be cut in an emergency.

                          SEARCH AND RESCUE PROCEDURES

24.1. General. Most searches are part of an effort to save life; therefore, make every effort to
complete the search as rapidly and efficiently as possible. A thorough scan of the search area
and accurate navigation significantly increase the probability of detection. Reactions to sightings
must be timely and accurate. This section outlines operational procedures for conducting
effective searches in the C130 aircraft. Refer to the International Aeronautical and Maritime
Search and Rescue Manual (IAMSAR) Volumes I/II for additional information.

24.2. Search Altitude. Select an optimum search altitude based upon the object of search,
weather in the search area, electronic or visual location aids used, and any other known factor,
which would affect the search altitude. Generally, the lower the search altitude, the better the
chance of seeing an object, provided the altitude is not so low that the aircraft speed becomes
detrimental. During preliminary searches, the altitude will be higher to detect possible signals at
greater distances. Also, see Table 24.7
24.3. Search Procedures.
   24.3.1. Rescue missions often involve commitment based upon calculated risks. Give full
   consideration to all safety factors. Timely reaction to all search missions is essential to the
   safety of personnel or equipment. Do not jeopardize safety by inadequate preparation or
   short cuts to expedite takeoff, or arrival at search areas. Aircrews will comply with all other
   applicable directives, which govern their duties, such as:
       24.3.1.1. Accomplish complete predeparture flight planning except for scramble
       missions. On scramble missions, complete essential flight planning prior to and shortly
       after takeoff.
       24.3.1.2. Use in-flight procedures in accordance with the appropriate theater of operation
       flight regulations.
           24.3.1.2.1. Aircraft will maintain vertical and horizontal separation in the search
           area. This is critical when several aircraft are searching within close proximity.

             24.3.1.2.2. Transmit operation normal (position) reports as required by the
             controlling agency.
   24.3.2. The following general instructions apply to all search missions:
          24.3.2.1. Brief crew members that did not attend the operations briefing on the purpose
          of the mission.
          24.3.2.2. Scanners who are not aircrew members will receive a briefing on the search
          objective.
          24.3.2.3. The PIC will supervise and coordinate activities of crew members during
          preparation for search, as follows:
             24.3.2.3.1. Plan the search with the navigator(s).
             24.3.2.3.2. Discuss with all crew members scanning procedures.
             24.3.2.3.3. Discuss with the navigator(s) and copilot the procedures for making
             search pattern turns.
             24.3.2.3.4. Discuss the radio communication procedures with the AMSS and copilot.
             24.3.2.3.5. Discuss the preparation of flares, sea dyes, and smoke signals for

             24.3.2.3.6. Discuss the preparation of personnel and equipment for airborne delivery
             with the loadmaster and pararescue personnel. Ensure all crew members are
             thoroughly familiar with the checklists to be used for various airborne delivery
             options.
          24.3.2.4. The PIC will coordinate crew member activities during prosecution of the
          search by:
             24.3.2.4.1. Ensuring completion of the SEARCH checklist prior to commencing any
             low-level search.
202                                                AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011


         24.3.2.4.2. Alerting the scanners to begin scanning when approaching the search
         area.
         24.3.2.4.3. Directing crew members to put on their LPUs prior to descending below
         2,000 ft over water.
         24.3.2.4.4. Checking with crew members to ensure all equipment and personnel are
         ready for action in the event of a sighting.
         24.3.2.4.5. Making periodic checks of fuel remaining to ensure sufficient fuel
         remains for return to home station.
      24.3.2.5. Report all deviations from assigned search procedures to the on-scene
      commander or mission commander.
      24.3.2.6. Thoroughly investigate sightings and report findings immediately. Initiate
      recovery action or assistance when the survivors are located and inform appropriate
      agencies of the progress.
      24.3.2.7. The navigator(s) will:
         24.3.2.7.1. Maintain an accurate record of area searched.
         24.3.2.7.2. Direct the aircraft to ensure proper coverage of the search area.
         24.3.2.7.3. Continually cross-check headings, drift, time, airspeed, and altitude to
         maintain the best possible search coverage.
         24.3.2.7.4. Use a large-scale chart when searching over land to ensure terrain and
         obstacle clearance. Use a search pattern graph as a suitable reference while searching
         over water.
         24.3.2.7.5. Record sighting information on log and plot position on navigation chart.
         24.3.2.7.6. Monitor equipment during radar and electronic searches.
         24.3.2.7.7. Debrief controlling agency with an accurate depiction of any areas
         searched.
         24.3.2.7.8. When other aircraft are involved, with the assistance of the AMSS, track
         and assign search areas for other aircraft.
      24.3.2.8. The AMSS will maintain radio communications with other search aircraft and
      the controlling agency as directed by the PIC.
      24.3.2.9. The loadmaster will assume supervision of the scanners and will schedule
      rotation and rest periods. Scanners should be rotated every 30 to 45 minutes of scanning
      and rested after two hours, if enough scanners are available.
      24.3.2.10. All crew members will assist with the scanning duties when possible.
      24.3.2.11. When a search is completed with negative results, consider searching the area
      again. Normally, position subsequent search legs between or 45° to the previous search
      legs. This procedure, in effect, results in smaller track spacing.
  24.3.3. In the search area:
      24.3.3.1. Descend to search altitude (Table 24.7).
AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011                                                                        203


          24.3.3.2. Have navigator obtain the wind at search altitude. To visually cover the area
          thoroughly, slow the airspeed during search patterns (refer to the Aircraft Performance
          Manual).
          24.3.3.3. Notify ATC of arrival on scene and estimated endurance.
          24.3.3.4. Vector other aircraft to the scene.
          24.3.3.5. Use radar (some life rafts carry reflectors).
          24.3.3.6. Assume on-scene command until relieved by another duly appointed SAR
          aircraft. As other aircraft arrive, do the following:
              24.3.3.6.1. Establish contact on channels other than Guard.
              24.3.3.6.2. Obtain aircraft type identification, endurance, and rescue capability.
              24.3.3.6.3. Assign altimeter setting, frequencies, search areas, patterns, and altitude
              separation.
          24.3.3.7. If leaving the search area because of lack of fuel, assign another aircraft as on-
          scene commander.
      24.3.4. Determine an accurate wind prior to and throughout the search by SCNS, INS, or
      Doppler. Use Table 24.9 to estimate wind velocity near the surface.
      24.3.5. When flying search patterns, turns must be accurate and uniform as possible. The
      following procedures are provided to assist the aircrew in making precise turns:
          24.3.5.1. Fly the aircraft on autopilot when possible.
          24.3.5.2. Prior to starting the pattern, the navigator will brief the crew on the direction
          and rate of turn and the turn command procedure used.
          24.3.5.3. Normally, all turns are standard rate (3° per second) unless track spacing is less
          in distance than the diameter of a standard turn at a given speed. In this situation,
          continue turn to 180° and adjust turn rate as required to remain within the pattern.

       24.3.5.4. Drop available emergency equipment and/or personnel, if required. If
       survivors are in life jackets, make attempts as soon as possible to furnish them with life
       rafts or other survival equipment and signaling devices.
       24.3.5.5. Direct potential rescue or recovery vessels and other aircraft to the scene by
       radio or visual signals. Radio and visual signals you may use to direct a vessel to the
       scene to include:
       24.3.5.6. Radio message to the vessel.
           24.3.5.6.1. ADF to take bearings on a vessel's LF or MF transmissions.
           24.3.5.6.2. VHF or UHF direction finder to take bearings of VHF or UHF
           transmissions.
           24.3.5.6.3. Radar and IFF.
           24.3.5.6.4. Signal light.
           24.3.5.6.5. Dropping message containers.
           24.3.5.6.6. Pyrotechnic flares.
AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011                                                                205


          24.3.5.6.7. When radio communications are not possible, establish self-identification,
          then indicate location of the target by:
             24.3.5.6.7.1. Circling the vessel at least once at low altitude.
             24.3.5.6.7.2. Flying across the bow of the vessel at least once, and rocking wings
             at the same time.
             24.3.5.6.7.3. Sending a message by signal light or dropping a message, if
             possible.
             24.3.5.6.7.4. Heading in the direction of the target. Repeat this procedure until
             the vessel acknowledges by following the aircraft, or indicates that it is unable to
             comply by hoisting the International Flag, November (the International Flag,
             November, is a blue and white checkerboard). Crossing the wake of the vessel
             close astern at a low altitude means that the service of the vessel to which the
             signal is directed is no longer required.
      24.3.5.7. In daytime, use any of the following means to inform survivors they have been
      sighted:
          24.3.5.7.1. Fly low over survivors with landing lights on.
          24.3.5.7.2. Blink a signal light in the direction of survivors.
          24.3.5.7.3. Drop two marker signals a few seconds apart.
      24.3.5.8. Aircrews sighting survivors at night should:
          24.3.5.8.1. Mark the position by dropping marker smoke or strobe lights with
          floatation collars.
          24.3.5.8.2. Request assistance from other search aircraft or ships.
             24.3.5.8.2.1. If a rescue vessel arrives in the area, direct it to the scene by giving
             the target position in relation to the float light. Drop parachute flares to assist the
             rescue or recovery vessel in sighting the target.
             24.3.5.8.2.2. If the objective has not been located, but its position is fairly well
             established, drop two strobe lights or datum marker buoys to outline the limits of
             the search area, the most probable position of target being halfway between the
             lights. Start the search from one light to the other, dropping parachute flares for
             illumination.
             24.3.5.8.2.3. If no surface vessel is available, but two aircraft are on-scene, have
             one aircraft fly over the area at 3,000 ft dropping flares at 2- or 3-mile intervals.
             Station the other aircraft 3 miles behind the illuminating aircraft, slightly upwind
             at 500 ft to search.
24.4. Departing Search Area.
   24.4.1. Notify ATC and the appropriate SAR agency on-scene SAR aircraft, Rescue
   Coordination Center, etc.
   24.4.2. If other search aircraft have not arrived, reconfirm position, and advise survivors
   when further assistance will arrive, if known.
 206                                                    AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011


24.5. Rescue Airdrops. Rescue airdrops of rescue equipment allow rapid deployment of Sea
Rescue Kits, pyrotechnics, emergency equipment, etc., in an unplanned and rapidly changing
environment. An example would be dropping a Sea Rescue Kit to a helicopter that ditched
during helicopter air refueling. Specific patterns are Sea Rescue Kit deployments and
Parabundle and Free-fall equipment drops.
   24.5.1. The pilot will always brief the pattern and delivery to be flown.
       24.5.1.1. At a minimum, brief the type of equipment to be delivered, delivery method
       (pattern shape, relationship to wind, etc.), altitudes, airspeeds, commands to be used, and
       required actions for malfunctions.
   24.5.2. Sea Rescue Kit Deployment. The Sea Rescue Kit is designed to meet conditions,
   which require aerial delivery of emergency floatation and survival gear. The kit is dropped
   free-fall and abeam during a crosswind pass over the target. When correctly dropped, a
   straight line is formed on the water with an inflated raft at each end. After delivery, the two
   rafts with their high freeboard will begin to drift downwind until retarded by the partially
   submerged supply containers. Thus, when the kit is properly deployed, wind conditions will
   cause the kit to form a "U," partially encircling the target.
       24.5.2.1. Surface wind will affect the kit and target in varying amounts in proportion to
       the area exposed above the water and displacement below the water. The kit will drift
       faster than nearly all-seagoing vessels (outboards, cabin cruisers, trawlers, heavy
       displacement deep draft vessels and 1 man life rafts) but slower than a 6-, 7-, or 20-man
       raft. If a kit drifts faster, it will be delivered upwind. If the target drifts faster, the kit will
       be delivered downwind. When the surface wind is less than 15 knots, the delivery pass
       will be offset approximately 50 ft. Distance will be increased 25 ft for each 10 knots in
       excess of the 15-knot base. EXCEPTION: Downwind kit drops will always be offset
       approximately 50 ft. Do not correct for wind.
       24.5.2.2. When deploying a Sea Rescue Kit in high winds the kit may be deployed with
       the rafts deflated to improve drop accuracy. See paragraph 24.11.2 for special rigging
       instructions.
       24.5.2.3. Pyrotechnics may be useful in determining wind strength and direction, and
       maintaining pattern orientation.
       24.5.2.4. Standard Sea Rescue Kit Pattern Procedures (Figure 24.2).
           24.5.2.4.1. Maneuver the aircraft onto a flight path that is crosswind and
           approximately 50 ft from the target on the side opposite to that of the intended kit
           delivery. Maintain drop altitude and airspeed.
AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011                                                               207


Figure 24.2. Standard Sea Rescue Kit Pattern.




          24.5.2.4.2. When abeam the target, begin the count (use seconds). Two seconds past
          the target, release a smoke marker (if available). The pilot will count over
          interphone, "One Thousand One, One Thousand Drop." On the command of "Drop"
          the copilot or flight engineer will activate the appropriate flare launching switch on
          the copilot's flare launcher control panel or the loadmaster will manually launch a
          smoke marker.
          24.5.2.4.3. Maintain heading for 10 seconds and drop second timing signal (if
          available). Turn 45° to the right and hold that heading for 15 seconds. Make a 180°
          left-hand standard rate turn. Adjust turn to final so as to pass upwind or downwind of
          the target (as required for the delivery). Distance will vary with the type of target and
          wind velocity. Rolling out, the pilot will notify the crew: "30 Seconds To Target."
          24.5.2.4.4. Approximately 10 seconds from the smoke marker, the pilot will notify
          crew: "10 Seconds." Just prior to abeam the smoke marker, the pilot will command
          "Ready," and then abeam the marker, "Drop." NOTE: Aircraft without marker
          signals should fly the pattern as described and attempt to drop the kit 4 seconds prior
          to the target.

      24.5.2.5. Navigator Assistance for Sea Rescue Kits. The navigator can assist the pilot by
      the use of onboard systems. The navigator will advise the pilot when the aircraft
      approaches the final delivery track.
         24.5.2.5.1. The navigator should set up the onboard navigation system as follows
         (SCNS-equipped aircraft):
             24.5.2.5.1.1. During the flight plan programming portion of the preflight, the
             navigator should load two dummy waypoints that will later serve as the IP and
             target. (The target will be the location of the survivor or position to which the kit
             will be delivered.) NOTE: This step will save time in-flight by eliminating the
             need to modify the flight plan sequence.
             24.5.2.5.1.2. As the aircraft flies over the target on the initial pass, the navigator
             will mark this position and store it. The wind (e.g., 180/015) should be noted and
             recorded at this time. The onboard system will allow the navigator to direct the
             pilot perpendicular to the wind on the final run-in to the target.
             24.5.2.5.1.3. Go to the plan page. Call up the dummy waypoint that was initially
             designated the target and redesignate it as the mark point (stored target position).
             Verify this waypoint.
             24.5.2.5.1.4. Go to the preceding waypoint and redesignate it as the mark point.
             24.5.2.5.1.5. Define an initial point (IP) using a range and bearing from the
             original mark point and save it as the waypoint prior to the target. Use a bearing
             that is the reciprocal of the desired run-in heading (e.g., 090/270 degrees) and a
             range of 5 to 10 NM and verify. The pilot must confirm the final run-in heading
             before the navigator can load the bearing. NOTE: Keep in mind that the target
             will drift. This is basically a visual maneuver; the navigation systems are used as
             a backup. The pilot should make every attempt to keep the target in sight.
             24.5.2.5.1.6. The pilot will use the system to help maintain situational awareness
             and line up on the target for the delivery pass. During the run-in, the pilot will
             offset upwind or downwind as necessary (see paragraph 24.10.2.1).
  24.5.3. Parabundle and Free-fall Deployment:
      24.5.3.1. When practical, use a racetrack pattern with the drop heading into the wind for
      equipment drops. However, circumstances may dictate a modified pattern. Equipment
      may be dropped from the paratroop doors or the aft cargo door and ramp. The first
      bundle dropped is, in effect, a spotter bundle. Therefore, it should be the least critical to
      the survivors. Water deliveries must consider wind, drift, and sea state. WARNING:
      The delivery of equipment, no matter how vital, must never endanger the lives of the
      receivers.
      24.5.3.2. Equipment deliveries to land drop zones should be planned to impact within 50
      yards of the target. Water deliveries should be planned to impact within 5 yards of the
      target or within a 45 degree sector centered on the drift line for 100 yards. In any case,
      deliveries should never be in excess of 5 yards up-drift of the target.
      24.5.3.3. Pilot Procedures. Pilots are responsible for determining the mode of
      deployment, drop location, and type pattern to be flown. They must ensure the
AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011                                                             209


     loadmaster is aware of the desired PI. When the situation permits, the pilot will make an
     observation pass over the drop zone. Final free-fall altitude will be no lower than 150 ft
     AGL. Final parabundle altitude should be no lower than 300 ft AGL. Minimum altitude
     for all night airdrops is 500 ft AGL. WARNING: Keep turns below 300 ft AGL to a
     minimum.
        24.5.3.3.1. Aircraft altitude, attitude, course, and airspeed should be established by
        30 seconds to target and no later than 10 seconds to target. The pilot will keep the
        crew apprised of their position in the pattern. At a minimum, on final the pilot will
        state "30 Seconds To Target," then "10 Seconds." Once the loadmaster spots the
        target, he will state, "Target In Sight" and provide the pilot with course corrections if
        time permits.
     24.5.3.4. Loadmaster Procedures. Loadmasters must understand the location of the
     desired PI. When looking for the target, the loadmaster will use either paratroop door. If
     the PI is difficult to spot, ask the pilot to give a countdown to the PI on the run in.
        24.5.3.4.1. The loadmaster will hook up the restraint system as described in Chapter
        6. The jump platform will be extended and the air deflector doors opened. The
        loadmaster may align the aircraft for the airdrop by sighting down the edge of the
        jump platform to the drop zone and steering the aircraft with standard calls of
        ―Steady,‖ ―Right, (number of) Degrees,‖ or ―Left, (number of) Degrees.‖ NOTE: If
        the loadmaster places their head on the jump platform to sight and align the aircraft,
        they should place their head toward the forward edge for parabundle airdrops, and
        move their head aft for free-fall airdrops and to compensate for higher altitudes.
        24.5.3.4.2. Bundle dimensions for paratroop door drops, including the parachute,
        must not exceed 48 by 30 by 66 inches. Bundles in excess of 100 pounds require a
        second pusher and those between 350-500 pounds require two additional pushers.
        For equipment to be delivered from the paratroop door, attach the static line (if used)
        to tie-down ring 26-B or 26-F. Secure equipment until it is ready for delivery.
        24.5.3.4.3. If equipment cannot be delivered from the paratroop door, the loadmaster
        may prepare and position the equipment on the ramp for delivery, and use another
        thoroughly briefed crew member to release the equipment. The equipment will be
        secured until ready for delivery. For equipment to be delivered from the ramp, attach
        the static line (if used) to a tie-down ring in row 30. The crew member assisting the
        loadmaster will connect to the same restraint cable as the loadmaster with the shuttle
        aft of the center anchor cable support. WARNING: The shuttle will not be moved
        aft until after the ramp is lowered.         WARNING: The shuttle must be moved
        forward of the center anchor cable support before raising the ramp to close.
        24.5.3.4.4. The loadmaster will normally spot the target 8 seconds prior to the release
        point, and give the preparatory command "Ready" and the deployment command of
        "Drop." After each delivery, the loadmaster will report status of drop (load clear or
        status) and impact point whenever possible.
     24.5.3.5. Equipment Delivery in Forested Areas. Due to the possibility of equipment
     hang-up in trees, consideration should be given to attaching drop lines to equipment
     intended to be delivered by parachute. The drop line needs to be long enough to allow
 210                                                AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011


       the chute to hang up in treetops, and still permit ground forces to recover the equipment.
       In addition to the drop lines now in use by units (local design and manufacture), consider
       the possibility of using equipment already maintained on the aircraft, such as Sea Rescue
       Kit buoyant rope (210 ft long). Drop lines will be secured to the parachute riser
       snaps/connectors and equipment package "D/V rings" with carabineers or equivalent.
       The drop line will be assembled into accordion "S" folds, secured with retainer bands,
       and attached to the equipment package. NOTE: Final approach altitude should be
       adjusted to compensate for tree height, but never less than 150 ft above the treetops.
       24.5.3.6. Pattern for Night Aerial Delivery. NVGs may be used for night operations.
       Aircrews will accomplish the appropriate low-level checklist to configure the aircraft for
       NVG operations.
       24.5.3.7. Night Delivery. Equipment to be delivered at night will have marker lights
       attached. For water drops, attach the light by securing a double 5 ft length of type III
       nylon (550/cord) to the marker light, then attach the other end to the equipment. Stabilize
       the light to the equipment with type number 5 cord. Pass the parachute static line under
       the type number 5 cord to ensure light breakaway when deployed. For land drops,
       chemical lights are recommended. Attach chemical lights securely to prevent
       detachment.
24.6. Sea Rescue Kits.
   24.6.1. The Sea Rescue Kit consists of five bundles:
       24.6.1.1. The two end bundles (1 and 5) contain either a six, seven or 20 man raft.
       Bundles 2 and 4 contain emergency radios and bundle 3 contains medical gear.
       24.6.1.2. The total weight of all five bundles is 232 pounds for a MA-1 kit and 311
       pounds for a MA-2 kit.
       24.6.1.3. Each bundle is connected by 210 ft of buoyant rope.
       24.6.1.4. The kit is deployed manually off the cargo ramp.
   24.6.2. Rigging Sequence.
       24.6.2.1. Rigging sequence will be as shown in Figure 24.3
       24.6.2.2. During in-flight rigging, the cargo ramp and door will remain closed. Attach a
       tie-down strap across the kit to prevent movement.
       24.6.2.3. Unsnap the inflation lanyard protection flap of container #1 (raft), marked 1 of
       5 and leave open. Remove enough lanyard from the retaining loops to allow the snap
       fastener (yellow) to be fastened to ramp tie-down fitting 30F.
       24.6.2.4. Remove enough buoyant rope from container #1 to allow the rope fastener
       (red) to be connected to the D-ring (red) of container #2, marked 2 of 5.
       24.6.2.5. Remove enough buoyant rope from container #2 to allow the rope fastener
       (green) to be connected to the D-ring (green) of the container #3, marked 3 of 5.

     24.6.2.7. Remove enough buoyant rope from container #4 to allow the rope snap fastener
     (white) to be connected to the lanyard loop of container #5, marked 5 of 5.
     24.6.2.8. Unsnap the inflation lanyard protector flap on container #5 and leave open.
     Remove enough lanyard from the retaining loops to allow the snap fastener (yellow) to be
     fastened to the ramp tie-down ring 30B. NOTE: In high winds, the kit may be deployed
     with the rafts deflated to improve drop accuracy. If this procedure is necessary, the life
     raft inflation lanyard should be shortened and red streamers attached with the words
     "PULL TO INFLATE" on the streamers to facilitate inflation by the survivors. Detailed
     kit assembly, operation, and service instructions are contained in T.O. 14S-1-102.
  24.6.3. Rigging of Lights on Sea Rescue Kits for Night Airdrops:
     24.6.3.1. Lights are attached to containers 1, 3, and 5 (Refer to Figure 24.4 for
     procedures). The loadmaster will inspect the lights for proper function prior to
     installation.
  24.6.4. Airdropping a Sea Rescue Kit in Support of SAR:
     24.6.4.1. Aircrews will use the SEARCH checklist.
     24.6.4.2. The loadmaster will deploy the kit manually when the pilot states "Drop."
     NOTE: When delivering the Sea Rescue Kit manually, the loadmaster will deliver all
     kits starting with the number 1 container. The desired interval is .7 seconds between the
     containers, and all five containers must be delivered within 3.3 seconds to prevent line
     breakage and/or damage to the kit.
     24.6.4.3. Any delay by the loadmaster after the pilot states "Drop" might cause the kit to
     land long.
     24.6.4.4. The loadmaster will use the personnel restraint system or a restraint harness
     with the lifeline attached to a tie-down ring no further aft than FS 677, or anchor cable
     with an anchor cable stop positioned at FS 737. The restraint harness lifeline will be
     adjusted to allow movement to FS 835. NOTE: The loadmaster will ensure all checklist
     items are completed, maintain control of bundles, monitor and rerig any loose
     straps/static lines or equipment that may come undone due to wind blast.

24.7. Pyrotechnics:
   24.7.1. General.   This section provides information in preparation for launching
   pyrotechnics. Refer to T.O. 11A10-24-7, T.O. 11A10-26-7, T.O. 11A10-27-7, and T.O.
   11A10-28-7.
214                                                 AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011


  24.7.2. Hazards. In general, pyrotechnics contain materials of a hazardous nature. Even
  though each of the ingredients in a pyrotechnic composition may be relatively stable within
  itself, it may react with one or more of the other materials to cause deterioration and create an
  even greater hazard. Pyrotechnics are more dangerous than many other types of ammunition
  because they are more easily activated. These items should not be handled roughly or
  exposed to moisture. When subjected to fire, most pyrotechnics burn with intense heat.
      24.7.2.1. Toxic Hazards. Many chemicals used in pyrotechnic devices are poisonous if
      taken internally. This also applies to the residues of burned pyrotechnics. From an
      inhalation standpoint, the products of pyrotechnic devices and smoke generators present a
      serious problem. Although most of the smoke and fumes given off by pyrotechnics are
      considered non-toxic, heavy concentrations in closely confined spaces are dangerous and
      may be lethal, for they reduce the amount of available oxygen in the air.
  24.7.3. Handling. Besides the hazardous basic compositions, pyrotechnics contain sensitive
  elements such as fuses, friction compositions, and primers. Pyrotechnics should be handled
  with care and protected against moisture, shock, friction, or heat. Care should be taken to
  avoid premature ignition or damage that may cause failure when fired. Boxes containing
  pyrotechnics should not be dropped or thrown. Protective or safety devices should not be
  removed until just before use. Care should be taken to avoid damage to fiber cases and rip
  cords located outside the casing of flares. Pyrotechnics should be handled so as to avoid
  denting or deforming the barrel or case. Do not use pyrotechnics that are dented, deformed,
  cracked, broken, or have signs of advanced rust, loped closing, or have shipping covers with
  an illegible lot number, manufacture date, or other required identifying information.
  Pyrotechnics will be handled only under the supervision of a competent, qualified person.
  Most pyrotechnics burn with intense heat; therefore, personnel should be adequately prepared
  to handle an emergency situation (e.g., heat resistant gloves and broom).
  24.7.4. Storage. Units that have a requirement for storing pyrotechnics will obtain a license
  from the host base.
  24.7.5. Issue Procedures. Pyrotechnics that have been issued for training purposes will be
  marked in bold capital letters with the word TRAINING. These pyrotechnics will always be
  stored separately from operational stock within storage areas.
  24.7.6. Safety. All of the pyrotechnics described contain combustible chemicals which,
  when ignited, generate a flame or smoke (or combination of both) for a broad variety of
  purposes. These purposes include visual signaling, area or target illumination, and point
  marking. Most are intended to burn with intense heat.
      24.7.6.1. Initiation Mechanism. Pyrotechnic devices normally are equipped with some
      type of safety pin, lock, or tape designed to prevent accidental activation of the initiation
      mechanism. Any pyrotechnic which shows sign of damage to safety features is
      considered unserviceable and must be carefully segregated for prompt disposition by
      EOD.
      24.7.6.2. Accidental Initiation. If a pyrotechnic device should be accidentally ignited, in
      all cases its functioning will result in a fire hazard. The gases generated by this
      combustion could present a serious toxic hazard. Signaling devices containing propellant
      charges create an extremely dangerous missile hazard if accidentally ignited.
AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011                                                              215


     24.7.6.3. Fighting Pyrotechnic Fires.          Pyrotechnic compositions characteristically
     contain their own oxidants, and therefore do not depend upon atmospheric oxygen for
     combustion. For this reason, excluding air from a pyrotechnic fire usually is ineffective.
     Many pyrotechnic mixtures, particularly illuminating flare compositions, burn with
     intense heat up to 4,500 degrees F. Normally, available extinguishers are of little or no
     value in fires of this kind, and in addition, may produce toxic or poisonous gases.
     24.7.6.4. Safe Altitudes and Distances. Flares not entirely burned out and cooled when
     they land may ignite combustible material. Safe altitudes and distances depend upon the
     burning time, rate of descent, and drift of the flare. Such factors will be considered in
     determining minimum altitudes and distances of release. Signal flares are also a potential
     fire hazard when the parachute fails to support the signal properly. CAUTION: Flares
     will not be launched over areas subject to fire except in an extreme emergency. If such
     an emergency exists, flares should be dropped from sufficient altitude to allow complete
     burnout before hitting the surface.
     24.7.6.5. Reporting Instructions. Prepare instructions for mishaps, accidents, and
     incidents in accordance with AFI 91204. Prepare unsatisfactory reports in accordance
     with T.O. 00-35D-54.
  24.7.7. Pyrotechnics Launching:
     24.7.7.1. Personnel launching pyrotechnics through open doors or hatches will wear a
     restraint harness or parachute, and will have arramed or heat resistant gloves and a broom
     or wood stick readily available in case of fire. Wearing nomex gloves when deploying
     pyrotechnics is recommended. When manually launching parachute flares from the
     aircraft, only the cargo ramp will be opened unless the mission dictates otherwise. (This
     is to assist in eliminating pyrotechnics missile hazard.)
     24.7.7.2. The aircraft will be prepared for flare jettison prior to handling any
     pyrotechnic. Only the cargo ramp will be opened unless mission requirements dictate
     otherwise. All parachute flares hand-launched from the ramp will use a 10 ft lanyard
     (Refer to Figure 24.5) The flare will be hand-launched upon command of the PIC or
     designated crew member. CAUTION: Personnel launching flares will ensure the
     lanyard system is clear of extremities and equipment before launching. Excess lanyard
     should be accordion folded and held against the body of the flare or taped with paper
     tape.
  24.7.8. Pyrotechnics Description and Operation:
     24.7.8.1. LUU-2/B, 2A/B; Flare, Aircraft Parachute:
         24.7.8.1.1. Description. The LUU-2/B, 2A/B is an air-launched parachute flare. It is
         36 inches long, 4.875 inches in diameter and rated as providing 2-million
         candlepower illumination for approximately 300 seconds (5 minutes). Some uses are
         illumination of areas for crash landing, ditching, landing, target, dropping of supplies,
         hovering of rescue aircraft, etc.
         24.7.8.1.2. Operation. Remove the flare from shipping container and set desired ft of
         fall in flare timer end cap. A setting of 500 ft represents a time delay of 6.3 seconds.
         A launch altitude of 3,000 ft AGL is recommended and will provide a light at 2,500 ft
216                                                 AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011


         AGL. The flare descends approximately 2,500 ft during burning and will burn out
         and dump at ground level. The snap hook in the lanyard package of the flare shipping
         container may be used for the flare attaching end. The 10 ft lanyard secured to a tie-
         down ring near the aft end of the ramp will be attached to the lanyard or to the timer
         dial knob. Upon launch signal, toss the flare overboard from the rear of the ramp, or
         floor jettison port with ignition end out first (ignition end is opposite from the timer
         end cap). A force of 30 to 35 pounds is required to extract the timer dial knob and
         drogue cover strip. The knob and cover strip will remain with the static line.
         Retrieve the static line and remove the timer dial knob from the snap hook. Stow the
         timer dial knob until mission is over; then dispose of all residue.
      24.7.8.2. LUU-4B; Flare, Aircraft Parachute:
         24.7.8.2.1. Description. The LUU-4/B is an air-launched parachute flare. It is 25.5
         inches long, 4.875 inches in diameter, and rated as providing 1.6-million candlepower
         illumination for approximately 180 seconds (3 minutes). Uses are the same as the
         LUU-2/B, 2A/B.
         24.7.8.2.2. Operation. The flare altitude should be planned so as that burnout occurs
         approximately 300 ft AGL over water and higher over land. Recommend maximum
         deployment airspeed of 200 KIAS/KCAS due to possible failure of the parachute
         system. Manual launch procedures are the same as LUU-2/B procedures.
      24.7.8.3. LUU-2/B, LUU-2A/B, LUU-4/B Emergency Procedures:
         24.7.8.3.1. Premature timer release/ignition in aircraft or storage container: Nylon
         cord - Cut; Container - Taped; Pilot - Notified. WARNING: In the event the timer
         end cap is separated from the flare, do not pull on the nylon cord or the parachute.
         An approximate 50-pound pull on one of the suspension cables of the parachute will
         cause the flare to ignite. Return the flare to the shipping container and turn flare over
         to EOD at mission completion.
         24.7.8.3.2. Pre-ignition of Flare: Jettison flare or container immediately; Pilot -
         notified. WARNING: In the event of flare ignition, an attempt will be made to
         jettison the flare. In event of candle ignition, intense light, heat, and lethal gas will be
         experienced. Adequate respiratory, eye, and hand protection will be sought as soon
         as emergency permits. Flare suppression will be attempted as a last resort.
         24.7.8.3.3. Flare breakaway fails to release: Static line - Cut; Pilot - Notified.
         WARNING: Packaged aircraft parachute flares dropped in excess of 3 ft or
         unpackaged flares dropped in excess of 1 ft shall be considered unserviceable.
      24.7.8.4. MK-6 MOD 3; Signal, Smoke, and Illumination, Aircraft:
         24.7.8.4.1. Description. This signal marker provides long burning (approximately 40
         minutes) surface smoke and illumination for day or night use. It is used to mark
         sightings at sea, make sea evaluations, marking a sea lane for night water landing, and
         to simulate targets for the firing of weapons. It may be used to provide smoke on
         land surfaces if a fire hazard does not exist.
         24.7.8.4.2. Operation. Prior to launching the signal marker, remove the adhesive
         tape covering the pull ring.     WARNING: The smoke signal has a 90 second
AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011                                                               217


         ignition delay and must be launched immediately after the igniter has been actuated.
         WARNING: Packaged signal markers dropped in excess of 10 ft or unpackaged
         signals dropped in excess of 5 ft shall be considered unserviceable, and reported to
         OO-ALC/MMWR, Hill AFB, UT 84056-5609. WARNING: Do not prepare more
         than 2 marks at a time, and do not remove more than 4 marks at a time from the
         storage container in-flight.      NOTE: Do not remove the four square patches of
         adhesive tape covering the metal caps in the holes from which flame and smoke issue
         after ignition of the candle. At the time the signal is launched, the pull-type igniter is
         actuated by hand.
     24.7.8.5. MK-25 MOD 3; Marker, Location Marine:
         24.7.8.5.1. Description. This marker was designed for day or night use for all
         surface reference point marking purposes that call for smoke and flame in the 13 to
         18 minute range.
         24.7.8.5.2. Operation. To activate the marker, the base plate must be rotated from
         the safe to the armed position to allow the battery cavity ports to be opened. Open the
         ports by pressing the two brass-colored port plugs into the battery cavity using the
         thumb and forefinger. A one-pound force is required for plug removal. This device
         is considered to be a sealed unit until either or both base plugs have been pushed in.
         WARNING: The MK-25 must not be returned to storage with the base plugs pushed
         in. The nose end of this marker must be kept out of line with the body or with other
         personnel at all times. If marker is initiated, the nose plug is expelled with
         considerable force creating a missile hazard.
         24.7.8.5.3. Special Precautions. This marker may be converted for use in fresh water
         by adding 1/2 or 3/4 ounces of table salt or two salt tablets through the base plugs.
         WARNING: Converted markers must be used after adding salt. They must not be
         returned to storage. If not used, they must be jettisoned in-flight, over water.
         CAUTION: Be sure salt is not exposed to moisture before and during the conversion
         process, as moist salt may cause marker to ignite. CAUTION: Packaged flares
         dropped in excess of 6 ft or unpackaged flares dropped in excess of 3 ft shall be
         considered unserviceable. Report to OOALC/MMWR, Hill AFB, UT 84056-5609.
         NOTE: Converted markers will not perform as reliably in fresh water as unconverted
         markers in seawater.
  24.7.9. MC130P Flare Launcher Loading. The flare launcher may be loaded in-flight or on
  the ground. Takeoffs and landings may be made with the flare launcher loaded; however, the
  system will be deactivated. WARNING: Do not load or unload the flare launcher tubes
  while the aircraft is taxiing.        WARNING: The aircraft must be depressurized and the
  system deactivation switch (located on the winch operators control panel) placed in the
  deactivate position prior to landing. A flare should not be removed from the stowage area
  until the tube is ready to be loaded.
     24.7.9.1. Depressurize the aircraft.
     24.7.9.2. Place the deactivation switch to the deactivate position. NOTE: Prior to
     loading, open the manually operated hydraulic shut off valve (located approximately FS
218                                                 AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011


      850, left side) for the flare launcher system. This will allow manual jettisoning of flare or
      smoke in the event of accidental ignition during loading operations.
      24.7.9.3. Open the cover on the flare launcher tube and remove the old lanyard, or pull
      ring and cable assembly, if required.
      24.7.9.4. Using the handle on the spring-loaded ejector plate, pull forward on the plate
      and secure the handle over the hook at the top of the tube. WARNING: In preparation
      for loading of pyrotechnics, a pair of arramed gloves will be within reach, and a broom
      handle or similar item will be within immediate access to push out a pyrotechnic in case
      of accidental ignition.
      24.7.9.5. Remove the pyrotechnic from its container or sidewall storage rack, and place
      in the tube. Make sure the nose of the pyrotechnic is pointing downward and resting
      against the ejection door. WARNING: During the next procedure, take care not to allow
      the spring loaded ejector plate to slip from your grip and strike the flare.
      24.7.9.6. Unhook the ejector plate and ease it down against the top of the flare.
      24.7.9.7. Feed the end of the lanyard through the elongated hole in the ejector plate.
      Route the lanyard under the ejector plate handle, and attach to the hook at the forward
      end of the flare launcher tube. NOTE: Ensure serviceability of the retaining clip on the
      flare launcher tube hook. A missing or bent retaining clip could allow the lanyard to
      disengage from the hook during launch operations and deactivate the flare. NOTE: All
      excess lanyard will be coiled in the recess at the top end of the flare, and held in place by
      the ejector plate. Slack in the launcher lanyard will be kept to a minimum to prevent
      fouling.
      24.7.9.8. Close the latch and flare tube cover.
      24.7.9.9. Repeat these procedures for each tube to be loaded.
  24.7.10. Manufacture of Flare Delivery Lanyard. The following materials are required to
  manufacture a flare delivery lanyard with protective cover:

               MC130 INFILTRATION/EXFILTRATION PROCEDURES

A2.1. General Procedures.
   A2.1.1. Infil/Exfil Procedures. Use this guidance when conducting infil/exfil operations.
   These procedures are only authorized when conducting infil/exfil operations with dedicated
   unconventional forces and foreign counterparts. All personnel in the cargo compartment will
   be seated and secured except those crew members having valid duties to perform.
       A2.1.1.1. Rapid Infiltration (―Rapids‖). Rapids are a tactical method of onloading or
       off-loading dedicated unconventional and SOF Forces. Spring-loaded, latch-activated,
       folding ramps (canary slides), or ground loading ramps are used to off-load and onload
       vehicles, personnel, and H-6 series helicopters in minimal time. Selection of the
       onload/off-load point and aircraft orientation impacts total ground times. Extensive pre-
       mission planning/static load training may be required for large or complex loads.
       EXCEPTION: Group commander/COMAFSOF (for contingency operations) may
       authorize Rapid Infil/Exfil procedures and floor loading with non-SOF personnel to meet
       unit training requirements.
   A2.1.2. Preparation. Prepare aircraft for infil/exfil IAW 1C130A9.
   A2.1.3. Loadmaster Preflight:
       A2.1.3.1. Blackout covers should be in place for all missions flown in a hostile
       environment at night.
       A2.1.3.2. Chemical lights will be attached to each emergency exit handle. Apply tape to
       allow a small amount of light to shine through.
       A2.1.3.3. Emergency exit lights will be armed/off (as required).
       A2.1.3.4. Cargo compartment lights will be set (as required)- set.
       A2.1.3.5. Door warning lights will be taped (as required).
       A2.1.3.6. Turn off cargo floor, crew entrance door, and nose gear inspection lights.
       A2.1.3.7. Jump lights will be taped (as required).
   A2.1.4. Approved Deviations. Personnel inside vehicles will be properly secured either with
   vehicle seat belts or personnel restraining devices (e.g., Swiss seats) for takeoffs and
   landings. Do not exceed maximum vehicle gross weights. All other personnel in the cargo
   compartment will be seated and secured using personnel restraint device or Passenger combat
   loading procedures. Crew members with valid duties (such as scanning) to perform are not
   required to be seated. NOTE: Users will provide their own personal restraint device. If
   user does not provide their own restraining devices, secure personnel using passenger combat
   loading procedures.
       A2.1.4.1. Loadmasters. Loadmasters are normally positioned in the paratroop door and
       secured in a troop door seat or with a modified restraint belt or swiss seat for takeoff and
       landings when using infil/exfil procedures.
AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011                                                            239


     A2.1.4.2. Drivers. All vehicle drivers will wear NVGs when driving vehicles on or off
     the aircraft under blacked-out conditions or when cargo compartment EL/NVG lighting is
     in use. If a vehicle driver does not have NVGs, the vehicle will be pushed or winched
     on/off the aircraft.
     A2.1.4.3. Aerial Delivery System (ADS). ADS arms will be disconnected/disengaged at
     the 10-minute warning. Reconnect/reengage ADS arms after takeoff as soon as mission
     requirements permit. EXCEPTION: Aircraft with modified ADS arms will follow
     normal procedures. NOTE: If airdrop operations are to be conducted over the ramp
     after the ADS arms have been disconnected, loadmasters will check the ramp/door in the
     ADS position (to facilitate checking the ADS/no-go light) prior to taking off/departure, if
     mission requirements allow.
     A2.1.4.4. Ramps. Canary slide ramps or auxiliary ground loading ramps may be
     installed in flight and remain installed during all phases of flight. NOTE: It may be
     impossible to remove the auxiliary ground loading ramps from the outboard fittings with
     the ramp rails installed and the ramp on the ground. If this occurs, raise the ramp to
     horizontal to remove the loading ramps.
  A2.1.5. Prohibited Actions.
     A2.1.5.1. Open carriage vehicles such as: quads, mules (6-wheeler), motorcycles, and
     mini-bikes will not allow drivers on vehicles for takeoffs and landings.
     A2.1.5.2. Personnel will not be inside helicopters for takeoff or landings.
     A2.1.5.3. For loads that have an item restrained to both the cargo floor and cargo ramp,
     open only the cargo door until the aircraft comes to a complete stop. The cargo ramp will
     not be lowered until the aircraft arrives at the off-load point and all restraints are
     removed.
     A2.1.5.4. Vehicles will not be started in flight. CAUTION: To prevent the possibility
     of carburetor vapor-lock, vehicles will not be started in flight.
     A2.1.5.5. The cargo ramp will not be lowered below horizontal until the aircraft comes
     to a complete stop at the off-load point.
     A2.1.5.6. Vehicles will not be onloaded/off-loaded while the center anchor cable
     supports are in the installed position.
     A2.1.5.7. Vehicle IR lights will not be used in or around aircraft.
     A2.1.5.8. Personnel will not loiter between vehicles while on the aircraft.
     A2.1.5.9. Personnel will not sit or extend arms or legs under vehicles.
     A2.1.5.10. Chemical lights attached to side escape hatch/crew entrance door handle will
     not be removed in flight at any time.
  A2.1.6. Ordnance Procedures.
     A2.1.6.1. 2.75-inch rockets and other missile-type arms may be taken out of shipping
     containers and shipping tubes. Safety rings must remain attached. They may be secured
     in the vehicle for storage or maintained by the user.
240                                                AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011


      A2.1.6.2. Machine gun/Gatling gun ammunition may be kept readily available but will
      not be breached (chambered) until exiting the aircraft.
      A2.1.6.3. Troops may maintain their own small arms ammunition, but weapons will not
      be breached (chambered) until exiting the aircraft.
      A2.1.6.4. All weapons will be cleared and on SAFE with muzzles pointing down prior to
      boarding the aircraft.
  A2.1.7. Fuel Limitations.
  A2.1.7.1. Vehicle fuel tanks will not exceed 75% full when positioned on the cargo floor.
  Fuel tanks for vehicles transported on the cargo ramp will not exceed 50% full.
  A2.1.7.2. The H-6 series helicopters‘ main and auxiliary tanks will not exceed 75% full.
  A2.1.7.3. Spare gas cans (DoT 5L, jerry type) must have serviceable rubber gaskets in place
  and be secured inside the vehicle. (EXCEPTION: Some types of vehicles provide for the
  storage of spare fuel cans outside of the vehicle. They will be secured to prevent puncture in
  the event of contact with the aircraft or another vehicle). In all cases, do not place fuel cans
  on the front or rear bumpers. Spare gas cans may be filled to their capacity. If placed on the
  aircraft floor, metal-to-metal contact is not allowed. NOTE: Total combined fuel quantity
  for a vehicle and DoT 5L jerry cans cannot exceed twice the vehicle fuel tank capacity.
  A2.1.8. Aircraft Configuration. See AFI 112MC130V3, and MDS specific Addenda as
  required. NOTE: Due to the unique requirements needed to perform infiltration/exfiltration
  procedures sound judgment and coordination with user personnel will dictate specific aircraft
  configuration beyond the basic aircraft configurations.
      A2.1.8.1. Cargo ramp and minimum necessary canary slides/ground loading ramps
      should be left extended until the latest possible time to facilitate bump plans at the
      intermediate staging base (ISB).
  A2.1.9. General Considerations.
      A2.1.9.1. Tape chemical lights to emergency exit handles to allow a small amount of
      light to shine through.   WARNING: Chemical lights attached to exit doors and
      emergency escape hatch handles will remain in place until mission completion
      A2.1.9.2. Tape may be used on the cargo compartment floor and tie-down rings to mark
      vehicle locations and tie-down points for exfil operations.     NOTE: Tape is usually
      installed at the ISB during static loading for exfil operations
      A2.1.9.3. Tying pairs of auxiliary ground loading ramps together with 1/2-inch tubular
      nylon or 550 cord can expedite closing operations.
      A2.1.9.4. The following are considerations for H-6 series helicopters.
      A2.1.9.5. Remove paratroop door jump platforms to prevent the tail/tail rotor from
      contacting them on rapid onload/off-load operations.
      A2.1.9.6. If dual rails are unable to be removed from the aircraft due to short notice
      tasking/mission requirements, up to three H-6 series helicopters may be loaded safely (if
      not equipped with modified tail boom). Extreme caution is needed during loading to
AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011                                                                241


      ensure the tail/tail rotor of the last aircraft will not contact the cargo door and
      ramp/canary slides or ground loading ramps when in the closed position.
      A2.1.9.7. Placement of the cargo winch may need to be off centerline to accommodate
      adequate clearance between the winch/bubble for the forward helicopter.
   A2.1.10. Restraint Requirements. All vehicles/helicopters will be restrained IAW Table 3.2,
   Restraint Requirements.

Table A2.1. Restraint Requirements.
      Weight of Vehicle                                Restraint Required
           (pounds)
 Less than 5,000            4 x 5,000-/10,000-pound straps (2 forward/2 aft)
 5,001 to 7,500             6 x 5,000-pound straps (4 forward/2 aft) or
                            4 x 10,000-pound straps/chains and devices (2 forward/2 aft)
 7,501 to 11,500            6 x 10,000-pound straps/chains and devices (4 forward/2 aft)
 11,501 to 12,100           10 x 10,000-pound straps/chains and devices (6 forward/4 aft)
 NOTE: Vehicles weighing more than 12,100 pounds will be secured IAW T.O. 1C-130A-9
 restraint criteria.

 NOTE: The rapid all-terrain vehicle (RATV) will be restrained using a minimum of six
 5,000/10,000 pound tie-down straps (four forward and two aft). The tie-down attachment
 points on the RATV are only rated at 5,000 pounds.

      A2.1.10.1. Restrain motorcycles, quads, and mini-bikes with one 5,000 pound tie-down
      strap each. Restrain quads weighing more than 1,500 pounds with three 5,000 pound tie-
      down straps. (The vertical strap centered over the seat will be left on during taxi, fwd
      and aft straps may be removed after 80 knot call.)
      A2.1.10.2. Motorcycle, quad, and mini-bike restraint may be attached to a propositioned
      chain connected to aircraft sidewall tie-down rings.
      A2.1.10.3. Restrain H-6 series helicopters with five 5,000 pound tie-down straps (two
      forward, two aft, and one tail boom, or as identified by the user). WARNING: Chains
      positioned across the right side emergency exit on MC130 aircraft will be connected to
      the side wall tie-down ring with a tie-down device to expedite removal in case of
      emergency egress. NOTE: 10,000 pounds straps may be used in lieu of the 5,000 pound
      straps for H-6 series helicopters. Users will provide straps when the 10,000 pound strap
      is used.
      A2.1.10.4. Leave approximately 24 inches of slack in the excess portion of the tie-down
      strap if possible. After the vehicle is restrained, the excess strap will be rolled and taped.
      Do not tape the excess portion to the taut side of the strap. Exception: The 5,000 pound
      straps used to tie down H-6 series helicopters will have slack folded and taped to the taut
      side of the strap with enough slack to allow removal/installation.
   A2.1.11. Static Load Training. Conduct static load training prior to all infil/exfil operations.
   Conduct static load training during daylight (or white lights), blacked-out, and high noise
   environments (e.g., GTC/APU, cheek rack blowers). For training, conduct static load
242                                               AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011


  training to your situation (e.g., day rapids only require day static load training). NOTE:
  Ensure vehicle and passenger configuration/load sequence is thoroughly validated by user
  and loadmaster
      A2.1.11.1. Generation IV ground loading ramps/canary slides (bifold ramps) will be
      used. Canary slide ramps are primary for helicopter onload/off-load but facilitate loading
      for all types of cargo. During helicopter onload use a full set of canary slides or five
      ground loading ramps if canary slides are not available. Five auxiliary ground loading
      ramps or three canary slide ramps will be used unless mission requirements allow fewer
      numbers to be used. (See T.O. 1C130A9 for limitations and preflight inspection
      requirements.)
      A2.1.11.2. Install/stow ramps using a minimum of two people.
      A2.1.11.3. Ramp intermediate roller conveyors should not be installed when canary
      slides are being used.
      A2.1.11.4. Ensure canary slides do not contact the cargo door during opening or closing.
      A2.1.11.5. Secure installed ramps with 1,000 pound tubular nylon (or suitable
      substitute), route through cable guides (canary slide ramps) or through structural member
      (auxiliary ground loading ramps) to ramp tie-down rings.
      A2.1.11.6. The loadmaster will notify personnel at 60, 30, 20, 10, 6, 1 minute(s), and
      immediately prior to landing. The 1 minute will be initiated when the navigator calls ―2
      Miles‖ or ―Expect Descent In 1 Mile.‖ Give a ―Prepare To Land‖ call when the
      navigator calls ―Minimums‖ or ―100 Ft AGL‖ (See T.O. 1C130[MDS]-1 for expanded
      INFIL/EXFIL checklist.)
  A2.1.12. Aircraft Egress, Familiarization, and Destruction Training.
      A2.1.12.1. Aircraft egress, familiarization, and destruction training will be conducted
      with the user participating in infil/exfil operations. This training is mandatory for all
      personnel prior to the mission and will be conducted during static load training. The
      aircraft loadmasters are responsible for conducting this training on their aircraft. NOTE:
      In cases where the crew which performed static load/egress training does not fly the
      mission, another crew from the same MDS may execute the mission, provided a detailed
      face-to-face briefing is conducted prior to execution with the original crew and the user.
      A2.1.12.2. Egress drills will be conducted during static load training. They will be
      conducted during daylight (or white light) and blacked-out/minimum EL/NVG lighting
      conditions.
      A2.1.12.3. All user personnel will practice the use of emergency exits and equipment.
      CAUTION: When demonstrating the use of overhead emergency exits, ensure user
      personnel are fully briefed on equipment that may be damaged (i.e., waveguides) during
      egress.
  A2.1.13. Off-load Operations.
      A2.1.13.1. Vehicles will be backed onto the aircraft. Park vehicles in lowest gear
      (neutral for diesel powered). Put automatic vehicles in park.
AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011                                                             243


     A2.1.13.2. Loadmasters will pass time warnings/advisories                 to    the   troop
     commander/departure airfield controlling officer (DACO).
     A2.1.13.3. All personnel will prepare for landing at the 6-minute advisory.
     A2.1.13.4. A loadmaster will remain on headset at all times (normally the left side
     loadmaster).
     A2.1.13.5. Loadmasters will use NVGs for all infil/exfil operations.
     A2.1.13.6. Cargo compartment EL/NVG lighting will be adjusted to the minimum
     setting required at the 6-minute advisory. Aircraft not equipped with EL/NVG lighting
     will turn the red lights off at the 6-minute advisory. Do not turn off/readjust lights until
     the troop commander/DACO confirms checks are complete. NOTE: EL/NVG lighting
     may be adjusted to minimum setting prior to the 6-minute advisory, provided the user is
     notified.
     A2.1.13.7. User personnel will initiate their ―80-knot‖ procedures upon hearing the ―80-
     Knot‖ call or when the aircraft ramp and door start to open.
     A2.1.13.8. All restraint devices except one forward and one aft (opposite corners) may
     be removed during taxi to the off-load point (one strap over seat for motorcycles, quads
     and mini-bikes will remain installed). Self-propelled vehicles must have drivers in place
     with brakes set prior to removing restraints. EXCEPTION: All restraints will remain on
     helicopters except for the tail boom until the aircraft has come to a complete stop.
     A2.1.13.9. Do not position the cargo ramp below horizontal until the aircraft comes to a
     complete stop at the off-load point. For areas where ground threats or mission
     requirements dictate minimum time on the ground, the loadmaster and the PIC will brief
     a countdown for movement of the ramp below horizontal. Caution must be exercised to
     ensure the ramp does not contact the ground before the aircraft stops.
     A2.1.13.10. Do not deploy canary slides/ground loading ramps until the ramp is
     positioned below horizontal and the aircraft has stopped
     A2.1.13.11. Clearance to off-load: A loadmaster will be positioned on the vehicle
     driver‘s side of the cargo ramp and raise both arms to signal clearance to off-load. The
     loadmaster will drop both arms to signal vehicle drivers to halt off-load operations.
     A2.1.13.12. Off-load vehicles and personnel as trained during statics.
     A2.1.13.13. Clear a stalled vehicle immediately to the aircraft right (engines 3 and 4) or
     as static trained to allow the off-load to continue. NOTE: If a time delay occurs before
     onloading/departure, turn off all EL/NVG lighting and raise the ramp approximately 12
     inches to allow the aircraft to be taxied in the event of an emergency.
  A2.1.14. Onload Operations.
     A2.1.14.1. A loadmaster will remain on headset at all times (normally the left side
     loadmaster).
     A2.1.14.2. Loadmasters will use NVGs for all infil/exfil operations.
     A2.1.14.3. EL/NVG lighting will be adjusted as required for the onload.
244                                                AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011


      A2.1.14.4. A loadmaster will be positioned on the aircraft left side or vehicle driver‘s
      side of the cargo ramp. The loadmaster will advise the troop commander/DACO when
      ready for loading. The troop commander/DACO will not clear personnel or vehicles to
      load until cleared by the loadmaster.
      A2.1.14.5. A loadmaster will be in the cargo compartment to marshal vehicles into
      position with IR chem-lights.
      A2.1.14.6. Load vehicles and personnel as trained during statics.
      A2.1.14.7. The loadmaster will coordinate with the troop commander/DACO to confirm
      all personnel and equipment are onboard and the onload is complete.
      A2.1.14.8. When the loadmaster has determined sufficient restraint has been applied to
      the load, (minimum of one forward and one aft) and it is safe to do so, the loadmaster will
      advise the crew ―Clear To Taxi.‖ Once the ramp and door are closed and locked, the
      cargo compartment EL/NVG lights may be turned to the maximum setting (if required).
      After all cargo and personnel restraint is checked, the loadmaster will advise the crew
      ―Closed Secured.‖

                       MC130 COMBAT OFF-LOAD PROCEDURES

A3.1. The method of combat off-load will be determined by the aircrew based on the conditions
at the off-load site.
A3.2. Cargo pallets, airdrop platforms, and CDS containers can be off-loaded without damage to
the aircraft with the cargo ramp in the horizontal position. Use the following methods for
combat off-load operations.
   A3.2.1. Method "A." Use this method to off-load single, multiple, ramp or married pallets,
   airdrop platforms, and CDS containers. Pallets, platforms, or CDS may be off-loaded in a
   train like fashion or one-by-one as the situation dictates. WARNING: Many explosive items
   have specific "drop" criteria that, if exceeded, render the item useless or dangerous to the
   user. With the exception of small arms ammunition (hazard class and division 1.4),
   explosives and munitions shall not be combat off-loaded without approval of MAJCOM/A3.
   EXCEPTION: Explosives and munitions rigged for airdrop may be combat off-loaded
   without MAJCOM/A3 approval. CAUTION: A taxiway or ramp at least 500 ft long is
   required; however, 1,000 ft is desired to provide a margin of safety. When pallets, platforms,
   or containers are off-loaded one at a time, use a longer taxiway based on the number to be
   off-loaded.
       A3.2.1.1. Single or double/triple married pallets may be off-loaded, without ballast,
       using this method provided their weight does not exceed 12,000 pounds, and the height of
       the pallets fall within cargo height jettison limit in section III of the flight manual or
       Chapter 5 of the cargo loading manual.
       A3.2.1.2. Airdrop rigged platforms up to 24 ft in length may be off-loaded, without
       ballast, using this method provided their weight does not exceed 12,000 pounds.
       NOTE: Single or married pallets and airdrop rigged platforms over 12,000 pounds may
       be off-loaded using this method, provided ballast or cargo equal to the difference between
       12,000 pounds and the weight of the pallets or platforms (to be off-loaded) remains in C
       through F compartments during off-load. Example: A 17,000 pound married pallet or
       airdrop platform requires 5,000 pounds of ballast or cargo to remain in C through F
       compartments during the off-load.
       A3.2.1.3. CDS bundles may be combat off-loaded using this method. The static line
       retriever will be used via manual activation; manual gate cut may be done if the retriever
       is inoperative. With the Centerline Vertical Restraint (CVR), off-load must be
       accomplished one side at a time if the total bundle weight exceeds 12,000 pounds. Non-
       CVR single stick may be off-loaded if the total weight is less than 12,000 pounds.
       Without the CVR, if the total weight of the bundles exceeds 12,000 pounds, bundles
       should be restrained in groups of four or less and off-loaded one group at a time. For the
       unplanned combat off-load of non-CVR bundles, restrain the bundles as described above.
       Perform an initial off-load via the static line retriever, and on sequential off-load remove
       aft restraint before clearing the pilot to taxi. Consider the slope of the off-load site, which
       may cause bundles to roll aft upon removal of restraint. CAUTION: When using
       method "A" on excessively rough, sharply undulating, or battle-damaged surfaces,
       damage to the aircraft ramp may occur. Reducing forward taxi speed on these surfaces
 248                                               AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011


       will reduce aircraft oscillation. The PIC must determine if the off-load area will permit
       the off-load operation to be conducted without damage to the aircraft or equipment.
       CAUTIONS: Method B. Use this method to off-load married pallets that do not fit the
       category for method A or for which no ballast is available for married pallets weighing
       between 12,000 to 15,000 pounds. Use four serviceable steel 55-gallon drums under each
       pallet to be off-loaded. The correct number of steel drums needed to complete this type
       of off-load must be available at the off-load site or must accompany the load when
       conditions at the off-load site are unknown. WARNING: The maximum weight for
       pallets to be off-loaded across the ramp at any one time when using method ―B is
       15,000 pounds.       WARNING: Do not use method B for airdrop-rigged platforms to
       prevent binding the platform under the vertical restraint rails.
   A3.2.2. Aircrew Procedures:
       A3.2.2.1. Prior to commencing combat off-load operations, the pilot will brief each crew
       member on the method to be used. Specific procedures are in the expanded checklist.
       A3.2.2.2. All crew members participating in the off-load will refer to the checklist.
       Report any problem to the pilot immediately.
       A3.2.2.3. If other individuals must be aboard to assist the crew in an unusual
       circumstance, give them a thorough safety and procedures briefing for the entire off-load
       sequence.
       A3.2.2.4. The loadmaster will maintain constant interphone contact with the PIC and is
       the only crew member authorized to operate the dual rail locks during combat off-load
       operations. WARNING: During the entire off-load operation, no one is permitted
       behind or beside the load unless the loadmaster checks that all rail locks are locked and
       engaged in the pallet detents or secures each pallet to aircraft tie-down rings to ensure
       positive aft restraint. WARNING: Always maintain forward restraint with the right-
       hand locks.

                  NOTE:
 The jumpmaster/safety will
 determine how the parachutist is
 entangled. If being towed by
 anything other than the static line,
 the jumpmaster will attempt to free
 the parachutist. If being towed by
 the static line, the jumpmaster/
 safety will recommend whether to
 retrieve or cut free. If all
 parachutists have exited and no
 safety is on board, this
 responsibility rests with the
 loadmaster.
                  NOTE:
 The parachutist will indicate
 consciousness and that a reserve
 parachute is ready by maintaining a
 tight body position with both hands
 on the reserve.
 5. Static Line                          Cut on Command
                  NOTE:
 It will be necessary to partially
 rewind the retriever cable to reach
 the static line for cutting
             WARNING:
 First priority is to cut the
 parachutist free if the parachutist
 indicated consciousness. If the
 parachutist is unconscious, does not
 signal, cannot be observed, or a
 condition exists that prevents
 cutting the static line, implement
 emergency retrieval procedures.
                  NOTE:
 If the decision is to retrieve follow
 the procedures below
 a. 5000lb Strap                         Installed
                  NOTE:
 To retrieve a parachutist over the
 aircraft ramp, the loadmaster will
324                                                  AFI11-2MC-130V3 22 DECEMBER 2011


install a 5000lb strap to the
emergency retrieval rings or
HSLLADS rings located at
approximately FS 848. Attach the
hook end of the strap on the ring
closest to the static line with the
hook facing forward on the
emergency retrieval rings/down on
the HSLLADS rings and attach the
ratchet end on the other side. Using
the static line retriever, the static
lines will be retrieved over the strap
and the parachutist will be brought
in by hand.
b. Static lines                          Retrieve static line(s) over the
                                         5000lb strap
            WARNING:
During retrieval attempts ensure the
parachutist does not slip back at any
time. This does not preclude
unwinding the static line retriever to
reset the slip clutch, if necessary.
            WARNING:
The last five feet are the most
crucial for the fouled parachutist. A
wildly oscillating parachutist
usually strikes the aircraft ramp
headfirst. If the parachutist is
oscillating violently, it may become
necessary to stop the retrieval
momentarily, allowing the
parachutist to stabilize, then
continue with the retrieval.
                  NOTE:
Once the parachutist is pulled up
into the ramp and is being
controlled, slightly unwind the
retriever cable so the parachutist
may be brought into the aircraft.
