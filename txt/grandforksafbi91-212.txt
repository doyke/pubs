1. GENERAL INFORMATION
   1.1. Overview
       1.1.1. A bird/wildlife aircraft strike hazard exists at Grand Forks AFB and its vicinity
       due to resident and migratory bird/wildlife species. Daily and seasonal bird movements
2                                        GRANDFORKSAFBI91-212 12 SEPTEMBER 2011


       create various hazardous conditions. This plan establishes procedures to minimize the
       hazards at Grand Forks AFB. A variety of techniques and organizations are involved in
       the control of the BASH program. This plan is designed to:
          1.1.1.1. Establish a Bird Hazard Working Group and designate responsibilities to its
          members.
          1.1.1.2. Establish procedures to identify high hazard situations, alert supervisors and
          aircrews, and provide guidance and an effective process to limit or discontinue flying
          operations when warranted.
          1.1.1.3. Establish aircraft and airfield operating procedures to avoid high-hazard
          situations.
          1.1.1.4. Provide means of disseminating bird hazard information and procedures for
          bird avoidance to all assigned and transient aircrews.
          1.1.1.5. Establish procedures and guidelines to decrease airfield attractiveness to
          birds IAW AFI 32-7064.
          1.1.1.6. Provide guidelines for dispersing birds when they congregate on the airfield.
       1.1.2. Airfield and local area maps include a detailed description of the base and its
       surroundings. This information is available in the Integrated Natural Resources
       Management Plan through 319 CES/CEAN, DSN 362-4774 / Commercial 701-747-4774,
       and covers the following areas: base location (county, state), base size (acre), base
       elevation, general topography (significant terrain features, rivers, lakes, ponds, and
       developed areas), landfill locations, sewage ponds, golf course, and other significant bird
       attractions.
    1.2. Execution
       1.2.1. Concept of Operations.
          1.2.1.1. Reducing the bird strike hazard at GFAFB requires a cooperative effort
          between several base organizations. The OPR for coordinating this plan is the 319
          ABW/SEF.
          1.2.1.2. Bird Hazard Working Group (BHWG).
              1.2.1.2.1. Function. Collects, compiles, and reviews data on bird/wildlife strikes.
              Identifies and recommends action to reduce hazards. Recommends changes in
              operational procedures.
              1.2.1.2.2. Authority. The BHWG submits all recommendations to the 319
              ABW/CV for approval. Implementation is through the normal chain of
              command.
              1.2.1.2.3. Composition. The chairman is the 319 ABW/CV. As a minimum, the
              group will consist of the following representatives: 319 ABW/CV, OSS/CC, 319
              ABW Flight Safety, Airfield Manager, Airfield Operations Flight Commander,
              Civil Engineering CEAN, and representatives from other tasked organizations
              (Attachment 2) as required. A representative from CBP UASOC-ND and any
              other tenant flying organizations should be invited to attend.
GRANDFORKSAFBI91-212 12 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                         3


            1.2.1.2.4. Meeting Schedule. The BHWG will meet prior to entering BASH
            Phase II (Chapter 4), but not less than semiannually, or as deemed necessary by
            the chairman of the BHWG. The BHWG will meet separate from the Quarterly
            Airfield Operations Board.
  1.3. Specific Hazards
     1.3.1. Waterfowl. Canada geese, snow geese, and assorted ducks present a significant
     hazard to the Grand Forks flying environment. The presence of waterfowl on the airfield
     is elevated during migration season (both spring and fall). Monitoring online hunting
     websites for the region will typically yield the best information on bird migration trends.
     To mitigate the risk of waterfowl aircraft strikes Grand Forks AFB typically implements
     BASH Phase II (discussed later) during spring and fall migration seasons.
     1.3.2. Swallows. During the summer months the majority of aircraft bird strikes are
     caused by swallows. Success in reducing the number of swallow strikes has been
     achieved by persistent removal of nests from buildings next to the flight line. Methods
     for removal include high pressure water for buildings with high eaves or a scraper tool
     with a long handle for buildings with lower eaves. Additionally, if applied early in the
     year, a bird proofing repellant can be added to problematic buildings to prevent nests
     from being constructed.
     1.3.3. Deer. Deer occasionally find their way into the airfield interior area where they
     pose a risk to aircraft on the runway. Airfield gates are to be closed to prevent deer from
     entering the airfield. Fence’s shall be inspected and repaired as needed to eliminate deer
     from entering the airfield as well. When multiple deer do enter the airfield area,
     depredation may become necessary to remove the hazard. Depredation should only be
     accomplished with the permission of the Base Commander and will be coordinated with
     Wing Safety, the Airfield Manager and the Civil Engineer Squadron.

       reduction to reduce BASH beyond the 1000' distance criterion is desired and will further
       reduce BASH potential.
       2.8.10. Incorporates the following practices into the Integrated Natural Resources
       Management Plan:
          2.8.10.1. Grass Height Management. Airfield mowing procedures shall maintain
          uniform grass height between 7 and 14 inches (refer to the yellow areas on the airfield
          grass height diagram in Attachment 4). Mowing frequency will be as needed to
          maintain height requirements. Coordinate mowing with periods of low flight activity.
          Grass must be cut before it goes to seed to discourage seed eating birds from utilizing
          the airfield. Long grass discourages flocking species from entering the airfield
          because reduced visibility disrupts interflock communication and flock integrity and
          also prevents predator detection. Grass normally should not exceed 14 inches, as
          high grass will attract some bird species and rodents that in turn attract raptors.
          Airfields with a variety of grass species may have a fast-growing strain reaching 14
          inches sooner than the rest of the airfield. Mowing will be conducted when the
          average grass height reaches 14 inches. Higher grass height may be allowed if the
          airfield is leased for hay production (refer to AFI 32-7064). Coordinate all requests
          outside the normal grounds maintenance contract with 319 CES/CEAN DSN 362-
          4774 / Commercial 701-747-4774. All herbicides have to be approved prior to use on
          the installation and all applicators certifications need to be verified.
          2.8.10.2. Broad-leafed weed control. Broad leaf weeds will be kept to a minimum on
          the airfield. Apply herbicides as a last resort after other integrated pest management
          practices (i.e. mowing and cultivating) as necessary for control of weeds. Broad leaf
GRANDFORKSAFBI91-212 12 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                       7


       weeds attract a variety of birds, may produce seeds or berries, and may limit grass
       growth.
       2.8.10.3. Planting bare areas. Bare areas are frequently used by birds as resting sites
       and should be eliminated on the airfield. Grass will be planted as necessary and
       appropriate irrigation maintained until 70% cover is established.
       2.8.10.4. Reducing edge effect. Edge effect refers to the highly attractive transition
       zone between two distinct habitat types (i.e., brush to grassland). The airfield will be
       maintained as uniformly as possible to reduce this effect.
       2.8.10.5. Leveling of airfield. Filling of wetlands is prohibited under EO 11990.
       Coordinate with 319 CES/CEAN DSN 362-4774 / Commercial 701-747-4774 to
       determine if the area of proposed action (leveling/filling) is a wetland.
       2.8.10.6. Dead vegetation such as brush piles, hay bales, etc., will be covered or
       removed as soon as possible.
       2.8.10.7. Pest control. Invertebrates and rodents provide important food sources for
       many birds. Civil Engineering Pest Management Section should periodically survey
       and reduce these pests when required. Pest Management can be contacted at DSN
       362-5201 / Commercial 701-747-5201 319 CES Customer Service. The airfield
       manager should request pest control services when deemed necessary.
       2.8.10.8. Drainage ditches. Ditches will be inspected regularly and kept clear and
       obstacle-free. Ditch sides will be maintained as steeply as possible to discourage
       wading birds and emergent vegetation. Vegetation will be removed as often as
       necessary to maintain flow and discourage use by birds. Contact 319 CES at DSN
       362-5201 / Commercial 701-747-5201 for work requests involving ditch
       maintenance.
       2.8.10.9. Erosion control vegetation. Appropriate vegetation should be used for the
       region and should support the BASH reduction philosophy--i.e. do not control
       erosion-using plants, which produce seeds at heights below 14-18 inches.
       2.8.10.10. Agricultural crop outleasing. Outleasing of crops should be consistent
       with BASH reduction philosophy. Hay is a suitable crop for runway lateral and
       approach clearance zones when properly managed. Refer to AFI 32-7064 for
       program requirements.
       2.8.10.11. Eliminate roosting sites. Vegetation management of roost sites will
       control blackbird and starling roosts where possible. Trees will be pruned to reduce
       the number of perches available, and entire trees or stands removed if necessary.
       2.8.10.12. Removal of birds from buildings and hangars. Rock pigeons, house
       sparrows, swallows and starlings frequently live in buildings and hangars and must be
       excluded from buildings. Denying access by screening windows, closing doors, and
       blocking entry holes is most effective. Other methods to be considered:
          2.8.10.12.1. ―Bird-Proof‖ gel, liquid, or granule. A sticky repellent manufactured
          by Bird-X. CES Pest Management will survey bird roosting sites and apply
          appropriate Bird-Proof products in locations that will affect the greatest number
          of birds.
8                                 GRANDFORKSAFBI91-212 12 SEPTEMBER 2011


       2.8.10.12.2. Pellet Guns. Shoot only permit-listed birds for a short-term solution
       for immediate relief due to mission need. Only permit subpermittees are
       authorized to take birds. Experience shows all birds cannot be removed using this
       technique. Proper safety equipment is necessary. A depredation permit is
       required for all birds except rock pigeons, house sparrows, and European
       starlings. Refer to 50 CFR 10.13 for a complete list of all protected bird species.
       Use depredation as a last resort. Prevention and exclusion methods must be
       exhausted prior to killing as indicated on permit rules.
       2.8.10.12.3. Netting. Install under superstructure to exclude pest birds from
       roosting areas. Ensure no gaps or holes are present for birds to get through.
       2.8.10.12.4. ―Flight Control‖. Goose repellent, sprayed on grass is particularly
       effective in sewage lagoon area.
       2.8.10.12.5. Trapping/Removal. Individual permits are required for this action;
       contact 319 CES/CEAN to obtain these permits. Use live traps baited with food
       and water to trap pest birds. Birds can be released away from the hangar.
       2.8.10.12.6. Design features. Consider structures with the support features
       located on the outside of the building to greatly reduce bird numbers. Consider
       this design when planning a new hangar.
       2.8.10.12.7. Door Coverings. Use netting or plastic strips suspended over the
       doors to exclude birds. Ensure no tears or holes are present to allow birds hangar
       access.
       2.8.10.12.8. Sharp Projections. Use in limited areas such as ledges, overhangs, or
       small places where birds cannot be allowed. Expense prohibits their use over the
       entire structure.
       2.8.10.12.9. Water/Air Harassment. Use high-pressure air or water to make
       hangars an undesirable roosting site. Persistence is the key. (Permit required)
       2.8.10.12.10. Bird Nest Removal. Use water or other means to wash/remove
       nests from hangars and buildings during nest construction IAW Chapter 2 of this
       plan and the wildlife permit.
    2.8.10.13. Other animal hazards to aircraft. Use methods to prevent animal entry to
    the airfield. Keep airfield gates closed to the maximum extent possible, install
    gate/fence deterrents, and improve fencing for deer and coyote exclusion. Use
    trapping methods or shooting for problem animals as a last resort. When necessary,
    cement fence posts, add height to fencing, and fill in low areas. Low areas shall be
    evaluated prior to filling to determine if wetlands exist. Coordinate with 319
    CES/CEAN at commercial 701-747-4774/DSN 362-4774 to obtain required
    individual permits for animal removal or activities affecting wetlands. Wetlands are
    protected under EO 119990. Individual permits are required specifically for animals
    not listed on the installation depredation permit, and each animal must be treated on a
    case-by-case basis (such as deer). Improve fencing for deer control. Cement fence
    posts when necessary, add height to fencing and fill in low areas.

4. BIRD HAZARD WARNING SYSTEM
    4.1. General. This operation establishes procedures to be used for immediate exchange of
    information between ground agencies and aircrews concerning the existence and location of
    birds which could pose a hazard to flight safety.
10                                     GRANDFORKSAFBI91-212 12 SEPTEMBER 2011


  4.2. Bird Watch Conditions.     The following terminology will be used for rapid
  communication to disseminate bird activity information and implement unit operational
  procedures. Bird locations should be given with the condition code. Phase periods are
  determined by the BHWG.
     4.2.1. PHASE I period. Indicates light bird activity. (Normally December-March and
     June-August)
     4.2.2. PHASE II period. Indicates heavy bird activity. (Associated with migratory
     seasons – normally Spring: April-May, Fall: September-November.)
     4.2.3. Bird Watch Condition Definitions (aircrew procedures for each condition are
     listed in 4.5.2.2 – 4.5.5).
         4.2.3.1. Bird Watch Condition LOW.         Bird activity on and around the airfield
         representing low potential for strikes.
         4.2.3.2. Bird Watch Condition MODERATE. Bird activity near the active runway or
         other specific location representing increased potential for strikes. BWC moderate
         requires increased vigilance by all agencies and supervisors, and caution by.
         4.2.3.3. Bird Watch Condition SEVERE. Bird activity on or immediately above the
         active runway or other specific location representing high potential for strikes.
         Supervisors and aircrews must thoroughly evaluate mission need before conducting
         operations in areas under condition SEVERE.
         4.2.3.4. Bird Watch Alert. Weather, time of day, and seasonal conditions which
         make an influx of birds onto the airfield likely.
     4.2.4. Declaration of a bird watch condition will be based on any of the following:
         4.2.4.1. Information relayed by airborne aircraft to ATC or Command Post.
         4.2.4.2. Ground observations and information passed to the Airfield Manager or his
         designated representative, the Tower Watch Supervisor, or the Wing Flight Safety
         Office.
         4.2.4.3. Bird strike risk and trend information from the United States Avian Hazard
         Advisory System (www.usahas.com).
  4.3. Authority. During normal flight operations the authority to upgrade the bird watch
  condition is vested with the Airfield Manager or his designated representative, the Senior Air
  Traffic Controller, and/or the Wing Flight Safety Office. The Airfield Manager (or
  designated representative) is the central authority in downgrading the BWC. Upgrading the
  BWC should err on the side of safety, and can be declared based on ground observations,
  pilot reports, radar observations, etc. Before downgrading the BWC, the Airfield Manager
  should consider all available resources.
  4.4. Communications. Bird watch conditions will be disseminated by the following means:
  During periods of flight operations, bird watch conditions will be posted at Base Operations.
  For any changes in the BWC, Base Operations will be the primary point of contact. When
  the Bird Hazard Condition changes, the Airfield Manager will dispatch the Bird Harassment
  Team for investigation and dispersal. Base Operations will notify the Tower, Command
GRANDFORKSAFBI91-212 12 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                      11


  Post, and RAPCON. Command Post will notify Wing Safety and the Predator Operations
  Center (POC) 747-8116.
     4.4.1. Base Operations personnel will post a NOTAM for BWC MODERATE or
     SEVERE. During Phase I, current bird conditions other than low will be included in the
     Automatic Terminal Information Service (ATIS) broadcasts. During Phase II, ATIS will
     always state the current BWC and, if available, the corresponding trend data as obtained
     from the United States Avian Hazard Advisory System (www.usahas.com).
  4.5. Aircrew Responsibilities and Procedures (reserved for future use).
     4.5.1. Aircrew Planning.
         4.5.1.1. USAF aircrews (reserved for future use).
         4.5.1.2. UASOC-ND aircrews responsibilities and procedures for bird avoidance and
         mitigation will be set by the Director of Air Operations, UASOC-ND.
  4.6. Procedures for Command Post. If a bird activity report is received from airborne
  aircraft, notify Airfield Management and complete appropriate checklist.
  4.7. Downgrading. Once a BWC is declared every effort must be made to downgrade the
  condition commensurate with updated information. Any recommendations to downgrade
  the bird watch condition must be coordinated through Base Operations. Base
  Operations (Airfield Manager or designated representative) will approve the downgrading
  and notify OSS/CC, Tower, RAPCON, and Command Post.
  4.8. Airfield Management Procedures. During normal airfield surveillance, airfield
  management will monitor bird populations, grass height, drainage ditches, etc., and report
  problems to the appropriate OPRs for modifying or eliminating the problem(s). HQ AMC
  and locally developed metrics will be used to report bird watch conditions and harassment
  actions taken to the BHWG.
  4.9. Depredation. Any requirement for killing birds/wildlife and the desired method of
  depredation will be determined jointly by Airfield Management, Wing Safety Office, the
  Civil Engineer Squadron and Security Forces (if firearms are to be used). Once established,
  CES will ensure proper permits are procured from state and federal agencies prior to
  depredation activity. State and federal agency assistance is desirable. Personnel will notify
  the Base Defense Operations Center at 747-5351 prior to initiating depredation operations.
