                                       INTRODUCTION

1.1. Program Management. This instruction implements policy, assigns responsibility and
establishes procedures for motor vehicle traffic supervision on McConnell AFB. This instruction
provides additional Air Force and local installation guidance to complement AFI 31-218(I),
Motor Vehicle Traffic Supervision and AFMAN 31-116 (AMC Supplemented), Air Force Motor
Vehicle Traffic Supervision. The objective of traffic control programs is the safe and efficient
flow of vehicles and pedestrians through reduction of factors contributing to accidents.
1.2. Responsibilities. Installation Defense Force Commander (DFC). The DFC is the
Installation Commander's principal advisor on issues pertaining to the lawful movement of
personnel and traffic. The DFC exercises staff responsibility for directing, regulating and
controlling traffic, and enforcing installation rules pertaining to traffic control. DFCs assist
traffic engineers by performing traffic control studies to gather information on traffic problems
and use patterns.
1.3. Delegation of Authority. Installation commanders may delegate their responsibilities
under this instruction to their vice commanders, mission support commanders or other group
commanders as appropriate and provided the individual does not occupy a position such as law
enforcement which would constitute a conflict of interest. Commanders should coordinate
letters of delegation through their Staff Judge Advocates (SJAs).
     1.3.1. The 22 MSG/CC and 22 MSG/CD are the designated officials for administration of
     this instruction.
     1.3.2. The term “law enforcement officer” as used throughout this instruction refers to any
     Security Forces member or employee performing law enforcement and/or installation
     security duties, to include entry control.
1.4. Traffic Safety Board. The Installation Commander will establish a McConnell Traffic
Safety Board (MTSB) responsible for advising the Installation Commander through the DFC and
22 MSG/CC in reference to traffic and parking issues. The primary purpose of the MTSB is to
review traffic flow, parking, enforcement, engineering and traffic education programs affecting
the safety of people and mission effectiveness.
     1.4.1. A delegated representative shall chair the MTSB. Other members will include wing
     safety, the installation traffic engineer, a representative of the local labor union and
     representatives from other emergency response agencies as deemed appropriate by the DFC.
     1.4.2. The MTSB shall convene annually or as directed by 22 ARW/CC or 22 MSG/CC for
     statistical analysis of the preceding year and to discuss matters of concern for traffic and
     pedestrian safety.
     1.4.3. The MTSB shall convene annually on a separate occasion to brief the Installation
     Commander and Senior Support Staff on the results of statistical analysis and discussion. The
     MTSB shall present any recommendations and implementation strategies at this briefing.

                                  DRIVING PRIVILEGES

2.1. Requirements for Driving Privileges. Assigned personnel and family members must
obtain a valid and proper driving license from Kansas or their State of legal residency (home of
record) within 30 days of arrival to McConnell AFB. International driver’s licenses and licenses
issued by MAJCOMs for overseas locations are recognized on McConnell AFB, with the
exception of foreign national students who are temporarily assigned to MAFB for training.
   2.1.1. Operating a motor vehicle on MAFB is a privilege granted by the Installation
   Commander.
   2.1.2. Government motor vehicle operators must register with the 22 LRS/Vehicle
   Operations IAW AFI 24-301, Vehicle Operation and AFI 24-309, Fleet Management. All
   operators of government-owned vehicles (GOV/GSA) must have in their possession at all
   times and AF Form 2293, USAF Motor Vehicle Operator’s Identification Card and a valid
   state driver’s license and/or international driver’s license.
   2.1.3. Vehicle Registration and Insurance. KSA 8-244 requires drivers to produce a valid
   driver’s license upon request of a law enforcement officer. KSA 40-3104 requires drivers to
   produce proof of minimum liability insurance upon request of a law enforcement officer. 22
   ARW IDP, Annex C, Appendix 1, Tab A, pg. 57 requires drivers to produce proof of valid
   State registration for any vehicle operating on McConnell AFB.
       2.1.3.1. Many States provide exceptions or leniency concerning vehicle registration
       periods and driver’s license renewal requirements for Active Duty military personnel
       when stationed outside their state of legal residency. For all state information refer to
       http://drivinglaws.aaa.com/laws/drivers-license-renewal/
       2.1.3.2. People choosing to maintain license plates and registration from their State of
       legal residency must comply with that State’s vehicle registration laws and policies.
       Some States require safety, emissions, or other inspections as a condition of maintaining
       license plates from that State. Failure to maintain those requirements will render the
       registration void and prohibit operation of that vehicle on McConnell AFB.
2.2. Stopping and Inspecting Personnel or Vehicles.
   2.2.1. AFI 31-101, Integrated Defense, and AFI 10-245, Antiterrorism, require Installation
   Commanders to develop instructions and guidance that detail stop, inspection, search and
   impoundment of motor vehicles at CONUS installation entry gates, to include Air Force
   restricted and controlled areas.
   2.2.2. Random Installation Entry/Entry Vehicle Checks and inspections/searches during
   Directed Anti-Terrorism Measures. The requirements of these programs are defined in the
   22 ARW Integrated Defense Plan (IDP) Annex C, Appendix 1, Tabs C-D and 22 ARW
   OPLAN 10-245, Annex C, Appendix 4.
2.3. Implied Consent to Blood, Breath or Urine Tests. Persons who drive on the installation
shall be deemed to have given their consent to evidential tests for alcohol or other drug content
of their blood, breath, or urine when lawfully stopped, apprehended, or cited for any offense
 6                                               MCCONNELLAFBI31-116 25 MARCH 2014


allegedly committed while driving or in physical control of a motor vehicle on military
installations to determine the influence of intoxicants. This requirement must be outlined as part
of installation new comers briefings and/or in-processing of newly assigned personnel. Unit
Commanders are responsible to brief all personnel on the Implied Consent requirements outlined
in AFI 31-218(I).
     2.3.1. After coordination with the SJA, unit commanders will direct drug and/or alcohol
     testing within 24 hours of suspected alcohol related motor vehicle/traffic incidents or
     misconduct, or where there is reasonable suspicion of drug use and the member refuses to
     provide consent for testing. Commanders are also encouraged to ensure Blood Alcohol Tests
     (BAT) are taken as soon after the incident as possible to determine the level and intensity of
     alcohol involvement.
2.4. Implied Consent to Vehicle Impoundment. Any person granted the privilege to operate
or register a motor vehicle on a military installation shall be deemed to have given his or her
consent for the removal and temporary impoundment of the POV as determined by the
installation commander or applicable authority. Such persons further agree to reimburse the
United States or private entity for the cost of towing and storage should their motor vehicle be
removed or impounded.
     2.4.1. Unit Commanders are responsible for briefing all personnel and must include the
     consequences when personal property is abandoned during familiarization and indoctrination
     training into units. Additionally, measures must be established to ensure personal effects are
     cleared prior to personnel departing on permanent change-of-station orders. Specific criteria
     for impoundment and detailed procedures are found in chapter 7 of this instruction.
2.5. Suspension. Authority to suspend and revoke driving privileges has been delegated to 22
MSG/CC, 22 MSG/CD and when applicable, to individual unit commanders. The 22 MSG/CC
determines suspension and revocation guidance for non-moving violations, as well as what
constitutes a non-moving violation on the installation. These standards are part of the local
installation traffic code. Detailed information is located in chapter 6 and attachment 2 of this
instruction.
     2.5.1. Personnel with restricted, suspended or revoked driving privileges are entered into
     both Defense Biometric Identification System (DBIDS) and Security Forces Management
     Information System (SFMIS). The Suspension, Revocation, Barment and Warrant (SRBW)
     is used by base entry controllers and Visitor Control Center (VCC) technicians to monitor
     compliance. DBIDS also has adverse actions listed to alert installation entry controllers.
        2.5.1.1. 22 SFS/S-5R will generate an updated SRBW every Friday (or Thursday if
        Friday is a non-duty day) and distribute hard/electronic copies to each installation entry
        point, Base Defense Operation Center (BDOC), the VCC and Commercial Search
        Facility.
     2.5.2. Revocation of Driving Privileges. The 22 MSG/CC will immediately revoke driving
     privileges for a period of not less than one year when a serious incident involving a motor
     vehicle occurs and the 22 MSG/CC determines immediate revocation of driving privileges is
     required to preserve public safety or the good order and discipline of military personnel.
     Refer to Attachment 2 Revocation Matrix for further information.
MCCONNELLAFBI31-116 25 MARCH 2014                                                                7


     2.5.2.1. A suspension or revocation of driving privileges is a prohibition of operating all
     motor vehicles to include mopeds and scooters under 50cc.
     2.5.2.2. For Driving Under the Influence/ Driving While Intoxicated (DUI/DWI) cases,
     Security Forces (SF) will issue a preliminary revocation letter after coordination with 22
     ARW/SJA and 22 MSG/CC. The revocation becomes mandatory on conviction or other
     findings that confirm the charge.
     2.5.2.3. If multiple suspensions/revocations are imposed, they will run consecutively. In
     cases involving extensions of suspensions or revocations, the date of the new suspensions
     or revocation will be the effective date of the most recent incident.
  2.5.3. Rebuttal and Reinstatement Hearings. Requests for hearings must be made in writing
  no later than 14 calendar days from the date the preliminary suspension letter was issued.
  Individual must write an MFR to 22 MSG/CC appealing the revocation of their driving
  privileges. Active duty personnel, dependent family members, DOD Civilians and contract
  employees, requesting a hearing will submit a memorandum outlining the reason for the
  request and will forward the memorandum to their commander for a recommendation letter.
  Retired personnel or civilians with no military affiliation will submit their letter to 22 SFS/S-
  5R section to be concurred or non-concurred by the 22 SFS/CC; these letters will then be
  forwarded to the 22 MSG/CC for final determination.
     2.5.3.1. All hearings will be scheduled NLT 14 calendar days after request is received.
     2.5.3.2. Individuals with suspended or revoked driving privileges may request limited
     privileges only in unique and extenuating circumstances, which impact mission
     accomplishment or when the suspension/revocation would cause unusual personal or
     family hardship. Limited privileges will not be granted for personal convenience, i.e., to
     shop at the Commissary or the Main Exchange or for routine appointments. Personnel
     requesting limited driving privileges will submit a memorandum outlining the reason for
     the request and will forward the memorandum to their commander for endorsement.
     Requests must be submitted to the 22 SFS/S5R, who in-turn sends the request and entire
     revocation package to the 22 MSG/CC or 22 MSG/CD for approval/determination. The
     approval authority may deny, grant, or partially grant the request. The approval authority
     will respond to the request in writing, outlining the reason for denial or conditions of
     approval. The requestor should respond to the 22 SFS/S5R and acknowledge receipt for
     the finding within three duty days.
     2.5.3.3. Individuals involved in Driving While Impaired (DWI) incidents whose civilian
     driver’s license is not suspended, may request limited driving privileges or probation
     pending adjudication or administrative action. The written request will be forwarded
     through their chain of command to 22 SFS/S-5R. The written request will then be
     forwarded to 22 MSG/CC or 22 MSG/CD for final approval. The request must include
     compelling reasons where there is an extreme hardship and no other workable alternative.
     The request must also cite at least one of the issues outlined in AFI 31-218(I) 2-6.c.(9).

   4.1.8. Off-Installation Traffic Activities. Title 18 USC, Section 1385 (“Posse Comitatus”
   Act), Title 10 USC, Section 375 and DoD Directive 5525.5 strictly limit the use of Federal
   resources (including personnel and equipment) to enforce State and municipal law. Active
   duty military members and AF civilian employees engaged in law enforcement duties on
   McConnell AFB will not execute law enforcement duties (including traffic control and/or
   management) outside the legal jurisdiction of MAFB without specific approval of 22
   ARW/SJA and authorization of the Installation Commander.
       4.1.8.1. Personnel engaged in Integrated Defense duties may execute those duties outside
       the tactical perimeter and/or legal jurisdiction of MAFB as directed by the Installation
       Commander. These security actions must be limited to the roadways and property
       immediately adjacent or connected to the installation perimeter fencing or other
       designated items/areas of interest as identified by the Defense Force Commander.
       4.1.8.2. Any person in the performance of security/resource protection duties may

       reason to believe any risk is present, regardless of any other criminal activity or concern
       which may arise.
       4.1.8.4. Security Forces will immediately report any suspected criminal activities
       encountered while performing duties to the appropriate civil law enforcement agency for
       action and may provide statements to assist with their investigation.
4.2. Classification of Vehicle Accidents. Traffic accidents fall into two categories-Major and
Minor.
   4.2.1. Major accidents involve any fatality, incapacitating personal injury (requiring medical
   attention at a treatment facility):
       4.2.1.1. Government-owned vehicle or property damage in excess of $500.
       4.2.1.2. Privately-owned vehicle which renders it inoperable after simple on-scene repair
       or adjustment (such as pulling a bumper cover away from a tire or changing a flat for a
       proper spare), and/or deployment of airbag restraint systems.
   4.2.2. Minor privately owned vehicle accidents involve minor functional or cosmetic
   damage to privately-owned vehicles or property which does not interfere with the safe
   operation of the vehicle or cause injury requiring medical attention beyond simple first aid to
   any person.
       4.2.2.1. Reporting Accidents. In addition to the requirements of KSA 8-1602 through
       8-1608, the driver or owner of any vehicle involved in any accident as defined in
MCCONNELLAFBI31-116 25 MARCH 2014                                                            15


      paragraph 5.1.1 on the installation shall immediately, by the quickest means of
      communication available, give notice of such accident to the BDOC. The operator of any
      Government vehicle involved in any accident off the installation must immediately notify
      the local civilian law enforcement agency having jurisdiction, as well as law enforcement
      personnel of the nearest military installation.
      4.2.2.2. Minor accidents as defined in paragraph 5.1.2 occurring on the installation, when
      all vehicles can be safely and normally driven from the scene, must be reported within 24
      hours to the BDOC, unless accidents that do not involve alcohol or drugs. Drivers
      involved in such accidents shall proceed to the BDOC to accomplish AF Form 1315 with
      the on-duty SF flight.
      4.2.2.3. Information in the written report cannot be used in criminal proceedings against
      the person submitting it unless the accident was originally categorized a hit and run and
      the violator is the person submitting the report.
   4.2.3. Any accident involving any GOV will be reported to BDOC and the responsible unit
   Vehicle Control Officer immediately. Accidents involving GOVs meeting the criteria of
   paragraph 5.1.1 will be investigated.
   4.2.4. Active Duty military members involved in POV traffic accidents outside the
   installation causing injury to the member or other damage to Government property will
   immediately notify the BDOC and their unit First Sergeant.
      4.2.4.1. Security Forces BDOC will act as the focal point for gathering information for
      accidents occurring within the metropolitan areas surrounding MAFB and affecting
      active military personnel or GOVs. When possible, 22 SFS/S-5R will obtain copies of
      accident reports prepared by investigating civilian police agencies to accompany off-base
      accident reporting information. When BDOC receives notification of an accident outside
      the installation affecting injury or damage to an active military member or government
      property, the Controller will:
          4.2.4.2.1. Notify the affected member’s chain of command;
          4.2.4.2.2. Notify 22 ARW/CP who will up-channel the information to the concerned
          Group Commander (or higher), 22 ARW/SEG and 22 ARW/PA, as appropriate and;
          4.2.4.2.3. Record all information in the Security Forces blotter along with the
          associated case number from the investigating police agency.
4.3. Traffic Accident Investigation and Reports.
   4.3.1. Security Forces respond to all on-base major vehicle accidents to render first aid,
   arrange for medical assistance, protect personal property, normalize traffic, identify
   victims/witnesses and conduct a formal investigation.
   4.3.2. Accidents which qualify under paragraph 5.1.1 ONLY because a GOV or Government
   property are involved and no other factors are present (no injury or disabling damage) will
   not require a trained major accident investigator. On-duty Security Forces flight will
   investigate using the AF Form 1315, Accident Report and documenting section VII of the
   Standard Form 91. BDOC will contact 22 ARW/PA for official photos.
16                                            MCCONNELLAFBI31-116 25 MARCH 2014


  4.3.3. All other accidents which qualify under paragraph 5.1.1 will be investigated on-scene
  by a trained major traffic accident investigator when available using the AF Form 1315.
  4.3.4. Accidents meeting criteria of paragraph 5.1.2 will be investigated by on-duty SF
  patrolmen when such accidents are witnessed by law enforcement or reported to BDOC. The
  primary goal of these investigations is to collect statistical data for 22 SFS/S-5R and ensure
  the orderly exchange of insurance and contact information between affected persons. Use
  AF Form 1315.
  4.3.5. Record all accident information in the Security Forces blotter. This information will
  include the accident type, time and date, location, name(s) of vehicle operator(s), unit (or
  address when civilian not affiliated with military), vehicle description and license plate
  number(s) and any traffic citations issued.
  4.3.6. Traffic accident investigations conducted by Security Forces and/or AFOSI will take
  precedence over any other types of investigations relating to the accident (Example: Any
  safety related investigation and/or any other investigation that may hamper accident
  investigation practices by Security Forces and/or AFOSI). This precludes the loss of any
  potential evidence that may later have to be introduced in any criminal/judicial proceedings.
  4.3.7. Citations will only be issued when a violation leading to or causing an accident is
  witnessed by a law enforcement officer, upon reliable testimony of a credible law
  enforcement officer who witnessed said violation, or upon results of an investigation
  (Example: Speed was a factor).
  4.3.8. Hit and Run/Fleeing the Scene of an Accident. All vehicle operators have a duty and
  responsibility to stop, render aid and provide appropriate exchange of information when
  involved in a traffic accident or causing damage to another motor vehicle. Law enforcement
  officers responding to accidents where a vehicle operator has left the scene will investigate
  the accident as follows:
     4.3.8.1. Major accidents or GOVs: Complete all actions in paragraphs 5.3.1-5.3.3 as
     required and complete AF Form 3545, Incident Report citing “Title 18 USC, Ch. 13
     assimilating KSA 8-1602-1605 (select which is appropriate for the circumstances)” in the
     offense block. The cited law or statute may change when a subject is identified based on
     that persons military affiliation and duty status.
     4.3.8.2. Minor functional or cosmetic damage to privately-owned vehicles: Afford the
     victim and any witnesses opportunities to accomplish written statements via AF Form
     1168, Statement of Suspect/Witness/Complainant. Capture digital color photos to
     accompany the statements. Issue the victim a DD Form 2701, Initial Information for
     Victims and Witnesses of a Crime along with the appropriate supplemental sheet
     produced by 22 ARW/JA. Record all pertinent information in the Security Forces blotter
     as “Hit and Run” and forward statements and photos to 22 SFS/S-5R for record.
     4.3.8.3. Once a suspect/subject is identified in any hit-and-run case, that person will be
     apprehended under the applicable law or statute based on their military affiliation and
     duty status. Statements and photos completed under paragraph 5.3.6.2 will become part
