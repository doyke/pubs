               NOT ON EXTENDED ACTIVE DUTY (EAD)

Section 1A—General Instructions

1.1. General Instructions. Membership in the ANG or United States Air Force Reserve
(USAFR) is not an individual's inherent right. Membership is a privilege that confers an
obligation to serve in the active military service during mobilization or emergency, or at such
time as national security may require. Members not qualified or not able to properly fulfill their
obligation to serve may be separated or discharged from the ANG or USAFR. Individuals
discharged for any reason outlined in this instruction cease to be members of the ANG or
USAFR. Upon discharge, except for immediate reenlistment, members will be notified of the
purpose and authority of the Discharge Review Board. The member's failure to receive or to
understand this information does not invalidate member's discharge or the characterization of
service received.
1.2. Applicability and Scope. This instruction applies to all officer and enlisted members not
serving on EAD or active duty with the Regular Air Force. Chapter 5 applies to the Retired
Reserve not receiving retired pay. It does not apply to personnel who receive a military
retirement under Title 10 U.S.C., Section 12731, 8911, 8914, or members entitled by law to
disability retired pay based on military status. Recalled retired members (who are not receiving
pay) are subject to this instruction if they are removed from retired status and returned to an
active status.
   1.2.1. Former Members. Previous policy allowed Air Force Reserve members who chose
   discharge instead of transfer to the Retired Reserve to be reappointed or reenlisted for the
   purpose of transfer to the Retired Reserve anytime prior to age 60. These members became
   eligible for partial use of some benefits prior to age 60, and upon attainment of age 60, they
   were eligible for full benefits whether they were reaffiliated or not. This criterion has
   changed. Members who are discharged today, instead of retired, will not be allowed to
   reaffiliate and will only be entitled to retired pay and medical care at age 60. These former
   members and their eligible family members will be issued the DD Form 1173, Uniform
   Service Identification and Privilege Card, on the member's 60th birthday. All members
   who are eligible for transfer to the Retired Reserve and choose discharge must be formally
   counseled concerning this policy and its effects on their benefits.
1.3. Explanation of References, Abbreviations, Acronyms, and Terms. The terms in AFM
11-1, Air Force Glossary of Standardized Terms, AFI 36-2115, Assignments Within the Reserve
Components, and Attachment 1 of this instruction apply throughout this instruction unless the
text indicates otherwise. (When in conflict, Attachment 1 takes precedence.) The acronym for
the Air Force Personnel Center is AFPC. The Air Force Personnel Council is referred to as the
Secretary of the Air Force (SAF) or as the Air Force Personnel Council (no acronym).
AFI36-3209 14 APRIL 2005                                                                       11


1.4. Authority for Discharge. Refer to Table 2.1 and Table 3.1 for separation or discharge
authority. The SAF or designated representative may authorize or approve waivers of, or
exceptions to, this instruction. Neither members nor unit commanders may use this provision to
appeal decisions made under this instruction.
   1.4.1. (ANG Only) The authority to separate ANG assigned members from state status rest
   with the State Adjutant General. Discharge authority for Air Force enlistments or
   appointments rests with SAF, and are delegated, in certain circumstances, to the State
   Adjutant General for members of the ANG. The Adjutant General (TAG) may further
   delegate the authority to separate enlisted members from the Reserve of the Air Force with
   an entry level separation or an Honorable or Under Honorable Conditions (General)
   discharge to a commander in the federally recognized grade of Colonel or above, but not
   lower than a group commander.
   1.4.2. HQ Air Reserve Personnel Center (ARPC)/Separations Branch (DPAD) sends a copy
   of the discharge orders for chaplains or chaplain candidates to Headquarters, United States
   Air Force, Chief of Chaplains (HQ USAF/HC), Bolling AFB DC 20332.
   1.4.3. HQ ARPC/DPAD sends a copy of discharge orders for medical service officers to the
   Medical Service Officer Management Division, AFPC/DPAM, Randolph AFB TX 78150-
   6001.
   1.4.4. Issuing Discharge Certificates:
       1.4.4.1. The ANG issues the NGB 438, Honorable Discharge from the Armed Forces
       of the United States of America-Air National Guard; NGB 438a, Honorable
       Discharge from the Federally Recognized Air National Guard of the United States
       of America; or the NGB 439, General Discharge Under Honorable Conditions from
       the Armed Forces of the United States of America-Air National Guard; 439a,
       General Discharge from the Federally Recognized Air National Guard of the United
       States of America, according to these instructions to those Air Force individuals who are
       enlisted or appointed into the ANG and are subsequently discharged from the ANG and
       as a reserve of the Air Force because of no further military obligation.
       1.4.4.2. ARPC issues the DD Form 256, Honorable Discharge from the Armed Forces
       of the United States of America-United States Air Force, for those individuals who are
       in reserve status at the time of discharge. This includes individuals who were in the ANG
       and transferred back to the Reserves.
1.5. Authority for Discharges and Notice of Discharge.
   1.5.1. Issue orders according to AFI 37-128, Administrative Orders (PA), to effect separation
   or discharge, entry-level separation, or release from the custody and control of the Air Force.
   List this AFI as the authority for separation or discharge.
   1.5.2. Orders directing separation or discharge become effective at 2400 on the date
   specified if the member receives actual or constructive notice on or before the effective date
   specified in the orders. If a member intentionally avoids receipt of the notice or if the
   delivery cannot be made through normal postal channels, the effective date specified in the
   orders will be considered to be the date official notification was received. A member
   continues to be a member until the discharge becomes effective.
 12                                                                 AFI36-3209 14 APRIL 2005


   1.5.3. Members discharged under this instruction receive Honorable, General, or Under
   Other Than Honorable Conditions (UOTHC) discharges. AFI 36-3202, Separations
   Documents, and ANGI 36-3201, Separations Documents, explain how to prepare discharge
   certificates.. Members receiving an entry-level separation, release from the custody and
   control of the Air Force, or dropped from the rolls of the Air Force, receive no discharge
   certificate, and their orders will not characterize their service.
   1.5.4. Send the member copies of the order, other separation documents according to AFI
   36-3202, information on the purpose and authority of the Discharge Review Board and the
   Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records (AFBCMR), unless provided earlier in
   the separation process. If applicable, send a copy of the report of any administrative
   discharge board proceedings involved.
1.6. Disposition of Cases Pending. Process cases to completion according to the directives in
effect at the time the processing starts. Apply this rule to the implementation of this instruction
and subsequent changes to it. For voluntary discharges, processing starts on the date the
appropriate office receives an application for discharge from an enlisted member or a tender of
resignation (TOR) from an officer. For involuntary discharges involving an officer or an enlisted
member, the processing starts on the date that the member acknowledges the receipt of the letter
of notification. Discharge processing also starts 7-calendar days after the Letter of Notification
is mailed to the current address listed with the member's unit or in the personnel data system
(PDS) for those members who fail or decline to respond within 15-calendar days (30 days, if the
commander or discharge authority knows the member is in civilian confinement).
1.7. Disposition of Correspondence . Keep approved separation case files permanently in the
member's Master Personnel Record (MPerR) (according to AFI 36-2608, Military Personnel
Records System, and AFM 37-139, Records Disposition Schedule. Return a disapproved
application for voluntary separation to the member with an explanation for its disapproval.
Return a disapproved recommendation for involuntary separation to the unit commander.
1.8. Guidelines for Separation and Service Characterization. Attachment 2 provides
guidance for determining the type of separation and service characterization warranted.
1.9. Type of Separation and Their Effects on the Individual and Their Benefits.
   1.9.1. Discharges with service characterization of Honorable or Under Honorable Conditions
   (General) are usually treated the same concerning benefits administered by the Veterans
   Administration or other Federal and state agencies. As a rule, either discharge entitles the
   veteran to full rights and benefits.
   1.9.2. Discharge UOTHC may deprive a veteran of benefits based on military service. The
   agency that administers the benefits makes a determination in each case.
   1.9.3. Concerning Air Force administrative matters, such as an enlistment not covered by
   this instruction and requiring a prior service characterization as Honorable or General, an
   entry level separation will be treated as the required characterization. This provision does
   not apply to administrative matters that expressly require different treatment of an entry level
   separation.
AFI36-3209 14 APRIL 2005                                                                        13


1.10. Access to Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI). AFI 31-501, Personnel
Security Program Management, requires special processing in cases involving members who
have, or once had, access to SCI or other special access programs established under DoD
Regulation 5200.1-R/AFI 31-401, Managing the Information Security Program. Persons
debriefed from SCI access for less than 1 year are included in this requirement. Commanders
should comply with AFI 31-501 procedures applicable to a member considered for discharge
before initiating action under this instruction.
1.11. Reports Requiring Special Handling.
   1.11.1. Handle reports furnished through Air Force Office of Special Investigation (AFOSI)
   channels according to instructions in AFI 71-101, Criminal Investigations,
   Counterintelligence, and Protective Service Matters.

   information that may become part of discharge proceedings.
   1.11.5. Handle reports furnished through the Inspector General (IG) channels according to
   the instructions in AFI 90-301, Inspector General Complaints.
1.12. Aliens Seeking Naturalization. Before accepting an alien member's application for
voluntary discharge, unit commanders must ensure that aliens who want to qualify for
naturalization, based on their military service, are counseled on the requirements of AFP 211-28,
Naturalization and Citizenship, including the need to serve at least 3 years. For more
information, see AFP 211-28.
1.13. Retention To Qualify for Retired Pay. In accordance with (IAW) Title 10 U.S.C.,
Sections 12646 (officer) and 1176(b) (enlisted), a Reserve member in an active status who is
selected for involuntary discharge (other than physical disability; for cause; or, for commissioned
officers, for age), or whose term of enlistment expires and is denied reenlistment (other than for
physical disability or for cause), and who is credited with at least 18, but less than 20, years of
service under Section 12732 on the date otherwise prescribed for his discharge or transfer from
an active status, may not be discharged or transferred from an active status without his or her
consent before the earlier of the following dates:

   from an active status.
 14                                                                   AFI36-3209 14 APRIL 2005


1.14. Entrance or Service in an Armed Force of a Foreign Country. Nationals of the United
States (US) (by birth or naturalization) may lose their nationality by entering or serving in the
armed forces of a foreign country without specific written authorization from the Secretary of
State and the Secretary of Defense, Title 10 U.S.C., Section 1060, Military Service of Retired
Members with newly Democratic Nations: Consent of Congress, and AFI 36-2913, Request for
Approval of Foreign Government Employment of Air Force Members. Loss of nationality is a
reason for discharge under paragraphs 2.19 or 3.13.9.

   requests through channels.
       1.14.1.1. The commander advises the officer in writing of the provisions of the Title 8
       U.S.C., Section 1481, Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, concerning possible loss
       of nationality. The officer must acknowledge receipt of the advice before the request is
       processed further.
       1.14.1.2. When the officer still wants to apply for written authorization, the commander
       submits through command channels the application directly to Chief, Foreign Operations,
       Passport Office, Department of State, Washington DC 20524, with a brief summary of
       the officer's service attached.
       1.14.1.3. The Department of State coordinates their actions with DoD.
   1.14.2. A commander who receives information concerning an officer who enters or serves
   in the armed forces of a foreign country, without written authorization, refers the
   information, through command channels for review and determination of appropriate action.
1.15. (DELETED).
1.16. Drug Abuse. Drug abuse is incompatible with military service and members who abuse
drugs one or more times are subject to discharge for misconduct.
   1.16.1. Drug abuse, for purposes of this instruction, is the illegal, wrongful, improper use,
   possession, sale, or transfer, of any drug. This also includes the introduction of an illegal
   drug on to a military installation. This includes improper use of prescription medication.
   The term drug includes any controlled substance in schedules I, II, III, IV, and V of 21
   U.S.C., Section 812. It also includes anabolic or androgenic steroids, and any intoxicating
   substance, other than alcohol, that is inhaled, injected, consumed, or introduced into the body
   in any manner for purposes of altering mood or function.
   1.16.2. The presence in the military environment of persons who engage in drug abuse
   seriously impairs accomplishing the military mission. Members who abuse drugs adversely
   affect the ability of the Air Force to:
       1.16.2.1. Maintain discipline, good order, and morale.
       1.16.2.2. Foster mutual trust and confidence among members.
       1.16.2.3. Facilitate assignments and worldwide deployment.
       1.16.2.4. Recruit and retain members.
       1.16.2.5. Maintain public acceptability of military service.
       1.16.2.6. Prevent breaches of security,

   1.16.3. Evidence obtained through urinalysis or evidence furnished by the member in
   connection with initial entry in rehabilitation and treatment may be used to establish a basis
   for discharge.
   1.16.4. Evidence obtained through commander directed urinalysis may be used to establish a
   basis for discharge, but may not be used on the issue of characterization.
1.17. Physical Disqualification. The traditional discharge board proceedings are not used when
processing physical disqualification cases. Refer to Chapter 4, paragraph 4.14.3.5 for further
processing procedures.

Section 1B—Initiating Separation or Discharge Actions

1.18. Recoupment of Educational Assistance, Special Pay, or Bonuses. The Air Force
normally requires recoupment of all or a portion of advanced education assistance, special pay,
or bonuses received when a member fails to complete the educational requirements or separates
before completing the period of active duty or reserve service the member agreed to serve. The
authority for recoupment is 10 U.S.C. 2005 for advanced educational assistance, various sections
of Title 37 U.S. C., for special pay and bonuses, and the contract or agreement the member
signed.
   1.18.1. Advanced educational assistance includes such programs as:
       1.18.1.1. Service academy.
       1.18.1.2. Armed Forces Health Profession Scholarship Program.
       1.18.1.3. Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences.
       1.18.1.4. ROTC college scholarship program.
       1.18.1.5. Tuition assistance.
       1.18.1.6. Minuteman education program.
       1.18.1.7. Air Force Institute of Technology.
       1.18.1.8. It does not include technical training, workshops, and short-term training
       programs.
   1.18.2. The recoupment in all cases of advanced educational assistance and in most cases of
   special pay or bonuses will be an amount that bears the same ratio to the total amount or cost
   provided the member as the unserved portion of active duty or reserve service bears to the
   total period of active duty or reserve service the member agreed to serve. In some cases of
   special pay or bonuses, the entire amount of special pay or bonus may be recouped.
   1.18.3. Basis for Recoupment. In most cases, recoupment may be effected if the officer
   separates voluntarily or is separated involuntarily for misconduct. Some statutes permit or
   require recoupment without regard to the reason for separation. Advanced educational
   assistance may also be recouped if the member fails to comply with any other term or
   condition of the agreement (for example, failure to commence a period of active service due
   to physical disqualification). For officers, an approved resignation is a voluntary separation.
 16                                                              AFI36-3209 14 APRIL 2005


   1.18.4. Dispute of Advanced Educational Assistance Debt. When a member who is subject
   to recoupment of advanced educational assistance disputes that debt, the discharge authority
   will appoint an officer or civilian employee to investigate the facts of the case in order to
   determine the validity of the debt. If the member’s separation case is heard by a discharge
   board, the board will conduct this inquiry. The investigating officer or board will provide
   findings and recommendations to the discharge authority, who will forward the report of
   inquiry of his or her recommendations to SAF for decision. If the basis for recoupment is
   misconduct, the investigating officer or board must provide an assessment as to whether the
   behavior that resulted in the member’s separation qualifies as misconduct under Title 10
   U.S.C., Section 2005(a)(3).
   1.18.5. (DELETED)
       1.18.5.1. (DELETED)
       1.18.5.2. (DELETED)
       1.18.5.3. (DELETED)
1.19. Member Identified as Missing.
   1.19.1. A member who is officially classified as missing, is handled initially as a casualty
   issue in lieu of discharge action. AFI 36-3002, Casualty Services, outlines the procedures to
   be followed in processing cases classified as missing. AFI 36-2115 explains how to reassign
   them to ARPC.
   1.19.2. If the members Expiration Term of Service/Expiration Term Obligation (ETS/ETO)
   expires prior to a death determination, the member should be discharged unless some other
   directive requires retention.
   1.19.3. Once the SAF, local coroner’s office, or a state court has officially declared the
   missing member as deceased, treat the case as any other casualty as outlined in AFI 36-3002
   and publish a death IAW paragraph 1.23.
1.20. Cases Involving Mandatory Separation or Discharge. In cases involving mandatory
separation or discharge where notification procedures and an administrative discharge board are
not required (such as ETS for enlisted personnel or Mandatory Separation Dates (MSDs) for
officers), the separation or discharge authority will publish orders and issue separation
documents IAW 1.5.
1.21. Involuntary Separation or Discharge. In cases involving separation or discharge where
notification procedures or an administrative discharge board are required, use the following
procedures.
1.22. Unit Commander's (or Equivalent) Responsibilities. The unit commander will:
   1.22.1. Examine and evaluate any information received that indicates a member should be
   considered for separation or discharge. The case must include evidence of notification IAW
   Chapter 4 of this AFI. For Individual Mobilization Augmentees (IMAs), the case must
   include evidence of notification according to AFI 36-2115.
   1.22.2. Consult with HQ ARPC, Director of Personnel Programs Management (DP), HQ
   AFRC, Director of Personnel (DP), or for ANG members, your state headquarters, as
   appropriate.
AFI36-3209 14 APRIL 2005                                                                       17


   1.22.3. Bear in mind that you should usually take action under the first of these categories if
   a situation warrants discharge under both:
       1.22.3.1. Misconduct or moral or professional dereliction.
       1.22.3.2. Substandard performance of duty.
   1.22.4. Consider personnel for discharge under multiple categories at the same time;
   although you must give separate findings for each reason for discharge.
   1.22.5. Prepare a recommendation in the format prescribed in Attachment 3 (Officer) or 6
   (Enlisted).
   1.22.6. Ensure that investigations properly and completely develop, substantiate, and
   document all facts.
   1.22.7. (DELETED)
1.23. Discharge Authority's Responsibilities.
   1.23.1. Review the case ensuring it properly substantiates all facts and determine appropriate
   action warranted.
   1.23.2. If discharge action is not warranted, notify the member and close the case.
   1.23.3. When involuntary administrative discharge action is warranted, refer to Chapter 4.
       1.23.3.1. When an officer tenders a resignation in lieu of board action, suspend
       processing and refer to Chapter 2, Section 2E.
       1.23.3.2. When member applies for retirement and the retirement is accepted, notify the
       member and close the case.
1.24. Death. Regardless of duty status at the time of death, the discharge authority will publish
a special order announcing the death of the member.
1.25. Board of Officers . AFI 51-602, Board of Officers, may be used by ANG, AFRC, or
ARPC.
 18                                                                 AFI36-3209 14 APRIL 2005

    to HQ ARPC only.
 26                                                                AFI36-3209 14 APRIL 2005


   3. Officer cases, where the discharge authority recommends discharge, are reviewed by
   USAF/JAG and sent to the Air Force Personnel Council when column H indicates yes, which
   directs the appropriate commander to take discharge action.
   4. ARPC ONLY. Cases are forwarded to the Air Force Personnel Council when recoupment
   of Advanced Education Assistance (Title 10 U.S.C., Sections 2005) funds are involved.
2.2. Discharge Under Section 2B and Section 2C.
   2.2.1. The following cases require referral to Headquarters AFPC, Retirements and
   Separation Branch, HQ AFPC/DPPRS, for determination of utility of officer in the line of the
   Air Force or other career fields:
      2.2.1.1. Officers who have incurred an active duty service commitment through the
      Health Professions Scholarship Program (HPSP), Berry Plan, Educational Delay
      Program, or other Air Force sponsored medical education or training programs (except
      cases previously reviewed and approved by the Surgeon General or Surgeon General
      designee).
      2.2.1.2. Discharge for the reasons outlined in paragraph 2.21 if the officer has an
      unfulfilled service obligation or contractual obligation.

Section 2B—Termination or Vacation of Appointment

2.3. General Instructions. This section sets out the conditions that may exist or arise
authorizing the termination or vacation of an officer's appointment without administrative
discharge board action. Use this section only when a member fails to obtain a conditional
release IAW the procedures outlined in Section 2F of this chapter.
   2.3.1. Incompatible Status. An officer's appointment may be terminated when the officer is
   enlisted in or accepts an appointment as a commissioned officer in another armed force or
   uniformed service (including the Public Health Service) or the regular Air Force, reappointed
   in a different reserve commissioned grade, or appointed in a different reserve component
   which automatically vacates any appointment previously held as a reserve commissioned
   officer of the Air Force.
   2.3.2. An officer who applies for enlistment or appointment in another service doesn't
   jeopardize current status provided the officer obtained a conditional release from status as a
   Reserve officer of the Air Force.
   2.3.3. Note that this section does not apply to retired officers or to officers under orders to
   report for EAD or active duty for training (ADT).
   2.3.4. Announce the termination of the member's appointment when written evidence is
   received from the gaining service of the date the member enlisted or accepted appointment in
   that other service.
      2.3.4.1. Send the officer notification of this action.
      2.3.4.2. Notify the gaining service if the member has an unfulfilled service obligation.
      2.3.4.3. Note that the discharge is effective 1 day prior to the enlistment or appointment.
AFI36-3209 14 APRIL 2005                                                                    27


   2.3.5. Automatic termination of appointment. The death of an officer will be reported as
   prescribed in AFI 36-3002. Death is announced IAW AFI 37-128.

Section 2C—Involuntary Discharge

2.4. General Instructions. Officers may be involuntarily separated or discharged for the
reasons stated in this section. Commanders may also use similar reasons when other conditions
exist or arise that warrant consideration for ending an officer's military status.
2.5. Initiation of Action . Refer to Section 2B, Section 2C, and Section 2D, for preprocessing
considerations.
   2.5.1. Each paragraph authorizing separation or discharge tells what is required to show a
   basis for separation or discharge.
   2.5.2. Unit assigned member. Except in cases based on physical disqualification, paragraph
   2.16, the unit commander initiates separation action by preparing a letter recommending
   separation (Attachment 3) and forwards it to the convening authority (for ANG), or through
   the wing commander to HQ AFRC/DPML (for AFRC) together with supporting documents
   and a review for legal sufficiency prepared by the local staff judge advocate. The convening
   authority for ANG or for AFRC will:
       2.5.2.1. Return all cases which do not support action under this chapter.
       2.5.2.2. If separation or discharge processing is appropriate, process according to this
       chapter and Chapter 4. For cases based on physical disqualification, Director of Medical
       Services, ANGRC/SG, or HQ AFRC/DPML will initiate involuntary separation or
       discharge action without a commander's report and notify the respondent's unit
       commander of the separation or discharge action.
   2.5.3. Members not assigned to units. When unit commanders receive information
   indicating that a member under their jurisdiction should be considered for separation or
   discharge, they will forward the information through channels with all supporting documents
   to HQ ARPC/DPAD. NOTE: For IMAs, the case must include evidence of notification
   according to AFI 36-2115. HQ ARPC/DPAD will:
       2.5.3.1. Return cases which do not support action under this chapter.
       2.5.3.2. If not currently assigned to HQ ARPC, request reassignment action IAW AFI
       36-2115.
       2.5.3.3. If separation processing is appropriate, process according to this chapter and
       Chapter 4.
2.6. Probationary Officer. (Does not apply to ANG.) Initiate separation or discharge action
against a probationary officer IAW Chapter 4. NOTE: The separation or discharge requires a
board hearing only if the convening or discharge authority recommends an UOTHC discharge.

Section 2D—Discharge of Officers for Misconduct, Moral or Professional Dereliction,
Substandard Performance of Duty, or in the Interest of National Security
2.7. Discharge for Age.
    2.7.1. Discharge. For officers who are ineligible for transfer to the Retired Reserve or who
    are eligible, but fail to apply, unless waived by the SAF, discharge them as of the last day of
    the month in which they reach the age for the appropriate grade as indicated below. This
    includes those officers recalled or retired in an active status after transfer to the retired
    reserve.
    2.7.2. AFRC Policy. Unless the officer has applied for retirement, normally reassign
    Reserve general officers in the grade of major general to Inactive Status List Reserve Section
    (ISLRS) on the last day of the month in which the officer turns 60 years old.

Table 2.2. Discharge for position, grade and age.

    2.7.3. Retention of Health Professionals and Chaplains. SAF may, with the officer’s
    consent, retain in active status medical and dental officers, air force nurses, chaplains, or
    individuals designated as biomedical sciences officers or medical service corps officers until
    age 67. The officer must initiate the request for retention and forward it through command
    channels to NGB/A1, Directorate of Manpower, Personnel and Services (for ANG officers)
    or HQ AFRC/A1 (for USAFR Officers). The request must be submitted at least 6 months
    before the date established in this instruction for the discharge of the officer. It must include
    a full justification from the officer’s commander that clearly supports the request and
    includes the following information and/or statements:
         2.7.3.1. Retention is clearly in the best interest of the Air Force (or the ANG).
         2.7.3.2. No acceptable replacement is available (proper experience and grade,
         geographical location, or demonstrated ability).
         2.7.3.3. Steps taken to recruit replacements and action underway to meet future manning
         requirements.
         2.7.3.4. Current and projected unit authorized or assigned manning corps, air Force
         specialty code (AFSC), and grade. (ANG State HQs endorsement must include the same
         information for the entire state.)
AFI36-3209 14 APRIL 2005                                                                            29


   2.7.4. Selective Service Age Waivers. The Director of Selective Service may approve age
   waivers to age 60 for commissioned officers in active status while assigned to the selective
   service as US property and fiscal officers.
2.8. General Officers Who Cease To Occupy General Officer Positions. General officers
who cease to occupy a position commensurate with that or a higher grade will, within 30 days
thereafter, be discharged provided the officer is:
   2.8.1. Not assigned to fill a comparable position of the same or higher grade.
   2.8.2. Ineligible for transfer to the Retired Reserve, or is eligible, but fails to apply.
   2.8.3. Ineligible for transfer to the ISLRS, or is eligible, but fails to elect such transfer.
   2.8.4. An officer in this category upon application, if qualified, will be appointed in the
   Reserve grade held as a Reserve officer before appointment in a general officer grade, and
   will be credited with an amount of service in the grade in which appointed that is equal to the
   amount of prior service in an active status in that grade and in any higher grade.
   2.8.5. Officers Federally recognized solely because of their appointment as Adjutant General
   or Assistant Adjutant General, if qualified and upon application, will be appointed in the
   grade held as a Reserve officer prior to appointment as Adjutant General or Assistant
   Adjutant General and will be credited with the amount of service in the grade in which
   appointed that is equal to the amount of prior service in an active status of that grade, and in
   any higher grade.
2.9. Second Lieutenants Not Qualified for Promotion (NQP). When the preponderance of
the evidence shows an officer is not qualified to perform the duties of the higher grade, the
commander recommends in writing to SAF to find the member NQP. The commander informs
the member of the NQP recommendation in writing or orally, before the promotion effective
date. Oral notification is sufficient to automatically delay promotion, but must be followed by
written notification as soon as practicable. The commander may authorize members a period of
time to overcome the basis for the NQP, by improving their performance before separation
action is initiated. Once discharge is recommended, SAF may discharge the officer with less
than 5 years commissioned service in an active status or any time after being found NQP. If not
discharged sooner, they shall be discharged at the end of the 18-month period beginning on the
date on which the officer is first found not qualified for promotion. NOTE: An officer of the
Air National Guard of the United States (ANGUS) in the grade of second lieutenant, whose
Federal recognition is withdrawn, because the officer is not appointed in or promoted to the
grade of first lieutenant by the governor or other appropriate authority of a state, territory, or the
District of Columbia or Puerto Rico will be separated and transferred to the USAFR.
2.10. Effect of Failure of Selection for Promotion (Twice Deferred).
   2.10.1. Reserve First Lieutenant. A first lieutenant on the reserve active status list who fail
   to be selected for promotion to the next higher grade for the second time shall be discharged
   if they are not eligible for transfer to the Retired Reserve or are eligible and fail to apply.
   Discharges will be on the first day of the seventh month after the month in which the
   President approves the report of the board which considered the officer for the second time.
   EXCEPTION: The SAF may retain the officer in order to meet planned mobilization needs.
 30                                                                AFI36-3209 14 APRIL 2005


   This may not exceed 24 months from the date the President approves the report of the board
   that considered the officer for the second time.
   2.10.2. Reserve Captain. A captain on the reserve active status list who has failed to be
   selected for promotion to the next higher grade for the second time and who has not been
   selected for continuation, shall be discharged not later than the first day of the seventh month
   after the month in which the President approves the report of the board which considered the
   officer the second time. EXCEPTIONS: An officer who qualifies for either the active duty
   or Reserve sanctuary IAW Title 10 U.S.C., Section 12646, Commissioned officers: retention
   of after completing 18 or more, but less than 20 years of service, Title 10 U.S.C., Section
   12686, Reserves on active duty within 2 years of retirement eligibility limitation on release
   from active duty, may not be released before the member becomes retirement eligible without
   the member’s consent. Also, Title 10 U.S.C., Section 14513, Separation for failure of
   selection of promotion, requires member to be transferred to an inactive status if SAF
   determines the officer has skills which may be required to meet mobilization needs or to be
   transferred to the Retired Reserve, if qualified and applies, or be discharged from the
   officer’s reserve appointment.
   2.10.3. Reserve Major. A major on the reserve active status list who has failed selection for
   promotion to the next higher grade for the second time and whose name is not on a list of
   officers recommended for promotion to the next higher grade shall, if not earlier removed
   from the reserve active status list, be removed from that list if not transferred to the Retired
   Reserve if eligible, or does not apply, and will be discharged on the first day of the month
   after the month in which the officer completes 20 years of commissioned service.
   EXCEPTION: Officer who qualifies for retention due to Title 10 U.S.C., Section 12646,
   Commissioned officers: retention of after completing 18 or more, but less than 20 years of
   service.
2.11. Elimination for Length of Service.
   2.11.1. Each officer in the grade of Lieutenant Colonel through Major General will be
   removed from the Reserve Active Status List (RASL) for length of service IAW Table 2.3.
NOTE:
Not applicable to Adjutant General and Assistant Adjutant General.
   2.11.2. ANG officer employed as a Military Technician (MT) and whose separation is
   required by paragraph 2.11.1 may be retained beyond the MSD. The State Adjutant General
   may approve the retention until the officer qualifies for an immediate, unreduced civil service
   annuity (CSRS or FERS), or age 55, whichever is earlier. A copy of the written approval
   signed by TAG will be sent to ANGRC/MP for colonels and below and NGB-GO/AF for
   general officers. Requests for retention beyond age 55 must be forwarded through NGB-
   GO/AF or ANGRC/MP, as appropriate, to the Chief, NGB for approval. Extensions will
   only be approved until an officer qualifies for an immediate reduced annuity.

NOTE1. If on the recommended list for promotion to the next higher grade, length of service
will be computed at the higher grade based on the Grade Permanent Effective Date in the PDS.
NOTE 2. Each officer in an active status will be discharged the first day of the month after the
month in which the member completes the required commissioned service.
2.12. Selective Early Removal from the RASL. Whenever SAF determines that there are an
excessive number of officers in any grade and competitive category who have at least 30 total
years of service, or at least 20 years of satisfactory Federal service for retired pay, SAF may
convene a selection board to consider all officers on that list who are in that grade and
competitive category, and who have that amount of service, for the purpose of recommending
officers by name for removal from the RASL, in the number specified by SAF by each grade and
competitive category. Unless otherwise directed by SAF, discharge an officer that the board

   service obligation under Title 10 U.S.C., Section 651 and whose participation has not been
   satisfactory may be:
       2.24.1.1. Discharged for unsatisfactory participation when the commander concerned has
       determined that the individual has no potential for useful service under conditions of full
       mobilization. Member may be discharged when the officer has accumulated nine or more
       unexcused absences from unit training assemblies (UTA) within a 12-month period.
       Service characterization will be determined by using the criteria in Attachment 2. See
       AFM 36-8001, Reserve Personnel Participation and Training Procedures for all
       participation requirements.
       2.24.1.2. Palace Chase Obligors, should be handled IAW AFI 36-3205, Applying for the

   the Chief, National Guard Bureau.
   2.25.5. The officer was selected for mandatory promotion by a central selection board when
   no position vacancy existed to the next higher grade and retention was not authorized by AFI

   transferred to HQ ARPC.
   2.25.9. Deactivation of a Unit. If an ANG unit is deactivated and there is no other unit
   within the area to which the member may be assigned and the member does not join a unit
   outside that area, the member will be separated from the ANG and concurrently transferred
   to HQ ARPC (for those with an MSO and those without, who request transfer).

Section 2D—Discharge of Officers for Misconduct, Moral or Professional Dereliction,
Substandard Performance of Duty, Homosexual Conduct, or in the Interest of National
Security

2.26. General Instructions.
   2.26.1. This section establishes criteria for identifying officers who may be discharged for
   misconduct, moral or professional dereliction, substandard performance of duty (including
   failure to meet acceptable military standards). This section also constitutes authority for, and
   tells how to effect the administrative discharge of such officers and for those cases approved
   under AFI 31-501 (in the interest of national security).
   2.26.2. Unit commanders must promptly identify and dispose of the cases of these officers.
      2.26.2.1. Use accurate and impartial evaluations to identify ineffective officers.
      2.26.2.2. In particular, give closest scrutiny to probationary officers during their 5-year
      probationary period to assure that their qualifications and actions justify continued
      service.
      2.26.2.3. Use the policies explained in AFI 51-903, Dissident and Protest Activities, as a
      guide when evaluating the conduct of military personnel who engage in dissident and
      protest activities.
   2.26.3. Do not discharge any officer under Section 2D of this chapter until the Air Force
   Personnel Council announces the decision in the case.
   2.26.4. ANG Officers. ANG officers not on active duty are discharged through the
   withdrawal of Federal recognition process in Title 32 U.S.C., Section 323. Withdrawal of
   Federal recognition pursuant to Title 32 U.S.C., Section 323(b) automatically results in
   discharge from Reserve of the Air Force appointment. Discharge boards convened under this
   instruction for ANG officers are withdrawal of Federal recognition boards. The guidance in
   this section applies to the withdrawal of Federal recognition from ANG officers, except
   paragraph 2.27.2.2 because Title 32 U.S.C., Section 323(b) does not establish a probationary
   officer category.
AFI36-3209 14 APRIL 2005                                                                           37


2.27. Reinitiation of Action. An officer who has been processed for discharge because of
substandard performance of duty under this section, and has been retained, may not again be
processed for discharge for the same reasons within the 1-year period beginning on the date of
the determination to retain. An officer may not again be processed for discharge solely because
of conduct that was the subject of a previous proceeding unless the findings and
recommendations resulted from fraud or collusion.
2.28. Characterization of Service. SAF determines the characterization of service of an officer
whose discharge is approved as a result of action under Section 2D.
2.29. Misconduct or Moral or Professional Dereliction. You may discharge a commissioned
officer who has committed one or more acts of misconduct or moral or professional dereliction.
Such acts include, but are not limited to:
   2.29.1. Failure to meet financial obligations. This behavior includes, but is not limited to:
       2.29.1.1. Issuing worthless checks.
       2.29.1.2. Failure to provide adequate support for family members.
       2.29.1.3. Failure to comply with court orders.
       2.29.1.4. Dishonorable failure to make timely payments on the member’s government
       American Express Travel Card. Dishonor is presumed when the member fails to make
       any payments for a period of 120 or more consecutive days, or the member fails to keep
       any promise for payment specifically made on this type of debt. The member may rebut
       the presumption through the introduction of competent and relevant evidence.
   2.29.2. Mismanagement of government affairs.
   2.29.3. Drug abuse. See paragraph 1.16 for policy and guidance.
       2.29.3.1. Commanders must act promptly when they have information indicating a
       member is subject to discharge for drug abuse. They evaluate the specific circumstances
       of the offense, the member's records, and the member's potential for future service and
       take action IAW paragraphs 2.30.3.2 and 2.30.3.3.
       2.29.3.2. If the commander determines discharge action is warranted, discharge action
       must be initiated promptly. However, there is no time limit for initiating discharge
       action, and failure to do so does not at any time constitute a constructive waiver.
       2.29.3.3. HQ AFRC ONLY. If the commander determines a waiver of discharge is
       appropriate, a request for waiver must be processed promptly. See paragraph 4.3.3 for
       waiver processing procedures.
   2.29.4. Other serious or recurring misconduct that raises doubt regarding fitness for retention
   in the Air Force, regardless of whether such misconduct has resulted in judicial or
   nonjudicial punishment.
   2.29.5. Intentional misrepresentation of facts in obtaining an appointment or in official
   statements or records.
   2.29.6. Civil service appointment as an Air Reserve Technician (ART), MT, or Active
   Guard Reserve (AGR) has been terminated for reasons that warrant possible termination of
   appointment as an officer.
 38                                                                AFI36-3209 14 APRIL 2005


   2.29.7. The officer, while serving as an airman in the Regular Air Force, meets either of
   these criteria for reasons that warrant consideration of termination of appointment as a
   Reserve officer of the Air Force:
       2.29.7.1. Has been discharged from Regular Air Force enlisted status.
       2.29.7.2. Has been demoted.
   2.29.8. Failure or dismissal at any school when attendance is at DoD expense. Apply this
   subparagraph when you can reasonably trace the failure or dismissal to factors the officer can
   control.
   2.29.9. Conduct resulting in a loss of professional status necessary to performance of
   military duties.
       2.29.10.1. Lewd or lascivious acts.
   2.29.10.2. (DELETED)
       2.29.10.3. Indecent acts with or assault on a child.
       2.29.10.4. Transvestitism or other abnormal sexual behavior.
       2.29.10.5. Other indecent acts or offenses.
(DELETED)
   2.29.11. Fear of flying. Professed fear of flying by a rated officer is professional dereliction
   when both of these conditions apply:
       2.29.11.1. An officer who has an aeronautical rating is disqualified for aviation service
       because the officer states, orally or in writing, a fear of flying.
       2.29.11.2. Medical authorities determine that the officer is physically qualified for flying
       duties (see AFI 11-402, Aviation and Parachutist Service, Aeronautical Ratings and
       Badges). You may retain the officer if a compelling reason exists. EXAMPLE: The
       officer has unusual qualifications in a non-flying skill needed in the Air Force and
       retention is clearly in the best interests of the Air Force.
   2.29.12. Behavior clearly not consistent with the interest of national security. This reason
   applies when the case is approved under AFI 31-501 for further processing under this chapter
   and the adjudication authority has denied the required security clearance.
   2.29.13. Intentional failure to perform assigned duties or complete required training.
2.30. (DELETED)
2.31. (DELETED)
2.32. (DELETED)
2.33. (DELETED)
2.34. Substandard Performance of Duty. Discharge an officer who, as compared to other
commissioned officers of the same grade and experience, is found to be substandard in any of the
following respects or similar circumstances.
AFI36-3209 14 APRIL 2005                                                                          39


   2.34.1. Failure to show acceptable qualities of leadership required of an officer of the same
   grade.
   2.34.2. Failure to achieve acceptable standards of proficiency required of an officer of the
   same grade.

   2.34.4. A downward trend in duty performance resulting in an unacceptable record of
   effectiveness.
   2.34.5. A record of marginal service over an extended time as shown by performance reports
   covering different jobs and prepared by at least two different supervisors.
   2.34.6. Apathy or defective attitude during which the officer is unable or unwilling to
   expend effort.
   2.34.7. Character and behavior disorders when such disorders interfere with performance of
   duty. The disorder must be either:
       2.34.7.1. Supported by a report of evaluation by a psychiatrist or a psychologist that
       confirms the diagnosis of one of these disorders:
           2.34.7.1.1. Personality disorders.
           2.34.7.1.2. Conduct disorders.
           2.34.7.1.3. Adjustment disorders.
           2.34.7.1.4. Disorders of impulse control.
           2.34.7.1.5. Psycho-sexual disorders and psycho-sexual dysfunctions.
       2.34.7.2. Any other mental disorder as discussed in the Diagnostic and Statistical
       Manual of Mental Disorder (DSM IV) that interferes with duty performance and is not
       within the purview of a medical disability.
   2.34.8. Failure to conform to prescribed standards of dress, body fat, physical fitness,
   personal appearance, or military deportment. When the failure is deliberate and continues
   over a period of time, action under other provisions may be more appropriate.
   2.34.9. Inability to perform duties or non-availability to meet worldwide military
   commitments as a result of dependent care responsibilities.
   2.34.10. Lack of response to training, in that performance of duties in the officer’s assigned
   specialty is precluded or impaired to the degree of being unsatisfactory.
   2.34.11. Failure to maintain satisfactory progress while in an active status officer student
   program.
2.35. Drug or Alcohol Abuse Rehabilitation Failure. Members who are in an Air Force
program for personal alcohol or drug abuse may be discharged for failure through inability or
refusal to participate in, cooperate in, or successfully complete such a program in the following
circumstances:
   2.35.1. There is a lack of potential for continued military service.
 40                                                                  AFI36-3209 14 APRIL 2005


   2.35.2. Long-term treatment is determined necessary and the member is transferred to or
   receiving treatment in a civilian medical facility.
   2.35.3. Nothing in this provision precludes separation or discharge of a member who has
   been referred to such a program under any other provision of this instruction in appropriate
   cases.
   2.35.4. Advise members before referral to a civilian rehabilitation program, that any incurred
   expenses will be solely their responsibility without obligation to NGB, AFRC, ARPC, or
   ANG.
   2.35.5. If an Administrative Discharge Board is requested, the Board will review the
   evidence, make a finding of either alcohol or drug abuse rehabilitation failure and determine
   the characterization of service, which should either be Honorable or Under Honorable
   Conditions (General). Use the notification procedures of Chapter 4, Section 4C. Nothing in
   this section precludes separation or discharge of a member referred to a treatment program
   under any other section of this directive when appropriate.
   2.35.6. Report alcohol abuse failures separately from drug abuse failures. When separation
   or discharge is considered appropriate due to evidence of alcohol abuse, the unit commander:
       2.35.6.1. Reviews the action taken according to AFI 36-2701, Social Actions Program,
       or ANGR 30-2, Social Actions NGB Program, and ensures that every effort has been
       made to rehabilitate the member.
       2.35.6.2. Recommends whether to separate the member for drug or alcohol abuse failure
       or for another reason (for example, illegal activity in connection with drugs may be a
       basis for discharge for misconduct, deteriorating duty performance associated with
       alcohol abuse may warrant separation or discharge for unsatisfactory performance).
       2.35.6.3. Prepares a letter to the discharge authority to include:
       2.35.6.4. A history of the member's drug or alcohol abuse, including details of how the
       abuse was determined, following guidance of AFI 36-2701 or ANGR 30-2.
       2.35.6.5. A summary of the rehabilitation efforts with a complete explanation of how
       criteria for this basis for separation or discharge are met.
       2.35.6.6. A resume of the military record.
2.36. Conviction by Civil Authorities.
   2.36.1. The Report. A unit commander will prepare and forward a report to the discharge
   authority of an officer who has been convicted and sentenced to prison by civil authorities.
   The commander will complete the report even if the civil authorities suspend the sentence.
   The report must include the following information:
       2.36.1.1. Offense or offenses convicted.
       2.36.1.2. Sentence received.
       2.36.1.3. Date of final sentence.
       2.36.1.4. Place of confinement, if any.
       2.36.1.5. Text of the statute violated and text of the statute that provides the penalty.
AFI36-3209 14 APRIL 2005                                                                   41


     2.36.1.6. Text of the statutes relevant to a determination of whether confinement in a
     county jail can be considered a correctional institution, if applicable.
     2.36.1.7. When possible, a copy of the final judgment or order of the court, certified or
     otherwise properly authenticated, will be included with the commander's report.
  2.36.2. Discharge Authority Action. Upon receipt of the case report from the unit
  commander, the discharge authority determines whether to forward the case to Air Force
  Personnel Council for SAF decision on whether to drop the officer from the rolls of the Air
  Force. If the discharge authority determines to forward the case, the following actions will
  be taken:
     2.36.2.1. Notify the officer of the proposed action.
     2.36.2.2. Allow the officer a reasonable time to submit comments (normally 10-calendar
     days from the officer’s receipt of notice).
     2.36.2.3. Forward the case to Air Force Personnel Council (through HQ USAF/JAG).
     Include the following.
     2.36.2.4. Proof of notice to the officer.
     2.36.2.5. The officer’s comments, if any.
     2.36.2.6. A statement whether discharge action is or has been started.
     2.36.2.7. Any other appropriate comments and recommendations.
  2.36.3. Announces a Decision. The Air Force Personnel Council announces the decision of
  SAF on whether to drop the officer from the rolls.
  2.36.4. Conviction by Foreign Court:
     2.36.4.1. You may not drop officers from the Rolls of the Air Force because they are
     convicted by foreign courts of an offense and sentenced to confinement unless the
     following additional criteria are met:
         2.36.4.1.1. A sufficiently detailed report is received from a major command
         (MAJCOM) responsible for operating in the foreign country involved that describes
         the nature and form of due process the officer received from the foreign court; and
         2.36.4.1.2. The relevant legal office (i.e., HQ AFRC/JA, NGB/JA, or HQ ARPC/JA)
         finds the officer received sufficient procedural safeguards from the foreign legal
         system to warrant continued processing to drop the officer from the rolls of the Air
         Force.
     2.36.4.2. Nothing in this paragraph (2.36) prevents considering the removal or discharge
     of the officer under any other provision (including 2.36.7, Civilian Conviction) of
     Chapter 2 when convicted by a foreign court.
  2.36.5. Reviewing Convictions. Commanders should review convictions that do not result
  in an imposed or suspended final sentence to confinement and other actions short of
  conviction that are tantamount to a finding of guilty.
42                                                                 AFI36-3209 14 APRIL 2005


     2.36.5.1. Action "tantamount to a finding of guilty" may occur where, even though the
     court doesn't issue a specific finding of guilty, it proceeds in a way that is inconsistent
     with any reasonable hypothesis other than assumed guilt. EXAMPLE: Successful
     probation in return for a clean record; deferred adjudication; or some other form of pre-
     trial intervention.
     2.36.5.2. In such cases, the officer's commander:
         2.36.5.2.1. Reviews the facts in the case and the officer's entire record.
         2.36.5.2.2. Determines whether to forward the case for consideration by the
         Secretary to drop the officer from the rolls of the Air Force, involuntarily discharge
         the officer for the civilian conviction, or discharge the officer under some other
         provision of Chapter 2 of this instruction.
  2.36.6. Dropping Officers from the Rolls of the Air Force:
     2.36.6.1. You may drop from the rolls of the Air Force any officer who has been found
     guilty by civil authorities of any offense and confined in a Federal or state penitentiary or
     correctional institution or if convicted by a foreign court and sentenced to confinement, if
     the officer’s case meets the criteria of paragraph 2.36.4.1.
     2.36.6.2. Under the statutes of some states, sentence to confinement in a county jail may
     constitute confinement in a correctional institution.
     2.36.6.3. Dropping an officer from the rolls of the Air Force terminates the officer's
     military status as of 2400 on the date specified in the orders.
     2.36.6.4. The appropriate agency (ANGRC, HQ AFRC, HQ ARPC) publishes orders
     dropping an officer from the rolls of the Air Force. Issue no separation documents.
  2.36.7. Discharge for Civilian Conviction.
     2.36.7.1. Officers may be involuntarily discharged for a civilian conviction when the
     specific circumstances of the offense warrant discharge and a punitive discharge would
     be authorized for the same or a closely related offense under the UCMJ, the authorized
     sentence for the offense convicted includes the possibility of confinement for 6 months or
     more, or the actual sentence received includes confinement for 30 days or more, all
     without regard to suspension or probation.
     2.36.7.2. Appeal of Civilian Conviction. Separation or discharge processing (but not
     action to drop an officer from the rolls of the Air Force) may be initiated whether or not
     an officer has filed an appeal of a civilian conviction, or has stated an intention to do so.
     Withhold execution of an approved discharge pending the outcome of the appeal or until
     the deadline for appeal has passed, but upon request of the officer or upon direction of
     SAF, the officer may be separated prior to final action on the appeal. (As usual in this
     paragraph, “appeal” only refers to individual officer’s right to directly appeal the
     conviction. Collateral appellate attacks on the conviction, such as requests for habeas
     corpus or other writs, are not considered to be appeals for this purpose.)
         2.36.7.2.1. If the appeal results in conviction being set aside, do not discharge the
         member for civilian conviction. If the appropriate authority considers discharge
         warranted without awaiting the outcome of an appeal, forward the case to the Air
AFI36-3209 14 APRIL 2005                                                                     43


         Force Personnel Council, through the General Law Division of HQ USAF (i.e. HQ
         USAF/JAG), for decision of SAF. In each case referred, an analysis of the situation
         should be furnished. The analysis should include:
            2.36.7.2.1.1. A complete review of the circumstances.
            2.36.7.2.1.2. A statement whether it is the conviction or the sentence that is under
            appeal.
            2.36.7.2.1.3. An indication whether or not the appeal is frivolous or unlikely of
            reversal.
            2.36.7.2.1.4. The estimated date action on the appeal will be finalized.
            2.36.7.2.1.5. A considered judgment by those in the best position to assess the
            validity of the appeal.
            2.36.7.2.1.6. Any cogent reasons why the case should be treated in an exceptional
            fashion prior to completion of the appellate process.
         2.36.7.2.2. The respondent officer may request execution of the approved discharge
         while the appeal is pending. Make the request in writing and tell how the discharge
         will benefit the respondent. It must show that it was made with the advice and
         assistance of legal counsel. The discharge authority asks the staff judge advocate to
         comment on the validity of the reasons given to assess the possibility that the
         conviction will be overturned on appeal. Normally, the request is approved if:
            2.36.7.2.2.1. There is an indication the respondent will benefit.
            2.36.7.2.2.2. The conviction is expected to withstand the appeal.
            2.36.7.2.2.3. No other circumstances exist requiring the return to military control
            of a respondent officer who is in civil confinement.
  2.36.8. Waiver of Civilian Conviction. Constructive waiver is not a recognized issue or
  defense against discharge action for civilian conviction taken against officers under this
  instruction. However, the discharge authority or General Court Martial Convening Authority
  (GCMCA) has the authority to grant express waivers of discharge action against officers for
  their civilian convictions. This should only occur on rare occasions. In cases that warrant
  express waiver consideration, the discharge authority or GCMCA shall consider the
  following factors before determining whether to grant a waiver:
     2.36.8.1. The gravity of the specific offense(s) involved
     2.36.8.2. All matters in aggravation, mitigation, and extenuation regarding the offense(s).
     2.36.8.3. The overall circumstances of the offense(s).
     2.36.8.4. The military record of the officer for all service prior to the commission of the
     offense(s).
     2.36.8.5. Any combat or exceptional service by the officer since the offense(s).
     2.36.8.6. The impact on the Air Force community caused by the offense(s).
     2.36.8.7. What disciplinary or other disposition would have been appropriate had the
     offense(s) occurred and been resolved entirely within the Air Force community.
 44                                                                AFI36-3209 14 APRIL 2005

2D.
   2.37.1. Unit Commander's Responsibilities:
       2.37.1.1. Evaluating Information.      Unit commanders examine and evaluate any

Section 2E—Officer Resignations

2.40. General Instructions. The right of an officer to resign is subject to certain restrictions.
This section tells how to process resignations submitted by an officer. It constitutes the authority
for effecting the officer's discharge or separation. A conditional tender is one in which an officer
tries to restrict the different types of service characterizations available under a particular
paragraph by tendering the resignation for a specific type of characterization. Conditional tenders
of resignation are not accepted by the Air Force. Once an officer has been notified of orders or
consideration for EAD, the officer’s application for resignation is referred to AFPC/DPPRS for
disposition.
2.41. Approving or Disapproving Applications.
   2.41.1. An Honorable Discharge is given when an officer properly submits a resignation for
   any of the reasons listed in paragraph 2.46.1 through 2.46.1.8, and meets the criteria listed
   therein, unless:
       2.41.1.1. There are valid reasons for retaining an officer in the military service.
       2.41.1.2. SAF, through the Air Force Personnel Council, determines the resignation is
       not acceptable.
       2.41.1.3. TAG determines when the resignation from state status is or is not acceptable.
   2.41.2. Resignations tendered for reasons in Chapter 2, Section 2C and/or Section 2D will
   be considered on their individual merits including resignations tendered by members who
   have not served on active duty while fulfilling their MSOs because they have been granted
   delays from entry on EAD.
   2.41.3. A resignation may be disapproved for these reasons:
       2.41.3.1. When the officer:
           2.41.3.1.1. Is under investigation.
           2.41.3.1.2. Is under sentence by civil court.
           2.41.3.1.3. Is insane.
           2.41.3.1.4. Is in default with respect to public property or funds.
           2.41.3.1.5. Is under consideration for discharge for cause.
           2.41.3.1.6. Has an unfulfilled, MSO, contract or active duty service commitment.
       2.41.3.2. In time of war, when war is imminent, or in a period of national emergency as
       proclaimed by the President or declared by the Congress.
       2.41.3.3. In any other instance when the best interest of the service requires retention.
2.42. Preparing and Forwarding Resignations.
   2.42.1. Preparation. Prepare a resignation tendered under this section using the letter format
   in Attachment 4. Include required documentation and a concise statement of reasons for
   requesting discharge.
AFI36-3209 14 APRIL 2005                                                                   47


   2.42.2. Forwarding:
       2.42.2.1. Send the resignation to the officer's unit commander. If the officer does not
       have a participating Reserve assignment, send the resignation to HQ ARPC/DPAD.
       2.42.2.2. The unit commander completes the first endorsement (Attachment 5). If
       recommending disapproval, states which of the reasons for disapproval listed in
       paragraph 2.41.3 was used and forwards the resignation to:
          2.42.2.2.1. HQ AFRC/DPML or HQ ARPC/DPAD, as appropriate.
          2.42.2.2.2. ANG State Headquarters (through command channels).
       2.42.2.3. In cases where approval authority is SAF as shown in Table 2.1, the discharge
       authority obtains a legal review and forwards the resignation by endorsement to the Air
       Force Personnel Council, recommending approval or disapproval and stating the reasons
       for the recommendation and includes in the endorsement a recommendation as to the
       characterization of service the officer should receive.
2.43. Withdrawing a Resignation.
   2.43.1. Officers may request that their TOR be withdrawn at any time before it is accepted
   by the approval authority. State the reasons, and send it through the same channels as the
   TOR. Endorsing commanders may comment on the withdrawal.
   2.43.2. Approval:
       2.43.2.1. A commander possessing a resignation tendered for reasons outlined in
       paragraphs 2.46.1 through 2.46.2, who receives a request for withdrawal, may take final
       action to approve the withdrawal and return all correspondence to the officer.
       2.43.2.2. Return any disapproved request for withdrawal with the TOR through the same
       channels.
       2.43.2.3. When a resignation tendered for reasons in paragraph 2.46.1 and 2.46.2 has
       already been approved by the discharge authority, or the Air Force Personnel Council,
       but for which an actual discharge or separation action has not yet been taken, the
       appropriate authority or the Air Force Personnel Council may approve the withdrawal. A
       resignation tendered under paragraph 2.46.3 may be withdrawn only upon approval of the
       Air Force Personnel Council.
2.44. Resubmitting a TOR.
   2.44.1. Resubmit a disapproved TOR only when a material change in circumstances occurs
   and there is evidence to support the request. Resubmission of the TOR does not delay any
   discharge proceeding.
   2.44.2. Forward any resubmission received after findings of an administrative discharge
   board with the board’s findings and recommendations.
2.45. Final Approval Authority. Except as indicated in Table 2.1, the discharge authority may
approve and take final action on resignations tendered under this section.
 48                                                               AFI36-3209 14 APRIL 2005


2.46. Permissible Reasons for Resignation.
   2.46.1. Resignations Resulting in Honorable Discharge. Officers who tender their
   resignations for reasons in paragraphs 2.46.1.1 through 2.46.1.8, if accepted, will receive an
   Honorable discharge.
      2.46.1.1. Hardship. Exists when retaining the member causes undue hardship either to
      the member or to members of the officer's family. Members may be separated on
      presentation of conclusive evidence of genuine dependency or undue hardship. Genuine
      dependency or undue hardship does not necessarily exist solely because of altered present
      or expected income, or because members are separated from their family, or other
      inconveniences normally incident to military service. Separate and concurrently
      discharge as Reserve of the Air Force ANG members if subject to separation or discharge
      under this paragraph. Separation or discharge under this paragraph is authorized and may
      be directed when it is determined that:
          2.46.1.1.1. Genuine dependency or undue hardship exists.
          2.46.1.1.2. The dependency or hardship is not temporary.
          2.46.1.1.3. Conditions have arisen or have been aggravated to an excessive degree
          since military service began.
          2.46.1.1.4. The member has made every reasonable effort to remedy the situation.
          2.46.1.1.5. Separation or discharge of members will eliminate or materially alleviate
          the condition and there are no other means of alleviation reasonably available.
          2.46.1.1.6. Attach to a TOR any required documentation for dependency or hardship
          separations. Evidence required to support an application for dependency or hardship
          separation or discharge normally is in the form of written statements and must
          substantiate the conditions as stated in paragraph 2.46.1.1. Supporting evidence must
          be included with each request. The original of the statements must accompany the
          application.
              2.46.1.1.6.1. If dependency or hardship is the result of the death of someone in
              the member's family occurring since their commission, a certificate or other proof
              of death is required. If dependency or hardship is the result of a disability of
              someone in the member's family occurring since their commission, a physician's
              statement must tell what the disability is and when it occurred.
              2.46.1.1.6.2. List the names, ages, occupations, locations, and monthly incomes
              of the family members, and tell why they cannot provide the necessary care or
              support that must be furnished. Evidence of prospective civilian employment is
              required if the hardship is basically financial, and must show that the member will
              be able to exceed military pay if separated..
          2.46.1.1.7. On receipt of an application under this paragraph, the discharge authority:
              2.46.1.1.7.1. Carefully examines the basis for the application.
              2.46.1.1.7.2. Obtains any additional information believed necessary to determine
              the validity of the request.
AFI36-3209 14 APRIL 2005                                                                     49


            2.46.1.1.7.3. Determines whether the evidence justifies separation or discharge.
            2.46.1.1.7.4. Expedites the separation, if discharge is approved.
            2.46.1.1.7.5. If separation or discharge is disapproved, returns the case file
            through channels with instructions that the member be advised of the decision and
            counseled by a responsible individual concerning the procedures used and specific
            reasons for disapproval. Advises the member of any alternative actions available
            and that if conditions change sufficiently to warrant submission of a new
            application, member must submit new or additional evidence to support the
            application.
        2.46.1.1.8. Other factors:
            2.46.1.1.8.1. Indebtedness to the government or to a person does not preclude
            separation or discharge when the member is otherwise eligible.
            2.46.1.1.8.2. A member under charges, under investigation that may result in the
            preferring of charges, or in confinement is not eligible for separation or discharge
            under this paragraph until termination of such status.
            2.46.1.1.8.3. A member against whom administrative separation or discharge
            action has been initiated prior to submission of an application for hardship
            separation or discharge, normally is not eligible for separation or discharge under
            this paragraph until the final disposition of the administrative proceedings.
            2.46.1.1.8.4. Do not disapprove or delay separation or discharge under this
            paragraph because the member's services are needed in the organization.
     2.46.1.2. Final Vows in A Religious Order. If an officer seeks to take final vows in a
     religious order, include with the resignation a statement or certificate signed by the
     appropriate official of the religious order certifying that the applicant must be relieved
     from any military status before proceeding further with acceptance into the religious
     order.
     2.46.1.3. Regular or Ordained Ministers. If an officer becomes a regular or ordained
     minister, send documentary evidence of ordination with the application.
     2.46.1.4. Conscientious Objector. If an officer seeks to be discharged as a conscientious
     objector, tender a resignation according to the administrative procedures and criteria
     prescribed in AFI 36-3204, Procedures for Applying as a Conscientious Objector.
     2.46.1.5. Pregnancy or Childbirth.       Female members may find pregnancy and
     expectation of motherhood incompatible with continued military service. Therefore,
     those who become pregnant while in the military service may ask for separation or
     discharge. Request for separation or discharge for pregnancy by an AF Form 422,
     Physical Profile Serial Report, confirming the pregnancy, and signed by the examining
     physician or midwife. Any other document such as a letter from a physician providing
     the same information, may be substituted for the AF Form 422. The member must ask
     for discharge before the expected date of delivery. The discharge authority approves the
     application unless other administrative action (for example, involuntary separation or
     discharge) should be taken, or disapproval is deemed appropriate because the member's
     services are essential to the accomplishment of the mission of the unit. In some cases,
 50                                                                   AFI36-3209 14 APRIL 2005


       pregnancy may be terminated before an approved separation or discharge is effective. If
       the pregnancy is terminated by childbirth, the approved separation or discharge will be
       effected as soon as possible. If terminated other than by childbirth, the member will not
       be separated for pregnancy.
       2.46.1.6. Sole Surviving Son or Daughter. A sole surviving son or daughter is the only
       remaining son or daughter in a family where a parent, or one or more sons or daughters:
          2.46.1.6.1. Was killed in action or died in line of duty while serving in the Armed
          Forces. Death in the line of duty may have been due to wounds, accident, or disease.
          2.46.1.6.2. Is in a captured or missing-in-action status.
          2.46.1.6.3. Is permanently, 100 percent disabled, physically or mentally, as
          determined by the Veterans Administration or one of the military departments, or is
          hospitalized on a continuing basis and is not gainfully employed due to such
          disability.
NOTE:
Members may acquire and obtain sole surviving son or daughter status even if there are no other
living family members. It does not depend on the existence of a family unit. A sole surviving
son may have living sisters and a sole surviving daughter may have living brothers. Officers
may apply for release under very limited circumstances, see DoD Directive 1315.15, Special
Separation Policies for Survivorship.
       2.46.1.7. Miscellaneous Reasons. An officer not eligible to resign under any other
       criteria contained in this section may apply for discharge under this provision. Such
       applications will be approved only if discharge or separation of the officer is in the best
       interest of the service.
       2.46.1.8. When Service Obligations Have Been Satisfied: The officer has no unfulfilled
       MSO or contract.
   2.46.2. Resignation Resulting in General Discharge. When the separation or discharge
   authority does not accept a resignation tendered by an officer because the officer's records
   indicate that the officer is not entitled to an Honorable discharge, the officer may tender a
   resignation under this paragraph with the understanding that, if the resignation is accepted,
   the officer will receive a Under Honorable Conditions (General) Discharge.
   2.46.3. Resignation in Lieu of Action Under Chapter 2, Section 2C and/or Section 2D.
   Officers who receive a letter of notification advising that involuntary separation or discharge
   proceedings have been started, and specifying that they may tender their resignation under
   this paragraph, may tender their resignation in lieu of further action at any time before a final
   decision is reached in the separation or discharge proceedings. An officer whose resignation
   is accepted normally receives the characterization of service recommended in the letter of
   notification. Table 2.1 and Attachment 2, list the various types of characterization of
   service that may apply.
   2.46.4. Resignation for the Good of the Service. Officers whose conduct renders them
   triable by court-martial or who are serving a suspended sentence until dismissal may tender a
   resignation for the good of the service. Follow the procedures in AFI 36-3207,
   Administrative Separation of Commissioned Officers, Chapter 2, Section 2D.
AFI36-3209 14 APRIL 2005                                                                     51


Section 2F—Transfer of Non-EAD Members to a National Guard or Reserve Component of
Another Uniformed Service or Public Health Service (PHS)

2.47. Applying for Conditional Release.
   2.47.1. USAFR units use AFI 36-2004, Interservice Transfer of Officers on the Active Duty
   List to the United States Air Force (USAF). A member who desires to transfer to a Reserve
   component of another uniformed service must obtain a statement from the uniformed service
   concerned outlining the professional or technical background required for the position, when
   applicable, and evidence that:
      2.47.1.1. The member will be enrolled in an officer training program of the gaining
      uniformed service; or
      2.47.1.2. The gaining uniformed service has a specific Ready Reserve vacancy for which
      the member is qualified within a reasonable distance of the member's domicile or place of
      business.
   2.47.2. The member applies for a conditional release through channels to the discharge
   authority listed in Table 2.1. The member's request must include:
      2.47.2.1. Necessary information required to process the application.
      2.47.2.2. A statement from the member that:
          2.47.2.2.1. Indicates whether the member has applied for a Ready Reserve unit or
          Individual Reserve Program position, if the member is not already assigned to one of
          these positions.
          2.47.2.2.2. If transfer is approved, the member will accept assignment to the Ready
          Reserve position with the gaining uniformed service.
          2.47.2.2.3. The member consents to the transfer (required only if the gaining
          uniformed service initiates the request).
   2.47.3. Members will use DD Form 368, Request for Conditional Release, when seeking
   transfer to any reserve or regular component, with the exception of those requesting transfer
   to the Air Force Reserve. In this case an AF Form 1288, Application for Ready Reserve
   Assignment, should be used.
2.48. Approval and Disapproval Actions.
   2.48.1. When the separation or discharge authority listed in Table 2.1 grants a conditional
   release to an eligible applicant, they:
      2.48.1.1. Send the conditional release to the appropriate uniformed service with a request
      that a copy of the appointment or enlistment order be provided within 15-calendar days of
      appointment or enlistment.
      2.48.1.2. Upon receiving orders, the Military Personnel Flight (MPF) or HQ
      ARPC/DPAD will separate or discharge the member with an effective date of discharge
      the day before appointment or enlistment in the gaining uniformed service.
 52                                                             AFI36-3209 14 APRIL 2005


   2.48.2. When the separation or discharge authority disapproves a request for transfer, they
   return the request to the applicant with an explanation of the applicant's ineligibility.
2.49. Transfer to the USAF Reserve Retired List (ANG only). Transfer to the USAF Reserve
Retired List is not automatic. The member must apply by completing an AF Form 131,
Application for Transfer to the Retired Reserve. The separation or discharge order (unit
produced) will contain the following statement, "Member has applied for transfer to the USAF
Reserve Retired List." A copy of the separation or discharge order and the AF Form 131 will be
sent to the Retirement Branch (HQ ARPC/DPAR) and to ANG State Headquarters for ANG
personnel. HQ ARPC upon acceptance of the AF Form 131, will effect the placement on the
Retired Reserve List.
2.50. Attainment of Age 60 (ANG only). Separate from the ANG on their 60th birthday and
concurrently discharge as a Reserve of the Air Force, ANG members who have not qualified for
retirement under the provisions of this AFI, Chapter 5.
AFI36-3209 14 APRIL 2005                                                                        53

ADMINISTRATIVE SEPARATION OR DISCHARGE OF ANG OR USAFR ENLISTED
                           MEMBERS

Section 3A—General Information

3.1. General Instructions For Required Separations. Discharge of enlisted personnel at
expiration of enlistment, or to reenlist, and discharge due to incompatible status does not require
individual application or initiation of action by the commander. Any enlisted case that involves
lengthy service will be forwarded to the Air Force Personnel Council for action. NOTE: If there
is a conflict between Table 3.1 and a referenced paragraph, the paragraph supersedes the table.
See Attachment 1 for a detailed explanation of column F.

NOTE:
   1. Air Force Personnel Council review is required for members with lengthy service
   (paragraph 3.3.1).
   2. AETC/RS approval authority may be delegated in writing to the recruiting squadron
   commander. The discharge authority for the overseas organization accepting enlistment in
   the Regular Air Force approves separation for members enlisted in the Delayed Enlistment
   Program (DEP) overseas. Does not apply to ANG.
   3. Physical disqualification board procedures listed in paragraph 4.14.3.5 of this AFI apply
   to HQ ARPC personnel only.

Section 3B—Preprocessing Considerations

3.2. Initiation of Action. Refer to Section 3B, Section 3C, and Section 3D of this chapter for
preprocessing considerations.
   3.2.1. Initial required documentation for voluntary separation. Members who want to leave
   the Air Force before their ETS must ask for separation or discharge in writing. Each
   paragraph authorizing separation or discharge tells what is required to show a basis for
   separation or discharge.
   3.2.2. Unit assigned member. Except in cases based on physical disqualification, paragraph
   3.14, the unit commander initiates separation action by preparing a letter recommending
   separation (Attachment 6) and forwards it to the convening authority (for ANG), or through
   the wing commander to HQ AFRC/DPML (for AFRC) together with supporting documents
 60                                                                AFI36-3209 14 APRIL 2005


   and a review for legal sufficiency prepared by the local staff judge advocate. The convening
   authority (for ANG) or HQ AFRC/DPML (for AFRC) will:
       3.2.2.1. Return all cases which do not support action under this chapter.
       3.2.2.2. If separation or discharge processing is appropriate, process according to this
       chapter and Chapter 4. For cases based on physical disqualification, Director of Medical
       Services, ANGRC/SG, or HQ AFRC/DPML will initiate involuntary separation or
       discharge action without a commander's report and notify the respondent's unit
       commander of the separation or discharge action.
   3.2.3. Members not assigned to units. When unit commanders receive information
   indicating that a member under their jurisdiction should be considered for separation or
   discharge, they will forward the information through channels with all supporting documents
   to HQ ARPC/DPAD. NOTE: For IMAs, the case must include evidence of notification
   according to AFI 36-2115. HQ ARPC/DPAD will:
       3.2.3.1. Return cases which do not support action under this chapter.
       3.2.3.2. If not currently assigned to HQ ARPC, request reassignment action IAW AFI
       36-2115.
       3.2.3.3. If separation processing is appropriate, process according to this chapter and
       Chapter 4.
   3.2.4. ANG ONLY. Enlisted cases for members with lengthy service or cases which involve
   a characterization of other than honorable conditions, ANGRC/MPPAS, must be notified
   when initiated to ensure processing time goals are met as outlined in paragraph 4.7.
3.3. Enlisted Sanctuary. Reserve members in an active status who are selected to be
involuntarily separated (other than for physical disability or for cause), or whose term of
enlistment expires and who are denied reenlistment (other than for physical disability or for
cause), and who on the date on which the member is to be discharged or transferred from an
active status are entitled to be credited with at least 18, but less than 20 years of service
computed under Title 10 U.S.C., Section 12731, may not be discharged, denied reenlistment, or
transferred from an active status without the member’s consent. (See paragraph 1.13 for specific
time frames for retention.)
   3.3.1. Probation of Member With Lengthy Service. A member with lengthy service is one
   who, at the time the discharge action is initiated, has completed 18, but less than 20, years of
   satisfactory Federal service creditable toward retired pay according to 10 U.S.C., Section
   12731 or active military service creditable toward retired pay under 10 U.S.C., Section 8914.
   These members receive special consideration for retention on probation, to acquire minimum
   retired pay eligibility. If the member is approved for an involuntary discharge, for any
   reason except physical disqualification, the discharge is not executed until the case is
   reviewed by the SAF. The appropriate commander will send the original discharge case file
   to the Air Force Personnel Council, and include a memorandum approving the discharge with
   a recommendation on probation.
AFI36-3209 14 APRIL 2005                                                                      61


3.4. Discharge Obtained by Fraud. Federal civilian courts (according to 18 U.S.C., Section
1001) may prosecute a person who obtains a discharge from the military service by
misrepresentation, concealment, or fraud. The issuing authority may revoke the discharge and
return the offender to military control using this paragraph as the authority. The decision to
revoke a discharge is a matter for administrative determination based on consideration of all the
facts of the case. Take no revocation action unless approved by the discharge authority.
3.5. Serious Misconduct While Separation Is Pending. The unit commander reports serious
misconduct by the member to the discharge authority at once. This includes misconduct that
occurs at any time after the member applies, or is recommended, for separation or discharge.
The discharge authority may withdraw approval or withhold execution of a voluntary or
involuntary discharge or entry level separation. The discharge authority then takes other action
according to the facts of the case.
3.6. Extension of Enlistment When Separation for Cause Is Pending. An enlistment may be
involuntarily, administratively extended for the purpose of allowing sufficient time for
processing or conclusion of a trial or investigation for a violation of the UCMJ or the state
military code. Do not involuntarily retain a member beyond ETS for the processing of an
administrative discharge action.
3.7. Extension of Enlistment When Separation for Cause or Physical Disqualification Is
Pending. (HQ Air Force Reserve Only)
   3.7.1. If member’s ETS will not afford sufficient time to complete involuntary
   administrative discharge action, the commander will:
       3.7.1.1. Provide the member the opportunity to voluntarily extend the enlistment for the
       time needed to complete the case. They may request an extension of the enlistment under
       AFI 36-2612, USAFR Reenlistment and Retention Program.
       3.7.1.2. Tell the member that, if separation takes place on ETS while the involuntary
       discharge is pending, the member will not be eligible to reenlist.
       3.7.1.3. Allow the member time to consult military legal counsel before deciding
       whether to extend the enlistment.
   3.7.2. If the member has a remaining MSO, forward the complete case file including all
   evidence and proof of all administrative steps taken, to HQ ARPC/DPAD when the member
   is transferred to the Personnel Accounting Symbol ( PAS ) code S7 with a letter of
   explanation on action taken or pending. HQ ARPC/DPAD will review the case with the
   Judge Advocate office for possible administrative discharge action.
   3.7.3. Documentation evidencing notification to the member (Attachment 20) of
   opportunity to voluntarily extend enlistment with member’s election and AF Form 1411,
   Extension or Cancellation of Entensions of Enlistment in the Regular Air Force/Air
   Force Reserve, if applicable, must be included in the discharge case file.
   3.7.4. Separate on ETS, the member who declines to extend.
 62                                                                 AFI36-3209 14 APRIL 2005


3.8. Choosing a Course of Action.
   3.8.1. Involuntary administrative discharge is not a substitute for disciplinary action. If
   violations of the UCMJ or state military code are involved, unit commanders must consult
   the staff judge advocate for advice. If administrative discharge is the best course of action,
   consult with the servicing personnel office. They can help the commander ensure that action
   starts under the correct section of this chapter.
   3.8.2. For limitations on using certain information in administrative discharge action, see
   paragraph 3.10.
   3.8.3. Members who have been recommended for administrative discharge for cause do not
   have a right to be tried by court-martial instead. They may not ask for discharge processing
   according to a specific provision of this chapter.
   3.8.4. Table 3.1, column D, indicates board entitlement based on reason for separation.
   Paragraph 4.10 provides board eligibility requirements. Process other cases by notification
   procedures according to Chapter 4, paragraph 4.9.
3.9. Determining the Basis of the Action.
   3.9.1. As a rule, the acts or conditions on which a recommendation for discharge is based
   will have occurred or existed in the current enlistment. However, the acts or conditions on
   which the discharge recommendation is based may have occurred or existed:
       3.9.1.1. Prior to entry if the reason for discharge is fraudulent or erroneous enlistment.
       3.9.1.2. During any previous enlistment, if the reason for discharge was fraudulent
       enlistment or in the interest of national security.
       3.9.1.3. During the enlistment immediately preceding the current term of service, if the
       member reenlisted immediately followed discharge from the previous enlistment (no
       break in service), and the facts or circumstances pertaining to the acts or conditions were
       not known by the unit commander until after the member reenlisted. NOTE: See
       Attachment 2 about service characterization.
   3.9.2. Once unit commander pursues involuntary administrative discharge, they must look
   carefully at all the facts to be sure they recommend discharge for the right reason. In some
   cases, it may be preferable to cite two or more reasons as the basis for the discharge
   recommendation. If one reason cited in the letter of notification entitles the member to a
   board hearing, the entire matter will be processed according to Chapter 4, paragraph 4.10.
   For special instructions applicable to cases based on more than one reason, see paragraph 4.4.
3.10. Limitations on Separation Action. A member may not be discharged administratively
based on conduct that has been the subject of:
   3.10.1. Judicial proceedings, military or civilian, resulting in acquittal or action having the
   effect thereof unless:
       3.10.1.1. Such action is based on a judicial determination not applicable to the guilt or
       innocence of the respondent.
       3.10.1.2. The judicial proceeding was conducted in a state or foreign court and the
       discharge is approved by the SAF.
AFI36-3209 14 APRIL 2005                                                                         63


   3.10.2. A prior board hearing in which the board entered an approved finding that the
   evidence did not sustain the factual allegations concerning the conduct. EXCEPTION: A
   rehearing in a case involving fraud or collusion.
   3.10.3. Administrative discharge processing which results in retention, except when:
       3.10.3.1. The new proceeding is based, in whole or in part, on subsequent conduct or
       performance.
       3.10.3.2. There is new or newly discovered evidence that was not reasonably available at
       the time of the prior proceeding.
       3.10.3.3. The conduct is the subject of a new hearing ordered on the basis of fraud or
       collusion in the prior hearing.
   3.10.4. A waiver that was approved by the discharge authority who had the option to
   discharge for civil court conviction or defective enlistment.
3.11. Enlisted Personnel in Temporary Duty (TDY) Status.
   3.11.1. ANG members in a title 32 status will be returned to the home unit for disposition.
   3.11.2. Discharge authority for non-participating (S7) and IMA reservists remains with the
   Commander, ARPC.
   3.11.3. The appropriate technical training center will separate or discharge members on EAD
   or Initial Active Duty Training (IADT), according to AFI 36-3208, Administrative
   Separation of Airmen. Copies of orders will be furnished to the losing Military Personnel
   Flight (MPF).
   3.11.4. If violations of the UCMJ or state military code are involved, commanders must
   consult the staff judge advocate for advice. If it seems that administrative separation or
   discharge is the best course of action, the unit commander will consult MPF personnel to
   terminate the member's active duty status and ensure that action starts under the correct
   section of this chapter.

Section 3C—Voluntary Separations

3.12. Basis for Separation. The characterization of separation for members applying for
separation or discharge for convenience of the government is honorable unless an entry level
separation is authorized. A member may apply under this section for the following reasons:
   3.12.1. Expiration of Enlistment. Members are discharged at the expiration of an enlistment
   or completion of their MSO, whichever is later. If a member is not selected for reenlistment
   see Section 3D, paragraph 3.13.14.
   3.12.2. Immediate Reenlistment. Members who request and are accepted for reenlistment
   IAW criteria established in AFI 36-2612 and ANGI 36-2002, Enlistment and Reenlistment in
   the Air National Guard and as a Reserve of the Air Force, are discharged before expiration
   of term of service. The effective date of the discharge is the day before reenlistment.
   3.12.3. Incompatible Status or Change of Military Affiliation. Members who accept
   appointments as commissioned officers in any component of the Air Force or enlist in the
   Regular Air Force are separated or discharged from the service. ANG members are required
64                                                               AFI36-3209 14 APRIL 2005


  to remain in the ANG for a period equal to twice the time spent on their IADT tour basic
  military training (BMT) and technical training school or home station (on-the-job training)
  prior to being permitted to enlist in a regular component. This requirement can be waived by
  the State Adjutant General.
     3.12.3.1. The Military Entrance Processing Station (MEPS) effects separation or
     discharge of Reserve members in the DEP, who accepts and enlists in the Regular Air
     Force.
     3.12.3.2. Members who enlist or accept appointment in another armed force or
     uniformed service (including the PHS) are discharged.
     3.12.3.3. ANG members who voluntarily decide to change their military affiliation are
     separated or discharged. These members will be separated from the ANG and
     concurrently from the Reserve of the Air Force.
         3.12.3.3.1. The separation or discharge will not be effected until notification is
         received from the gaining component that the enlistment was accomplished. The
         effective date of discharge will be the day prior to the date of enlistment in the new
         component.
         3.12.3.3.2. ANG members who enlist in the Reserve in order to be voluntarily
         recalled to active duty under the provisions of AFI 36-2002, Regular Air Force and
         Special Category Accessions, will be separated from the ANG and concurrently
         transferred to the Reserve.
         3.12.3.3.3. When ANG members enroll and are accepted into Reserve Officer
         Training Course (ROTC) or in an advanced course (third or fourth year) of the Army,
         Navy, Air Force ROTC, they must separate from the ANG and concurrently be
         discharged as a Reserve of the Air Force. Accomplish ANG member separation or
         discharge in the manner prescribed in Section 3C, Chapter 3 of this instruction.
         3.12.3.3.4. Members in the basic course (first and second year) of the Army, Navy,
         or Air Force ROTC who are receiving awarded college scholarships granted under
         Title 10 U.S.C., Section 2107 must belong to the Reserve component of the Armed
         Forces that extended the grant.
         3.12.3.3.5. Members may apply for appointment as a commissioned or warrant
         officer or for enlistment in another service without jeopardizing their status provided
         they are not in the Retired Reserve or on EAD orders or ADT, and they qualify and
         obtain a conditional release according to AFI 36-2004. ANG member’s separation or
         discharge will be accomplished in the manner prescribed in paragraph 3.12, Section
         3C, Chapter 3 of this instruction.
         3.12.3.3.6. HQ ARPC, upon receipt of documentary evidence from the gaining
         service that a member has enlisted, been inducted or accepted an appointment, will
         discharge the member from the Air Force Reserve effective the day before the date of
         entry into the gaining service. HQ ARPC will furnish copies of the orders published
         to the member and the gaining service.
AFI36-3209 14 APRIL 2005                                                                   65


     3.12.3.4. Removal From Unit. This paragraph applies to ANG only when members
     change their place of residence. When members are located outside a reasonable
     commuting distance of their present unit and not within a reasonable commuting distance
     of another ANG or Reserve unit, the member may request to be separated or discharged
     under paragraph 3.12.3. Upon approval, members with an MSO will be separated from
     the ANG and concurrently transferred to HQ ARPC.
     3.12.3.5. Incompatible Occupation (ANG Only). When an incompatible occupation is of
     a permanent nature, the request for separation/discharge must be supported by a signed
     affidavit from the individual, if self-employed, or from the employer or a designated
     representative, explaining in detail how the individual’s occupation is incompatible with
     or severely interferes with the member’s performance of ANG duties. The member must
     have made every reasonable effort to satisfy their ANG responsibilities and duties.
  3.12.4. Applying for Conditional Release:
     3.12.4.1. A member who desires to transfer to a Reserve component of another
     uniformed service must obtain a statement from the uniformed service concerned
     outlining the professional or technical background required for the position, when
     applicable, and evidence that:
         3.12.4.1.1. The member will be enrolled in an officer training program of the gaining
         uniformed service; or
         3.12.4.1.2. The gaining uniformed service has a specific Ready Reserve vacancy for
         which the member is qualified within a reasonable distance of the member's domicile
         or place of business.
     3.12.4.2. The member applies for a conditional release through channels to the
     separation or discharge authority listed in table Table 3.1. The member's request must
     include:
         3.12.4.2.1. Necessary information required to process application.
         3.12.4.2.2. A statement from the member that:
            3.12.4.2.2.1. Indicates whether the member has applied for a Ready Reserve unit
            or Individual Reserve Program position, if the member is not already assigned to
            one of these positions.
            3.12.4.2.2.2. If transfer is approved, the member will accept assignment to the
            Ready Reserve position with the gaining uniformed service.
            3.12.4.2.2.3. The member consents to the transfer (required only if the gaining
            uniformed service initiates the request)
  3.12.5. Approval and Disapproval Actions:
     3.12.5.1. When the separation or discharge authority listed in Table 3.1 grants a
     conditional release to an eligible applicant, they:
         3.12.5.1.1. Send the conditional release to the appropriate uniformed service with a
         request that a copy of the appointment or enlistment order be provided within 15-
         calendar days of appointment or enlistment.
66                                                                AFI36-3209 14 APRIL 2005


         3.12.5.1.2. On receiving orders, separate or discharge the member with an effective
         date of discharge the day before appointment or enlistment in the gaining uniformed
         service.
         3.12.5.1.3. When the separation or discharge authority disapproves a request for
         transfer, return the request to the applicant with an explanation of the applicant's
         ineligibility.
     3.12.5.2. Members will use DD Form 368, when seeking transfer to any reserve or
     regular component, with the exception of those requesting transfer to the Air Force
     Reserve. In this case an AF Form 1288, should be used.
  3.12.6. Transfer to the USAF Reserve Retired List. Transfer to the USAF Reserve Retired
  List is not automatic. The member must apply by completing an AF Form 131 (ANG Only).
  The separation or discharge order (unit produced) will contain the following statement,
  "Member has applied for transfer to the USAF Reserve Retired List." A copy of the
  separation or discharge order and the AF Form 131 will be sent to the Retirement Branch,
  HQ ARPC/DPAR and to ANG State Headquarters for ANG personnel. HQ ARPC upon
  acceptance of the AF Form 131, will effect the placement on the Retired Reserve List.
  3.12.7. Religious Vows. Members who are taking final vows of a religious order which
  requires discharge from the military service must submit evidence to support the request.
  Effect the discharge upon notification that the member has taken the final vows. Separate the
  individual from the ANG and concurrently discharge as a Reserve of the Air Force.
  3.12.8. Resignation For Own Convenience. A member who is not eligible for separation or
  discharge under any other criteria in this instruction may apply for separation or discharge
  under this paragraph. This does not apply to first term enlisted personnel.
  3.12.9. Early Release to Further Education or Training (ANG only). ANG members who
  submit a request for separation or discharge under this paragraph will have supporting
  documentation or justification that must conclusively establish incompatibility for the
  individual to remain in the ANG.
     3.12.9.1. When an extended course of formal education and or training does not permit
     an individual to perform their normal ANG duties, an appropriate official of the college,
     university, or other institution must submit a letter explaining how the member's service
     in the ANG prevents them from satisfactorily furthering their education or training.
     Make every effort to have the individual affiliated with another unit, if applicable.
     3.12.9.2. Upon approval by the discharge authority, either discharge the member from
     the ANG and as a Reserve of the Air Force or, if possessing an MSO, separate from the
     ANG and transfer to HQ ARPC.
  3.12.10. Early Release To Accept Public Office (ANG only). This paragraph does not apply
  to ANG members serving on their first enlistment, or members that have a service
  commitment based upon formal training or other education wholly or partly at the expense of
  the government. ANG members may be separated or discharged to accept public office only
  under circumstances as authorized below.
     3.12.10.1. Election as a partisan or nonpartisan candidate to any civil office.
     3.12.10.2. Appointment to a civil office requiring full-time service.
AFI36-3209 14 APRIL 2005                                                                    67


  3.12.11. Dependency or Hardship. Members may be separated on presentation of conclusive
  evidence of genuine dependency or undue hardship. Genuine dependency or undue hardship
  does not necessarily exist solely because of altered present or expected income, or because
  the member is separated from their family, or other inconveniences normally incident to
  military service. Separate and concurrently discharge as a Reserve of the Air Force ANG
  members if subject to separation or discharge under this paragraph. Separation or discharge
  under this paragraph is authorized and may be directed when it is determined that:
     3.12.11.1. Genuine dependency or undue hardship exists.
     3.12.11.2. The dependency or hardship is not temporary.
     3.12.11.3. Conditions have arisen or have been aggravated to an excessive degree since
     current enlistment began.
     3.12.11.4. The member has made every reasonable effort to remedy the situation.
     3.12.11.5. Separation or discharge of members will eliminate or materially alleviate the
     condition and there are no other means of alleviation reasonably available
     3.12.11.6. Required documentation for dependency or hardship separations. Evidence
     required to support an application for dependency or hardship separation or discharge
     normally is in the form of written statements and must substantiate the conditions as
     stated in paragraph 3.12.11. Supporting evidence must be included with each request.
     The original of the statements must accompany the application.
         3.12.11.6.1. If dependency or hardship is the result of the death of someone in the
         member's family occurring since their current enlistment began, a certificate or other
         proof of death is required. If dependency or hardship is the result of a disability of
         someone in the member's family occurring since their current enlistment began, a
         physician's statement must tell what the disability is and when it occurred.
         3.12.11.6.2. List the names, ages, occupations, locations, and monthly incomes of the
         family members, and tell why they cannot provide the necessary care or support that
         must be furnished. Evidence of prospective civilian employment is required if the
         hardship is basically financial, and must show that the member will be able to exceed
         military pay if separated
     3.12.11.7. On receipt of an application for separation or discharge under this paragraph,
     the discharge authority:
         3.12.11.7.1. Carefully examines the basis for the application
         3.12.11.7.2. Obtains any additional information believed necessary to determine the
         validity of the request.
         3.12.11.7.3. Determines whether the evidence justifies separation or discharge.
         3.12.11.7.4. Expedites the separation if discharge is approved.
         3.12.11.7.5. If separation or discharge is disapproved, returns the case file through
         channels with instructions that the member be advised of the decision and counseled
         by a responsible individual concerning the procedures used and specific reasons for
         disapproval. Advise the member of any alternative actions available and that if
68                                                                AFI36-3209 14 APRIL 2005


         conditions change sufficiently to warrant submission of a new application, member
         must submit new or additional evidence to support the application.
     3.12.11.8. Other factors:
         3.12.11.8.1. Indebtedness to the government or to a person does not preclude
         separation or discharge when the member is otherwise eligible.
         3.12.11.8.2. A member under charges, under investigation that may result in the
         preferring of charges, or in confinement is not eligible for separation or discharge
         under this paragraph until termination of such status.
         3.12.11.8.3. A member against whom administrative separation or discharge action
         has been initiated prior to submission of an application for hardship separation or
         discharge, normally is not eligible for separation or discharge under this paragraph
         until the final disposition of the administrative proceedings.
         3.12.11.8.4. Do not disapprove or delay separation or discharge according to this
         paragraph because the member's services are needed in the organization.
         3.12.11.8.5. An application for separation or discharge may show that a member had
         dependents who were not acknowledged at the time of enlistment. If so, consider the
         possibility of separation or discharge for erroneous or fraudulent enlistment. The
         error or fraud may be waived to permit separation or discharge under this paragraph
  3.12.12. Pregnancy or Childbirth. Female members may find pregnancy and expectation of
  motherhood incompatible with continued military service. Therefore, those who become
  pregnant while in the military service may ask for separation or discharge. Members who
  were pregnant at the time of enlistment are not eligible for separation or discharge under this
  paragraph. They were not physically qualified for entry into military service IAW AFI 48-
  123 and may be subject to separation or discharge for erroneous or fraudulent enlistment.
     3.12.12.1. Required documentation for pregnancy or childbirth. Request for separation
     or discharge for pregnancy by an AF Form 422, confirming the pregnancy. It must be
     signed by the examining physician or midwife. Any other document such as a letter from
     a physician providing the same information, may be substituted for the AF Form 422.
     The member must ask for discharge before the expected date of delivery. The discharge
     authority approves the application unless other administrative action (for example,
     involuntary separation or discharge) should be taken, or disapproval is deemed
     appropriate because the member's services are essential to the accomplishment of the
     mission of the unit. In some cases, pregnancy may be terminated before an approved
     separation or discharge is effective. If the pregnancy is terminated by childbirth, the
     approved separation or discharge will be effected as soon as possible. If terminated other
     than by childbirth, the member will not be separated for pregnancy.
  3.12.13. Conscientious Objector. Members may be separated or discharged due to
  conscientious objection. Process applications for such separation or discharge according to
  AFI 36-3204. If approved, separation or discharge is effective under this paragraph. For
  discharge authority refer to Table 3.1.
  3.12.14. Sole Surviving Son or Daughter. A sole surviving son or daughter is the only
  remaining son or daughter in a family where a parent, or one or more sons or daughters:
AFI36-3209 14 APRIL 2005                                                                       69


       3.12.14.1. Was killed in action or died in line of duty while serving in the Armed Forces.
       Death in the line of duty may have been due to wounds, accident, or disease.
       3.12.14.2. Is in a captured or missing-in-action status.
       3.12.14.3. Is permanently 100 percent disabled, physically or mentally, as determined by
       the Veterans Administration or one of the military departments, or is hospitalized on a
       continuing basis and is not gainfully employed due to such disability. NOTE: Members
       may acquire and obtain sole surviving son or daughter status even if there are no other
       living family members. It does not depend on the existence of a family unit. A sole
       surviving son may have living sisters and a sole surviving daughter may have living
       brothers.
       3.12.14.4. Members who become a sole surviving son or daughter after enlistment will
       be separated promptly, on request, unless they have waived the right to separation or
       discharge either by action described below or in writing, or asked for separation or
       discharge during time of war or national emergency.
       3.12.14.5. Members who meet the criteria for sole surviving son or daughter are
       considered to have waived the right to be separated under this provision if, after they are
       advised of the policy, they reenlist or extend their enlistment.
   3.12.15. Insufficient Retainability For Mobilization Or Ineligibility For Worldwide
   Deployment. Members who request exemption from mobilization according to AFI 10-402,
   Mobilization Planning, because of insufficient retainability must at the same time apply for
   discharge. The application for discharge is processed with the request for exemption. If
   discharge is approved, it is effected according to this paragraph. Separate ANG members
   when the following conditions exist or occur:
       3.12.15.1. The failure to reenlist or extend an enlistment to meet the minimum active
       duty military service requirements as specified in the mobilization instructions for an
       ANG unit will result in separation or discharge of the member. If the member possesses
       an MSO of 120 or more days, separation from the ANG and transfer to the HQ ARPC is
       appropriate. If the member has less than 120 days remaining on an unexpired MSO,
       separation and concurrent discharge as a Reserve of the Air Force will be effected.
       3.12.15.2. Separate or discharge an ANG member who is not qualified or eligible for
       worldwide deployment. The commander initiates action under this authority upon
       determination that such conditions exist. Discharge members who fail to apply for
       transfer to the Retired Reserve, if eligible, under this authority if:
           3.12.15.2.1. The reason is medical and the medical examination and/or other
           documents as required certify the member as medically disqualified for worldwide
           duty and that member is not qualified for disability separation, discharge, or
           retirement. Process disability cases IAW AFI 36-3212.
           3.12.15.2.2. Other documented reasons prevent worldwide deployment.
NOTE:
Initiation of discharge action under the above authorities ceases upon alert for mobilization or
recall to active duty.
 70                                                                AFI36-3209 14 APRIL 2005


   3.12.16. Discharge for the Good of the Service. Members whose conduct renders them
   triable by court-martial may request voluntary discharge for the good of the service.
   3.12.17. Miscellaneous Reasons. Members who do not qualify for separation or discharge
   for another reason may request separation or discharge under this paragraph. Evaluate each
   application on its own merit; however, in determining whether a request for separation or
   discharge will be approved, the needs of the service are paramount and will be the controlling
   consideration.

Section 3D—Involuntary Separations

3.13. Reasons for Separation. A member may be separated for convenience of the government
for the following reasons. Prior to involuntary separation or discharge under this section, the
notification procedure in Chapter 4, Section 4B, of this instruction will be used.
   3.13.1. Selective Retention. This paragraph applies to the ANG only. Member was non-
   selected for retention under ANGI 36-2606, Selective Retention of Air National Guard
   Officers and Enlisted Personnel.
   3.13.2. Unsatisfactory Participation.
       3.13.2.1. Do not use these reasons if a member is in entry level status. Members of the
       selected Reserve who have not fulfilled their statutory military service obligation under
       Title 10 U.S.C., Section 651, and whose participation has not been satisfactory may be:
          3.13.2.1.1. Discharged for unsatisfactory participation when the commander
          concerned has determined that the individual has no potential for useful service under
          conditions of full mobilization. Member may be discharged when the member has
          accumulated nine or more unexcused absences from UTA within a 12-month period.
          Service characterization will be determined by using the criteria in Attachment 2.
NOTE:
Members may be discharged if they fail to report to the ANG unit of assignment within 90 days
after the date of release from active Federal service. See AFM 36-8001, for all participation
requirements.
          3.13.2.1.2. Palace Chase obligors should be processed IAW AFI 36-3205.
       3.13.2.2. Do not use this reason if a member is in entry level status. Members of the
       selected Reserve who have fulfilled their statutory military service obligation under Title
       10 U.S.C., Section 651 or who did not incur such obligation, and whose participation has
       not been satisfactory IAW AFI 36-8001 may be:
          3.13.2.2.1. Discharged for unsatisfactory participation when the commander
          concerned has determined that the individual has no potential for useful service under
          conditions of full mobilization. Member may be discharged when the member has
          accumulated nine or more unexcused absences from UTA within a 12 month period.
          Service characterization will be determined by using the criteria in Attachment 2.
          See AFM 36-8001, for all participation requirements. NOTE: Members may be
          discharged if they fail to report to the ANG unit of assignment within 90 days after
          the date of release from active Federal service.
AFI36-3209 14 APRIL 2005                                                                     71


  3.13.3. Parenthood. Members are subject to involuntary separation or discharge for inability
  to satisfactorily perform their prescribed duties, repetitive absenteeism, or non-availability
  for worldwide assignment or deployment as a result of parenthood.
     3.13.3.1. For Air Force policy concerning dependent care responsibilities, see AFI 36-
     2908, Family Care Plan.
     3.13.3.2. Before initiating separation or discharge action in these cases, the unit
     commander must counsel the member concerning deficiencies and voluntary actions that
     may help resolve the problem, and give the member an opportunity to overcome the
     deficiencies. The case file should contain a record of counseling and an explanation of
     the actions taken to help the member meet both parental responsibilities and Air Force
     standards.
  3.13.4. Conditions That Interfere With Military Service (see Table 3.1). Members may be
  separated or discharged based on one of the physical or mental conditions listed below when
  the condition is not disqualifying under AFI 48-123, but interferes with assignment or duty
  performance. The existence of a condition that is a basis for separation or discharge under
  this provision does not bar separation or discharge for any other reason authorized in this
  instruction. Separation or discharge under this provision is not appropriate if the member’s
  record would support discharge for another reason, such as, misconduct or unsatisfactory
  performance. A recommendation for discharge must be supported by documents confirming
  the existence of the condition and showing the condition is not severe enough to medically
  disqualify the member for worldwide duty. Except for enuresis or sleepwalking, the adverse
  affect on assignment or duty performance must be explained.
     3.13.4.1. ANG members may be separated or discharged when it is determined that they
     are medically unqualified for further military service under the following conditions:
         3.13.4.1.1. Conditions not incurred in a duty status as determined by a line of duty
         investigation per AFI 36-2910, Line of Duty (Misconduct) Determination or ANGI
         36-2910, Line of Duty and Misconduct Determination. Separate from the ANG and
         concurrently discharge as a Reserve of the Air Force ANG members found to be
         "Medically Disqualified for Worldwide Duty," medically disqualified for active
         military service or for active military service with a waiver, whose medical
         documentation has been certified by ANGRC/SG. Separate from the ANG and
         transfer to HQ ARPC eligible ANG members who request transfer to the Retired
         Reserve per Chapter 5 of this instruction.
         3.13.4.1.2. Service-connected disability. Do not discharge ANG members being
         processed for service-connected disabilities until notified by the Chief, National
         Guard Bureau, for final disposition.
     3.13.4.2. A report of evaluation by a psychiatrist or a psychologist must support a
     recommendation for discharge for character and behavior disorders:
         3.13.4.2.1. Confirming the diagnosis of a disorder listed in the current DSM of
         Mental Disorders.
         3.13.4.2.2. Describing the effect of the disorder on the member's conduct or
         performance of duty.
72                                                               AFI36-3209 14 APRIL 2005


         3.13.4.2.3. Finding that the disorder is so severe, the member's ability to function in
         the military environment is significantly impaired.
     3.13.4.3. The following may be a basis for discharge under this provision:
         3.13.4.3.1. Enuresis, if there is no underlying pathology.
         3.13.4.3.2. Sleepwalking.
         3.13.4.3.3. Dyslexia.
         3.13.4.3.4. Severe nightmares.
         3.13.4.3.5. Stammering or stuttering, of such a degree that the member is normally
         unable to communicate adequately.
         3.13.4.3.6. Incapacitating fear of flying confirmed by a psychiatric evaluation.
         3.13.4.3.7. Air sickness.
         3.13.4.3.8. Claustrophobia.
     3.13.4.4. 5 Psycho-sexual disorders and psycho-sexual dysfunction.
         3.13.4.4.1. Personality disorders.
         3.13.4.4.2. Conduct disorders.
         3.13.4.4.3. Adjustment disorders.
         3.13.4.4.4. Disorders of impulse control.
         3.13.4.4.5. Psycho-sexual disorders and psycho-sexual dysfunction.
  3.13.5. Failure To Reply to Official Correspondence. Members who do not reply to official
  correspondence may be discharged. When correspondence requiring a reply is sent and no
  reply is received within 30 days, the unit commander or ARPC personnel will:
     3.13.5.1. Verify the last permanent mailing address. After verification, mail the
     correspondence or a follow-up, by certified mail, return receipt requested, and by first-
     class mail to the verified address.
     3.13.5.2. Comply with paragraph 3.13.6 if postal authorities return the correspondence
     because the member cannot be located,
     3.13.5.3. Prepare a detailed report outlining attempts to notify the member if the member
     does not reply to correspondence within 30 days of date of mailing. The report includes a
     recommendation for retention, separation, or discharge and copies of unanswered
     correspondence and signed postal receipts.
  3.13.6. Inability To Locate. Members who cannot be located will be discharged. When
  postal authorities send and return mail as undeliverable, the unit commander or ARPC
  personnel will:
     3.13.6.1. Request verification of last permanent mailing address from the postmaster. If
     an address correction is received, update the record and re-mail correspondence.
AFI36-3209 14 APRIL 2005                                                                      73


     3.13.6.2. Take other action if the verification from the postmaster does not result in
     obtaining the current address. Contact local civil authorities or other persons who may be
     of assistance in locating the member.
     3.13.6.3. Send a detailed report to the discharge authority including correspondence
     returned and outlining actions taken to locate the member if unable to locate the member.
     3.13.6.4. Terminate action to separate the member if the member is located at any time
     prior to separation or discharge.
  3.13.7. Entrance or Service in an Armed Force of a Foreign Country. Citizens of the US (by
  birth or naturalization) may lose their nationality by entering or serving in an armed force of
  a foreign country without specific written authorization for such entry or service from the
  Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense. Loss of nationality is a reason for discharge
  under paragraph 3.13.9. Procedures for obtaining authorization and reporting lack of
  authorization are detailed below:
     3.13.7.1. Members who wish to enter an armed force of a foreign country submit their
     request through channels. The commander will advise the member in writing of the
     provisions of Title 8 U.S.C., Section 1481, Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, as
     amended, concerning possible loss of nationality. The member will acknowledge receipt
     of the advice before the application is processed further. A member who still desires to
     apply submits a written application through command channels to Chief, Foreign
     Operations, Passport Office, Department of State, Washington DC 20524 with a brief
     summary of member's service attached. Additional information and authorities for
     members to enter armed forces of certain foreign countries are in Title 10 U.S.C., Section
     1060 and AFI 36-2913.
     3.13.7.2. If a commander receives information concerning a member who enters or
     serves in an armed force of a foreign country without having obtained permission, they
     will refer the information through command channels for review and determination of
     appropriate action.
  3.13.8. Accepting Civil Employment With a Foreign Government. Members who accept
  civil employment with a foreign government or a concern which is controlled in whole or in
  part by a foreign government may be discharged if prior written approval of the SAF and the
  Secretary of State was not obtained or when employment is continued after the SAF or the
  Secretary of State has revoked prior written approval. Forward cases through command
  channels. Discharge ANG members concurrently from the ANG and as a Reserve of the Air
  Force.
  3.13.9. Loss of Nationality. Members who are citizens of the US (by birth or naturalization)
  and lose such nationality for any reason outlined in the Immigration and Nationality Act, as
  amended (Title 8 U.S.C., Section 1481, 66 Statute 166), or any other provision of law, may
  be discharged. Forward recommendations for discharge or retention under this paragraph
  through command channels to SAF. If retention is not warranted, discharge ANG members
  concurrently from the ANG and as a Reserve of the Air Force.
  3.13.10. Disenrollment from AFROTC. This paragraph does not apply to the ANG. Process
  according to AFI 36-2011, Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps. Cite this paragraph as
  the authority, if the discharge authority directs discharge.
 74                                                                  AFI36-3209 14 APRIL 2005


   3.13.11. Deactivation of a Unit. If a unit is deactivated and there are no other unit vacancies
   within the area to which the member may be assigned and the member does not join a unit
   outside that area, the member will be separated from the Reserve or ANG unit. If the
   member is assigned to the ANG, they will be concurrently transferred to HQ ARPC if they
   have a remaining MSO or some other contractual obligation.
   3.13.12. (ANG Only) Provisions of State Law. When authorized by state law.
   3.13.13. Failure To Comply with Requirements for a Medical Examination. Discharge
   enlisted personnel who have no MSO and meet any of the following criteria and the unit
   commander or ARPC personnel have made a reasonable effort to contact them:
       3.13.13.1. They fail to complete a periodic physical, as required by AFI 48-123, within
       90 days after the date due.
       3.13.13.2. They fail to obtain a physical directed by a competent authority on the
       specified date.
   3.13.14. When a member is not selected for reenlistment the member will be discharged
   upon his ETS/MSO, whichever is later
3.14. Physical Disqualification. Discharge a member who is unfit to perform the duties of the
member’s office, grade, or rank because of disease or injury. The convening or discharge
authority is authorized to finalize cases processed under this section. Physical disqualification
notification and board procedures listed in paragraph 4.14.3.5, of this AFI apply to HQ ARPC
personnel only. The characterization of service will be honorable. Discharge members under
this paragraph when they meet all of these criteria:
   3.14.1. The appropriate surgeon certifies the report of medical examination and other
   documentation as required by AFI 48-123 that they are unfit.
   3.14.2. They fail to apply for transfer to the Retired Reserve.
   3.14.3. They are not qualified for disability separation or retirement under the provisions of
   AFI 36-3212.
   3.14.4. The member is ineligible for transfer to a different AFSC or position in which the
   member would be fit for duty, or such transfer is considered inappropriate.
   3.14.5. The member has been considered and rejected for an assignment limitation code.
   3.14.6. The discharge authority finds, IAW applicable DoD and Air Force standards, that the
   member’s physical disqualifying condition makes them unfit for duty.
   3.14.7. Prior to the execution of a discharge for physical disqualification for a non-duty
   related impairment or condition the member shall be afforded the opportunity to enter the
   DES for a determination of fitness pursuant to DoDD 1332.18 and implementing regulatory
   issuances.
3.15. Minority, Erroneous, Defective and Fraudulent Entry.
   3.15.1. Minority, Enlisted under Age 17. A person under age 17 is barred by law from
   enlistment and will be separated (released from custody and control of the Air Force) as soon
   as practicable. No discharge certificate or other evidence of service will be issued as the
   enlistment did not exist as a matter of law.
AFI36-3209 14 APRIL 2005                                                                     75


     3.15.1.1. There must be evidence satisfactory to the discharge authority that the member
     was under 18 years of age when the separation or discharge is initiated, and the parent or
     guardian must submit their request for the member's separation within 90 days after the
     member's enlistment.
  3.15.2. Erroneous Enlistment. A member may be discharged based on an erroneous
  enlistment, reenlistment, or extension of enlistment. An enlistment, reenlistment, or
  extension is erroneous if it should not have been accepted by the Air Force, but does not
  involve fraud. An erroneous enlistment, reenlistment, or extension exists if:
     3.15.2.1. It would not have occurred had the relevant facts been known by the Air Force,
     or had appropriate directives been followed.
     3.15.2.2. It was not the result of fraudulent conduct on the part of the member.
     3.15.2.3. The defect is unchanged in material respects.
     3.15.2.4. If the unit commander recommends that the member be retained in the Air
     Force, the initiation of separation processing is not required if the defect is no longer
     present, or the defect is waiverable and a waiver is obtained from the discharge authority.
     Defects constituting a void enlistment are not waiverable (see Attachment 2).
     3.15.2.5. If the commander recommends the member be retained in the ANG, the
     initiation of separation processing is not required in the following circumstances:
         3.15.2.5.1. The defect is no longer present.
         3.15.2.5.2. The defect is waiverable and a waiver is obtained from the State Adjutant
         General or Manpower, Personnel and Training, ANGRC/MP, as appropriate.
         3.15.2.5.3. The defect consists of failure to meet physical standards for enlistment
         and the member is medically qualified for worldwide duty. NOTE: Administrative
         discharge of members. The administrative process to notify members must be
         followed; however, members are not entitled to an administrative discharge board.
  3.15.3. Defective Enlistment Agreements. A member may be discharged based on a
  defective enlistment, reenlistment, or extension of enlistment. A defective enlistment
  agreement exists if:
     3.15.3.1. As a result of a material misrepresentation by recruiting personnel, upon which
     the member reasonably relied, the member was induced to enlist with a commitment for
     which the member was not qualified.
     3.15.3.2. The member received a written enlistment commitment from recruiting
     personnel for which the member was qualified, but which cannot be fulfilled by the Air
     Force or ANG.
     3.15.3.3. The enlistment was involuntary as defined in the UCMJ or state military code.
     3.15.3.4. The existence of a defective enlistment agreement does not bar appropriate
     disciplinary action, or other separation or discharge proceedings, regardless of when the
     defect is raised.
76                                                                 AFI36-3209 14 APRIL 2005


     3.15.3.5. Separation or discharge for defective enlistment agreement is appropriate only
     if the member did not knowingly participate in the creation of the defective agreement
     and once the member discovers the defect, notifies the appropriate authorities within 30
     days of discovery, or should reasonably have known of the defect, and the member
     requests separation or discharge instead of other authorized corrective actions.
     3.15.3.6. Separation or discharge under this provision is not a continuing entitlement.
     Members may apply for discharge within 30 days after notification of an assignment,
     reassignment, classification, reclassification, or other action that violates their assignment
     before the Air Force has met its obligations. If they fail to do so, they waive entitlement
     of separation under this provision.
     3.15.3.7. A request for separation or discharge under this provision must be supported by
     copies of the documents that show the enlistment agreement(s) and correspondence
     showing the alleged failure of the Air Force or ANG, as appropriate, to meet the terms of
     the enlistment agreement that have not been changed by supplements to it.
  3.15.4. Fraudulent Entry. A member may be discharged, on the basis of a fraudulent
  enlistment or period of military service through any deliberate material misrepresentation,
  omission, or concealment which might have resulted in rejection, if known at the time of
  enlistment or entry into a period of service. Do not separate members for fraudulent entry
  because they misrepresented at the time of enlistment, their minority, or consent of parent or
  guardian.
     3.15.4.1. The Discharge Authority. The discharge authority may approve a waiver of the
     fraud and retain the member. Defects constituting a void enlistment are not waiverable
     (see Attachment 2).
     3.15.4.2. Separation for Other Reasons. Separation or discharge of a member for other
     reasons is permissible in certain cases in which there are extenuating factors. Not all
     cases of fraudulent enlistment fall into a like category and, accordingly, do not require
     like disposition. It will be found that some members, although meriting a waiver, cannot
     be retained in the service for various reasons. The fact that separation or discharge must
     be effected should not preclude waiver of the fraud and separation or discharge on
     another basis, if the member's enlistment motives and military record justify such action.
     Approval of separation or discharge for another reason constitutes waiver of the fraud.
     3.15.4.3. Waivers. The discharge authority may waive separation or discharge for
     fraudulent enlistment when the reason is evident that the member is a good risk, and
     retention will serve the best interest of the Air Force, provided the enlistment is not void,
     or a constructive enlistment has occurred. In determining whether to grant a waiver, give
     full consideration to evidence of rehabilitation, satisfactory performance of duties since
     enlistment, and any extenuating circumstances. If the unit commander recommends
     retaining the member, separation or discharge processing is not required if the defect is
     no longer present, or the defect is waiverable and a waiver is obtained from the discharge
     authority.
         3.15.4.3.1. Waiver of The Fraudulent Enlistment. If the discharge authority
         authorizes waiver of the fraudulent enlistment, file a copy of the waiver permanently
         in the member's field personnel record. After waiver, do not take further action with
AFI36-3209 14 APRIL 2005                                                                      77


        respect to the fraudulent enlistment. A waiver serves to validate an enlistment
        although it was fraudulent at inception.
     3.15.4.4. Waiver of Fraudulent Enlistment For Concealment of Prior Service. A waiver
     of fraudulent enlistment for concealment of prior service may be granted a member when
     it is considered that their retention is in the best interest of the service.
        3.15.4.4.1. Causes for Separation or Discharge. Members will not be subject to
        separation or discharge for fraudulent enlistment due to concealment of prior service
        where:
            3.15.4.4.1.1. The prior service consists of an unterminated enlistment in a
            Reserve component of one of the other Armed Forces, provided that the person
            has not received orders from the service concerned, prior to enlistment in the Air
            Force Reserve, to report for active military service or to report for medical
            examination in preparation for their entry on active duty.
            3.15.4.4.1.2. The prior service concealed was not the last period of service and
            the last period of service was disclosed, the last period of service was honorable,
            and the individual served in this last enlistment for a minimum of 2 years
            3.15.4.4.1.3. The prior service was terminated under conditions which, if made
            known to the recruiting authorities upon enlistment would not preclude enlistment
            under instructions in effect at time of enlistment.
        3.15.4.4.2. Recommended Waiver, Separation, or Discharge. When the unit
        commander recommends a waiver of separation or discharge, and retention of the
        member is appropriate, or considers separation or discharge more appropriate for a
        reason which does not permit discharge UOTHC, the unit commander forwards the
        recommendation in the form of a detailed and documented report through channels to
        the discharge authority. If the discharge authority does not concur in the
        recommended waiver and believes that consideration should be given to the
        separation or discharge of the member for fraudulent enlistment, process the case
        under Chapter 4, Section 4B, for fraudulent enlistment.
     3.15.4.5. Concealed Acts. As a rule, do not grant waivers to members who conceal acts
     involving moral turpitude, whether or not such acts have been the subject of civil
     convictions, regardless of the maximum punishment imposed for the particular offense.
     3.15.4.6. Constructive Waiver for Fraudulent Entry or Erroneous Enlistment. If a
     commander has the facts of the case indicating possible fraud or error and fails to act, the
     member may become the recipient of a constructive waiver. Failure to exercise the
     option to discharge when the facts are known tends to show intent to retain the member.
     The mere passage of time, standing alone, is not sufficient for a constructive waiver.
     There must be other acts in conjunction with the passage of time which reflect the intent
     to retain the member, such as promotion or reassignment. The determination as to
     whether or not there is a constructive waiver must be made by the commander having the
     express waiver authority, not by a discharge board or other authority although they may
     make recommendations. Where discharge action has been initiated, the passing of time is
     immaterial to the issue of whether a constructive waiver has resulted.
78                                                                AFI36-3209 14 APRIL 2005


     3.15.4.7. Concealment Of Civil Court Records. Members are subject to separation or
     discharge for fraudulent enlistment if, upon enlistment, they concealed a civil court
     conviction of:
        3.15.4.7.1. An offense for which a punitive discharge would be authorized for the
        same or a closely related offense under the UCMJ.
        3.15.4.7.2. An offense for which the sentence imposed by the civil court included
        confinement for 6 months or more, without regard to suspension or probation; or if an
        offense involved moral turpitude.
     3.15.4.8. Concealment of Prior Service. Separate or discharge for fraudulent enlistment
     under either of the following circumstances:
        3.15.4.8.1. Members who, upon enlistment, concealed a record of prior service in an
        armed force of the US which would have made them ineligible for enlistment under
        directives in effect at the time of enlistment.
        3.15.4.8.2. Members who willfully concealed any facts, circumstances, or conditions
        regarding prior service which would have made them ineligible for enlistment.
     3.15.4.9. Concealment of Alienage and Aliens Erroneously Enlisted. Discharge
     members who fraudulently enlisted by willfully misrepresenting that they were a US
     citizens. However, an alien who claimed US citizenship at time of enlistment in the
     honest belief that they were a citizen, or who did not misrepresent their nationality, but
     were erroneously accepted for enlistment contrary to current instructions, will not be
     separated for fraudulent enlistment. In cases of this type, the member may be separated
     because of erroneous enlistment or retained in the service.
        3.15.4.9.1. The appropriate authority reports cases of concealment of alienage and
        aliens erroneously enlisted to the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) under
        procedures of AFI 36-3202. If the unit commander recommends a waiver of
        separation or discharge, take no further action until the INS completes its action. An
        alien not deported or interned by INS could continue to serve in the Air Force, with
        an approved waiver. If INS does not want custody of the member, the appropriate
        authority proceeds with separation or discharge or waiver action, notifying INS of the
        discharge if required under AFI 36-3202. Report cases which also involve inability to
        locate the member to the State Department under AFI 36-3202.
     3.15.4.10. Other Fraudulent Enlistments. Except as provided in paragraphs 3.15.4.10.1
     and 3.15.4.10.3, a member may be discharged for fraudulent enlistment, although the
     specific fraud committed upon enlistment is not mentioned in this section if, upon request
     by the recruiting authorities for pertinent information, or otherwise (including a request to
     fill out forms), a member deliberately misrepresented, omitted, or concealed any material
     fact, circumstance, or condition which, if known at the time, might have resulted in
     rejection.
        3.15.4.10.1. A waiver of such fraudulent enlistment may be granted when the action
        is considered to be in the best interest of the service.
AFI36-3209 14 APRIL 2005                                                                        79


           3.15.4.10.2. The unit commander determines whether to process for discharge a
           member subject to separation or discharge under this section or to request a waiver.
           If the unit commander recommends processing the case as a fraudulent enlistment,
           the unit commander prepares the commander's report (Attachment 6) and refers the
           documented case through channels to the discharge authority. The unit commander
           states whether the member has been promised or led, by implication or representation,
           to believe that the discharge to be issued would be better than the worst authorized.
           Final action by the official authorized to direct the execution of an approved
           discharge for fraudulent entry constitutes the Air Force administrative determination
           of the existence of a fraudulent enlistment. The option to discharge for fraud
           administratively does not preclude action under the UCMJ or state military code
           based on the fraudulent entry or other violations.
3.16. Entry Level Performance and Conduct. Separate a member while in entry level status
(defined in Attachment 1) when it is determined that the member is unqualified for further
military service by reason of unsatisfactory performance or conduct (or both), as evidenced by
inability, lack of reasonable effort, failure to adapt to the military environment, or minor
disciplinary infractions. Eligibility for discharge under this section does not preclude separation
or discharge for another reason when the separation or discharge is authorized and warranted by
the circumstances of the case. When separation or discharge of a member in entry level status is
warranted by unsatisfactory performance or minor disciplinary infractions (or both), the member
normally should be separated under this section. A member may be separated under this section
only when the separation or discharge processing starts while the member is in entry level status.
Members enlisted in the DEP may be involuntarily separated under this provision if they become
disqualified for enlistment in the Regular Air Force for any reason, or refuse or fail to enlist in
the Regular Air Force, or enter active duty at the time and place designated. The character of
separation or discharge will be entry level separation or discharge. The notification procedures
of Chapter 4, Section 4B shall be used. The unit commander will prepare a letter to the
discharge authority to include the information in Attachment 6. Do not initiate separation or
discharge processing until the member receives formal counseling concerning deficiencies.
Counseling requirements are important with respect to this reason for separation or discharge.
Because military service is a calling different from any civilian occupation, do not separate a
member when this is the sole reason, unless there have been efforts at rehabilitation.
Unsatisfactory entry level performance or conduct may be shown in a number of ways including,
but not limited to:
   3.16.1. Lack of aptitude for military service.
   3.16.2. Failure to adapt to the military environment.
   3.16.3. Failure to report for scheduled IADT within 365 days of enlistment. NOTE: If the
   member fails to report for scheduled IADT within 365 days of enlistment, do to no fault of
   their own, it will be reflected as a voluntary separation and not involuntary.
   3.16.4. Failure to make satisfactory progress in a required training program
   3.16.5. Reluctance to make the effort necessary to meet Air Force standards of conduct and
   duty performance.
   3.16.6. Lack of self discipline.
 80                                                                 AFI36-3209 14 APRIL 2005


   3.16.7. Minor disciplinary infractions.
3.17. Excess or Overgrade Assigned Members. This paragraph applies to the ANG only.
Members who become excess or overgrade to a unit's organizational requirement as defined in
ANGI 36-2101, Assignments Within the Air National Guard, may be separated or discharged
under this authority. Retainability requirements of ANGI 36-2101 must be adhered to.
3.18. Substandard (Unsatisfactory) Performance. Process members who fail to meet Air
Force standards of performance or conduct for discharge as prescribed. If a member's discharge
is contemplated because of acts not related to causes listed in this section, or may warrant
consideration of separation or discharge for misconduct, do not discharge the member for
substandard performance, but process under another section.             Unit commanders will
continuously screen personnel for early identification of substandard performance and
recommend discharge action when appropriate. A member may be discharged when it is
determined that the member is unqualified for further military service due to substandard
performance. This reason shall not be used if the member is in entry level status. Service will be
characterized as Honorable, unless the military record warrants characterization as Under
Honorable Conditions (General) under guidance in Attachment 2. The fact that the member is
being discharged for substandard performance does not, in itself, warrant characterization as
General. The notification procedures shall be used unless the member is otherwise board entitled
(refer to 4.10). Discharge processing may not be initiated until the member has been counseled
formally concerning deficiencies and has been afforded an opportunity to overcome those
deficiencies. Counseling requirements are of particular importance with respect to this reason
for discharge. Because military service is a calling different from any civilian occupation, a
member should not be discharged when substandard performance is the sole reason, unless there
have been efforts at rehabilitation. One or more of the following may be used as the basis for
discharge under this paragraph:
   3.18.1. Substandard Duty Performance:
       3.18.1.1. Failure to perform assigned duties properly.
       3.18.1.2. A progressively downward trend in performance ratings.
       3.18.1.3. Failure to demonstrate the qualities of leadership required by the member's
       grade.
   3.18.2. Standards. Failure to maintain standards of dress and personal appearance (other
   than weight and fitness) or military deportment see AFI 36-2903, Dress and Personal
   Appearance of Personnel.
   3.18.3. On-the-Job Training (OJT). Failure to progress in OJT.
   3.18.4. Personal Finances. Irresponsibility in the management of personal finances.
   3.18.5. Unsanitary Habits. Unsanitary habits such as:
       3.18.5.1. Repeated infection of venereal disease.
       3.18.5.2. Persistent refusal to bathe, and similar refusals to observe personal hygiene.
   3.18.6. Job Skill Proficiency. Failure to attain or maintain required job skill proficiency,
   either by associated inaptitude or non-application.
AFI36-3209 14 APRIL 2005                                                                      81


   3.18.7. Readiness. Performance which does not contribute to unit readiness and mission
   accomplishment, as specifically evidenced by below average performance, or specific
   demonstrated incapacity to meet performance standards.
   3.18.8. Body Fat Standards. Members may be discharged who exceed the body fat standards
   of AFI 40-502, The Weight Management Program, when such is not due to physical or
   organic disease causes beyond their control.
   3.18.9. Fitness. Failure to meet minimum fitness standards. Members who fail to meet
   minimum standards of fitness for reasons not amounting to disability may be discharged
   IAW AFI 40-501, The Air Force Fitness Program.
   3.18.10. School Requirement. Failure to complete a mandatory technical school requirement
   which was a condition of enlistment or assignment action. A member who fails to complete
   or is eliminated from training will be discharged from the state ANG and as a Reserve of the
   Air Force. If the member has at least a 3-skill level in an AFSC authorized on the UMD, use
   command discretion to assign member to this authorization.
3.19. Drug or Alcohol Abuse Rehabilitation Failure. Members who are in a program for
personal alcohol or drug abuse may be discharged for failure through inability or refusal to
participate in, cooperate in, or successfully complete such a program in the following
circumstances:
   3.19.1. There is a lack of potential for continued military service
   3.19.2. Long-term treatment is determined necessary and the member is transferred to, or
   receiving treatment in a civilian medical facility.
   3.19.3. Nothing in this provision precludes separation or discharge of a member who has
   been referred to such a program under any other provision of this instruction in appropriate
   cases.
   3.19.4. Advise members before referral to a civilian rehabilitation program, that any incurred
   expenses will be their responsibility without obligation to the ANG, AFRC, or ARPC.
   3.19.5. If an Administrative Discharge Board is requested, the Board will review the
   evidence, make a finding of either alcohol or drug abuse rehabilitation failure and determine
   the characterization of service, which should either be Honorable or Under Honorable
   Conditions (General), except when guidelines require an entry level separation or discharge.
   Nothing in this section precludes separation or discharge of a member referred to a treatment
   program under any other section of this instruction when appropriate. Report alcohol abuse
   failures separately from drug abuse failures. When separation or discharge is considered
   appropriate due to evidence of alcohol abuse, the unit commander:
       3.19.5.1. Reviews the action taken according to AFI 36-2701 or ANGR 30-2 and ensures
       that every effort has been made to rehabilitate the member. Recommends whether to
       separate the member for drug or alcohol abuse failure, or for another reason (for example,
       illegal activity in connection with drugs may be a basis for discharge for misconduct,
       deteriorating duty performance associated with alcohol abuse may warrant separation or
       discharge for substandard performance).
 82                                                                 AFI36-3209 14 APRIL 2005


       3.19.5.2. Prepares a letter to the discharge authority to include:
       3.19.5.3. A history of the member's drug or alcohol abuse, including details of how the
       abuse was determined, following guidance of AFI 36-2701 or ANGR 30-2.
       3.19.5.4. A summary of the rehabilitation efforts with a complete explanation of how
       criteria for this basis for separation or discharge are met.
       3.19.5.5. A resume of the military record.
3.20. (DELETED)
3.21. Misconduct. A member may be separated for misconduct by reason of one or more of
the reasons listed in this section. Characterization of service normally shall be UOTHC, but
characterization as Under Honorable Conditions (General) may be warranted. For respondents
who have completed entry-level status, do not authorize characterization of service as Honorable
unless the member's record is otherwise so meritorious that any other characterization clearly
would be inappropriate, and the separation or discharge is approved by the discharge authority.
For members in entry-level status, if characterization of service as UOTHC is not warranted,
describe the separation or discharge as an entry-level separation or discharge. Explanation of
limitations on using evidence of drug abuse in characterizing service are explained in
Attachment 2. The notification procedures of Chapter 4, Section B, apply. However, use the
Administrative Discharge Board procedures of Chapter 4, Section D, if recommending the
member for a discharge UOTHC in the letter of notification, or if the member has a total of 6 or
more years of active and reserve military service, or if the member is a noncommissioned officer
(does not apply to ANG). Do not initiate separation or discharge processing for a pattern of
misconduct or minor disciplinary infractions until the member receives formal counseling
concerning deficiencies and is afforded an opportunity to overcome those deficiencies. Include
counseling and results in the case file. Counseling is not appropriate if the sole basis of
separation or discharge is a serious offense or civilian conviction, or a similar juvenile
adjudication.
   3.21.1. Minor Disciplinary Infractions. A pattern of misconduct consisting solely of minor
   disciplinary infractions. The infraction contemplated under this section may involve failure
   to comply with non-punitive instructions or minor offenses under the UCMJ or state military
   code. If this is the sole reason for separation or discharge of a member in entry-level status,
   process the action under Entry Level Performance and Conduct per paragraph 3.16.
   3.21.2. A Pattern of Misconduct. A pattern of misconduct consisting wholly, or in part, of
   misconduct more serious than that considered under Substandard Performance. Cite specific
   patterns of misconduct in separation or discharge cases. Use paragraph 4.4 when using more
   than one reason. The pattern may consist of:
       3.21.2.1. Discreditable involvement with military or civil authorities. Acts for which the
       member was or might have been punished under the UCMJ or state military code may be
       part of the pattern. The lack of UCMJ or state military code jurisdiction over the offense
       is irrelevant. Civil offenses, which in themselves are not a basis for discharge for civil
       conviction, may be cited to show the pattern of misconduct.
AFI36-3209 14 APRIL 2005                                                                    83


     3.21.2.2. Conduct prejudicial to good order and discipline. This includes conduct of a
     nature which tends to disrupt order, discipline, or morale within the military community.
     Normally, this category of misconduct involves causing dissent, disruption, and
     degradation of mission effectiveness. It also includes conduct of a nature which tends to
     bring discredit on the service in the view of the civilian community.
     3.21.2.3. Failure to support dependents. An established pattern showing failure to
     contribute adequate support to dependents or failure to comply with orders, decrees, or
     judgments of a civil court concerning support of dependents.
     3.21.2.4. Failure to meet financial obligations. An established pattern showing failure to
     pay just debts. This includes dishonorable failure to make timely payments on the
     Government American Express Travel Card. Dishonor is presumed when the member
     fails to make any payments for a period of 120 or more consecutive days, or when the
     member fails to keep any promise for payment specifically made on any debt. The
     member may rebut the presumption through the introduction of competent and relevant
     evidence.
  3.21.3. Commission of Serious Offense. Discharge under this section is authorized if the
  specific circumstances of the offense warrant separation or discharge and a punitive
  discharge would be authorized for the same or a closely related offense under the UCMJ or
  state military code. Offenses serious enough to warrant consideration under this section
  include, but are not limited to the following:
     3.21.3.1. Sexual Deviation. Members are subject to discharge for misconduct based on
     an act, or acts, of sexual deviation including, but not limited to:
         3.21.3.1.1. A lewd or lascivious act.
         3.21.3.1.2. Indecent exposure.
         3.21.3.1.3. Indecent act with, or assault upon a child under 16.
         3.21.3.1.4. Transvestitism or other aberrant sexual behavior.
         3.21.3.1.5. Any other indecent act or offense.
     3.21.3.2. Drug Abuse. Process members for discharge for misconduct based on drug
     abuse. Since drug abuse is not compatible with Air Force standards, it's essential that
     careful consideration be given when deciding whether to rehabilitate or retain members
     who are verified drug abusers in the Air Force.
         3.21.3.2.1. Commanders must act promptly when they have information indicating a
         member is subject to discharge for drug abuse. They evaluate the specific
         circumstances of the offense, the member's records, and the member's potential for
         future service and take action IAW paragraphs 3.21.3.2.2 and 3.21.3.2.3.
         3.21.3.2.2. If the commander determines discharge action is warranted, discharge
         action must be initiated promptly. However, there is no time limit for initiating
         discharge action, and failure to do so does not at anytime constitute a constructive
         waiver. Discharge action is waived only if a waiver is expressly approved.
84                                                               AFI36-3209 14 APRIL 2005


         3.21.3.2.3. HQ AFRC only. If the commander determines a waiver of discharge is
         appropriate, a request for waiver must be processed promptly. See paragraph 4.3.3
         for waiver processing procedures.
     3.21.3.3. Misrepresentation. Misrepresentation or omission of material fact in an official
     written or oral statement or document.
     3.21.3.4. Other Serious Offenses. If the offense that makes the member subject to
     discharge under this section is not described in 3.21 through 3.21.3.3, cite this
     subparagraph as the basis of the action.
  3.21.4. Civilian Conviction. Conviction by civil authorities, or action taken which is
  tantamount to a finding of guilty, including similar adjudications in juvenile proceedings,
  when the specific circumstances of the offense warrant discharge and:
     3.21.4.1. A punitive discharge would be authorized for the same or a closely related
     offense under the UCMJ or the sentence by civilian authorities includes confinement for
     6 months or more, without regard to suspension or probation.
     3.21.4.2. The offense involved moral turpitude.
     3.21.4.3. Action "tantamount to a finding of guilty" may occur where, notwithstanding
     the absence of a specific finding of guilty, the court proceeds in a manner that is
     inconsistent with any reasonable hypothesis other than assumed guilt. The most common
     example of this exists where under statutory authority a court or other agency of the
     judicial or legal system (to include a state or county prosecuting attorney in some
     instances) without specific "finding of guilty", and with the consent of the individual,
     proceeds to subject the individual to some form of deprivation or restraint of the person's
     theretofore unfettered liberty for a period of time as a condition to some ultimate official
     act of grace, forgiveness, or dismissal of charges; for example, successful probation in
     return for a clean record; deferred adjudication or some other form of pretrial
     intervention. Where there has been no action taken which is tantamount to a finding of
     guilty; or where action taken which is either tantamount to a finding of guilty, or an
     adjudication of guilty has been set aside under Federal or state laws, the unit commander
     may consider the member for discharge for substandard performance under paragraph
     3.18, for a different misconduct basis under this section, or by direction of the SAF,
     under paragraph 3.23, if otherwise appropriate.
     3.21.4.4. Prompt action by unit commanders is particularly important in cases of civilian
     conviction.
  3.21.5. Appeal of Civil Conviction. Separation or discharge processing may be initiated
  whether or not a member has filed an appeal of a civilian conviction, or has stated an
  intention to do so. Withhold execution of an approved discharge pending outcome of the
  appeal or until the time for appeal has passed, but upon request of the member or upon
  direction of the SAF, the member may be separated prior to final action on the appeal.
     3.21.5.1. If the appeal results in the conviction being set aside, do not discharge the
     member for civilian conviction. If the discharge authority considers discharge warranted
     without awaiting outcome of an appeal, forward the case to Air Force Personnel Council
AFI36-3209 14 APRIL 2005                                                                     85


     for decision of the SAF. In each case referred, an analysis of the situation should be
     furnished. The analysis should include:
         3.21.5.1.1. A complete review of the circumstances.
         3.21.5.1.2. A statement whether it is the conviction or thesentence that is under
         appeal.
         3.21.5.1.3. An indication whether or not the appeal is frivolous or unlikely of
         reversal.
         3.21.5.1.4. The estimated date action on the appeal will be finalized.
         3.21.5.1.5. A considered judgment by those in the best position to assess the validity
         of the appeal.
         3.21.5.1.6. Any other cogent reasons why the case should be treated in an
         exceptional fashion prior to completion of the appellate processes.
     3.21.5.2. The respondent may request execution of the approved discharge while the
     appeal is pending. Make the request in writing and tell how discharge will benefit the
     respondent. It must show that it was made with the advice and assistance of legal
     counsel. The discharge authority asks the staff judge advocate to comment on the
     validity of the reasons given to assess the possibility that the conviction will be
     overturned on appeal. Normally, the request is approved if:
         3.21.5.2.1. There is an indication the respondent will benefit.
         3.21.5.2.2. The conviction is expected to withstand the appeal
         3.21.5.2.3. No other circumstances exist requiring the return to military control of a
         member who is in civil confinement
  3.21.6. Constructive Waiver of Civilian Conviction. A commander must act promptly when
  the commander has information indicating a member is subject to discharge based on civilian
  conviction. The commander should evaluate the specific circumstances of the offense, how
  it occurred, the action of the civilian authority, the member's record, and the member's
  potential for future service. The commander shall coordinate with and obtain a legal opinion
  from the servicing legal office to determine the appropriate disposition of all cases. If the
  commander determines that discharge action is warranted, discharge action should be
  initiated promptly. If the commander determines that retention is appropriate, the
  commander will promptly submit a waiver request to the discharge authority for approval. If
  the discharge authority fails to act promptly, the member may become the recipient of a
  constructive waiver. Failure to exercise the option to discharge when the facts are known
  tends to show intent to retain the member. The mere passage of time, standing alone, is not
  sufficient for a constructive waiver. There must be other acts in conjunction with the passage
  of time which reflects the intent to retain the member, such as promotion or reassignment.
  The determination as to whether or not there is a constructive waiver must be made by the
  discharge authority having the express waiver authority, not by a discharge board or other
  authority, although they may make recommendations. Where discharge action has been
  initiated, the passing of time is immaterial to the issue of whether a constructive waiver has
  resulted.
 86                                                                AFI36-3209 14 APRIL 2005


   3.21.7. Waiver Consideration. Cases often arise which warrant waiver consideration. In
   determining whether to recommend a waiver, give full consideration to the gravity of the
   specific offense involved, the circumstances relating there to, and matters in extenuation.
   Commanders should also review the military record of the member for the period prior to
   commission of the offense (and the member's potential for rehabilitation if the reason for
   discharge action is a pattern of misconduct or minor disciplinary infractions). In cases of
   civilian conviction, the commander determines what disposition was appropriate had the
   offense occurred and been resolved entirely within the Air Force community. If the penalty
   assessed is less than discharge, commanders may recommend a waiver.
3.22. Discharge in the Interest of National Security. A member whose retention is clearly
inconsistent with the interest of national security may be discharged. Discharge action according
to this paragraph is not initiated until all actions required by AFI 31-501 are completed.
   3.22.1. When the member is unable to obtain the level of clearance for an assignment or
   projected duty assignment the characterization of service will be Honorable, Under
   Honorable Conditions (General), or UOTHC under the guidelines provided in Attachment 2.
   If the member is in entry level status, describe the separation or discharge as an entry-level
   separation or discharge. Appropriate authorities must review and ensure members
   recommended for discharge under this section are processed entitled to a hearing by an
   administrative discharge board (Chapter 4, Section 4B). Counseling and rehabilitation
   procedures do not apply.
   3.22.2. The unit commander:
       3.22.2.1. Prepares the commander's report (Attachment 6).
       3.22.2.2. Sends the documented case, through channels, to the appropriate authority.
       The transmittal letter states whether the member has been promised or led, by implication
       or representation, to believe that the discharge to be issued would be better than the worst
       type authorized, and includes evidence of the action required.
3.23. Secretarial Plenary Authority. Without regard to any limitations on separations or
discharges in this instruction or DoD Directive 1332.14, Enlisted Administrative Separations, the
SAF may direct the separation of any enlisted member at any time the SAF determines that such
separation is in the best interests of the Air Force. Authority to make this determination is not
delegated. The characterization of service will be Honorable unless an entry level separation is
required under guidance in Attachment 2. Unit commanders may recommend action under this
section. Air Force Personnel Council obtains and announces the decision of the SAF.
Commanders recommending action under this section must notify the member of the proposed
action and reason for the recommendation, as described in Chapter 4, Section 4B. Give the
member an opportunity to submit a rebuttal with the assistance of military legal counsel, unless
such rights were provided under some other provision of this instruction. Procedures for
requesting an administrative discharge board hearing do not apply.
3.24. Secretary of the Air Force (SAF).
   3.24.1. Cases where SAF approval is required prior to discharge must be referred to the Air
   Force Personnel Council with a legal review attached. These include any case where a
   characterization of UOTHC is recommended.
AFI36-3209 14 APRIL 2005                                                                       87


   3.24.2. Include in the cover correspondence transmitting the documented case file:
       3.24.2.1. A recommendation that the enlisted member be discharged.
       3.24.2.2. The recommended characterization of service.
       3.24.2.3. A recommendation to approve/disapprove lengthy service probation.
   3.24.3. The member may not appear before the SAF, nor be represented by counsel unless
   the SAF determines that the member must be present, with or without counsel, for them to
   properly evaluate the case.
   3.24.4. Follow procedures in paragraph 3.3.1 for enlisted lengthy service cases.
3.25. Probation and Rehabilitation (P&R). Enlisted members approved for discharge under
this chapter, except for the reasons listed below, shall be considered by the discharge authority
for suspension of their discharge for the purposes of receiving P&R. Receipt of P&R may not be
a contingency for making a recommendation for discharge, nor be a condition for acceptance of a
conditional waiver for discharge. Officers may not be considered for P&R.
   3.25.1. Members discharged for the following reasons are not eligible for P&R
   consideration:
       3.25.1.1. Fraudulent entry, paragraph 3.15.4.
       3.25.1.2. Entry level performance and conduct paragraph 3.16.
       3.25.1.3. (DELETED)
       3.25.1.4. Drug Abuse, 3.21.3.2.
       3.25.1.5. Discharge in the interest of national security, paragraph 3.22.
       3.25.1.6. When a member is discharged for multiple reasons, and one of the approved
       reasons for discharge is for one of these listed above, the member is not eligible for P&R.
   3.25.2. Criteria for Suspension of Discharge. Consistent with DoD policy, the ANG and the
   Air Force Reserve should offer enlisted members the opportunity for P&R when it is
   reasonably possible to do so, for example those members:
             Who have demonstrated a potential to serve satisfactorily.
             Who have the capacity to be rehabilitated for continued military service or
              completion of the current enlistment.
             Whose retention in the ANG or Air Force Reserve in a probationary status is
              consistent with the maintenance of good order and discipline.
   3.25.3. Action by the Discharge Authority.          When P&R is appropriate, the discharge
   authority:
       3.25.3.1. Directs the suspension of the execution of the approved discharge contingent
       on the successful completion of the period of rehabilitation.
       3.25.3.2. Sets the period of rehabilitation. This should ordinarily be no less than 6
       months, but may not exceed 12 months, or the enlisted member’s ETS date, whichever is
       earlier.
 88                                                               AFI36-3209 14 APRIL 2005


      3.25.3.3. Establishes any and all conditions or terms to be met while the discharge is
      suspended. These may include, but are limited to, requirements for restitution to victims,
      drug or alcohol rehabilitation, mental health or, financial counseling, etc. The
      requirement not to violate the UCMJ, or the criminal laws of the US or the states and
      territories is presumed.
   3.25.4. Vacation of Suspension. During the period of the suspension, if the member engages
   in conduct which violates any condition or terms required to be met during the suspension
   period, commits any act that would, if committed while on active duty, would be a violation
   of the UCMJ, or commits an act(s) or omission(s) that would subject the member to
   involuntary discharge under this instruction, the discharge authority may consider vacating
   the suspension and ordering execution of the discharge. Vacation of a suspended discharge
   does not affect the commander’s authority to deal with misconduct in other appropriate ways.
      3.25.4.1. The discharge authority initiates the vacation process by written notification to
      the member in which the member is:
          3.25.4.1.1. Told what information has been received that indicates that the vacation
          of the suspension may be appropriate.
          3.25.4.1.2. Given a minimum of 30-calendar days to reply in writing to the discharge
          authority regarding the matter; and
          3.25.4.1.3. Afforded the opportunity to consult military legal counsel, who must be a
          Judge Advocate, to assist in preparation of a reply.
      3.25.4.2. After receiving the member’s reply, or upon the passage of 35 days, including 5
      days presumed mailing time, after the member’s known receipt of notification without
      reply, whichever comes first, the discharge authority obtains a legal review and vacates
      the suspension and orders the discharge executed, or continues the member on P&R. The
      period of suspension for P&R is automatically stayed when the discharge authority
      initiates the vacation process by notification.
      3.25.4.3. Unless the suspension is sooner vacated, the suspension and discharge action
      are automatically remitted at the end of the probationary period. They may be remitted
      earlier if the discharge authority determines that the goal of rehabilitating the member has
      been achieved.
3.26. Dropping Enlisted Members from the Rolls of the Air Force.
   3.26.1. You may drop from the rolls of the Air Force any enlisted member who has been
   found guilty by civil authorities of any offense and finally sentenced to confinement in a
   Federal or state penitentiary or correctional institution or a member who has been sentenced
   by court martial to confinement for more than 6 months without a punitive discharge.
   3.26.2. Under the statutes of some states, sentence to confinement in a county jail may
   constitute confinement in a correctional institution.
   3.26.3. Dropping an enlisted member from the rolls of the Air Force terminates the enlisted
   member’s military status as of 2400 hours on the date specified in the orders.
   3.26.4. The appropriate agency (ANGRC, HQ AFRC, HQ ARPC) publishes orders dropping
   an enlisted member from the rolls of the Air Force. Issue no separation documents.
AFI36-3209 14 APRIL 2005                                                                       89


  3.26.5. The Report. The unit or other commander of an enlisted member who meets the
  criteria of paragraph 3.26.6 forwards a report to the discharge authority. The report must
  include the following information:
     3.26.5.1. If the member received a final sentence to confinement due to civilian
     conviction: Offense or offenses for which convicted.
     3.26.5.2. Sentence received.
     3.26.5.3. Date of final sentence.
     3.26.5.4. Place of confinement, if any.
     3.26.5.5. Text of the statue violated and text of the statue that provides the penalty.
     3.26.5.6. Text of the statue relevant to a determination of whether confinement in a
     county jail can be considered a correctional institution, if applicable.
     3.26.5.7. When possible, a copy of the final judgment or order of the court, certified or
     otherwise properly authenticated, will be included with the commander’s report.
     3.26.5.8. A summary of the circumstances of the misconduct that led to the conviction.
     3.26.5.9. If the member is absent without authority for 3 months or more:
     3.26.5.10. A copy of the member’s active duty orders.
     3.26.5.11. Copies of all administrative actions documenting the member’s away without
     leave (AWOL), or deserter status.
     3.26.5.12. Copies of all available evidence proving the member went AWOL, and when
     this occurred.
     3.26.5.13. A summary of the circumstances surrounding the absence.
     3.26.5.14. An explanation of why return to military control would serve no useful
     purpose.
  3.26.6. Discharge Authority Action. Upon receipt of the case report from the unit
  commander, the discharge authority determines whether to forward the case to the Air Force
  Personnel Council for SAF decision on whether to drop the enlisted member from the rolls of
  the Air Force. If the discharge authority determines to forward the case, he or she takes the
  following actions:
     3.26.6.1. Notify the enlisted member of the proposed action.
     3.26.6.2. Allow the enlisted member a reasonable time to submit comments (normally
     10-calendar days from the enlisted member’s receipt of notice).
     3.26.6.3. Forward the case to Air Force Personnel Council (through, HQ USAF/JAG),
     including the following:
     3.26.6.4. Proof of notice to the enlisted member;

                                           Chapter 4

  NOTIFICATION PROCEDURES AND ADMINISTRATIVE DISCHARGE BOARDS

Section 4A—General Information

4.1. General Instructions. Title 10, U.S.C., Section 12683, generally requires the
recommendation of a board of officers to discharge involuntarily a non-probationary Reserve
officer. Among the exceptions to this general rule are discharge for age or dismissal under Title
10 U.S.C., Section 1161. It also requires the recommendation of a board of officers to discharge
any Reserve member for cause UOTHC, unless the discharge is a result of an approved sentence
of courts-martial, or the member waives the proceedings and consents to discharge Under
Conditions Other Than Honorable.            Administrative discharge board and notification
requirements in this instruction comply with Title 10 U.S.C., Section 12683, and with additional
requirements of DoD and Air Force policy. Use the notification procedures in Section 4B for
involuntary separation cases involving enlisted personnel. Use the notification procedures in
Section 4C for involuntary separation cases involving officers. References in this chapter to the
"respondent" means the member involved. References to the "board" or "discharge board" mean
the administrative discharge board.
   4.1.1. ANG Officers. ANG officers not on active duty are discharged through the
   withdrawal of Federal recognition process in Title 32 U.S.C., Section 323. Withdrawal of
   Federal recognition pursuant to Title 32 U.S.C., Section 323(b) automatically results in
   discharge from Reserve of the Air Force appointment. Discharge boards convened under this
   instruction for ANG officers are withdrawal of Federal recognition boards. The guidance in
   this chapter applies to withdrawal of Federal recognition boards except for paragraphs 4.9
   and 4.10 in this instruction. A probationary officer category is not established by Title 32
   U.S.C., Section 323(b). All ANG officers have a board entitlement for withdrawal of Federal
   recognition under Title 32 U.S.C., Section 323(b). A withdrawal of Federal recognition
   board is a Federal board. At a minimum the recorder, the board members, and the legal
   advisor shall be ordered to duty in a Title 10 status. Withdrawal of Federal recognition is
   accomplished by the Chief, of the National Guard Bureau (CNGB), subject to approval of the
   SAF in cases where Chapter 4 of this instruction requires such approval. When the CNGB
   withdraws Federal recognition, CNGB shall concurrently discharge the officer from Reserve
   of the Air Force appointment.
4.2. Action in Lieu of Administrative Discharge Board. Paragraphs 4.10 (enlisted) and 4.12
(officers) explain the eligibility for an administrative discharge board. Don't hold an
administrative discharge board hearing if:
   4.2.1. The enlisted respondent waives a board hearing by failing to respond to the proposed
   action after receipt of notification.
   4.2.2. The enlisted respondent submits a conditional or unconditional waiver which is
   accepted.
   4.2.3. The officer respondent submits an unconditional waiver which is accepted.
   4.2.4. An officer submits a resignation that is approved.
 92                                                                AFI36-3209 14 APRIL 2005


   4.2.5. The respondent applies for, and is approved for transfer to the Retired Reserve.
4.3. Waiver or Conditional Waiver (Enlisted Cases Only). A waiver is a specific statement
made by a respondent waiving those rights associated with administrative discharge board
proceedings. A "conditional waiver" is a statement made by an enlisted respondent waiving
those rights associated with administrative discharge board proceedings and contingent on
receipt of a characterization of service higher than the worst type authorized. A conditional
waiver may only address the characterization of service. EXAMPLES: In a misconduct case,
the worst characterization authorized is UOTHC. The waiver might be contingent on approval
of either an Honorable or a General discharge, as requested by the respondent. In a substandard
performance case, the worst type characterization is General. The waiver would be contingent
on receipt of an Honorable Discharge. Conditional waivers are not accepted from officer
respondents.
   4.3.1. Submission. The respondent submits the waiver or conditional waiver to the
   discharge authority through the chain of command. An information copy of the waiver will
   be provided directly to the discharge authority who should then monitor the progress of the
   request through the chain of command.
   4.3.2. Processing. The discharge authority, under guidance of Attachment 2, and this
   chapter, may:
       4.3.2.1. Reject the conditional waiver and notify the respondent that he or she may
       submit either an unconditional waiver or a request for an administrative discharge board
       hearing or;
       4.3.2.2. Accept the waiver or conditional waiver and approve the appropriate type of
       discharge.
NOTE:
The respondent may submit a written request for withdrawal to the discharge authority. The
request must state the reasons for requesting withdrawal. After review, the discharge authority
may or may not accept the requested withdrawal.
   4.3.3. Waiver of Discharge for Drug Abuse Cases. A member found subject to discharge for
   drug abuse under paragraphs 2.30.3 (officers) or 3.21.3.2 (enlisted) of this instruction in
   Chapter 2 and Chapter 3, may warrant consideration for waiver of discharge. In deciding
   whether a waiver should be recommended, commanders must give full consideration to: the
   nature of the offense involved, all circumstances surrounding the offense, any matters in
   extenuation, the member's military record, and the member's potential for future productive
   service. Consideration must include evaluation of the retention criteria in paragraph 4.14.4.1
   of this chapter The commander must determine that the facts and circumstances of a
   member's case meet the retention criteria in paragraph 4.14.4.1 of this chapter and therefore
   warrant a recommendation for waiver action. A waiver recommendation must be processed
   promptly according to paragraph 4.3.3.1 of this chapter.
AFI36-3209 14 APRIL 2005                                                                        93


       4.3.3.1. A commander who initiates waiver of discharge action sends a recommendation
       to the discharge authority. This provides the commander's reasons for recommending the
       waiver and must include:
          4.3.3.1.1. Evidence substantiating the member's drug abuse; completed disciplinary
          or administrative action taken as a result of the member's drug abuse, e.g., Article 15
          actions, letters of reprimand.
          4.3.3.1.2. Any available investigation report, military or civilian, of the drug
          offenses.
          4.3.3.1.3. The commander's statement explaining how the member meets each of the
          seven retention criteria set forth in paragraph 4.14.4.1.
          4.3.3.1.4. Rehabilitative action taken in the member's case and results.
          4.3.3.1.5. Any other relevant information.
       4.3.3.2. The discharge authority may either approve or disapprove the waiver. If it is
       approved, no further action in the case is required. If it is disapproved, discharge
       processing must commence at once.
4.4. Multiple Reasons for Separation. When the recommendation for separation or discharge
is based on more than one reason, the following procedures apply:
   4.4.1. If any of the reasons for separation or discharge require an administrative discharge
   board, process the entire matter under paragraph 4.10 (enlisted) and 4.12 (officers).
   4.4.2. If the discharge authority approved more than one reason for separation or discharge,
   apply the guidance on characterization that provides the greatest latitude to the discharge
   authority.
   4.4.3. When a specific requirement for one reason clearly conflicts with a general
   requirement for another reason, apply the specific requirement.
   4.4.4. If the discharge authority can't resolve a conflict in procedures under the guidelines of
   4.4.1 through 4.4.3, use the procedure most favorable to the respondent.
4.5. Delivery of the Letter of Notification (LON).
   4.5.1. When feasible the LON should be personally delivered to the member. The delivering
   official obtains a written acknowledgment of receipt of the letter. If the member refuses to
   acknowledge receipt, the delivering official makes an annotation to that effect on the receipt,
   including date and approximate time of actual delivery of the LON. The receipt will be
   placed in the case file.
   4.5.2. When personal delivery is not feasible, the LON is sent to the member by registered or
   certified mail, return receipt requested, to the member's last known address. The LON is also
   sent by first class mail when attempts to deliver the LON by registered or certified mail are
   unsuccessful. An equivalent form of notice may be used if such service by US mail is not
   available for delivery to an address outside the US.
   4.5.3. If the postal service returns the letter without indicating a more current address, file
   the returned envelope with the Affidavit of Service by Mail (Attachment 10) in the case file.
   Also, consider use of procedures for locating the respondent and documenting your efforts at
 94                                                                   AFI36-3209 14 APRIL 2005


   delivery found in paragraphs 2.14 and 3.13.6. (Inability to Locate) of this instruction. If a
   returned envelope discloses a more current address, remail the LON to the member at that
   address as set forth in paragraph 4.5.2.
4.6. Failure or Declination To Respond. If the respondent fails to acknowledge receipt of the
LON, fails to submit a reply within 15 days (30 days if the commander or discharge authority
knows the respondent is in civil confinement) after receipt of the LON, or declines to respond
about the selection of rights, that failure or declination constitutes a waiver of all rights,
including the right to a board hearing, except for officers who must affirmatively waive their
right to a board hearing. An appropriate notation is included in the case file. If the member
exercises one or more rights, but declines to sign the form letter, afford the member the rights
elected; rights not elected are waived. If the member fails to acknowledge receipt of the LON
sent by mail, then an affidavit receipt (Attachment 10) will be prepared and placed in the case
file.
4.7. Processing Time Goals. Once the recommendation for separation or discharge is made, it
is usually in the best interest of both the respondent and the Air Force to process the cases as
expeditiously as possible. Commanders should monitor the effectiveness of separation or
discharge programs under their control to ensure that cases are processed without undue delay.
ANG only. Officer cases not presented to an administrative discharge board within 60 days of
receipt of the convening orders must be reported to ANGRC/MPPAS. Notification will include
information explaining the reason(s) for the delay.

Section 4B—Rights of Enlisted Personnel in Separation Cases

4.8. General Instructions. Notification procedures in paragraphs 4.9 and 4.10 apply in cases of
involuntary separation of enlisted personnel. Notify the respondent in writing of matters
required in this section. See paragraph 4.5 for LON delivery instructions.
4.9. LON for Enlisted Personnel, Non-Board Eligible. When the commander or discharge

       nature of the reasons.
       4.9.1.3. Whether the commander or discharge authority is recommending separation or

  further notice to the respondent.

notification is UOTHC. Additionally, a respondent who is a noncommissioned officer (does not
apply to ANG) or has 6 or more years of satisfactory service for retirement must be offered an

   will result in the case being processed based on the information available, and without further
   notice to the respondent.
4.12. LON for Officers - Board Eligible.
   4.12.1. The following officers are eligible for an administrative discharge board hearing:
      4.12.1.1. A Reserve officer who has completed 5 or more years of service as a
      commissioned officer in any of the armed forces as determined from the TFCSD.
      4.12.1.2. A probationary officer when the recommended characterization of service
      contained in the letter of notification is UOTHC.
      4.12.1.3. All ANG officers regardless of years of service.
100                                                                AFI36-3209 14 APRIL 2005


  4.12.2. All rights listed in this paragraph apply regarding administrative discharge board
  hearings of cases involving physical disqualification and inability to locate except the right to
  appear in person, to have counsel appear on respondent's behalf, or to have witnesses appear
  before the board. When the commander or discharge authority determines that grounds exist
  to warrant initiation of separation action against a member, the commander or discharge
  authority or a designated representative prepares a LON to the officer. The LON includes:
      4.12.2.1. Notification that the commander or discharge authority is initiating action,
      with:
         4.12.2.1.1. A statement whether the action could result in separation or discharge and
         the types of characterization that may be used.
         4.12.2.1.2. A description of all reasons for such action, to include identification of
         the appropriate paragraphs of this instruction covering each reason. The statement of
         reasons is not required to have the legal precision of courts-martial specifications; it is
         sufficient if the reasons are described in such terms that the member is fairly apprised
         of the factual nature of the reasons.
         4.12.2.1.3. The types of separation and characterization that may be issued
         4.12.2.1.4. Whether the commander or discharge authority is recommending
         separation or discharge and the characterization of service being recommended.
         4.12.2.1.5. When there is evidence that the respondents have received advanced
         educational assistance moneys or special pay or bonuses, a statement notifying the
         respondents that they may be required to repay the US for these moneys under the
         authority of Title 10 U.S.C., Section 2005.
         4.12.2.1.6. Copies of all supporting documents. See paragraph 1.11 for restrictions
         on release of certain types of information.
      4.12.2.2. An explanation of the respondent's right to consult with military legal counsel
      who must be a Judge Advocate qualified under Article 27(b)(1) of the UCMJ. Include
      the name, address, and telephone number of military legal counsel in the letter. The
      respondent also may consult civilian counsel, retained at the member's own expense, or
      request military legal counsel of respondent's choice if such counsel is serving in active
      status or on active duty in any branch of the armed forces of the US and is reasonably
      available according to AFI 51-201. Non-lawyer counsel may not represent a respondent
      before a board unless, the respondent expressly declines appointment of counsel qualified
      under Article 27(b)(1) of the UCMJ and requests specific non-lawyer counsel, or the
      discharge authority assigns the non-lawyer counsel as assistant counsel.
      4.12.2.3. A statement of the respondent's right, at any time, to submit any statements or
      documents to be considered in disposition of the case.
      4.12.2.4. An explanation that the respondent may waive the rights set forth in paragraphs
      4.12.2.2 and 4.12.2.3 as well as the right to an administrative board hearing, after having
      the opportunity to consult with counsel. Also, include a statement that within 15 days (30
      days if the commander or discharge authority knows the respondent is in civilian
      confinement) after receipt of the LON, respondent must return an attachment showing a
      decision on each of the rights set forth in paragraphs 4.12.2.2 and 4.12.2.3. If the member
AFI36-3209 14 APRIL 2005                                                                   101


     is known to be in civilian confinement, indicate that the administrative discharge board
     will proceed in the member's absence and that the member's legal counsel may present
     the case on the member's behalf. The respondent or counsel must sign the attachment.
     To effectively waive their right to a board hearing the respondents must mark on the
     attachment in the appropriate location, or execute a separate written statement, that they
     desire to waive their right to a discharge board. The respondents must also sign the
     attachment or written statement for their board waiver to be effective.
     4.12.2.5. A statement that the member will execute and return within 24 hours of receipt
     an attached acknowledgment of receipt of the LON and attachments.
     4.12.2.6. A statement that the commander or discharge authority will consider granting
     an extension of the time to reply if additional time is needed by respondent or counsel.
     Respondent or counsel must submit a written request for such delay, stating the reason
     and how much time is needed. The decision whether to grant the additional time is
     discretionary with the commander or discharge authority.
     4.12.2.7. A statement that failure to acknowledge receipt or to respond regarding
     selection or rights within 15 days (30 days if the commander or discharge authority
     knows the respondent is in civilian confinement) after receipt of the LON constitutes a
     waiver of the respondent's rights to be personally present and to be represented by
     counsel of the member's choice at an administrative discharge board hearing. As a result,
     an administrative discharge board will consider the case in the absence of the respondent.
     4.12.2.8. A statement that within 15 days (30 days if the commander or discharge
     authority knows the respondent is in civilian confinement) after receipt of the LON, the
     respondent must return an attachment electing certain rights. In addition, a member may
     apply for transfer to the Retired Reserve, in cases in which the member is eligible for
     such transfer, or submit a TOR.
     4.12.2.9. A statement that the member must return an attached form indicating the
     following:
        4.12.2.9.1. Whether the member wants to make a personal appearance before the
        board.
        4.12.2.9.2. Whether the member wants representation by the military legal counsel
        made available.
        4.12.2.9.3. Whether the member wants to be represented by military counsel of the
        member's choice, in which case, member must identify such counsel by name, grade,
        organization, and telephone number.
        4.12.2.9.4. Whether member will be represented by civilian counsel, in which case,
        member will identify such counsel by name, address, and telephone number.
        4.12.2.9.5. Names, addresses, and telephone numbers, if known, of any witnesses
        that the member wants to appear before the board, giving a summary of the expected
        testimony of the witnesses on the issue of separation or characterization, and an
        explanation why written or recorded testimony of the witnesses could not be
        presented to the board hearing for a fair determination of the case.
 102                                                              AFI36-3209 14 APRIL 2005


          4.12.2.9.6. A statement that failure to appear at a scheduled administrative discharge
          board hearing, after the member has indicated intention to make a personal
          appearance at such hearing, will result in the case being heard by the administrative
          board in the absence of the member.
          4.12.2.9.7. A statement that if respondent or counsel needs additional time to prepare
          for or to attend the board hearing, respondent or counsel may submit a written request
          for delay stating the reasons and how much time is needed. The legal advisor for the
          board hearing approves or disapproves the request.

Section 4D—Administrative Discharge Boards

4.13. Special Provisions.
   4.13.1. Discharge authority will not appoint military counsel to officers being processed for
   separation.
   4.13.2. Eligible officer respondents may tender a resignation or apply for transfer to the
   Retired Reserve at any time before the SAF announces the decision in the officer's case.
   Eligible enlisted respondents may apply for transfer to the Retired Reserve at any time before
   the discharge authority approves the findings and recommendations of the board. Subject to
   the respondent's availability and preference, the respondent may appear at the board hearing,
   with or without counsel, or be represented by counsel in respondent's absence.
       4.13.2.1. If respondent makes such a submission prior to the convening of a board,
       suspend further board action. If the resignation or transfer is approved, terminate the
       involuntary separation or discharge. If the resignation or transfer is not approved,
       convene the board.
       4.13.2.2. Once convened, the board continues and completes the hearing unless the
       resignation or transfer is approved before the board hearings finish.
   4.13.3. The military service will not reimburse respondent for expenses incident to the
   appearance or assistance of civilian counsel. The military service will not reimburse
   respondent for any expenses incident to making a personal appearance, except that, upon
   respondent's request, the discharge authority will publish and provide the respondent with
   invitational travel orders with fund citation to enable the respondent to make a personal
   appearance before the board. Such orders must direct that military air transportation be used
   if available and must authorize travel by commercial transportation only when military air
   transportation is not available. Don't authorize any per diem by such orders.
   4.13.4. Respondents as well as the recorder, may conduct an inquiry of voting members of
   the board and may challenge any of them, but only for cause. The challenging party has the
   burden of establishing that the member is not able to participate in a fair and impartial
   hearing.
   4.13.5. The respondent may arrange for the presence at the board hearing of any witness
   whose testimony the respondent considers to be pertinent to the case, or may make written
   request of the recorder to invite any witness to appear, giving a summary of the expected
   testimony of the witnesses on the issue of separation or characterization, and an explanation
   why written or recorded testimony of the witnesses could not be presented to the board
AFI36-3209 14 APRIL 2005                                                                        103


   hearing for a fair determination of the case. The recorder processes requests for witnesses
   IAW the provisions of paragraph 4.16. No authority authorizes payment of the expenses of
   any witness who has not been properly invited by the recorder. The respondent's counsel
   may question any witness who appears at the board hearing.
   4.13.6. At the board hearing, the board advises the respondent of his or her rights under
   Article 31, UCMJ (for ANG, comparable state statute), and that sworn testimony cannot be
   compelled, but that the giving of sworn testimony constitutes a waiver of such rights and
   subjects the respondent to questioning by the recorder and board members. The board also
   advises the respondent that an unsworn statement may be made orally or in writing by the
   respondent, respondent's counsel, or both. A respondent who makes an unsworn statement is
   not subject to questioning by the recorder or board members.
   4.13.7. At the board hearing the respondent or respondent’s counsel may offer any answer,
   deposition, sworn or unsworn statement, certificate, affidavit, stipulation, or other exhibit for
   consideration by the board. The board sees only evidence ruled admissible by the legal
   advisor. Respondent may also submit a written brief concerning any phase of the case and
   respondent or counsel may present argument before the board closes for deliberation. A
   respondent entitled to an administrative discharge board hearing has the rights listed in
   paragraph 4.12, except all members being processed for discharge on a basis of physical
   disqualification or inability to locate, may not appear in person, have counsel appear on their
   behalf, or have witnesses appear before the board.
4.14. Administrative Discharge Boards. The convening authority will appoint boards of
officers as required.
   4.14.1. The order states that the board is appointed by authority of the SAF.
   4.14.2. The recorder is responsible for notifying board members of the time and place of the
   board hearing.
   4.14.3. Convening authorities must ensure that women and minorities have the opportunity
   to serve on discharge boards. However, appointment or failure to appoint a member of such
   group to the board does not provide a basis for challenging the proceeding.
      4.14.3.1. The voting membership of the board consists of at least three experienced
      commissioned officers (or noncommissioned officers at the option of the convening
      authority) in the rank indicated in paragraph 4.14.3.2. All commissioned voting board
      members must have at least 3 years of commissioned service. All voting members must
      be present at all open sessions and during closed session deliberations concerning
      findings and recommendations.
      4.14.3.2. If the respondent is an officer, all voting members must be at least Colonel (06)
      and senior in grade to the respondent, and at least one of the officers must be a member
      of the Air Reserve Component. If the respondents are an enlisted member and they wish
      to have NCOs on the board, they must make this request in writing to the convening
      authority. Enlisted board members must be in the grade of Master Sergeant (E-7) or
      above, be senior to the respondent, and at least one voting member must be in the grade
      of Major (04) or higher, and a majority shall be commissioned officers. Nothing in this
      paragraph should be construed to give an enlisted respondent the right to have enlisted
104                                                               AFI36-3209 14 APRIL 2005


      members appointed to their discharge boards. The senior member shall be the president
      of the board.
      4.14.3.3. The legal advisor is detailed to serve without vote. These also apply:
         4.14.3.3.1. In officer cases, the legal advisor must be at least a field grade judge
         advocate. If the respondent is a judge advocate, the legal advisor must be senior in
         grade to the respondent.
         4.14.3.3.2. In enlisted member's cases, the legal advisor must be a judge advocate.
      4.14.3.4. The recorder is detailed to serve without vote. These criteria apply:
         4.14.3.4.1. In officer cases, the recorder must be at least a field grade officer,
         preferably a judge advocate, or a judge advocate of any grade.
         4.14.3.4.2. In enlisted member's cases, the recorder must be a commissioned officer,
         preferably a judge advocate.
      4.14.3.5. Standing Physical Disqualification Review Boards (PDRBs) (HQ ARPC Only)
      PDRBs are convened in physical disqualification cases involving non-duty related
      impairment or condition. They are convened for the purpose of making findings and
      recommendations to the discharge authority about a reserve members continued fitness
      for duty after members have received a medical determination that they are physically
      disqualified for military duty. This requires consideration of the member’s ability to
      perform in their current position or any other possible assignments. Review of personnel,
      medical records and any other documents relating to the member’s capability to perform
      assigned military duties should be reviewed in making fitness determinations.
         4.14.3.5.1. Composition of PDRBs. For non-unit assigned personnel, the board
         members must include officers from ARPC/SG and ARPC/JA. For unit assigned
         personnel, the board members must include officers from AFRC/SG and AFRC/JA.
         If the respondent is an officer, the members of the PDRB must be in the grade of
         colonel or above. All PDRB members should be senior to the respondent. Nothing in
         this paragraph should be read as precluding the convening authority from appointing
         additional military members to serve as PDRB members, as appropriate.
         4.14.3.5.2. Expert Assistance. PDRBs are authorized to independently request
         technical assistance and advice from personnel or medical experts in making their
         findings and recommendations; however, any opinions the PDRB considers in
         making its decision must be documented in writing, and a copy provided to the
         respondent. The respondent must be given the opportunity to provide a written reply
         to such opinions to the discharge authority. The discharge authority is authorized to,
         based upon those replies, approve the findings and recommendations of the PDRB,
         approve action more favorable to the respondent, or return the case to the PDRB for
         further consideration of their findings and recommendations in light of the replies.
         4.14.3.5.3. Findings and Recommendations. The PDRB will make findings and
         recommendations concerning the following:
             4.14.3.5.3.1. Whether the appropriate surgeon has made a medical determination
             of disqualification;
AFI36-3209 14 APRIL 2005                                                                    105


             4.14.3.5.3.2. Whether the reason for disqualification is authorized by AFI 48-
             123;
             4.14.3.5.3.3. Whether the respondent is fit for duty;
             4.14.3.5.3.4. If the respondent is found not fit for duty, determine if the
             respondent, because of skills or experience, should receive an assignment
             limitation code to be allowed to continue to participate;
             4.14.3.5.3.5. Determine if the respondent is eligible for transfer to an AFSC or
             duty position in which the respondent would be fit for duty;
             4.14.3.5.3.6. If eligible, whether transfer of respondent to another AFSC or duty
             position is appropriate;
             4.14.3.5.3.7. Whether the disqualifying condition, illness, or injury occurred
             incident to service;
             4.14.3.5.3.8. Whether, based upon their other findings and recommendations, the
             respondent should be discharged; and
             4.14.3.5.3.9. If the evidence is provided that the respondent received advanced
             educational assistance moneys or special pay or bonuses from the Air Force,
             whether recoupment is authorized under Title 10 U.S.C., Section 2005 and
             whether the respondent should be required to repay the US all or any of the
             authorized recoupment amount if the respondent is discharged.
  4.14.4. The policy for retention criteria and consideration for drug abuse cases:
     4.14.4.1. A member found to have abused drugs will be discharged unless the member
     meets all seven of the following criteria:
         4.14.4.1.1. Drug abuse is a departure from the member’s usual and customary
         behavior, and
         4.14.4.1.2. Drug abuse occurred as a result of drug experimentation (a drug
         experimenter is defined as one who has illegally or improperly used a drug for
         reasons of curiosity, peer pressure, or other similar reasons), and
         4.14.4.1.3. Drug abuse does not involve recurring incidents, other than drug
         experimentation as defined above, and
         4.14.4.1.4. The member does not desire to engage in or intend to engage in drug
         abuse in the future, and
         4.14.4.1.5. Drug abuse under all circumstances is not likely to recur, and
         4.14.4.1.6. Under the particular circumstances of the case, the member’s continued
         presence in the Air Force Reserve or ANG is consistent with the interest of the Air
         Force or ANG in maintaining proper discipline, good order, leadership, and morale
         (officers and noncommissioned officers have special responsibilities by virtue of their
         status; fulfill an integral role in maintaining discipline; and therefore, must exhibit
         high standards of personal integrity, loyalty, dedication, devotion to duty and
         leadership), and
 106                                                               AFI36-3209 14 APRIL 2005


          4.14.4.1.7. Drug abuse did not involve drug distribution. For the purpose of this
          paragraph, drug distribution means the delivery to the possession of another.
          Distribution does not occur with the transfer of one or more drugs from one person to
          another while such persons are engaged in the mutual use of drugs, except that
          individuals who obtain or arrange forobtaining one or more drugs used by others are
          involved in distribution. “Delivery” means the actual, constructive, or attempted
          transfer of one or more drugs, whether or not there exists an agency relationship.
       4.14.4.2. The burden of proving that retention is warranted under these limited
       circumstances rests with the member. Findings based on a preponderance of evidence,
       regarding the existence of each of the limited circumstances warranting a member's
       retention are required of the board or the separation authority only if:
          4.14.4.2.1. The member clearly and specifically raises such limited circumstances, or
          4.14.4.2.2. The board, or in the absence of a board, the separation authority relies
          upon such circumstances to justify the member's retention.
4.15. Functions and Duties.
   4.15.1. The functions and duties of an administrative discharge board are purely
   administrative. The board determines its findings and recommendations in closed session
   with only voting members present. Voting members must make clear, logical findings of
   fact, based on the evidence admitted at the board hearing, and then make recommendations
   that are appropriate and consistent with such findings and the provisions of this instruction.
       4.15.1.1. The board must consider each allegation in the LON, but it is not limited in its
       findings to the statement of reasons presented. A new allegation should be added to the
       notification at any time during the board proceedings that it becomes evident that such an
       addition is appropriate. The recorder, as the government's representative, may make the
       request and present the proposed format for the additional allegation or the board, on its
       own motion, may initiate the action and request the recorder to prepare a draft allegation.
       The respondent is entitled to a reasonable delay to prepare a defense to the new
       allegation.
       4.15.1.2. Ordinarily, the board should make its findings and recommendations on the
       basis of the matters presented at the board hearing. If the board determines that
       additional information is essential for proper evaluation of the cases, it directs the
       recorder to obtain such additional information, unless the legal advisor determines that
       additional information would not be admissible or appropriate.
   4.15.2. The president presides during deliberations on findings and recommendations and
   announces such findings and recommendations.
   4.15.3. The legal advisor ensures the board conducts an orderly, fair, and impartial hearing.
       4.15.3.1. The legal advisor:
          4.15.3.1.1. Rules on all matters of evidence procedure and challenges, except
          challenges to the legal advisor.
          4.15.3.1.2. Has no authority to dismiss any allegation against a respondent or to
          terminate the proceedings.
AFI36-3209 14 APRIL 2005                                                                       107


         4.15.3.1.3. At the outset of the proceedings and prior to the board's closing to make
         its findings and recommendations, briefs the voting members, in open session, on
         their duties and responsibilities.
         4.15.3.1.4. Guides the board any time they ask for guidance or it appears appropriate.
     4.15.3.2. The legal advisor may convene a session at any time without the voting
     members present to assist in clarifying issues or to hear argument on challenges to the
     voting members’ objections, motions, or requested instructions that might prejudice an
     orderly, fair, and impartial hearing or result in undue delay, if conducted in open session.
     4.15.3.3. The legal advisor is not a prosecutor and should not behave like one. This rule
     does not preclude the legal advisor from questioning any witness, including the
     respondent if the respondent elects to testify.
     4.15.3.4. In making rulings, the legal advisor is not bound by the strict rules of evidence.
     The legal advisor should maintain reasonable bounds of relevancy, materiality, and
     competency.
  4.15.4. The recorder: Prior to the board hearing, the recorder takes the following action:
     4.15.4.1. Reviews the case file to ensure that the respondent was properly notified, and
     the statement of reasons was accurate, and all necessary documentation was included.
     4.15.4.2. Arranges for the attendance at the board hearing of all necessary witnesses
     IAW procedures specified in this instruction and ensures that the respondent or
     respondent's counsel knows about all witnesses scheduled or invited to appear at the
     board hearing.
     4.15.4.3. Ensures that respondent or respondent's counsel and all board members know
     about the time and place of the board hearing, including any changes in the schedule.
     4.15.4.4. A reasonable time in advance of the hearing, gives the respondent or
     respondent's counsel a copy of any records or other documentary material, not previously
     furnished that the recorder proposes to offer in evidence at the board hearing. To
     expedite the board proceedings, the recorder requests of the respondent or respondent's
     counsel permission to review any documents or exhibits to be introduced on behalf of the
     respondent.
     4.15.4.5. Calls to the attention of the legal advisor any matters that might warrant a
     prehearing conference and attends, along with respondent or respondent's counsel, any
     such prehearing conference.
     4.15.4.6. Attempts to bring to the attention of the board and make a matter of record all
     pertinent information favorable as well as unfavorable to the respondent.
     4.15.4.7. Makes other necessary preparations for an orderly and proper board hearing.
     4.15.4.8. The recorder is not a prosecutor and should not act like one. This rule does not
     preclude the recorder from ensuring an adequate presentation of the government's case
     during the board hearing. To this end, the recorder may examine any witnesses called by
     the respondent, including the respondent, if the respondent chooses to testify, may
     present rebuttal witnesses or evidence, and may make a final argument on the basis of all
     evidence submitted at the board hearing.
 108                                                               AFI36-3209 14 APRIL 2005


       4.15.4.9. The recorder ensures that a proper record of the proceedings is made.
   4.15.5. Challenges. The respondent and the recorder may challenge a voting member or the
   legal advisor for cause only. The legal advisor shall rule on all challenges except challenges
   to the legal advisor. The board shall hear evidence on the challenge to the legal advisor and
   then, in closed session, the president shall announce his or her ruling on the challenge. The
   president shall then poll the other voting members to see if they object to the president’s
   ruling, and unless a majority of the voting members object, the president’s ruling shall be
   final. The president shall announce the ruling on the challenge to the legal advisor in open
   session.
4.16. Attendance of Witnesses.
   4.16.1. Criteria. If the respondent submits a timely request for witnesses to be present at the
   board hearing, or if the recorder or board wants to hear certain witnesses, the recorder, with
   the concurrence of the convening authority, invites such witnesses to appear. These criteria
   apply:
       4.16.1.1. The legal advisor, on behalf of the convening authority, may approve
       production of the witness, if the legal advisor finds that:
          4.16.1.1.1. The testimony of a witness is not cumulative.
          4.16.1.1.2. The personal appearance of the witness is essential to a fair determination
          on the issues of separation or characterization.
          4.16.1.1.3. Written or recorded testimony will not adequately accomplish the same
          objective.
          4.16.1.1.4. The need for live testimony is substantial, material, and necessary for a
          proper disposition of the case.
          4.16.1.1.5. The significance of the witness" personal appearance, when balanced
          against the practical difficulties in producing the witness, favors production of the
          witness. Factors to be considered in this balancing test include, but are not limited to:
          4.16.1.1.6. The cost of producing the witness.
          4.16.1.1.7. The timeliness of the request for the witness.
          4.16.1.1.8. The potential delay in the proceeding that absence of the witness may
          cause.
          4.16.1.1.9. The likelihood of significant interference with military operational
          deployment, mission accomplishment, or essential training.
       4.16.1.2. To enable the legal advisor to make these determinations, the party requesting a
       particular witness must submit in writing the name, address, and telephone number, if
       known, of the expected witness, a summary of the expected testimony of the witnesses on
       the issue of separation or characterization, and an explanation why written or recorded
       testimony of the witnesses could not be presented to the board hearing for a fair
       determination of the case.
       4.16.1.3. The recorder determines that the witness is reasonably available under
       guidelines in paragraph 4.16.2.
AFI36-3209 14 APRIL 2005                                                                     109


   4.16.2. Availability. Use the procedures and policies in paragraph 115a of the Manual for
   Courts-Martial as a general guide in determining which witnesses to invite to appear. Use
   Article 49(d), of the UCMJ as a general guide in determining the availability of witnesses.
   The Government authorizes and encourages the use of depositions or affidavits to obtain
   testimony of witnesses who are not reasonably available, and the use of stipulations when
   appropriate.
   4.16.3. Civilians and Members of the Armed Forces Not Serving in the Active Military
   Service. When the appearance of a witness at a board hearing has been approved IAW
   paragraphs 4.16.1 and 4.16.2, the recorder sends invitational travel orders and a letter to
   prospective witnesses per Joint Travel Regulation (JTR), paragraph C6000.
   4.16.4. Members of the Armed Forces in Active Military Service and Civilian Employees of
   Federal Agencies. When the appearance of a witness at a board hearing has been approved
   IAW paragraphs 4.16.1 and 4.16.2, the recorder, on behalf of the board, requests the witness"
   commander or supervisor to make such person available as a witness. Use military
   transportation when practical or commercial means if not. AFI 65-601, Volume 1, or the
   JTR govern travel funding.
   4.16.5. Delays in Proceedings Concerning Witnesses. If the legal advisor determines that
   the board requires a witness" personal testimony, the board may postpone the hearing if
   necessary to permit the witness to attend. Likewise, the board may postpone the hearing if
   necessary, to provide the respondent a reasonable opportunity to obtain a written statement
   from an unavailable witness requested by the respondent, when:
      4.16.5.1. The legal advisor has determined that the board need not hear personal
      testimony of the requested witness; or
      4.16.5.2. The commander of a military witness has determined that military necessity
      precludes the witness" attendance at the hearing; or
      4.16.5.3. A civilian witness has declined to attend the hearing. (A Federal employee
      may not decline to appear as a witness, if directed to do so IAW applicable procedures of
      the employing agency.)
4.17. Findings and Recommendations. The board determines its findings and
recommendations in closed session with only voting members present. The board acts on the
following matters:
   4.17.1. The board determines whether a preponderance of evidence supports each allegation
   set forth in the notice of proposed separation.
   4.17.2. The board then determines whether the findings warrant separation or discharge with
   respect to the basis for separation or discharge contained in the notice to respondent. If the
   notice contained more than one reason, the board makes a separate determination for each
   reason. The board may consult the respondent's entire military record in determining whether
   retention or discharge is appropriate. In all, but particularly misconduct cases where the
   respondent has received advanced education assistance from the Air Force, the board will
   make a recommendation to the discharge authority as to whether the moneys expended on
   behalf of the respondent should be recouped. (HQ ARPC only.)
110                                                               AFI36-3209 14 APRIL 2005


  4.17.3. If separation is recommended, the board will recommend a characterization of
  service or type of separation defined in Attachment 2, IAW guidance in that attachment in
  the chapter applicable to the case and in this chapter. In enlisted cases, the board can
  consider the member’s military record during the current term of enlistment to determine the
  appropriate characterization of service.
  4.17.4. When an enlisted member is being discharged, the board will also make a
  recommendation to the discharge authority as to whether an offer of P&R is appropriate in
  that enlisted member’s case, when the enlisted member is eligible for P&R consideration
  under paragraph 3.25 of this instruction. However, if the board makes a recommendation
  that the enlisted member should be discharged for any combination of reasons that includes a
  reason that makes the member ineligible for P&R, the board should make no
  recommendation about P&R. Officers are not eligible for P&R.
      4.17.4.1. Suspension is appropriate only if the circumstances of the case indicate that
      there is a reasonable likelihood that the member is capable of being rehabilitated. During
      the period of suspension (also called the "probationary" period), the member has the
      opportunity to meet appropriate standards of conduct and duty performance.
      4.17.4.2. During the period of suspension, if the member engages in any misconduct the
      commander may vacate the suspended discharge or separation. If the member fails to
      meet any of the conditions placed on his or her probation, then the discharge authority
      may also vacate the suspension. Vacation of a suspended discharge or separation does
      not affect a commander's authority to deal with misconduct in other ways.
         4.17.4.2.1. The discharge authority initiates the vacation process by written
         notification to the member in which the member is:
             4.17.4.2.1.1. Told what information has been received that indicates that vacation
             of the suspension may be appropriate;
             4.17.4.2.1.2. Given a minimum of 30-calendar days to reply in writing to the
             discharge authority regarding the matter; and
             4.17.4.2.1.3. Afforded the opportunity to consult military legal counsel, who
             must be a Judge Advocate, to assist in preparation of a reply.
         4.17.4.2.2. After receiving the member's reply, the discharge authority obtains a
         written legal review and vacates the suspension and orders the discharge or separation
         executed, or continues the member on probation.
      4.17.4.3. Unless the suspension is vacated at an earlier time, it is automatically remitted
      at the end of the probationary period, and may be remitted at an earlier time if the
      discharge authority determines that the goal of rehabilitating the member has been
      achieved.

4.18. Reporting of Administrative Discharge Board Proceedings.
   4.18.1. Type of Report:
      4.18.1.1. The recorder prepares a verbatim report of the proceedings in any of these
      instances:
          4.18.1.1.1. If the board recommends a discharge UOTHC.
          4.18.1.1.2. In enlisted member cases, if the board recommends retention but the
          convening or discharge authority contemplates further action under paragraph 3.23.
      4.18.1.2. In cases where the board recommends an Honorable or General discharge, or
      recommends retention, the recorder prepares a summarized or verbatim report of the
      board proceedings, as required by the convening authority.
      4.18.1.3. All reports include all supporting exhibits, documents, and other writing
      admitted or offered into evidence at the board hearing, and a verbatim statement of the
      board's findings and recommendations. EXCEPTION: Personnel records, when admitted
      into evidence, are ordinarily not copied and appended to the record, as they are available
      to all levels of command for review. In addition, summarized reports contain exhibits
      e.g., the recommendation for discharge, the notification letter, the convening and
      amending orders, a summary of testimony, and the discharge authority's action, etc.
   4.18.2. Retaining Notes. The reporter or recorder retains all notes and recordings of the
   hearing until the discharge authority takes final action or longer if a need exists.
   4.18.3. Addressing the Report. In cases involving officers processed under Chapter 2, cases
   involving members with lengthy service as defined in Chapter 3, and as required in Table
   2.1 and Table 3.1, the report will be addressed through command channels to SAF. In all
   other cases, address the report to the discharge authority.
   4.18.4. Authentication:
      4.18.4.1. The legal advisor authenticates the report by certifying its accuracy and the fact
      that a majority of voting members concurred in the findings and recommendations.
      4.18.4.2. If the legal advisor is not reasonably available to authenticate the report, the
      board president and the recorder authenticate the report and state in writing the reason for
      the substitution.
      4.18.4.3. If the board president is not reasonably available to authenticate the report, a
      voting member authenticates in the president's absence, stating in writing, the reason for
      the substitution.
 112                                                                AFI36-3209 14 APRIL 2005


   4.18.5. Number of Copies. Prepare the report in an original and three copies for officer
   cases, and an original and two copies for enlisted members cases. Mark one of the copies
   "For Respondent" and be sure it contains no records withheld IAW security or medical
   directives.
NOTE: Paragraph 4.18 does not apply to physical disqualification cases processed under
paragraph 4.14.3.5.
4.19. Legal Review. After the report of board proceeding has been prepared and authenticated,

legal review to the original copy of the report of board proceedings, then forward the report to
the discharge authority for review and further action.
4.20. Directing a New Administrative Discharge Board.
   4.20.1. The discharge authority may set aside the findings and recommendations of a board
   and direct that a new board be appointed to consider a case only if the discharge authority
   makes either of these determinations:
       4.20.1.1. Finds legal prejudice to a substantial right of the respondent.
       4.20.1.2. Determines that the board arrived at its findings by fraud or collusion.
   4.20.2. No member of the new board may have served on a prior board that considered the
   case.
   4.20.3. The successor board may read the record of the proceedings of the earlier board,
   minus the findings, recommendations, and matters prejudicial to the respondent's rights.
   4.20.4. The discharge authority may not approve findings and recommendations less
   favorable to the respondent than those of the previous board unless the discharge authority
   also finds fraud or collusion in the previous board proceedings attributable to the respondent
   or an individual acting on the respondent's behalf.
4.21. Commander's Actions. In reviewing cases, directing final action, and recommending
action to higher authority, including the SAF, commanders must act IAW the guidelines and
requirements of Attachment 2, this chapter, and the chapter applying to the case. Record the
actions of the commander and include a copy of such records in the case file.
4.22. Disposition of Chapter 2 Cases.
   4.22.1. When the Board Recommends Retention. The discharge authority advises the
   respondent in writing when the administrative discharge board's recommendation for
   retention terminates the action initiated against the member under Chapter 2.
   4.22.2. When the Board Recommends Separation. The discharge authority reviews the case
   and takes one of these actions:
       4.22.2.1. Approves and directs execution of the board's recommendations.
       4.22.2.2. Forwards the case through command channels to SAF with a recommendation
       to disapprove the board's recommendations and retain the respondent.
AFI36-3209 14 APRIL 2005                                                                     113


   4.22.3. When the Discharge Authority is Not the Final Authority. The discharge authority
   reviews the case and recommends either of the actions in 4.22.2.1 or 4.22.2.2 to the Air Force
   Personnel Council or recommends that the Air Force Personnel Council change the
   characterization of service to a more favorable characterization.
   4.22.4. Forwarding Recommendations to the Air Force Personnel Council. Forward the
   original copy of the board proceedings to HQ USAF/JAG, 1420 Air Force, Pentagon
   Washington DC 20330-5120 when the situation warrants Air Force Personnel Council action.
   ANG Board proceedings are sent to ANG/MP, 3500 Fetchet Avenue, Andrews AFB MD

   4.22.5. Respondent's Copy of the Board Report. The discharge authority ensures that this
   copy of the board report is properly prepared and that it contains copies of all documentation
   not previously furnished the respondent, except those records withheld IAW security or
   medical directives. The discharge authority sends the copy to the respondent when he or she
   takes action on the board's recommendation.
       4.22.5.1. If the board report is not CLASSIFIED, forward the copy to the respondent by

       the case.
       4.22.5.4. ANG respondents should send the information to ANG/MP, 3500 Fetchet
       Avenue, Andrews AFB, MD 20762-5157, for forwarding with the discharge package.
4.23. Disposition of Chapter 3 Cases.
   4.23.1. When the Board Recommends Retention. The discharge authority reviews the case
   and approves the board's recommendation for retention. The discharge authority may not
   direct separation. (EXCEPTION: The discharge authority may initiate action under

       characterization than the type the board recommends.
 114                                                               AFI36-3209 14 APRIL 2005


       4.23.2.3. Approves the board’s recommendations for separation, with or without
       approving a better type of separation or characterization than that recommended by the
       board, but directs the discharge or separation be suspended to afford the member P&R.
       The boards recommendation for suspension is not binding on the discharge authority.
       4.23.2.4. Disapproves the board's recommendations and retains the respondent.
   4.23.3. When the Discharge Authority is Not the Final Authority. If the discharge authority
   is not the final discharge approval or review authority as outlined in Table 2.1 and Table 3.1,
   the case with any recommendations are forwarded to the SAF. Cases involving
   conscientious objectors are sent to AFPC. ANG cases are forward to NGB/DPP.
   4.23.4. Forwarding Cases to the SAF. When the circumstances require SAF action, forward
   the original copy of the board proceedings including any corrections to the Statement of
   Reasons, through command channels to SAF with a letter of transmittal. The letter must
   contain the discharge authority’s recommendations and the reasons for them.
   4.23.5. Respondent Copy of the Board Report. The discharge authority ensures that this
   copy of the board report is properly prepared and contains copies of all documentation not
   previously furnished the respondent except those records withheld IAW security or medical
   directives. Send the copy to the respondent when the discharge authority takes action on the
   board's recommendations or sends the case to SAF.
4.24. Reporting Separation for More Than One Reason. The discharge authority must
consider all reasons for discharge, citing in the discharge instrument the most appropriate basis
as the primary reason for discharge. The primary reason will be reported in PDS.
4.25. Dual Processing . SAF approval is required when a member is subject to involuntary
discharge under this AFI and is eligible for disability separation or disability retirement IAW
AFI 36-3212. These cases should be closely monitored to ensure a discharge under this AFI is
not executed before the AFI 36-3212 case has been completed.
AFI36-3209 14 APRIL 2005                                                                   115

                                       RETIREMENT

Section 5A—Recognition of Members Being Retired

5.1. General Instructions. Recognition on retirement is a long-standing tradition of military
service. Each commander makes sure members leave with a tangible expression of appreciation
for their contribution to the Air Force and its mission and with the assurance that they will
continue to be a part of the Air Force family in retirement.
   5.1.1. Commanders ensure members have a retirement ceremony to recognize their
   contributions.
   5.1.2. As a courtesy, offer the retiring member a formal ceremony in keeping with the
   customs and traditions of the Service. A general officer conducts the ceremony, if possible.
   Encourage holding the retirement ceremony as part of formal military formations when
   conditions permit. Invite relatives and friends to attend.
       5.1.2.1. At the ceremony present:
          5.1.2.1.1. A DD Form 363AF, Certificate of Retirement (see paragraph 5.2).
          5.1.2.1.2. The Air Force Retired Lapel Button.
          5.1.2.1.3. A DD Form 2542, Certificate of Appreciation for Service in the Armed
          Forces of the United States (see paragraph 5.5).
          5.1.2.1.4. If appropriate, the Presidential Letter of Appreciation (see paragraph
          5.5.4).
          5.1.2.1.5. Any awards, decorations, honors, or letters of appreciation.
          5.1.2.1.6. If appropriate, the AF Form 423, Certificate of Appreciation, to the
          retirees spouse (see paragraph 5.4).
       5.1.2.2. Commanders follow formal ceremony procedures unless the member prefers
       otherwise. If the member doesn’t want a formal ceremony, or for any reason (leave or
       hospitalization) can’t be present for duty on the retirement date, the commander
       personally presents all decorations and any awards or honors to the member at another
       time. Don't mail the retirement certificate to a retirement address unless you have no
       other choice.
       5.1.2.3. Non-EAD members retiring or transferring to the Retired Reserve may take part
       in a retirement ceremony.
          5.1.2.3.1. Unit assigned members contact their commander to request a retirement
          ceremony.
          5.1.2.3.2. Non-unit assigned members contact the protocol office at any Air Force
          base to request a retirement ceremony.

Section 5C—Determining Retired Pay for Non-Regular Service at Age 60

5.17. General Instructions. All members and former members must apply to HQ
ARPC/DPAR in order to initiate retired pay.
5.18. Age, Grade, and Service Requirements.
    5.18.1. A person may apply for and receive retired pay who:
       5.18.1.1. Is at least 60 years old.
       5.18.1.2. Has qualified by completing at least 20 years of satisfactory Federal service (or
       15 years under the Early Qualification for Retired Pay at Age 60, [ends 30 Sep 99]) as
       computed under this section.
       5.18.1.3. Has performed the last 6 or 8 years of satisfactory Federal service while a
       member of any category of the Armed Forces except a Regular component, the Fleet
       Reserve, or the Fleet Marine Corps Reserve IAW Title 10 U.S.C., Section 12731(f).
       5.18.1.4. Is not entitled, under any other law, to retired pay from an armed forces or
       retainer pay as a member of the Fleet Reserve or the Fleet Marine Corps Reserve.
AFI36-3209 14 APRIL 2005                                                                      127


   5.18.2. Active Duty Requirement. A person who, before 16 Aug 45, was a Reserve of an
   armed force, or a member of the Army without component, or other category covered by
   Title 10 U.S.C., Section 12732(a)(1), Entitlement to Retired Pay: Computation of Years of
   Service, is not eligible for retired pay under this chapter unless:
      5.18.2.1. Performed active duty after 5 Apr 17 and before 12 Nov 18, or after 8 Sep 40
      and before 1 Jan 47, or;
      5.18.2.2. Performed active duty, other than for training after 26 Jun 50 and before 28 Jul
      53, or after 13 Aug 61 and before 31 May 63, or after 4 Aug 64 and before 28 Mar 73.
   5.18.3. For the purpose of computing the last 6 or 8 years of satisfactory Federal service, the
   service doesn’t have to be continuous. Reserve members serving in the Regular Army, Air
   Force, Navy, Marine Corps, or Coast Guard, earn active service but, this service isn’t
   credited as Reserve service and doesn’t count towards the last 6 or 8 years of satisfactory
   Federal service. EXAMPLE: A member who served 14 years as a reservist and then 6 years
   in the Regular Air Force must serve an additional 6 years in a Reserve status to qualify for
   retired pay, if the last 8 year rule was applicable.
   5.18.4. Creditable Service Before 1 Jul 49. Service before 1 Jul 49 used in determining
   entitlement to retired pay at age 60 is in Title 10 U.S.C., Section 12732(a)(1), (3), and (4),
   Entitlement to Retired Pay Computation of Years of Service.
   5.18.5. Creditable Service After 30 Jun 49. Add the member’s years of service for each 1-
   year period after 30 Jun 49 in which member has been credited with at least 50 points per
   Title 10 U.S.C., Section 12732(a)(2).
   5.18.6. Noncreditable Service. Title 10 U.S.C., Section 12732(b) lists service that isn’t
   creditable for entitlement to retired pay.
   5.18.7. Retired Pay Grade. Member is entitled to be placed on the retired list established by
   Title 10 U.S.C., Section 8966, Retired Lists, in the highest grade served satisfactorily (see
   paragraph 5.14).
   5.18.8. Converting Years of Service for Computing Retired Pay. Table 5.4 explains the
   method of converting service for computing pay.
5.19. Retention Beyond Entitlement to Reserve Retired Pay.
   5.19.1. Normally reservists are not retained beyond qualifying for paid retirement; however,
   retention beyond this point may be approved for certain Reservists IAW 10 U.S.C., Section
   12308.
   5.19.2. If member does not apply for retired pay and desires to remain in an active status and
   to participate beyond retirement eligibility, member must receive a waiver from SAF to
   receive federal service credit for points after being qualified for retired pay at age 60, IAW
   10 U.S.C., Section 12308.

   entitlement (no more than 6 years) or any date thereafter.
 128                                                                AFI36-3209 14 APRIL 2005


   5.19.4. If retroactive pay is elected, the member must waive 1 day of retired pay for each day
   of participation pay received.
5.20. Proof of Eligibility.
   5.20.1. As provided by Title 10 U.S.C., Section 12731(d), Point Credit Accounting Division
   (HQ ARPC/DPK), upon verification of retirement eligibility, will notify each member in
   writing (Notification of Eligibility for Retired Pay at Age 60 letter) within 1 year after the
   member becomes eligible. This letter was established on 14 Oct 66 as a result of Public Law
   89-652. HQ ARPC/DPK is the only authorized office to issue this letter (Attachment 15 or
   Attachment 16). DPK will Issue the letter of notification (original and one copy) and a
   wallet-sized copy, in the name of the Commander, HQ ARPC, and authenticate it by getting
   the handwritten signature of the official or employee directly responsible for determining the
   eligibility of the Reserve member.
   5.20.2. Once the member receives the notification of eligibility letter, this eligibility may not
   be denied or revoked on the basis of any error, miscalculation, misinformation, or
   administrative determination of years of service performed, unless it resulted directly from
   the fraud or misrepresentation by the member concerned.
   5.20.3. Corrections to the point credit accounting record may be made to adjust the number
   of years of creditable service, to correct an error, miscalculation, misinformation, or
   administrative decision. The member receives retired pay based on the correct number of
   years of creditable service as verified by the appropriate office at ARPC.
   5.20.4. Only consider a partial year of satisfactory Federal service when the member applies
   for transfer to the Retired Reserve. Contact ARPC/DPK prior to the member submitting an
   AF Form 131 when partial years are involved for retirement.
5.21. How to Apply for Age 60 Retirement.
   5.21.1. Members Not on EAD or Assigned to the Retired Reserve. Members will receive a
   set of application documents with a letter of instruction, retirement points and an estimate of
   retired pay, about 4 months before their 60th birthday from ARPC/DPAR. All documents
   should be completed and returned to HQ ARPC/DPAR approximately 45 days before the
   member’s 60th birthday in order to eliminate any delays in receiving retired pay.
   5.21.2. Members Serving on EAD. These members receive a letter from HQ AFPC/DPPRS
   notifying them of the termination of their active status by reason of reaching the maximum
   age.
       5.21.2.1. If a member elects to retire, HQ ARPC/DPAR will forward the pay application
       forms and instructions to the member to apply for retired pay. Forward documents IAW
       Table 5.5.
       5.21.2.2. The member may request a retirement physical examination.
   5.21.3. Former Members. Must contact HQ ARPC/DPAR to request pay application forms.

   5.22.1. The SAF or designee approves transfers to the Retired Reserve and applications for
   retired pay benefits under this chapter.

   5.22.2. Approval authority is delegated to HQ ARPC for members not on EAD and for those
   who don’t have military status (former member).
       5.22.2.1. When an application is approved, ARPC issues orders IAW paragraph 5.24.
       5.22.2.2. ARPC notifies the MPF or the member if the eligibility requirements have not
       been met.
5.23. Date Retired Pay Begins. Retired pay begins on the date the member meets the
requirements of paragraph 5.18.
NOTE:
 The law requires that a claim be filed within 6 years of the entitlement to receive retroactive pay
to the date of eligibility. If the member doesn’t apply by the 6th anniversary of eligibility, 1 day
of retired pay will be lost for each day of delay. EXAMPLE: If a member reached eligibility on
9 Jan 90 and didn’t file the application for retired pay until 1 Apr 96, the member is due pay only
from 1 Apr 90 forward.
5.24. Retirement Order. HQ ARPC/DPAR publishes retirement order, EL series (computer
generated or manual), for non EAD members, placing members on the USAF Retired List. HQ
AFPC/DPPRSO publishes retirement orders for EAD members in the grade of 05 and below and
AFDPOB publishes these orders for colonels. AFGOMO publishes these orders for general

       SBP guarantees that the member’s beneficiary will receive an annuity of 55 percent of the

       or former spouse under RCSBP normally reduces to 35 percent at age 62. The member
       may elect RCSBP or SBP coverage and survivor benefits offered under civil service
       retirement since there is no conflict of interest that prohibits coverage under both
       programs at the same time.
   5.25.2. Former Members. Retired under Title 10 U.S.C., Section 12731 at age 60 are
   entitled to:

   readjustment or separation pay. NOTE: Members who elect disability severance pay and
   are discharged from their military status will not be eligible for retired pay at age 60. There is
   no provision of law which would allow members to repay the severance pay they received
   for physical disability in order to become eligible for retired pay at age 60.

      GUIDELINES FOR SEPARATION AND SERVICE CHARACTERIZATION

A2.1. General Considerations About Service Characterization
   A2.1.1. Base the characterization of service on the quality of the member's service as
   reflected in the military record, including personal conduct, performance of duty, and the
   reason for discharge. Determine the quality of service according to standards of acceptable
   personal conduct and performance of duty. Follow the standards found in the Uniform Code
   of Military Justice (UCMJ), Air Force directives, state military code, and the time-honored
   customs and traditions of military service.
   A2.1.2. As a rule, base service characterization on a pattern of behavior rather than on an
   isolated incident. Evaluate the frequency and seriousness of disciplinary infractions. If a
   military record contains derogatory data, consider the total service in the current enlistment
   or period of service. Give due consideration to the member's age, length of service, grade,
   aptitude, physical and mental condition, and the standards of acceptable conduct and
   performance of duty. There are circumstances, however, in which the conduct or
   performance of duty reflected by a single incident, particularly in a misconduct case, may
   provide the basis for the service characterization.
   A2.1.3. Consider conduct in the civilian community even if it is not subject to UCMJ
   jurisdiction or state military code in characterizing service. Conduct in the civilian
   community that brings discredit on the USAF, ANG, or AFRC; or conduct prejudicial to
   good order and discipline, adversely affects the quality of a member's service. The burden of
   proof to the contrary rests with the respondent (that is, the member being considered for
   separation). See specific restrictions for members not on active duty or ADT in paragraphs
   A2.2.2 and A2.2.3.
A2.2. Types of Service Characterization:
   A2.2.1. Honorable. The Honorable characterization is appropriate when the quality of the
   member's service generally has met USAF standards of acceptable conduct and performance
   of duty. It may also be appropriate when a member's service is otherwise so meritorious that
   any other characterization would be inappropriate.
   A2.2.2. Under Honorable Conditions (General). If a member's service has been honest and
   faithful, but significant negative aspects of conduct or performance of duty outweigh positive
   aspects of the member's military record. NOTE: Use conduct in the civilian community of a
   member who is not on active duty or ADT to characterize service as General only if the
   conduct has an adverse impact on the effectiveness of the Air Force, including military
   morale and efficiency.
   A2.2.3. UOTHC. A member's service may be characterized as UOTHC only if the member
   is given an opportunity for a hearing by an administrative discharge board or requests
   discharge in lieu of trial by court martial. However, conduct in the civilian community of a
   member not on active duty or ADT may be used to characterize service as UOTHC only if
   the conduct directly affects the performance of military duties. Examples of conduct that
   directly affects the performance of military duties include but, are not limited to the
   following:
 146                                                              AFI36-3209 14 APRIL 2005


       A2.2.3.1. Missing muster or screening;
       A2.2.3.2. Missing a UTA, IADT, OR ADT;
       A2.2.3.3. Offenses which involve either a military member or a DoD agency as a victim.
   A2.2.4. Characterization of service as UOTHC may be appropriate when the reason for
   separation is based on one or more acts or omissions that constitute a significant departure
   from the conduct expected. Examples of this type conduct are:
       A2.2.4.1. The use of force or violence to produce serious bodily injury or death;
       A2.2.4.2. Abuse of a special position of trust;
       A2.2.4.3. Disregard by a superior of customary superior-subordinate relationships;
       A2.2.4.4. Acts or omissions that endanger the security of the US;.
       A2.2.4.5. Acts or omissions that endanger the health and welfare of other members of
       the Air Force; or
       A2.2.4.6. Deliberate acts or omissions that seriously endanger the health and safety of
       other persons.
A2.3. Other Separations with No Service Characterization:
   A2.3.1. Dropped From the Rolls of the Air Force. An officer or enlisted member may be
   dropped from the rolls of the Air Force when authorized by this instruction. (HQ USAF
   takes final action on all cases).
   A2.3.2. Entry Level Separation. A separation based on an action that starts while the
   enlisted member is in entry-level status.
   A2.3.3. Release From Custody and Control of The Air Force (By Reason of Void
   Enlistment). When a member does not require characterization or an entry level separation,
   describe the separation as an order of release from custody and control of the Air Force.
A2.4. Period Considered in Characterizing Service. Determine characterization of service solely
on the member's military record in the period of service that is ending.
   A2.4.1. Prior service activities, including records of conviction by court-martial, records of
   absence without leave, or commission of other offenses for which punishment was not
   imposed shall not be considered on the issue of characterization. To the extent that such
   matters are considered on the issue of retention or discharge, the record of proceedings may
   reflect express direction that such information shall not be considered on the issue of
   characterization.
   A2.4.2. Preservice activities may not be considered on the issue of characterization except as
   follows: in a proceeding concerning fraudulent entry into military service, evidence of
   preservice misrepresentations about matters that would have precluded, postponed, or
   otherwise affected the member's eligibility for enlistment may be considered on the issue of
   service characterization.
AFI36-3209 14 APRIL 2005                                                                       147


A2.5. Limitations on Service Characterization:
   A2.5.1. In some cases you may not consider evidence used to show that a basis for discharge
   exists, when you are deciding how to characterize the member's service. Consult a staff
   judge advocate for help in deciding how to use such evidence. If the discharge authority
   directs the issuance of a General or UOTHC discharge, the instrument that directs discharge
   must show how other circumstances of the member's military record warrant such a
   characterization.
   A2.5.2. On the issue of characterization, don't consider conduct that has been the subject of
   judicial proceedings resulting in an acquittal, or other action having the same effect.
EXCEPTION:
    When such action is based on judicial determination about matters other than the guilt or
     innocence of the respondent.
    When a judicial proceeding was conducted in a state or foreign court, refer it to the
     Office of the Air Force Personnel Council for final decision.
   A2.5.3. You may not discharge a member UOTHC if the sole basis for discharge is a serious
   offense that resulted in conviction by a court-martial if court-martial did not impose a
   punitive discharge. EXCEPTION: The Air Force Personnel Council may approve such a
   discharge.
   A2.5.4. Additional limitations that apply to service characterizations:
       A2.5.4.1. Drug Abuse. Under the provisions of AFI 36-2701, governing self-
       identification or treatment for drug abuse, don't consider the following items when
       deciding on the issue of characterization:
          A2.5.4.1.1. A member's voluntary self-identification for treatment for drug abuse.
          A2.5.4.1.2. The evidence the member voluntarily provides in connection with the
          self-identification.
          A2.5.4.1.3. The results of mandatory urinalysis testing for controlled substances may
          not be used if the testing was conducted during a command directed examination or
          referral of a specified member for a valid medical purpose according to the Manual
          for Court-Martial Rules of Evidence 312(f), when there is a reasonable suspicion of
          drug abuse or during an examination of a specified member in conjunction with the
          member's participation in a drug treatment and rehabilitation program.
NOTE: A command-directed examination as described in AFI 36-2701is one conducted to
determine:
              A2.5.4.1.3.1. A member's competence for duty.
              A2.5.4.1.3.2. The need for counseling, or other medical treatment.
          A2.5.4.1.4. Exceptions:
              A2.5.4.1.4.1. The evidence discussed in subparagraphs A2.5.4.1 and A2.5.4.1.3
              to impeach or rebut evidence of drug abuse (or non-abuse) if the member first
              introduced the subject.
148                                                               AFI36-3209 14 APRIL 2005


             A2.5.4.1.4.2. Independently derived evidence, including the results of mandatory
             urinalysis testing not specifically excluded from consideration, when you are
             deciding the issue of service characterization.
      A2.5.4.2.
         A2.5.4.2.1. By using force, coercion, or intimidation.
         A2.5.4.2.2. With a person under 16 years of age.
         A2.5.4.2.3. With a subordinate in circumstances that violate customary military
         superior-subordinate relationships.
         A2.5.4.2.4. Openly in public view.
         A2.5.4.2.5. For compensation.
         A2.5.4.2.6. Aboard a military vessel or aircraft.
         A2.5.4.2.7. In another location subject to military control under aggravating
         circumstances, noted in the findings, that have an adverse impact on discipline, good
         order, or morale comparable to the impact of such activity aboard a vessel or aircraft

foreign government. I request that I be retained in the Air Force Reserve beyond, (date), the
expiration date of my term of service, until such time as final action on charges against me by the
foreign government has been completed. I understand that my retention in the military service
for this purpose makes me subject to the obligations of military service in the same way and to
the same extent as if my term of service had not expired. I know that since I am subject to the
UCMJ it is possible that court-martial charges may be preferred against me if the foreign
government does not proceed with its case. I certify that this request for retention in the service
is not the result of coercion, force or threat of harm. (See note below.)

       RETIREMENT OPTIONS OR ENTITLEMENTS FOR AN ACTIVE DUTY
                            RETIREMENT

MPF: Give a copy of this fact sheet to each member applying for active duty retirement between
the start of retirement processing and receipt of retirement orders.
A18.1. Retirement Planning . Because you are nearing retirement, you must begin careful
planning for after retirement. The place you retire and the entitlements based on the place of
retirement are important parts of this planning. This fact sheet is a quick reference to help you
make favorable decisions. This information is not all-inclusive, and there are exceptions, so you
should seek personal counseling from your MPF and the Transportation Management Officer
(TMO) before making firm plans, and before you move your family or household goods.
A18.2. Place of Retirement . All members stationed in the CONUS must retire at their current
duty station. (Members assigned to geographically separated units (GSU) may have to go to the
nearest Air Force base that has a MPF to complete retirement processing.) Members stationed
overseas may retire at the overseas duty station or a processing station of choice in the CONUS.
The option as to place of retirement is the same whether you retire for service or for disability.
The place of retirement has a direct effect on entitlement to movement of household goods.
Paragraph A18.3 and Table A18.1 at the end of this fact sheet outline these entitlements.
A18.3. Entitlement to Movement of Household Goods (HHG) . All members retiring for
length of service (immediately following at least 8 years of continuous active duty with no single
break in service of more than 90 days), and all members retiring for physical disability (without
regard for length of service) are entitled to travel to a “home of selection” (retirement home).
This entitlement includes travel for yourself and your authorized family members, and shipment
of your household goods (including storage, if required). However, if you had less than 18 years
active service as of 1 Nov 81, you may receive travel and transportation allowances to any place
within the US, a place outside the US from which you were first called or ordered to active duty
to your first duty station, or to any other place at a cost not to exceed what it would have cost the
government had you selected a home at a specified place in the CONUS (JTR, volume 1,
paragraph U5130; AFI 24-501 [formerly AFR 75-25, Chapter 5]). Members retiring in the
CONUS who wish to move to an overseas home of selection must contact the embassy of the
country concerned, in advance of travel, for information about the documents necessary in order
to meet host government residency requirements. In all cases, you must receive your retirement
orders (or know the order number, date, and fund citation) before traveling or shipping and
storing your HHGs. Travel to your home of selection must be completed and HHGs turned over
to a military TMO or to a carrier for shipment within 1 year from date of retirement.
EXCEPTION: This 1 year limitation may be extended for reason of hospitalization or medical
treatment, education or training (approved by the Director, Joint Personal Property Shipping
Office San Antonio, 8961 Tesoro Drive, Suite 300, San Antonio TX 78286-6209), or other
deserving reasons (approved by HQ AFPC/DPPTT), as provided in JTR, volume I, paragraph
U5130, and AFI 24-101, Passenger Travel (formerly AFR 75-8) and AFI 24-501, Do-It-Yourself
(DITY), (formerly AFR 75-25).
AFI36-3209 14 APRIL 2005                                                                      171


   A18.3.1. The appropriate HQs issues retirement orders for members retiring for length of
   service as early as possible after approval of the retirement (usually within 60 days), if they
   can get the accounting classification fund citation and verify the service computation.
   A18.3.2. You may move to a home of selection as soon as you receive retirement orders.
   Unless you receive an extension of the time limit for hospitalization or medical treatment,
   household goods may not stay in nontemporary storage at government expense for longer
   than 1 year immediately following date of retirement (termination of active duty) (JTR,
   volume I, chapter 5, Part B, and 37 U.S.C. 401[d]). When appropriate personnel extend the
   home of selection time limit based on education, training, or other deserving cases,
   household goods may continue in nontemporary storage at government rates, but you must
   reimburse the government for these costs. With some exceptions, you may ship HHGs from
   the last or any previous permanent duty station, from storage, or from the place last moved at
   government expense (or a combination of those places), to a designated home of selection.
   You may make shipment between other points if you pay costs in excess of shipment in one
   lot between the last permanent duty station and the home of selection (JTR, volume 1,
   chapter 5, Part B).
   A18.3.3. An officer who separates and enlists for the purpose of retirement in enlisted status
   is not entitled to shipment of household goods and travel of authorized family members
   based on separation orders.
A18.4. Summary of Entitlements to Movement of Household Goods :
   A18.4.1. For members stationed in CONUS:
      A18.4.1.1. If living in government quarters, you may move at government expense to
      civilian quarters in the local area, then later move at government expense to home of
      selection. A move at government expense from local civilian quarters to other local
      civilian quarters will use up your entitlement to a further move to a final home of
      selection.
      A18.4.1.2. You may put HHGs in nontemporary storage while deciding on a home of
      selection, then move at government expense to home of selection. Storage at government
      expense expires no later than 1 year following retirement unless you get an authorized or
      approved time extension based on hospitalization or medical treatment.
      A18.4.1.3. You may move directly to home of selection at government of expense.
   A18.4.2. Members stationed overseas. You may retire at an overseas duty station. You
   must satisfy host government residency requirements before retirement, unless you are
   stationed in Alaska, Hawaii, or US territories or possession. See the options and procedures
   outlined in A18.4.1, which also apply to members stationed overseas. You must pay any
   import taxes or duties imposed on your personal property by the host government, territory,
   or possession.

  A18.4.3. You may retire at a processing station of choice in the CONUS as long as it has an
  MPF with retirement processing capability. From the processing station of you choice you
  may:
      A18.4.3.1. Put HHGs in nontemporary storage at the CONUS port for up to 1 year
      following retirement while deciding on a home of selection, then move at government
      expense to home of selection.
      A18.4.3.2. Have all or part of your HHG delivered in the vicinity of the retirement
      processing point while deciding on a home of selection (HOS) then move to a HOS at
      government expense. Understand that you must pay all costs for recapping, recrating and
      duplicating delivery storage charges associated with the reshipment from the processing
      point to the final HOS by way of the port. You may continue to keep your HHG placed
      in nontemporary storage (NTS) during the overseas tour for up to 1 year after retirement
      and then have them shipped to HOS. You may not ship them to the processing station
      unless that is your HOS.
      A18.4.3.3. You may move directly to your home of selection at government expense.
      NOTE: For members retiring CONUS who are non-CONUS residents (that is, whose
      home of record is outside the 48 CONUS states): travel entitlements are the same as if
      travel was to a CONUS state. However, you use your home of selection entitlement
      when you move to home in an overseas state at government expense.
