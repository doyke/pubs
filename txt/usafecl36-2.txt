1. General. The items listed do not constitute the order or limit the scope of the inspection or
assessment. As a minimum, units should use USAFE inspection checklists in conjunction with
the Unit Self-Assessment and HHQ inspection checklists. The objective is to identify
deficiencies that preclude attainment of required capabilities. Higher headquarters may use this
checklist in whole or in part during visits or exercises.
   1.1. Core Compliance Guide Items (CCGI) and Compliance Guide Items (CGI). Items
   identified by functional managers to prioritize command requirements and to allow the
   Inspector General (HQ USAFE/IG) inspectors to assess criticality of deficiencies.
       1.1.1. CCGI. Items identified by HQ USAFE directorates and functional managers as
       key result areas for successful mission accomplishment including, but not limited to,
       items where non-compliance could result in serious injury, loss of life, excessive cost,
       litigation, or affect system reliability. These requirements may be mandated by law,
       Executive Order, DoD directive, safety, or Air Force and USAFE strategic plans. CCGIs
       are referred to as significant guide items requiring direct IG evaluation. Identify CCGIs
       by using uppercase and bold letters.
       1.1.2. CGI. CGI are areas that require special vigilance and are important to the overall
       performance of the unit. Noncompliance could result in some negative impact on
       mission performance but is not likely to result in injury, unnecessary cost, or litigation.
       Identify CGIs by using standard sentence case.
2. Applicability. All items on this inspection checklist are assigned an applicability code
designating to which type of unit the item applies. Applicability code 3 designates the following
main operating bases: Aviano, Incirlik, Lakenheath, Mildenhall, Ramstein, Spangdahlem, and
Lajes.
