                    GENERAL POLICIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

1.1. General Policy.
   1.1.1. This instruction provides guidance for the McConnell AFB Airfield Driving Program
   (ADP). This instruction will ensure safe ground vehicle operations and pedestrian control on
   USAF owned and operated airfields. It outlines training requirements for all personnel (e.g.
   military, Department of Defense, Civilian, Contractors, etc.) who, as part of their job, are
   required to drive unescorted on an airfield. Personnel required to drive on the airfield must be
   knowledgeable of and comply with the procedures outlined in this Airfield Driving
   Instruction (ADI).
   1.1.2. In today’s complex airfield environment, there are incidents involving aircraft,
   pedestrians, and ground vehicles at USAF airfields that lead to property damage and
   personnel injury. One of the most hazardous incidents for an airfield driver to be involved in
   is a runway incursion.
   1.1.3. A runway incursion occurs when an aircraft, vehicle or person enters the protected
   area of a surface designated for the landing and takeoff of aircraft without approval from Air
   Traffic Control Tower (Control Tower). Runway incursions have the potential to result in
   aircraft endangerment and loss of life. While there are several factors involved in a runway
   incursion, the leading causes of these incidents are: failure to follow procedures, inadequate
   vehicle operator training, and loss of situational awareness. Therefore, strict adherence to the
   procedures in this base instruction is essential to prevent aircraft-vehicle mishaps and
   personnel injury on the airfield.
   1.1.4. Airfield Management (22 OSS/OSAA) is responsible for the McConnell AFB Airfield
   Driving Program. Unit Airfield Driving Program Managers are responsible for the individual
   unit training programs. Unit ADPMs ensure all airfield drivers are properly trained and
   certified. Only operators and vehicles designated by the Wing Commander or Airfield
   Management, as prescribed in AFMAN 24-306, Manual for the Wheeled Vehicle Operator,
   AFI 13-213, Airfield Driving Program and AFI 31-204, Air Force Motor Vehicle Traffic
   Supervision, will be given access to the airfield.
   1.1.5. The ADP for McConnell AFB is developed and managed in accordance with AFI 13-
   213. The standards and directives on the following pages have been established for the
   control of all motor vehicles and airfield drivers on MAFB. This instruction is applicable to
   all personnel driving on any portion of MAFB airfield, to include, all locally assigned
   personnel (military and civilian), Department of Defense (DoD) contractors, private
   contractors, TDY personnel and foreign nationals. All associate units operating on the
   airfield will comply with this instruction.
1.2. Wing Commander:
   1.2.1. Designates personnel and agencies to support the 22 ARW Airfield Driving Program.
   The 22 ARW Airfield Driving Program includes the 184 IW, 373 TRS DET 8, 931 AMXS,
   931 MXS and associated/tenant units.

     1.2.4. Requests an Air Force Runway Safety Action Team (AFRSAT) through MAJCOM
     OPR for AO if there are recurring problems with runway incursions. See AFI 13-204 V2,
     Airfield Operations Standardization and Evaluations, for additional information.
     1.2.5. Reviews runway incursion incidents and corrective actions taken.
1.3. Operations Group Commander:
     1.3.1. Reviews Controlled Movement Area Violations (CMAVs) and corrective actions
     taken.
     1.3.2. Implements and chairs a Runway Incursion Prevention Working Group (RIPWG) if
     there are more than two runway incursions within a six month period. NOTE: The RIPWG
     shall convene within 30 days after the second runway incursion.
        1.3.2.1. The RIPWG will include OSS/CC, AOF/CC, Airfield Manager (AFM), Wing
        ADPM, Tower Chief Controller, Wing Safety, Unit Commanders and/or Unit ADPMs,
        and other organizational leadership as determined locally. The RIPWG shall take the

                     GENERAL AIRFIELD VEHICLE OPERATIONS

4.1. Definitions and Aircraft Movement Areas.
   4.1.1. McConnell’s airfield is defined as all areas, facilities, pavements and grounds
   prepared to support aircraft operations.
   4.1.2. The airfield is the portion of the base where aircraft routinely takeoff, land, taxi, park,
   or are towed. It includes runways, taxiways or areas where aircraft may be encountered.
   NOTE: The Control Tower is responsible for all vehicles and pedestrian traffic in the
   controlled movement area.
   4.1.3. Runways: 01L/19R: 12,000’ X 150’, runs north/south.
01R/19L: 12,000’ X 150’, runs north/south.
   4.1.4. Overruns: The paved portion extending outward from the end of each runway.
   4.1.5. Taxiways: McConnell AFB maintains six active taxiways. Taxiway A is parallel to
   Runway 01R/19L. Taxiway B crosses the approach end of runways 19L/R. Taxiway C
   crosses Runways 01R/19L and 01L/19R at midfield, as does Taxiway D. Taxiway E crosses
   the approach end of Runways 01L/R. Taxiway F is parallel to Runway 01L/19R, it begins at
   Taxiway B and terminates at Taxiway D.
   4.1.6. Mass Aircraft Parking Area: The main aircraft parking ramp. The controlled area
   boundary for the MAPA is defined as the area encompassed by Salina Drive on the north, the
   blast deflectors on the east, boundary south of Building 1111 and Taxiway A on the west.
   This area is enclosed by a single chain link fence on the north and by a single red painted line
   on the ramp and along the boundary parallel to Taxiway A. The area is posted with
   appropriate restricted area signs. The OPR for this restricted area is the 22d Operations
   Group Commander. NOTE: In some cases the boundary to the MAPA may be changed and
   marked with red or orange rope supported by stanchions.
   4.1.7. Operations Ramp: The area in front of Base Operations, Bldg 1112. This is the
   primary parking area for Distinguished Visitors and smaller transient aircraft.
   4.1.8. Delta Ramp: Located south of Bldg 1218. Double yellow dashed wingtip clearance
   lines are painted to ensure a safe taxiing environment for KC-135 and smaller aircraft taxiing
   on Taxiway A. All aircraft and aircraft support equipment must remain behind these lines.
   Delta Ramp is primarily used for large transient aircraft parking. When aircraft are present in
   this area it is designated as a controlled area and entry control points will be utilized.
   4.1.9. De-icing Pad: Located on Taxiway A between Taxiways C and D. It consists of three
   designated locations established for aircraft de-icing prior to takeoff.
   4.1.10. Echo Ramp: This is the primary hot cargo area and is located near the intersection of
   Taxiway A and D. Echo Ramp is used for hazardous cargo on/off load. When aircraft are
   present in this area it is designated as a controlled area and entry control points will be
   utilized. A portion of this area is within the wingtip clearance area, so special attention must
   be paid when aircraft are taxiing (this area is identified with double yellow dashed lines).
MCCONNELLAFBI13-213 23 DECEMBER 2013                                                           23


  4.1.11. Foxtrot Row: Located at the southeast end of the airfield near the intersection of
  Taxiway A and E. Foxtrot Row is used for wing or transient aircraft parking. When aircraft
  are present in this area it is designated as a controlled area and entry control points will be
  utilized. A portion of this area is within the wingtip clearance area, so special attention must
  be paid when aircraft are taxiing (this area is identified with double yellow dashed lines).
  4.1.12. Controlled Movement Area (CMA) (See Attachment 10): An 175 foot boundary
  from the edge of the runway that surrounds both runways. Access into the CMA requires
  two-way radio communication with and approval from the Control Tower. The controlled
  movement area consists of:
     4.1.12.1. Both active runways.
     4.1.12.2. The area between the runways/overruns.
     4.1.12.3. 175’ from the edge of both runways.
     4.1.12.4. 175’ from the edge of the south overruns and to the perimeter fence on the
     north overruns.
  4.1.13. There are two perimeter roads located on the airfield.
     4.1.13.1. The North Road links from Taxiway B on the east side and connects to
     Taxiway F on the west side. This is part of the CMA and Tower approval is required
     prior to entering this area.
     4.1.13.2. The South Road runs from Taxiway A on the east side and connects to Taxiway
     E on the west side of the runways. This is not part of the CMA and communication with
     the Tower is not required.
     4.1.13.3. The Center Access Road runs in between the runways and to operate in this
     area requires communication with the Tower when entering, operating on or exiting.
  4.1.14. Entry Control Points: A designated point that may be used to enter aircraft parking
  areas. Entry points are identified by black letters on a white background with the word Entry
  Control Point.
  4.1.15. Emergency Response Vehicles: The primary initial Emergency response vehicles

4.2. Airfield Markings.
   4.2.1. Runway designation markings indicate the magnetic azimuth of the runway centerline
   to the nearest 10-degree increment. The designation consists of two numbers and, at bases
   with parallel runways like McConnell, a letter. McConnell’s runways are 01R/19L and
   01L/19R. See Attachment 19 for additional Airport Sign and Marking guidance.
   4.2.2. Runway centerline markings are dashed lines on the runway with uniformly spaced
   longitudinal stripes 3’ wide and 100’ long.
   4.2.3. Runway Side Stripes: Solid white lines running the length of the runway to help
   acquire the landing environment.
   4.2.4. Threshold markings are located at the end of each runway and identify the beginning
   of the full strength pavement.
   4.2.5. Runway VFR Hold Line Position Marking: (Figure 4.2) Four parallel yellow stripes
   on a black background that extend across the entire width of a taxiway, 175’ from the edge of
   the runway. The two lines closest to the runway are dashed and the other two lines are solid.
   This marking identifies the boundary of the runway environment and must not be crossed
   without prior approval from the tower. When directed to hold short of the runway, remain
   behind these lines. All vehicle operators will be shown these lines during their day and night
   orientation check rides.

      4.2.8.1. Vehicle Wingtip Clearance Lines
          4.2.8.1.1. White wingtip clearance lines are double yellow, dashed lines painted 115
          ft from the taxiway centerline to provide for 50 ft wing tip clearance for KC-135s.
          These lines are for KC-135 aircraft, drivers must be aware that these lines are not safe
          for wingtip clearance for larger aircraft such as C-17s.
      4.2.8.2. Aircrew Training Wingtip Clearance Lines
          4.2.8.2.1. These lines are provided to give KC-135 aircrew a visual glance at wingtip
          clearance requirements from the edge of the pilot’s wingtip to 10ft and 25ft outward.
          These lines are not vehicle driving lanes nor vehicle clearance lines.
   4.2.9. MAPA “I” Shaped Parking Boxes: “I” shaped boxes are painted in white on the
   ground between the wingtips of the KC-135 parking spots on the south MAPA. Parking spots
   B7-B20 and A7-A21 all have “I” shaped parking boxes. There are no “I” shaped parking
   boxes on the North Ramp portion of the MAPA. The “I” boxes are designated safe zones for
   parking ground support equipment in close proximity to aircraft, while still maintaining the
   required safe distance of 25’ from any portion of the aircraft. “I” boxes provide
   equipment/vehicle operators a clearly visible, specific location that is within all required safe
   distances for operating in the proximity of parked and/or taxiing aircraft. See Attachment 13
   for a visual depiction.
      4.2.9.1. The side(s) of each “I” box directly adjacent to aircraft taxiing or towing in or
      out must remain free of all vehicles/AGE/equipment during aircraft movement in/out of
      the parking spot.
      4.2.9.2. Vehicles may drive through the center of the “I” as necessary to avoid
      interference with taxiing/towing aircraft. Vehicles/equipment will not be parked or left
      unattended in the driving center of “I” boxes, or between aircraft wing-tips.
      4.2.9.3. Vehicles may stop/park in the forward and aft corners of “I” boxes to avoid
      taxiing aircraft, pick up/drop off personnel/equipment, and to facilitate aircraft generation
      activities etc.

   8.2.2. AMOps will:
      8.2.2.1. Interview the driver to determine the cause of the event, the intended actions and
      the driver’s previous training.
      8.2.2.2. Contact the Tower to determine if the violation had an adverse impact on flight
      operations.
      8.2.2.3. Determine what type of violation occurred based on the information below.
          8.2.2.3.1. CMAV - Any occurrence involving an aircraft, vehicle, person or object
          entering any portion of the CMA without the approval of the Control Tower. An AF
          IMT 457 must be completed and submitted to 22 ARW/SE within 24 hours.
          8.2.2.3.2. Runway Incursions - Any occurrence at an aerodrome involving the
          incorrect presence of an aircraft, vehicle or person on the protected area of a surface
          designated for the landing and takeoff of aircraft. An AF IMT 651 must be completed
          and submitted to Wing Safety within 24 hours (see also AFI 91-202, US Air Force
          Mishap Prevention Program) if the incursion involved an aircraft having to take
          evasive actions (go around, reject takeoff, etc).
             8.2.2.3.2.1. The AOF/CC, Wing Safety and Wing ADPM will work as a team to
             assign all runway incursions an operational category (e.g., Operational Error, Pilot
             Deviation and Vehicle/Pedestrian) defined in Attachment 1 for trend analysis. The
             AOF/CC will ensure these classifications are annotated in the recommendation
             section of the AF IMT 457 or narrative section of the AF IMT 651.
          8.2.2.3.3. For the purpose of this instruction, the protected area is the same as the
          Controlled Movement Area. These incursions are further classified into three
          operational categories of which one or more will be assigned by the Airfield
          Manager. The categories are:

              8.2.2.3.3.1. Operational Error – A failure of the air traffic control system that
              results in loss of separation.
              8.2.2.3.3.2. Pilot Deviation – The action of a pilot that results in the violation of
              air traffic control instructions, AFIs and or FARs.
              8.2.2.3.3.3. Vehicle/Pedestrian Deviation – Any entry or movement on the
              controlled movement area by a vehicle (including aircraft operated by non-pilots)
              or pedestrian that has not been authorized by the Control Tower.
   8.2.3. For individuals that commit runway incursions, as part of the investigation, the Wing
   ADPM will inspect the unit airfield driving program. Emphasis will be placed on how the
   unit trained the individual and their compliance with this ADI. Final results will be reported
   to the Unit Commander.
   8.2.4. All runway incursions and controlled movement area violations will be briefed at the
   Airfield Operations Board.
8.3. Certificate Suspension/Surrender/Revocation.
   8.3.1. Repeat violations of safety or airfield driving rules, or an overall demonstrated lack of
   ability on the part of the certificate holder will result in a suspension of airfield driving
   privileges, surrender of the certificate, or revocation of the certificate.
   8.3.2. Suspension. Any supervisor in the driver’s chain of command may temporarily
   suspend a driver’s certificate. Unit Commanders, ADPMs (for unit assigned personnel), AM
   and SF personnel may temporarily suspend airfield driving privileges. All suspensions will
   be reported to the Unit ADPM and the DAFM. Airfield driving privileges are suspended for
   individuals who do not complete annual refresher training on the first day of the preceding
   month after the refresher is due. NOTE: Should driving privileges be revoked, the online
   driving program will be updated to reflect changes and the member will complete additional
   training provided by Unit and Wing ADPM.
   8.3.3. Surrender. All certificate holders will surrender their AF IMT 483 upon request by
   the Unit ADPM and/or AMOps personnel. Surrendered certificates will be forwarded to
   AFM and will be held until reinstatement/retesting.
   8.3.4. Revocation. AF IMT 483 may be revoked by the Unit ADPM, AFM or designated
   representative. Once revoked, another certificate will not be reissued without the explicit
   approval of the AFM.
   8.3.5. Members suspension will increase if they commit multiple violations within a 12
   month period as follows:
      8.3.5.1. First Violation: 30 day suspension of airfield driving privileges.
      8.3.5.2. Second Violation: 1 year suspension of airfield driving privileges.
      8.3.5.3. Third Violation: Permanent suspension of airfield driving privileges.
      8.3.5.4. Unauthorized CMA Crossing/Entry: This is the most serious violation.
      Unauthorized CMA crossing/entry will result in an automatic 6 month suspension of
      airfield driving privileges. A second CMA violation will result in permanent revocation
      of airfield driving privileges.
MCCONNELLAFBI13-213 23 DECEMBER 2013                                                        47


8.4. Reinstatement Procedures.
   8.4.1. Unit Commanders and Unit ADPMs will ensure that, prior to seeking reinstatement of
   airfield driving privileges, the individual concerned:
      8.4.1.1. Receives re-training on proper airfield driving procedures.
      8.4.1.2. Obtains the Unit Commander’s recommendation in writing to be reinstated and
      then gets final approval/disapproval from the AFM. If the individual’s on base privileges
      have been revoked/suspended, the Wing Commander is the approval authority for
      reinstating the member’s AF IMT 483. See section 1.2.2. for additional guidance.
      8.4.1.3. Is retested on the provisions of this instruction.
      8.4.1.4. Is issued a new AF IMT 483 by the AFM or designated representative.

                                           Chapter 9

  RADIO COMMUNICATIONS DISCIPLINE, TECHNIQUES AND PHRASEOLOGY

9.1. General.
   9.1.1. Radio communications are a critical link in the ATC system. The single, most
   important thought in communications with the Control Tower is understanding. It is
   essential to use the appropriate call sign in each radio communication with the control tower.
   9.1.2. Brevity is important, therefore, radio transmissions must be kept as brief as possible.
   However, tower controllers must know what you want to do before they can properly carry
   out their duties.
   9.1.3. Vehicles used frequently on the airfield should be equipped with UHF/VHF radio
   scanners set to scan the control tower UHF/VHF frequencies for better awareness of current
   airfield operations.
9.2. CMA Radio Discipline
   9.2.1. Vehicles operating in the CMA on a daily basis should have a permanent radio
   mounted in the vehicle. A handheld radio should be used as a backup or when
   communications is required outside the vehicle. NOTE: Conduct an operational test of the
   radio used to communicate with the control tower before entering the CMA.
   9.2.2. Vehicle drivers and/or pedestrians operating on the CMA must use a distinct call sign
   (e.g., Airfield 1, Chief 1, Sweeper 1, TA 1, etc.) coordinated by the Wing ADPM to avoid
   duplicating, confusing, or different agencies using similar names. All approved airfield call
   signs are listed in Attachment 14. NOTE: Do not use a call sign that is also a part of ATC
   phraseology such as ―Taxi1.
   9.2.3. All vehicles and personnel must establish and maintain two-way radio communication
   with the Control Tower and receive approval prior to entering the CMA. Once approved, the
   tower net must be monitored at all times until reporting off of the CMA.
   9.2.4. All vehicle operators will refer to the runways by their proper runway designation
   numbers when requesting access onto or across the runways.
   9.2.5. Do not request blanket approval when requesting authorization to enter the CMA.
   9.2.6. The words "clear" or “clearance” MUST not be used in communication with Tower.
   Exception: Vehicle operators may reply “Loud and Clear” in response to a Control Tower
   request for radio transmission quality or clarity.
9.3. Radio Techniques.
   9.3.1. Listen before transmitting. If someone else is talking, the keying of another
   transmitter will be ineffective and will probably override/block out the other receiver causing
   the other vehicle operator to repeat his or her call.
   9.3.2. Think before keying the transmitter. You must know exactly what you need to say
   before you say it.
MCCONNELLAFBI13-213 23 DECEMBER 2013                                                          49


  9.3.3. The microphone should be very close to your lips and, after pressing the microphone
  button, a slight pause may be necessary to ensure, the first word is transmitted clearly. Speak
  in a normal, conversational tone.
  9.3.4. When releasing the microphone button, wait a few seconds before calling again. The
  controller may be looking for you on the airfield, transmitting on a different frequency, or
  scanning the runway to enable your request.
  9.3.5. Be alert to the sounds or the lack of sounds in the receiver. Check your volume,
  recheck your frequency, and make sure that your microphone is not stuck in the transmit
  position. Frequency blockage can, and has, occurred for extended periods due to
  unintentional transmitter operation. This type of interference is commonly referred to as a
  “stuck mike,” and controllers may refer to it in this manner when attempting to correct the
  problem.
  9.3.6. Vehicle operators shall look both ways for aircraft landing/departing/taxiing prior to
  calling the Control Tower for clearance.
  9.3.7. To help eliminate miscommunication and possible compromise of safety, it is
  imperative that vehicle operators adhere to proper radio phraseology. NOTE: Use extreme
  caution when you hear the phrase “GO AHEAD”. Tower controllers use this to mean
  “STATE YOUR REQUEST”. It never means to “PROCEED”.
  9.3.8. The only words that authorize a vehicle to operate near or enter the CMA are
  “PROCEED” or “OPERATIONS APPROVED AS REQUESTED.”                           The word
  “PROCEED” may be accompanied with other words or phrases.
  9.3.9. The word “HOLD” will indicate disapproval of an operator’s request to cross or enter
  the CMA. “HOLD” may be accompanied by other words or phrases; however, if this word
  is used, the vehicle operator will NOT ENTER the movement area and will standby for
  further instructions. NOTE: Vehicle operators will repeat “HOLD” instructions verbatim
  when received from the control tower.
  9.3.10. All vehicle operators will ensure the Control Tower uses their exact call sign.
  Hearing the correct location of your vehicle but the wrong call sign does not give approval
  for your request. For example, if your vehicle’s call sign is “Red 5” and you request access
  onto the runway and the Control Tower gives approval for “Red 5 Alpha” to proceed on the
  runway, you DO NOT have approval to enter the runway until the tower states your correct
  call sign, even if it appears obvious to you that you are the only vehicle at that location.
  9.3.11. Prior to moving the vehicle, operators will repeat all instructions received from the
  Control Tower verbatim.
  9.3.12. When reporting off of the CMA, the vehicle operator will ensure that the Control
  Tower acknowledges their report that they are no longer on the CMA.
  9.3.13. If other vehicles are accompanying the vehicle requesting access to an area, the lead
  vehicle operator must say the word, “plus” and the number of vehicles that will be
  accompanying them, i.e. “Airfield three plus two.”
 50                                            MCCONNELLAFBI13-213 23 DECEMBER 2013


9.4. Phraseology.
   9.4.1. Vehicle operators must contact the Tower controller each and every time they proceed
   into or leave the CMA. When proceeding into a CMA, vehicle operators must advise the
   controller of three things: WHO you are, WHERE you are, and WHAT your intentions are.
   Vehicle operators must always acknowledge all communications so ground control and other
   persons know that the message was received. Vehicle operators must always give aircraft
   and ground control transmissions priority unless an emergency exists. VHF/UHF
   transmissions are reserved primarily for communications between aircraft and Control Tower
   personnel.
   9.4.2. Vehicles Requiring Access on the Runway Phraseology Example.
        9.4.2.1. Initial Request.
        9.4.2.2. Vehicle operator will state: “Tower, (Vehicle callsign)”
        9.4.2.3. Control Tower will state: “(Vehicle callsign), Tower”
        9.4.2.4. Vehicle operator will state: “Tower, (Vehicle callsign), at Taxiway E, request
        permission to operate on 01L.
   9.4.3. Control Tower will then state one of the following:
        9.4.3.1. “(Vehicle callsign), Tower, proceed on Runway 01L from Taxiway E , advise
        when off.”
        9.4.3.2. “(Vehicle callsign), Tower, hold short of Runway 01L at Taxiway E.”
   9.4.4. Once approved and before putting the vehicle into motion the vehicle operator will
   state one of the following:
        9.4.4.1. “Tower, (Vehicle Callsign), proceeding onto Runway 01L from Taxiway E, will
        advise when off.”
        9.4.4.2. “Tower, (Vehicle Callsign), operating as requested will advise when off.”
   9.4.5. Table 9.1., 9.2., 9.3., 9.4. and 9.5. provide more phraseology examples:

Table 9.1. Sample Runway Crossing Phraseology.
                                    "MCCONNELL TOWER AIRFIELD
Vehicle Operator:                   ONE"
                                    "AIRFIELD ONE, MCCONNELL

ATCT:                               01L/19R AT TWY E
MCCONNELLAFBI13-213 23 DECEMBER 2013                                                           51


   9.4.6. Always read back instructions verbatim before taking any action and allow time for
   correction, if misinterpreted. If you are unsure what the controller has transmitted, or if you
   do not understand an instruction, you MUST ask the controller to repeat it. Good
   communications only occur when each party knows and understands what the other is saying.

Table 9.2. Sample Read back Instructions.

                                  "AIRFIELD ONE UNDERSTANDS
VEHICLE OPERATOR:                 APPROVED TO CROSS RWY
NOTE: Airfield 1 visually scans   01L/19R AT TXY CHARLIE WILL

then proceeds across the          "AIRFIELD ONE, HOLDING
runway.                           SHORT AT TXY CHARLIE
                                  "MCCONNELL TOWER, AIRFIELD

ATCT:                             "AIRFIELD ONE, ROGER"
   9.4.7. If vehicle operators are issued hold short instructions, they are required to provide a
   read back to the Tower.

Table 9.3. Sample Hold Short Instructions.

                                  "AIRFIELD THREE PROCEED VIA

9.6. Phonetic Aviation Alphabet.
   9.6.1. Because some letters have similar sounds, like B and P, the international aviation
   industry uses the following words to reduce confusion. For example, Taxiway B would be
   referred to as Taxiway Bravo on the radio. Vehicle operators must know and use the
   following Phonetic Aviation Alphabet:

Table 9.5. Phonetic Aviation Alphabet.




9.7. Radio Communications Failure. The Control Tower’s light gun signals will be used in
the event radio communication is lost with a vehicle on the runway. In the event vehicles on the
runway do not respond to light gun signals the Tower will flash the runway lights on and off to
alert vehicle operators/pedestrians on the runway. This signal means to immediately exit the
runway and establish communication with the Tower. If not able to communicate with Control
Tower or AM via radio, use other means of communication such as a cellular phone (when
available). Report incidents to AM immediately.

include airfield construction/repairs, airfield driving program, ice/snow removal operations,
Bird/Wildlife control, etc. Procures, maintains, and produces information on safe operation of
aircraft through the national and international airspace system such as Flight Information
Publications, aeronautical charts and maps, Notice to Airmen (NOTAM), local airfield and
navigational aid status, and weather information. Process domestic and international flight plans.
Airfield Management Operations (AMOps)— Provides aircrews with flight plan processing
and planning services.
Airfield Operations Flight Commander (AOF/CC)— Responsible for the overall
operation/services provided by the Airfield Operations Flight in support of the wing flying
mission and in compliance with USAF and FAA guidelines.
Clear— ATC term used between pilots and air traffic controllers, not authorized for use by
personnel operating motor vehicles on the airfield.
Commercial Vehicle— A vehicle, which is owned or leased by a commercial firm, and used in
direct support of AMC airlift operations.
Controlled Movement Area (CMA)— As defined in Airfield Driving Instructions, any portion
of the airfield requiring aircraft, vehicles and pedestrians to obtain specific Air Traffic Control
approval for access (normally via two-way radio contact with the control tower). Controlled
Movement Areas include but are not limited to areas used for takeoff, landing and as required
taxiing of aircraft. NOTE: This definition is used in lieu of "movement area" as defined in the
FAA Pilot Controller Glossary. Runways, Checkerboard area (Taxiway D, E, F, G and R), any
paved surface inside a runway hold line, and any grass area inside 175’ on either side of the
runway edge requiring tower clearance for entry.
Controlled Movement Area Violation (CMAV) Event— An airfield infraction caused by
aircraft, vehicles, or pedestrians entering the control movement area without specific Control
Tower approval. This definition includes runway incursions and infractions caused by
MCCONNELLAFBI13-213 23 DECEMBER 2013                                                             59


communication errors. Refer to AFI 91-223 paragraphs 1.3.1.8. for reportable HATR reporting
procedures and 1.3.1.9. for reportable CMAV events.
Foreign Object Debris (FOD)— Any debris on the airfield that can cause damage to an aircraft.
A few examples are tools, plastic packing materials, rocks, discarded parts from maintenance
activities, etc. Any of these objects can shred internal parts if ingested into a jet engine and can
become deadly projectiles. FOD can create an extremely hazardous and costly situation during
taxiing, takeoff and landing; therefore, it is imperative that everyone on the airfield be alert to
FOD and removes it immediately.
Government Owned Vehicles (GOVs)— Vehicles that are owned or leased by the US
government.
Hold or Hold Short— Used by ATC to indicate you must stay where you are currently located
or for you to hold at the Runway Hold line/VFR hold line prior to receiving approval into the
CMA.
Hot Spot— A runway safety related problem area or intersection on an airfield. Typically, it is a
complex or confusing taxiway/taxiway or taxiway/runway intersection. A confusing condition
may be compounded by a miscommunication between a controller and a pilot, and may cause an
aircraft separation standard to be compromised. The area may have a history of surface incidents
or the potential for surface incidents.
Instrument Hold line— A designated boundary intended to protect the runway environment.
Found at the point where a taxiway and runway intersect. Instrument hold line is marked in
retro-reflective yellow paint.
Light Gun— A handheld directional light signaling device which emits a brilliant narrow beam
of white, green, or red light as selected by the tower controller. The color and type of light
transmitted can be used to approve or disapprove anticipated pilot actions where radio
communication is not available. The light gun is used for controlling traffic operating in the
vicinity of the airport and on the airport movement area.
MA Complex— Maintenance Group maintenance area, including all hangars and buildings
owned by the 22 MXG.
Major Command (MAJCOM)— For the purpose of this instruction, includes all USAF Major
Commands plus the Air National Guard Readiness Center, Air Force Reserve Command, Direct
Reporting Units, and Field Operating Agencies. MAJCOM also refers to the OPR for Airfield
Operations in this AFI.
Parking Ramp/Apron— Areas where aircraft are parked, loaded and unloaded and serviced
between flights. Vehicles and aircraft operate in close proximity in these areas, so it is vital to
maintain a safe distance between your vehicle and aircraft. Always yield to aircraft and never
drive under an aircraft or its wings. Slow speed and extreme caution are required in these areas.
Perimeter Road— A road around the runway perimeter designed to connect the access roads.
Privately Owned Vehicle (POVs)— A vehicle that is owned or leased by a private party.
Proceed— Authorization to begin/continue on approved routes.
Ramp— Either concrete or asphalt (depending on the weight of the aircraft and the sub-base of
the ground beneath) used to park aircraft or equipment.

Read Back— Repeat my message back to me.
Restricted Area— A restricted area contains protection level (PL) 1, 2, 3 resources. Personnel
requiring entry into a restricted area must have a Restricted Area Badge (RAB) with the
appropriate area open for the area being accessed or be escorted
Roger— I understand and have received all of your transmission.
Runway— A defined rectangular area on an airfield prepared for the landing and takeoff of
aircraft.
Runway Hold line— A designated boundary intended to protect the runway environment.
Found at the point where a taxiway and runway intersect.
Runway Incursion— Any occurrence at an aerodrome involving the incorrect presence of an
aircraft, vehicle or person on the protected area of a surface designated for the landing and
takeoff of aircraft. For the purpose of this instruction, the protected area is the same as the
CMA.
Say Again— Used to request a repeat of the last transmission. Usually specifies transmission
was not understood or received.
Taxilane— Ramp space between rows of parked aircraft used to maneuver aircraft to and from
parking spots and taxiways.
Taxiway— A paved surface for taxiing aircraft from parking ramp to runway.
Unit— For the purpose of this AFI, the term unit is equivalent to a Squadron, also known as the
basic unit in the USAF organizational structure. Squadrons are usually made up of several
flights (typically four), and commanded by a field grade officer.
Wake Turbulence— A phenomenon resulting from the passage of an aircraft through the
atmosphere. The term includes vortices, thrust stream turbulence, jet blast, jet wash, propeller
wash, and rotor wash both on the ground and in the air.
Without Delay— With a sense of urgency, proceed with approved instructions in a rapid
manner.
Words Twice— Communication is difficult. Please say every phrase twice.
Wilco— I have received your message, understand it, and will comply with it.
