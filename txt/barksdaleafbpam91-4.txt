This pamphlet was established for all personnel who receive formal nuclear surety training and
are subject to no-notice closed book testing. The 2d Bomb Wing Weapons Safety Office
prepared this self-study brochure to supplement existing nuclear surety training. It seeks to
promote nuclear weapons surety awareness and retention between unit nuclear surety training
events. It provides each individual with a readily available means of continuous refresher
training. Maintain official records in accordance with AFMAN 37-123 (to be AFMAN 33-363),
Management of Records, and dispose of them in accordance with the AF Records Disposition
Schedule found at https://afrims.amc.af.mil/. Contact supporting records managers as required
for approval. Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to the Office of
Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF IMT 847, Recommendation for Change of
Publication.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

        1.5.2.3. Operational control and use of nuclear weapons and nuclear weapon systems.
        1.5.2.4. Screening, selecting, and evaluating individuals who work with nuclear weapons
        and nuclear weapon systems.
1.6. Air Force Policy.
     1.6.1. Because of their cost and importance to national security, nuclear weapons are a
     critical national resource. They require special protection from hazards and threats because
     of their awesome destructive power and the grave consequences of an unauthorized
     detonation, either deliberate or accidental. Protecting nuclear weapons as a critical national
     resource and ensuring the safety of people and property are of paramount importance in
     nuclear weapons surety policies and procedures.
     1.6.2. Goal. The goal of the Air Force Nuclear Weapons Surety Program is to incorporate
     maximum nuclear weapons surety, consistent with operational requirements, from weapon
     system development to retirement from the inventory
     1.6.3. Safety Standards. The Air Force Nuclear Weapons Surety Program ensures personnel
     design and operate nuclear weapons and nuclear weapon systems to satisfy the safety
     standards in Department of Defense (DoD) Directive 3150.2, DoD Nuclear Weapon System
     Safety Program, December 23, 1996. The DoD safety standards are:
        1.6.3.1. Prevent nuclear weapons involved in accidents or incidents, or jettisoned
        weapons, from producing a nuclear yield.
        1.6.3.2. Prevent DELIBERATE prearming, arming, launching, or releasing of nuclear
        weapons, except upon execution of emergency war orders or when directed by competent
        authority.
        1.6.3.3. Prevent INADVERTENT prearming, arming, launching, or releasing of nuclear
        weapons in all normal and abnormal environments.
        1.6.3.4. Ensure adequate security of nuclear weapons, pursuant to the provisions of DoD
        Directive 5210.41.

                                            Chapter 2

     NUCLEAR WEAPONS TAMPER CONTROL AND DETECTION PROGRAMS

2.1. Access. Opportunity to tamper with or modify a nuclear weapon, critical nuclear weapon
system component or positive control/Nuclear Command and Control (NC2) material. A person
who is escorted by and/or under observation of individual(s) capable of detecting unauthorized
actions is not considered to have access. Ref: DoD 5210.42-R_AFMAN 10-3902.
NOTE: Be careful not to confuse the term "access" with the term "entry."
2.2. Entry. This term applies to the admission of personnel into established restricted areas or
No-Lone Zones. Ref: AFI 91-104 ACC I, Para 1.2.
2.3. Aircraft Main Structure. The entire fuselage, wings, and engines/engine pods.
2.4. No-Lone Zone. An area where the Two-Person Concept must be enforced because it
contains a nuclear weapon, nuclear weapon system, or certified critical component. Ref: AFI
91-101 Attach. 1. Examples include the interior of a cabinet, work or maintenance bay, the
entire structure of building, specific components of aircraft in flight, and in some instances, the
interior of a van or vehicle containing two person control materials. Before entering a no-lone
zone, brief personnel that the Two-Person Concept applies. Supervisors must ensure that
individuals are aware of the location of all no-lone zones, location of critical components within
the no-lone zone where they will perform their duties, emergency procedures, and methods for
reporting violations and hazards. Ref: AFI 91-104 ACC I, Para 1.2.2.1.
2.5. Nuclear Weapons System. A combat delivery vehicle with its nuclear weapon or weapons
and associated support equipment, noncombat delivery vehicles, facilities, and services. Ref:
AFI 91-101 Attach 1.
2.6. Nuclear Weapon. A complete assembly (i.e., implosion type, gun type, or thermonuclear
type) in its intended ultimate configuration which, upon completion of the prescribed arming,
fusing, and firing sequence, is capable of producing the intended nuclear reaction and release of
energy.
2.7. Critical Component. A component of a nuclear weapon system that if bypassed, activated,
or tampered with could result in or contribute to deliberate or inadvertent authorizing, prearming,
arming, or launch of a combat delivery vehicle carrying a nuclear weapon, or the targeting of a
nuclear weapon to other than its planned target. HQ AFSC/SEW designates critical components.
Ref: AFI 91-101, Attach 1. Critical components include but are not limited to:
   2.7.1. The entire B-52 aircraft will be treated as a critical component when: (1) The aircraft
   is loaded with a nuclear weapon(s); or (2) All pre-load functions have been completed and
   the aircraft is ready for nuclear weapon upload or mate, even if weapons are not positioned at
   the aircraft. Ref: AFI 91-101 ACC I, Attach 1.
   2.7.2. Hardware, programs, media firmware, software, or code components that have been
   identified by the HQ AFSC/SEW as critical.
2.8. Two-Person Concept. Designed to make sure that a lone individual cannot perform an
incorrect act or unauthorized procedure on a nuclear weapon, nuclear weapon system, or
certified critical component. Ref: AFI 91-104 Para 1.1.
 8                                              BARKSDALEAFBPAM91-4 17 MARCH 2008


     2.8.1. Each organization that has a mission or function with nuclear weapons, nuclear
     weapons systems, critical components, must enforce the Two-Person Concept. Ref: AFI 91-
     104 Para 1.2.
2.9. Sole Vouching Authority (SVA). The SVA identifies individuals wishing to gain entry to
a no-lone zone, verifies authorization for entry to the no-lone zone, and validates need for entry
into the no-lone zone. There will be only one SVA at a time in any close-in security area. Ref:
AFI 91-104 ACC I, Para 1.2.3.2.1.
2.10. Sealing. Seals help to verify that no one has tampered with or accidentally activated a
certified critical component.
     2.10.1. Sealing Methods. Authorized sealing methods include:
        2.10.1.1. Safety Wiring and Sealing. Two types of seals are authorized using this
        method; seals composed of a malleable material and used with a crimping device and
        controlled die in order to form an impressed distinctive mark or unique identifier and
        seals with self-locking, non-reversible feature with a singularly unique serial
        number/alpha, color control system. Both types of seals are used with safety wire
        connected to certain switches, covers, handles, or levers. Breakage or alteration of the
        wire or seal provides evidence/detection of possible unauthorized acts, access, or
        tampering. Use this method only in no-lone zones.
        2.10.1.2. Tamper Detection Indicators (TDI). In this method you place an approved TDI
        so that it will indicate when someone has activated or had access to the interior of a
        certified critical component. Once the TDI is installed, evidence of tampering is visible
        to the naked eye or can be detected through the use of special equipment.
     2.10.2. Verify seal integrity immediately after installation. Aircrew will verify the integrity
     of the cockpit seals, including the verification of the distinctive die marking, during initial
     weapon system acceptance and after each authorized access to the cockpit. Verify the
     condition and integrity of the safety wire and seals after a change of accountability or
     responsibility for the weapon system. Both parties effecting the change will be present.
     2.10.3. The Operational Group and Maintenance Group commander will ensure all flying
     squadron operations and maintenance personnel directly involved in flightline nuclear
     operations are able to identify the current distinctive operational and training die markings.
     Identify any diagram of the distinctive markings UNCLASSIFIED CONTROLLED
     NUCLEAR INFORMATION.
2.11. Two-Person Concept Violations. Declare a Two-Person Concept violation when a lone
individual in a no-lone zone has the opportunity to tamper with or damage a nuclear weapon,
nuclear weapon system, or certified critical component. All Two-Person Concept violations
must be reported and investigated. Report violations of the Two-Person Concept, including
emergency response, through the unit command post to the commander. A Two-Person Concept
team will ascertain if unauthorized acts were performed, inspect involved certified critical
components, verify their status, and reestablish the integrity of the system. Accomplish
applicable visual and functional checks for components that have such procedures established.
Ref: 91-104 ACC I, Para. 1.4.
BARKSDALEAFBPAM91-4 17 MARCH 2008                                                              9


NOTE: A momentary breach of the no-lone zone is not a violation if no individual had the
opportunity to perform an incorrect act or unauthorized procedure. In performing certain tasks,
team members may lose sight of each other or be far apart. One team member may be briefly out
of sight to perform a specific task if it is unsafe or physically impossible to maintain constant
observation.
   2.11.1. Authorized Deviations. You may deviate from the Two-Person Concept when:
       2.11.1.1. The nuclear weapon system safety rules specifically authorize a deviation.
       2.11.1.2. An emergency presents an immediate threat to the safety of personnel or the
       security of a nuclear weapon, nuclear weapon system, or certified critical component.
       War plan exercises are not considered emergencies.
   2.11.2. Tamper. To knowingly perform an incorrect act or unauthorized procedure
   involving a nuclear weapon, nuclear weapon system, or certified critical component.
2.12. Individual Two-Person Team Members Must:
   2.12.1. Be capable of promptly detecting an incorrect act or unauthorized procedure. Upon
   detection of an incorrect procedure or unauthorized act immediately notify proper authorities
   of the deviation.
   2.12.2. Be familiar with applicable safety, security, and nuclear weapons surety
   requirements of the task.
   2.12.3. Be certified under PRP. Two persons who are interim certified will not make up a
   Two-Person Concept team.
   2.12.4. Have successfully completed nuclear surety training in accordance with AFI 91-101
   ACC I.
   2.12.5. Be designated to perform the required task.
   2.12.6. Team members may have different Air Force Specialty Code or skill levels as long
   as the above requirements are met. The composition of the team is based solely upon the
   task to be performed in the no-lone zone.
2.13. Pre-Task/Pre-Departure Briefing. Personnel dispatched to perform a task in a No-Lone
Zone will be briefed before departing their work center that the Two-Person Concept applies.
Maintenance supervisors will ensure that two qualified personnel are dispatched and that they are
fully briefed in the Two-Person Concept. The supervisors will ensure personnel are briefed on
which areas are No-Lone Zones, location of critical components within the no-lone zone where
they will perform their duties, emergency procedures, and methods for reporting violations and
hazards. Ref: AFI 91-104 ACC I, Para 1.2.2. and 1.2.3.
2.14. Entry. Initial entry into a No-Lone Zone will always require, as a minimum, an
authorized Two-Person Concept Team. The sole vouching authority grants entry into the no-
lone zone after verifying the proper composition of the team and task to be performed.
   2.14.1. It may be necessary to withdraw the Two-Person Concept team or change the
   original composition to meet the requirements of new or additional tasks. Coordinate
   changes with the team chief. NOTE: Keep the number of personnel authorized in a no-lone
   zone to a minimum consistent with the tasks.
 10                                             BARKSDALEAFBPAM91-4 17 MARCH 2008


2.15. After Initial Entry. After initial entry of an authorized team into a No-Lone Zone,
authorized individuals may subsequently enter provided: Ref: AFI 91-104 ACC I, Para 1.2.3.2.
   2.15.1. The SVA identifies individuals wishing to gain entry to a no-lone zone, verifies
   authorization for entry to the no-lone zone, and validates need for entry into the no-lone
   zone.
   2.15.2. The team is knowledgeable of the task the individual will perform and is capable of
   monitoring performance, or the individual is to assist the team in the task they are
   performing.
2.16. Control of Personnel. After entry into a No-Lone Zone, the supervisor or team chief for
each authorized team is specifically charged with the control of all personnel occupying the
confines of his particular area of activity within the No-Lone Zone, as well as directing or
supervising the task being performed. In other words, several Two-Person Concept teams may
work in different areas within a No-Lone Zone, or a weapons maintenance bay, and each
supervisor or senior member for each authorized team is responsible for all personnel within
their particular area. Ref: AFI 91-104 ACC I, Para 1.2.3.
2.17. Emergency Conditions. While normal day-to-day operations deny the entry of a lone
individual into a No-Lone Zone, there are peacetime emergency conditions that may require the
entry of a single individual. Examples of such emergency conditions would be an aircraft crash
on the flight line with fire in the immediate vicinity of alert aircraft; or a fire in any designated
No-Lone Zone. These conditions could require action by a single individual to prevent further
damage or removal of hazardous items from the area, providing first aid, fire fighting
procedures, etc. Actions of this nature are a violation of the Two-Person Concept Policy and
must be reported accordingly. However, due to the grave consequences of taking no action,
actions of this nature are expected and condoned. Ref: AFI 91-104, Para 1.5.
BARKSDALEAFBPAM91-4 17 MARCH 2008                                                             11

    WEAPON SYSTEM SAFETY RULES FOR B-52 NUCLEAR WEAPON SYSTEM

4.1. Applicability. General safety rules apply to all nuclear weapons and nuclear weapon
systems. General safety rules primarily apply safety policy and shall be included as part of the
Air Force’s safety rules package. Safety rules always apply, even during war. Deviations from
the safety rules are permitted only in the event of an emergency. Ref: AFI 91-111, Section B.
4.2. Troubleshooting. Ref: AFI 91-107 Section D.
   4.2.1. Do not use nuclear weapons to troubleshoot faults.          Use only equipment and
   procedures certified according to AFI 91-103.
   4.2.2. When a fault occurs on a loaded nuclear weapons system (a combat delivery vehicle
   with one or more nuclear weapons mechanically and electrically connected in a normal
   operational configuration), the primary consideration is to ensure that the system is safe and
   weapons are not subjected to inadvertent power applications or control signals.
   4.2.3. When a nuclear system fault occurs on a loaded nuclear combat aircraft, cease all
   operations and take appropriate actions to identify, locate and correct the fault. Use only
   approved Technical Order (T.O.) procedures.
       4.2.3.1. For critical faults, isolate the affected nuclear weapon from the fault before
       initiating troubleshooting. Ways to isolate weapons include:
           4.2.3.1.1. Downloading the weapons.
           4.2.3.1.2. Disconnecting the electrical signal lines to the weapon and mechanically
           safing the release system.
           4.2.3.1.3. Disconnecting the electrical signal line to both the weapons and the release
           system.
   4.2.4. For faults that the engineering MAJCOM has determined to be noncritical, the nuclear
   weapons may remain electrically mated during troubleshooting operations. However, every
   attempt should be made to isolate the weapons unless isolating the weapons causes a severe
   operational impact. Identify faults unmistakably before declaring them noncritical.
4.3. Weapon Safety Verifications. Ref: AFI 91-111, paragraph 12.
4.4. Basic Aircraft Configuration. Ref: AFI 91-111, paragraph 13.
4.5. Ground Operations Involving Nuclear Loaded Aircraft. Ref: AFI 91-111 Para. 17.
   4.5.1. Maintain nuclear weapons and aircraft in their basic configuration. Ref: AFI 91-111
   Paragraph 17.
   4.5.2. Electrically verify safe status of the weapons with the applicable aircraft stores
   management system after weapons upload.
   4.5.3. After completing the upload and postload functions, apply power to an uploaded
   nuclear weapon only for authorized permissive action link (PAL) operations, command
   disable (CD) operations, or to monitor the weapon.
 16                                               BARKSDALEAFBPAM91-4 17 MARCH 2008

      4.5.5.2. Performing maintenance.
      4.5.5.3. Conducting practice alerts, exercises, inspections, evaluations, taxiing, and
      flying operations.
   4.5.6. Engine starts and engine runs must:
      4.5.6.1. Be kept to a minimum.
      4.5.6.2. Be done by at least two authorized and qualified aircrew members. (Two-Person
      Concept applies)
   4.5.7. Aircraft towing:
      4.5.7.1. Keep towing to a minimum.
      4.5.7.2. Two authorized and qualified individuals must be in the cockpit during towing.
      (Two-Person Concept applies)
   4.5.8. Taxi.
      4.5.8.1. Keep taxiing to an absolute minimum consistent with operational requirements.
      Taxi aircraft, if necessary, only for practice alerts, exercises, inspections or evaluations,
      flying operations, and increased alert postures.
      4.5.8.2. At least two authorized and qualified aircrew members must be in the aircraft
      during taxiing. (Two-Person Concept applies.)

                     INTRINSIC RADIATION (INRAD) PROGRAM

7.1. Definitions.
   7.1.1. INRAD - INtrinsic RADiation - Ionizing radiation emitted through weapons surface or
   directly from exposed components of nuclear weapons.
   7.1.2. Ionizing Radiation - Electromagnetic or particulate radiation capable of causing
   ionization in its passage through matter. Alpha, beta, gamma, X-rays, and neutrons are
   examples of ionizing radiation.
   7.1.3. ALARA - (As Low As Reasonably Achievable) A major philosophy of current
   radiation protection practice which requires that every reasonable effort be made to keep
   radiation exposures as far below the dose limits as practical when technical, economic, and
   social factors are taken into account.
   7.1.4. Personal Dosimeter - A device used to monitor the ionizing radiation exposure of an
   individual.
   7.1.5. AFI 91-108 - Governs the Air Force Nuclear Weapons Intrinsic Radiation Safety
   Program. It applies to Air Force units with a nuclear mission and to personnel concerned
   with maintenance, security, onload and offload, transport, or storage of nuclear weapons and
   associated nuclear material and components.
7.2. INRAD Program.
   7.2.1. Implementation of the INRAD safety program and the ALARA concept must not
   compromise weapons safety, security, reliability, or operational mission considerations.
   7.2.2. The INRAD safety program implements the ALARA concept by:
       7.2.2.1. Keeping exposure of persons to ionizing radiation ALARA consistent with
       operational requirements and ensuring that individuals are not intentionally exposed to
       INRAD levels exceeding the maximum permissible dose.
       7.2.2.2. Reducing or eliminating INRAD hazards as much as possible at the engineering
       design stage of a weapon system.
       7.2.2.3. Educating female personnel to the risks of ionizing radiation to the unborn and
       monitoring pregnant employees who continue to perform duties involving exposure to
       INRAD.
       7.2.2.4. Training AF personnel who are exposed to INRAD to be aware of the potential
       radiation hazards in their work place and to protect themselves from those hazards.
   7.2.3. Program managed by the Base Bio-Environmental Engineering/Radiation Safety
   Officer (RSO).
7.3. Supervisor Responsibilities.
   7.3.1. Schedule personnel to receive initial and annual radiation safety training and
   document the training in unit and individual records.

                        BARKSDALE AFB RESTRICTED AREAS

8.1. Sensored Aircraft Parking Area (SAPA).
   8.1.1. The Entry Control Point (ECP) is located on the southwest side of the SAPA. Entry is
   also authorized through the alert taxiway at the south end of the SAPA during PL 2 & 3 only.
   Entry on a daily basis to the SAPA is governed by the PL3 rules. They require a Barksdale
   Air Force Base (BAFB) issued AF Form 1199 (line badge) with area #10 open on it.
8.2. Close-in Security Areas (CISA).
   8.2.1. Within this area the Two-Person Concept applies to all personnel. This area is
   governed by the regulations concerning Close-In Security (CIS). If you do not have the area
   determined locally open on your line badge you are not authorized to act as a member of a
   Two-Person Concept team within this area.
NOTE: CIS requirements do not waive the regulations governing the Two-Person Concept
team. In order for personnel to be capable of acting as a member of a CIS team they must be
Two-Person Concept qualified.
8.3. Mass Generation Area (MGA) Entry Procedures.
   8.3.1. At the onset of a generation order, security forces will establish the MGA. This area
   will be upgraded to PL1. Entry will be controlled at the entry control points. A single badge
   procedure will be used and supported by an identification and certification technique. The
   Barksdale AFB issued line badge with an open #12 will be required. Temporary Duty
   personnel must be on a properly authenticated Entry Authorization List (EAL).
8.4. Generated B-52 Aircraft. The Close-in Sentry verifies the authority of all personnel
requesting entry to PL1 aircraft and the CISA personnel who are not listed on the ACC Form
4028 must be vouched into the CISA by a person having vouching authority ("X" beside their
name in "Designated Rep" block.) Once the aircraft commander or designated representative
vouches the Two-Person Team into the CISA, the aircraft commander or representative may
leave the confines of the CISA, but remain in a position to monitor operations/ maintenance
tasks.
   8.4.1. When Positive Control Material is placed on board a B-52 aircraft, the Two-Person
   Control Team criteria must be satisfied before personnel enter the aircraft. Entry into the
   aircraft is an owner/user responsibility.
   8.4.2. Two-Person Concept applies to CISAs. During pre-flight operations, when only one
   ground crew chief is assigned to the aircraft and the aircrew is in the aircraft, the crew chief
   must maintain visual contact with the aircrew, except for periods of time to accomplish
   necessary duties. Security personnel supporting PL1 loaded aircraft monitor personnel inside
   the CISA. When a lone individual is observed in the No-Lone Zone, immediately stop the
   person, remove them from the area, report the incident to Central Security Control (CSC),
   declare a helping hand, and detain the person until arrival of the response force.
