This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 21-1, Air and Space
Maintenance, and fulfils the requirements of Air Force Instruction (AFI) 21-101, Aircraft and
Equipment Maintenance Management, 26 July 2010, Paragraph 14.6.3.1 to develop a local
Individual Aircraft Tracking Program (IATP)/Aircraft Structural Integrity Program (ASIP)
Operating Instruction (OI). It applies to all units assigned to the 100th Air Refueling Wing (100
ARW). It does not apply to Air Force Reserve Command or Air National Guard. Ensure that all
records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance
with Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance
with Air Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule
(RDS) located at https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rds/rds_series.cfm                 Refer
recommended changes and questions about this publication to the Office of Primary
Responsibility (OPR) using Air Force (AF) Form 847, Recommendation for Change of
Publication; route AF Forms 847 from the field through the appropriate functional chain of
command. See Attachment 1 for Glossary of References and Supporting Information. Requests
for waivers must be submitted with justification to publication OPR.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This instruction has been revised and must be reviewed in its entirety. It updates the Technical
Order (TO) reference from TO 1C-135-101 to TO 1C-135-38, and removes the requirement for
ASIP/IATP PROJOs to perform spot checks and forward negative finds to section supervisor for

correction. The contents of the ASIP/IATP continuity binder to be maintained by QA has been
modified, and additional requirements for the 100th Operations Group CC have been added.
Finally, further instructions on the AF Form 76, C/KC-135 Aircraft Assessment Data, have been
added for the AMXS Debrief Section.
1. Procedures. The 100 ARW does not have any ASIP aircraft assigned and will follow
procedures IAW Technical Order 1C-135-38, -Aircraft Structural Integrity Program and this
instruction for IATP.
     1.1. The minimum requirements for this instruction IAW AFI 21-101 Para 14.6.3.1., are as
     follows and the reference paragraph is in parentheses:
        1.1.1. (14.6.3.1.1.) Identification of maintenance activities responsible for changing and
        submitting storage media: 100 ARW KC-135R aircraft have no ASIP storage media. The
        AFTO Form 76, is used to collect structural data for use by depot engineers. Procedures
        for documenting and submitting this form are located in TO 1C-135-38 and throughout
        this Instruction.
        1.1.2. (14.6.3.1.2.) Appointment of ASIP monitors: See Para 2.1.1. below.
        1.1.3. (14.6.3.1.3.) Procedures to support ASIP at deployed locations:         Units will
        comply with the same procedures in this instruction while deployed.
        1.1.4. (14.6.3.1.4.) ASIP Training requirements, method of documentation, and
        responsibility for providing training to technicians responsible for maintaining ASIP
        systems (e.g. changing tapes, submitting ASIP data sheets) and aircrew debriefing: There
        are no ASIP systems installed on the KC-135R. See Para 2.4., below for aircrew
        debriefing training.
2. Responsibilities.
     2.1. The 100th Maintenance Group (MXG) Commander (CC) will:
        2.1.1. Appoint in writing a Primary and Alternate ASIP/IATP Project Officer (PROJO),
        from within the 100 MXG Quality Assurance (QA) section. The PROJOs will also serve
        as the ASIP/IATP monitors.
     2.2. The ASIP/IATP PROJOs will:
        2.2.1. Comply with responsibilities in AFI 21-101 Para 14.6.3. as required.
        2.2.2. Perform semi-annual self-inspection on the ASIP/IATP program IAW Mildenhall
        Instruction 90-102, Command Guidance Self Inspection Program.
        2.2.3. Maintain the ASIP/IATP continuity binder in QA. The continuity binder will
        contain at least the following:
            2.2.3.1. Tab 1: QA section continuity book review record.
            2.2.3.2. Tab 2: The ASIP/IATP PROJO appointment letter.
            2.2.3.3. Tab 3: A copy of this OI marked “For Reference Only.”
            2.2.3.4. Tab 4: QA Superintendents record of annual review of ASIP/IATP program.
            2.2.3.5. Tab 5: Any additional contents at the discretion of the PROJO.

     PCMCIA card and forwarded to the TEMS monitor. TO IC-135-2-11-40-7, Maintenance
     Instructions – Flight Monitoring, USAF Aircraft Models KC-135R/T states the following:
     2.4.2. AFTO Form 76.
         2.4.2.1. An automated AFTO Form 76, is used to record data from each aircraft
         flight. The FDR records the following parameters for creation of an automated
         AFTO Form 76:
            2.4.2.1.1. In-flight refueling door open (Air Refueling Receiver aircraft only)
            2.4.2.1.2. Air-refueling boom retracted

            2.4.2.1.4. Speed brakes
            2.4.2.1.5. C/KC-135 Aircraft Structural Assessment AFTO Form 76
            2.4.2.1.6. Autopilot altitude hold discrete
            2.4.2.1.7. Engine start switches (4 each)
  2.5. Once the flight has been completed, the AFTO Form 76 information is downloaded (as
  part of the super set of data) to a PCMCIA card from the DDTU and then downloaded to the
  Comprehensive Engine Management System (CEMS) for distribution. The manual filling
  out of the AFTO Form 76 is to continue until such time as notified by 827 ACSG/550 ACSS
  or AMC.”
