8.1.1.1. (Added) Kadena AB aircrews are authorized to use ePubs in flight unless specifically
prohibited by their AFI 11-2MDS, Vol 3. Units will comply with the requirements of paragraph
8.2.7.
8.2.7. (18WG) All devices utilized to view ePubs in flight must be MAJCOM approved.
PACAF/A3TV has a list of approved/tested devices on their SharePoint.
8.2.7.5.4. (Added) All aircrew members will carry and use the appropriate paper checklists.
Paper flight manuals will be the primary document used in the event of an emergency. The use
of electronic flight manuals in-flight will be for reference purposes only.
8.3. (18WG)       Electronic Flight Manuals Program. Kadena AB has two primary lead
commands in its Operation Group, AMC and ACC. If possible and applicable, unit programs
should attempt to emulate their lead command’s program to the extent it maximizes
standardization and automation while still ensuring compliance with current PACAF guidance.
The ePubs program is intended to standardize the numerous locally produced options currently in
use throughout Kadena while ensuring compliance with AFNETOPs, technical directives, and
STINFO regulations.
8.3.1. (Added) Publication procurement should come from the highest level source, preferably
a lead command if available.
8.3.2. (Added) If a unit is going to implement an electronic flight manual program, a plan
must be approved by 18 OG/OGV before implementation. This plan will include the items in
8.2.7.3, as well as the following:
8.3.2.1 . (AddedProcedures for ensuring source publications are the most up to date.
8.3.2.2. (Added) Procedures to ensure home station aircrew have access to the most current
publications, and TDY aircrew are aware of the latest changes. This will include a process to
ensure aircrew members have the most current version prior to any flight or flight-related ground
training events.
8.3.2.3. (Added)    A list of publications and Technical Orders required to be carried by each
crew position.
8.3.2.4. (Added) Procedures of OG TODO oversight, if OGV deems necessary
8.3.3. (Added) Once a unit has an OGV approved plan, it should be outlined in their 11-
2MDS, Vol 3 supplement to ensure standardization.
11.2. (Added) The 18th Operations Group Standards & Evaluations (18 OG/OGV) Technical
Order Distribution Office (TODO) will have oversight of each squadron’s technical order
libraries and will be responsible for notification of shipment arrivals. Each squadron will
appoint a TODO and Technical Order Distribution Account custodian (TODA). The squadron
TODO/TODA will be responsible for ordering publications and maintaining accuracy of TO
library through ETIMS. The 18th OG TODO will perform a semiannual check of each
squadron’s tech order library against ETIMS. Minimum aircrew technical order requirements
(electronic media or paper copy) are shown in Table 11.1 (Added).
