This Headquarters Operating Instruction clarifies policy and procedures for funding visits of foreign nationals to the
United States which are governed by AFI 65-603, Official Representation Funds (ORF) Guidance and
Procedures, applicable to centrally managed and controlled distinguished visitor invited tours, visits, and
entertainment at the expense of Department of Defense (DoD). It applies to organizational elements of the HQ
USAF (HAF).

1. Overview: This instruction prescribes procedures for expenditures of ORF for foreign liaison and community
relations within HAF. Expenditures of ORF are for the purpose of maintaining the standing and prestige of the
United States (U.S.) by extending official courtesies to certain officials and dignitaries of the U.S. and foreign
countries. The Secretary of the Air Force (SECAF) has delegated authority for administering the expenditure of
ORF to the Administrative Assistant (SAF/AA). Unless otherwise provided in AFI 65-603, or by separate policy,
the expenditure of ORF requires advance approval of SAF/AA.

2. Request for Funds:

2.1. All requests for funds must be processed electronically via Staff Summary Sheet (SSS), coordinated through
the HAF/RM and approved by SAF/AA.

    2.1.1. If the request for funds originates within the Air Staff, it should be submitted via SSS from the Chief or
    Deputy Chief of the organization to HAF/RM for coordination, and then routed in accordance with established
    Air Staff guidance for AF/CC or AF/CV approval to have the event. After AF/CC or AF/CV approves the
    event, the package should be submitted to SAF/AA for approval to fund the event.

    2.1.2. If the request originates within the Secretariat, it should be submitted via SSS from the Chief or
    Deputy Chief of the organization to HAF/RM for coordination and then to SAF/AA for approval.
2.2. The SSS must include funds estimate, list of official party and itinerary. The SSS must also include the name
and social security number of the person recommended to be paying agent for the funds. After SAF/AA approval,
the SSS is returned to HAF/RM for publication of the paying agent orders.

    2.2.1. Requests for funds will be as thorough as possible and estimates submitted by category of
    expense (food, lodging, in-flight expense, transportation, entertainment, etc.). (See example at Attachment 1.)

         2.2.1.1. Approval is based on a thorough line-item-by-line-item review of the funding request; therefore,
         any changes to individual line items must be pre-approved by SAF/AA.

         2.2.1.2. For events where the cost estimate is less than $300, paying agent orders will not be issued. In
         lieu of recommended paying agent, SSS must identify the point of contact responsible for the event and
         provide a memorandum (with attachments) to SAF/AA along with all receipts associated with the event and
         a request for payment, including payee address.

3. Instructions for Paying Agents
