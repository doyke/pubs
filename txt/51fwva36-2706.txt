The Equal Opportunity program works to promote a positive human relations climate, free from sexual
harassment and unlawful discrimination based on race, color, national origin, religion or sex (also age
(40+), physical or mental disability, reprisal and/or genetic information for DoD civilian employees).
Our goal is for every individual to have the ability to rise to the highest level of success based on their
own performance and merit. We provide methods of clarification and dispute resolution to active-duty,
activated and civil service members, dependents and retirees who believe they are victims of unlawful
discrimination or sexual harassment. We also provide education/assistance to help personnel
identify/prevent negative human relation factors.
