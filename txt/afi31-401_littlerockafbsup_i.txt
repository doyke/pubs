(LITTLEROCKAFB) This supplement implements and extends the guidance of AFI 31-401,
Information Security Program Management, 1 November 2005. AFI 31-401 must be read in
conjunction with this supplement. The provisions of this supplement are applicable to 19th
Airlift Wing staff agencies and associated units for whom a host tenant agreement exists and
applicable tenant units, US Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard units, or members located
within the confines of Little Rock Air Force Base. This supplement will be used in conjunction
with DoD 5200.1-R, Information Security Program. Ensure that all records created as a result of
processes prescribed in this publication are maintained In Accordance With (IAW) Air Force
Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of IAW with the Air Force
Records Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule (RDS)
located at https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61a/afrims/afrims/. Refer recommended changes and
questions about this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF

through the appropriate functional‟s chain of command. This publication may be supplemented
at any level, but all Supplements must be routed to the OPR of this publication for coordination
prior to certification and approval.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This interim change reflects new requirements for management of the Information Security
Program at all echelons; transfers responsibility for Unclassified Controlled Nuclear Information;
reflects the transfer of Information Security Program Manager (ISPM) duties and responsibilities
from the Chief, Security Forces or installation security official to the Chief of Information
Protection at MAJCOM and installation levels and codifies staff office changes from that action;
updates locations possible for overnight delivery of Secret information in urgent cases; updates
references and deletes terms not used in the text; updates glossary of references and supporting
information (Attachment 1); updates transmission procedures for unclassified controlled nuclear
information (Attachment 2); deletes use of United States Postal System registered mail or
Express Mail to transfer Secret or Confidential material (Attachment 4). An asterisk (*)
indicates newly revised material.

(LITTLEROCKAFB) This supplement has been completely revised due to Little Rock AFB
MAJCOM change. This supplement was originally written to implement and extend guidance of
AETC_Sup1 (5 June 2007) to AFI 31-401. 314 AW relinquished command to 19 AW effective
1 October 2008. This supplement should be reviewed in its entirety. Attachment 1 (Little Rock)
adds local Glossary and Reference material. Attachments 8 through 15 are also added to provide
local guidance.

                                            Chapter 1

                         POLICY AND PROGRAM MANAGEMENT

1.1. Policy. It is Air Force policy to identify, classify, downgrade, declassify, mark, protect, and
destroy its classified and unclassified information and material consistent with national policy.
This general policy statement also applies to unclassified controlled information (Attachment 2)
under the purview of relevant statutes, regulations and directives [Reference DOD 5200.1-R,
C1.1.]
1.2. Philosophy. Protecting information is critical to mission accomplishment. The goal of the
Information Security Program is to efficiently and effectively protect Air Force information by
delegating authority to the lowest levels possible; encouraging and advocating use of risk
management principles; focusing on identifying and protecting only that information that
requires protection; integrating security procedures into our business processes so that they
become transparent; and, ensuring everyone understands their security roles and responsibilities.
1.3. Program Management. The strength of the Air Force Information Security Program is in
its infrastructure. The infrastructure is important because it facilitates effective communication of
our security policies and procedures to those performing the Air Force mission. With the support
of commanders at all levels, this is accomplished predominantly through our Information
Security Program Manager (ISPM) and security manager system. Both play an integral role in
ensuring unit personnel know and understand their role in protecting classified information
against unauthorized disclosure [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C1.2.]
1.3. (LITTLEROCKAFB)The provisions of this supplement are applicable to 19th Airlift
Wing (AW) staff agencies and associated units for whom a host tenant agreement exists
and applicable tenant units, US Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard units, or
members located within the confines of Little Rock Air Force Base.
   1.3.1. Senior Security Official. The Administrative Assistant to the Secretary of the Air
   Force (SAF/ AA) is designated the Air Force Senior Security Official responsible for
   ensuring implementation of the Information Security Program.
   1.3.2. Air Force Program Manager. The Director, Information Protection (SAF/AAP) is
   responsible for policy, resource advocacy, and oversight of this program.
   1.3.3. Commanders of Major Commands (MAJCOM), Field Operating Agencies (FOAs),
   Direct Reporting Units (DRUs), and Installations. These commanders are responsible for:
       1.3.3.1. Establishing information security programs.
       1.3.3.2. Identifying requirements.
       1.3.3.3. Executing their programs to comply with this policy.
   1.3.4. The installation Chief of the Information Protection (IP) Office (IPO) or MAJCOM
   Director, Information Protection is designated the ISPM at each Air Force installation or site.
   Air Force Chiefs of Information Protection:

   inspections/reviews. In addition, MAJCOM Information Protection Offices (IPO) will
   conduct oversight and assistance visits in the form of either an Information Security Program
   Review (ISPR) or Staff Assistance Visit (SAV) to subordinate IPOs at least every 36 months.
   MAJCOM IPO staffs are encouraged to explore oversight options to minimize resource
   impact.
       1.4.1.1. ISPR.
          1.4.1.1.1. An ISPR is an assistance-oriented oversight visit for the information
          security programs performed by an ISPM, or designated representative(s) on a
          subordinate ISPM or security manager. It is a non-rated review for policy and
          program effectiveness to benchmark processes/products, identify problem areas and
          corrective actions. A key component of the ISPR is an assessment of the effectiveness
          of the information security training program.
          1.4.1.1.1. (LITTLEROCKAFB) All participating agencies will receive an
          Information Security Program Review (ISPR). These reviews will incorporate
          information, personnel, and industrial (if applicable) security programs and will either
          be conducted annually or bi-annually.
          1.4.1.1.2. Air Force on-base contractor visitor groups will be integrated into the host
          installation‟s Information Security Program unless the mission, operational

          Security Program Operating Manual (NIS- POM).
          1.4.1.1.3. The ISPM will provide the commander or equivalent, and staff agency
          chief the ISPR results in writing.
   1.4.2. Base level ISPMs will conduct ISPRs on an annual basis. EXCEPTION: An
   extension to 18 months may be granted by the ISPM for units that have demonstrated highly
   effective, discrepancy free programs during the previous ISPR. ISPRs/SAVs may be
   conducted every two years for activities or units that do not store classified information.
   1.4.3. Security Self-Inspections: Unit commanders or equivalents, and staff agency chiefs
   involved with processing or holding classified information ensure personnel conduct
   semiannual security self-inspections to evaluate information security program effectiveness.
   EXCEPTION: Activities with a small volume of classified material may work with the
   ISPM to develop an oversight schedule consistent with risk management principles.
AFI31-401_LITTLEROCKAFBSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010                                                      15


      1.4.3.1. Unit commanders or equivalents, and staff agency chiefs will appoint an
      individual, in writing, other than the unit security manager to conduct a semiannual
      security inspection.
      1.4.3.1. (LITTLEROCKAFB) Unit semiannual self-inspections will be conducted
      twice a year. The commander must appoint in writing an individual to perform semi-
      annual security self-inspections (SSI) (See Attachment 10 (Added). The unit security
      manager or alternate may oversee the inspection, but may not conduct it. The security
      manager will forward the semiannual self-inspection report to 19 AW/IP upon
      completion. The ISPM may count the annual program review as one of the unit
      semiannual self-inspections if the last self-inspection program review was conducted
      within the last six months. When able, commanders should appoint personnel to conduct
      the semiannual self-inspections who have experience in the handling and safeguarding of
      classified information and/or possess a comprehensive understanding of the unit‟s
      functions and layout of the facilities.
      1.4.3.2. A program review may satisfy the requirement for one of the semiannual self-
      inspections.
   1.4.4. SAF/AAP, Chief of Information Protection will visit MAJCOMs to review their
   information protection and associated security programs every 36 months.

      RD using DoE Form 5631.20, Request for Visit or Access Approval (see paragraph
      5.5.1.2). They may delegate this authority to the level they deem necessary for
      operational efficiency. Officials delegated the authority will sign in the “For” block on
      behalf of the access granting official. Air Force personnel may obtain DoE Form5631.20
      from the DoE activity they are visiting or at the DoE Forms web site.
          1.5.1.1.1. Activities must notify SAF/AAP through command IP channels of changes
          to the list of certifying officials as they occur. When doing so, they must also provide
          the position title, activity and office symbol of the affected authority. NOTE: When
          the change involves an activity name change, access-granting officials will sign forms
          authorizing access using the current activity name and a note that identifies the

   under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) exemptions 2-9, may be designated “For
   Official Use Only.” No other material shall be considered FOUO. FOUO is not authorized as
   an anemic form of classification to protect national security interests. [Reference DOD
   Regulation 5400.7/AF Supplement, DOD Freedom of Information Act Program, C4.1.1] The
   FOIA exemptions are detailed in DOD Regulation 5400.7/AF Supplement, Chapter 3.

                  ORIGINAL AND DERIVATIVE CLASSIFICATION

2.1. Original Classification Authority (OCA) [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C2.2.]
   2.1.1. The Secretary of the Air Force serves as the OCA and may further delegate this
   authority.
   2.1.1. (LITTLEROCKAFB) There is no original classification authority within the 19
   AW, 314 AW or 189 ANG.
   2.1.2. The process for delegating OCA authority is as follows:
      2.1.2.1. Secretary of the Air Force delegates Top Secret, Secret, and Confidential
      authority.
      2.1.2.2. SAF/AA delegates Secret and Confidential authority.
      2.1.2.3. All requests for the delegation of OCA will be forwarded through command IP
      channels to SAF/AAP, Director of Information Protection, 1720 Air Force Pentagon,
      Washington, DC 20330-1340, for processing.
          2.1.2.3.1. Address requests for original Top Secret authority to the Secretary of the

          carrying out a unique mission with responsibility for one of the eight subject areas
          prescribed by EO 12958, as amended, may be designated as an OCA.
          2.1.2.3.4. OCA is assigned to a position, not a person. OCA will not be delegated
          other than identified in paragraphs 2.1.2.1 and 2.1.2.2 above. However, deputies,
          vice commanders, chiefs of staff and similar other subordinates of an OCA are
          empowered to act as an OCA when they assume the duty position of an OCA in an
          “acting” capacity and have certified in writing that they have been trained in OCA
          responsibilities and classification principles in addition to the basic security training
          on the proper safeguarding of classified information and the criminal, civil, and
          administrative sanctions that may be brought against an individual who fails to
          protect classified information from unauthorized disclosure before exercising this
          authority.
      2.1.2.4. All requests will contain the full position title, functional office symbol, a
      detailed explanation of why the position requires OCA and an estimate of the annual use
      of the delegated authority.

       2.1.3.2. See the Information Protection Directorate Community of Practice (CoP) web
       site for OCA training requirements
2.2. Original Classification. [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, Chapter 2 and Interim Information
Security Guidance, April 16, 2004.]
   2.2.1. Original classification is the initial decision that an item of information could be
   expected to cause damage to the national security if subjected to unauthorized disclosure, and
   that the interests of the national security are best served by applying the safeguards of the
   Information Security Program to protect it. This decision may be made only by persons who
   have been specifically delegated the authority to do so, have received training in the exercise
   of this authority, and have program responsibility or cognizance over the information
   [Reference: DOD 5200.1-R, C2.1.]
       2.2.1.1. Before an original classification decision is made, it must be determined that
       classification guidance is not already available in the form of classification guides, plans
       or other memoranda.
       2.2.1.2. OCAs are accountable to the Secretary of Defense for their classification
       decisions.
       2.2.1.3. In those rare situations where the OCAs‟ decision must be rendered verbally due
       to the priorities of an on-going operation, written confirmation will be issued within
       seven days.
       2.2.1.4. OCAs must notify users when there are changes to an original decision.
       2.2.1.5. OCAs shall be prepared to present, as required, deposition and expert testimony
       in courts of law concerning classification of national security information and be
       prepared to defend and justify their original decisions.
   2.2.2. Classification may be applied only to information that is owned by, produced by or
   for, or is under the control of the United States Government. Information may be considered
   for classification only if it concerns one of the categories specified in Section 1.4 of EO
   12958, as amended.
2.3. Derivative Classification. The act of incorporating, paraphrasing, restating, or generating
in a new form information that is already classified, and marking the newly developed material
consistent with the markings of the source information. The source information ordinarily
consists of a classified document or a classification guide issued by an OCA. Within DOD, all
cleared personnel can perform derivative classification.
   2.3.1. Originating Agency‟s Determination Required (OADR). OADR is no longer an
   approved marking and should not be contained in any originally classified documents that
   have been created after October 14, 1995.
   2.3.2. X1 through X8 are no longer approved markings and should not be contained in any
   originally classified documents that have been created on or after September 22, 2003.
   2.3.3. When creating a derivatively classified document and using a source document that
   contains OADR or X1 through X8, the derivative classifier will place the following
   information in the Declassify On line:
    DECLASSIFY ON: Source marked OADR (or X1 thru X8, whatever is applicable)
 20                                     AFI31-401_LITTLEROCKAFBSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010


         Date of source: 5 October 1993 (date of source document)

   2.3.4. These documents will be subject to review for declassification 25 years after the date
   of the source document.
2.4. Classification Prohibitions and Limitations.
   2.4.1. Under no circumstances shall information be classified in order to (1) conceal
   violation of law, inefficiency, or administrative error; (2) prevent embarrassment to a person,
   organization, or agency; (3) restrain competition; or (4) prevent or delay the release of
   information that does not require protection in the interest of the national security [Reference
   EO 12958, as amended, Section 1.7, DOD 5200.1-R, and Interim Information Security
   Guidance 16 April 2004].
   2.4.2. The OCA having jurisdiction over the subject matter determines if information
   requested under the FOIA or the mandatory declassification review (MDR) provisions of EO
   12958, as amended, should be declassified [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C2.4.3.5.]
2.5. Classification Challenges [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C4.9.]
   2.5.1. If holders of information have reason to believe that the information is improperly or
   unnecessarily classified, they shall communicate that belief to their commander or
   equivalent, staff agency chief, security manager, or supervisor.
   2.5.2. Send formal challenges to classification, in writing, to the OCA with jurisdiction over
   the information in question.
   2.5.3. Challenges to reclassification decisions are sent through command IP channels to
   SAF/AAP
   2.5.4. All classified information undergoing a challenge or a subsequent appeal will remain
   classified until a final resolution is reached.
2.6. Security Classification/Declassification Guides.
   2.6.1. Required Elements. A security classification/declassification guide (see Attachment 7
   for sample format) is the written record of an original classification decision and appropriate
   declassification instructions and should be issued as early as practical in the life cycle of the
   classified system, plan, program or project. It shall, at a minimum:
       2.6.1.1. Identify the subject matter of the classification guide.
       2.6.1.2. Identify the OCA by name or personal identifier, and position.
       2.6.1.3. Identify an agency Point of Contact (POC) (name, office symbol, mailing
       address, organizational e-mail address, DSN/commercial phone numbers) for questions
       regarding the classification guide.
       2.6.1.4. Provide the date of issuance or last review.
       2.6.1.5. State precisely the categories or elements of information to be declassified, to be
       downgraded, or not to be declassified.
AFI31-401_LITTLEROCKAFBSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010                                                      21


     2.6.1.6. State which classification level applies to each element of information, and,
     when useful, specify the elements of information that are unclassified (NOTE: only one
     level of classification will be annotated for each element of information.)
     2.6.1.7. State a concise reason for classification which, at a minimum, cites the
     applicable classification category or categories in Section 1.4 of EO 12958, as amended.
     2.6.1.8. State, when applicable, special handling caveats.
     2.6.1.9. Prescribe declassification instructions for each element of classified information.
     2.6.1.10. Identify any related files series that have been exempted from automatic
     declassification pursuant to Section 3.3(c) of EO 12958, as amended.
     2.6.1.11. To the extent a guide is used in conjunction with the automatic declassification
     provisions in Section 3.3 of EO 12958, as amended, state precisely the elements of
     information to be exempted from declassification to include:
         2.6.1.11.1. The appropriate exemption category listed in section 3.3(b), and, when
         citing the exemption category listed in section 3.3(b)(9), specify the applicable
         statute, treaty or international agreement; and
         2.6.1.11.2. A date or event for declassification IAW section 1.5.
  2.6.2. OCA Responsibilities.
     2.6.2.1. It is the responsibility of the OCA to publish classification/declassification
     guides to facilitate the proper and uniform derivative classification and declassification of
     their information. NOTE: In some cases, OCAs may determine that publishing
     classification guidance in other forms is more effective, e.g., program protection plans,
     system protection guides, AFIs. In these cases, the applicable publication will be
     considered the guide and the publishing requirements in paragraph 3.3 still apply.
     2.6.2.2. Each OCA will revise (IAW paragraph 2.6.2.4 below) their security
     classification guides to include an advisory statement in the Release of Information
     section:
         2.6.2.2.1. Release of program data on the World Wide Web. Extreme care must be
         taken when considering information for release onto publicly accessible or
         unprotected World Wide Web sites. In addition to satisfying all of the aforementioned
         approval provisions, owners and/or releasers of information proposed for such release
         must ensure that it is not susceptible to compilation with other information to render
         sensitive or even classified data in the aggregate. The search and data mining
         capabilities of Web technology must be assessed from a risk management
         perspective. Information intended for publication on publicly accessible or
         unprotected web sites must be cleared for public release prior to publication
         according to AFI 35-101, Public Affairs Policy and Procedures. If there are any
         doubts, do not release the information.
     2.6.2.3. All guides will be reviewed by the servicing Foreign Disclosure Office before
     final approval.
     2.6.2.4. Classification/declassification security guides shall be reviewed and updated, as
     circumstances require, but at least once every five years. NOTE: Due to the major
22                                   AFI31-401_LITTLEROCKAFBSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010


     changes implemented by EO 12958, as amended, all current Air Force
     classification/declassification guides will be reviewed no later than 31 December 2005,
     and every five years thereafter.
  2.6.3. Publishing Requirements.
     2.6.3.1. All guides which extend classification beyond 25 years must be approved by the
     Interagency Security Classification Appeals Panel (ISCAP). Once the OCA has signed
     the guide, the document will be sent to SAF/AAP who will forward it to the ISCAP for
     approval.
     2.6.3.2. The OCA will report publication of or changes to security classification/
     declassification guides to the Administrator, Defense Technical Information Center
     (DTIC) using DD Form 2024. DTIC will require an electronic copy of the guide.
     2.6.3.3. OCAs must also forward a hard copy of the applicable publication or change to:
         2.6.3.3.1. HQ AFHRA/RSA, 600 Chennault Circle, Maxwell AFB AL 36112-6424.
         2.6.3.3.2. SAF/PA, 1690 Air Force Pentagon, Washington, DC 20330-1690.
     2.6.3.4. All guides (to include any changes) will also be forwarded electronically to
     SAF/AAP        at     SAF.AAP.workflow@pentagon.af.mil         and     AFDO        at
     AFDO.Workflow@pentagon.af.mil in PDF and Microsoft Word format.
  2.6.4. Electronic Location of Guides. SAF/AAP will maintain the master list of all Air
  Force classification/declassification guides and will provide guides made available on the
  MOSIAC SIPRNET Community of Practice (CoP). Guides are also located on the DTIC
  web site. To access the DTIC web site you must have a DTIC account. The URL for this is
  http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/registration.
  2.6.5. Nuclear Weapons Classification Policy. The DOD and the Department of Energy
  (DoE) issue joint security classification guidance for information relating to nuclear
  weapons. The Air Force issues security classification policy for information relating to
  nuclear weapons. Most of these products are classified and users will require the appropriate
  security clearance before accessing them. Users may obtain copies of Joint DOD/DoE
  classification guides through DTIC at a cost. Users forward requests for copies of these
  guides to SAF/AAP (1720 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1340) through
  command IP channels. Requests must include the name, address, and phone number of the
  activity POC, and the POC‟s level of access. IPs will validate this information before
  submitting the requests to SAF/AAP. For all other Air Force or other agency guides, go
  direct to the originator. Users refer to DOD 5200.1-I, DOD Index of Security Classification
  Guides, to determine what other guides relating to nuclear weapons classification guidance
  are needed. DOD 5200.1-I can be obtained from DTIC.

                                            Chapter 3

               DECLASSIFYING AND DOWNGRADING INFORMATION

3.1. Declassification and Downgrading Officials. Within the Air Force, only OCAs have the
authority to declassify or downgrade classified information.
3.2. Declassification. Note: Exemptions identified in this chapter are found in ISSO Directive
Number 1, Section 2001.21(3)(i).
   3.2.1. Originally Classified Documents. The declassification decision determines the
   duration of protection [Reference EO 12958, as amended, Section 1.6.(a)(4) and ISOO
   Directive Number 1, Section2001.12.]. At the time an item of information is classified,
   original classifiers will determine which of the following four declassification instructions
   will be used, selecting whenever possible, the declassification instruction that will result in
   the shortest duration of classification.
       3.2.1.1. A date or event less than 10 years from the date of the document; or, if unable to
       identify such a date or event;
       3.2.1.2. A date 10 years from the date of the document; or
       3.2.1.3. A date greater than 10 and less than 25 years from the date of the document; or
       3.2.1.4. A date 25 years from the date of the document.
   3.2.2. Derivatively Classified Documents. The “Declassify on” line must include one of the
   following:
       3.2.2.1. The date or event up to 25 years, as noted on the source document; or
       3.2.2.2. Source marked OADR, date of source (cannot be a date after October 1995);
       3.2.2.3. Source marked X1-X8, date of source (cannot be a date after September 2003);
       3.2.2.4. 25X1 through 25X9, and a specific date or event for declassification; or
       3.2.2.5. 25X1-human (the only category that does not require a date or event follow it).
3.3. Exceptions. RD/FRD [Reference 10 CFR 1045.1 Subpart A]. Documents containing RD
or FRD are excluded from automatic declassification and do not require a declassification date.
RD must be reviewed by the DoE prior to release. DoE and DOD must jointly review documents
containing FRD prior to release.
3.4. Automatic Declassification. IAW EO 12958, as amended, Section 3.3, all Air Force
activities that possess classified information that is of permanent historical value and is 25 years
old or older should have completed a declassification review of these documents by 31 Dec
2006.
   3.4.1. The Air Force Declassification Office (AFDO) has published the Air Force
   Declassification Plan that provides the framework for Air Force compliance with Section 3.3
   of EO 12958, as amended. It pertains to all classified Air Force records that are 25 years old
   or older as of 31 December 2006, and have been determined under Federal law to have
   permanent historical value. The Air Force Declassification Plan is posted at the AFDO web
   site (http://www.afdo.hq.af.mil/Plan.htm). It is critical that records management and
 24                                     AFI31-401_LITTLEROCKAFBSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010


   information security personnel work together to ensure that requirements of both are met on
   classified records that are going to be sent to the National Archives or Federal Records
   Center.
   3.4.2. All classified records shall be automatically declassified on 31 December of the year
   that is 25 years from the date of its original classification, unless it falls in one of the
   exemption categories (25X) listed in Section 3.3(b) of EO 12958, as amended.
   3.4.3. The 25X categories cannot be used unless the specific information has been approved
   through the ISCAP process. This is usually done in the form of a security
   classification/declassification guide. (See paragraph 2.6 and Attachment 7). The Air Force
   has an approved list of exemption categories (listed in the Air Force Declassification Plan);
   however, the specific item must still be annotated in the security classification/
   declassification guide before it is used on derivatively marked documents. For original
   classification decisions, no 25X marking, other than “25X1-human,” is permitted on the
   “declassify on” line. All originally classified documents will contain either a date or event
   less than 10 years or a date from 10 to 25 years. The only exception is the marking “25X1-
   human.” This marking may be used when the disclosure of the information could be expected
   to reveal the identity of a confidential human source or human intelligence source. This is the
   only 25X marking that does not require a date or event for declassification to be cited with
   the 25X marking.
3.5. Mandatory Review.
   3.5.1. Mandatory review requests must identify the information requested with enough
   specificity to allow for location of the records with a reasonable amount of effort.
   3.5.2. Send all requests for MDR to 11 CS/SCSL (MDR), 1000 Air Force Pentagon,
   Washington DC 20330-1000.
   3.5.3. Send appeals to MDR decisions through 11 CS/SCSL (MDR) to SAF/AA, the Air
   Force Appellate Authority for MDRs.
3.6. Systematic Review for Declassification. Activities will set up an annual schedule for
conducting systematic declassification reviews for the following records:
   3.6.1. Records of permanent historical value prior to their twenty-fifth birthday. These
   records will be reviewed and appropriate action taken by 31 Dec of the same year that is 25
   years from the date of its original classification.
   3.6.2. Other records. Activities will set up a reasonable schedule for conducting
   declassification reviews for all other classified records.
3.7. Referrals. A referral is information that is subject to the provisions of EO 12958, as
amended, Section 3.3, Automatic Declassification, and ISOO Directive No. 1, Section 2001.34,
and has been referred to, within, or outside the Air Force for review. AFDO is the focal point for
processing Air Force referrals. Detailed information regarding the referral process can be found
in the Air Force Declassification Plan.
3.8. Public Release. When information is declassified, it is not releasable to the public until it
has been approved for release through the security review process IAW AFI 35-101, Chapter 15.
The same holds true for declassified or unclassified information that will be placed on an Internet
site that can be accessed by the public.
AFI31-401_LITTLEROCKAFBSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010                                                     25


3.9. Downgrading. Downgrading of information to a lower level of classification is appropriate
when the information no longer requires protection at the originally assigned level, and can be
properly protected at a lower level. Any official who is authorized to classify or declassify the
information and has authority over the information may downgrade information.
 26                                      AFI31-401_LITTLEROCKAFBSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010


                                             Chapter 4

                                           MARKINGS

4.1. General. Air Force personnel who originally and derivatively classify information will
mark those products according to DOD 5200.1-R and the ISOO Marking Booklet. Material other
than ordinary paper documents, e.g., e-mail transmitted over a secure network, must have the
same information either marked on it or made immediately available to holders by other means.
[Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C5.1.]
4.1. (LITTLEROCKAFB)Classified custodians will be responsible for ensuring all
documents, media, and other products stored or maintained within their area of
accountability are properly marked IAW applicable guidelines. All recent derivative
classified produced by that office will be marked IAW current directives. Older derivative
classified and/or classified material marked by other agencies may not meet current guidelines
and do not need to be remarked. However, all material must be marked in such a way as to
ensure the material is readily identified as classified.
4.2. Required Markings. Classified documents are required to have the following markings:
   4.2.1. The overall classification of the document.
   4.2.2. The agency, office of origin, and date of the document.
   4.2.3. The office or source document that classified the information.
         4.2.3.1. If it is originally classified, the document will reference the office.
         Example: CLASSIFIED BY: SAF/AAP.
         4.2.3.2. If a document is derivatively classified, it will reference the source document or
         the security classification/declassification guide. Example: DERIVED FROM: HQ
         USAF/A3/5 Memo dated 12 Jan 2008. Subj: Funding Problems.
   4.2.4. The reason for classification. Each originally classified document shall bear a concise
   statement of the reason for classification, determined by the original classifier. [Reference
   DOD 5200.1-R, C5.2.4.] The classification categories are listed in EO 12958, as amended,
   Section 1.4; DOD5200.1-R Interim Information Security Guidance, Chapter 2, Para 1.
   Example: REASON: 1.4(e).
         4.2.4.1. If a document is derivatively classified, the “REASON” is not required to be
         carried over to the derivative document.
      4.2.5. Declassification instructions, and any downgrading instructions that apply. Example:
      DECLASSIFY ON: 15 MARCH 2010
         4.2.5.1. If marking material that falls within one of the 25-year exemption categories, the
         correct marking will be as follows (NOTE: only derivatively classified documents will
         carry a 25X marking, with the exception of 25X1-human, which is allowed on originally
         classified documents):
                             DECLASSIFY ON: 25X5, 15 February 2010
   4.2.6. Page and portion markings to identify the specific classified information in the
   document and its level of classification. When marking a document that is derivatively
AFI31-401_LITTLEROCKAFBSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010                                                     27


   classified, ensure all markings and caveats are carried over from the source document to the
   derivative document.
   4.2.7. Control notices and other markings that apply to the document.
   4.2.8. When a document has been declassified or downgraded, the following markings shall
   be applied:
      4.2.8.1. The word “Declassified” or the new classification if being downgraded.
      4.2.8.2. The authority for the action (the OCA‟s office symbol and the identification of
      the correspondence or classification instruction that required it).
      4.2.8.3. The date of declassification or downgrading action.
      4.2.8.4. The overall classification markings that appear on the cover page or first page
      shall be marked through with a straight line. If downgraded, the new classification will be
      written in.
      4.2.8.5. Page and portion markings will be remarked as required.
   4.2.9. Notebooks, binders, folders, etc. containing classified documents will be
   conspicuously marked with the highest classification of the material contained. Affix the
   appropriate overall classification marking or classified cover sheet to the front and back of
   the notebook, binder, folder, etc.
4.3. Special Control and Similar Notices. [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C5.2.9.]
   4.3.1. Working Papers. Working papers are documents and material accumulated or created
   in the preparation of finished documents and material. Working papers containing classified
   information will be:
      4.3.1.1. Dated when created.
      4.3.1.2. Marked with the highest classification of any information contained in the
      document and annotated “WORKING PAPER”.
      4.3.1.3. Destroyed when no longer needed.
      4.3.1.4. Protected IAW the assigned classification.
      4.3.1.5. Marked in the same manner as a finished document at the same classification
      level when transmitted outside the facility or if retained for more than 180 days from the
      original creation date.
   4.3.2. Communications Security (COMSEC). See AFI 33-211, Communications Security
   (COMSEC) User Requirements, for guidance on marking COMSEC documents and media.
   4.3.3. Technical Documents. See AFI 61-204, Disseminating Scientific and Technical
   Information, for guidance on marking and disseminating technical documents. [Reference
   DOD 5200.1-R, paragraph C5.2.9.8. and DODD 5230.24, Distribution Statements on
   Technical Documents.]
   4.3.4. SAPs. Documentation and information may be identified with the Phrase “Special
   Access Required” and the assigned nickname, codeword, trigraph, or digraph. See AFI 16-
   701, Special Access Programs, for additional guidance on SAP documents.
 28                                    AFI31-401_LITTLEROCKAFBSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010


   4.3.5. Restricted Data/Formerly Restricted Data (RD/FRD). [Reference 10 CFR 1045.1,
   Subpart A.)
        4.3.5.1. Documents containing RD shall be marked:
                                      RESTRICTED DATA

           “This material contains Restricted Data as defined in the Atomic Energy Act of
           1954. Unauthorized disclosure subject to administrative and criminal
           sanctions.”
        4.3.5.2. Documents containing FRD shall be marked:
                                FORMERLY RESTRICTED DATA

      “Unauthorized disclosure subject to administrative and criminal sanctions. Handle as
      Restricted Data in foreign dissemination. Section 144.b, Atomic Energy Act, 1954
   4.3.6. For Official Use Only (FOUO). See chapter 4 of DOD 5400.7/AF Supplement.
4.4. NATO. NATO documents should be marked in compliance with AFI 31-406, Applying
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Protection Standards, USSAN Instruction 1-69,
United States Implementation of NATO Security Procedures, and C-M(2002)49, Security Within
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Any new policies, principles, standards, and
procedures contained in C-M(2002)49 and it‟s supporting directives take precedence, where they
conflict, over the guidelines expressed in USSAN 1-69, dated 21 April 1982.
4.5. Other Foreign Government Information (FGI).
   4.5.1. Classification designations for FGI often do not parallel U.S. classification
   designations. Moreover, many foreign governments and international organizations have a
   fourth level of classification that generally translates as "Restricted," and a category of
   unclassified information that is protected by law in the originating country and is provided on
   the condition that it will be treated "in confidence." A table of U.S. and foreign government
   classification markings can be found in DOD 5200.1-R, Appendix 6.
   4.5.2. Other foreign government classified documents shall be marked in English to identify
   the originating country and the applicable U.S. classification designation. If a classification
   designation has been applied to a foreign document by the originator, and it is the applicable
   U.S. English language designation, only the identity of the originating country need be
   applied to the document. Examples:
      A German document marked "Geheim" would be marked: DEU SECRET.
      A UK document marked "SECRET" would be marked: GBR SECRET.

   4.5.3. Foreign government documents that are marked with a classification designation that
   equates to Restricted, and unclassified foreign government documents that are provided to a
   DOD Component on the condition that they will be treated "in confidence," shall be marked
   to identify the originating government and whether they are Restricted or provided "in
   confidence." Additionally, they shall be marked "CONFIDENTIAL - Modified Handling".
   Example:
AFI31-401_LITTLEROCKAFBSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010                                                    29


               A French document marked "Diffusion Restreinte” would be marked:

                        FRENCH RESTRICTED INFORMATION
                                         Protect as:
                          CONFIDENTIAL - Modified Handling
      4.5.3.1. (Ref: DOD 5200.1-R, para C6.6.3.) In order to ensure the protection of FGI
      provided in confidence (e.g., foreign government "Restricted," or foreign government
      unclassified information provided in confidence), such information must be classified
      under EO 12958, as amended. Provide a degree of protection to the FGI at least
      equivalent to that required by the foreign government or international organization that
      provided the information. If the foreign protection requirement is lower than the
      protection required for U.S. CONFIDENTIAL information, the following requirements
      shall be met:
          4.5.3.1.1. The information shall be provided only to those individuals who have a
          need-to-know and access is required by official duties.
          4.5.3.1.2. Individuals given access shall be notified of applicable handling
          instructions.
          4.5.3.1.3. Documents shall be stored so as to prevent unauthorized access.
4.6. Marking of Foreign Government and NATO Information In DOD Documents.
   4.6.1. When used in DOD documents, FGI must be marked to prevent premature
   declassification or unauthorized disclosure. To satisfy this requirement, U.S. documents that
   contain FGI shall be marked on the cover or first page, "THIS DOCUMENT CONTAINS
   (indicate country of origin) INFORMATION." In addition, the portions shall be marked to
   identify the classification level and the country of origin, e.g., (GBR-C); (DEU-C). If the
   identity of the foreign government must be concealed, the cover or first page of the document
   shall be marked, "THIS DOCUMENT CONTAINS FOREIGN GOVERNMENT
   INFORMATION," and applicable paragraphs shall be marked FGI together with the
   appropriate classification (FGI-S). The identity of the foreign government shall be
   maintained with the record copy, which must be appropriately protected.
   4.6.2. The "Derived From" line shall identify the U.S. as well as foreign classification
   sources. If the identity of the foreign government must be concealed, the "Derived From" line
   shall contain the marking "Foreign Government information." In that case, the identity of the
   foreign government will be maintained with the record copy and protected appropriately. A
   U.S. document shall not be downgraded below the highest level of FGI contained in the
   document or be declassified without the written approval of the foreign government that
   originated the information. Recommendations concerning downgrading or declassification
   shall be submitted through the DOD entity that created the document to the originating
   foreign government.
   4.6.3. DOD classified documents that contain extracts of NATO classified information shall
   be marked as follows on the cover or first page: "THIS DOCUMENT CONTAINS NATO
   CLASSIFIED INFORMATION." Portions shall be marked to identify the NATO
 30                                    AFI31-401_LITTLEROCKAFBSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010


   information (e.g., NS). When NATO or other foreign government RESTRICTED
   information is included in otherwise unclassified DOD documents, the following statement
   shall be affixed to the top and bottom of the page containing the information: “This page
   contains (indicate NATO or country of origin) RESTRICTED information”. The
   restricted portions shall be marked (e.g., (NR) (GBR-R). The cover, (or first page, if no
   cover) of the document shall contain the following statement: "This document contains
   NATO RESTRICTED information not marked for declassification (date of source) and
   shall be safeguarded in accordance with USSAN 1-69".
   4.6.4. Other foreign government classified documents should be marked in English to
   identify the originating country and the applicable U.S. classification designation.
   4.6.5. Foreign government documents that are marked with a classification designation that
   equates to RESTRICTED, and unclassified foreign government documents that are provided
   to a DOD component, should be marked to identify the originating government and whether
   they are restricted or provided in confidence.
4.7. Audio and Video Tapes. Personnel responsible for marking and maintaining original
classified audio and video tapes that document raw test data do not need to include
footers/headers showing the applicable classification markings. However, the required
classification markings must be placed on the outside of the container and reel. All copies made
from the original tapes must include headers/footers that show the applicable classification
markings. This will help ensure that valuable historical test data is not inadvertently erased
during the classification marking process. [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C5.4.]
4.8. Removable Information Systems Storage Media. Use SF Form 706, Top Secret ADP
Media Classification Label; SF 707, Secret ADP Media Classification Label; SF Form 708,
Confidential ADP Media Classification Label; SF 710, Unclassified Label, SF Form 711, ADP
Data Descriptor Label, on removable information systems storage media. These are available
through the Air Force Publications Distribution System. [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, Paragraphs
5-407 and 5-409a-b.]
   4.8.1. Many new removable information systems storage media are of size and shape that
   precludes application of the standard forms. Such media storing classified information must
   be permanently marked to display the highest classification of stored information.
   4.8.2. Designated Approving Authorities (DAA) have the authority to impose restrictions
   upon, and prohibit the use of, government owned removable information systems storage
   media for classified systems or networks. DAA approved restrictions will outline clearing, or
   destruction, procedures for unauthorized devices found in areas where classified processing
   takes place. Personally owned information systems storage media are prohibited in areas
   where classified is processed.
   4.8.3. The inherent risk of loss of small storage devices should be considered before using
   them for storing or transporting classified information. Procedures to reduce the potential for
   accidental loss must be included in local operating instructions. Include a review of these
   procedures in the semi-annual self-inspection and ISPRs.
4.9. Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI). [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C5.4.11.]
AFI31-401_LITTLEROCKAFBSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010                                                         31


   4.9.1. See AFI 14-302, Control, Protection, and Dissemination of Sensitive Compartmented
   Information, for Air Force policy on intelligence information.
   4.9.2. The Special Security Office (SSO) is the focal point for release and dissemination of
   SCI. The Director of Central Intelligence Directive (DCID) 6/6, Security Controls on the
   Dissemination of Intelligence Information and DCID 6/7, Intelligence Disclosure Policy
   provide criteria for release of intelligence to foreign officials.
4.10. Authorized for Release To (REL TO) Markings. [Reference DUSD(/)I Memo 27 Sep
2004, subject: Security Classification Marking Instructions.]
   4.10.1. “REL TO” identifies classified information that an originator has predetermined to
   be releasable based on guidance provided by an Air Force specifically designated foreign
   disclosure official or has been released, through established foreign disclosure procedures
   and channels, to the foreign country(ies)/international organizations indicated.
   4.10.2. “REL TO” cannot be used with “Not Releasable to Foreign Nationals” (NOFORN)
   on page markings. When a document contains both NOFORN and REL TO portions,
   NOFORN takes precedence for the markings at the top and bottom of the page.
   4.10.3. The full marking “REL TO USA//applicable country trigraph(s), international
   organization or coalition force tetragraph” shall be used after the classification and will
   appear at the top and bottom of the front cover, if there is one, the title page, if there is one,
   the first page and the outside of the back cover, if there is one. “REL TO” must include
   country code “USA” as the first country code listed. After the USA, country trigraphic code
   shall be listed in alphabetical order followed by international organization/coalition
   tetragraphic codes listed in alphabetical order.
   4.10.4. Country codes shall be separated by a comma and a space with the last country code
   separated by a space, a lower case “and” and a space. EXAMPLE: TOP SECRET//REL TO
   USA, EGY and ISR.
   4.10.5. When portion marking, countries do not need to be listed unless they are different
   from the countries listed in the “REL TO” at the top and bottom of the page. Text that is
   releasable to all the countries listed at the top and bottom of the page shall be portion marked
   “REL”. EXAMPLE: (TS//REL).
   4.10.6. If the information is releasable to countries that are different than those listed in the
   overall “REL TO” marking, the portion marking has the same format, but with the specific
   countries/organizations listed alphabetically. EXAMPLE: The overall document marking is
   „SECRET//REL TO USA, NZL and NATO.” However, the portion marking may be:
   (S//REL TO USA, AUS, NZL and NATO) to indicate that information contained in this
   portion is also releasable to Australia.
   4.10.7. “NOFORN” is an authorized control marking for intelligence information IAW
   DCID 6/6, Security Controls on the Dissemination of Intelligence Information. Do not use
   the “NOFORN” dissemination control marking on any document, including derivatively
   classified documents, without first verifying that the requirements of DCID 6/6 are met and
   that the marking is actually warranted.
   4.10.8. Countries represented with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
   3166 trigraphic codes can be obtained from the ISPM or from INTELINK on the SIPRNET.
 32                                     AFI31-401_LITTLEROCKAFBSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010


4.11. Classified Electronic Mail (E-Mail).
   4.11.1. All e-mails and documents accomplished on the SIPRNET, whether classified or
   unclassified, will contain the correct classification markings. Classified information may not
   be transmitted on the NIPRNET.
   4.11.2. The first marking in the Subject line of the e-mail will be the overall classification of
   the e-mail using these symbols: (S) for Secret, (C) for Confidential, and (U) for Unclassified.
   Following this will be the subject title, followed by the classification of the subject title.
   Example: Subject: (S) Unclassified E-Mail Sample (U)
   4.11.3. Do not send classified messages or mark messages as classified on an
   unclassified network.
   4.11.4. Place the appropriate classification of the e-mail in all uppercase letters as the first
   line of the e-mail message text.
   4.11.5. Begin the text of the message on the third line, leaving a blank line between the
   classification marking and the text.
   4.11.6. All paragraphs and subparagraphs will be marked with the appropriate portion
   marking. Use the abbreviated classification symbol at the beginning of all paragraphs and
   subparagraphs.
   4.11.7. Place the appropriate classification of the e-mail in all uppercase letters as the last
   line of the e-mail message text.
   4.11.8. All attachments (if any) will be marked appropriately with overall and portion
   markings. Indicate the classification of the attachment by placing the abbreviated
   classification symbol in parentheses before the attachment icon.
   4.11.9. Place classification, declassification, and downgrading instructions after the
   signature block on the left margin.

                                      SAFEGUARDING

Section 5A—Control Measures

5.1. General. Air Force personnel are responsible, both personally and officially, for
safeguarding classified information for which they have access. Collecting, obtaining, recording,
or removing, for any unauthorized use whatsoever, of any sensitive or classified information, is
prohibited.
   5.1.1. Everyone should be aware that advancing technology provides constantly changing
   means to quickly collect and transport information. The introduction of electronic storage or
   transmission devices into areas that store, process, and/or generate classified information
   increases the risk to that information.
   5.1.2. Consult the servicing DAA for specific guidance concerning introduction into areas
   containing Information Systems (IS). [Reference DODD 8100.2, Use of Commercial
   Wireless Devices, Services, and Technologies in the Department of Defense (DOD) Global
   Information Grid (GIG).]

Section 5B—Access

5.2. Granting Access to Classified Information. Personnel who have authorized possession,
knowledge, or control of classified information grant individuals access to classified information
when required for mission essential needs and when the individual has the appropriate clearance
eligibility according to AFI 31-501, Personnel Security Program Management; has signed an SF
312, Classified Information Nondisclosure Agreement (NdA), and has a need to know the
information. Those granting access to classified information must gain the originator‟s approval
before releasing the information outside the Executive Branch or as specified by the originator of
the material. Also see paragraph 5.4.1.1 of this AFI. [References DOD 5200.1-R, C6.2., and EO
12958, as amended, Section 4.1(c.)]
   5.2.1. The Secretary of Defense directed all military members and civilian employees with
   Top Secret eligibility or access to a specially controlled access category or compartmented
   information to make a one time verbal attestation to the first paragraph of the SF 312. The
   verbal attestation must be witnessed by at least one individual in addition to the official who
   presides over the attestation and manages the process [Reference DOD 5200.1-PH-1.] The
   procedures for personal attestation include:
       5.2.1.1. The statement, "Attestation completed on (date)," is placed in the bottom of the
       Organization block in Item 11 of the SF 312.
       5.2.1.2. The individual making the verbal attestation will complete Item 11 of the SF
       312. The witness will sign in the Witness block. The presiding official will sign in the
       Acceptance block.
       5.2.1.3. Record the date of attestation in JPAS.
 34                                     AFI31-401_LITTLEROCKAFBSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010


   5.2.2. Confirm an individual‟s access level. The holder of the information must confirm
   valid need-to-know and must verify the level of access authorization. Those granting access
   to classified information will confirm a person's access level by:
       5.2.2.1. Checking the person's access level, clearance eligibility, and date the person
       signed the SF 312 and completed Non-SCI Indoctrination, in JPAS; or
       5.2.2.2. Confirming it through the employee's security manager, supervisor, or
       commander or equivalent, or staff agency chief; or
       5.2.2.3. Receiving a visit request from a non-DOD visitor's security manager or
       supervisor. See paragraph 5.5 for further guidance.
5.3. Nondisclosure Agreement (NdA). Signing the NdA is a prerequisite for obtaining access
(see paragraph 5.2). Unit commanders or equivalents and staff agency chiefs are responsible for
ensuring their employees have signed one by checking JPAS or the employee‟s personnel
records. If they have not signed one, those responsible use DOD 5200.1-PH-1, Classified
Information Nondisclosure Agreement (Standard Form 312) Briefing Pamphlet, to brief people
on the purpose. Record the NdA on-line through JPAS prior to sending the signed form for
retention. NOTE: When the employee‟s access level is passed to another office or activity, that
office or activity can assume the employee has signed one.
5.3. (LITTLEROCKAFB)Nondisclosure Agreement (NdA). Before having access to
classified information, all personnel will sign an SF 312, Classified Information Nondisclosure
Agreement. Individuals completing the SF 312 for the first time and assigned to a Top Secret or
special access position will complete the security attestation when they read and sign the SF 312.
Personnel who have a Top Secret clearance and are identified as not having an attestation date in
JPAS will re-initiate the SF 312. The date of the attestation will then be entered in JPAS and the
SF 312 forwarded to the appropriate retention address. The original SF 312 will be sent to the
appropriate retention address and a copy given to the member. It is not necessary for the security
manager to maintain a copy of the SF 312 once the original has been forwarded to the retention
address and the date of indoctrination and access level have been entered into JPAS.
   5.3.1. Retention. Security managers mail the NdA to the following organizations who will
   retain the NdAs for 50 years.
   5.3.1. (LITTLEROCKAFB) After annotating the attestation in JPAS, the SF 312 with the
   attestation statement on the back should be given to the member to present as proof for future
   assignments or accesses.
       5.3.1.1. For active military members, to HQ AFPC/DPFFCMI, 550 C St., W, Suite 21,
       Randolph AFB, TX 78150-4723.

      5.3.1.5. For persons outside the Executive Branch who receive access according to
      paragraph 5.4, the servicing ISPM to the activity granting access will file the NdA.
   5.3.2. Refusal To Sign. When a person refuses to sign an NdA, the commander or
   equivalent, or staff agency chief:
      5.3.2.1. Initiates security incident report, in JPAS, that the person refused to sign the
      NdA.
      5.3.2.2. Denies the individual access to classified information.
      5.3.2.3. Initiate actions to establish a Security Information File (SIF) according to AFI
      31-501.
5.4. Access by Persons Outside the Executive Branch.
   5.4.1. Policy. MAJCOM/FOA/DRU commanders and HAF 2-digits or their designees
   authorize individuals outside the executive branch to access Air Force classified material as
   follows unless otherwise provided in DOD 5200.1-R, paragraph C6.2.2.
      5.4.1.1. Authorizing Officials (those cited in paragraph 5.4.1 above) may grant access
      once they have:
          5.4.1.1.1. Gained release approval from the originator or owner of the information.
          Normally, this is the same official identified in paragraph 5.4.1.1.2.2 below.
          5.4.1.1.2. Determined the individual has a current favorable personnel security
          investigation as defined by AFI 31-501 and a check of JPAS and a local files check
          (LFC) shows there is no unfavorable information since the previous clearance. A LFC
          must be processed according to AFI 31-501. EXCEPTION: In cases where there is
          no current personnel security investigation as defined in AFI 31-501,
          MAJCOM/FOA/DRU commanders and HAF 2-digits may request a National Agency
          Check (NAC) and grant access up to the Secret level before the NAC is complete
          when there is a favorable LFC and the Air Force Central Adjudication Facility
          (AFCAF) confirms there is no unfavorable information on the individual in JPAS.
          When applying this exception, follow the procedures outlined in AFI 31-501,
          paragraph 3.11. for interim security clearance eligibility.

     5.4.5.1. General. Requests for classified access by historical researchers will be
     processed only in exceptional cases wherein extraordinary justification exists. Access
     will be granted to the researcher only if the records cannot be obtained through available
     declassification processes (i.e., the FOIA and MDR processes) and when the access
     clearly supports the interests of national security.
     5.4.5.2. Providing Access.
AFI31-401_LITTLEROCKAFBSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010                                                    37


         5.4.5.2.1. The researcher must apply to AFHRA OL-A/HOR in writing for the
         access. The application will fully describe the project including the sources of
         documentation that the researcher wants to access.
         5.4.5.2.2. If AFHRA OL-A/HOR accepts the request for access, they will provide the
         researcher with written authorization to go to the nearest Air Force installation
         security forces office to complete a personnel security questionnaire for a NAC
         according to AFI 31-501.
         5.4.5.2.3. If the results of the NAC are favorable and AFHRA OL-A/HOR approves
         access, the researcher must sign a SF 312 and an agreement to submit any notes and
         manuscript(s) for security and policy review(AFI 35-101). This process is to ensure
         the documents do not contain any classified information and, if so, determine if they
         can be declassified. Send the SF 312 to AFHRA OL-A/HOR for retention. Classified
         information will not be removed from government facilities.
         5.4.5.2.4. Other Terms.
             5.4.5.2.4.1. The access agreement is valid for two years. One two-year renewal is
             possible. A renewal will not be considered if the project appears to be inactive in
             the months before the end of the original agreement.
             5.4.5.2.4.2. Access will be limited to those records 25 or more years of age.
             5.4.5.2.4.3. Access based on a NAC is valid for Secret and Confidential
             information but does not meet the requirement for access to RD or SAP
             information. Access to Top Secret or SCI information is not authorized.
             5.4.5.2.4.4. Access will be allowed only to Air Force records at AFHSO,
             AFHRA, and the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).
             5.4.5.2.4.5. Access to Air Force records still in the custody of the originating
             offices in the Washington National Capital Region must be approved in writing
             by the originating offices or their successors. It is the responsibility of the
             researcher to secure this approval.
  5.4.6. Former Presidential Appointees. Persons who previously occupied policy-making
  positions to which the President appointed them may not remove classified information upon
  departure from office. All such material must remain under the security control of the U.S.
  Government. Such persons may be authorized access to classified information they
  originated, received, reviewed, signed, or that was addressed to them while serving in their
  official capacity, provided the applicable Air Force OCA: [Reference DOD 5200.1-R,
  C6.2.2.5.]
     5.4.6.1. Makes a written determination that such access is clearly consistent with the
     interests of national security;
     5.4.6.2. Uses the same access determination procedures outlined in paragraph 5.4 of
     this AFI;
     5.4.6.3. Limits the access to specific categories of information over which the Air Force
     OCA has classification jurisdiction;

       5.4.6.4. Maintains custody of the information or authorizes access to documents in the
       custody of the NARA; and,
       5.4.6.5. Obtains the individual‟s agreement to safeguard the information and to submit
       any notes and manuscript for a security review (AFI 35-101, Chapter 15) to ensure that
       the documents do not contain classified information or to determine if any classified
       information should be declassified.
   5.4.7. Judicial Proceedings. See AFI 51-301, Civil Litigation, for more information
   regarding the release of classified information in litigation.
   5.4.8. Other Situations. Follow the guidance in paragraph 5.4.1.1 above. [Reference DOD
   5200.1-R, C6.2.2.7.]
   5.4.9. Foreign Nationals, Foreign Governments, and International Organizations. Owners of
   classified information disclose it to foreign nationals, foreign governments, and international
   organizations only when they receive authorization from SAF/IAPD, 1080 Air Force
   Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1080. (See AFI 16-201, Foreign Disclosure of Classified
   and Unclassified Military Information to Foreign Governments and International
   Organizations, for more specific guidance.) See Attachment 4 for guidance on transmitting
   classified information to foreign governments.
   5.4.10. Retired Flag or General Officers or Civilian Equivalent. See AFI 31-501. These
   individuals need not sign a NdA if the original one is already filed in their retired file or
   JPAS. (see paragraph 5.3.1.3).
5.5. Access by Visitors. JPAS is the primary source for confirming access eligibility for DOD
and DOD contractor personnel. Visit authorization letters will not be used to pass security
clearance information unless JPAS is not available. [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C6.2.3.]
   5.5.1. Outgoing Visit Requests for Air Force Employees. When an Air Force employee
   requires access to classified information at:
       5.5.1.1. A non-DOD contractor activity, the supervisor or security manager contacts the
       office to be visited to determine the desired clearance verification.
       5.5.1.2. A DoE activity, the supervisor or security manager prepares and processes DoE
       Form 5631.20, according to DODD 5210.2, Access to and Dissemination of Restricted
       Data. Also see paragraph 1.5.1 of this AFI.
   5.5.2. Incoming Visit Requests. Air Force activity visit hosts serve as the approval authority
   for visits to their activities. Use JPAS to confirm security clearances of DOD personnel,
   including DOD contractors. Installation or activity commanders or equivalents, and staff
   agency chiefs receiving a visit request:
       5.5.2.1. From non-DOD contractors, see DOD 5220.22-M, Chapter 6.
       5.5.2.2. From foreign nationals or U.S. citizens representing a foreign government,
       process the visit request according to AFI 16-201.
5.6. Preventing Public Release of Classified Information. See AFI 35-101, Chapter 15, for
guidance on security reviews to prevent people from publishing classified information in
personal or commercial articles, presentations, theses, books or other products written for general
publication or distribution.
AFI31-401_LITTLEROCKAFBSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010                                                     39


5.7. Access to Information Originating in a Non-DOD Department or Agency. Holders
allow access under the rules of the originating agency.
5.8. Administrative Controls.
   5.8.1. Top Secret. The security of Top Secret material is paramount. Strict compliance with
   Top Secret control procedures take precedence over administrative convenience. These
   procedures ensure stringent need to know rules and security safeguards are applied to our
   most critical and sensitive information. The Air Force accounts for Top Secret material and
   disposes of such administrative records according to WebRims Records Disposition Schedule.
      5.8.1.1. Establishing a Top Secret Control Account (TSCA). Unit commanders or
      equivalents, and staff agency chiefs who routinely originate, store, receive, or dispatch
      Top Secret material establish a Top Secret account and designate a Top Secret Control
      Officer (TSCO), with one or more alternates, to maintain it. The unit commander or staff
      agency chief will notify the installation ISPM of the establishment of TSCAs and the
      names of thE TSCO. The TSCO uses AF Form143, Top Secret Register Page, to
      account for each document (to include page changes and inserts that have not yet been
      incorporated into the basic document) and each piece of material or equipment to include
      IS media. NOTE: For IS information systems or microfiche media, TSCOs must either
      describe each Top Secret document stored on the media on the AF Form 143 or attach a
      list of the documents to it. This will facilitate a damage assessment if the media are lost
      or stolen. EXCEPTIONS:
          5.8.1.1.1. Top Secret Messages. TSCOs do not use AF Form 143 for Top Secret
          messages kept in telecommunications facilities on a transitory basis for less than 30
          days. Instead, use message delivery registers or other similar records of
          accountability.
          5.8.1.1.2. Defense Courier Service (DCS) Receipts. TSCOs don‟t use AF Forms 143
          as a receipt for information received from or delivered to the DCS. DCS receipts
          suffice for accountability purposes in these cases. Retain as prescribed by WebRims
          Records Disposition Schedule. NOTE: TSCOs may automate their accounts as long
          as all of the required information is included in the information system.
      5.8.1.2. Top Secret Disclosure Records.
          5.8.1.2.1. The TSCO uses AF Form 144, Top Secret Access Record and Cover
          Sheet, as the disclosure record and keeps it attached to the applicable Top Secret
          material. Each person that accesses the attached Top Secret information signs the
          form prior to initial access.
          5.8.1.2.2. People assigned to an office that processes large volumes (i.e., several
          hundred documents) of Top Secret material need not record who accesses the
          material. NOTE: This applies only when these offices limit entry to assigned and
          appropriately cleared personnel identified on an access roster.
      5.8.1.3. Top Secret Inventories. Unit commanders or equivalents, and staff agency
      chiefs:
          5.8.1.3.1. Designate officials to conduct annual inventories for all Top Secret
          material in the account and to conduct inventories whenever there is a change in
40                               AFI31-401_LITTLEROCKAFBSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010


     TSCOs. These officials must be someone other than the TSCO or alternate TSCOs of
     the TSCA being inventoried. The purpose of the inventory is to ensure all of the Top
     Secret material is accounted for, discrepancies resolved, and its status is correctly
     reflected on the corresponding AF Form 143.
     5.8.1.3.1. (LITTLEROCKAFB) The Top Secret inventories are required each time
     there is a change in the TSCO and annually. This inventory requires a report to
     document accomplishment. The report requires the identification of discrepancies and
     the corrective actions that have been taken. Discrepancies should be corrected inside
     72 hours. However, any identified loss of information or possible compromise will
     be reported immediately. After correction all discrepancies, record the date the
     inventory was accomplished and the date corrective actions were completed. Place a
     statement in the report that says “All Top Secret material is accounted for,
     discrepancies resolved, and the status is correctly annotated on the AF Form 143.”
     Units will provide a copy of the annual inventory report to the servicing ISPM and
     maintain a copy in the USM‟s binder (See further requirements below).
        5.8.1.3.1.1. (Added-LITTLEROCKAFB) DO                  NOT         DOCUMENT
        CLASSIFIED MATERIAL. State discrepancies in general terms such as “Three
        documents were not added to the last inventory list when added to the container.”
        or “Five items were not marked properly”. List the corrective actions in general
        terms as well.
        5.8.1.3.1.2. (Added-LITTLEROCKAFB) DO NOT identify the number or
        location of the container on the report. This would be like putting the
        classification of the material on the container itself which is not permitted.
        5.8.1.3.1.3. (Added-LITTLEROCKAFB) Label the top and bottom, as well a
        portion mark the report as FOUO.
     5.8.1.3.2. Ensure necessary actions are taken to correct deficiencies identified in the
     inventory report.
     5.8.1.3.3. Ensure the inventory report and a record of corrective actions taken are
     maintained with the account.
     5.8.1.3.4. May authorize the annual inventory of Top Secret documents and material
     in repositories, libraries, or activities storing large volumes of Top Secret documents
     and material be limited to a random sampling using the percentage scale indicated
     below. If account discrepancies are discovered the commander or equivalent, or staff
     agency chief must determine if the random sample percentage method will suffice or
     if a higher percentage inventory will be accomplished. If the higher percentage
     inventory is chosen, the inventory percentage will increase by no less than 20 percent.
        5.8.1.3.4.1. One hundred percent, if there are fewer than 300 Top Secret
        documents.
        5.8.1.3.4.2. No less than 90 percent if the holdings range from 301 to 400 Top
        Secret documents.
        5.8.1.3.4.3. No less than 80 percent if the holdings range from 401 to 500 Top
        Secret documents.
AFI31-401_LITTLEROCKAFBSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010                                                     41


              5.8.1.3.4.4. No less than 70 percent if the holdings range from 501 to 600 Top
              Secret documents.
              5.8.1.3.4.5. No less than 60 percent if the holdings range from 601 to 800 Top
              Secret documents.
              5.8.1.3.4.6. No less than 50 percent if the holdings range from 801 to 1,000 Top
              Secret documents.
              5.8.1.3.4.7. No less than 40 percent if the holdings range from 1,001 to 1,300 Top
              Secret documents.
              5.8.1.3.4.8. No less than 30 percent if the holdings range from 1,301 to 1,800 Top
              Secret documents.
              5.8.1.3.4.9. No less than 20 percent if the holdings range from 1,801 to 2,800 Top
              Secret documents.
              5.8.1.3.4.10. No less than 10 percent if the holdings exceed 2,800 Top Secret
              documents.
      5.8.1.4. Special Access Programs will follow the inventory and accountability
      requirements prescribed by the AFSAPCO.
      5.8.1.5. Top Secret Receipts. TSCOs use AF Form 143 as a receipt when transferring
      Top Secret material from one TSCO to another on the same installation.
      5.8.1.6. Top Secret Facsimiles. Top Secret facsimiles will be processed as another copy
      of the main Top Secret document in the TSCA. All the same rules apply except the
      register page and disclosure record will be faxed along with the document to the
      addressee. The addressee will sign and return them immediately to the sender for
      inclusion in the TSCA.
   5.8.2. Secret. Unit commanders or equivalents, and staff agency chiefs set up procedures for
   internal control of Secret material. When entering Secret material into a mail distribution
   system, a receipt is required. Personnel may use AF Form 310, as a receipt.
   5.8.3. Confidential. Individuals need not use a receipt for Confidential material unless asked
   to do so by the originating activity.
   5.8.4. Foreign Government and NATO Information. See DOD 5200.1-R, C6.6., for
   receipting requirements.
   5.8.5. Retention of Receipts. Retain receipt and other accountability records IAW WebRims
   Records Disposition Schedule.

Section 5C—Safeguarding

5.9. Care During Working Hours.
   5.9.1. Personnel removing classified material from storage must:
      5.9.1.1. For Top Secret material use AF Form 144, instead of SF Form 703, Top Secret
      Cover Sheet (see paragraph 5.8.1.2.1) except as specified in paragraph 5.8.1.2.2
      above. [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C6.3.2.1.]
 42                                     AFI31-401_LITTLEROCKAFBSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010


       5.9.1.2. For Secret or Confidential material use SF Form 704, Secret Cover Sheet, or SF
       Form 705, Confidential Cover Sheet, as appropriate. These forms are available through
       the Air Force Publications Distribution system.
       5.9.1.3. Use the SF Form 702, to record openings and closings for all General Services
       Administration (GSA)-approved security containers, vaults, and approved secure storage
       rooms.
       5.9.1.4. (Added-LITTLEROCKAFB) Post “Classified Work in Progress” visual aid.
       Ensure each door to the room where classified information will be processed remain
       closed. When working with classified information a sign indicating, “Classified Work In
       Progress” will be conspicuously posted outside each door.
   5.9.2. The nature of the classified material typically stored within a secure room or vault
   may preclude the use of cover sheets. Use cover sheets when feasible.
5.10. End-of-Day Security Checks. Each unit and staff agency that processes, stores, or
generates classified information will conduct an end-of-day security check to ensure classified
material is stored appropriately. Personnel conducting these checks will do so at the close of each
working day and record them on the SF Form 701, when security containers are present, even if
the container was not opened that day. The “Checked By” column of the SF 702 does not require
end-of-day documentation. Activities that are continuously staffed will establish local procedures
to provide for daily security checks. Document those daily security checks on the SF 701. Note:
Additional security and safety checks may be added in the blanks on the SF 701. All security
containers will be listed on the SF 701 for end-of-day checks.
5.10. (LITTLEROCKAFB)End-of-Day Security Checks. It is recommended each unit/staff
agency chief implement a clean desk policy to aid in the accomplishment of the end-of-day
check. Incorporate end-of-day security check requirements and procedures into unit OIs. The
SF 701 will be conspicuously posted in the area of responsibility. The SF 701, Activity Security
Checklist, is not required in areas that are continuously staffed. The SF 702 will be located on
top or front of the classified storage container. The SF 702 will be checked and annotated each
duty day the container has been opened.
   5.10.1. (Added-LITTLEROCKAFB) End-of-day checks should include desktops, file
   baskets, cabinet tops, trash containers, fax machines, etc., for the presence of classified
   materials. Check all reproduction machines and shredders. Check all stand-alone Emission
   Security (EMSEC) approved information systems, secure telephone units (STU-III/STE) and
   any secure data fax machines for proper storage of the crypto ignition keys.
   5.10.2. (Added-LITTLEROCKAFB) Before leaving the area, all employees will ensure
   all classified notes, carbon paper, typewriter ribbons, disks, rough drafts, and similar papers
   are placed in storage containers to assist in the end-of-day checks.
5.11. Residential Storage Arrangements.
   5.11.1. SECAF and SAF/AA authorize the removal of Top Secret information from
   designated working areas. Requesters send requests through command IP channels to
   SAF/AAP [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C6.3.7.1.]
AFI31-401_LITTLEROCKAFBSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010                                                      43


   5.11.2. MAJCOM/FOA/DRU commanders, or their ISPMs approve requests for removing
   Secret and Confidential material from designated work areas during non-duty hours
   [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C63.7.2.]
   5.11.3. Contingency Plans. The written procedures will be developed as required by DOD
   5200.1-R, C6.3.7.3. to include arrangements for notifying the responsible activity to pick up
   the classified container and material in the event something happens to the user [Reference
   DOD 5200.1-R, C6.3.4.]
5.12. In-Transit Storage. Installation commanders:
   5.12.1. Provide an overnight repository for classified material. A locally developed
   awareness program ensures operations dispatch, passenger services, base entry controllers,
   and billeting staff are aware of the availability.
   5.12.2. Authorize the storage of Secret and Confidential material on the flightline during in-
   processing for deployment when the material is stored in a standard GSA-approved security
   container and the in-transit area is controlled and located on an Air Force installation.
5.13. Classified Meetings and Conferences [Reference DOD 5200. 1-R, C6.3.8.]
   5.13.1. Classified information at meetings, conferences, symposia, portions or sessions of
   meetings, conferences, etc., during which classified information is to be disseminated shall
   be limited to appropriately cleared U.S. Government or U.S. Government contractor
   locations. Auditoriums, assembly halls, or gymnasiums that are primarily for public
   gatherings at cleared contractor facilities will not be used for a classified meeting at which
   Top Secret or Secret information would be disclosed, even though it is located on a portion
   of the contractor‟s cleared facility [DOD 5220.22-R, Para C1.4.5.1].
   5.13.1. (LITTLEROCKAFB) The facility must afford adequate security against
   unauthorized access physically and against sound emissions. It is the briefers‟ responsibility
   to ensure all attendees have the appropriate security clearance and need to know of the
   information being discussed, as well as having signed an SF 312. Establish entry control and
   perimeter surveillance by posting personnel from the sponsoring activity outside the room or
   facility‟s entry points as necessary. Personnel posted will have the appropriate security
   clearance and the need to know of the information being discussed. Personnel posted will
   ensure the exterior of the facility or hallways surrounding the room are kept clear for the
   duration of the meeting. Perform positive picture ID check of all attendees prior to entering.
   Ensure all electronic devices do not enter the room/area where the classified meeting/briefing
   is being held. Turn off and secure all devices outside the area.
       5.13.1.1. (Added-LITTLEROCKAFB) It is highly recommended to verify all
       attendees' clearances by using the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) web site
       located at https://jpasapp.dsis.dod.mil/JPAS/jsp/JPASDisclosure.jsp or obtain a
       current JPAS summary from the individual or unit security manager. Ultimately,
       verification of an attendee‟s clearance rests on the host of the briefing who will validate
       access by ensuring the minimum requirements listed in AFI 31-401, Para 5.2.2. are met.
   5.13.2. Facility Approval Authority. Installation commanders or their designees assess the
   need to establish and approve secure conference and classified training facilities. Normally,
   secure conference or classified training facilities are only established at locations where
 44                                      AFI31-401_LITTLEROCKAFBSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010


   frequent classified meetings or forums occur. If such a facility does not openly store
   classified information, secure construction requirements are not mandated. However, if
   installation commanders or their designees determine the local threat and security
   environment dictates more stringent construction requirements, they can use DOD 5200.1-R,
   Appendix 7 as a guide for constructing the facility.
         5.13.2.1. (Added-LITTLEROCKAFB) Through this publication, the Chief,
         Information Protection (CIP) is designated as the approval authority for all secure
         conference facilities. Organizations will notify the 19 AW/IP, in writing, of all secure
         conference facility requirements. IP personnel along with security forces and civil
         engineering (CE) personnel will inspect all new and modified secure conference facilities
         to ensure security requirements and construction standards are met according to DoD
         5200.1-R, Appendix 7. Results of the inspection will be documented in the USM book
         and copies forwarded to the CIP. The servicing ISPM certifies secure conference
         facilities in writing. The requesting organization will maintain the original certification
         package, and the IP office will maintain a copy of the package. All documentation will
         be maintained according to the Air Force RDS.
         5.13.2.2. (Added-LITTLEROCKAFB) Coordinate proposed structural modifications
         to secure conference facilities with the ISPM and CE. The ISPM and CE will recertify, in
         writing, the structural integrity of secure conference facilities that have been modified.
      5.13.3. Foreign Participation. Hosting officials refer to AFI 16-201, Foreign Disclosure of
      Classified and Unclassified Military Information to Foreign Governments and International
      Organizations, for specific guidance.
   5.13.4. Technical Surveillance Countermeasures (TSCM) Surveys. Commanders or
   equivalents, and staff agency chiefs or their designees determine to do TSCM surveys based
   on mission sensitivity and threat. See AFI 71-101, Volume 3, The Air Force Technical
   Surveillance Countermeasures Program for additional guidance.
5.14. Protecting Classified Material on Aircraft. Classified material and components are
routinely carried on USAF aircraft. The purpose of this paragraph is to provide minimum
standards for the protection of classified material and components while minimizing the impact
on aircrew operations. The following minimum standards are established to provide cost
effective security of classified material and components and to ensure detection of unauthorized
access.
   5.14.1. Aircraft commanders (owners/users) are responsible for the protection of classified
   material and components aboard their aircraft whether on a DOD facility, at a civilian
   airfield, or when stopping in foreign countries IAW DOD 5200.1-R, paragraph C6.3.9.
   Aircraft commanders should consult with the local ISPM or senior security forces
   representative for assistance in complying with these requirements.
   5.14.2. To provide security-in-depth for classified components and material on aircraft, park
   the aircraft in an established restricted area or equivalent if the aircraft is designated
   Protection Level (PL) 1, 2, or 3. Refer to AFI 31-101, Air Force Installation Security
   Program, for details about protection levels.
AFI31-401_LITTLEROCKAFBSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010                                                     45


     5.14.2.1. Lock the aircraft, when possible, using a GSA-approved changeable
     combination padlock (Federal Specification FF-P-110) series available from GSA at 800-
     525-8027, under NSN 5340-00-285-6523 to secure the crew entry door, and/or
     5.14.2.2. Place all removable classified material (e.g., paper documents, floppy disks,
     videotapes) in a storage container secured with a GSA-approved lock. The storage
     container must be a seamless metal (or similar construction) box or one with welded
     seams and a lockable hinged top secured to the aircraft. Hinges must be either internally
     mounted or welded. Containers installed for storage of weapons may also be used to store
     classified material even if weapons/ammunition are present, provided the criteria listed
     above have been met.
     5.14.2.2. (LITTLEROCKAFB) Applicable to all Little Rock AFB, AMC/AETC
     assigned aircrews. All removable classified materials and equipment on an aircraft will
     be removed and stored in a GSA-approved safe/vault. If mission dictates otherwise (i.e.
     Alert Aircraft), the aircraft commander in the presence of a security force representative
     must seal the aircraft. If owner/user personnel cannot seal the aircraft, they will be
     responsible for providing continuous surveillance of the aircraft. Airfield Management
     Operations personnel will immediately notify 19 SFS dispatcher at ext. 987-3221 when/if
     advised of this type situation. A blotter entry will reflect the seal number and include the
     physical location and telephone number for the aircraft commander or designated
     representative. NOTE: Classified material will never be left on an aircraft for the sake of
     convenience.
         5.14.2.2.1. Have the aircraft and container checked for tampering every 12 hours. If
         unable to comply with the 12 hours due to crew rest, perform these checks no later
         than 1 hour after official end of crew rest.
         5.14.2.2.2. Zeroize keyed COMSEC equipment as required by AFKAG-1N, Air
         Force Communications Security (COMSEC) Operations.
     5.14.2.3. If the aircraft cannot be locked and is not equipped with a storage container,
     place the removable classified in an approved security container in an authorized U.S.

  replaced with those meeting Federal Specification FF-L-2740 starting with those storing the
  most sensitive information according to the priority matrix in DOD 5200.1-R, Appendix 7.
  5.18.2. Due to operational necessity or the size and nature of some classified materials, it
  may be necessary to construct secure rooms for storage because GSA-approved containers or
  vaults are unsuitable or impractical. Secure rooms must be approved by the ISPM and be
  constructed IAW DOD 5200.1-R Appendix 7. Access to secure rooms must be controlled to
  preclude unauthorized access. Access shall be limited to authorized persons who have an
  appropriate security clearance and a need-to-know for the classified material/information
  within the area. Persons without the appropriate level of clearance and/or need to know shall
  be escorted at all times by an authorized person where inadvertent or unauthorized exposure
  to classified information cannot otherwise be effectively prevented. The nature of the
  classified material typically stored within a secure room or vault may preclude the use of
  cover sheets.
 5.18.2. (LITTLEROCKAFB) Organizations will notify the ISPM, in writing, of all vaults
 or secure room requirements. Vaults and secure rooms will not be certified for convenience
 alone. IP, SF and CE personnel will inspect all new and modified vaults and secure rooms to
 ensure security requirements and construction standards comply with DoD 5200.1-R,
 Information Security Program, Appendix 7. The 19 AW/IP will maintain the original
 certification package in the vault or certified room, and the requesting organization will

     Agencies:
        5.18.4.1. (Added-LITTLEROCKAFB) LRAFB units or staff agencies may store
        classified material for other units or staff agencies when the volume of classified material
        or frequency of use of the owning unit does not justify maintaining a security container.
        The material will be placed in a sealed envelope or container, and the envelope or
        container will be marked front and back with the highest classification.
        5.18.4.2. (Added-LITTLEROCKAFB) The owning agency will provide the storing

   carrying classified material during TDY poses a risk and should be done as a last resort in
   critical situations. Whenever possible, personnel will use standard secure methods for
   relaying the data, e.g., mail through secure channels or through approved secure electronic
   means. Authorizing officials must assess the risk before authorizing the hand carrying of
   classified material. Some factors to consider during the risk assessment process are:
       6.1.1.1. The environment in which the material will be handcarried. Consider the
       chances of the material being confiscated by unauthorized personnel. The servicing
       AFOSI office should be able to assist in determining the risks associated with the
       environment.
       6.1.1.2. The sensitivity of the information. Consider the damage it could cause the
       United States if the information was compromised.
       6.1.1.3. The availability of authorized facilities for storing the classified during overnight
       layovers, at the TDY location, etc. Consider storing the material at a U.S. military
       installation or other government facility.
   6.1.2. Laptop Computers are High Risk. Because of their commercial value, laptop
   computers are an especially high risk when used to transport classified information. When
   using laptops to handcarry classified information, couriers must ensure both laptop and disks
   are prepared according to paragraph 6.6.3 In addition, as required for all classified material,
   couriers must take special care to ensure laptops and disks are kept under constant
   surveillance or in secure facilities/containers at all times.
   6.1.3. Air Force Office of Primary Responsibility for Transmission and Transportation
   Policy. SAF/AAP establishes Air Force policy and procedures for transmission and
   transportation of classified information and material [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C7.1.1.1.]
   6.1.4. Transmitting Classified Material by Pneumatic Tube Systems. Installation
   commanders approve the use of pneumatic tube systems and ensure that the equipment and
   procedures provide adequate security [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C7.1.1.1.]
   6.1.5. Electronic Transmission and Physical Transportation of COMSEC Material. Personnel
   may acquire information on electronic transmission and physical transportation of COMSEC
   information and material from their supporting COMSEC manager. (Reference AFI 33-201,
   AFI 33-211, AFI33-275, and DOD 5200.1-R, C7.1.1.2.]
   6.1.6. Releasing Other Agency Information Outside of the DoD. Personnel go direct to
   owners of other agency information to request permission to release the information outside
   the DoD [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C7.1.1.4.]
AFI31-401_LITTLEROCKAFBSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010                                                     55


6.2. Transmission and Transporting Top Secret Information. [Reference DOD 5200.1-R,
C7.1.2.]
   6.2.1. Electronic Means. Obtain information about transmitting Top Secret information via
   electronic means from their Information Assurance office. See paragraph 5.8 [Reference
   DOD 5200.1-R, C7.1.2.2.]
   6.2.2. DOD Component Courier Service. The Air Force does not have its own courier
   service [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C7.1.2.4.]
   6.2.3. Department of State Diplomatic Courier Service. Personnel who need to transport
   classified material use the Department of State courier system when: [Reference DOD
   5200.1-R C7.1.2.5.]
      6.2.3.1. Transporting classified material through or within countries hostile to the United
      States or any foreign country that may inspect it.
      6.2.3.2. Transporting Top Secret material to an installation serviced by diplomatic
      pouch. Personnel can find out if they are serviced by diplomatic pouch through their local
      military postal office.
6.3. Transmitting and Transporting Secret Information. [Reference DOD 5200.1-R,
C7.1.3.]
   6.3.1. Also see AFI 31-601 [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C7.1.3.2.]
   6.3.2. The Air Force authorizes the use of the current holder of the GSA contract for
   overnight delivery of Secret information in urgent cases and when the delivery is between
   DOD Components and their cleared contractor facilities within the United States and its
   Territories. This applies to locations in Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico when overnight
   delivery is possible. USD/I has already ensured the conditions cited in DOD 5200.1-R,
   paragraph C7.1.3.3, have been met [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C7.1.3.3.]
      6.3.2.1. The Defense Security Service maintains a list of authorized GSA contract
      overnight delivery services at http://www.dss.mil/isec/approved_overnight.htm.
      6.3.2.2. The carriers identified on the DSS list may be used for urgent overnight delivery
      of Secret and Confidential material within the continental United States (CONUS) when
      overnight delivery cannot reasonably be accomplished by the U.S. Postal Service.
      However, classified COMSEC information may not be transmitted overnight. Controlled
      Cryptographic Information (CCI) that is unclassified may be shipped overnight.
      6.3.2.3. Carrier personnel should not be notified that the package contains classified
      material.
      6.3.2.4. Packages are typically shipped on Monday through Thursday only. This ensures
      that the package does not remain in the possession of the carrier service over a weekend.
      However, the security manager may approve shipment on other days providing the
      receiver has appropriate procedures in place. These procedures must ensure that a cleared
      person will receive and sign for the package on Saturday, Sunday, or holidays, and that
      he or she is able to secure the package in approved storage. [DOD 4525.8-M.]
      6.3.2.5. The sender is responsible for ensuring that an authorized person will be available
      to receive the delivery and for verification of the correct mailing address.

Section 6C—Escort or Handcarrying of Classified Material

6.7. General Provisions [Reference DOD 5200. 1-R, C7.3.]
   6.7.1. Authorization [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C7.3.1.1.]
       6.7.1.1. The unit commander or equivalent, or staff agency chief authorizes appropriately
       cleared couriers to handcarry classified material on commercial flights. See DOD 5200.1-
       R, paragraph C7.3.1.2., for required documentation and this AFI, paragraph 6.1.1, for a
       cautionary statement regarding handcarrying classified material.
       6.7.1.1. (LITTLEROCKAFB) The unit commander or staff agency chief must
       sign the memorandum authorizing the hand carrying of classified material aboard
       commercial passenger aircraft.
       6.7.1.2. The unit commander or equivalent, staff agency chief, or security manager
       authorizes appropriately cleared couriers to handcarry classified material by means other
       than on commercial flights.
   6.7.2. Security managers or supervisors brief each authorized member handcarrying
   classified material [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C7.3.1.2.]
   6.7.3. Each Air Force activity or unit that releases classified material to personnel for
   handcarrying: [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C7.3.1.1.]

means other than on commercial flights. This doesn‟t preclude the use of a courier authorization
letter for infrequent courier situations. EXCEPTION: Documentation is not necessary when
handcarrying classified information to activities within an installation (i.e., Air Force installation,
missile field, or leased facilities within the local commuting area). NOTE: Account for DD Form
2501 (Safeguard) as prescribed in AFI 33-360, Volume 2, Content Management Program-
Information Management Tool (CMP-IMT) [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C73.2.2.]
6.8. (LITTLEROCKAFB) Documentation. For the purpose of this requirement, all units are
under the purview of the 19 AW/CC. The DD Form 2501 is not issued to individuals who hand-
carry or escort classified material on the installation when they are not expected to pass through
an inspection point. The DD Form 2501 is issued to individuals who hand-carry or escort
classified material when they are expected to pass through an inspection point or leave the
installation. If this applies, procedures should require storage of the DD Form 2501 within the
authorizing activity‟s files during all periods when the authorized individual is off duty and not
involved with the transportation or escort of classified material. Individuals who serve in an “on-
call” capacity, such as a duty officer, may be considered on duty. The DD Form 2501 will be
issued with a specific expiration date of not more than 1 year from the date of issue. Whenever
the authorized individual is no longer assigned to or employed by the issuing organization, the
respective DD Form 2501 is invalidated and retained in the issuing organization‟s file for an
additional 2 years before destruction. Classified material hand-carried outside a facility must be
in an envelope, folder or other closed container to prevent loss or observation of the classified
material being hand-carried. An Optional Form 65-B, Government Messenger Envelope, is not
considered a closed container. An appropriate classified cover sheet can be used when hand-
carrying classified material between different units and agencies within the same building. Note:
The authorization for hand-carrying or escorting classified material outside the local area
consists of an approved courier letter (See Attachment 14 (Added)) and an exemption notice
affixed to the package containing classified.

                                           Chapter 9

      ACTUAL OR POTENTIAL COMPROMISE OF CLASSIFIED INFORMATION

9.1. Policy. [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C10.]
   9.1.1. It is Air Force policy that security incidents will be thoroughly investigated to
   minimize any possible damage to national security. The investigation will identify
   appropriate corrective actions that will be immediately implemented to prevent future
   security incidents. Further, if the security incident leads to the actual or potential compromise
   of classified information, a damage assessment will be conducted to judge the effect that the
   compromise has on national security.
   9.1.2. Suspected instances of unauthorized public disclosure of classified information shall
   be reported promptly and investigated to determine the nature and circumstances of the
   suspected disclosure, the extent of the damage to national security, and the corrective and
   disciplinary action to be taken [DODD 5210.50, Para 4.]
9.2. Definitions.
   9.2.1. Security incidents as used in this AFI pertain to any security violation or infraction as
   defined in EO 12958, as amended. Security incidents may be categorized as:
       9.2.1.1. Security Violation. Any knowing, willful or negligent action:
           9.2.1.1.1. That could reasonably be expected to result in an unauthorized disclosure
           of classified information.
           9.2.1.1.2. To classify or continue the classification of information contrary to the
           requirements of this order or its implementing directives.
           9.2.1.1.3. To create or continue a SAP contrary to the requirements of EO 12958, as
           amended.
       9.2.1.2. Security Infraction. Any knowing, willful or negligent action contrary to the
       requirements of EO 12958, as amended that is not a security violation.
   9.2.2. A compromise of classified information occurs when unauthorized individuals have
   had access to the classified information. Unauthorized individuals include those individuals
   with the appropriate security clearance but do not have a valid need-to-know.
   9.2.3. A potential compromise of classified information is when an investigating official
   concludes that a compromise of classified information has more than likely occurred as a
   result of a security incident.
9.3. Information System (IS) Deviations. Coordinate all security deviations involving
information systems with the local ISPM and the supporting information assurance office to
begin an evaluation on the impact of the incident to national security and the organization‟s
operations. If COMSEC material is involved, refer to AFI 33-212, Reporting COMSEC
Deviations (will be incorporated in AFI 33-201, Volume 3, COMSEC User Requirements)).
9.3. (LITTLEROCKAFB)For incidents involving COMSEC materials, immediately
contact the COMSEC manager (19th Communications Squadron) for further guidance.

materiel through local SAP channels to the Director, Special Programs OUSD(P).
9.6. Classification.
   9.6.1. Classify security incident notices, appointment of inquiry official memorandums, and
   security incident reports at the same level of classification as the information compromised if
   they contain classified information or if they provide sufficient information that would enable
   unauthorized individuals to access the classified information in an unsecured environment. In
   the latter case, the documentation must remain classified until the information has been
   retrieved and appropriately safeguarded. Do not classify memorandums and reports
   pertaining to security incidents that have occurred in the information system environment
   when the system has been appropriately purged and the correspondence does not contain
   other classified information.
       9.6.1.1. Classify security incident notices, memorandums, and reports according to the
       classified source from which they are derived. Refer to DOD 5200.1-R, Chapter 3.
       9.6.1.2. Mark security incident notices, memorandums, and reports using derivative
       classification procedures. Refer to DOD 5200.1-R, Chapter 5.
   9.6.2. All security incident reports will, as a minimum, be marked “For Official Use Only.”
   Refer to DOD Regulation 5400.7/Air Force Supplement, Freedom of Information Act

they have undergone a security review [Reference AFI 35-101, Chapter 15.] Unauthorized
disclosure of classified information to the public must be processed IAW DODD 5210.50.
9.8. Reporting and Notifications.
   9.8.1. Personnel who learn of a security incident must immediately report it to their
   commander or equivalent, supervisor, or security manager who will in-turn report the
   incident to the servicing ISPM by the end of the first duty day.
   9.8.2. After assigning a case number beginning with calendar year, base, and sequential
   number for tracking purposes, the ISPM will:
       9.8.2.1. Coordinate with the organization security manager to ensure the commander or
       equivalent, or staff agency chief has been briefed on the incident. The ISPM will brief the
       commander or equivalent, or staff agency chief if the security manager is unable to do so
       or when the incident is reported directly to the ISPM.
       9.8.2.2. Report compromises/potential compromises for the following incidents through
       command IP channels to SAF/AAP:
           9.8.2.2.1. Classified in the public media.

  9.9.5. If the report from the preliminary inquiry is not sufficient to resolve the security
  incident, the appointing authority initiates a formal investigation. The preliminary inquiry
  report will become part of any formal investigation. If the inquiry is closed out as a
  compromise or potential compromise the appointing authority notifies the OCA to perform a
  damage assessment.
  9.9.6. If the inquiry reveals suspected unauthorized disclosure to the public notify SAF/AAP
  through IP channels [DODD5210.50, Para 5.2.1.]. Classify security incident notices,

R/AF Supplement for further guidance [Ref: DOD 5200.1-R, Appendix 3, Para AP3.2.]
   A2.1.1. Access to FOUO Information.
      A2.1.1.1. No person may have access to information designated as FOUO unless that
      person has been determined to have a valid need for such access in connection with the
      accomplishment of a lawful and authorized Government purpose.
      A2.1.1.2. The final responsibility for determining whether an individual has a valid need
      for access to information designated as FOUO rests with the individual who has
      authorized possession, knowledge or control of the information and not on the
      prospective recipient.
      A2.1.1.3. Information designated as FOUO may be disseminated within the DOD
      Components and between officials of DOD Components and DOD contractors,
      consultants, and grantees to conduct official business for the DOD, provided that
      dissemination is not further controlled by a Distribution Statement.
      A2.1.1.4. DOD holders of information designated as FOUO are authorized to convey
      such information to officials in other Departments and Agencies of the Executive and
      Judicial Branches to fulfill a government function. If the information is covered by the
      Privacy Act, disclosure is only authorized if the requirements of AFI 33-332, Air Force
      Privacy Program, are satisfied.
      A2.1.1.5. Release of FOUO information to Congress is governed by AFI 90-401, Air
      Force Relations With Congress. If the Privacy Act covers the information, disclosure is
      authorized if the requirements of DOD 5400.11-R are also satisfied.
      A2.1.1.6. DOD Directive 7650.01, General Accounting Office (GAO) and Comptroller

   A2.1.2. Protection of FOUO Information.
      A2.1.2.1. During working hours, reasonable steps shall be taken to minimize risk of
      access by unauthorized personnel. After working hours, store FOUO information in
      unlocked containers, desks or cabinets if Government or Government-contract building
      security is provided. If such building security is not provided, store the information in
      locked desks, file cabinets, bookcases, locked rooms, etc.
      A2.1.2.2. FOUO information and material may be transmitted via first class mail, parcel
      post or, for bulk shipments, via fourth-class mail. Electronic transmission of FOUO
      information, e.g., voice, data or facsimile, e-mail, shall be by approved secure
      communications systems or systems utilizing access controls such as Public Key
      Infrastructure (PKI), whenever practical.

     Federal Records Act and the DOD Component records management directives. Non-
     record FOUO documents may be destroyed by any of the means approved for the
     destruction of classified information, or by any other means that would make it difficult
     to recognize or reconstruct the information.
  A2.1.3. Unauthorized Disclosure. The unauthorized disclosure of FOUO does not constitute
  an unauthorized disclosure of DOD information classified for security purposes. However,
  appropriate administrative action shall be taken to fix responsibility for unauthorized
  disclosure of FOUO whenever feasible, and appropriate disciplinary action shall be taken
  against those responsible. Unauthorized disclosure of FOUO information that is protected by
  the Privacy Act may also result in civil and criminal sanctions against responsible persons.
  The Military Department or other DOD Component that originated the FOUO information
  shall be informed of its unauthorized disclosure.
A2.2. FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Law Enforcement Sensitive.
  A2.2.1. Law Enforcement Sensitive is a marking sometimes applied, in addition
  to/conjunction with the marking FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY, by the Department of Justice
  and other activities in the law enforcement community. It is intended to denote that the
  information was compiled for law enforcement purposes and should be afforded appropriate
  security in order to protect certain legitimate government interests, including the protection
  of: enforcement proceedings; the right of a person to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication;
  grand jury information; personal privacy including records about individuals requiring
  protection under the Privacy Act; the identity of a confidential source, including a State,
  Local, or foreign agency or authority or any private institution which furnished information
  on a confidential basis; information furnished by a confidential source; proprietary
  information; techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions;
  guidelines for law enforcement investigations when disclosure of such guidelines could
  reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law, or jeopardize the life or physical
  safety of any individual, including the lives and safety of law enforcement personnel.
  A2.2.2. Markings.
     A2.2.2.1. In unclassified documents containing Law Enforcement Sensitive information,
     the words “Law Enforcement Sensitive” shall accompany the words “FOR OFFICIAL

       OFFICIAL USE ONLY Law Enforcement Sensitive information shall be marked
       ―(FOUO-LES)|| at the beginning of the portion. This applies to classified, as well as to
       unclassified documents. If a portion of a classified document contains both classified and
       FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Law Enforcement Sensitive information, the appropriate
       classification designation is sufficient to protect the information.
   A2.2.3. Access to FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Law Enforcement Sensitive. The criteria
   for allowing access to FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Law Enforcement Sensitive are the same
   as those used for FOUO information, except that if the information also bears the marking
   “Originator Control” or “ORCON” the information may not be disseminated beyond the
   original distribution without the approval of the originating office.

                          Attachment 14 (Added-LITTLEROCKAFB)
  EMERGENCY PROTECTIVE/RELOCATION PLAN OF CLASSIFIED MATERIAL

A14.1. (LITTLEROCKAFB) Purpose/Threat.                   This plan supplements DoD Regulation
5200.1-R, paragraph C6.3.4. It establishes procedures for the protection and removal of
classified material in case of fire, natural disaster, civil disturbance, and terrorist activities/enemy
actions, to minimize the risk of compromise.
A14.2. (LITTLEROCKAFB) Scope/Responsibilities/Limited Factors. This plan is applicable
to all military activities located on Little Rock AFB. All personnel with appropriate security
clearances are responsible for the proper care and disposition of classified material in their
charge, with the classified account custodians bearing primary responsibility for the security
container during the execution of this plan. The procedures are to be implemented by the safe
custodian(s), security manager(s), or the senior official present when required. A copy of this
attachment will be conspicuously posted on each authorized security container or groups of
containers in this organization. Limiting factors will vary depending on the specific emergency
and situation.
A14.3. (LITTLEROCKAFB) Tasked Organization/Coordination Instructions. All units must
establish an operating instruction for the information security program, detailing what actions
will be accomplished by assigned personnel for securing or relocating classified material during
emergency situations described above. The base Security Forces and Fire Department would
respond as part of their normal duties. As such, coordination will be handled on a case-by-case
basis.
A14.4. (LITTLEROCKAFB) Protection/Relocation Procedures. If directed by competent
authority, or upon recognition of an emergency condition (i.e. fire, natural disaster, civil
disturbance, and terrorist activities/enemy actions) the following actions will be taken. Units are
required to establish procedures that may be unique to the functional areas but may not deviate
from this attachment.
A14.5. (LITTLEROCKAFB) If material cannot be accounted for after the incident, the unit
security manager and commander will be notified immediately. The unit commander will then
initiate a preliminary inquiry IAW DoD 5200.1-R, Chapter 10 and AFI 31-401, Chapter 9. If
communications security (COMSEC) material is involved, the Base COMSEC office must be
notified immediately.
A14.6. (LITTLEROCKAFB) Questions concerning this plan should be directed to 19 AW/IP
at 987-6264.
A14.7. (LITTLEROCKAFB) FIRE PLAN
    A14.7.1. (LITTLEROCKAFB) Notify all personnel in the facility by activating the nearest
    fire alarm and shouting Fire! Fire! Fire! Evacuate all building personnel to proper assembly
    area.
    A14.7.2. (LITTLEROCKAFB) Call the fire department at 911. State: This is Rank/Name,
    reporting a fire at (location). Give room number if possible. Do not hang up the telephone
    until the fire dispatcher is fully aware of the location and has no further questions.
    A14.7.3. (LITTLEROCKAFB) Remember, no attempt will be made that risks human life.

  A14.7.4. (LITTLEROCKAFB) Fight any fire, if possible, with the nearest fire
  extinguisher.
  A14.7.5. (LITTLEROCKAFB) If time and circumstances permit, assist personnel with
  securing all classified material in a security container.
  A14.7.6. (LITTLEROCKAFB) Open and guard the door that will give firefighters the
  greatest access to the fire. The security manager, security container custodian, or incident
  commander will direct the firefighting forces to the area of the security container and request
  that the container be removed from the area of the fire as soon as possible, if practical.
  A14.7.7. (LITTLEROCKAFB) Admit all firefighters.
  A14.7.8. (LITTLEROCKAFB) If the above actions cannot be accomplished without
  undue risk of death or injury, the classified information custodian must make every effort to
  cover the classified information and remove it from the affected area. If the removal of the
  classified information is not possible, a guard must be posted at a safe distance in position to
  prevent unauthorized access or removal.
  A14.7.9. (LITTLEROCKAFB) After the fire is out, inspect the security containers for
  signs of entry or tampering. If any evidence of tampering or damage is found, thoroughly
  page-check paper documents. Conduct a complete physical inventory of all classified
  material and accountable items. Contact the commander and 19 AW/IP immediately if any
  items are missing or if any unauthorized exposure is suspected.
  A14.7.10. (LITTLEROCKAFB) If unauthorized personnel have obtained access to
  classified material anytime during the emergency, obtain their names for debriefing after the
  situation has been terminated.
A14.8. (LITTLEROCKAFB) NATURAL DISASTER PLAN
  A14.8.1. (LITTLEROCKAFB) In the event of a natural disaster warning, the ranking
  individual, security container custodian, or security manager(s) will ensure all classified
  material is secured in a security container.
  A14.8.2. (LITTLEROCKAFB) If the building is damaged or completely destroyed, notify
  the security container custodian and security manager. They will determine whether the safe
  has been damaged to the extent that it is no longer secure. If the security container is no
  longer secure, the material will be removed to a secure area: Base Ops or Command Post
  until a more permanent location can be determined. One individual will remain with the
  material at all times until the material is properly secured. No attempt will be made to enter a
  building in danger of collapse or any other situation that would endangers human life.
A14.9. (LITTLEROCKAFB) CIVIL DISTURBANCE PLAN
  A14.9.1. (LITTLEROCKAFB) The security manager or incident commander must make
  the decision concerning the protection of classified material during civil disturbance(s). The
  primary concern is the protection of classified material from compromise. The decision to
  guard, remove, or destroy classified material must be based on the severity of the situation.
  Return all exposed classified materials to its container, and secure it immediately. A guard
  will be used to prevent unauthorized access or removal of the classified material. If a guard
  is not available, the material will be moved to a secure location. Upon termination of the
  disturbance, the material will be returned, inventoried, and secured in the security container.
AFI31-401_LITTLEROCKAFBSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010                                                       113


  The ranking individual must get the permission from their commander to destroy classified
  material by means of using an authorized shredder or burning.
A14.10. (LITTLEROCKAFB) TERRORIST ACTIVITY/ENEMY ACTIONS
  A14.10.1. (LITTLEROCKAFB) In the event of a terrorist activity/enemy action, the
  incident commander or security manager will ensure the protection of classified material
  from compromise. The decision to guard, remove, or destroy classified material must be
  based on the severity of the situation. Return all exposed classified materials to its container,
  and secure it immediately. A guard will be used to protect the classified material, unless the
  situation dictates otherwise. If classified material can not be protected, it will be relocated to
  a secure area. A guard will stay with the classified material until it can be properly secured.
  After the incident, return the classified if possible, conduct an inventory, and secure it in an
  authorized security container/secure room. All means to secure classified material will be
  exhausted before the destruction of classified. Destroy the classified material by using an
  authorized shredder or by burning. If classified material has been lost, damaged, or
  compromised immediately notify the commander and the 19 AW/IP.
