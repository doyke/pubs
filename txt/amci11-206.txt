                                                Chapter 2

                                               CONCEPT

2.1. Objectives:
    2.1.1. Maintain a stable combat ready force through the annual flying hour program.
    2.1.2. Ensure an adequate response capability to support AMC's contingency mobility mission.
    2.1.3. Satisfy training requirements.
    2.1.4. Stabilize aircrew, aircraft maintenance, and aerial port/terminal workloads through efficient
    scheduling.
    2.1.5. Satisfy user mobility requirements worldwide.
    2.1.6. Assure efficient use of mobility resources.
    2.1.7. Standardize air mobility management procedures at each management level.
    2.1.8. Standardize aircrew and aircraft mission scheduling at wing, group, or squadron level.

2.2. General. Air mobility management is a dynamic process; however, for simplification this instruc-
tion divides it into four steps:
    2.2.1. Determining requirements. Congress funds the total flying hour program. Hours other than
    those for unilateral aircrew training, maintenance test and ferry, and active duty Joint Airborne Air
    Transportability Training (JA/ATT), are available through the Defense Business Operating Fund
    (DBOF). See Chapter 4 for additional information.
    2.2.2. Planning and scheduling missions. Mission planning starts after receiving annual Department
    of Defense (DoD) user requirements and continues throughout the year. These requirements are the
    basis for developing AMC schedules, commitment plans, wing operating plans (WOPs) and group
    operations plans (GOPs), maintenance schedules, and individual aircrew schedules. When developing
    a unit schedule, consider user and operational requirements, available flying hours, and maintenance
    capabilities and limitations. HQ AMC TACC XOOM/XOOT will coordinate the scheduling proce-
    dures for USAFR associate and unit-equipped AMC-gained units flying AMC missions. Coordinate
    ANG mission schedules with NGB/XOXE and USAFR mission schedules with HQ AFRES/DOOM.
    See Chapter 5 for additional information.
    2.2.3. Committing flying hours. HQ AMC TACC will allocate active duty flying hours to wings and
    groups. See Chapter 6 for additional information.
    2.2.4. Implementing schedules. Schedules are implemented using the AMC Deployment Analysis
    System (ADANS), the Global Decision Support System (GDSS), and the C2 Information Processing
    System (C2IPS). See Chapter 7 and Chapter 8 for additional information.
       2.2.4.1. Air refueling requirements are identified and tasked on a quarterly basis. Implementation
       of each weekly or monthly schedule is a refinement of the original long-range schedule.

                              POLICIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

3.1. General:
   3.1.1. The policies and responsibilities in this instruction are written for peacetime conditions.
   Explain all deviations to HQ AMC through command operations and maintenance channels.
   3.1.2. The Director of Current Operations at TACC, and the unit Operations/Logistics Group Com-
   manders are responsible for assigning mobility resources against their command-level mission
   requirements.
   3.1.3. Many agencies develop requirements, determine capabilities, and execute AMC operations.
   These agencies must ensure all pertinent factors are considered by coordinating among all staff ele-
   ments. Before distributing a formal operational schedule, the appropriate commander must approve it.

3.2. AMC Headquarters:
   3.2.1. Establishes policy and responsibility for TACC, NAFs, AMOGs, and wings regarding:
NOTE: HQ AMC will coordinate policies, and responsibilities affecting USAFR associate and
unit-equipped AMC-gained units.
      3.2.1.1. Active duty flying hours.
      3.2.1.2. Training requirements.
      3.2.1.3. Special operational requirements.
      3.2.1.4. Rotation and augmentation schedules (if required).

3.8. Integral Tanker Unit Deployments (ITUD):
   3.8.1. It is the policy of AMC to maintain unit integrity to the maximum extent possible during
   planned or actual tanker aircraft deployments and operations.
   3.8.2. Deployments and operations requiring a sufficient number of aircraft to necessitate the use of a
   command element and/or planning staff will, to the maximum extent possible, employ aircraft from
   the same organizational unit. Unit integrity begins with the smallest recognized unit, a flight, deploy-
   ing with its own flight commander and crews.
   3.8.3. Required support (command, operations, maintenance, communications, logistics, security,
   contracting, personnel, etc.) will, to the maximum extent possible, be provided from the correspond-
   ing organization.
   3.8.4. If resources are required in excess of a unit's capability, sister or associate units will be chosen
   when possible to provide augmentation. The command element at the deployed location will be deter-
   mined by the unit providing the predominance of aircraft. Once fixed, the command structure will
   remain in place unless changed by competent authority.
   3.8.5. Rotations will maintain unit integrity to the maximum extent possible. The TACC will publish
   an annual rotation schedule for the next fiscal year no later than 31 Jul. Deployment and redeployment
   dates in the schedule may be adjusted by the TACC up to 3 days to accommodate the movement of
   fighter aircraft.
10                                                                            AMCI11-206 1 JUNE 1999


     3.8.6. If necessary, a unit's Single Integrated Operational Plan requirements will be tasked to another
     unit for the duration of the deployment.
     3.8.7. This policy applies to all tanker operations, exercises, and contingencies.
     3.8.8. Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve units have unique considerations. Depending on the
     state of mobilization, due regard and consideration will be given in the maintenance of unit integrity.

3.9. AMC Mission Identifiers. Instructions for encoding and decoding all AMC mission identifiers are
published in Part C to AMC Schedules.
AMCI11-206 1 JUNE 1999                                                                                   11

                                          REQUIREMENTS

4.1. General. Airlift capability will be assigned according to the DoD Transportation Movement Priority
System (DTMPS). Tanker capability will be assigned according to the priority system in AFI 11-221, Air
Refueling Management (KC-10 and KC-135). TACC/XOO will develop and coordinate procedures with
NGB/XO and HQ USAFR/DO to determine AMC-gained mobility capability.

4.2. Training. Active duty AMC mobility units will identify their monthly training aircraft requirements
to their AMC NAF/DOT and TACC/XOO.

4.3. Exercise and JA/ATT. These mobility user requirements are coordinated with the TACC/XOO.

4.4. Aeromedical . TACC/XOO and HQ TRANSCOM/GPMRC (Global Patient Movement Require-
ments Center) receive proposed aeromedical evacuation schedules from HQ PACAF/SG and HQ USAFE/
SG. TACC/XOOM evaluates the schedules from an operational standpoint and the GPMRC evaluates the
schedules from a medical standpoint. Conflicts in either area must be resolved with the requesting com-
mand. If the schedules are feasible and are approved from a budgetary basis, they will be published in the
AMC schedules.

4.5. Channel/SAAM. TACC/XOO/TRK are the only agencies authorized to accept, evaluate, and con-
solidate intertheater SAAM and forecast channel mobility requirements.
   4.5.1. Channel. AMC/TACC maintains passenger and forecast cargo requirements by channel by ser-
   vice. NOTE: TACC/TRK receives forecast cargo and passenger requirements.
   4.5.2. SAAM. Requirements are sent using joint regulation AFR 76-38/AR 59-8/OPNAVINST
   4630.18D. See Chapter 11 for planning and implementation details.

4.6. KC-135 Airlift Operations:
   4.6.1. Air Mobility Command will optimize the use of all AMC aircraft to support the air mobility
   mission areas of air refueling and airlift.
   4.6.2. The KC-135 is AMC's core tanker. The KC-135 has airlift capability; however, the majority of
   KC-135s are dedicated to wartime air refueling (Air Mobility Master Plan, section 5).
   4.6.3. To ensure a mission capable KC-135 crew force, and to ensure DoD receiver pilot's wartime
   readiness is not jeopardized, air refueling training requirements will not be canceled to support peace-
   time airlift requirements (exception in paragraph 4.6.6.).
   4.6.4. Airlift mission taskings will be spread equally among AMC units, to the maximum extent pos-
   sible, to evenly distribute impacts and benefits of flying additional hours.
   4.6.5. The process for tasking KC-135 units for peacetime operations will be based on flexible mis-
   sion support priority systems located in AFI 11-221 for air refueling and Joint Publication 4-01 for air-
   lift. Mission requests of ARC units will be coordinated with HQ AFRES or ANGRC.
   4.6.6. KC-135s may be redirected, with the approval of the TACC/CC, in response to a crisis or to
   support short-notice high priority missions.
12                                                                            AMCI11-206 1 JUNE 1999


     4.6.7. KC-135 dual role missions are missions where both air refueling and airlift are provided to the
     user. Planning agencies will use the following rules and requirements when approving support for
     dual role missions:
        4.6.7.1. A valid dual role must satisfy the following:
            4.6.7.1.1. The user must have a MAJCOM validated air refueling (AR) requirement.
            4.6.7.1.2. The user must have a MAJCOM validated and HQ AMC TACC/XOOM approved
            cargo requirement of a minimum of two pallets of cargo, not including baggage.
            4.6.7.1.3. Appropriateness and availability will be validated by the HQ AMC TACC, who will
            issue mission approval and tasking order.
        4.6.7.2. Completed dual role requests must be received by HQ AMC TACC/XOOT a minimum of
        14 days prior to the mission.
        4.6.7.3. The dual role mission is primarily an air refueling mission, and the AR requirement must
        be met first without regard to protecting ancillary cargo capability.
NOTE: Dual role ancillary cargo capability is not contractual or guaranteed in any way. Guaranteed
cargo requires a dedicated funded SAAM.
        4.6.7.4. Additional tanker sorties/hours will not be expended to refuel the dual role KC-135 (i.e.,
        force extension) solely for protecting ancillary cargo.
NOTE: Exceptions may be granted by HQ AMC/DO with recommendation of HQ AMC TACC/CC for
missions that do not meet this criteria but reduce total fiscal cost, do not impact other tanker requirements,
and are the most practical means available.
        4.6.7.5. Dual role requests that require excessive KC-135 positioning or repositioning time will
        not be supported unless effective KC-135 aircrew training can be accomplished on the position-
        ing/repositioning legs.
NOTE: For ARC missions, unit identified training needs are considered in justifying positioning/reposi-
tioning time.
        4.6.7.6. HQ AMC TACC/XOOT in coordination with HQ AMC TACC/XOOM will be the final
        authority based on appropriateness of mission and availability of KC-135s.

4.7. KC-10 Airlift Operations:
     4.7.1. Air Mobility Command will optimize the use of all AMC aircraft to support air mobility mis-
     sion areas of air refueling and airlift.
     4.7.2. While the KC-10 has significant airlift capability, the majority of KC-10s are dedicated to air
     refueling (Air Mobility Master Plan).
     4.7.3. Airlift mission taskings will be spread equally among AMC units, to the maximum extent pos-
     sible, to evenly distribute impacts and benefits of additional flying hours.
     4.7.4. The process for tasking KC-10 units for peacetime operations will be based on flexible mission
     support priority systems located in AFI 11-221 for air refueling and Joint Publication 4-01 for airlift.
     4.7.5. KC-10s may be redirected, with the approval of the HQ AMC TACC/CC, in response to a crisis
     or to support short-notice high priority missions.
AMCI11-206 1 JUNE 1999                                                                                     13


   4.7.6. KC-10 Dual Role missions are missions where both air refueling and airlift are provided to the
   user. Planning agencies will use the following rules and requirements when approving support for
   Dual Role missions:
       4.7.6.1. The user must have a MAJCOM validated air refueling (AR) requirement.
       4.7.6.2. The user must have a MAJCOM validated and HQ AMC TACC/XOOM approved cargo
       requirement for at least six pallets of cargo, not including baggage.
       4.7.6.3. Completed Dual Role requests must be received by HQ AMC TACC/XOOT a minimum
       of 14 days prior to the mission.
       4.7.6.4. HQ AMC TACC/XOOT in coordination with XOOM will be the final authority based on
       appropriateness and availability, who will issue mission approval and tasking order.
       4.7.6.5. The Dual Role mission is primarily an air refueling mission, and the AR requirement
       must be met first without regard to protecting ancillary cargo.
NOTE: Dual Role ancillary cargo capability is not contractual or guaranteed in any way. A primary cargo
Dual Role mission requires a dedicated funded SAAM.
       4.7.6.6. Additional tanker sorties/hours will not be expended to refuel the Dual Role KC-10 (i.e.
       force extension) solely for the purpose of protecting ancillary cargo.
NOTE: Exceptions may be granted by HQ AMC/DO with recommendation of HQ AMC TACC/CC for
missions that do not meet this criteria but reduce total fiscal cost, do not impact other tanker requirements,
and are the most practical means available.
       4.7.6.7. Dual Role requests that require excessive KC-10 positioning or repositioning time will
       not be supported unless effective KC-10 aircrew training can be accomplished on the positioning/
       repositioning legs.
NOTE: For USAFR missions, unit identified training needs are considered in justifying positioning/
repositioning legs.
       4.7.6.8. HQ AMC TACC/XOOT in coordination with HQ AMC TACC/XOOM will be the final
       authority based on appropriateness of mision and availability of KC-10s.

4.8. Air Refueling. Identify requests to TACC/XOOT on a quarterly basis IAW AFI 11-221.
   4.8.1. Tanker units will identify their air refueling availability to TACC/XOOT on a quarterly basis.
   4.8.2. When requirements exceed air refueling capability, requests will be supported in accordance
   with priorities established by AFI 11-221.

4.9. Theater:
   4.9.1. JA/ATT. TACC receives all JA/ATT requirements from the theater CINC's agent and reviews
   missions insuring they meet requirements of pertinent OPORDS and directives (does not apply to the-
   ater or HQ ACC C-130 JA/ATT exercises).
   4.9.2. Exercise. Requirements are received from the theater CINC's validating agent. TACC reviews
   intratheater requirements and assigns capability.

                                                Chapter 5

                                         MISSION PLANNING

5.1. General. This chapter outlines the responsibilities for developing fiscal year mobility aircraft plan-
ning, the monthly AMC mobility management plan, and the wing or group operations plan (WOP or
GOP). Documentation developed, produced, and published from these procedures is used in planning
mobility operations.

5.2. General Planning:
   5.2.1. AMC Deployment and Analysis System (ADANS) is used to apply military and commercial
   aircraft capability against forecast DoD passenger and cargo requirements. It converts requirements
   and capability into passenger and cargo schedules, and provides TACC/XOO/TRK with data to
   develop the monthly mobility management plan.
   5.2.2. Airlift planning falls within the following time ranges:
       5.2.2.1. Short-Range. Covers the period 100 days before the actual operating month. During this
       time, ADANS is used to develop and publish the AMC Passenger and Cargo Schedules.
   5.2.3. Air refueling planning will be in accordance with AFI 11-221.

5.3. Long-Range Scheduling Process:
   5.3.1. This guidance establishes and implements procedures and responsibilities for AMC long-range
   scheduling. The purpose is to improve the efficiency of air mobility assets. There are three desired
   outcomes: provide a vehicle for conflict resolution at the earliest possible time; provide a vehicle to
   analyze for expected OPSTEMPO; and enable coordination between AMC, ANG, and AFRC under a
   single air mobility system (SAMS).
   5.3.2. Information Gathering and Consolidation:
       5.3.2.1. The key to this process is to gather the scheduling inputs from all available sources. The
       effectiveness of the long-range planning process is dependent on accurate data and timely trans-
       mission. Additionally, translation of inputs into a consolidated picture of future activity is the only
       way in which effective analysis and conflict resolution can occur, and is crucial to improving effi-
       ciencies in our air mobility system.
       5.3.2.2. TACC/XOB will be the office of primary responsibility (OPR) for database management.
       The AFRC and NGB agencies that have visibility on long-range scheduling issues will submit
       inputs to TACC/XOB by the first workday of each quarter. The long-range schedule covers the
       time period of 3 months out to 5 years. Figure 5.1. is a matrix which shows reporting agencies and
       the activities they will report. All active duty agencies will input their data by the first workday of
       each quarter (1 Oct, 1 Jan, 1 Apr, 1 Jul). ANG and AFRC agree to allow TACC/XOB to download
       their long-range schedule into the database as necessary.

                                                                      Information

            5.3.2.2.1. Inputs do not need to be precise statements of requirements; estimates of activity
            based on past experience or current trends are acceptable. Estimates should include : type
            activity, number of aircrews and aircraft, required base operating support forces, and projected
            dates or time frames (to the nearest quarter, minimum). All agencies should tentatively list (not
            task) activities by wing.
            5.3.2.2.2. TACC/XOB will transfer necessary manual inputs into a master database by the 15
            'h of the first month of each quarter (Oct, Jan, Apr, Jul). This database will be made accessible
            to all agencies via hard copy, electronic copy, or web access by the 20'h of the first month of
            each quarter.
     5.3.3. Activity Deconfliction.
        5.3.3.1. One of the primary purposes of the long-range planning process is to provide a vehicle for
        identifying and resolving conflicts between events as far in advance as possible. By identifying
        conflicting requirements well before their execution, planners can reduce changes, confusion, tur-
        bulence, and generally increase the overall efficiency of air mobility assets.
AMCI11-206 1 JUNE 1999                                                                                   17


     5.3.3.2. Upon receipt of inputs and following consolidation into a single database, TACC/XOB
     will highlight time frames where obvious conflicts exist between activities. Conflicts will be com-
     municated to input agencies when the database is made available (per 2.2.2. above). Input agen-
     cies are also responsible for identifying potential conflicts not already identified by TACC/XOB.
        5.3.3.2.1. Each agency is responsible for coordinating conflicts with other affected agencies to
        attempt to resolve the conflict. This coordination should commence as soon as the discrepancy
        is noticed and be completed by the 1st day of the 2 nd month of each quarter (1 Nov, 1 Feb, 1
        May, 1 Aug).
        5.3.3.2.2. If there are any unresolved conflicts as of the 1 ' of the 2 d month of each quarter,
        TACC/XOB will convene the Long-Range Scheduling Board. This board will consist of a
        member from each input agency (preferably 0-5 and below). The board will be charged with
        developing a plan of action to rectify the conflict, complete with time frames and OPRs.
        TACC/XOB will then be responsible for monitoring the progress in executing the plan. Eleva-
        tion of the issue to a higher level will be considered if the problem is intractable or if the board
        is aware of extenuating circumstances that merit higher level involvement.
        5.3.3.2.3. Final resolution of conflicts will be monitored and documented by TACC/XOB.
        Input agencies retain the responsibility to work issues assigned by the Long-range Scheduling
        Board. The quarterly update to the long-range schedule will be complete by the 15 th of the
        last month of the quarter (Dec, Mar, Jun, Sep).
     5.3.3.3. TACC/XOB will brief the 5-year schedule to AMC/CC in July of each year.
        5.3.3.3.1. The 5-year plan will be thoroughly coordinated through all customers and staff
        agencies prior to the July presentation. This will keep all parties informed and maintain pro-
        cess integrity.
  5.3.4. Long-Range Scheduling Product.
     5.3.4.1. The actual output of the long-range scheduling process must support many types of que-
     ries, provide an accessible basis for analysis, and be portable to many users. These elements are
     essential to allowing easy identification of possible conflicts, accurate analysis of future levels of
     activity, and providing a vehicle for effective coordination under the one mobility system.
     5.3.4.2. TACC/XOB will send a copy of the long-range schedule in spreadsheet/ sandchart format
     on the 20th of the last month of the quarter (Dec, Mar, Jun, Sep) to the AMC/DO, AMC/LG,
     AFRC/DO, ANG/DO, AMC/IG and TACC/CC. The quarterly report will be sorted by unit. As a
     minimum the report will depict the MDS, date of activity, number of aircraft, and number of air-
     crews for all the items listed in Figure 5.1. The AMC/DO, TACC/CC, NAF/ CCs and an appropri-
     ate representative from the AFRC and ANG will be invited to attend the annual July brief to the
     AMC/CC.
        5.3.4.2.1. Agencies desiring changes to the fonnat or mode of transmission of the long-range
        scheduling product will submit requests to TACC/XOB. XOB will consider requests and coor-
        dinate proposed changes with affected agencies if required.
        5.3.4.2.2. The long-range scheduling product should also include an analysis of future activity
        including projected annual OPSTEMPO, as well as periods when peaks and valleys in activity
        can be expected. This forecast should include estimates of TWCF and 0 and M flying hour
        usage rates.

     5.3.5. Feedback and Evaluation Process.
        5.3.5.1. The continued effectiveness of the long-range scheduling process depends on routine
        updates and improvements to respond to changing conditions or newly identified opportunities.
        AMC/DOOO is the primary OPR for changes to the long-range scheduling process.
        5.3.5.2. The primary vehicle for assessing the effectiveness of the long-range scheduling process
        will be user feedback. Forward suggested changes and improvements to AMC/DOOO.
            5.3.5.2.1. All members of the Long-Range Scheduling Board will solicit feedback from cus-
            tomers. The 5year schedule briefed to the AMC/CC in July of each year will be made available
            to customers in August. Agencies will follow up to get feedback from customers by the end of
            September.
            5.3.5.2.2. Customer feedback will be discussed and evaluated at the November Long-Range
            Scheduling Board meeting. If no meeting was otherwise planned, TACC/XOB will convene
            the meeting for the purpose of re-evaluating the previous year's process. The long-range
            scheduling log will also be used in these process improvement discussions.
            5.3.5.2.3. The Long-Range Scheduling Board will submit proposals for change to AMC/
            DOOO by the end of November of each year. AMC/DOOO will provide staff support to coor-
            dinate and implement changes.

                                       MISSION SCHEDULING

7.1. General. This chapter outlines policies and responsibilities for developing AMC mobility mission
schedules. The goal is to maintain aircrews and aircraft in a constant state of readiness and provide global
logistic support as a by-product. The air mobility mission schedule should provide an even flow of air-
crews and aircraft throughout the mobility system. This reduces scheduling turbulence for aircrews, main-
tenance, traffic, and other support areas.
     7.1.1. AMC mission schedules are published in GDSS or C2IPS, or AIRS for WINDOWS and, when
     required, by AUTODIN message as far in advance as practical, but not normally later than 24 hours
     before scheduled operations. GDSS or C2IPS are the primary tasking methods.
     7.1.2. TACC/XOO develops and publishes mission schedules for the following:
        7.1.2.1. Joint Airborne/Air Transportability Training (JA/ATT). This category includes continua-
        tion and proficiency combat training supporting DoD agencies. Missions include airdrop, air
        assault, and aircraft static load training, and service school support. TACC/XOOMJ publishes JA/
        ATT tasking in Appendix 1 to Annex C, AMC OPORD 17-76.
        7.1.2.2. Exercises. This category covers all missions supporting CJCS exercises. Exercise direc-
        tives (or equivalent) are published by TACC/XOOX as appropriate.
        7.1.2.3. Special Assignment Airlift Missions (SAAM). This category includes user funded
        requirements requested because of the unusual nature of the cargo, sensitivity/urgency, or opera-
        tions to airfields other than those normally transited by AMC aircraft. TACC/XOOM dispatches
        mission directives.
        7.1.2.4. Channel Traffic. This category includes scheduled missions operating over established
        routes to provide service between specified locations. TACC/XOOM publishes AMC cargo and
        passenger schedules.
        7.1.2.5. Air Refueling. This category includes all worldwide user requirements and is published
        by TACC/XOOT quarterly.
     7.1.3. Active duty wings/groups develop and publish mission schedules for the following:
        7.1.3.1. Unilateral Air Force Training. This category includes AMC aircrew training to achieve
        and maintain mission ready status in both Training Funded (TF) and DBOF-T coded aircraft. Mis-
        sions include qualification and upgrade training, standardization, evaluation, and continuation
        training. Training missions are planned, scheduled, and flown within the hours committed/allo-
        cated for training.
        7.1.3.2. Other. This category includes non-revenue support, maintenance test/ferry, etc.

7.2. TACC Responsibilities:
     7.2.1. TACC/TRK:
        7.2.1.1. Develops daily cargo generation patterns based on service forecasts and requests airlift to
        support user requirements. Coordinates with aerial ports and users worldwide. Monitors and/or
AMCI11-206 1 JUNE 1999                                                                                    23


     reroutes missions supporting movements of human remains and explosives. Issues hazardous
     cargo waivers to accommodate passenger and cargo movement.
     7.2.1.2. Analyzes cargo movement and forecast requirements and adjusts scheduled organic and
     commercial missions as required.
  7.2.2. TACC/XOO:
     7.2.2.1. Coordinates with AMC units, ANG/XO, and HQ USAFR/DO to develop and publish
     scheduling procedures which conform with HQ AMC policy and are consistent with requirements,
     trends, or projected changes.
     7.2.2.2. Ensures all AMC schedules are properly prepared and distributed.
     7.2.2.3. Schedules mobility assets to satisfy DoD requirements.
     7.2.2.4. Requests additional commercial airlift, when required, to satisfy deficits in capability.
     7.2.2.5. Changes schedules, when required.
     7.2.2.6. Ensures schedules are published and distributed to addressees at least 75 days (passenger)
     and 15 days (cargo) before the operating month and 30 days before the operating quarter for air
     refueling.
     7.2.2.7. Maintains current restrictions, limitations, and so forth, on stations that would affect air-
     craft movement schedules.
     7.2.2.8. Issues Mission Operating Directives (MOD) for SAAMs.
     7.2.2.9. Establishes procedures to implement AMC schedules.

                                                 Chapter 8

                                       AIRCREW SCHEDULING

8.1. General. Flying unit commanders (AMC, Reserve Associate, and AMC-gained) will follow the pol-
icies of AFI 11-401, Flight Management; AFI 11-206, General Flight Rules; MCI 10-202; MCI 11-XXX
series; AFI 11-408, Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program Organization and Administration; and
this instruction when scheduling crews on AMC missions.
     8.1.1. Flight Authorizations. Issue flight authorizations using MAJCOM procedures.
     8.1.2. Security Clearances. All attached and assigned aircrew members must have at least a SECRET
     security clearance or one that meets the security requirements of the mission. If access to TOP
     SECRET or SECRET information (AFI 31-501, Personnel Security Management Program) is neces-
     sary, indicate this in DD Form 398, Item 9, Statement of Personal History, as justification for an OSI
     Investigation.

8.2. Aircrew Complement. Minimum basic and augmented crew complements are outlined in the MCI
11-XXX series. Normally, augmented crews will not be used; however, they may be authorized by HQ
AMC/DO, even when the mission profile does not meet the criteria, if justified by the mission priority.

8.3. Scheduling Priorities:
     8.3.1. Initial/Upgrade/Requalification/Difference training.
     8.3.2. Keep all aircrews current and qualified.
     8.3.3. Accomplish as many currency items as possible on operational missions to reduce unilateral
     flying training.
     8.3.4. Distribute flying time as evenly as possible within the same crew position and comply with
     individual training and proficiency requirements.

8.4. Scheduled Return Times (SRT):
     8.4.1. SRT and Firm SRT (FSRT) are scheduling tools used by air mobility units to predict when
     crews will return to home station. It allows force managers to plan aircrew availability and provides
     crews visibility over monthly flying activities. AMC and AMC-gained C-5, C-9, KC-10, KC-135,
     C-141, and C-17 aircrews (except those on standby at home station) will have an SRT established on
     their flight orders. Units, aircrews, and C2 agencies (including TACC) must be aware that flight orders
     and AMC Form 59 SRT entries refer to mission end time, not FSRT. FSRT must be computed as in
     8.4.1.1. below. The FSRT for the crew will be entered in the crew information section of the flight
     orders.
        8.4.1.1. Computations. Wing/group current operations will calculate SRTs using the mission end
        time. The SRT is the same as the scheduled mission end time and will be used on the AMC Form
        59 for tracking purposes. Mission end time is defined as the time the aircrew is scheduled to return
        to home station based on scheduled mission timing or return times printed in OPORDs (for
        deployments). AMC’s goal is to return all crews to home station NLT 2 hours past SRT. FSRT for
        active duty, is scheduled mission end time plus 48 hours. ANG and AFRC is defined as SRT plus
        24 hours.
AMCI11-206 1 JUNE 1999                                                                                25


     8.4.1.2. Missions with stages of unknown duration. Use mission duration estimate plus 48 hours
     for each time the crew enters a stage.
     8.4.1.3. Missions of unknown duration (e.g., contingencies). SRT is determined by the TACC/
     XOO. SRTs for ARC crews flying contingency missions will be coordinated with HQ AFRC or
     ANGRC.
     8.4.1.4. Integral Tanker Unit Deployments (ITUD). Deployed units will compute mission SRTs
     based on the planned time of the deployment and the specific deployment requirements. Rede-
     ployments may be adjusted by the TACC up to 3 days to accommodate the movement of fighter
     aircraft (not applicable for ANG/AFRC personnel. Changes to AFRC/ANG ITUD SRTs will be
     requested through HQ AFRC and/or ANGRC).
     8.4.1.5. C-130 Unit Deployments. SRT is computed as scheduled redeployment date (or deploy-
     ment duration). Deployed units will adhere to SRT specified in deployment orders.
     8.4.1.6. BRAVO/ALFA alert. Crews on alert will have “TBD” on their orders for an SRT. Upon
     notification, the controlling agency (normally the TACC) will determine SRT based on projected
     mission duration, enter this SRT in the Global Decision Support System (GDSS) and inform the
     aircraft commander. If launching against a mission of unknown duration, the TACC/XOO will
     determine SRT. SRT and FSRT rules apply to crews launched from BRAVO/ALFA alert.
     8.4.1.7. Local training missions. As determined by crew duty day.
  8.4.2. Changing scheduled return time.
     8.4.2.1. During mission setup/planning, wing/group current operations will change the SRT as
     dictated by mission changes, itinerary, stages, and so forth. All changes shall be coordinated
     through the aircrew's squadron.
     8.4.2.2. Within 12 hours of crew alert at home station (24 hours for ARC crews), the SRT will not
     be changed by the command and control system. Every attempt should be made not to change pre-
     established SRTs for ARC crews.
  8.4.3. Overflying scheduled return time.
     8.4.3.1. During periods of routine mobility operations, aircrews will not be diverted or delayed in
     the AMC system so as to prevent their return by FSRT. The following applies to both active and
     ARC aircrews:
         8.4.3.1.1. If it appears the FSRT will be overflown, TACC/XOC will coordinate with the air-
         craft commander and unit commander to determine the action to be taken. If the crew returns
         home prior to mission completion, TACC/XOC is responsible for working another crew. For
         ANG/AFRC crews, TACC/XOC will also coordinate with aircraft commander and home unit
         for SRT overflight.
         8.4.3.1.2. Priority one add-ons, natural disaster relief, emergency air evacuation missions, and
         JCS-directed requirements will be supported, even when the SRT will be overflown. TACC/
         XOZ will direct FSRT overflight for active duty crews, when required on a case-by-case basis.
         TACC/XOZ will coordinate with ANG/AFRC aircraft commander and unit commander for
         FSRT overflight approval.
26                                                                             AMCI11-206 1 JUNE 1999


        8.4.3.2. For active units, TACC will notify the crew and parent wing of the new expected return
        time. If the home wing or group identifies an overriding problem associated with keeping an indi-
        vidual crew member past their FSRT, the home station command post will notify TACC of the
        special circumstances. TACC/XOZ will make every effort to meet special circumstance requests.
        8.4.3.3. For ANG/AFRC units. FSRTs for ANG/AFRC aircrews will be considered firm and will
        not be overflown without the approval of the aircraft commander and the parent unit. ANG/AFRC
        units will be notified of pending SRT and FSRT overflight as early as possible so a crew replace-
        ment may be accomplished, or crew member extension approved, if needed.
        8.4.3.4. All replacement crew members travel in ACM status (positioning/depositioning crew-
        member) according to AMCI 11-208, Tanker/Airlift Operations. If this is impossible, HQ AMC
        TACC/XOCA will verify that no military or contract transportation is available, then call the unit
        commander, associate wing commander (AFRC) or wing/group commander (ANG) for approval
        to send the crew members(s) via commercial transportation. All crew members on AMC missions
        may use DD Form 1610 for commercial transportation if required (see MACR/AFRESR 45-14,
        Management of the Reserve Associate Program, chapter 3, for funding provisions). In addition,
        TACC/XOOM will coordinate for any required Military Personnel Appropriation (MPA)
        man-days for ARC personnel.
     8.4.4. Managing scheduled return time. Crews will be monitored closely by TACC and all en route
     command and control centers (CCCs) to ensure recovery by the FSRT. CCC must consider SRTs in
     the management of stage crews. If SRTs are not a factor, first-in, first-out concept will normally apply.
     TACC/XOC is responsible for managing crew members who are separated from their aircraft so they
     return to home station by FSRT.
AMCI11-206 1 JUNE 1999                                                                                      27


                                                 Chapter 9

                              EN ROUTE RESOURCE MANAGEMENT

9.1. Policies:
   9.1.1. Stable operations depend on a steady flow of missions in the mobility system. Since operations
   schedules are developed for stability, management actions must follow them. Policies and responsibil-
   ities established in this chapter apply to all aircraft operating on AMC missions.

9.2. Responsibilities. Commanders must monitor their support capability and inform TACC if it changes
enough to affect mission scheduling.

9.3. Aircraft Holds/Early Departures. All planning/scheduling agencies are responsible for identifying
operational requirements or restrictions early enough to avoid schedule deviations. If, however, good
judgment requires deviations, evaluate the effect on downline operations before making any decision.
Approval authority for early departures or holds is the agency with operational control or management
responsibility (TACC, or AF component commander for exercise or contingency employments). Devia-
tions may be authorized for weather, ARTC restriction, or airfield limitations (scheduled runway closure,
etc.) and must be explained with the appropriate AMCI 10-202, volume 6, deviation indicators.

9.4. Ground Times. When a mission is operating late, attempt to meet the schedule by reducing ground
time at intermediate stops or turnaround stations, but do not violate AMC crew rest policy or paragraph
9.3. Unless an early departure is authorized (paragraph 9.3.), early arrivals must be held until scheduled
departure time. Otherwise ground times are:
   9.4.1. As published in TACC schedules, GDSS, C2IPS, OPLAN/OPORD or as required for a SAAM.
   9.4.2. According to TACC operating procedures for other missions, aircraft which make unscheduled
   landings, or with mission identifier changes.
   9.4.3. As required by the mission, aircrew capability, and TACC operating procedures for offshore
   floater aircraft.

9.5. Overflying En Route Stations . Aircraft commanders may ask TACC Command and Control to
overfly a scheduled stop. The TACC will ensure change of destination:
   9.5.1. Will not impact onload/offload requirements.
   9.5.2. Will not exceed the maximum on the ground (MOG) at the new destination.

9.6. Returning Aircraft. Wings must include due home dates in the remarks section of departure mes-
sages when aircraft depart home station. This date is based on planned maintenance actions (scheduled
minor/major isochronal inspection, aircraft refurbishment, major TCTO/modification, mid-internal PDM,
depot-level maintenance, and so forth).

9.7. Priorities . Use the following mission priority listing as a guide for supporting en route aircraft.
   9.7.1. Active search and rescue.
   9.7.2. 89 AW (when transporting the President/Vice President).
28                                                                              AMCI11-206 1 JUNE 1999


     9.7.3. Priority 1A1 through 1B2.
     9.7.4. Urgent aeromedical evacuation.
     9.7.5. 89 AW (value judgment based upon user).
     9.7.6. Priority aeromedical evacuation.
     9.7.7. Priority 1B3 through 2B2.
     9.7.8. Routine aeromedical evacuation.
     9.7.9. Passenger missions/operational support airlift.
     9.7.10. Priority 3A1 through 4B3.
     9.7.11. Training, route familiarization/aircraft transfer.
NOTE: This applies to routine transfers only. If an aircraft is being transferred to accomplish a specific
mission, that aircraft will receive the same priority at an en route stop as the mission it is going to fulfill.
For example, if an aircraft is being transferred to replace a broken aircraft that is tasked to support an
urgent aeromedical evacuation, the transferring aircraft will carry the urgent aeromedical evacuation pri-
ority when it stops for fuel en route.

9.8. : Conversions.
     9.8.1. Operating missions may be converted to support higher priority requirements provided:

NOTES:
  ARC aircraft/crews will not be converted without approval of appropriate ARC headquarters.
     KC-10s may be redirected from an air refueling mission to a higher priority airlift mission after coor-
     dination with TACC/XOOT.
        9.8.1.1. The requirement is justified.
        9.8.1.2. Qualified people and equipment are readily available to convert the mission.
        9.8.1.3. In-bound mission offloading will not seriously impact station workload or cargo shipment
        time.
        9.8.1.4. The converted mission will operate over the same basic route structure.
        9.8.1.5. Additional deviation will not seriously affect stage crew operations.
        9.8.1.6. Mission number changes are relayed to aircrews and en route/destination stations.

9.9. Reroutes or Schedule Changes:
     9.9.1. The AMC objective is to carry out schedules as originally published. Do not reschedule mis-
     sions solely to avoid incurring departure/arrival delays. Schedule changes or reroutes must be for user
     requests, additional higher priority missions, changing forecast requirements, forecast weather prob-
     lems, or other operational considerations ensuring productive use of mobility assets. Schedule
     changes must be coordinated with the affected stations and approved by one of the following:
AMCI11-206 1 JUNE 1999                                                                                  29


       9.9.1.1. TACC/XOZ. For ARC aircraft and crews, TACC/XOZ will coordinate with the appropri-
       ate ARC headquarters.
       9.9.1.2. Air Force component commander having operational control. For ARC aircraft and crews
       coordinate with the appropriate ARC headquarters.
   9.9.2. Basis for rerouting CONUS aeromedical evacuation missions will be aeromedical requirements
   and optimization of airlift. Aeromedical requirements includes, but are not limited to, Aeromedical
   Staging Facility (ASF) patient capabilities, specific patient requirements, and forecast aeromedical
   airlift capability for further movement of patients to destination hospitals, and location of other air-
   craft operating in the system and their mission priority. Most aeromedical evacuation missions operat-
   ing to and within CONUS generally require further patient movement by C-9 missions. Interface with
   the C-9 aeromedical evacuation missions is extremely important. The GPMRC coordinates patient
   airlift requirements within CONUS and offshore areas. Additionally, they coordinate strategic aero-
   medical interface with the appropriate overseas Theater Patient Movement Requirements Center
   (TPMRC) and TACC/XOOMM (Strategic Aeromedical Airlift Branch).

9.10. Operational Support Flights:
   9.10.1. AMC active duty operational support flights must be limited. They require GDSS, C2IPS, and
   ADANS message traffic (and telephone coordination with the AMC airlift director as needed) to
   insure managers are aware of all operations. Positioning, depositioning, support and ferry missions in
   CONUS may be used for operational support flights.

9.11. Replacement Aircraft. Aircraft on high priority missions with actual or potential extended devia-
tions may be replaced provided the selected aircraft does not negatively impact the mission or aircraft
integrity.

                                               Chapter 10

                                       AMC STANDBY FORCES

10.1. Policy. While AMC policy is generally to keep a minimum number of aircrews and aircraft on
short-notice standby, it is sometimes necessary to have a standby force capability. Therefore, AMC air-
crews and aircraft must be ready to respond to short-notice mobility tasks. AMC-gained AFRC/ANG
units will not normally be requested to perform home station standby duties. Units flying AMC missions
may be placed into standby status at en route locations.
     10.1.1. Standby Forces Capability:
        10.1.1.1. ALFA Standby. Crews shall be ready to take off within 1 hour after notification for
        C-141, KC-10, KC-135, and C-17 aircraft. C-5 can take off within 1.5 hours. Crews will be bil-
        leted at a location that will allow them to meet launch requirements. This will normally be on base.
        10.1.1.2. BRAVO Standby. Crews shall be ready to take off within 3 hours after notification for
        C-141, KC-10, KC-135, and C-17. C-5 can take off within 3.5 hours. Crews may be billeted on or
        off base.
        10.1.1.3. CHARLIE Standby. Crews shall be identified and capable of entering crew rest within 2
        hours of TACC notification to their controlling unit, becoming legal for alert 12 hours later. Crews
        may then be placed in ALFA or BRAVO alert, or may be tasked to fly a mission. As with BRAVO,
        TACC will task wings to provide a specific number of CHARLIE crews.
        10.1.1.4. Wing Standby Forces. As established by unit commander.
        10.1.1.5. PHOENIX BANNER. See AFI 11-289, PHOENIX BANNER, PHOENIX SILVER, and
        PHOENIX COPPER Operations.
     10.1.2. Authority:
        10.1.2.1. TACC commander may establish and task ALFA, BRAVO, or CHARLIE standby forces
        for priority missions. TACC will coordinate with ANGRC/DOC or USAFR/DOOC as appropriate
        for standby forces.
        10.1.2.2. Unit commanders may establish a wing standby force over and above other standby
        forces, when expecting short-notice priority taskings.
     10.1.3. Forming the Standby Force. A standby force is formed when the unit completes the actions
     that will allow the aircraft to take off or crews to enter crew rest in the specified time. NOTE: AMC
     Commander may waive any crew rest periods but normally only during high priority mobility tasks or
     changes in unit readiness.
        10.1.3.1. ALFA.
            10.1.3.1.1. Form ALFA standby forces as soon as possible after being tasked.
            10.1.3.1.2. This force is ready when the aircraft is configured, serviced, and mission capable,
            and the crew has completed the preflight up to "Before Starting Engines/Ready To Start
            Engines Checklist" and is legal for alert.
            10.1.3.1.3. Units must plan to keep tasked aircraft on standby for 48 hours. Exceptions require
            TACC coordination.
AMCI11-206 1 JUNE 1999                                                                                     31


     10.1.3.2. BRAVO.
         10.1.3.2.1. Form BRAVO standby forces ASAP after notification.
         10.1.3.2.2. This force is ready when the crew has completed prestandby crew rest and is legal
         for alert.
     10.1.3.3. CHARLIE.
         10.1.3.3.1. Form CHARLIE standby forces ASAP after notification.
         10.1.3.3.2. This force is ready when the crew has been identified of their standby responsibil-
         ities and they can be notified to enter crew rest within 2 hours of TACC notification.
     10.1.3.4. Unit commanders may form wing standby forces at their discretion. NOTE: When
     ALFA or BRAVO standby forces are launched, a new standby force must be formed using the cri-
     teria in paragraphs 10.1.3., 10.1.4.1., and 10.1.4.2. after the takeoff of the original standby aircraft.
     If activated, CHARLIE standby forces do not need backfill unless specifically tasked by TACC. If
     not activated, wings will continue the CHARLIE alert commitment until relieved by TACC.
  10.1.4. Standby Force Management and Crew Rest:
     10.1.4.1. ALFA Standby.
         10.1.4.1.1. Aircrews must have 12 hours of prestandby crew rest before or after aircraft pre-
         flight.
         10.1.4.1.2. Aircrews must complete all preflight duties within 6 hours of crew show time. If
         preflight time exceeds 6 hours, the crew must have an additional 12-hour prestandby crew rest.
         10.1.4.1.3. Once an ALFA standby force is formed, additional preflights may be necessary to
         maintain the ALFA aircraft. Additional preflights which are started and completed during nor-
         mal waking hours do not interrupt predeparture crew rest.
     10.1.4.2. BRAVO Standby. Crews may be alerted after 12 hours of prestandby crew rest. Preflight
     duties are not authorized during crew rest.
     10.1.4.3. CHARLIE Standby. Crews are not restricted from normal duties and activities while on
     CHARLIE standby. Crews must be physically available to enter crew rest within 2 hours of TACC
     notification of the controlling unit. If crews are alerted to enter crew rest, the TACC will direct
     appropriate crew actions following the crew rest period (assume ALFA or BRAVO standby, or fly
     a mission). CHARLIE standby duty is considered complete for the standby crew upon notification
     to enter crew rest.
     10.1.4.4. Wing Standby.
         10.1.4.4.1. Wing commanders must give wing standby crews normal predeparture crew rest
         IAW AFI 11-2-MDS Specific, Volume III.
         10.1.4.4.2. Standby duty is limited to 12 hours. Crews will receive at least 12 hours of crew
         rest prior to another 12 hours of standby duty.
     10.1.4.5. Post-standby missions. Upon completion of standby duty, aircrew members may be dis-
     patched on a mission.
32                                                                            AMCI11-206 1 JUNE 1999


            10.1.4.5.1. Standby duty and predeparture crew rest may be concurrent if notification is pro-
            vided at least 12 hours before departure.
            10.1.4.5.2. If started, post-standby crew rest must be completed before the start of predepar-
            ture crew rest.
            10.1.4.5.3. If an aircrew member is dispatched on a mission in lieu of post-standby crew rest,
            compute the post-mission crew rest time on standby time plus mission time (do not include
            CHARLIE standby time).
        10.1.4.6. Post-Standby Crew Rest. Aircrew members not dispatched on a mission following
        standby duty will receive post-mission standby crew rest as follows:
            10.1.4.6.1. If standby duty was performed away from normal quarters, crew rest time is com-
            puted from this standby time on the same basis as for mission time.
            10.1.4.6.2. If standby duty was performed in normal quarters, no crew rest time is authorized.
            EXCEPTION: For wing standby, see paragraph 10.1.4.4.
     10.1.5. Command and Control. The TACC commander controls the AMC standby force. TACC may
     direct fuel loads, planned routing configurations, basic aircrew, or other specific details. All standby
     force tasking information and subsequent changes will be sent through command and control channels
     so that TACC and wing command posts will have current standby force status at all times.
     10.1.6. Crew Duty Time.
        10.1.6.1. Do not keep ALFA standby crews on duty for more than 48 hours. ALFA crew duty time
        begins when the unit is told to launch unless the crew is preflighting, in this case crew duty time
        begins when the crew first reported for that duty.
        10.1.6.2. Do not keep BRAVO standby crews on duty for more than 48 hours. After 48 hours, the
        crew must have been launched, released, or placed on predeparture crew rest. Crew duty time
        begins when the crew shows for duty.
        10.1.6.3. Do not keep CHARLIE standby crews on duty for more than 72 hours. After 72 hours,
        the crew must be released for 12 hours before reentering CHARLIE standby or crew rest for other
        activities. Alerting CHARLIE standby crews does not begin a crew duty period.
        10.1.6.4. Wing standby crew duty times are limited to 12 hours.
        10.1.6.5. Do not use a standby crew (except CHARLIE standby crews) to preflight aircraft, other
        than their own, or perform any other duties while on standby.
     10.1.7. Standby Reporting. Report unit standby forces status through command and control channels.
     Report the following to TACC:
        10.1.7.1. Forecast and actual forming of a standby force.
        10.1.7.2. Launch of a standby force. (Report aircraft movement using AMCI 10-202, Volume IV,
        procedures.)
        10.1.7.3. Alerting CHARLIE standby crews to enter crew rest. Notify TACC of the time the crew
        entered crew rest.
        10.1.7.4. If unable to launch the ALFA or BRAVO standby force, or alert the CHARLIE standby
        force in the required time (due to maintenance, weather, etc.).
AMCI11-206 1 JUNE 1999                                                                                  33


10.2. Aircraft Configuration:
   10.2.1. ALFA Standby. As specified or:
       10.2.1.1. C-141: C-2 (see AFI 11-2-MDS Specific, Volume III, Addenda A).
       10.2.1.2. C-5: CP-2 modified with 75 seats installed (see AFI 11-2-MDS Specific, Volume III,
       Addenda A)
       10.2.1.3. C-17: C-2 (see AFI 11-2-MDS Specific, Volume III, Addenda A).
       10.2.1.4. KC-10: Configuration D modified with 75 seats installed (see AFI 11-2-MDS Spe-
       cific,Volume III, Addenda A)
       10.2.1.5. KC-135: Standard configuration.
   10.2.2. BRAVO Standby. Configuration will be as directed by higher headquarters. When setting up
   a BRAVO standby force, the tasking authority will provide the following:
       10.2.2.1. Aircrew qualification and number of loadmasters and/or boom operators.
       10.2.2.2. Aircraft configuration.
       10.2.2.3. Fuel load.
       10.2.2.4. Auxiliary equipment required.
   10.2.3. PHOENIX BANNER ALFA, BRAVO, and CHARLIE Standby. See AFI 11-289.

10.3. ALFA Standby and J-Alert Aircraft Security. Each unit will complete a maintenance and air-
crew preflight inspection when they put an aircraft on ALFA standby status. Secure all hatches and access
doors and seal the crew entrance door with a metal boxcar seal or controllable device, which will prevent
entry without damage to the door, seal, or controllable device. The aircraft commander will ensure the air-
craft is closed and doors sealed before entering crew rest. The command post (TACC/XOC if there is no

                                         89 AW MANAGEMENT

11.1. Administration:
     11.1.1. Applicability. This chapter applies to the 89 AW.
     11.1.2. Availability of Forms. Specialized forms used only by the 89 AW will be locally developed,
     produced, maintained, and stocked.

11.2. Policies:
     11.2.1. General. This chapter outlines policies and responsibilities for management of the 89 AW to
     assure mission accomplishment. It prescribes specific actions which enable the wing to respond to the
     air transportation requirements of the President, Vice President, Cabinet members of the United
     States, and other high ranking dignitaries. Deviations from specific policies may be required during
     certain missions. The 89 AW Commander will determine when operations requirements dictate devi-
     ations; however, these must be minimized to ensure continuity of operations.
     11.2.2. Objectives:
        11.2.2.1. Totally satisfy user airlift requirements.
        11.2.2.2. Preserve an adequate response capability.

     11.2.3. Special Air Mission (SAM). The Special Air Missions Officer, Office of the Vice Chief of
     Staff, USAF, (CVAM Airlift Operations) validates all Air Force airlift supporting the White House or
     any other branch of the Government and acts as the single coordination agent for SAM airlift fleet.
     This office determines priorities of requesting agencies and bills transportation costs to users. Coordi-
     nate all actions involving movement of 89 AW SAM aircraft with HQ USAF/CVAM.
     11.2.4. Helicopter Airlift Missions. The USAF Director of Operations and readiness (HQ USAF/
     XOO) validates 1st Helicopter Squadron (HS) airlift missions. Coordinate all actions involving the
     movement of 89 AW helicopters with the Airlift Division of HQ USAF/XOO. The 1 HS maintenance
     section will assign H-1 tail numbers for all helicopter missions.
     11.2.5. Command Authority. Aircraft and crews of the 89 AW are outside the normal command
     authority of the AMC command and control system. OPCON authority is delegated directly from
     AMC/CC to 89 AW commander.
     11.2.6. Operational Control-Fixed Wing:
        11.2.6.1. CVAM Airlift Operations validates 89 AW special air missions.
        11.2.6.2. The 1 AS and 99 AS commanders schedule training missions subject to the mission/alert
        requirements.
        11.2.6.3. The 89 AW Commander delegates primary responsibility for mission management to
        the aircraft commander. Aircraft commanders, as representatives of the 89 AW Commander, are
        the final authority for all operational matters pertaining to their aircraft, crew, and mission.

       11.2.6.4. Planning. The 89 AW current operations branch (OSO) acts as the single point of contact
       for mission assignment from HQ USAF/CVAM and TACC/XOF. The 89 OSS/OSO acts as exec-
       utive agent for 89 AW commander to ensure missions are planned and executed as tasked by HQ
       USAF/CVAM and TACC/XOF. During the mission planning phase, 89 OSS/OSO acts as liaison
       between the aircraft commander and HQ USAF/CVAM or TACC/XOF.
       11.2.6.5. Execution. In coordination with 89 OSS/OSO, the Andrews command post acts as the
       executive agent for the 89 AW Commander on command and control matters. The 89 OSS/OSO
       acts as liaison between SAM aircraft commanders and HQ USAF/CVAM through the Andrews
       command post.
   11.2.7. Operational Control-Helicopters:
       11.2.7.1. The USAF Director of Operations and Readiness (HQ USAF/XOO) is the primary task-
       ing agent for 89 AW helicopter operations. Coordinate all actions involving movement of 89 AW
       helicopters with HQ USAF/XOO.

12.1. Administration:
   12.1.1. Applicability. This chapter applies to Headquarters AMC, 375 AW, its airlift and aeromedical
   evacuation squadron and detachments, and those en route elements which support 375 AW airlift mis-
   sions.
   12.1.2. Supplements. To standardize command operations, do not supplement the basic policies or
   responsibilities laid out in this instruction. Supplements may only amplify or refine particulars of this
   instruction. Send copies of any supplement to 375 OPG/CC, HQ AMC/DOO, and TACC/XO.

12.2. Policies:
   12.2.1. General. This chapter establishes policies for managing aircrews and aircraft during normal
   operations. These policies are flexible to meet changing requirements. Commanders may deviate from
   these policies only when absolutely essential to meet operational requirements. Report all com-
   mander's deviations through 375 OPG channels.

8.4.1. SRT and Firm SRT (FSRT) are scheduling tools used by air mobility units to predict when crews
will return to home station. It allows force managers to plan aircrew availability and provides crews visi-
bility over monthly flying activities. AMC and AMC-gained C-5, C-9, KC-10, KC-135, C-141, and C-17
aircrews (except those on standby at home station) will have an SRT established on their flight orders.
Units, aircrews, and C2 agencies (including TACC) must be aware that flight orders and AMC Form 59
SRT entries refer to mission end time, not FSRT. FSRT must be computed as in 8.4.1.1. below. The FSRT
for the crew will be entered in the crew information section of the flight orders.
8.4.1.1. Computations. Wing/group current operations will calculate SRTs using the mission end time.
The SRT is the same as the scheduled mission end time and will be used on the AMC Form 59 for tracking
purposes. Mission end time is defined as the time the aircrew is scheduled to return to home station based
on scheduled mission timing or return times printed in OPORDs (for deployments). AMC’s goal is to
return all crews to home station NLT 2 hours past SRT. FSRT for active duty, is scheduled mission end
time plus 48 hours. ANG and AFRC is defined as SRT plus 24 hours.
8.4.1.3. Missions of unknown duration (e.g., contingencies). SRT is determined by the TACC/XOO. SRTs
for ARC crews flying contingency missions will be coordinated with HQ AFRC or ANGRC.
8.4.1.5. C-130 Unit Deployments. SRT is computed as scheduled redeployment date (or deployment dura-
tion). Deployed units will adhere to SRT specified in deployment orders.
8.4.1.6. BRAVO/ALFA alert. Crews on alert will have “TBD” on their orders for an SRT. Upon notifica-
tion, the controlling agency (normally the TACC) will determine SRT based on projected mission dura-
tion, enter this SRT in the Global Decision Support System (GDSS) and inform the aircraft commander.
If launching against a mission of unknown duration, the TACC/XOO will determine SRT. SRT and FSRT
rules apply to crews launched from BRAVO/ALFA alert.
8.4.3.1. During periods of routine mobility operations, aircrews will not be diverted or delayed in the
AMC system so as to prevent their return by FSRT. The following applies to both active and ARC air-
crews:
8.4.3.1.1. If it appears the FSRT will be overflown, TACC/XOC will coordinate with the aircraft com-
mander and unit commander to determine the action to be taken. If the crew returns home prior to mission
completion, TACC/XOC is responsible for working another crew. For ANG/AFRC crews, TACC/XOC
will also coordinate with aircraft commander and home unit for SRT overflight.
8.4.3.1.2. Priority one add-ons, natural disaster relief, emergency air evacuation missions, and
JCS-directed requirements will be supported, even when the SRT will be overflown. TACC/XOZ will
direct FSRT overflight for active duty crews, when required on a case-by-case basis. TACC/XOZ will
coordinate with ANG/AFRC aircraft commander and unit commander for FSRT overflight approval.
8.4.3.2. For active units, TACC will notify the crew and parent wing of the new expected return time. If
the home wing or group identifies an overriding problem associated with keeping an individual crew
member past their FSRT, the home station command post will notify TACC of the special circumstances.
TACC/XOZ will make every effort to meet special circumstance requests.
40                                                                            AMCI11-206 1 JUNE 1999


8.4.3.3. For ANG/AFRC units. FSRTs for ANG/AFRC aircrews will be considered firm and will not be
overflown without the approval of the aircraft commander and the parent unit. ANG/AFRC units will be
notified of pending SRT and FSRT overflight as early as possible so a crew replacement may be accom-
plished, or crew member extension approved, if needed.
8.4.3.4. All replacement crew members travel in ACM status (positioning/depositioning crewmember)
according to AMCI 11-208, Tanker/Airlift Operations. If this is impossible, HQ AMC TACC/XOCA will
verify that no military or contract transportation is available, then call the unit commander, associate wing
commander (AFRC) or wing/group commander (ANG) for approval to send the crew members(s) via
commercial transportation. ll crew members on AMC missions may use DD Form 1610 for commercial
transportation if required (see MACR/AFRESR 45-14, Management of the Reserve Associate Program,
chapter 3, for funding provisions). In addition, TACC/XOOM will coordinate for any required Military
Personnel Appropriation (MPA) man-days for ARC personnel.
8.4.4. Managing scheduled return time. Crews will be monitored closely by TACC and all en route com-
mand and control centers (CCCs) to ensure recovery by the FSRT. CCC must consider SRTs in the man-
agement of stage crews. If SRTs are not a factor, first-in, first-out concept will normally apply. TACC/
XOC is responsible for managing crew members who are separated from their aircraft so they return to
home station by FSRT.

5.3.1. This guidance establishes and implements procedures and responsibilities for AMC long-range
scheduling. The purpose is to improve the efficiency of air mobility assets. There are three desired out-
comes: provide a vehicle for conflict resolution at the earliest possible time; provide a vehicle to analyze
for expected OPSTEMPO; and enable coordination between AMC, ANG, and AFRC under a single air
mobility system (SAMS).

5.3.2. Information Gathering and Consolidation
5.3.2.1. The key to this process is to gather the scheduling inputs from all available sources. The effective-
ness of the long-range planning process is dependent on accurate data and timely transmission. Addition-
ally, translation of inputs into a consolidated picture of future activity is the only way in which effective
analysis and conflict resolution can occur, and is crucial to improving efficiencies in our air mobility sys-
tem.
5.3.2.2. TACC/XOB will be the office of primary responsibility (OPR) for database management. The
AFRC and NGB agencies that have visibility on long-range scheduling issues will submit inputs to
TACC/XOB by the first workday of each quarter. The long-range schedule covers the time period of 3
months out to 5 years. Figure 5.1. is a matrix which shows reporting agencies and the activities they will
report. All active duty agencies will input their data by the first workday of each quarter (1 Oct, 1 Jan, 1
Apr, 1 Jul). ANG and AFRC agree to allow TACC/XOB to download their long-range schedule into the
database as necessary.

5.3.2.2.1. Inputs do not need to be precise statements of requirements; estimates of activity based on past
experience or current trends are acceptable. Estimates should include: type activity, number of aircrews
and aircraft, required base operating support forces, and projected dates or time frames (to the nearest
quarter, minimum). All agencies should tentatively list (not task) activities by wing.
5.3.2.2.2. TACC/XOB will transfer necessary manual inputs into a master database by the 15th of the first
month of each quarter (Oct, Jan, Apr, Jul). This database will be made accessible to all agencies via hard
copy, electronic copy, or web access by the 20th of the first month of each quarter.
5.3.3. Activity Deconfliction.
5.3.3.1. One of the primary purposes of the long-range planning process is to provide a vehicle for identi-
fying and resolving conflicts between events as far in advance as possible. By identifying conflicting
requirements well before their execution, planners can reduce changes, confusion, turbulence, and gener-
ally increase the overall efficiency of air mobility assets.
5.3.3.2. Upon receipt of inputs and following consolidation into a single database, TACC/XOB will high-
light time frames where obvious conflicts exist between activities. Conflicts will be communicated to
AMCI11-206 1 JUNE 1999                                                                                     43


input agencies when the database is made available (per 2.2.2. above). Input agencies are also responsible
for identifying potential conflicts not already identified by TACC/XOB.
5.3.3.2.1. Each agency is responsible for coordinating conflicts with other affected agencies to attempt to
resolve the conflict. This coordination should commence as soon as the discrepancy is noticed and be
completed by the 1st day of the 2d month of each quarter (1 Nov, 1 Feb, 1 May, 1 Aug).
5.3.3.2.2. If there are any unresolved conflicts as of the 1st of the 2d month of each quarter, TACC/XOB
will convene the Long-Range Scheduling Board. This board will consist of a member from each input
agency (preferably 0-5 and below). The board will be charged with developing a plan of action to rectify
the conflict, complete with time frames and OPRs. TACC/XOB will then be responsible for monitoring
the progress in executing the plan. Elevation of the issue to a higher level will be considered if the prob-
lem is intractable or if the board is aware of extenuating circumstances that merit higher level involve-
ment.
5.3.2.2.2. TACC/XOB will transfer necessary manual inputs into a master database by the 15 'h of the first
month of each quarter (Oct, Jan, Apr, Jul). This database will be made accessible to all agencies via hard
copy, electronic copy, or web access by the 20'h of the first month of each quarter.
5.3.3. Activity Deconfliction.
5.3.3.1. One of the primary purposes of the long-range planning process is to provide a vehicle for identi-
fying and resolving conflicts between events as far in advance as possible. By identifying conflicting
requirements well before their execution, planners can reduce changes, confusion, turbulence, and gener-
ally increase the overall efficiency of air mobility assets.
5.3.3.2. Upon receipt of inputs and following consolidation into a single database, TACC/XOB will high-
light time frames where obvious conflicts exist between activities. Conflicts will be communicated to
input agencies when the database is made available (per 2.2.2. above). Input agencies are also responsible
for identifying potential conflicts not already identified by TACC/XOB.
5.3.3.2.3. Final resolution of conflicts will be monitored and documented by TACC/XOB. Input agencies
retain the responsibility to work issues assigned by the Long-range Scheduling Board. The quarterly
update to the long-range schedule will be complete by the 15th of the last month of the quarter (Dec, Mar,
Jun, Sep).
5.3.3.3. TACC/XOB will brief the 5-year schedule to AMC/CC in July of each year.
5.3.3.3.1. The 5-year plan will be thoroughly coordinated through all customers and staff agencies prior to
the July presentation. This will keep all parties informed and maintain process integrity.
5.3.4. Long-Range Scheduling Product.
5.3.4.1. The actual output of the long-range scheduling process must support many types of queries, pro-
vide an accessible basis for analysis, and be portable to many users. These elements are essential to allow-
ing easy identification of possible conflicts, accurate analysis of future levels of activity, and providing a
vehicle for effective coordination under the one mobility system.
5.3.4.2. TACC/XOB will send a copy of the long-range schedule in spreadsheet/sandchart format on the
20th of the last month of the quarter (Dec, Mar, Jun, Sep) to the AMC/DO, AMC/LG, AFRC/DO, ANG/
DO, AMC/IG and TACC/CC. The quarterly report will be sorted by unit. As a minimum the report will
depict the MDS, date of activity, number of aircraft, and number of aircrews for all the items listed in Fig-
44                                                                           AMCI11-206 1 JUNE 1999


ure 5.1. The AMC/DO, TACC/CC, NAF/ CCs and an appropriate representative from the AFRC and
ANG will be invited to attend the annual July brief to the AMC/CC.
5.3.4.2.1. Agencies desiring changes to the format or mode of transmission of the long-range scheduling
product will submit requests to TACC/XOB. XOB will consider requests and coordinate proposed
changes with affected agencies if required.
5.3.4.2.2. The long-range scheduling product should also include an analysis of future activity including
projected annual OPSTEMPO, as well as periods when peaks and valleys in activity can be expected. This
forecast should include estimates of TWCF and 0 and M flying hour usage rates.
5.3.5. Feedback and Evaluation Process.
5.3.5.1. The continued effectiveness of the long-range scheduling process depends on routine updates and
improvements to respond to changing conditions or newly identified opportunities. AMC/DOOO is the
primary OPR for changes to the long-range scheduling process.
5.3.5.2. The primary vehicle for assessing the effectiveness of the long-range scheduling process will be
user feedback. Forward suggested changes and improvements to AMC/DOOO.
5.3.5.2.1. All members of the Long-Range Scheduling Board will solicit feedback from customers. The
5-year schedule briefed to the AMC/CC in July of each year will be made available to customers in
August. Agencies will follow up to get feedback from customers by the end of September.
5.3.5.2.2. Customer feedback will be discussed and evaluated at the November Long-Range Scheduling
Board meeting. If no meeting was otherwise planned, TACC/XOB will convene the meeting for the pur-
pose of re-evaluating the previous year's process. The long-range scheduling log will also be used in these
process improvement discussions.
5.3.5.2.3. The Long-Range Scheduling Board will submit proposals for change to AMC/DOOO by the
end of November of each year. AMC/DOOO will provide staff support to coordinate and implement
changes.*5.3.2.2.1. Inputs do not need to be precise statements of requirements; estimates of activity
based on past experience or current trends are acceptable. Estimates should include : type activity, number
of aircrews and aircraft, required base operating support forces, and projected dates or time frames (to the

10.1.1.3. CHARLIE Standby. Crews shall be identified and capable of entering crew rest within 2 hours
of TACC notification to their controlling unit, becoming legal for alert 12 hours later. Crews may then be
placed in ALFA or BRAVO alert, or may be tasked to fly a mission. As with BRAVO, TACC will task
wings to provide a specific number of CHARLIE crews.
10.1.1.4. Wing Standby Forces. As established by unit commander.
10.1.1.5. PHOENIX BANNER. See AFI 11-289, Phoenix Banner, Phoenix Silver, and Phoenix Copper
Operations.
10.1.2.1. TACC commander may establish and task ALFA, BRAVO, or CHARLIE standby forces for pri-
ority missions. TACC will coordinate with ANGRC/DOC or USAFR/DOOC as appropriate for standby
forces.
10.1.2.2. Unit commanders may establish a wing standby force over and above other standby forces,
when expecting short-notice priority taskings.
10.1.3. Forming the Standby Force. A standby force is formed when the unit completes the actions that
will allow the aircraft to take off or crews to enter crew rest in the specified time. NOTE: AMC Com-
mander may waive any crew rest periods but normally only during high priority mobility tasks or changes
in unit readiness.
10.1.3.3. CHARLIE.
10.1.3.3.1. Form CHARLIE standby forces ASAP after notification.
10.1.3.3.2. This force is ready when the crew has been identified of their standby responsibilities and they
can be notified to enter crew rest within 2 hours of TACC notification.
10.1.3.4. Unit commanders may form wing standby forces at their discretion. NOTE: When ALFA or
BRAVO standby forces are launched, a new standby force must be formed using the criteria in paragraphs
10.1.3., 10.1.4.1., and 10.1.4.2. after the takeoff of the original standby aircraft. If activated, CHARLIE
standby forces do not need backfill unless specifically tasked by TACC. If not activated, wings will con-
tinue the CHARLIE alert commitment until relieved by TACC.
10.1.4.3. CHARLIE Standby. Crews are not restricted from normal duties and activities while on CHAR-
LIE standby. Crews must be physically available to enter crew rest within 2 hours of TACC notification
of the controlling unit. If crews are alerted to enter crew rest, the TACC will direct appropriate crew
actions following the crew rest period (assume ALFA or BRAVO standby, or fly a mission). CHARLIE
standby duty is considered complete for the standby crew upon notification to enter crew rest.
10.1.4.4. Wing Standby.
10.1.4.4.1. Wing commanders must give wing standby crews normal predeparture crew rest IAW AFI
11-2-MDS Specific, Volume III.

10.1.4.4.2. Standby duty is limited to 12 hours. Crews will receive at least 12 hours of crew rest prior to
another 12 hours of standby duty.
10.1.4.4.3. DELETED
10.1.4.5. Post-standby missions. Upon completion of standby duty, aircrew members may be dispatched
on a mission.
10.1.4.5.1. Standby duty and predeparture crew rest may be concurrent if notification is provided at least
12 hours before departure.
10.1.4.5.2. If started, post-standby crew rest must be completed before the start of predeparture crew rest.
10.1.4.5.3. If an aircrew member is dispatched on a mission in lieu of post-standby crew rest, compute the
post-mission crew rest time on standby time plus mission time (do not include CHARLIE standby time).
10.1.4.6. Post-Standby Crew Rest. Aircrew members not dispatched on a mission following standby duty
will receive post-mission standby crew rest as follows:
10.1.4.6.1. If standby duty was performed away from normal quarters, crew rest time is computed from
this standby time on the same basis as for mission time.
10.1.4.6.2. If standby duty was performed in normal quarters, no crew rest time is authorized. EXCEP-
TION: For wing standby, see paragraph 10.1.4.4..
10.1.6.3. Do not keep CHARLIE standby crews on duty for more than 72 hours. After 72 hours, the crew
must be released for 12 hours before reentering CHARLIE standby or crew rest for other activities. Alert-
ing CHARLIE standby crews does not begin a crew duty period.
10.1.6.4. Wing standby crew duty times are limited to 12 hours.
10.1.6.5. Do not use a standby crew (except CHARLIE standby crews) to preflight aircraft, other than
their own, or perform any other duties while on standby.
10.1.7.3. Alerting CHARLIE standby crews to enter crew rest. Notify TACC of the time the crew entered
crew rest.
10.1.7.4. If unable to launch the ALFA or BRAVO standby force, or alert the CHARLIE standby force in
the required time (due to maintenance, weather, etc.).
10.2.1.1. C-141: C-2 (see AFI 11-2-MDS Specific, Volume III, Addenda A).
10.2.1.2. C-5: CP-2 modified with 75 seats installed (see AFI 11-2-MDS Specific, Volume III, Addenda
A).
10.2.1.3. C-17: C-2 (see AFI 11-2-MDS Specific, Volume III, Addenda A).
10.2.1.4. KC-10: Configuration D modified with 75 seats installed (see AFI 11-2-MDS Specific, Volume
III, Addenda A).
10.2.3. PHOENIX BANNER ALFA, BRAVO, and CHARLIE Standby. See AFI 11-289.
10.3. ALFA Standby and J-Alert Aircraft Security. Each unit will complete a maintenance and aircrew
preflight inspection when they put an aircraft on ALFA standby status. Secure all hatches and access
doors and seal the crew entrance door with a metal boxcar seal or controllable device, which will prevent
entry without damage to the door, seal, or controllable device. The aircraft commander will ensure the air-
craft is closed and doors sealed before entering crew rest. The command post (TACC/XOC if there is no
