SUMMARY OF CHANGES

The changes highlight local area procedures specific to T-1 operations at Columbus AFB, MS. A
majority of the additions to this publication were taken from CAFBI 13-204. Where there is a
conflict regarding ATC or Airfield Operations, CAFBI 13-204 will take precedence. A complete
review by affected personnel is required.

              2.4.3.1. 48 FTS instructor pilots may use the latest version of the “fan fold”
              checklist that is available from 48 FTS/DOT and refers to T.O. 1T-1A-1CL-1. IPs
              are responsible for their currency. Students will not use “fan fold” checklists.

                     3.1.2.3.1. Local Life Preservers/Life Rafts. If desired, coordinate with Life
                     Support to pre-position life preservers and life rafts on the aircraft at least
                     one day prior to the planned flight. Ensure enough life preservers are
                     aboard for all crewmembers and passengers (when required).

                     3.1.2.3.2. Anti-Exposure Suits. In accordance with AETCI 11-301, over-
                     water flights (outside gliding distance from land) conducted when the water
                     temperature is 60° F or below require anti-exposure suits to be readily
                     available. The T-1 Life Support does not maintain a supply of anti-
                     exposure suits; therefore, do not plan over-water flights when the water
                     temperature is 60° F or below. See the squadron Life Support Officer to
                     determine coldwater regions (as a guide, water temperature south of Myrtle
                     Beach, SC and in the Gulf of Mexico is above 60° F all year).

              3.1.2.5. Cold weather flight clothing. From 1 November through 31 March,
              aircrew members should wear appropriate cold weather flight clothing. As a
              minimum, crews should have the summer flight jacket or leather flight jacket
              readily available in flight when the surface temperature during the mission or
              overnight is forecast to be less than 32° F.

              3.1.7.7. If you suspect a foreign object (FO) in the cockpit, leave the crew entrance
              door closed until after engine shutdown. Make an AFTO Form 781 write-up for
              FO in the cockpit, identifying all lost items. If airborne with suspected FO in the
              cockpit, discontinue maneuvering and RTB via a straight-in.

              3.2.2.1. T-1As will maintain centerline on approved T-1A taxi lines unless the
              aircraft commander perceives a potential conflict. Ground control is the approving
              authority for all taxi procedures and may authorize deviations from the following
              guidance.

              3.2.2.2. All taxiing aircraft will stop and give way to responding emergency
              vehicles.

              3.2.2.3. Taxi Procedures Outbound.
AFI11-2T-1V3_COLUMBUSAFBSUP 26 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                3




                 3.2.2.3.1. Runway 31C/31R: Taxi out of T-1 parking ramp east on the
                 single direction taxi-line, then on taxiways C, G, T-6/38 ramp, and F. Be
                 vigilant for returning aircraft approaching the T-1 ramp on taxiway A. Hold
                 in the hammer head/run-up area. If departing on runway 31R, once cleared
                 to cross runway 31C, continue to the hold short line of runway 31R via
                 taxiway F1.

                 3.2.2.3.2. Runway 13C/13L. Aircraft parked on rows U-AA should utilize
                 taxiway B to avoid excessive jet wash on aircraft parked on the front rows.
                 Aircraft on rows Q-T should use the minimum throttle setting on the turn
                 from the T-1 ramp to taxiway A. Taxi out of the T-1 parking ramp east on
                 the single direction taxi-line, then on taxiways A and A1. Comply with
                 “SUNFISH PROCEDURES” if in effect. Hold in the hammerhead/run-up
                 area. If departing on runway 13L, once cleared to cross runway 13C,
                 continue to the hold short line of runway 13L via taxiway M1.

                 3.2.2.3.3. Runway 13R/31L. If using the inside runway for departure, T-1
                 aircraft will hold on taxiways Lima or Juliet and will not utilize the run-up
                 area.

          3.2.2.4. Taxi Procedures Inbound.

                 3.2.2.4.1. Runway 31R. Aircrews will exit runway 31R via taxiway M1 and
                 hold short of 31C. Once cleared, taxi across runway 31C exiting via A1 and
                 hold short of runway 31L. Comply with “Sunfish Procedures” if in effect.
                 Otherwise, contact Ground Control for clearance to parking via taxiway A.
                 Turn South on B and utilize the ramp to parking. NOTE: See paragraph
                 3.2.2.4.5. for “back taxi” option.

                 3.2.2.4.2. Runway 31C. Normally crews should plan on exiting runway
                 31C via taxiway A1 and follow the procedures described for runway 31R
                 after exiting the center runway.

                 3.2.2.4.3. Runway 13L. Exit runway via taxiway F1 and hold short of
                 runway 13C. Once cleared by Ground Control to cross runway 13C, taxi to
                 the T-1 parking ramp via taxiways F, T-6/38 ramp, G, C, and T-1 ramp.
                 Approaching taxiway J, request permission from Ground Control to back
                 taxi to parking. If clearance is not received, stop on taxiway C once past J
                 and before taxiway A until clearance is received (this is to avoid aircraft
                 conflicts nose-to-nose on taxiway A). NOTE: See paragraph 3.2.2.4.5. for
                 “back taxi” option.

                 3.2.2.4.4. Runway 13C. If exiting at the end of the runway at F, taxi to
                 parking via taxiways F, T-6/38 ramp, G, C, and T-1 ramp. Approaching
4            AFI11-2T-1V3_COLUMBUSAFBSUP 26 SEPTEMBER 2013


    taxiway J, request permission from ground to back taxi to parking. If
    clearance is not received, stop on taxiway C once past J and before taxiway
    A until clearance is received (this is to avoid aircraft conflicts nose-to-nose
    on taxiway A). If speed permits and H is utilized, taxi to parking via a turn
    southeast on taxiway E, turn southwest on taxiway G, then northwest on C,
    continue to the T-1 ramp. Approaching taxiway J, request permission from
    Ground Control to back taxi to parking. If clearance is not received, stop on
    taxiway C once past J and before taxiway A until clearance is received (this
    is to avoid aircraft conflicts nose-to-nose on taxiway A). NOTE: See
    paragraph 3.2.2.4.5. for “back taxi” option.

    3.2.2.4.5. Taxi direction on the T-1 ramp taxi lane is eastward, but opposite
    direction taxi may be approved by Ground Control. While on taxiway C
    and approaching J, you may request a “back taxi” to parking. If cleared to
    back taxi, enter the T-1 parking ramp and turn into the appropriate spot.
    When returning to park after landing on Runway 31, southbound aircraft on
    taxiway A should utilize taxiway B. You should request “back taxi” to
    parking if parking west of row U (e.g. V-AA). Use extreme caution to
    ensure there are no conflicts with T-1s taxiing out. Taxi spacing from
    parked aircraft is 10 feet, maintain centerline.

    3.2.2.4.6. Taxiing past vehicles parked within white lines on the aircraft’s
    respective parking ramps does not require a marshaller.

    3.2.2.4.7. Use two-way taxi procedures on taxiways C and along the T-6
    parking ramp north of “Foxtrot Row”. Use one-way taxi procedures along
    the T-38 parking ramp. When taxiing south on the T-6 parking ramp, make
    an “S” turn at Foxtrot Row to provide added wingtip spacing. When taxiing
    in these areas, use caution for maintenance vehicles, fuel trucks, etc. In
    two-way taxi areas, aircraft will use the right-hand taxi-line.

    3.2.2.4.8. All aircraft will taxi on the yellow lines on Taxiways C, G, and
    on all parking ramps.

    3.2.2.4.9. Taxi lines located in the north and south hammerheads provide at
    least 10’ wingtip clearance for T-38, T-6, and T-1 aircraft in any
    combination. All aircraft should pull up abeam the extended runway
    threshold while in the hammerhead to allow a safe distance for aircraft to
    taxi behind them.

    3.2.2.5. Post Flight. Do not taxi into a spot unless a marshaller is present.
    At night, the marshaller must have two working lighted wands. Do not taxi
    into a spot adjacent to an aircraft being serviced with fuel or oxygen.

    3.3.6.1. If the PIC elects to depart with less than a full fuel load, ensure that
    fuel is available for contingencies that may arise (e.g. single/dual runway
AFI11-2T-1V3_COLUMBUSAFBSUP 26 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                5



                 operations or weather.) As a guide, most syllabus out-and-back or cross-
                 country sorties can be accomplished with approximately 4,000 pounds if
                 weather conditions do not dictate the need for alternate fuels. However,
                 SUP approval is required if planning to depart with less than 4,000 pounds
                 in order to make a required climb gradient (e.g., trouble T).

                        3.3.6.1.1. The PIC may always elect to fully refuel the aircraft
                        based on weather or mission requirements.

                        3.3.6.1.2. Fuel availability. The pilot in command (PIC) will ensure
                        availability of DoD contract fuel at a civilian field prior to
                        departure. If contract fuel is not available, obtain approval from the
                        Operations Officer and coordinate with the fuel vendor to purchase
                        fuel using the Aviation Into-plane Reimbursement (AIR) card.
                        When the AIR card is found missing or expired, services may be
                        paid for by calling the AIR card toll free number at 1-866-308-3811
                        (913-217-9303 outside the US). The AIR card should be used for
                        paying power cart, hangar, towing or other FBO ground fees with
                        coordination with the Sup.

                 3.9.1.1. Local Low-Level Weather. For formation sorties, 3000/5 is
                 required for entry and is highly desired for the entire route. It is the
                 responsibility of the flight lead to have a safe plan for formation low-level
                 entry, split-up and recovery. This plan should include basics such as
                 procedures for join up at the entry point (altitudes, coordination, etc.) if
                 necessary due to weather, squawk number two will set upon split-up, and
                 altitudes and flight paths each aircraft will fly upon split-up if unplanned.

          3.9.7. Local Low Level Routes. T-1s are authorized to fly VR, IR, or SR routes.

                 3.9.7.1. IR Routes. The 14 FTW and Memphis Center established special
                 IFR procedures for utilizing IR-066, IR-067, IR-068, IR-070, and IR-091.
                 These procedures supplement those found in AP/1B and are contained in a
                 Letter of Agreement (LOA). When flying an IR route not listed above
                 follow the procedures provided in AP/1B and the route briefing.

                        3.9.7.1.1. Aircrews should not file the exit point of an IR route as
                        the clearance limit fix. The flight plan should continue from the exit
                        point to the destination. Crews will not reverse course or hold at the
                        exit point unless required for safety of flight.

                        3.9.7.1.2. Aircrews are required to receive clearance from the
                        appropriate ATC facility prior to entering an IR route. ATC will ask
                        the pilot to confirm the estimate for the route entry time, exit fix
                        time and the “LOST COMM” altitude (CBM RAPCON will not ask
 6                            AFI11-2T-1V3_COLUMBUSAFBSUP 26 SEPTEMBER 2013


                             for the LOST COMM altitude for local IR routes). This altitude will
                             only be used during communication failure procedures.

                             3.9.7.1.3. At the completion of the specified IR routes (IR-066, IR-
                             067, IR-068, IR-070, and IR-091) crews shall proceed as previously
                             cleared to their destination airport. Aircraft will depart the exit point
                             in accordance with the most current LOA.

                             3.9.7.1.4. Two-Way Communications Failure. In case of lost
                             communications squawk 7600. Depart the IR route at the
                             exit/alternate exit fix at the highest altitude for that segment of the
                             route being flown and climb to the pre-determined “LOST COMM”
                             altitude. Proceed as previously cleared to the destination.

                      3.16.1. Uncontrolled Airfields. Columbus AFB assigned T-1 aircrews will
                      not conduct operations at uncontrolled airfields until finished with the 14
                      OG/CC training program.

                      4.1.6. Tire Wear Criteria. Use criteria in Table 4.1.1 when inspecting nose
                      and main landing gear tires:

      Table 4.1.1
       Mission                                      Nose gear tire                  Main gear tire

            5.2.1. Single Ship Call Signs. Refer to T-1 Blaze Standards for single ship and
            formation call signs.

     5.3. Cross Country Procedures. IPs will fill out the 14 FTW cross-country tracker prior
     to departure. Squadron supervisors will ensure the 14 FTW cross-country tracker is
     correct before their crews departs cross-country.

            5.3.1. All cross-country communications will be through the 14 FTW/CP.

            5.3.2. Pilots will get approval from the weekend supervisor for any RON changes.
            Inform the weekend supervisor and command post of any problems with the
            aircraft or unplanned itinerary changes. The duty supervisor may add or cancel
            sorties as necessary in order to accommodate operations.

            5.3.3. Use the silver AIR Card to purchase fuel, oil, and other services when your
            destination is a non-military airfield. If the AIR Card is lost, stolen, or damaged,
            notify the appropriate squadron SUP to obtain the toll free AIR Card telephone
            number. The account number can be obtained through the AIR Card representative
            to purchase fuel and services. The Jet Fuel Identiplate (DD 1896, white card) will
            be used only at military installations. Return fuel receipts to the squadron duty
            desk.

    5.4. Cross–Country Planning. Attend the formal cross-country briefing scheduled by the
    weekend supervisor unless coordinated prior for all student cross-countries. All cross-
    countries must sign out at the duty desk and ensure an accurate itinerary is on file with the
    weekend SUP. This should be listed on the AF IMT 4327a, Crew Flight Authorization
    (FA) or other squadron designated form.

            5.4.1. Notify Command Post (Weekend SUP as necessary) after the completion of
            each sortie with call sign, location, sortie duration, aircraft status, estimated
            departure time, next destination, and telephone number. Confirm the status of all
            FCIFs, PIFs and Ops Notes. During normal duty hours, also contact the 48th Duty
            Desk (DSN 742-7847). If any Columbus Special Use Airspace (MOA, MTR, A/R
            Track) is desired for weekend use, coordinate with wing airspace, 14 OSS/OSOP
            (x7560), a week prior, but no later than the Thursday prior. Call the 14 FTW/CP
            prior to the first flight of the next day for any messages.

    5.5. Flight line Visitor Local Aircraft Parking Ramp Escort Procedures. Visitors to
    the local T-1 ramp must check in with the Squadron SUP/Duty Officer for a briefing and
    aircraft assignment. With no Squadron SUP/Duty Officer on duty, report to Airfield
    Management.

    5.6. Static Display Procedures. The SQ/CC, SQ/DO or designated representative will
    brief all pilots selected for participation in a static display on procedures, responsibilities,
    and decorum. The aircraft commander will inspect the aircraft selected for a static display
    prior to departing CAFB. Refer to AFI 11-209 for additional guidance.

    5.7. Local Flying. Local flying is defined as an aircraft that takes off from CAFB and
    plans to land at CAFB or Auxiliary airfield in one sortie. Local flying operations are
    normally conducted primarily under the control of Columbus RAPCON, Memphis Center,
    Atlanta Center, Birmingham Approach, Montgomery Approach, Huntsville Approach,
    Jackson Approach and Meridian Approach.

    5.8. Ground Operations
AFI11-2T-1V3_COLUMBUSAFBSUP 26 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                     9



            5.8.1. Preflight

                    5.8.1.2. Pilots will inform Squadron Ops of tail number changes that occur
                    after aircraft sign out.

                    5.8.1.3. Following any aircraft servicing/maintenance, accomplish another
                    aircraft preflight of all affected areas.

                    5.8.1.4. Perform a post-flight inspection checking for undetected bird
                    strikes, loose/dropped panels, fluid, leaks, etc.

            5.8.2. T-1 engine run area. Aircraft parking ramp and maintenance apron adjacent
            to the parking ramp at the designated/painted spot. To conduct take-off thrust
            engine runs, T1s must have at least 200’ behind the aircraft clear of all obstacles.

            5.8.3. T-1 RSC guidance. ATC tower will transmit the runway is “wet with
            standing water depth X/10 inch” to aircrew when Airfield Management informs
            them a runway is wet with a depth 1/10 inch or greater. The SOF will also inform
            the T-1 SUP the depth of the water, when given.

                    5.8.3.1. T-1 aircrews will treat wet with standing water as wet for T-1
                    TOLD purposes. If Airfield Management reports a specific RSC then
                    apply the required TOLD corrections.

     5.9. Flying Operations

            5.9.1. Flying Status Common to All Airframes.

                    5.9.1.1. Restricted. Weather conditions and/or facilities do not permit full
                    use of training areas, VFR patterns or outlying instrument facilities.

                    5.9.1.2. OPS/Weather Recall. Conditions require recovery to CAFB.
                    Coordinate all launches with the SOF.

                    5.9.1.3. Area Hold. Conditions prohibit normal aircraft recovery to CAFB.
                    Coordinate all launches with the SOF.

                    5.9.1.4. Standby. All local flying is suspended for an indefinite period of
                    time until conditions support a better status.

                    5.9.1.5. Terminate. Local flying terminated for the remainder of the day.

                    5.9.1.6. Slots. Weather is 300/1. Slots provide the capability to continue
                    local flying operations when weather precludes simultaneous T-38C and T-
                    6 recoveries because an IFR approach to Runway 13C/31C is required by
10                   AFI11-2T-1V3_COLUMBUSAFBSUP 26 SEPTEMBER 2013


            all aircraft. Plan all approaches to a full stop. Aircrew requiring a radar
            delay or multiple approaches must coordinate approval through SUP/Top3
            to the SOF. The squadron SUP/Top3s will inform the SOF of coordinated
            slot times. Slot times are a landing window. For planning purposes,
            SUP/Top3s will plan for no more than 1 aircraft to land every 3 minutes.
            All squadron aircraft must land within the agreed upon window. Cross-
            country launches or out and backs should be coordinated with all other
            squadron SUP/Top3s and the SOF shall be notified of the plan.
            NOTE: T-1s may launch down to required ILS approach weather
            minimums. The Wing Flying Status may be “standby” but the SOF will
            coordinate with T-1s on launches during this status.

                    5.9.1.6.1. Slot times will be separated by the following times:

                    5.9.1.6.2. Changing from T-6 to T-38C and vice versa – 20 min.

                    5.9.1.6.3. When wing flying status is slots, T-1s will coordinate
                    with other squadron SUP/Top3s on their scheduled takeoff and land
                    times.

     5.9.2. T-1 Flying Status.

            5.9.2.1. Unrestricted. Weather or facility status does not require an
            alternate for the home field.

            5.9.2.2. Restricted Overhead. Weather 1,500/3. Aircraft will enter the
            VFR pattern via initial takeoff or closed/crosswind from the center runway.
            ATC tower may approve entries from initial, side-step, and North/South
            Gate, traffic permitting. No VFR breakouts. Runway 13C/31C arrivals
            must full stop or have sufficient fuel to return to RAPCON for vectors to
            another instrument approach.

            5.9.2.3. IFR Recovery. If other wing aircraft are operating under Slots
            status, T-1s will plan all approaches to a full stop. Departures will be made
            in accordance with published weather minimums. Aircraft are MARSA
            IAW Columbus AFBI 13-204.

            5.9.2.4. Weather Alert. Coordinate all launches with the SOF. Weather
            conditions may impede recovery to CAFB. Contact the SUP. T-1s may
            continue their profile but will recover with divert fuel.

     5.9.3. Outside Runway Recovery Status. This status informs pilots whether Live
     Oak or Tower is controlling the outside runway. The SOF determines which
     recovery is in effect. When tower controls both center and outside runways normal
     FAA procedures are in effect.
AFI11-2T-1V3_COLUMBUSAFBSUP 26 SEPTEMBER 2013                                             11



                   5.9.3.1 Liveoak Recoveries. Indicates the T-38 primary recovery runway is
                   the outside runway and Live Oak is controlling it. T-1s will not operate on
                   the outside runway when Liveoak is in control except in an emergency or
                   runway closure.

     5.10. T-1 VFR Pattern Altitudes.
     RECTANGULAR: 1,700' MSL
     TACTICAL: 1,700' MSL
     STRAIGHT-IN: 1,200' MSL
     STRAIGHT-IN BREAKOUT: 1,200' MSL
     PATTERN BREAKOUT: 2,500' MSL
     LOW CLOSED: 800' MSL
     LOW CLOSED BREAKOUT: 1,200' MSL

     5.11. VFR Traffic Pattern Procedures. UHF shall be the primary frequency used in the
     pattern. Aircraft shall squawk 0000 while in the VFR pattern.

            5.11.1. When ATC tower controls the pattern standard FAA communications shall
            be used by aircrew and controllers.

            5.11.2. Control. The ATC tower will operate a normal FAA pattern when Live
            Oak is not in place. T-1 aircrews should follow the normal outside downwind and
            VFR entry ground tracks when able.

            5.11.3. Minimum ceiling for use of the VFR overhead patterns is 1,500 feet AGL
            or 500 feet above intended pattern altitude, whichever is higher.

            5.11.4. Aircrews are required to repeat all ATC tower clearances including the
            specified runway. Examples of these clearances include takeoff, landing, traffic
            advisory, pattern extension, ATC tower directed breakout and ATC tower directed
            go-around.

            5.11.5. Aircrews will state “(CALL SIGN), REQUEST CLOSED” for a 1,500’
            AGL pattern or "(CALL SIGN), REQUEST CLOSED, 1,000' AGL" for a 1,000'
            AGL pattern.

     5.12. T-1 Pattern Description. Pattern Altitudes. The T-1 VFR pattern will normally be
     flown at 1,500’ AGL with the option of flying 1,000' AGL patterns if requested by
     aircrew. Outside downwind should be flown at 1,700’ MSL (When turning crosswind,
     maintain 1,200’ MSL until clear of inside downwind). (NOTE: T-1s will normally
     recover to a full stop landing when the outside runway is RSU controlled). When the
     ATC tower controls the outside runway, T-1s may conduct local pattern operations (200
     KIAS minimum is recommended in the downwind pattern).
12                   AFI11-2T-1V3_COLUMBUSAFBSUP 26 SEPTEMBER 2013


     5.12.1. Initial Takeoff from the center or outside runway. When taking off on the
     center runway for a VFR delay, aircrew shall request closed or crosswind from the
     ATC tower. If turning crosswind, the aircrew shall remain at or below 1,200’
     MSL until clear of the inside downwind track, then shall climb to pattern altitude
     (1,700’ MSL). Aircrew shall squawk 0000 until departing on IFR clearance unless
     the ATC tower directs otherwise. To depart the VFR pattern on an IFR clearance,
     aircrew will obtain IFR clearance prior to takeoff when able. If unable, aircrew
     shall place clearance on request at least 10 minutes prior to departure to prevent
     delays.

     5.12.2. Entering the Pattern from north/south gate. North gate is the primary point
     of entry to the pattern for runway 13 and is located at CBM 348/011. South gate is
     the primary entry point to the pattern for runway 31 and is located at CBM
     086/009. The first aircraft to arrive at the gate will have right-of-way. Aircraft
     will fly a heading of 220 at 200 KIAS at 1,700' MSL and report to the ATC tower
     when one mile from the gate with intentions. Straight-in approaches may be
     requested at this point if desired.

     5.12.3. Straight-In from North/South Gate. Aircraft will report “NORTH/SOUTH
     GATE REQUEST STRAIGHT IN.” For North Gate entries, aircrew shall make a
     "C/S XX, POND" call once over the north tip of the catfish ponds. For South Gate
     entries, aircrew shall make a "C/S XX, POND" call abeam a Y-shaped pond 2NM
     south of the electric station (not the South Gate plant), which will be on the right
     side of the aircraft. If approved, aircraft descend to 1,200' MSL and slow to 180
     KIAS as soon as practical. Aircraft will report “4 MILES” with gear
     configuration. If unable to grant approval or any delay is encountered, aircraft will
     maintain 200 KIAS and 1,700' MSL and continue to initial.

     5.12.4. Emergencies. Aircraft returning to the ATC tower pattern with an
     emergency will notify the ATC tower as soon as possible after RAPCON hand-off.
     If aircraft need to analyze a problem (burn down fuel, etc.) the ATC tower
     controller may reserve an altitude or block at or above 2,700’ MSL. Emergency
     aircraft should follow the normal pattern ground track at the requested altitude. If
     unable, advise the ATC tower controller.

     5.12.5. Formations in the VFR Pattern. At the break point in the pattern, formation
     flights will split-up and continue their approaches as single ships. If a formation
     must pass the break point and fly straight through, formations will split-up past the
     departure end and turn into the crosswind pattern.

     5.12.6. VFR Pattern Breakout to Radar. Aircraft will climb to 2,500' MSL at a
     heading of 040, contact RAPCON (Ch 16) and make a request.

     5.12.7. Night Procedures. Pattern procedures are the same as during the day
     except there are no practice breakouts between sunset and sunrise. For actual night
AFI11-2T-1V3_COLUMBUSAFBSUP 26 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                  13



            breakouts, climb to 2,500’ MSL heading 040, contact RAPCON (CH 16), and
            make request.

                    5.12.7.1. Aircraft will NOT re-enter the pattern at north/south gate.

     5.13. Radar Traffic Patterns and Speeds. T-1 Aircraft shall fly 250 KIAS on RADAR
     downwind and base. Aircraft shall maintain 250 KIAS until on final approach and inside
     13 DME. If being vectored on base inside 13 DME, aircraft should begin slowing from
     250 KIAS at 13 miles from touchdown. Aircraft shall maintain 180 KIAS until inside 9
     DME. Radar patterns are depicted as follows.

     Figure 5.1. T-1 Pattern.




     5.14. Standard/Local Climb Out. In order to protect the 360 degree overhead pattern
     when the weather is VFR (ceiling of 1,500 feet and visibility of 3 statute miles or greater),
     the standard instrument climb out procedure for runway 13C/31C is, “FLY RUNWAY
     HEADING. CROSS DEPARTURE END AT OR BELOW 700’. CLIMB AND
     MAINTAIN 4000’. CONTACT DEPARTURE CHANNEL 16.” When the weather is
     less than VFR (1,500 foot ceiling and/or visibility less than 3 statute miles) "FLY
     RUNWAY HEADING, CLIMB AND MAINTAIN 4,000’. CONTACT DEPARTURE
     CHANNEL 16." RAPCON may abbreviate climb out instructions for local aircraft by
     stating, “AFTER COMPLETING LOW APPROACH/TOUCH AND GO/OPTION,
     EXECUTE LOCAL CLIMBOUT.”

     5.15. IFR/VFR Clearances.

            5.15.1. (Added) Aircrew will receive IFR/VFR clearance prior to taxi for all
            missions that will depart ATC tower or RSU controlled airspace. Clearance
14                          AFI11-2T-1V3_COLUMBUSAFBSUP 26 SEPTEMBER 2013


            delivery will issue Class C departure instructions, squawk, and a frequency for
            VFR departures. If an extended delay is expected with the clearance, aircrew may
            taxi and inform Ground Control “AWAITING CLEARANCE.” Aircrew will
            inform Ground Control if encountering a problem with the clearance and contact
            Squadron Ops for assistance.

            5.15.2. (Added) On VFR pattern-only sorties, which do not require an IFR
            clearance, the aircrew will state “PATTERN ONLY” to Ground Control on taxi
            request.

            5.15.3. Local Night Sortie Clearances. Clearance Delivery assigns the night route
            and an altitude when issuing IFR clearance.

            5.15.4. Multiple Radar Patterns. No more than five local aircraft will be scheduled
            in the radar traffic pattern during multiple radar pattern operations. If the pattern
            becomes saturated with more than five aircraft, RAPCON may direct aircraft to the
            VFR pattern or to full stop.

            5.15.5. Outside Runway Departures. Aircraft receive takeoff clearance from the
            controlling agency. When departing on an IFR clearance, aircrew shall switch to
            the departure frequency after takeoff passing the departure end. Any time an
            aircraft departs from an RSU controlled runway, the aircraft will be VFR. IFR
            clearance will be activated upon receipt of “Radar Contact” from RAPCON except
            for LiveOak breakout. For breakouts, aircraft will be VFR until issued an IFR
            clearance from RAPCON. (Break outs requesting IFR shall be on a North MOA or
            Echo profile)

            5.15.6. Canceling IFR/Flight Following. To reduce verbiage, RAPCON may
            acknowledge 14 FTW aircraft canceling IFR or flight following with “C/S,
            ROGER.” Aircrew will understand that radar service is terminated, will squawk
            stand-by or the appropriate code.

            5.15.7. IFR Recovery/Slots Status. Prior to departing on either status, aircrew
            must receive an IFR clearance. The IFR clearance is effective once cleared for
            takeoff by the ATC tower.

     5.16. Departures.

            5.16.1. Normal T-1 departures are via the center runway. T-1 aircraft may utilize
            intersection takeoffs from H (Rwy 31C) if coordinated through Ground Control.
            NOTE: If the weather is greater than or equal to 1500’-3, cross the departure end
            at or below 700’.

            5.16.2. Outside Runway. ATC tower will control T-1 launches on the outside
            under normal operations. T-1s should not plan to takeoff on the outside runway
            when Live Oak has control. Aircraft shall not stagger on the taxiway. If the

          preflight requires an engine run-up for engine/wing anti-icing checks, aircrew shall
          perform these checks in the center runway hammerhead before taxiing to the
          outside runway.
          NOTE: If the weather is greater than or equal to 1500’-3, cross the departure end
          at or below 700’.

          5.16.3. Formation Departures. Aircrew may fly a delay up to 1 minute and add
          “15 SECOND (OR 1 MINUTE) INTERVAL” to the end of the ready for takeoff
          call and any subsequent calls to ATC until back in standard formation.

          5.16.4. T-1 aircraft should fly local departures at 220 KIAS until level.

          5.16.5. Formation Departures. Formation flights that require a one-minute interval
          will obtain separate squawks from clearance delivery and will be a nonstandard
          formation until rejoined. The lead aircraft will squawk the formation assigned
          code. The second aircraft in the formation will squawk 0400 until rejoined as a
          standard formation.

          5.16.6. ATC tower will treat the formation as a flight and will clear both aircraft
          for takeoff as a flight.

          5.16.7. Flights will rejoin to standard formation prior to leaving Columbus
          airspace. Centers will not accept nonstandard formations. Aircraft shall inform
          RAPCON when standard ATC formation is achieved.

          5.16.8. If on the ground and the aircrew determines that weather will prevent a
          rejoin prior to Memphis Center airspace, both aircraft will takeoff single-ship
          (separate clearances) and rejoin in the MOA or at the low-level entry point.

          5.16.9. Once airborne, if the aircrew determines that weather will prevent a rejoin
          prior to Memphis Center airspace, the aircrew will advise RAPCON as soon as
          possible and request altitude separation. Each aircraft can expect to squawk
          individual assigned codes given by clearance delivery.

          5.16.10. VFR Departures. Prior to departure, aircrew shall contact Clearance
          Delivery (CH 19) for Class “C” departure instructions to include a squawk and
          departure frequency for flight following. On initial taxi and ready for takeoff calls,
          aircrew shall include the route of flight. Once airborne, aircrew shall request flight
          following and remain clear of Columbus pattern and MOA airspace.

          5.16.11. Simulated Air Refueling Tracks. Use the COLUMBUS departure, West
          profile/canned flight plan for the Berry Anchor, Tupelo Anchor and Greenville
          Anchor. After hand-off to center, aircrew shall coordinate continued
          climb/descent to desired altitude. For the Tupelo Anchor, aircrew may anticipate
          FL 230 when receiving clearance from Clearance Delivery.

            5.16.12. Canned Routes. See CAFBI 13-204.

            5.16.13. The following canned flight plans will utilize the West profile (see CAFBI
            13-204): C1, C3, C5, C10, D1, D3, D5, W1-W5, AR1-AR6, IR1-IR3, and VR5.

            5.16.14. The following canned flight plans will utilize the East profile (see CAFBI
            13-204): C2, C4, C6-C8, VR1, VR2, and VR7.

            5.16.15. The following canned flight plans will utilize the North profile (see
            CAFBI 13-204): C9, N1-N6, P1-P4, IR5, VR4, and VR8.

            5.16.16. Cross-country (DD Form 175). Aircraft will fly profile best suited for
            projected route of flight.

            5.16.17. Westbound departures will file IGB or CLOUT as initial fix, and will fly
            West profile.

            5.16.18. Eastbound departures will file MINIM as initial fix, and will fly East
            profile.

            5.16.19. Northbound departures will file HAB or CBM 008/41 as initial fix and
            will fly North profile.

     5.17. Radar Termination Points.

            5.17.1. Aircraft shall descend no lower than the Minimum Vectoring Altitude (see
            CAFBI 13-204) until making a “cancel IFR” or “contact” call.

            5.17.2. Aircraft shall make every effort to avoid over-flying populated areas at low
            altitude and advise RAPCON of deviations.

            5.17.3. T-1s will monitor RAPCON and squawk assigned code until within
            approximately 3 miles of the radar termination point (IFR or VFR). RAPCON
            may continue to provide vectors after the aircrew has cancelled IFR to aid in
            separation between other aircraft on recovery. Aircrew shall comply with these
            vectors until the conflict is resolved either by visual contact or other means.

                   5.17.3.1. When approaching the radar termination point and able to proceed
                   VFR, aircraft shall cancel IFR with RAPCON. RAPCON will respond
                   with “ROGER” meaning radar service is terminated, squawk 0000.

                   5.17.3.2. T-1s shall remain outside 10 DME until reaching the radar
                   termination point. Aircraft shall be wings level at 1,700’ one mile prior to
                   termination point. Aircrew shall change to Live Oak/ATC tower and report
                   the gate. Aircrews are expected to cancel IFR no later than 3 miles prior to
AFI11-2T-1V3_COLUMBUSAFBSUP 26 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                  17



                     radar termination. If unable to cancel IFR due to frequency congestion,
                     aircraft will squawk 0000 and contact Live Oak/ATC tower. After crossing
                     the radar termination point, aircraft shall follow their respective ground
                     track.

     5.18. Radar Vector to Initial Procedures.

             5.18.1. Radar vectors to initial may be conducted at anytime the ATC tower has
             operational control of the center and outside and/or inside runways, traffic
             permitting.

             5.18.2. Aircrew shall request the overhead approach on initial contact with
             RAPCON or prior to reaching 15 flying miles from the runway. Aircrew shall
             report, “COLUMBUS APPROACH, (CALL SIGN), 20 MILES SOUTHEAST
             WITH (ATIS), REQUESTING OVERHEAD (TYPE LANDING).”

     5.19. Tactical Initial.

             5.19.1. All 14 FTW aircraft may fly Tactical initial in accordance with their MDS
             series regulations and the following guidance. Tactical initial will only be available
             for use when tower is controlling at a minimum 13/31C and 13L/31R
             simultaneously, with a Dual status or better.

             5.19.2. Pilots will request ―”Tac Initial” on first contact with RAPCON. Approval
             for tactical initial is through ATC tower.

             5.19.3. Add ―for “Tac Initial” with first radio call to Tower and report ―”4 mile
             Tac Initial” at the 4nm from the runway.

     5.20. VFR Arrivals. During recovery, aircraft shall contact Columbus Approach at
     approximately 30 NM for radar advisory service and runway approach clearance.

     5.21. Center Runway Arrival Procedures.

             5.21.1. Contact Straight-In Approach. Aircrew shall declare “CONTACT” with
             RAPCON prior to 10 DME, but not prior to base leg. After RAPCON approves
             the approach, aircrew shall maintain 2,000’ MSL until intercepting a visual glide
             path. Runway centerline will be established prior to 10 DME and maintained to
             the runway.

             5.21.2. The ATC tower will direct all frequency changes to departure/arrival.
             When the aircrew requests the “OPTION” to stay with the ATC tower in the VFR
             pattern, IFR clearance is terminated after crossing the runway threshold on IFR
             approaches.

     5.22. Drag Procedures.

            5.22.1. The Drag procedure allows a formation to achieve nonstandard formation
            spacing on final. The trailing aircraft gains separation by reducing airspeed and
            shall squawk 0400. Aircraft are still treated as a single formation by ATC, and
            communications are directed to the lead aircraft. However, each aircraft in the
            formation shall confirm gear is down at the FAF.

            5.22.2. The lead aircraft will request the drag procedure upon initial call to ATC.
            Aircraft shall accomplish the drag and approach in daytime, during VMC
            conditions.

            5.22.3. The fight is considered a non-standard aircraft throughout the drag
            procedure. Each aircraft will confirm and call gear down at the Final Approach
            Fix.

            5.22.4. If landing clearance is canceled, both aircraft shall fly runway heading until
            turning crosswind or, if under IMC procedures, lead aircraft shall climb to 4,000'
            MSL and the wingman shall climb to 3,000' MSL following standard climb out
            instructions until separate clearances are obtained.

     5.23. T-1 MOA Procedures. Pilots will not request airspace with ATC that they have not
     previously coordinated. If an aircraft is airborne and assigned airspace is not available,
     RAPCON will advise the pilots. The pilots will then state their intentions (i.e. continue
     departure, return to Tower airspace.) The full altitude block may be combined if necessary
     for mission requirements.

     5.24. North MOA General Operating Procedures. The T-1 window for the North MOA
     Sector 4 is 0800 – 1010, 1330 – 1420 and 1530 - end of flying. Use of airspace outside
     this scheduled window will be coordinated between the 50 FTS or 49 FTS operations
     supervisor and the 48 FTS operations supervisor. North MOA airspace may only be
     adjusted by the 50 FTS or 49 FTS operations supervisor prior to step time.

            5.24.1. On departure, aircrew shall request sector assignments with Columbus
            Departure (Ch 4) and may expect low block of 8,000’ to 14,000’ or high block of
            16,000’ to 22,000’.

                   5.24.1.1. If aircraft is cleared to a high sector but is unable to reach the
                   block before entering other sectors or blocks, aircrew shall inform ATC.
                   ATC will issue further instructions.

                   5.24.1.2. Once established in the assigned sector, T-1s will automatically
                   switch to Columbus Area Monitor (Ch 8) and report established.

            5.24.2. North Area Recoveries.
AFI11-2T-1V3_COLUMBUSAFBSUP 26 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                   19



                     5.24.2.1. Sectors 1-6. Aircrew will contact RAPCON (Ch 7) and request
                     vectors for desired recovery.

                     5.24.2.2. VFR Recoveries. The North/South gate recoveries are CAFB
                     VFR arrival procedures that require RAPCON coordination. North/South
                     gate entries must cancel IFR NLT 3 NM prior to the gate. If unable to
                     cancel IFR due to radio congestion, squawk 0000 to indicate IFR
                     cancellation and contact Tower (Ch 3).

                     5.24.2.3. Direct North/South Gate entry. Aircraft will fly at or below
                     7,000' MSL prior to departing the lateral boundaries of ATC assigned area.
                     North gate is the primary point of entry to the pattern for runway 13 and is
                     located at CBM 348/011. South gate is the primary entry point to the
                     pattern for runway 31 and is located at CBM 086/009. The first aircraft to
                     arrive at the gate has the right-of-way. Aircraft will fly a heading of 220 at
                     200 KIAS at 1700' MSL and report to the ATC tower when one mile from
                     the gate with intentions. Straight-in approaches may be requested at this
                     point if desired.

     5.25. CBM3 (West) MOA.

           5.25.1. Columbus 3 MOA/ATCAA Scheduling Procedures. T-1s and T-38s West
           MOAs are controlled by Memphis Center and will be assigned sectors by the
           Center. T-1 will utilize no more than 2 sectors at any given time and should try to
           stack in the same sector, mission permitting. T-6 use of the CBM 3 MOA will only
           be accomplished after close coordination with both 48th and 50th operations
           supervisors.

                     5.25.1.1. Aircrew will be cleared into the MOA/ATCAA by Memphis
           Center.

                     5.25.1.2. Aircrew shall switch to discrete frequency when directed.

                     5.25.1.3. Aircraft will proceed to CLOUT then TOMLN. Aircrew shall fly
                     direct to the assigned sector after reaching TOMLN or as directed. Aircrew
                     will establish in a low block of 8,000’ to 14,000’ or high block 16,000’ to
                     22,000’. Aircrew shall not climb or descend into block altitudes until
                     reaching lateral limits of the assigned area unless coordinated with other
                     aircraft in the MOA.

           5.25.2. West MOA Recoveries. CBM3 MOA/ATCAA is controlled by Memphis
           ARTCC (CH 5). Aircrews will use Winona (IGB 266/50), EGUPT (CBM 314/40)
           or Houston (CBM 297/42) IFR recoveries to return to CAFB.
20                           AFI11-2T-1V3_COLUMBUSAFBSUP 26 SEPTEMBER 2013


                     5.25.2.1. Winona Recovery. Winona recovery may be requested from
                     sectors 6, 9 and 10. Depart lateral confines of the assigned sector(s) at
                     15,000 feet and proceed direct to TOMLN direct IGB direct CBM.

                     5.25.2.2. EGUPT (CBM 314/40) recovery. Depart sector at 7,000’ MSL or
                     Center assigned altitude. Intercept the CBM R-314 outside 45 DME.
                     Track the CBM R-314 inbound. When handed off to Columbus Approach,
                     make the same request as if returning from the North Area.

                     5.25.2.3. Houston recovery. Depart sector at 7,000’ MSL or Center
                     assigned altitude, proceed direct to Houston (CBM 297/42). Be at 5,000’
                     MSL by Houston, and upon reaching Houston, fly heading 090, expect
                     radar vectors.

     5.26. CBM4 (Pickwick) MOA.

           5.26.1. Columbus 4 MOA/ATCAA (Pickwick MOA) Scheduling Procedures. T-1s
           may utilize CBM 4 MOA from sunrise to sunset. Berry Air Refueling Anchor
           overlies the top of the MOA 4 from FL 180 – FL 230 in the ATCAA. When the air
           refueling track is active, only the Pickwick low sectors will be available. For T-38
           use of the Pickwick MOA, coordinate with 48th operations supervisor for
           availability.

                     5.26.1.1. Aircrew will be cleared into the MOA/ATCAA by Memphis
           Center.

                     5.26.1.2. (Added) T-1s will automatically switch to Memphis discrete (CH
                     10) and report established.

           5.26.2. CBM4 (Pickwick) MOA Recovery. Aircrews returning to CAFB should
           request the Pickwick recovery from Memphis Center.

                     5.26.2.1. Pickwick High Recovery. Aircraft shall remain within assigned
                     sector(s) until at FL230 or Center assigned altitude and then proceed direct
                     KOBRE direct CBM.

                     5.26.2.2. Pickwick Low Recovery. Aircraft shall remain within assigned
                     sector(s) until reaching either 7,000 feet or Center assigned altitude and
                     then proceed direct KOBRE direct CBM.

     5.27. CBM2 (Echo) MOA.

           5.27.1. Columbus 2 MOA/ATCAA (Echo MOA) Scheduling Procedures. T-1s
           may use the Echo MOA with prior coordination through the 50 FTS.
AFI11-2T-1V3_COLUMBUSAFBSUP 26 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                 21



                   5.27.1.1. Aircrew will be cleared into the MOA/ATCAA by Memphis
                   Center. Aircrew will remain on this frequency.

                   5.27.1.2. Aircrew must coordinate times with the T-38 SUPT and IFF
                   operations. See the North profile for departure procedures. T-1 aircraft
                   may have difficulty making published climb restrictions and should
                   coordinate for altitude deletions if required.

            5.27.2. CBM2 (Echo) MOA Recovery. Aircrew shall request Echo recovery from
            Memphis Center. Memphis Center issues an abbreviated clearance for an Echo
            recovery “(CALL SIGN), CLEARED ECHO RECOVERY, MAINTAIN
            (ALTITUDE).” Aircraft shall remain in the area until at 14,000’ MSL or Center
            assigned altitude and then proceed direct KOBRE, CBM. Aircraft should expect
            radar vectors at KOBRE.

     5.28. High Shuttle Areas. This airspace is primarily used for functional check flight
     (FCF) profiles. In accordance with the LOA, Memphis Center will assign a shuttle and a
     4,000’ altitude block, usually FL 250 - FL 290 or as requested. Aircrew shall proceed
     direct to assigned area after reaching FL 240. Shuttles may be denied depending on
     traffic. The shuttle areas are defined in CAFBI 13-204.

     5.29. Delay Areas. T-1 aircraft may request coordinated blocks of airspace identified as
     “standard patterns” from ATC to accomplish area work. These airspace blocks should be
     used when the local MOAs are unavailable or at other times on a limited basis only.

            5.29.1. Delay areas are not military operating areas. To maintain adequate
            separation between other IFR and participating VFR traffic, file and maintain an
            IFR clearance while using the delay area. Use the terminology “standard pattern”
            to communicate plus or minus 10 radials and 20 to 40 DME (e.g. “Alley 60
            requests delay at Greenville 170 degree radial, 20 DME fix, standard pattern, block
            altitude _____ to _____”). Normal block altitudes include 8,000’ to 11,000’ and
            12,000’ to 15,000’ or as approved.

            5.29.2. Aircrew shall call entering and exiting the delay areas in the blind on UHF
            CH 20 (Jayhawk Ops).

     5.30. Simulated Air Refueling Anchors. The Tupelo, Greenville, and the Berry
     Simulated Anchors are letter of agreement (LOA) airspace with Memphis Center.

            5.30.1. Memphis Center will normally assign a 2000’ block between FL250 and
            FL310 for the Tupelo Anchor and between FL180 and FL230 for the Greenville
            Anchor and Berry Anchor.
22                           AFI11-2T-1V3_COLUMBUSAFBSUP 26 SEPTEMBER 2013


            5.30.2. The Tanker will declare MARSA prior to beginning the rendezvous. Both
            aircraft must squawk IFF when separated by more than 3 miles. Aircraft shall
            advise Memphis Center prior to splitting up for a second rendezvous.

            5.30.3. T-1s may stack in air refueling areas with at least 1,000’ between each
            altitude block with Memphis Center Approval. This is unlikely to occur during the
            following Memphis departure “push” times (1400Z-1530Z; 1815Z-1945Z; 2130Z-
            2345Z).

     5.31. Divert Fuel. See T-1 IFG for diversion checklist.

     5.32. Instrument Procedures.

            5.32.1. Non-Precision Approaches. Conduct TACAN approaches to runway
            13C/31C only when an emergency exists or Tower controls all three runways.
            VOR/DME or TACAN approaches may be conducted to 13L and 31R when tower
            controls both 13C/13L or 31C/31R.

     5.33. Airfield Restrictions.

            5.33.1. Birmingham International, AL (BHM). Operations Supervisors should
            ensure 20 minutes of separation between 14 FTW aircraft. Birmingham is a
            primary divert field for Columbus-based T-38 aircraft.

            5.33.2. Huntsville International-Carl T. Jones Field, AL (HSV). Expect standard
            departure procedure. See FLIP.

            5.33.3. Jackson International, MS (JAN). Noise Abatement Procedures. Runway
            34L Arrivals /Closed Patterns: Turn from downwind to base leg south of Interstate
            20 (approximately 1.5 - 2.0 nm final). Downwind legs east of the airport should be
            flown east of the Crossgates Lake/Rankin Hospital area. Prior coordination is
            required for servicing on Guard ramp. Aircrews taxiing to the FBO should utilize
            taxiway C into the general aviation ramp and use caution due to close proximity of
            other aircraft.

            5.33.4. Key Field, MS (MEI). The BIGBEE recovery is climb heading 010 degrees
            to 7000 feet MSL; once receiving IGB, proceed direct.

            5.33.5. Maxwell AFB, AL (MXF). IFR aircraft requesting practice approaches to
            Runway 15 at MXF may touch-an-go, low approach, or full stop. Aircrews can
            expect a Left or Right turn within 2 DME of the MXF TACAN, climb and
            maintain 2000 feet to avoid Dannelly airspace to the South. Delays may be
            encountered in order to ensure appropriate separation is provided. Aircraft
            remaining in the MXF Runway 15 VFR pattern can expect Left or Right traffic
            and remain at or below 1200’ until departure end and within 2 NM of the MXF
AFI11-2T-1V3_COLUMBUSAFBSUP 26 SEPTEMBER 2013                                               23



           TACAN. When departing MXF VFR pattern, expect a VFR climb to the north to
           pickup an IFR clearance with Montgomery Approach.

           5.33.6. Memphis International, TN (MEM). Notify Memphis Center on initial
           contact if requesting an enroute descent. Expect descent to 10,000 feet MSL by
           Holly Springs (HLI) for normal routing into Memphis International. Practice
           approaches are limited to 1000-1200 hours and 1530-1800 hours local. Due to high
           density of air traffic, Memphis is not a primary transition base for T-1s.

           5.33.7. Meridian NAS (McCain Field) (NMM). The controller may direct a climb-
           out prior to the MAP/DH. When flying the climb-out procedures, do not over fly
           any aircraft on the runway, or interfere with the overhead pattern traffic.

           5.33.8. Mid Delta Regional, MS (GLH). Despite the hours published in the IFR
           supplement, Greenville tower normally closes shortly after sunset.

     5.34. Abnormal Operations.

           5.34.1. Pilot Responsibilities during Emergencies. When an emergency or a
           malfunction requires traffic priority, declare an emergency with ATC and state
           intentions. Once ATC approves a frequency change, contact the SOF, stating the
           nature of the emergency, actions taken, and intentions. If in the VFR pattern, relay
           the information through the RSU Controller/Tower.

           5.34.2. Termination of Emergencies. Emergencies are terminated by the Fire Chief
           after coordinating with the Aircraft Commander and 14 FTW/SE.

           5.34.3. Debriefing Emergencies. Pilots are required to debrief any emergency or
           unusual situations with the SUP and 14 OG/MXQI immediately following the
           flight. Pilots will then fill out all appropriate paperwork provided by their
           Squadron Unit Safety Representative, then email the data to 14 FTW/SE. The
           SUP will report occurrences to 14 FTW/SE when the aircraft has landed at another
           base.

           5.34.4. Definitions.

                  5.34.4.1. Emergency. Any in-flight condition where the safe recovery of
                  the aircraft is in doubt and/or traffic priority is required. Requires
                  fire/rescue personnel response

                  5.34.4.2. Medical Emergency. Condition requiring flight surgeon and
                  fire/rescue personnel response.

                  5.34.4.3. Air Abort/Early Return. Condition which requires return to base
                  due to a minor aircraft problem or weather unsuitable for the mission.

     5.35. Lost Communication.

           5.35.1. Lost Communications on the Ground. When communication loss
           procedures require an aircraft to enter or cross an active runway the ATC
           tower/RSU will ensure the operation is safe and any required coordination is
           completed prior to initiating a light gun signal that will allow the aircraft with no
           radio capabilities to enter the runway.

                  5.35.1.1. Holding for Runway 31C. Aircrew shall hold in the hammerhead
                  and flash the taxi light at the RSU/ATC tower. The ATC tower will flash a
                  white light at the aircraft when cleared to taxi. Aircrews will then taxi
                  forward of the run-up area, turn left and proceed to the parking area against
                  traffic.

                  5.35.1.2. Holding for Runway 13C. Aircrew shall hold in the hammerhead
                  and flash the taxi light at the RSU/ATC tower. After receiving a flashing
                  white light from the ATC tower, taxi down the runway and turn off at
                  taxiway H and return to the parking area.

                  5.35.1.3. Holding for Runway 13L. Aircrew shall hold short of the runway
                  and flash the taxi light at the RSU/ATC tower. After receiving a flashing
                  white light from the RSU/ATC tower, the aircraft shall taxi down the
                  runway and exit at the end. The aircraft will then hold short of runway 13C
                  and shall accomplish the alerting signal to obtain approval from the ATC
                  tower to cross the runway. The ATC tower shall issue a flashing green to
                  allow the aircraft to continue taxing across Runway 13C. Once the aircraft
                  has exited Runway 13C it will taxi to parking.

                  5.35.1.4. Holding for Runway 31R. Aircrew shall hold short of the runway
                  and flash the taxi light at the RSU/ATC tower. After receiving a flashing
                  white light from the RSU/ATC tower, the aircraft shall taxi down the
                  runway and exit at the end. The aircraft will then hold short of runway 31C
                  and accomplish the alerting signal to obtain approval from the ATC tower
                  to cross the runway. The ATC tower shall issue a flashing green to allow
                  the aircraft to continue taxing across Runway 31C. Once the aircraft has
                  exited Runway 31C it will hold short of runway 31L and accomplish the
                  alerting signal to obtain approval from the RSU/ATC tower to cross the
                  runway. The RSU/ATC tower shall issue a flashing green to allow the
                  aircraft to continue taxing across Runway 31L. Once the aircraft has exited
                  Runway 31L it will taxi to parking.

                  5.35.1.5. Arriving aircraft to all runways will exit at the end of the runway
                  and follow standard taxiing procedures to parking. Aircraft will hold short
                  of all runways and monitor RSU/ATC tower for a flashing green light.
AFI11-2T-1V3_COLUMBUSAFBSUP 26 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                 25



                 RSU/ATC tower will issue a flashing green light to authorize the aircraft to
                 cross the runway.

                 5.35.1.6. Aircrew shall return to the parking area using caution and shall
                 monitor ATC tower for additional light signals.

          5.35.2. Lost Communications in Tower Airspace. If the aircraft loses
          communication in ATC tower airspace prior to receiving landing clearance,
          aircraft will continue the approach, squawk 7600, and aircrew will watch the ATC
          tower for a green light (clearance to land). If a flashing red light, steady red light
          or flare is observed, aircraft will execute the go around/missed approach
          procedures and follow lost communication procedures.

          5.35.3. Lost Communications while in RAPCON Airspace.

                 5.35.3.1. Aircraft shall squawk IFF code 7600. If fuel does not permit
                 compliance with FLIP or local procedures or if another emergency exists,
                 squawk emergency code 7700 continuously. Expect ATC to attempt
                 contact on GUARD (243.0) or suitable NAVAID with instructions. If
                 asked to “squawk fuel,” set pounds of fuel remaining in transponder (use 7
                 for an 8 or 9).

                 5.35.3.2. Outside local area, comply with FLIP procedures.

                 5.35.3.3. North Area (except Sector 6). Aircraft shall descend and maintain
                 7,000’ in lateral confines of area, proceed direct CBM 13DME and arc east
                 or west to last assigned runway for an ILS approach to the center runway.

                 5.35.3.4. Sector 6. Columbus RAPCON does not own 7,000’ in the
                 vicinity of Tupelo. Aircraft shall descend to 8,000’ and proceed to CBM
                 330 radial (not entering sector 5). Upon intercepting CBM 330 radial
                 inbound, descend and maintain 7,000’, intercept CBM 13 DME arc and arc
                 east or west to last assigned runway. Once established on the 13 DME arc,
                 descend and maintain 4,000’ for an ILS approach to runway 13C/31C.

                 5.35.3.5. North Area (High Sectors). Aircraft shall climb to FL230 in
                 lateral confines of area, proceed direct KOBRE and execute the High ILS
                 Approach to the center runway.

                 5.35.3.6. CBM3 (West) High. Aircraft shall climb to FL 230 in the
                 confines of the area then direct to KOBRE at FL 230 and execute the High
                 ILS Approach to the last assigned runway.

                 5.35.3.7. CBM3 (West) Low. Aircraft shall descend to 7,000’ in lateral
                 confines of area. Intercept V278, IGB, maintain 7,000’. Intercept CBM
26                         AFI11-2T-1V3_COLUMBUSAFBSUP 26 SEPTEMBER 2013


                   13DME Arc and arc east or west to last assigned runway. Once established
                   on the 13 DME arc, descend and maintain 4,000’ for an ILS approach to
                   runway 13C/31C.

                   5.35.3.8. CBM2 (Echo) / CBM4 (Picks) HIGH. Aircraft shall climb to FL
                   230 in the lateral confines of the area, proceed to KOBRE, execute HI-ILS
                   approach to the last assigned runway.

                   5.35.3.9. CBM2 (Echo) / CBM4 (Picks) LOW. Aircraft shall descend to
                   7,000’ within the lateral confines of the area, then intercept the 13 DME
                   Arc, and arc east or west to last assigned runway. Once established on the
                   13 DME arc, descend and maintain 4,000’ for an ILS approach to runway
                   13C/31C.

            5.35.4. East Recoveries. All aircraft returning to CAFB from the East, not covered
            above, will intercept V278, maintain 7,000’. Intercept CBM 13DME, arc to last
            assigned runway. Once established on the 13 DME arc, descend and maintain
            4,000’ for an ILS approach to runway 13C/31C.

            5.35.5. West Recoveries. All aircraft returning to CAFB from the West, not
            covered above, will intercept V278, maintain 7,000’. Intercept CBM 13DME, Arc
            to last assigned runway. Once established on the 13 DME arc, descend and
            maintain 4,000’ for an ILS approach to runway 13C/31C.

            5.35.6. Lost Communication While Flying Drag Approach.

                   5.35.6.1. If the lead aircraft loses communications prior to receiving
                   landing clearance, aircrew shall continue the approach, squawk 7600, and
                   observe the ATC tower for a green light. If the aircrew observes a red light
                   or flare, aircrew shall execute the go around/missed approach procedures
                   and follow lost communications procedures.

                   5.35.6.2. If the trailing aircraft loses communications, aircrew shall squawk
                   7600, follow the lead aircraft and land (if sufficient spacing exists and no
                   red light/flares are observed). If a go around is required, aircrew shall
                   execute the go around/missed approach procedures and follow lost
                   communications procedures.

     5.36. Alternate Navaid Procedures.

            5.36.1. Alternate Navaid departure. T-38C and T-1 Operations. All MOA
            departures will be via radar vectors to assigned MOA sector. Expect runway
            heading with a climb to 5,000’ MSL. For all other departures aircraft should
            expect radar vectors to a non-CBM defined transition.
AFI11-2T-1V3_COLUMBUSAFBSUP 26 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                  27



            5.36.2. Alternate Navaid Recovery/Arrival. T-38C and T-1 Operations. For any
            status equal to or better than dual, aircrew may expect radar vectors to the standard
            radar termination points. For any status equal to or worse than restricted overhead,
            aircrew may expect radar vectors to ILS/LOC final. If radar is not functioning, T-
            1 aircraft may request the ILS or LOC/DME 13/31C, or divert to an airport that
            has a usable approach and/or radar service.

     5.37. Bird Strikes. If a bird strike occurs, discontinue the mission. If structural damage is
     suspected, declare an emergency and consider a controllability check. Record the incident
     in the AFTO Form 781, ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document. Report the
     incident to 14 FTW/SE.

            5.37.1. When conducting operations at an out base, perform a full stop landing and
            inspect the aircraft following a bird strike. Call the squadron Sup with your
            findings. Ensure an AF Form 853 is completed (see BASH book). Notify the
            squadron safety officer (and Base Operations if at an out base military airfield). If
            bird conditions are encountered that exceed those expected during mission
            planning, attempt to mitigate the hazard and notify the Sup and other squadron
            aircraft as soon as practical.

     5.38. Physiological Incidents. If symptoms of hypoxia, hyperventilation, or
     decompression are detected, terminate the sortie, notify the SOF, declare an emergency,
     and record the incident in the AFTO Form 781. With any rapid loss of cabin pressure
     above FL180 report the incident to 14 FTW/SE. If a rapid decompression occurs above
     FL250, declare an emergency and report to the Flight Surgeon's Office for testing before
     flying another sortie. Notify 14 FTW/SE of physiological incidents as soon as possible. If
     the incident occurs off-station, notify the squadron supervisor and 14 FTW/SE via the
     command post.

     5.39. Dropped Objects. Report all dropped objects to ATC as soon as conditions permit.
     Pinpoint the location of the dropped object using all available aids, including ATC, and
     inform the controlling agency. Inform the SOF and 14 FTW/SE. Record the incident in the
     AFTO Form 781.

     5.40. Index of Thermal Stress (ITS) and Wind Chill Precautions. ITS Caution,
     Danger, and Chill Factor procedures are outlined in the IFG.

     5.41. Hazardous Weather and Lightning within 5 Miles Procedures. Hazardous
     weather can pose a threat to personnel at CAFB throughout the year. Report potentially
     dangerous weather to the SOF or SUP ASAP. Contract maintenance personnel may not be
     allowed to park aircraft during these conditions. Aircrews should use sound judgment
     when taxiing and parking their aircraft. Contact the SUP for directions, but use the
     following guidelines:
28                          AFI11-2T-1V3_COLUMBUSAFBSUP 26 SEPTEMBER 2013


            5.41.1. If lightning is called within 5 miles, stay in the aircraft (unless unsafe) and
            hold the brakes.

            5.41.2. Do not taxi into a parking spot without a marshaller.

     5.42. BAK-15 Operations.

            5.42.1. Pilots will delay switching to departure until past the departure end when
            departing from the outside runway.

            5.42.2. Pilots anticipating the need for the barrier during an abort should
            immediately call “BARRIER, BARRIER, BARRIER” to ensure the BAK-15 is
            raised and available.

            5.42.3. If the takeoff is continued during an emergency, the barrier should remain
            in the down position to avoid entanglement on climb out.

            5.42.4. Pilots expecting a long landing roll, due to aircraft malfunction or runway
            condition, should call for the BAK-15 to be raised for landing.

            5.42.5. If a pilot suspects a short landing or contact with the barrier occurs, notify
            the controlling agency immediately.

     5.43. Bird Cannon Operation.

            5.43.1. The SOF will coordinate with the RSUs and tower Sup for the firing of the
            bird cannons.

            5.43.2. The Tower controller will announce a warning that the bird cannons will be
            fired. Pilots should plan on flying a full stop landing if they do not have sufficient
            fuel to remain airborne for at least 3 minutes after the firing of the bird cannons
            commences.

            5.43.3. The Tower controller will direct aircraft to carry straight through initial and
            turn crosswind as the cannons are fired. This will continue until 3 minutes after the
            cannons have been fired.
