       1.1.4. If an organization loses or damages the equipment, they will reimburse the 12 CS
       for cost of repair or replacement.

       1.1.5. Customers will use permanent PA systems installed in the following facilities
       whenever possible--Officers’ Club, Enlisted Club, hangar 4, base theater, and conference
       rooms. To use the PA systems in the clubs, contact the club managers. For the PA
       system in hangar 4 or base theater, contact 12 CS public address. To use conference
       room PA systems, contact the offices responsible for maintaining those rooms.

    1.2. For events larger than 500 people, units should consider contracting out PA support.
