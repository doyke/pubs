                               GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Airfield Hours of Operation and Quiet Hours. The Tinker AFB Airfield (Control Tower
and Airfield Management Operations (AMOPS)) is operational 24/7 as published in the DoD
Flight Information Publication (FLIP), IFR Enroute Supplement.
   1.1.1. Night Quiet Hours. Night quiet hours are in effect from 2300L to 0600L. Only
   scheduled full-stop landings, departures and necessary taxi operations are authorized during
   night quiet hours. Aircraft are not authorized to conduct engine runs above idle power (see
   3.10.2.1) or practice instrument approaches/VFR pattern work. EXCEPTION: Locally
   assigned aircraft equipped with CFM-56 turbo fan engines (KC135R/E-6) are authorized to
   conduct practice instrument approaches/VFR pattern work until 0200L because of their low
   noise level. The 552 ACW is authorized to conduct practice instrument approaches/VFR
   pattern work between 2300L-0000L, Monday–Thursday, from 1 Apr thru 30 Sep. No more
   than two total combined aircraft from the 552 ACW, 507 ARW, 137 ARW or
   USSTRATCOM Wing One (SCW-1) aircraft, on a first-come/first-served basis, may conduct
   concurrent practice instrument approaches/VFR pattern work after 2300L. If necessary, the
   Tower supervisor may limit or disapprove operations based on existing traffic congestion or
   complexity, staffing, weather or individual controller training and experience capabilities.
   All other aircraft operations during night quiet hours require prior approval from 72
   ABW/CC.
   1.1.2. Day Quiet Hours. Day quiet hours are approved by 72 ABW/CV through AMOPS.
   Day quiet hours are reserved for special events to include Group/CC level or above change of
   command ceremonies. Two types of day quiet hours may be requested:
      1.1.2.1. Modified Quiet Hours. Generally, only full-stop landings, departures and
      necessary taxi operations are authorized during modified quiet hours. Aircraft are not
      authorized to conduct practice instrument approaches/VFR pattern work. Certain
      maintenance related aircraft taxi operations and engine runs may be approved by the
      Airfield Manager (AFM) or designated representative; Assistant Airfield Manager
      (AAFM) or Airfield Management Operations Manager (AMOM). Aerospace Ground
      Equipment (AGE) will not be run in the immediate area of the event for which modified
      quiet hours have been approved.
      1.1.2.2. Full Quiet Hours. Generally, full-stop landings, departures, or practice
      instrument approaches are not authorized during full quiet hours. Certain aircraft taxi and
      engine runs may be approved by the AFM or designated representative. AGE will not be
      run in the immediate area of the event for which full quiet hours have been approved.
   1.1.3. Procedures for requesting day quiet hours. Submit written request (e-mail) for
   Group/CC level or above change of command ceremonies or special events (i.e. memorial or
   dedication ceremony on or near airfield) to the AFM or designated representative at least 10
   working days before the event. Include in the request the type and purpose of event, location
   of event, date/time of event, amount of time requested (limit time to a minimum), highest
   rank in attendance, point of contact (POC), organization and phone number.
 8                                                         TINKERAFBI13-201 19 JUNE 2013


        1.1.3.1. Only the requesting unit may delay the start of, terminate early, or cancel
        previously scheduled quiet hours. This may be accomplished at any time prior to
        scheduled quiet hours by calling AMOPS.
        1.1.3.2. To avoid confusion, only the original POC from the desiring unit may request
        changes to the initial quiet hour request.
1.2. Runway Descriptions. Tinker airfield has two runways (Attachment 3). The primary
runway (18/36) is 11,100’ long and 200’ wide. Rwy 36 has a 1,000’ paved overrun. Rwy 18 has
a 1,000’ stabilized surface, low weight bearing overrun. The secondary runway (13/31) is
10,000’ long and 200’ wide. Rwys 13 and 31 have 1,000’ non-load bearing overruns. A 72
ABW/CE waiver for Runway Weight Bearing Capacity has been approved for specific aircraft
whose Aircraft Classification Number (ACN) exceeds the published Pavement Classification
Number (PCN) for Tinker’s runways. Additional runway information is contained in FLIP
(enroute) IFR Supplement and Instrument Approach Procedures.
1.3. Local Frequencies. The following are commonly used Tinker AFB frequencies
(Attachment 2). See DoD Flight Information Publications for local frequencies.
1.4. Airfield Lighting. See FLIP IFR Supplement for available instrument approach lighting
systems. Lighting will be operated IAW FAAO JO 7110.65, Air Traffic Control, except:
     1.4.1. The high intensity runway lights (HIRL) on Rwy 18/36 and Rwy 13/31 are controlled
     from a single touch screen panel in the Tower. NOTE: Tower selector switch will always be
     based on conditions of Rwy 18/36, unless Rwy 18/36 is closed and Rwy 13/31 is in use. The
     alternate touch screen panel is located in Building 240 with AMOPS.
        1.4.1.1. When visibility deteriorates to, or is forecast to deteriorate to two miles or less
        within three hours, runway-in-use lights will be set IAW FAAO JO 7110.65 (in order to
        obtain RVR information from the FMQ 19 transmissometer).
        1.4.1.2. Runway edge lights for the active runway will be set, as a minimum, to Step 1
        between sunset and sunrise. All other settings will be IAW FAAO JO 7110.65.
        1.4.1.3. Airfield lights may be turned off to save energy during extensive periods of non
        or low-usage according to applicable FAR.
     1.4.2. In the event Tower is evacuated, runway lights will be placed on the appropriate step
     for existing weather and all taxiway lights will be turned on. When Tower is unmanned or
     when the Tower touch screen is inoperative, AMOPS will operate airfield lighting from the
     AMOPS touch screen panel IAW instructions from Tower personnel.
     1.4.3. When airfield approach lighting is inoperative or obscured due to snow drifts or other
     natural weather phenomenon, the no-approach light minima published in the FLIPs are in
     effect. Tower will advise inbound/outbound aircraft via the Automatic Terminal Information
     Service (ATIS).
1.5. Air Traffic Control and Landing Systems (ATCALS).
     1.5.1. Air Force Flight Standards Agency (AFFSA) Regionalized Maintenance Center
     (RMC) is responsible for conducting routine maintenance and an annual Preventative
     Maintenance Inspection (PMI).
TINKERAFBI13-201 19 JUNE 2013                                                                     9


   1.5.2. RMC will coordinate NAVAID down times with the Tower Watch Supervisor. The
   Tower Watch Supervisor will coordinate with AMOPS to send required NOTAMs for the
   duration of the maintenance activity.
   1.5.3. Subsequent to system failure, applicable agencies will restore ATCALS components
   within maintenance response times as stated in the ATCALS Maintenance Support
   Operations Letter.
1.6. Instrument Landing System (ILS) Critical Areas and Precision Obstacle Free Zones
(POFZs). Attachment 8 depicts ILS critical areas and POFZs. These areas are part of the
Controlled Movement Area (CMA). Any personnel and/or equipment in these areas may
seriously degrade ILS performance and/or interfere with aircraft flying precision approaches.
The Rwy 18/36 GS critical areas and/or POFZs are marked by an instrument hold line painted on
the pavement and instrument hold signs or warning signs. Tower will protect these areas IAW
AFI 13-204V3, Airfield Operations Procedures and Programs.
   1.6.1. Rwy 18/36 and Rwy 13/31 Localizer Critical Areas. All aircraft and vehicle
   operations in these critical areas will be restricted when the reported ceiling is less than 800’
   or visibility is less than two miles. Warning signs identify Rwy 13 localizer critical area at
   the maintenance road. Approval from Ground Control is required to proceed beyond the
   warning signs, IAW TAFBI 13-202, Airfield Driving Instruction.
   1.6.2. Rwy 18/36 GS Critical Areas.
       1.6.2.1. When the reported ceiling is below 800’ and/or visibility is less than 2 miles, but
       at of above 200’ and/or visibility at or above 1/2 mile (RVR 2,400), restrict all aircraft
       larger than fighter type size. Do not permit these aircraft to taxi beyond the instrument
       hold line when an aircraft executing an ILS approach is inside the final approach fix.
       1.6.2.2. When the reported ceiling is less than 200’ and/or visibility is less than 1/2 mile
       (RVR 2,400’), restrict all aircraft and vehicle operations. Vehicles will not be allowed to
       traverse these critical areas without contacting the Tower IAW TAFBI 13-202, Airfield
       Driving Instruction. See Attachment 8 for a depiction of the glide slope critical areas.
       1.6.2.3. Rwy 18 GS signal is not protected from possible reflective interference caused
       by vehicle traffic on Industrial Blvd. A permanent waiver has been granted by HQ
       AFMC.
   1.6.3. Rwy 18/36 POFZs.
       1.6.3.1. POFZs require protection when the reported ceiling is less than 800’ or visibility
       less than two miles from the time an approach aircraft is within 2 NM of the landing
       threshold until the approach aircraft passes the hold line. See Attachment 8 for a
       depiction of the POFZs.
       1.6.3.2. In the event that taxiing/parked aircraft or vehicles are not clear of the POFZ,
       controllers are to provide traffic advisories only to the arriving aircraft regarding the
       position of the offending aircraft/vehicles.
       1.6.3.3. The POFZ is considered clear even if the wing of the aircraft holding on a
       taxiway waiting for runway clearance penetrates the POFZ; however, neither the fuselage
       nor the tail may infringe on the POFZ.

1.7. Weather Dissemination and Coordination Procedures. Tower and AMOPS disseminate
and coordinate weather information (hazardous/severe weather, lightning, etc.) IAW TAFBI 15-
101, Weather Support Document, and approved local directives.
1.8. Bird/Wildlife Control. Local Bird Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) program guidelines and
Bird Watch Conditions are outlined in TAFB Plan 91-212, Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard
Plan. Tinker AFB bird watch conditions are published in DoD Flight Information Publications.
1.9. Transient Alert Services. For a list of current Transient Alert services and Jet Aircraft
Starting Unit equipment, refer to IFR Supplement and Area Planning (AP1). Operating hours are
from 0800-2330L. Transient Alert provides follow-me services and has limited fleet services
available (lavatory and water only). Transient services for B52, B1, C5, C17, C130, DC10, and
C135 are extremely limited. Transient aircraft are required to retain deployed chutes to park.
Hangar space for transient aircraft during inclement weather is extremely limited.
1.10. Airfield Operations Board (AOB). The Tinker AFB AOB provides a forum for
discussing, updating and tracking various activities in support of the Tinker flying mission. The
AOB will convene at least once per quarter in compliance with AFI 13-204V3, Airfield
Operations Procedures and Programs. The AOB will also convene on the first day of an AOCI
and 30 days following the receipt of an official AOCI report to address observations/special
interest items and actions taken to resolve deficiencies.
   1.10.1. AOB Responsibilities.
       1.10.1.1. The AOB is chaired by the 72 ABW Commander or Vice Commander. The
       AOB chairperson appoints AOB membership.       See Attachment 23 for AOB
       membership.
       1.10.1.2. The Airfield Operations Flight Commander (AOF/CC) schedules AOB
       meetings, prepares the agenda and records the minutes. The agenda will normally be
       distributed to board membership at least two weeks prior to the AOB. Minutes will be
       distributed within 20 workdays from the time the AOB convenes, to all board members
       and the commanders of represented base agencies, to command levels, MAJCOM, and
       the Air Force Representative (AFREP) of the servicing FAA region.

                                           Chapter 2

                                   AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL

2.1. Runway In Use. Tower will determine the runway-in-use. Tower must coordinate with
OKC Approach Control prior to all runway changes. Rwy 18/36 is designated the primary
runway due to the predominant local winds, its instrument approaches and length. Rwy 18/36 is
designated as the calm wind runway (wind velocity less than 5 knots), but Rwy 13/31 may be
selected for an operational advantage or when winds are more directly aligned.
   2.1.1. Selecting Runway In Use.        Tower will select the runway-in-use based on the
   following:
       2.1.1.1. Runway most directly aligned into the wind as specified in FAAO JO 7110.65,
       Air Traffic Control.
       2.1.1.2. When the wind is less than 10 knots, Tower will consider direction of air traffic
       flow in OKC Approach Control airspace and the runway that allows the lowest
       takeoff/landing minima to determine runway-in-use.
   2.1.2. Runway Change. Tower will notify OKC Approach Control, AMOPS, and the Base
   Weather Flight (72 OSS/OSW) for all runway-in-use changes. AMOPS will notify the Fire
   Department and Command Post (552 ACW/CP).
   2.1.3. Wind Sensors. Wind information will be obtained from the sensor closest to the
   threshold of the runway-in-use. When the wind sensor closest to the threshold of the runway
   in use cannot be used because of equipment outage, etc., Tower will include the runway
   number of the wind sensor used when issuing wind direction and speed. Example: “RWY
   31 WIND ESTIMATED THREE SIX ZERO AT SEVEN.”
2.2. Intersection Departures Runway distance remaining from connecting taxiways is shown
in Attachment 3. Tower shall provide distance remaining information for intersection
departures to all transient aircraft and upon request to based assigned aircraft..
2.3. Non-Radar Departure Restrictions. Unless otherwise directed by ATC, departures are
restricted as follows:
   2.3.1. Rwy 36 Departure. When departing Tinker, will be flown IAW published departure
   procedures (DoD Low Altitude FLIP) or as directed by ATC.
   2.3.2. Rwy 31 Departure. When departing Tinker, will be flown IAW published departure
   procedures (DoD Low Altitude FLIP) or as directed by ATC.
2.4. VFR Traffic Patterns.
   2.4.1. Directions of Traffic:
       2.4.1.1. Runways 18 and 31, left-hand traffic.
       2.4.1.2. Runways 13 and 36, right-hand traffic.
       2.4.1.3. If non-standard traffic is desired/required, the aircrew must obtain approval from
       Tower.
TINKERAFBI13-201 19 JUNE 2013                                                                  13


  2.4.2. Rectangular Pattern. Enter and fly downwind at 3,000’ MSL until turning base leg
  (Attachment 16). When Rwy 18/36 is in use, avoid overflying Soldier Creek School,
  located 1.5 miles north of the airfield at the corner of SE 15th and Douglas Blvd.
  Rectangular patterns are prohibited when cloud ceilings are lower than 2,200’ AGL (3,500’
  MSL) or visibility is less than three miles or if aircraft are not visible from the tower in the
  entire pattern.
  2.4.3. Overhead Pattern. Available on request with OKC Approach Control or Tower.
     2.4.3.1. Standard Overhead. If approved, enter initial at 3,500’ MSL. Maintain 3,500’
     MSL until base turn, then descend as appropriate. Standard Overhead patterns are
     prohibited when cloud ceilings are lower than 2,700’ AGL (4,000’ MSL) or visibility is
     less than three miles.
     2.4.3.2. High Overhead. If approved, enter initial at 4,000’ MSL. Maintain 4,000’ MSL
     until base turn, then descend as appropriate. High Overhead patterns are prohibited when
     cloud ceilings are lower than 3,200’ AGL (4,500’ MSL) or visibility is less than three
     miles.
  2.4.4. Closed Traffic Patterns. Closed traffic pattern altitude for all aircraft (including
  transient fighter/trainer aircraft) is 3,000’ MSL unless otherwise instructed by Tower.
  2.4.5. Go-Around Procedures, Aircraft on the Runway. These procedures apply unless
  otherwise instructed by ATC.
     2.4.5.1. Aircraft instructed to go-around while on approach to Rwy 18/36 shall maintain
     a ground track to the east of the runway at or above 500’ AGL. Do not overfly aircraft on
     the runway.
     2.4.5.2. Aircraft instructed to go-around while on approach to Rwy 13/31 shall maintain
     a ground track to the north of the runway at or above 500’ AGL. Do not overfly aircraft
     on the runway.
  2.4.6. Breakout Procedures.     Unless otherwise instructed, fly runway heading, maintain
  3,000’ MSL.
  2.4.7. Opposite Direction Procedures. Opposite direction operations will not routinely be
  authorized and will only be conducted when special mission requirements dictate. Pilots
  must make their request with Tower as soon as possible to allow for coordination. Priority
  will be given to aircraft using the active runway.
     2.4.7.1. Opposite direction departures will not be approved when an arrival is within 10
     flying miles of the airport.
     2.4.7.2. Opposite direction arrivals will not be approved when an arrival to the active
     runway is within 10 flying miles of the airport.
     2.4.7.3. Opposite direction arrival communications and control will be transferred to
     Tower no less than seven flying miles from the runway.
     2.4.7.4. Aircraft in the VFR pattern will be held at downwind or restricted from turning
     base until the opposite direction departure is airborne and turned to ensure conflict
     resolution or a preceding opposite direction arrival aircraft has landed.

   2.4.8. Unusual Aircraft Maneuvers. Within the Tinker Class “C” Surface Area, unusual
   aircraft maneuvers are those not essential to the performance of the flight. Unusual
   maneuvers may only be executed with prior approval from the AOF/CC.
   2.4.9. VFR Local Flying. The Tinker / Will Rogers Class “C” Airspace (Attachment 19) is
   divided into an inner and outer core. The inner core extends from the surface, up to and
   including 5,300’ MSL within a 5-mile radius from the center of Tinker Air Force Base. The
   outer core extends from 2,500’ MSL up to and including 5,300’ MSL within a 10-mile radius
   from the center of Tinker Air Force Base. Tinker Tower may use the airspace from the
   surface up to and including 3,000’ MSL within the later boundaries depicted in Attachment
   19. However, local training is accomplished utilizing VR-1113, VR-1116, VR-1175 and the
   Rivers Military Operations Area. These training areas are depicted in Attachment 21.
2.5. VFR Straight-In Approaches. With Tower approval, straight-in approaches may be made
to any runway.
2.6. Circling Approaches to Rwy 13/31. Circling approach ground tracks are shown in
Attachment 17.
   2.6.1. Practice circling approaches are limited to base assigned and transient military aircraft
   only.
   2.6.2. Rwy 18 Approach Circle to Rwy 13. Category E aircraft are not authorized to circle
   southwest of the airfield. Category E aircraft must execute a right turn off final approach to
   enter a left base to Rwy 13. Other aircraft categories can execute the same procedure or
   make an approach to Rwy 18, circle southwest for a right base to Rwy 13.
   2.6.3. Rwy 18 Approach Circle to Rwy 31. Aircraft may execute a left turn prior to Rwy 18
   approach end to enter a right base to Rwy 31, or proceed down the runway to enter a left base
   to Rwy 31.
   2.6.4. Rwy 36 Approach Circle to Rwy 13. Category E aircraft will circle northwest of the
   airfield for a left base to Rwy 13. All other aircraft will circle southwest of the airfield for a
   right base to Rwy 13.
   2.6.5. Rwy 36 Approach Circle to Rwy 31. Aircraft will circle southeast of airfield for a left
   base to Rwy 31.
2.7. Rwy 13 Localizer (LOC) Approach. The Rwy 13 LOC approach descends directly
through a busy VFR corridor (surface -3,000' MSL). The approach was created to provide a
instrument approach capability during IFR weather conditions when the Rwy 18 ILS is
unavailable due to crosswind conditions. The Rwy 13 LOC approach will only be used when the
Rwy 18 ILS is unavailable due to crosswind conditions, an emergency condition exists, or to
meet mission requirements. Pilots must exercise extreme vigilance when flying an instrument
approach during marginal VFR conditions due to the possible presence of VFR aircraft.
2.8. Successive/Missed Approaches.
   2.8.1. When a missed approach must be executed, during instrument meteorological
   conditions (IMC) or visual meteorological conditions (VMC), follow published or ATC
   missed approach procedures.
TINKERAFBI13-201 19 JUNE 2013                                                                 15


   2.8.2. Local unit aircraft may be issued “Execute East Missed” as climb-out instructions for
   successive instrument approaches. Pilots given “Execute East Missed” will turn to a heading
   of 080 degrees, climb and maintain 3,000’ MSL. Transient pilots will be read full climb-out
   instructions.
2.9. Radar Services. Radar traffic patterns, radar vectors to initial and ASR (surveillance
approach) services are provided by OKC Approach Control.
2.10. Noise Abatement. To minimize noise pollution for the Tinker work-force and
communities surrounding the airfield, the following procedures and restrictions apply:
   2.10.1. Practice circling approaches to Rwy 18 are prohibited.
   2.10.2. Pilots will avoid overflying Soldier Creek School when school is in session (defined
   for purposes of this instruction from 0700L-1700L, beginning of August until the end of
   May) located 1.5 miles north of the airfield at the corner of Southeast 15th Street and
   Douglas Boulevard.
   2.10.3. Pilots executing VFR straight-in approaches to Rwy 13 or 18 will not descend below
   2,000’ MSL until within two miles of the runway.
   2.10.4. Use of afterburner in Tinker Surface Area is prohibited except in emergencies, initial
   takeoffs, or as required by aircraft technical orders.
   2.10.5. Unless directed otherwise by ATC, when remaining within Rwy 36 closed traffic or
   Rwy 36 radar traffic pattern, climb runway heading to 2,500’ MSL and past the airfield
   boundary prior to executing turns.
   2.10.6. Maintenance engine runs and pattern transition work are restricted between 2300L
   and 0600L daily (see 1.1.1).
2.11. Standard Climb-Out Instructions. Unless otherwise instructed by OKC Approach
Control or an operational advantage would be gained, departures shall be assigned:
   2.11.1. RWY 36: Runway heading; climb and maintain 3,000’
   2.11.2. RWY 31: Heading 010; climb and maintain 3,000’
   2.11.3. RWY 18: Runway heading; climb and maintain 3,000’
   2.11.4. RWY 13: Runway heading; climb and maintain 3,000’
2.12. Civil Aircraft Operations. Practice instrument or visual approaches by civil aircraft are
not authorized.
2.13. Helicopter Operations.
   2.13.1. Helicopters will not overfly aircraft ramp restricted areas at less than 500’ above
   ground level (AGL).
   2.13.2. To the max extent possible, helicopters will land on Rwy 13/31 or Rwy 18/36.
   Helicopters landing at locations other than the movement area (runways and taxiways)
   require 72 ABW/CC or designated representative approval.
2.14. Single Frequency Pattern. Locally assigned aircraft operating in the local Tinker VFR
pattern shall use VHF Tower frequency 124.45; however, when a UHF-only equipped aircraft
 16                                                       TINKERAFBI13-201 19 JUNE 2013


are in the pattern (i.e.F-16), all aircraft should monitor UHF Tower frequency, 251.05 as an aid
to situational awareness unless a higher priority exists.
2.15. Supervisor of Flying (SOF) Procedures.
   2.15.1. All units with a designated SOF program must obtain approval from Tower before
   using ATC frequencies.
   2.15.2. SOF will only request use of ATC frequencies when an emergency situation
   warrants. Normally, instructions of non-technical nature may be relayed through the ATC
   agency.
   2.15.3. SOF will direct all requests pertaining to ATC flight/ground operations to the Tower
   Watch Supervisor/Senior Controller (WS/SC).
2.16. Reduced Same Runway Separation (RSRS). The following RSRS standards (Tables 2.1
and 2.2) may be applied at Tinker AFB to all AFMC assigned aircraft and aircraft assigned to
ACC, AETC, AMC, AFRC, ANG, AFSOC, USAFE, and PACAF.
   2.16.1. Conditions for application of RSRS standards.
       2.16.1.1. Air traffic controllers must be able to see the aircraft involved and determine
       distances by reference to suitable landmarks (distance markers, taxiways, etc.) for
       daytime and nighttime.
       2.16.1.2. Any aircrew or air traffic controller may refuse RSRS when safety of flight
       may be jeopardized. In these cases, apply appropriate separation standard published in
       FAAO JO 7110.65.
       2.16.1.3. Controllers must provide appropriate traffic advisories to aircraft involved.
       2.16.1.4. Aircraft will not overfly aircraft on the runway. For fighter-type aircraft only –
       A low-approach following a full stop shall use the alternate side of the runway and be
       500’ vertically separated when passing the aircraft on landing roll. Responsibility for
       separation rests with the pilot.
       2.16.1.5. Pilots are responsible for wake turbulence separation when maintaining visual
       separation or operating under VFR. Controllers must provide appropriate cautionary
       wake turbulence advisories in these cases. When operating IFR or under ATC
       instructions, controller must ensure standard wake turbulence separation exists.
       2.16.1.6. “Same fighter/trainer-type” means same airframe, (i.e. F-15 behind F-15, T-38
       behind T38/AT38, etc.).
       2.16.1.7. “Dissimilar fighter/trainer-type” means not the same airframe (i.e. F-15 behind
       F-16, T-6 behind T-38, etc).
       2.16.1.8. Non-heavy, tactical airlift-type means C-130, C-12, B-737, etc.
   2.16.2. Non-applicability of RSRS. RSRS separations do not apply:
       2.16.2.1. To any situation involving an emergency aircraft
       2.16.2.2. To civil aircraft
       2.16.2.3. To air evacuation aircraft
TINKERAFBI13-201 19 JUNE 2013                                                                     17


        2.16.2.4. To a touch-and-go behind full stop
        2.16.2.5. To a low approach behind a touch-and-go
        2.16.2.6. To any situation involving aircraft “cleared for the option” or “cleared stop and
        go”
        2.16.2.7. When RSC is reported as wet, ice or snow
        2.16.2.8. When RCR is less than 12 or braking action reports of less than “Fair” are
        reported
    2.16.3. IAW FAAO JO 7110.65, Air Traffic Control, controllers control formation flights as
    a single aircraft and do not apply RSRS standards between aircraft within the same
    formation. Separation between aircraft within the formation is the responsibility of the flight
    leader and pilots of the other aircraft in the flight.

3.4. Taxiing from Confined Areas. In the event an aircraft is parked in a confined area and
cannot be taxied safely, the responsible unit having control of aircraft will ensure aircraft is
towed to a location free of obstructions. NOTE: Attachment 5 identifies areas that are not
visible from the Tower (for aircraft towing procedures, see paragraph 3.8).
3.5. General Taxi Procedures. Refer to Attachment 3 for taxiway surface widths.
   3.5.1. Radio contact with Ground Control must be established prior to starting engines.
   Advise Ground Control as early as possible of critical/controlled departure times.
   CAUTION: Do not start aircraft engines if a fuel truck is within 50’ of the aircraft.
   3.5.2. Clearance to taxi must be obtained from Ground Control before leaving parking space.
   CAUTION: Some areas on the ALC, Echo, and Munitions ramps are not visible from the
   Tower.
   3.5.3. When requesting clearance to taxi, pilots will inform Ground Control of received
   ATIS code.
   3.5.4. Taxi Routes. Tower will direct taxiing aircraft to use Twy G as the primary north-
   south taxi route.
   3.5.5. B-52 will use Twy B, C (between Building 3102 and the trim pad), D, E, EE, F and G.
   Do not use Twy A, C (between trim pad and Rwy 13/31), J, H, K or M. Be aware if B-52 is
   taxied onto Twy C, W of Twy G, there will not be room to turn around. B-52 aircraft landing
   Rwy 31 must make 180 degree turn on runway and back taxi to Twy G. B-52 aircraft
   departing Rwy 13 must back taxi on runway and make 180 degree turn on runway at
   approach end for departure. The approach ends of Rwy 13/31 are slightly bulged to help
   accommodate B-52 aircraft 180 degree turns on runway.
   3.5.6. Primary taxi route between Rwy 18/36 and the MAC or AWACS ramps will be via
   Twy G and B.
   3.5.7. To prevent premature concrete and asphalt deterioration, runways will not be used for
   routine taxi purposes unless mission requirements dictate otherwise.
   3.5.8. Marshallers and wing walkers must be used anytime aircraft are taxied within 25’ of
   an obstruction. Exception: This does not apply to unit aircraft where taxi lines have been
   painted and an approved MAJCOM/DO waiver exists in accordance with AFI 11-218. When
   encountering possible hazards to taxi operations, pilots will hold until ground assistance is
   available and it is safe to continue, or shut down engines and have aircraft towed to the
   proper parking area. KC-135/E-3 aircraft towed or taxied in/out of Echo ramp must have
   wing walkers.
   3.5.9. Taxiing aircraft will yield the right of way to emergency vehicles.
   3.5.10. B-1 taxi routes from ALC ramp:
       3.5.10.1. B-1 departure taxi route to Rwy 18/36 is via Twy D, back taxi on the runway to
       the appropriate approach end, and a 180 turn. Pilot will hold short of Rwy 18/36 until
       request for back taxi is approved by Tower.
       3.5.10.2. B-1 departure taxi route to Rwy 13/31 is via Twy D to Twy G, back taxi on
       Rwy 13/31 to the appropriate approach end, and a 180 turn. Pilot will hold short of all
TINKERAFBI13-201 19 JUNE 2013                                                                23


       runways until Tower approves crossing. Pilot will request back taxi while holding short
       of Rwy 13/31.
       3.5.10.3. After approval is received from Tower, B-1 arrivals will make a 180 degree
       turn on the landing runway and back taxi to Twy D for Rwy 18/36 or to Twy C or G for
       Rwy 13/31.
       3.5.10.4. During back taxi operations, pilot will exit the runway as instructed by Tower
       in the event of higher priority operations (emergencies, real world alert missions,
       MEDEVAC, etc) or upon B-1 pilot request.
       3.5.10.5. B-1 requiring radius swing checks for FCF will taxi to MAC ramp via Twy B.
       Prior coordination with AMOPS is required and MAC ramp spots 3 and 5 must be
       vacant.
   3.5.11. Twy M is non-standard due to 50ft keel width, which may prevent certain airframes
   from using the taxiway.
   3.5.12. Twy B between H and G will be closed to aircraft operations whenever actual fire is
   being used at the Fire Training facility.
   3.5.13. Twy A on east side of Rwy 18/36 and the entry to the old compass rose from Twy H
   are permanently closed to aircraft taxiing operations. Both may be used for aircraft tows.
3.6. Runway Restrictions.
   3.6.1. To prevent accelerated deterioration of runway pavements, hover landings by turbojet
   powered aircraft (AV-8) are not permitted.
   3.6.2. Heavy aircraft will only make 180 degree turns on the first/last 1,000’ of Rwy 18/36
   and Rwy 13/31, except when operationally required.
3.7. Large Aircraft Operations. The unique size and characteristics of C-5, C-17, DC-8
Stretch, E-4, DC-10, L-1011 and other very large aircraft require special handling procedures to
avoid damaging aircraft, airdrome facilities, vehicles, or injuring personnel. Tow capability is
limited, or in some cases non-existent, and airdrome capability can be compromised if taxi
routing errors occur.
3.8. Towing Operations.
   3.8.1. Prior to dispatching a tow team, appropriate Maintenance Control Center or the tow
   supervisor will ensure tow maintenance crew is airfield driver certified IAW TAFBI 13-202,
   Airfield Driving Instruction.
   3.8.2. All aircraft taxi and tow movements for maintenance requires prior landline
   coordination with AMOPS. Aircraft tow operators will establish radio contact with Ground
   Control and request approval for all tow operations on the airfield prior to start of tow.
   Aircraft towed in/out of restricted areas must pre-coordinate and get approval from Security
   Forces. 76 AMXG Maintenance may move non-operational aircraft (no wings, no engines,
   etc) within the ALC ramp, east of Rwy 18/36 without approval from Tower.
   3.8.3. For towing operations on the airfield, the tow supervisor will ensure taxiing aircraft
   are not impeded.

   3.8.4. Aircraft tow operations between sunset and sunrise must operate aircraft position
   lights or be adequately lit, i.e. escorting vehicles, wing walkers with flashlights, etc.
3.9. Last Chance Inspection. Inspection of locally assigned aircraft will be performed by
owning unit personnel in areas that will not block normal taxi flow. The 552 ACW SOF will
determine where E-3 “last chance” will be accomplished. If conducting a last chance prior to
entering Rwy 18, E-3 aircraft will use the north hammerhead with aircraft nose facing southward
away from fire station to the maximum extent possible. Transient Alert personnel perform
transient aircraft inspections.
3.10. Aircraft Engine Run Procedures.
   3.10.1. Before conducting an engine run, coordinate planned engine run with AMOPS by

   department assets as necessary. Chief(#) is the initial incident commander. Chief(#) is
   responsible for controlling fire department assets only. Incident commander responsibilities
   are IAW TAFB PLAN 10-2, Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan. Tower will
   ensure all other ground and air traffic does not interfere with emergency response efforts in
   progress. Airfield 3 or 4 will advise Ground Control that the emergency runway is closed as
   dictated by the emergency in progress (i.e., disabled aircraft on runway, barrier engagement,
   FOD on runway, etc.). All other responding vehicles/units will remain at the location
   specified in paragraphs 5.3.1.1., 5.3.1.2., and 5.3.1.3, and monitor the appropriate frequency
   until advised that the emergency aircraft is determined safe by Chief(#) or requested by
   Chief(#) to respond to Chief(#)’s location.
   5.3.4. In the event Tower needs use of a runway (normally the non-emergency runway) for
   another emergency landing or a priority operation before the emergency aircraft is
TINKERAFBI13-201 19 JUNE 2013                                                                   39


   determined safe by Chief(#), Ground Control will advise Airfield(#) of requirement.
   Airfield(#) will coordinate with Chief(#) and if the nature of the emergency allows tower’s
   request and Airfield(#) has determined other airfield criteria are met for safe operations, then
   Airfield(#) will notify Ground Control when the requested runway can be used for flying
   operations. Chief(#) is responsible to ensure all fire/crash trucks and ambulances hold short
   of requested runway. When Airfield(#) is not available at the emergency site when Tower
   requires use of a runway, Ground Control may coordinate directly with Chief(#).
   5.3.5. Chief(#) will advise Ground Control and Airfield(#) when the emergency aircraft is
   determined safe. Airfield(#), after coordination with Chief(#), will notify Ground Control
   when flying operations may resume to the non-emergency runway or both runways (if
   appropriate). Runway operations will remain suspended until Chief(#) determines adequate
   response resources are available. Chief(#) will ensure all fire/crash trucks and ambulances
   hold short of all runways.
   5.3.6. When required to reduce transmissions on 275.8/121.8 or when requested by Ground
   Control or Airfield(#), emergency aircraft may be directed to change to UHF 372.2 or VHF
   134.1.
      5.3.6.1. Ground Control and Airfield(#) will notify all responding agencies of any
      frequency changes. Frequency changes that may inhibit emergency response are not
      authorized.
      5.3.6.2. Once 552 ACW emergency aircraft have landed, they may request, from Tower,
      to communicate with Chief(#) or designated representative on the CP UHF frequency
      (primary 305.6/secondary 255.875). When requested, Ground Control shall transfer
      control of 552 ACW aircraft to Chief(#) or designated representative on 305.6/255.875.
      This will normally occur after the aircraft has exited the runway.
   5.3.7. Chief(#) or designated representative will terminate the emergency and notify Airfield
   (#) and Ground Control. The emergency runway will remain closed until opened by Airfield
   (#). If situation warrants, Airfield(#) will coordinate with Chief(#) prior to opening portions
   or all taxiways and/or runways. Airfield(#) will notify Ground Control, Chief(#) and
   AMOPS when the emergency runway is opened. Tower will then determine the runway in
   use.
   5.3.8. In the event of an aircraft crash or fire, servicing operations already underway will be
   stopped and fuel-servicing equipment will be disconnected. Upon notification of an IFE/GE,
   servicing operations already underway may be completed. In either scenario, no new
   servicing operations may be started without approval of Chief(#) or until the emergency has
   been terminated.
5.4. Aircraft Bomb Threats. When information is received regarding a bomb threat to an
aircraft enroute to, or parked on, Tinker AFB, the following procedures apply:
   5.4.1. Aircraft enroute to Tinker:
      5.4.1.1. Tower will activate the PCAS. Surface winds permitting, aircraft will be
      directed to land on Rwy 18. Aircraft will be directed to and parked on the south
      hammerhead. If, for any reason, the south hammerhead is not feasible, the aircraft will
      be parked on Twy C between the multi-intersection and the hush house (Attachment 4) .
 40                                                         TINKERAFBI13-201 19 JUNE 2013


       Aircraft engines will be shut down and passengers and crew evacuated. If type of
       explosive is not known, a safe distance of 4,000’ upwind of aircraft will be established.
       Once the type of explosive is determined, the incident commander may establish a
       smaller safe distance. Communication with the crew will be maintained via any available
       means until the crew leaves the aircraft.
       5.4.1.2. AMOPS will activate the SCN.
       5.4.1.3. The incident commander may direct a search of aircraft, and if required, request
       EOD/FBI assistance. Transient Alert, 507 ARW, 137 ARW, 552 ACW, and SCW-1 will,
       upon request, furnish appropriate personnel to act as technical advisors during the search.
   5.4.2. Parked Aircraft. Should information be received that a bomb has been placed on a
   parked aircraft, the following procedures will apply:
       5.4.2.1. AMOPS will:
           5.4.2.1.1. Notify Tower.
           5.4.2.1.2. Activate the SCN.
       5.4.2.2. Incident commander will direct evacuation from nearby areas to a safe distance
       according to AFMAN 91-201, Explosives Safety Standards, direct a search of aircraft,
       and if required, request EOD/FBI assistance.
       5.4.2.3. At the direction of the incident commander, maintenance personnel will tow
       aircraft to an isolated area on the airfield.
5.5. Airborne Chase Aircraft Emergency Assistance. A decision to request or render chase
aircraft assistance will be tempered by sound judgment, a thorough evaluation of conditions, and
the alternatives available. Commanders, 10 FLTS, 507 ARW, 137 ARW, SCW-1, and 552
ACW will:
   5.5.1. Designate approval authority for authorizing use of chase aircraft.
   5.5.2. Determine qualifications of chase pilots.
   5.5.3. Establish procedures to ensure safe operations.
5.6. Hydrazine Procedures. Suspected or actual hydrazine leaks and fired emergency power
units (EPU) will be handled as emergencies. After notifying Tower, pilot will be directed to taxi
to the nearest hydrazine impoundment area (Attachment 4) and park aircraft with the nose
facing into the wind and await action from the Fire Department. The hydrazine impoundment
locations are:
   5.6.1. Twy E between Twy G and Rwy 18/36.
   5.6.2. Twy B, between Twy G and Rwy 18/36.
   5.6.3. Transient Munitions Facility.
5.7. Single Frequency Emergency Approach (SFA) Procedures.
   5.7.1. The use of the UHF frequency 354.125 designated for SFA, will be used by the Fire
   Department only when ATC has relinquished the frequency, unless another emergency
   exists.
TINKERAFBI13-201 19 JUNE 2013                                                                   41


   5.7.2. OKC Approach Control will notify Tower of an inbound IFE utilizing the SFA
   frequency. Local Control will select and monitor 354.125 on the UHF multi-channel radio
   (ensure only receiver is enabled) until advised by Approach that the aircraft is under Tower
   control (enable transmitter).
   5.7.3. When IFE aircraft comes to a complete stop or is off the active runway, Chief(#) and
   SOF may talk to the emergency aircraft when authorized by Local Control to facilitate
   termination of the emergency situation. Local Control will release the SFA frequency to
   Ground Control/Chief(#)/SOF. Chief(#) and SOF will not give ATC instructions or interfere
   with ATC functions. Non-ATC agencies will not give ATC instructions and will adhere to
   the requirements in paragraph 2.15. and AFI 13-204V3, Airfield Operations Procedures and
   Programs.
   5.7.4. When Chief(#) terminates the emergency and releases the SFA frequency to Tower,
   Ground Control will notify OKC Approach Control, via the data ring line, that SFA
   frequency is no longer needed.
   5.7.5. Multiple IFEs or VHF only aircraft will be handled via standard Tower frequencies.
5.8. In-flight Landing Gear Inspection. When a pilot reports a landing gear malfunction and
requests a visual check, the following procedures will apply:
   5.8.1. Tower will:
       5.8.1.1. Activate the PCAS.
       5.8.1.2. Determine pilot’s desires concerning gear pin installation and taxiing/towing to
       parking, and relay to appropriate emergency agencies.
5.9. Hot Brakes. If an aircraft is discovered with or is suspected of having hot brakes, or if
smoke/fire is observed in aircraft landing gear area, the following procedures apply:
   5.9.1. If Tower personnel observe smoke/fire in aircraft landing gear area; or, receive
   notification from a pilot that hot brakes are suspected, they will activate the PCAS, and if
   able, request the pilot taxi to the nearest hot brakes area (Attachment 4) and stand by for an
   inspection of the aircraft by the Fire Department.
   5.9.2. AMOPS will, upon receipt of call over the PCAS, activate the SCN and handle as an
   aircraft emergency.
   5.9.3. Senior fire protection officer will dispatch firefighters and equipment to inspect
   aircraft and contain the hot brakes situation whether fire is evident or not.
   5.9.4. Aircrew members:
       5.9.4.1. Pilots suspecting aircraft has hot brakes will notify Tower, and if possible, clear
       the runway and stand by for aircraft inspection.
       5.9.4.2. Pilots having hot brakes will shut down engines upon direction of Chief(#).
       Evacuation of crew/passengers from the immediate area will be at the discretion of the
       aircraft commander. If a hot brakes condition is confirmed not to exist, the aircraft will
       be released to the owning organization for return to their parking ramp. WARNING:
       Brakes may not reach maximum temperature for 15-30 minutes after maximum braking.
       Always approach hot brakes from front or rear of aircraft, never from the side. Also, a
 42                                                        TINKERAFBI13-201 19 JUNE 2013


       long taxi route after landing increases brake temperatures. Maintenance personnel should
       always check landing gear for evidence of hot brakes before allowing anyone near the
       aircraft.
5.10. Controlled Bailout. If an IFE requires an aircrew to abandon aircraft and the aircraft can
be maneuvered to the bailout area, the following procedures will apply:
   5.10.1. Emergency Transmission. Set the IFF/SIF to “Emergency,” Mode 3, on code 7700.
   5.10.2. Bailout Procedure. The controlled bailout area is 17 DME on the Tinker TACAN
   145 radial (35 11’N, 97 12’W), on a southeasterly heading.
   5.10.3. If aircrew is unable to maneuver aircraft to the defined bailout area, Tower will relay
   approximate location of bailout to concerned agencies.
5.11. Hung Ordnance, Unexpended Ordnance, and Hot Guns.
   5.11.1. Hung ordnance:
       5.11.1.1. Hung ordnance will be considered and handled as an emergency. Tower and/or
       OKC Approach Control will direct aircraft with hung ordnance over sparsely populated
       areas as much as possible during approach to Tinker AFB.
       5.11.1.2. After landing, Tower will direct aircraft to the departure end hammerhead
       (Attachment 4) for de-arming. Other aircraft/vehicles/personnel will be cleared from the
       area prior to the aircraft arrival.
   5.11.2. Unexpended Ordnance. Aircraft landing at Tinker AFB with unexpended ordnance
   will be held on the departure end hammerhead (Attachment 4) until safe/de-armed.
   5.11.3. Hot Guns. Defined as forward firing ordnance which has been armed and requires
   ground safety/de-arming. Tower will direct the aircraft to the designated Arm/De-Arm area
   for the runway in use.
   5.11.4. Arm/De-Arm Areas. The areas described below will be used for arming aircraft
   prior to takeoff and de-arming them after landing (Attachment 4).
       5.11.4.1. Rwy 18/36. North and south hammerheads on a heading of 180 degrees.
       NOTE: During the arming procedure of forward firing ordnance on the north
       hammerhead, no traffic, either aircraft or vehicular, will be permitted on Twy A or on
       Twy B east of Twy G.

                          ABNORMAL/SPECIAL OPERATIONS

6.1. Controlled Departures. Flying units must notify AMOPS a minimum of two hours in
advance of all controlled departures to meet mission requirements (i.e. air refueling). AMOPS
will pass notification of controlled departure times to Tower. Without proper notification,
aircraft may encounter ground delay.
6.2. E-3 “Live Fire” Procedures. Due to the hazardous nature of ground operation of the E-3
surveillance radar, all such operations will only be performed after approval/coordination with
AMOPS. This approval/coordination will be accomplished at least 12 hours in advance. Rwy
18/36 must be the runway in use during “Live Fire”. Change to Rwy 13/31 as runway in use will
terminate any “Live Fire”. Weather minimums of three miles visibility, ceiling 1,000’ AGL and
1,300’ visual clearance in main beam path must be available before and during “Live Fire”
operations. The personnel hazard area extends from aircraft to 1,300’ in the main beam area and
has a 30 degree divergence. Lower weather minimums may apply for special operations after
prior coordination. The preferred times are during nighttime hours. EXCEPTION: Live fires
may be conducted when Rwy 13/31 is runway in use after nighttime flying hours are completed.
   6.2.1. Unit conducting “Live Fire” will:
       6.2.1.1. As soon as approval for “Live Fire” is obtained, notify 72 ABW/SE and AMOPS
       of tail number, location and estimated start/stop times of impending “Live Fire.” Any
       special restrictions, considerations, etc., will be passed to AMOPS.
       6.2.1.2. Ensure the aircraft is physically positioned to accommodate radar transmission
       into an approved “Live Fire” zone (Attachment 4). Aircraft will be parked on Bravo
       Row (parking spots B-2 to B-9), the radar beam aimed to the west of the multiple
       intersection of Twy K, H, C and Rwy 13/31. “Live Fire” from south ramp will be from
       Romeo Row spot 1, with the radar beam directed north, parallel to Twy G.
       Vehicles/personnel may transit the ground “Live Fire” zone during the “Live Fire”
       without shutting down the radar, provided they come no closer than 1,300’.
       6.2.1.3. Provide supplemental lighting of the ground “Live Fire” zone at night.
       6.2.1.4. Verify weather minimums exist; three miles visibility, ceilings of at least 1,000’
       AGL and 1,300’ visual clearance in main beam path.
       6.2.1.5. Verify Rwy 18/36 in use or schedule after nighttime flying is completed when
       Rwy 13/31 is runway in use.
       6.2.1.6. Obtain final authorization from Tower.
       6.2.1.7. Continuously monitor UHF/VHF/FM radio communications with Tower and
       monitor taxiways for vehicles entering the area.
       6.2.1.8. Upon initiation and completion of live fires, notify all maintenance nets, MS
       supervisor, Security Forces, AMOPS and Tower.
TINKERAFBI13-201 19 JUNE 2013                                                                 45


   6.2.2. Tower will:
       6.2.2.1. After notification from AMOPS, make appropriate ATIS advisory of
       approximate time.
       6.2.2.2. After notification from unit conducting “Live Fire” and AMOPS approval is
       received, broadcast on Ground Control frequencies and FM radios: “LIVE FIRE IN
       PROGRESS. TAXIWAYS (Bravo, Kilo, Hotel, and Mike taxilane or Echo and Golf)
       CLOSED.”
       6.2.2.3. Ensure appropriate taxiways and airspace west of Rwy 18/36 below 3,000’ MSL
       are clear.
       6.2.2.4. Advise “Live Fire” personnel to begin test.
       6.2.2.5. When notified of termination and AMOPS approval is received, broadcast the
       following on Ground Control frequencies and FM radios: “LIVE FIRE TERMINATED.
       TAXIWAYS (Bravo, Charlie, Kilo, Hotel, and Mike or Echo, Delta, and Golf)) OPEN.”
       6.2.2.6. Terminate ATIS advisory.
       6.2.2.7. Advise AMOPS.
   6.2.3. “Live Fire” may be delayed for taxiing or airborne aircraft, if necessary.
   6.2.4. “Live Fire” will be scheduled during periods of slow flying activity and/or during
   night quiet hours (2300L-0600L).
6.3. Military Air Evacuation/Civil Ambulatory Flights. Tower will provide a 10 mile
notification to AMOPS of all arriving military air evacuation and civil MEDEVAC flights
immediately after initial contact and will relay information requested by the pilot. AMOPS will
notify Fire Department, Transient Alert and other agencies as necessary.
6.4. Alert Missions.
   6.4.1. Strategic Airborne Command Post (USSTRATCOM ABNCP) Alert. See TAFB Plan
   11-4, Reflex Delta. This plan describes the support that will be provided to host and
   beddown the Airborne Command Post (ABNCP) aircraft. The plan will be implemented in
   the event of a weather divert, terrorist threat, or other conditions which may necessitate the
   relocation of aircraft.
   6.4.2. 507th Air Refueling Wing Alert.
       6.4.2.1. 507 ARW maintains a 24-hour day-to-day alert commitment with one aircraft
       and crew.
       6.4.2.2. 507 ARW Command Post is the central point of contact regarding ground
       movement and launch of mission aircraft.
       6.4.2.3. Circumstances could arise, exercise or real-world, where this commitment could
       increase significantly. 507 ARW Plans Office (507 ARW/XPO) coordinates with all
       affected base agencies when this occurs.
   6.4.3. 552d Air Control Wing Alert. CP is the central point of contact regarding ground
   movement and launch of mission aircraft.
 46                                                       TINKERAFBI13-201 19 JUNE 2013


6.5. Drag Chute Jettison/Recovery.
   6.5.1. Jettison. The following procedures apply:
      6.5.1.1. Low Wind/Dry Surface. Pilots will normally retain drag chutes to the parking
      area.
      6.5.1.2. High Wind/Dry Surface. Pilots will clear the runway and release chute
      downwind in a manner that will keep it off any taxiway or runway.
      6.5.1.3. Low or High Wind/Slick Surface. During inclement weather, pilots may elect to
      jettison the chute at any point during landing/taxi operations. After exercising this
      option, the pilot will immediately notify Tower so the chute can be recovered as quickly
      as possible. Tower and/or AMOPS may suspend operations in the area until the chute is
      recovered.
      6.5.1.4. B-52 pilots may elect to jettison chutes on the runway if wind speed is greater
      than 15 knots and the turn off places the wind direction at more than 90 degrees to the
      aircraft. The pilot should advise Tower in advance, if possible, to expedite chute
      recovery.
   6.5.2. If transient pilots are unable to retain chutes until reaching the parking area, Tower
   will:
      6.5.2.1. Attempt to locate the chute to ensure it is clear of aircraft movement area. If the
      chute is not clear of runways/taxiways or its’ position cannot be determined, Tower will
      suspend operations to the runway/taxiway until the chute is located or recovered.
      6.5.2.2. Approve taxi operations in the area of jettisoned chute, if pilot reports chute is in
      sight and will not create a safety hazard.
   6.5.3. Recovery. When notified by Tower of approximate position of a jettisoned chute,
   AMOPS will contact the appropriate agency and request recovery action.
      6.5.3.1. Transient Alert Function is responsible for recovery of all drag chutes jettisoned
      by transient aircraft.
      6.5.3.2. Services Section (76 AMXG/566 AMXS/MXDVAC) is responsible for recovery
      of drag chutes of 10 FLTS and 76 AMXG delivery aircraft.
6.6. Aircraft Theft/Hijack Prevention. Early detection of unauthorized acts is key to
preventing attempts to seize aircraft.
   6.6.1. Tower will:
      6.6.1.1. Prior to issuing taxi clearance, confirm request with a Flight Strip or through
      AMOPS.
      6.6.1.2. Withhold taxi clearance if authorization is not confirmed.
      6.6.1.3. Take action as directed in TAFB Plan 13-207, Aircraft Theft/Hijacking and
      FAAO JO 7610.4, Special Operations.
   6.6.2. Prior to requesting approval from Tower to taxi/tow aircraft for maintenance purposes,
   responsible agency/unit will advise AMOPS of the proposed operation. AMOPS will then
   coordinate taxi/tow operations with Tower. 76 AMXG Maintenance may move non-
TINKERAFBI13-201 19 JUNE 2013                                                                 47


   operational aircraft (no wings, no engines) within their ramp area without approval from
   Tower.
   6.6.3. Priority aircraft must pre-coordinate their movement through the Incident
   Commander.
6.7. Tower Evacuation/Continuity of Air Traffic Services.
   6.7.1. Notification. In the event Tower must evacuate, the WS/SC will ensure (time
   permitting), the PCAS is activated and all agencies advised: “TINKER TOWER IS
   EVACUATING DUE TO (reason).” If applicable, “TOWER PERSONNELWILL
   RELOCATE TO THE ALTERNATE CONTROL FACILITY.”
   6.7.2. Tower will be evacuated under the following circumstances:
      6.7.2.1. Tornado activity in the vicinity of Tinker AFB (approximately 5 miles) or wind
      speed of 50 knots and forecasted to increase to 60 knots (Tower structural wind limitation
      is 60 knots). For an immediate threatening weather situation, Tower personnel will
      evacuate and take shelter. Upon receiving the “all clear” signal, the WS/SC will direct the
      return to Tower or activate the Alternate Control Facility (ACF) as necessary IAW
      approved facility instructions.
      6.7.2.2. When any situation, in the opinion of the WS/SC, that threatens safety. An
      evacuation due to circumstances other than weather, Tower personnel will evacuate to the
      ACF IAW approved facility instructions.
   6.7.3. Continuity of Air Traffic Services. The ACF is located at the main fire department
   (Building 117). Due to limited capability at the ACF, the following restrictions and
   procedures will apply:
      6.7.3.1. Operations will be limited to full stop arrivals and departures only. Rwy 13/31
      will only be available for emergency arrivals when crosswind prohibit using Rwy 18/36.
      6.7.3.2. The ACF may not always be able to see the entire length of the active runway to
      ensure it is clear of vehicles, animals, etc. Under such circumstances, the ACF will

   6.13.3. After dumping fuel or jettisoning external stores, the pilot in command will provide a
   written report to Environmental Compliance Division (72 ABW/CE) within two working
   days. The report must cover the following items:
       6.13.3.1. Date and time of release.
       6.13.3.2. Location of release (if dumped fuel, specify ground track).
       6.13.3.3. Altitude at which release occurred.
       6.13.3.4. Type of release (i.e., fuel, fuel tank, ordnance, or other).
       6.13.3.5. If fuel was dumped, type and amount of fuel.
       6.13.3.6. Brief description of emergency requiring release.
6.14. Hot Tail Hook. The following procedures apply when aircraft land with an extended tail
hook:
   6.14.1. When Tower is notified a pilot will land with an extended tail hook, treat the aircraft
   as an emergency.
   6.14.2. Upon completion of landing roll, Tower will direct aircraft to the nearest HOT TAIL
   HOOK area (Attachment 4) or as directed by the Fire Department.
   6.14.3. Under normal operations, pilots will not attempt to taxi until the hook has been
   cooled and re-cocked.
6.15. Emergency Security Control of Air Traffic (ESCAT). Pilots will be familiar with the
contents of TAFB Plan 13-245, ESCAT – Emergency Security Control of Air Traffic.

      6.18.1.5. ARFF Minimal Protection (due equipment shortage) – knockdown available,
      no re-supply and limited rescue
      6.18.1.6. ARFF No Support – Fire Department cannot supply any incidents
   6.18.2. Procedures. The Fire Department will notify AMOPS when ARFF capability has
   changed. AMOPS will notify Command Post, Tower, 72 OSS/CC and all flying units of
   ARFF capability (explained in terminology).
      6.18.2.1. Base flying units will make their own determinations on operations as related to
      ARFF capability.
      6.18.2.2. At ARFF Degraded Protection, AMOPS will advise transient aircraft of the
      ARFF capability and allow the aircrews to make their own determination on operations.
      6.18.2.3. At ARFF Minimal Protection, a NOTAM will be sent limiting the airdrome to
      “Official Business Only.” AMOPS, in coordination with Tower, will attempt to divert all
      inbound aircraft, except DV Code 1 and 2, emergency aircraft, and MEDEVAC, and
      advise transient aircraft with engines running of the situation. Transient aircrews will
      make their own determination on operations.

Terms
Airdrome or Airfield—The area in which aircraft operations (takeoff, landing, taxiing, parking,
towing, or maintenance) may occur. Includes all areas within the airfield perimeter fence and is
designated a controlled area.
Airfield Driving InstructionProgram developed by AMOPS through TAFBI 13—202
Airfield Driving Instruction, for issuing AF Form 483, Certificate of Competency, endorsed for
airfield driving. The program is provided to designated unit Airfield Driving Instruction
managers.
Airfield Operations Flight (AOF)—Function that provides an overall safe and efficient
airdrome to support the military flying mission. (72 OSS/OSA)
 60                                                       TINKERAFBI13-201 19 JUNE 2013


ALC Maintenance Ramp—All ramp space east of RWY 18/36, excluding the TMF, is
considered ALC maintenance ramp.
AMOPS—A facility that provides flight plan processing and planning services, airfield
condition information, and ensures a safe airfield environment as directed by the AFM. (72
OSS/OSAM)
Around the Horn—Local term used when going between the multiple intersection at TWY C,
H, and K north of RWY 13/31. Ground controllers and aircrew are allowed to use this term
when issuing/reading back taxi instructions.
Controlled Movement Area (CMA)Areas of the airfield which require aircraft, vehicles,
and pedestrians to obtain specific Air Traffic Control approval for access. Continuous
two—way radio communications with Ground Control must be maintained in the CMA. The
CMA is comprised of the runway environment area outlined by runway hold short lines,
overruns, ILS glideslope, localizer critical areas and portion of runway clear zones.
Controlled Movement Area Violation (CMAV)—A CMAV is an airfield infraction caused by
aircraft, vehicles or pedestrians entering the CMA without appropriate control tower approval.
This definition includes runway intrusions and infractions caused by communications errors
Flightline (operational)—The area that includes runways, taxiways, aircraft parking ramps, and
associated maintenance/service areas where operational (engines running) aircraft may be
encountered.
Flightline (non—operational)—Areas of the airfield that include ramps and hangars where no
aircraft with running engines will be encountered.
Hazard Fragmentation Distance (HFD)—The expected fragmentation distance of an explosive
item. The distance in feet is expressed inside brackets ( ), for example, (09) indicates the HFD is
900 feet.
Lateral Obstacle Clearance Zone—Area from center of runway (1000’) or taxiway (200’) and
from edge of ramp/apron where vertical obstacles are not authorized unless they are waivered or
they are a permissible deviation.
Long Hotel—Area on Twy H between Rwy 13/31 and Twy B.
Mandatory Radio Monitor Area (MRMA)—The MRMA is the area inside the airfield
perimeter fence excluding ramp areas and the area designated as the CMA. Vehicles operating
in the MRMA shall be radio equipped capable to communicate with the Tower. Vehicle
operators shall monitor the Tower frequency at all times and respond immediately to control
tower instructions. Vehicle operators shall request a radio check with the Tower, AMOPS or
another vehicle prior to entering the MRMA to ensure their radio is operational.
Maximum Credible Event (MCE)—The amount of explosive expected to detonate
simultaneously.
OKC Approach Control—Oklahoma City Federal Aviation Administration Terminal Radar
Approach Control facility.
Ramp—All paved areas used for parking/taxiing within the airfield perimeter fence excluding
runways and taxiways.
TINKERAFBI13-201 19 JUNE 2013                                                                 61


Runway—The paved area primarily used for aircraft departures and landings. Tinker has two
runways: Rwy 18/36 and Rwy 13/31.
Runway Clear Zones—Each runway has a clear zone at both ends of the runway. A clear zone
is defined as the area 1,500’ either side of a 3,000’ extension of the runway centerline from the
threshold. Several roads are in the clear zone (i.e., Air Depot Boulevard, Munitions Road).
Runway Intrusion—A runway intrusion is a CMAV that is a result of an unauthorized entry or
erroneous occupation of a runway or other surface used for takeoff and landing of aircraft,
regardless of impact on aircraft safety. These incidents can be caused by aircraft, vehicles,
pedestrians or communication error.
Short Hotel—Area on Twy H between Twy B and G.
South Hotel—Area on Twy H Southwest of Rwy 13/31.
Taxiway—Paved area primarily used by aircraft for taxiing purposes, and also used by
authorized vehicles as roadways.
Tower—Facility that provides efficient air traffic control operations to ensure safe air and
ground aircraft operations. Throughout this instruction, “Tower” shall refer to the Tinker
Control Tower unless otherwise specified. (72 OSS/OSAT)
Tow Way—A tow way is an area of the ramp used primarily for aircraft towing operations.
Taxiing an aircraft on a tow way is permitted only with specific approval from AMOPS and
Tower.
VehicleAs used in this instruction a vehicle includes all federal, state, and local government
vehicles as well as all privately owned, contractor owned, and government leased vehicles.
Golf carts and similarly sized conveyances are vehicles. Excluded are aircraft, bi—
tricycles, mopeds and motorcycles.

Note 1: Centerline from Twy C (east side Rwy 18/36) to SW corner bldg 3102 is a “Through” taxi lane
requiring 50 ft wingtip clearance.
Note 2: Centerline from SW corner bldg 3102 between K-5 to taxi lane running north and south on west
side of L parking row is an “Interior” taxi lane requiring 30 ft clearance. When a B-52 is parked on K-5
facing north, no B-52 aircraft can be towed or taxied on this taxi lane between bldg 3102 and K-5.
E3/KC135 can be taxied/towed through this taxi lane. A white solid line marked on the south side of bldg
3102 indicates clearance line where no obstructions (equipment, vehicles, etc) can be placed.
Note 3: Centerline that runs from painted roadway at NE corner 3102 to taxi lane D on west side of L
parking row is an “Interior” taxi lane requiring 30 ft wingtip clearance. E3/KC135 aircraft may taxi/tow
through taxilane (except L-5 is tow only). B52s cannot be taxied and must be towed from L-5 through L-11.
E-3/KC135 may park on L-6 through L-9 facing Northeast for recovery operations only, conduct an idle
engine run/defuel (if needed), and then towed from the spot. Aircraft will not be parked northeast for
routine engine runs.
Note 4: Centerline that runs between L and M rows is an “Interior” taxi lane requiring 30 ft wingtip
clearance. This taxi lane can be used for E3/KC135 aircraft to taxi/tow. B52/KC10 must tow down this taxi
lane. EXCEPTION: This taxi lane is closed to all taxi/tows whenever PORTABLE BLAST SHIELDS are
placed behind an aircraft on L row. The closure will affect all parking spots north of the position of the blast
shields.
Note 5: Any aircraft parked on L2 will block access to the adjacent bldg 3001 hangar door. Any aircraft
parked on M5 will block access to the north bldg 2283 hangar door and north bldg 2280 hangar door. Any
aircraft parked on L10 and L11 will block access to the west bldg 2283 hangar door. The 76 AMXG is
responsible for deconflicting hangar blockages.
Note 6: Centerline between K9/K10/K11 and L12/L13 to taxi lane D is currently tow only except from K9.
B1 aircraft cannot taxi off K10/K11 until the taxi line is moved 7 ft to the east. The taxi line will then
become an Interior taxi lane for B1 aircraft (30 ft wingtip clearance) to taxi from K10/K11.
Note 7: Centerline that runs between bldgs 2283 and 2121 is tow way only with largest aircraft authorized
is B52 requiring 118 ft each side of centerline. A white solid line marked on each side of centerline at 118 ft
each side indicates clearance line where no obstacles (equipment, vehicles, etc) can be placed.
Note 8: Centerline that runs between bldg 2122 and north and east fences is tow way only with largest
aircraft authorized is E3 requiring 98 ft each side of centerline. A white solid line marked on each side of
centerline at 98 ft each side indicates clearance line where no obstacles (equipment, vehicles, etc.) can be
placed.
