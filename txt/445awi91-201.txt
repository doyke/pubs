This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 91-2, Safety Programs. It establishes pro-
cedures and assigns responsibilities for the 445th Airlift Wing (AW) Bird Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH)
Program. This instruction applies to all units assigned to the 445 AW.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This revision adds the assistance of the flight safety officer (FSO) (paragraph 1.); changes the individual
to notify during changes in bird watch conditions from supervisor of flying (SOF) to the flight safety
officer (FSO) (paragraph 2.1.3.); added the duties of the chief of safety (2.5.); clarifies when aircraft
inspections can be done (2.7.1.); added notification to the maintenance coordination function (MCF) of all
bird strike inspections (2.7.4.); added general procedures (paragraph 3., 3.1., 3.2.), advising of the roles
and requirements the safety office takes in bird strikes and unusual bird activity. A bar ( | ) indicates a revi-
sion from the previous edition.


1. Responsibilities: The 445 Airlift Wing Commander (445 AW/CC) is responsible for the implementa-
tion of this program. The chief of safety will monitor compliance with the procedures established in the
program with the aid and assistance of the flight safety officer (FSO). All 445 AW personnel will rely on
the WPAFB BASH Plan as the foundation for action under this plan.

2. Procedures: The general procedures for base wide communication and formal reporting of bird haz-
ards and bird strikes are found in WPAFB BASH Plan 91-212, Annexes R and S. The procedures to be
used within the 445 AW are as follows:
    2.1. Command Post: Upon receiving notification from base operations of any change in the bird
    watch condition, the command post will notify the following individuals:
2                                                                         445AWI91-201 10 JULY 2001


       2.1.1. Either the 445 Operations Group Commander (445 OG/CC), Vice Commander (445 OG/
       CV), or senior duty officer (SDO)
       2.1.2. Chief of safety
       2.1.3. Flight safety officer (FSO)
    2.2. The notified individual will determine if the current bird watch condition requires a change to
    current or planned flight operations. If a change is required, the command post will pass this change to
    the supervisor of flying (SOF) and/or the aircrews, as required. Normally, bird watch condition low,
    requires no changes. Bird watch condition moderate will only require increased vigilance by aircrews,
    while bird watch condition severe will require restrictions to local flying.
    2.3. The chief of safety or FSO will monitor the bird activity and assist the OG/CC, CV, or SDO in
    evaluating the bird hazard. The FSO will maintain close contact with the WPAFB BASH/safety per-
    sonnel.
    2.4. At the beginning of each shift, the SDO will contact base operations, obtain the current bird
    watch condition and post it in the SOF area of Bldg 4014. Ensure aircrew is notified of changes to the
    bird watch condition and any restrictions to flight operations.
    2.5. The chief of safety will:
       2.5.1. Manage the safety office
       2.5.2. Implement the 445 AW BASH Plan
       2.5.3. Be an active member of the WPAFB Bird Hazard Working Group
    2.6. Aircrew should be notified of the current bird watch condition from the SDO, Air Terminal Infor-
    mation Service (ATIS), or directly from the tower. Use good judgment to avoid or minimize the threat
    from bird hazards. Also, it is imperative that aircrew notifies the tower and/or other aircrew of any
    hazardous bird activity. Additionally, any bird strikes must immediately be reported to the safety
    office with an AMC Form 97, AMC In-Flight Emergency and Unusual Occurrence Worksheet or
    AF Form 853, Air Force Bird Strike Report.
    2.7. The 445 Logistics Group Commander (445 LG/CC) will ensure the following actions are accom-
    plished if aircraft maintenance personnel discover or are informed of a bird strike.
       2.7.1. Inspect all aircraft suspected of having a bird strike. These aircraft inspections may be after
       the mission or during the mission and either in the parking spot or on a taxiway.
       2.7.2. Save any and all found bird parts for determination of bird species.
       2.7.3. Determine the estimated cost to repair the damage (if any) and forward this information to
       the 445 Airlift Wing Safety Office (445 AW/SE) along with the aircraft tail number, time the bird
       strike was reported/discovered, and the location of the bird strike on the aircraft.
       2.7.4. Notify the maintenance coordination function (MCF) personnel of all findings of bird strike
       inspections.

3. General Procedures:
445AWI91-201 10 JULY 2001                                                                             3


  3.1. 445 AW/SE staff is required to be ever vigilant for any unsafe practice or occurrence, which
  might adversely affect flying safety. Sightings of unusual bird activity or conditions must be immedi-
  ately brought to the attention of the 445 OG/CC, FSO and SDO.
  3.2. The safety office will maintain a “BASH” book detailing the procedures for filing BASH reports.
  The office will keep bird description books for the recognition of bird species.
