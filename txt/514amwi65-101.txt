    2.1. Incentive Pay. The three types of MPO actions relating to incentive pay are Start, Stop and
    Report HDIP/ACIP/CEFIP. The following outlines what occurs when one of the above MPOs are pro-
    cessed. The required form is DD form 114, or the MPO section of an Aeronautical Order.
       2.1.1. Start HDIP/ACIP/CEFIP. When a member is put on flying status and meets the flight time
       requirements in accordance with the DODFMR, the 514 AMW/FMFP will start the incentive pay.
       The FMO will submit an MPO for payment of incentive pay retroactive to the date of the AO/
       MPO.
       2.1.2. Stop HDIP/ACIP/CEFIP. When a member is taken off of flying status 514 AMW/FMFP
       will stop incentive pay. The FMO will submit an MPO to collect incentive pay retroactive to the
       effective date of the AO/MPO.
       2.1.3. Report HDIP/ACIP/CEFIP. When a member meets flight time requirements in accordance
       with the DODFMR for a specific period of time, a “pay” MPO will be accomplished with action
       to pay incentive pay on active duty, inactive duty or both. When a member does not meet flight
       time requirements in accordance with the DODFMR for a specific period of time, a “collect”
       MPO will be accomplished with action to collect incentive pay on active duty, inactive duty or
       both.
    2.2. Tax Exclusion. An MPO is required to pay members for time spent in an approved Combat Zone
    Tax Exclusion area. Member will be reimbursed taxes paid for the month that the member entered the
    Area Of Responsibility. The required form is DD form 114.
    2.3. Hostile Fire Pay. An MPO is required to pay member’s Hostile Fire pay. A member is entitled to
    Hostile Fire pay for time spent in an approved Area of Responsibility. The form required is AF Form

    2.4. Aeronautical Orders. Upon receiving an Aeronautical Order with an MPO action requirement,
    complete the bottom portion of the AO and AF Form 1373, MPO Document Control Log – Trans-
    mittal. Send the AO and the AF Form 1373 to 514 AMW/FMFP. Ensure 305 OSS/OSTM, Host Avi-
