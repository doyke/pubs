                                         PURPOSE

1.1. General.
   1.1.1. The 480 ISR WG Command Language Program (CLP). The CLP is designed to
   increase the proficiency of Air Force Cryptologic Language Analysts (CLA) and to reduce
   the harmful effects of diminishing language skills while CLAs perform various language or
   non-language specific duties. The CLP will assist CLAs in maintaining highly perishable
   language skills.
   1.1.2. The CLP consists of both global and cryptologic language skill training. CLAs must
   meet performance levels established by the Career Field Education and Training Plan
   (CFETP) in order to upgrade and maintain skill levels. The Air Force’s minimum standard is
   for all CLAs to achieve Listening/2 and Reading/2 (L2/R2) levels as measured by the
   Defense Language Proficiency Test (DLPT) while working toward the professional standard
   of L3/R3. Global skills include such areas as reading, listening comprehension, translation,
   transcription, grammar, vocabulary, and speaking. Cryptologic skills training is mission-
   specific training that provides CLAs with technical knowledge about the language and/or
   activities associated with a particular mission. Cryptologic language training can include
   such things as certification training, transcription, National Cryptologic School (NCS)
   courses (adjunct faculty taught, in-residence or self-paced) or other technical training.
   1.1.3. All documentation pertaining to this instruction will be sent to the 480 ISR WG
   Command Language Program Manager (CLPM) organizational inbox at
   480IsrwgCLP2@langley.af.mil.
   1.1.4. The 480 ISR WG/CC may waive any portion of this instruction in writing. Units must
   submit waivers to any portion of this instruction in writing to the 480 ISR WG/DO through
   applicable channels.
