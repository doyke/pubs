SUMMARY OF CHANGES

The publication has been revised. This rewrite of 36 WGI 21-103 includes changed fax to email
address where digital copy can be sent to and the most current PACAF message.
1. General
     1.1. Oil samples will be delivered to the Nondestructive Inspection Laboratory in building
     17006 within 75 minutes of engine shutdown IAW AFI 21-101 CAF Sup. MXG/CC may
     adjust the 2 ½ hour rule as needed to accommodate flying windows. Customers delivering
     samples to the lab during non-duty hours will place samples in the “Sample Drop off”
     container with date and time of drop off annotated on the outside of the envelope. Upon
     delivery, notify the MOCC at 366-4322 or the 36 MXS Production Superintendent at 366-
     4621 or 366-4052.
     1.2. Commanders of organizations requiring oil analysis will appoint a primary and alternate
     JOAP monitor in writing (See Attachment 2). JOAP monitor appointment letters will be
     forwarded to the Nondestructive Inspection Laboratory by email at 36MXS/NDI@us.af.mil
     or dropped off to the Nondestructive Inspection Laboratory in building 17006. The
     appointment letter must be updated when changes occur and NDI will check quarterly to
     ensure letters are current.
     1.3. All engines, transmissions or gearboxes requiring oil-wetted maintenance or an oil
     change will be placed on surveillance, code C, in accordance with home station requirements.
     If an engine, transmission, or gearbox is not accompanied with cross country paperwork and
     the home station laboratory cannot be reached, then the item will be placed on code C for a
     minimum of 3 flights or 10 hours to establish the required trend analysis.
     1.4. Per ACC/A4QM message dated 3 December 2012, the quarterly JOAP meetings have
     been waived and will not be held.
2. JOAP Monitors
     2.1. Newly assigned JOAP monitors will report to the Nondestructive Inspection Laboratory
     within 30 days for an orientation on: basic workings of JOAP, proper procedures and monitor
     responsibilities.
     2.2. Will be the primary points of contact concerning paperwork discrepancies, laboratory
     requests and maintenance feedback for all oil analysis transactions.
     2.3. Will ensure drain and flush procedures are not performed simply to eliminate abnormal
     or high wear metal trends unless recommended by the Nondestructive Inspection Laboratory
     Technician.
3. Nondestructive Inspection Laboratory
     3.1. Will train all primary and alternate JOAP monitors on their responsibilities.
     3.2. Will ensure the delivery log is maintained and include: A/C tail number, time sample
     taken, time sample delivered, time customer notified of OAP code, and the name of the
     individual notified.
     3.3. Will immediately notify the owning organization of any suspect oil sample and request
     an immediate resample.
36WGI21-103 13 MAY 2014                                                                      3


   3.4. NCOIC will notify the Fabrication Flight Chief and MXS Supervision whenever a
   spectrometer is decertified or prior to reporting a Spectrometer as “Reported Maintenance
   Status” to the JOAP Technical Support Center at Pensacola Naval Air Station in Florida.
4. OAP Requirements for Deployment/Redeployments
   4.1. When aircraft deploy from Andersen AFB, the owning organization is responsible for
   obtaining and ensuring JOAP data stays with the aircraft while deployed. Upon
   redeployment to Andersen AFB, the owning organization is responsible to ensure all JOAP
   data is immediately returned to the NDI laboratory so the JOAP computer system can be
   updated to ensure aircraft are coded correctly and not placed in a surveillance status.
   4.2. Units deploying on a weekend will request and pick up JOAP records from the
   Nondestructive Inspection Laboratory in Bldg. 17006 no later than close of business on the
   last duty day prior to departure. Units must notify the Nondestructive Inspection Laboratory
   at 366-2292, two hours in advance to prepare the aircraft documents.
