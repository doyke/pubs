SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This interim change replaces Attachment 2, Table A2.1. to update the table of allowances of
authorized UWC for salaried office employees and adds UWC items for mess hall employees of
the 435 CTS. A margin bar indicates newly revised material.


1. Basic Requirement. UWC for non-US citizen employees with USAFE in Germany will be
standardized so that like groups will be distinctive and recognizable. When wearing UWC is
required, pertinent items and insignia will be furnished to employees on a nonreimbursable basis.
2                                                       USAFEI36-729 16 FEBRUARY 2009


2. Non-US Citizen Employees Required To Wear UWC.
    2.1. Non-US Citizens employed under the conditions of Appendix Z of the Collective Tariff
    Agreement (CTA II) with a USAFE Civilian Service Unit (CSU) are required to wear UWC
    in accordance with this instruction. This applies particularly to employees with USAFE
    Security Forces (SF) in Germany and to employees with the 86th Construction and Training
    Squadron (hereinafter referred to as CTS). Local Fire Chiefs will prescribe UWC for Local
    National (LN) personnel employed with a USAFE Fire Department in Germany under the
    provisions of App. P, CTA II. Wear of UWC for other occupational categories may be
    approved in accordance with the conditions set forth in paragraph 6.
    2.2. Employees are not required to wear UWC unless the nature of their work makes a clear
    identification important and wearing UWC will accomplish that objective.
3. Responsibilities.
    3.1. Headquarters (HQ) USAFE. Establishes basic standards for furnishing UWC and
    identifies those groups of USAFE employees who are required to wear UWC. It prescribes
    or approves UWC items and corresponding issue allowances and coordinates with other
    Department of Defense components to ensure that these requirements and conditions are
    consistent.
    3.2. Organizational Commanders. Ensure that UWC is furnished to all employees who
    are required to wear it and ensure compliance with this instruction and its attachments.
    3.3. Unit Supervisors.
       3.3.1. Identify positions under their supervision that require wearing of UWC and inform
       employees on those positions of the conditions and requirements for wearing,
       maintaining, and returning items issued.
       3.3.2. Determine from Attachment 2 the initial issues authorized for the positions,
       unless adjusted under authority of paragraph 5. below.
       3.3.3. Designate a supply official responsible for maintaining stocks at the unit’s supply
       section. The supply official will obtain authorized UWC items, maintain general records
       of initial issue and replacements, and control turn-in of items for proper disposal.
       3.3.4. Ensure adequate funding for procurement of issue items, respectively the coverage
       of obligations with the Army and Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES) Military
       Clothing Sales Store (ACSS), local Individual Equipment Units (IEU), or commercial
       local procurement (LP) sources.
       3.3.5. Prepare and coordinate documentation for acquisition of UWC items from the
       above sources. Authority for procurement will derive from either this instruction or a
       specific USAFE approval for exceptions obtained under paragraph 6. below.
       3.3.6. Ensure subordinate employees wear their UWC in accordance with this instruction
       and uniform appearance of groups of employees working together is maintained, even if
       exceptions are ordered due to operational requirements or severe working conditions.
    3.4. Civilian Personnel Officers or Designated Representatives. Inform operating
    officials of the provisions of this instruction and its attachments. Inform eligible job
    candidates of UWC provisions when wearing UWC is a condition of employment.
USAFEI36-729 16 FEBRUARY 2009                                                                 3


   3.5. Unit Supply Officials. Manage bulk procurement and distribution of prescribed UWC
   items. They determine and maintain adequate and sufficient stock levels and administer the
   necessary supply documents, and establish adequate controls to ensure economical use of
   available supplies. They obtain receipt certifications from employees issued UWC items and
   establish adequate controls for exchanging items that have become unserviceable, or turn-in
   of items, regardless of condition, upon separation of employees, and are responsible for
   maintaining records of issues.
4. Issue Allowances. All items of clothing and equipment issued under this instruction will be
considered organizational property.
   4.1. Initial Allowance. The initial allowance is furnished cost-free to employees upon their
   first assignment to positions requiring wearing of UWC.
   4.2. Replacement Allowance. The cost-free replacement allowance covers normal wear and
   is controlled by the supply official of the activity. Employees who wantonly abuse or destroy
   UWC items will be held financially liable.
   4.3. Special Equipment Allowances. Initial and replacement issue allowances for protective/
   occupational clothing and related equipment will be furnished to employees in accordance
   with (IAW) Air Force equipping guides. This includes items such as flight jackets, parkas,
   rubber boots, etc., that are deemed necessary for satisfactory work performance and
   employee safety.
5. Establishment and Adjustment of Allowances.
   5.1. Allowances prescribed in Attachment 2 are the maximum allowances and may be
   decreased or omitted at the discretion of the local commander. Commanders determine the
   amount of UWC issue allowances provided to temporary employees by adjusting maximum
   allowances for any reduced requirements that result from the limited period and nature of the
   employment. Allowances for temporary employees will be held to a minimum.
   5.2. An employee who is transferred to another position requiring UWC may only be issued
   those items not previously furnished under the initial allowance authority. UWC items or
   allowances in excess of those authorized for the position to which transferred will be turned
   in to the losing activity prior to the date of transfer. Employees whose employment ends or
   who are transferred to positions that do not require wear of UWC must return all items except
   underwear and shoes regardless of condition.
6. Processing Special UWC Requests.
   6.1. Requests for exceptions to UWC standards outlined in Attachment 2 to this instruction,
   will be directed through the chain of command to the Chief, Civilian Policy (HQ
   USAFE/A1KC), for review, coordination, and determination.
   6.2. Requests to make wear of UWC mandatory for groups of employees other than those
   listed in paragraph 2.1 will be directed to HQ USAFE/A1KC for determination. Requests
   must contain the following information:
       6.2.1. The identity of the occupational group of employees affected.
       6.2.2. The conditions that make UWC necessary.
       6.2.3. The specific UWC requirements and allowances proposed.
4                                                        USAFEI36-729 16 FEBRUARY 2009


       6.2.4. Proposed procurement sources for UWC items.
       6.2.5. Proposed design of distinctive markings or insignias to be worn for proper
       identification purpose.
    6.3. Likewise, commanders may request the rescission of the UWC wear requirement for
    certain groups of employees. Requests have to include all relevant details and full
    justification for the proposed action.
7. UWC Composition and Insignia.
    7.1. General.
       7.1.1. UWC Standards. The organizational commander will prescribe the standard
       UWC composition for each occupational group wearing UWC under the provisions of
       this instruction.
       7.1.2. Identification Insignia. To distinguish UWC from military uniforms, distinctive
       markings and insignia will be worn on all outer garments such as headgear, jackets, coats,
       and shirts. Supervisory insignia or badges may be worn if prescribed by local
       commanders. With the exception of functional insignia that are required for mission
       accomplishment, like the Security Police badge, these insignia and badges will not
       duplicate or resemble those worn by military personnel.
       7.1.3. Civilian Service Unit (CSU) Shoulder Patch. The patch consists of a shield
       bearing a black-red-gold diagonal stripe pattern centered before two gold-colored wings
       on each side on a dark blue, shield-shaped cloth patch. The patch will be worn centered
       12 mm from the top seam of the left sleeve of outer garments.
       7.1.4. CSU Identification Tapes. For identification purposes, CTS employees will wear
       a tape reading “Civilian Service”; SF employees will wear a tape with the words
       “Security Police.” The tape will be worn centered 12 mm above the edge of the left
       breast pocket of outer garments. For garments without outer left breast pockets, it will be
       placed in the same relative position.
       7.1.5. Grade and Supervisory Insignia. Organizational commanders may prescribe the
       wear of grade insignia. If grade insignia are not desired, but some form of identification
       of the employee’s job category or supervisory function is deemed necessary,
       commercially procured tapes or labels showing the employee’s job title or supervisory
       function, for example, “Fire Fighter,” “Policeman,” “Foreman,” “Crew Chief,” ”Unit
       Supervisor,” or suchlike may be worn. If the wear of grade insignia is prescribed, they
       will be worn as indicated in paragraph 7.4
       7.1.6. Name Tags. If organizational commanders prescribe wearing of name plates or
       name tapes, they will be procured commercially.
       7.1.7. Decorations. Pins, badges, insignia or medals, other than those approved for wear
       by non-US civilian employees of the Air Force will not be worn with the uniform.
    7.2. UWC for CTS Personnel.
       7.2.1. CTS employees will be issued UWC as outlined in Table A2.1 of Attachment 2
       to this instruction.
USAFEI36-729 16 FEBRUARY 2009                                                                  5


      7.2.2. CTS Shoulder Patch. On the background of a blue disc is a red isosceles triangle
      with a yellow castle silhouette at its center and with yellow wings attached to the sides.
      At the upper tip of the triangle is an upward-pointed sword with a yellow hilt and a silver
      blade surrounded by red flames. The CTS shoulder patch will be worn centered 12 mm
      below the top seam of outer garments’ right sleeves.
   7.3. UWC for Security Forces Personnel.
      7.3.1. UWC allowances for LN employees with Security Forces units in Germany are
      outlined in Table 2.2 of Attachment 2 to this instruction.
      7.3.2. Security Forces Shoulder Patch. All LN SF personnel will wear a distinctive
      shoulder patch on the right sleeve of their outer garments. This patch depicts the upper
      part of a halberd, with yellow blades and metal parts and a black shaft on a lozenge
      shaped red background with black bordering. On the Battle Dress Uniform (BDU) or the
      Airman Battle Uniform (ABU) subdued Security Forces and CSU shoulder patches
      matching the respective color pattern will be worn.
      7.3.3. To distinguish them from US Military Security Forces, LN SF Personnel will wear
      the royal blue beret as the regular duty cover. Temporary exceptions, like wear of a
      watch cap for mission-related reasons may be authorized by local commanders.
   7.4. Grade Insignia for Security Forces Personnel.
      7.4.1. SF employees in pay grades ZB-1/ZP-1 through ZB-6/ZP-5 will wear diagonally
      arranged light blue cloth stripes on all outer garments. The cloth stripes are worn
      approximately 50 mm below the tip of the left shoulder patch. The number of stripes will
      correspond to the assigned pay grade as follows:

Table 7.1. Grade Insignia for Pay Grades 1 through 6.

  ZB-1             ZP-1                one stripe

    ZB-11                           one silver shield bordered in gold serration

    7.5. UWC for Fire Fighter Personnel.
          7.5.1. Local Fire Department Chiefs determine if and which type of UWC or grade
          insignia they issue to their LN civilian personnel. Basic requirement is, however, that
          UWC items and grade insignia meet the applicable safety standards (in accordance with
          National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), respectively Deutsche Industrienorm /
          European Norm (DIN/EN) standards).
          7.5.2. If LN Fire Fighters wear grade insignia or locally procured tapes or badges to
          indicate their grade / function the following insignia will be worn to indicate the pertinent
          tariff grade:

Table 7.3. Grade Insignia for Fire Fighter Personnel.

    P-1 & P-2                       silver fire department scramble

    P-3                             one silver bugle

    P-4                             two parallel silver bugles

    P-5                             two crossed silver bugles

    P-6                             two parallel gold bugles

    P-7                             two crossed gold bugles

    C-8                             four crossed gold bugles inside a gold wreath

    7.6. Items not Considered UWC.
          7.6.1. Work clothing such as coveralls worn by painters, mechanics, freight loaders, or
          laborers, special protective clothing worn by firefighters, or safety clothing such as
          asbestos gloves, are not considered part of UWC. The same applies to tactical equipment
          like holsters, pouches, and suchlike worn by Security Forces personnel.
          7.6.2. Physical Training (PT) Uniforms. Since PT is not a primary work function of the
          occupational groups covered by this instruction such items are not considered UWC.
          Local commanders wishing to issue PT gear to LN employees have to ensure that these
USAFEI36-729 16 FEBRUARY 2009                                                                  7


       are clearly distinguishable from active duty Air Force personnel. Therefore, the Air
       Force PT uniform will not be issued to LN employees.
8. Wear of UWC.
   8.1. When UWC is Worn. Employees wear UWC while on official duty. They may wear
   it while traveling to and from official duty stations, unless precluded by local instructions.
   When in an off-duty status, however, the wear of removable insignia that indicate a certain
   function or authority, like police badges or brassards, is prohibited.
   8.2. General Appearance. Employees must keep all UWC items clean and neat and obtain
   replacement items when initial issue items are no longer serviceable.
   8.3. Personal Grooming. Military personal grooming standards are not directly applicable
   to civilian employees wearing UWC. For this reason, supervisors must avoid demanding
   compliance with such standards or taking disciplinary measures in cases of non-compliance.
   Instead, supervisors should encourage employees, through use of sound management and
   counseling techniques, to support a compatible personal grooming standard. Supervisors are
   to ensure that the personal grooming of individual employees, in particular long hair or
   beards, does not present a safety hazard.
   8.4. Laundry and Dry-Cleaning Service.
       8.4.1. All items of clothing issued under this instruction, except stockings, socks, and
       underwear will be processed without reimbursement as organizational property.
       8.4.2. Items of non-issue clothing will be processed on a reimbursable basis at rates
       charged to enlisted military personnel.
9. Changes in UWC Items. When UWC items or specifications are revised by this instruction,
affected employees may continue to wear the previously prescribed items as long as they remain
serviceable unless the local commander specifically directs these employees to change over to
the new UWC standard by a certain date.
