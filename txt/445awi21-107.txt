SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This revision has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed.
1. General.
   1.1. The CDDAR program is designed to recover crashed, damaged or disabled aircraft in a
   minimum time. Requirements will consist of opening runways for operational use,
   prevention of secondary damage to the aircraft, and preservation of evidence for mishap or
   accident investigation.
2                                                             445AWI21-107 17 AUGUST 2009


    1.2. The CDDAR program instruction is a procedural guide and will not take precedence
    over aircraft specific technical data in the recovery of crashed, damaged or disabled aircraft.
2. CDDAR Responsibilities.
    2.1. The 445 AW will provide crash recovery support for assigned aircraft and will support
    88 Mission Support Group/Logistic Readiness Squadron (MSG/LRS) CDDAR program IAW
    WRIGHT-PATTERSON AIR FORCE BASE INSTRUCTION 21-101, CDDAR. CDDAR
    procedures will be coordinated with the Fire Department, Safety, Civilian Engineers,
    Readiness, Explosive Ordnance Disposal, Bioenvironmental, Airfield Manager, and on/off
    base agencies as needed IAW AFMAN 32-4004, Emergency Response Operations. The 445
    AW will support aircraft Safety Investigation Boards (SIB) IAW WRIGHT-PATTERSON
    AIR FORCE BASE Plan 91-204, Aircraft Mishap Investigation, to include providing space
    in hangars as available for preservation of accident debris and providing
    Operations/Maintenance advisors to the CDDAR On-Scene Commander (OSC) when Air
    Force Reserve Command (AFRC) resources are involved. When 445 AW personnel or assets
    are involved, the 445 AW will provide a minimum of two members to the interim SIB.
    2.2. 445th Maintenance Group (MXG) Quality Assurance (MGQ) will ensure all aircraft AIR
    FORCE TECHNICAL ORDER (AFTO) Form 781, ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data
    Document; documentation/historical records, servicing equipment, personnel training
    records, and Maintenance Information System (MIS or GO81) utilizing the 9012 screen
    (Lock/Unlock Aircraft Database) and all E-tools are impounded upon notification of an
    accident/mishap. MGQ will serve as the central point of coordination between the CDDAR
    Team Chief and the SIB regarding assigned aircraft.
    2.3. The 445th Maintenance Squadron (MXS) Aerospace Repair Supervisor (MXMTA) will
    serve as the CDDAR Team Chief and the 445 MXS Lead and Subject Matter Expert for
    assigned aircraft. In the event the Team Chief is unavailable the 445 MXS Maintenance
    Flight Chief (MXMT) will assume this responsibility. The team composition (see
    Attachment 2) will respond to the site at the direction of the 445 MXS CDDAR Team Chief.
    Responsibilities will include providing technical expertise, technical data, Mission Design
    Series (MDS) unique tools/special equipment, and airframe/system familiarization, as
    required. The 445 MXS CDDAR Team Chief will maintain a current list of team members
    and their special qualifications for vehicles, aircraft special certifications, and a list of
    support equipment and tools by location. Additionally, a listing of 445 MXG personnel
    qualified to operate buses, tractor trailers, forklifts; etc will be maintained by the CDDAR
    Team Chief. These lists will be maintained in the 445 MXS CDDAR Team Chief’s CDDAR
    binder located in the 445 MXS Aerospace Repair Shop.
    2.4. The 445 MXS Aerospace Repair CDDAR Team Chief will develop an emergency
    recall/mobilization roster identifying recovery team members for contact during non-duty
    hours. A copy of the recall/mobilization roster will be on file in the 445 Maintenance
    Operations Center (MOC) to be utilized in the event an accident/mishap would occur during
    non-duty hours.
    2.5. Training will be accomplished by attending a certified CDDAR course for primary team
    members, certificate of completion will be filed with 445 MXS CDDAR Team Chief.
    Primary team members will be qualified in basic crash/damaged aircraft recovery operations.
    Augmentee members of various specialties will be given familiarization training of CDDAR
445AWI21-107 17 AUGUST 2009                                                                    3


   equipment by 445 CDDAR primary team members. Augmentee’s will always be under direct
   supervision of a primary member during recovery operation. This training will include
   indoctrination as to the necessity and importance of preserving all components of the
   wreckage whenever possible IAW AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports. All
   training will be documented using AF IMT 797, Job Qualification Standard
   Continuation/Command JQS, and GO81 course ACFT 000100, Crash Recovery Procedures,
   IAW AFI 21-101, Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance Management and AFI 36-2201, V3,
   Air Force Training Program On The Job Training Administration.
   2.6. The 445 MXS Aerospace Repair CDDAR Team Chief will be responsible for reviewing
   and providing inputs to support agreements and base disaster response plans annually.
   2.7. 445 MXS CDDAR Team Chief will coordinate with the MGQ weight and balance
   manager when weight and balance/center of gravity conditions for the subject aircraft are
   unknown.
3. Procedures.
   3.1. The 445 AW Command Post (445 AW/CP) or Supervisor of Flying (SOF) will be
   notified via the base crash net of aircraft accidents/mishaps. All accident/mishap procedures
   will be IAW WPAFB CEM Plan 10-2, Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan, and
   WPAFB OPERATION PLAN 91-204, Aircraft Mishap Investigation Plan. A request or
   notification for 445th Airlift Wing assistance will come to the 445 AW/CP from the 88
   MSG/LGR or the CDDAR On Scene Commander for aircraft accident/mishaps. The 445
   AW/CP will inquire as to the assistance required (e.g., flare safety, landing gear safety,
   technical assistance, or other requested items and the response reporting location and area
   specific requirements). The 445 AW/CP will immediately notify the 445 MOC of the aircraft
   incident/accident and provide information/guidance of any requests or notification for
   assistance from the 445 MXS CDDAR Team.
   3.2. Upon notification of an aircraft accident/mishap, the 445 MOC will immediately notify
   the 445 MXS CDDAR Team Chief and inform the 445th Maintenance Group Commander
   (MXG/CC), 445th Aircraft Maintenance Squadron Commander (AMXS/CC), 445th
   Maintenance Squadron Commander (MXS/CC), 445 Maintenance Operations Squadron
   Commander (MOS/CC), and their Superintendents, the Quality Assurance office and the 445
   AMXS Production Superintendent. The 445 MOC will initiate local check sheets 3-1
   (Aircraft Accident/Mishap) and 3-14 (Crash Recovery). All radio nets will be notified of the
   aircraft accident/mishap. Aircraft identification, personnel involved and possible reasons for
   accident/mishap will not be discussed utilizing radio nets. The 445 MOC and the 445 MXS
   CDDAR Team will utilize “C” net during these responses to reduce radio traffic.
   3.3. When notified by 445 MOC, the 445 MXS CDDAR Team Chief will begin the
   notification process to assemble the 445 MXS CDDAR Team members. During normal duty
   hours all personnel will respond immediately to Hangar 4015, 445 MXS Aerospace Repair
   Shop. During non-duty hours all CDDAR team members will respond within one-hour of
   notification. The 445 MXS CDDAR Team Chief may request additional support of other 445
   MXG maintenance personnel for other than actual aircraft recovery by contacting the 445
   MOC.

    Command (AFMC) or Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC).
    4.3. The 88 MSG/LRS will establish Contingency Contracts for local purchase of additional
    dunnage/shoring and any heavy equipment not readily available at the WPAFB 88 Civil
    Engineering Squadron such as cranes, bulldozers, backhoes, or front end loader tractors IAW
    WPAFBI 21-101, CDDAR.
    4.4. Available equipment lists of both the 88 ABW and the 445 AW will be maintained in
    the 445 MXS CDDAR Team Chief’s binder at the 445 MXS Aerospace Repair Office.
    4.5. The 445 MXG may work to establish support agreements with other nearby Air Force
    bases for mutual support of CDDAR equipment.
5. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).
    5.1. Personal protective equipment will be utilized as determined by the CDDAR OSC and
    the on-scene Bioenvironmental Engineering representative. All additional PPE concerns and
    training will be addressed and accomplished prior to beginning recovery operation as
