                                         Chapter 1

                                GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. General. This volume provides flight examiners and aircrews with procedures and
evaluation criteria/tolerances to be used during both flight and ground phases of initial and
periodic evaluations. All HC-130P/N and MC-130P (Rescue units only) evaluations will be
conducted according to this volume and AFI 11-202V2, Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation
Program, as supplemented. Specific areas for evaluation are prescribed to ensure an accurate
assessment of the proficiency and capabilities of aircrews. Flight examiners use this AFI when
conducting aircrew evaluations. Instructors use this AFI when preparing aircrews for
qualification.
1.2. Applicability. This volume is applicable to all individuals performing crew duties on HC-
130P/N and MC-130P (Rescue units) and assigned Back-up Aircraft Inventory (BAI) aircraft.
1.3. Key Words and Definitions.
   1.3.1. "Will" and "Shall" indicate a mandatory requirement.
   1.3.2. "Should" is normally used to indicate a preferred, but not mandatory, method of
   accomplishment.
   1.3.3. "May" indicates an acceptable or suggested means of accomplishment.
   1.3.4. "Note" indicates operating procedures, techniques, etc., considered essential to
   emphasize.
   1.3.5. DELETED.
1.4. Waivers. Waiver authority for the contents of this document is MAJCOM DO/XO.
Forward waiver requests thru MAJCOM Stan/Eval channels.
1.5. Recommended Changes. Submit recommendations for changes to this volume on AF IMT
847, Recommendation for Change of Publication, IAW AFI 11-202 Vol 2 Attachment 5.
1.6. Procedures.
   1.6.1. Flight examiners will use the criteria contained in this volume for conducting all
   flight, simulator, and emergency procedures evaluations. To ensure standard and objective
   evaluations, flight examiners will be thoroughly familiar with the prescribed evaluation
   criteria.
   1.6.2. Unless specified, the examinee or flight examiner may fly in any seat that will best
   enable the examiner to conduct a thorough evaluation.
   1.6.3. Before the Aircraft Commander Briefing, the evaluator will inform the aircraft
   commander of any special requirements. Flight examiners will brief the examinee on the
   conduct, purpose, and requirements of the evaluation, as well as all applicable evaluation
   criteria, prior to flight. The examinee will accomplish all required mission planning. If an
   Operations Planning Team (OPT) or Deployment Planning Team (DPT) accomplishes
   mission planning, the examinee is ultimately responsible for the accuracy and completeness
 6                                                       AFI11-2HC-130V2 1 JANUARY 2005


     of all mission-planning paperwork. Flight examiners will be furnished a copy of necessary
     charts, flight logs, mission folders, and any additional items they deem necessary.
     1.6.4. Flight examiners will not intentionally fail any equipment during flight evaluations,
     but may deny the use of systems not affecting safety of flight.
     1.6.5. Under no circumstances will a pilot or flight engineer flight examiner allow the
     aircraft to slow to below one engine inoperative air minimum control speed (Vmca),
     regardless of airspeed tolerances listed for specific areas.
     1.6.6. Flight examiners will thoroughly debrief/critique all aspects of the flight. During the
     critique, the flight examiner will review the examinee’s overall rating, specific deviations,
     area/sub area grades assigned, and any additional training required.
     1.6.7. When grading criteria specify that airspeed will be evaluated and the flight manual
     lists only minimum/maximum/recommended airspeed for that area, the examinee will brief
     the desired airspeed, if applicable.
1.7. Grading Instructions.
     1.7.1. The grading system for most areas in this volume is a three-level system (Q/Q-/U).
     Areas identified as "Critical" in Table 2.1 through Table 2.7 have a two-level system (Q/U).
     A critical area is defined as an area or event in which unsatisfactory performance by the
     examinee could result in loss of life or damage to equipment. If the examinee receives a U in
     any critical area, assign an overall Qualification Level 3 (Q-3).
     1.7.2. Required areas are indicated with an "R" in Table 2.1 through 2.7 for specific
     evaluations. All required areas must be evaluated. Refer to crewmember specific chapter for
     additional guidance. Flight examiners may evaluate any other areas observed, at their
     discretion.
        1.7.2.1. When it is impossible to evaluate a required area in the aircraft due to equipment
        malfunctions, operational requirements, scheduling restrictions, or weather, that area may
        be evaluated by an alternate method (simulator, procedural trainer, or verbal
        examination) unless otherwise noted. If, in the flight examiner’s judgment, a required
        item cannot be adequately evaluated by an alternate method, complete the evaluation on
        an additional flight. If a required item is not accomplished, the evaluator will place a
        comment in the Additional Comments portion of the AF IMT 8, Certificate of Aircrew
        Qualification.
     1.7.3. The flight examiner will compare the examinee’s performance for each area with the
     standards provided in this volume and assign an appropriate grade for the area. Derive the
     overall flight evaluation grade from the area grades based on a composite for the observed
     events and tasks IAW AFI 11-202V2 and this volume.
        1.7.3.1. To the maximum extent possible, flight examiners will use the grading criteria in
        this volume to determine individual area grades. Exercise judgment when the wording of
        areas is subjective and when specific areas are not covered.
        1.7.3.2. Flight examiner judgment will be the determining factor in arriving at the overall
        grade.
AFI11-2HC-130V2 1 JANUARY 2005                                                                  7


      1.7.3.3. Base tolerances for in-flight parameters on conditions of smooth air and a stable
      aircraft. Do not consider momentary deviations from tolerances, provided the examinee
      apply prompt corrective action and such deviations do not jeopardize flying safety.
      Consider cumulative deviations when determining the overall grade.
1.8. Additional Training.
   1.8.1. Flight examiners are responsible for assigning additional training, at their discretion.
   Document additional training and completion IAW AFI 11-202V2, as supplemented. Any
   approved training device or medium may be used for additional training.
   1.8.2. Additional training may be accomplished on the same flight as the evaluation, when
   unique situations present valuable training opportunities (i.e., crosswind landings). However,
   this option requires flight examiner discretion and judicious application. The examinee must
   be informed when the additional training begins and ends.
1.9. Unsatisfactory Performance.
   1.9.1. Dependent upon the item requiring the recheck, rechecks may be accomplished on the
   ground or in flight, at the discretion of the flight examiner. Rechecks will normally be
   administered by a flight examiner other than the one who administered the original
   evaluation.
   1.9.2. If the flight examiner observes an aircrew counterpart jeopardizing safe flight, the
   examiner will assume the duties of that aircrew member (provided the examiner’s flight duty
   period [FDP] does not exceed AFI 11-202 Vol 3, Table 9.1 maximum FDP for an un-
   augmented crew). This does not mean the examiner must assume the examinee’s position any
   time unsatisfactory performance is observed. If the examiner feels the examinee can continue
   safely with supervision, the examiner is not required to assume the examinee’s duties.
   However, if the flight examiner assumes the examinee’s duties, assign a Qualification Level
   3 (Q-3) as the overall grade.
   1.9.3. Evaluators     must   report    deviations/discrepancies   from   established
   procedures/directives in any area, regardless of the individual’s crew specialty, to
   squadron/group commander for evaluation and necessary action in accordance with
   MAJCOM supplement to AFI 11-202V2.
1.10. Emergency Procedures Evaluation (EPE). Conduct EPEs for all requisite flight
evaluations. The EPE will include areas commensurate with the examinee’s qualification and
experience level.
   1.10.1. Flight examiners may conduct EPEs verbally, inflight, in a simulator, or by another
   method determined by the examiner or unit stan/eval. Flight examiners determine EPE
   content and individual EPE areas. OGVs should develop EPE guides for each crew position
   flight examiner use. All crew positions with BOLDFACE procedures will accurately
   recite/write the applicable BOLDFACE procedures.
      1.10.1.1. EPEs should be scenario driven, and tailored to the specific crew position.
      Emphasize emergency procedures and systems knowledge, related to the situation. For
      mission evaluations, evaluate mission-specific equipment and situations.
      1.10.1.2. Examinees may use publications that are normally available in-flight. The
      examinee must recite all BOLDFACE items from memory and should provide the initial
 8                                                        AFI11-2HC-130V2 1 JANUARY 2005


        steps of emergency procedures that, in the opinion of the examiner, would not allow time
        for reference.
     1.10.2. EPEs will include sufficient inflight and ground emergencies to evaluate the
     examinee’s knowledge of systems and procedures to the flight examiner’s satisfaction.
     1.10.3. Tailor mission evaluation scenarios to unit tasking and include areas not normally
     evaluated in flight, such as defensive systems operation (if applicable), threat interpretation,
     and evasive action (pilot/navigator mission evaluations only).
     1.10.4. The following grading criteria will be used to grade individual items on EPEs for all
     crew positions (Exception--for BOLDFACE use grading criteria in Area 18).
        1.10.4.1. Q-1. Satisfactory systems/procedural knowledge. Operated within prescribed

        1.10.4.3. Q-3. Unsatisfactory systems/procedural knowledge. Unable to analyze problem
        or take corrective action. Failed to accomplish required checklists and/or unable to locate
        information in available aids. Major omissions or deviations in describing the location,
        use and limitations of emergency equipment.
1.11. Special Qualifications. Special qualification evaluations are administered for event
qualifications that are not universal to all crew positions in the airframe, to all members in that
crew position, or to all units. Special qualification evaluations may be conducted separately or in
conjunction with the qualification/mission evaluation. After initial qualification, special mission
events will be incorporate into subsequent periodic qualification and/or mission evaluations IAW
Table 2.3 thru Table 2.7 and the applicable crew chapters of this instruction. There are no
requisites for special qualification evaluations.
     1.11.1. Refer to the appropriate crew position chapters of this instruction for any special
     qualifications evaluation requirements.
     1.11.2. Special qualification evaluations will be annotated as a ―SPOT‖ evaluation in a
     separate Flight Phase block of the AF Form 8. Further define the specific evaluation in the
     Mission Description section of the Comments block on the AF Form 8.
1.12. Instructor Certified Events. These are events that require certification of training by an
instructor or flight examiner, not an evaluation as described in paragraph 1.11. Document
certification per MAJCOM supplement to AFI 11-202, Volumes 1 and 2. Refer to AFI 11-2HC-
130, Volume 1, HC-130 Aircrew Training, for a listing of instructor certified events.
1.13. Examinations. All crew members will complete open and closed book examinations as a
requisite to periodic evaluations. Navigators, flight engineers, airborne communication
specialists, and loadmasters will complete combined QUAL/MSN examinations. Pilots must

complete separate open and closed book examinations as a requisite to periodic QUAL and MSN
evaluations. Conduct requisite examinations IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 2, as supplemented.
   1.13.1. (Added) Examination Requirements. Except for the instrument examination, open
   and closed book examinations will contain a minimum of 40 test questions.
   1.13.2. (Added) Examination requirements for formal school initial, requalification and
   upgrade courses will be IAW approved syllabi of instruction.

                              EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS

2.1. General.
   2.1.1. All evaluations will follow the guidelines set in AFI 11-202V2, as supplemented, and
   this volume. Table 2.1 through Table 2.7 depict specific grading areas for all crew positions
   evaluations. Use criteria in the appropriate crew position chapter for evaluations.
   2.1.2. Administer aircrew evaluations on any flight that as scheduled will accomplish all
   required items for that evaluation. Mission evaluations should be as realistic as possible with
   a minimum of simulated events. Do not deviate from peacetime restrictions.
   2.1.3. In accordance with AFI 11-290, Cockpit/Crew Resource Management Training
   Program, crew resource management (CRM) skills will be evaluated during initial and
   periodic evaluations. CRM skills are integral to all phases of flight; therefore no specific area
   titled CRM exists. Document CRM discrepancies under the seven CRM skills areas: mission
   planning, airmanship/situational awareness, crew coordination, communication, risk
   management/decision making, task management, and briefing/debriefing. Evaluators should
   reference AF IMT 4031, CRM Skills Criteria Training/ Evaluation Form and AFI 11-290,
   Cockpit/Crew Resource Management Training Program, for further clarification.
       2.1.3.1. (AFRC) In accordance with AFI 11-290 AFRC SUP 1, CRM skills are
       imbedded within specific grading criteria and include all of the skills listed on the AF
       IMT 4031, CRM Skills Criteria Training/Evaluation Form. Therefore, use of the AF
       IMT 4031 is unnecessary for evaluations in the HC-130 (see AFI 11-290 AFRC SUP 1).
2.2. Requirements.
   2.2.1. Pilots require a combined QUAL/INSTM evaluation and a separate MSN evaluation.
   2.2.2. Navigators, flight engineers, loadmasters, and airborne communications specialists
   receive a combined QUAL/MSN evaluation.
   2.2.3. Instructor evaluations are conducted IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 2, as supplemented
   and Chapter 3 of this instruction. Thoroughly evaluate the examinee’s instructor knowledge
   and ability. Evaluate instructor candidates on a sortie with a representative sampling of unit’s
   basic and/or mission maneuvers that permits accomplishment of all required instructor areas
   IAW Table 2.2.
2.3. Currency of Flight Publications. Evaluate all required in-flight publications, including
checklists, for currency and accuracy on all flight evaluations. Required flying publications are
specified in AFI 11-2HC-130, Volume 3, HC-130--Operations Procedures.
2.4. Formal Course Evaluations. Fly syllabus evaluations IAW syllabus mission profile
guidelines if stated, or on a mission profile developed from syllabus training objectives. All
required areas must be evaluated for the type of evaluation being flown, IAW guidance in this
volume. Grade training objectives and related areas using the performance criteria in this
volume. Formal course guidelines may be modified, based on local operating considerations or
examiner judgment, to complete the evaluation.

     4.1.1. DELETED.
     4.1.2. DELETED.
     4.1.3. DELETED.
4.2. Objective. IAW the guidelines of this instruction, the examinee must satisfactorily
demonstrate the ability to perform all duties safely and effectively, including the operation of
appropriate aircraft systems, IAW applicable technical orders, directives and published
procedures.
4.3. Requirements.
     4.3.1. Instrument/Qualification. See Table 2.3 for required evaluation areas.
        4.3.1.1. Initial/Re-Qualification Evaluations.C-130 basic initial/re-qualification, aircraft
        commander upgrade, and instructor upgrade are conducted at Little Rock and Kirtland
        AFBs. Initial/re-qualification and aircraft commander upgrade evaluations update the
        eligibility for instrument/qualification evaluations. If an initial or re-qualification (return
        to active flight duties) evaluation is administered in-unit, all required areas from Table
        2.3 must be evaluated. The unit commander determines the minimum events due to ―Q-
        3‖ or ―out of eligibility‖ re-qualification. Instructor upgrades evaluations may update the
        eligibility for instrument/qualification if requirements in paragraph 4.3.1.2 are met.
        Evaluations may be conducted in the HC-130 WST (TVC 1 approved tasks).

     4.3.1.2. Periodic Instrument/Qualification Evaluations. Instrument evaluations may not
     be conducted separately from qualification evaluations. Pilot instrument/qualification
     evaluations should include approaches to airfields other than home station or deployed
     locations, if possible. Do not complete a periodic instrument qualification evaluation
     unless, as a minimum, the following are observed in flight: an instrument takeoff, one
     precision approach; one non-precision approach; holding or procedure turn; circling and
     VFR pattern; touch and go procedures; both a 100 and 50 percent flap landing; a
     simulated 3-engine instrument approach, landing, and go-around (MPD pilot, AC, and IP
     only); and a no flap approach and landing (MPD pilot, AC and IP only). Basic qualified
     pilots will conduct their periodic QUAL/INSTM evaluation from the left seat and Basic
     qualified copilots will conduct their QUAL/INSTM from the right seat. Evaluations may
     be conducted in the HC-130 WST (TVC 1 approved tasks).
         4.3.1.2.1. (Added) MPD pilots will conduct their periodic QUAL/INSTM
         evaluations from the left seat and will be coded as FP in the crew position block of
         the AF Form 8.
  4.3.2. Mission. See Table 2.3 for required evaluation areas.
     4.3.2.1. Requirements for All Mission Evaluations. The requirements listed below in
     paragraphs 4.3.2.1.1 thru4.3.2.1.6 are applicable to all initial/requalification and periodic
     mission evaluations.
         4.3.2.1.1. DELETED.
         4.3.2.1.2. HAAR will include a rendezvous and joinup with an actual helicopter;
         completion of the pre-contact, contact and post air refueling checklist; and a
         minimum of one wet/dry contact. EXCEPTION: The requirement for a wet/dry
         contact may be waived by the evaluator if they determine that receiver ability
         precluded a successful probe to drogue contact.
         4.3.2.1.3. Maximum Effort Procedures. If a landing zone is not available, a larger
         runway with clearly identifiable 500 foot touchdown zone may be used. This event is
         normally accomplished as part of the mission evaluation. Mission Copilots do not fly
         these events and are graded while performing non-flying duties only. NVG
         takeoff/landing may be credited if flown to max effort standards. One go-around is
         permitted, provided the aircraft does not touch down short of the zone.
         4.3.2.1.4. (Added) At a minimum, NVG airland requires both an NVG landing and
         takeoff. Normal or maximum effort procedures may be used.
         4.3.2.1.5. Mission CP will be evaluated on non-flying duties for tactical recoveries,
         maximum effort and NVG airland events.
         4.3.2.1.6. (Added) Document which tactical events were flown and the type of terrain
         (mountainous or non-mountainous) in which the mission was flown in the comments
         section of the AF Form 8.
     4.3.2.2. Initial/Re-qualification Mission Evaluations. Initial/re-qualification mission
     qualification is conducted at Kirtland AFB or in-unit with MAJCOM waiver and updates
     the eligibility for the mission evaluation. If an initial or re-qualification (return to active
     flight duties) evaluation is administered in-unit, all required areas from Table 2.3 must be
AFI11-2HC-130V2 1 JANUARY 2005                                                                33


       evaluated. The inflight evaluation profile will include an NVG low-level route flown in
       mountainous terrain to a time on target/arrival (TOT/TOA) event, an HAAR, a computed
       air release point (CARP) airdrop, a tactical recovery/SCA, NVG airland and a maximum
       effort takeoff and landing.
          4.3.2.2.1. MPD pilots receiving initial mission qualification at Kirtland AFB or in-
          unit with MAJCOM approved waiver will fly all syllabus training and initial mission
          evaluation sorties from the right seat and will be coded as MC in the crew position
          block on the AF Form 8.
       4.3.2.3. (Added) Periodic Mission Evaluations. The inflight evaluation profile will
       include an NVG modified-contour low level flown to a time on target/arrival (TOT/TOA)
       event, a maximum effort takeoff and landing, a tactical recovery, NVG airland and either
       an HAR or a computed air release point (CARP) airdrop. HAR will be evaluated inflight
       at least every other periodic evaluation.
          4.3.2.3.1. (Added) The low level will be flown in mountainous terrain at least every
          other periodic evaluation.
          4.3.2.3.2. (Added) Until such time that the HC-130 MQT syllabus reflects the
          integration of the MPD concept, MPD pilots will continue to be evaluated on right-
          seat mission qualification duties. MPD pilots or basic aircraft commanders, who have
          not completed mission aircraft commander upgrade at Kirtland AFB or in unit with
          MAJCOM waiver, will fly periodic mission evaluations from the right seat and will
          be coded as MC in the crew position block on the AF Form 8.
   4.3.3. Special Qualifications Evaluations.
       4.3.3.1. (Added) Right Seat NVG Airland Special Qualification. MPD pilots and
       copilots designated by the unit commander may be qualified in Right Seat NVG Airland.
       See AFI 11-2HC-130V1 for upgrade criteria. Upgrade will be conducted IAW approved
       MAJCOM syllabus. This special qualification evaluation may be conducted separately or
       in conjunction with a reoccurring mission evaluation. See Table 2.3 for required
       evaluation areas. Document this evaluation IAW Paragraph 1.11.2.
          4.3.3.1.1. As a minimum, this special mission evaluation flight profile will consist of
          a tactical recovery to a non-assault NVG landing, both a 50 and 100 percent flap
          NVG landing, NVG touch and go procedures, an NVG go around and a non-assault
          NVG takeoff.
          4.3.3.1.2. On subsequent mission evaluations, right seat NVG airland qualified MPD
          pilots and copilots will be evaluated on flying duties for NVG airland and Tactical
          approach. The flight profile will include all events listed in Paragraph 4.3.3.1.1.

these criteria judiciously to allow for the unique characteristics of each type of landing. Where
runway configuration, arresting cable placement, or flight manual limitations require an
adjustment to the desired touchdown point, a simulated runway threshold will be identified and
the grading criteria applied accordingly. For instrument approaches, the examinee should utilize
a normal glide slope from either the decision height or from a point where visual acquisition of
the runway environment is made.

                               NAVIGATOR EVALUATIONS

5.1. General. The criteria contained here and in Chapter 3 apply to all navigator flight
evaluations.
5.2. Objective. The examinee must satisfactorily demonstrate the ability to perform all
navigator duties safely and effectively, including the operation of appropriate aircraft systems,
IAW applicable flight manuals, and directives.
5.3. Requirements.
   5.3.1. Qualification/Mission Evaluations. See Table 2.4 for required evaluation areas. The
   HAR rendezvous can be to an actual helicopter/tiltrotor aircraft or another C-130 flying HAR
   airspeed. Annotate on the AF Form 8 the type of drop conducted, drop score, TOT/TOA,
   type of LL flown and if it was conducted in mountainous terrain.
       5.3.1.1. Initial/Requalification Qualification/Mission. Required inflight evaluation
       profile will include at least 30 minutes of NVG low level to a time on target/arrival
       (TOT/TOA) event. A tactical event is considered to be HAR, airdrop or SCA. Though
       only one TOT/TOA is required, all three events must be observed. Mountainous low
       level is required on all initial evaluations and requalification evaluations where the
       crewmember was unqualified for greater than six months. Evaluators will determine
       threats for the mission evaluation profile. A minimum of one pre-briefed threat will be
       placed on the low-level route. Additionally, at least one non-preplanned threat will be
       given in flight.
       5.3.1.2. Periodic Qualification/Mission. Required inflight evaluation profile is the
       same as initial/requalification evaluations noted above with the following exceptions:
       Only two tactical events are required, all three are preferable. The third event, if not
       observed in flight, will be evaluated through an alternate method. Do not miss the same
       tactical event on consecutive evaluations (e.g. if SCAs were verbally evaluated on the
       examinees last evaluation, then an SCA must be demonstrated in flight on the next
       evaluation). NVG low level in mountainous terrain must be conducted at least every other
       evaluation. Specific areas identified as basic qualification events (Table 2.4) will be
       demonstrated to the satisfaction of the evaluator during a ground evaluation or inflight.
       5.3.1.3. Simulator Evaluations. Navigators with at least three years of experience in
       the HC-130 aircraft may accomplish periodic qualification evaluations in the simulator
       (OFT, WST, or SNS); however, use simulators as a last resort to perform evaluations. Do
       not conduct consecutive qualification evaluations in the simulator. (EXCEPTION:
       Formal school NRQ (basic re-qualification) students will normally accomplish
       evaluations in the SNS).
   5.3.2. Special Qualification Evaluations. Currently, there are no special qualifications.
