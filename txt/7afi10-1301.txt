1. General:
      1.1. Purpose. Training airspace in Korea is at a premium. Therefore, units must request
      only the airspace required to accomplish their training mission. Allocated airspace no longer
7AFI10-1301 24 JUNE 2009                                                                      3


   required must be promptly returned via notification to 607 AOC/CODO
   (607cod.airspace@osan.af.mil), to make it available to other units. Guidance in this
   instruction establishes procedures to optimize use of this vital resource.
   1.2. References. All US units requesting KTA must know and comply with guidance
   provided in the following references (as applicable to the airspace being utilized): ACCR 51-
   1, Flying Training Low Level Navigation; ACCR 55-5, PilSung Range Joint Operations;
   ACCR 55-9, Procedures for Use of Training Areas; ACCR 55-22, Air to Ground/Air to Air
   Range Procedures; ACCR 60-8, Korean Buffer Zone and Tactical Zone Flight Operations
   and Procedures for the Prevention of Inadvertent Overflight of Non-Friendly Borders, 12
   Dec 97; and Flight Information Publication (FLIP) and Area Planning (AP)/3. All applicable
   regulations and the 7 AF briefing “Airspace 101” are located on the 7 AF Sharepoint at
   (https://osan.eim.pacaf.af.mil/sites/Airspace/default.aspx          (Osan        users)    or
   (https://osane.eim.pacaf.af.mil/sites/Airspace/default.aspx (non-Osan users)) or applicable
   NGA website for FLIP and AP documents. The “Airspace 101” briefing provides a quick
   breakdown of the procedures identified in this instruction as well as contact information for
   607 AOC/CODO Airspace personnel. Additionally, all applicable forms for airspace
   requests are available for downloading from this site.
2. Korean Training Areas (KTAs):
   2.1. Definitions. KTAs include Military Operations Areas (MOAs), low level zones, and
   restricted areas typically available to US units. These areas can be divided into two general
   categories: Centrally Scheduled Airspace and Republic of Korea Air Force (ROKAF) Wing
   Owned Airspace. All training areas are scheduled in 15-minute time blocks. The Air-to-
   Ground ranges may be scheduled, “airspace only” for operations outside the times identified
   in the governing regulations. When scheduled as “airspace only,” no ordnance (live, inert, or
   training) may be expended within the range; EW support is not available; and minimum
   altitude is 7,000 MSL. Requests to use a range for activities other than those specified in
   ACC regulations must be coordinated through the 7 AF Range Manager, 7 AF/A3A (784-
   1898).
   2.2. P-518 Scheduling. Effective 10 Oct 08, 607 AOC/CODO schedules P-518.
   2.3. Centrally Scheduled Airspace (CSA). CSA areas are not owned by specific units and
   are jointly scheduled by 607 AOC/CODO and ROKAF AFOC/DOUM. Each CSA area has
   a percentage of daylight hours allocated for use by 7 AF flying units (Table 1). Actual US
   use may exceed percentages listed in Table 1 depending on ROKAF usage.

Notes: *US receives less daylight time when using the range at night.
**ROKAF aircraft using Air Combat Maneuvering Instrumentation (ACMI) pods have
priority; USAF can use with AFOC/DO approval.
***Due to the small size of MOA 17 and R-105, 607 AOC/CODO will schedule these together.
    2.4. ROKAF Wing Owned Airspace (WOA). WOAs are training areas (MOAs and
    restricted areas) owned by one or more ROKAF wings. See Table 2 and Table 3 for WOA
    airspace designated as Student/Non-Student Training.
    2.4.1. ROKAF Student Training WOA. ROKAF owned airspace that is utilized on a day-to-
    day basis for the training of ROKAF student pilots (Table 2). The amount of Student
    Training WOAs approved by AFOC/DOUM for US use is minimal but may be considered on
    ROKAF no-fly days and outside of ROKAF flying hours.

       2.4.2. ROKAF Non-Student Training WOA. ROKAF owned airspace that is utilized for
       continuation training of ROKAF Combat Mission Ready (CMR) pilots (Table 3).
       Approval/disapproval is dependant on availability of the airspace and coordination with
       ROKAF wing schedulers via AFOC/DOUM.

Note: M2H/3H/15/27N are guaranteed for US use per Combined Coordination Team agreement
for 45 minutes during day and night.
3. Monthly Airspace Meeting. 607 AOC/CODO hosts a monthly airspace meeting NLT the
second Friday of each month. The purpose of this meeting is to review projected ROKAF and
US exercises/inspections; deconflict US forces’ flying windows and range requests for the
following calendar month; and address other relevant airspace issues. Any US unit desiring
KTA should attend this meeting. Units should forward their proposed daily flying windows and
range requests to 607 AOC/CODO NLT the Monday prior to the meeting. Wing scheduling
offices will deconflict subordinate squadron requests before sending them to 607 AOC/CODO.
Attendees at the meeting will review all proposed range requests and negotiate to eliminate any
conflicts. Units that are not able to attend the meeting will have their requests deconflicted in the
priority order listed in Para 5. Note: This is not a scheduling meeting but a deconfliction
meeting. ROKAF requirements are not addressed during the meeting, other than a projection of
their known exercises and inspections. Deconflicted range requests approved at this meeting will
normally have priority over other US units’ range requests at a later date.
4. Authorized Scheduling Agencies. 607 AOC/CODO will only accept KTA requests through
the following:
7AFI10-1301 24 JUNE 2009                                                                  5

   5.1. Airspace requests receive the following priority:
       5.1.1. Joint/Combined exercises and wing inspections/training exercises (CLFE)
       5.1.2. Large force exercises (12 or more aircraft) and AFOC missions (LFE)
       5.1.3. Routine daily training with the following priority:
          5.1.3.1. Range requests corresponding to projections from Monthly Airspace
          Meeting
          5.1.3.2. 7 AF units—alternating wing requests
          5.1.3.3. Other on-peninsula units
          5.1.3.4. Off-peninsula units
6. CSA/WOA Request Processes (7 AF units):
   6.1. CSA. Requesters will submit CSA requests for routine daily missions NLT 1200(I)
   Friday, 17 calendar days prior to the Monday of the week to be flown (Attachment 2). 607
   AOC/CODO will hold negotiations with AFOC/DOUM the following Wednesday to
   determine which unit (US or ROKAF) will receive which times. Results from the
   negotiations will be sent to the requesting units the same day it is approved by
   AFOC/DOUM.
   6.2. CSA Priorities. CSA requests for US routine daily training are filled starting with
   requests for ranges, in the following order:
       6.2.1. Exercise airspace
       6.2.2. Air to Air Refueling (AAR) airspace
       6.2.3. Range requests corresponding to projections from Monthly Airspace Meeting
       6.2.4. 7 AF units--alternating wing requests
       6.2.5. Other on-peninsula units
6                                                                      7AFI10-1301 24 JUNE 2009


       6.2.6. Off-peninsula units
    6.3. WOA/Additional CSA Requests. 7AF Form 8A, Sample of Weekly Airspace
    Request/Approval will be used when submitting the weekly airspace request and 7AF Form
    8B, Sample for Daily Airspace Request/Approval will be used for any subsequent daily
    changes thereafter. Airspace request cannot be filled with CSA may request WOA and/or
    additional CSA on a case-by-case basis to meet mission requirements. Forward requests to
    607 AOC/CODO NLT Thursday at 1200(I) prior to the flying week. Requests will only be
    accepted from approved scheduling agencies listed in para 4. 607 AOC/CODO will compile
    the requests and submit to AFOC/DOUM by 1300(I). AFOC/DOUM will contact ROKAF
    wings to determine what additional airspace they are willing to provide for US missions.
    AFOC/DOUM will return the results to 607 AOC/CODO by Friday at 1500(I), prior to the
    scheduled fly week. 7AF Form 8A and 7AF Form 8B should be submitted via the
    organizational email address.
7. CSA/WOA Request Process (non-7 AF units).
    7.1. Airspace Request Verification Coversheet/Airspace 101 Briefing. The 7 AF Airspace
    Request Verification Coversheet (Attachment 8) ensures all pilots flying in the KTA review
    applicable airspace regulations. Additionally all pilots should review the “Airspace 101”
    briefing. The purpose of this briefing is to ensure all pilots flying in KTA are familiar with
    applicable procedures and know where to access applicable regulations and other guidance.
    The briefing must be accomplished and validated by the Squadron, Detachment or unit
    Commander with an accompanying Airspace Request Verification Coversheet (updated
    annually and maintained by 607 AOC/CODO Airspace). All airspace requests will be
    submitted via email to the 7 AF Airspace organizational account as outlined in the briefing.
    Units TDY to Korea, operating in Korea from TDY locations off the Korean peninsula, or
    operating from an aircraft carrier must be hosted by one of the scheduling agencies listed in
    para 4 (or as approved by 607 AOC/CODO Airspace). Navy flight crews on deployment to
    the Korean Theater must review the “Airspace 101” brief before conducting operations in the
    KTA. Units can request a copy of the airspace brief by calling 607 AOC/CODO Airspace,
    DSN 784-2488, or accessing the 7 AF Airspace web-site (see para 1.2).
    7.2. Off-Peninsula (Off-Pen) Letter. All units not permanently assigned to the Korean
    Peninsula are required to be approved by 607 AOC/CC, which may be delegated to 607
    AOC/COD, prior to requesting airspace through 607 AOC/CODO. Units will be added to
    the Off-Pen letter (Attachment 9) after 607 AOC/CODO has received the appropriate
    Airspace Request Verification Coversheet. The initial Off-Pen Letter will be submitted NLT
    30 days prior to the first of the month or the first day of flying. Changes will be submitted
    NLT 30 days prior to the flying date. Late submissions will be worked on the last day of the
    subsequent month.
    7.3. CSA/WOA. Requesters must submit CSA requests for a routine daily mission NLT
    1200(I) on Friday, 17 calendar days prior to the Monday of the week to be flown
    (Attachment 3). 607 AOC/CODO will hold negotiations with AFOC/DOUM the following
    Wednesday to determine which unit (US or ROKAF) will receive which times. Results from
    the negotiations will be sent to the requesting units the same day it is approved by
    AFOC/DOUM. If additional airspace is needed, resubmit requests daily.
    7.4. CSA Priorities. For airspace priorities refer to para. 6.2.
7AFI10-1301 24 JUNE 2009                                                                         7


8. Daily Changes. Daily change requests must be made through the unit’s approved scheduling
agency. The unit’s approved scheduling agency will ensure that they are not requesting airspace
that is already allocated/assigned. All airspace changes after 1700(I) the day before or the day of
the mission will be coordinated through the Battle Watch Duty Officer (BWDO), DSN 784-
4097.
9. Large Force Exercises/Inspections.
   9.1. Combined/Joint Large Force Exercise/Inspection (CLFE). Requesters must submit
   airspace requests for exercises/inspections NLT 9 weeks prior to exercise week. Submit
   requests IAW Attachment 6. 607 AOC/CODO will return approved airspace to affected
   units NLT 2 weeks prior to week of the exercise.
   9.2. Large Force Exercises/Inspection (LFE). LFE airspace requests must be submitted to
   607 AOC/CODO NLT 5 weeks prior to mission week. Approved airspace will be
   disseminated to units NLT 2 weeks prior to the mission week.
10. Air Refueling.
   10.1. Published Refueling Tracks. Requesters must submit requests for air refueling
   airspace NLT Friday, 17 days prior to the week to be flown. Submit requests on CSA
