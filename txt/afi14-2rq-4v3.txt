                                             Chapter 3

                          EXTERNAL INTELLIGENCE TRAINING

3.1. Introduction. There are two types of EIT: Aircrew Intelligence Training (AIT) and Force
Protection Intelligence Training (FPIT). AIT will be coordinated with the wing/group tactics
flight or officer. FPIT will be coordinated with force protection (FP) organizations (e.g.,
Security Forces (SF), Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI)) as defined in AFI 14-
119, Intelligence Support to Force Protection (FP). (T-2)
     3.1.1. AIT is EIT provided to the units’ assigned and attached pilots/SOs. When assigned,
     the USAF Intelligence Sensor Weapons Instructor Course graduate will be directly involved
     with the AIT program. (T-3)
     3.1.2. FPIT is EIT provided by the host unit intelligence function to the unit’s SF and other
     FP support agencies (e.g., AFOSI, Civil Engineering). FPIT will be conducted IAW AFI 14-
     119 and supporting documents. When possible, a FP Intelligence Formal Training Unit
     graduate will be responsible for the management of the FPIT program. If the intelligence
     function is not part of the host unit, the tenant unit responsibilities in AFI 14-119 will be
     adhered to. (T-3)
     3.1.3. Training methods will include, but are not limited to briefings, demonstration-
     performance, formal and informal lectures, and academic training sessions. (T-3)
     3.1.4. Training resources can include, but are not limited to threat briefings, current
     intelligence briefings, theater orientation briefings, CDs/DVDs or web-based training
     materials, and weapons system videos. (T-3)
3.2. SIO Responsibilities. The SIO will:
     3.2.1. Establish an EIT program tailored to the unit’s mission, weapons systems, projected
     wartime/Air and Space Expeditionary Force tasking and base/deployment location(s). (T-2)
     3.2.2. Appoint program managers to oversee AIT and FPIT execution. (T-3)
     3.2.3. Assign only qualified trainers to conduct unsupervised EIT. AFI 14-2RQ-4, Volumes
     1 and 2, and AFI 14-202, Volumes 1 and 2, identify specialized training requirements and
     evaluation criteria for EIT trainers. (T-2)
     3.2.4. Ensure written guidance outlines procedures for conducting, documenting, testing,
     evaluating, monitoring and reporting EIT. (T-3)
     3.2.5. Coordinate EIT written instructions with all applicable commanders. Written
     guidance will be coordinated with any agency that assists intelligence personnel in providing
     training, as well as any agency for which intelligence provides training on a regularly
     scheduled basis. (T-3)
     3.2.6. Develop intelligence training for other base/unit personnel, if appropriate. (T-3)
3.3. Aircrew Intelligence Training.

     3.3.1.2. Review training objectives for currency prior to the beginning of the training
     cycle. (T-3)
     3.3.1.3. Actively solicit feedback to ensure training objectives are meeting training
     requirements. (T-3)
     3.3.1.4. Conduct trend analysis following each training cycle; document lessons learned
     and apply those lessons during subsequent cycles. (T-3)
     3.3.1.5. Provide a written evaluation of the wing/group AIT program to the appropriate
     commander(s) at the end of each training cycle. The written evaluation will include at a
     minimum: the percent or number of personnel trained; trend analysis (e.g., high miss
     questions, weak areas); and corrective actions taken. Incorporate feedback as applicable.
     (T-3)
  3.3.2. Squadron intelligence personnel will:
     3.3.2.1. Provide input to and execute the AIT program. (T-2)

     3.3.2.4. Document AIT provided. Documentation of AIT will include the names of
     personnel receiving training, date training was accomplished, the topic taught, and the
     name of the trainer conducting the training. In addition, they will provide a written
     evaluation of the squadron’s AIT program to the squadron commander and the AIT
     program manager at the end of the training cycle (see attachment 2). (T-3)
  3.3.3. The AIT plan will be specifically tailored to meet unit/mission requirements. Teach
  each item in the AIT training plan at least once during the training cycle. Evaluate the
  objectives for each AIT category with a test (85 percent minimum to pass). (T-3)
  3.3.4. Prorate training based on unit contingency operations tempo IAW the appropriate AFI
  11-2MDS, Volume 1. Outline the details of the prorating schedule in the AIT Plan and/or
  other written instructions. (T-3)
  3.3.5. Aircrew intelligence training categories include threat knowledge and collection and
  reporting (C&R). Include other categories based on the unit’s mission as required. (T-2)
     3.3.5.1. Threat Knowledge. Develop specific threat knowledge training objectives
     tailored to the unit mission, local area, deployment base(s), and forward operating
     locations. Concentrate on threats in selected countries with the potential for direct unit
     involvement. Minimum standards for threat training briefings are listed in attachment 3.
     References listed in this publication can be supplemented with other classified and
     unclassified resources (e.g., National Air and Space Intelligence Center products, Tactics

        3.3.5.2. Collection and Reporting. Collection and reporting training will focus on items
        necessary to enable pilots and SOs to initiate reports capturing perishable, critical
        information of intelligence value (e.g., In-flight Report [INFLTREP], Communications
        Instructions Reporting Vital Intelligence Sightings) and familiarize them with the
        information requirements of the intelligence-generated Mission Report (MISREP) and
        Intelligence Report (INTREP). A critical component of C&R training will be the unit’s
        essential elements of information (EEI). Training will identify and describe theater-
        specific and peacetime reporting requirements.
3.4. Force Protection Intelligence Training.
     3.4.1. The FPIT program manager will:
        3.4.1.1. Build an effective training program, including training plans, with input from SF
        personnel, AFOSI, and FP support agencies, as appropriate. (T-3)
        3.4.1.2. Actively solicit feedback to ensure training objectives are meeting training
        requirements. (T-3)
     3.4.1.3. Provide a feedback of FPIT provided to the appropriate commander(s) at the end of
     each training cycle. (T-3)
     3.4.2. The FPIT plan will ensure FPIT is conducted IAW AFI 14-119 and will be
     specifically tailored to meet unit/mission FP requirements. Each item in the FPIT training
     plan will be taught IAW the FP customers objectives. (T-2)
     3.4.3. All FPIT will be documented to include the names of personnel receiving training,
     date training was accomplished, the topics taught, and the name of the trainer conducting the
     training. (T-3)

 Most common topics not completed:                              C&R

 2. In accordance with the EIT Plan, each member is required to be trained on each training item
 at least once each training cycle. At the completion of the training cycle, the following crew
 members have not completed the annotated training items:

 Name                                             Intelligence Training Item
 John A. Doe                                      Directed Energy Weapons
 Susan L. Smith                                   SA-6, RPGs
 Zane G. Thomas                                   SA-2/3/8

 3. The annual Intelligence MQF test was administered on [DATE]. All combat mission ready
 personnel have taken the 100 question test. Not all crew members obtained the minimum
 passing score of 85 percent the first time around. A total of 25 crew members took the test.
 The initial average test score for the squadron was 95 percent.

 XX RS Intelligence Test Results
 Total # crew members to take test                              25
 # of questions                                                 100
 Knowledge questions                                            50
 Knowledge questions—average score                              92%
 Knowledge questions—most commonly missed                       5 (SA-2)
                                                                8 (SA-6)
                                                                13 (SRQ-47)
                                                                14 (Collection)
                                                                21 (Reporting)

4. The most commonly missed questions were #5, 8, 13, 14 and 21. After further review of
questions 14 and 21, it is likely these questions were missed because they were poorly worded
and difficult to understand. Questions 5, 8, and 13 focused on the SA-2, SA-6, and C&R
respectively. The squadron intelligence section will increase emphasis on these threat systems
during the next training cycle. Attached is a breakout of the test questions and how many times
each question was missed.
