MEMORANDUM FOR ACC

FROM: HQ ACC/A3
      205 Dodd Blvd, Suite 101
      Joint Base Langley-Eustis, VA 23665-2789

SUBJECT: ACC Guidance Memorandum for Isolated Personnel Report (ISOPREP)

Releasability: There are no releasability restrictions on this publication.

        By Order of the Commander, Air Combat Command, this ACC Guidance Memorandum
immediately implements Isolated Personnel Report (ISOPREP) procedures. Compliance with
this memorandum is mandatory. To the extent its direction is inconsistent with other Air Force
publications, the information herein prevails, in accordance with (IAW) AFI 33-360,
Publications and Forms Management. The authorities to waive wing/unit level requirements in
this publication are identified with a Tier (“T-0, T-1, T-2, T-3”) number following the
compliance statement. See AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management, Table 1.1. for a
description of the authorities associated with the Tier numbers. Submit requests for waivers
through the chain of command to the appropriate Tier waiver approval authority, or alternately,
to the Publication OPR for non-tiered compliance items.

       The attached defines key responsibilities and tasks to implement Personnel Recovery
Mission Software (PRMS) ISOPREPs and assigns individual responsibilities for ISOPREP
development, updates, managerial duties, responsibilities and oversight requirements for ACC
personnel and ACC gained personnel only.

       Ensure all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this Memorandum are
maintained in accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records,
and disposed of IAW the Air Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS)
Records Disposition Schedule (RDS).

        The guidance in this Memorandum becomes void after one-year has elapsed from the
date of this Memorandum, or upon release of an AF publication incorporating the guidance,
whichever is earlier.


                                                              DAVID M. GAEDECKE
                                                              Colonel, USAF
                                                              Deputy Director of Operations
                                     Agile Combat Power
1. PRMS is the CCMD-directed (Combatant Command) program of record for deployed
member’s ISOPREP information when isolated. An ISOPREP is a record used by recovery
forces to identify or authenticate individuals who are isolated or in captivity. The intent of this
guidance is primarily to address the large amount of deployable non-rated Airmen who need an
ISOPREP because of CCMD -driven requirements. ISOPREP requirements are addressed in
Joint Publication 3-50 Personnel Recovery and AFI 16-1301 Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and
Escape (SERE) Programs.

2. PRMS enables ISOPREP development, storage, update, retrieval and system management by
Individuals, Unit Managers (UM), Recovery Coordinators and System Administrators. PRMS is
a web-based application on SIPRNET which supports management of ISOPREP information.
Upon notification of an isolating event, the Joint Personnel Recovery Center (JPRC)/Personnel
Recovery Coordination Cell (PRCC) uses PRMS to search and immediately access ISOPREP
information to support recovery operations. PRMS eliminates the need to forward ISOPREP
data to JPRC/PRCC during combat operations. ISOPREP information is classified as
CONFIDENTIAL once completed, and should be carefully safeguarded to prevent unnecessary
compromise.

3. This guidance memorandum applies to all ACC Active Duty Air Force, DOD Civilians
and DOD Contractors assigned or attached to ACC, or conducting operations in support of
CCMD directives. Exception: Commanders may exempt DOD Civilians and DOD
contractors IAW CCMD guidance when assigned to US Territories who have no possibility
of deploying or attending Temporary Duty outside of US Territories.

Note: Air Force Reserve (USAFR) and Air National Guard (ANG (in Title 10 or Title 32 U.S.C.
status) have PRMS policies that will apply to all Air Reserve Component (ARC) deploying
personnel. These policies correlate with this document to ensure compliance when ARC forces
are ACC-gained.

10.1.6. A stand-alone Secret laptop for the sole purpose of creating ISOPREPs can be used in
units with high populations of personnel without Secret clearances or SIPRNET accounts. Units
may utilize a Secret computer which is NOT connected to the LAN, as outlined in Attachment 3.
This method requires the UM personally monitor each member as they input data to the stand-
alone system. The UM then imports data from the stand-alone laptop to the PRMS Database
using the account to import the saved files (ensure that the stored ISOPREPs are completed using
the PDF file downloaded from the PRMS website). Each stand-alone Secret laptop must be
stored in a GSA-approved safe when not in physical control of the UM. (T-3)

11. PHOTOGRAPHS

11.1. Photographs may be taken with any digital camera to include a cell phone. Photographs
must be downloaded/e-mailed or scanned to a NIPR computer and then transferred to a Compact
Disc, and have a minimum native 640x480 resolution. This disc can then be transferred to a
SIPRNET computer and the photographs uploaded into the ISOPREP. When compact discs are
used, they must be marked appropriately, inventoried and controlled, or destroyed immediately
after upload is complete. Photographs must be in JPEG format and may be no larger than 200
KiloBytes. Photographs shall be one frontal, one right profile, and must be visible from the
shoulder up to ensure the face can be easily recognized. Full body pictures are not authorized.
(T-3)

Note: Photograph uploads need to be performed as a separate action. After all information
(including statements and authentication number) is entered and saved, select “Browse” to
locate, upload, and save photos. Once complete, the “Completed Date” field on the ISOPREP
will auto fill. The Dashboard will indicate “Completed-Not reviewed” until a UM does the
Initial review (members with only an Individual role cannot do the Initial Review but can do all
subsequent reviews). Failure to follow these procedures will result in the ISOPREP not loading
correctly and cause the PRMS program to lock, requiring personnel to re-accomplish the entire
ISOPREP.

“Personal authentication statements require declarative sentences, not questions and answers.
They should involve personal details that are easily remembered and not subject to change.
Details of friends, relatives (other than immediate family), pets, vehicles, vacations, and other
such details would be appropriate (e.g., “My first car was a blue, 4-door, 1979 Trans Am.”).
Avoid references to dates, ages, or other information from the individual’s military records or
public information. Recovery forces will be able to derive several questions from each statement
to authenticate the individual. Some simple guidelines are listed below: (T-2)
(1) Do not invent stories that may not be remembered during an actual recovery due to the stress
of the situation. (T-2)
(2) Do not use memories subject to change, (i.e., My favorite ice cream is…, My current dog is).
(T-2)
(3) Do not use slang or jargon that may not be understood by the recovery forces. If the recovery
force cannot understand the statement, they cannot formulate a question. (T-2)
(4) Avoid using culturally sensitive information. (T-2)
(5) Avoid using information that would cause embarrassment if disclosed. (T-2)
f. Additional data entered, as a minimum, should provide SERE/CoCT courses and year
attended, known medical conditions (e.g., allergies, medication), and other information as
directed for local use, or as stated in theater guidance. (T-2)
g. Provide current front and side view photographs of the individual in the appropriate
uniform without headgear. Provide digital photographs when using a digital ISOPREP”. (T-2)
51. (Required) Personal Authentication Statement #2. (T-2)
52. (Required) Personal Authentication Statement #3. (T-2)
53. (Required) Personal Authentication Statement #4. (T-2)
54. (Required) Authentication Number. Use the following guidance from JP 3-50,
Annex F to Appendix K, K-F-1: (T-3)
“When choosing numeric codes, use a number that can be easily remembered. This number
should not be in the individual’s military records or be public information. The number should
not be sequential (1234, 9876, etc.), have repeated numbers (7777, 2299, etc.), or have zeros.”
