                        GENERAL POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

2.1. General Information. There are a number of policies and procedures which apply to
assignment actions and personnel programs. Exceptions and/or deviations from policies and
procedures may be authorized by the AF/RE, AF/RE(D), AFRC/CC or AFRC/CV.
2.2. Equal Opportunity. The management of AGRs will be free of discrimination based upon
race, color, religion, sex, and national origin. The AGR program will support military equal
opportunity and affirmative employment efforts to achieve an AGR work force that reflects
national diversity. The objective is to ensure fair, equitable and nondiscriminatory treatment of
all, based on merit, fitness, capability and potential.
2.3. AGR Assignment Eligibility Requirements. An individual must meet all appropriate

compatible with the position.
   2.3.1. Grade, AFSC and Skill Level Relationship for AGR Assignments. Exceptions to
   policy will be approved by AF/REP, AFRC/A1A or AFRC/A1L with
   coordination/concurrence from the AFRC functional.
       2.3.1.1. Enlisted personnel must be awarded the advertised AFSC and be equal to or no

       grade below the authorized grade of the advertised position.
   2.3.2. Retraining. The intent of the AGR program is to assess fully qualified individuals.
   Retraining will be considered on a case-by-case basis as the mission dictates pending AFRC
   MAJCOM Functional Area Manager (FAM) concurrence. Failure to complete retraining
   IAW applicable regulatory guidance is grounds for removal from the AGR program.
       2.3.2.1. Members approved for retraining may incur an AFR service commitment IAW
       AFRCI 36-2102, Air Force Reserve Service Commitment Date Program upon completion
       of training.

   retainability to fulfill an AGR assignment.
   2.3.6. Fitness Standards. Applicants must meet current AF fitness standards IAW AFI 36-
   2905, Fitness Program.
   2.3.7. Security Clearance. Assigned organizations and individual AGRs are responsible for
   maintaining current security clearances. As a minimum, a secret clearance, or the ability to
   obtain a secret clearance, is required for entry into the AGR program.
       2.3.7.1. AGRs who are selected for a follow-on AGR assignment must have a current
       security clearance or have initiated a periodic reinvestigation prior to receiving new AGR
       assignment order.
       2.3.7.2. If an applicant is accepted for a position requiring a top secret (TS) security
       clearance, but does not hold a clearance at the TS level, the member must initiate a
       security clearance update. AFRC/A1A will provide an official memorandum to the AGR
       selectee for notifying their current unit security manager to initiate a new security
       investigation. AFRC/A1A will not issue AGR orders until a security clearance upgrade
       is initiated and the gaining organization has granted an interim clearance.
   2.3.8. Medical Requirements. Applicants selected for an initial AGR assignment must meet
   the medical standards as outlined in AFI 48-123V2, Medical Examination and Standards,
   prior to assignment. All personnel applying for AGR positions to OCONUS locations must
   have their family members medically cleared for the assignment as well. Members currently
   undergoing MEB are ineligible to apply.
       2.3.8.1. Applicants with exceptional family members should follow the guidance of AFI
       36-2110, Assignments, Attachment 25, Exceptional Family Member Program (EFMP).
       Applicants with dependents requiring EFMP services must contact the EFMP coordinator
       at the losing location for coordination at the gaining location.
       2.3.8.2. The appropriate Reserve Medical Unit (RMU) or Active Duty Medical Squadron
       (ADMS) will certify medical evaluations for active military or prior service applicants
       applying for AGR positions as long as no disqualifying medical conditions are present.
       The Chief, Aerospace Medicine of the supporting RMU or ADMS will certify the
       appropriate medical documentation. If applicable, a memorandum from the gaining
       commander or equivalent is required stating their willingness to accept an individual’s
       physical restrictions.
2.3.8.3. AFRC/SG is the certification/waiver authority for all applicants with no service
affiliation, disqualifying medical conditions, or current/previous Assignment Limitation Code
(ALC) C status. All requests for waivers shall be included with the submitted package.
AFI36-2132 20 MARCH 2012                                                                        11


       2.3.8.4. Applicants who are selected for an AGR assignment and are assigned to the
       Individual Ready Reserve (IRR) will process through their local AFR recruiter. The
       applicant shall be cleared by the RMU or Military Entrance Processing Station (MEPS)
       prior to AGR assignment start date.
2.4. Application Procedures. Information regarding AGR application procedures may be
found on the personnel websites such as Air Force Personnel System (AFPERS) or Reserve
Management Vacancy System (RMVS) via the AF Portal, or by contacting the AFRC/A1A
office.
2.5. AGR Assignment Program. Assignments in the AGR program are managed through an
assignment eligibility process that aligns under operational (required assignment fill actions) and
MDR fill actions. All assignment actions are guided by selecting the best-qualified individual to
support AFR mission requirements, while additionally supporting AGR career management and
force development protocols.
   2.5.1. The overall composition and ongoing evolution of AGR force requirements has
   resulted in the need to establish a Deliberately Managed and a Voluntary Assignment
   personnel management construct. While the majority of personnel policy and guidance is
   conducive to both constructs, there is a need to specialize our assignment and utilization
   expectation for each distinctive track.
       2.5.1.1. The Deliberately Managed track will include AGRs who are assigned to colonel,
       lieutenant colonel, major, chief master sergeant, and senior master sergeant positions.
       AFR leadership will have the ability to manage senior AGRs, and associated
       requirements that provide AFR strategic management, vision, and operational perspective
       that have high visibility and impact on AFR mission success. Additionally, these
       positions will provide the platform for force development and assignment experience
       opportunities for our exceptional AFR performers.
       2.5.1.2. The Voluntary Assignments track will capitalize and utilize the segment of the
       AGR force that provides technical skill sets and specialized experience. Within this track,
       due to manpower and mission requirements, the primary expectation will be to provide
       the operational unit the capability to retain necessary skills and experience.
2.6. AGR Vacancies:
   2.6.1. AGR vacancies will be posted on the personnel websites such as Air Force Personnel
   System (AFPERS) or Reserve Management Vacancy System (RMVS) via the AF Portal.
   AFRC/A1 assignment facilitators will also send out notifications to AFR personnel of posted
   vacancies. Following the closing date of the announcement, AFRC/A1A (AFRC/A1L for
   colonel positions) will screen and forward qualified applicants to the selecting official.
       2.6.1.1. For lieutenant colonel positions and below, if two or more current AGRs apply
       for the position, those packages will initially be sent to the hiring official. Exception to
       this policy may be made for Key, Command, and Joint Assignments upon approval by
       AF/RE. If the hiring official does not select a current AGR, they must provide written
       justification for non-selection to AFRC/A1A.
       2.6.1.2. Once AFRC/A1A receives justification, the hiring official will be sent
       applications from other Selected Reserve categories (ART, TR, and IMA). If the hiring
12                                                            AFI36-2132 20 MARCH 2012


     official does not select a Selected Reserve applicant, they must provide written
     justification for non-selection to AFRC/A1A.
     2.6.1.3. If all Selected Reserve applicants have been disqualified by the hiring official,
     AFRC/A1A will forward any ANG or active duty applications to the hiring official.
     2.6.1.4. If all applicants do not meet the needs of the hiring authority, the vacancy may
     be advertised again on the personnel websites such as Air Force Personnel System
     (AFPERS) or Reserve Management Vacancy System (RMVS) via the AF Portal.
     2.6.1.5. For advertised colonel postings, all applications regardless of Selected Reserve
     status will be considered.
     2.6.1.6. Key, Command, and Joint Assignments. At the direction of the CAFR,
     AF/RE(D), AFRC/CC, or AFRC/CV, direct placements may be made to fill positions
     designated as Key, Command, or Joint positions without priority consideration for
     current AGRs.
  2.6.2. Management Directed Reassignment (MDR). Senior leadership within the respective
  organizational programs that have AGRs assigned can select qualified AGRs for MDRs in
  the grades Lt Col and below and SMSgt and below. Senior leadership will leverage the
  MDR program to effectively integrate personnel force development goals, operational
  requirements, and career management objectives that sustain and support AFR requirements.
     2.6.2.1. MDRs which cross organizational command chains or would result in a
     promotion, and MDRs in the grade of colonel and chief master sergeant are not
     permitted. Requests for exception to policy are reviewed on a case-by-case basis and
     require MAJCOM FAM concurrence, AFRC/CV or AF/RE(D) approval. Exceptions are
     permitted for officers who have been selected by a promotion board and have not yet
     pinned on or currently occupying a higher graded position.
     2.6.2.2. AGRs should serve at least 24 months in their present position to be considered
     for a MDR. Reassignment actions, for MDRs with less than 24 months in current
     assignment, will be considered on a case-by-case basis. Additionally, AFRC/A1A will
     review other personnel program policies to ensure an appropriate reassignment selection
     criterion is satisfied.
     2.6.2.3. AFRC/A1A will be notified via official memorandum, initiated by the Wing
     Commander or equivalent, of all MDR actions. AFRC/A1A concurrence of MDR action
     is required prior to actual movement of AGR personnel. For all MDR actions which will
     result in a PCS assignment, concurrence from member is required in writing and
     declination will not affect career status. Declination will affect continuation in the
     Deliberately Managed track. Declination will result in being moved to the Voluntary
     Assignments track thus limiting future assignment choices.
     2.6.2.4. AFRC/A1A (AFRC/A1L for colonel positions) will publish MDR reassignment
     orders for all HQ assigned AGRs. AFR FSMs will publish MDR reassignment orders for
     all unit assigned AGRs. AFRCRS FSM will publish orders for personnel assigned to
     recruiting service.
AFI36-2132 20 MARCH 2012                                                                       13


       2.6.2.5. For assignments out of the AGR program, the second endorsement will be
       completely filled in and signed by FSM for the gaining organization and returned to
       AFRC/A1A for further separation processing.
2.7. Assignment Type, Length and Extension. AFRC/A1A (AFRC/A1L for colonel
positions) and the assignment approval authorities manage assignment lengths and extensions.
Issues impacting assignment decisions are determined by career status, assignment location,
developmental education, force development, time on station, and other AGR program
management issues. Less than 36 months time on station (TOS) requires AFRC/A1A approval
for lieutenant colonels and below (AFRC/A1 for colonels) and less than 24 months TOS requires
AFRC/CV approval.
   2.7.1. Initial Assignment. Unless otherwise indicated, initial assignment length is 4 years,
   except for colonels for whom the initial assignment length will be 3 years. Initial assignment
   length for AGRs accessed as recruiters is 3 years. The probationary period begins when the
   individual starts their initial AGR assignment and continues until the individual is granted
   career status but not greater than 6 years.
   2.7.2. Joint Assignments. Assignments to the Joint Staff will comply with Chairman of the
   Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction (CJCSI) 1320.01, Assignment of Enlisted Personnel to the
   Joint Staff and CJCSI 1330.01, Assignment of Officers (Colonel and Below) to the Joint Staff.
   Assignments to other joint positions will comply with AFI 36-2110, Assignments. For career
   management purposes, joint assignments will be term limited with initial AGR assignment
   established for a 3-year period. AGRs in joint assignments on their initial AGR assignment
   will not meet an ARB for consideration of career status. Joint assigned AGRs may apply for
   advertised AGR positions.
   2.7.3. Assignment to a Temporary Position. Temporary AGR positions may be created
   based on special mission requirements or as directed. AGRs assigned to these positions are
   term limited and will not meet an ARB for consideration of career status. Upon completion
   of the temporary assignment, non-career AGRs may be released from the AGR program or
   apply for another AGR position.
   2.7.4. OCONUS Assignments. OCONUS assignments will be for an initial maximum of 3
   years. An option for a 1 year extension (not to exceed assignment to the OCONUS for more
   than 4 years total) will be at the commander’s discretion. Requests for OCONUS 1 year
   extensions with commanders signed concurrence will be submitted to the full time support
   office and routed to AFRC/CV. AFRC/CV is the approval authority for all OCONUS
   extension requests. Provisions of AFI 36-2110 as it pertains to local nationals will apply on a
   case-by-case basis.
   2.7.5. Term Assignments. Term assignments are permanently funded authorizations that
   have been determined by AF/RE(D) and AFRC/CV to require routine rotation. Term
   assignments are particularly suited for career fields that have insufficient AGR career and
   force development opportunities. Examples include, but are not limited to, Inspector General,
   Chaplain, Legal, and Medical career fields. Assignment lengths will be dependent on AFR
   requirements and will be predetermined prior to assignment fill action. Contact the
   AFRC/A1A office for a current listing of AGR non-sustainable (term) career fields.
 14                                                               AFI36-2132 20 MARCH 2012


       2.7.5.1. Non-career AGRs serving in a term assignment will not meet an ARB and will
       be separated at the end of the term assignment. However, members may apply for another
       AGR term position or non-term advertised positions.
       2.7.5.2. Career Status: An AGR has Career Status upon being accepted into the career
       AGR program. An AGR is accepted into the career program (1) when accepted by an
       AGR review board, (2) when orders enable the AGR to exceed the 6-year probationary
       period as an AGR, or (3) when the AGR reaches sanctuary. The career program provides
       an AGR with career opportunities for promotion, career progression, retention, education
       and professional development. This program may lead to a military retirement after
       attaining the required years of Federal service. Career AGRs may have the ability to
       serve to their HYT, MSD, age 60 date or 20 year TAFMSD, whichever occurs first.
       Retention in the AGR program depends upon adhering to force utilization standards.
       Career AGRs will adhere to existing policy and guidance impacting AGR programs and
       will accept PCS, training, developmental education, and force development opportunities.
       2.7.5.3. Career AGRs who fill a term assignment will not meet an ARB but will be
       career managed at the end of the term assignment. Career management may include a
       follow on assignment or retirement. Members may apply for other advertised positions
       and if selected, will remain in the AGR program.
   2.7.6. Recruiter Assignments. All reserve personnel regardless of status are encouraged to
   pursue career-broadening assignments within the AFRCRS. Personnel selected for a
   recruiting position shall attend and successfully complete all required recruiter training while
   still assigned to their current position and status. Initial assignment length for AGRs
   accessed as recruiters is 3 years.
   2.7.7. Assignment Extensions. Assignment extensions will be dependent upon operational
   requirements, career management, and AGR program requirements. See Table 2.3 for
   detailed tour extension information.
2.8. Use of AGR Resources. AGRs must be assigned to validated Unit Manning Document
(UMD) positions compatible with their military grade and AFSC. AGR over grades are not
allowed and overages are not permitted.
   2.8.1. New or changes to AGR requirements. AFI 38-201, Determining Manpower
   Requirements, Chapter 7, will be utilized for establishment/changes to AGR positions.
   AFRC/A1A will be notified during initiation process. Once positions are established or
   changed, the appropriate hiring authority may take recruiting actions only when approved by
   AFRC/A1A or AFRC/A1L and authorized by AFRC/CV. New accessions should not be
   authorized prior to new positions being funded, validated, and placed on the appropriate
   UMD.
2.9. Deployment of AGRs. AGRs are ordered to duty under the authority of Title 10 U.S.C. §
12301(d) which authorizes the Secretary of Defense , with the consent of the member, to call a
member of the Reserve to active duty. Title 10 U.S.C. § 10211 establishes Headquarters officer
AGRs and places them “at the seat of government, and at headquarters responsible for reserve
affairs, to participate in preparing and administering the policies and regulations affecting those
reserve components.” Title 10 U.S.C § 12310 allows all other AGRs “to perform Active Guard
and Reserve duty organizing, administering, recruiting, instructing, or training the reserve
AFI36-2132 20 MARCH 2012                                                                      15


components.” This duty could be at a headquarters or at the unit level. Regardless of the role of
an AGR, the law severely limits AGR deployments that are not in direct support of reserve
missions. The congressional intent in this law is clear and specifically drives the following AGR
deployment policy. See AFI 10-401, AFRC Supplement 1, Air Force Operation Planning and
Execution, for AGR deployments.
   2.9.1. Under no circumstances will a Headquarters AGR be involuntarily tasked to fulfill an
   active duty deployment requirement. Voluntary AGR deployments will be considered on a
   case-by-case basis when it is in the best interests of the Air Force Reserve, provides a
   significant career development opportunity for the AGR, and meets the requirements in the
   paragraph above.
2.10. Controlled Grades. AGRs are managed within the congressionally mandated end-
strength authorizations for senior master sergeant, chief master sergeant, major, lieutenant
colonel, and colonel. Assignment or promotion to these controlled grades cannot exceed the
annually established military duty end-strength or grade ceilings. Reserve FSMs, AFRC/A1K
and AFRCRS must obtain control grade ceiling clearance from AFRC/A1A prior to requesting
promotion authorization from the promotion authority.

                                           Chapter 3

                        CAREER PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION

3.1. Entry into the AGR Career Program. An AGR has Career Status upon being accepted
into the career AGR program. An AGR is accepted into the career program (1) when accepted by
an AGR review board, (2) when orders enable the AGR to exceed the 6-year probationary period
as an AGR, or (3) when the AGR reaches sanctuary. The career program provides an AGR with
career opportunities for promotion, career progression, retention, education and professional
development. This program may lead to a military retirement after attaining the required years of
Federal service. Career AGRs may have the ability to serve to their HYT, MSD, age 60 date or
20 year TAFMSD, whichever occurs first. Retention in the AGR program depends upon
adhering to force utilization standards. Career AGRs will adhere to existing policy and guidance
impacting AGR programs and will accept PCS, training, developmental education, and force
development opportunities.
   3.1.1. When career status is granted for officers, the DOS will be extended to the 20-year
   TAFMS, mandatory Separation Date (MSD), or age 60 whichever comes first. However,
   continuation will be managed based on tour lengths (3, 4, or 5 years) for purposes of
   determining continued retainability. Career status does not guarantee completion of 20-years
   TAFMS, or reaching MSD, or continuing to age 60.
   3.1.2. When career status is granted for enlisted members, continuation is managed in 5-year
   increments (for reenlistment purposes) up to the 20-year TAFMS, High Year of Tenure
   (HYT) date, or age 60 whichever comes first. Members must obtain the necessary
   retainability to support continuation. With their commander’s approval, enlisted AGRs who
   are granted continuation as a result of the ARB are authorized to reenlist or extend to support
   the retainability requirement as directed by the ARB regardless of current ETS. Career status
   does not guarantee completion of 20-years TAFMS, or reaching HYT, or continuing to age
   60
   3.1.3. AGRs who have been approved for entry into the AGR career program and
   subsequently separate from the AGR program may forfeit their career status. If an officer or
   enlisted member leaves the AGR program as part of the Deliberately Managed track to meet
   the needs of the AFR, they will not be required to forfeit their career status. Officer and
   enlisted personnel who return to the AGR program with more than a 30 day break in AGR
   status (for reasons other than supporting the needs of AFR) will serve a new probationary
   period and be reconsidered for entry into the career program IAW this AFI.
3.2. Tour Expiration. Individuals who are not granted career status during the probationary
period may be separated on their DOS. All AGRs, regardless of their career status, are entitled
to separate on their DOS with applicable entitlements.
3.3. Release from AGR Assignment.
   3.3.1. AGRs may request early release from their AGR tour based on position realignment,
   personal hardship, retirement or other valid reasons. AGRs must submit a curtailment
   request through their chain of command to the appropriate approval authority as shown in
 18                                                               AFI36-2132 20 MARCH 2012


   Table 3.1 and must be received by AFRC/A1A or AFRC/A1L at least 120 days prior to and
   no more than 365 days before requested DOS.
   3.3.2. AGRs must submit curtailment package using the AGR curtailment worksheet with
   written justification to include any applicable waivers (See Attachment 4). An application
   for reserve assignment must be provided at the time curtailment is requested if member is
   remaining in the selected reserve.
       3.3.2.1. The supervisor and commander or commander equivalent must approve
       curtailment packages and route IAW Table 3.1 prior to forwarding to AFRC/A1A or
       AFRC/A1L.
       3.3.2.2. Curtailment requests for the purpose of retirement must be received by
       AFRC/A1A (AFRC/A1L for colonel positions) no later than 60 days prior to the
       requested permissive TDY/terminal leave start date but not less than 120 days before
       retirement date to allow for processing.        Exceptions to the 60/120-day policy will
       require substantial justification and will be considered on a case-by-case basis and must
       be approved by AFRC/CV.
       3.3.2.3. Tour curtailments that require a Aviator Continuation Pay (ACP) waivers require
       AF/RE approval. TOS waivers and Reserve Service Commitment (RSC) waivers require
       AFRC/CV approval.
       3.3.2.4. For those individuals who request release or curtailment via the ARB, the ARB
       decision will be binding. Decisions to reverse curtailment, separation and retirement
       requests will be based on the needs of the AFR and will be considered by AFRC/CV.
       3.3.2.5. AGRs who have an approved AGR tour curtailment or retirement application
       and who later request to withdraw the curtailment or retirement action, must have
       approval from the original approval authority for the curtailment or retirement action.
           3.3.2.5.1. Senior leadership must consider the status of backfill or other force
           management actions before approving withdrawal of a curtailment or retirement
           request. When a backfill action has been completed, the owning organization must
           ensure placement actions into a valid vacant position within their respective
           organization are possible. Senior leadership should not approve withdraw requests if
           a valid vacancy does not exist within their organization.
       3.3.2.6. AGRs who are assigned to a temporary or short term assignment (2 years or less)
       must request early release from their AGR assignment IAW the procedures of this
       section. Requests for waiver of the 120 day notification period must be approved by
       AFRC/CV.
3.4. Involuntary Curtailment. Commanders considering involuntary curtailment should use
all quality force tools available i.e. referral OPRs/EPRs, LORs, Article 15 etc. prior to initiating
an involuntary curtailment. Depending on the nature of the involuntary curtailment,
commanders should consider discharge in lieu of involuntary curtailment.
   3.4.1. Commanders should initiate a preliminary inquiry with AFRC/A1A (AFRC/A1L for
   colonels) to determine if an involuntary curtailment is appropriate. The commander will
   notify the member, in writing, of the proposed action.
AFI36-2132 20 MARCH 2012                                                                     19


       3.4.1.1. After acknowledging receipt, the member may submit a rebuttal within 15
       calendar days of notification. The rebuttal, along with any supporting documentation,
       must be submitted with the commander’s recommendation to the appropriate approval
       authority (see Table 3.2). A commander’s recommendation should be submitted through
       the appropriate chain of command (Squadron, Wing, NAF, AFRC, as applicable), with a
       legal review, to AFRC/A1A (AFRC/A1L for colonel). AFRC/A1A (AFRC/A1L for
       colonel) will notify the member of an approved curtailment and the member’s appeal
       rights. If member is eligible for Active Duty Sanctuary, refer to AFI 36-2131,
       Administration of Sanctuary in the Air Reserve Components.
       3.4.1.2. Involuntary Curtailment Appeal. An approved curtailment may be appealed to
       the involuntary curtailment appeal authority. Curtailment action will continue while
       pending appeal. If a written request for appeal is not filed, appellate rights will be
       waived.
       3.4.1.3. Appeal memorandums, along with any supporting documentation, shall be
       submitted directly to AFRC/A1A (AFRC/A1L for colonel) for staffing to the appeal
       authority.
       3.4.1.4. AFRC/A1A (AFRC/A1L for colonel) will notify the member of the appeal
       outcome and notify the member’s chain of command of any further processing
       requirements.
3.5. Involuntary Release. Mission realignments, total force initiatives, Base Realignment and
Closure (BRAC), or other force management actions may require involuntary release of an AGR
prior to the tour end-date or DOS. AFRC/A1A (AFRC/A1L for colonel) will manage the
involuntary release process and members will be notified of all actions and requirements
associated with this release. If member is eligible for Sanctuary (retirement), refer to AFI 36-
2131, Administration of Sanctuary in the Air Reserve Components. Members may be eligible for
separation pay based on length of service. See AFI 36-3207, Separating Commissioned Officers
and AFI 36-3208, Administrative Separation of Airmen.
   3.5.1. Involuntary Discharge. Commanders may initiate involuntary discharge actions for
   officers and enlisted personnel IAW AFI 36-3206, Administrative Discharge Procedures for
   Commissioned Officers, and AFI 36-3208, Administrative Separation of Airmen.
3.6. Mandatory Separation Date (MSD). Officers must be separated before or upon reaching
their maximum years of service (IAW 10 U.S.C., §§14505—14509, and AFI 36-3209,
Separation and Retirement Procedures for Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve
Members), unless they have entered Sanctuary.
   3.6.1. For officers that have entered Sanctuary, AFRC/A1A (AFRC/A1L for colonel) will
   notify ARPC of MSD extension requirements and will also adjust the DOS when notified by
   ARPC that the MSD extension is approved. The member’s MSD will be updated to the first
   day of the month after the month in which they reach active duty retirement eligibility (20
   years TAFMS), but not later than age 62.
3.7. High Year Tenure (HYT). Existing AFR HYT will apply to enlisted personnel unless
they have entered Sanctuary IAW AFI 36-2612, United States Air Force Reserve (USAFR)
Reenlistment and Retention Program. AFRC/A1A will adjust the HYT date for enlisted AGRs
who are in Sanctuary when reaching their HYT date. The HYT date will be adjusted until the
 20                                                               AFI36-2132 20 MARCH 2012


first day of the month after the month in which they reach active duty retirement eligibility (20
years TAFMS), but not later than age 60. Waivers beyond HYT for members not in active duty
sanctuary are based on the needs of the AFR.
3.8. AGR Reduction in Force or Requirement Change. AFRC/A1A (AFRC/A1L for
colonel) administers and manages placement programs for AGRs in the event of force
reductions, requirements and/or mission change. AFRC/A1A (AFRC/A1L for colonel) will
assign displaced AGRs to available vacancies, at the same grade (officers only) and AFSC for
which they qualify, in the timeliest manner possible, in coordination with AFRC/CV. AGRs
who are involuntarily separated are authorized separation entitlements IAW with the Joint
Federal Travel Regulations (JFTR) and AFI 36-2115.
   3.8.1. Career AGRs. Placement for career AGRs may take precedence over non-career
   AGRs. Individual preferences will be considered to the maximum extent possible in keeping
   with command mission requirements and availability of vacancies; however, the requirement
   to support the AFR mission is paramount in the placement action.
   3.8.2. Non-Career AGRs. Placement and future utilization of non-career AGRs will be
   dependent on the needs of the AFR. AFRC/A1A (AFRC/A1L for colonel) will review and
   consider all necessary actions to effectively utilize impacted non-career AGRs.
3.9. Retirements – Active Duty. Individuals may apply for an active duty retirement 1 year
prior to completion of at least 20 years of TAFMS. Application for retirement must be submitted
no earlier than 12 months and not later than 4 months prior to the effective date of retirement. If
the member’s DOS is later than the requested retirement date, AGRs must apply for and receive
approval for curtailment of their AGR tour prior to submitting application for retirement.
Members requesting an active duty retirement must serve the required time in grade (TIG) in an
active duty status to be eligible for active duty retirement in highest grade held.
   3.9.1. HQ AGRs. Members will apply for retirement via the virtual MPF (vMPF). AFPC
   will issue retirement orders and process actions to Defense Finance and Accounting Service
   (DFAS). Member and member’s supervisor will notify REP, A1A and/or A1L of application
   for retirement within 15 days of application.
   3.9.2. Unit AGRs. Members will apply for retirement via the virtual Personnel Center -
   Guard and Reserve (vPC-GR) Dashboard on the Air Force Personnel Services (AFPERS)
   website. ARPC will issue retirement orders and process actions to DFAS. Member and
   member’s supervisor will notify A1A and/or A1L of application for retirement within 15
   days of application.
   3.9.3. Officer AGRs with prior enlisted service must have at least 10 years of active duty
   service as a commissioned officer to retire at the commissioned grade IAW AFI 36-3203,
   Service Retirements, Chapter 2.
3.10. Retirements – Reserve. AGRs may apply for a reserve retirement upon completion of 20
satisfactory years total federal military service. Application for reserve retirement is submitted
via the vPC-GR Dashboard on the AFPERS website. If the member’s DOS is later than the
requested retirement date, AGRs must apply for and receive approval for curtailment of their
AGR tour prior to submitting application for retirement. ARPC will issue retirement orders and
process actions to DFAS. Member and member’s supervisor will notify A1A and/or A1L of
application for retirement within 15 days of application.
AFI36-2132 20 MARCH 2012                                                                        21


3.11. Uniformed       Services      Employment      and     Reemployment        Rights Act
(USERRA). Employees who are away from their full time civilian employment (to include
ARTs) to enter into the AGR program or other military active duty have restoration rights
according to the provisions identified in the USERRA of 1994, 38 U.S.C. § 4301 - 4335.
   3.11.1. The Secretary of the Air Force shall determine those periods of active duty
   designated as a critical mission or critical requirement that could be exempt from the 5-year
   cumulative service limit. Voluntary AGR tours do not qualify for this exemption.
   3.11.2. Orders to active duty or orders retaining members on active duty must specify the
   secretarial authority for those orders.
3.12. Promotions. While serving in AGR status, existing AFR promotion policies with the
exceptions listed below will apply to both officer and enlisted personnel. The grades of senior
master sergeant, chief master sergeant, major, lieutenant colonel, and colonel are
Congressionally controlled. Promotion to these controlled grades cannot exceed the annually
established military duty end-strength or grade ceilings.
   3.12.1. Officer AGRs selected for promotion must be the sole occupant of a higher-grade
   UMD position prior to assuming the new grade while serving in AGR status. By law,
   officers not occupying a higher-grade position, or constrained by controlled grade limitation
   may not assume the new grade.
       3.12.1.1. Under these circumstances the promotion is considered involuntarily delayed
       IAW 10 U.S.C., § 14311. If the controlled grade limitation is lifted, or the officer obtains
       a position equal to the higher grade, the officer may assume the higher grade.
       3.12.1.2. Promotions for officers will automatically be delayed until the member
       occupies a higher grade position or the member leaves the AGR program (AFI 36-2504,
       Officer Promotion, Continuation and Selective Early Removal in the Reserve of the Air
       Force). Reserve unit FSMs and AFRC/A1K must coordinate officer promotion
       eligibility and grade ceiling clearance with AFRC/A1A (AFRC/A1L for colonel) prior to
       requesting promotion authorization from ARPC. An AGR promotion letter requesting
       accelerated promotion will be accomplished on an officer selected for promotion to the
       next higher grade and being reassigned to an AGR position of the next higher grade. The
       letter will be accomplished by the gaining commander or director requesting a promotion
       effective date to coincide with the date of assignment to the AGR position. The officer’s
       reassignment and promotion dates will be the same.
   3.12.2. Enlisted AGRs must be fully qualified and may not be promoted above the grade of
   their UMD position. Enlisted AGRs may be promoted effective the 1st day of month
   provided they are eligible and selected. AGRs are not eligible for the Promotion
   Enhancement Program (PEP) or the Extended Promotion Program (EPP).
       3.12.2.1. Process enlisted promotions IAW AFI 36-2502, Airmen Promotion Program,
       Chapter 4. Promotions to SMSgt and CMSgt for all enlisted AGRs must be coordinated
       with AFRC/A1A for grade ceiling clearance prior to processing promotion. Enlisted
       members may not be promoted more than once while in retraining status without
       obtaining the appropriate skill level. SMSgts occupying CMSgt positions will not be
       promoted before completing Chief Leadership Course.
 22                                                             AFI36-2132 20 MARCH 2012


       3.12.2.2. AGRs will incur a 24-month RSC for promotion to MSgt, SMSgt and CMSgt
       IAW AFRCI 36-2102. Individuals will attain the 24-month retainability prior to the
       promotion effective date.
3.13. Reenlistments/Extensions. As directed by the ARB or AFRC/A1A, FSMs are authorized
to reenlist or extend the member to obtain the required retainability regardless of current ETS.
AGRs must submit completed reenlistment or extension paperwork to AFRC/A1A.
3.14. Training and Developmental Education. AGRs are afforded the opportunity to enhance
their military knowledge and career progression IAW AFI 36-2201V2, Air Force Training
Program Training Management. Units will fund training and developmental education which is
not centrally funded through AFRC/A1A, AFRC/A1K, AFRC/A1L or AFRC/A1R (except SDE
and IDE approved courses).
   3.14.1. Skills Training. Individuals must continue to progress in training IAW AFI 36-
   2201V2 to a skill level compatible with their UMD position. If a member fails to
   successfully progress in upgrade training, the individual could be reassigned to a qualifying
   vacant UMD position, involuntarily demoted IAW AFI 36-2503 ( see paragraph 2.3.3), or
   removed from the AGR program.
   3.14.2. Formal Training. Formal training courses listed in the Education and Training
   Course Announcements (ETCA) will be requested when the need for training is mission
   essential. Training requests will be submitted through the assigned organizational training
   monitor using SF 182, Authorization, Agreement, and Certification of Training.
   3.14.3. Training Waivers. AGRs will use the training waiver procedures currently
   prescribed by AFI 36-2201V5, Air Force Training Program Training Management Career
   Field Education and Training, Chapter 4 and AFI 36-2254 Volumes 1,2,3 Reserve Personnel
   Participation, Reserve Personnel Training, and Reserve Personnel Telecommuting/Advanced
   Distributed Learning (ADL) Guidelines respectively.
   3.14.4. Developmental Education (DE). AGRs are afforded the same opportunities for DE
   as other members of the AFR. AGRs may apply for in-residence participation or elect
   completion through distance learning. For additional information on DE opportunities,
   contact AFRC/A1A. AGRs may incur an AFR service commitment IAW AFRCI 36-2102
   upon completion of training.
       3.14.4.1. Members selected for fellowships incur a service commitment IAW DoDI
       1322.06, Fellowships, Scholarships, Training with Industry (TWI), and Grants for DoD
       Personnel.
   3.14.5. Retainability. AGRs will meet appropriate retainability requirements according to
   the ETCA.
3.15. Standards of Conduct. DoD Directive 5500.7-R, Joint Ethics Regulation (JER) and AFI
51-902, Political Activities by Members of the US Air Force, are applicable to AGRs. Personnel
must be briefed annually on these regulations.
3.16. Outside Employment. All AGRs must ensure off-duty employment complies with DoDD
5500.7-R, Joint Ethics Regulation.
3.17. Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). All AGRs fall under the jurisdiction of the
UCMJ.

4.1. AGR Review Board (ARB). The ARB, established by the Chief of Air Force Reserve,
provides AF/RE, AFRC and ARPC staffs, AFRCRS, NAF, RMG, Wing or Group, RSG and unit
Commanders, supervisors and individual AGRs an opportunity to participate in retention
decisions affecting assigned AGR personnel. The chairperson for the ARB is a general officer
and is normally the AFRC/CV. AF/RE may appoint members to serve on the ARB in addition to
membership listed below.
   4.1.1. Vice Commander, Air Force Reserve Command, Chairman.
   4.1.2. Deputy to the Chief of Air Force Reserve.
   4.1.3. Directorate of Personnel, AF/REP.
   4.1.4. Numbered Air Force Commander or designated representative (4AF, 10AF, and
   22AF).
   4.1.5. Commander, Air Reserve Personnel Center.
   4.1.6. Director of Manpower, Personnel and Services, Air Force Reserve Command.
   4.1.7. Commander, Air Force Reserve Command Recruiting Service.
   4.1.8. Commander, Readiness Management Group.
   4.1.9. AFRC Command Chief
   4.1.10. Board Advisor: Chief, AGR Management Office. Non-voting member.
   4.1.11. Board Advisor: Chief, Senior Leader Management Division. Non-voting member.
   4.1.12. Board Recorder: Designated AFRC/A1A Staff member. Non-voting member.
4.2. ARB Procedures. The ARB reviews AGRs for continuation in the AGR program to
include entry into the AGR career program and retention beyond 20 years TAFMS.
   4.2.1. ARB Schedule. ARBs are normally scheduled in March and September of each
   calendar year. The ARB will review AGRs 10 to 15 months prior to their date of separation
   (DOS). For planning purposes, AGRs with a DOS of 1 January through 30 June will meet
   the March ARB, and AGRs with a DOS of 1 July through 31 December will meet the
   September ARB.
   4.2.2. ARB Pre-Board Process. AFRC/A1A will identify AGRs to be reviewed 10-15
   months prior to their DOS. At least three months prior to the scheduled ARB individuals
   will receive an ARB Worksheet, AGR Personnel Brief and ARB Fact Sheet. Individuals
   must complete and return the endorsed ARB Worksheet through their appropriate chain of
   command to reach AFRC/A1A by the assigned suspense date.
   4.2.3. ARB Worksheet Non-Concurrence. Written documentation shall be provided to the
   board for consideration anytime there is non-concurrence in the reviewing chain.
AFI36-2132 20 MARCH 2012                                                                     25


4.3. ARB Decision Criteria. ARB decisions are based on the needs of the AFR. The ARB
considers the individual’s request and leadership recommendations. Leadership should consider
the individual’s total background using the “whole person” concept. This may include training,
work experience, performance reports, awards and decorations, and developmental education.
Each individual’s service history is reviewed to determine the individual’s ability to attain 20
years TAFMS and to determine if the member’s participation in the career program will meet the
needs of the AFR. Continuation is dependent on continued performance, career progression, the
needs of the AFR and career field requirements.
   4.3.1. AGRs who are granted career status will not meet another ARB until 10-15 months
   prior to the 20-year TAFMS date, at which time the ARB will make a decision on
   continuation beyond 20 years TAFMS. AGR assignment lengths that continue an individual
   beyond 20 years TAFMS will be determined by the ARB, not to exceed 2 years from
   member’s current date of separation.
4.4. ARB Post-Board Process. AFRC/A1A publishes formal minutes of the ARB proceedings
and documents board decisions. Memorandums of notification will be prepared and forwarded
to each member and leadership indicating the ARB decision. Normally, notifications will be
provided to each individual within 45 days following the ARB.
4.5. ARB Appeal Process. The final appeal authority for an ARB decision is AF/RE. An AGR
member may appeal an ARB decision by forwarding their request with supporting
documentation to AFRC/A1A for staffing.
   4.5.1. Appeals must be signed and forwarded to the member’s supervisor within 60 days of
   the date on the ARB decision memorandum.
4.5.2. Unit AGRs must have their NAF/CC endorsement, NCR AGRs must have AF/RE(D)
endorsement, and HQ AFRC AGRs must have directorate endorsement.
   4.5.3. Non-concurrence at any level must still be routed to AFRC/A1A (AFRC/A1L for
   colonel) for AF/RE decision.
4.6. Out-of-Cycle ARB. An out-of-cycle ARB may be requested by a member with the
concurrence of their group commander or equivalent if a retention decision is required outside
the normal ARB process. Out-of-cycle approvals are rare and must be properly justified on why
the member should not meet their regularly scheduled ARB.
   4.6.1. Processing Procedures. An out-of-cycle ARB request should be forwarded to
   AFRC/A1A for staffing. AFRC/A1A will staff to AFRC/CV for decision. A notification
   memorandum will be prepared and forwarded to the member and leadership indicating the
   out-of-cycle ARB decision. If the request is denied, the normal appeal process will apply.
