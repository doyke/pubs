This instruction implements AFPD 34-4, Food Service. It provides guidance and procedures for
Appropriated Fund (APF) troop feeding of USAFR enlisted members during periods of
authorized training at locations where government-operated dining facilities are not available or
operating. Troop feeding is designed to enable enlisted 3M0X1 personnel proper amount of time
to train during unit training assemblies (UTAs) by cutting their responsibility of food service
functional support during UTA weekends at APF dining facilities and focusing more on a
training environment. The AFRC concept of providing troop feeding in nonappropriated fund
(NAF) dining facilities, whether Club dining or Community Activity Center (CAC) dining is
designed to save APFs. This saving is realized through eliminating facility construction,
maintenance, repair, and mess attendant costs associated with APF dining facilities that are only
used two days a month (UTA weekend) on Air Force Reserve installations. Troop feeding
problems encountered by AFRC units which are tenants on joint bases or bases operated by other
services will be handled on an individual basis. Start this process by contacting the AFRC
Command Food Service Manager, HQ AFRC/A1SCF, afrc.sv@us.af.mil . Refer recommended
changes, comments, or questions about this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility

1. Authority to Subsist at Government Expense:
     1.1. During periods of inactive duty training, enlisted members are authorized to subsist at
     government expense as outlined in AFI 34-239, Food Service Management Program,
     Attachment 10, note 2.
     1.2. Enlisted members may be subject to collection procedures for the cost of any
     unauthorized meals consumed if they fail to complete a minimum of 8 hours of training
     through no fault of the government.
AFRCI 34-203 14 JUNE 2012                                                                       3


2. Procedures:
   2.1. When available within the geographic area of the training site, use government-operated
   APF dining facilities when feasible.
   2.2. If government-operated facilities are not available and establishment of facilities is not
   feasible, the commander may request authority from HQ AFRC/A1S to use Club or CAC
   dining facilities or may use contract troop feeding if Club or CAC support is not available,
   feasible, or cost effective.
   2.3. When Club or CAC operations are used to provide troop feeding, a Memorandum of
   Agreement (MOA) will be used in lieu of a contract. The MOA must be reviewed annually
   and modified if there are significant changes. Modify the Sample MOA found at Attachment
   2 and modify and attach the Sample Performance Work Statement (PWS) provided at
   Attachment 3. The PWS must be tailored to the needs of the installation and can be used for
   Club, CAC or contractual feeding. The basic requirements of the sample PWS remain as
   specified. When preparing the PWS, follow the instructions in paragraph 3 below.
   2.4. A sample food training guide is provided at Attachment 8. This food service training
   guide is for all enlisted Services personnel authorized and mandated to train within troop
   feeding operations. It is designed to help them remain proficient in food service skill sets as
   outlined in the Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) for all 3M0X1s.
3. Preplanning for Contractual Troop Feeding/PWS.
   3.1. When a determination is made that Club, CAC or contract troop feeding is the most
   feasible option, the commander or authorized representative:
   3.2. Prepares a PWS and sends it through the proper channels on the installation and then
   forwards it to HQ AFRC/A1S (OPR) and AFRC/FM (OCR) for approval at least 90 days
   before implementation. Prepare the PWS in accordance with Attachment 3 and include the
   following information:
      3.2.1. General. Identify agencies involved, reason, and purpose of PWS, renegotiating
      rights, and additional information agreed upon by agencies involved.
      3.2.2. SECTION I: Definitions and References: For the purpose of this section, include
      all pertinent abbreviations and definitions which will apply to this agreement.
      3.2.3. SECTION II: Installation (Supported Unit) Responsibilities.
      3.2.4. SECTION III: Club, CAC or Contractor Responsibilities.
      3.2.5. SECTION IV: Serving Hours and Meal Prices.
      3.2.6. SECTION V: Certifications and invoicing (see sample Invoice at Attachment 6).
      3.2.7. SECTION VI: Other Agreements: (Club or CAC only; not for commercial
      vendor PWS). (Add food proficiency training requirements from Service Career Field
      Education and Training Plan (CFETP) under this section)
      3.2.8. SECTION VII: Minimum Food Requirements.
 4                                                                AFRCI 34-203 14 JUNE 2012


     3.3. Once the PWS is completed, attach it to the Draft MOA and forward a copy of the
     completed package (Draft MOA and PWS) to HQ AFRC/A1S (OPR) and AFRC/FM (OCR)
     for review.
     3.4. In the future, submit the MOA and PWS to HQ AFRC/A1S (OPR) and AFRC/FM
     (OCR) for review annually or after any changes are made to either document.
     3.5. The commander must obtain the lowest cost consistent with acceptable standards. The
     cost proposed by the troop feeding operation must have justification in detail, and be
     submitted to HQ AFRC/A1S (OPR) and AFRC/FM (OCR) for approval. All justification of
     cost will be worked in conjunction with HQ AFRC/A1S (OPR) and AFRC/FM (OCR). A
     sample troop feeding cost analysis can be found in this publication at Attachment 3 (PWS),
     Annex A.
4. Duties/Responsibilities:
     4.1. The commander establishes written local controls to identify personnel authorized to
     subsist at government expense. The duties and responsibilities in this paragraph are designed
     to implement necessary internal controls and are very important. The commander appoints:
        4.1.1. A point of contact (POC) to submit unit training assembly (UTA) troop feeding
        requirements (number of troops to dine at each meal). This individual may not be
        assigned in any capacity to the base Force Support or Prime RIBS organization. Troop
        feeding requirements must be submitted in writing, broken out by date and meal type.
        4.1.2. A Quality Assurance (QA) POC to observe and document troop feeding
        operational performance to ensure the Club, CAC or Contractor meets requirements set
        forth in the MOA and PWS. Individual should also have a working knowledge of food
        safety and sanitation.
        4.1.3. A headcount attendant to identify and obtain signatures on AF Form 79,
        Headcount Record, of all personnel authorized to subsist at government expense and eat
        in the troop feeding facility. Obtain signatures before meals are served. Note: Only
        enlisted personnel are authorized to subsist at government expense; officers and civilians
        must pay the normal meal prices within the business operation (Club/CAC/Contract).
        The Club, CAC or Contractor must provide a cashier. The headcount attendant may only
        be authorized to handle NAF cash assets after they have completed NAF Internal
        Controls training and local NAF cashier training with the Club or CAC manager.
        Individuals must also be properly trained and signed off on Financial Management and
        Protection of Assets training outlined in the Services CFETP.
     4.2. The headcounter:
        4.2.1. Ensures new sheets of AF Form 79 are used for each meal and the forms are
        properly annotated to include the date served and price of the meal. Control of AF Form
        79 must be accomplished according to AFMAN 34-240, Food Service Program
        Management, Chapter 3. See Attachment 7 for AF Form 79 instructions.
        4.2.2. Enters in the appropriate block the total number of meals served and signs AF
        Form 79 as required after each meal period is completed. (Requires the facility manager
        or designated representative sign this form also to indicate agreement that the number of
        meals served is a true count.)

     4.2.3. Draws a line after the last name on the form to indicate the last entry, gives the
     original to the troop feeding manager who will forward copies to the base or the
     designated representative.
  4.3. The Troop Feeding Operation (Club, CAC or Contract):
     4.3.1. Follows all procedures outlined in this publication, local MOA and PWS.
     4.3.2. Follows Troop Feeding Accounting Procedures provided at Attachment 5.
  4.4. The installation FM:
     4.4.1. Certifies and forwards Troop Feeding Invoices to the government purchase card
     (GPC) account holder for payment when GPC is authorized for use to make payment.
     Note: The GPC can be used when a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) has been
     established. GPCs cannot be used to make payment when an MOA is established.
     4.4.2. Settles the account with the troop feeding operation within 2 days and retains
     copies.
     4.4.3. If the GPC cannot be used for payment, forwards the Troop Feeding Invoice and

   PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT (PWS) AIR FORCE RESERVE TROOP
 FEEDING OPERATIONS ANNEX B VARIABLES USED IN TROOP FEEDING COST
             ANALYSIS (CLUB AND CAC OPERATIONS ONLY)

A4.1. This annex lists the necessary components used to estimate costs and pricing associated
with troop feeding Memorandum of Agreements (MOA). Use of these components is required
in order to give the best cost estimate that provides value for the use of APFs and covers all costs
associated with providing food service regardless of the source. The goal of using these
components is to identify per meal cost or price to be billed. For this analysis cost and price are
synonymous as the cost will include compensation for all NAF expenses.
A4.2. The necessary cost components include: Food or Recipe Cost, Labor Cost, Supply Cost,
and Other Costs or Overhead. Supply Cost will consist of supplies related to food preparation.
Overhead is an indirect cost and consist of cost recovery of capital equipment, expendable
equipment or small wares, repair and maintenance costs, other material and supply cost, required
training or professional development cost, NAF Accounting and Human Resource cost, and
compensation for NAF services. Meal cost will be calculated as Food Cost + Labor Cost +
Supply Cost + Overhead = Meal Cost or Price.
A4.3. Non-cost components are also required in the value analysis. These non-cost requirements
include meal card participation rate or number of cardholders eligible, headcount for each meal,
the operating hours, and the number of operating days each month. A list of the number of
people and positions as well as the hours necessary for each position in preparation, serving and
clean up is also needed. These items were previously provided for under mess attendant
contracts. They now become a part of the per meal troop feeding cost.
A4.4. Food cost is determined by use of an inventory system that generates recipe cards for the
required meal service. Recipe cards shall list the ingredients, units required, unit description,
cost per unit, and the extended cost for that ingredient. Recipe cards shall be provided for each
type of meal service including breakfast, lunch, dinner, and any type of box meal service. When
more than one recipe card option is provided then an average recipe cost shall be calculated as
the food cost for that meal type.
A4.5. Labor cost will be direct labor cost and include the hourly rate plus any benefits received.
This is called the benefit rate and will be calculated for each employee directly involved in
preparation, serving and clean up for each meal. The benefit rate for each labor category used
shall be listed to calculate a Daily Labor Cost (DLC). The Regular Benefit Rate (RBR) for
regular category employees will be calculated as follows: list the hourly rates for all regular
employees and multiply this by 1.0 plus the calculated base benefit decimal or percent based on
rates supplied by the AF Services Agency (AFSVA) on an annual basis and applied to each base.
Each base will have a different percentage with the rate for medical insurance being the main
variable. The Flexible Benefit Rate (FBR) is calculated by listing the hourly rate for each
flexible category employee and multiplying it by 1.0 plus the calculated benefit decimal or
percent based on rates supplied by AFSVA on an annual basis and applied to all bases. For
instance in FY12, this FBR percent is 11.54% or .1154 for all flexible AF employees. The RBR
and FBR amounts will be reviewed by the NAFFA annually to insure they are in line with AF
guidance. Changes in these rates shall be coordinated through the HQ AFRC/A1. The DLC
 22                                                              AFRCI 34-203 14 JUNE 2012


will be charged to each meal type based on the number of meals served per type. The percent
will come from the monthly total by type, consisting of breakfast, lunch, dinner, and box meals
divided by the total meals served per month. There will be a DLC or per Meal Labor Rate
(MLR) for each meal type.
A4.6. Supply Cost will be cost of materials and supplies used directly in the preparation, serving
or clean up in meal service. Examples might be rubber gloves used in prep and serving or
cardboard boxes or bags for box lunches. The food service manager will provide a list of items
and the estimated daily cost. The same percents used in the MLR for each meal shall be used to
allocate this cost on a per meal basis. This shall be the Supply Cost Rate (SCR).
A4.7. Overhead will consist of cost recovery of capital equipment, cost recovery of expendable
equipment or small wares, repair and maintenance costs, other material and supply cost, required
training or professional development cost, NAF Accounting and Human Resource Office cost,
and compensation. A list for each individual component with the exception of compensation
will be prepared by the food service manager. Each list shall consist of an item description and a
calculated monthly cost based on its original purchase cost or the monthly estimated cost. The
average number of troop feeding days shall be divided into this monthly cost to get a daily
overhead cost. The same percents used in the MLR for each meal shall be used to allocate this
cost on a per meal basis. Compensation for NAF services will be based on AF NAF guidelines
for a NAFI with food service operations. AF recommends a minimum of 7% Return on
Investment. An amount not to exceed 7% will be added to the calculated cost per meal as
compensation for NAF services.
A4.8. The per meal price shall consist of the sum of the following components: Food or Recipe
Cost per meal, Labor Cost per meal, Supply Cost per meal and Overhead Cost per meal. The per
meal price for each meal type can be multiplied by each annual meal type headcount estimate
and then totaled to get the annual estimated cost for planning purposes. Monthly billings shall be
based on the actual headcounts of enlisted UTA members times the calculated meal prices.
Remember: Troop feeding cost per person will decrease as the number of diners increases.
Commanders at all levels should encourage airmen to eat at the troop feeding facility.
A4.9. A copy of the meal price calculation worksheet will be an attachment to the troop feeding
MOA.
A4.10. The wing/unit’s comptroller will annually review the meal price amount to insure it is
fair and reasonable. Recommended changes and justification shall be coordinated through HQ
AFRC/A1S (OPR) and AFRC/FM (OCR) prior to implementation.

                    TROOP FEEDING ACCOUNTING PROCEDURES

A5.1. PURPOSE: This operating guide outlines the duties and responsibilities that go along
with the troop feeding function of the Club or CAC Dining Facility.
A5.2. SCOPE: This guide applies to all Club or CAC staff, headcount attendant, and troop
feeding cardholder designees.
A5.3. GENERAL: It is essential that Clubs and CACs have an effective procedure for
accounting for daily troop feedings. This guide is a tool for staff to help ensure troop feedings
are properly accounted for during UTAs, Alternate UTAs, and daily rescheduled UTAs.
A5.4. PROCEDURES MEAL TICKETS:
   A5.4.1. On Wednesday prior to main UTA and Alternate UTA, the Installation POC will
   send an estimated headcount to the Club or CAC manager. The wing will be responsible to
   pay for 95% of the estimated headcount if less than the estimated numbers of patrons eat a
   meal. Club/CAC will be paid for all meals if over the original headcount number. Daily
   rescheduled UTA patrons must furnish the Club/CAC cashier with a copy of their AF Form
   40A, Record of Individual Inactive Duty Training, before receiving the meal. The 40As will
   be attached to the AF Form 79, Headcount Record.
   A5.4.2. A headcount attendant will be detailed to ensure all enlisted personnel fed under this
   agreement are properly identified and sign the AF Form 79.
   A5.4.3. The headcount attendant collects signatures of all meal ticket patrons on a controlled
   AF Form 79.
   A5.4.4. At the close of the meal, the headcount attendant completes the AF Form 79 and
   submits to the Club/CAC manager or designated representative for certification that the
   number of meals served is a true count. Club/CAC manager or designated representative will
   determine the total for meals owed taking the 95% rule into account.
   A5.4.5. From the certified AF Form 79, Club/CAC manager will enter the total of meals
   owed into the Aloha system for that day’s business. Sales will be recorded to Cost Center
   XXXX, GLAC 3010000 Sales and the receivable will be recorded to Cost Center XXXX,
   GLAC 1150000 Outside Agency Receivable. Annotate ―troop feeding‖ and the organization.
   If more than one troop feeding and organization, also annotate dollar amount due from each
   organization.
   A5.4.6. Forward the AF Form 79 to the Central Cashier or designated representative for end-
   of-month invoicing purposes.
   A5.4.7. Not later than the third business day following the end-of-month, Business Specialist
   or designated representative will reconcile all AF Form 79s to the GLAC 1150000 amounts
   set up in the General Ledger for each troop feeding organization. Once reconciled, one
   invoice is prepared for each troop feeding organization. Invoice will include a description of
   services rendered, number and type of meals served broken down by breakfast, lunch, dinner
   and/or box meals, cost of the meals and total cost.

  A5.4.8. If payment is to be made by Government Purchase Card (GPC), forward invoice
  with base required troop feeding backup documentation (copies of meal ticket AF Form 79s,
  AF Form 40As, etc.) to the troop feeding cardholder designee. The cardholder, upon
  authorization of the approving official, will make the appropriate payment to the Club/CAC.
  If a BPA is established, the preferred method of payment in a government purchase card
  (GPC). If an MOA is established, request DFAS pay via Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT).
  A5.4.9. If payment is to be made by EFT, the invoice will include EFT information supplied
  by HQ AFRC/A1SR (NAF Accounting Office). Forward the invoice with base required
  troop feeding backup documentation (copies of meal ticket AF Form 79s, AF Forms 40As,
  etc.) to the base Director of Financial Management (FM) or designated representative who
  will verify documentation. Invoice will be submitted to DFAS for payment. Sample invoice
  provided in Attachment 6.
  A5.4.10. Invoice copy with original meal ticket AF Form 79s and AF Form 40As are to be
  retained by CAC Directors for 6.5 years.
A5.5. PROCEDURES CASH TICKETS:
  A5.5.1. If the Aloha system is inaccessible to enter cash patron receipts and sales, the
  Club/CAC will provide a cashier with a change fund to perform these duties. The headcount
  attendant many only be authorized to handle NAF cash assets after they have completed NAF
  Internal Controls training and local NAF cashier training with the Club or CAC manager.
  Individuals must also be properly trained and signed off on Financial Management and
  Protection of Assets training outlined in the Services CFETP.         Club/CAC cashier or
  headcount attendant will count the bank and sign AF Form 1875, NAF Individual Cashier’s
  Report (ICR) (AF Form 1875A and AF Form 1875PG2), verifying receipts of funds.
  A5.5.2. A separate AF Form 79 will be used to record cash receipts.
  A5.5.3. At the close of the meal, the cashier or headcount attendant reconciles the money
  received to the AF Form 79. Cashier or headcount attendant records the money on AF Form
  1875 and submits to the Club/CAC manager or designated representative for verification of
  money to the AF Form 1875 and AF Form 79. Club/CAC Manager or designated
  representative signs the AF Form 1875 and follows normal Aloha procedures for entering
  cash receipts and sales.
  A5.5.4. If the Aloha system is accessible, follow normal Aloha procedures for entering cash
  patron receipts and sales.
  A5.5.5. The cash ticket AF Form 79 will be retained with the Aloha backup documentation.
