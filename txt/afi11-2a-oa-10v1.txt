     combat skills and to practice tactical employment simulating conditions anticipated in the unit
     mission. Provide guidance to ensure only effective RAP missions are logged as RAP lookback
     counters. See Attachment 2 and RAP Tasking memorandum for RAP mission definitions.
     1.2.5.3. Identify the levels and methods of supervision required to accomplish training tasks,
     unless specifically directed.
     1.2.5.4. Ensure adequate continuity and supervision of individual training requirements, experi-
     ence, and proficiencies of all assigned and attached pilots.
     1.2.5.5. Ensure all pilots are adequately prepared and proficient in missions, events, and tasks for
     which they plan to participate, or are being trained for that purpose.
     1.2.5.6. Monitor individual assigned/attached pilot currencies and requirements.
     1.2.5.7. Ensure proper allocation of experiencing, collateral and attrition sorties, and accurate des-
     ignation of non-effective training missions to properly manage the unit flying hour program.
     1.2.5.8. Establish utilization of BMC pilots and determine missions/events in which individual
     BMC pilots will maintain qualification versus familiarization.
     1.2.5.9. Determine which CMR/BMC pilots will carry special capabilities and qualifications.

     1.2.5.11. Assist the wing/group in developing the unit training programs.
     1.2.5.12. Submit a training report to the appropriate MAJCOM/A3T (ANG: ACC/A3G) branch
     periodically during the training cycle as directed. Submit an out-of-cycle report anytime MAJ-
     COM assistance is required to prepare for Designed Operational Capability (DOC) or Air and
     Space Expeditionary Forces (AEF) tasking. ACC units will adhere to the following guidance:
         1.2.5.12.1. Transmit a Training Health Report via e-mail every fourth month of the training
         cycle (end of Jan, May, Sep, and Jan). Reports will summarize the results or unresolved issues
         since the last report, the current training plan, and any significant shortfalls or LIMFACs
         affecting training. Attach a current squadron “training health slide” to summarize critical train-
         ing issues. Complete the report and health slide IAW guidance posted on the ACC/A3TO web-
         site: https://a3.acc.af.mil/DOT/DOTO/Fighter/FighterTeam.asp. Reports will reflect
         different phases of training unique to each AEF pair. Primary reports are the Post-AEF (first
8                                                               AFI11-2A-OA-10V1 31 AUGUST 2006


           month after AEF vulnerable period) and the Pre-AEF (four months prior to AEF vulnerable
           period). Other reports provide snapshots of the squadron’s training health.
           1.2.5.12.2. Report only significant shortfalls or LIMFACs of events/missions that affect 15
           percent or greater of the squadron’s pilot force. Include planned corrective action or specific
           assistance required as appropriate. ACC/A3TO will coordinate to rectify or minimize noted
           shortfalls or LIMFACs while the training cycle is underway.
               1.2.5.12.2.1. Shortfalls occur when required mission training tasks are not accomplished
               due to shortages of equipment, munitions, etc. Example: unable to accomplish actual
               weapons release due to a shortage of training weapons.
               1.2.5.12.2.2. LIMFACS are factors, constraints, restrictions, etc., that degrade training
               effectiveness. Example: squadron's ability to accomplish actual weapons release is limited
               due to the lack of ranges that allow aircraft to drop munitions. This may include supporting
               hardware and software.
           1.2.5.12.3. Summarize and report training requirement deviations, following proration, to
           ACC/A3T (ANG: ACC/A3G) with the Post-AEF RAP Training Health Report IAW (end of
           the first month after AEF vulnerable period) the guidance at the ACC/A3TO website listed
           above. This report will include training requirements waived by the OG/CC. E-mail training
           reports to ACC/A3TO RAP manager at accdoto.rapreporting@langley.af.mil, DSN
           574-8323 (ANG: E-mail training reports to ACC/A3GO at accdog.rapreporting@lan-
           gley.af.mil , DSN 574-4099).
    1.2.6. Individual pilots will:
       1.2.6.1. Provide the gaining unit all available training records to assist in assessing qualifications
       and training requirements.
       1.2.6.2. Complete training requirements and currencies within the guidelines of this instruction to
       adequately prepare for and maintain proficiency in assigned flight-related activities.
       1.2.6.3. Participate only in missions, events and tasks in which they are qualified, current, and
       prepared, or are being trained for that purpose.

1.4. Qualification Training. Training programs are designed to progress pilots from Initial Qualifica-
tion Training (IQT) at a formal training course, to Mission Qualification Training (MQT) at the opera-
tional unit, and finally to Continuation Training (CT) throughout the normal training cycle. The following
is an overview of qualification training:
NOTE: This volume does not use A-10 or OA-10 designations to imply a mission type, since pilots can
fly any mission in either Mission Design Series (MDS). Collectively, the aircraft MDS is referred to as A/
OA-10. Traditionally, the A-10 designation refers to all attack mission types, while the OA-10 designa-
tion is limited to the FAC(A) mission and Air Strike Control (ASC) events.
   1.4.1. IQT provides pilots the basic training necessary to initially qualify in flying duties without
   regard to any specific unit's mission. See Chapter 2. Upon completion of IQT, the pilot attains Basic
   Aircraft Qualification (BAQ) status. BAQ is a prerequisite for all follow-on training, including MQT.
   Except for general officers above the wing level, BAQ is not a long-term qualification status.
   1.4.2. MQT provides pilots the advanced training necessary to qualify in flying duties that directly
   support a unit’s mission. See Chapter 3. Pilots maintain BAQ status until complete with MQT and
   subsequently designated CMR/BMC. The Formal Training Unit (FTU) IP course is equivalent to a
   unit MQT program. Waiver authority for any pilot other than general officers above the wing level to
   remain BAQ for longer than six months is MAJCOM/A3 (ANG: ACC/A3G).
   1.4.3. CT provides pilots the training necessary to maintain flying proficiency and consists of two
   aspects. The first involves pilot training in the basic flying skills necessary to ensure the safe operation
   of the aircraft. The second consists of specific mission-related training required to accomplish the
   unit's assigned missions. See Chapter 4.
   1.4.4. Ready Aircrew Program (RAP) is the CT program designed to focus training on capabilities
   needed to accomplish a unit's core-tasked missions. Following completion of IQT and MQT, units
   will assign pilots to either a CMR position or a BMC position. CMR pilots maintain combat readiness,
   while BMC pilots may require additional training prior to combat. Each MAJCOM will publish a
   RAP Tasking memorandum to establish the CT requirements for all pilots. Post the current RAP
   Tasking memo following this instruction.
       1.4.4.1. Combat Mission Ready (CMR) establishes the minimum training required for pilots to
       qualify and remain proficient in all of the primary missions tasked to their assigned unit and weap-
       ons system. Designate and maintain CMR pilots as follows:
           1.4.4.1.1. All designated combat aircraft (CC-coded) unit active duty API-1 positions, flying
           squadron commander (SQ/CC), and squadron operations officers (SQ/DO) positions are des-
           ignated CMR. Operations group commanders (OG/CCs) may designate other API-6 positions
           not assigned to the flying squadron as CMR. EXCEPTION: If a unit is over-manned, the SQ/
           CC may elect to train the front line of their Unit Manning Document (UMD) API-1s to CMR
           and designate the overage BMC. In this case, priority should be given to inexperienced pilots
           with at least 50 percent, if available, designated CMR. (ANG/AFRC: Any pilot may be desig-
           nated CMR/BMC at OG/CC discretion.)
           1.4.4.1.2. CMR pilots will maintain currency and qualification in all core missions of the fly-
           ing unit to which they are assigned or attached. CMR pilots will maintain currencies that affect
10                                                               AFI11-2A-OA-10V1 31 AUGUST 2006


            CMR status and will accomplish all mission ground training and all core-designated flight
            training. Failure to complete this training or maintain these currencies will result in regression
            to non-CMR (N-CMR) status unless waived by appropriate authority. While N-CMR, pilots
            may participate in missions, including exercise and contingency, in which they are current and
            qualified at the discretion of the SQ/CC.
        1.4.4.2. Basic Mission Capable (BMC) establishes the minimum training required for pilots to
        be familiarized in all, and may be qualified and proficient in some, of the primary missions tasked
        to their assigned unit. Designate and maintain BMC pilots as follows:
            1.4.4.2.1. Active duty non-CMR pilot positions above squadron level are designated BMC.
            BMC positions are assigned to pilots who have a primary job performing wing supervision or
            staff functions that directly support the flying operation. FTU Instructor Pilots (IPs), United
            States Air Force Weapons School (USAFWS) IPs, and operational test pilots are also desig-
            nated BMC IAW paragraph 4.1.5.
            1.4.4.2.2. BMC pilots will maintain familiarization with all unit core missions. They may also
            train for proficiency and qualification in some of those missions. For missions in which BMC
            pilots maintain familiarization only, they must be able to attain proficiency and qualification
            within 30 days. BMC pilots may be required to provide additional sortie generation capability,
            either in lieu of, or in addition to, the personnel assigned to the flying squadrons.
            1.4.4.2.3. BMC pilots will accomplish all mission-related ground training designated by their
            attached SQ/CC. BMC pilots may deploy and participate in any mission for which they are
            proficient and qualified without additional training, as determined by the SQ/CC IAW para-
            graph 1.7.5. Failure to complete required training results in regression to non-BMC (N-BMC)
            status. While N-BMC, the SQ/CC will determine which missions the pilots may perform and
            the supervision required.
        1.4.4.3. N-CMR/N-BMC. Pilots who regress to N-CMR/N-BMC status will accomplish the
        requirements in paragraph 4.6. in a timely manner to regain CMR/BMC status.
        1.4.4.4. Specialized Training. Units will qualify pilots in the special capabilities necessary to
        carry out assigned missions and DOC tasking. Specialized training consists of training programs
        such as Flight Lead Upgrade (FLUG), Instructor Pilot Upgrade (IPUG), Forward Air Controller
        (Airborne) (FAC(A)) upgrade, Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR) upgrade, etc., as well as CT to
        maintain proficiency. Specialized training is accomplished after a pilot is designated CMR/BMC
        and in addition to basic requirements. Unless otherwise specified, pilots in CMR/BMC positions
        may maintain special capabilities and qualifications if they are able to accomplish the additional
        training requirements. See Chapter 6.

1.5. Training Concepts and Policies.
     1.5.1. Units will design pilot training programs to achieve the highest degree of combat readiness
     consistent with flight safety and resource availability. Training must balance pilot capabilities and
     safety with the need for realism against the expected threat. This instruction provides training guide-
     lines and policies for use with operational procedures specified in applicable flying operations publi-
     cations.
     1.5.2. ACC Training Support Squadron (ACC TRSS) will develop and validate training programs as
     tasked by HQ ACC/A3. Other MAJCOMs may submit requests for training support to HQ ACC/A3.
AFI11-2A-OA-10V1 31 AUGUST 2006                                                                        11


   If validated, these requests will be prioritized and tasked to ACC TRSS. Designated test units may
   develop syllabi to upgrade operational test pilots in support of specific test plans. The OG/CC for the
   test unit will be the approval authority for these syllabi and submit them to ACC TRSS for review.
   1.5.3. Unit-developed RAP training missions will emphasize combat skills and scenarios that reflect
   procedures and operations based on employment plans, location, current intelligence, and opposition
   capabilities. Use of procedures and actions applicable to combat scenarios are highly desired, such as
   appropriate use of code words, authentication procedures, combat tactics, safe recovery procedures,
   tactical deception, in-flight reports, threat reactions, and intelligence briefing/debriefing. Tactical
   training should include use of inert and live ordnance, threat simulators, countermeasures, and dissim-
   ilar aircraft to the maximum extent possible.
   1.5.4. In-Flight Supervision.
      1.5.4.1. Unless specifically directed, SQ/CCs determine the level of supervision necessary to
      accomplish the required training. If the mission objectives include introductory tasks or instruc-
      tion to correct previous training discrepancies, then an IP may be required.
      1.5.4.2. IPs and Flight Lead (FL)-qualified squadron supervisors may permit a wingman to lead
      during limited portions of a CT mission, if appropriately briefed. This provision will only be used
      to allow wingmen to practice events in which they are already qualified or to help determine if
      they are ready for FLUG. In either case, the IP/supervisor is responsible for the flight. This para-
      graph does not apply to authorized chase procedures.
      1.5.4.3. FLs may delegate the tactical lead to their wingman for specific tasks or may fly in a
      chase position on their wingman for authorized events. While leading in this capacity, the wing-
      man may make in-flight decisions, but the FL will retain overall authority and responsibility for
      the flight.

1.6. Experienced Pilot Requirements.
   1.6.1. Pilots require a minimum number or flight hours to be considered experienced (EXP) in the air-
   craft IAW AFI 11-412. Inexperienced (INEXP) pilots/aircrew must train at a higher rate to maintain
   currencies and proficiencies. Training tables in this volume and the RAP Tasking memorandum
   define requirements for both EXP and INEXP levels.
   1.6.2. A/OA-10 pilots require one of the following to be considered experienced:
      1.6.2.1. 500 hours Primary Aircraft Inventory (PAI), or
      1.6.2.2. 1,000 hours, of which 300 are PAI, or
      1.6.2.3. 600 fighter hours, of which 200 hrs are PAI, or
      1.6.2.4. Previously fighter experienced and 100 hours PAI.
   1.6.3. Hours are defined as FP/MP/IP/EP. Fighter time is defined as hours logged in aircraft with an
   assigned AFSC of 11FX. OA-10 and AT-38 time are considered fighter hours.
   1.6.4. Simulator Experience. Units will apply hours logged in a simulator accomplishing approved
   training events to experience levels. The RAP Tasking memorandum will provide guidance on
   approved events and logging procedures, if applicable.
12                                                               AFI11-2A-OA-10V1 31 AUGUST 2006


1.7. RAP Training Management.
     1.7.1. The RAP Training cycle is equal in length to the AEF cycle. RAP tasking is aligned with a
     squadron’s specific AEF pair and executed IAW the current A/OA-10 RAP Tasking memorandum. If
     a unit is not assigned to an AEF pair or is assigned to multiple AEF pairs, RAP tasking is aligned to
     the AEF cycle itself. This volume, along with the RAP Tasking memo and MAJCOM supplements,
     will establish the RAP mission requirements for each qualification and experience level. These levels
     form the basis for additional RAP tasking, including requirements for special capabilities, mission
     types, training events, and weapons qualifications.
     1.7.2. The total number of RAP missions for a qualification level is the primary factor for maintaining
     a pilot’s qualification level. Units will follow guidelines for RAP mission types to the maximum
     extent possible, with minor variances authorized. SQ/CCs may use variations in mission types as a
     basis for pilot regression. Qualification in a mission is determined by the SQ/CC considering the
     MAJCOM guidance and the individual pilot’s capabilities.
     1.7.3. Pilots must accomplish a tactical profile or a building block-type mission that supports the
     unit’s expected tasking to receive credit for an effective RAP training mission. Each mission profile
     requires successful completion of a significant portion of the events applicable to that mission type, as
     determined by the SQ/CC and Attachment 2.
     1.7.4. The SQ/CC's first priority should be to train all designated pilots to CMR.
     1.7.5. Progression from BMC to CMR requires the following:
        1.7.5.1. Completion of mission-related ground training, including verification.
        1.7.5.2. Qualification in all core missions and weapons events required at CMR.
        1.7.5.3. Attaining one-month lookback at the higher CMR mission rate.
        1.7.5.4. Confirmation that the progressed pilot can complete the prorated number of mission/
        event requirements remaining at CMR by the end of the training cycle.
        1.7.5.5. SQ/CC certification.
     1.7.6. SQ/CCs will designate pilots to train for and maintain special capabilities or qualifications.
     RAP training requirements for special capabilities are accomplished in addition to baseline CMR/
     BMC requirements, except FL and Mission Commander (MCC) training.
     1.7.7. Wing CMR/BMC pilots will fly the required number of RAP missions. If unable, refer to
     regression procedures, paragraph 4.6.
     1.7.8. End-of-cycle training requirements are based on the pilot’s experience level on the last day of
     the current training cycle.
     1.7.9. Units converting to another MDS may fly pilots in CMR positions at the BMC rate until one
     month prior to the operationally ready date, if CMR rates cannot be supported. CMR pilots will fly at
     a CMR rate for the month prior to initial operational capability (IOC). Active duty wings converting
     to a new MDS are authorized one squadron equivalent of additional API-6s during the conversion
     period, 7/6 for 24/18 or less Primary Aircraft Inventory (PAI). However, total wing staff flying the
     new aircraft shall not exceed total authorized for final conversion equipage.
AFI11-2A-OA-10V1 31 AUGUST 2006                                                                      13


1.8. RAP Training Development.
   1.8.1. RAP mission and event requirements defined in Attachment 2 apply to all CMR/BMC pilots,
   as well as those carrying special capabilities or qualifications, IAW the RAP Tasking memorandum.
   The standard mission requirements at Table 1.1. establish the minimum number of missions per train-
   ing cycle for CMR/BMC levels of training. The RAP Tasking memo takes precedence over this
   instruction and may contain an updated mission requirement or missions not yet incorporated in
   Attachment 2.
   1.8.2. Basic skills or “non-RAP” requirements, such as instrument approaches and Aircraft Handling
   Characteristics (AHC), may be incorporated with or in addition to RAP requirements. These missions
   and events ensure pilots maintain basic aircraft qualification and are published in the RAP Tasking
   memo.
   1.8.3. Experiencing and Collateral sortie requirements must be considered when developing RAP
   training and unit flying hour programs.
      1.8.3.1. Experiencing sorties are additional training sorties necessary to achieve desired profi-
      ciency in optimum time. RAP missions may not provide sufficient hours to experience pilots to
      achieve overall unit experience levels. HQ USAF sets a required number of hours to experience
      pilots and a percentage goal of the unit pilots who should meet these requirements. The definition
      for an experienced pilot is given in paragraph 1.6. and Attachment 2.
      1.8.3.2. Collateral sorties, such as Cost of Business sorties, are not directly related to combat
      employment training but are necessary in day-to-day squadron operations. These include flight
      evaluations, Functional Check Flights (FCF), ferry flights, deployments, air shows, etc. During
      the training cycle, MAJCOMs will allocate a block of sorties to each unit for these purposes.
   1.8.4. Unit flying hour programs are allocated a number of attrition sorties that compensate for
   non-effective training missions. Pilots may log any training mission as non-effective when a major
   portion of valid training for that type of mission cannot be accomplished due to poor weather, air
   aborts, or other unexpected circumstances. In order to allocate the number of attrition sorties accu-
   rately, it is essential that pilots log non-effective sorties appropriately.

1.9. Training Records and Reports.
     1.9.1. Units will maintain pilot records for individual training and flight evaluations IAW:
        1.9.1.1. AFI 11-202V1, Aircrew Training.
        1.9.1.2. AFI 11-202V2, Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program.
        1.9.1.3. AFI 11-401, Aviation Management.
        1.9.1.4. ACCI 11-464, Training Records and Performance Evaluation in Formal Flying Training
        Programs.
     1.9.2. Track the following information for all pilots, as appropriate:
        1.9.2.1. Ground training.
        1.9.2.2. Requirements and accomplishment of individual mission types and events cumulatively
        for the training cycle.
        1.9.2.3. Total RAP missions for one-month and three-month lookback.
        1.9.2.4. Requirements and accomplishment of individual currencies.
        1.9.2.5. Weapons employment records in sufficient detail to document all employment attempts
        and hit percentages in any appropriate database.
     1.9.3. Units will update Aviation Resource Management System (ARMS) “No Date” with either the
     date of the last FTU or USAFWS-equivalent training accomplished, or the unit mission certification
     date.

1.10. Aircraft Mission Tape Recording.
     1.10.1. Pilots will use and assess training aircraft mission tape recordings such as Air Combat Maneu-
     vering Instrumentation (ACMI) and aircraft Digital Video/Audio/Data Recorder (DVADR) tapes on
     all tactical missions. Pilots will review their own tapes with their flight/element member(s).
     1.10.2. Review the following items as applicable: titling, weapons parameters, trigger check, accu-
     racy, fragmentation clearance, identification procedures, adherence to Training Rules (TRs), commu-
     nications procedures and discipline, flight discipline, proper Anti-G Straining Maneuver (AGSM),
     tactical employment, and instrument approaches.

1.11. Pilot Utilization Policy.
     1.11.1. Commanders will ensure wing/group tactical pilots (API-1/6s) fill authorized positions IAW
     UMDs and pilot status is properly designated. The overall objective is for pilots to perform com-
     bat-related duties. For inexperienced pilots in the first year of their initial operational assignment,
     supervisors will limit the non-flying duties to those related to combat activities. Supervisors may
     assign pilots to valid, short-term tasks (escort officer, Flight Evaluation Board, Safety Investigation
     Board, etc.), but must continually weigh the factors involved, such as level of pilot tasking, flying pro-
     ficiency, currency, and experience.
     1.11.2. Squadron duties defined in various publications that may be assigned to CAF API-1 pilots are
     weapons and tactics officer, scheduler/programmer, Flight Safety Officer (FSO), Supervisor of Flying
     (SOF), mobility/contingency plans, training (except ARMS documentation), life support officer,
AFI11-2A-OA-10V1 31 AUGUST 2006                                                                        15


   Standardization/Evaluation Liaison Officer (SELO), electronic combat officer, and other duties
   directly related to flying operations. In some instances, such as squadron-assigned FSOs, API-1 pilots
   may be attached to the wing. API-1 pilots will not be attached to or man any wing staff position unless
   total wing pilot API-1 manning is over 100 percent.
   1.11.3. Commanders will ensure API-6 pilots on the wing staff perform duties justified in MAJCOM
   manpower standards documents and authorized in UMDs.

1.12. Sortie Allocation and Unit Manning Guidance.
   1.12.1. Sortie Allocation. In general, inexperienced API-1 pilots should receive sortie allocation pri-
   ority over experienced pilots. Priorities for sortie allocation are as follows:
      1.12.1.1. Operational Units. CMR API-1, MQT API-1, CMR API-6, MQT API-6, and BMC.
      1.12.1.2. FTUs and USAFWS. Formal syllabus training, IP upgrade, IP CT, authorized staff per-
      sonnel not performing IP or Flight Examiner (FE) duties.
      1.12.1.3. Test and Test Evaluation Squadron (TES) Units. Requirements directed by MAJ-
      COM, training required to prepare for assigned projects/tasking, and BMC training requirements
      that cannot be accomplished on primary missions.
   1.12.2. Wing API-6 authorizations are IAW UMDs.
   1.12.3. For wings consisting of both FTU (TF-coded) and CC-coded units, at least one of the follow-
   ing aircrew will maintain FTU IP status: wing commander (WG/CC), wing vice commander (WG/
   CV), OG/CC, operations group deputy commander (OG/CD).
   1.12.4. API-8 rated personnel flying authorizations, ACC/IGS inspectors in API-6 billets, and
   CB-coded pilot authorizations will be IAW AFI 11-401 and MAJCOM guidance. API-8 pilots should
   fly the BMC rate; however, they are not required to complete BMC-specific missions/events or meet
   monthly lookback requirements. CB-coded pilots will fly the BMC rate as a minimum to meet
   monthly lookback. Units should provide assigned API-6/8 flyers adequate resources to maintain min-
   imum training requirements. However, support for API-6 pilots will not limit the flying squadron's
   primary mission. API-6 flyers will accomplish non-RAP requirements with allotted BMC missions.
   API-8 and ACC/IGS pilots will strive to accomplish non-RAP requirements with allotted BMC mis-
   sions. If attached units cannot meet attached pilot requirements, they must request relief IAW AFI
   11-401, as supplemented. Units requiring flying hour adjustments for attached API-8 and applicable
   API-6 flyers must request program changes IAW MAJCOM directives.
   1.12.5. Maximum Sorties. There is no maximum sortie requirement for CMR pilots (ANG: N/A).
   Table 1.2. defines the minimum requirements and maximum allowance for non-API-1 pilots. Unique
   operations may occasionally require pilots to fly more than the maximum number of sorties autho-
   rized. Units must attempt to minimize the training impact this may have on other pilots.
   1.12.6. Pilots assigned or attached to ACC/IGS as API-6 will maintain RAP currencies/lookback per
   API-8 guidance.

                               INITIAL QUALIFICATION TRAINING


2.1. General. This chapter outlines Initial Qualification Training (IQT) of pilots into unit aircraft.
   2.1.1. Formal Training. IQT includes Initial Qualification (IQ) training, Transition (TX), and Senior
   Officer Course (SOC) training, which will be conducted during formal syllabus courses at FTU
   squadrons whenever possible. Graduates of IQT will be proficient in mission tasks as indicated by the
   Course Training Standards (CTS) and Required Proficiency Levels (RPL) of the FTU syllabi. As a
   minimum, IQT will provide the following training certifications and/or qualifications: Air Combat
   Training (ACBT), Low Altitude Step-Down Training (LASDT) Category I, Air Refueling (AR),
   Night Air Refueling (NAR), Night Vision Goggles (NVG), and primary Weapons Delivery (WD)
   employment events.
   2.1.2. Local Training. In exceptional circumstances when FTU training is not available within a rea-
   sonable time period, or if required training qualifications remain unaccomplished, local IQT may be
   conducted at the unit IAW the provisions of this chapter. When local IQT is authorized, the gaining
   MAJCOM assumes responsibility for the burden of providing this training. Local IQT will be devel-
   oped and conducted using the appropriate formal course syllabus track, flow program, requirement,
   and CTS/RPL.

2.2. Approval and Waiver for Local IQT.
   2.2.1. Gaining MAJCOM/A3 (ANG: NGB/A3T) is approval authority to conduct local IQT. Info HQ
   ACC/A3T.
   2.2.2. Gaining MAJCOM/A3 (ANG: ACC/A3G) is waiver authority to change the requirements of
   the formal course syllabus for local IQT. Coordinate changes through HQ ACC/A3T.
   2.2.3. Gaining MAJCOM/CC (ANG: ACC/CG) is the approval authority for local IQT for colo-
   nel-selects and above to be conducted at the unit to which the officer is assigned.
   2.2.4. Requests to conduct local IQT will include the following:
       2.2.4.1. Justification for the local training in lieu of FTU training.
       2.2.4.2. Summary of individual's flying experience.
       2.2.4.3. Date training will begin and expected completion date.
       2.2.4.4. Requested exceptions to formal course syllabus, with rationale.

2.3. Prerequisites. Course prerequisites will be IAW the appropriate formal course syllabus and USAF
Education and Training Course Announcements (ETCA).

2.4. Ground Training. Ground training may be tailored to the individual's background and experience
or to peculiar local conditions. Incorporate available and current reference materials such as AFTTP 3-3,
Combat Aircraft Fundamentals, instructor guides, and audiovisual programs as supporting materials to
the maximum extent possible.

2.5. Flying Training.
     2.5.1. Mission sequence and prerequisites will be IAW the appropriate formal course syllabus.
     2.5.2. Training will be completed within the time specified by the syllabus, as approved. Failure to
     complete within the specified time limit requires notification through channels to MAJCOM/A3
     (ANG: ACC/A3G) with pilot's name, rank, reason for delay, planned actions, and estimated comple-
     tion date.
     2.5.3. Successful completion of IQT requires the Upgrade Pilot (UP) to complete an aircraft Instru-
     ment/Qualification evaluation IAW AFI 11-202V2 (AFI 11-2A/OA-10V2).
     2.5.4. UPs in IQT will fly under IP supervision until completing the qualification evaluation.
     2.5.5. Formal course syllabus mission objectives and mission tasks are minimum requirements for
     IQT. The SQ/CC may authorize additional training events to the IQT program based on UP profi-
     ciency and background. Additional training due to UP non-progression is available within the con-
     straints of the formal course syllabus and may also be added at the discretion of the SQ/CC.

2.6. IQT for Senior Officers.
     2.6.1. All formal training courses for senior officers (colonel-selects and above) will be conducted at
     FTUs unless waived IAW paragraph 2.2.
     2.6.2. Senior officers must meet course entry prerequisites and will complete all syllabus require-
     ments unless waived IAW the syllabus and paragraph 2.2.
     2.6.3. If a senior officer must be trained at the base to which assigned, the officer will be in formal
     training status. Unit duties will be turned over to appropriate deputies or vice commanders until train-
     ing is completed. Exceptions to this policy must be approved by the gaining MAJCOM/CC (ANG:
     ACC/CG).

                              MISSION QUALIFICATION TRAINING


3.1. General. Mission Qualification Training (MQT) is a unit-developed training program to upgrade
newly assigned pilots to CMR or BMC. The local program will incorporate profiles typical of squadron
tasking and ensure pilots are prepared to accomplish the primary unit mission. Applicable portions of
MQT will also be used to requalify pilots who have regressed from CMR/BMC and to specifically
address deficiencies that caused regression.
   3.1.1. The SQ/CC will develop and maintain responsibility for the local MQT program IAW the guid-
   ance in this chapter. SQ/CCs may tailor their program for individual pilots, based on current qualifi-
   cation, experience, currency, documented performance, and formal training.
   3.1.2. Prior to CMR/BMC certification, pilots must qualify (QUAL) in all required Weapons Deliv-
   ery (WD) employment events and will complete any unaccomplished task from IQT.
   3.1.3. MQT will be completed within 90 calendar days (ANG/AFRC: 120 calendar days). Timing
   starts from the pilot's first duty day at the gaining operational unit. If a pilot elects to take authorized
   leave prior to entering MQT, the timing will begin after the termination of the pilot's leave. Training
   is complete upon SQ/CC certification to CMR/BMC. If training exceeds the specified limit, units will
   notify MAJCOM/A3 of the planned corrective action (ANG: ACC/A3G).
   3.1.4. Air Refueling (AR) and initial Aircrew Chemical Defense Training (ACDT) will be accom-
   plished NLT 90 days (ANG/AFRC: 180 days) from completion of MQT. Failure to comply will result
   in regression to N-CMR/N-BMC until training is complete. AR accomplished in IQT and ACDT
   accomplished in a previous assignment may fulfill MQT requirements as determined by the SQ/CC.
   3.1.5. Pilots in MQT will not fly in Flag-level exercises, Weapons System Evaluation Program
   (WSEP), or accomplish any specialized training defined in Chapter 6.
   3.1.6. During academic and flying training, special emphasis will be placed on Aircraft Handling
   Characteristics (AHC), Basic Fighter Maneuvers (BFM), transition to instruments, spatial disorienta-
   tion, task saturation, and conditions leading to and the effects of G-induced Loss of Consciousness
   (GLOC). Maximum use of mission tapes and captive missiles is encouraged on all MQT missions.

3.2. Ground Training.
   3.2.1. Units will develop blocks of instruction covering areas pertinent to their missions as deter-
   mined by the SQ/CC. Incorporate weapons and tactics academic training described in paragraph 4.2.3.
   Units may credit ground training accomplished during IQT towards this requirement.
   3.2.2. Pilots transferring from another MAJCOM require the theater-specific portions of the Instru-
   ment Refresher Course (IRC) before flying without a theater-experienced pilot in the formation. MQT
   academics and the Local Area Orientation (LAO) mission in paragraph 3.4.6.1. may satisfy this
   requirement.
   3.2.3. Initial Verification.
       3.2.3.1. CMR pilots will demonstrate satisfactory knowledge of the squadron’s assigned mission
       to a formal board established by the SQ/CC. Desired board composition is SQ/CC/DO (chairman),
20                                                              AFI11-2A-OA-10V1 31 AUGUST 2006


        weapons officer, electronic combat officer, intelligence officer, and plans representative. Sug-
        gested verification briefing guides are at Attachment 3.
        3.2.3.2. CMR pilots will complete an initial verification within 90 days (ANG: 180 days) after
        completing MQT. Failure to comply will result in regression to N-CMR until the verification is
        complete.
        3.2.3.3. At the discretion of the SQ/CC, BMC pilots may accomplish an initial verification and/or
        participate in CT verifications to facilitate future upgrade to CMR status.

3.3. Simulator Training. Conduct MQT simulator training in a Full Mission Trainer (FMT) to the max-
imum extent possible. If not available, the OG/CC may authorize FMT missions in the best-available
ground-training device. Each mission will include selected Emergency Procedures (EPs) and either
unusual attitude recoveries, spatial disorientation recognition, or inadvertent weather entry procedures. At
the SQ/CC’s discretion, FMT missions and specific tasks may be combined or reorganized based on FMT
availability and flight scheduling. Each FMT task is a prerequisite for the corresponding MQT flight
event.
     3.3.1. FMT-1. LAO, Instruments, EPs. Mission Objectives: Practice basic AFTTP 3-3 fundamentals
     of airmanship, local area flying, and aircraft systems operation. Specific Mission Tasks: Ground oper-
     ations, standard departures/arrivals, local airspace/MOA navigation, emergency airfield procedures
     and approaches, published penetration/approaches to primary alternates and home base, divert proce-
     dures, and EPs.
     3.3.2. FMT-2. Basic Surface Attack (BSA), Maverick, AR. Mission Objectives: Practice BSA deliv-
     ery patterns, Maverick operations, and AR procedures. Specific Mission Tasks: Standard departure,
     weapons checks, Low Altitude Tactical Navigation (LATN), range operations, normal and degraded
     WD, medium/low altitude Maverick deliveries, weapons EPs, AR procedures and malfunctions.
     3.3.3. FMT-3. Surface Attack Tactical (SAT). Mission Objectives: Practice tactical WD, CAS proce-
     dures, and threat reactions. Specific Mission Tasks: Tactical departures/arrivals, weapons checks,
     min-risk routing, threat recognition/avoidance, mutual support responsibilities, tactical WD in a CAS
     scenario, and wounded bird/battle damage procedures.
     3.3.4. FMT-4. ACDE. Mission Objectives: Introduce operations in full ACDE gear (anti-exposure
     suit liner may be substituted). Specific Mission Tasks: ACDE donning, ground operations, departure,
     weapons checks, WD, doffing simulated contaminated ACDE. NOTE: Pilots will accomplish this
     mission once in a career for each MDS prior to the first ACDE flight.

3.4. Flying Training.
     3.4.1. Supervision. Unless specified otherwise, an IP or FL-qualified squadron supervisor is required
     in the element with the UP. The SQ/CC will determine the proper flight position of the IP/supervisor.
     On some mission profiles, more specific or restrictive guidance is provided.
     3.4.2. Breaks in training. If more than 14 calendar days elapse between MQT sorties, pilots will fly
     an additional review sortie before continuing in the program. The SQ/CC may substitute an FMT mis-
     sion for a required review sortie if in the best interest of the pilot’s progress through MQT.
     3.4.3. EP Training. All pilots must conduct practice in-flight EP training during at least one of the
     MQT sorties. As a minimum, the training will consist of briefing, flying, and debriefing a simulated
AFI11-2A-OA-10V1 31 AUGUST 2006                                                                       21


  critical action procedures scenario, to include airborne coordination with the SOF. An actual EP may
  fulfill this requirement.
  3.4.4. Air Combat Training (ACBT) Missions. These missions will provide ACBT qualification if
  not accomplished in IQT. Pilots who have lost ACBT currency will use ACBT mission profiles to
  regain currency (see Table 4.1. and paragraph 4.5.6., ACBT Recurrency). Conduct ACBT upgrades
  IAW Air-to-Air (A/A) training specified in AFI 11-214 and applicable flying directive publications.
  Units will train all pilots in offensive and defensive BFM in preparation for defensive fixed wing
  ACBT and offensive/defensive anti-helicopter ACBT. At a minimum, pilots will train for successful
  A/A self-defense at a goal of 50 percent against dissimilar aircraft or helicopters.
     3.4.4.1. AHC. Mission Objectives: Practice basic aircraft handling skills. Specific Mission

3.5. Initial Aircrew Chemical Defense Training (ACDT). This training will provide certification in
the use of Aircrew Chemical Defense Ensemble (ACDE) and familiarization with combat capabilities
while wearing ACDE. This training is intended to integrate pilot training with other functional areas
(maintenance, intelligence, security, etc.) required to conduct combat operations in a chemical environ-
ment and is applicable to all CMR/BMC pilots assigned or deployable to chemical threat areas. Accom-
plish ACDT IAW AFI 11-301, applicable flying directive publications, and paragraph 3.1.4.
   3.5.1. ACDE Ground Training. Units will develop local training in the following areas:

                                                Chapter 4

                                    CONTINUATION TRAINING

4.1. General. This chapter, along with the current A/OA-10 RAP Tasking memorandum, outlines Con-
tinuation Training (CT) requirements for BAQ, BMC, and CMR pilots. Pilots must maintain the appropri-
ate qualification IAW AFI 11-401 and AFI 11-202V2 (AFI 11-2A/OA-10V2). During CT, pilots will
update all applicable ground and flying currencies IAW AFI 11-202V1, this volume, and other ancillary
training publications. Training terms and mission/event definitions referenced throughout this chapter are
found in Attachment 1 and Attachment 2 respectively. Units will track completed training and monitor
unaccomplished training using ARMS. General requirements for pilots in each category and special capa-
bility are as follows:
     4.1.1. BAQ Requirements.
        4.1.1.1. Completion of IQT.
        4.1.1.2. Qualification (QUAL) Evaluation IAW AFI 11-202V2 (AFI 11-2A/OA-10V2). This
        evaluation is accomplished in conjunction with the Instrument (INSTM) Evaluation.
        4.1.1.3. Sortie rate as required to accomplish basic skills (“non-RAP”) requirements. If a BAQ
        pilot does not fly for 21 days (inexperienced) or 30 days (experienced), the next sortie must be
        flown with an IP/supervisor.
        4.1.1.4. Fly a supervised sortie with an IP/supervisor at least once every 60 calendar days.
        4.1.1.5. Pilots in BAQ status for more than six months will be grounded unless enrolled in a pro-
        gram to achieve CMR/BMC or waived IAW paragraph 1.4.2. This does not apply to general offic-
        ers above wing level.
     4.1.2. BMC Requirements.
        4.1.2.1. Completion of MQT, or either the FTU IP or test pilot upgrade.
        4.1.2.2. Mission (MSN) Evaluation IAW AFI 11-202V2 (AFI 11-2A/OA-10V2).
        4.1.2.3. LASDT CAT I certification.
        4.1.2.4. RAP training IAW this chapter and the RAP Tasking memo.
        4.1.2.5. Sortie rate and lookback IAW Table 1.1.
        4.1.2.6. FTU IPs and test pilots IAW paragraph 4.1.5.

     4.1.3. CMR Requirements.
        4.1.3.1. Completion of MQT and SQ/CC certification.
        4.1.3.2. Mission (MSN) Evaluation IAW AFI 11-202V2 (AFI 11-2A/OA-10V2).
        4.1.3.3. LASDT CAT I certification.
        4.1.3.4. RAP training IAW this chapter and the RAP Tasking memo.
        4.1.3.5. Sortie rate and lookback IAW Table 1.1.
AFI11-2A-OA-10V1 31 AUGUST 2006                                                                              25


   4.1.4. Special Capabilities Requirements.
       4.1.4.1. Completion of specialized training IAW Chapter 6 and guiding syllabi.
       4.1.4.2. RAP training IAW this chapter and the RAP Tasking memo.
       4.1.4.3. Failure to accomplish the requirements will result in loss of certification/qualification.
       4.1.4.4. Recertification and requalification IAW paragraph 4.5. and Chapter 6.
   4.1.5. Special Unit Requirements. This paragraph applies to Designated Training (TF-coded) and
   Designated Test (CB-coded) Aircraft Units.
       4.1.5.1. API-1/6 aircrew assigned or attached to TF/CB-coded units will fly at the BMC rate and
       accomplish the applicable basic skills (“non-RAP”) requirements as shown in the RAP Tasking
       memo. Formal training syllabus-directed missions and approved test plan missions apply to the
       BMC rate requirement.
       4.1.5.2. IPs must be current and qualified in all events they instruct. Failure to complete a RAP
       requirement will not affect IP status, but will require additional training as determined by the SQ/
       CC prior to instructing that event. For CB-coded units, SQ/CCs may designate IPs as initial cadre
       to instruct new events under an approved test plan.
       4.1.5.3. Ground Training. SQ/CCs will direct additional ground training as necessary to accom-
       plish special unit requirements, such as IP phase briefings and test preparation.
       4.1.5.4. Flying Training. SQ/CCs will direct additional sorties if syllabus-directed or test missions
       provide insufficient pilot proficiency training. In this case, pilots will log insufficient training sor-
       ties as collateral sorties and not credit their monthly RAP lookback.
       4.1.5.5. For United States Air Force Air Warfare Center (USAFAWC) and United States Air
       Force Weapons Test Center (USAFWTC) pilots, night flying and AR events are only required to
       meet syllabus or program requirements.

4.2. Ground Training. Pilots will accomplish ground training IAW the table in the RAP Tasking memo.
The table is a single-source reference for MDS-specific ground training only and does not include
non-MDS-specific ancillary training. Waiver authority for each event is IAW the specified reference
directive. Where discrepancies exist, the reference directive takes precedence. Units may credit ground
training accomplished during IQT/MQT toward CT requirements for the training cycle in which it was
accomplished.
   4.2.1. Simulator (SIM). The RAP Tasking memo depicts the SIM CT requirements that pilots will
   accomplish in an FMT. If an FMT is not available, the OG/CC may authorize SIM missions in the
   best-available ground-training device. Inexperienced pilots have priority over experienced pilots in
   the FMT when availability is limited. SQ/CCs will determine the required supervision for SIM mis-
   sions based on SIM capabilities and mission training objectives. Units will develop scenarios that
   cover both EP and Tactical (TAC) SIM missions based on expected employment tasking and general
   systems knowledge requirements. Place emphasis on training not readily attainable during daily flying
   activities. Units will review scenarios each training cycle and update as required. Pilots may receive
   credit for training accomplished in special SIM devices or HHQ-directed simulator test support, if
   approved by the SQ/CC.
26                                                               AFI11-2A-OA-10V1 31 AUGUST 2006


        4.2.1.1. EP SIM. Mission Objectives: Practice in-flight EPs and maintain proficiency in applying
        aircraft general knowledge to abnormal situations. Specific Mission Tasks: Unusual attitude
        recoveries, spatial disorientation, inadvertent weather entry, controlled flight departure recogni-
        tion and recovery procedures, controlled and uncontrolled ejection parameters, all boldface proce-
        dures, aircraft subsystem failure checklist procedures, in-flight EPs, and precision instrument
        procedures. NOTE: Pilots may satisfy EP SIM requirements by accomplishing or administering
        INSTM/QUAL EP Evaluations (EPEs) or formal course EP FMTs.
        4.2.1.2. TAC SIM. Mission Objectives: Practice in-flight malfunctions and maintain proficiency
        in applying tactical knowledge to combat scenarios. Specific Mission Tasks: DOC-relevant simu-
        lated combat employment, threat recognition, threat reactions and counter tactics, weapons mal-
        function checklist procedures, relevant boldface and aircraft subsystem failure procedures, battle
        damage and wounded bird procedures, controllability and structural damage checklists, controlled
        and uncontrolled ejection parameters. NOTE: Pilots may satisfy TAC SIM requirements by
        accomplishing or administering MSN EPEs.
     4.2.2. Situational Emergency Procedures Training (SEPT).
        4.2.2.1. This monthly EP training will provide a review of abnormal and emergency procedures
        and aircraft systems operations/limitations during realistic scenarios. One pilot will present a situ-
        ation while another discusses actions necessary to cope with the malfunction and carry it to a log-
        ical conclusion. Squadrons will incorporate the following elements into SEPT programs:
           4.2.2.1.1. Emphasize boldface procedures and Special Interest Items (SIIs).
           4.2.2.1.2. Develop SEPT scenarios using actual mishaps and incidents as baseline cases.
           4.2.2.1.3. Include one EP per phase of flight and/or major aircraft subsystem (hydraulic, elec-
           trical, fuel, engine, flight control, and auxiliary power, as applicable) during each session.
           4.2.2.1.4. Include periodic training on the aircraft stall warning and slat system (normal and
           abnormal operations), NVG contingencies, minimum fuel/emergency divert situations.
           4.2.2.1.5. SQ/CCs will approve monthly SEPT scenarios, topics, and SIIs.
           4.2.2.1.6. Accomplish two SEPTs each training cycle with an IP/supervisor. These supervised
           SEPTs, however, are not intended to be evaluations.
        4.2.2.2. Pilots will accomplish a SEPT in each calendar month. Currency will expire at the end of
        the calendar month following the one in which the SEPT was credited, regardless of which date
        the SEPT was completed. Failure to maintain currency will result in grounding until subsequently
        completed. SQ/CCs may waive unaccomplished SEPTs from previous months due to non-flying
        TDYs or special circumstances.
        4.2.2.3. SEPTs will be accomplished in the best-available simulator. If a simulator is not avail-
        able, SEPTs may be accomplished table-top one-on-one or in small flight-sized groups, as long as
        all members participate fully and share equal time responding to emergency situations.
        4.2.2.4. Pilots may satisfy their monthly SEPT requirement by accomplishing or administering an
        EP SIM, an EPE, or formal course EP training.
AFI11-2A-OA-10V1 31 AUGUST 2006                                                                          27


   4.2.3. Weapons and Tactics Academics. Units will establish a weapons and tactics academic pro-
   gram to accomplish both MQT and CT requirements. Academics are required IAW the ground train-
   ing table in the RAP Tasking memo.
      4.2.3.1. Academic instructors should be USAFWS graduates, or have attended the applicable aca-
      demic portion(s) of the course, to the maximum extent possible. Audio-visual programs may be
      used in place of academic instruction.
      4.2.3.2. To complete academics, pilots must pass an examination with a minimum score of 85
      percent. Pilots may receive training credit in lieu of academics if an exam is passed and corrected
      to 100 percent, where authorized by the governing publication.
      4.2.3.3. Academics and exams will include the following:
          4.2.3.3.1. Weapons description, operation, parameters, fusing, limitations, preflight, tactics,
          normal/emergency procedures/techniques, for all weapons applicable to the unit’s mission.
          4.2.3.3.2. A/A principles including aerodynamics, maneuverability, formations, AHC,
          AGSM, signature management, flow priorities, tactical intercept principles, alert procedures
          and scrambles, use of GCI/AWACS, and enemy capabilities.
          4.2.3.3.3. Electronic combat equipment, capabilities, operation, checks, procedures, infrared
          (IR) and Radar Missile Defense (RMD), countermeasures, and hostile Electronic Warfare
          (EW) tactics.
          4.2.3.3.4. Specialized training to support specific weapons, tactics, mission capabilities, threat
          identification, authentication, wartime ROE, and safe passage.
          4.2.3.3.5. Low altitude academics review IAW LASDT ground training, paragraph 6.8.6.
   4.2.4. Verification.
      4.2.4.1. Units will conduct periodic verifications to update pilots on the wartime mission IAW the
      ground training table in the RAP Tasking memo. Desired board composition is SQ/CC/DO (chair-
      man), weapons officer, electronic combat officer, intelligence officer, and plans representative.
      Attachment 3 contains suggested briefing guides for verifications.
      4.2.4.2. Each CMR pilot will participate in a verification as a briefer, board member, or audience
      member. SQ/CCs should encourage BMC/BAQ pilots to participate in verifications to the maxi-
      mum extent practical.
      4.2.4.3. At the discretion of the SQ/CC, pilots who have deployed in support of unit tasking may
      receive credit for CT verification.

4.3. Multiple Qualification and Currency.
   4.3.1. Commanders must not permit pilots who are qualified in primary mission aircraft to maintain
   qualification in support aircraft, unless required for unit mission accomplishment.
   4.3.2. MAJCOM/A3 (ANG: NGB/A3) may authorize pilot qualification in more than one MDS only
   when such action is directed by command mission requirements and is fiscally justifiable. MAJCOM/
   A3s will not delegate this authority to a lower level. The A-10 and OA-10 MDS designations do not
   require multiple qualification approval and are known collectively as the A/OA-10 MDS.
28                                                               AFI11-2A-OA-10V1 31 AUGUST 2006


NOTE: This volume does not use A-10 or OA-10 designations to imply a mission type, since pilots can
fly any mission in either MDS. Traditionally, the A-10 designation refers to all attack mission types,
while the OA-10 designation is limited to the FAC(A) mission and ASC events.
        4.3.2.1. Submit multiple qualification requests with full justification through command channels
        to MAJCOM/A3 (ANG: NGB/A3). Approval for multiple qualifications must be provided to the
        appropriate host base flight management office. Pilots will not accomplish flights in more than
        one MDS until aircraft assignments are approved and updated in ARMS.
        4.3.2.2. Multiple qualifications are valid as long as the pilot is assigned to the specific position
        and aircraft designated, or until rescinded by the approval authority.
     4.3.3. Multiple qualification is authorized for pilots participating in the Companion Trainer Program
     (CTP) or maintaining tactical aircraft qualification in the applicable companion trainer/chase aircraft.
     Pilots assigned to these positions are preauthorized and need not submit approval requests.
     4.3.4. For senior wing leadership of units with different aircraft types, multiple qualification is not
     appropriate. The WG/CC will qualify in only one type of aircraft in the wing, while either the WG/CV
     or the OG/CC will qualify in a different wing aircraft.
     4.3.5. Multiple Requirements. Pilots will satisfy at least 50 percent of the mission requirements of
     their primary aircraft in that aircraft. CMR pilots will accomplish all RAP requirements for their pri-
     mary aircraft. In addition, pilots will fly an equitable distribution of emergency patterns, instrument
     sorties, penetrations, non-precision approaches, and precision approaches in each MDS to fill their
     non-RAP requirements.
     4.3.6. Multiple Currencies. Pilots will fly at least once every 45 days in each aircraft. They will
     comply with all other currency requirements for each aircraft.
     4.3.7. Pilots must complete transition or conversion training IAW the approved syllabus.

4.4. Basic Skills Training Requirements. A/OA-10 pilots will accomplish basic skills (“non-RAP”)
training requirements during the unit training cycle IAW the RAP Tasking memo. Failure to accomplish
requirements will not affect BAQ, BMC, or CMR status, but may require additional training as deter-
mined by the SQ/CC. If any mission or event is subsequently converted to a RAP requirement in the RAP
Tasking memo, failing to accomplish that requirement may affect CMR/BMC status, as designated.

4.5. Currencies, Recurrencies and Requalification.
     4.5.1. Currency. Table 4.1. defines currency requirements for all A/OA-10 pilots. If a pilot loses a
     particular currency, that mission or event will not be performed except for the purpose of regaining
     currency with the designated supervision.
     4.5.2. Recurrency. Pilots require additional in-flight training if a currency requirement is not met.
        4.5.2.1. Pilots must accomplish overdue training requirements as specified by the SQ/CC before
        they are considered requalified to perform the task. Training annotated as affecting CMR/BMC
        status will require regression to N-CMR/N-BMC until the pilot accomplishes the training. Train-
        ing identified as not affecting CMR/BMC status does not require regression from CMR; however,
        it may result in grounding until the training is completed. The duration of grounding and status of
        RAP mission lookback will determine the affect on CMR/BMC status.
AFI11-2A-OA-10V1 31 AUGUST 2006                                                                       29


     4.5.2.2. Unless otherwise specified, the SQ/CC will determine supervisory requirements pertain-
     ing to recurrency based on the flight position that offers the best control of the mission.
  4.5.3. MAJCOM/AOS Currency Requirements. For the flight delivery of aircraft coordinated
  through MAJCOM/AOS, units will comply with the additional currency requirements IAW AFI
  11-207, Combat Aircraft Delivery.
  4.5.4. Landing Recurrency. Loss of landing currency for greater than six months results in unquali-
  fied status IAW AFI 11-202V1. Landing recurrency requires the following, based on timing from the
  last landing:
     4.5.4.1. 31/46 (inexp/exp) to 90 days. Regain landing currency IAW Table 4.1.
     4.5.4.2. 91 to 135 days. Same as above, plus IP-supervised EP SIM.
     4.5.4.3. 136 to 210/225 days (inexp/exp). Same as above, plus open/closed book examinations
     and EPE. NOTE: 210/225 days equates to a six-month loss of landing currency IAW AFI
     11-202V1.
     4.5.4.4. Over 210/225 days (inexp/exp). Applicable TX IQT, requalification in weapons events,
     and MSN flight evaluation (if expired).
  4.5.5. Loss of IP Status and Requalification. IPs will accomplish the following to regain instructor
  status, based on reason for the loss:
     4.5.5.1. IP currency expires, based on timing from the last instructor event as follows:
         4.5.5.1.1. 61 to 180 days. Regain instructor currency with an IP.
         4.5.5.1.2. Over 180 days. Regain IP qualification with a flight evaluation.
     4.5.5.2. N-CMR/N-BMC. If the SQ/CC deems that loss of currency is of sufficient importance,
     the IP may lose qualification. If the SQ/CC does not take this action, or if the IP becomes non-cur-
     rent in requirements that do not affect CMR/BMC status, the IP may retain qualification, but will
     not instruct in that event/mission until the currency is regained.
     4.5.5.3. Flight evaluation failure. The IP will successfully complete retraining and a recheck eval-
     uation IAW AFI 11-202V2 (AFI 11-2A/OA-10V2).
     4.5.5.4. Open/closed book or IRC examination failure. The IP will successfully re-accomplish the
     exam.
  4.5.6. ACBT Recurrency. Pilots who have lost ACBT currency must accomplish training listed
  below, based on number of days out of currency. Missions are defined in paragraph 3.4.4. EXCEP-
  TION: FTU IPs may instruct formal course ACBT missions with FTU ACBT currency; however, all
  other ACM participation requires ACBT currency.
     4.5.6.1. 61/91 to 90/120 days (inexp/exp). Any dedicated BFM mission (e.g. ACBT-1).
     4.5.6.2. 91/120 (inexp/exp) to 180 days. BFM-1 and BFM-2.
     4.5.6.3. Over 180 days. Tailored ACBT requalification program, approved by the SQ/CC.

NOTES:
1. Recurrency supervision for BAQ Demanding currency will be an IP/supervisor.
2. Recurrency supervision will be an IP in chase, current and qualified in the event.
3. Recurrency supervision will be an IP/supervisor, current and qualified in the event.
4. ACM performance or instruction updates ACBT currency. Recurrency IAW paragraph 4.5.6.
5. Currency is required in the applicable LASDT category for operations below 1,000 feet AGL. Loss
   of currency requires regression to the next higher category in which the pilot is current. Operations
   in a lower altitude block category (e.g. CAT II) updates the higher block categories (e.g. CAT I).
   Recurrency in a pilot’s LASDT category requires vertical awareness training, hard turns, LATN,
   LATF, threat awareness and reactions, and offensive/defensive maneuvering against the appropriate
   ground or air threat.
6. Flight leads may update currency from either lead or wing position. Wingmen may only update cur-
   rency from the wing position. Recurrency will only be accomplished from the wing position.
7. Currency is required to fly an approach through actual weather down to Pilot Weather Category
   (PWC) minimums. Loss of currency requires regression to the next higher PWC. Recurrency
   supervision during day VFR conditions may be any pilot in chase or on the wing, current and quali-
   fied in the event. All other times regain currency IAW AFI 11-202V3, as supplemented.
8. FAC(A)s will perform two controls to update ASC currency, IAW the current JCAS FAC(A) MOA.
   No more than two controls may be counted per CAS target or 9-line briefing. FAC(A)s will satisfy
   ASC currency and event requirements by training with actual fighters and TACPs to the maximum
   extent possible. Failing to meet either proficiency or currency will result in FAC(A) pilots being
   non-qualified. Commanders are encouraged to establish guidance and goals aimed at achieving
   greater Joint interoperability.
9. Loss of Instructor currency and recurrency IAW paragraph 4.5.5. USAFWS upgrade missions count
   as instructor missions for currency. Updating currency in the FMT requires IPs to instruct while fly-
   ing the FMT.
10. Pilots should use NVGs during night missions to the maximum extent possible. Loss of NVG cur-
    rency requires an NVG academic review prior to the recurrency sortie. NVG Demanding currency
    is required to fly NVG tactical missions (SAT, CAS, FAC(A), and CSAR).
11. NVG Demanding recurrency will be accomplished during a dedicated non-tactical mission super-
    vised by a flight lead, current and qualified in the event.
12. NVG Landing recurrency requires a minimum of one NVG approach to a low approach, followed by
    an NVG landing IAW paragraph 6.6.4.

4.6. Regression.
     4.6.1. Failure to Meet Lookback. Only RAP training and contingency operations missions may be
     used for lookback. If a pilot does not meet lookback requirements throughout the training cycle, the
     SQ/CC can either regress the pilot to N-CMR/N-BMC, remove the pilot from a CMR/BMC manning
     position, or initiate action to remove the pilot from active flying status.
        4.6.1.1. Failure to meet one-month lookback of RAP mission requirements requires a review of
        the pilot's three-month lookback history. If the pilot meets three-month lookback, the SQ/CC may
        maintain the pilot as CMR/BMC. If the pilot does not meet three-month lookback, the SQ/CC may
        either place the pilot in probation status for one month or regress the pilot to N-CMR/N-BMC. A
        pilot on probation must reestablish a one-month lookback at the end of the probation period to
        regain CMR/BMC. See Figure 4.1.
        4.6.1.2. CMR/BMC pilots regressed to N-CMR/N-BMC must complete a SQ/CC-approved recer-
        tification program. Upon completion of the program, the pilot must then meet one-month look-
        back prior to returning to CMR/BMC. Missions and events accomplished during the
        recertification program apply toward monthly and training-cycle RAP requirements.
        4.6.1.3. RAP lookback computations begin following MQT completion. Until a three-month
        lookback is established, pilots must meet each monthly requirement; otherwise, SQ/CCs may
        apply probation rules as described in paragraph 4.6.1.1.
     4.6.2. Failure to Maintain Weapons Qualification. Pilots who fail to maintain weapons RAP
     requirements at the end of the training cycle will require the following:
        4.6.2.1. Regression to N-CMR/N-BMC for events tasked as QUAL. To regain CMR/BMC, the
        pilot must achieve initial qualification in the deficient weapons event IAW paragraph 5.2. Events
        accomplished for this initial qualification may count toward the cumulative CT event qualification
        required at the end of the next training cycle.
        4.6.2.2. Regression to N-CMR/N-BMC for events tasked as FAM. To regain CMR/BMC, the
        pilot must accomplish at least three of the weapons deliveries under the supervision of an IP/
        supervisor. Events accomplished for this initial qualification may count toward the cumulative CT
        event qualification required at the end of the next training cycle.
     4.6.3. Flight Evaluation Failure. Pilots who fail a flight evaluation will be handled IAW AFI
     11-202V2 (AFI 11-2A/OA-10V2) and will regress to N-CMR/N-BMC as applicable. Pilots will
     remain N-CMR/N-BMC until corrective action and re-evaluation are complete, and the pilots are
     recertified by the SQ/CC.

4.7. End-of-Cycle Requirements. Pilots who fail to complete RAP requirements by the end of the train-
ing cycle may require additional training depending on the type and magnitude of the deficiency. Refer to
paragraph 4.8. for guidance on prorating training requirements. In all cases, report training shortfalls IAW
paragraph 1.2.5.12.
     4.7.1. Pilots who fail to meet the end-of-cycle RAP mission requirements may remain CMR/BMC as
     determined by lookback. The SQ/CC will determine if additional training is required.
     4.7.2. Pilots who fail to meet end-of-cycle basic skills (“non-RAP”) mission and/or event require-
     ments may maintain CMR/BMC as determined by lookback. The SQ/CC will determine if additional
     training is required.
AFI11-2A-OA-10V1 31 AUGUST 2006                                                                           33


   4.7.3. Failure to meet RAP requirements for a mission type will result in:
       4.7.3.1. Regression to N-CMR/N-BMC if the SQ/CC determines that the mission type deficiency
       is significant. To regain CMR/BMC, the pilot will complete all deficient mission types. These
       missions may apply to the total requirements for the new training cycle.
       4.7.3.2. Continuation at CMR/BMC if total RAP missions and lookback are maintained, and the
       mission type deficiencies are not significant.
   4.7.4. Failure to accomplish missions in a special capability will result in loss of that certification.
   The SQ/CC will direct recertification and requalification IAW paragraph 4.5. and Chapter 6.

4.8. End-of-Cycle Proration. At the end of the training cycle, SQ/CCs may prorate training require-
ments when any of the following events preclude training for a portion of the training period: Duty Not
Including Flying (DNIF), emergency/COT leaves, non-flying TDY/exercises, and combat/contingency
deployments (ANG/AFRC: mandatory training required by civilian employment). Loss of training due to
ordinary annual leave will not result in proration. SQ/CCs may consider proration due to poor weather
that precludes the unit from flying for more than one half of the monthly scheduled flying days (ANG/
AFRC: End-of-cycle proration is permitted for documented attrition, such as HHQ or weather cancels,
MNDs, ground or air aborts, in monthly increments when the total number of occurrences ranges from
one half to one times the pilot’s normal monthly rate of flying). The following guidelines apply:
   4.8.1. SQ/CCs will only prorate requirements to adjust for genuine circumstances of training
   non-availability, not to mask training or planning deficiencies.
   4.8.2. Proration is based on cumulative days of non-availability for flying during the training cycle.
   Use Table 4.2. to determine the number of prorated months based on cumulative calendar days of
   non-availability.
   4.8.3. If IQT or MQT is re-accomplished, a pilot's training cycle will start over at a prorated share fol-
   lowing completion of that training.
   4.8.4. Proration Example. A pilot was granted 17 days of emergency leave in January and then
   attended PME in residence from March through April for 56 consecutive calendar days. The SQ/CC
   authorized a total of two months of proration for the training cycle (for the 73 cumulative days of
   non-availability for flying). ANG/AFRC example: an experienced CMR pilot with a normal monthly
   requirement of six missions had eight attrition occurences throughout the training cycle, therefore the
   SQ/CC prorated one month’s training requirements.
   4.8.5. Newly assigned/converted pilots and pilots certified as CMR/BMC after the 15th of the month
   are considered to be in CT on the first day of the following month. Events and missions for the
   remainder of the training cycle may be prorated. A prorated share of RAP missions must be completed
   in CT.
   4.8.6. Night and AR requirements accomplished during MQT may be credited toward prorated CT
   requirements if accomplished during the cycle in which the pilot was declared CMR/BMC.
   4.8.7. Up to one month of a pilot's last month on station may be prorated. For reporting purposes,
   pilots who depart for a new assignment may be considered CMR for up to 60 days from date of last
   flight, or until loss of CMR currency, port call date, or sign in at new duty station, whichever occurs
   first.
34                                                              AFI11-2A-OA-10V1 31 AUGUST 2006


     4.8.8. CMR pilots who attend USAFWS in TDY-and-return status may be reported throughout the
     TDY as CMR. Upon return, those pilots will accomplish a prorated share of mission/event require-
     ments IAW Table 4.2.
     4.8.9. Contingency Operations. Deployed operations can have a positive or negative impact on a
     unit's CT program. A potential lack of training opportunities while deployed can place a burden on the
     unit, forcing it to accomplish the majority of its CT program in a reduced period of time at home sta-
     tion. The following proration procedures provide flexibility in accomplishing the unit's CT program:
        4.8.9.1. Missions flown during contingency operations will be logged as such. These missions do
        not count toward RAP requirements, but may be used for lookback purposes. Except AR, RAP
        events may be used to update currencies but do not count toward training cycle requirements.
        Units will prorate RAP missions and events upon returning from contingency operations for the
        period of time each individual was deployed. Proration is also authorized for deployment prepara-
        tion and reconstitution where home station flying is reduced by the MAJCOM. (ANG/AFRC:
        individuals deployed for more than a seven-day period may prorate a one-month portion of RAP
        missions and events.)
        4.8.9.2. As the training quality of missions flown at contingency locations may vary considerably,
        OG/CCs may allow valid RAP training to be logged as such. However, SQ/CCs may not also pro-
        rate this training upon return to home station.
        4.8.9.3. Upon return from contingency operations, units will prorate the sorties for the entire
        deployment, subtracted by the number of valid OG/CC-authorized RAP missions. The result is the
        allowable sortie proration. SQ/CCs will prorate based on the events accomplished during valid
        RAP missions. In all cases, negative numbers equate to zero.

4.9. Regaining CMR/BMC Status.
     4.9.1. If CMR/BMC status is lost due to failure to meet the end-of-cycle event requirements or weap-
     ons qualifications, requalification is IAW paragraphs 4.5. and 4.7.
AFI11-2A-OA-10V1 31 AUGUST 2006                                                                      35


   4.9.2. If CMR/BMC status is lost due to failure to meet lookback IAW paragraph 4.6.1., the following
   applies, based on timing from the date the pilot came off CMR/BMC status:
       4.9.2.1. Up to 90 days. The pilot must complete a SQ/CC-approved recertification program IAW
       paragraph 4.6.1.2. In addition, all RAP event currencies must be regained. The SQ/CC will
       approve any other additional training prior to recertification to CMR.
       4.9.2.2. 91 to 180 days. Same as above, plus Stan/Eval-generated open and closed book written
       examinations.
       4.9.2.3. Over 180 days. Re-accomplish MQT.

4.10. Example of the Lookback, Regression, Proration, and Requalification.
   4.10.1. Capt Smith is an experienced CMR pilot who flew eight times in the month of Jan and has a
   three-month lookback of 23 missions. On Feb 3, Smith flew an ACBT mission prior to departing for a
   two-month non-flying TDY. He reported back for duty on 6 Apr. The following is his status through-
   out his TDY and upon his return.
       4.10.1.1. The SQ/CC elected to report Capt Smith as CMR throughout his TDY. Therefore, on 1
       Mar, Smith’s FLT/CC reported his Feb sortie count of one, which failed the one-month lookback.
       The FLT/CC then reviewed Smith’s three-month lookback (Dec, Jan, Feb), which was also below
       the minimum required. Had he flown three more missions, his SQ/CC could show that Smith met
       lookback.
       4.10.1.2. The SQ/CC carried Capt Smith on probation for one month. On 1 Apr, the SQ/CC
       regressed Smith to N-CMR since his monthly sortie total for Mar was zero. Upon return from
       TDY, the SQ/CC placed Smith in a recertification program. When he completed this program, he
       had to fly his one-month lookback totals by 1 May. If he failed to do so, Smith would be N-CMR
       for one more month until the next lookback process on 1 Jun.
       4.10.1.3. If Capt Smith had returned on 22 Mar, and last landed the jet 48 days ago, he would fly
       a non-demanding mission to regain demanding mission and landing currency. For CMR purposes,
       Capt Smith would need to fly eight RAP missions for his monthly requirement and get off proba-
       tion. Although Smith was still CMR in Mar, the SQ/CC flew him with an IP on his first few mis-
       sions in order to regain his landing, AR, LOWAT, and formation takeoff and landing currencies.
       4.10.1.4. At the end of the training cycle, the SQ/CC prorated two months off of Capt Smith's
       total requirements. In spite of this proration, Smith was deficient in one RAP mission type. The
       SQ/CC could regress Capt Smith to N-CMR, if the deficiency in training is deemed significant.
       After accomplishing the tailored recertification program for deficient missions, the SQ/CC recer-
       tified him as CMR. Training from this program also applied to the new training cycle.

4.11. Special Flying Categories.
   4.11.1. Flight Surgeon. N/A.
   4.11.2. MAJCOM and NAF API-8 Pilots. (ANG: Responsibilities for API-8 staff flyers are con-
   tained in AFI 11-401 as supplemented by the ANG).
36                                                              AFI11-2A-OA-10V1 31 AUGUST 2006


        4.11.2.1. Mission Directed Training (MDT) for HHQ personnel, other than that conducted in sup-
        port of a formal inspection, requires coordination with the supporting unit. MAJCOM Division
        Chiefs and NAF/A3s are reviewing authorities for assigned personnel. They will:
           4.11.2.1.1. Coordinate with the supporting agency to ensure appropriate ARMS data is main-
           tained and provided IAW AFI 11-401.
           4.11.2.1.2. Review accomplishments and currencies of assigned pilots prior to authorizing
           participation in MDT.
           4.11.2.1.3. Provide written documentation specifying the mission types and events each pilot
           is authorized to fly. API-8 personnel who fly with only one unit may receive this from their
           attached unit commander.
        4.11.2.2. HHQ pilots maintaining BMC status are exempt from academic ground training, NAR,
        CW training, and special training programs within authorized mission areas. Provide specific cur-
        rencies to the host squadron. HHQ supervisors will determine pilot qualifications to participate in
        squadron scenarios for MDT.
        4.11.2.3. Each HHQ pilot will:
           4.11.2.3.1. Review accomplishments and currencies for accuracy.
           4.11.2.3.2. Submit qualification and/or authorization documentation to the supporting SQ/CC
           or authorized representative prior to flying with that squadron.
           4.11.2.3.3. Evaluate the demands of each mission scenario and ensure personal abilities and
           proficiencies will not be exceeded.
        4.11.2.4. IPs may perform instructor duties with the concurrence of the OG/CC, if current and
        qualified in the applicable mission and events.
     4.11.3. Active Duty pilots flying with ANG and AFRC units.
        4.11.3.1. Wing/group air advisor rated personnel on duty with operational training units can
        maintain CMR and may be qualified as an IP and SEFE.
        4.11.3.2. Active duty pilots other than assigned advisors are authorized to fly with Air Reserve
        Component (ARC) units IAW AFI 11-401.
        4.11.3.3. Pilots on exchange programs from active duty units are authorized mission oriented sor-
        ties IAW the specific OPlan that establishes the exchange. SQ/CCs may authorize their participa-
        tion IAW their specific experience and qualification.
        4.11.3.4. HHQ staff pilots may participate in tactical training events. Each pilot will present doc-
        umentation summarizing currencies, egress training, flight qualifications, etc., to the unit where
        flying is performed.

4.12. Instruments.
     4.12.1. An instrument training program will be developed IAW AFMAN 11-210, Instrument
     Refresher Program (IRP).
AFI11-2A-OA-10V1 31 AUGUST 2006                                                                         37


   4.12.2. Units that seldom encounter bad weather and/or night recoveries should exercise pilots and
   approach facilities by periodically simulating "weather day" recovery operations, as determined by
   the SQ/CC.
   4.12.3. Pilots transferring from another MAJCOM require the theater-specific portions of the Instru-
   ment Refresher Course (IRC) before flying without a theater-experienced pilot in the formation. MQT
   academics and the LAO mission in paragraph 3.4.6.1. may satisfy this requirement.
   4.12.4. RAP events may be accomplished on an instrument sortie provided accomplishment does not
   interfere with the primary goal of instrument training. The transition from instruments to visual refer-
   ences should be practiced on all instrument sorties. An instrument sortie is a basic skills (“non-RAP”)
   sortie requirement, which may be credited toward monthly RAP lookback only IAW the RAP Tasking
   memo.

4.13. G-Awareness Continuation Training. Units will develop a program to imprint a proper Anti-G
Straining Maneuver (AGSM) and provide feedback to pilots so their AGSM is integral to pulling Gs.
   4.13.1. This program will give each FL, IP and supervisor the skills needed to evaluate a pilot's mis-
   sion tape to ensure a proper AGSM is being performed. This program integrates flight surgeon and
   aerospace physiologist expertise and makes FL-assessment of the AGSM a normal debrief item dur-
   ing mission tape review of the mission’s tactical portions.
   4.13.2. Use the following minimum guidance to implement the unit's program:
      4.13.2.1. Incorporate AGSM technique and assessment into the flying training program. FLs will
      brief, debrief, and assess the AGSM using the mission tape in the debrief on a routine basis.
      4.13.2.2. Include "AGSM effectiveness" on MQT and "AGSM assessment" on FLUG and IPUG
      grade sheets. IPs will evaluate these areas on upgrade missions that involve tactical maneuvering,
      such as ACBT and SAT, and when at least five Gs are pulled or anticipated.
      4.13.2.3. Pilots will accomplish a G-awareness exercise prior to tactical maneuvering IAW
      AFTTP 3-3. Film the exercise through the HUD and in hot mic for mission tape review.
      4.13.2.4. The approved instructional video covering AGSM technique, reinforcement, and assess-
      ment, or Anti-G strain technique academics, will be presented by a qualified physiologist, flight
      surgeon, or IP/supervisor to all pilots as part of weapons and tactics academics. Academics will
      include a discussion of the limitations imposed on aircraft performance as a result of an ineffective
      AGSM.
      4.13.2.5. Develop a program to ensure at least one tactical mission tape for each pilot is reviewed
      and documented each training cycle by a flight surgeon, aerospace physiologist, or squadron
      supervisor.
   4.13.3. Pilots identified as having poor AGSM technique or low G-tolerance will be identified to the
   FLT/CC or appropriate operations supervisor. The SQ/DO or appropriate supervisor will determine
   what action is required to improve the pilot's G-tolerance. The SQ/CC will determine if com-
   mander-directed acceleration training is required IAW AFI 11-404, Centrifuge Training for High-G
   Aircrew. As a minimum, pilots identified for additional G-tolerance training will accomplish the fol-
   lowing:
38                                                               AFI11-2A-OA-10V1 31 AUGUST 2006


        4.13.3.1. Use hot mic during the tactical portion of all missions to enable assessment of the
        AGSM. Intercom volume will be set at a level which is comfortable for the pilot but still allows
        assessment of breathing and AGSM technique in the debrief. The purpose of this is to identify
        breakdowns in the AGSM that commonly occur during high-task portions of a mission.
        4.13.3.2. During the mission tape review, FLs will assess and debrief the pilot’s AGSM effective-
        ness. Compare the AGSM during the G-awareness exercise to breathing techniques while
        fatigued, as this is usually when the AGSM breaks down and GLOC occurs.

4.14. Low/Slow Speed VID Procedures.
     4.14.1. If required for specific tasking, the objective of this low/slow speed VID training is to expose
     pilots to problems associated with intercepting low/slow flying aircraft (rotary and fixed-wing) for
     visual identification practice in a threat environment. Emphasis should be placed on dissimilar adver-
     saries below 5,000 feet AGL and 250 KIAS (helicopters are desired). Training will be conducted IAW
     AFTTP 3-1, AFI 11-2A/OA-10V3, and AFI 11-214.
        4.14.1.1. Unit developed ground training programs will be designed for unit specific equipage
        and employment tasking. Academic sessions should be conducted during weapons and tactics
        training and maximum use of the visual recognition program is encouraged.
        4.14.1.2. Flying training missions should include helicopter operations and considerations to the
        maximum extent possible. Training assets include helicopters and propeller aircraft from any mil-
        itary service. Creation of a realistic environment to simulate the aircraft VID suite is essential to
        the conduct of low/slow VID procedures. Units must make every effort to maximize effective use
        of limited assets as well as to instill awareness and actions appropriate to this training. SQ/CCs
        will determine the depth of ground and flying training necessary prior to participating in exercises
        and contingency operations.

4.15. EC. Flying training missions should typically include EC-oriented operations and considerations.
Available assets include ground-based threat simulators, unit-equipped ECM pods (configured with train-
ing settings), airborne ECCM devices, and dissimilar adversaries. Creation of an electronic environment
to stimulate the aircraft electronic and avionics suite is essential to the conduct of realistic EC training.
Units must make every effort to maximize effective use of limited assets as well as instill awareness and
actions appropriate to the EC environment.

                                                 Chapter 5

                    WEAPONS DELIVERY/EMPLOYMENT QUALIFICATION


5.1. General. This chapter outlines requirements for attaining initial qualification and maintaining CT
qualification in the employment of air-to-surface and air-to-air weapons. Refer to Attachment 2 for fur-
ther guidance on weapons events.

5.2. Initial Weapons Qualification (QUAL). Pilots must accomplish initial qualification in all weapons
events listed in the RAP Tasking memo as QUAL events. Initial qualification achieved in IQT or MQT
satisfies requirements for CT initial qualification, but not for CT event requirements. Initial qualification
will carry over for consecutive tours in the A/OA-10.
     5.2.1. Initial qualification in a weapons event is satisfied when the pilot has achieved a minimum of
     three hits out of six consecutive record deliveries, if not specified otherwise.
     5.2.2. Strafe/Conventional. Deliveries may be accomplished from basic or tactical deliveries. Prior to
     initial qualification in strafe, there is no limit to the number of hot passes.
     5.2.3. Maverick. Deliveries must be accomplished from tactical deliveries.
     5.2.4. AIM-9. Qualification in one missile category is assumed for other missile categories in such
     cases where only one type of missile was employed.

5.3. CT Weapons QUAL. These criteria establish the minimum standards for a pilot to maintain qualifi-
cation in the appropriate RAP-tasked weapons delivery events and do not necessarily determine evalua-
tion criteria established by other instructions or agencies (e.g., inspection/evaluation teams). The RAP
Tasking memo defines specific training cycle requirements for weapons qualification.
     5.3.1. CT weapons deliveries will be tactical deliveries simulating realistic employment of Unit Com-
     mitted Munitions List (UCML) munitions, considering such factors as fusing, safe separation/escape,
     and minimum recovery altitudes. CT air-to-surface weapons event requirements should be accom-
     plished on scoreable tactical ranges to the maximum extent practical. To maintain a combat perspec-
     tive in a peacetime environment, weapons deliveries should simulate realistic employment of live
     munitions and Standard Conventional Loads (SCLs).
     5.3.2. Pilots will maintain weapons qualification by completing the minimum number of record deliv-
     eries and record hits (if required), and also by achieving appropriate qualification percentage during
     the training period.
     5.3.3. At the end of the training cycle, each pilot's weapons delivery scores will be reviewed to assess
     the pilot's qualification. If qualified, the pilot's weapons qualification remains valid through the next
     training period, unless qualification is lost sooner.
     5.3.4. QUAL requires an overall record hit rate of 50 percent of record hits, unless specified other-
     wise. The RAP Tasking memo further defines QUAL requirements based on the training cycle. Addi-
     tional guidance is as follows:
        5.3.4.1. Strafe. Multiple strafe for the same type event is authorized if cockpit rounds count is
        declared between events, the appropriate total number of rounds are set in the limiter, and different
AFI11-2A-OA-10V1 31 AUGUST 2006                                                                           41


       target arrays are used (e.g., a different range or at least 90 degrees heading change.) Pilots will be
       charged actual rounds fired or rounds set per event, whichever is greater, for each event.
       5.3.4.2. Maverick. If a unit is equipped with various types of Mavericks, training should be equi-
       tably divided between types based on unit equipage and expected tasking to the maximum extent
       practical.
       5.3.4.3. AIM-9. QUAL requires a 75 percent hit rate.

5.4. Failure to Qualify. Failure to qualify in one event does not invalidate qualification in others. SQ/
CCs may declare a pilot unqualified in an event(s) and invalidate all previous record deliveries for that
event at any time during a training cycle without affecting other weapons event qualifications. If QUAL
is required at CMR/BMC, a pilot who fails to qualify will regress to N-CMR/N-BMC and be entered into
recertification until requalification is accomplished.

5.5. Weapons Delivery Parameters. The event requirements and parameters listed below form the basic
framework for pilot weapons delivery training. All deliveries will conform to the limits established for
each specific event. Pattern descriptions, procedures, training rules, and foul criteria are contained in AFI
11-2A/OA-10V3 and AFI 11-214. Events performed at night may require higher minimum recovery alti-
tudes based on AFI 11-214 minimum altitude restrictions.
   5.5.1. Strafe Events. Pilots will set the aircraft rounds limiter to the total number of rounds for all
   events planned. A minimum of 50 rounds per strafe event must be set and expended to satisfy RAP
   strafe requirements. The maximum number of passes for each event is three.
       5.5.1.1. Low Angle Strafe (LAS). Planned dive angle of 15 degrees or less. Foul line is 2,000
       feet. Minimum recovery altitude is 75 feet AGL. Number of rounds per event is 100. Hit Criteria:
       25 percent of actual rounds fired result in hits. Each valid hole or acoustic-score count is a hit. If
       acoustic-score is not available, adjust the number of hits by percentage of surface area when target
       size is other than 625 square feet or independently observed impacts (suitable targets) on all three
       passes.
       5.5.1.2. Long Range Strafe (LRS). Planned dive angle of 15 degrees or less. Foul line is 2,000
       feet. Minimum recovery altitude is 75 feet AGL. Open fire range is IAW range restrictions. Cease
       fire range is 5,000 feet for computed delivery or 3,000 feet for manual delivery. Number of rounds
       per event is 100. Hit Criteria: five acoustically scored impacts or independently observed impacts
       (suitable target) on any pass.
       5.5.1.3. Two-Target Strafe (TTS). Planned dive angle of 15 degrees or less. Foul line is 2,000
       feet. Minimum recovery altitude is 75 feet AGL. Number of rounds per event is 150. Hit Criteria:

       targets. Impacts may be acoustically scored or independently observed (suitable targets).
       5.5.1.4. High Angle Strafe (HAS). Planned dive angle of greater than 15 degrees. Minimum
       recovery altitudes are 1,000 feet AGL for planned dive angles 30 degrees or less and 1,500 feet
       AGL for planned dive angles above 30 degrees. Number of rounds per event is 100. Hit Criteria:
       acoustically scored or independently observed impact on a point target, or bullet dispersion within
       75 feet of any target.
   5.5.2. Unguided Munitions Events.
42                                                               AFI11-2A-OA-10V1 31 AUGUST 2006


        5.5.2.1. Visual Level Delivery (VLD). Planned level delivery with actual parameters at release
        of less than five degrees climb or dive. Minimum recovery altitude on final is safe escape/fuze arm
        for ordnance being delivered/simulated, range/target area restrictions, or 200 feet, whichever is
        higher. Run in altitude prior to final or pull up point will be no lower than the pilot’s LASDT cat-
        egory. Hit Criteria: 125 feet (38 meters) for computed delivery and 250 feet (76 meters) for man-
        ual delivery.

        Hit Criteria: either actual AGM target impact or valid, recorded TGM simulated weapon release
        within launch parameters with stabilized target tracking.
AFI11-2A-OA-10V1 31 AUGUST 2006                                                                          43


       5.5.3.2. Laser Guided Bomb (LGB). An event in which a combat/training laser is employed to
       self-lase simulated/actual ordnance during an LGB delivery. Minimum recovery is safe escape/
       fuze arm/guide time required for the ordnance being simulated/delivered. Hit criteria: IAW
       AFTTP 3-1.
       5.5.3.3. Inertially Aided Munition (IAM). An event in which an aircraft system is used to deter-
       mine release parameters for Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) and Wind Corrected Munitions
       Dispenser (WCMD) weapons. Delivery of ordnance, actual or training, is not required. Minimum
       recovery is safe escape for the ordnance being simulated/delivered. Hit criteria: IAW AFTTP 3-1.
   5.5.4. Rocket Events. Hit criteria applies only to controlled deliveries against a point target intended

       5.5.4.3. Low Altitude Tactical Rocket (LATR). Planned dive angle of 20 degrees or less. Tacti-
       cal delivery with a slant range at release of 10,000 feet or greater from the target. Minimum recov-
       ery altitude 1,000 feet AGL. Hit Criteria: 500 feet (152 meters) for computed delivery and 1,000
       feet (300 meters) for manual delivery.
       5.5.4.4. High Altitude Tactical Rocket (HATR). Tactical delivery with a slant range at release
       of 10,000 feet or greater from the target. Minimum recovery altitude is 4,500 feet AGL. Hit Crite-
       ria: 250 feet (76 meters) for computed delivery and 500 feet (152 meters) for manual delivery.
       5.5.4.5. High Altitude Release Rocket (HARR). Minimum recovery altitude is 10,000 feet
       AGL. Hit Criteria: 500 feet (152 meters) for computed delivery and 1,000 feet (300 meters) for

5.6. Full Scale/Live Ordnance. Full Scale Weapons Delivery (FSWD) and live ordnance training is
essential to pilot combat capability. Each pilot will be given the opportunity to deliver/employ as many
types of weapons inventoried on the UCML as possible. Delivery of live or inert ordnance representing a
typical combat configuration in a tactical scenario qualifies as a FSWD event. Only one event may be
logged per sortie. To provide this opportunity, pilots will expend full scale/live ordnance IAW the FSWD
requirement specified by the RAP Tasking memo (AFI 36-2217).

                                        SPECIALIZED TRAINING


6.1. General. This chapter outlines pilot upgrade training programs for special capabilities and qualifica-
tions. Units will develop and maintain local specialized training programs based on these guidelines. SQ/
CCs may tailor programs for individual UPs based on previous experience, qualifications, and docu-
mented performance.

6.2. Flight Lead Upgrade (FLUG). This program establishes the minimum guidelines for those pilots
identified by the SQ/CC for FLUG training.
     6.2.1. Initial FLUG entry is as a 2-ship/element FL until experience and proficiency warrant further
     progression. Responsibilities for leading a formation will not exceed an element of two aircraft until
     certified as a 4-ship FL. The SQ/CC will determine when a 2-ship FL may train to lead larger, more
     complex formations (4-ship, multi-ship, multi-flight package, mission commander, etc.).
     6.2.2. Prior to FL certification, the SQ/CC will personally interview the UP and review FL responsi-
     bilities, scope of duties, authority, and philosophy. The SQ/CC will certify the new flight lead's status,
     including any restrictions, in appropriate written format (grade sheet, training folder, Letter of Xs,
     etc.).
     6.2.3. The following minimum flying hours are required prior to FLUG entry:
        6.2.3.1. 300 hours A/OA-10 PAI, or
        6.2.3.2. 400 hours FP/MP/IP in an AFSC of 11Fxx, 11K3C, or 11K3D, of which 200 hours are A/
        OA-10 PAI, or
        6.2.3.3. 50 hours A/OA-10 PAI, if previously qualified as an 11Fxx FL (or other US/foreign mil-
        itary equivalent).
        6.2.3.4. ANG: For converting units, OG/CCs may select prior FL-qualified pilots to upgrade to
        FL concurrent with MQT regardless of PAI hours.
     6.2.4. FLUG Ground Training. Units will develop local training in the following areas:
        6.2.4.1. FL responsibilities. Wingman relationship, unit training objectives, and responsibilities to
        SQ/CC. Review of appropriate Joint/MAJCOM Instructions, Air Force Instructions, and local
        guidance.
        6.2.4.2. Mission preparation. Wingman requirements and responsibilities, currencies, proficien-
        cies, capabilities, delegation of mission planning duties, developing appropriate mission objec-
        tives, and briefing preparation.
        6.2.4.3. Conduct of flight briefings and debriefings. Mission objectives, use of briefing guides
        and audiovisual aids, wingmen involvement, briefing techniques, debriefing/questioning tech-
        niques, mission tape review responsibilities and procedures.
        6.2.4.4. Conduct of missions. Leadership and control of flight, flight discipline, EPs, and TRs.
        6.2.4.5. Practice briefing(s). Administrative items, mission tasks, and contingencies.
AFI11-2A-OA-10V1 31 AUGUST 2006                                                                        45


     6.2.4.6. FLUG Simulator Training. Units will incorporate FMT profiles into FLUG to the max-
     imum extent practical, depending on simulator capabilities and availability. The intent is to ensure
     UPs thoroughly prepare for in-flight training, capitalize on valuable flight time, and provide train-
     ing not available in the aircraft. SQ/CCs will review each FLUG for trends and common errors,
     and include appropriate training events in FLUG FMT profiles to avoid recurrence.
  6.2.5. FLUG Flight Training.
     6.2.5.1. The mission profiles listed below are organized in a building-block approach. The SQ/CC
     may modify profiles as necessary, but will ensure the following guidelines are met:
        6.2.5.1.1. All FLUG training will be under the direct supervision of an IP or FL-qualified
        squadron supervisor.
        6.2.5.1.2. A dedicated FL certification mission is required and will be flown with the SQ/CC
        or designated representative.
        6.2.5.1.3. Required FLUG missions/events. 2-ship: BFM, BSA, SAT, LATF, HATF, DAR,
        NAR, instrument trail departure, and two formation takeoffs/landings. 4-ship: ACM, BSA,
        SAT, LATF, HATF, and instrument trail departure.
        6.2.5.1.4. Unaccomplished tasks. Scheduled training events unaccomplished need not delay
        certification. The SQ/CC may certify the FL with appropriate restrictions based on unaccom-
        plished training (e.g., NAR). The FL is restricted from leading unaccomplished events until
        that task is successfully completed in FLUG status.
        6.2.5.1.5. FLUG missions and events may be flown in any order, provided day training pre-
        cedes night and 2-ship training precedes larger formations.
        6.2.5.1.6. Schedule dissimilar and support assets to the maximum extent practical during
        FLUG ACM and CAS training.

        based on currency, experience, and documented performance. The SQ/CC will ensure the follow-
        ing guidelines are met:
           6.4.3.1.1. IPUG training will be under the supervision of an experienced IP, SQ/CC/DO, or
           OG/CC/CD.
           6.4.3.1.2. A dedicated IP flight evaluation is required and will be flown with an FE IAW AFI
           11-202V2 (AFI 11-2A/OA-10V2) and local Stan/Eval criteria. The SQ/CC will certify the
           new IP's status, including any restrictions, in appropriate written format (grade sheet, training
           folder, Letter of Xs, etc.).
           6.4.3.1.3. Unaccomplished tasks. Scheduled training events unaccomplished need not delay
           IP qualification. The IP is restricted from instructing unaccomplished events until that task is
           successfully completed in an IPUG status.
           6.4.3.1.4. IPUG missions may be flown in any order, as aircraft configuration and scheduling
           dictate. Maintain a building-block approach to the maximum extent practical.
           6.4.3.1.5. UIPs must be current and qualified in all planned IPUG events. UIPs who are not
           FAC(A)-certified will not fly the IPUG ASC missions.
           6.4.3.1.6. IPUG training objectives will be based on instruction of MQT, CT, and specialized
           training. Mission scenarios will reflect typical unit training missions/events and the simulation
           of common UP errors.
           6.4.3.1.7. Method of instruction. UIPs will practice assessing performance, immediately rec-
           ognizing errors, and providing timely in-flight corrections. UIPs may also instruct mission
           tasks through maneuver demonstration as specified in the IPUG flight profile. Briefings will
           cover guidelines for in-scenario/out-of-scenario instruction, and methods for pausing and/or
           resuming the scenario, as appropriate.
        6.4.3.2. IPUG Missions.

6.5. Mission Commander (MCC) Upgrade. This program establishes the minimum guidelines for
those pilots identified by the SQ/CC for MCC upgrade training.
     6.5.1. SQ/CCs will consider ability, judgment, technical expertise, skill, and experience when select-
     ing pilots for MCC upgrade. Minimum qualifications are 4-ship FL.
     6.5.2. Prior to MCC certification, the SQ/CC will personally interview the UP and review MCC
     responsibilities, scope of duties, authority, and philosophy. The SQ/CC will certify the new MCC's
     status, including any restrictions, in appropriate written format (grade sheet, training folder, Letter of
     Xs, etc.).
     6.5.3. MCC Responsibilities. The MCC is responsible for planning coordinating, briefing, execut-
     ing, and debriefing joint/composite force employment packages. Mission commanders, once certified,
     are authorized to lead joint/composite force missions. MCCs may delegate the authority and responsi-
     bility for a portion of the mission to a secondary MCC. For example, overall MCCs may designate an
     A/A MCC to be in charge of the A/A portion of the mission.
     6.5.4. MCC Ground Training. Units will develop local training in the following areas:
        6.5.4.1. Mission Planning Considerations. Range space and availability, ATC restrictions/consid-
        erations/flight plans, air refueling operations, inter-unit coordination, air-to-air and air-to-surface
        force integration, IADS penetration/avoidance, on-range controlling agencies coordination, GCI
        coordination.
        6.5.4.2. Review AFTTP 3-1 volumes for specific MCC checklists and considerations.
        6.5.4.3. MCC Simulator Training. Units will incorporate FMT profiles into MCC training to
        the maximum extent practical, depending on simulator capabilities and availability. The intent is
        to ensure UPs thoroughly prepare for in-flight training, capitalize on valuable flight time, and pro-
        vide training not available in the aircraft. SQ/CCs will review each MCC upgrade for trends and
        common errors, and include appropriate training events in MCC FMT profiles to avoid recur-
        rence.
     6.5.5. MCC Flight Training. As a minimum, the upgrading MCC will observe a certified MCC dur-
     ing the planning, briefing, flight, and debriefing of at least one composite force mission. Prior to cer-
     tification, the upgrading MCC will then plan, brief, fly, and debrief a minimum of one mission under
     the supervision of an MCC-qualified IP/supervisor. Unit tasking should drive force composition,
     adversaries, and minimum flight size. The MCC will determine overall upgrade mission effectiveness
     in case of fallout.

6.6. Night Vision Goggle (NVG) Takeoff and Landing (T/L) Upgrade. This program establishes the
minimum guidelines for those pilots identified by the SQ/CC for NVG T/L upgrade training.
     6.6.1. SQ/CCs will consider ability, judgment, technical expertise, skill, and experience when select-
     ing pilots for NVG T/L upgrade.
     6.6.2. Prior to NVG T/L certification, the SQ/CC will review the UP’s performance and completion
     of upgrade requirements. The SQ/CC will certify the pilot’s NVG T/L status, including any restric-
     tions, in appropriate written format (grade sheet, training folder, Letter of Xs, etc.).
     6.6.3. NVG T/L Ground Training. Units will use formally produced academics and will develop
     local training in the following areas:
AFI11-2A-OA-10V1 31 AUGUST 2006                                                                             53


       6.6.3.1. Publications Review. AFI 11-2A/OA-10V3, AFTTP 3-1.3/3-3.3, applicable test and eval-
       uation reports (awaiting incorporation), and local operating procedures.
       6.6.3.2. Mission Planning Considerations. Airfield and runway approach lighting configurations,
       non-standard ground operations, lights-out taxi procedures, moon illumination, sky glow impacts,
       cultural lighting, alternate recovery plan, immediate reaction to malfunctions.

       6.6.4.1. All NVG T/L upgrade training will be under the supervision of a certified IP/supervisor.
       Unless specified otherwise, the supervisor will fly chase or other deconflicted position to properly
       assess UP performance.
       6.6.4.2. Minimum weather requirements for the NVG T/L upgrade mission is 3000/5.
       6.6.4.3. Airfield lighting. Units will conduct NVG T/L training at airfields with reduced or covert
       lighting whenever practical. Although not required for effective training, this provides enhanced
       awareness of actual combat operations at a Forward Operating Location (FOL). In order to repli-
       cate FOL conditions, pilots should accomplish NVG approaches to blacked-out aerodromes
       equipped with the Airfield Marking Pattern (AMP)-3 or similar covert lighting. Units may accom-
       plish NVG T/L training at airfields with normal aerodrome lighting if resources are not available
       to replicate FOL operations. To minimize training impacts, pilots must maintain awareness of any
       overt lighting near the runway and will request approach lighting be reduced or turned off as
       required.
       6.6.4.4. Aircraft lighting procedures. Units will install IR covers on the aircraft taxi lights to
       accomplish training at airfields with covert/AMP lighting. At airfields with normal lighting, pilots
       may use landing and/or taxi lights without the IR cover installed. Pilots will exercise extreme cau-
       tion during ground operations with reduced aircraft lighting.
       6.6.4.5. NVG T/L Mission. Mission Objectives: Introduce NVG T/L operations. Specific Mis-
       sion Tasks: NVG ground operations, taxi with reduced lighting, airfield lighting awareness, NVG
       takeoff, departure, planned mission accomplishment, two NVG approaches to low approach and
       climbout, runway approach lighting variations, NVG approach and landing.

6.7. Targeting Pod (TGP) Upgrade. This program establishes the minimum guidelines for those pilots
identified by the SQ/CC for TGP upgrade training.

   ing pilots for TGP upgrade.
   6.7.2. Prior to TGP certification, the SQ/CC will review the UP’s performance and completion of
   upgrade requirements. The SQ/CC will certify the pilot’s TGP status, including any restrictions, in
   appropriate written format (grade sheet, training folder, Letter of Xs, etc.).
   6.7.3. Additional Certifications. At the discretion of the SQ/CC, FLs will lead a TGP mission with a
   certified IP/supervisor to certify as a TGP FL. IPs will fly 10 total TGP missions prior to certification
   as a TGP IP.
54                                                              AFI11-2A-OA-10V1 31 AUGUST 2006

            ations at night with NVGs.
     6.7.5. TGP Flight Training.
        6.7.5.1. Supervision will be a TGP-qualified IP/supervisor. For ROVER downlink certification,
        pilots must complete two downlink events with a ROVER-certified IP/supervisor. For units with-
        out a ROVER-certified IP/supervisor, the SQ/CC may designate an IP who will supervise the ini-
        tial cadre training. Direct connectivity with compatible ground equipment is required.
        6.7.5.2. TGP missions may be flown in any order, as aircraft configuration and scheduling dictate.
        Maintain a building-block approach to the maximum extent practical. TGP-4 may be flown day or

6.8. Low Altitude Step-Down Training (LASDT), CAT II/III Upgrade. This program establishes the
minimum guidelines for those highly experienced pilots identified by the SQ/CC for further LASDT
upgrade. OG/CCs will assess each unit’s apportionment of LASDT CAT upgrades and certifications
based on expected tasking and risk management.
   6.8.1. SQ/CCs will consider ability, judgment, technical expertise, skill, and experience when select-
   ing pilots for LASDT CAT II and CAT III upgrade. The altitude to which a pilot is certified is deter-
   mined by the SQ/CC and based on the lowest altitude at which all tasks can be comfortably performed
   and proficiency demonstrated. The goal is proficiency down to a minimum altitude compatible with
   the squadron’s mission.
   6.8.2. Prior to LASDT CAT II or CAT III certification, the SQ/CC will personally interview the UP
   and review LASDT responsibilities, scope of duties, authority, and philosophy. The SQ/CC will cer-
   tify the new status, including any restrictions, in appropriate written format (grade sheet, training
   folder, Letter of Xs, etc.).
   6.8.3. LASDT training is built on a multi-phase training process IAW Table 6.1. There are no time
   limits to upgrade beyond CAT I, and progress will be based upon individual pilot proficiency and
   training availability. LASDT progression to a higher category requires proficiency and currency in the
   preceding category. Supervision will be an IP/supervisor in the UP’s element and certified in the
   LASDT category.
56                                                                AFI11-2A-OA-10V1 31 AUGUST 2006

6.9. Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR) Upgrade. This program establishes the minimum guidelines
for those pilots identified by the SQ/CC for CSAR upgrade training.
   6.9.1. CSAR pilots train to support various types of operations for rescue of downed pilots in both
   peacetime and combat environments. This includes on-scene command, electronic and visual search,
   threat suppression, helicopter escort and protection, and communications relay. CSAR upgrade train-
   ing is extremely demanding, and SQ/CCs will select only the most experienced pilots for CSAR
   upgrade training. FAC(A) experience is highly desired. Pilots retain CSAR certification with aircraft
   qualification.
   6.9.2. Prior to certification at each of the four CSAR mission levels, designated Sandy 1 through
   Sandy 4, the SQ/CC will personally interview the UP and review CSAR responsibilities, scope of
   duties, authority, and philosophy. The SQ/CC will certify the new pilot’s Sandy status, including any
   restrictions, in appropriate written format (grade sheet, training folder, Letter of Xs, etc.).
   6.9.3. CSAR Ground Training.
      6.9.3.1. CSAR Procedures. Command and control, CSAR ordnance, tactics and techniques.
      6.9.3.2. Search Patterns and Procedures. Electronic and visual search, LARS, and Quickdraw.
      6.9.3.3. Helicopter Escort. Rendezvous, escort, and hover cover.
      6.9.3.4. ASC Procedures. Target identification, ordnance selection, pre-strike preparation, target
      marking, strike control procedures, and BDA.
58                                                             AFI11-2A-OA-10V1 31 AUGUST 2006


        6.9.3.5. CSAR Simulator Training. Units will incorporate FMT profiles into the CSAR upgrade
        to the maximum extent practical, depending on simulator capabilities and availability. The intent
        is to ensure UPs thoroughly prepare for in-flight training, capitalize on valuable flight time, and
        provide training not available in the aircraft. SQ/CCs will review each CSAR upgrade for trends
        and common errors, and include appropriate training events in CSAR FMT profiles to avoid recur-
        rence.
     6.9.4. CSAR Flight Training.
        6.9.4.1. The mission profiles listed below are organized in a building-block approach. SQ/CCs
        will specify refresher training for previously qualified CSAR pilots, based on the pilot’s experi-
        ence and currency. The SQ/CC may modify profiles as necessary, but will ensure the following
        guidelines are met:
           6.9.4.1.1. All CSAR upgrade training will be under the supervision of a Sandy 1-certified IP.
           IP demonstration of each mission event is preferred prior to UP accomplishment.
           6.9.4.1.2. Certification Levels. Upon completion of CSAR-1, pilots may fly Rescue Escort
           (RESCORT) as a Sandy 4 wingman. CSAR-2 completion certifies pilots for Sandy 3 duties.
           CSAR-4 completion certifies pilots for Sandy 2 duties. CSAR-6 completion certifies FLs to
           lead CSAR missions as a Sandy 1. Either CSAR-5 or CSAR-6 will be planned and flown as a
           4-ship for Sandy 1 pilots to lead multi-ship CSAR missions.
           6.9.4.1.3. Required CSAR upgrade missions/events. Fly each mission with two to four air-
           craft. Helicopters are mandatory for CSAR-1, CSAR-2, and either CSAR-5 or CSAR-6.
           Actual on-ground personnel simulating survivor(s) are required on either CSAR-1 or CSAR-2
           and either CSAR-5 or CSAR-6. SQ/CCs may waive CSAR-3 for certified FAC(A)s with
           appropriate experience.
           6.9.4.1.4. Unaccomplished tasks. Scheduled training events unaccomplished need not delay
           certification. The SQ/CC may certify Sandy pilots with appropriate restrictions based on unac-
           complished training. The Sandy pilot is restricted from performing unaccomplished events
           until that task is successfully completed in an upgrade status. CSAR mission requirements and
           mission tasks may be accomplished with part task training outside of a CSAR scenario.
        6.9.4.2. CSAR Missions.
           6.9.4.2.1. CSAR-1. Mission Objectives: Introduce Sandy 4 duties. Specific Mission Tasks:
           Search procedures, route reconnaissance, helicopter escort, and ground personnel marking
           demo.
           6.9.4.2.2. CSAR-2. Mission Objectives: Introduce Sandy 3 duties. Specific Mission Tasks:
           Coordination procedures, lead helicopter RESCORT and route reconnaissance.
           6.9.4.2.3. CSAR-3. Mission Objectives: Introduce Sandy ASC and suppression. Specific
           Mission Tasks: Sandy ASC, suppression strike control, search techniques, and coordination
           procedures. NOTE: Emphasis on this mission, which may be waived for certified FAC(A)s,
           will be placed on ASC procedures.
           6.9.4.2.4. CSAR-4. Mission Objectives: Demonstrate proficiency in Sandy 2 duties. Specific
           Mission Tasks: Coordination procedures, control SAR assets as directed by Sandy 1, search
           techniques, strike control during suppression, and on-scene command if required.
AFI11-2A-OA-10V1 31 AUGUST 2006                                                                         59


          6.9.4.2.5. CSAR-5. Mission Objectives: Practice coordinating and controlling an unopposed
          CSAR. Specific Mission Tasks: Plan, brief and lead an unopposed CSAR, search, on-scene
          command, helicopter RESCORT, survivor preparation and pick-up.
          6.9.4.2.6. CSAR-6. Mission Objectives: Demonstrate proficiency in Sandy 1 duties during an
          opposed CSAR. Specific Mission Tasks: Plan, brief and lead an opposed CSAR, search,
          on-scene command, threat suppression, helicopter RESCORT, survivor preparation and
          pick-up. NOTE: CSAR opposition may include air threats, ground threats, and threats to the
          survivor. Incorporate outside assets to the maximum extent practical, such as ground aggres-
          sors, strike fighters, and FAC(A)s.

6.10. Anti-Helicopter Upgrade. This program establishes the minimum guidelines for those pilots iden-
tified by the SQ/CC for anti-helicopter upgrade training.
   6.10.1. Fly anti-helicopter training IAW A/A training rules in AFI 11-214.
   6.10.2. Prior to anti-helicopter certification, the SQ/CC will review the UP’s performance and com-
   pletion of upgrade requirements. The SQ/CC will certify the pilot’s status, including any restrictions,
   in appropriate written format (grade sheet, training folder, Letter of Xs, etc.). The pilot may fly
   anti-helicopter missions down to 300 feet AGL or LASDT CAT, whichever is higher.
   6.10.3. Anti-Helicopter Ground Training. Helicopter threat, VID, slow/low aircraft handling,
   AIM-9/LASTE employment, anti-helicopter tactics and techniques, and training rules.
   6.10.4. Anti-Helicopter Flying Training. This upgrade consists of two missions flown in sequence
   and is supervised by an anti-helicopter-certified IP/supervisor. UPs must complete all mission tasks
   prior to certification, regardless of the number of missions required. UPs must be current and qualified
   in ACBT and LOW A/A.
       6.10.4.1. BFM-H. 1v1 Helicopter. Mission Objectives: Practice BFM and employment tech-
       niques to kill a slow-speed target. Specific Mission Tasks: Weapons systems checks, A/A employ-
       ment at various closure velocities and aspect angles against a slow-speed target simulated by an
       A-10. Helicopter BFM: ranging exercises, aspect and angle off determination, maneuvering to
       gain and maintain the advantage, weapons selection and employment, defensive maneuvers, flare
       and ECM usage, re-attacks and separations. NOTE: Demonstrate proficiency at 5,000 feet AGL
       and 1,000 feet AGL before progressing to lower altitudes.
       6.10.4.2. ACM-H. 2v1 Helicopter. Mission Objectives: Practice mutual support contracts and
       employment to kill a slow-speed target. Specific Mission Tasks: Visual search techniques, ele-
       ment coordination/radio calls, threat recognition and formation defensive maneuvering, flare and
       ECM usage, mutual support maneuvering, weapons selection and employment, re-attacks, and
       element separation. NOTE: Demonstrate proficiency at 1,000 feet AGL before progressing to
       lower altitudes.

6.11. Contingency/Exercise Spin-up Training.
   6.11.1. Units will conduct this training prior to deploying in support of contingency operations (if
   time permits) or exercises. For contingency operations, units will contact appropriate gaining com-
   mand/operations to determine expected mission tasking. For exercises, units will refer to appropriate
   EXPLANS and contact exercise POCs prior to deployment. These EXPLANS include COMACC
   EXPLANS 80 for Red, Green, Maple, and Coalition Flags, EXPLANS 323 for Air Warrior I, and
60                                                               AFI11-2A-OA-10V1 31 AUGUST 2006


     EXPLANS 163 for Air Warrior II. OG/CCs will tailor this spin-up training for the theater, threat, and
     tactics for the assigned task. SQ/CCs are then responsible for implementing this spin-up, prosecuting
     the required missions, and determining the specific requirements necessary to reach the desired level
     of proficiency. Place emphasis on training needed for missions not accomplished in daily operations.
     This training will be conducted IAW all applicable instructions.
     6.11.2. Pilots not directly assigned to the deploying squadron must also receive spin-up training as
     determined by the deploying SQ/CC. This applies to attached pilots and pilots augmenting from other
     squadrons. The objective of this training is to ensure non-assigned pilots are proficient to conduct all
     missions in support of expected tasking. The deploying SQ/CC will determine the amount of spin-up
     training required for each non-assigned pilot based on the pilot's level of proficiency, currency, quali-
     fication, and experience. For each augmenting pilot, the pilot’s assigned SQ/CC is responsible to
     ensure the spin-up training is accomplished.
     6.11.3. OG/CCs will ensure all participating pilots are ready to deploy and are proficient to conduct
     all missions in support of expected tasking.
     6.11.4. Ground Training. All pilots will complete applicable ground training as necessary prior to
     their support of contingency operations or exercises.
        6.11.4.1. Academics. Units will brief exercise SPINS, ROE/Training Rules, command and con-
        trol, engagement authority and procedures, and visual identification. MAJCOM/IN will assist the
        unit's intelligence functions in developing threat assessments and visual recognition training mate-
        rials.
        6.11.4.2. Visual Recognition. Pilots must be able to visually identify rotary and fixed-wing air-
        craft, including joint/allied assets, they are likely to encounter by name or numerical designator
        and determine whether the aircraft is a threat or non-threat. Training should incorporate all
        aspects/angles, theater-specific paint schemes/fin flashes, and various configurations. Identify
        ground equipment, and determine major categories of naval vessels.
     6.11.5. Flight Training. Tailor spin-up training to ensure all supporting pilots are proficient, current,
     and qualified in all expected mission taskings.

(D)ACT (AFI 11-214).
Air Combat Tactics (ACT)—Training in the application of BFM, ACM, and tactical intercept skills to
achieve a tactical air-to-air objective (AFI 11-214).
Certification—The process to train and certify a pilot for specific tactical employment capabilities,
special weapons capabilities, procedures, and rules. Similar to a pilot qualification, but not involving a
flight evaluation.
Circular Error—Miss distance of a given weapon impact expressed in radial distance from center of
target.
Cockpit Familiarization Trainer (CFT)—A training device in which the controls, switches, and
instruments do not have to respond to trainee inputs. Used for checklist familiarity and practice of normal
procedures and emergency procedures (AFP 50-11).

to respond to trainee inputs. Used for safety of flight, instrument, normal, and emergency procedures
training (AFP 50-11).
74                                                              AFI11-2A-OA-10V1 31 AUGUST 2006


Combat Edge—A positive-pressure breathing-for-G (PPG) system which provides aircrew additional
protection against high positive G accelerations experienced during flight. The system consists of aircrew
equipment (high-pressure mask, counter-pressure suit, G-suit), and aircraft equipment (oxygen regulator,
G-valve, and interfacing sense line). As G-forces increase, regulated air and oxygen are supplied to the
system to provide automatic mask tensioning, vest inflation, and positive pressure breathing to the mask.
Continuation Training (CT)—Training to maintain proficiency and improve pilot capabilities to
perform unit missions. CT includes pilot proficiency sorties not flown in formal syllabus missions, tests,
or evaluations and is applicable to CMR and BMC pilots.
Counter Drug (CD) Training—Training to maintain proficiency in day/night intercepts on slow/
low-flying aircraft, with emphasis on target identification and shadowing procedures.
Currency—The minimum frequency required to perform an event or mission safely.
Delivery Parameters—Weapons-related data reflecting current delivery considerations for proper
ordnance function and tactical survivability. Appropriate aircraft/weapons technical orders must be
consulted for live ordnance safe escape criteria and aircraft performance charts for recovery altitudes.
Dissimilar ACBT (DACBT)—ACBT in conjunction with another MDS aircraft as adversary and
correspond to all facets of ACBT (i.e., BFM, ACM, ACT). The designation (D)ACBT refers to either
similar or dissimilar ACBT.
Emergency Procedures Evaluation (EPE)—An evaluation of a pilot’s knowledge and responsiveness
to critical and non-critical EPs conducted by a SEFE in an approved aircraft simulator or cockpit.
Experienced Pilot (EXP)—A pilot who has flown the aircraft for a specified number of hours, which
then permits training at a reduced rate to maintain a safe level of proficiency (AFI 11-412). Unit manning
levels and assignment decisions are based on pilot experience. Hours logged in the FMT accomplishing
approved training events will be counted as hours when determining experience level.
Flight Lead (FL)—As designated on flight orders, the pilot responsible for overall mission conduct from
preflight preparation and briefing to post-flight debriefing, regardless of actual position within the
formation. A 2-ship FL is authorized to lead an element in a larger formation. If approved by the SQ/CC,
a 4-ship FL is considered a multi-ship FL and may lead formations and missions in excess of four aircraft.
Full Mission Trainer (FMT)—A training device that dynamically simulates flight characteristics in real
time. Used for normal, emergency, and instrument procedures, to include safety of flight, warfighting
tasks, and skills-integration training (AFP 50-11).
Full Scale Weapons Delivery (FSWD)—Delivery of live or inert ordnance that represents a typical
combat configuration in a tactical scenario.
Initial Qualification Training (IQT)—Formal training to qualify a pilot in general aircraft flying duties
without full regard to any particular unit's operational mission. Completion of IQT is the minimum
requirement for BAQ status. IQT provides an aircraft instrument and qualification certificate, and
prepares the pilot for follow-on mission qualification and specialized training.
Joint Air Attack Team (JAAT)—Coordinated CAS with helicopters.
Killer Scout (KS) Operations—The employment of armed attack fighters in an Interdiction or Strategic
Attack scenario for a specified geographic location flown to validate tasked targets, mark targets, and
direct dedicated ground attack fighters against lucrative targets. Killer Scouts are normally used as part of
AFI11-2A-OA-10V1 31 AUGUST 2006                                                                          75


the C3I interface, to coordinate flights, identify or neutralize targets and enemy air defenses, and provide
Bomb Damage Assessment (BDA).
Limited-Threat VID—Visual identification of a bogey in a limited threat environment, such as during
counter-drug operations or NORAD procedures (IAW AFTTP 3-1).
Low Altitude Training (LOWAT, LOW A/A, LOW ALT)—Tactical training operations in a certified
low altitude block, which is divided into Low Altitude Step-Down Training (LASDT) categories. This
tactical training does not apply to traffic pattern operations or other basic transitions through the
low-altitude structure. A LOWAT event involves performing realistic, mission-oriented low altitude
operations while in a LOWAT-certified low altitude block, in which pilots practice realistic reactions to
air and ground threats. LOWAT is divided into two currencies/events, LOW A/A and LOW ALT. LOW
A/A events include skills necessary to search for and engage an aerial target at low altitude offensively or
defensively. LOW ALT events include LATN, LATF, defensive maneuvering to avoid or negate ground
threats, and low altitude WD.
Low Altitude Intercept (LAI)—An intercept conducted below 5,000 feet AGL.
Low Altitude Tactical Formation (LATF)—Flying tactical formation while navigating in the
low-altitude structure (AFI 11-214).
Low Altitude Tactical Navigation (LATN)—A low altitude training event using onboard systems, dead
reckoning and point-to-point low altitude navigation, with or without prior route planning (AFI 11-214).
Medium Altitude Tactics—Day or night tactical formation above 5,000 feet AGL. Tactics include
ingress to a target area, employment (actual or simulated) of ordnance using appropriate delivery
parameters, and egress away from the target area with mutual support.
Mission Qualification Training (MQT)—Training required to achieve the required level of competence
in a unit's primary-tasked missions. This training follows IQT and is a prerequisite for CMR/BMC status.
MQT provides an aircraft mission qualification certificate, and allows the pilot to prepare for follow-on
specialized training.
Operational Flight Trainer (OFT)—A training device which dynamically simulates flight
characteristics in real time. Used for normal, emergency, and instrument procedures, to include safety of
flight, warfighting tasks, and skill integration training (AFP 50-11).
Primary Aircraft Inventory (PAI)—Aircraft authorized for performance of the operational mission.
PAI forms the basis for Primary Aircraft Allocation (PAA), which provides operating resources of
manpower, support equipment, and flying-hour funds. The operating command determines the PAI
required to meet their assigned missions (AFI 16-402).
Proficiency—Demonstrated ability for a pilot to successfully accomplish a flying event safely and
effectively. For purposes of this instruction, proficiency also requires any applicable currency for the
event.
Situational Emergency Procedures Training (SEPT)—A periodic review, discussion, and practice of
aircraft systems operations/limitations and abnormal/emergency procedures based on realistic scenarios.
Specialized Training—Training in additional flight responsibilities, tactics, and weapons systems, such
as FL, IP, FAC(A), TGP, and CSAR. Specialized training provides CMR/BMC pilots with advanced
qualifications and certifications to support the unit’s mission tasking. This training follows MQT as pilot

skills and proficiency warrant. Although specialized training is related to pilot experience in the aircraft,
it is not based solely on flying hours and remains in the judgment of the commander.
Squadron Supervisor—Squadron Commander (SQ/CC), Operations Officers and Assistants (SQ/DO/
ADO), and Flight CCs (FLT/CC). (ANG/AFRC: as designated by the OG/CC)
Tactical Deception—Any activity designed to mislead the enemy operational commander by
manipulating, distorting, or falsifying evidence, thereby inducing the enemy to act in a manner favorable
to friendly forces (AFI 10-704).
Tactics and Training Range (TTR)—Sites capable of Radar Bomb Scoring (RBS), EC range training
and special training (also called radar bomb scoring).
Threat VID—Visual identification of a bogey in a threat environment (AFTTP 3-1).
Unit Training Device (UTD)—A unit-level training device that dynamically simulates flight
characteristics in real time. Used for normal, emergency, and instrument procedures, to include safety of
flight, warfighting tasks, and skill integration training (AFP 50-11).
Verification—A unit briefing for pilots to update and verify tactical knowledge required to accomplish
the unit’s wartime mission tasking. Verification includes initial and continuation phases in which a formal
board is convened to assess pilot knowledge of tactical employment.
Visual Identification (VID)—Procedures to positively identify an aircraft using visual means.
Weapons and Tactics Trainer (WTT)—A part-task training device used primarily for warfighting
tasks, and skill integration training (AFP 50-11).

                     GLOSSARY OF MISSION AND EVENT DEFINITIONS


A2.1. Mission Definitions.
   A2.1.1. Air Combat Maneuvers (ACM) Mission. Building-block demanding mission. 2v1 (or
   greater) training mission designed to achieve proficiency in element formation maneuvering and the
   coordinated application of BFM to achieve a simulated kill or effectively defend against one or more
   aircraft from a pre-planned starting position (AFI 11-214).
   A2.1.2. Aircraft Handling Characteristics (AHC) Sortie. Basic-skills non-demanding sortie.
   Training for proficiency in utilization and exploitation of the aircraft flight envelope, consistent with
   operational and safety constraints, including, but not limited to: high/maximum AOA maneuvering,
   energy management, minimum-time turns, maximum/optimum acceleration and deceleration tech-
   niques and confidence maneuvers (AFI 11-214).
   A2.1.3. Attrition Sortie. A sortie planned and launched as a RAP training mission, basic skills
   “non-RAP” sortie/mission, or collateral sortie, which due to some circumstance (weather, malfunc-
   tion, maintenance, etc.) fails to accomplish the planned mission. It is imperative that units log these
   sorties properly. Incorrect accounting of these sorties will result in improper sortie allocation, stresses
   to the unit schedule, and negative impacts to the quality of unit training programs.
   A2.1.4. Basic Fighter Maneuvers (BFM) Mission. Building-block demanding mission. 1v1 train-
   ing mission designed to apply aircraft handling skills to gain proficiency in recognizing and solving
   range, closure, aspect, angle off, and turning room problems in relation to another aircraft to either
   attain a position from which weapons may be launched or defeat weapons employed by an adversary
   (AFI 11-214).
   A2.1.5. Basic Surface Attack, Day (BSA) Mission. Building-block non-demanding mission. Train-
   ing designed to achieve proficiency in day air-to-surface weapons delivery events.
   A2.1.6. Basic Surface Attack, Night (NSA/BSA-NT) Mission. Building-block demanding mis-
   sion. Training designed to achieve proficiency in night air-to-surface weapons delivery events. NSA/
   BSA-NT non-tactical training is considered non-demanding for the purposes of NVG training cur-
   rency.
   A2.1.7. Close Air Support (CAS) Mission. Day/night demanding mission. Mission flown in sup-
   port of ground forces under the positive control of a JTAC/FAC(A). Mission elements include: intel
   scenario, tactical mission planning, interface with the TACS/AAGS network, execution against
   threats, and weapons employment against JTAC/FAC(A)-designated targets. Except for the role of a
   JTAC/FAC(A), mission elements and roles may be simulated during training.
   A2.1.8. Collateral Sorties. Sorties not directly related to combat employment or basic skills training
   but necessary for accomplishment of squadron programs, such as ferry flights, deployments, incentive
   flights, orientation flights, airshows, aircraft functional tests/checks, etc. MAJCOMs will normally
   assign collateral sorties in lump sum, adjusted for local conditions and circumstances. These sorties
   are not required for RAP training purposes.

     A2.1.9. Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR) Mission/Event. Special-capability demanding mis-
     sion/event. A specific mission/event performed by rescue forces to recover distressed personnel dur-
     ing war or military operations other than war. Mission elements include: Intel scenario and mission
     planning, actual or simulated interface with Theater Air Control System (TACS) C2 network, elec-
     tronic and visual search patterns and procedures, identification and authentication of survivor, target
     marking, ordnance selection, positive control of ground attack fighters employing simulated or actual
     ordinance against designated threats to survivor, identification and neutralization of ingress and egress
     route enemy air defenses, rescue force protection (including rendezvous, escort, and hover cover),
     Battle Damage Assessment (BDA), and in-flight report.
     A2.1.10. Commander Option Missions. An allotment of missions to each pilot for allocation at
     commander’s discretion in support of training requirements and unit objectives. Commander Option
     missions are part of the pilot’s overall training cycle sortie allotment and may be designated uniquely
     for each pilot or generally for all in the unit. IAW the RAP Tasking memo, units will allocate Com-
     mander Option missions to any mission type, which then credits each pilot’s individual training
     requirements for those missions. Units may also designate a mission type labeled “Commander
     Option” in which pilots log the directed training. This allows maximum flexibility for commanders to
     allocate and define the missions throughout the training cycle.
     A2.1.11. Contingency Mission. A mission tasked and flown while deployed for a contingency oper-
     ation in which training is limited. This type of mission is logged as a Contingency Operations Mission
     (SC13) in ARMS. These missions and the events accomplished do not count towards training cycle
     requirements, which are prorated accordingly; however, the missions may be used for lookback and
     the events may update currencies.
     A2.1.12. Demanding Mission. Missions that task the pilot to the extent that flying frequency and
     continuity are most critical. Missions and events requiring demanding mission currency are: BFM,
     (D)ACM, (D)ACT, LOWAT (below 1,000 feet AGL), CAS, SAT, CFTR, JFT, night, instructor
     duties, aerial demonstrations, etc. SQ/CCs may add missions/events to the demanding mission list,
     depending on unit tasking and pilot capabilities. See Non-Demanding Mission. EXCEPTION: A dry,
     level pass at or above 500 feet AGL, followed by limited maneuvering (IAW AFI 11-214), is consid-
     ered a non-demanding event. This definition does not apply to NVG Demanding currency as specified
     by the Night Mission type.
     A2.1.13. Flight Lead (FL) Mission. Special-capability mission. Mission where the FL maintains
     control of a flight of two or more aircraft. May be logged in conjunction with baseline training
     requirements. 2-ship FLs (2FL) are limited to leading two aircraft in a formation, while 4-ship FLs
     (4FL) may lead larger formations of three or more.
     A2.1.14. Forward Air Control (Airborne) (FAC(A)) Mission. S p e c i a l - c a p a b i l i t y d a y / n i g h t
     demanding mission. Mission flown to provide Air Strike Control (ASC) of armed attack fighters in
     support of actual or simulated ground forces. Mission elements include: Intel scenario and mission
     planning, actual or simulated interface with Theater Air Control System/Army Air-to-Ground System
     (TACS/AAGS) C2 network, target acquisition and identification, FAC-to-fighter 9-line brief, target
     marking, positive control of ground attack fighters employing simulated or actual ordnance against
     designated targets, integration of ground and heliborne fire support elements, identification and neu-
     tralization of enemy air defenses, BDA, and in-flight report.
AFI11-2A-OA-10V1 31 AUGUST 2006                                                                          79


   A2.1.15. Instructor Pilot (IP) Mission. Special-capability demanding mission. Mission in which an
   IP instructs another pilot during a building-block mission (BFM, ACM, BSA), MQT, FLUG, IPUG,
   or any mission where IP duties preclude effective combat mission training. An IP mission is not
   dual-logged with another RAP mission.
   A2.1.16. Instrument Sortie. Basic-skills non-demanding sortie. Non-RAP training designed to
   ensure instrument proficiency. RAP events may be accomplished on an Instrument sortie provided
   accomplishment does not interfere with the primary goal of instrument training. Units are allocated
   sorties for every pilot to accomplish their non-RAP requirements and maintain minimum basic skills.
   A2.1.17. Mission Commander (MCC) Mission. Special-capability demanding mission. Mission
   where a pilot acts in the capacity of an MCC for a joint/composite mission responsible for two or more
   types of aircraft with four or more total aircraft, or more than four own MDS aircraft versus a mini-
   mum of two pre-planned adversary aircraft. MCC missions may be logged in conjunction with base-
   line training requirements.
   A2.1.18. Night Mission. A mission on which either takeoff or landing and at least 50 percent of
   flight duration or one hour, whichever is less, occur between the end of evening twilight and the
   beginning of morning civil twilight, as published in the American Air Almanac, converted to local
   time. A night mission is considered an overall demanding mission type; however, individual non-tac-
   tical events are considered non-demanding for the purposes of NVG training currency.
   A2.1.19. Non-Demanding Mission. A day mission that provides the pilot with the opportunity to
   regain basic flying proficiency after a period of non-flying. Events in this mission will not excessively
   task pilot skills that have been underused. Authorized missions/events flown on a non-demanding
   mission are: Instruments, AHC, BSA, LATN/LATF above 500 feet AGL, and dry level passes fol-
   lowed by limited maneuvering (IAW AFI 11-214) at or above 500 feet AGL. SQ/CCs may delete mis-
   sions/events from this non-demanding mission list, depending on unit tasking and the individual's
   capabilities. See Demanding Mission.
   A2.1.20. Surface Attack Tactics (SAT) Mission. Basic-capability day/night demanding mission.
   Mission designed to develop tactical surface attack proficiency. Mission elements include: mission
   planning, execution with actual or simulated threats, and weapons delivery IAW unit taskings, simu-
   lating UCML munitions, and SCLs against a tactical target during the day. Simulated attacks may be
   conducted against realistic targets IAW local restrictions. Missions types include: Strategic Attack,
   Air Interdiction (AI), Offensive Counterair Air-to-Surface (OCA-S), and Suppression of Enemy Air
   Defenses-Conventional (SEAD-C).

A2.2. Events Definition. Unless otherwise specified in these event descriptions, units will determine the
necessary parameters for fulfilling and/or logging tasked events. An event is defined in one of the follow-
ing manners:
   A2.2.1. Accomplishment of a specific training element, function, or task.
   A2.2.2. A specific type of weapon delivery performed during a mission, defined by aircraft flight
   path, ordnance delivered, delivery method, or target struck.
   A2.2.3. Expending ordnance against a target according to predetermined flight path parameters and
   delivery methods. A single delivery constitutes an event except for some strafe events, which require
   satisfaction of additional criteria.
80                                                                AFI11-2A-OA-10V1 31 AUGUST 2006


A2.3. Weapons Delivery Events.
     A2.3.1. A delivery is defined as a pass at a target on which ordnance is expended or simulated or
     meets the criteria defining a specific weapon delivery. Weapon events are defined in Chapter 5. All
     deliveries will be recorded, but not necessarily as a record delivery. The two types of deliveries are as
     follows:
        A2.3.1.1. Basic Delivery. A delivery using a conventional box pattern. It may be used as a record
        event only for initial qualification. There is no restriction on the number of dry passes made before
        or during basic deliveries in a record event for initial qualification; however, only the first two
        deliveries per event may count for record.
        A2.3.1.2. Tactical Delivery. A delivery using patterns and techniques that minimize final flight
        path predictability, yet allow sufficient time for accurate weapons delivery. When a tactical deliv-
        ery is flown for record, dry passes in the event are not permitted before or during the event. Wings
        level time on final is limited to five seconds when the aircraft will descend below 4,500 feet AGL,
        except for level, LGB, MAV, and climbing deliveries. Timing will be from completion of roll-out
        until initiation of weapons release and exceeding five seconds will result in gross error. All tactical
        deliveries will normally include recovery to egress parameters.
     A2.3.2. A delivery constitutes a Weapons Delivery Event based on two categories, record keeping
     (Record or Non-Record), and RAP tasking (FAM and QUAL), as follows:
        A2.3.2.1. Record Keeping.
            A2.3.2.1.1. Non-Record. Weapons delivery accomplishments not credited toward weapons
            qualification provided the pilot declares “non-record” prior to beginning the event.
            A2.3.2.1.2. Record. Weapons delivery scored for individual qualification. Scoring shall be
            accomplished by ground, air, or mission tape (for guided weapons), as appropriate. A maxi-
            mum of two record deliveries may be credited during a mission from a single run-in heading.
            Additional record deliveries may be accomplished from headings differing by at least 90
            degrees or on different targets/ranges. Record deliveries may not be preceded by non-record
            deliveries in the event on the same sortie. The first two deliveries in each event will be consid-
            ered record unless otherwise declared prior to the roll-in to final. Additional guidelines are:
                A2.3.2.1.2.1. Basic. Must be scored on a Class A range (IAW AFI 13-212V1/2/3).
                A2.3.2.1.2.2. Tactical. A minimum of 50 percent must be accomplished on a ground
                scored range, except for simulated precision munition events. Remaining record hits may
                be air scored by reference to known distances from the target.
                A2.3.2.1.2.3. Strafe. Aircraft rounds limiter will be set to total number of rounds for the
                planned strafe events. A minimum of 50 rounds per strafe event must be set and expended
                to satisfy RAP strafe requirements. See paragraph 5.5.1.
                A2.3.2.1.2.4. LGB. Designator and bomber functions are accomplished simultaneously
                by a single aircraft using self-lase procedures. To record a complete LGB delivery using
                buddy-lase designation techniques, one simulated or actual weapons release and one des-
                ignation must be performed, if authorized by the SQ/CC.
                A2.3.2.1.2.5. Maverick. May be scored by mission tape or TGM missile-mounted cam-
                era.
AFI11-2A-OA-10V1 31 AUGUST 2006                                                                         81


     A2.3.2.2. RAP Tasking. See current RAP Tasking memo for training cycle requirements.
         A2.3.2.2.1. FAM. Weapons events tasked at FAM may be basic/tactical record deliveries.
         Each single hot pass counts as one delivery. Hit percentage criteria for FAM events is not
         specified and is tracked at unit’s discretion.
         A2.3.2.2.2. QUAL. Weapons events tasked at QUAL must be tactical, record deliveries.
         QUAL tasking demonstrates the pilot's ability to put appropriate ordnance on target. Unless
         otherwise specified in the RAP Tasking memo or formal course syllabi, Chapter 5 establishes
         QUAL criteria for each event.
  A2.3.3. Miscellaneous definitions of weapons deliveries and events.
     A2.3.3.1. Dry Pass. Weapons delivery pass during which no ordnance is expended. Such dry
     passes prior to completion of record deliveries in an event are charged to the pilot as gross error
     unless the pass was dry because of safety considerations, system malfunctions, basic delivery
     requirements, or directed for flight integrity purposes.
     A2.3.3.2. Foul. A penalty directed to a specific aircraft and pilot for actions inconsistent with
     established procedures or safety considerations. A foul will result in a gross error for that delivery
     (except non-accousti-scored strafe which will be penalized one-half the event score). A second
     foul or any dangerous pass will result in mandatory expulsion from any further deliveries during
     that mission and a gross error score for the event. A foul will be charged IAW flying directive pub-
     lications. Verbal warnings do not constitute a foul.
     A2.3.3.3. Full Scale Weapons Delivery. Delivery of live or inert ordnance representing a typical
     combat configuration or SCL in a tactical scenario.
     A2.3.3.4. Gross Error. A penalty score or miss assigned to a pilot's records when a weapons
     delivery attempt results in: munitions impact outside the range scoring capability, a chargeable dry
     pass, a foul, an unintentional release, or exceeding tactical delivery time on final requirements.
     A2.3.3.5. Hit. Any munitions impact within the weapons criteria established for that event.
     A2.3.3.6. Multiple or Unexpected Release. More than one weapon released against the same
     target on a single pass or a weapon released without approval, and assessed as follows:
         A2.3.3.6.1. Intentional. Predetermined multiple ordnance release. The pilot will advise the
         range officer prior to delivery and may designate which impact to score.
         A2.3.3.6.2. System Malfunction. Undeclared multiple release caused by a verified system
         malfunction. Score is void after the system malfunction is verified, otherwise unintentional
         rules apply.
         A2.3.3.6.3. Inadvertent. Unexpected ordnance release by the aircraft, uncommanded by the
         pilot. Impact will not be scored.
         A2.3.3.6.4. Unintentional. Unexpected ordnance released due to pilot error. Scored as a
         gross error regardless of impact point.
     A2.3.3.7. No Spot. A weapons release during which no impact was observed. No score or error
     will be assigned.
82                                                               AFI11-2A-OA-10V1 31 AUGUST 2006


        A2.3.3.8. Void Delivery. Weapons delivery not successfully completed due to a documented and
        verified weapons system malfunction, a pass aborted for safety, no spot, or circumstances beyond
        the control of the pilot.

A2.4. Tactical Events. The alphabetical listing of tactical events below will be used for fulfilling tasked
requirements. In the absence of guidance, units will determine the content of tasked events and how often
they may be logged.
     A2.4.1. ACMI Event. An event that utilizes an ACMI range/facilities for flight and debrief. Only
     one event may be logged per mission.
     A2.4.2. Air Strike Control (ASC) Event. Special-capability demanding event. A Forward Air Con-
     trol (Airborne) mission event that involves the control of armed attack fighters in support of actual or
     simulated ground forces. Types of controls are divided into Type I, Type II, and Type III, which are
     defined in Joint Publication 3-09.3. IAW the current JCAS FAC(A) MOA, FAC(A)s will perform two
     controls to update ASC currency. No more than two controls may be logged per CAS target or 9-line
     briefing. FAC(A)s will satisfy ASC currency and event requirements by training with actual fighters
     and TACPs to the maximum extent possible. Failing to meet either proficiency or currency will result
     in FAC(A) pilots being non-qualified.
     A2.4.3. Air Refueling (AR) Event. Requires tanker rendezvous, hook-up and transfer of fuel or two
     minutes of dry contact. More than one event may be credited if receivers accomplish another rendez-
     vous, hook-up and fuel transfer/dry contact.

84                                                               AFI11-2A-OA-10V1 31 AUGUST 2006


     A2.4.24. Pave Penny Event. Event in which the pilot uses Pave Penny as a primary method to con-
     firm target location. Training in a tactical scenario incorporating a JTAC and JLASER terminology is
     highly desired; however, conventional patterns may be flown due to range restrictions/equipment lim-
     itations. Only one event may be logged per mission.
     A2.4.25. SEAD-C. A tactical event employing simulated or actual conventional munitions against
     any portion of a simulated air defense system, to include SAMs, AAA, GCI, and integrated systems.

     ful utilization during tactical mission accomplishment. Only one event may be logged per mission.
     A2.4.27. Targeting Pod (TGP) Event. Event designed to achieve proficiency in the employment of
     targeting pods. Includes any event where the TGP is used for target search/identification, target desig-
     nation/track/mark, simulated/actual weapon guidance, or coordinate generation.
     A2.4.28. Target Mark. A tactical event used in conjunction with a FAC(A)/CSAR target briefing
     and final Air Strike Control. A target mark includes actual expenditure of rockets, strafe, and illumi-
     nation flares, and directing of lasers and IR pointers to mark or illuminate a target. Only one event
     may be logged per target marked. Multiple marks on the same target should integrate different fighters
     or a new target briefing to the maximum extent practical. For FAC(A) training, strafe or BDU-33s are
     considered secondary to rockets as a visual method for target marking and should be used on a limited
     basis if rockets are not readily available.
     A2.4.29. Visual Reconnaissance. An event during which surveillance of an area or lines of commu-
     nication is conducted, leading to the timely acquisition of information or enemy activities. It encom-
     passes map reading, basic navigational techniques, recognition of terrain features, pilotage, and DR.
     Only two events may be logged per mission.
