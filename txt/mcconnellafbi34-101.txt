OPR: 22 SVS/HG (TSgt Tolley)                                Certified by: 22 SVS/CC (Lt Col Leathers)
Supersedes AFR 900-37, MAFB Sup 1,                                                         Pages: 11

This instruction establishes policies, procedures, and responsibilities for recognizing and providing an
Honor Guard (HG) Team to represent McConnell Air Force Base (MAFB) at Military Funerals and Cere-
monies for authorized personnel, Formal Retreats, Honor Cordons for arrival and departure of distin-
guished visitors, and other details/functions as directed by AFI 34-242, Mortuary Affairs Program. This
instruction applies to all elements of the 22d Air Refueling Wing (ARW) stationed at MAFB, including
tenant units.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This document is completely revised and must be reviewed in its entirety.


1. Responsibilities.
   1.1. Military Funeral Honors (MFH) must be provided for all deceased Air Force active duty, retired,
   and veterans in accordance with AFI 34-242, Mortuary Affairs Program.
   1.2. The 22 ARW Commander oversees the program, enforces AFI 34-242, and determines the size
   of the HG Team. Installation location, population, and how often military and civil protocol activities
   occur, will determine manning requirements.
       1.2.1. MAFB HG should be manned with volunteers from the base. In the event a sufficient num-
       ber of volunteers is not available to meet demands, selection of members will be made from each
       squadron based on guidelines set forth in para 1.2.2.
       1.2.2. The Wing Commander designates the required HG Team end-strength. Divide the
       end-strength by the number of participating squadrons to get the percentage for each squadron's
       quota. Example: current Wing Commander directed end-strength is 62. There are 21 participating
       squadrons on base: 62 divided by 21 equals 2.95--so each participating squadron's quota is 3% of
       their E-6 and below. For example, if a squadron has 232 personnel in the ranks of E-6 and below,
2                                                        MCCONNELLAFBI34-101 3 MARCH 2004


       their quota is 7 personnel (multiply 232 by 3%). Due to the full-time commitment, the Noncom-
       missioned Officer in Charge (NCOIC) will fill three slots. All other personnel will account for one
       slot.
       1.2.3. Group Commanders may exceed their tasking requirement if there are highly motivated
       volunteers available. If the HG Commander (HGC) cannot satisfy the requirement whenever an
       officer is required to accompany the detail, he/she will request another officer from 22 ARW
       resources.
    1.3. The MAFB HG is managed by the 22d Services Squadron Commander (SVS/CC) for adminis-
    trative and operational control. An HGC and HG/NCOIC will supervise the team.
    1.4. HG members will not be assigned to squadron or base details (except bay orderly) and, if possi-
    ble, will not be assigned to night shift duty. Personnel on the HG Team will be released from duty dur-
    ing base exercises to perform MFH or Memorial Services only. All other details/functions are
    secondary.
    1.5. Funeral Officers will be selected by the HGC with approval of the 22 SVS/CC.
    1.6. If an HG Member receives a NO-SHOW for two consecutive practices, strong consideration will
    be given for dismissal from the team. The same applies for one NO-SHOW for a detail/function.
    1.7. All HG Members may be authorized to receive BAS because of special details. It is at the discre-
    tion of the HG Member's Commander if they receive BAS based on the criteria of DFAS-DEM
    177-373 V2, Defense Joint Military Pay System (DJMS)-Unit Procedures Excluding FSO.
    1.8. Sufficient HG equipment will be obtained, maintained, and controlled by 22 SVS to meet the
    requirement set forth in AFI 34-242. This equipment should include, but not limited to the following:
       1.8.1. M-14 Rifles - Serviceable weapons (with back-up weapons to allow for repairs) to equip
       two, seven-member firing parties. Sufficient quantity of blank ammunition will be available to
       provide honors training and ceremonial requirements. M-14 rifles and 7.62MM caliber blank
       ammunition used by the HG, will be stored in the HG facility in accordance with AFI 31-209, The
       Air Force Resource Protection Program, Air Force Handbook 31-223, The Air Force Resource
       Protection Program; DOD 5100.76-M, Physical Security of Sensitive Conventional Arms and
       Ammunition, and Explosives; Mil-Hdbk-1013/1, Military Handbook, Design Guidelines for
       Physical Security of Fixed Land-Based Facilities.

2. Duties.
    2.1. The 22 SVS/CC will:
       2.1.1. Be responsible to the 22 ARW/CC, for the overall operation, maintenance, proficiency, and

       2.1.3. Ensure the HGC and HG/NCOIC are completely knowledgeable of his/her responsibilities
       as outlined in AFI 34-242, Mortuary Affairs Program.
       2.1.4. Validate each request for MFH for active duty. If requests are valid, coordinate function
       with the HGC and HG/NCOIC. Delegate validation for MFH for retirees and veterans to HGC/HG

     mendation of the HGC and HG/NCOIC, advise the HG Member's Commander in writing of the
     circumstances leading to the termination and request an immediate replacement.
  2.4. Flight/Detail OIC/NCOIC will:

   resources. If sufficient time does not warrant a written request, verbal contact with the Services Com-
   mander is permissible. The verbal request will be followed by a written request. The Public Affairs
   Office will validate each request with the HGC or HG/NCOIC before the team is committed.

3. Tour Of Duty:
   3.1. Squadron Commanders/First Sergeants will personally interview each volunteer with the final
   decision made by the HGC or HG/NCOIC.
   3.2. Each HG Member is required to remain on the MAFB HG for a minimum of 1 year. Prior to expi-
   ration of the term of the member's one-year service, the HG/NCOIC will re-accomplish the member's
   appointment letter if desired by the HG Member, or request a replacement individual through the
   respective Squadron Commander. In the event of PCS or hardship, which precludes the HG Member
   from serving his/her full term, the respective Squadron Commander will replace the member (30 days
   in advance to allow for proper training and orientation, if possible).
   3.3. Any disciplinary action (Article 15, Control Roster, UIF, etc.) or non-progression of upgrade
   training will result in immediate removal from the HG Team. An HG Member may be reinstated at
   any time with the approval of the HG Member's First Sergeant and the HGC and HG/NCOIC.
   3.4. Personnel on a shaving waiver or Phase 1 of the Weight Management Program will not be
   assigned to the HG Team. This will also be justification for a member's replacement.

4. Training.
   4.1. Mandatory training will be held on Friday, three times per month. Two training days will be from
   0730-1130 and the third session will be from 0730-1630. There will be no HG training on wing train-
   ing/run days and the next available training day will be a full training day (0730-1630). In the event
   the Friday after the wing training/run day is a Federal holiday two things can occur. The full training
6                                                         MCCONNELLAFBI34-101 3 MARCH 2004


    day will be the week prior to the wing training/run day or the following Friday after the holiday. Those
    decisions/training sessions will be posted months in advance based upon that yearâ€™s calendar. Each
    session will be long enough to allow for proper training and briefing. The HGC or HG/NCOIC will
    determine if more training is needed for HG Members.
    4.2. Training will include the following areas:
       4.2.1. Color Guard - To include proper positioning of flags, close interval marching, turning with
       the flags, and posting and retiring procedures.
       4.2.2. Firing Party - To include training in the use and care of the M-14 rifle, rifle commands,
       loading and firing, and positions in which the rifles are to be held.
       4.2.3. Flag Fold - To include proper respect to the flag, positions of flag folders, procedures for
       folding the flag, and for presentation to the Next of Kin.
       4.2.4. Pallbearers - To include casket movement to and from the carrier (hearse), marching with
       the casket, casket placement at the gravesite, and honorary pallbearer duties.
    4.3. The HG will be composed of two flights. Each flight will be on call one month at a time. Each
    flight will utilize the "one month on/one month off" system.
       4.3.1. Each commander, first sergeant, member and supervisor will receive a copy of the duty/
       training schedule.

5. Weapons Handling.
    5.1. Upon arrival at the detail site, the firing party NCOIC will issue one weapon, one ammunition
    clip containing three rounds of blank ammunition to each member of the firing party. The weapons
    will be cleared and the safety placed in the "SAFE" position. Weapons will remain in the "SAFE"
    position at all times, except during actual firing party volleys. Prior to insertion of the loaded clip,
    each member of the firing party will visually inspect their clip to ensure each round is blank ammuni-
    tion.
    5.2. After the ceremony and all elements have marched away from the gravesite, the weapons will be
    unloaded, cleared, and returned to the storage container. Unused blank ammunition will be invento-
    ried by the flight OIC/NCOIC to determine the number of rounds expended. All expended casings
    will be policed from the ceremonial site and returned to the Base HGC/NCOIC for turn-in to conven-
    tional munitions. Three expended casings may be given to the Next of Kin in commemoration of the
    three volleys fired for the 21-gun salute. Under no circumstances will casings be placed inside a
    folded flag.
    5.3. Upon return to the base, the firing party members will clean the weapons and turn them into the
    flight OIC/NCOIC who will inspect the weapons and re-issue them to the HG safe. Remaining spent
    casings will be placed in the spent rounds ammo can, and AF Form 3126 will be annotated to include
    number of rounds expended.

6. Inspections.
    6.1. Open ranks inspection will be scheduled at every practice and when deemed necessary by HG
    leadership. Squadron commanders, first sergeants, and Chiefs should be invited to perform the inspec-
    tion. All members not on leave, TDY or excused by their commander or first sergeant will attend.
MCCONNELLAFBI34-101 3 MARCH 2004                                                                     7


   6.2. The 22 SVS/CC or HGC/NCOIC may call for special formations for the purpose of training,
   inspections, or special details if deemed necessary; however, these will be held to a minimum.

7. Uniforms.
   7.1. HG Ceremonial items listed in AFI 36-2903, table 3.2 will be purchased using the Wing Com-
   manders Emphasis Fund (HERO).
   7.2. HG uniform accessories will be maintained in an orderly manner by the 22 SVS in an appropriate
   storage location. Uniform requirements for Color Guard and other HG participants are outlined in AFI
   36-2903.
   7.3. Each member is responsible for maintaining his/her uniform in a serviceable condition. Lost or
   damaged uniform items will be replaced at the member's expense. Members are required to return all
   issued equipment when their tour of duty has expired.
   7.4. The following uniform combinations will be worn during the periods specified:
      7.4.1. Male - 16 March - 14 November - Light Blue shirt with short sleeves (with epaulets), and
      wheel cap. Female - 16 March - 14 November - Slacks and blouse with short sleeves (with epau-
      lets), and wheel cap. Male - 15 November - 15 March - Double knit service dress with wheel cap.
      Female - 15 November - 15 March - Double knit service dress with wheel cap. The HGC/NCOIC
      may deviate from this schedule dependent upon climatic conditions (unreasonably hot or cold
      weather conditions) or special ceremonial requirements.
      7.4.2. Upon completion of a ceremony, the flight OIC/NCOIC will submit a list of names to the
      Base Linen Exchange of the personnel who request cleaning services after the event. Members
      may bring one complete uniform to linen exchange to be cleaned after each event. This service is
      extended to the teams during their duty weeks. After this period of time, the request cannot be
      honored. Each member should ensure that they have a clean uniform available for details at any
      time during their on-call period.

MEMORANDUM FOR 22 SVS/HG
FROM: Squadron Commander/First Sergeant
SUBJECT: McConnell AFB Honor Guard Selectee
1. I have read the above statement and MAFBI 34-101 and agree to follow these instructions without
     fail.
_________________________                                      _____________
Applicant's Signature                                           Date
2. I support the applicant's request to serve on the McConnell AFB Honor Guard. I understand the
applicant is required to serve on a one-year tour of duty unless dismissed due to PCS, separation or by
written request of the member's commander. I agree to allow the applicant to attend all details and
