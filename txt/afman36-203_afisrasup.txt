SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This is the first publication of Air Force ISR Agency supplement to AFMAN 36-203. This supplement
supersedes AFISRAGM 36-201, dated, 21 February 2008. It consolidates guidance for setting goals for
the employment and development of individuals with targeted disabilities and more clearly delineates
Agency responsibilities for managing and administering the overall program.
3.1.Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, 29 U.S.C § 791, requires Federal
agencies to take proactive steps to provide equal opportunity to individuals with targeted disabilities. As
such, Congress directed the federal government to serve as a model employer of people with disabilities
and include them at all levels of the Federal workforce. The Department of Defense has established a

2% goal for hiring and developing employees with targeted disabilities (e.g., those with severe physical,
cognitive or emotional disability, or a history of having such disabilities, or those perceived as having
such disabilities). Targeted disabilities covered in the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s
Management Directive-715 are:
3.1.1. (Added) Deafness.
3.1.2. (Added) Blindness.
3.1.3. (Added) Missing Extremities.
3.1.4. (Added) Partial Paralysis.
3.1.5. (Added) Complete Paralysis.
3.1.6. (Added) Convulsive Disorders.
3.1.7. (Added) Mental Retardation.
3.1.8. (Added) Mental Illness.
3.1.9. (Added) Distortion of Limb and/or Spine.
3.2.Currently, employees with targeted disabilities make up less than the DoD goal of 2% of our
workforce. To assist the AF ISR Agency in reaching this goal, selecting officials are required to identify
positions for targeted recruitment and placement which will be included in AF ISR Agency’s
Affirmative Employment Program (AEP) plan goals. Positions that become vacant, and are filled
through external recruitment, may provide opportunities to meet established goals. In addition, AF ISR
Agency may take the following actions in coordination with AF ISR Agency/A1 to facilitate the
accomplishment of our objective.
3.2.1. (Added) Engage in outreach and targeted recruitment efforts.
3.2.2. (Added) Create training and development plans for individuals with disabilities.
3.2.3. (Added) Take disability into account in selection decisions where an individual with a targeted
disability is otherwise qualified with or without reasonable accommodation.
3.2.4. (Added) Name request current employees with targeted disabilities for promotion.
