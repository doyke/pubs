SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This revision changes the Procedures for Medical Emergencies paragraph by identifying Fire Department
as CEF, Psychiatric Emergency paragraph by adding transportation requirements and location to North
Hampton Veteran Affairs. A bar ( | ) indicates revisions from the previous edition.


1. Responsibilities. The 439 Aerospace Medicine Squadron Commander (439 AMDS/SG) acts in a
con-sultant capacity to the 439 Airlift Wing Commander (439 AW/CC) concerning medical emergencies.
All personnel assigned to the 439 AW should be familiar with procedures related to medical and psychi-
atric emergencies. The 439 AMDS is not a medical treatment facility and, therefore, is limited to the
advising and tracking roll in the event of a psychiatric emergency.

2. Procedures.
