Commander’s Intent:

Physical fitness is an important aspect of our readiness. The Fitness Assessment (FA) is the
method we use to measure our members’ fitness. The FA is used to ensure Airmen are prepared
to meet the demanding physical challenges of today’s mission. The FA is designed to test the
body composition, muscular strength/endurance, and cardiovascular respiratory fitness of our
Airmen. A passing score signifies an Airman is Fit to Fight. The FA is merely a measurement
of fitness, not in itself a fitness program. I encourage every Airman in our wing to adopt a
personal fitness program. Doing so will dramatically improve a member’s FA scores, stamina,
and their capability to accomplish their mission. Additionally and more importantly, adherence
to a physical fitness regimen will result in a healthier member enjoying a better quality of life
and increased longevity.

Our wing’s fitness program is governed by AFI 36-2905. To ensure compliance with this
instruction, I have established this Wing Instruction. Its purpose is to provide guidance with the
 2                                                                                      514AMWI36-2905 23 APRIL 2014


administration and management of our wing’s fitness program. The ultimate goal of our fitness
program is to encourage and produce healthy and fit Airmen. There are multiple resources
available to assist those members struggling with their fitness assessments. Unit Fitness Program
Managers (UFPM) and Physical Training Leaders (PTL) should encourage these members and
help them achieve their physical fitness goals. The base’s Health and Wellness Center (HAWC)
also has resources available for our members. I encourage all members to take advantage of
what the HAWC has to offer, not just those struggling with their FAs.

The bottom line of the AF Fitness Program is that AFI 36-2905 dictates standards, and it is every
Airman’s responsibility to meet or exceed those standards. FA scores affect proficiency reports,
deployments, schools, TDYs, and numerous training opportunities. In order to enforce these
fitness standards, commanders may have to exercise adverse personnel action in the event of
failure. The harshness of any adverse actions will escalate with each subsequent failure up to a
recommendation for involuntary separation for four or more failures in a 24-month period. This
instruction should provide the necessary guidance to ensure all adverse actions are standardized
across the wing and dispensed fairly. Our objective, though, is to have all our members achieve
passing FA scores, not to discharge them any of them.

1. General.
   1.1. This Instruction is designed to provide assistance with the management and
   administration of the Fit to Fight program across all groups and squadrons within the 514th
   Air Mobility Wing (AMW). Additionally, this instruction provides guidance to unit
   commanders in addressing their members with multiple fitness assessment failures and those
   who fail to maintain currency. This guidance ensures that the unique nature of the Joint Base
   McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst/Associate Unit construct is addressed in the Fit to Fight program
   processes as necessary for compliance with AFI 36-2905. Assigned responsibilities for the
   effective management of this program will be structured in accordance with the 514 AMW
   Fitness Organizational chart as referenced in Attachment 1 of this instruction. The main
   objective of this wing’s fitness program is to encourage its members to adopt a healthy
   lifestyle complete with a proper nutritional diet and effective regular exercise.
2. Responsibilities.
   2.1. Wing Commander (514 AMW/CC) will:
       2.1.1. Execute and enforce the Fitness Program for the 514 AMW and ensure
       compliance with appropriate administrative action in cases of non-compliance.
       2.1.2. Provides an environment that supports and motivates a healthy lifestyle through
       optimal fitness and nutrition.
       2.1.3. Appoints Wing Fitness Program Manager (WFPM).
       2.1.4. Provides an environment for the Squadron Commander to have the authority and
       confidence to act swiftly with any fitness related issues.
       2.1.5. Provides wing guidance for consistent adverse actions for members who do not
       meet the standards.
       2.1.6. May provide input on administrative actions taken against a member for a fourth
       subsequent Fitness Assessment (FA) failure.
       2.1.7. Develops a Wing Fitness Publication to give guidance to Units, Groups and
       Tenants assigned to the 514 AMW.
4                                                            514AMWI36-2905 23 APRIL 2014


       2.1.8. Coordinates with Host Base Leadership to ensure level of support provided is
       IAW AF Directives and Host Tenant Agreement.
       2.1.9. Establishes a policy for subordinate unit commanders regarding the use of duty
       time for Physical Training (PT) during Unit Training Assemblies (UTA), Annual Tours
       (AT) and Special Tours. Note this is required per Management Internal Control Toolset
       Compliance Inspection (MICT CI) checklist for Wing Fitness Program.
       2.1.10. Designates approved testing facilities / locations.
       2.1.11. Submits waivers to Major Command (MAJCOM) to adjust scheduling of FA
       based on extreme seasonal weather conditions.

       2.2.1. Be appointed by the wing commander, should be a full time member of the 514
       AMW. Must be a Senior Noncommissioned Officer (SNCO) or a company grade officer
       or above. The WFPM must be able to maintain a passing score on the FA and should be a
       fitness example to the wing, promoting fitness and a healthy lifestyle throughout the
       wing.
       2.2.2. Develop a fitness assessment schedule for each day of every Unit Training
       Assembly (UTA), both “A” and “B” weekends. Offer enough sessions to ensure the
       demand for fitness assessments from across the wing are met. To the maximum extent
       possible, utilize PTLs who are not performing their regularly scheduled UTA. This will
       prevent PTLs from testing members in their unit. If PTLs are used during their regularly
       scheduled UTA periods, ensure they do not perform assessment duties that involve
       directly scoring members from their unit. Acting as a spotter during the run portion is not
       an active scoring duty and is allowed when members from the PTL’s unit are
       running/walking.

       manner of how the MPTL conducts a fitness assessment.
       2.2.5. When possible, complete the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM)
       Certified Personal Trainer and ACSM Group Exercise Instructor Courses or the National
       Academy of Sports Medicine (NASM) Health Fitness Specialist certification (or
       equivalent certification) within 12 months of appointment.
       2.2.6. Consist of a primary, assigned as an officer, and an alternate, assigned as an
       officer or NCO. This is to ensure coverage for all UTAs, “A” and “B” weekends and
       necessary preparation for assessments, data entry and compilations, and ensure
       program/scheduling continuity.
       2.2.7. Conduct initial PTL-Basic, PTL-Advanced, and UFPM training. Train PTLs to
       lead unit Physical Training (PT) and conduct wing FAs as required, including proper
       equipment procurement, maintenance, and use. Ensure PTLs are trained for Basic Life
       Support (BLS) and in the use of an Automated External Defibrillator (AED). Ensure that
514AMWI36-2905 23 APRIL 2014                                                                5

     provides fitness inputs for members on profile for same component for greater than 12
     months or exempt for more than 4 components within 24 months.
     2.2.11. Manages base AFFMS users, granting access to commanders and UFPMs only
     after a letter of appointment is generated.
  2.3. Group Commanders will:
     2.3.1. Appoint a primary and alternate group fitness program manager (GFPM), assigned
     as either an officer or NCO. This is to ensure coverage for all UTAs of which the
     group’s squadrons participate, both “A” and “B” weekends and conduct any necessary
     administrative functions in managing the fitness program at the group level.
  2.4. Group Fitness Program Managers (GFPMs) will:
     2.4.1. Be appointed by the group commander. It is highly recommended that they be a
     full time member of the 514 AMW and available for at least a year after appointment.
     2.4.2. Maintain group-wide fitness metrics to include unit currency/non-currency levels,
     exemptions, never-tested totals and recognition for excellent fitness scores data.
     2.4.3. Conduct FAs on rotation based upon the WFPM annual schedule. Ensure that set
     up, administration of the FA, and tear down is accomplished.
     2.4.4. Communicate with the UFPMs to ensure that PTLs will be available to assess the
     FA (in accordance with the Wing FA schedule) the UTA prior. (e.g. The GFPM will
     contact the UFPM on the April A UTA to ensure that a PTL will be available to assess
     the FA on the A UTA in May).
     2.4.5. Will not enter scores or exemptions for anyone in the groups they themselves are
     assigned to. To do so, will be grounds for immediate removal from the GFPM position by
     the WFPM.
  2.5. Unit/Squadron Commanders (CCs) will:
     2.5.1. Appoint primary and alternate UFPMs, assigned as either an officer or NCO.
     Ensure their appointees have the availability to provide for program/scheduling
     continuity.
     2.5.2. Appoint PTLs IAW AFI 36-2905. As a minimum, designate two members as
     PTLs.
     2.5.3. Use any of the administrative and personnel actions listed in AFI 36-2905,
     attachment 14, as they deem appropriate to address multiple fitness failures. Actions may
6                                                            514AMWI36-2905 23 APRIL 2014


       include denial from attending schools, TDYs, deployments, denial of re-enlistment, and a
       referral performance report.
       2.5.4. Document all actions and correspondence relating to members with failing FA
       scores and provide this documentation to the UFPM for inclusion in the member’s
       Fitness Program Case File. This documentation must include a completed AF Form 108,

       Form 108 documents all of the steps that a CC has made to ensure the member does not
       have a medical condition precluding them from passing their fitness assessment. CCs
       should document all verbal counseling using an AF Form 174, Record of Individual
       Counseling.
    2.6. Unit Fitness Program Managers (UFPMs) will:
       2.6.1. Manage the squadron’s fitness program for the CC and maintain squadron fitness
       statistics which will include unit currency/non-currency levels, exemptions, never-tested
       totals and recognition for excellent fitness scores data. Provide unit fitness metrics to the
       CC.
       2.6.2. Provide the GFPM with the required fitness metrics used during the pre-UTA
       meetings NLT Tuesday prior to the UTA.
       2.6.3. Schedule members for FAs utilizing the 514 AMW Fitness SharePoint site
       https://eim.amc.af.mil/org/514amw/514_WFPM/default.aspx
       2.6.4. Provide members with the Fitness Screening Questionnaire (FSQ) for completion
       no earlier than 90 days and no later than 7 days prior to the fitness assessment. Retain a
       current copy of the FSQ for each member. The FSQ will be reviewed along with the
       member’s AF Form 469, Duty Limiting Condition Report, (when applicable) prior to a
       member taking the FA. Any member demonstrating high-risk responses will be referred
       to the Medical Liaison Officer.
       2.6.5. Notify CC of failures.
       2.6.6. Create and maintain case files on members having failing FA scores (FSQs, fitness
       scores, letters, e-mails, copies of administrative actions taken, etc.). Use format
       described in Attachment 2 for organizing Fitness Program Case Files. Ensure case files
       are maintained in a secured location. Refer members with failing scores to complete
       Balance Eating –Workout Effectively-Live Long (BE WELL) course online through
       ADLS (see 6.1.14). Additionally, refer these members to see the Health and Wellness
       Center (HAWC) if they have availability during the week.
       2.6.7. Identify Airmen who have been exempted from one or more of the four
       components of the fitness test for a continuous 12-month period or have four component
       exemptions in a 24-month period and notify the Unit CC. Note: If a member completes
       the 2 km walk instead of the run, it is not considered a component exemption.
       2.6.8. Produces Self Pace Fitness Improvement (SFIP) documentation for those who do
       not pass the assessment by the first UTA following the failed assessment. Obtains all
       required signatures on the SFIP documents. Manages those members enrolled in SFIP,
       and assists in completing the Be Well (BW) program, answering any FIP/fitness related
514AMWI36-2905 23 APRIL 2014                                                                7


     questions. Members must complete the BW program within 60 days of the unsatisfactory
     FA.
     2.6.9. Conducts monthly meetings with all members enrolled in SFIP and reviews their
     current fitness status.
     2.6.10. Identify Airmen who are in a “Not Participating” status and provide a list to the
     WFPM in a Memorandum for Record (MFR) (see attachment 10). “Not Participating”
     members will be exempt in Air Force Fitness Management System (AFFMS) by the
     WFPM. “Not Participating” lists will be updated every 6 months or more frequently as
     needed.
     2.6.11. Identify Airmen who are in a “No Pay No Points” status and provide an MFR for
     each individual to the WFPM (see attachment 11). “No Pay No Points” members will be
     exempt in AFFMS via a “Commander’s” exemption (AFI36-2905, Table 5.1. Exemption
     Categories). “No Pay No Points” MFRs will be updated every quarter. (See 2.8.8. for
     further exemption guidance).
  2.7. Squadron Physical Training Leaders (PTLs) will:
     2.7.1. Complete PTL-Basic (PTL-B) certification or PTL-Advanced (PTL-A) and
     recurring training.
     2.7.2. Assist the WFPM in the administration of the FA.
     2.7.3. Be available upon request by the WFPM to assist with FAs.
     2.7.4. Not directly score members of their unit on the fitness assessment.
     2.7.5. PTL-A certified members will plan and lead squadron members in unit physical
     training activities.
  2.8. Squadron Members will:
     2.8.1. Inform their UFPM no later than thirty days prior to their fitness assessment due
     date to schedule their test and complete the Fitness Screening Questionnaire.
     2.8.2. Inform their UFPM of any medical condition that may exist or arise which would
     restrict the completion of their fitness requirements. Upon completing the FSQ, if a
     medical condition exists or arises prior to the scheduled FA which would restrict the
     completion of their fitness requirements, the service member will notify their UFPM.
     The UFPM will provide the service member with the Civilian Medical Evaluation
     letter/Civilian Medical checklist (Attachment 4). Members will remain in a noncurrent
     status until they supply the AMDS with the necessary medical documentation from their
     civilian primary care provider supporting their current illness/injury. A copy of this
     documentation is returned to the UFPM and a copy is given to the 514 AMDS. The
     completion of the FA will be dependent upon the outcome of the military medical
     provider review. If the member notifies their UFPM, GFPM, or the WFPM of a medical
     condition that exists or arises on the day of the scheduled FA which would restrict the
     completion of their fitness requirements, the member will be considered non-current once
     past their FA due date until the member can provide medical documentation from their
     civilian primary care physician supporting their current illness/injury, or until they
     complete their FA.

        2.8.3. Ensure their fitness profile is accurately annotated on their AF Form 469, Duty
        Profile.
        2.8.4. Remain current as defined in AFI 36-2905, para. 3.12. Failing to remain current,
        as well as failing to attain a passing score on the fitness assessment will result in a
        “DOES NOT MEET STANDARDS” rating on the member’s performance report if the
        member is non-current or has failed fitness assessment status as of the closeout date.
        2.8.5. Report to their scheduled FA with a completed FSQ, their Common Access Card
        (CAC), and AF Form 469, if applicable.
        2.8.6. Complete their portion of the AF Form 4446 Score Card. Due to identity theft
        concerns, members will leave the block requiring their full Social Security number blank.
        Upon completion of the FA, the members will sign the bottom portion of the score sheet
        and place their full Social Security number in the appropriate block. This will ensure
        their Social Security numbers are secure throughout the entire FA.
        2.8.7. Members whose fitness currency expires within 180 months of an approved
        retirement are not required to test.
        2.8.8. Members must provide documentation to the GFPM or WFPM in order to be put
        in an exempt status in AFFMS under the “Deployed” or “Commander’s” (see
        Attachment 12).
3. Fitness Assessment Testing.
     3.1. Each unit will be responsible to supply PTLs to conduct FAs during UTAs as scheduled
     by WFPMs and GFPMs. To eliminate the appearance of impropriety, PTLs will not test
     members from their own unit. If there is a shortage of PTL(s), the WFPM will visually assist
     performing the testing to reduce the appearance of impropriety.
     3.2. The FAs will be conducted at the McGuire Fitness Center.
     3.3. Members will test in the following order: (1) height, (2) weight, (3) abdominal
     circumference, (4) push-ups, (5) sit-ups, (6) run/walk, and, if necessary, (7) Body Mass Index
     Screen and (8) BFA.
     3.4. A member may count another member's sit-ups/push-ups if the PTL is a witness to
     ensure the member performing the test is correctly doing the procedure.
     3.5. After completion of the six FA components, the member and/or PTL must review the
     AF 4446 score card for completeness (name, social security number, signatures).
     3.6. The AF 4446 and FSQ must be turned-in to the GFPM or WFPM at the end of the FA to
     be entered into AFFMS. Both sheets will be returned to the squadron UFPM to be filed.
     3.7. The wing’s medical units (AMDS, ASTS, and AES) will provide a medical professional
     (e.g. doctor, nurse or Emergency Medical Technician (EMT)) to be on scene in case of any
     medical emergency that may arise due to physical exertion.
4. Safety Equipment and Weather Considerations.
     4.1. AEDs and first-aid supplies are available at the Fitness Center. WFPM, GFPM, or a
     PTL will check out an AED and have a cell phone available during the FA.
514AMWI36-2905 23 APRIL 2014                                                                   9


   4.2. The 87 ABW Command Post will be the source for all weather-related information.
   This data will be the basis for determining if environmental conditions are conducive for
   conducting the run/walk portion of the FA.
   4.3. Prior to the aerobic portion of the FA, PTLs will complete a visual inspection of outdoor
   track surface for accumulation of water and/or ice that cannot be easily observed and
   avoided, or standing water that a large group cannot easily avoid.
   4.4. In accordance with the Fitness Testing Weather Waiver Memorandum from AFRC/CV,
   dated 23 November 2011 (Attachment 5), the run component of the FA may be exempted by
   the WFPM or GFPM during inclement weather. The Griffith Field House indoor track is not
   to be utilized as an alternative to running outdoors.
5. Fitness Review Board.
   5.1. Performs an advisory role only. The FRB will meet at least quarterly, or as requested by
   the wing commander or designated representative, to review all personnel identified as
   having at least four FA failures within a 24-month period.
   5.2. The FRB should consist of the WFPM, medical review officer, and career advisor. The
   affected member’s commander and/or first sergeant, as well as a fitness monitor from the
   affected member’s squadron, should also attend the FRB.
   5.3. The FRB will advise, provide input, or make suggestions for members identified to the
   FRB, prior to a final discharge or retention recommendation being made. It is not necessary,
   however, that the FRB meet prior to a discharge or retention recommendation being made.
   No input, advice, or suggestions from the FRB are binding on the wing commander, or unit
   commanders.
6. Addressing Fitness Assessment Failures.
   6.1. If a member fails a fitness assessment, the UFPM will generate a case file with the
   below listed documents:
      6.1.1. Table of Contents
      6.1.2. Checklist
      6.1.3. A copy of the member’s AFFMS Individual Fitness Report.
      6.1.4. Most recent FSQ/Score Sheet with AFFMS Individual Fitness Report placed on
      top.
      6.1.5. Copies of all fitness related medical forms. (see Attachment 9)
      6.1.6. Fitness-related administrative action(s).
      6.1.7. SFIP Letter signed by the commander
      6.1.8. Selective reenlistment Program Consideration, AF Form 418
      6.1.9. Unfavorable Information File (UIF), AF Form 1058
      6.1.10. Wing Commander endorsement letter for discharge or retention
      6.1.11. Administrative retention or discharge letter from the unit commander
10                                                       514AMWI36-2905 23 APRIL 2014


     6.1.12. Copy of Notice to Stop Participation in Reserve Activities (no pay/no points)
     letter from unit commander
     6.1.13. Letter of options from unit commander (IRR, Retirement, Expiration of ETS,
     etc.)
     6.1.14. An AF Form 108, Physical Fitness Education and Intervention Processing
         6.1.14.1. Section II, the BW Date/Time is the completion date from Advance
         Distance Learning System (ADLS), the Location is ‘Online,’ the BW Core Session is
         checked ‘No,’ and the Approved by Unit Commander to Complete On-line Course is
         checked ‘Yes.’ The unit commander signs both signature blocks, and the UFPM signs
         and checks off when the member submits the ADLS certificate.
         6.1.14.2. The UFPM tracks and documents a member’s completion of the Be Well by
         clicking the “Education and Intervention.” tab in AFFMS, entering the date in the
         “Attendance Date” column, and then clicking Submit.
  6.2. FA failures will result in administrative action IAW AFI 36-2905. These actions will
  escalate in severity in accordance with AFI 36-2905, attachment 19.
  6.3. Commanders may, but are not required to, use any of the administrative and personnel
  actions listed in AFI 36-2905, Attachment 14, Table A14.1 as they deem appropriate.
  6.4. Commanders should consult with 514 AMW/JA before administering any action.
  6.5. Commanders/supervisors must take appropriate action to address every FA failure to
  enforce Air Force fitness standards. Generally, this means taking escalated action for every
  successive FA failure.
  6.6. Commanders should weigh any extenuating circumstances and any significant
  improvement in test scores prior to taking any adverse administrative action. Commanders
  may grant the member a reprieve from escalating administrative action based on contributing
  factors such as verifiable diligence in pursuing a prescribed fitness plan or continued
  significant improvement in test scores.
  6.7. Commanders should clearly document all factors in their decision and place all
  documentation in the member’s fitness program case file. Barring any extenuating
  circumstances, at minimum, commanders/supervisors should proceed with the following
  administrative actions.
     6.7.1. First failure should result in individual counseling by the member’s immediate
     supervisor using AF IMT 174.
     6.7.2. Second failure should result in a Letter of Counseling given by the unit
     commander/designated officer. Additionally, the 514 AMDS will review the member’s
     medical records to determine if an underlying medical condition is hindering his/her
     ability to pass the test. The 514 AMDS medical records review will be documented in a
     Memorandum for Medical Evaluation Following Multiple Unsatisfactory Fitness
     Assessments (see attachment 9). A personal interview with the member may also be
     requested if deemed necessary by the records review.
514AMWI36-2905 23 APRIL 2014                                                                    11


      6.7.3. Third failure should result in a Letter of Reprimand given by the unit
      commander/designated officer, and the start of an Unfavorable Information File (UIF),
      which will prohibit opportunities for promotion, TDY, schools, etc.
      6.7.4. Fourth (and any subsequent) failure should result in one or more actions listed in
      Attachment 14 of AFI 36-2905. In addition, the fourth and any subsequent failure must
      be addressed in accordance to section 6.2 and may result in retention, administrative
      separation, or mandatory retirement.
   6.8. When a member fails a FA four times within a 24-month period, unit commanders will
   submit retention or discharge recommendation to the 514 AMW/CC. Note: The 24-month
   period is calculated from the most recent Unsatisfactory FA and is measured in months, not
   days, including the month of the most recent failure. For example, if the most recent failure is
   8 Feb 14, then count the failures in the previous 23 months plus the month of the most recent
   failure (Feb 14). In this example, the inclusive months in which you must count FA failures
   are Jan 12 through Feb 14. Four FA failures anytime in those 24 months meets the criteria
   and would require the unit commander to make a discharge or retention recommendation
   provided the member does not have a medical condition to preclude him/her from achieving
   a passing score. A recommendation for discharge or retention will be made regardless of an
   Airman’s achieving one or multiple passing FAs in between the four failures.
   6.9. If a unit commander recommends discharge, the unit commander must submit a
   Memorandum Requesting Separation (attachment 7). It is imperative that all copies of
   communication (letters, email, etc.) between the member and the unit commander/supervisor
   are included in the recommendation package to fully support the discharge recommendation.
   The AF Form 108 and Physical Fitness Education and Intervention Processing must also be
   included. The commander must also ensure the member’s completed Memorandum for
   Medical Evaluation Following Multiple Unsatisfactory Fitness Assessments (see attachment
   9) is included.
   6.10. If recommending retention, the unit commander must submit a letter of retention
   (Attachment 6). The letter needs to justify the retention recommendation. The commander
   needs to include all supporting documentation. A medical evaluation is not required.
   6.11. If the member is retained, every subsequent FA failure requires the Unit Commander
   to submit another discharge or retention recommendation.
7. Addressing Non-Current Fitness Status.
   7.1. Commanders should ensure that appropriate administrative action is taken in all cases
   where members are non-current in their fitness status. Generally, members who are non-
   current may not be excused from UTAs or rescheduled for any reason other than to
   accomplish the FA prior to the next scheduled UTA. However, commanders may use
   discretion if the member is needed in another capacity or required for an infrequent training
   event. Non-current members will conduct their FAs at their very next opportunity.
   Commanders may take more severe UCMJ action that they deem necessary.
   7.2. Successive months of non-current status should result in successively more severe
   administrative action. Barring any extenuating circumstances, at a minimum, the following
   indicates the sequence of adverse actions to be taken upon failure to attain a current fitness
   status within a three-month period.
12                                                     514AMWI36-2905 23 APRIL 2014


     7.2.1. First month should result in a record of individual counseling (AF IMT 174) by
     the member’s immediate supervisor.
     7.2.2. Second month should result in a Letter of Counseling given by the unit
     commander.
     7.2.3. Third month should result in a Letter of Reprimand given by the unit commander,
     and the start of an UIF which will prohibit opportunities for promotion, TDY, schools,
     etc.
     7.2.4. Subsequent months should result in progressively more severe action. Consult
     with 514 AMW/JA for guidance.
