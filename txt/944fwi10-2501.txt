    3.2. Scheduling Procedures:
       3.2.1. Unit Schedulers. Units will appoint a unit scheduler to track and schedule
       personnel for training. The unit scheduler should be part of the unit’s training section, the
       unit deployment manager, or the unit EM representative.
       3.2.2. An annual training schedule will be provided by 944 CES/CEX. Schedulers will
       determine and schedule those personnel who need training. Units will manage and utilize
       assigned quotas. 944 CES/CEX works closely with units to ensure unit EM training
       needs are met and establishes training schedules to minimize productivity loss.
       Schedulers can verify attendance with the signed CBRNE Awareness certificate and by
       checking ACES Unit Scheduler.
          3.2.2.1. Survival Skills classes are offered weekly by 56 CES/CEX and individuals

       Suit Technology (JSLIST) ensemble, one pair of over boots, one pair of rubber gloves
       with cotton inserts. The M-50 protective mask is used for both training and real-world
       operational requirements. There is no such thing as a "training only" mask.
       4.1.3. Units must maintain and/or have access to enough training equipment to support
       training and exercise objectives.
       4.1.4. Units must identify and mark any training equipment they posses according to
       applicable Technical Orders.
       4.1.5. Units who maintain a supply of CBRN-DE for Unit Training (NOT issued to
       individuals through the supply system) on an account will need to be able to produce
       these masks for a 10 percent spot-inspection during SAV’s. Units should also conduct
       these inspections on their unit during self inspections.
   4.2. Mask Spectacle Inserts. All 944 FW military personnel who wear either glasses or
   contact lenses to correct their vision to 20/20 must have spectacle inserts for the protective
   mask.
       4.2.1. Prescriptions for spectacle inserts must not exceed one year. It is the
       responsibility of the member to maintain a current prescription on file with 944 FW
       optometry and eye exams.
       4.2.2. Each individual is responsible for ensuring they obtain the required spectacle
       inserts for the protective mask. Spectacle inserts will be maintained for both the MCU-
       2A/P and M-50 protective masks.
          4.2.2.1. Ordering of spectacle inserts will be done through 944 FW optometry. In
          order to obtain spectacle inserts, the member will provide optometry with a copy of
          their current prescription. The prescriptions MUST include pupil distance.
          4.2.2.2. 944 FW optometry will order the mask spectacle inserts and notify the
          member when the inserts are available for pick up.
   4.3. Field Gear. Field gear is not considered part of the CBRN-DE, but may be issued to

          and 56th Civilian Engineer Squadron Commander (56 CES/CC) are alternate EOC
          Directors. The 944 FW EOC member will standby at the Wing UCC upon
          notification and will only respond when 944 FW resources are involved or the EOC
          Director requests their presence.
          5.2.3.3. The 56 MSG/CC, or designated alternate, will determine when to recall the
          EOC.

          5.2.3.6. Members are responsible for developing response checklists geared towards
          responsibilities of their functional area during natural disasters, major accidents, and
          terrorist incidents. They will be reviewed annually and updated when necessary.
          Each member's unit furnishes unit specific EOC equipment and supplies.
6. Exercises:
