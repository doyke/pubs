This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 32-10, Installations and
Facilities. This instruction outlines the policy, procedures, responsibilities, and technical
standards for the recognition of United States Air Force (USAF) Electrical Skilled Persons at
United States Air Force in Europe (USAFE) Installations in the United Kingdom. It applies to
base civil engineers and United States (US) supporting agencies conducting electrical work.
This instruction highlights training requirements necessary to understand host nation code
requirements and electrical safe practices as required by AFI 32-1064, Electrical Safe Practices,
compliance with the substantive provisions of United Kingdom (UK) law as incorporated by the
Ministry of Defence (MOD) Joint Services Publication (JSP) 375 Volume 3, Chapter 3
“Electricity”. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this
publication are maintained in accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363,
Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition
Schedule (RDS) located in AF Records Managements System (AFRIMS) at
https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61/afrims/afrims/index.cfm.
1. Background.
   1.1. AFI 32-1064, Electrical Safe Practices, states “the most important part of a supervisor’s
   job is to get the job done safely.” Further, “supervisors should train employees to comply
   with host nation codes.”



                                                                                                1

    1.2. UK law and the Ministry of Defence (MOD) Joint Services Publication (JSP) 375
    Volume 3, Chapter 3, “Electricity”, require persons conducting electrical installation, testing,
    and operations on USAF installations in the United Kingdom to be approved as Electrical
    Skilled Persons.
    1.3. UK Law requires “persons to be competent to prevent “danger and injury.”
    Furthermore, it states “no person shall be engaged in any work activity where technical
