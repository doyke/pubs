Terms
Civil SAR—Search and rescue operations in the air, on the land, and on the water to assist
persons and protect life in a permissive environment. Examples of these rescue scenarios
include, but are not limited to, downed aviators, stranded sportsmen, lost boaters, and mass
rescue operations.
Core Function Lead Integrators—SECAF/CSAF-designated leaders who serve as the principal
integrators for their assigned SCFs and the corresponding CFMPs. CFLIs guide SCF maturation
and SCF-related investments by orchestrating the development of SCF strategy in collaboration
with key stakeholders across the Air Force, including HAF functionals, MAJCOMs and the Air
Reserve Components (ARC).
DSCA—Support provided by U.S. Federal military forces, DoD civilians, DoD contract
personnel, DoD Component assets, and National Guard forces (when the Secretary of Defense,
in coordination with the Governors of the affected States, elects and requests to use those forces
in title 32, U.S.C., status) in response to requests for assistance from civil authorities for
domestic emergencies, law enforcement support, and other domestic activities, or from
qualifying entities for special events. Also known as civil support.
Service Core Functions—SCFs delineate the appropriate and assigned core duties, missions,
and tasks of the Air Force as an organization, responsibility for each of which is assigned to a
CFLI. SCFs express the ways in which the Air Force is particularly and appropriately suited to
contribute to national security. SCFs are an integral aspect of the AFSPS, and provide the
framework for Air Force organizing, training, and equipping efforts, however, they do not
necessarily express every aspect of what the Air Force contributes to the nation.
