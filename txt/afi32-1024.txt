1. Facility Requirements System:
     1.1. The Facility Requirements System develops and approves standards that define the type,
     number, and size of facilities. The system promotes economy and efficiency in using and
     developing facilities and helps realize the following goals:
        1.1.1. Design standards for new and revised functional requirements.
        1.1.2. Maximum use of existing facilities.
        1.1.3. Standards of use to justify new facilities and occupy existing facilities.
        1.1.4. Comprehensive programming for the construction, operation, and maintenance of
        needed facilities.
     1.2. The organization of the Facility Requirements System is based on the DoD Real
     Property Classification System (RPCS). RPCS is a hierarchical scheme of real property
     types and functions that forms the framework for identifying, categorizing, and analyzing
     DoD’s inventory of land and facilities. The scheme is a tiered structure represented by
         numerical codes, with one-digit codes being the most general and five- or six-digit codes
     representing the most specific types of facilities.
        1.2.1. Each Military Service has established its own set of numerical codes, commonly
        known as facility Category Codes, to represent each type of facility in its inventory. The
        Air Force uses a six-digit hierarchy.
        1.2.2. Category Codes (CATCODE) are generally similar but not identical between
        Military Services. However, DoD established a higher-level facility classification that
        groups facilities with similar functions and units of measure from the Military Services
        into common Facility Analysis Categories (FAC) at the four-digit level. These FACs
        allow consistent macro-level analysis and planning across DoD. Successively smaller
        groupings of facility types are represented by three-, two-, and one-digit numerical
        classifications. The RPCS structure is numerically consistent between the one-digit and
        four-digit levels, but it is not always consistent across the Military Services at the five-
        and six-digit level. Further information on the DoD Real Property Classification System
        can be viewed on the Office of the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense, Installations and
        Environment Web site:
        http://www.acq.osd.mil/ie/fim/programanalysis_budget/tool_metrics/RPCS/rpcs.shtml.
     1.3. The Facility Requirements System is further defined in AFMAN 32-1084, Facility
     Requirements, which provides guidance and standards for the type, number, and size of
     facilities the Air Force can use, occupy, or build to support its mission. Air National Guard
     facility requirements are defined in ANGH 32-1084, ANG Standard Facility Requirements.
     A listing in the handbook does not provide automatic justification for programming a facility
     or for including it in the base comprehensive plan. All available space must be considered
     when establishing a space deficiency and when justifying programming action. Approved
     standards published in AFMAN 32-1084 contribute to:
        1.3.1. Timely acquisition of facilities.
        1.3.2. Expedited construction program reviews and approvals.
        1.3.3. Expedited project design.
AFI32-1024 14 JULY 2011                                                                        3


       1.3.4. Equitable space allocation in existing facilities; the published standards help
       divide limited assets among competing functions.
       1.3.5. Standardization of facility design; the Air Force realizes benefits not only in
       design and construction but also in program management and functional operations.
2. Responsibilities:
   2.1. The Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Environment and Logistics (SAF/IE)
   establishes Air Force facility requirements policy consistent with DoD policy and standards
   for facility requirements.
   2.2. The Office of the Civil Engineer (AF/A7C) through the Technical Directorate of the Air
   Force Center for Engineering and the Environment (AFCEE/TD):
       2.2.1. Implements policies and establishes procedures for the Facility Requirements
       System.
       2.2.2. Monitors Air Force-wide programs leading to new or revised facility standards to
       ensure all functional requirements are satisfied.
       2.2.3. Consults on architectural, engineering, and other design aspects of proposed
       facility requirements.
       2.2.4. Approves standard facility requirements.
       2.2.5. Prepares AFMAN 32-1084 and ensures it is current.
   2.3. AFMAN 32-1084, Table A2.2, lists the OPRs for each Facility Category Code; these
   OPRs are the primary action offices for developing facility requirements. OPRs must ensure
   facility requirements supporting new and changing functions are identified early and timely
   action is taken to develop new standards for approval and publishing.
   2.4. Major commands (MAJCOM), field operating agencies (FOA), and the Air National
   Guard establish active programs to:
       2.4.1. Keep abreast of new missions, programs, or concepts that may generate new
       facility requirements and initiate basing action, as appropriate, for new or modified
       missions in accordance with AFI 10-503, Base Unit Beddown Program.
       2.4.2. Develop or refine functional standards for the type, number, and size of facilities
       needed for mission support.
       2.4.3. Investigate current facility operations to determine if existing standards are
       adequate.
       2.4.4. Obtain approval of new or revised standard facility requirements for publication in
       AFMAN 32-1084 using the procedure outlined in paragraph 4 of this Instruction.
       2.4.5. Initiate the Environmental Impact Analysis Process (EIAP) in accordance with 32
       CFR §989
          2.4.5.1. The Air Force’s EIAP (32 CFR §989) shall be accomplished consistent with
          the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) (Pub. L. 91-190, 42 U.S.C. 4321-
          4347) and the Presidents’ Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) Regulations for
 4                                                                  AFI32-1024 14 JULY 2011


            Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA (40 CFR §§1500-1508) prior to
            implementing any irrevocable actions and/or committing irretrievable resources.
            2.4.5.2. The proponent of the action (32 CFR §989.3(d)) is the person or organization
            that is responsible for initiating action and is responsible for complying with the
            EIAP and ensuring integration of the EIAP during the initial planning stages of
            proposed actions so that planning and decisions reflect environmental values, delays
            are avoided later in the process, and potential conflicts are precluded.
            2.4.5.3. The Environmental Planning Function (EPF) (32 CFR §989.3(e)) supports
            the proponent. The proponent is responsible for notifying the EPF of its pending
            action and completing Section I of AF Form 813, Request for Environmental Impact
            Analysis.
     2.5. Other echelons develop and submit proposals to OPRs to improve facility requirements
     standards and use facilities more efficiently.
     2.6. Installation commanders determine the requirements for a specific facility based on
     standards published in AFMAN 32-1084 according to AFI 32-1021, Planning and
     Programming Military Construction (MILCON) Projects.
     2.7. New systems or major modifications to existing systems often generate facility
     requirements. Program managers for these systems submit requirements to OPRs listed in
     AFMAN 32-1084. OPRs submit approved requirements to AFCEE/TD for publication in
     AFMAN 32-1084.
3. Developing Standard Facility Requirements. OPRs will coordinate with command
headquarters for facilities in which they have a primary interest to:
     3.1. Acquire a good understanding of the function.
     3.2. Explore combining or integrating the proposed facility requirement with other
     requirements.
     3.3. Help civil engineers turn functional requirements into design and planning standards by
     investigating:
        3.3.1. The number of personnel and types of organizations using the facility.
        3.3.2. Time and scheduling of assigned workload.
        3.3.3. Environmental control.
        3.3.4. Major equipment or material used in the facility.
        3.3.5. Site location or base comprehensive plan.
        3.3.6. Safety considerations.
        3.3.7. Cost considerations to achieve functional requirements.
        3.3.8. Standards used by other government organizations for comparable facilities.
        3.3.9. Environmental protection requirements.
        3.3.10. Energy and sustainability features.
AFI32-1024 14 JULY 2011                                                                         5


   3.4. Establish the most accurate means of measuring and expressing the requirements to
   support the function; for example, square feet per person, per vehicle, per aircraft; one each
   per organizational unit; square yard per total factors.
   3.5. Obtain AFCEE’s help with facility requirements, layout, and functional relationships.
4. Procedures for Submitting Proposed New Standards or Changes to Existing Standards:
   4.1. The Office of the Secretary of Defense has established maximum space allowances for
   certain facilities (primarily administrative, community, and personnel support) which by new
   construction or changed use may not be exceeded without advance approval. AFMAN 32-
   1084 indicates which category code facility standards are OSD controlled. OSD also
   approves or implements standards developed through interagency action to standardize
   certain facilities (such as NAVAIDs). Facility requirements OPRs listed in AFMAN 32-
   1084 and facility requirements OPRs in the ANG and the Air Force Reserve are responsible
   for obtaining desired changes to standards under OSD control. OPRs will:
       4.1.1. Coordinate proposals with AF/A7C before submitting them to OSD or other
       Services. ANG and AFR OPRs will also cross-coordinate proposals of mutual interest
       before coordinating them with AF/A7C. Send proposals to AFCEE/TD for processing
       through AF/A7C to DoD.
       4.1.2. Keep detailed records on the development and approval of the revised standards.
       4.1.3. Notify AFCEE/TD when OSD approves revised standards.
   4.2. For standards that are not established by OSD, MAJCOM headquarters OPRs submit
   proposed standards and changes to standards to the appropriate Air Staff OPR listed in
   AFMAN 32-1084. The Air Staff facility OPR then submits proposed standards to
   AFCEE/TD for evaluation, implementation, and preparation for publication. The Air Staff
   OPR submission must include a draft text, in the same format as those contained in AFMAN
   32-1084, and supporting documentation.
       4.2.1. The draft handbook text of the proposed standards must include the preferred
       facility nomenclature, proposed space allowances or other quantitative facility
       requirement, and explain:
          4.2.1.1. Why the facility is required to support Air Force missions, programs,
          responsibilities, or activities. (Reference basic publications.)
          4.2.1.2. The principal activities or tasks supported by the facility. (Identify the type
          of organization performing the work.)
          4.2.1.3. The facility's major physical components and special features influencing
          space, cost, or other quantitative requirements.
          4.2.1.4. Other important features.
       4.2.2. The supporting documentation must explain in detail the descriptions and
       standards expressed in condensed form in the handbook text and how facility space
       requirements, or other quantitative limits, were derived.
5. Space Allowances. Except for those facilities covered by paragraph 4.1, the sizes and scopes
in AFMAN 32-1084 are guidance and may be increased or decreased. When the projects or
 6                                                                  AFI32-1024 14 JULY 2011


actions require construction or change in use and require AF/A7C approval under 32-series
policy directives, the writer of the project documents must explain and justify the need to exceed
published allowances. When the projects or actions do not require AF/A7C approval, increases
beyond the scopes shown may be made when approved by the MAJCOMs and Air National
Guard. AFI 32-1021, Planning and Programming Military Construction (MILCON) Projects,
and AFI 32-9002, Use of Real Property Facilities, provide guidance to the MAJCOMs and Air
National Guard. See also DODI 5305.5, Space Management Procedures, National Capital
Region, and AFI 32-9010, Management and Reporting of Air Force Space and Building Services
in OSD Assigned Facilities and in the Washington DC Area.
