SUMMARY OF CHANGES
The document incorporates the ideas, principles, and concepts of risk management into several areas of
the instruction. Chapter 1 discusses using risk management during the Hazard Abatement Action. It also
adds risk management to all levels of Air Force personnel’s responsibility. This chapter also specifically
outlines responsibility for Installation Civil Engineer offices. Chapter 2 clarifies the need for adequate
and experienced safety manning in all disciplines. The chapter also adds Space Safety Officers, Manag-
ers, and Engineers as well as allowing FSNCOs to be maintenance, aircrew or career safety personnel.
This chapter also expands the information on the Table of Allowances for computer support and adds a
paragraph outlining the Major Range and Test Facility Base safety programs. Chapter 3 clarifies the role
of the safety office in program evaluations of contractor facilities and actions. Spot Inspections and High
Interest Area definitions and actions were also added. Chapter 5 changed the periodic summaries and the
issuance times to allow for better coverage of the topics. Added a significant paragraph on Mishap Anal-
ysis programs and methods as well as provides guidance on how to use the data. It chapter also discusses
the use and creation of metrics. Chapter 6 updated all class numbers and rearranged the paragraphs to
provide a clearer understanding of the course and their uses. An annual training requirements report is
now required to be submitted by the MAJCOMs. Chapter 7 expands the Aircraft Maintenance, Aero
Club Operations, and Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard areas. Chapter 8 requires ground safety personnel
to attend the Facility Utilization Board and clarified other areas of the chapter. Chapter 9 outlines the
new requirements of the program executive officer, program and system safety manager in all aspects of
system safety. Risk assessment was added to ensure its incorporation into all aspects of system safety.
Chapter 10 was modified by the addition of weapons safety personnel management requirements as well
as additions in the responsibilities of the weapons safety personnel. AFSC/SEW also added a paragraph

                                                Chapter 1

                                       PROGRAM OVERVIEW

1.1. The Mishap Prevention Process. Air Force host and tenant safety offices are responsible for imple-
menting the Air Force Safety Program. Any interorganization and interservice agreements will be
addressed in the Host/Tenant Support Agreement. The host safety office implements mishap prevention
programs and processes for all Air Force units and programs on base unless otherwise outlined in a Host/
Tenant Support Agreement. Safety staffs at all levels assist with implementation and integration of oper-
ational risk management into all Air Force operations and missions.
   1.1.1. (Added-AFMC) AFMC Commander’s Safety Policy: Nothing is more important to me per-
   sonally than the safety and well being of AFMC people and their family members. For this reason,
   creating a wellness-focused and safe workforce is now a command strategic objective. The loss or
   injury of one of our people due to an unsafe act not only impacts our ability to accomplish the mission,
   but it also adversely impacts coworkers and family members. For that reason, Secretary of Defense
   Rumsfeld challenged DoD to reduce mishap rates by 50 percent. To make the Secretary’s challenge a
   reality across AFMC, we must strengthen our focus on safety both on and off duty.
   1.1.2. (Added-AFMC) Safety is a leadership responsibility. Every commander, director, and supervi-
   sor is accountable to provide every member of the AFMC team a safe, healthy, and environmentally
   sound workplace. But leadership must go further. We must inspire through personal example the
   proper use of Operational Risk Management (ORM) principles—even for routine tasks—on or off
   duty. We must involve our people in the ORM process—how it impacts our day-to-day work, how it
   applies both on and off duty, and what we can do to improve our overall safety posture. It’s easy to
   drop our guard in this area, so I can’t overemphasize the importance of inspiring leadership from the
   top and down through every level of the organization.
   1.1.3. (Added-AFMC) Safety is also an individual responsibility. If the most junior Airman or Air
   Force Civilian on the shop floor witnesses an unsafe act or unsafe situation, then he or she must take
   immediate action. Fix the problem. If you can’t fix it, then tell a supervisor. Bottom Line: Make sure
   the problem gets the attention it deserves. Your action may save a life or prevent a serious injury!
   1.1.4. (Added-AFMC) Our Wingman culture applies here. In the end, being a good Wingman is all
   about the value of life … and the value of our people. Inspiring a culture of safety and eliminating pre-
   ventable mishaps on and off duty is all about the value of life … and the value of our people. Be a
   good Wingman: watch out for each other at all times; be alert to unsafe acts or situations—and take
   action! Commit to never losing a fellow Airman, military or civilian, to a preventable mishap.

1.2. Determining Standards. Commanders, functional managers, supervisors, and individuals, with the
host safety office’s help, identify rules, criteria, procedures, Occupational Safety and Health Administra-
tion (OSHA), Air Force Occupational and Environmental Safety, Fire Protection, and Health (AFOSH),
explosive safety, or other safety standards that could help eliminate unsafe acts or conditions that cause
mishaps.

1.3. Applying Standards. Applying sound standards is basic to preventing mishaps. All Air Force units
must apply standards by observing these fundamental principles:
10                                            AFI91-202_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 3 JUNE 2008


     1.3.1. Commanders, functional managers, supervisors, and individuals must all contribute to the mis-
     hap prevention program. An effective program depends on individuals integrating mishap prevention
     at every functional level and being responsible for complying with applicable safety standards.
     1.3.2. Units must establish specific procedures (for example, inspections) to ensure that all personnel
     and activities comply with the program standards.
     1.3.3. Every level of command is responsible for compliance with applicable safety standards.

1.4. Hazard Controls:
     1.4.1. Identifying Hazards. The primary responsibility for identifying workplace hazards, to include
     equipment and environmental situations that place workers, equipment, or facilities at risk, rests with
     the individual. Commanders, functional managers, supervisors, and individuals identify hazards by
     evaluating the work environment and job tasks. Safety, environmental, and medical staffs and
     fire-protection personnel provide technical assistance.
     1.4.2. Determining Hazard Abatement Action. The proper way to eliminate a particular hazard is
     often difficult to determine, and alternatives are limited by time and cost. After considering all fac-
     tors, choose the alternative that contributes the most to overall mission accomplishment. Consider
     these three categories of corrective actions:
        1.4.2.1. Planning and Engineering. Use risk management processes during the planning, design,
        and execution phases to eliminate hazards as early as possible when they will have the least cost
        and operational impact on the program. Continually review plans, specifications, and drawings to
        identify and eliminate hazards until the equipment or facility is operating. Eliminate hazards iden-
        tified after an item is deployed by modifying the item or installing protective devices or guards.
        The supervisor, with safety staff help, completes a job safety analysis (JSA) and operational haz-
        ard analysis (OHA) to ensure worker, equipment, and work environment compatibility. Proce-
        dures for JSA and OHA are contained in the Supervisors Safety Training (SST) handbooks,
        AFOSH Standard 91-31, Personal Protective Equipment, and AFI 91-301, Air Force Occupa-
        tional and Environmental Safety, Fire Protection, and Health (AFOSH).
        1.4.2.2. Procedural Actions. Develop procedures or restrictions to minimize risk if planning or
        engineering actions cannot be used to eliminate hazards. If necessary, impose restrictions such as
        operational limits, frequent inspections, protective equipment, or stopping the operation until cor-
        rective action is taken.
        1.4.2.3. Personnel Actions. People work more safely and effectively when properly trained and
        motivated. Supervisors must keep their people involved in risk management. AFI 91-213, Oper-
        ational Risk Management, outlines the basic tenets and processes of risk management. Opera-
        tional risk management is a systematic process of detecting, assessing and controlling measures to
        enhance total organizational performance.
        1.4.2.3. (AFMC) ORM is a Chief of Staff Air Force (CSAF) and AFMC priority program. AFMC
        organizations will implement ORM programs in accordance with AFI 90-901, Operational Risk
        Management, AFPAM 90-902, Operational Risk Management (ORM) Guidelines and Tools,
        AFMCI 90-902, Operational Risk Management, and local guidance.
     1.4.3. Taking Action. Commanders protect national resources, both human and material, and have
     the authority to take action in implementing safety measures.
AFI91-202_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 3 JUNE 2008                                                             11


       1.4.3.1. Functional managers correct hazards in their areas of responsibility.
       1.4.3.2. The safety office helps functional managers and commanders determine needed correc-
       tive actions and provide the commander with follow-up support until the hazard is eliminated or
       changes are in place.

1.5. Notifying Other Affected Units and Agencies. Relay hazard and mishap information to other units
and agencies with similar missions or equipment according to AFI 91-204, Investigating and Reporting
US Air Force Mishaps. AFI 91-204 and Chapter 4 and Chapter 5 of this instruction explain what infor-
mation to relay and what communication systems to use. Mishap prevention data is worthless unless peo-
ple who need the information get it. No one cannot afford to have mishaps caused by problems already
known and solved by other units.

1.6. Program Responsibilities:
   1.6.1. The Assistant Secretary of the Air Force (Acquisition) makes policy and gives guidance to

                                    THE SAFETY ORGANIZATION

2.1. Safety Staff. One staff element should manage each organization's safety program. The safety staff
will perform and/or assists risk assessment of wing mission, contingency exercises, and operations. In
addition, the staff will review and help develop emergency plans and procedures to include, but not lim-
ited to, SAFE HAVEN, SAFE CONVOY, HAZMAT and disaster response required by AFI 32-4001 or
AFI 32-4002, and when required by law (Clean Air Act), or accidental release risk management programs
for explosives. The chief of safety must answer directly to the commander. Full-time safety personnel
must be qualified, trained to manage safety programs, and able to function at the staff level. Use the Air
Force Manpower Standard (AFMS) 106A to determine the required size of the safety staff. In units with-
out an authorized safety position, the commander must appoint a collateral duty safety individual to per-
form the safety functions. All requests for manpower changes to safety office personnel will be
coordinated with the applicable MAJCOM/SE office before submission to the local management engi-
neering team. Do not assign full-time safety personnel additional duties that are not directly associated
with the job duties described in the 91-series directives and their supplements.
2.1. (AFMC) Safety Staff. AFRL is considered a center for this supplement. The center chief of safety
must report directly to the center commander. The individuals assigned to the center safety offices must be
safety trained and must have safety as their primary duty. They should be in a safety AFSC or safety civil-
ian job series. Civilian safety personnel must not have additional job series as part of their position
description. Safety cannot be an additional duty for members of the center safety office. If the center
safety office is not organized in this fashion, it is not a center safety office.

     missile units, and units operating a test range, the staff must have the use of a two-way radio-equipped
     vehicle. Any radio net, appropriate to the mission, that allows the vehicle to move freely around the
     airfield or missile complex is acceptable.
     2.4.2. Tables of Allowance (TA). These TAs list items that safety offices use:
        2.4.2.1. TA 006, Organizational and Administrative Equipment.
        2.4.2.2. TA 009, Small Computer Systems. As a minimum, each full-time safety staff office
        should have: a 486 computer (or faster), with CD-ROM read capability and a laptop with portable
        CD-ROM suitable for reading Air Force publications for use by mishap investigation boards and
        using software compatible with Microsoft products (the Air Force standard). As part of the safety
        office’s computer support, to include the assigned laptop, it is highly recommend to have direct
        access to the Internet and World Wide Web.

       2.4.2.8. TA 660, Equipment Allowances for Non-Weapon Systems Communications Require-
       ments.
   2.4.3. Mishap Investigation Kits. Each MAJCOM determines the need for and the contents of
   investigation kits. A recommended list of contents is in AFP 127-1, US Air Force Guide to Mishap
   Investigations, Chapter 2. Safety staffs with host base responsibilities will maintain a mishap
   response and investigation kit sufficient to meet initial response and interim safety investigation board
   requirements.
   2.4.3. (AFMC) AFMC units with a flying mission will maintain a mishap investigation kit per
   requirements in AFPAM 91-211, Section A2B. Bases may modify kit contents based on unique center
   missions or responsibilities.

2.5. Office Administration:
   2.5.1. ALSAFECOM Messages. Handle and distribute these messages as described in Chapter 5.
   2.5.2. Mishap, Safety Inspection, and Hazard Reports. Maintain and dispose of all reports created
   or received according to AFMAN 37-123, Management of Records, AFI 37-138, Records Disposition
   - Responsibilities and Procedures, and AFMAN 37-139, Records Disposition Schedule.

2.6. Publications Library. Air Force safety offices normally establish a publications library. When a
master publication library and technical order library are readily available, the safety office needs to main-
tain only those publications that specifically apply to the safety program.
   2.6.1. Documents may be hard copy or in electronic format. The library should include:
       2.6.1.1. DoD standards and handbooks.
       2.6.1.2. Air Force policy directives, instructions, pamphlets, and TOs.
       2.6.1.3. AFOSH standards.
       2.6.1.4. Copies of AFSP 91-1, Flying Safety, AFSP 91-2, Road & Rec, and AFSP 91-3, Nuclear
       Surety and Weapons Safety Journal.
       2.6.1.5. Pertinent National Fire Protection Association and American National Standard Institute
       standards.
       2.6.1.6. Federal and military specifications and standards, OSHA, National Institute of Occupa-
       tional Safety and Health, National Safety Council, and commercial publications.
   2.6.2. The DoD Index of Specifications and Standards (DoDISS) lists Federal and military specifica-
   tions and standards. Acquire publications that you cannot obtain through the supporting Publications
   Distribution Office (PDO) or Technical Order Distribution Office through the supporting library.
22                                            AFI91-202_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 3 JUNE 2008


     2.6.3. The safety office advises the unit commander on how many magazines their units will need and
     ensures that they receive adequate distribution through the PDO or customer account representatives.
     AFI 37-160, Vol 7, Air Force Publications and Forms Management Programs--Publications Librar-
     ies and Sets, outlines responsibilities for keeping this type of library.

2.7. Air Force Councils and Committees. Safety councils and committees provide forums for discuss-
ing safety problems and keeping commanders, functional managers, and supervisors informed on the sta-
tus of the mishap prevention program. This allows for more proactive involvement at all functional levels
in mishap prevention and hazard identification.
     2.7.1. The wing or unit commander determines the need, frequency, agenda, and participants for all
     safety councils and committees except those required by public law. Commanders can form safety
     councils and committees at any level to focus group attention on safety or health problems. Any
     council or committee must satisfy a specific need and may not duplicate an existing management
     function.
     2.7.2. The occupational safety and health council is required by law and is convened according to
     AFI 91-301, Air Force Occupational and Environmental Safety, Fire Protection, and Health Pro-
     gram.

2.8. Non-US Air Force Councils and Committees. The Air Force supports federal, state, and local
safety councils and committees and encourages safety staffs to take part in them.

2.9. Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB) Safety Programs. The Air Force operates several
ranges established under DoDD 3200.11, Major Range and Test Facility Base. Operation of these
MRTFB ranges carries with it specific responsibilities for public safety. The overall goal of the range
safety program is to ensure safety consistent with operational requirements, which includes the prevention
of test objects, space launch vehicles, or their hazardous effects from violating established limits. MAJ-
COMs will establish safety policy for MRTFB activities. The wing commander of the unit operating the
MRTFB is considered the activity commander. Under the direction of the MAJCOM concerned, the
activity commander will:
2.9. (AFMC) Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB) Safety Programs. AFMC units operat-
ing Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB) shall conduct a range safety program. As part of a
range safety program, AFMC test ranges shall ensure all programs operating on the range have a system
safety program in place to ensure public safety and protection of government resources and personnel.
The user’s system safety program shall have a documented system safety program plan, trained and qual-
ified system safety staff, and an adequate hazard identification and mitigation plan.
     2.9.1. Ensure safety is consistent with operational requirements. Risk should be quantified and
     acceptable limits established. Additional risk should be accepted at an appropriate level.
     2.9.1. (AFMC) AFMC range safety offices shall have a documented process to review coordinate,
     and accept risk to an appropriate approval level. DODI 5000.2, AFI 91-202, and AFI 91-202/AFMC
     Sup 1 shall be guides to determine the appropriate risk approval authority. Documented processes
     shall be made available to HQ AFMC/SES. All high or serious (medium) risks shall be coordinated
     with HQ AFMC/SES on the way to the approval authority.
     2.9.2. Establish safety requirements and ensure all range users are in compliance.
AFI91-202_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 3 JUNE 2008                                                              23


  2.9.2. (AFMC) AFMC ranges shall coordinate changes to the range safety requirements with HQ
  AFMC/SES.
  2.9.3. Establish allowable ground and flight safety conditions and take appropriate action to ensure
  that test articles do not violate the conditions. Where the reliability of the test object is not estab-
  lished, appropriate measures should be taken to ensure it will not endanger the public or their property.
  2.9.3. (AFMC) When it becomes necessary to destroy test assets or terminate a test to protect public
  safety, the range safety office shall document the occurrence and provide an info copy to HQ AFMC/
  SES.

                                                        Chapter 3

       SAFETY INSPECTION, EVALUATION, ASSESSMENT, STAFF ASSISTANCE, AND
                                MONITORING

3.1. Safety Inspection. Safety inspections help identify hazards and measure compliance with safety
program requirements outlined in this instruction and AFI 91-301. Through inspections, the safety staff
helps the commander determine the condition of work areas, the safety of work practices, the degree of
compliance with safety and health standards, and the degree of compliance with safety program require-
ments. For GSUs, if the host base safety office conducts the facilities inspection annually, the GSU will
forward a copy of the report to the MAJCOM parent wing. The safety staff and functional managers will
ensure qualified inspectors inspect:
     All Air Force facilities and work areas once within a year, except as otherwise directed.
     High interest areas will be designated in writing and “spot” inspected monthly.
   At least 20 percent of unmanned missile launch facilities once a year. Select these launch facilities to
ensure that a representative segment of the unit's assets is inspected annually.
3.1. (AFMC) Safety Inspection. The safety staff will ensure all Air Force facilities and work areas
within an organization are assessed once each year. This assessment will follow the format in AFI 91-202
para 3.1.4.4. and will provide an in depth evaluation to the organizational commander of the status of the
organization’s safety program. This assessment will be conducted by completing the AFMC Risk Based
Assessment Worksheet, available at the HQ AFMC/SEG web-site, https://www.afmc-mil.wpafb.af.mil/
HQ-AFMC/SE/Ground/index.htm, and documented to determine if:
 - An inspection is required
 - An inspection is required in two years
 - An inspection is not required
     3.1.1. Administrative areas. Collateral duty, task-qualified safety personnel may conduct these
     inspections when the safety staff determines the mishap potential is minimal. The base safety staff
     develops specific provisions for meeting inspection requirements and conducts over-the-shoulder
     assessments of the collateral-duty personnel to ensure that their safety inspections are sound.
     3.1.1. (AFMC) The safety staff assesses administrative areas by completing the AFMC Risk Based
     A s s e s s m e n t Wo r k s h e e t , a v a i l a b l e a t t h e H Q A F M C / S E G w e b - s i t e , h t t p s : / /
     www.afmc-mil.wpafb.af.mil/HQ-AFMC/SE/Ground/index.htm. Results will be briefed to the
     commander/director.
     3.1.2. Non-Administrative areas. Functional managers, and supervisors inspect all work areas peri-
     odically, through spot inspections. The Chief of Safety will determine the frequency of spot inspec-
     tions and ensure activities that operate around-the-clock are adequately surveyed at times other than
     normal duty hours.
     3.1.2. (AFMC) Safety personnel inspect all work areas through spot inspections. Each safety special-
     ist will conduct a minimum of 5 spot inspections per week and document the results of these inspec-
     tions in a database system as determined by the COS. Numbers of spot inspections are recorded
     during annual assessments.
AFI91-202_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 3 JUNE 2008                                                              25


     3.1.2.1. (Added-HILL) Each Additional Duty Weapon Safety Manager (ADWSM) will conduct
     a minimum of one spot inspection monthly and document the results in any database or manual
     tracking system.
  3.1.3. Safety Inspection Responsibilities. The host safety staff inspects units that do not have an
  authorized, full-time safety position in a particular discipline. The host performs the required annual
  inspection for those safety areas:
  3.1.3. (AFMC) The AFMC Risk Based Assessment Worksheet, available at the HQ AFMC/SEG
  web-site, https://www.afmc-mil.wpafb.af.mil/HQ-AFMC/SE/Ground/index.htm, may be used to
  determine inspection frequency for tenant units.
     3.1.3.1. Unless a host-tenant agreement requires otherwise, the parent or gaining unit or com-
     mand inspects units not supported by an Air Force base.
     3.1.3.2. If their mishap potential is low, remotely located units of approximately 25 people or less
     may not need an annual inspection by a safety staff. In these cases, the MAJCOM determines
     other provisions for meeting annual inspection requirements.
     3.1.3.3. (Added-AFMC) Ground and Weapons Safety personnel assigned to Maintenance will
     perform annual safety inspections on all assigned facilities and programs and forward the results
     of those inspections to the ALC Safety Office.
     3.1.3.4. (Added-AFMC) In Maintenance, safety inspection reports will go to the Maintenance
     Commander and copies will be sent to the shop supervisor, Branch Chief, and Division Chief of
     the shop inspected
  3.1.4. Safety Inspection Procedures:
     3.1.4.1. Scheduling Inspections. Safety staffs may designate inspections as "prior-notice" or
     "no-notice." Annual flight, ground, and weapons inspections should be conducted jointly when
     possible. Also, when possible, combine safety inspections with other inspections to reduce the
     number of inspections a unit receives.
     3.1.4.2. Personal Consultations. Inspectors must consult with workplace personnel and their
     union representatives on matters affecting their safety and health and give them the opportunity to
     identify unsafe and unhealthy working conditions, equipment, and practices. Conduct such con-
     sultations privately and do not identify employees who want to remain anonymous. Be careful not
     to offer anyone a formal grant of confidentiality.
     3.1.4.3. Inspection Checklists. Use inspection checklists, especially for items common to several
     units or facilities. Make checklists available to the supervisors of the activities slated for inspec-
     tion.
     3.1.4.4. Safety Inspection Reports. Report annual inspections in writing. Send formal reports to
     the unit commander, the supervisor, and functional manager. In tenant units, send a copy of the
     report to the parent safety office. These reports must contain:
     3.1.4.4. (AFMC) Completed copies of the AFMC Risk Based Assessment Worksheet, available
     at the HQ AFMC/SEG web-site, https://www.afmc-mil.wpafb.af.mil/HQ-AFMC/SE/
     index.htm, are provided to unit commanders/directors during a conference that discusses assess-
     ment and clarifies any related safety issues. File copies of each organization’s assessments are
     maintained in the ground safety office.
26                                            AFI91-202_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 3 JUNE 2008


            3.1.4.4.1. The unit, activity, or work area inspected.
            3.1.4.4.2. The date of the inspection.
            3.1.4.4.3. A description of any hazards or unsafe work practices, noted with reference.
            3.1.4.4.4. Causes of deficiencies and hazards noted.
            3.1.4.4.5. Recommendations for corrective action.
            3.1.4.4.6. Risk assessment codes (RAC) for identified hazards, where applicable.
            3.1.4.4.6. (AFMC) All findings on annual inspection reports will be annotated with risk
            assessment codes and placed into AFSAS, as applicable.
            3.1.4.4.7. Management and supervisory support compliance.
        3.1.4.5. Follow-up actions. Use spot inspections and follow-up reporting to ensure corrective
        action is taken and the hazards are mitigated.

3.2. Safety Program Evaluation. At least once every three years, qualified safety personnel must eval-
uate the safety program management of each organization at wing or installation level and higher.
3.2. (AFMC) Safety Program Evaluation. Safety Program Management Evaluations (SPMEs) will be
conducted on a scheduled basis, at least once every 3 years, for each organization that has at least one
full-time safety person. SPMEs may be conducted simultaneously with other AFMC inspection or assess-
ment teams (Environmental, Safety, and Occupational Health Compliance Assessment Management Pro-
grams (ESOHCAMPs) or Inspector General activities) or independently based on scheduling. SPMEs
may include AFMC tenants on other MAJCOM bases.
     3.2.1. Command Units--Wing Level and Above. The higher headquarters evaluates the safety pro-
     gram management of organizations at or above the wing level as required by OSHA. Conduct evalu-
     ations with prior notice.
     3.2.1. (AFMC) AFMC will evaluate centers/units and direct reporting units (DRU’s). Team compo-
     sition will consist of members from HQ AFMC/SE or, if necessary, augmentation from Center-level
     personnel.
     3.2.2. Evaluation Scope. Safety program management evaluations address the areas of command
     and functional manager support, compliance with program directives, and the effectiveness of mishap
     prevention programs.
     3.2.2. (AFMC) Evaluators will conduct SPMEs using the AFMC SPME Checklists, which are avail-
     able on the HQ AFMC/SE website, https://www.afmc-mil.wpafb.af.mil/HQ-AFMC/SE/
     index.htm.
NOTE: These checklists are not all-inclusive and compliance with all governing instructions and publi-
cations is mandatory.
        3.2.2.1. (Added-AFMC) A three-tier rating system consists of the ratings: Satisfactory, Mar-
        ginal, and Unsatisfactory. After a base-line of evaluations, two additional tiers of Excellent and
        Outstanding may be added to further differentiate strong programs. Evaluation team chiefs may
        assign ratings that accurately reflect observed performance regardless of statistical outcomes. Spe-
        cific criteria are designed as a guide but are not a substitute for the judgment of the evaluator.
AFI91-202_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 3 JUNE 2008                                                               27


       However, when ratings differ significantly from established criteria, the rational should be
       explained. Individual discipline SPME ratings defined as follows:
          3.2.2.1.1. (Added-AFMC) SATISFACTORY: Demonstrates procedures and activities that
          meet requirements, as defined in AFIs.
          3.2.2.1.2. (Added-AFMC) MARGINAL: Failed to meet program requirements outlined in
          Safety AFIs, but oversight of units operate safely and do not demonstrate systemic operational
          deficiencies within unit safety programs.
          3.2.2.1.3. (Added-AFMC) UNSATISFACTORY: Does not meet minimum safety require-
          ments and negatively affect indicated areas of operation or performance. Procedures and activ-
          ities are not carried out in a safe and efficient manner. Safety deficiencies exist that impede or
          limit mission accomplishment.
   3.2.3. Evaluation Reports . Prepare a written report for each evaluation. Send a copy of the report
   to the commander and safety staff of the organization evaluated.
   3.2.3. (AFMC) Evaluation reports will identify the current existing health of the safety program
   focusing on those areas not meeting standards as well as areas that meet or exceed standards. Reports
   will be provided to DRU, or center/unit commanders, as applicable, and Chief/Director of Safety.
   3.2.4. (Added-AFMC) The center/unit has 30 days after receipt of the report to provide AFMC/SE
   an initial corrective action response. The organization being evaluated can not close out a finding
   without concurrence from the evaluating organization (HQ AFMC/SE). The evaluated unit can rec-
   ommend an item for closure and with concurrence from the evaluating organization, the item is con-
   sidered closed. Any finding requiring action or remaining OPEN should have an estimated closure
   date (ECD) for each finding. Unit responses will be validated by AFMC/SE to ensure corrective
   actions appropriately mitigate program findings. Units will track and monitor all open findings and
   provide 90-days follow-up reports to AFMC/SE until all findings have been closed out. The response
   and the follow-up reports should use the AFMC standard response format and be electronically sent to
   afmc.se.v3@wpafb.af.mil.

3.3. Assessments. Qualified safety personnel periodically assess the safety program management of each
organization below wing level as required by DoD and this instruction.. These assessments should cover
all safety disciplines. You may conduct assessments in conjunction with the annual safety inspection.
Conduct assessments with prior notice.
3.3. (AFMC) Assessments. Qualified ground safety personnel (as defined in para 2.1.3.) assess the
ground safety program of each organization within the center/base.
   3.3.1. Wings and groups with GSUs, Detachments, or Operating Locations (OL) will perform a safety
   program assessment of each activity at intervals not to exceed 3 years. Include a safety inspection as
   part of the safety program assessment of the activity.
   3.3.1. (AFMC) Center/base ground safety personnel perform a safety program assessment of geo-
   graphically separated units (GSUs), Detachments, or Operating Locations (OLs) at intervals not to
   exceed one year.
   3.3.2. Wing and groups will conduct unit safety program assessments of all GSUs at intervals not to
   exceed 36 months. If requested by the GSU commander and if manpower and funds are available to
   support the GSUs request the assessment may be conducted more frequently.
28                                             AFI91-202_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 3 JUNE 2008


     3.3.3. Assessment Scope. Safety program management assessments address command and func-
     tional manager support, compliance with program directives, and the effectiveness of mishap preven-
     tion programs, including an analysis of unit mishap reports and other management indicators.
     3.3.4. Assessment Reports. Prepare a written report for each assessment. You may include assess-
     ment reports with inspection reports, but you must prepare them as separate sections. Send a copy of
     the assessment report to the commander of the organization assessed.
     3.3.4. (AFMC) Completed copies of the AFMC Risk Based Assessment Worksheet, available at the
     HQ AFMC/SEG web-site, https://www.afmc-mil.wpafb.af.mil/HQ-AFMC/SE/Ground/
     index.htm, are provided to unit commanders/directors during an informal conference that discusses
     assessment and clarifies any safety related issues. File copies of each organization’s assessments are
     maintained in the center ground safety office.

3.4. Staff Assistance. Safety staffs at all command levels visit subordinate units when problems, defi-
ciencies, or special subjects require on-scene assistance. Visits may also be necessary when units imple-
ment new missions, equipment, or programs that impact mishap prevention programs. The objective is to
help develop solutions, not to inspect or evaluate. Give a report to the visited unit's commander, if
requested. Do not require replies unless the action started during the visit needs monitoring by the higher
headquarters safety staff or requires further staff action above the level of the visited unit. The staff assis-
tance visit program is designed to provide a high degree of flexibility in determining which units to visit
and the functional safety areas involved. The purpose of staff assistance program is to provide assistance
to unit safety personnel by reviewing their management and administrative procedures for effectiveness
and providing recommendations for improvement.
3.4. (AFMC) Staff Assistance. To ensure the safety program effectiveness HQ AFMC/SE will conduct
staff assistance visits (SAV) at the mid-point of the cycle between SPMEs.

3.5. Contract Monitoring. If safety personnel are required to conduct a safety quality assurance evalua-
tions (QAE) function, QAE training is required locally through Base Contracting. NOTE: AF Safety
personnel must not put anything in a contract that establishes a requirement for the Air Force to protect
contractor employees or their equipment. Likewise, do not include anything in inspection or surveillance
programs to give the perception that the Air Force is supervising or observing contractor personnel to pro-
vide for their personal safety or to ensure the safety of their equipment. Requirements for protection of
the general public may be included, (for example, barriers around trenches). Air Force safety personnel
must avoid taking actions that put them in direct control of a work site or contractor employees. If an Air
Force inspector notices a potential OSHA violation, he/she should report the hazard to the contracting
officer, who can remind the contractor of the obligation under the contract to comply with all pertinent
regulations. Unless there is imminent danger, Air Force personnel (other than a contracting officer)
should avoid reporting safety violations directly to the contractor. Similarly, Air Force personnel should
not perform safety inspections of worksites and contract Statements of work (SOW) should not require
Air Force inspections.

3.6. High Interest Areas. These areas have the greatest risk to life or property damage, have experi-
enced repeated mishaps, or in the judgment of the appropriate (ground, flight, weapons, or space) safety
discipline requires added monitoring. These inspections may be no-notice or scheduled and the MAJ-
COM, Numbered AF, and/or host installation safety office establishes the documentation requirements.
AFI91-202_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 3 JUNE 2008                                                            29


3.6. (AFMC) High Interest Areas. Documentation of High Interest Area inspections will be maintained
in the center or installation safety office for a period of 2 years.

3.7. Monitoring. Monitoring is a continuous, informal surveillance of operations to ensure adequate
control of hazards and compliance with safety program objectives. Spot inspections and surveillance are
ways to fulfill this requirement.
   3.7.1. Spot Inspections. Spot inspections are no-notice to check the day-to-day safety and health of
   an organization, workcenter, facility, etc. The MAJCOM, Numbered AF, and/or host installation
   safety office establishes documentation requirements for spot inspections. Minimum documentation
   will include date, inspector’s name, organization or activity inspected, unit point of contact, and a
   brief description of what was observed, if there was/was not a discrepancy and of the status (open/
   closed).
   3.7.1. (AFMC) Spot inspections are not required for system safety programs. Spot inspections are
   one of the most important tools of mishap prevention and will include all areas of the installation.
   Conduct at least five spot inspections per week per ground, flight, and weapons staff member (COS
   not included); conduct 10 percent outside of normal duty hours. Each safety office will keep a record
   of spot inspections performed. The COS, GSM, Weapon Safety Manager (WSM), and chief of flight
   safety will review spot inspection records monthly to ensure the program is being vigorously pursued,
   and that all facilities and work areas are spot-inspected at least once annually.
       3.7.1.1. (Added-AFMC) The center/installation will establish spot inspection and documentation
       requirements (frequency and documentation) for directorate safety staff and additional duty Unit
       Safety Representatives (USRs).
   3.7.2. Surveillance. Surveillance is a monitoring tool that can also assist in checking the day-to-day
   activities of an organization. No documentation is necessary for surveillance unless unsafe conditions

                                   HAZARD REPORTING PROGRAM

4.1. What Hazards To Report. Mishap prevention depends on personnel identifying, reporting, and
correcting hazards promptly and efficiently. Any person assigned, attached, or under contract to the Air
Force may report a hazard. Submit a hazard report on any event or condition that affects flight, ground,
weapons, or space safety. Reportable hazards include unsafe procedures, practices, or conditions. The
reporting requirement in this paragraph is exempt from licensing in accordance with AFI 37-123, para-
graph 2.11.6, The Information Collection and Reports Management Program: Controlling Internal, Pub-
lic, and Interagency Air Force Information Collection.
4.1. (AFMC) What Hazards to Report. During all phases of a program's acquisition life cycle,
design-related hazards are found through the hazard analysis process outlined in MIL-STD-882. Hazards
identified during the acquisition process will be promptly identified to the responsible program manage-
ment authorities for appropriate resolution actions.

4.2. Reporting Criteria. Submit hazard reports unless personnel can take corrective action under this
AFI or any of these Air Force publications:
     4.2.1. AFI 11-215, Flight Manuals Program.
     4.2.2. AFI 91-204, Investigating and Reporting US Air Force Mishaps.
     4.2.3. TO 00-5-1, Air Force Technical Order System.
     4.2.4. TO 00-35D-54, USAF Materiel Deficiency Reporting System.
     4.2.5. AFI 51-1101, Air Force Procurement Fraud Remedies Program

4.3. Reporting Procedures:
     4.3.1. Report hazards to the responsible supervisor or local agency. If the hazard is eliminated on the
     spot, no further action is required unless it applies to other similar operations or to other units or agen-
     cies.
     4.3.2. If the hazard presents imminent danger, the supervisor or individual responsible for that area
     must take immediate action to correct the situation or apply interim control measures.
     4.3.3. Report hazards that cannot be eliminated immediately to the safety office by AF Form 457,
     USAF Hazard Report (HR), by telephone or in person. Reports can be submitted anonymously.
     4.3.4. The safety staff investigates the HR. The investigator discusses the HR with the member who
     submitted the report (if known), the responsible supervisor or manager, and other parties involved to
     validate the hazard and determine the best interim control and corrective action.
     4.3.5. If the hazard is validated:
        4.3.5.1. The investigator assigns a RAC, a HR control number, and monitors corrective action
        until complete.
AFI91-202_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 3 JUNE 2008                                                               31


       4.3.5.2. The investigator completes the HR's Part II, "Summary of Investigation," and sends it
       promptly to the individual responsible for making sure corrective action is completed and the haz-
       ard eliminated or controlled.
       4.3.5.3. The responsible individual completes Part II, "Action Taken," within 10 working days
       and returns the HR to the safety office for monitoring.
       4.3.5.4. The investigator tells the originator (if known) about the corrective action and conducts
       follow-up reviews until the action is completed. The investigator informs the originator (if
       known), about the completed action within 10 workdays after the report is closed.
   4.3.6. If the HR response is not satisfactory to the reporting member, the member may submit a
   reevaluation request according to AFI 91-301.
   4.3.6. (AFMC) The submitter will be advised that if he or she is not satisfied with the response to the
   hazard report (HR) that it will be locally reevaluated and reviewed at one level higher than the original
   evaluation. If still not satisfied, the HR will be forwarded to HQ AFMC/SE for further evaluation.
   4.3.7. HRs that generate an AF Form 3, Hazard Abatement Plan, may be closed and corrective action
   monitored through the hazard abatement process. See AFI 91-301 for further action required for AF
   Form 3 processing.

4.4. Additional Reporting Procedures:
   4.4.1. Transient personnel unable to report a hazard at a base where it is found, submits the HR to the
   next Air Force base they visit, or to the safety office at their home base. That safety office sends the
   report to the responsible base safety offices.
   4.4.2. The safety office sends reports on hazards that cannot be corrected at the local level to the
   agencies that can take appropriate action.
   4.4.3. Tenant personnel send hazard reports involving activities for which the host is responsible to
   the host base safety office for processing.
   4.4.4. Send hazard reports by message if they require urgent action. Send messages to the safety
   office at the headquarters where action can be taken. List units with similar equipment as information
   addressees.
   4.4.5. Persons identifying hazards involving weather forecasting must submit hazard reports as soon
   as possible to ensure that records are not destroyed. Promptly after landing, aircraft commanders
   advise the appropriate facility providing air weather services of their intention to submit a hazard
   report. If necessary, notify these facilities by message.
   4.4.6. Base safety offices send hazard reports that involve other military services, foreign nations, or
   agencies outside the Air Force to HQ USAF/SE, 9700 G Ave SE, Kirtland AFB NM 87117-5670 and
   to the affected Air Force units and their chain of command as information addressees. AF Form 130
   should be submitted to HQ AFCIC/ITIA, 1250 AF Pentagon, Washington DC 20330 for a Report
   Control Symbol control number assignment.
   4.4.6. (AFMC) Forward such reports through HQ AFMC/SE.

4.5. Promoting the Program. The unit’s commander ensures the AF Form 457 is available to all unit
personnel. The base safety office will maintain a small quantity of the forms to help ensure availability by
32                                         AFI91-202_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 3 JUNE 2008


base personnel. The safety office must respond promptly (within 10 working days) to the reporting mem-
ber on their findings, status of the AF Form 457, and any recommendations.

               MISHAP PREVENTION INFORMATION AND DATA ANALYSIS

5.1. Information Protection. Analyzing and distributing mishap prevention information are key ele-
ments in mishap prevention. All safety mishap reports, except Class A and B “8-hour” messages, are "For
Official Use Only" (FOUO). For FOUO handling procedures, see AFI 37-131, Air Force Freedom of
Information Act Program. Some safety mishap reports require additional handling restrictions as privi-
leged reports. See AFI 91-204 for further information and handling restrictions.
   5.1.1. Privileged and FOUO controls protect the parts of the report that personnel provided in confi-
   dence or conclusions investigators derived from those parts. Use mishap reports only for mishap pre-
   vention and limit access to these reports. The safety staff must brief everyone with access to
   privileged safety or privacy act information on the proper handling procedures annually. See AFI
   91-204 for more information.
   5.1.2. To provide wider dissemination, sanitize mishap information by removing the parts that make
   it privileged. AFI 91-204 describes the method for sanitizing privileged reports.

5.2. Action Information:
   5.2.1. Mishap Reports. Send reports of Air Force mishaps as directed by AFI 91-204. Many of
   these reports have recommendations needing urgent action by some addressees. Consider mishap
   reports to be action documents.
   5.2.2. ALSAFECOM Messages. The Air Force Chief of Safety (HQ USAF/SE) uses the ALSAFE-
   COM message to rapidly distribute critical safety information. HQ USAF/SE sends these messages to
   each MAJCOM commander and director (or chief) of safety. The messages convey mishap preven-
   tion data and often require action to eliminate hazards.
   5.2.3. After receiving an ALSAFECOM message, each director or chief of safety:
       5.2.3.1. Reviews the message and sends it to the agencies and units that need to take action.
       5.2.3.2. Keeps a file of ALSAFECOM messages that are applicable to the unit.
       5.2.3.3. Annotates the message to show its distribution and the actions the unit takes in response
       to the reported hazard or mishap.

5.3. Advisory Information:
   5.3.1. Recurring Publications. The AFSC, Major Commands (MAJCOMs), Air Force Reserve, and
   Air National Guard may produce recurring publications providing education and training in mishap
   prevention.
       5.3.1.1. Purpose and Scope. The goal of these documents is to prevent mishaps in operating and
       maintaining aircraft and associated equipment and facilities, storing and handling explosives, con-
       ducting industrial operations, operating government and privately owned vehicles, and participat-
       ing in off-duty sports and recreation. The publications also provide educational information on
       implementing OSHA standards and in establishing and maintaining nuclear surety and environ-
       mental safety programs.
34                                             AFI91-202_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 3 JUNE 2008


        5.3.1.2. Air Force military members and civilian employees, including Air Force Reserve and Air
        National Guard units and members, are the primary audience of special publications. The second-
        ary audience is other DoD and non-DoD personnel supporting Air Force missions. A one-for-one
        safety publication exchange is authorized with foreign militaries where such action clearly sup-
        ports mishap prevention purposes and is in the US Government’s best interest. This exchange of
        information provides an open forum for mishap prevention ideas and programs.
        5.3.1.3. The Commander, AFSC, will issue recurring publications pertaining to the entire Air
        Force mishap prevention program. MAJCOMs, Air Force Reserve, and Air National Guard may
        issue recurring publications pertaining to mishap prevention in their unique missions.
        5.3.1.4. Operating Policies. The office of primary responsibility (OPR) for each document will
        determine the number of pages and frequency of publication.
            5.3.1.4.1. Each OPR will act as its own reviewing authority for document contents.
            5.3.1.4.2. Each OPR will establish a distribution ratio to control distribution of recurring pub-
            lications. Publication Distribution Offices (PDOs) will distribute the publications to organiza-
            tions at Air Force installations. The OPR will make distribution to units without a PDO by the
            most economical means.
     5.3.2. Periodic Summaries. HQ AFSC sends periodic mishap summaries to the MAJCOM safety
     staffs. These summaries include recent mishap experience, mishap statistics, analyses of current
     problem areas, and proposed changes in safety policy. Regular summaries include:
        5.3.2.1. Blue Four News. HQ AFSC/SEF sends monthly Blue Four News messages to safety
        offices throughout the Air Force, summarizing the previous month's Class A flight mishaps and
        commenting on the trends that the mishaps indicate. This summary is to be controlled as a “priv-
        ileged” report since dates, times, and mishap specifics.
        5.3.2.2. How Goes It in Ground Safety. HQ AFSC/SEG sends this message on an as needed basis
        but not less than semi-annually to all Air Force safety offices and the Army and Naval Safety Cen-
        ters to provide updates on ground safety issues and activities.
        5.3.2.3. Hurtline and OUCH. These HQ AFSC/SEG quarterly messages provide a summary and
        analysis of Air Force Class A, B, and C mishaps for all Air Force Safety offices.
        5.3.2.4. Ground Safety Spotlight. This HQ AFSC/SEG sends this message on an as needed basis
        but not less than quarterly to all Air Force offices to provide safety interest items from recent mis-
        haps, injuries, compensation cost data, or resource protection needs.
        5.3.2.5. OSHA Chronicles. HQ AFSC/SEG sends this message on an as needed basis but not less
        than semi-annually to all Air Force safety offices to provide information on OSHA visits to Air
        Force installations giving a synopsis of findings and citations to prevent reoccurrence.
        5.3.2.6. AFSP 91-1, Flying Safety. Focuses on all aspects of flying safety to include mishap
        investigations, the wildlife hazard reduction (BASH) program, as well as command-generated
        articles and mishap prevention concerns.
        5.3.2.7. AFSP 91-3, Nuclear Surety and Weapons Safety Journal. HQ AFSC/SEW writes articles
        focusing on all aspects of weapons and space safety as well as nuclear surety. In every issue of
        this journal, HQ AFSC/SEW discusses conventional and nuclear weapon mishap trends and
        potential methods of prevention.
AFI91-202_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 3 JUNE 2008                                                             35


       5.3.2.8. AFSP 91-2, Road & Rec. Focuses on all aspects of ground safety to include mishap
       investigations as well as command-generated articles and mishap prevention concerns.
   5.3.3. MAJCOM Publications. MAJCOMs should publish either a safety magazine, newsletter, or
   safety kit to aid in the dissemination of command-specific safety information.

5.4. Methods of Distribution. Select an appropriate distribution method by considering your content,
time available, and audience. Some suggested methods of distributing advisory information are:
   5.4.1. Periodic safety meetings.
   5.4.2. Supervisor safety briefings.
   5.4.3. Base newspapers and bulletins.
   5.4.4. Safety publications.
   5.4.5. AFSC or MAJCOM publications.
NOTE: The MAJCOM chief of safety decides whether to distribute summaries to subordinate units.

5.5. Mishap Analysis Programs. Full-time safety staffs at all levels should develop locally oriented
mishap analysis programs to evaluate mishap statistics and identify trends. Managers develop local pro-
grams to formulate intervention efforts by determining the root causes for mishaps. When setting up an
analysis program:
   5.5.1. Identify successes or problem areas and trends, measure safety program effectiveness, and
   guide prevention actions.
   5.5.2. Make sure that the program is flexible enough to allow for additional changes.
   5.5.3. Some healthy prevention programs are characterized by large numbers of reports (indicating
   safety awareness on the part of submitters), while others may see few or no reports (including a safe
   operating environment)
   5.5.4. (Added-AFMC) The COS will ensure an ongoing, comprehensive safety mishap analysis pro-
   gram is in place for all safety disciplines. Analyze and track reportable and non-reportable mishaps,
   inspection reports, hazard reports and abatement forms, and seat belt surveys. Investigate all unfavor-
   able safety trends. Ensure each trend analysis includes an introduction, overview, and conclusion.
   Identify adverse trends, and provide recommended action to eliminate them. Identify appropriate
   action agencies. Use analyses to:
       5.5.4.1. (Added-AFMC) Inform commanders.
       5.5.4.2. (Added-AFMC) Prepare briefings.
       5.5.4.3. (Added-AFMC) Brief occupational safety and health councils.
       5.5.4.4. (Added-AFMC) Update inspection checklists.
       5.5.4.5. (Added-AFMC) Plan special or spot inspections.
       5.5.4.6. (Added-AFMC) Plan special safety programs.
       5.5.4.7. (Added-AFMC) Inform base personnel through media channels.

5.6. Standard Mishap Rates. Safety staffs at the MAJCOM level and above can compute the standard
rates for their organization. Care must be taken to ensure the statistic validity of the rates. Information on
mishap rates can be obtained by calling AFSC/SEC. The Air Force Safety Center uses standardized rates
for
     5.6.1. Flight mishaps
     5.6.2. Federal Employee’s Compensation Act Lost Time Injury/Illnesses
     5.6.3. On-Duty Ground Mishaps
     5.6.4. Off-duty Ground Mishap
     5.6.5. Combined On- and Off-duty Mishap

5.7. Mishap Prevention Analysis Methods. One way to approach analysis is to divide it into two broad
functions: monitor and study. The monitor function is an ongoing task, while the study function is a spe-
cific effort directed to a particular problem.
     5.7.1. Monitor Function. In this method, the safety staff selects categories of raw data and reviews
     them regularly in the form of tabulations or rates. The object is to identify trends and problem areas.
     Selection of the areas to be monitored depends on the available data and the needs of the organization.
     Mishap reports are a good place to start, but other areas should not be overlooked. Some other cate-
     gories that may be appropriate for analysis are:
        5.7.1.1. Hazardous Air Traffic Reports
        5.7.1.2. High Accident Potential (HAP)
        5.7.1.3. Deficiency Reports
        5.7.1.4. Inspection/Assessment Reports
        5.7.1.5. Foreign Object Damage Reports
        5.7.1.6. First-Aid Injury Reports
        5.7.1.7. Maintenance Logs or Reports
     5.7.2. Study Function. This process requires a much more detailed examination of a problem area.
     There are no specific ground rules on how to do it; the nature of the problem and the data available
     tend to dictate the way to go. First, it is best to draft an objective statement that describes the problem
     and limits the study. An example is: “Determine why ‘X’ is increasing.” Next identifying factors and
     data that affect the problem. Then develop a plan on how these factors and data area going to be col-
     lected, tabulated, compared, plotted, and calculated. Finally, collect the data, analyze it, and come up
     with conclusions that answer the objective statement. Without conclusions, the study is of no value.
        5.7.2.1. Limitations:
            5.7.2.1.1. Availability of Data. The type and depth of analysis that can be done at each level
            depends on the amount of data available. As a rule, small amounts of data cause large changes
            in rates and trends which can be misleading. To get large amounts of data, it is often better to
            add the exposure of several small units or to use data for a longer period of time. Another
            method is to add near mishaps to the reportable ones. This not only expands the data base but
AFI91-202_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 3 JUNE 2008                                                               37


           it often gives a better picture of the root causes. For example, when analyzing operational
           injuries, look at all the injuries that occurred on the job, not just the reportable ones.
           5.7.2.1.2. Rates. Mishap rates are often misused because the limitations are not considered.
           Rates do not reflect responsibility for mishaps. By themselves, rates do not measure or reflect
           all the factors that influence exposure. They should not be used as the sole basis for determin-
           ing the success of prevention efforts. Any raw data (aircraft tire failures, for example) can be
           divided by an exposure (number of landings) to give a rate. That, in itself, has no value unless
           it can be compared to other like rates or computed often to set a trend. Rates can also be mis-
           leading if the exposure is small or if the mishaps considered have little in common.
           5.7.2.1.3. Tabulations. Tabulations normally do not reflect trends because exposure is not
           considered. Tabulated data plotted per unit of time, such as number of injuries each month,
           can show a trend graphically. Trends derived in this way must be used with caution because
           the exposure factor may not be accurate. The number of injuries per month, for example,
           might be meaningless if population, mission, emphasis on treatment, or disability compensa-
           tion rules change.
           5.7.2.1.4. Trends. When the data base is small, a few mishaps can cause large changes in rates
           and make it difficult to determine trends. To get large amounts of data, it is often necessary to
           add the data from several units or weapons systems. The resulting trends may be mathemati-
           cally accurate but might not apply to any specific system. To set trends, it is best to use the
           most data available, defined in the narrowest way possible. There are several recognized ways
           of smoothing large clumps in rates to establish a reasonably valid trend. One way is to carry
           rates cumulatively for a period of 12 months rather than by calendar year. Starting rates at zero
           each year works well at the Air Force and MAJCOM level but may not at lower levels.

5.8. Use of Analysis Data. The purpose of analysis is to help prevent mishaps. Present conclusions
drawn in a useful format to the people who can use them directly in their prevention programs. The data
should also be available to other organizations with like equipment or problems. After taking corrective
actions, follow-up analysis may be done to measure the effectiveness of these actions.

5.9. Metrics.
   5.9.1. Mishap metrics (calculated as a number of successful events against some kind of total event
   exposure) are an effective way to compare the actions and accomplishments of your unit. Compari-
   sons between other organizations or MAJCOMs may be misleading based on differences in opera-
   tions, environment, equipment, or other variables. The metrics used by the safety community to this
   point have focused on results - the number of mishaps experienced over time relative to exposure.
   While this “bottom line” information is useful, it is incomplete. A mishap rate alone cannot explain
   the most critical information needed by commanders--feedback proving that a particular effort caused
   the result. In most safety offices today, we are pleased when the mishap rate is down, but we cannot
   satisfactorily explain why. When the mishap rate is up, we tend to choose short-term solutions to this
   long term-problem. The answer to the metrics dilemma is to decide on a set of safety performance
   measurements that precede mishap data and have a reasonable expectation of positively impacting the
   mishap rate.
   5.9.2. Most quality-based assessment programs advise against the use of “negative metrics.” The
   appropriate use of metrics is particularly important within the safety function, since some use of neg-
38                                            AFI91-202_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 3 JUNE 2008


     ative indicators is unavoidable (see AFPD 91-2). While each mishap represents a “failure to prevent,”
     there is currently no corresponding way of measuring “successful prevention.”
     5.9.3. Hazardous air traffic reports (Chapter 7), hazard reports (Chapter 4), high accident potential,
     inspections and assessments (Chapter 3), and other reports submitted as a part of the Air Force Mis-
     hap Prevention Program under this instruction and AFI 91-204 are integral to the success of our over-
     all safety program. Significant numbers of such reports may indicate a developing adverse trend,
     while even a single Class C mishap report or hazard report could identify the potential for a far more
     serious loss. Accordingly, maximum reporting is an essential element of successful prevention and
     risk assessment and must in no way be discouraged. Therefore, the use of numbers of safety reports
     of any type as a metric is prohibited.
     5.9.4. Safety knowledge is one type of such data. Measuring safety knowledge is a good performance
     measurement that should be tracked with metrics. Poor judgment is a leading cause of Air Force
     reportable mishaps. In order to improve judgment decisions, individuals must have adequate knowl-
     edge and the right attitude (Good judgment = knowledge + attitude). Unit commanders and supervi-
     sors can positively influence their personnel by ensuring everyone maintains a high degree of safety
     knowledge. The level of safety knowledge can be measured by using surveys or tests, thus command-
     ers and supervisors reinforce the desired behavior. Individuals should be periodically surveyed for on
     and off-duty knowledge of basic safety principles, or job related safety standards. The safety knowl-
     edge areas that could be surveyed or tested:
        5.9.4.1. Seldom performed tasks such as emergency procedures
        5.9.4.2. Tasks that have a history of high mishap frequency
        5.9.4.3. Critical tasks where failure or mishap could jeopardize the mission
        5.9.4.4. Point-in-time, safety-related job knowledge could be displayed on a bar chart.
        5.9.4.5. Trend data for a particular AFSC could be displayed on a line or a control chart to observe
        the trend data over time.
     5.9.5. Feedback to safety-related behavior is essential. Below are three other potential metrics for
     measuring safety and hazard abatement.
        5.9.5.1. One such feedback mechanism is to link safety performance feedback to leadership
        requirements by identifying safety requirements as a stand-alone scoring item on feedback and
        performance reports. This metric would show leadership support for risk reduction management
        support and will increase the safety knowledge of the leadership and the individuals.
        5.9.5.2. The second possible metric would be to establish a metric that tracks letters of commen-
        dation, letters of admonishment, letters of counseling (positive and negative), letters of reprimand,
        and Article 15 actions for safety-related actions. This metric would show the units culture con-
        cerning safety-related activities.
        5.9.5.3. The last potential metric would be to track the cycle time for abatement actions. This
        would show the commander’s support for reducing the hazards in the unit by showing leaderships
        willingness to apply O&M dollars to abate hazards. Potential measurements can be:
            5.9.5.3.1. The number of days, months, or years that pass between problem recognition and
            problem resolution is clearly measurable. When measured and displayed, the information will
AFI91-202_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 3 JUNE 2008                                                        39


       display to the leadership the numbers of days that pass before significant safety problems are
       resolved.
       5.9.5.3.2. At the end of each reporting period, the major command could request closure time
       of all risk assessment code (RAC) items 1-4 assigned throughout the year. Risk assessment
       data to the RAC 4 level is meaningful since it shows a squadron leaderships resolve to fix the
       problem even the minor problems while RAC 1-3 are usually controlled by resources beyond
       the squadron financial and manpower capabilities.

7.6. Mishap Board Training. The FSO trains unit personnel identified to serve as basic aircraft mishap
investigation board members. Positions and qualification requirements are in AFI 91-204. MAJCOMs
determine the most effective interval and mode of training.
7.6. (AFMC) Mishap Board Training. Initial training (determined locally) will be given as soon as pos-
sible after being assigned as a Safety Investigation Board member and annually thereafter. Individuals
who attend formal safety schools (AMIC, FSO, JEMIC) are exempt from annual training until the next
annual training period.

7.7. US Air Force Hazard Reporting (HR) and Hazardous Air Traffic Report i ng (HATR) Pro-
grams RCS: HAF-SE (AR) 7602. The FSO investigates HRs according to Chapter 4 and HATRs
according to Attachment 3.

7.8. Aero Club Operations. The host unit commander appoints a FSO as an advisor to the base Aero
Club. If the host unit does not have an assigned FSO, the commander obtains the assistance of a tenant
unit FSO to provide safety assistance to the Aero Club. If there is no FSO available, the commander
appoints a member of the ground safety staff. The host safety office reports Aero Club mishaps according
to AFI 91-204, AFI 34-217, Air Force Aero Club Program, and 49 CFR, chapter VIII, National Transpor-
tation Safety Board, part 830, as appropriate. The Chief of Safety for the installation possessing the Aero
Club aircraft will use the procedures in AFI 91-204 chapters 7 and 11 for reporting these mishaps and will
determine the safety personnel who will investigate the mishap. For mishap prevention purposes, all Aero
Club aircraft are considered appropriated fund assets. All reports will be forwarded to HQ AFSC/SEF
and HQ AFSVA/SVPAR. Any Air Force investigation conducted under AFI 91-204 fulfills the Air Force
mishap reporting requirements of AFI 34-217 and shall not take precedence over or interfere with civil
aviation authorities or agencies investigating a non-Air Force aircraft mishap.
7.8. (AFMC) Aero Club Operations. Either a civilian or military FSO may act as advisor. Membership
and/or flying with the club is encouraged. Use of local funding is justifiable

7.9. Airfield Maintenance and Construction. FSOs and FSNCOs monitor routine airfield maintenance
and major construction projects. On major construction projects, the FSO reviews the initial plan for
compliance with AFJMAN 32-1013, Airfield and Heliport Planning and Design, (formerly AFR 86-14),
and attends the preconstruction conference or briefing to consider if it will effect unit operations. Con-
sider these factors:
7.9. (AFMC) Airfield Maintenance and Construction. Conduct a yearly review of the base compre-
hensive plan, status of open items, waived items, eliminated items and new buildings or improvements.
Be alert for building plans that may infringe on airfield clear zones.
     7.9.1. The inspection of areas before use.
     7.9.2. The impact of maintenance and construction on daily flying schedule and emergency situa-
     tions.
     7.9.3. The communications between the tower and contractor and the availability of the contracting
     agent.
     7.9.4. Controlling vehicular traffic on the airfield and designating haul routes for contractor trucks.
AFI91-202_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 3 JUNE 2008                                                               51

7.10. Midair Collision Avoidance (MACA) Program. Units with flying programs must establish a
MACA program. The unit safety office is responsible for its administration. The FSO works closely with
the MAJCOM-determined OPR and other interested parties such as the Chief Air Traffic Control Opera-
tions Officer (CATCO), the Airfield Operations Flight Commander (AOF/CC), the airspace manager, and
the local Flight Standards District Officer (FSDO), to establish a comprehensive MACA program. Tailor
the MACA program to meet local needs. Consider these key objectives when developing a MACA pro-
gram:
7.10. (AFMC) Midair Collision Avoidance (MACA) Program. Centers are the office of primary
responsibility for this program. Centers may consolidate MACA programs with other bases (AFMC, Air
Combat Command, Air Mobility Command, etc.) in the vicinity to reduce duplication of effort. This will
give the local aviation community a better understanding of military operations in the selected regions.
Use of Aero Club aircraft is encouraged as part of the outreach program. AFI 91-301/AFMC Supplement
1 provides more detail on the responsibilities of AFMC Ground Safety Managers.
   7.10.1. Ensure the free flow of MACA information between host and tenant organizations, effective
   communication between base and local airport managers and fixed base operators, and actively sup-
   port the HATR Program.
   7.10.2. Provide educational programs to increase the use of available radar services among civil air-
   craft.
   7.10.3. Use the resources and services of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) FSDO accident
   prevention specialists.
   7.10.4. Develop appropriate maps and graphics showing the base radar services and routes. Distrib-
   ute the maps to all civil airlines and pilots, base fixed operators, airports and other flying operations
   that use the surrounding airspace.
   7.10.5. Establish procedures to control VFR aircraft and minimize the air-traffic hazards.
   7.10.6. Deconflict MTRs as much as possible and acquaint the flying public with the location, config-
   uration, speeds, and altitudes of the base MTR and military operating areas through military and FAA
   personnel.
   7.10.7. Ensure that arrival and departure routes (including stereo routes and profile descents) mini-
   mize conflicts with runway traffic, nearby airfields, and local flying areas.
   7.10.8. Evaluate the midair collision potential with civil airlines and work with operators of nearby
   airfields to reduce risk and minimize the hazards.
   7.10.9. Develop a MACA pamphlet.

        7.11.1.3.1. Ensure each installation with flying operations has a written BASH plan and
        review the plan annually. Review tenant unit BASH plans if host installation belongs to
        another MAJCOM. ANG and AFRC will coordinate review process with gaining MAJCOM
        for each ANG and AFRC unit.
        7.11.1.3.2. Conduct on-site reviews of installation BASH programs at least every 36 months.
        ANG and AFRC will coordinate on-site reviews of each ANG and AFRC unit with the gaining
        MAJCOM for each unit.
        7.11.1.3.3. Consider potential wildlife strike hazards when developing or revising operational
        procedures, training routes, ranges, instrument approach and departure procedures, establish-
        ing MOAs or low altitude tactical navigation areas.
        7.11.1.3.4. Establish procedures to coordinate base improvement projects, i.e. base beautifica-
        tion , waste water treatment, golf courses etc., for BASH related issues.
     7.11.1.4. Wing, Base and Installation Safety Offices:
        7.11.1.4.1. Establish a BASH plan that meets command operational requirements.
        7.11.1.4.2. Each installation with flying operations must develop a contingency plan that lists
        responsibilities and procedures for wildlife control.
        7.11.1.4.3. Establish a Bird Hazard Working Group (BHWG) consisting of organizations
        involved in airfield bird control, habitat management, operations and safety. The BHWG must
        meet at least semi-annually with minutes maintained. The vice wing commander or equivalent
        will chair the meeting.
        7.11.1.4.4. Develop a Bird Hazard Warning System to inform aircrews of possible flight haz-
        ards due to bird activity in local areas. Bird Watch Condition (BWC) codes will be used to
        communicate local bird activity along with location, number and type of birds. BWC codes
        are defined as:
        7.11.1.4.5. SEVERE: Bird activity on or immediately above the active runway or other spe-
        cific location representing high potential for strikes. Supervisors and aircrews must thor-
        oughly evaluate mission need before conducting operations in areas under condition
        SEVERE.
        7.11.1.4.6. MODERATE: Bird activity near the active runway or other specific location rep-
        resenting increased potential for strikes. BWC moderate requires increased vigilance by all
        agencies and supervisors and caution by aircrews.
        7.11.1.4.7. LOW: Bird activity on and around the airfield representing low potential for
        strikes.

        activity information. Phase II represents heavy bird activity, normally associated with migra-
54                                             AFI91-202_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 3 JUNE 2008


            tory season. Publish Phase I and II designations in the appropriate DoD Flight Information
            Publications.
     7.11.2. Base Level BASH Program. Hose Air Force, Air Force Reserve, or Air National Guard,
     installations with flying operations must establish a BASH program. The BASH program will include
     all tenant flying units. The BASH program requires complete documentation of local wildlife haz-
     ards, effects on missions and possible solutions. Tenant units located on an airfield that is not hosted
     by the Air Force, Air Force Reserve, or Air National Guard will establish a BASH program with the
     host activity (civilian airport, Naval Air Station, Federal airfield, etc.). The BASH program will doc-
     ument coordination with the host activity on reducing wildlife hazards.
        7.11.2.1. The host flight safety office will establish the BASH plan, to include, defining the nature
        and extent of wildlife hazards and implementation of the plan. Plan implementation may require
        environmental controls and changes to bird dispersal techniques and operational procedures.
        Cooperative agreements for managing fish and wildlife resources require coordination with state
        and Federal conservation agencies prior to implementation.
        7.11.2.2. BASH programs at overseas locations depend on host nation support and regulations.
        MAJCOMs will evaluate those plans to ensure the spirit of AFI 91-202 is complied with to the
        maximum extent possible.
        7.11.2.3. Grass Height. Mow airfield to maintain a uniform grass height between 7 and 14 inches.
        Each installation BHWG will establish airfield mowing zone boundaries. Installations located in
        arid climates where growing grass is difficult may develop natural vegetation on the airfield to
        limit attractiveness to wildlife. These situations require comprehensive vegetation/wildlife hazard
        management and will be reviewed individually by AFSC/SEFW for approval. MAJCOM safety
        offices may request a waiver to grass height restrictions from AFSC/SEFW.
        7.11.2.4. Obtain additional information on wildlife strike hazard reduction from AFPAM 91-212,
        BASH Management Techniques and on wildlife strike reporting from AFI 91-204, Safety Investi-
        gations and Reports.
     7.11.3. Technical Assistance. Technical assistance is available through the USAF BASH Team, HQ
     AFSC/SEFW, 9700 G Avenue SE, Suite 266, Kirtland AFB, NM 87117-5670. DSN 246-5674/5679/
     5681/0698 or Comm (505) 846-xxxx, fax x0684.

command levels. Ground safety mishap prevention efforts include both on- and off-duty activities.
   8.1.1. Each installation ground safety manager oversees and implements a total base safety program.
   8.1.2. Wing subordinate units and tenant organizations implement a program that supports the instal-
   lation program.
   8.1.3. Host safety offices may not impose host command-unique requirements on tenant units unless
   specified in the host-tenant agreement. Tenant units without full-time qualified safety authorizations
   and with fewer than 400 people receive the same safety services as wing subordinate units. For tenant
   units greater than 400 people that don't have their own full-time safety personnel specify safety sup-
   port through the host-tenant agreement.
   8.1.4. Ground safety managers will use AFPD 91-series, other AFI 91-series and applicable federal,
   state, and AF guidance to establish the installation ground safety program.

8.2. Host Ground Safety Staff Responsibilities:
   8.2.1. Ensure mishaps are investigated and reported in accordance with AFI 91-204.
   8.2.2. Manage the US Air Force base ground safety program, including operational and occupational
   safety, industrial safety, contractual safety requirements, sports and recreation safety, and traffic
   safety.
       8.2.2.1. Operational safety includes performing and/or assisting in operational risk assessments of
       wing mission, contingency exercises, and deployment operations.
       8.2.2.2. Occupational safety includes assisting supervisors perform JSAs and OHAs; report orga-
       nizational compliance with OSHA, DoD, and AF safety requirements.
       8.2.2.3. Traffic safety includes both government and privately motor vehicles. As safe vehicle
       operation is a basic responsibility of the vehicle operator, installation safety staff will be respon-
       sible to ensure operators are properly educated. Safety personnel will work with installation secu-
       rity police, civil engineers, and transportation personnel to provide a well-rounded education
       program. Safety personnel will also be responsible to ensure the requirements of DoDI 6055.4 are
       being met.

                                            SYSTEM SAFETY

9.1. System Safety Principles. System safety disciplines apply engineering and management principles,
criteria, and techniques throughout the life cycle of a system within the constraints of operational effec-
tiveness, schedule, and costs. The degree of safety achieved in a system is directly dependent upon gov-
ernment and contractor management emphasis.
     9.1.1. System safety is an inherent element of system design and is essential to supporting system
     requirements. Successful system safety efforts depend on clearly defined safety objectives and sys-
     tem requirements.
     9.1.2. System safety must be a planned, integrated, comprehensive effort employing both engineering
     and management resources.
     9.1.3. Follow this order of precedence to satisfy system safety requirements and resolve identified
     hazards according to Military Standard (MIL-STD)-882, System Safety Requirements:
        9.1.3.1. Design for minimum risk.
        9.1.3.2. Incorporate safety devices.
        9.1.3.3. Provide warning devices.
        9.1.3.4. Develop procedures and training.
NOTE: The degree of safety achieved in a system id directly dependent upon government and contractor
management emphasis

9.2. System Safety Program Requirements:
     9.2.1. System safety engineering is an element of the systems engineering function and a part of the
     mishap prevention program. System safety programs must meet the requirements of the latest revi-
     sion of MIL-STD-882 or Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) Data Pacs. MIL-STD-882 has been
     deemed acquisition reform compliant by the Defense Standardization Improvement Council and shall
     be used on all applicable programs.
     9.2.1. (AFMC) System Program Managers (SPMs), regardless of the Acquisition Category (ACAT)
     of their programs, shall integrate system safety risk management into their overall systems engineer-
     ing and risk management processes. System safety programs shall meet the requirements of
     MIL-STD-882D. Acquisition program offices will use their system safety efforts to comply with the
     USAF ORM program (AFI 90-901). System Safety assessments will be performed for commercial
     off-the-shelf and non-developmental equipment to be used in new, safety critical applications.
     9.2.1. (HILL) System Safety efforts are applicable to Maintenance Engineering and Sustainment
     functions and shall be applied thereto.
     9.2.2. Program managers must ensure that system safety engineering is an integral part of the systems
     engineering process and receives proper management attention. Program managers must provide
     direct lines of communication to the system safety staff to receive timely information on identified
     hazards that have high mishap potential.
AFI91-202_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 3 JUNE 2008                                                             59


  9.2.2. (AFMC) AF program offices will have a trained System Safety Manager (SSM) to implement
  this program. In addition, system safety is an essential element of operational safety, suitability, and
  effectiveness (OSS&E) policy (AFI 63-1201).
  9.2.3. Management must ensure that safety offices monitor program requirements to identify and cor-
  rect hazards throughout the operational life of a system or facility to ensure hazards are identified
  through operational experience, mission changes, environmental effects, or system modification.
  Management must also ensure that safety staffs identify and control all hazards associated with
  decommissioning or disposal of a system.
  9.2.3. (AFMC) Program management will ensure that system safety offices monitor program
  requirements to identify and correct hazards throughout the life cycle of a system or facility including
  operational experience, mission changes, environmental effects, or system modification. Program
  management will also ensure that system safety staffs in conjunction with technical staffs identify and
  control all hazards associated with decommissioning or disposal of a system. System safety staff shall
  provide support to the weapon system Chief Engineer in the identification of Critical Safety Items.
  9.2.3. (HILL) For aviation related items, System Program Managers (SPM) shall develop a process
  for managing Critical Safety Items (CSI) IAW AFI 20-106, Management of Aviation Critical Safety
  Items. Managing CSIs shall include, but is not limited to, ensuring the Federal Logistics Information
  System (FLIS) is current, identification of new CSIs, and ensuring CSI technical data is appropriately
  marked.
     9.2.3.1. (Added-AFMC) System Program Managers (SPMs) will ensure that as a minimum at
     least one system-level hazard analysis or safety assessment report (MIL-STD-882) is accom-
     plished for all programs and projects, including temporary and permanent modifications, with an
     unknown effect on system safety. Facilities and industrial processes which incorporate new tech-
     nology or areas not covered by existing codes and standards will have tailored system safety pro-
     grams applied.
  9.2.4. Program safety offices must clearly define and document risk acceptance authority during
  life-cycle system decisions. “Unacceptable” residual hazards (as defined by MIL-STD-882C, appen-
  dix A, figure 2) can only be accepted by the Air Force Acquisition Executive (AFAE). “Undesirable”
  residual hazards (same reference) can only be accepted by the program executive officer (PEO), des-
  ignated acquisition commander (DAC), or equivalent. In the case of a PEO program having an
  imbedded DAC sub-program (i.e., aircraft engine) which involves an unacceptable risk at the system
  (e.g., aircraft) level, the DAC will coordinate on the document and forward it to the PEO for approval,
  or for coordination and submittal to the AFAE, as applicable. For each unresolved "unacceptable" or
  "undesirable" hazard, the PM will prepare a written residual risk assessment or acceptance document
  describing the residual hazard and assessing its overall risk. This document will be coordinated
  through the center or laboratory safety office and the MAJCOM Safety Directorate. The AFAE, PEO,
  or DAC will show his/her acceptance of the residual hazard by counter-signing the prepared docu-
  ment.
  9.2.4. (AFMC) Program safety offices shall clearly define and document mishap risk acceptance
  authority during life-cycle system decisions. Mishap risk shall be the risk that the operational crews
  are exposed to during the operational mission to include ground, air, and space operations. Mishap
  risk probabilities shall be expressed in terms of individual weapon system exposure over the complete
  or remaining projected life-time of the weapon system. Mishap risk severities shall be expressed in
60                                           AFI91-202_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 3 JUNE 2008


     worst case scenarios. “High” interim and residual mishap risks (as defined by DODI 5000.2 and
     MIL-STD-882D) can only be accepted by the Air Force Acquisition Executive (AFAE). “Serious”
     interim and residual mishap risks (same references) can only be accepted by the program executive
     officer (PEO) or equivalent. All high and serious interim mishap risks shall be accepted by the AFAE
     or PEO or equivalent within six months of identification. All other interim and residual mishap risks
     can be accepted by the SPM. If no unresolved hazards are found, a document will be transmitted to the
     same distribution prior to appropriate program milestones notifying upper management and staff that
     the mishap risk acceptance process has been (or is being) performed and is complete.
     9.2.4. (HILL) Coordinate “high” risks with the responsible commander and AFMC System Safety
     SES prior to seeking acceptance from the Air Force Acquisition Executive (AFAE). “Serious” interim
     and residual risk acceptance, or mitigation plans, shall be approved by the responsible commander;
     Ogden Air Logistics Center Command (OO-ALC/CC) for ALC (assigned weapon systems and com-
     modities) risks, and 75th Air Base Wing Commander (75 ABW/CC) for base risks. Military Standard
     (MIL-STD)-882D, Standard Practice for System Safety, Table A-III, shall be the standard format for
     presenting risk assessments to leadership at OO-ALC. The final format may be modified after the fact,
     to use a different MIL-STD-882 revision as dictated by the customer, as long as the risk hazard level
     and content are not changed.
        9.2.4.1. (Added-AFMC) For each “high" or "serious" interim and residual mishap risk, the SPM
        will prepare a written or electronic mishap risk assessment or acceptance document describing the
        mishap risk. The mishap risk assessment or acceptance document should include a staff summary
        sheet (e.g., AF Form 1768), tabbed with a Safety Analysis, Risk/Issue Worksheet, and other
        explanatory information (Flight Manual Safety and Operational Supplements, waivers/deviations,
        pictures, Time Compliance Technical Orders, or briefings).
        9.2.4.2. (Added-AFMC) Preparation of a written or electronic risk assessment/acceptance docu-
        ment will be accomplished with all using MAJCOM participation, and will be coordinated with
        the lead MAJCOM prior to routing the documentation to the AFAE, or PEO, or equivalent with
        info copy to AFSC/SEF/SEP. PEO documentation will have MAJCOM/DR/XR/SE coordination
        and AFAE documentation will have MAJCOM/CV coordination.
            9.2.4.2.1. (Added-AFMC) Program offices will coordinate mishap risk acceptance packages
            within the program office to include Chief Engineer/Director of Engineering, appropriate divi-
            sion chiefs, the test community, the System Program Manager, and, if applicable, the ALC
            vice commander.
            9.2.4.2.1. (HILL) Program offices will coordinate interim and residual “high” and “serious”
            mishap risk acceptance/mitigation packages within the program office to include the chief/
            lead engineer, appropriate group commanders, and the program manager; the Wing com-
            mander/director, the Director of Engineering (DOE), the Ogden Air Logistics Center Engi-
            neering Office (OO-ALC/EN) and the Safety Office (75 ABW/SE) shall also coordinate on
            these packages for sustainment activities. When coordination on the acceptance/mitigation
            package external to the program office is required, it shall be completed within 10 working
            days of receiving the necessary documentation. In the event risk mitigation involves an imme-
            diate or urgent action Time Compliance Technical Orders (TCTO), external (EN/SE/Wing CC/
            Civilian Lead (CL)) organizations can be notified via e-mail of the problem, in lieu of formal
            coordination.

         Wing Program Reviews.
         9.2.4.2.3. (Added-AFMC) In the case of a PEO program having an imbedded sub-program
         (e.g., aircraft engine) which involves a high or serious mishap risk at the system (e.g., aircraft)
         level, the sub-program center commander will coordinate on the document and forward it to
         the PEO for approval, or for coordination and submittal to the AFAE, as applicable.
         9.2.4.2.3. (HILL) In the case of a Program Executive Officer (PEO) or sustainment program
         having an embedded sub-program (e.g. aircraft engine, landing gear, power systems, etc)
         which involves a high or serious mishap risk at the system (e.g. aircraft) level, the sub-pro-
         gram center commander and the EN director will coordinate on the document and forward it to
         the PEO, or equivalent, for approval; or for coordination and submittal to the AFAE, as appli-
         cable. Sub-programs shall coordinate high and serious risks with the system manager prior to
         center commander and EN director coordination. In the event risk evaluation requires an
         immediate or urgent engineering assessment, external (EN/SE/Wing CC/CL) organizations
         can be notified via e-mail of the problem, in lieu of formal coordination.

   ation, test organizations will review and validate program office risk assessments for hazards that
   were not eliminated through redesign. The test organizations and AFOTEC will provide the using
   commands with their recommendations on program office risk assessments. The test organizations
   and AFOTEC will provide to the program office a summary of the test hazards and the mitigating
   actions for all test hazards. The test organizations and AFOTEC will participate in aircraft SSGs/
   SSWGs depending on schedule and availability as this will provide feedback as to the system hazards
   associated with test and test hazards which may have system implications.

programs and for all aircraft unless waived by the MAJCOM. SSGs will consist of the program man-
ager, MAJCOM system safety manager, center system safety manager, program system safety manager,
and representatives from the using command, HQ AFSC, AFMC, Air Force Operational Test and Evalu-
ation Center, and other appropriate DoD and industry organizations.
9.4. (AFMC) System Safety Groups (SSGs). SSGs will be established for all Acquisition Category I
(ACAT I) programs and for all aircraft programs (regardless of the acquisition category) unless waived by
the HQ AFMC/SE SSM. (An SSG for an ACAT I program may continue if the program has been changed
to a non-ACAT I status.) The CSSM, program SSM, materiel safety program manager, center FSO, HQ
AFSC, and HQ AFMC/SE SSM will be members or advisors to the SSGs. Status and progress of all

     SSG may request that the program manager call a meeting. Each SSG will address the following:
     9.4.2. (AFMC) Prior to each SSG meeting, the SPM will poll SSG members for agenda items. If no
     agenda items are received and there are no new action items, the SPM can cancel the meeting and
     notify SSG Members of the cancellation a minimum 14 days prior to any scheduled SSG. The cancel-
     lation notice will provide the status of any open SSG action items. Cancellation of the SSG by the
     SPM for two years in a row will require an explanation to AFMC/SES. The SSG can be held along
     with other programmatic events as long as sufficient time is allotted during the SSG to cover all of the
     relevant topics.
        9.4.2.1. Program status.
        9.4.2.2. AFSC fleet safety assessment.

     9.4.3. The SSG develops and coordinates the SSG charter and oversees the system safety program
     throughout the life of the system. The SSG charter will address the purpose and scope of the SSG,
     SSG membership (to include program, center, HQ AFMC, HQ AFSC, and using command safety per-
     sonnel), operating procedures, and administration of the group. These are mandatory aspects of the
     SSGs:
     9.4.3. (AFMC) The SSG charter will address the purpose and scope of the SSG, SSG membership (to
     include, as appropriate, program, center, HQ AFMC or HQ AFSC, and using command safety person-
     nel), operating procedures, and administration of the group.
        9.4.3.1. Validating the scope of the system safety program, including contractual requirements

   9.4.5. The program manager will be responsible for preparing minutes of SSG meetings and distrib-
   uting them to SSG members and attendees 30 days after the meeting. SSG minutes shall be sent to
   HQ AFSC and the owning command. If a SSG is not held on a major program within a year of the
   previous meeting from the last one an explanatory letter shall be sent toHQ AF/SESC.
   9.4.5. (AFMC) The SPM will ensure SSG minutes are prepared and distributed to HQ AFMC/SES,
   SSG members and attendees 30 days after the meeting. If no SSG agenda items are received for a
   SSG, the SPM has the authority to cancel the SSG for one year without sending an explanatory letter
   to HQ AF/SESC.

9.5. Non-developmental Items. These items, formerly known as commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS)
acquisitions, require system safety programs to review usage history, verify intended use similarities,
evaluate differences, and plan for adequate safety evaluation for all Air Force-unique modifications or
changes in use. For example, Federal Aviation Regulation (FAR) certification requirements are incre-
mentally implemented and may not apply to all models or year groups of similar aircraft. Operations
from military fields and or with military support equipment provide unique hazard opportunities that may
not have been considered in the original design. Exercise care in accepting FAA certification as a suffi-
cient indication for safety of the design.
9.5. (AFMC) Non-Developmental Items. If no usage history is available for the non-developmental
item, a tailored system safety effort will concentrate on hazard analyses of the existing design operating in
the planned use environment. If usage history is available and the usage is equivalent, and no modifica-
tions are desired, the system safety program should focus on mishap-identified deficiencies, operating and
maintenance manuals, and any proposed interface with other Air Force systems. If usage history is avail-
able and not equivalent, a tailored system safety program is required for all areas not complying with stan-
dards normally accepted by DoD organizations. In any case, system safety analyses are required for all
Air Force unique modifications to the existing design. Engineering/design projects for Air Force indus-
trial systems, support equipment, and process changes will use the AFMC Form 299, Safety, Fire, and
Health Review or locally-developed equivalent, to document the necessary reviews. The organization ini-
tiating the project shall prepare the form and coordinate with the center system safety office.

9.6. Risk Assessment and Management. Accomplish an appropriate assessment/analysis of the safety
and operational risks associated with all modification proposals and acquisition and development efforts.
Program safety offices must ensure all necessary engineering and design data is produced and maintained
70                                             AFI91-202_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 3 JUNE 2008


to adequately document the risk decisions made, the design changes incorporated to reduce or eliminate
hazards and any residual risks and hazards left in the system. Residual hazards and risk accepted and
signed off by the appropriate authorities should be thoroughly documented and periodically reviewed by
using and developing commands. This ensures that risk assessments are still appropriate and for available
possible correction as part of a later modification or redesign.
9.6. (AFMC) Risk Assessment and Management. Risk assessments will also be accomplished for
major design decisions, including modifications, having significant system safety effects. Risk assess-
ments will address the 15 questions listed in para 18.3 of the Air Force System Safety Handbook (listed
below). In any case, risk assessments will be coordinated with the CSSM and will be briefed to SSGs.
When necessary, these risk assessments will be used to document residual hazards to be reported to the
AFAE, PEO, or equivalent with info copy to AFSC/SEF/SEP. Residual hazards and mishap risk accepted
and signed off by the appropriate authorities should be thoroughly documented and periodically reviewed
by using and developing commands.
     9.6.1. Express risk as:
        9.6.1.1. Loss over a period of time.
        9.6.1.2. Loss over a number of events.
        9.6.1.3. Losses for a given population.
     9.6.2. Assess risk by determining:
        9.6.2.1. Recurrent hazards.

        9.6.2.4. Exposure.
        9.6.2.5. Corrective actions that can eliminate mishaps or reduce risk.
(NOTE: See MIL-STD-882 for an explanation of the mishap-risk index method.)
     9.6.3. (Added-AFMC) Safety modification proposals will be justified by risk assessment documents.
     Risk assessment documents shall be coordinated with HQ AFMC/SES prior to safety modification
     approval per AFI 63-1101.
     9.6.4. (Added-AFMC) All modification risk assessment documentation shall, as a minimum, answer
     the following questions:
        9.6.4.1. (Added-AFMC) What were the preliminary mishap risk index results when the safety
        deficiency was initially identified?
        9.6.4.2. (Added-AFMC) What is (are) the identified deficiency (deficiencies) (design, mainte-
        nance, material, quality, software, etc?)
        9.6.4.3. (Added-AFMC) What are the hazards caused by the deficiencies in light of known
        requirements and interrelationships with man, machine, and environmental system elements?
        9.6.4.4. (Added-AFMC) What, if any, supporting historical data substantiate the need for the
        modification? (List Class A, B, C mishaps, HAPs, Cat I DRs, etc.)
AFI91-202_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 3 JUNE 2008                                                              71


       9.6.4.5. (Added-AFMC) What, if any, interim corrective action has already been taken to reduce
       risk? (Change in mission, operational restrictions, grounding, increased inspection, TCTO action,
       etc.)
       9.6.4.6. (Added-AFMC) What, if any, additional action has been recommended by the Materiel
       Safety Task Group, system safety group, system safety working group, or other group?
       9.6.4.7. (Added-AFMC) What are the expected future mishap rate(s) (A, B, C, etc.) to be caused
       by this deficiency if it is not corrected?
       9.6.4.8. (Added-AFMC) What is the affected fleet size, and its expected future life exposure?
       (List average number of operationally available aircraft per year, years of operational life remain-
       ing, average programmed flying hours per year.)
       9.6.4.9. (Added-AFMC) What are the expected total future direct losses (and indirect losses) if
       the modification is not approved? If sufficient data exists to make these predictions, what is the
       current mishap severity, probability and frequency, and resulting mishap risk index values?
       9.6.4.10. (Added-AFMC) How will the proposed modification eliminate or control these losses?
       9.6.4.11. (Added-AFMC) How effective will the control of losses be?
       9.6.4.12. (Added-AFMC) If the modification is approved, what are the expected losses to be
       avoided, and any other quantitative or qualitative benefits?
       9.6.4.13. (Added-AFMC) Does the proposed modification create any new hazard for the system?
       (Consider mission and people, machine, environmental system elements.)
       9.6.4.14. (Added-AFMC) Why are other alternatives to risk reduction unacceptable? (Accept
       losses, preferred parts substitution, time change, training, procedural changes, increased inspec-
       tion, etc.)
       9.6.4.15. (Added-AFMC) If the modification is approved, what will be done to reduce risk until
       the modification is fully implemented?
       9.6.4.16. (Added-AFMC) If the safety modification is not incorporated, the appropriate risk
       acceptance authority accepts the residual mishap risk. (However, if the decision is made to incor-
       porate the modification, but funds are not available, the risk acceptance authority now becomes
       the agency responsible for the appropriate funding.)

9.7. SSEA. The SSEA program evaluates and approves new operations previously prohibited due to the
perceived risks. (Examples include hot pit refueling, integrated combat turn around [ICT], and concurrent
servicing.)
9.7. (AFMC) SSEA. Each SSEA team will be formed by the SSEA Team Chief at HQ AFMC/SE. When
necessary, designated team members will vote on specific issues, with the team chief voting only to break
tie votes.
   9.7.1. SSEA of a proposed operation is performed by a highly qualified team under controlled condi-
   tions. The team conducts actual demonstrations and analysis of the operation to validate overall risk
   assessment and recommend actions. The SSEA team is normally chaired by the AFMC System

                                          WEAPONS SAFETY

10.1. Weapons Safety Program Management. The weapons safety program comprises three disci-
plines: explosives safety, missile safety, and nuclear surety.
10.1. (AFMC) Weapons Safety Program. Each center is responsible for developing and implementing
a weapons safety program to address immediate weapons safety functions on the day-to-day basis and
contingency operations. The weapons safety program includes explosives and missile safety, and nuclear
surety elements, and may include space and directed energy weapons, when applicable. Examples of
these functions are explosives site planning and licensing, explosives storage, operations, transportation
and handling, DULL SWORD and mishap reporting, investigations and trending, etc. Each center is also
responsible for weapons safety designed, manufactured, and maintained in weapons systems, support
equipment, launch/delivery vehicles, and related facilities which exists throughout life cycle of the entire
weapon system. Other examples of these functions are weapons systems safety groups, verifications of
weapons systems TOs, ensuring safety criteria are incorporated into weapon systems design and develop,
considering the safety impact of modifications to existing weapon systems, identifying acceptable quality
and reliability levels required to satisfy safety standards, etc.
   10.1.1. Units at and above squadron level with an explosives, missile, or nuclear mission must have a
   weapons safety program.
   10.1.1. (AFMC) All unit commanders, with a mission involving explosives/weapons, weapon sus-
   pension or support systems shall appoint an Additional Duty Weapons Safety Manager (ADWSM) to
   administer the program. The appointment will be documented and forwarded to the host Weapons
   Safety office to schedule USR training within 30 days of appointment.
   10.1.1. (HILL) Weapons Safety (75 ABW/SEW) implements the weapons safety program on behalf
   of OO-ALC/CC as the host weapon safety office. 75 ABW/SEW will provide annual assessments and
   periodic spot inspections for all units involved with explosives, including tenants.
   10.1.2. The host coordinates weapons safety for the entire base. Tenant units implement mission
   unique mishap prevention programs where the host does not have a mission in that area. Tenant units
   must coordinate any additional program functions with the host to avoid duplication.
   10.1.2. (AFMC) The center weapons safety office will be the "center of expertise" for weapons
   related issues and processes occurring throughout the base. The center safety office ensures Host/Ten-
   ant support agreements identify specific weapons situations outlining unique requirements outside of
   the host unit capabilities. HQ AFRL Safety office will be the “center of expertise” for weapons related
   issues and processes throughout its directorates and units. ASC Safety office (ASC/ENSA) will be the
   “center of expertise” for weapons related issues and processes at the system program management
   organizations and the Government Owned-Contractor Operated facilities (GOCOs).
       10.1.2.1. (Added-AFMC) The center weapons safety office shall coordinate on applicable AFTO
       Form 22, Technical Order Improvement Report and Reply, and applicable AF Form 332,
       Work Request for facility construction or modifications affecting weapons safety.
       10.1.2.2. (Added-HILL) Review and sign Block IV of AF Form 2047, Explosives Facility
       License, and coordinate on locally developed Explosive Operating Instruction (EOI), Test Plans

        (TP), and other weapons safety documentation which impact Hill AFB or Geographically Sepa-
        rated Unit (GSU) organizations.
        10.1.2.3. (Added-HILL) Maintain Explosive Site Plans and explosive authorizations. 75 ABW/
        SEW provides computer-generated printouts of explosive authorizations to Hill AFB and GSU
        organizations.
     10.1.3. (Added-HILL) OO-ALC Wings, Groups, or Units with Integrated Weapons System Manage-
     ment Programs are responsible for product safety for the weapons system. This includes safety
     groups, weapons systems Technical Orders (T.O.), and other operations that do not directly affect Hill
     AFB or GSU personnel, facilities, equipment, or missions. The weapons safety functions (operating
     instructions, lesson plans, TPs, etc.) that do affect Hill AFB and GSU systems do require coordination
     with the 75 ABW/SEW.

10.2. Weapons Safety Personnel Management: Weapons Safety personnel are normally from the
2WXXX or 2MXXX career fields. Civilian personnel with the appropriate occupational series (WG or
GS) experience in the safety career program will be used in all positions that do not have a military neces-
sity. It is the responsibility of the Chief of Safety to recruit, select, and man the Weapons Safety function
using Attachment 5 of this AFI.
10.2. (AFMC) Weapon Safety Personnel Management. The unit ADWSM should be highly qualified
and preferably a non-commissioned officer within an AFSC applicable to the explosives operations of the
unit or a civilian with equivalent experience.
     10.2.1. The MAJCOM Chief of Weapons Safety must have munitions or missile experience and have
     had a previous safety assignment.
     10.2.2. Upon completion of training and six months assignment in the Weapons Safety position, the
     Chief of Safety will ensure the individual in Weapons Safety is awarded the special experience identi-
     fier (SEI) 375 and a two-year assignment deferment is initiated through the Military Personnel Flight
     (MPF) if the individual is satisfactorily accomplishing Weapons Safety tasks.
     10.2.3. Individuals will be trained within 90 days of assuming the weapons safety position Initial
     training should be provided using the Introduction to Weapons Safety CD ROM provided by AFSC
     prior to attendance to the AETC Weapons Safety course.
     10.2.3. (AFMC) The center weapons safety office will ensure all required personnel receive initial
     weapons safety training within 30 days of appointment and recurring training within the 15-month
     training cycle, outlining applicable explosives, missile, and nuclear programs.

10.3. Explosives Safety Standards. Air Force explosives safety standards are in AFMAN 91-201,
Explosives Safety Standards. Criteria for specific explosives are specified in technical publications and
other standard publications, such as command and local directives.
10.3. (AFMC) Explosives Safety Standards. See AFMAN 91-201, AFMC Sup1 for additional MAJ-
COM unique explosives safety standards. Centers are authorized to supplement AF and MAJCOM guid-

      tation for personnel who handle, operate, transport, maintain, load, or dispose of ammunition and
      explosives will be provided initially and at 15-month minimum intervals thereafter. The training
      should be provided by the unit. ADWSM will be tailored to specific unit functions. Training doc-
      umentation will be maintained at the unit level.
      10.10.1.2. (Added-AFMC) Conventional weapons and nuclear surety lesson plans shall be
      developed by the centers safety office and reviewed annually. Lesson plans, tests, etc. may be
      reviewed for accuracy during annual or nuclear surety inspections, or assessments. Lesson plans
      may be locally developed to satisfy the needs of the subordinate units, however a documented ini-
      tial and annual review by the host weapons safety office will be accomplished.
   10.10.2. The base or unit weapons safety manager conducts this training, which augments the job
   training provided by the supervisor. The weapons safety staff evaluates and monitors unit weapons
   safety, approves lesson plans and reviews them annually. All personnel (supervisory and nonsupervi-
   sory) who operate, handle, transport, maintain, load, or dispose of missiles, explosives, or nuclear
   weapons must receive initial weapons safety training before performing any of those tasks. Conduct
   recurring training annually thereafter, not later than the end of the month in which the initial training
   was conducted. Tailor the weapons safety training given to an individual to the specific duties and
   weapons systems. EXCEPTION: People who store and/or handle only the following are exempt
   from initial and refresher training: (a) Small arms ammunition, including cartridge-actuated tools in
   quantity-distance class/division 1.4; (b) Other class/division 1.4 items in their packaged configuration
   only. Personnel who will unpack and handle unpacked items still require training; (c) Document
   destroyers; (d) Small tear gas items (such as grenades); (e) Aircraft and facility fire extinguisher car-
   tridges.

sonnel from each Service and Defense Contract Management Agency. The OSSG enhances the safety of
ordnance processes within the Services through the exchange of safety and accident information, develop-
ment of policies, and establishment of joint standards. It develops technical safety information and influ-
ences the safety guidance of DoD and other Federal Agencies, and private industry. HQ AFMC/SEW is
the primary member to the OSSG with technical support from HQ AFSC/SEW, AAC/SES, OO-ALC/
WMCS, AFOTEC/SEW,
10.15. (Added-AFMC) Product Safety. Weapons safety incorporates two basic responsibilities affect-
ing explosives, missile and nuclear surety elements. The first deals with the development and implemen-
tation of a program to address the safety concerns in the day-to-day operations known as base weapons
safety. The second is the product safety aspect that deals with the design, manufacturing, and maintenance
of weapons systems, support equipment, launch/delivery vehicles and related facilities throughout the
AFI91-202_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 3 JUNE 2008                                                              81

                                            SPACE SAFETY

11.1. Space Safety Program Management. All units conducting space-related missions must have a
comprehensive space safety program.
11.1. (AFMC) Space Safety Program Management. Space safety consists of launch safety and orbital
safety. All units with space mission that involves operations, handling, transporting, storage, etc., of
explosives, weapons (nuclear and nonnuclear), etc., will establish a credible weapons safety program.
   11.1.1. (Added-AFMC) Risk management will be accomplished for major design, development, and
   test decisions, including test vehicles, payloads, boosters, etc.
   11.1.2. (Added-AFMC) Centers will ensure space launch and orbital safety mishaps are properly
   investigated according to AFI 91-204. HQ AFRL is the primary source of AFMC space mishaps. The
   HQ AFRL Safety office is the focal point for all space mishaps occurring in its directorates/units. HQ
   AFRL Safety office will provide support to HQ AFMC/SEW for space mishap investigating and
   reporting responsibilities.

11.2. Space Safety Program. Space safety consists of two elements: launch safety and orbital safety.
All units must tailor their space safety program to meet their mission requirements. Space systems range
from unique space support equipment to large boosters and satellites. Launches, ground support and
operational equipment, personnel, and the operational environment are all sources of potential mishaps.
Safe operations within the space environment are only possible if positive mishap prevention programs
are established and faithfully followed.
11.2. (AFMC) Space Safety Program. Space safety consists of launch safety and orbital safety and will
be part of the weapons safety program. All units with space mission that involves operations, including
test launches, handling, transporting, storage, and operations in storage and processing facilities of explo-
sives, weapons (nuclear and nonnuclear), satellites, etc., will establish a credible weapons safety program.
   11.2.1. Launch Safety. Modern launch vehicles operated by the Air Force have huge explosive
   potential, are unpiloted, and significantly less reliable than aircraft. Launch operations require a com-
   prehensive safety program to ensure safe operations. The launch safety program covers activities
   associated with the ground handling, launching, and preorbital operations of space systems. It also
   includes activities connected with the deployment, operation, reentry, and recovery (if required) of
   test vehicles or payloads that don't attain orbit (either planned or unplanned). Failure to follow all
   range and ground safety requirements could cause a launch mishap. NOTE: Missile safety programs
   cover intercontinental ballistic missile test launches.
       11.2.1.1. Major Range Test Facility Base (MRTFB) Range Safety. Typically, launch operations
       will be conducted from an MRTFB range and will comply with DoDD 3200.11 MRTFB range
       safety requirements as described in section 2.10.
       11.2.1.2. Launch Collision Avoidance. Operators will take appropriate action to minimize the
       risk of collisions with other satellites or space debris during launch.
       11.2.1.3. Mission Flight Control. Space launch operators will have adequate measures in place to
       ensure complete control over launch vehicles at all times. The surrounding public will not be
       exposed to undue risk.
84                                              AFI91-202_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 3 JUNE 2008


     11.2.2. Orbital Safety. The extremely high cost of orbital assets and irrecoverable nature of orbital
     operations makes orbital mishap prevention a critical component of orbital systems. The orbital
     safety program covers activities, after orbital insertion, associated with testing and operating space
     vehicles in orbit or deep space, including reentry, recovery and disposal. Orbital safety begins in the
     earliest phases of a program when considerations of this section must be incorporated in the design
     phase. Safety of orbital system is the responsibility of the owner or operator. Orbital safety programs
     should cover, at a minimum, the following areas:
        11.2.2.1. Collision Avoidance. Operators will take appropriate action to minimize the risk of
        on-orbit collisions with other satellites or space debris. Collision avoidance should include main-
        taining separation of functional and non-functional space objects through coordinated launch win-
        dow management, accurate tracking and orbital element set updating; and coordination of planned
        orbit changes and evasive maneuvering to preserve operational space systems and to avoid the
        generation of additional space debris
        11.2.2.2. Directed Energy Clearing House. Programs or experiments using directed energy, either
        ground or space-based, shall take appropriate action to minimize hazards or interference with
        spacecraft or the general public and property on the earth’s surface or in the atmosphere.
        11.2.2.3. Orbital Debris Minimization. Orbital systems shall be designed to minimize the gener-
        ation of orbital debris during and after their service life.
            11.2.2.3.1. Booster disposal. Space vehicle boosters should be designed and planned to min-
            imize hazards to future vehicles and the ground when their mission is complete. At a mini-
            mum vehicles should reenter the atmosphere or be moved into a disposal orbit at the end of its
            useful life where they will be less likely to interfere with operational spacecraft.
            11.2.2.3.2. Orbital vehicle end-of-life safing. Vehicles should safely reenter the atmosphere or
            be moved into a disposal orbit at the end of its useful life where it will be less likely to interfere
            with operational spacecraft. End-of-life safing actions for systems disposed of in space
            include, but are not limited to: venting all pressure vessels, safing batteries, safing any remain-
            ing ordnance systems and turning off any transmitters.
        11.2.2.4. Space Environment. Orbital systems shall be designed to minimize damage due to nat-
        ural phenomena such as meteoroids, solar radiation, spacecraft charging and high energy cosmic
        radiation, solar flares, etc.

11.3. Space Safety Training. MAJCOMs must ensure that space safety offices provide adequate training
to all individuals involved in space operations. Tailor safety training to particular systems and the individ-
ual's specific duties. MAJCOMs must ensure that lesson plans are developed to implement intermediate
or MAJCOM guidance.
     11.3.1. Space Safety Managers (SSM), Orbital Safety Officers (OSO), and Space System Safety
     Engineer Training. Space safety personnel in these positions should have received the Introduction
     to Space Safety Course, and the Launch or Orbital Safety Management course appropriate to their unit
     mission and be experienced in the unit mission. Training should also include system safety analysis
     or system safety management courses, as well as orientation to the applicable areas of space safety
     covered under paragraph 11.2. above. Additional mission-specific training should be specified by the
     MAJCOM or unit.
AFI91-202_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 3 JUNE 2008                                                              85


   11.3.2. Launch Safety Training. Launch safety training augments the job training provided by the
   supervisor. Unit commanders ensure this training is developed and conducted in addition to job train-
   ing. The unit safety staff evaluates and monitors unit launch safety, approves lesson plans and reviews
   them annually. All personnel (supervisory and nonsupervisory) who operate, handle, transport, main-
   tain, or monitor space launch systems must receive initial launch safety training before performing
   any of those tasks. Conduct recurring training annually thereafter, not later than the end of the month
   in which the initial training was conducted. Tailor the launch safety training given to an individual to
   the specific duties and launch systems. MAJCOMs ensure that bases or units develop standardized
   local lesson plans if intermediate or MAJCOM standardized plans are not provided. Launch safety
   training may be given by USRs or qualified unit personnel.
   11.3.3. Orbital Safety Training. Orbital safety training augments the job training provided by the
   supervisor. Unit commanders ensure this training is developed and conducted in addition to job train-
   ing. The unit safety staff evaluates and monitors unit orbital safety, approves lesson plans and reviews
   them annually. All personnel (supervisory and nonsupervisory) who operate maintain, or monitor
   orbital systems must receive initial orbital safety training before performing any of those tasks. Con-
   duct recurring training annually thereafter, not later than the end of the month in which the initial
   training was conducted. Tailor the orbital safety training given to an individual to the specific duties
   and orbital systems. MAJCOMs ensure that bases or units develop standardized local lesson plans if
   intermediate or MAJCOM standardized plans are not provided. Orbital safety training may be given
   by USRs or qualified unit personnel.

11.4. Space Safety Council. This council, chaired by AFSC, is composed of the chiefs of space safety, or
their representatives, from each MAJCOM. The council discusses matters of mutual concern that cross
MAJCOM lines. The council must hold periodic meetings, generally following other meetings in which
most representatives are already present.
11.4. (AFMC) Space Safety Council. The Space Safety Council is chaired by HQ AFSC/SEW. HQ
AFMC/SEW and HQ AFRL Safety office will provide support as needed, through membership, to the
Space Safety Council to ensure space issues and concerns are addressed and resolved.

11.5. Space Nuclear Surety. The space nuclear surety program ensures that radioactive sources and
nuclear power systems used in space are designed, developed, built, maintained, stored, handled,
launched, and used (including final disposition) with the maximum safety and security consistent with
operational requirements. AFI 91-110 for nuclear safety review and launch approval requirements and
procedures for the use of nuclear powered system and radioactive sources in space.
11.5. (AFMC) Space Nuclear Surety. Centers with space nuclear surety programs and use radioactive
materials will submit safety analysis summaries through HQ AFMC/SEW to HQ AFSC/SEW. Copies of
forecasts and reports of all launches with radioactive materials will be provided to HQ AFMC/SEW.
   11.5.1. (Added-AFMC) Review all Air Force Accident/Incident/Deficiency Reports for AFMC
   involvement and monitor actions and replies to correct deficiencies.

11.6. Forms Prescribed. AF Form 3, Hazard Abatement Plan; AF Form 457, USAF Hazard Report;
and AF Form 651, Hazardous Air Traffic Report (HATR).

                                      Chapter 12 (Added-AFMC)

                                  CONTRACT SAFETY PROGRAM

12.1. (Added-AFMC) Contract Safety Program. Center/Base safety staffs will establish procedures
with installation contracting activity and base organizations that submit contract packages to ensure SE
reviews purchase requests (PRs), statement of works (SOWs), statement of objectives (SOOs), statement
of needs, performance work statements, and related contract specifications, based on local needs, require-
ments of this paragraph and program managers to ensure inclusion of safety requirements, clauses and
appendices in contracts. The center safety staff will establish procedures to ensure review of any SOO/
SOW/MNS, PR or other specifications:
 - That will eventually result in a contract containing the ground/flight risk clause.
 - That will eventually result in a contract containing property protection clauses.
 - That will expose Air Force personnel to the hazards of the work to be performed.
 - That involves either government or contract flight operations.
 - As recommended by the Center SE or when requested by the program manager because of mission crit-
icality of the product or service to be contracted.
 - For the purchase of any equipment, vehicles or tools from a locally-prepared specification. Also see
AFI 91-301/AFMC Supplement 1 for more information of first article demonstrations.
 - For the purchase of off-the-shelf equipment, vehicle, tools, etc., to be used in a manner not covered by
the manufacturer’s instructions or to be used in performance of potentially hazardous work such as work
in confined spaces, degreasing, fuels servicing, etc.
 - That will eventually result in a new/modified facility.
 - For purchase/procurement of specialized occupational training that exposes AF personnel to chemical,
environmental, mechanical, physical or other hazards.
  - The installation contracting activity will ensure that the center/base safety staffs have reviewed and
safety requirements are included on PRs, SOWs, statement of need, performance work statements, and
related contract specifications.
   12.1.1. (Added-AFMC) Reviews will be accomplished prior to submission to the installation con-
   tracting activity. The installation contracting activity will ensure safety office review prior to accep-
   tance.
   12.1.2. (Added-AFMC) Commodity contracts without product safety concerns may be exempted
   from review. Additionally, contracts below $100,000 may also be exempt from appendix C require-
   ments. However, a mishap reporting clause as specified in 12.2.4. (Added) below will be included if
   Air Force property is included in the contract.
12.2. (Added-AFMC) Contract Safety Specifications. The center/base safety staff will consolidate all
safety inputs and provide coordinated safety specifications back to the program manager. Product safety
specifications may be incorporated in the manner that best fits the center contracting process. Tailored
contract safety sections will be used for all depot level workload. All safety specifications and/or require-
ments will be intended only for the protection of Air Force people, assets, and interests. The safety speci-
88                                              AFI91-202_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 3 JUNE 2008


fication and/or requirements will require the contractor(s) to provide a safety plan. The requirement for
the contractor to provide a safety plan will go in Section L of the RFP and the grading criteria for the
safety plan will go in Section M of the RFP. The winning contractor’s safety plan will be placed on con-
tract not the safety specifications/requirements.
     12.2.1. (Added-AFMC) Safety specifications will include product or system specific safety require-
     ments tailored to the SOW/SOO, PR, etc. Safety specifications may reference, but should not restate,
     Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) or other regulatory requirements.
     12.2.2. (Added-AFMC) Operations not covered by regulatory requirements, e.g., OSHA, should be
     detailed in the contract safety specification or section. Examples include (but are not limited to)
     engine runs, aircraft towing, fuel servicing and ground handling, parking and mooring, hangering of
     fueled aircraft, foreign object damage prevention, aircraft jacking, fuel cell/tank repair, and operations
     where OSHA has no jurisdiction (foreign locations).
     12.2.3. (Added-AFMC) If an AFOSH standard or Air Force TO adequately defines safety require-
     ments, the standard may be incorporated by reference, (e.g., "All aircraft fuel cell/tank repair will be
     performed and supervised according to TO 1-1-3 by personnel meeting the training and qualification
     requirements listed in TO 1-1-3.")
     12.2.4. (Added-AFMC) The safety specification shall require mishap notification to the contracting
     safety office as well as the contracting officer for all incidents resulting in damage to Air Force prop-
     erty. It shall include specific notification instructions and timelines, and require the contractor to coop-
     erate with any and all government investigations. Additionally, it shall require the contractor to secure
     the mishap scene and impound evidence/wreckage until released by the government contracting
     officer. The safety specification shall include contractor mishap reporting, with copies of contractor
     data related to the mishap, such as contractor analyses, test reports, summaries of investigations, etc.
     as necessary to support the government investigation. An appropriate contract data requirements list/
     data item description reference for mishap reports shall be included specifying a copy of each mishap
     report be sent directly to the safety office preparing the specification.
     12.2.5. (Added-AFMC) If the contract will require contractor flight operations, the contract will be
     reviewed by flight safety. The contract will direct compliance with AFI 10-220. Optimally, this will be
     a SOW/SOO line item; however, inclusion in a safety specification is acceptable. For contracts
     involving government or contractor flight operations, compliance with AFI 32-1076, Design Stan-
     dards for Visual Navigation Systems, UFC (Unified Facility Criteria) 3-260-01, Airfield and Heliport
     Planning and Design, AFI 32-1042, Standards for Marking Airfields, AFI 32-1044, Visual Air Navi-
     gation Systems and AFI 32-1076, Design Standards for Visual Navigational Systems, and FAA Part 77
     - Objects Affecting Navigable Airspace are included in the safety specification.
     12.2.6. (Added-AFMC) When ammunition or explosives are involved, the contract will be reviewed
     by weapons safety. The safety specification will require the contractor to comply with DoD
     4145.26-M, DoD Contractors' Safety Manual for Ammunition and Explosives, and/or AFMAN
     91-201, Explosives Safety Standards. (NOTE: Some contracts will automatically require compliance
     through reference to Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement, Part 252.223-7002, Safety
     Precautions for Ammunition and Explosives. If so, no other specifications are required.) If the scope
     of work includes air shipment of explosives, the safety specification should require contractor compli-
     ance with AFMAN 24-204(I), Preparing Hazardous Materials for Military Air Shipments.
AFI91-202_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 3 JUNE 2008                                                                   89


   12.2.7. (Added-AFMC) The contract will contain a clause requiring the contractor to require that all
   subcontractors comply with the safety requirements/specifications in the contract.
   12.2.8. (Added-AFMC) The center contracting agency will coordinate any changes to the contract
   safety specifications with the safety office preparing the specification.
12.3. (Added-AFMC) Pre and Post Award Surveys and other Site Visits. Center/Base SE will participate
in pre and post award surveys, as needed, to ensure compliance with safety specification requirements.
Safety Offices will program funds for mishap investigations at contractor facilities and for annual surveys
of contractor safety programs and facilities, to include GOCOs, for all disciplines that are covered in the
contract safety specifications. When feasible, conduct these surveys in conjunction with annual safety
surveys. All visits will be coordinated with appropriate program management personnel and contract
administration functions. Survey and other site visits, for which safety incurs TDY costs, will be paid for
on a fee-for-service basis by the program manager or contracting office.
12.4. (Added-AFMC) Source Selection. The installation contracting activity and Program Managers
will ensure that SE offices participate in source selections as best fits the need of the center. A safety func-
tional representative form the Center/Base Safety office will participate in the source selection for any
contract containing extensive safety specifications, including acquisitions and depot contracts. Full-time
assignment to a source selection board will be at the discretion of the center/base SE, however part-time
participation is encouraged when sufficient to protect safety related Air Force interests.
12.5. (Added-AFMC) Base Service, Construction, and Maintenance Contracts. Center/Base SEs
will establish a review, coordination, and surveillance process for the above base level contracts as best
protects the safety interests of the installation. As a minimum, SE will establish a process that:
  - Ensures the protection of Air Force personnel collocated or exposed to the hazards of the contract
effort.
 - Ensures protection of Air Force property and interest.
 - Advises contractors of any Air Force generated hazards associated with the work. This includes but is
not limited to notifying contractors of Air Force identified permit required confined spaces and associated
hazards and complying with the notification requirements of 29 CFR 1910.1200.
  - Ensures the base contracting officer is advised of hazards observed on contractor sites or during con-
tractor operations.
 - Ensures attendance at meetings or briefings necessary to accomplish the above tasks.
 - Attends construction design reviews to ensure safety related codes, regulations/instructions, and stan-
dards are being met.
   12.5.1. (Added-AFMC) See AFI 91-301/AFMC Supplement 1 for more information on plans, engi-
   neering design, and construction review.
   12.5.2. (Added-AFMC) The center contracting agency will ensure the center/base SE will have a
   member at OMB Circular A-76 Steering Groups. Additionally, Center/Base SE will provide safety
   specification for the SOO/SOW/MNS, PR for the area under A-76 and will participate on the techni-
   cal review of the bidder’s proposals.
12.6. (Added-AFMC) Mishap Reporting and Investigation. For all contracts that fall under the cate-
gories listed in para 12.1. (Added), AFMC units that initiated the contracts will report the mishaps to the

center safety office. The convening authority will be AFMC/CC unless delegated. For mishaps that do not
fall into one of those categories or contracts with contractor indemnification, then special mishap report-
ing requirements will be placed in the contract prior to award. All reportable contractor mishaps involving
Air Force property or personnel will be investigated by the contracting safety office unless AFI 91-204
(due to mishap category) dictates otherwise.
12.7. (Added-AFMC) Policy. It is the policy of the Air Force and AFMC to avoid all appearances of
supervising contractor work activities. AFMC Safety and Health personnel should refer to AFI 91-301 for
guidance regarding day to day interaction with contractor personnel.
     12.7.1. (Added-AFMC) Imminent danger situations will be remedied immediately in all cases.
     12.7.2. (Added-AFMC) Deviations from 12.6. (Added) above are allowed when accomplished as
     part of a deliberative decision making process as described in DoDI 6055.1, enclosure 5.

                                TEST SAFETY REVIEW PROCESS

13.1. (Added-AFMC) Applicability, Purpose, and Waivers:
   13.1.1. (Added-AFMC) Applicability. This process applies to all AFMC organizations that plan,
   support, and conduct ground, weapons, flight, or space test and evaluation including research and
   development (R&D) laboratories. All test programs will have a final test safety review.
   13.1.2. (Added-AFMC) Purpose. This process is an integral part of test and evaluation which pro-
   tects personnel and resources by identifying test unique hazards and recommending risk reduction
   measures. The goal is to conduct an independent safety review of the proposed test.
   13.1.3. (Added-AFMC) Waivers. Submit requests for waivers to HQ AFMC/SE & DO.
13.2. (Added-AFMC) Policy:
   13.2.1. (Added-AFMC) The test safety process applies to all AFMC organizations that conduct test
   programs. All test programs will have a final test safety review. The intent of the review is to mini-
   mize risks to an acceptable level and then identify the residual mishap risk. The appropriate authority
   can then make an informed decision whether to approve or disapprove the test based on the amount of
   residual mishap risk.
   13.2.2. (Added-AFMC) Safety planning is accomplished concurrently with test planning. Final
   safety review occurs after the test plan receives technical approval. The final review provides an
   objective, independent evaluation of the risks and associated controls of the test hazards. Tests
   planned and reviewed by other organizations may be accepted by the AFMC test approval authority
   (para 13.9. (Added)). This acceptance is based in part on the participation of AFMC personnel in that
   review process. All test and evaluation will be conducted according to approved test and safety plan-
   ning.
   13.2.3. (Added-AFMC) Testing organizations including R&D laboratories develop local procedures
   tailored to fit the command and organization structure of their organization to implement this process.
   Local procedures may be in the form of a supplement or a separate publication. Locally-produced
   forms may also be used to implement this process. The procedures are approved by the test organiza-
   tion commander or director and forwarded to HQ AFMC/SE for review.
13.3. (Added-AFMC) Responsibility:
   13.3.1. (Added-AFMC) HQ AFMC/SE will:
      13.3.1.1. (Added-AFMC) Establish test safety review policy.
      13.3.1.2. (Added-AFMC) Review local publications or supplements.
      13.3.1.3. (Added-AFMC) The SSEA Team (paragraph 9.7.) acts as the SRB for those items they
      are reviewing.
   13.3.2. (Added-AFMC) HQ AFMC/DO will:
      13.3.2.1. (Added-AFMC) Ensure that this test safety review process is made an integral part of
      all test and evaluation activities.
92                                           AFI91-202_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 3 JUNE 2008


        13.3.2.2. (Added-AFMC) Ensure that this process is included or referenced in other test publica-
        tions, as applicable.
     13.3.3. (Added-AFMC) Test requesting organization will provide information and data to support
     the test safety review process.

        13.3.4.1. (Added-AFMC) Comply with this guidance.
        13.3.4.2. (Added-AFMC) Provide resources to support the test safety review process.
        13.3.4.3. (Added-AFMC) Establish local processes and procedures for determining the need for
        formal Technical Review Boards (TRB) and SRB; the participation on these boards (to include the
        chairperson); the streamlined review process when formal boards are determined not necessary;
        and the approval process and authority as per AFMCPD 99-1. AFMC risk levels are defined in
        MIL-STD-882D, DOD Standard Practice for System Safety, para A.4.4.3.2.4 and Table A-IV.
     13.3.5. (Added-AFMC) Test Organization Safety Office will:
        13.3.5.1. (Added-AFMC) Be responsible for the test safety review process.
        13.3.5.2. (Added-AFMC) Supplement this publication or develop a separate document that
        establishes the local process and procedures to support the requirements.
        13.3.5.3. (Added-AFMC) Determine the level of safety review required and the acceptance
        authority level for each level of risk (high, serious, medium, and low).
        13.3.5.4. (Added-AFMC) Inform HQ AFMC/SE/DO of high test risks prior to the test event and
        successful completion of the event. This will provide notification and support for those high risk
        test events.

        ensure comprehensive review of program safety requirements.
     13.3.6. (Added-AFMC) Test Manager/Planner will:
        13.3.6.1. (Added-AFMC) Contact the safety office and provide information concerning test
        requirements.
        13.3.6.2. (Added-AFMC) Develop the safety plan as a part of the test plan. Provide technical
        assistance in developing the safety plan/solution.
        13.3.6.3. (Added-AFMC) Ensure that testing is conducted according to the approved safety plan/
        solution.
        13.3.6.4. (Added-AFMC) Request the Test Center Maintenance Group CCs to identify a mainte-
        nance member for each SRB.
AFI91-202_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 3 JUNE 2008                                                                93


13.4. (Added-AFMC) Test Safety Review Process. The test safety review process consists of these
main functions: planning, review, coordination and approval, execution, safety revisions, feedback and
test completion or termination. All test programs (ground, flight, space, etc.) will follow this process
through the life of the program (see Figure 13.1. (Added)). Test safety success depends on early and con-
tinuous involvement of the test safety personnel. Safety's early involvement as an integral member in test
planning may mitigate cost or schedule impacts to the test program.

Figure 13.1. (Added-AFMC) Test Safety Review Process.




13.5. (Added-AFMC) Test Safety Planning:
   13.5.1. (Added-AFMC) Test unique hazards will be identified and considered during the earliest
   stages of system development, and test planning and development. Test managers/planners will
   ensure a test safety representative is involved in early test concept development or Test Planning
   Working Group meetings.
   13.5.2. (Added-AFMC) Safety planning and technical planning are an integral and interactive pro-
   cess. It may be convenient to assess technical issues separately from safety issues; however, test man-
   agers shall consider both issues during the test planning process. Test safety representatives will assist
   the test managers/planners throughout this process to provide inputs on all safety-related issues.
   13.5.3. (Added-AFMC) All test unique hazards should be identified. To facilitate this process, the
   test managers/planners should use all available resources. These include, but are not limited to:
       13.5.3.1. (Added-AFMC) System safety hazard analyses conducted on the test article or a simi-
       lar article.
       13.5.3.2. (Added-AFMC) Lessons learned from similar tests.
       13.5.3.3. (Added-AFMC) Inputs from other experienced or expert individuals, such as other test
       program managers, engineers, operations personnel and test safety personnel.
       13.5.3.4. (Added-AFMC) Other independent or internal hazard analyses.
   13.5.4. (Added-AFMC) Eliminate or control identified test unique hazards. Consideration should
   include:
       13.5.4.1. (Added-AFMC) Design of the test article or test facility.
       13.5.4.2. (Added-AFMC) Incorporation of safety devices into the test article or the test facility.
       13.5.4.3. (Added-AFMC) Provision for warning devices for the test article or test facility.
94                                             AFI91-202_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 3 JUNE 2008


        13.5.4.4. (Added-AFMC) Development of test procedures (to include build-up) and proper train-
        ing of the individuals conducting the test.
        13.5.4.5. (Added-AFMC) After establishing the hazard controls, identify the residual hazards.
     13.5.5. (Added-AFMC) Safety Plan/Solution Documentation. The following documents comprise
     the elements of the safety plan:
        13.5.5.1. (Added-AFMC) Test Hazard Analysis (THA). These are prepared during the test plan-
        ning phase and finalized during the safety review. Paragraph 13.14 describes the content of a
        THA.
        13.5.5.2. (Added-AFMC) Final Safety Review Documentation. This information provides a
        summary of the safety review. The SRB minutes may suffice if a formal board was held. This
        information will include, but is not limited to:
        13.5.5.3. (Added-AFMC) Date.
        13.5.5.4. (Added-AFMC) Test or project identifier.
        13.5.5.5. (Added-AFMC) SRB attendees or individuals who coordinated on the safety plan/solu-
        tion if an SRB was not convened.
        13.5.5.6. (Added-AFMC) Mishap accountability and mishap response procedures.
        13.5.5.7. (Added-AFMC) Specific minimizing procedures, controls, restrictions, and go/no-go
        lists.
        13.5.5.8. (Added-AFMC) Special considerations.
        13.5.5.9. (Added-AFMC) Action items.
        13.5.5.10. (Added-AFMC) Overall risk assessment.
        13.5.5.11. (Added-AFMC) Other Supporting Documentation.
13.6. (Added-AFMC) Test Safety Review:
     13.6.1. (Added-AFMC) Each test plan is subject to separate technical and safety reviews. Technical
     reviews for flight tests are covered in AFMCPD 99-1, Test and Evaluation (T&E) Risk Management.
     For other tests where there is no requirement for a formal technical review, the test safety office will
     determine when the technical adequacy of the plan is sufficient to continue with the safety review. The
     final safety review takes place after the technical adequacy of the test plan is approved.
     13.6.2. (Added-AFMC) When a test is ready for a safety review, test safety determines if an SRB is
     required based on the scope, complexity, similarity to previous tests, and anticipated risk level. A
     SSEA Team will act as the SRB for those procedures being demonstrated during a SSEA (para 9.7.
     herein).
        13.6.2.1. (Added-AFMC) If an SRB is required:
            13.6.2.1.1. (Added-AFMC) The Chief of the Test Safety Office or designee is the chairper-
            son for the SRB. Membership and attendees are stipulated in local supplements/publications.
            Minimal membership of the SRB includes independent technical and operations representa-
            tives, maintenance experts, safety experts, the test manager/planner, and other personnel
            directly involved in the test.
AFI91-202_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 3 JUNE 2008                                                                 95


          13.6.2.1.2. (Added-AFMC) The SRB reviews the test to ensure all hazards are identified and
          controls are developed. The SRB will certify the completeness of the safety plan and deter-
          mine the overall risk level of the test. The results of the SRB will be documented.
          13.6.2.1.3. (Added-AFMC) Test safety certifies whether the open action items have been
          accomplished prior to test execution. The SRB chairperson recommends to the approval
          authority whether or not to execute the test based on the SRB results.
      13.6.2.2. (Added-AFMC) If no SRB is required, test safety reviews the test and safety planning
      to ensure all hazards have been identified and controls have been developed. Test safety deter-
      mines the overall risk level of the test and recommends to the approval authority whether or not to
      execute the test.
   13.6.3. (Added-AFMC) Risk Level. To help manage a test and its risk, the safety review establishes
   a risk level for each individual hazard/test event as well as the test as a whole. .
13.7. (Added-AFMC) Test Safety Coordination and Approval:
   13.7.1. (Added-AFMC) The coordination and approval process for test safety plans will be estab-
   lished in the local supplement. In general, the higher the risk, the higher the approval authority will be.
   Tests assigned a risk level of high or serious require final approval by the test organization (center)
   commander or director. In the case of the AFRL, tests assigned a risk level of high will require final
   approval of the AFRL commander and tests asigned a serious will require final approval by the Direc-
   tor of the Technical Directorate.
   13.7.2. (Added-AFMC) The test planner/manager will certify the test plan is complete and the safety
   plan/solution is certified by test safety. The status of open action items from the technical or safety
   reviews will be documented and included with the test plan and safety solution and forwarded to the
   approval authority.
   13.7.3. (Added-AFMC) Non-concurrence by a coordinating official will be resolved before final
   approval. If the issue cannot be resolved, it will be presented to the approval authority for resolution.
   13.7.4. (Added-AFMC) Local supplements will specify approval authority required before perform-
   ing individual test events based on the risk level for that event. A test event can be a sortie, a specific
   test, or a test milestone.
13.8. (Added-AFMC) Test Execution:
   13.8.1. (Added-AFMC) The test planner/manager is responsible for reviewing the safety plan/solu-
   tion and ensuring all applicable requirements are incorporated into the test procedures. Test personnel
   will review the hazards, minimizing procedures or controls, emergency procedures or corrective
   actions, and go/no-go criteria before beginning the test.
   13.8.2. (Added-AFMC) The test will be conducted according to the approved test and safety plans.
   Changes to either of these plans will require further safety review. Changes may occur because of
   unexpected test results, overly restrictive controls, test program initiated changes, or hazards not pre-
   viously identified or adequately controlled.
13.9. (Added-AFMC) Project or Safety Plan Revisions:
   13.9.1. (Added-AFMC) Test planner will contact test safety if changes to the test or safety plans are
   required after approval has been granted to proceed with the test. Test safety will evaluate the safety
96                                               AFI91-202_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 3 JUNE 2008


     impact of the proposed change and determine the action necessary. Resulting actions may vary from
     no action, to amending the safety solution/plan, to reaccomplishing the safety review (Figure 13.1.
     (Added)). Local procedures will establish procedures to amend safety solutions/plans.
     13.9.2. (Added-AFMC) Local procedures will define the frequency of periodic test and safety plan
     reviews and the maximum number of amendments allowed to a safety plan.
13.10. (Added-AFMC) Project Completion or Termination. The test manager notifies test safety
when the test is complete. Notification includes any safety lessons learned, effectiveness of hazard con-
trols or minimizing procedures, unexpected hazards, value added from the safety review process, and sug-
gestions for improving the safety review process. The notification can be in several forms from a phone
call to a formal report, as long as it is documented for future use as a lessons learned.
13.11. (Added-AFMC) Special Considerations:
     13.11.1. (Added-AFMC) The test organization commander or director may approve deviations when
     required by special circumstances.
     13.11.2. (Added-AFMC) The test safety review process may be applied to operations other than test-
     ing. Examples include training, exercises, support plans, air shows, or contractor demonstrations, etc.
     13.11.3. (Added-AFMC) Safety reviews conducted by other organizations may be accepted at the
     discretion of test safety per AFI 99-101. This determination will be based in part on involvement of
     test safety in the safety review, the assets involved, and the adequacy of the technical and safety
     reviews.
     13.11.4. (Added-AFMC) Contractor test programs using AFMC resources (funding, furnished
     equipment, or personnel) will comply with the AFMC test safety process.
13.12. (Added-AFMC) THA Format. The THA is used to identify the test unique hazards and the
actions necessary to minimize or control them. A THA includes the following information:
     13.12.1. (Added-AFMC) Test Title. Provide information concerning test identification to relate this
     specific THA to a specific test or test series.
     13.12.2. (Added-AFMC) Hazard. This is the condition or situation that has the potential to result in
     a mishap or an accident. It is that condition or situation that precedes or accompanies the unplanned,
     uncontrolled release, transfer, or dissipation of energy (e.g., kinetic, potential, chemical, laser, nuclear,
     electrical, etc.) The statement describes the condition or situation, not the mishap itself.
     13.12.3. (Added-AFMC) Cause. A cause is the circumstance or action that leads to the hazard's
     occurrence. It may be a failure mode, operator error, or out-of-limit condition. A hazard may have
     multiple causes and each will be identified.
     13.12.4. (Added-AFMC) Effect. This is the mishap or accident to be avoided. It identifies who or
     what resources will be injured, damaged, or destroyed if the hazard occurs.
     13.12.5. (Added-AFMC) Controls/Minimizing Procedures. Explain the actions to be taken (e.g.,
     remove, mitigate, or warn of the existence of a hazard cause) to prevent the hazard from occurring.
     13.12.6. (Added-AFMC) Corrective Actions/Emergency Procedures. These are steps to be taken if
     the hazard should occur. These are used to recover from a hazardous situation, or to limit the extent of
     the injury or damage due to a hazard that is occurring.
     13.12.7. (Added-AFMC) Comments. Additional considerations may be recorded here.
AFI91-202_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 3 JUNE 2008                                                             97


  13.12.8. (Added-AFMC) Hazard Category. Use the category definitions established by the Risk
  Assessment Matrix and MIL-STD-882.
  13.12.9. (Added-AFMC) Hazard Probability. Use the probability definitions established in the Risk
  Assessment Matrix and MIL-STD-882. The probability will consider that the hazard may have multi-
  ple dependent or independent causes.
  13.12.10. (Added-AFMC) Risk Level. Assigning a residual mishap risk level is a prime purpose of
  the THA process and this form. The residual mishap risk level (high, serious, medium, or low) is
  arrived at by determining the hazard category and the hazard probability using a matrix similar to
  MIL-STD-882D, Table A-IV. The hazard category for a test-specific hazard is easily established;
  however, assignment of the hazard probability can be highly subjective, and is at the very heart of risk
  assessment. It is here that considerable insight, experience, and engineering judgment come into play.

      must conduct a personal interview to evaluate entry qualifications that cannot be verified from person-
      nel records or by other means. Send interview results to HQ AFSC/SER with the member's applica-
      tion or attach a statement that no OPR is available in the immediate locale.
      A2.2.2. Note 411. Certification by the commander or staff agency head assigned responsibility for
      the retraining in AFSC must accompany the application.
      A2.2.3. Note 412--MAJCOM OPR Requirement. The MAJCOM OPR functionally responsible
      for this AFSC must review the application and furnish a recommendation to MAJCOM training offi-
      cials to help evaluate whether approving the request is in the best interest of the US Air Force and the
      member. NOTE: For more information on US Air Force training advisory notes, contact the base per-
      sonnel formal training section.

A2.3. 1S0X1 Retrainee Interview Checklist. The host safety staff must use the following 1S0X1
Retrainee Interview Checklist when interviewing potential retrainees for the safety career field. The staff
may add other items to the checklist to fit local needs. This interview process helps ensure that only
retrainee applicants with a high probability of success enter the safety career field. Interviewers must
include specific comments on each checklist item in the "After the Interview" section in the recommenda-
tion letter and a statement that all checklist items under "Preparation" and "The Interview" were com-
pleted.
      A2.3.1. Preparation:
         A2.3.1.1. Verify that the candidate possesses the mandatory prerequisites specified in AFMAN

                                      HIGH RISK ACTIVITIES
A2.1. (Added-HILL) The Air Force regards its members as its most important asset and requires each of
us to take reasonable care to prevent injury or loss of life. High-risk sports and recreational activities
require particular vigilance. The purpose of the High Risk Activity (HRA) program is not to restrict per-
sonal activities of military members, but to ensure personnel who participate in HRAs take necessary
actions to mitigate unacceptable risks.
A2.2. (Added-HILL) Military personnel participating in the following activities must inform their
immediate supervisor of their participation:
      A2.2.1. (Added-HILL) All Terrain Vehicle Use.
      A2.2.2. (Added-HILL) Auto Racing.
      A2.2.3. (Added-HILL) Hot Air Ballooning.
      A2.2.4. (Added-HILL) Boating.
      A2.2.5. (Added-HILL) Bungee Jumping.
      A2.2.6. (Added-HILL) Civil Light Aircraft Flying.
      A2.2.7. (Added-HILL) Dirt Biking (off-road motorcycle or bicycle MX).
      A2.2.8. (Added-HILL) Experimental Aircraft Flying.
      A2.2.9. (Added-HILL) Civil Helicopter Flying.
      A2.2.10. (Added-HILL) Hunting.
      A2.2.11. (Added-HILL) Jet Skiing/Personal Water Craft.
      A2.2.12. (Added-HILL) Motorcycling Racing.
      A2.2.13. (Added-HILL) Mountain Climbing/Rappelling (in/outdoors).
      A2.2.14. (Added-HILL) Parasailing.
      A2.2.15. (Added-HILL) Powered Parachute (Ultralight Aircraft).
      A2.2.16. (Added-HILL) White Water Rafting.
      A2.2.17. (Added-HILL) Rodeo/Bull-Riding.
      A2.2.18. (Added-HILL) Scuba Diving.
      A2.2.19. (Added-HILL) Ski Jumping (snow).
      A2.2.20. (Added-HILL) Sky Diving.
      A2.2.21. (Added-HILL) Soaring.
      A2.2.22. (Added-HILL) Skiing/Snowboarding.
      A2.2.23. (Added-HILL) Snowmobiling.
A2.3. (Added-HILL) The benefits of this program depend on the involvement of everyone. Command-
ers will select officers, civilians, or Non-Commissioned Officers NCOs to conduct HRA briefings and
AFI91-202_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 3 JUNE 2008                                                               115


ensure all military members participating in high-risk activities are briefed upon assignment, prior to ini-
tial participation, and periodically thereafter depending on level of activity and supervisor discretion. The
individual who is planning to participate in high-risk activities should complete the activity-specific
checklist below. Once finished, the individual and his/her supervisor must complete the High-Risk Activ-
ities Worksheet in Attachment 4 to document the risk assessment.
A2.4. (Added-HILL) In no case does the supervisor’s role replace the individual’s responsibility. Indi-
viduals must exercise sound judgment and risk management to preserve their ability to perform their Air
Force duties.

       HAZARDOUS AIR TRAFFIC REPORT (HATR) PROGRAM RCS: HAF-SE (AR) 7602

A3.1. General:
      A3.1.1. HATR information is vital to Air Force flight safety. It is administered by the unit safety
      office and is not designed to be a disciplinary mechanism for reporting or correcting violations of the
      Federal Aviation Regulations or any Air Force directives. The sole purpose of data collected under
      the HATR program is for mishap prevention. HATR reports are not privileged information and may be
      released outside the US Air Force. All reports will be investigated.

A3.2. HATR Reporting
      A3.2.1. Reportable Incidents
         A3.2.1.1. NMAC: Aircrew took abrupt evasive action to avoid a collision or would have taken
         evasive action if circumstances allowed. NOTE: The term AIRMISS is often used in Europe for
         such incidents.
         A3.2.1.2. Hazardous air traffic conditions: Less than required separation existed between aircraft
         IAW all applicable directives or any occurrence that did or could compromise flight safety.
         A3.2.1.3. Communications or navigation aids (NAVAID) anomalies: Any equipment indication
         that did or could contribute to a hazardous air traffic condition.
         A3.2.1.4. Hazardous procedures: Any system, publication, or directive that did or could contrib-
         ute to a hazardous air traffic condition.
         A3.2.1.5. Hazardous ground incidents: Any occurrence, including vehicle operations, on the
         movement area that endangered an airborne aircraft or an aircraft on the ground.
      A3.2.2. Reporting Procedures:
         A3.2.2.1. Anyone aware of a reportable incident files a HATR, RCS: HAF-SE (AR) 7602.
         A3.2.2.2. Report the details on AF Form 651 within 24 hours to the base safety office if you are
         at the Air Force base where the incident occurred. Submit the form to the nearest US Air Force
         Base Safety Office after landing if the incident occurred during flight. Unit commanders will
         ensure AF Form 651, Hazardous Air Traffic Report (HATR), is available to aircrew at base opera-
         tions facilities, flying squadron operations offices, in trip kits, and in US Air Force air traffic con-
         trol facilities.
         A3.2.2.3. If you have a NMAC, inform the nearest air traffic control agency or flight service sta-
         tion and provide the following information:
             A3.2.2.3.1. Your identification or call sign.
             A3.2.2.3.2. Time and place (name of NAVAID, radial, and distance) of the incident.
             A3.2.2.3.3. Altitude or flight level.
             A3.2.2.3.4. Description of the other aircraft.
AFI91-202_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 3 JUNE 2008                                                          117


          A3.2.2.3.5. Advise the agency that you intend to file a written Near Midair Collision Report
          and request that the controllers save all available data.

A3.3. Unit Safety Office Responsibilities
   A3.3.1. Within 24 hours after being notified of the incident, the safety office receiving the HATR
   determines which safety office is responsible for the investigation. Follow this order of priority:
       A3.3.1.1. The US Air Force safety office at the base where the incident occurred.
       A3.3.1.2. The safety office at the originator's home station, if there is no US Air Force safety
       office where the incident occurred.
       A3.3.1.3. The overseas MAJCOM, if host nation air traffic services (ATS) or foreign aircraft are
       involved.
       A3.3.1.4. When flying in a NATO environment, comply with NATO STANAG 3750, “Reporting
       and Investigation of Airmiss Incidents”, except do not report the name of the aircraft commander.
   A3.3.2. Notify the safety office responsible for investigating the HATR and mail or fax a copy of AF
   Form 651 to them. NOTE: If the incident occurred overseas and the HATR is filed at a base located
   in the United States, notify the overseas investigating office by message. This report is designated
   emergency status Code D. Discontinue reporting during emergency conditions. During MINIMIZE,
   use regular mail. Don't assign a report identifier.

A3.4. Immunity: To encourage reporting, individuals submitting HATRs are granted immunity from
disciplinary action if:
   A3.4.1. Their violation was not deliberate.
   A3.4.2. They committed no criminal offense.
   A3.4.3. No mishap occurred.
   A3.4.4. They properly reported the incident.

A3.5. Investigation and Evaluation Procedures:
   A3.5.1. The Investigating Safety Office will follow these procedures:
       A3.5.1.1. Assign a report identifier to use with all correspondence relating to the incident. The
       identifier contains:
          A3.5.1.1.1. The date of the incident (year, month, day).
          A3.5.1.1.2. The wing or base designation.
          A3.5.1.1.3. The serial number of the report (for example, HATR 91-12-16 63 AW-01). The
          serial number starts with number 1 at the beginning of each fiscal year. NOTE: ASAP users
          use assigned report identifiers.
       A3.5.1.2. Determine which organizations were involved and request the proper safety office to
       help in the investigation. Notify:
          A3.5.1.2.1. The unit if local base aircraft were involved
118                                             AFI91-202_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 3 JUNE 2008


             A3.5.1.2.2. The base ATS management if US Air Force ATS or NAVAIDs were involved.
             A3.5.1.2.3. The FAA facility or FSDO if FAA ATS or civil aircraft were involved. NOTE:
             Contact the FAA Air Force Representative (AFREP) for help in notifying the proper facility or
             FSDO. See Table A3.1. In some cases, the local US Air Force office of primary responsibil-
             ity (OPR) for ATS can provide a direct link with the FAA but communications with the FAA
             by a local safety office should normally be through the AFREP.
             A3.5.1.2.4. The appropriate US Defense Attachè Office if the HATR occurred overseas and
             information about civil aircraft or host air traffic facilities is not available through normal
             channels.
         A3.5.1.3. Send a HATR preliminary or a preliminary/final message within 10 work days. See
         Figure A3.1. for the proper format. Refer to Table A3.2. for correct addressees. This report is
         designated emergency status Code D. Discontinue reporting during emergency conditions. Dur-
         ing MINIMIZE, use regular mail.
         A3.5.1.4. If the investigation is not completed within 10 working days, send a supplemental mes-
         sage every 90 days to the same addressees as the preliminary message. Continue the supplemental
         messages until the investigation is closed and a final message is sent.
      A3.5.2. Units that provide air traffic services must:
         A3.5.2.1. Work closely with the base safety office throughout the investigation.
         A3.5.2.2. Make sure the report clearly explains the reason(s) why the incident occurred and show
         how the corrective actions will prevent a recurrence.
      A3.5.3. Air Force Representative (AFREP) at FAA Regional Offices reviews all HATRs and pro-
      vides help when requested.
      A3.5.4. MAJCOM safety offices, with the assistance from the OPR for AETC, establish procedures
      to carry out the HATR program. The MAJCOM safety office will determine if a reportable incident
      occurred. If not, notify the local unit safety office and AFSC.
      In addition, overseas MAJCOMs:
         A3.5.4.1. Issue supplemental procedures to carry out this program that agree with foreign air traf-
         fic control agreements in their area of responsibility.
         A3.5.4.2. Determine which agency should investigate HATRs involving host nation aircraft or
         ATS.
         A3.5.4.3. Ensure unit safety offices fully investigate the reports.
      A3.5.5. Air Force Flight Standards Agency (AFFSA) OPR for ATS:
         A3.5.5.1. Receive and evaluate all HATRs for trends and concerns that may affect Air Force ATS.
         A3.5.5.2. Provide AFSC, Aviation Safety Directorate, recommendations for resolving trends and
         concerns not under Air Force jurisdiction..
         A3.5.5.3. Assist AFSC in HATR summary development.
      A3.5.6. The AFSC OPR for HATRs:
         A3.5.6.1. Administer the program and ensure that safety offices fully investigate the reports. .

     A3.5.6.2. Keep an automated data file on all reports.
     A3.5.6.3. Compile a quarterly HATR summary and send a copies to HQ USAF/SE, HQ AFFSA,
     and MAJCOM OPRs for ATS and Safety.

NOTES:
1. Addresses may change. Contact the ATS facility closest to you or your AFREP for current addresses. If the addressee can-
not receive electronic mail, use FAX or normal mail. Manager Flight Standards Divisions (FSD) and Air Traffic Divisions
(ATD) share the same mailing address as the AFREP (table 1). Substitute FSD or ATD for AFREP and change the office num-
ber to 200 for FSDs and 500 for ATDs.
2. Consider the ATS or the ownership of the aircraft and the users of the scheduled air space involved, if any.

BUNGEE JUMPING
 Number                                     Item                              Pos.    Neg.     NA
    1   Have you ever bungee jumped before?
    2   Is the company you will be jumping with or the "jumpmaster"
        registered with the USBA (United States Bungee Association) thus
        ensuring certain rules and safety items are adhered to?
    3   Are you familiar with the difference between Bungy (lower velocity,
        smoother ride) and Bungee (more freefall, higher G-load)?
    4   Will you be jumping from a bridge or a crane with a "cage-type"
        platform?
    5   If jumping from a crane, are you aware of the restrictions placed on
        the angle of the crane, the height of the cage and distance the cage
        should be below the crane so that you may recognize an improperly
        operated "crane-jump" business?
    6   If the jump will be accomplished off of a car/pedestrian bridge, do
        you realize that there are only a few bridges in all of North America
        that have been approved for bungee jumping and that the
        organization operating off of a bridge is most likely doing so
        illegally?
    7   Are you familiar with the wind restrictions associated with bungee
        jumping?
    8   Will you be making an ankle jump, or will you be tied off at the
        waist?
    9   If tied off at the waist, will the required "cradle-type" harness be
        used?
   10   Does the individual have any personal risk factors that could
        preclude them from participating, i.e., financial, family, work?

        instructor (CFI) who is experienced in that airplane in the phases of
        flight that you intend to participate, and do you know the aircraft’s
        limitations? (Examples: new aircraft, high performance aircraft or
        tailwheel aircraft checkout required by FAR part 61).
    4   Have you successfully completed a flight review, received a new or
        additional FAA rating, or completed any full phase of the FAA
        Wings Program within the past two years.
    5   How many times have you flown in the area you’re planning to fly
        in?
    6   When planning a cross-country flight do you consider weight and
        balance, fuel consumption, landmarks and familiar/unfamiliar
        terrain, effects of density altitude, etc?
    7   Does the aircraft have an airworthiness certificate and current
        annual inspection?
    8   Do you plan to fly in formation? Do you understand that all
        formation flying must be briefed and agreed to by all pilots
        involved?
    9   Do you intend to fly in mountainous terrain? Have you received
        mountain training before flying into the environment?
   10   Do you realize that there is never anything going on at work that
        justifies the compromise of flight safety, or that requires you to push
        past the limit on marginal or worse flying weather?

   11   Does you have any personal risk factors that could preclude them
        from participating, i.e., financial, family, work?
   12   Is your DD Form 93 accurate and up to date?
   13   Are you aware of flight fatigue? FAA regulation 135.263 requires
        pilots to have at least 9 hours of consecutive rest for less than 8
        hours of scheduled flight time. Remember; never push weather to
        get back to duty on a certain day. There is nothing going on at work
        that requires you to do so.

                                          MISHAP RESPONSE

A4.1. General. Pre-mishap response planning by safety staffs must address appropriate participation in
all base-level responses, including:
      A4.1.1. Major Accidents
      A4.1.2. Hazardous materials accidents
      A4.1.3. Natural disasters
      A4.1.4. Nuclear weapons accidents
      A4.1.5. Conventional Munitions Incidents

A4.2. Base OPlan 32-1. The basic response planning document is Base OPlan 32-1. It consists of sepa-
rate annexes for Major Peacetime Accidents (Annex A), Natural Disasters (Annex B), Enemy Attack
(Annex C), and Distribution (Annex A). The host safety office should be reflected in Annex Z and sup-
ported by tenants as locally required. A “Safety” tab is required for Annexes A and B; since losses due to
hostile action are not investigated as safety mishaps, safety personnel normally support Annex C activities
only at the request of the installation commander.

A4.3. Planning Factors (All Accidents/Incidents/Unusual Occurrences).
      A4.3.1. Disaster Response Force (DRF).
         A4.3.1.1. The DRF is made up of the Disaster Control Group (DCG), the base command post,
         unit control centers, and specialized teams. If organizational manning permits, the host safety
         office should plan to establish a “unit control center” to coordinate safety activities between the
         accident scene and the supporting installation. If manning does not permit a separate safety unit
         control center, the safety staff must be reachable through the base command post.
         A4.3.1.2. Upon notification of a major peacetime accident, the safety staff typically begins to
         assemble an interim safety investigation board (SIB) in accordance with AFI 91-204. This pro-
         cess should be kept separate from participation in the DRF or Disaster Control Group (see below)
         if possible. If manning permits, the interim SIB should assemble at a location away from the acci-
         dent scene until the interim SIB members can be assigned to specific tasks.
      A4.3.2. Disaster Control Group (DCG). The DCG responds to peacetime major accidents and nat-
      ural disasters to provide on-scene command and control of USAF military resources and functional
      expertise. Normally, the DCG consists of the following members: (see AFI 32-4001 for more
      details).
         A4.3.2.1. On-Scene Commander (OSC)
         A4.3.2.2. Civil Engineer
         A4.3.2.3. Fire Department
         A4.3.2.4. Security Police
         A4.3.2.5. Medical Representative
AFI91-202_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 3 JUNE 2008                                                              153


       A4.3.2.6. Bioenvironmental Engineer
       A4.3.2.7. Maintenance
       A4.3.2.8. Munitions
       A4.3.2.9. Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD)
       A4.3.2.10. Staff Judge Advocate
       A4.3.2.11. Services
       A4.3.2.12. Public Affairs
       A4.3.2.13. Communications-Computers
       A4.3.2.14. Safety
       A4.3.2.15. Weather
       Ideally, the safety representative to the DCG should not be responsible for assembling the interim
       SIB.

A4.4. Source Documents for Specific Planning Criteria. The two primary sources of detailed plan-
ning guidance for safety staffs are AFMAN 32-4004, Emergency Response Operations, and AFP 127-1,
USAF Guide to Mishap Investigation. The former contains an “Accident Response Checklist” for DCG
safety representative and guidance for developing a unit control center checklist; the latter describes spe-
cialized equipment requirements and an expanded set of tasks for interim SIB members.

A4.5. Safety Response to Other than Major Peacetime Accidents. Some mishaps may not warrant a
full activation of the DRF. However, the safety staff may need some DCG elements to support investiga-
tion of these less severe incidents, such as Combat Camera or Civil Engineering Specialists. Each safety
staff should consult with their supporting base readiness flight (disaster preparedness function) to deter-
mine how to formally provide for partial DCG support when the full DRF is not activated.

A4.6. Munitions Rapid Response Team. OO-ALC/LIW has developed a conventional munitions rapid
response team to support Air Force units throughout the world anytime a munitions incident occurs. This
team is made up of experts (engineers, equipment specialists, program managers, and safety personnel)
from the conventional weapons and munitions programs. These personnel are able to travel anywhere in
the world within 24 to 48 hours to assist in determining the cause of a failure. If your MAJCOM or unit
has an incident, and this team’s help is desired, contact OO-ALC/LIW to request support by calling DSN
777-5156, 5053, 5055, or 4865 during duty hours. If after duty hours contact Hill AFB Command Post at
DSN 777-3007 or Commercial (801) 777-3007.

SUPERVISOR'S REVIEW AND BRIEFING SECTION
BRIEFING INSTRUCTIONS: Supervisors should discuss training, experience, use of safety equipment,
rules, and precautions with personnel participating in high-risk activities. This risk assessment is not
intended to prohibit personnel from participating in high-risk activities, but to ensure they are familiar
with the hazards and injury potential of these activities. The supervisor's role in safety does not replace
the individual's responsibility. The individual must exercise sound judgment and self-discipline and not
put life, limb, or the performance of his or her Air Force duties in jeopardy.

                               WEAPONS SAFETY MANNING PLAN

A5.1. Requirement. It is critical for the Air Force to recruit strong performers into Weapons Safety.
Weapons Safety positions are filled by 2WXXX and 2MXXX NCOs using a Special Experience Identifier
(SEI). Most assigned individuals will be assigned to Weapons Safety only once, for a two to three year
period, in their career. Superior performers may be assigned two or more times in increasingly challeng-
ing Weapons Safety positions. It is therefore essential that candidates be fast learning, highly motivated
individuals.

A5.2. Recruitment. The above requirement makes it necessary for individuals in the safety office to
actively recruit, whenever possible, when they are in units with the appropriate AFSCs. Also, the Chief
of Safety should be in close contact with the Logistics Group and appropriate squadron commanders iden-
tifying well suited candidates. Wing staff experience, the ability to work both flight line and munitions
storage issues, and an opportunity to broaden an individuals experience by learning the safety discipline,
are all reasons for an individual to volunteer for Weapons Safety. The communicative skills and wide
range of responsibilities inherent in the position are all desirable abilities for a potential senior NCO to
have.

A5.3. Selection Process. When an individual volunteers to be assigned to Weapons Safety they should
go to the Safety office on the base they are assigned and be interviewed by the Chief of Safety. The Chief
of Safety, using the interview process in Attachment 2 of this AFI, will tailor the process for Weapons
Safety, working closely with the Chief of Weapons Safety. Names of candidates who are well suited for
assignment will be forwarded by the Chief of Safety to the MPF. The MPF will then notify AFPC of the
individuals eligibility and desires. Prior to assignment if possible, the MAJCOM will send the individual
TDY to the Weapons Safety school. If possible the TDY should be accomplished in conjunction with the
PCS.

A5.4. SEI Assignment. All individuals assigned to Weapons Safety must be trained within 90 days after
assignment to Weapons Safety. If an individual arrives at the safety office without training, work with the
MAJCOM to immediately assign the individual to training. Upon completion of training and six months
in the assignment, generate SEI certification paperwork. At that time the Chief of Safety, in coordination
with the individual and the Chief of Weapons Safety, will award the SEI to individuals who have demon-
strated the skills needed to be assigned to a more challenging Weapons Safety assignment. This is highly
desirable, since many assignments are at higher headquarters positions.
