This Airlift Wing instruction implements Air Force Instruction (AFI) 63-1001, Aircraft
Structural Integrity Program and extends guidance of AFI 21-101, Air Force Reserve Command
(AFRC) Sup1, Aerospace Equipment Maintenance Management. It applies to all 302 Airlift
Wing (AW) personnel involved in the maintenance and operation of aircraft. It defines the
responsibilities and procedures followed by appropriate organizations in implementing and
sustaining the Aircraft Structural Integrity Program (ASIP). This publication references DoD
Regulation 5000.2, Mandatory Procedures for Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAPs)
and Major Automated Information System (MAIS) Acquisition Programs, MIL-STD-1530C,
Aircraft Structural Integrity Program, Technical Order, (T.O.) 1C-130-101, Implementation of
C-130 Series Aircraft Usage Report, and Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 63-1, Acquisition
and Sustainment Life Cycle Management. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes
prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with AFMAN 33-363, Management
of Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule
(RDS) located at https://afrims.amc.af.mil/.

1. General Information. The C-130 ASIP is managed by the C-130 System Program Office,
WRALC/LBRA. This office analyzes data provided by unit operations and maintenance
functions using a web-based program called USAF C-130 Automated Inspection, Repair,
Corrosion, and Aircraft Tracking (AIRCAT). Operations personnel input aircraft usage data
using the Usage Data Input (UDI) segment and aircraft maintenance personnel utilize the
Inspection Corrosion And Repair Recording (ICARR) segment for documenting required ASIP
inspections, aircraft structural repairs, and reports of damage to aircraft structures. A major
function of the AIRCAT system is to provide data to generate the Aircraft Structural Integrity

        OJT training will include, at a minimum, familiarization with ICARR and AIRCAT and a
        review of required ASIP inspections and reportable damage specific to unit aircraft and
        work center. Training will be documented on a Training Business Area (TBA) generated
        797 Job Qualification Standard (JQS).
        3.2.4. Ensure compliance with AFI 63-133, Aircraft Information Program (AIP) and

            3.2.4.1. The Avionics Flight Chief will act as the group project officer for AIP,
            which supports ASIP, and will ensure the requirements of AFI 21-101, Chapter 14 are
            accomplished.
        3.2.5. OPR shall coordinate with the ICARR program manager and local Computer
