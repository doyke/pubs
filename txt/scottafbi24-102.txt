SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This revision changes the reference Maintenance Control and Analysis (MC&A) to Vehicle Management
and Analysis (VM&A) and vehicle maintenance manager to fleet manager due to AFMAN 24-307 and
AFI 24-302 combining into AFI 23-302.


1. Procedures. Upon notification or identification of damage resulting from an accident or suspected
abuse (defined as other than normal wear and tear), the following procedures apply:
   1.1. The Customer Service Center (CSC) will initiate and forward an AF Form 1823, Vehicle and
   Equipment Work Order, to estimate the cost of repairs to Vehicle Management and Analysis
   (VM&A). For General Services Administration (GSA)-leased vehicles, the using organization is
   responsible for obtaining estimates for repair from two local GSA-approved vendors. If CSC deter-
   mines the damage to be over $2,500.00, the using organization must obtain three estimates. The esti-
   mates will be submitted to VM&A who will document, track, and control discrepancies. The fleet
2                                                                 SCOTTAFBI24-102 24 AUGUST 2007


    manager or superintendent will review the estimate and forward to 375th Logistic Readiness Squad-
    ron Commander. The 375 LRS/CC will review the estimate and send a package to the commander of
    the unit responsible for the damage. A copy will also be sent to the Wing Safety Office. The package
    will include a notification letter and an estimate of the cost to repair the vehicle, unsigned “Transfer of
    Funds Letter” (Attachment 2), and unsigned “Vehicle Release Letter” (Attachment 3).
    1.2. The unit commander or designated representative will be responsible for investigating accident
    or abuse cases for vehicles assigned to his or her unit. The 375 LRS is responsible for identifying sus-
    pected abuse cases. If the unit does believe the incident was vehicle abuse, the Vehicle Control Officer
    (VCO)/Noncommissioned Officer (NCO) should contact the fleet manager or superintendent with
    applicable information. Arbitration of the case will follow the chain of command until resolved. The
    375 LRS will not make repairs to the damaged vehicle until the using unit commander returns the
    vehicle release letter, indicating he or she no longer needs access to the vehicle for the investigation of
    the vehicle accident or abuse. The using unit commander must return the letter within 10 days. Fund-
    ing for all vehicles damaged from accidents or abuse will be supplied by either the organization
    assigned the vehicle or by the organization using the vehicle at the time of damage. The 375 LRS will
    not begin repairs on the vehicle until after receipt of the signed Transfer of Funds Letter unless
    approved by 375 LRS/CC. The letter will be forwarded to Accounting and Finance for execution of
    reimbursement. For GSA-leased vehicles, VM&A will fax the estimates to GSA who will provide
    written authorization and appoint a local vendor for repair. All correspondence will be maintained in
    the vehicle’s history file.
    1.3. The unit commander may pursue collection from the responsible individual through the Report
    of Survey Process (Ref: AFMAN 23-220, Reports of Survey for Air Force Property). NOTE: When
    individual payment for damage is anticipated, the actual amount of the repair will be computed using
    AF Form 20, Repair Cost and Reparable Value Statement, which can be accomplished after the
    repairs are made and the work order has cleared the on-line Vehicle Integrated Management System.

2. Forms Adopted: AF Form 20, Repair Cost and Reparable Value Statement, and AF Form 1823,
Vehicle and Equipment Work Order.
