SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This revision focuses on USAFA recall procedures and the communication flow between base agencies,
control centers, and senior leadership. Therefore, the instruction name was changed from “USAFA Com-
mand and Control” to “Alert Notification Procedures.” This revision updates the organizational structure.
It replaces all reference to the HQ USAFA/AH with HQ USAFA/AD and replaces the 34 TRW to
USAFA/CW. It also better defines the unit strength reporting procedures and updates recall procedures. It
replaces the former termonology Crisis Action Team (CAT) to Installation Control Center (ICC) and
Emergency Operations Center (EOC) and shows which agencies are assigned. The new term Group Con-
trol Center (GCC) has been introduced, and it shows what agencies are assigned as Group and Unit Con-
trol Centers. New attachments have been introduced and former ones have been deleted or revised. This
document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. A margin bar indicates newly
revised material.

1. General.
   1.1. National and local emergencies and other contingencies require the USAF Academy (USAFA) to
   notify personnel or recall them to their place of duty. Notifications and recalls shall be as covert as
   possible to deny potential adversaries useful information and to avoid public alarm. This instruction
   establishes the requirement for all USAFA organizations to produce recall rosters to facilitate timely
   notification/recall of personnel. Depending on the situation, certain personnel may be excused from
   the recall, as determined by specific governing directives or the senior officer in charge. The USAFA
   Command Center (10 ABW/CP) is responsible for overall management of the base/wing alert notifi-
   cation system. The 10th Mission Support Squadron (10 MSS/DPMX) is responsible for overall man-
   agement of the wing personnel strength reporting system.
   1.2. Standard alert notification terminology will be used for each type of recall. Alert notification ter-
   minology consists of a number, verbiage (in bold face), and instructions to follow upon notification.
   All organizations maintaining a recall roster will have standard terminology for recalls printed on the
   back (see Attachment 6).
   1.3. Attachment 2 and Attachment 3 outline the flow of information from the 10 ABW/CP to base,
   wing and tenant agencies should notification be warranted. The diagrams show how information is
   transmitted for:
      1.3.1. Recall of military or civilian personnel.
      1.3.2. Natural, manmade incidents or accidents affecting the Academy.
      1.3.3. Other time-sensitive notifications as directed by the Superintendent or Commander, 10th
      Air Base Wing.
   1.4. Organizational Recall Rosters:
      1.4.1. All units assigned to, or working on, USAFA (to include tenant units and contracted agen-
      cies) will provide a copy of their recall roster to the Command Center addressed to 10 ABW/CP
      via BITS or e-mail to 10abw.cp@usafa.af.mil, 10th Security Forces Squadron Control Center
      (10 SFS/SFCC) via BITS or e-mail to 10sfs.s3l@usafa.af.mil, and to the organization that is
      responsible for making notification to each organization during pyramid notification procedures in
      accordance with (IAW) Attachment 5 and Attachment 6. These rosters will be used in notifying
      affected organizations of events or incidents.
      1.4.2. Organizational rosters will be submitted whenever changes occur but no later than 90 days
      since their last updated roster.
   1.5. Stand-by Memorandums:
      1.5.1. Stand-by memorandums are locally generated letters that designate personnel to provide
      assistance after duty hours in the event of an incident or an individual’s request. Assigned person-
      nel should be available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. It is the unit commander’s responsibility to
      determine whether or not his/her unit requires stand-by personnel. At a minimum, memorandums
      should include personnel to contact and their after duty phone numbers, stand-by to and from
      dates if rotating personnel, and a general synopsis of events that may generate notification.
      1.5.2. Organizations will provide a copy of their Stand-by memorandum to 10 ABW/CP, 10 SFS/
      SFCC, Telephone Switchboard (10 CS/SCXST; base information), and other agencies deemed
      necessary by their organizations. These memorandums will be used in notifying affected organiza-
4                                                                     USAFAI10-207 19 MARCH 2008


       tions of events or incidents related to them. Memorandums are to be updated quarterly or when
       changes occur.

2. Recall.
    2.1. Recall Exemptions and Stipulations.
       2.1.1. Crew Rest. Aircrew members in crew rest will be contacted for Alert Notifications derived
       from Attachment 6, but are not required to report for duty unless directed by the 306 FTG/CC or
       his/her designated alternate. These personnel should be accounted for as available for duty.
       2.1.2. Shift Workers. Shift workers in rest will be contacted for Alert Notifications derived from
       Attachment 6, but are not required to report for duty unless directed by their supervisor or com-
       mander. These personnel should be accounted for as available for duty.
       2.1.3. Mission Essential Federal Employees (MEFE). Those civilians identified by the com-
       mander as essential for the accomplishment of USAFA’s mission during contingencies or emer-
       gencies may be recalled. These personnel are considered emergency essential (E-E) civilian
       employees who are appointed, either temporarily or permanently, to an E-E DoD position. The cir-
       cumstances under which an employee is considered mission essential (i.e. unanticipated curtail-
       ment of operations based on extreme weather, unforeseen interruptions of transportation or
       buiding services) must be annotated in the employee’s 971.
       2.1.4. Exercises. Exercise recalls will typically be limited to permanent party active duty person-
       nel. Cadets, civilians and contractors will be contacted, notified and accounted for (as required)
       but will report at normal duty time. If cadets, civilians and/or contractors are physically recalled
       for an exercise, prior coordination and approval must be provided through the USAFA/CC, IG,
       CW and the 10 ABW/CC.
    2.2. Types of Recalls.
       2.2.1. Covert/Communications-out Recall (COMM-OUT). Recall mission essential person-
       nel, to include E-E civilians, as quickly as possible without public notice and minimizes action
       which might alarm the general public. The telephone is normally used but if the telephone is out or
       a person does not have a telephone, person-to-person contact is required. Therefore, it is recom-
       mended that commanders assign sector notification responsibilities to individuals and develop
       maps for their use in conducting Covert/Communications-out recall notifications.
             2.2.1.1. 10 ABW/CP will maintain a roster of key leadership with addresses to be passed to
             the SFCC for recalls under COMM-OUT conditions. When notified of a COMM-OUT recall,
             10th Security Forces Squadron patrols will be dispatched to the quarters of designated person-
             nel from each major mission element (HQ USAFA/CC, HQ USAFA/DF, HQ USAFA/PL,
             HQ USAFA/AD, USAFA/CW, 10 ABW/CC, 10 MSG/CC, 10 MDG/CC, and as required, the
             306FTG/CC, DoDMERB, and AFOSI 803 OL-A), to activate pyramid notifications. Person-
             nel notified by patrols will in turn implement notification procedures for their organization.
             10 SFS/SFO will dispatch patrols to notify personnel in the enlisted dormitories.
       2.2.2. Overt Recall. Recall personnel using the fastest means available. Telephone and public
       media (radio and television) are authorized for use.
       2.2.3. Telephone On-Call (Six Ring Recall). This notification is used to place personnel in an
       immediately available status to receive information or instructions by telephone, land mobile radio
USAFAI10-207 19 MARCH 2008                                                                                5


      (LMR), or pager. Personnel must stay by their telephone or have an operable LMR, pager or cellu-
      lar telephone in their possession. If personnel leave their home while telephone on-call proce-
      dures are in effect, it is their responsibility to inform their supervisor, the person who calls
      them and/or work center of how they may be reached.
      2.2.4. Tests. Used to assess the effectiveness of an organization’s telephone recall procedures.
          2.2.4.1. The recall roster is completed in its entirety by telephone and the last person contacted
          in each column notes the time of their notification and completes the chain by calling the unit
          commander. The latest time reported determines the “Total time” for the recall. ALL assigned
          personnel, with the exception of those personnel who are TDY or on Leave, will be contacted.
          Personnel are not required to report for duty.
      2.2.5. Notification Advisory. Used to notify personnel of an actual or imminent situation, (e.g.,
      severe weather) when they must be notified of early release, delayed reporting, base closure or
      other directed action other than a recall. Only personnel available for duty are contacted. Do not
      contact personnel on leave or temporary duty.
      2.2.6. Actual or Exercise. Used to direct personnel to report for duty during real world or exer-
      cise situations. The nature of the situation and senior leadership direction determines the personnel
      who will be recalled. It is paramount that personnel respond in an expeditious and safe man-
      ner. Millitary personnel report in an appropriate uniform (BDUs, ABUs, or Flightsuits). All
      personnel in duty status are to report for duty. Personnel in Non-Duty status (leave, temporary
      duty, crew rest or hospitalized) are contacted as directed or as required and will report for duty if
      so directed.
   2.3. Scope of Recall.
      2.3.1. Base. Used to recall or notify personnel USAFA wide for either exercise or actual situa-
      tions. Initiated by the USAFA Superintendent or his/her designated alternate. Tenant units will be
      recalled when deemed necessary by the USAFA Superintendent.
      2.3.2. Wing. Used to recall or notify personnel, assigned to the 10 ABW, for either exercise or
      actual situations. Normally initiated by the 10 ABW/CC or his/her designated representative. Ten-
      ant units will be recalled when deemed necessary by the 10 ABW/CC.
      2.3.3. Organizational. Initiated by the commander of an organization to recall that organization’s
      personnel for a specific reason.
      2.3.4. Selective. Used when a specific situation requires the recall of certain personnel, such as an
      Installation Control Center (ICC) and/or Emergency Operations Center (EOC). The 10th Air Base
      Wing Commander, or designated alternate, is responsible for initiating the recall(s).

3. Recall Roster Requirements.
   3.1. Recall rosters for all organizations will have the following minimum requirements according to
   Attachment 5 of this instruction.
      3.1.1. Commanders of organizations will review rosters monthly and generate new rosters as nec-
      essary or at a minimum, quarterly.
      3.1.2. Dispose of obsolete rosters by shredding so as to avoid unauthorized release of personal
      information.
6                                                                       USAFAI10-207 19 MARCH 2008


       3.1.3. Provide each listed person a copy of the roster.
       3.1.4. 10th Security Forces Squadron (10 SFS) will compile and maintain recall information for
       resource augmentation personnel assigned to support Security Force operations during crisis or
       exercises. The 10 SFS/SFCC will contact security forces augmentees for recall purposes. Refer to
       USAFAI 10-205, Augmentation Duty Program, for detailed procedures.
       3.1.5. Each individual will ensure personal information is current on recall rosters and keep the
       latest recall roster readily available at all times. Contact personnel as specified on the recall roster
       immediately upon notification of a recall. Ensure you personally talk to the individual. Leaving a
       message on an answering machine or with another person does NOT constitute contact with that
       person. When unable to contact an individual within five minutes, go to the next person(s) on the
       roster and continue the recall process. Do NOT delay notification or reporting but notify your
       supervisor of any person not contacted to ensure contact is made at the earliest opportunity. Note
       both the time you were notified and the time of the person(s) you contacted.
       3.1.6. Reporting. Report to your duty location in the appropriate uniform and DO NOT DELAY
       for personal grooming, meals, etc.
    3.2. COMM-OUT Pyramid Notification will be implemented when directed by senior staff. Organi-
    zational recall rosters must clearly identify personnel and home addresses of those who must be noti-
    fied when COMM-OUT procedures are implemented.

4. Release From Recall.
    4.1. The USAFA Superintendent/10th Air Base Wing Commander or their designated representative
    shall initiate release of personnel from recall.
       4.1.1. Release announcements shall be accomplished through the 10 ABW/CP or ICC/EOC stat-
       ing, “Recall is terminated.” Personnel are then released back to their supervisors for accountability
       and assignment of duty.

5. Strength Reporting.
    5.1. The 10th Mission Support Personnel Readiness Flight (PRF) is designated as the primary agency
    for strength reporting and personnel accounting data for the United States Air Force Academy.
       5.1.1. The PRF will:
           5.1.1.1. Collect unit strength reporting and personnel accounting data.
           5.1.1.2. When directed by the 10 ABW/CP or EOC (when activated), notify units to recall
           personnel on leave or Temporary Duty (TDY) by telephone and prepare recall log.
           5.1.1.3. Maintain current unit-assigned figures availability upon request.
           5.1.1.4. Ensure receipt of organizational reports within established time criteria, consolidate
           reports, and relay figures to the 10 ABW/CP and EOC (if activated).
    5.2. Group Control Centers and Unit Control Centers (GCCs and UCCs).
       5.2.1. The USAFA Command Center (10 ABW/CP) will initiate recalls upon direction from
       senior leadership. When directed to stand up GCCs and UCCs, the Command Center will notify
USAFAI10-207 19 MARCH 2008                                                                           7


     the 10 MSS/CC and GCCs. The 10 MSS/CC will notify the PRF. GCCs will inturn, notify UCCs
     to stand up (see Attachment 4).
     5.2.2. During disasters and contingencies, all GCCs and UCCs must activate immediately upon
     an Alert Notification of a Base, Wing, or Telephone On-Call recall. For all other alert notifica-
     tions, GCCs and UCCs will be activated at the discretion of the 10 ABW/CC or designated alter-
     nate. Once stood up, GCCs and UCCs will contact the PRF and 10 ABW/CP. UCCs that fall under
     a GCC will report their stand-up to their assigned GCC if applicable.
     5.2.3. UCCs are responsible for retrieving accountability of their assigned personnel. UCCs will
     directly report accountability to their respective GCCs (if assigned under a GCC). GCCs will
     report accountability of their UCCs under them to the PRF (commanders may identify a UCC as a
     GCC responsible for collecting data from units under his/her command). UCCs that do not fall
     under a GCC will report accountability to the PRF. The PRF will report accountability to the
     10 ABW/CP. The 10 ABW/CP will provide accountability to the Commander’s Senior Staff and/
     or the EOC (see Attachment 4). GCCs are the focal point for receiving accountability of their
     assigned personnel (to include staff) through their respective squadron/division UCCs. GCCs will,
     in turn, report accountability to the PRF. UCCs will report to their respective GCCs for accoun-

     (10 MSS/DPMX) and 10 ABW/CP those individuals assigned to their respective Group Control
     Centers (GCCs) and Unit Control Centers (UCCs) (see Attachment 11). Emergency Management
     (10 CES/CEX) requires each unit assigned a GCC/UCC complete a USAFA Form 11, Emergency
     Management (EM) Program Report. Forms will be completed, signed by the commander, and sent
     to 10 CES/CEX via BITS or e-mailed to 10ces_cex@usafa.af.mil. Form can be found at http://

     Direct Reporting Units.
     5.2.5. GCCs and UCCs are responsible for strength accounting. Personnel accounting procedures
     will begin at the reference hour (R-Hour) which stands for the recall start time. The 10 ABW/CC
     (or designated alternate) is responsible for activating GCCs/UCCs and determining the R-Hour.
     This determines when personnel strength reports are required by the PRF. (see Attachment 7).
        5.2.5.1. Total Unit Strength Assigned. The assigned strength is the number of personnel actu-
        ally assigned to the unit including personnel still carried on the unit strength report and
        includes civilians. Include the total number of military personnel, including those on pass,
        temporary duty (TDY), and leave or hospitalized assigned to the unit. Report all unit personnel
        assigned by category (officer, enlisted and civilian), regardless of duty status. DO NOT
        include foreign nationals, contractors or Individual Mobilization Augmenters (IMA). DO
        include personnel on terminal leave, inbound personnel, or personnel signed out of the unit
        due to permanent change of station (PCS), retirement or separation.
        5.2.5.2. Available for Duty. The number of personnel available for duty is the number of per-
        sonnel who can respond to the situation. Include all personnel currently on duty, and all other
        personnel contacted but not required to report for duty (such as those in crew rest). During
        exercises, personnel undergoing promotion testing, at military appointments or meetings, or
        performing exercise evaluator or controller duties are considered available for duty.

           (officer, enlisted and civilian).
           5.2.5.4. Total Present for Duty. Report all unit personnel who have reported for duty by cate-
           gory [officer, enlisted, civilian, and Air Force Reserve (AFR)]. Civilians will be contacted dur-
           ing recalls but will not report to work unless directed by the Senior Staff.
           5.2.5.5. TDY Notifications (REAL WORLD). When directed by the Commander or higher
           headquarters, GCCs and UCCs will recall individuals from TDYs (with the exception of those
           members deployed on Contingency TDYs, as these individuals are under the AOR com-
           mander's control). This notification will be accomplished using the most effective means (i.e.,
           telephone, email, DMS, etc.). GCCs and UCCs will prepare a single document for each indi-
           vidual or a combined listing of individuals who were recalled, where they were recalled from
           and by what means they were contacted (see Attachment 12). This document must be sent to
           the PRF upon confirmation of individual’s notification.
           5.2.5.6. TDY Notifications (EXERCISE ONLY). For all exercises and inspections, the GCCs
           and UCCs WILL prepare a word document but WILL NOT recall the members from TDY
           (see Attachment 12). These documents must be sent to the PRF NLT R-Hour plus 3 hours and
           30 minutes (R+3:30). These documents must be annotated “EXERCISE, EXERCISE, EXER-
           CISE.” Always comply with additional restrictions and statements set forth by the ground
           rules for the current exercise or inspection.

           Superintendent, 10th Air Base Wing Commander, or their designated alternates, GCCs and
           UCCs will recall individuals from leave and have them report to their duty section. Individuals
           may be selectively recalled as required. GCCs and UCCs may utilize the leave form address
           and phone number or other acceptable means to make contact. If unable to contact member at
           the emergency phone number or other acceptable means, immediately contact nearest military
           installation law enforcement agency for assistance. Additionally, GCCs and UCCs must notify
           PRF of individuals who are being recalled via word document (see Attachment 13). This doc-
           ument will include at the minimum, name, rank, SSAN, leave address, and phone number. A
           single document for each individual or a combined listing of individuals must be sent to the
           PRF upon confirmation of notification.
           5.2.5.8. Leave Notification (EXERCISE ONLY). For all exercises and inspections, the GCCs
           and UCCs WILL prepare a word document but WILL NOT recall the members from leave,
