This instruction establishes the Installation Security Education and Training Program implemented by Air
Force Instruction (AFI) 31-101, The Air Force Installation Security Program, by providing guidance and
procedures for developing, managing, conducting and assigning the responsibilities of the Installation
Security Constable. All military and Department of Defense (DoD) civilians and contract personnel
assigned to the installation other than security forces are identified as support forces in this publication.


1. Introduction. The establishment of the Installation Security Constable position, hereinafter referred to
as the Constable, is critical to an effective installation security education and training program impacting
the security of all Robins AFB protection level resources. Although the Constable works primarily with
those assigned to the flightline and controlled areas located around the installation supporting protection
level resources, the training that the Constable provides applies to the entire base populace. Security
awareness is paramount in providing appropriate protection for our resources.
   1.1. 78th Security Forces Squadron (78 SFS) Responsibilities. The Commander, 78 SFS (78 SFS/
   CC), will appoint the Constable in writing. The Constable will:
       1.1.1. Be assigned to the 78 SFS Installation Security Section (78 SFS/SFOS).
       1.1.2. Be an extremely professional security forces member, selected to perform these duties
       based on maturity level, experience, and proven performance.
       1.1.3. Conduct daily operations as directed by the 78 SFS/CC and local directives.
       1.1.4. Perform Phase I and Phase II training as required by AFI 31-101.
       1.1.5. Be the security education and training expert for the entire installation. Thorough knowl-
       edge of the Air Force and DoD instructions governing security is key to the success of this pro-
       gram. See references at Attachment 1.
       1.1.6. Additionally, be knowledgeable of antiterrorism procedures, intrusion detection systems,
       and the security forces training and evaluations process.

    1.2. Unit Responsibilities.
       1.2.1. All unit commanders will monitor the unit level of security awareness by ensuring widest
       participation in the program outlined in this publication.
       1.2.2. All unit security managers will:
           1.2.2.1. Serve as the unit office of primary responsibility (OPR) for the Phase I and II Security
           Education and Training Program by implementing and managing policy and procedures.
           1.2.2.2. Serve as the unit’s training advisor by advising the commander, unit personnel, and
           training activities on ways to improve their security awareness program.
           1.2.2.3. Coordinate with their unit training manager (UTM) in developing and implementing
           appropriate Phase I and II training to meet specific unit needs.

2. Establishing the Installation Security Education and Training Program.
    2.1. The Installation Security Education and Training Program is established under the authority of
    AFI 31-101 and Robins AFB Instruction (RAFBI) 31-101, Installation Security. Through this pro-
    gram, the Constable will communicate security policy and procedures, establish a relationship of trust
    with commanders from the entire installation, and provide supervisors with support and guidance
    needed to educate and motivate personnel assigned to their units.
    2.2. Methods of publicizing the program may include:
       2.2.1. Security awareness articles published periodically in the installation newspaper (Rev-up).
       2.2.2. The Security Education and Awareness Pamphlet maintained by the Constable and other
       handouts containing security education information.
       2.2.3. Briefings for commanders' calls and workcenter visits.
       2.2.4. Participation in the installation’s quarterly security manager meetings.
       2.2.5. Incentive programs sponsored by wing and unit commanders for positive security aware-
       ness actions.

3. Role of the Constable. The Constable is an educator, motivator, public relations representative and,
above all else, a professional who can be counted on for guidance and assistance. The Constable is a force
multiplier, bringing security forces and support forces together to obtain the overall state of security
required to protect our installation. The primary focus of the Constable will be to ensure the following
training is accomplished.
    3.1. Phase I, Orientation Training. As required by AFI 31-101, paragraph 7.2.2, this initial security
    awareness training will be performed during the mandatory indoctrination for all military, DoD civil-
    ian, and contractor personnel assigned to Robins AFB.
       3.1.1. The indoctrination briefing will be developed by the Constable and coordinated with the
       installation’s Military Personnel Flight prior to the training. The briefing should be easily under-
       stood and should include:
           3.1.1.1. Local threat conditions and how that threat applies to the individual.
ROBINSAFBI31-102 15 DECEMBER 2004                                                                        3


         3.1.1.2. Guidance from RAFBI 31-101 on restricted area entry, controlled area entry, and
         other pertinent installation specific security information.
         3.1.1.3. Escort procedures for restricted areas.
         3.1.1.4. Duress word procedures.
         3.1.1.5. Location and designation of protection level resources.
         3.1.1.6. Explanation of the Security Reporting and Alerting System used at Robins AFB
         which encompasses the HELPING HAND/COVERED WAGON and TERRORIST/
         CRIMESTOP hotlines to the Security Forces Control Center (SFCC).
         3.1.1.7. Examples of recent security incidents, scenarios from actual HELPING HAND situa-
         tions, and citing good and bad examples of responses to actual exercises conducted in the
         workcenter to get the employees attention.
     3.1.2. Written knowledge tests. The Constable will develop a test bank of questions and make
     them available to the personnel performing the training at the unit. The test bank allows tailoring
     of the tests for the workcenter being visited.
         3.1.2.1. Separate questions will be developed specifically addressing restricted area security
         and controlled area security. Develop additional questions which apply to those non-security
         personnel who do not work in restricted or controlled areas, but require security awareness
         training.
         3.1.2.2. Questions should be multiple choice or true/false. Questions should not be designed
         to trick or stump the participants. The tests should be aimed at determining the level of com-
         prehension from previous training sessions.
         3.1.2.3. Tests should be graded on the spot and immediate feedback given to the test takers.
         When completed, give an overall summary of the items missed. For highly missed areas, pro-
         vide the group with the correct information immediately. Do not let personnel leave the train-
         ing session with incorrect information.
     3.1.3. Documentation. Documentation of Phase I training will be determined by the 78 SFS/CC
     and procedures developed by the Constable. A sign-in sheet will be accomplished at each session
     (see example at Attachment 4) and a computer database used to track information. This training
     verification will be maintained for at least 1 year and the resulting numbers briefed to the Installa-
     tion Security Council (ISC) in a format determined by the 78 SFS/CC.
  3.2. Phase II, Continuation Training. As required by AFI 31-101, paragraph 7.2.3., this phase of train-
  ing is focused on detection and reporting exercises in restricted and controlled areas and continual
  awareness briefings to unit personnel. It is conducted in two distinct portions as described in the fol-
  lowing paragraphs. The Constable will work closely with unit security managers and unit training
  managers to ensure they have current training materials and tests to evaluate their personnel.
     3.2.1. Unit Responsibilities. Unit continuation training will be conducted as part of the unit’s
     ancillary training program and should be tailored to the specific workcenter duties. For instance,
     flight crew chief training would include procedures to detect, detain, and report intruders found in
     the restricted area. This training must provide as a minimum:
         3.2.1.1. Information on threats to USAF protection level resources.

           3.2.1.2. Security procedures for restricted and controlled areas (i.e. circulation and entry con-
           trol).
           3.2.1.3. Duress words and authentication procedures.
           3.2.1.4. Documentation of unit continuation training will be accomplished on a locally
           devised form (computer database is acceptable) and forwarded to the Constable annually. If
           knowledge tests are administered as part of the training, document the number tested and num-
           ber of failures. Make note of questions repeatedly missed for trend data collection. Individual
           documentation of testing results is not required.
       3.2.2. Constable Responsibilities. Constable continuation training is accomplished through unit
       visits and detection exercises.
           3.2.2.1. Unit Visits. The Constable will physically report to the unit to visit with personnel
           before and after continued awareness training to validate the effectiveness of the unit level
           training. This visit must occur at least once per year through roll call training or by briefing the
           unit at a commander’s call.
           3.2.2.2. Detection Exercises. The Constable will perform detection exercises separate from
           the units to determine the effectiveness of the unit training program in both restricted areas and
           controlled areas. The exercises are designated as Security Education and Training exercises
           (SET). See paragraph 4.

4. Security Education and Training Exercises.
    4.1. Determination of SET Guidelines. The Constable must establish complete exercise guidelines.
    The ISC will determine the number and frequency of detection exercises based on the size and number
    of restricted and controlled areas and the number of personnel regularly assigned to these areas. Doc-
    ument the local determination in the ISC minutes and adjust exercise frequency as necessary. The
    Constable will conduct sufficient exercises to develop trends. These trends will determine future exer-
    cise scenarios and is reportable to the ISC.
    4.2. Development of SET Exercises. These exercises are designed to test the security awareness of
    non-security personnel assigned to controlled and restricted areas. Specific exercises to test the secu-
    rity awareness of security forces personnel will be coordinated with the 78th SFS Standardization and
    Evaluation Section (78 SFS/SFMQ) in conjunction with standardization-evaluations and meet the
    standards established by AFI 36-2225, Security Forces Training and Standardization Evaluation Pro-
    gram. Exercise objectives must never take precedence over safety of personnel, equipment, or
    resources. Using actual perpetrators is authorized. However, exercise perpetrators WILL NOT simu-
    late any action which could be interpreted as hostile by support or security forces. Additionally, per-
    petrators will explicitly follow any and all directions given by the exercise participants unless it causes
    a potential safety hazard or would violate the law. In order to plan effective and safe exercises, the
    Constable must completely plan and execute SET exercises with a cradle-to-grave philosophy. The
    following phases should be used to develop the exercises:
       4.2.1. Planning Phase. The Constable will:
           4.2.1.1. Schedule a time and location for the exercise.
           4.2.1.2. Develop an exercise scenario with at least one stated specific objective.
ROBINSAFBI31-102 15 DECEMBER 2004                                                                         5


           4.2.1.3. Determine equipment, uniform, and perpetrator requirements.
NOTE: The use of civilians in SET exercises is highly discouraged, however, if Robins AFB considers
this as an option, coordination with the staff judge advocate and the wing safety office must be accom-
plished. Military members may be used to dress and act like civilians while performing perpetrator duties.
The Constable will design scenarios with military and civilian perpetrators.
       4.2.2. Implementation Phase. The Constable will:
           4.2.2.1. Notify control center as determined by standard operating instructions.
           4.2.2.2. Brief perpetrators on their responsibilities and safety guidelines prior to the start of
           any exercise (see Attachment 2).
           4.2.2.3. Initiate the exercise following standard authentication procedures as determined by
           the 78 SFS/CC.
       4.2.3. Execution Phase. The Constable will:
           4.2.3.1. Be positioned whereby all actions of the perpetrators/exercise participants can be
           observed.
           4.2.3.2. Control the actions as needed (step in if problems arise or safety is in question).
           4.2.3.3. Terminate the exercise when objectives are met or when it is clear that the objectives
           will not be met.
           4.2.3.4. Gather exercise participants and conduct a critique of the exercise (make every effort
           to leave the critique with positive lessons even if the exercise is graded as a failure).
           4.2.3.5. Allow participants to evaluate exercise.
       4.2.4. After Action Phase. The Constable will:
           4.2.4.1. Obtain names of participants for an exercise report.
           4.2.4.2. Notify the SFCC of exercise termination. The SFCC will record the exercise in the
           blotter.
           4.2.4.3. Debrief perpetrators, gather equipment, and release them to their workcenter.
           4.2.4.4. Compile information for formal reporting to the ISC.
   4.3. Grading. The Constable develops an exercise grading scale for use during SET exercises. This
   grading scale must be approved by the ISC and will be included in RAFBI 31-101. As a minimum, the
   Constable will assign a grade of pass or fail to each exercise conducted. More elaborate systems may
   be developed to give better insight into the outcome of the exercises. A scale with 3 or 5 levels (i.e.
   Unsatisfactory, Satisfactory, or Outstanding) may be used if adopted by the ISC.
       4.3.1. Failures. Exercise failure procedures must be developed to ensure correct lessons are
       learned from the exercises being conducted. If a unit or workcenter fails a SET exercise, a re-eval-
       uation with similar circumstances must be conducted after 30 days, but no longer than 60 days
       from the date of the failure. While it is realized that the same personnel may not be involved dur-
       ing the re-evaluation, the intent is that the exercise results and lessons learned will be shared by
       personnel throughout their organization.

    4.4. Documentation. The Constable will document all SET exercises. A formal report will be com-
    pleted for any exercise which resulted in a failure (Attachment 3). This formal report is used to notify
    the 78 SFS/CC and unit commander of the exercise participants of what occurred and the discrepan-
    cies to be addressed. The Constable will:
         4.4.1. Track and log all exercises on a locally developed exercise log.
            4.4.1.1. Annotate the time, date, and location of the exercise. Additionally, a brief summary of
            the scenario, personnel involved, and the outcome of the exercise will be included. This log
            should be similar to the Helping Hand and Covered Wagon logs maintained by the SFCC.
            4.4.1.2. Maintain the log of exercises by calendar year for a period of 1 year after closeout.

5. General.
    5.1. The Constable will brief the ISC on overall testing results and trends. The 78 SFS/CC will deter-
    mine the format for reporting this information.
    5.2. The list at Table 1. suggests the DOs and the DON’Ts of conducting constable operations. The
    list is not all-inclusive.

MEMORANDUM FOR (UNIT EVALUATED)
FROM: 78 SFS/CC
SUBJECT: Security Education and Training (SET) Exercise 00-01
1. EXERCISE SCENARIO: On 1 Jan 04, at approximately 0900 hours, one exercise unidentified perpe-
trator entered the restricted area, breaking the red line at Spot #15, without proper credentials.
2. WHAT HAPPENED: The perpetrator entered the restricted area and approached the aircraft located
on Spot #15. No security personnel or support forces were available and the aircraft hatch was left open.
The perpetrator entered the aircraft and remained there unattended for 15 minutes. Upon his departure of
the aircraft, a vehicle with several military members inside approached the perpetrator, and asked what he
was doing. After a brief conversation, the perpetrator was released and instructed where the nearest entry
control point was located.
3. WHAT SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED: The aircraft hatch should have been closed when unattended.
The support forces who approached the perpetrator should have asked to see a restricted area badge upon
initial contact. Immediately following their discovery of no credentials, they should have detained and
reported the information to the Security Forces Control Center (SFCC). If the perpetrator was non-hostile,
they could have removed the perpetrator from the area. Additional support forces should have conducted
a search of the aircraft, to include the area around the aircraft, to ensure the perpetrator did not cause dam-
age to the aircraft.
4. FOLLOW-UP ACTIONS: A similar exercise will be conducted between 30-60 days from the date of
this exercise. Remedial training on security awareness should be conducted for exercise participants. An
on-the-spot critique was performed by SSgt Christopher J. Navarro, Installation Security Constable (78
SFS/SFOS), 6-2118.
