SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Major changes
include: added AAAHC Quality of Care requirements; added both positive and negative results
for tests ordered for a specific indication; changed operating room to same day surgery
/ambulatory procedure visit (APV) values.
1. Responsibilities.
     1.1. Senior Leadership will:
        1.1.1. Promote a culture that emphasizes timely reporting of critical test results and
        values to the responsible LIP.
        1.1.2. Ensure all relevant personnel are educated on the policies and procedures
        delineated in this instruction.
        1.1.3. Ensure adherence to this instruction.
     1.2. Department Chairmen will ensure the accuracy of pager numbers on the call roster and
     other contact information for reporting critical test results or critical values.
     1.3. Providers will ensure a point of contact and pager number are indicated on each test
     ordered.
     1.4. Nursing personnel will ensure LIP contact name and pager number are noted on test
     requests.
     1.5. All staff will follow the guidelines and procedures for submitting laboratory specimens
     as noted in LSQ 44-42, Laboratory Handbook.
2. Definitions.
     2.1. Critical Result/Value. Test result that is abnormal to a degree that it may indicate a life
     threatening situation. A complete listing of critical laboratory values is located in Attachment
     2 of 59MDWI 44-136, Laboratory Program. A listing of critical diagnostic imaging values is
     located in Attachment 2 of this instruction, and a listing of critical electrocardiogram findings
     is located in Attachment 3 of this instruction.
     2.2. Critical Test. A test or exam that always requires rapid communication of results,
     whether those results are normal or abnormal.
        2.2.1. This organization has determined that STAT testing, as used in common practice,
        are not always ―critical tests.‖ Our target for truly ―critical tests‖ is no more than 1 hour
        from the time of the order to the time the results are communicated to the ordering LIP.
        However, it is not possible to distinguish between true ―critical test‖ orders and non-
        critical ―STAT‖ or ―NOW‖ orders.
     2.3. Clinically Significant. Test results/values that fall outside of normal standards as
     defined by laboratory or radiology, but the impact to the patient is not life threatening.
3. Procedures.
     3.1. Reporting critical tests and values.
59MDWI44-155 11 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                   3


     3.1.1. For the identified critical tests, the length of time between the time the test is
     ordered and the results are reported to the responsible LIP will not exceed the time
     frames noted below:
        3.1.1.1. Intraoperative Consultation – 20 minutes.
        3.1.1.2. For the identified critical tests, all results (including normal values) must be
        called to the responsible LIP as soon as the result is available. The result must be
        identified as a critical test result. If the responsible LIP or other certified/privileged
        individual is unable to take the call, a registered nurse (RN) may take the critical test
        result. Under no circumstances should results be given to unlicensed personnel (e.g.
        secretary, student, unit clerk).
        3.1.1.3. All results, the name of the provider notified, the time and date of
        notification, and ―read back‖ of the result must be documented as part of the
        laboratory or radiology result.
     3.1.2. Critical Values.
        3.1.2.1. All diagnostic tests resulted as a critical value, including those tests ordered
        for completion in a routine fashion, will be communicated to the responsible LIP
        and/or authorized designee within the following target time limits: (Note: Includes
        all other results that are determined by the Laboratorian, Radiologist, or other
        diagnostician to be critical to the patient’s subsequent treatment decision.)
            3.1.2.1.1. Lab – 60 minutes.
            3.1.2.1.2. Radiology – 60 minutes. For the diagnostic imaging tests and
            indications in Attachment 2, positive results are considered critical values. Note:
            If imaging is a repeat or follow-up, it is not considered a critical result unless
            there is a change for the worse from prior imaging.
            3.1.2.1.3. Electrocardiograms (ECG).      Critical Holter values are reported
            immediately (within 10 minutes) to cardiology staff during duty hours by the
            cardiology technician or nurse; the same reporting procedures to a LIP apply to
            primary care clinic(s) and the Urgent Care Center. The ordering provider will
            determine validity and what actions need to be taken (e.g. institute Basic Life
            Support/Advanced Cardiac Life Support procedures, transport to appropriate level
            of care).
                3.1.2.1.3.1. Once the patient is stabilized, nurse must sign/date/time the
                abnormal ECG or Holter. The notified provider must also sign, stamp, date,
                and time the ECG or Holter report at the time he/she is notified of the critical
                result.
        3.1.2.2. If the target notification time limit is exceeded because of an inability to
        contact the requesting LIP, the chain of command for the ordering provider shall be
        notified. The incident shall be documented in the Patient Safety Reporting system
        through the unit Patient Safety Monitor. The reporting unit will telephonically notify
        the Patient Safety office at 292-6161/0220/6283 the next duty day if the event occurs
        overnight or on a weekend or holiday. The Patient Safety Office will contact the
        radio communication and pager office to determine if there was a mechanical failure
4                                                         59MDWI44-155 11 FEBRUARY 2013


           with the pager. The Patient Safety Office will then contact the on-call provider’s
           electronic call roster point of contact to determine if the delay the unit experienced in
           contacting a provider was due to a provider change that was not reflected on the call
           roster.
           3.1.2.3. Notification of the responsible LIP shall be accomplished with an active
           notification system (e.g. pagers, phone) with the capacity for verbal
           acknowledgement from the individual receiving the information. The individual
           receiving the information must document the information as an Armed Forces Health
           Longitudinal Technology Application (AHLTA) note or outpatient telephone consult,
           as an entry into Essentris (Same day surgery/APV patient), or as an entry on the SF
           509, Progress Notes, before taking action on the critical test
           result/value/interpretation. In addition, the individual receiving the information will
           read back (RB) the result, obtain verification, and annotate with ―RB‖ in the patient’s
           medical document before taking action on the critical test result(s) or critical value(s)
           and/or interpretation(s) before taking action on the critical result/value/interpretation.
    3.2. Reporting Outpatient Values.
       3.2.1. During normal duty hours.
           3.2.1.1. Contact the requesting provider. If no response after 10 minutes, contact the
           on-call provider. If no response or other provider not available, notify the clinic RN
           of the results. Listing and phone numbers for on-call providers for each clinic can be
           found on the 59 MDW SharePoint Clinical Tab under ―Call Roster‖ (AMION;
           www.amion.com; each section has its own password to access the call rosters on
           AMION).
           3.2.1.2. The RN who receives the critical lab value/report or critical test result will:
               3.2.1.2.1. Immediately notify the patient’s provider.
               3.2.1.2.2. Place a telephone consult in AHLTA to the provider notified
               documenting the date, time, the critical lab value/report or critical test resu lt, the
               name of the person reporting the information, the name and time the provider
               notified.
               3.2.1.2.3. If the provider is not immediately available, the RN will notify the
               flight commander or covering provider.
       3.2.2. After normal duty hours, weekends, or holidays.
           3.2.2.1. Page the on-call clinic provider. If no response after 10 minutes, notify the
           on-call service provider.
           3.2.2.2. On-call provider will take appropriate action.
    3.3. Reporting Critical Results for Same Day Surgery/APV Values. Call the operating room
    and notify patient’s surgeon. If the surgeon is unavailable, notify the anesthesia provider or
    operating room RN responsible for the patient.
    3.4. Reporting Urgent Care Center Values. Call the ordering provider. If not available, ask
    for the Urgent Care Center physician or physician currently assigned to the patient. If not
    available, notify the Urgent Care Center RN Shift Leader with the results.
59MDWI44-155 11 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                  5


   3.5. Reporting Values/Results to Off-Base Facilities. Contact ordering provider or have
   their answering service request the provider return call as soon as possible. At no time may
   results be left with the answering service or answering machine. If no contact is made with
   the provider within 10 minutes:
      3.5.1. Notify the Wilford Hall Ambulatory Surgical Center (WHASC) pathologist on-
      call with all critical laboratory values.
      3.5.2. Notify the Diagnostic Imaging Flight Commander with all critical radiology
      results.
4. Data Monitoring, Collection, and Analysis.
   4.1. Monitoring and evaluation of the critical test and critical value process will be
   performed monthly.
   4.2. Audits must look at a minimum of the following components:
      4.2.1. For Critical Tests, the key metric for the audit is the 90% compliance for
      notification from time the test was ordered to the time the provider was notified.
      4.2.2. For Critical Values/Reports the key metric for the audit is the 90% compliance for
      notification from time the result/report was deemed critical to the time the provider was
      notified.
   4.3. Patient Safety will review and analyze selected data and report findings to the Executive
   Committee of the Medical Staff and the Performance Improvement Committee, and the
   Board of Directors on a quarterly basis.
