                                           Chapter 1

                                GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. General.
   1.1.1. This Air Force Instruction (AFI) provides policy for operating the C-17 aircraft. It is
   an original source document for many areas but, for efficacy, restates information found in
   aircraft flight manuals, flight information publications (FLIP), and other Air Force directives.
   This manual is used in concert with AFTTP 3-3.35A, C-17 Combat Aircraft Fundamentals
   (U). When guidance in this AFI conflicts with another basic/source document, that document
   takes precedence. For matters where this AFI is the source document, waiver authority is in
   accordance with (IAW) paragraph 1.4 For matters where this AFI repeats information in
   another document, follow waiver authority outlined in the basic/source document.
   1.1.2. Unit commanders and agency directors involved with or supporting C-17 operations
   shall make current copies of this AFI available to appropriate personnel. Transportation and
   Base Operations passenger manifesting agencies will maintain a current copy of this AFI.
1.2. Applicability. This AFI applies to aircrew members, support personnel, and managers
involved with employing C-17 aircraft.
1.3. Key Words Explained.
   1.3.1. "Will" and "shall" indicate a mandatory requirement.
   1.3.2. "Should" indicates a preferred, but not mandatory, method of accomplishment.
   1.3.3. "May" indicates an acceptable or suggested means of accomplishment.
   1.3.4. ―NOTE‖ indicates operating procedures, techniques, etc., considered essential to
   emphasize.
   1.3.5. ―CAUTION‖ indicates operating procedures, techniques, etc., which could result in
   damage to equipment if not carefully followed.
   1.3.6. ―WARNING‖ indicates operating procedures, techniques, etc., which could result in
   personal injury or loss of life if not carefully followed.
1.4. Deviations and Waivers. Do not deviate from policies in this AFI except when the
situation demands immediate action to ensure safety. The pilot in command (PIC) is vested with
ultimate mission authority and responsible for each course-of-action they choose to take.
   1.4.1. Deviations. The PIC shall report deviations or exceptions taken without a waiver
   through command channels to their Chief, Major Command (MAJCOM) Stan/Eval who in
   turn shall notify Chief, AMC Stan/Eval (lead command) as appropriate for follow-on action.
   1.4.2. Waivers. Unless otherwise directed, waiver authority for contents of this instruction is
   the MAJCOM/A3/DO with mission execution authority. PICs can obtain waivers to deviate
   from provisions in this AFI via MAJCOM Stan/Eval.
       1.4.2.1. Permanent waivers affect theater unique circumstances and are enduring in
       nature. List MAJCOM/A3/DO-approved permanent waivers in the MAJCOM
       supplement (see paragraph 1.5)
AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010                                                          17


       1.4.2.2. Long-term waivers affect multiple aircraft/multiple missions but are not
       permanent in nature (expire at a specific date/time). MAJCOM Stan/Eval shall send HQ
       AMC Stan/Eval (lead command) copies of MAJCOM/A3/DO-approved long-term
       waivers.
       1.4.2.3. Short-notice waivers are for specific missions in execution. PICs shall use the
       Waiver Protocol procedure in Chapter 4 to secure MAJCOM/A3/DO approval for short-
       notice waivers.
       1.4.2.4. (Added-3WG) . Waiver authority for this supplement is the OG/CC, unless
       stated otherwise. The pilot in command (PIC) is responsible for the initiation of waiver
       requests. PICs requesting a waiver to the parent AFI, or this supplement, prior to mission
       execution will forward their request to 3 OG/OGV or 517 AS/CCV, as appropriate.
       Upon concurrence, waivers will be routed to the appropriate waiver authority. Waiver
       requests during execution phase will be routed through appropriate command and control
       (C2) channels. Deviations to this supplement will be reported to 3 OG/OGV.

                                            Chapter 2

                                 COMMAND AND CONTROL

2.1. General. The Mobility Air Forces (MAF) command and control (C2) network consists of
the following C2 centers: 18th Air Force Tanker Airlift Control Center (18 AF TACC) Global
Cell, Pacific Air Forces (PACAF) or United States Air Forces Europe (USAFE) Air Mobility
Operation Control Centers (AMOCCs), Air National Guard (ANG) Readiness Center, Air Force
Reserve Command (AFRC) Command Center, theater Air Operations and Space Centers
(AOCs), Air Mobility Division (AMD), Joint Operational Support Airlift Center (JOSAC), Unit
Command Posts, Air Mobility Control Centers (AMCCs), Contingency Response Groups
(CRG), and Special Tactics Teams (STTs). C2 centers are action agents for the MAF commander
with execution authority (operational control) over mobility missions/forces.
2.2. Execution Authority. Headquarters commanders with command authority over MAF
resources hold execution authority for directed missions. Commanders with execution authority
formulate plans, allocate assets, and approve missions through a local command post or C2
element. OG/CCs serve as execution authority for local training missions. The PIC will execute
missions operating outside normal communication channels (use last known mission orders or
best course of action).
   2.2.1. Off-Station Trainer (OST). Refer to AMCI 11-208, Tanker/Airlift Operations, for
   procedures and requirements governing OSTs
       2.2.1.1. AFRC Current Operations (AFRC/DOOM) is approval authority for AFRC Unit
       Equipped (UE) OSTs.
2.3. Pilot in Command (PIC) Responsibility and Authority. SQ/CCs shall designate an
aircraft commander (AC), instructor pilot (IP), or evaluator pilot (EP) as the PIC for all flights on
a flight authorization form, IAW AFI 11-401, Aviation Management, and applicable
supplements. An unqualified or non-mission ready pilot may not be designated as PIC. PICs are:
   2.3.1. In command of all persons aboard the aircraft.
   2.3.2. Vested with authority to accomplish the assigned mission. The PIC shall only fly
   events authorized in the mission tasking unless in the PIC‘s judgment an emergency
   condition demands otherwise. Only fly unscheduled training events (for example, air
   refueling (A/R) or transition training) after obtaining approval of the execution authority.
   2.3.3. The final mission authority and will make decisions not assigned to higher authority.
   2.3.4. The final authority for requesting or accepting aircrew or mission waivers.
   2.3.5. Responsible for relaying mission status (at least daily) to C2 agents.
   2.3.6. Responsible for interaction between aircrew members and mission support personnel
   and will establish a point-of-contact (POC) with the appropriate C2 agent prior to entering
   crew rest. Local C2 agents are responsible for coordinating mission support requirements on
   the PIC‘s behalf.
   2.3.7. Responsible for the welfare of aircrew members, Mission Essential Ground Personnel
   (MEGP), passengers, and the safe accomplishment of the mission.
 20                                               AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010


2.4. Mission Clearance Decision. The execution authority and PIC shall make the mission
clearance decision. In all cases, final responsibility for the safe conduct of the mission rests with
the PIC. If a PIC elects to delay a mission, that mission will not depart until the conditions that
generated the decision to delay improve or are resolved. Further, no execution authority may task
another PIC to take the same mission under the same conditions.
   2.4.1. Only re-route or divert a mission when authorized by the execution authority, to
   resolve an emergency, or if required by en route or terminal weather conditions.
       2.4.1.1. (Added-3WG) . Divert Coordination. The PIC will coordinate all divert
       information with 3 WG Command Post (CP) (for local training missions and joint
       airborne/air transportability training (JA/ATT) and/or 613 Airline Operational Control
       (AOC)/air mobility division (AMD) or tanker airlift control center (TACC) (operational
       missions, exercises)) as soon as conditions permit.
   2.4.2. The agent that directed the re-route or divert shall ensure the aircraft is capable of
   executing departure, en route, and destination arrival procedures.
   2.4.3. The PIC will notify the appropriate C2 agent of any aircraft or aircrew limitation that
   may preclude re-route or divert.
   2.4.4. When a C2 agent directs a PIC to fly to an alternate airfield, the agent will ensure
   existing and forecast weather for the alternate, Notices to Airmen (NOTAMs), and airfield
   information from the Global Decision Support System (GDSS)/GDSS2)/Airfield Suitability
   and Restrictions Report (ASRR) is suitable. If the alternate becomes unsuitable while en
   route, the PIC will coordinate with the C2 agent for other suitable alternates. The PIC is final
   authority for accepting a suitable alternate. A C2 agent will alert customs and all appropriate
   ground service agencies to prepare for arrival.
2.5. Operational C2 Reporting.
   2.5.1. Stations With MAF C2 Agency. Local MAF C2 agents will enter mission data
   (arrival, departure, and advisory messages) in the MAF C2 system.
   2.5.2. Stations without MAF C2. Transmit mission data to the controlling C2 agency by any
   means available (i.e., DSN, HF, AERO-I, Airline Operational Control (AOC)). HF Radio is
   the primary method of communication for routine mission information. For critical C2
   communications, i.e. aircraft waiver request, maintenance delay, etc., voice communications
   are the primary method.
   2.5.3. En route Reporting.
       2.5.3.1. Make the following en route calls to TACC:
           2.5.3.1.1. Airborne call when departing from a location without an AMC presence.
           2.5.3.1.2. Maintenance call whenever aircraft alpha status changes to code 3.
           2.5.3.1.3. On aeromedical evacuation missions, no later than 1 hour prior to landing,
           to update arrival time.
       2.5.3.2. CONUS. Periodic ―ops normal‖ calls/transmissions are not required; however,
       the controlling C2 agency may increase reporting requirements.
AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010                                                          21


     2.5.3.3. OCONUS. MAJCOM C2 agencies will specify increased reporting procedures
     through a communications plan in the OPLAN, OPORD, FRAG, Mission Directive, or
     FLIP. Aircrews will maintain listening watch in accordance with the communications
     plan within aircraft equipment capabilities (e.g. HF-Automatic Link Establishment (HF-
     ALE), AOC).
  2.5.4. Aircraft Status/Maintenance Discrepancy Reporting. PICs shall report aircraft system
  malfunctions that traditionally require extensive trouble shooting as soon as feasible. Contact
  arrival C2 agency if available, otherwise contact MAJCOM C2 for relay.
  2.5.5. Not Used.
     2.5.5.1. (Added-3WG) . Communication with 3 WG/CP (―Arctic Warrior‖). The 3
     WG/CP is the single C2 point of contact (POC) for initial Elmendorf AFB C-17
     departures and final arrivals. (There is also an air mobility control center (AMCC), call
     sign ―Denali,‖ for transient air mobility command (AMC) aircraft and transient
     Elmendorf aircrew on TACC managed missions). Crews will promptly notify the CP of
     any problems that require assistance to preclude a delay in the launch sequence.
     2.5.5.2. (Added-3WG) . Prior to departure include aircraft call sign and tail number
     (unless mission directive or communication security (COMSEC) requirements dictate
     otherwise) when reporting maintenance problems to the CP. This assists coordination
     with proper agencies.
     2.5.5.3. (Added-3WG) . Tanker Status:
         2.5.5.3.1. (Added-3WG) . Local Training Missions. Aircraft commanders will
         verify tanker status prior to departure via the CP. Unless it‘s known the tanker has
         cancelled, proceed to the rendezvous control point rendezvous control point (RVCP)
         and attempt to contact the Elmendorf CP for tanker status updates.
     2.5.5.4. (Added-3WG) . During execution, coordinate with 3 WG/CP for itinerary
     changes, early departure, and flight time extension for any training flight.
     2.5.5.5. (Added-3WG) . A PIC who wishes to cancel a local training sortie will contact
     517 AS TOP 3 with the reason for the request and impact of lost training. The PIC must
     ensure mission cancellation messages are relayed to the 3 WG/CP.
         2.5.5.5.1. (Added-3WG) . Once mission cancellations are approved, the 3 WG/CP
         will notify all appropriate agencies.
  2.5.6. ―Thirty Minute‖ Out Call. Transmit a UHF or VHF arrival advisory to the destination
  C2 agency approximately 30 minutes prior to arrival. Provide Estimated Time in Blocks
  (ETB).
     2.5.6.1. (Added-3WG) . Relay the aircraft status (A1, A2, A3). When returning from a
     mission, transmit write-ups from previous sorties.            Identify any maintenance
     discrepancies that may require an engine run (for example, engine shut off valve (SOV)).
     This will help in determining aircraft parking. In such instances, verify clearance to shut
     down engines with Maintenance prior to doing so.
  2.5.7. Integrated Flight Management (IFM) Sorties. On IFM sorties the flight managers
  (FM) will be the C2 conduit for aircrews. They will provide aircrews with flight planning,
22                                             AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010


  flight following, flight support and act as a resource to aircrews as they perform their
  missions. For critical C2 communications, voice communications (HF, DSN, etc.) are the
  primary method.
     2.5.7.1. Position Reporting on IFM Missions. IFM missions transiting oceanic flight
     information regions (FIRs) need to add the phrase ―Pass to Hilda‖ to ATC position
     reports. Crews may also use the ARINC frequencies listed in the aircrew flimsy for C2
     phone patch requirements. Use ARINC phone patch only after exhausting normal
     communication methods. Airline Operational Control (AOC) will be the primary means
     of routine communications between FMs and aircrew, on AOC equipped aircraft. While
     using AOC, crews will not have to request ATC pass position reports via "Pass to Hilda"
     procedures.
  2.5.8. High Frequency (HF) Communications. HF is the primary means of voice access to
  the worldwide C2 network. When SELCAL is primary ATC, use AERO-I and/or AOC to
  monitor C2, in lieu of ALE. Ensure the other HF radio is not in ALE mode to preclude the
  automatic link (ALE) feature from overriding ATC messages.
  2.5.9. Airline Operational Control (AOC). AOC is not secure means of communication.
  Crews will exercise sound information assurance techniques, such as confirming major
  mission changes directed by TACC via AOC. Do not pass classified information via AOC.
  2.5.10. The AERO-I satellite voice system is provided as an alternative means of
  communication between the aircraft and a number of C2 agencies and ATC. The system will
  be used only for non-secure in-flight communications between aircrews and C2 organizations
  and between aircrews and oceanic air traffic controllers. Due to the high cost of using the
  system, aircrews should attempt communications by other means (HF, UHF, ALE, etc.) for
  C2 communications before using the AERO-I system. AERO-I voice is a backup for the
  Controller Pilot Data Link Communications (CPDLC), Airline Operational Control (AOC)
  and C2 communications. Certain C2 and ATC agencies have the capability to call the aircraft
  using the AERO-I. AERO-I is for official use only.
     2.5.10.1. The AERO-I communications software loaded on the aircraft automatically
     logs onto a specific Ground Earth Station (GES), based on aircraft location, and which
     GES is under contract to provide service. Manually selecting a different GES will result
     in a connection through a non-contract carrier, resulting in a much higher cost. Aircrews
     will only manually select a different GES when all other avenues of communication have
     failed, and when essential for mission completion.
  2.5.11. DV Messages. Airborne unclassified messages originated by DV passengers may be
  transmitted at the discretion of the PIC.
  2.5.12. (Added-3WG) . Incident Reporting. In addition to notifying tanker airlift control
  center (TACC)/AMD and 3 WG/CP, crews should report any unusual circumstances to
  home station leadership (on-call 24 hours a day through 3 WG/CP). Such incidences may
  include, but are not limited to flare launches, laser activity, damage to aircraft or airport,
  significant crew issues, any reportable incident (for example, Safety, airdrop malfunctions,
  cargo loading mishaps, Intel, police, and so forth), and media exposure. When operating out
  of a deployed location with deployed leadership, crews should report mishap reports
AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010                                                           23


   (MISREP) items (for example, flare launches) to the deployed leadership. When in doubt,
   keep home station leadership informed.
2.6. Mission Commander (MC).
   2.6.1. Unit commanders shall designate an MC when more than two aircraft are assembled
   to perform missions away from home station. Unit commanders should consider appointing a
   MC for special, high-visibility missions (i.e. CAPSTONE, DV2, etc.). The MC has overall
   responsibility and is the final authority for decisions that impact mission execution. The MC
   shall properly coordinate mission details. For flight-managed sorties, MC shall coordinate
   any special mission planning requirements with the IFM mission allocator not later than 24
   hours prior to mission execution.
       2.6.1.1. For MAJCOM-tasked missions, MAJCOM/A3/DO will coordinate and
       designate a lead planning agency when more than one unit is involved in an A/R, airdrop,
       or tactical airland operation. For theater airlift missions with more than one airlift unit
       involved, the theater AOC shall designate a central planning agency responsible for
       coordinating the entire mission with all involved agencies. The OG/CC for the lead
       planning agency will designate an MC. The MC will be a rated (normally field grade)
       officer qualified in the type mission.
       2.6.1.2. The MC will ensure all collocated aircrew members attend required briefings.
       2.6.1.3. When non-collocated, the MC (in conjunction with the lead planning agency)
       will ensure non-collocated aircrew members receive applicable information, to include
       rendezvous, formation, abort, and recovery procedures. The MC will provide controlling
       agency and all non-collocated PICs anticipated delays or mission changes.

                                            Chapter 3

                       AIRCREW COMPLEMENT/MANAGEMENT

3.1. General. This chapter provides guiding principles to form/manage mobility aircrews.
Commanders at all levels shall follow this policy to form aircrews and to develop aircrew-related
work/rest schedules that optimize efficiency of mobility forces engaged in worldwide operations.
3.2. Aircrew Complement. SQ/CCs shall form aircrews based on fragmentation order/mission
directive, Crew Duty Time (CDT) and Flight Duty Period (FDP) requirements, aircrew member
qualifications, and other constraints to safely accomplish the mission tasking (See Table 3.1
below). SQ/CCs shall base the aircrew complement for specialized missions on guiding
principles in chapters covering those missions.
   3.2.1. The minimum aircrew member complement for local flights is an aircraft commander,
   pilot/ copilot, and loadmaster. When a mission requires more than one aircrew member at a
   position, the SQ/CC will determine whether an instructor and student meet mission
   requirements.
   3.2.2. SQ/CCs shall form augmented aircrews for missions planned to take longer than a
   basic FDP. Augmenting aircrew members must be current, qualified, and Mission Ready
   (MR) IAW AFI 11-2C-17, Vol 1. SQ/CC shall augment an aircrew for the full Flight Duty
   Period (FDP). The MAJCOM/A3/DO may augment aircrews while the mission is underway.
   3.2.3. NVG Aircrew Compliment. Normally, an NVG crew will consist of an NVG qualified
   crew-member in each of the primary crew positions. However, the pilots may use NVGs
   even if the loadmaster(s) on the crew is not NVG qualified.

Table 3.1. Aircrew Complement.
                        Crew Complement
Crew Position           Basic       Augmented Tactical (Not Used)
Aircraft Commander 1 (1,8)          1 (3,8)        *
Pilot/Copilot           1           2 (2)          *
Loadmaster              1 (4,5,7) 2 (4,6,7)        *
NOTES:
1. Air refueling and tactical events will be accomplished within the first 14 hours of the flight
duty period.
2. One must be first pilot qualified. Pilots who have graduated from the ACIQ course may
augment the crew in lieu of a first pilot. Pilots who have graduated from the PIQ course, (when
approved by the Sq/CC) may act as the augmenting crewmember.
3. All A/R and tactical events will be accomplished within the first 18 hours of the flight duty
period. Two aircraft commanders are required if A/R is accomplished after 14 hours flight duty
period. Intent is to manage rest cycles to have one AC accomplish any A/R prior to the 14-hour
point, and the second AC accomplishes the A/R past the 14 hour point. The second aircraft
commander fulfills the requirement for an additional pilot/copilot. NOTE: A graduate of C-17
ACIQ, ACAL, or PCO, who has not yet been certified as an AC may serve as the augmenting
AC, and perform the A/R as long as they are current and qualified.

4. Two loadmasters or one loadmaster and another C-17 qualified crewmember are required if
more than 40 passengers are scheduled to be carried. Both crewmembers must remain in the
cargo compartment, one forward and one aft for takeoffs and landings.
5. One loadmaster and another qualified crewmember/physiological technician are required in
the cargo compartment on any mission segment where cabin altitude exceeds 13,000 feet MSL.
6. For augmented airdrop missions, one loadmaster must be airdrop qualified; the other
loadmaster may be airland qualified.
7. Two loadmasters are required for dual-row airdrop missions. Both loadmasters shall be
qualified in the specific mission.
8. For formation airdrop, the following lead crew requirements apply.
a. Single-element formations. When the element consists of three aircraft, a lead crew is required
in the formation (any position). Two ship elements do not require a lead qualified crew.
b. Multiple-element formations. A lead qualified crew is required in the lead, deputy lead and
element lead positions. If deputy lead or an element lead abort after station time, any crew can
assume their position with the concurrence of the mission commander. Any crew can fly the last
ship of a formation even if it is an element lead position.
3.3. Aircrew Member Qualification. An aircrew member will be qualified or in qualification
training to perform duties as a primary aircrew member.
   3.3.1. Senior leaders who complete a Senior Staff Qualification course (restricted AF IMT 8)
   or orientation for a Senior Staff Familiarization flight may occupy a primary crew position
   when under direct instructor supervision.
   3.3.2. Pilots who complete a Senior Staff Course will log ―FP‖ for Flight Authorization Duty
   Code on the AFTO IMT 781, ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document.
   3.3.3. Pilots who complete a Senior Staff Familiarization flight will log ―OP‖ for Flight
   Authorization Duty Code on the AFTO IMT 781, ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data
   Document.
3.4. Pilots. An instructor pilot (IP) must supervise non-current or unqualified pilots regaining
currency or qualification (direct IP supervision during critical phases of flight).
   3.4.1. SQ/CCs shall designate an AC as Pilot in Command (PIC) and form aircrews with a
   sufficient number of pilots to accomplish the mission. The PIC shall be qualified to perform
   duties as a primary aircrew member.
   3.4.2. SQ/CCs will designate those additional pilots authorized to perform PIC duties. The
   PIC shall brief the aircrew on the plan to transfer PIC duties.
   3.4.3. Missions With Passengers. Two current and qualified pilots (AF IMT 8, Certificate of
   Aircrew Qualification for position) will occupy pilot seats with passengers on board.
       3.4.3.1. A non-current but qualified pilot may fly with passengers on board if under
       direct IP supervision.
3.5. Not Used.
3.6. Loadmasters. A non-current or unqualified loadmaster may serve as a primary aircrew
member on any mission when supervised by a qualified instructor or flight examiner (direct
supervision for critical phases of flight).
AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010                                                         27


3.7. Aircrew Management. SQ/CCs and en route C2 agents shall ensure work/rest cycles
permit an air-crew adequate time to safely accomplish mission duties and personal time for rest.
   3.7.1. Flight Duty Period (FDP). FDP is the period of time starting at mission report time
   and ending immediately after the aircrew completes the final engine shutdown of the day.
   SQ/CCs shall form air-crews based on worst-case FDP in the mission directive. Once en
   route, the mission directive or C2 agent will inform the PIC of expected FDP at show time.
   Reduce FDP when the autopilot fails after departure IAW information below. PICs shall
   work with C2 agents to determine the best course of action to minimize mission impact (may
   require divert for maintenance). In this case, the PIC will contact C2 agencies, coordinate
   intentions, and comply with the FDP limitations.
       3.7.1.1. Basic Crew FDP. The maximum FDP for a basic aircrew is 16+00 hours (12+00
       hours when the autopilot is inoperative). Once an aircrew begins a basic FDP, only
       MAJCOM/A3/DO may extend to augmented day regardless of aircrew composition
       (MAJCOM/A3/DO shall augment basic crew to extend FDP).
           3.7.1.1.1. When extended en route ground times, non-optimum routing/winds,
           weather delays or other extenuating circumstances will increase a basic to an
           augmented FDP, a PIC with an augmented crew may accept an augmented FDP as
           long as:
              3.7.1.1.1.1. The C2 agent or PIC discovers the extenuating circumstances before
              the first takeoff of the day.
              3.7.1.1.1.2. The PIC verifies all augmenting aircrew members can get adequate
              rest en route.
           3.7.1.1.2. A PIC with a basic crew may seek MAJCOM/A3/DO (mission execution
           authority) approval to extend the FDP as much as 2 hours to complete a scheduled
           mission. Only use this provision to recover from unscheduled/unplanned en route
           delays. C2 agents shall not ask a PIC to exercise this option.
       3.7.1.2. Augmented Crew FDP. Maximum FDP for an augmented aircrew is 24+00
       hours (16+00 hours when the autopilot is inoperative). SQ/CC need only augment the
       pilot portion of the air-crew when the autopilot is inoperative.
           3.7.1.2.1. SQ/CC will augment an aircrew when FDP exceeds 16+00 hours and the
           mission profile will allow augmenting aircrew members adequate time to rest en
           route. As a minimum, the mission profile must provide the following:
              3.7.1.2.1.1. No more than 3 intermediate stops are authorized after 14+00 hours
              of FDP (each A/R shall count as an intermediate stop).
              3.7.1.2.1.2. Mission profile shall include at least one 6+00 hour leg or two 4+00
              hour legs.
              3.7.1.2.1.3. The PIC shall validate planned leg times based on actual conditions,
              and the PIC may swap an extended ground time (4+00 hours) for a mission leg
              when conditions afford aircrew members a chance for rest.
       3.7.1.3. Maximum FDP for nuclear airlift missions IAW AFI 11-299, Nuclear Airlift
       Operations (FOUO).
28                                           AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010


     3.7.1.4. Flight examiners administering evaluations will not exceed an augmented FDP.
     3.7.1.5. Training FDP.
         3.7.1.5.1. Maximum FDP for training, Joint Airborne/Air Transportability Training
         (JA/ ATT), Functional Check Flight (FCF) and Acceptance Check Flight (ACFs)
         missions is 16+00 hours (12+00 hours when the autopilot is inoperative). Conduct the
         mission as follows:
         3.7.1.5.2. Complete all mission-related events (i.e., FCF/ACF checks, transition
         events, A/R or tactical events) during the first 12+00 hours of the FDP.
            3.7.1.5.2.1. ANG and AFRC crews may perform mission-related events on local
            training missions provided their time from start of duty does not exceed 16 hours
            and actual flight duty does not exceed 12 hours.
                3.7.1.5.2.1.1. Crew duty time (CDT) and FDP include both military duty and
                civilian work. CDT and FDP begin when an individual reports for their first
                duty period (military or civilian).
         3.7.1.5.3. Crews may fly/deposition to home station or a deployed staging base
         following training (do not exceed 12+00 hours when the autopilot is inoperative).
  3.7.2. Crew Duty Time (CDT). CDT is that period of time an aircrew may perform
  combined ground/ flight duties. Plan the mission so aircrew members may complete post-
  mission duties within maximum CDT. An aircrew member may perform mission-related
  duties for other missions when approved by member‘s home station SQ/CC or equivalent.
  Maximum CDT for a basic aircrew is 18+00 hours and 24+45 hours for an augmented
  aircrew.
  3.7.3. Except as outlined below, CDT/FDP begins 1+00 hour after aircrew alert notification.
  SQ/CC or equivalent may task aircrew members to perform other duties before they begin
  flight-related duties or MAJCOM/A3/DO may authorize a C2 agent to alert an aircrew
  member early: begin CDT/FDP when the first aircrew member reports for those duties.
     3.7.3.1. For Self-alerts, the PIC shall coordinate early individual/crew mission report
     times with C2 agents. Begin CDT/FDP when the first aircrew member reports for duty.
     3.7.3.2. CDT/FDP Extensions. See AFI 11-202V3, General Flight Rules.
  3.7.4. Deadhead Time. MAF aircrew members may deadhead for the purpose of positioning
  or de-positioning to perform a mobility mission or mission support function. Crewmembers
  may deadhead for a maximum of 24 hours. OG/CC or equivalent may approve crewmembers
  to deadhead in excess of 24 hours.
     3.7.4.1. Current/qualified aircrew members may perform primary aircrew duties after
     flying in deadhead status provided they do not exceed a basic FDP (FDP starts at report
     time for deadhead flight).
     3.7.4.2. Aircrew members may deadhead after performing primary crew duties, for a
     maximum of 24 hours from the time the crewmember‘s FDP began.
AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010                                                         29


   3.7.5. Aircrew Member Support of Aircraft Generation Activities (Pre-flight, cargo up-/off-
   load, start, and taxi aircraft). Crew rest is required IAW AFI 11-202V3, chapter 9. The duty
   day begins when the aircrew member reports for official duties.
3.8. Scheduling Restrictions. In accordance with chapter 9 of AFI 11-202V3, General Flight
Rules . In addition, SQ/CCs shall not schedule an aircrew member to fly, nor will an aircrew
member perform air-crew duties in violation of the following. (PICs shall not violate any of the
following restrictions with an early takeoff.)
   3.8.1. When the flight will exceed maximum flying time limitations of AFI 11-202V3.
   3.8.2. Within 12 hours of consuming alcoholic beverages (based on scheduled takeoff, or
   ALFA standby force legal for alert time, or earliest show time from BRAVO alert) or while
   under the influence of alcohol.
   3.8.3. When using nasal sprays to treat symptoms of head congestion existing before flight.
   An air-crew member may use oxymetazoline or phenylephrine nasal sprays as ―get-me-
   downs‖ following an unexpected ear or sinus block during flight.
3.9. Counter-Fatigue Management Program.
   3.9.1. Aircrew may use medications with prior approval (on a voluntary basis following
   ground testing) that enhance natural rest during off-cycle crew rest periods. This section
   provides AMC/A3 guidance for the use of no-go pills (prescription medications) that help
   aircrew initiate and maintain restful sleep during off-cycle (desynchronosis) crew rest
   periods. Fliers shall not use no-go pills in flight.
   3.9.2. It is USAF policy that aircrew shall never use no-go pills as a first choice counter-
   fatigue management tool.
   3.9.3. Responsibility for counter-fatigue management of aircrew medicinal products rests
   with the home station Flight Surgeon (FS), OG/CC (may delegate to but no lower than
   squadron commander), and with each individual aircrew member. During extended
   deployments, aircrew members will only obtain no-go pills from a deployed USAF flight
   surgeon. The deployed flight surgeon shall consult with the home unit medical team prior to
   dispensing no-go pills to deployed fliers.
   3.9.4. Unit Operational Risk Management (ORM) programs shall include use of no-go
   medication with OG/CC and FS oversight. A basic counter-fatigue ORM model is available
   for mission planners, OG/CC, crew, and FS on the AMC/A37V website.
   3.9.5. Home station or deployed FS trained using the AMC/SG-approved (lead command)
   counter fatigue program is the point of contact for no-go prescription. Upon request, the FS
   will advise/assist the local OG/CC to identify missions that may impair crew rest caused by
   duty day length, departure and arrival times, and other mission timelines.
   3.9.6. Aircrew members on Personnel Reliability Program (PRP) status will follow PRP
   notification procedures if prescribed no-go Pills.
   3.9.7. The OG/CC shall establish a system to inform the FS when missions fall into any of
   the following categories (may cause sleep disruptions and are therefore candidates for no-go
   medications):
       3.9.7.1. Home station night launch missions greater than four hours duration.
 30                                             AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010


      3.9.7.2. Crew rest facilities lacking an optimal sleeping environment (quiet, cooled, and
      darkened).
      3.9.7.3. Off-station missions that are 4 or more time zones from home station.
      3.9.7.4. Rotating schedules (stair-stepped flying schedules) with greater then 6-hour
      flight time duration.
      3.9.7.5. Missions that run consistently near a 14-hour (or greater) duty day.
   3.9.8. SQ/CC will not schedule crewmembers to fly or perform crew duties within 12 hours
   of consuming no-go Pills (consider DNIF). EXCEPTION: commanders may reduce the 12-
   hour timeline after consult with a flight surgeon to confirm prescribed no-go pills have short
   duration effect [6 hours for ambien (zolpidem) and 4 hours for sonata (zaleplon)]. In no case
   will crewmembers consume a no-go pill on a timeline where they would be under the effect
   of the medication while they perform aircrew duties (use mission report or legal for alert time
   to determine latest time to take no-go medication).
   3.9.9. Aircrew member‘s responsibilities:
      3.9.9.1. Aircrew members will complete ground testing for no-go pills and receive flight
      surgeon clearance prior to using no-go pills in the operational environment.
      3.9.9.2. Aircrew members shall not operate equipment within 12-hours after consuming
      a no-go pill. EXCEPTION: Commanders may reduce the 12-hour timeline after consult
      with a flight surgeon to confirm prescribed no-go pills have short duration effect. In no
      case will crew members consume no-go pills on a timeline where they would be under
      the effect of the medication while they operate equipment.
      3.9.9.3. Aircrew members shall not take no-go-pills within 12 hours of consuming
      alcohol.
      3.9.9.4. Aircrew will inform the FS of any other medications (including nutritional
      supplements and over the counter medications) they are taking so the FS can evaluate
      potential interactions.
      3.9.9.5. Limit use of restoril and ambien to a maximum of seven consecutive days and no
      more than 20 days in a 60-day period.
      3.9.9.6. Limit use of sonata to a maximum of 10 consecutive days and no more than 28
      days in a 60-day period.
3.10. Crew Rest/En route Ground Time. OG/CCs shall establish procedures to place
crewmembers in crew rest. MAJCOM/A3/DO may waive any portion of the crew rest period or
ground time as needed to meet mission tasking.
   3.10.1. Home-Station Pre-Departure Crew Rest. For missions that will keep aircrew
   members off station 16+00 or more hours, leaders shall enter primary and deadhead aircrew
   members into pre-departure crew rest 24 hours before the legal for alert time. Aircrew
   members may perform limited non-flying duties like mission planning during the first 12
   hours of pre-departure crew rest. OG/CCs may waive any portion of the first 12 hours of pre-
   departure crew rest. However, leaders shall not manifest deadhead aircrew members as
   passengers to deny pre-departure crew rest. EXCEPTION: AFRC, ANG, and AETC in
   accordance with AFI 11-202V3 and appropriate supplement.
AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010                                                        31


  3.10.2. Off-station/En route Crew Rest. The minimum en route crew rest period is 12 hours
  before legal for alert or scheduled report time when self-alerting. This provides aircrews at
  least 8+00 hours to sleep plus 4+00 hours to travel, relax, and dine.
     3.10.2.1. Except during emergencies or as authorized by MAJCOM/A3/DO, C2 agents
     shall not disturb an aircrew member in crew rest. When necessary to interrupt aircrew
     members‘ crew rest period, re-enter that aircrew in a subsequent minimum 12 hour crew
     rest period after they complete official duties.
     3.10.2.2. Do not enter aircrew members into crew rest until they complete official post-
     flight duties. Those duties may include, but are not limited to, refueling, cargo on-/off-
     load, aircrew arming, minor maintenance, or mission debriefing.
  3.10.3. Off-station/En route Ground Time. Mobility planners normally provide aircrews
  16+30 hours (nuclear airlift missions will be IAW AFI 11-299 (FOUO)) ground time
  between engine shutdown and subsequent takeoff.
     3.10.3.1. Missions planners, PICs, or C2 agents may modify ground time as follows:
         3.10.3.1.1. In the interest of safety.
         3.10.3.1.2. To start (mission reporting time) no earlier than 12 hours from the time
         the aircrew entered crew rest. Before reducing ground time, PICs will consider time
         to complete mission planning, cargo on-/off-load, and non-standard mission related
         duties. C2 agents will not ask PICs to accept less than 16+30 ground times.
     3.10.3.2. Mobility planners should construct mission itineraries with en route ground
     times longer than 16+30 hours to afford aircrew members opportunities to recover from
     the cumulative affects of fatigue caused by flying on several consecutive days or due to
     transiting several time zones. If practical, make the en route ground time 36 hours
     (maximum) after three consecutive near maximum FDPs.
  3.10.4. Crew Enhancement Crew Rest (CECR). CECR is not an alternative to a safety-of-
  flight delay but provides PICs a means to minimize the adverse effects of a crew alert and
  report period outside normal duty time. CECR periods should be of minimum duration and
  are normally used during de-positioning legs. Tasking authorities shall approve requests to
  delay alert time to normalize the work-rest cycle or increase messing options when mission
  allows. When requests are disapproved, the C2 agent will inform the PIC of the reason for
  disapproval.
  3.10.5. Post-Mission Crew Rest (PMCR) SQ/CCs shall give aircrew members returning to
  home base sufficient time to recover from cumulative effects of the mission and tend to
  personal needs. PMCR begins upon mission termination. (N/A for AFRC, ANG and AETC).
     3.10.5.1. For missions that kept an aircrew off station 16 or more hours, the SQ/CC shall
     provide 1 hour (up to 96+00 hours) PMCR for each 3 hours off-station. Do not enter
     these aircrew members in pre-departure crew rest until the PMCR period expires.
     3.10.5.2. PMCR is not applicable to continuing missions and MAJCOM/A3/DO may
     suspend PMCR during contingency operations.
     3.10.5.3. OG/CCs (or equivalents) are PMCR waiver authority.
 32                                             AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010


   3.10.6. Flying Crew Chief (FCC) Work/Rest Plan. While on Temporary Duty (TDY), the
   deployed FCC or MEGP maintenance technician shall report to the PIC. In conjunction with
   en route/transient maintenance supervisor, the PIC will determine how long the crew chief
   can safely perform aircraft maintenance duties. The PIC shall ensure the FCC has sufficient
   time in each 24-hour period to get 8 hours of uninterrupted rest. See AFI 21-101, Aerospace
   Equipment Maintenance Management, for detailed guidance.
       3.10.6.1. (Added-3WG) . Flying Crew Chiefs will not perform maintenance duties in-
       flight.
   3.10.7. The lead USAF component will publish MAJCOM/A3/DO-approved crew rest
   criteria in the Exercise or Contingency Operation Order (OPORD), Operation Plan (OPLAN)
   or Concept of Operations (CONOPs).
   3.10.8. The Prime Knight program streamlines the process of getting aircrews from aircraft
   parking ramp into lodging/crew rest. It is only successful when billeting agents receive
   accurate aircrew/mission information in a timely manner.
       3.10.8.1. C2 Agent Responsibilities. A MAJCOM C2 agent will forward information on
       the departing aircrew‘s orders to a point of contact (POC) for the next crew rest
       location‘s Prime Knight function.
       3.10.8.2. PIC Responsibilities. If departing from a location with a C2 agency, ensure a
       C2 agent has accurate aircrew/mission information to forward to the next Prime Knight
       POC. If departing from a facility without a C2 agency, the PIC will call the next crew rest
       location Prime Knight POC to pass aircrew/mission information.
       3.10.8.3. SQ/CC or designated authenticating official shall ensure TDY/Flight orders
       clearly indicate the unit fund cite so that the PIC may make Prime Knight reservations in
       advance. Without a unit fund cite on the TDY/Flight orders, the PIC must make advance
       reservations using a government travel card to participate in the Prime Knight program.
3.11. Alerting Procedures. MAJCOM C2 agents shall establish a legal for alert time with the
PIC and when appropriate, the Medical Crew Director (MCD) of Aeromedical Evacuation (AE)
crews. Whenever possible, C2 agents will inform PICs and MCDs of aircraft status, expected
patient up load time, and other pertinent mission details that will streamline mission launch.
   3.11.1. Aircrew alert time is normally 3+45 hours (4+15 for airdrop missions) before
   scheduled takeoff time (allows 1+00 hour for reporting and 2+45 hours (3+15 for airdrop
   missions) for mission preparation). OG/CCs may establish alert procedures for local training
   missions.
       3.11.1.1. For missions with more than minimum ground time, the PIC may arrange an
       alert time that provides additional preparation time to accomplish the mission. The PIC
       may also accept alerting with reduced preparation time when the mission allows. In all
       cases, the PIC shall coordinate changes to standard alerting times with the appropriate C2
       agency.
       3.11.1.2. With PIC agreement and when cargo load warrants (i.e. outsized and Technical
       Order (TO) 1C-17A-1- 9 section VI cargo), C2 agents may alert loadmasters up to 2
       hours before normal alert time. When early alerting is warranted, the PIC and C2 agent
       must notify the loadmaster before he/she enters crew rest. Do not alert the loadmaster
AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010                                                            33


      early if they will not receive the minimum amount of crew rest of 12 hours. Do not alert
      the loadmaster more than 1 hour before beginning cargo up load. Base the aircrew FDP
      on the loadmaster‘s show time.
      3.11.1.3. C2 agents will not alert an aircrew until the aircraft is in commission or there is
      reasonable assurance that maintenance technicians will complete repairs that allow the
      aircrew time to pre-flight and load the aircraft to meet the target takeoff time.
      3.11.1.4. C2 agents will not alert outbound crews when inbound aircraft is on A-2 or A-3
      status until maintenance technicians determine required parts are available and the
      aircraft will be repaired within the target ground time.
      3.11.1.5. Self-Alerts. Crews will self-alert at locations without a C2 agency, but must
      coordinate with controlling C2 agency. The PIC may elect to self-alert on operational
      missions at locations with a C2 agency. Coordinate the alert time with local C2 agents to
      avoid FDP limitations that result from unexpected changes in the mission.
   3.11.2. The aircrew release policy is as follows:
      3.11.2.1. On the aircrew‘s initial entry or re-entry into crew rest, the controlling C2
      agent, or PIC during self-alerts, will establish an expected alert time.
      3.11.2.2. For all missions, the latest allowable alert time is 6 hours after the expected
      alert time. The PIC may extend that window to 8 hours when flying as primary crew or
      12 hours when deadheading. The controlling C2 agent will not ask the PIC to accept
      more than the 6 hour window. ANG/AFRC aircrew members may extend the window as
      necessary to deadhead to home station to meet the Firm Scheduled Return Time (FSRT).
      3.11.2.3. When a C2 agent determines circumstances will not allow for aircrew alerting
      during the legal for alert window, at that time but not earlier than the expected alert time,
      the C2 agent will contact the PIC and establish a new expected alert time at least 12+00
      hours from the time of notification.
      3.11.2.4. At the end of the legal for alert window or if a mission can‘t depart within 4+00
      hours of scheduled takeoff time, the PIC will contact a C2 agent and establish a new
      expected alert time. The PIC may extend takeoff window to 6 hours
3.12. Stage Management.
   3.12.1. Stage Posture. Stages operate on a positive launch principle. C2 agents shall alert
   aircrews using the following priority/hierarchy:
      3.12.1.1. Aircrews that require an emergency return to home station.
      3.12.1.2. De-positioning stage crews will be prioritized by their SRTs.
      3.12.1.3. Aircrews in sequence of arrival time.
      3.12.1.4. If the stage manager returns an aircrew in the stage to crew rest because of a
      mission delay or abort, that aircrew becomes first out when legal for alert.
   3.12.2. Mechanical Stage. A C2 agent may create a mechanical stage when a delayed or
   aborted mission will not resume before that aircrew‘s FDP expires. Aircrews in a mechanical
   stage will be first out when a mission in the same direction transits their location while they
   are legal for alert. A C2 agent may bump an inbound aircrew with FDP to complete that
 34                                             AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010


   mission to cycle aircrews in a mechanical stage. C2 agents should not normally establish a
   mechanical stage for ANG and AFRC crews flying unit-equipped aircraft.
3.13. Standby Force Duty. MAJCOM C2 Agents shall task units for Standby Force Duty not
later than 18 hours prior to legal for alert time. This allows crewmembers 12 hours of pre-
standby crew rest and 6 hours for aircraft pre-flight duty. When aircrews are unable to complete
all preflight duties within 6 hours of crew show time, provide an additional 12-hour pre-standby
crew rest. If MAJCOM C2 agents are unable to provide 18 hours prior notification, SQ/CC shall
place the pre-standby crew in 12 hour crew rest and follow aircraft generation procedures in
paragraph 3.7.5 to prepare the aircraft for launch. SQ/CC may keep an aircrew in
ALFA/BRAVO status up to 48 hours. MAJCOM/A3/DO may extend this period for
contingencies. After 48 hours, launch, release, or re-enter aircrew into 12 hour pre-departure
crew rest. OG/CCs may provide additional local procedures for management of Standby Force
Duties.
   3.13.1. ALFA Standby Aircraft Preflight Generation and Security. When tasked, SQ/CC
   shall posture an aircraft and aircrew as an ALFA Standby Force able to launch within 1 hour.
   The following procedures apply to primary aircraft as well as spare aircraft generated for
   ALFA alerts. A maintenance Dash -6 and aircrew Dash -1 preflight must be completed.
   Preflight validity will be in accordance with applicable T.O. After the preflight, the PIC will
   notify the controlling agency. The aircraft will remain in a sealed posture and be referred to
   as ―cocked on alert‖. Documentation of when the aircraft was cocked on alert must be placed
   in the forms. The PIC will ensure the aircraft is secure before entering crew rest. Secure all
   hatches and doors to show unauthorized entry. The aircrew preflight portion remains valid if
   performed by one crew, cocked on alert, and launched by another crew. Uncocking a
   generated aircraft is not a standard procedure but may be accomplished on a case by case
   basis. The PIC or a designated aircrew representative must be present if access to the aircraft
   is required. Ensure command and control and the controlling agency are notified when
   uncocking and recocking generated aircraft. Follow-on pre-flights done during normal
   waking hours do not interrupt crew rest. Begin CDT/FDP when C2 agent directs the aircrew
   to launch from crew rest or while performing pre-flight (begin CDT/FDP when the aircrew
   arrived at the aircraft to do the pre-flight).
       3.13.1.1. (Added-3WG) . At Elmendorf AFB, authorization to open a cocked and
       sealed aircraft prior to crew arrival must be coordinated with: The 517 AS Ramp
       Coordinator (for exercises), 517 AS Top Three, Production Superintendent and the
       assigned aircrew (as directed by the 517 AS Top Three or Ramp Coordinator). Make an
       INFO NOTE write-up in the AFTO Form 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work
       Document, to include a brief description of the reason for entry and the new seal number.
   3.13.2. BRAVO Standby Force. When tasked, SQ/CC shall posture an aircraft and/or
   aircrew in BRAVO Standby Force to permit launch within 3 hours. Follow-on pre-flights, if
   required, interrupt crew rest. Begin CDT/FDP when aircrew shows for duty, normally one
   hour after C2 alerts the air-crew from crew rest.
   3.13.3. CHARLIE Standby Force. When tasked, SQ/CC shall posture aircrews as a
   CHARLIE Standby Force ready to enter crew rest within 2 hours. Tasked aircrews will be
   legal for alert 12 hours after entering crew rest. SQ/CC may keep aircrews in CHARLIE
   status up to 72hours. After 72 hours, release aircrews from CHARLIE Standby or enter them
AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010                                                          35


  into 12 hours crew rest for directed mission, training mission, or subsequent standby force
  duty.
  3.13.4. J-Alert (JCS-directed alert force). Alert aircrew will be provided 12 hours crew rest
  prior to alert duty. Alert crew may be considered in crew rest upon termination of a flight,
  even though remaining on alert. If a crew completes a mission within their alert cycle, they
  are legal for alert again after 12 hours of crew rest. The length of a J-Alert tour will be
  determined by the OG/CC, but will not exceed 192 hours/8 days.
     3.13.4.1. J-Alert crews will not be used as preflight crews for aircraft other than their
     own alert aircraft or its replacement.
     3.13.4.2. J-Alert crew members may complete ground currency events and limited office
     duties at their leisure while on alert; however, they will not accomplish those items that
     result in DNIF status.
     3.13.4.3. Flying during alert is authorized with the following restrictions:
         3.13.4.3.1. At the discretion of the individual, not to exceed a flight duty period of 6
         hours.
         3.13.4.3.2. Crew members fly for individual currency or Special Operations/Boat
         Drop training. They are not an instructor/examiner pool.
         3.13.4.3.3. The alert aircraft and crew integrity are not required if recovery and re-
         launch can be accomplished within 1.5 hours of real world alert launch notification. If
         this timing cannot be met, the integral alert crew and aircraft must be used to allow
         airborne diversion.
         3.13.4.3.4. Special Operations training may be accomplished provided the crew
         members are allowed to adjust their work/rest cycle.
         3.13.4.3.5. Crew duty time (CDT) for real world crisis response will begin when the
         crew shows for the real world mission.
  3.13.5. Wing Standby Force. OG/CC may place aircrews in Wing Standby status. After a 12
  hour pre-departure crew rest period, aircrews are legal for alert for 12 hours and must be able
  to launch within 3+15 hours. After 12+00 hours, launch, release, or re-enter aircrews in 12
  hour crew rest period before subsequent 12 hours Wing Standby duty.
     3.13.5.1. Wing Standby Force Crew Management. A Wing Standby aircrew shall only
     pre-flight its own aircraft. Aircrew members in post-mission crew rest are available for
     Wing Standby only after post-mission crew rest period expires.
  3.13.6. Post-Standby Missions. On completion of standby duty, aircrew members may be
  dispatched on a mission. If started, post-standby crew rest must be completed before the start
  of pre-departure crew rest. If an aircrew member is dispatched on a mission, compute the
  post-mission crew rest time on standby time plus mission time.
  3.13.7. Post Standby Crew Rest. Aircrew members not dispatched on a mission following
  standby duty will receive post-mission standby crew rest as follows:
     3.13.7.1. If standby duty is performed away from normal quarters, crew rest time is
     computed from this standby time on the same basis as for mission time.
 36                                             AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010


       3.13.7.2. If standby duty was performed in normal quarters, no crew rest time is
       authorized
3.14. Orientation Flights and Incentive Flights. Refer to DoD 4515.13-R, Air Transportation,
AFI 11-401, Aviation Management, and the appropriate MAJCOM supplement.
3.15. Interfly. Interfly is a temporary arrangement between OG/CCs or equivalent to permit the
exchange or substitution of aircrew members and/or aircraft between mobility units to
accomplish flying missions. Normally, interfly should be limited to specific operations,
exercises, or special circumstances. However, it may be used for events of longer duration such
as unit conversion to another model design series (MDS). Participating aircrews shall use
guidelines established by the lead command or as specified in the OPLAN or CONOPS.
EXCEPTION: AE crewmembers are exempt from interfly requirements.
NOTE: ANG/XO has delegated approval authority to Wing Commanders for active duty/AFRC
interfly with ANG. Conduct interfly operations as follows:

   3.15.1. Aircrew members shall be current and qualified in the MDS (aircraft and model), as
   well as unique systems or configuration required to fly the aircraft/mission.
   3.15.2. Aircrew members will follow operational procedures established by the lead
   command for the MDS. The Mission Commander or PIC will brief MAJCOM-specific items.
   3.15.3. Each effected group commander who commits resources (personnel or aircraft) must
   concur with interfly proposal.
   3.15.4. MDS conversion training.
       3.15.4.1. Units may request an interfly agreement for duration of their conversion.
       OG/CCs will forward interfly requests to individual OG/CCs for approval. Requests will
       include as a minimum a list of effected units, duration of the agreement, and purpose.
   3.15.5. (Added-3WG) . Interfly requests will be routed through 3 OG/OGV.
3.16. Additional Crewmembers (ACM). Crewmembers qualified in mobility aircraft are
authorized ACM status on any mobility aircraft to pre/de-position in support of mobility
operations. MAJCOM designated crewmembers who are assigned or authorized to accompany
the normal crew compliment are allowed ACM status.
   3.16.1. Crewmembers in ACM status are not authorized to:
       3.16.1.1. Displace manifested passengers.
       3.16.1.2. Maintain currency and/or log flying time.
       3.16.1.3. Use for transportation while on leave.
       EXCEPTION: ANG/AFRC Air Technicians may be in a civilian leave status while
       traveling en route to perform in a military duty status.


       3.16.1.4. Travel on Special Air Missions/Command Support Mission (SAM/CSM)
       aircraft unless authorized by HQ AF/CVAM through the PIC.
AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010                                                         37


       3.16.1.5. Travel on Special Assignment Airlift Missions (SAAM) when specifically
       restricted by the mission directive (Form 59).
       3.16.1.6. Travel on Operational Support Airlift (OSA) aircraft unless authorized by Joint
       Operational Support Airlift Command (JOSAC) through the PIC.
   3.16.2. All ACMs require valid travel/flight orders or supporting message authorizing ACM
   status. OG/CCs may authorize ACM status for their mobility aircrews.
   3.16.3. Flight evaluators have priority and will not be displaced by any other ACM. The
   priority for evaluators is MAJCOM, NAF, group, then squadron level.
   3.16.4. ACMs normally travel in the crew compartment. If the number of ACMs desiring
   travel exceeds the capacity of the crew compartment, the C2 agency will notify the ATOC,
   who in turn will coordinate with the passenger terminal; seats not previously assigned may be
   used for ACMs.
   3.16.5. The PIC, or designated representative, will brief ACMs on seat assignment,
   appropriate mission information, emergency procedures including egress, and armed
   crewmembers. The PIC may assign an ACM aircrew-related duties for which the ACM is
   qualified.
   3.16.6. ACMs will coordinate their travel with the appropriate C2 agency prior to travel.
   They will process through the C2 agency as early as possible but NLT 3 hours prior to
   planned block time.
3.17. Mission Essential Ground Personnel (MEGP). Procedures and policies regarding
MEGP are contained in AFI 11-401 and AMCI 11-208. PICs will ensure personnel traveling in
this status are properly authorized.
   3.17.1. (Added-3WG) . PACAF Procedures and policies regarding mission essential
   personnel (MEP) are contained in AFI 11-401/PACAF Supplement, Aviation Management,
   and PACAFI 10-2101, Pacific Air Mobility Operations.
   3.17.2. (Added-3WG) . MEP requests will be routed through 3 OG/OGV.
3.18. Mission Mobility Observers (MMO). MAJCOM supplements or additional directives
may establish programs authorizing senior military and civilian personnel to fly for mobility
mission familiarization. For AMC MMO information reference AMCI 11-208.
3.19. Flight Attendants on Distinguished Visitor Missions. Flight Attendants will fly as
primary crew-members on designated C-17 missions IAW AFI 65-503 Table A36-1 note 32.
They will fall under the authority of the Mission Commander throughout the mission. An egress
briefing will be given to the Flight Attendants prior to the first mission leg.

                                           Chapter 4

                        AIRCRAFT OPERATING RESTRICTIONS

4.1. Objective. Redundant systems may allow crews to safely perform some missions when a
component/system is degraded. The PIC is the final authority in determining the overall
suitability of an aircraft for the mission. The PIC will ensure a detailed explanation of the
discrepancy is entered in the AFTO Form 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work
Document; include the following maintenance identifiers to effectively communicate aircraft
status:
   4.1.1. Mission Essential (ME). The PIC will designate an item, system, or subsystem
   component essential for safe aircraft operation or mission completion as ME.
   4.1.2. Mission Contributing (MC). The PIC will designate an item, system, or subsystem
   component, which is not currently essential for safe aircraft operation as MC. These
   discrepancies should be cleared at the earliest opportunity. If circumstances change or
   mission safety would be compromised, re-designate as ME. Do not delay a mission to clear a
   MC discrepancy.
   4.1.3. Open Item (OI). The PIC will designate discrepancies not expected to adversely
   impact the current mission or any subsequent mission as an OI. These items are normally
   cleared at home station.
4.2. Minimum Equipment List (MEL) Policy. The MEL is a pre-launch document that lists
the minimum equipment/systems to operate the aircraft. It is impractical to prepare a list that
would anticipate all possible combinations of equipment malfunctions and contingent
circumstances. Consider equipment/ systems with no listed exceptions as grounding items. A
PIC who accepted an aircraft with degraded equipment/systems is not committed to subsequent
operations with the same degraded equipment. PICs are not committed to operations with
degraded equipment accepted by another PIC.
   4.2.1. The PIC shall account for the possibility of additional failures during continued
   operation with inoperative systems or components. The MEL is not intended for continued
   operation over an indefinite period with systems/subsystems inoperative.
   4.2.2. All emergency equipment will be installed unless specifically exempted by mission
   requirements/directives.
   4.2.3. Waiver Policy. A PIC prepared to operate with a degraded MEL item shall request a
   waiver through C2 channels. The PIC shall provide the C2 agent: 1) nature of request, 2)
   individual crew-member qualification, 3) mission leg(s) requiring the waiver, and 4) the
   governing directive of waiver request to include volume, chapter, or paragraph. Initiate
   waiver requests as soon as possible; plan at least a 1-hour waiver process time.
   4.2.4. PICs operating with waiver(s) for degraded equipment shall coordinate mission
   requirements (i.e., revised departure times, fuel requirements, maintenance requirements,
   etc.) with the controlling C2 agency and/or flight manager.
   4.2.5. If beyond C2 communication capability, or when it is necessary to protect the crew or
   aircraft from a situation not covered by this chapter and immediate action is required, the PIC
AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010                                                           39


   may deviate according to paragraph 1.4 Report deviations (without waiver) through channels
   to MAJCOM/A3/ DO within 48-hours. OG/CCs shall collect background information and
   submit a follow-up written report upon request.
4.3. Waiver Protocol. Waivers to operate with degraded equipment are granted on a case-by-
case basis. The PIC determines the need for a waiver after coordinating with the lowest practical
level of command. MEL waiver authority is as follows:
   4.3.1. Training Missions. OG/CC or equivalent with mission execution authority.
   4.3.2. MAJCOM Directed Missions. MAJCOM/A3/DO with mission execution authority for
   active duty, AFRC, or ANG units flying MAJCOM-directed missions (includes Operational
   Readiness Inspections). Initiate the request with MAJCOM C2 agency. For AMC-directed
   missions contact HQ AMC/A37V through 18 AF TACC.
   4.3.3. Contingency Missions. DIRMOBFOR (or equivalent) for the agency with C2, if not
   specified in the OPORD/Tasking Order.
   4.3.4. ANG or AFRC Directed Missions. ANG or AFRC maintains C2 and waiver authority
   for ANG or AFRC directed mission prior to mobilization.
   4.3.5. Other Than MEL Waivers. Determine governing source document (i.e. AFI, Flight
   Manual, Maintenance T.O., etc.) to ascertain the waiver authority. Use C2 channels to notify
   the appropriate waiver authority. Waivers of this nature may require an extended response
   time.
   4.3.6. Engineering Dispositions (ED). Dispositions are requested when aircraft are damaged
   and/or established maintenance technical order procedures cannot be followed or do not
   exist. The on-site maintenance authority is responsible for requesting Engineering
   Dispositions. Most EDs allow maintenance to repair the aircraft and return it to unrestricted
   status; dispositions of this nature do not concern aircrews. However, EDs affecting aircrew
   operations require MEL waiver authority approval.
       4.3.6.1. PICs shall coordinate dispositions containing flight restrictions, prohibitions,
       additional operating limits, or modified/nonstandard operating procedures with the
       appropriate MEL waiver authority (see paragraph 4.3).
       4.3.6.2. PICs will not accept dispositions appearing incomplete, in error, or unsafe. Prior
       to rejecting a disposition, the PIC will contact the appropriate MEL waiver authority. The
       waiver authority will attempt to resolve the issue.
NOTE: Deviations from the flight manual requires approval IAW the flight manual.

4.4. Technical Assistance. The PIC may request technical support and additional assistance
from their home unit or MAJCOM C2 agency.
4.5. MEL Table Definitions/Column Identifiers. MEL tables are arranged by aircraft system
to provide the PIC a mechanism to determine minimum system requirements. Components are
listed by number installed and minimum required for flight. Requirements are defined by Home
Station Departure/Main Operating Base (MOB) (Column A) and en route stations (Column B).
Local training missions, to include off-station trainers, fall under Column B. An asterisk (*) in
the Required column indicates the number required is situation dependent; refer to the
Remarks/Limitations/Exceptions column for clarification. AMC and AMC gained aircrews will

consider Charleston AFB, McChord AFB, and McGuire AFB as MOBs. When transiting a MOB
on a pre-positioning or an active leg of a mission use Column A. When transiting a MOB on a
de-positioning leg use Column B.
EXAMPLE: A McChord C-17 transiting Charleston en route to Ramstein AB will use Column
A. However, when transiting Charleston en route to McChord (de-positioning) use Column B.

NOTE: Column B requirements will not normally be waived when transiting a MOB on a de-
positioning leg.
   4.5.1. Remarks/Limitations/Exceptions. Some technical information and procedures are
   contained in this column. This is not all-inclusive; crewmembers shall refer to the flight
   manual and other directives for procedures, techniques, limitations, etc.
   4.5.2. One-time Flight Clarification: Normally a Red X discrepancy downgraded for a one-
   time flight without passengers. The MXG/CC who owns the aircraft is the approval
   authority. Cargo may be carried as long as safety-of-flight is not compromised. The priority
   is to move the airplane to a repair capable facility; once repaired, the mission can be
   completed. PICs must coordinate with appropriate agencies to ensure repair capability exists
   at the destination. One-time flights may include en route stops only when necessary to
   recover the airplane. Example: An airplane departs on a gear-down flight from Djibouti IAP
   and requires an en route fuel stop (Cairo) before landing at the nearest repair capable facility,
   Sigonella NAS.
   4.5.3. One-time flight to nearest repair capable facility: Flight is limited to the nearest
   (shortest en route time) repair capable base.
   4.5.4. One-time flight to a repair capable facility: Flight is not restricted to the nearest repair
   capable facility.
   4.5.5. Other Mission and Repair Clarifications:
       4.5.5.1. Shall be repaired at next repair capable facility: Mission may continue as
       scheduled; item shall be repaired upon reaching a repair capable facility. Designate item
       ME upon reaching repair facility. Once maintenance action is initiated, and it is
       determined repairs are not possible, the PIC will discuss possible courses of action with
       C2 agency to return aircraft to service. En route repair capable facilities are deemed so
       regardless of parts availability. Example: If Yokota AB did not have the required part,
       the aircraft is not cleared to proceed without a waiver.
       4.5.5.2. Repair as soon as practical: Item should be repaired when ground time permits.
       Do not delay the mission even if at a maintenance capable facility.
       4.5.5.3. Mission may continue: Regardless of location, do not delay the mission,
       continue as scheduled. Item is designated MC; repair per paragraph 4.1.2
       4.5.5.4. Mission dictates requirement: PIC shall consider the entire mission profile, not
       just the next leg. Example: An airplane is departing an en route station with repair
       capability, after engine start it is discovered that the #1 engine anti-ice is inoperative.
       Icing conditions are not forecasted for the next leg. However, because the mission spans
       several days and repair capability does not exist at the scheduled en route stops, the PIC
       elects to have the item repaired prior to departing.

4.6. C-17 MEL. This MEL applies to all C-17 models and lists the minimum equipment and
systems to launch the aircraft under routine operations. The MEL does not include all equipment
or systems essential to airworthiness. The MEL is not intended to promote continued operation
of the aircraft for an indefinite period with systems/subsystems inoperative. See this chapter for
further information including objectives, policy, and waiver protocol. Additional guidance
specific to SOLL operations are listed in Addenda B, C-17 Special Operations.
4.7. Supplements. Each MAJCOM may supplement the MEL (see Chapter 1).
4.8. Navigation Systems.
   4.8.1. Equipment listed in FLIP for permitting compliance with MNPS is mandatory. Loss of
   any component before airspace entry requires return to a station with maintenance capability
   or re-filing via routes permitting equipment degradation.
4.9. Gear Down Flight Operations. During peacetime, gear down flight operations will be
limited to those sorties required to move the aircraft to a suitable repair facility. Gear down flight
should only be considered and approved after all avenues to repair the aircraft have been
exhausted.
   4.9.1. PICs shall not takeoff until there is reasonable assurance that they will
   achieve/maintain adequate obstacle clearance (to include en route stops and alternates).
   Reference ―Climbout Flight Path – 3 Engines Gear Down‖ charts in TO 1C-17A-1-1. PICs
   are reminded to also reference TO 1C-17A-1-1 for the appropriate drag index.
   4.9.2. Time and communications capability permitting, validate takeoff data with OG/OGV
   or MAJCOM STAN/EVAL.
4.10. NVG Minimum Operating Equipment. The following equipment is required for NVG
operations.
   4.10.1. NVGs that are HUD compatible (i.e. F4949G or L) mounted on a standard aircrew
   helmet. If available, one spare set of NVGs will be carried per crew. Each crewmember will
   carry approved spare batteries for their own NVGs. All crewmembers will preflight their own
   NVGs prior to flight, and should preflight their NVGs using an eye lane, Hoffman 20-20 box,
   or equivalent. The spare will also be preflighted.
   4.10.2. Each crewmember will carry an NVG-compatible light.

   AFI 11-215, Flight Manual Program (FMP). For AMC and AMC-gained units, AMC/A37V
   is the checklist insert approval authority. The inserts should be placed at the end of the
   appropriate checklist or in an in-flight guide. All checklist inserts must have a POC. OGVs
   shall approve local in-flight guides and inserts not affecting TO guidance and procedures.
5.2. Duty Station. A qualified pilot will be in control of the aircraft at all times during flight.
(EXCEPTION: Unqualified pilots undergoing qualification training and senior staff members
who have completed a Senior Staff Familiarization Course.) All crewmembers will be at their
duty stations during all critical phases of flight, unless crew duties dictate otherwise. Due to
mission requirements, and at the discretion of the PIC, loadmasters may occupy a seat on the
flight deck or cargo compartment. During other phases of flight, crewmembers may leave their
duty stations, for brief periods, to meet physiological needs and perform normal crew duties.
Only one pilot may be absent from their duty station at a time. Crewmembers will coordinate
with the PF before departing their assigned primary duty stations. With both pilots in their seats,
PICs may authorize rest periods for one pilot occupying a primary duty station during non-
critical phases of flight (the other pilot will be awake and alert).
   5.2.1. (Added-3WG) . During local training missions, a loadmaster will occupy either the
   left auxiliary crew member (LACM) or right auxiliary crew member (RACM) seat during at
   least one take off, one landing and, if a low level is planned, during the low level. The
   reason is to give the loadmasters opportunities to become more familiar with flight deck
   operations. Aircraft Commanders should, to the maximum extent possible, familiarize the
   loadmaster with applicable flight deck operations (that is, safety checks, chart reading, and so
   forth).
5.3. Flight Station Entry. PICs may authorize passengers and observers access to the flight
station during all phases of flight. The total number of persons permitted in the flight station is
limited to the number of seats with operable seat belts. In all cases, sufficient oxygen sources
must be available. Passengers and observers will not be permitted access to the pilot, copilot, or
loadmaster position regardless of its availability.
5.4. Takeoff and Landing Policy. A current and qualified aircraft commander, or above, will
occupy either the left or the right seat during all takeoffs and landings. The designated PIC (A-
code), is not required to occupy a primary position, but still retains overall authority for conduct
of the mission.
   5.4.1. An AC or higher will make all takeoffs and landings during:
       5.4.1.1. Airlift of nuclear weapons.
AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010                                                             61


       5.4.1.2. Aircraft emergencies, unless conditions prevent compliance.
       5.4.1.3. Assault landing operations or landings with substandard airfield operations.
       EXCEPTION: Pilots receiving upgrade training or receiving an evaluation.


       5.4.1.4. Situations when in the opinion of the PIC, marginal conditions exist.
       5.4.1.5. CAT II ILS approaches and landings when weather is below CAT I mins.
   5.4.2. PICs who possess less than 100 Primary Assigned Aircraft (PAA) hours in the C-17
   since certification will perform all takeoffs and landings.
   EXCEPTION: They may allow current ACs or higher to perform takeoffs and landings
   when required to maintain currency.


   5.4.3. Copilot Takeoff/Landing Policy. Copilots may takeoff or land from the right seat if an
   AC with over 100 PAA hours since certification in the C-17 occupies the left seat. Copilots
   may takeoff and land from the left seat only if an instructor pilot or flight examiner provides
   direct supervision from the right seat.
   5.4.4. First Pilots and graduates of the Pilot Initial Qualification (PIQ) course may takeoff or
   land from either seat if an AC with over 100 PAA hours since certification in the C-17
   occupies the other seat.
5.5. Landing Gear and Slat/Flap Operating Policy. The landing gear will be operated by the
pilot in the right seat on command of the pilot flying the aircraft. Before actuation of the landing
gear, the other pilot will verify appropriate airspeed and acknowledge the command by repeating
it. The slats/flaps will be operated by the pilot not flying (PNF) the aircraft on command of the
pilot flying (PF) the aircraft. Before actuation of the slats/flaps, the other pilot will verify
appropriate airspeed and acknowledge the command by repeating it.
5.6. Outside Observer/ACM Duties. Available crewmembers will assist in clearing during
taxi operations, and any time the aircraft is below 10,000 feet MSL.
5.7. Seat Belts.
   5.7.1. All occupants will have a designated seat with a seat belt. Use of seat belts will be as
   directed by the PIC and flight manual.
   5.7.2. Primary crewmembers occupying pilot, copilot, or loadmaster positions will have seat
   belts fastened at all times in-flight, unless crew duties dictate otherwise.
   5.7.3. All crewmembers will be seated with seat belts and shoulder harnesses fastened
   during taxi, takeoff, and landing, unless crew duties dictate otherwise. For A/R, all
   crewmembers and passengers will be seated with seat belts fastened (unless authorized by the
   PIC to observe tanker A/R or crew duties dictate otherwise), and all equipment will be
   properly secured. Crewmembers performing instructor or flight examiner duties are exempt
   from seat belt requirements if not occupying a primary crew position; however, a seat with an
   operable seat belt will be assigned.

   5.7.4. Litter patients, actual or simulated, may remain secured on litters for takeoff and
   landing.
5.8. Aircraft Lighting. IAW AFI 11-202V3, AFI 11-218, Aircraft Operations and Movement
on the Ground, and applicable TOs.
   5.8.1. NVG Lighting.
       5.8.1.1. During combat/contingency operations, the tactical situation may dictate the use
       of all, some, or none of the aircraft exterior lights as determined by the mission
       commander. Lights-out operations during peacetime will be conducted in warning or
       restricted areas IAW AFI 11-202V3 unless a letter of agreement exists with the FAA.
       Use the following guidance for aircraft exterior lighting configurations when operating
       outside of these areas.
       5.8.1.2. Navigation Lights: Steady, bright.
       5.8.1.3. Formation Lights: On, medium (formation operations only).
WARNING: Immediately discontinue use of NVGs, and/or increase spacing from preceding
aircraft (if possible), when exterior lights in a preceding aircraft create excessive distractions or
degrade performance of NVGs to the point where safe flying operations cannot be maintained.


       5.8.1.4. Anti-Collision Lights: On, lower (upper and lower for single ship operations or
       for the last aircraft in the formation unless it causes distractions).
       5.8.1.5. Landing Lights. IR landing lights will be turned on no later than 400‘ AGL on
       final.
   5.8.2. NVG Aircraft Preparation. The cockpit of the C-17A is specifically designed for NVG
   operations and little preparation is required for flights requiring NVGs. During the exterior
   walk around inspection, a pilot will ensure all wheel well inspection lights are turned off and
   necessary exterior IR lighting is installed.
NOTE: Mini-chemical lights or tape to mark/identify switches and equipment may be used as
required.

5.9. Portable Electronic Devices. IAW AFI 11-202V3.
   5.9.1. Do not connect unauthorized equipment (laptop computers, video equipment, food
   preparation equipment, radios/tape players, CD players, etc.) to the aircraft intercom, PA,
   radio systems, or electrical system.
   5.9.2. Aircrew members shall not use uncertified Government Furnished Equipment (GFE)
   or personal devices with RF transmit/receive capability on AMC aircraft carrying hazard
   class 1 explosive cargo at anytime. Prohibited devices include cellular phones, and laptop
   computers/PDAs with wireless capability enabled (i.e. Bluetooth). Loadmasters will ensure
   passengers comply with this restriction. Aircrew members may use certified GFE such as
   PFPS laptops and PDAs with infrared transmitters.
AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010                                                              63


    5.9.3. (Added-3WG) . Aircrew members occupying a primary crew position will not use
    hand-held cameras during critical phases of flight. The pilot taxiing/controlling the aircraft is
    prohibited from operating a hand-held camera at anytime.
5.10. Tobacco Use on Air Force Aircraft. Tobacco use of any type is prohibited on Air Force
aircraft.
5.11. Advisory Calls. The pilot flying will periodically announce intentions during departures,
arrivals, approaches, and when circumstances require deviating from normal procedures. Table
5.1 through Table 5.4 depicts mandatory calls for nonprecision approaches, precision
approaches, climb out and descent respectively.

NOTES:
1. The PF will announce his/her intentions to either land or go-around. If the runway
environment is not in sight and/or the aircraft is not in position for a normal landing, a go around
will be made.
2. With weather at CAT 1 minimums on a CAT 1 ILS, the pilot may not see the runway
environment at DH; however, the initial portion of the approach lights will be visible. The pilot
may continue to 100 HAT with reference to the approach lights. The pilot may not descend
below 100 feet above touchdown zone elevation using the approach lights as reference unless the
red terminating bars or the red side row bars are distinctly visible and identifiable.
3. The PF will announce his/her intentions to either land, continue, or go-around. Respond
intention to ―Land‖ if runway environment is in sight, will remain in sight throughout touchdown
and the aircraft is in a position for a safe landing.
4. Both pilots will state the altimeter setting.
   5.11.1. Deviations:
       5.11.1.1. The PNF will inform the PF when heading or airspeed deviations are observed,
       or when the altitude is more than 100 feet from the desired, and no attempt is being made
       to correct the deviation.
       5.11.1.2. Any crewmember seeing a deviation of 200 feet altitude or 10 knots in
       airspeed, or a potential terrain or obstruction problem, will immediately notify the PF.
       Deviations from prescribed procedures for the approach being flown will also be
       announced.
5.12. Communications Policy. The Air Force does not give a promise of confidentiality to
aircrews regarding their recorded aircraft crew communications. Crewmembers are expected to
maintain a high degree of cockpit professionalism and crew coordination at all times.
   5.12.1. Sterile Cockpit. Limit conversation to that essential for crew coordination and
   mission accomplishment during taxi, takeoff, A/R, approach, landing, and any flight below
   10,000 feet MSL.
   5.12.2. Aircraft Interphone. Primary crewmembers will monitor interphone during critical
   phases of flight. Crewmembers will coordinate with the PF before checking off interphone or
   operating in ISOLATE. Crewmembers will ensure personnel on headset, or within listening
   distance, are cleared prior to discussing classified information over interphone.
   5.12.3. Command Radios:
       5.12.3.1. The PNF normally makes all air traffic control (ATC) radio calls.
       5.12.3.2. In terminal areas, all crewmembers (if able) will monitor the primary radio
       unless directed otherwise. A crewmember will be designated to monitor C2 frequencies
       on the inbound and outbound legs.
           5.12.3.2.1. (Added-3WG) . At least one crew member will monitor 3 WG/CP, to
           the maximum extent possible, when within range of Elmendorf AFB.
           EXCEPTION: CP frequency may be turned down during critical phases of flight.
       5.12.3.3. The pilot operating the radios will notify the crew which radio is primary, and
       update the crew when the primary radio changes.
AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010                                                           65


     5.12.3.4. One pilot should record and will read back all ATC clearances.
     5.12.3.5. Both pilots will monitor UHF and VHF guard emergency frequencies to the
     maximum extent possible.
     EXCEPTION: Only one crewmember is required to monitor guard frequencies during
     rendezvous and A/R.
     5.12.3.6. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) prohibits the use of
     unauthorized frequencies for interplane, HAVE QUICK, or SECURE VOICE training.
     5.12.3.7. (Added-3WG) . Aircrews operating in the Elmendorf AFB traffic pattern may
     transmit to tower/ground (as appropriate) on the ultra high frequencies (UHF) or very
     high frequencies (VHF). C-12s, E-3s C-130s and the aero club primarily use VHF
     frequencies while the fighters use UHF. Aircrews should use/monitor UHF frequencies
     when fighter aircraft are in the pattern to increase situational awareness for all aircraft,
     but may switch to VHF once the fighter fly window is over. In any situation use the
     radio that will provide the most situational awareness for all aircraft involved.
     Regardless of what is being used as the primary frequency, when available, crews should
     monitor both UHF and VHF.
  5.12.4. HF Communications. Confine message traffic to essential operational matters.
  Perform an HF radio ground check before takeoff if the use of HF radio may be required for
  ATC or C2 communications. Establish HF contact before going out of UHF and VHF range.
  If unable to establish HF contact with the controlling HF station, and an alternate means of
  relay of ATC information in oceanic areas is not available, comply with FLIP.
     5.12.4.1. General. Provide ATC position and weather observations when required. If
     unable to contact an ATC agency, attempt relay through the GLOBAL HF stations.
  5.12.5. Use secure and jam resistant communications to the maximum extent possible. In a
  threat environment, limit radio transmissions with the objective area to those required for
  safety of flight or factors affecting force employment.
  5.12.6. Crew Resource Management (CRM) Assertive Statement ―Time Out‖.
     5.12.6.1. ―Time Out‖ is the common assertive statement for use by all crewmembers.
     The use of ―Time Out‖ will:
         5.12.6.1.1. Provide a clear warning sign of a deviation or loss of situational
         awareness.
         5.12.6.1.2. Provide an opportunity to break the error chain before a mishap occurs.
         5.12.6.1.3. Notify all crewmembers when someone sees the aircraft or crew
         departing from established guidelines, the briefed scenario, or that someone is simply
         uncomfortable with the developing conditions.
     5.12.6.2. As soon as possible after a ―Time Out‖ has been called, the aircrew will take
     the following actions:
         5.12.6.2.1. Safety permitting, stabilize the aircraft.
         5.12.6.2.2. The initiating crewmember will voice his or her concerns to the crew.
 66                                              AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010


           5.12.6.2.3. The PIC will provide all other crewmembers with the opportunity to voice
           inputs relative to the stated concerns.
           5.12.6.2.4. After considering all inputs, the PIC will direct the aircrew to continue the
           current course of action or direct a new course of action.
5.13. Transportation of Pets. Transporting pets (dogs and cats) in conjunction with the
sponsor‘s permanent change of station is authorized. Other pets or animals are normally
prohibited, but may be moved according to DoD 4515.13R..
5.14. Alcoholic Beverages. MAJCOM A3/DO may authorize the dispensing of alcoholic
beverages.
5.15. Runway, Taxiway and Airfield Requirements; Wind Restrictions; Runway Condition
Reading (RCR) Limitations: A current landing zone (LZ) survey is needed before using other
than hard-surfaced runways or taxiways, to include Matted runways. MAJCOM/A3/DO may
waive runway/taxiway width requirements.
   5.15.1. Runway and Taxiway Width Requirements. Minimum runway and taxiway widths
   for normal and tactical airland operations are depicted in Table 5.5.

Table 5.5. Runway/Taxiway Width Requirements.
Runway Operations                                   Width
Normal Operations                                   90 Feet/27.5 Meters
Tactical Assault Operations (Includes SPRO)         90 Feet/27.5 Meters
Taxiway
Normal and Tactical Assault Operations              50 Feet/15.5 Meters
Star Turn                                           90 Feet/27.5 Meters
   5.15.2. Runway Length for Takeoff. Normally, takeoffs will be initiated from the beginning
   of the approved usable portion of the runway. Minimum runway length for take off is critical
   field length.
       5.15.2.1. Intersection Takeoffs. Normally, the PF will initiate takeoffs from the
       beginning of the approved usable portion of the runway. The decision to make
       intersection takeoffs rests solely with the PIC. Ensure the operating environment (i.e.,
       gross weight, obstructions, climb criteria, weather, etc.) will allow a safe takeoff and
       departure. Data computations will be based on the actual runway remaining from the
       point at which the takeoff is initiated.
       5.15.2.2. During operations on runways partially covered with snow or ice, takeoff
       computations will be based on the reported RSC or RCR for the cleared portion of the
       runway. A minimum of 45 feet either side of centerline should be cleared. If 45 feet
       either side of centerline is not cleared, then compute data based on the uncleared portion
       up to 45 feet either side of centerline.
   5.15.3. Runway Length for Landing. Minimum runway for a normal landing (3/4 or full
   flap) is computed landing distance with idle reverse.
NOTE: Pilots will consider elevated brake temperatures and Vbo when determining the
minimum runway required for landing to preclude melting the fuse plugs.
AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010                                                           67



       5.15.3.1. Minimum runway length for an assault landing is computed ground roll, with
       max reverse, plus 500 feet. Touchdown will be within the first 500 feet of the runway and
       full flaps will be used. Weather minimums will be circling minimums, no lower than
       600/2. Prior to landing at a short field, the PIC will verify takeoff performance to ensure
       he/she can take off after the planned offload/onload.
NOTES:
Max reverse is referenced on the Non-Standard Configuration page of the mission computer. The
data computed with this option selected is based on 2 engines in max reverse, 1 in idle reverse
and 1 engine inoperative.
Pilots will consider elevated brake temperatures and Vbo when determining the minimum
runway required for landing to preclude melting the fuse plugs.
          5.15.3.1.1. Markings required for assault landing zone (ALZ) operations are depicted
          in AFI 13-217, Drop Zone and Landing Zone Operations. These markings are
          desirable for tactical airland operations; however, full markings are not mandatory on
          hard-surfaced runways that are permanently marked (or lighted) so as to make the
          touchdown zone and runway distances readily identifiable, or if the tactical situation
          does not permit full markings. Communication and navigation aids provided by
          special tactics units, are based on operational requirements, capability, and the
          specific threat environment.
       5.15.3.2. Runways less than 3,500 feet require MAJCOM/A3/DO waiver.
       5.15.3.3. Semi-Prepared Runway Operations (SPRO). See TO 1C-17A-1-1 Appendix B.
       OG/CC approval is required for semi-prepared runway operations within the CONUS,
       Alaska, and Hawaii. AMC/A3 approval is required in all other instances. For semi-
       prepared ALZs other than matted surfaces, Mission Commanders will ensure proper
       engineering evaluations (i.e. Dynamic Cone Penetrometer (DCP) or equivalent) are
       completed by qualified personnel within one week of the first landing to verify the LZ
       meets C-17 requirements.
   5.15.4. Use of Overruns. If approach end overruns are available and stressed or authorized
   for normal operations, they may be used to increase the runway available for takeoff.
   Departure end overruns (if stressed and authorized) may also be used for landing if needed.
   5.15.5. Arresting Cables (does not include recessed cables).
       5.15.5.1. When conditions permit (aircraft gross weight, runway length, weather, winds,
       TOLD, etc.) and the pilot in command has considered the potential for damaging the
       aircraft, make takeoffs and landings beyond raised cable barriers. Use the entire length of
       runway if necessary. Be aware that operations over arresting gear barriers at speeds in
       excess of taxi speed may result in damage to the aircraft.
       5.15.5.2. Do not land on (touchdown on) approach end arresting cables (does not include
       recessed cables). If the aircraft lands before the cable, the crew should contact the tower
       to have the cable inspected.
 68                                             AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010


      5.15.5.3. Do not takeoff or land over an approach end cable that has been reported as
      slack, loose, or improperly rigged by NOTAM, automated terminal information service
      (ATIS), or ATC.
   5.15.6. Other Airfield Requirements.
      5.15.6.1. Consult with HQ AMC/A36AS (Airfield Suitability Branch) for suitability
      guidance. Once a mission is executed, the PIC is responsible for determining airfield
      suitability based upon operational need. Airfield certification requirements are detailed in
      the ASRR.
      5.15.6.2. Aircrews and planning agencies will contact HQ AMC/A36AS for all questions
      pertaining to airfield weight bearing capacity and will review the GDSS/GDSS2/ASRR
      before all off-station operations. HQ AMC/A3 is the waiver authority for the restrictions
      in GDSS/GDSS2 Giant Report and ASRR for AMC and AMC-gained aircraft, unless
      specifically delegated in AFI 11-2MDS Vol 3 or AMCI 11-208. Direct GDSS/GDSS2
      Giant Report and ASRR waiver requests to HQ AMC/A36AS. HQ AMC/A37V is the
      OPR for waivers to airfield restrictions. MAJCOM/ A3/DO is the waiver authority for
      non-AMC missions. The PIC is responsible for waiver compliance. Crews that have
      access to the World Wide Web will review airfield suitability in the airfield data base via

      airfield certification requirements.
   5.15.7. (Added-3WG) . Twin Tandem/Triple Tandem (TT/TRT) Landing Conversion.
   For airfields with published TT limitations a maximum TRT gross weight can be derived
   with the following formula: TRT = (TT - 77.3) / 0.405 (EXAMPLE: Savannah runway 27;
   TT = 280; therefore, TRT = 500).
   5.15.8. (Added-3WG) . Gross Weight Conversion. For airfields with pavement
   classification number (PCN), aircraft classification number (ACN), load classification
   number (LCN), or California bearing ratio (CBR), maximum TRT gross landing weights can
   be derived from AFTTP 3-3.C-17, Air Force Tactics, Techniques and Procedures, Table 3.5,
   C-17 Gross Weight Conversion Table.
5.16. Aircraft Taxi and Taxi Obstruction Clearance Criteria and Foreign Object Damage
(FOD) Avoidance.
   5.16.1. Do not taxi an aircraft within 25 feet of obstructions without wing walkers
   monitoring clearance between aircraft and obstructions. With wing walkers, avoid taxi
   obstructions by at least 10 feet. Follow clearance criteria in Figure 5.1 for small permanent
   obstructions underneath the wing. During reverse taxi operations, do not taxi within 25 feet
   of an obstruction with or without a marshaller/wing walker.
   EXCEPTION: IAW AFI 11-218, Aircraft Operations and Movement on the Ground, aircraft
   may taxi without marshallers/wing walkers at home station along fixed taxi lines which have
   been measured to ensure a minimum of 10 feet clearance from any obstruction. obstruction
   and the obstruction is permanent. Parked aircraft are not considered permanent, and 25 feet
   of clearance, or a wing walker, is required.
AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010                                                             69


Figure 5.1. Taxi Obstruction Diagram.




NOTES:
Permanent obstacles (i.e. fuel hydrants), 3 feet high or shorter, are not considered obstructions as
long as they remain a minimum of 10 feet away from the landing gear doors.
A marshaller or crew member will verify the height and location of 3' and 5' high obstacles to
ensure specified clearances from the wing, engines, and landing gear doors.
   5.16.2. When taxi clearance is doubtful, use one or more wing walkers. If wing walkers are
   unavailable, deplane one or more crewmembers to maintain obstruction clearance and
   provide marshaling using AFI 11-218 signals. Use wing walkers, deplaned crewmembers, or
   a crewmember on inter-phone positioned at the paratroop door(s) or ramp to act as an
   observer while maneuvering on narrow taxiways. During night taxi operations, marshallers
   will have an illuminated wand in each hand. Wing walkers are only required to have one
   illuminated wand. Observers should be in a position to see wing walkers at all times (through
   door or windows) and communicate with the pilot.
       5.16.2.1. (Added-3WG) . Elmendorf AFB Block-Out/Block-In:
           5.16.2.1.1. (Added-3WG) . Do not block-out/block-in without a marshaller. The
           loadmaster or an extra pilot may deplane and perform marshalling duties unless
           mission requirements dictate otherwise (passengers on board, and so forth).
           EXCEPTION: Aircrew may block-out/block-in without a marshaller at the joint
           military complex (JMC) Ramp, distinguished visitor (DV) Spot, Hot Cargo Pad or
           when executing an engine running crew change (ERCC) at a designated ERCC
           parking spot.
           5.16.2.1.2. (Added-3WG) . If proximity of adverse weather (lightning within five
           miles, and so forth) prevents the maintenance block-in/block-out crew from
           marshalling aircraft the crew will remain inside the aircraft until the lightning
           advisory has been lifted and a marshaller is available to block aircraft.

   5.16.3. FOD Avoidance. Make every effort to minimize the potential for engine FOD. Crews
   should:
       5.16.3.1. Carefully review airfield layout paying particular attention to taxi routes, turn
       requirements, and areas for potential FOD. Pay attention to other aircraft with engines
       running on parking aprons, adjacent taxiways, hammerheads, and arm/de-arm areas.
       5.16.3.2. Minimize power settings during all taxi operations.
       5.16.3.3. Avoid (when possible) 180-degree turns.
       5.16.3.4. Avoid (when possible) taxi operations, which would position an engine over an
       unprepared or unswept surface. If it becomes necessary to position an engine over an
       unprepared or unswept surface, the engine should be left in idle (to the maximum extent
       possible) until the engine is back over an improved surface. Consider increasing power
       on remaining engines.
   5.16.4. (Added-3WG) . Loadmaster Ground Operations. During aircraft taxi or reverse
   taxi, the aircraft loadmaster will not open the forward emergency escape exit to observe
   clearances.
5.17. Reverse Taxi:
   5.17.1. The pilot will coordinate reverse taxi directions and signals to be used with the
   loadmaster and marshaller (when available).
   5.17.2. Unless briefed otherwise, the following standard terms will be used by the
   loadmaster when conducting reverse taxi operations:
       5.17.2.1. The #1 and #4 engines will be used as turn references, i.e., ―More turn towards
       #1,‖ ―Less turn towards #4.‖ Use the term ―roll out‖ when you want the PF to center the
       tiller.
       5.17.2.2. When the aircraft nears the desired reverse taxi stopping point, the loadmaster
       will give the following commands: ―Loadmaster counting, five, four, three, two, one,
       stop.‖
CAUTION: During the entire reverse taxi operation, if the loadmaster states the word ―Stop,‖ the
pilot will immediately stop the aircraft. Failure to comply may result in damage to aircraft or
injury to personnel.
   5.17.3. Ensure all passengers are seated with seatbelts fastened and cargo is secure.
   5.17.4. The loadmaster must have enough maneuverability to observe and direct reverse taxi,
   and report any hazards. The loadmaster will provide the pilot with continuous interphone
   instructions on conditions in the maneuvering area. This includes turns, distance remaining
   (for wingtips, empennage, and main gear), and stopping point. During aircraft backing, if the
   pilot and loadmaster lose interphone contact the pilot will stop the aircraft.
   5.17.5. When reverse taxiing at night, the pilots and loadmaster will ensure the taxi area is
   sufficiently lighted. Use the staging lights, retracted landing lights, or any other source that
   provides adequate lighting of the taxi area.
   5.17.6. During reverse taxi operations, stop at least 25 feet from an obstruction with or
   without a marshaller/wing walker.
AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010                                                            71


CAUTION: The aircraft tail cannot be seen by the loadmaster from inside the aircraft and could
possibly strike an obstruction well before the main gear tires are near the ramp edge. If any doubt
exists as to sufficient clearance, stop the aircraft.

5.18. Fuel Jettison Procedures.
   5.18.1. AMC policy is to burn down fuel versus jettison, unless safety of flight dictates an
   immediate jettison (as determined by the pilot in command). Except in the case of an
   emergency, before jettisoning fuel, notify the appropriate ATC or flight service facility of
   intentions, altitude, and location. If available, the PIC will use designated jettison areas,
   except when safety of flight would be compromised.
   5.18.2. For missions tasked by higher headquarters authority, the tasking C2 agency (18 AF
   TACC, AMOCC, CAOC, etc.) may authorize fuel jettison when an urgent operational
   requirement dictates immediate recovery/reconstitution of the aircraft and/or aircrew. The
   tasking C2 agency may provide fuel jettison instructions in the OPORD, mission directive,
   SPINS, etc.
   5.18.3. For training missions, the OG/CC may approve fuel jettison when an urgent
   operational requirement exists to expedite recovery of the aircraft and/or aircrew, and all
   alternatives have been exhausted.
   5.18.4. OG/CCs will establish jettison areas and procedures to minimize the impact of fuel
   jettisoning. Ideally, establish jettison areas at 20,000 feet MSL, off published airways,
   avoiding urban areas, agricultural regions, and water supply sources. Avoid circling descents.
   Initiate AF IMT 813, Request for Environmental Impact Analysis, and submit it to the base
   environmental coordinator.
   5.18.5. All jettisons will be followed up with a detailed report filed by the pilot in command
   immediately after landing (AMC Form 97, AMC In-flight Emergency and Unusual
   Occurrence Worksheet). Submit AMC Form 97 through unit OGV to AMC/A37V. Unit
   OGVs will retain AMC Form 97 for 6 months. Document all pertinent information, including
   the following items:
       5.18.5.1. Scheduled Duration.
       5.18.5.2. Actual Duration.
       5.18.5.3. Landing Gross Weight.
       5.18.5.4. Computed Stopping Distance.
       5.18.5.5. Recovery Field.
       5.18.5.6. Runway Available.
       5.18.5.7. Jettison Altitude/Location.
       5.18.5.8. Outside air temperature.
       5.18.5.9. Wind direction and velocity.
       5.18.5.10. Jettison Amount.
       5.18.5.11. Reason for Jettison.

       5.18.5.12. Approval Authority.
5.19. Aircraft Speed. Comply with requirements established in AFI 11-202V3. In accordance
with applicable tech orders, aircraft may exceed 250 KIAS or in-flight minimum maneuver speed
below 10,000 feet to safely accomplish formation departure rejoins. Once rejoined, all formation
members may exceed 250 KIAS below 10,000 feet only to accommodate the minimum
maneuver speed of the heaviest formation member.
5.20. Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) Programs. BASH programs are
centralized unit efforts that provide information cross-feed, hazard identification, and a
consolidated course of action. As a minimum, units must implement the following procedures:
   5.20.1. Ensure compliance with the following Bird Watch condition restrictions.
       5.20.1.1. Bird Watch Condition Low – No operating restrictions.
       5.20.1.2. Bird Watch Condition Moderate. Initial takeoffs and final landings allowed
       only when departure and arrival routes will avoid bird activity. Local IFR/VFR traffic
       pattern activity is prohibited.
       5.20.1.3. Bird Watch Condition Severe. All takeoffs and landings are prohibited. Waiver
       authority is local OG/CC or equivalent. Parent MAJCOM/A3/DO waiver is required to
       operate at airfields not controlled by the MAF.
       5.20.1.4. (Added-3WG) . Refer to 3WGI 91-212, Bird and Wildlife Aircraft Strike
       Hazard (BASH) Program, for specific bird and wildlife aircraft strike hazard (BASH)
       procedures. Elmendorf AFB pattern BASH restrictions are also in the 3rd Wing In-flight
       Guide.
   5.20.2. Commanders establish Phase II of the BASH program during increased periods of
   migratory bird activity. Schedulers shall make every effort to not schedule takeoffs, landings,
   and low-levels from one hour before to one hour after sunrise and sunset during the Phase II
   period. Publish significant bird hazards in FLIP Area Planning (AP) and the IFR Supplement
   along with the associated airfield operating hour restrictions and avoidance instructions.
       5.20.2.1. (Added-3WG) . Elmendorf AFB BASH Phases will be declared and
       rescinded via 3 OG FCIF, along with applicable restrictions.
   5.20.3. When operating at airfields where no BASH program exists, PICs have the authority
   to delay takeoffs and arrivals due to bird condition. Coordinate actions through appropriate
   C2 authority.
   5.20.4. Consider bird migratory patterns during the en route portion of the mission to help
   minimize the potential of an in-flight bird strike. The Bird Avoidance Model (BAM) on HQ
   AFSC/SEF website contains BASH information including regionalized Continental United
   States (CONUS) bird migration patterns, Portable Flight Planning System (PFPS) software
   overlay, and the latest news. The Avian Hazard Advisory system (AHAS) website is another
   source for real time bird hazard information. Both sites may be accessed through the AMC
   aircrew mission planning portal. See AFPAM 91-212, Bird Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH)
   Management Techniques, for additional information.
       5.20.4.1. (Added-3WG) . Mission Planning and Execution:
AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010                                                        73


          5.20.4.1.1. (Added-3WG) . Mission Planning. During planning, crews will review
          the bird avoidance model (BAM) (http://www.usahas.com/bam), avian hazard
          advisory system (AHAS) (http://www.usahas.com) (if applicable) and other
          published regulatory guidance (AP/1, notices to airmen (NOTAM), and so forth)
          providing bird conditions and restrictions. Results will be considered during mission
          planning. Crews should also reference 3WGI 91-212 on E-pubs.
   5.20.5. Following a bird strike, aircrews should land as soon as practicable, to have the
   aircraft inspected by qualified maintenance personnel. Bird strike damage cannot be
   accurately assessed in-flight, and undetected damage may result in a complex airborne
   emergency; only qualified maintenance personnel, on the ground, can make reliable damage
   assessments.
       5.20.5.1. (Added-3WG) .         The 3 WG Bird Strike Reporting Procedures.
       Immediately report all bird strikes to the nearest C2 agency. Report all 3 WG aircraft
       bird strikes to 517 AS/SE and 3 WG/ SEF (552-4681/3389) as soon as possible (no later
       than 24 hours) using all available methods to include 3 WG/CP or 613 AOC/AMD while
       on off-station missions. Complete AF Form 853, Air Force Wildlife Strike Report, and
       fax to 3 WG/SEF (552-9824) and 517 AS/SE. If a bird strike causes damage to the
       aircraft, complete 3rd Wing Safety Aircraft Incident Worksheet (NOTE: AMC Form 97,
       AMC In-flight Emergency and Unusual Occurrence Worksheet, may be substituted for
       3rd Wing Safety Aircraft Incident Worksheet) and fax it to 3 WG/SEF and 517 AS/SE
       along with the AF Form 853.
   5.20.6. (Added-3WG) . Additional BASH guidance is published in 3WGI 91-212.
5.21. Functional Check Flights (FCFs) and Acceptance Check Flights (ACFs). FCFs and
ACFs will be accomplished IAW TO 1C-17A-6, Inspection Requirements Manual, AFI 21-101,
Aerospace Equipment Maintenance Management, TO 1-1-300, Functional Check Flights and
Maintenance Operational Checks, and TO 1C-17-6CF-1, Acceptance and Functional Check
Flight Procedures Manual. Crews should only perform tasks or functions contained in specific
technical order guidance. If requested to perform a non-standard function, PICs should contact
their OG/CC to see if an FCF applies.
   5.21.1. FCF Restrictions. See T.O. 1-1-300.
       5.21.1.1. The OG/CC, or deployed equivalent, may authorize temporary waivers to FCF
       procedures for aircrew qualification when operationally necessary.
       5.21.1.2. The OG/CC is responsible for the wing FCF program. Publish additional
       guidance in local supplement to this instruction. The OG/CC may authorize a partial FCF
       to check only those systems disturbed by maintenance, an inspection or modification.
          5.21.1.2.1. (Added-3WG) . Additional 3WG FCF program guidelines are published
          in AFI 21-101, Aerospace Equipment Maintenance Management.
       5.21.1.3. Conduct check flights within the designated check flight airspace of the base
       from which the flight was launched except when the flight must be conducted under
       specific conditions, not compatible with local conditions and area restrictions.
       5.21.1.4. The decision to approve a combined FCF and ferry flight is the responsibility
       of the MAJCOM/A3/DO.
74                                             AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010


     5.21.1.5. The OG/CC will only certify highly experienced instructors as FCF
     crewmembers. The OG/CC will determine FCF crew complement after a thorough ORM
     assessment for that specific FCF flight.
     5.21.1.6. Ideally, conduct FCFs in daylight, VMC. OG/CCs may authorize a flight under
     a combination of VMC and IMC. Begin the flight in VMC. If the aircraft and all systems
     are operating properly, the crew may proceed IFR through cloud cover to ―VFR on Top‖
     for the altitude phase of the flight.
     5.21.1.7. If a malfunction occurs during a FCF, the MXG/CC may subsequently release
     the aircraft for flight providing the malfunction is not related to the condition generating
     the FCF, and the original condition operationally checked good.
     5.21.1.8. The OG/CC or deployed MC may authorize temporary waivers to FCF
     procedures for aircrew qualification when operationally necessary. Permanent waivers
     require MAJCOM/A3/DO approval IAW Chapter 1.
  5.21.2. (Added-3WG) . Functional Check Flight (FCF) Guidance:
     5.21.2.1. (Added-3WG) . Purpose. FCFs (to include operational check flights (OCF))
     are performed to ensure an aircraft is airworthy and capable of accomplishing its mission.
     FCFs are not normally flown when the airworthiness of the aircraft can be determined by
     maintenance operational checks prescribed by a technical directive.
     5.21.2.2. (Added-3WG) . Objective. Provide the OG/CC the means to designate FCF
     aircrews to ensure aircraft are airworthy and capable of accomplishing its mission.
        5.21.2.2.1. (Added-3WG) . The 3 OG/OGV is the OPR and fulfills the role of the
        officer in charge (OIC) for management and administration of the FCF program. In
        coordination with flying squadron leadership, 3 OG/OGV will submit FCF aircrew to
        the OG/CC for review of qualifications, experience, and certification.
        5.21.2.2.2. (Added-3WG) . Aircrews submitted to the OG/CC will consist of at
        least one OG-level evaluator pilot and loadmaster. Highly experienced unit
        evaluator/instructor aircraft commanders and loadmasters should be selected to
        complete the crew complement in order to gain experience in the FCF program.
     5.21.2.3. (Added-3WG) . Responsibilities:
        5.21.2.3.1. (Added-3WG) .          The 3d Maintenance Group Quality Assurance
        Inspection Office and the Aircraft-Owning Maintenance Squadron. These offices
        will notify the Maintenance Operations Center (MOC) and quality assurance of the
        time and date a specific aircraft will be flying an FCF. Request Plans and Scheduling
        coordinate with OG/OGV to schedule an FCF certified crew. Ensure the aircraft is
        configured to fly an FCF in accordance with applicable directives. Brief the flight
        crew as to the purpose of the FCF to include original discrepancy, all repairs made
        and past history of the suspect systems. Maintain an AF Form 2400, Functional
        Check Flight Log. Provide the FCF crew with an FCF kit (TO and checklist) and
        debrief the flight crew, at the aircraft, upon return from the FCF. Ensure the Aircraft
        Forms and FCF checklists are properly annotated in accordance with applicable
        directives. Ensure the completed FCF checklist is filed with the aircraft records for a
        period of 3 months or until replaced by a new FCF checklist, whichever is later.
AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010                                                              75


           5.21.2.3.2. (Added-3WG) . The 3 OG/OGV. Establish an FCF checkout training
           program. Training and rehearsal is to be accomplished in the simulator using the FCF
           profile identified in the FCF Certification Guide. If time and opportunity allow,
           highly experienced evaluators/instructors should be selected to obtain FCF experience
           on a local flight with a certified FCF crew. A copy of the guide can be obtained by
           contacting 3 OGV. Upon successful completion, the names will be submitted to the 3
           OG/CC on a certification letter for approval. Once certified, Squadron‘s will
           maintain a record of certification. In concert with squadron leadership, 3 OGV will
           recommend FCF crew complement after a thorough operational resource
           management (ORM) assessment for each FCF event. The OG/CC is the FCF crew
           approval authority and the waiver authority for all FCF-related training events.
           5.21.2.3.3. (Added-3WG) . The 3 OG/OGV will ensure all crewmembers identified
           as FCF crewmembers have received training in roles and responsibilities of both
           operations and maintenance personnel conducting FCF operations. As a minimum,
           ensure flying squadron leadership and FCF crews are briefed on their responsibilities
           and anticipated limitations.
       5.21.2.4. (Added-3WG) . Procedures. FCFs are performed only by FCF certified
       crews, supervised by Aircraft Maintenance Squadron, and monitored by Quality
       Assurance personnel to ensure all requirements are satisfied prior to the flight. Flight
       duration will be determined by the time required to check the systems causing the FCF to
       be flown. FCFs will be conducted in accordance with TO 1-1-300, Maintenance
       Operational Checks and Check Flights, and AFI 11-2C-17V3 weather requirements.
       5.21.2.5. (Added-3WG) . Airspace. All airspace will be properly coordinated and
       cleared by the controlling agency for the events to be accomplished.
       5.21.2.6. (Added-3WG) . Flight Crews. Accomplish the FCFs as briefed by the
       AMXS and in accordance with referenced directives. Enter all the discrepancies noted in
       the aircraft forms in a clear and concise manner and complete all applicable portions of
       the FCF checklist (TO 1C-17A-6CF-1, Acceptance and Functional Check Flight
       Procedures Manual). The Aircraft Commander will ensure the entire crew remains with
       the aircraft until a formal debriefing is completed.
5.22. Participation in Aerial Events. See AFI 11-209, Air Force Aerial Events, AFI 11-
246V6, Air Force Aircraft Demonstrations, and the appropriate MAJCOM supplement. Aerial
events must be sanctioned and individually approved by the appropriate military authority, and
the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). AFI 11-209 and AMC Supp 1 clearly identifies
events sanctioned for support, and specifies the approval authority for each type, AFI 11-209
also stipulates that units participating in aerial events will ensure activities are coordinated with
the FAA through the regional Air Force representative.
   5.22.1. (Added-3WG) . The 3 OSS/OSO is the OPR for coordination of air shows/flyovers
   with the users and higher headquarters. Aircrews participating in these events will work
   closely with the mission scheduler. The PIC will receive a briefing from current operations
   on event requirements.

      80G-27, Make Safe for Static Display C17A and abide by AFI 11-209. A copy of this TO
      and AFI is maintained in the C-17 E-Pubs.
      5.22.5.2. (Added-3WG) . Crewmembers will ensure guests do not tamper with aircraft
      components, smoke on or near the aircraft or leave behind foreign object damage (FOD).
      5.22.5.3. (Added-3WG) . If the forward emergency escape hatch and/or troop doors are
      opened for lighting and ventilation, install the nylon safety straps at each open exit.
      5.22.5.4. (Added-3WG) . If unable to comply with the above requirements, TO 00-
      80G-27 or AFI 11-209, restrict access to the cargo compartment or 10 feet away from the
      aircraft.
5.23. Not Used.
5.24. Traffic Alert and Collision System (TCAS). It is imperative to follow resolution
advisories (RAs) to obtain aircraft separation computed by TCAS. Failure to follow the
computed RA may increase the probability of a midair collision.
   5.24.1. Reaction to a traffic advisory (TA) or resolution advisory (RA). PNF will select the
   TCAS PPI display on a convenient MFD.
      5.24.1.1. PF duties during an RA.
          5.24.1.1.1. Press the autopilot disconnect to engage TCAS guidance.
          5.24.1.1.2. Promptly and smoothly maneuver to follow flight director guidance.
          Crosscheck the TCAS PPI display‘s vertical speed guidance and maintain the
          minimum vertical speed in the green band.
          5.24.1.1.3. Respond immediately to any ―increase‖ or ―reversal‖ RA maneuver
          advisories.
NOTE: The flight director is the primary guidance for RA maneuver. The CAWS alert may lag
behind the flight director guidance when multiple messages occur.
          5.24.1.1.4. If in a turn during an RA, continue with the turn while complying with
          TCAS advisories. If an ―increase climb‖ RA is issued, level wings prior to increasing
          climb rate.
          5.24.1.1.5. When ―clear of conflict‖ advisory announced, promptly and smoothly
          return the aircraft to its previously assigned (or amended) clearance.
AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010                                                             77


NOTE: The CAWS ―altitude‖ warning may disrupt or mask the ―clear of conflict‖ message. An
alternate means to determine when the aircraft is clear of conflict is when the FMAs revert back
to basic modes.
       5.24.1.2. PNF duties during an RA.
           5.24.1.2.1. Confirm the action being performed by the PF. Advise the PF of any
           deviation from the vertical path indicated by flight director guidance, the TCAS PPI
           display, and/or other annunciations.
           5.24.1.2.2. Clear airspace into which aircraft will maneuver.
           5.24.1.2.3. Advise ATC as soon as possible if you are deviating from your assigned
           clearance.
           5.24.1.2.4. When ―clear of conflict‖ advisory is announced, notify ATC you are
           returning to previously assigned clearance or acknowledge any amended clearance.
   5.24.2. Multi-ship formation.
       5.24.2.1. Lead aircraft (or designated alternates) will operate TCAS in the ―TA only‖
       mode. Consideration should be given to having the last aircraft in multi-element
       formations operating TCAS in ―TA only‖ mode.
       5.24.2.2. For formations utilizing SKE and TCAS overlay to verify formation position,
       all aircraft will operate TCAS in accordance with TO 1C-17A-1.
   5.24.3. Low-level operations. This system was not designed for use in the low level
   environment, but could provide valuable awareness of light aircraft or other military aircraft
   using military airspace. Use of ―TA only‖ mode is recommended.
   5.24.4. Air refueling operations. TCAS may be used to help acquire and track the tanker(s)
   during the rendezvous. Use ―TA only‖ mode inside the ARIP and be aware TCAS will be
   unavailable once the IFF is set to STBY.
   5.24.5. Additional information.
       5.24.5.1. If a GPWS or stall warning occurs, terminate the RA maneuver.
       5.24.5.2. Excessive climb and descent rates could lead to inadvertent TA/RA. Pilots
       should limit climb and descent rates when approaching the level off altitude.
       5.24.5.3. Use the above/below/normal settings as appropriate for the phase of flight and
       mission. Consideration should be given to selecting the below setting prior to tactical
       descents and while at high altitude cruise. This setting will help the crew clear for traffic
       in the event of an emergency descent.
   5.24.6. TCAS event documentation. The PIC will document all pertinent information
   surrounding an RA event on the AF IMT 657 HATR, and submit the report to the nearest air
   force safety office.
5.25. Radar Altimeter. Any crewmember detecting the ―TOO LOW‖ annunciation
(PFD/HUD) will immediately notify the pilot flying. Terrain clearance and aircraft position must
be verified.
 78                                              AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010


5.26. Buddy Starts. Buddy starts may be performed when approved by the OG/CC or
DIRMOBFOR. This authority may be delegated to the squadron or mission commander when
the unit is deployed. This authorization will not be construed to allow repeated buddy starts at
various scheduled en route stops.
5.27. Not Used.
5.28. Aircraft Recovery from Unprepared Surfaces. Aircrews will not normally attempt to
recover an aircraft after inadvertent entry onto unprepared surfaces not suitable for taxi; ground
crews will accomplish aircraft recovery. Unless an emergency dictates otherwise, aircrews may
only accomplish recovery if there is no aircraft damage, the surface will support the aircraft, and
the PIC has coordinated with appropriate MAJCOM headquarters maintenance authorities
through 18 AF TACC, or appropriate C2 agency.
5.29. Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) / Terrain Alert Warning System
(TAWS). The following escape maneuvers and flight crew procedures apply to aircrews flying
aircraft equipped with GPWS/TAWS. Exceptions to these policies are addressed in the ASRR.
   5.29.1. For operations in day VMC conditions, with terrain and obstacles clearly in sight, the
   PF will call runway and/or terrain in sight, state intentions and visually clear terrain.
   5.29.2. For operations at night or in IMC, if an aural warning is heard, immediately and
   simultaneously rotate the aircraft to establish a climb (FPV above the horizon line) while
   rolling wings level, and add maximum power until the warning has ceased and adequate
   terrain clearance is verified.
WARNING
Do not delay pull-up for diagnosis of the low altitude warning.
Failure to roll wings level during the maneuver described above will decrease stall margin at
heavy aircraft gross weights.
   5.29.3. Ensure the mode of the GPWS/TAWS is commensurate with the aircraft‘s phase of
   flight.
5.30. Use of Automation. Use appropriate levels of automation as required by the flight
conditions. The first priority is to fly the aircraft. The Automatic Flight Control System (AFCS)
and Mission Computer (MC) are intended to aid in workload management, not complicate it. As
the flight situation changes, do not feel locked into a level of automation.
   5.30.1. Avoid the following common pitfalls associated with over-reliance, misuse, or
   misunderstanding of automation.
       5.30.1.1. Fixating on the automation. One pilot should always remain heads up. Establish
       clear roles for computer related tasks. Announce ―pilot heads down‖ or ―copilot heads
       down‖ when the task requires focusing significant attention on the mission computer in
       flight.
       5.30.1.2. Misprioritizing programming tasks. Extensive reprogramming during critical
       phases of flight or during periods of high workload should be avoided.
       5.30.1.3. Mode awareness. The pilot flying (PF) should make AFCS panel changes
       during coupled operations. During uncoupled flight, the PF should direct the pilot not
AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010                                                         79


       flying (PNF) to make changes to the AFCS panel. Confirm all mode changes by
       observing the correct flight mode annunciator (FMA) indications. Engagement of the
       autopilot and autothrottles should be announced.
       5.30.1.4. Assuming automation is programmed correctly. Pilots will back up each other
       when making AFCS panel settings or programming the MC.
       5.30.1.5. Over-reliance on automation. Practice flight operations at all levels of
       automation to be proficient. If the automation is not performing as expected, take over
       manually.
5.31. Standard AFCS Terminology. Under certain conditions, complete commands may be
required. This would require an action, the proper axis, then the setting, e.g., ―SELECT
HEADING 060.‖
   5.31.1. SELECT or ENGAGE directs the selection of a value on the AFCS panel which
   results in the value being placed in the ―Engaged‖ (Top) portion of the FMA. SELECT is
   normally used with rotary knobs labeled ―SEL,‖ however, ENGAGE is acceptable. The FD,
   TOGA, APPR, ATT, AD, AP, AT are normally engaged. For added clarification, selecting
   an EPR rating means pressing a thrust rating button on the SED panel; engaging EPR means
   pressing the AFCS ―EPR‖ pushbutton.
   5.31.2. ARM directs the selection of a value on the AFCS panel which results in the value
   being placed in the ―Armed‖ (Bottom) portion of an FMA.
   5.31.3. For LNAV and VNAV selections, command the actual value intended, not ―ARM
   LNAV‖ or ―ENGAGE VNAV.‖ For example, ―ARM VOR‖ or ―ENGAGE VPROF‖ are
   proper commands.
   5.31.4. Standard terminology is very precise, but can unnecessarily congest cockpit
   communication. In-flight context generally allows simplified direction and execution. For
   example ―ARM 10,000‖ is obviously an altitude command and does not require the noun
   ―altitude‖ to clearly communicate the PF‘s desires. Airspeeds appended with ―PITCH‖ or
   ―THRUST‖ are sufficiently clear and do not require the use of the noun ―speed.‖ VERT
   SPDS appended with ―UP‖ or ―DN‖ are sufficiently clear. If requested by the PF, ATC
   vectors (headings) may be automatically selected, and altitudes automatically armed by the
   PNF. At any time the PNF is unsure of the command, he/she will ask for clarification. If the
   PF sees an uncommanded FMA, he/she will clearly restate the command and ensure the
   actual value is made.
5.32. C-17 HUD/MFD Endorsement. The C-17 MFD is certified as a single medium display,
and may be used as a primary flight reference (PFR). Due to the lack of a full-time attitude
reference, the heads up display (HUD) is endorsed as a PFR as long as one primary flight display
is present on an MFD. To the maximum extent possible, keep a primary flight display (PFD) on
one of the MFDs at all times. When mission requirements dictate, the PFD may be replaced with
another display for short periods of time.
5.33. C-17 Engine Start Policy. If available, maintenance personnel should act as ―ground‖
during engine starts. Any C-17 crewmember may also fulfill this requirement. If no maintenance
personnel are available and crew duties limit the availability of a crewmember, the engines may
 80                                            AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010


be started without someone outside the aircraft. If this option is used, ensure all crewmembers
are thoroughly briefed.
5.34. (Added-3WG) . Aircraft Cleanliness. Aircrews will make every effort to keep the
flight deck, crew rest, and galley area clean. Aircrews will stow sidewall seats and life
preservers before departing the aircraft.
5.35. (Added-3WG) . Passing Liquids. All liquids passed to the pilot or copilot will be
passed around their outside shoulder and not over the center console. In addition, to prevent
water damage to electronic components, crews will ensure cockpit windows are closed prior to
departing the aircraft.
5.36. (Added-3WG) .         The order of preference for ERCC location will be as
follows: Taxiway Delta abeam the Hot Cargo Pad, the JMC ramp, Hardstand 27, Taxiway Mike
in front of the JMC. If none of the preferred locations are available, the crew will coordinate
with ground control for an acceptable location.
AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010                                                        81

AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010                                                         83


6.3. Pre-mission Actions.
   6.3.1. Before transiting areas outside the CONUS, aircrews will review theater-specific
   information necessary to successfully operate there. The review should include (but is not
   limited to):
   6.3.2. Airspace/Airfield Review. FLIP, FIR/UIR/ADIZ procedures.
   6.3.3. Airspace classifications, GDSS/GDSS2/ASRR, Giant Report, and airport qualification
   videos (if available).
   6.3.4. Organized Track Systems. Minimum Navigation Performance Specifications (MNPS)
   Airspace requirements; North Atlantic and Pacific Region Track Systems procedures.
   6.3.5. Review tasking, itinerary, and altitude reservation (ALTRV) requirements.
   6.3.6. Review applicable OPORD, SPINS, Virtual Risk Assessment (VRA), Country Risk
   Assessment (CRA), and FLIP.
      6.3.6.1. (Added-3WG) . Aircraft commanders are required to review the applicable
      operational orders (OPORD) in its entirety prior to leaving home station. Classified
      portions of the OPORD can be viewed at squadron intelligence offices and OSS/IN.
      Mobility bag and arming requirements change via the OPORD and need to be identified
      by the PIC prior to crew show.
   6.3.7. Review the FCG for areas of operation (to include classified portion). Obtain
   necessary diplomatic clearances where required.
   6.3.8. Obtain required customs forms.
   6.3.9. Coordinate with combat crew communications for worldwide FLIP and sufficient
   communications security (COMSEC) materials for the duration of the mission.
   6.3.10. Ensure physiological training, annual physical, immunizations, and flight evaluations
   will remain current throughout the TDY period.
   6.3.11. Ensure visas have been received, if required.
   6.3.12. Obtain terrain charts for unfamiliar destinations if available.
   6.3.13. Compile sufficient spare forms, flight orders, etc. to cover the TDY period.
   6.3.14. Release available seats to passenger terminal.
   6.3.15. Consider and factor in foreseeable safety risks and risk mitigation factors in
   accordance with Operational Risk Management (ORM).
   6.3.16. (Added-3WG) . Mission Planning:
      6.3.16.1. (Added-3WG) . Local Training and JA/ATT Missions. Crews will meet in
      the designated planning room no later than the working day prior to mission execution.
      Loadmasters will attend mission planning or coordinate training requirements with the
      aircraft commander prior to mission planning. A planning day is required if a low-level
      route, airdrop, or formation air refueling (A/R) is part of the mission profile.
 84                                               AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010


           6.3.16.1.1. (Added-3WG) . When airdrops are to be conducted outside of a
           restricted area, the lead pilot/mission commander will coordinate with the user to
           ensure a NOTAM is published prior to mission execution.
           6.3.16.1.2. (Added-3WG) . In order for operations supervisors to have better
           oversight of training missions, Aircraft Commanders need to present their plan for the
           training sortie to the authority signing orders, prior to orders being signed. The day
           prior to your training mission, send an email during mission planning to the 517 AS
           ADO mailbox with your plan for the training sortie. For Example, TOGO 41 (call
           sign in subject line): Ground ops, AR505, drop-in @ Fairbanks, NVG Assaults @
           PAED (code for Elmendorf). Specifics to include should be A/R, assaults, NVG ops,
           low-levels and if there are any currency issues.
       6.3.16.2. (Added-3WG) . Operational Missions. Aircraft commanders will review
       mission tasking FRAG and ensure sufficient planning and coordination is accomplished
       prior to entering pre-mission crew rest to complete any assigned mission regardless of
       complexity.
6.4. Aircrew Publications Requirements. Aircraft commanders will ensure the publications
specified in Table 6.1 are carried on all missions. ―P‖ designates the publication is required to be
carried in paper format. ―D‖ designates the publication may be carried in either paper or digital
format. If publications are carried in a digital format, the unit will provide the media to view the
digital publications. The unit may specify additional publications in their unit supplement to this
instruction.
   6.4.1. (Added-3WG) . Crews are required to carry a consolidated trip kit (CTK) on board
   the aircraft for all missions. The CTK contains all of the required paper publications as well
   as a government laptop loaded with the current E-Pubs file for other publications. The
   aircraft commander and primary loadmaster will be responsible for ensuring these
   publications are on board and current. Crewmembers are required to maintain and carry
   individual crewmember checklists and inserts. Pilots are required to carry the 3rd Wing In-
   Flight Guide and the 3rd Wing In-Flight Guide C-17A Supplement on local training missions
   only.

6.5. Airfield Review. Aircrews will consult the web-based airfield database maintained by HQ
AMC/ A36AS (Airfield Suitability Branch) and comply with the GDSS/GDSS2/ASRR for
updates to airfield operability and weight bearing capacity.
6.6. Aircrew Intelligence Briefing. Before leaving home station on missions departing the
United States, crews will receive an intelligence briefing that will emphasize terrorist, enemy,
and friendly political and military development in the area in which they will be flying. Crews
must also receive an intelligence brief prior to entering specific area of operations (AOR). In
theater, aircrews should receive intelligence updates on initial arrival at a forward operating
location (FOL), or en route stop, and thereafter when significant developments occur. Report
information of possible intelligence value to the local intelligence officers as soon as possible to
ensure timely dissemination of mission reports (MISREPs) at the completion of each mission.
   6.6.1. (Added-3WG) . The PIC will schedule pre-mission briefings at least 48 hours prior
   to launch by calling 517 AS Intel (primary) or 3 WG Intel (secondary). Intel hours of
   operation are 0730-1630, Monday through Friday.

6.12. Briefing Requirements.
   6.12.1. Pre-Departure Briefing Items. The PIC will contact the local C2 agency to confirm
   mission requirements. The PIC and controlling agency jointly share responsibility to identify
   special briefing requirements. Briefings may include buffer zone, electronic warfare
   activities, SAFE PASSAGE, Electromagnetic Interference (EMI), diplomatic clearance,
   hazardous cargo, anti-hijacking procedures, operations and safety supplements to flight
   manuals, and OPORD procedure.
   6.12.2. Pilot in Command Briefing. Cover all applicable items of the operations briefing,
   including MAJCOM, NAF, unit Special Interest Items (SIIs), and ORM level. Brief
   crewmembers on the specific mission details if not previously accomplished. Use MAJCOM
   approved briefing guides. For tactical missions, additional briefings may be required.
   Reference AFTTP 3-3.35A chapter 2 for additional briefing information.
       6.12.2.1. In the en route system, the PIC will ensure that an aircrew briefing is conducted
       prior to the first sortie of the day. As a minimum, brief crewmembers on specific mission
       details for that day's sortie(s) and the ORM level for the mission. Complete this briefing
       prior to engine start.
       6.12.2.2. NVG Briefing Requirements. For missions conducting NVG operations crews
       will review and coordinate NVG failure procedures for all phases of the mission. Any
       crewmember who experiences NVG problems will inform the rest of the crew. If unable
       to regain the use of NVGs, the PIC will consider crew experience, mission priority, and
       Intel, tactics and threat briefings in determining if the mission can be completed safely.
       During cargo compartment emergencies, return to normal lighting until the emergency is
       resolved. Discuss actions for Smoke and Fumes in the aircraft.
   6.12.3. Specialized Briefing. Use specialized briefings to detail operating procedures or SIIs
   peculiar to various crew positions, and to answer questions relating to those specialties. Use a
   MAJCOM approved specialized briefing guide.
AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010                                                               89


   6.12.4. Weather Briefings. The PIC will obtain a briefing on current weather, trends, and
   forecast for the proposed route, destination, and alternates. The PIC will brief primary
   crewmembers on appropriate weather conditions before departure.
       6.12.4.1. Aircrews flying flight-managed sorties will use the weather briefing provided
       with the IFM aircrew departure papers. Local weather flights/agencies may update local
       takeoff weather data, but aircrews, working through their flight manager/dispatcher, will
       use 18 AF TACC weather operations (or the Operational Weather Squadron (OWS)
       supporting the theater AMOCC) as the final arbiter for weather-related issues and further
       updates.
       6.12.4.2. On sorties not planned by a flight manager, crews should obtain weather
       information from their local weather flight or the OWS responsible for weather support at
       their location.
       6.12.4.3. If adequate services are not available, and the crew cannot contact their home
       weather flight, OWS, or 18 AF TACC weather operations, obtain weather through any
       means available prior to mission accomplishment.
       6.12.4.4. Weather information is permitted from US Military weather services, any
       FAA-approved weather source, or any host nation civil or military weather source.
       6.12.4.5. Verbal weather briefings are authorized for local flights. Face-to-face briefings
       are not required.
   6.12.5. Buffer Zone. Prior to operating an aircraft within or adjacent to an established buffer
   zone, the PIC will ensure primary crewmembers are briefed on current buffer zone
   procedures outlined in appropriate directives.
   6.12.6. Peacetime and Wartime SAFE PASSAGE Procedures. Pilots must be familiar with
   peacetime and wartime safe passage of friendly military aircraft (if applicable).
   6.12.7. IFM Briefing. PICs will thoroughly review the aircrew departure papers provided for
   IFM sorties. When time and circumstances permit, the PIC, or designated representative, will
   contact the flight manager before signing the flight plan.
       6.12.7.1. (Added-3WG) . Integrated flight management (IFM) products do not contain
       secure information from the air tasking order (ATO) or special instructions (SPINS).
       Tactical routings and threats must be reviewed prior to departure. Crews will contact
       Intel/Tactics prior to departure as required.
6.13. Call Signs.
   6.13.1. Training Missions. Aircraft will use the unit static call sign prefix followed by a 2-
   digit suffix assigned by the parent unit.
   6.13.2. Operational Missions. Use call signs assigned by OPORD, FRAG, or diplomatic
   clearance. If no call sign has been assigned, use unit static call signs. When flying AMC
   missions, and no other call sign had been assigned, use the ―REACH‖ call sign followed by
   the last digit of the year the aircraft was built and the last 3 digits of the aircraft tail number
   (or as required by diplomatic clearance). To complete flight plans, put the letters "RCH"
   followed by the last digit of the year the aircraft was built and the last 3 digits of the aircraft
   tail number.
 90                                              AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010


   EXCEPTION: For aircraft 97000041 through 97000045 use RCH 9741 through 9745.
   6.13.3. The Reach 01 and 18 call signs are reserved for the AMC/CC and 18 AF/CC.
   6.13.4. Aeromedical Evacuation (AE). For actual AE missions, use the call sign ―Evac"
   followed by the five-digit aircraft number (example, Evac 12345) or mission designator.
   Refer to FLIP GP Chapter 4. When the AE portion of the mission is completed, normal call
   signs will be used. This does not alleviate the responsibility to use diplomatically cleared call
   signs when required.
6.14. Not Used.
6.15. Flight Plan/Data Verification. All waypoint data retrieved from a database should be
verified by latitude/longitude from current FLIP, or by verifying bearing/distance from the
mission computer matches the computer flight plan, or similar document, for each waypoint
entered. Reference paragraph 11.2 for additional procedures
6.16. Departure Planning. Use AFI 11-202V3, AFMAN 11-217V1, Instrument Flight
Procedures, this chapter, and the appropriate MAJCOM supplements. Regardless of the type of
departure flown (IFR/ VFR), review the following (as appropriate): IFR Departure Procedure,
instrument approach plate, NOTAMS, GDSS/GDSS2/ASRR Giant Report, and suitable terrain
charts.
   6.16.1. VFR Departures.
NOTE: VFR departures will not be flown in lieu of obstacle clearance planning.
       6.16.1.1. VFR departures are authorized when there is no authorized IFR departure
       method for the airport, when the aircraft cannot depart using one of the IFR departure
       methods contained in AFI 11-202V3 and AFMAN 11-217V1, when operational
       requirements dictate (i.e. tactical necessity), or when most of the mission is planned as a
       VFR flight for training. VFR departures require detailed planning to ensure obstacles and
       high terrain are avoided.
       6.16.1.2. The minimum climb performance for VFR departures is determined by
       ensuring all the following conditions are met:
          6.16.1.2.1. All-engine climb capability ensures obstacle avoidance along the
          departure route.
          6.16.1.2.2. One Engine Inoperative (OEI) climb capability shall ensure departure or
          emergency return route provides obstacle avoidance.
NOTE: If unable to comply with any of the above conditions, download cargo/fuel or delay until
conditions that are more favorable exist.
       6.16.1.3. Refer to FLIP for host nation VFR requirements before flying VFR outside of
       CONUS.
       6.16.1.4. When departing VFR, maintain VFR cloud clearances until obtaining an IFR
       clearance or reaching the IFR MEA.
   6.16.2. IFR Departures: Aircrews must use an approved IFR departure method as outlined in
   AFI 11-202V3 and AFMAN 11-217V1.
AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010                                                            91


       6.16.2.1. If the airport does not have an authorized IFR departure method, depart VFR
       IAW paragraph 6.16.1 An IFR departure is not authorized at airfields without an
       instrument approach.
       6.16.2.2. IFR departures require detailed planning to ensure obstacles and high terrain
       are avoided. Adhere to screen height/departure end of runway (DER) requirements for
       IFR departure planning (AFMAN 11-217V1).
NOTE: Screen height requirements for departures depend on the agency that wrote the departure
and/or the airfield where the departure is being flown. There is no standard or easy way for crews
to determine screen height requirements. Therefore, when using departures other than those
listed below, or when any doubt exists about which screen height to use, plan to cross the DER at
35 feet (minimum) unless you can ascertain a different screen height requirement from an
appropriate authority.
           6.16.2.2.1. Special Departure Procedure: Published on SDP.
           6.16.2.2.2. USAF/USN produced SID or USAF/USN/USMC airfield: Zero feet.
           6.16.2.2.3. US Army, FAA SID, and Joint Use Airfield within the US: 35 feet unless
           published.
           6.16.2.2.4. NATO Countries (except US and Canada) Military Airports: 35 feet.
           6.16.2.2.5. NATO Countries (except US and Canada) Civil Airports: 16 feet or as
           published.
           6.16.2.2.6. Other ICAO nations: 16 feet or as published.
           6.16.2.2.7. All others: 35 feet unless published.
       6.16.2.3. Aircraft must meet the published climb gradient for the departure runway with
       all engines operating. If no minimum climb gradient is published, 200 ft/nm will be used.
NOTE: In the event the aircraft is unable to meet the published ALL ENGINE climb gradient,
download cargo/fuel or delay until more favorable conditions exist.
       6.16.2.4. Use one of the following methods to ensure the aircraft can vertically clear all
       obstacles along the planned departure route with OEI:
           6.16.2.4.1. Special Departure Procedure (SDP). SDPs are MDS-specific OEI escape
           procedures intended only for emergency use. They are applicable after the loss of an
           engine and, where available, will be used for engine-out departure planning. Retrieve
           current SDPs from the Jeppesen AF Opsdata website. ‗Ad hoc‘ requests for fields not
           currently listed may be requested through OGV. OGV will forward requests to HQ
           AMC/A37V NLT 48 hrs prior to scheduled departure. HQ AMC/A37V authorizes the
           use of Ad Hoc SDPs for a maximum of 30 days after the analysis date. The SDP
           analysis date is located in the upper left-hand corner of the takeoff performance sheet.
           6.16.2.4.2. Minimum climb gradient. The TERPS standard minimum climb gradient
           is 200 ft/ nm, which is based on the standard obstacle clearance surface (OCS) of 152
           ft/nm plus the required obstacle clearance (ROC) of 48 ft/nm. If an SDP is not
           available, the crew must ensure compliance with any obstacle-based minimum climb
           gradients for the selected departure, with one-engine inoperative. Minimum climb
 92                                             AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010


             gradients may be published as a ‗Trouble T‘ restriction in the IFR Take-off
             Minimums section of FLIP or on a SID. When required for mission accomplishment,
             crews may subtract 48‘/nm from published climb gradients before computing engine-
             out takeoff data. Minimum climb gradients do not take into account low, close in
             obstacles (obstacles or terrain 200‘ AGL and below) which should normally be
             published as a NOTE on the SID or IFR departure procedure (Trouble T). Crews
             must also ensure the aircraft can clear these close in obstacles.
             NOTE: If the requirements of 6.16.2.4. cannot be met, download cargo/fuel or delay
             until more favorable conditions exist.
6.17. Weather Minimums for Takeoff. Departures with weather below landing minimums is
authorized IAW AFI 11-202 Vol 3, Ch 8. When weather is below approach and landing
minimums (ceiling and visibility) a departure alternate is required (see paragraph 6.19). For
operational missions, touchdown RVR must be at least 1200 and roll out RVR must be at least
1000, for all others it is 1600, see Table 6.3 for additional guidance.

Table 6.3. Weather Minimums for Takeoff.
Mission         Visibility    Remarks
Operational     RVR           When RVR is less than 1600, but equal to or greater than RVR 1000,
                1200/1000     the crew may take off if mission priority dictates, provided the
                              runway has dual RVR readouts and displays a minimum of RVR 1200
                              on the touchdown end and RVR 1000 on the rollout end and runway
                              centerline lighting is operational. For any takeoff below RVR 1600,
                              the crew must be fully qualified.
All Others      RVR 1600      Touchdown RVR will be used to determine visibility requirements
   6.17.1. If no RVR readout is available for the departure runway, visibility must be reported
   to be 1/2 mile (800 meters).
6.18. Alternate Planning. Select alternate airports meeting the requirements of AFI 11-202V3.
Choose alternates that best meet mission requirements and conserve fuel; they should not be
within the same terminal area, if terminal forecasts are marginal. Select alternates that are not
restricted by FLIP, FCG, or diplomatic clearances, and are compatible with the mission load and
performance characteristics of the aircraft. The PIC retains final authority in the choice of
alternates; however, selection by support agencies normally should be used if they meet the
above criteria and the aircraft has already been serviced.
6.19. Departure Alternates.
   6.19.1. A departure alternate is required if ceiling or visibility is below landing minimums
   for an available approach (at departure aerodrome). Do not use Category II ILS minimums to
   determine if a departure alternate is required.
   6.19.2. Suitability of Departure Alternates. When a departure alternate is required, the
   aircraft must be capable of maintaining the MEA or minimum obstruction clearance altitude
   (MOCA), whichever is higher, to the alternate using OEI performance criteria. To qualify as
   a departure alternate, the airfield must meet one of the following conditions:
AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010                                                             93


       6.19.2.1. Existing weather at an alternate within 30 minutes flying time must be equal to
       or better than the published approach minimums and forecast to remain so until 1 hour
       after takeoff, but in no case forecast to be lower than 200-1/2 (RVR 2400), or;
       6.19.2.2. The existing weather at an alternate within 2 hours flying time must be at least
       500-1 above the lowest compatible published approach minimums, but not less than 600-
       2 for a precision approach or 800-2 for a non-precision approach, and forecast to remain
       so for 1 hour after ETA at the alternate.
6.20. Destination Requirements (for filing purposes). The forecast destination weather will
be according to AFI 11-202V3 and the following:
   6.20.1. File two alternates when:
       6.20.1.1. The forecast visibility (intermittent or prevailing) is less than published for an
       available DoD or National Aeronautical Charting Office (NACO) precision approach.
       6.20.1.2. The forecast ceiling OR visibility (intermittent or prevailing) is less than
       published for all other approaches. For approaches with no published ceiling requirement
       (for example Jeppesen approaches), the minimum required ceiling shall be computed by
       taking the published HAA or HAT and rounding it up to the nearest one hundred feet (or
       as determined by MAJCOM TERPs review). For example, a Jeppesen VOR approach
       with a published HAA of 642 feet would require a forecasted ceiling of 700 feet.
       6.20.1.3. The forecast surface winds (intermittent or prevailing) exceed limits corrected
       for RCR.
   6.20.2. File an alternate, regardless of forecast weather, when the departure or destination
   aerodrome is outside the CONUS. (EXCEPTION: Intra-theater flights outside CONUS that
   do not exceed 3-hours, comply with basic AFI 11-202V3.)
   6.20.3. A remote or island destination is defined as any aerodrome, which due to its unique
   geographic location, offers no suitable alternate (civil or military) within 2 hours flying time.
   The forecast weather at the remote or island destination must meet the following criteria:
       6.20.3.1. The prevailing surface winds, corrected for RCR, must be within limits at ETA
       and forecast to remain so for 2 hours thereafter, and
       6.20.3.2. The prevailing ceiling and visibility must be equal to or greater than published
       minimums for an available non-precision approach, for ETA plus 2 hours. However, if a
       precision approach is available, the ceiling or visibility may be intermittently below non-
       precision approach minimums (excluding ASR), but not below precision approach
       minimums (for ETA plus 2 hours).
NOTE: Use 1+15 holding fuel when filing to an island or remote destination. This includes the
normal 45 minutes of reserve/holding fuel, and 30 additional minutes in lieu of an alternate
   6.20.4. When filing to a destination where the alternate is located in Alaska or at latitudes
   greater than 59° North, use 1+15 holding fuel.
6.21. Adverse Weather.
   6.21.1. Flight into areas of forecast or reported severe turbulence is prohibited.
 94                                             AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010


      6.21.1.1. Crews should confirm the type of aircraft the forecast turbulence applies to, or
      what type of aircraft reported the encounter, to gain a more accurate picture for their
      route of flight. The C-17 is a category 3 aircraft for turbulence.
      6.21.1.2. The PIC is responsible for ensuring all passengers are seated, with seat belts
      fastened, when areas of moderate or greater turbulence are encountered or anticipated.
      WARNING: Serious injury may occur if passengers do not have their seat belts fastened
      and the aircraft encounters moderate or severe turbulence.
   6.21.2. Flight into areas of forecast or reported severe icing is prohibited. Prolonged
   operation, such as cruise flight or holding, in areas of moderate icing should be avoided.
   NOTE: Air Force Weather Agency technical note AFWA/TN 98/002, Meteorological
   Techniques, states that freezing drizzle is equivalent to moderate icing and freezing rain is
   equivalent to severe icing.
      6.21.2.1. Do not takeoff under conditions of freezing rain. Do not takeoff under
      conditions of freezing drizzle except when the aircraft has been properly de-iced/anti-iced
      IAW flight manual procedures.
      6.21.2.2. Freezing precipitation, snow, freezing fog, or temperatures near 0°C, may cause
      ice or frost to accumulate on aircraft surfaces. When an aircraft requires de-icing/anti-
      icing prior to takeoff, refer to the following:
          6.21.2.2.1. Aircrews will only use de-ice and anti-ice fluids listed in their respective
          flight manual. Aircrews will be familiar with, and follow all restrictions in their
          associated flight manual with respect to anti-ice/de-ice procedures and holdover
          times.
          6.21.2.2.2. MIL-A-8243 Type I and Type II de-icing fluids do not provide any anti-
          icing benefit, and therefore do not have holdover times. As a guide, for approved anti-
          icing fluids, crews may use published anti-icing holdover times IAW TO 42C-1-2,
          Aircraft Anti-icing Procedures, and AFFSA holdover tables located at the HQ
          AFFSA website. The holdover time begins when anti-icing fluid is first applied and
          the PIC shall use time, temperature, and dilution of mixture to determine when times
          are exceeded and re-apply fluid if required.
          6.21.2.2.3. In all cases, PICs will ensure a visual inspection of the aircraft is
          completed within 5 minutes of departure.
   6.21.3. Do not fly directly above (within 2,000 feet) thunderstorms or cumulonimbus clouds.
   If unable to vertically clear thunderstorms or cumulonimbus clouds by at least 2000 feet,
   avoid them by at least:
      6.21.3.1. 20NMs at or above flight level FL230.
      6.21.3.2. 10NMs below FL230.
      6.21.3.3. 5NMs for tactical low-level operations provided the outside air temperature is
      at or above 0°C at flight altitude.. Avoid gust fronts and winds preceding a rapidly
      moving thunderstorm.
CAUTION: Aircraft damage may occur 20NMs or more from any thunderstorms. Aircrews must
familiarize themselves with information on thunderstorm development and hazard.
AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010                                                             95


   6.21.4. The use of ground-based radar as a means of thunderstorm avoidance should only be
   used to assist in departing an inadvertently penetrated area of significant weather. It should
   never be considered a normal avoidance procedure. When relying exclusively on ground-
   based radar for weather avoidance, and the ground controller is unable to provide avoidance
   instructions, attempt to maintain VMC by:
       6.21.4.1. Changing routing.
       6.21.4.2. Diverting to alternate.
       6.21.4.3. Declaring an emergency and requesting priority assistance.
   6.21.5. Aircrews should avoid flying in areas of recently dissipated thunderstorms and
   advected clouds(horizontal movement of clouds caused by wind) downwind of
   thunderstorms.
   6.21.6. In order to minimize exposure to thunderstorm hazards when approaching or
   departing an airport in an area where thunderstorms are occurring or are forecast:
       6.21.6.1. Attempt to maintain VMC.
       6.21.6.2. Maintain at least 5NMs separation from heavy rain showers.
       6.21.6.3. Avoid areas of high lightning potential, i.e., clouds within plus or minus 5,000
       feet of the freezing level or plus or minus 8°C of the freezing level.
NOTE: Approaches or departures may be accomplished when thunderstorms are within 10NMs.
The thunderstorms must not be producing any hazardous conditions (such as hail, lightning,
strong winds, gusts fronts, heavy rain, wind shear, or microburst) at the airport, and must not be
forecast or observed to be moving in the direction of the route of flight (to include the planned
missed approach corridor, if applicable).
   6.21.7. When performing approaches and landings at locations where temperatures are 0°C
   or below, refer to the Flight Information Handbook (FIH) Section D, Temperature Correction
   Chart, to correct MDA, DH, and other altitudes inside the FAF.
   6.21.8. Do not fly into an area of known or forecast moderate or greater mountain wave
   turbulence.
   6.21.9. Significant Meteorological Information (SIGMET). National Weather Service in-
   flight weather advisories are not limiting to Air Force aircraft. Contact the nearest military
   weather facility or flight service station for details, if applicable.
   6.21.10. Volcanic Dust Precautions. Aircraft flight operations in areas of forecast or known
   volcanic activity or dust is prohibited. Plan all missions to avoid volcanic activity by at least
   20 NMs.
   6.21.11. Lightning Avoidance. The following conditions are most favorable for lightning
   strikes and prolonged flight in them should be avoided:
       6.21.11.1. Within 8°C of freezing.
       6.21.11.2. In clouds or in any intensity of precipitation or turbulence associated with
       thunderstorms.
   6.21.12. (Added-3WG) . Operations During Lightning Watches/Warnings:
96                                             AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010


     6.21.12.1. (Added-3WG) . Lightning Watches. Lightning watches are issues when
     the potential for lighting exists within 5 nautical miles (NM) of the airfield. There are no
     specific procedures for lightning watches, but a lightning watch is an important factor in
     planning the sequence of events for departure. Aircrews wishing to depart before the
     lightning passes through the area should plan to finish all ground operations (including
     engine start and block-out) within 30 minutes. If aircrews cannot block out within 30
     minutes, be prepared to cease operations as soon as lightning is within 5 NM of the
     airfield. If crews desire transportation to an alternate shelter, they should request
     transportation well before lightning reaches within 5NM of the airfield.
     6.21.12.2. (Added-3WG) . Lightning Warnings. Lightning warnings are issued for
     lightning within 5 NM of the airfield. Most flight line activities (maintenance, refueling,
     and so forth) will cease with the exception of aircraft taxi and some motor vehicle
     operations.
        6.21.12.2.1. (Added-3WG) . The PIC will not deplane passengers or crewmembers
        during a lightning warning.        Everyone will remain on board the aircraft.
        EXCEPTION: Situations may arise when the hazard and risk associated with
        personnel remaining on the aircraft outweigh the risk associated with lightning. PICs
        maintain authority to make appropriate time-critical, life and death decisions.
        Examples include aircraft fire/smoke/fumes in the aircraft, extreme aircraft induced
        health hazards, and so forth. Contact command post for immediate fire, medical, or
        transportation assistance. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES will aircrews deplane
        during a lightning warning for simple convenience or comfort.
        6.21.12.2.2. (Added-3WG) . Aircraft Operations Before Takeoff. Aircraft
        engines will not be started during a lightning warning. If the aircraft engines are
        already running, and the crew is advised of an impending thunderstorm, they may
        depart the airfield if it is safe to do so.
        6.21.12.2.3. (Added-3WG) . Aircraft Operations After Landing. If the warning
        is issued after landing, the PIC will coordinate with command post for a parking spot
        that does not require a block-in crew. If one is not available, the PIC will position the
        aircraft at an appropriate temporary location on the airfield. Do not deplane a
        crewmember for block-in or engine shutdown.
  6.21.13. (Added-3WG) . Local Cold Weather Operations:
     6.21.13.1. (Added-3WG) . When the observed equivalent chill temperature (ECT) falls
     below minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit, all outside ground maintenance and flying operations
     require OG/CC approval.
     6.21.13.2. (Added-3WG) . If local flying at the airfield (Elmendorf or Eielson) that
     controls the airspace is cancelled due to low equivalent chill temperatures, then the
     associated airspace will also be closed.
     6.21.13.3. (Added-3WG) . When ambient temperatures in military operations airspace
     (MOA), military training routes (MTR), restricted areas, or other training airspace fall or
     are forecasted over the next 24-hour period to fall to or below minus 50 degree
     Fahrenheit, that affected airspace will be closed by the scheduling agency.
AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010                                                           97


6.22. Operational Risk Management (ORM). ORM is a logic based, common sense approach
to making calculated decisions on human, material, and environmental factors before, during,
and after all operations. USAF policy on ORM is contained in Air Force Policy Directive 90-9,
Operational Risk Management. PICs will accomplish ORM worksheets IAW MAJCOM and
local guidance as part of preflight activities. (see paragraph 6.3.15)

Section 6C—Preflight

6.23. AFTO Forms 781, Series.
   6.23.1. Review AFTO Forms 781 series before applying power to the aircraft or operating
   aircraft systems. The exceptional release must be signed before flight. A maintenance officer,
   maintenance superintendent, or authorized civilian normally signs the exceptional release. If
   one of these individuals is not available, the PIC may sign the exceptional release. Ensure
   that the DD Form 1896, Jet Fuel Identaplate, and AIR card is aboard the aircraft.
   6.23.2. One-Time Flights. An aircraft may be released for a one-time flight with a condition
   that might be hazardous for continued use, provided the aircraft is airworthy for one flight to
   another station. Refer to T.O. 00-20-1, Aerospace Equipment Maintenance Inspection,
   Documentation, Policies, and Procedures, for downgrade authority and procedures. AFRC
   crews also see AFI 11-202V3/ AFRCSUP1. After the maintenance release is obtained,
   coordinate mission requirements with the controlling agency. The PIC‘s concurrence is
   required before the aircraft can be flown.
   6.23.3. For Red X clearing procedures at stations without maintenance support refer to
   paragraph 12.3
   6.23.4. (Added-3WG) .         The 3 OG Crews will make AFTO Form 781, ARMS
   Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document, extracts when operating other than 3rd Wing
   assigned aircraft. Retain the extracts and turn them in to your squadron upon return to home
   station. Complete the extract in accordance with AFI 11-401 or the 3 OG Forms Guide.
   6.23.5. (Added-3WG) . 3 OG Crews will make a certified copy of the aircrew AFTO Form
   781 when operating a 3rd Wing assigned aircraft, but not returning home station with that
   aircraft. (that is, flying a stage mission or maintenance input drop-off). Retain the copies
   and turn them in to your squadron upon return to home station.
   6.23.6. (Added-3WG) . In an effort to supply the aircraft manufacturer with adequate
   information on deficiencies and desired improvements to the weapon system, aircrews will
   make a write-up in the AF Form 781A identifying all discrepancies, regardless of the severity
   (that is, missing screws, inoperable light bulbs, and so forth). Crews must consistently and
   accurately write-up and deficiencies, otherwise the problems may not be resolved.
6.24. Aircraft Servicing and Ground Operations. Reference paragraph 12.4
6.25. Aircraft Recovery Away from Main Operating Base. Reference paragraph 12.6
6.26. Life Support Requirements.
   6.26.1. Oxygen. Oxygen on board for takeoff must be sufficient to accomplish the planned
   flight from the equal time point (ETP) to a suitable recovery base, should oxygen be
   required. Calculate crew requirements using the 100 percent Oxygen Duration Chart in the
 98                                              AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010


   flight manual. Calculate crew and passenger requirements based on flight at FL 250 from the
   ETP to the nearest suitable recovery base.
       6.26.1.1. Crewmembers occupying a crew station will have an oxygen mask connected
       and readily available for use from before engine start until engine shutdown.
       6.26.1.2. Normally, unpressurized flight will not be planned above 18,000 feet cabin
       altitude (except HALO). Aircrews required to fly unpressurized missions above 18,000
       will prebreathe 100 percent oxygen in accordance with AFTTP 3-3.35A. Reference TO
       1C-17A-1-4 for additional high altitude prebreathing restrictions.
   6.26.2. Rafts. On over water flights do not carry more passengers and crewmembers than life
   rafts will accommodate.
   6.26.3. Life preserver units (LPUs). The loadmaster will ensure an LPU is within easy reach
   of each seated passenger and aircrew member prior to takeoff on over water flights (outside
   gliding distance to land). Ensure the appropriate number and type of life preservers are
   aboard for over water missions carrying children and infants.
   6.26.4. Parachutes and Survival Kits:
       6.26.4.1. Aircraft will be configured with parachutes and ML-4 survival kits for
       contingency and airdrop missions.
           6.26.4.1.1. Operations Group Commanders retain the option of requiring parachutes
           and survival kits to remain onboard for other missions.
       6.26.4.2. Personnel performing duties near an open (or suspected open) door/hatch/ramp
       in-flight will be restrained by a safety harness, or be wearing a parachute. If a troop door
       and/or the door/ ramp is open and the aircraft is below 800 feet AGL or above 14,000 feet
       MSL, loadmaster(s) will wear a restraint harness. The restraint harness will be hooked up
       no further aft than fuselage station 1188.
       6.26.4.3. Either wear, or pre-fit and pre-position parachutes and helmets during specified
       combat conditions or exercises.
   6.26.5. (Added-3WG) . Helmets, oxygen masks and NVGs (If required).
6.27. Fleet Service. Ensure required fleet service items are aboard the aircraft early enough to
permit inventory prior to engine start.
6.28. Cargo Documentation. Proper cargo or mail documentation will accompany each load.
   6.28.1. Load Data Information (Applicable to AFRC/ANG completing 18 AF TACC-
   directed mission). At stations where there is no mobility air transportation function, the
   aircrew will collect the required load information on each leg, and submit it to the first
   station, which has such a function. The report will be submitted on AF IMT 4075, Aircraft
   Load Data Worksheet.
6.29. Procedures for Airlifting Hazardous Cargo. NOTE: Installed flares do not constitute
hazardous cargo. However, any additional loads of flares are not considered aircraft equipment
and shall be properly packaged and prepared IAW AFMAN 24-204.
   6.29.1. The term "hazardous cargo" as used in conjunction with airlift operations, applies to
   the following classes and types of materials covered by AFMAN 24-204, Preparing
AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010                                                           99


  Hazardous Materials for Military Air Shipment, and contains detailed instructions on
  packaging, marking, labeling, and certification requirements associated with the airlift of
  hazardous materials. Hazardous materials/cargo not properly packaged and documented in
  accordance with AFMAN 24-204 will be rejected for air shipment.
  6.29.2. Briefing Requirements. As a minimum, the PIC and/or designated crewmember must
  be briefed at the base of departure concerning onboard hazardous materials, including the
  following information: (Nuclear weapons, nuclear components, and inert devices are covered
  in AFI 11-299 (FOUO).
     6.29.2.1. Proper shipping name (PSN), Hazard Class or Division and United Nations

  6.29.3. Cargo documentation and loading procedures.
     6.29.3.1. The loadmaster will ensure proper documentation, certification and
     identification of cargo is furnished. AFMAN 24-204 contains detailed instructions on
     packaging, marking, labeling, and certification requirements associated with the airlift of
     hazardous materials.
     6.29.3.2. Hazardous materials/cargo falls into many categories and the utmost
     precautions must be observed when handling or transporting these items. Load all
     hazardous material to permit easy access in-flight without moving other cargo. Load
     jettisonable hazardous material to facilitate jettisoning. Adhere to the following
     appropriate safety precautions when loading hazardous cargo as appropriate:
         6.29.3.2.1. Ventilate the aircraft.

         aggregate gross weight exceeds 1,000 pounds (454 kgs).
      6.29.4.2. Border Clearance and Diplomatic (DIP) Clearances. Aircrews are required to
      check the Foreign Clearance Guide (FCG) for DIP Clearance requirements prior to
      departure on international flights transporting Hazardous Materials. If DIP Clearance is
      required the crew will verify that clearance has been granted prior to departure.
  6.29.5. Departure/Arrival Notifications.
      6.29.5.1. Prepare a departure message at stations when a C2 center is not available. The
      remarks section of the departure message will include: Class of hazardous material, DoD
      class or division for explosives, net explosive weight (NEW), and gross weight. If
      required, request special handling (e.g., isolated parking, security, technical escort teams,
      etc.).
      6.29.5.2. If estimated time en route (ETE) is less than 1 hour, or if other circumstances
      preclude timely message receipt at destination, notify the next destination of the ETA and
      information listed in paragraph 6.29.5.1 If available, C2 will relay required information to
      next destination.
      6.29.5.3. At least 30 minutes prior to ETA, check with destination to verify that
      hazardous material notification information, if required, was received.

         6.29.5.4.5. Net quantity of chemical ammunition and toxic substances.
         6.29.5.4.6. Special handling requirements.
  6.29.6. Aircraft Parking.
     6.29.6.1. Parking of aircraft carrying hazardous materials is the responsibility of the host
     airfield.
     6.29.6.2. The following is provided for information only:
         6.29.6.2.1. Aircraft transporting Division 1.1 and 1.2 explosives, nuclear weapons,
         and Hazardous Materials requiring a SAAM, i.e., Toxic Chemical Ammunition, are
         normally parked at remote (Hot) spots.
         6.29.6.2.2. Divisions 1.3/1.4 explosives may or may not require "HOT" spot parking
         depending on quantity of explosives.
         6.29.6.2.3. Transit aircraft with explosives, when cargo is not handled, may be
         parked at isolated locations other than "HOT" spots.
         6.29.6.2.4. Other hazardous materials normally do not require remote or isolated
         parking.
         6.29.6.2.5. Military installations are responsible for proper placarding of aircraft. If
         non-DOD airfields are used, it may be necessary for the aircrew to placard aircraft.
         Placards resemble hazard labels.
  6.29.7. Unscheduled Landing Due to In-flight Emergency. Transmit unclassified information
  to the appropriate ATC facility as follows:
     6.29.7.1. Nature of emergency and intent to land.
     6.29.7.2. Aircraft position and ETA.
     6.29.7.3. Number of personnel and location in aircraft.

6.30. Handling of Classified Cargo, Registered Mail, Mission Capable (MICAP) Parts,
Very, Very Important Part (VVIP), Forward Supply System (FSS) Shipments, and Courier
Material.
   6.30.1. MICAP, VVIP, sensitive cargo, courier materials, and registered mail moving within
   the normal airlift system are receipted at the on and offload stations using the air cargo
   manifest. For unit moves operated in accordance with Defense Transportation Regulation
   (DTR), Part III, Mobility, classified or sensitive cargo movement is normally manifested
   utilizing the DD Form 2130-2, or similar automated product, and will normally be
   accompanied by a unit courier. However, if classified/ sensitive unit cargo is offered without
   an accompanying courier, the DD1907, Signature and Tally Record, must be used.
       6.30.1.1. Defense Courier Service (DCS) couriers coordinating with the PIC are
       authorized to designate officer or enlisted, (E-5 and above) crewmembers on military
       aircraft as couriers to escort and safeguard courier material when other qualified
       personnel are not available. Qualified passengers, if carried, are designated before
       designating crewmembers. The following restrictions apply:
          6.30.1.1.1. Primary crewmembers will not be designated couriers without the consent
          of the PIC.
          6.30.1.1.2. Crewmembers on aircraft scheduled to make an extended en route stop at
          a location where DCS couriers cannot provide en route support will not be designated
          as couriers.
   6.30.2. During stops at en route locations supported by DCS stations, DCS couriers are
   required to meet designated couriers, guard and protect the material.
       6.30.2.1. During unscheduled en route stops crewmembers may place courier material in
       temporary custody of the following agencies in descending order of priority.
          6.30.2.1.1. DCS courier.
          6.30.2.1.2. TOP SECRET control officer of the US armed forces.
          6.30.2.1.3. US Department of State Diplomatic Courier.
          6.30.2.1.4. US Department of State activity.
          6.30.2.1.5. US military guards.
          6.30.2.1.6. US DOD civilian guards.
   6.30.3. If unable to follow the itinerary to the destination of the courier material, or material
   is lost, stolen or otherwise compromised, report circumstances to the nearest Defense Courier
   Station and notify the local US military commander or US Government activity.
   6.30.4. Life or death urgency shipments consist of biological or other medical supplies of
   such urgency that human life is dependent upon immediate receipt. Shipments will be
   manifested separately and the manifest annotated with the words LIFE OR DEATH
   URGENCY. All shipments will be handled on a hand-to-hand receipt basis, using either the
   air cargo manifest or the DD1907, for unit moves. The PIC, or designated representative, will
   be briefed on the urgency of the shipment and be made the custodian during flight.
AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010                                                             103


Section 6D—Departure

6.31. On Time Takeoffs. Mission departures are on time if the aircraft is airborne within -
20/+14 minutes of scheduled takeoff time or as specified in a MAJCOM supplement.
   6.31.1. Scheduled takeoff time may be adjusted to make good a time over target (TOT) or
   time of arrival (TOA). PICs shall notify C2 agency before takeoff to adjust the scheduled
   takeoff time.
   6.31.2. Early Departures. Early departures are authorized to prevent a delay due to weather,
   ATC restrictions, airfield or aircraft operational limitations, to adjust mission flow during a
   large-scale operation, or if approved through C2 channels provided the impact on local and
   downrange facilities and crew duty is evaluated.
6.32. NVG Departures.
   6.32.1. NVG Departure Weather Minimums. Weather minimums for NVG departures for
   crewmembers who are non-current and/or unqualified is 1500/3. Current and qualified NVG
   aircrews may fly NVG departures weather down to 600/2 (OG/CC or equivalent may
   approve down to 300/1). Crews must give careful consideration to potential hazards during
   the critical phase of flight. Other weather limitations are IAW this instruction and AFI 11-
   202V3. NVGs have inherent limitations which can further be reduced by poor weather
   conditions. Crews will consider weather conditions, moon illumination and position, sky
   glow at dawn and dusk, cultural lighting, and weapon/expendable effects when planning
   NVG operations.
   6.32.2. NVG Crosswind Limits for Departure.
      6.32.2.1. Runways 90-120 feet wide. Maximum allowable crosswind component is 15
      knots.
      6.32.2.2. Runways wider than 120. Maximum allowable crosswind component is 20
      knots. EXCEPTION: with OG/CC (or equivalent) approval, up to 30 knots crosswind
      component is authorized.
   6.32.3. NVG Malfunctions During Takeoff. During an NVG takeoff, if the PF experiences
   NVG failure, the takeoff may be continued at the discretion of the PIC; otherwise an abort
   will be initiated. Consider using the overt nose lights to continue the takeoff. If NVG
   malfunctions occur after Vgo, takeoff will be continued with the PF transitioning to IMC
   takeoff, transfer control of the aircraft as necessary. If either pilot‘s NVGs fail after takeoff,
   continue the climb out and follow the appropriate procedures for loss of NVGs. The PNF will
   be ready to immediately assume aircraft control if the PF experiences spatial disorientation or
   an NVG malfunction. Pilots must exercise sound and conservative judgment to continue
   NVG operations with aircraft malfunctions.
 104                                             AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010


Section 6E—En route

6.33. Flight Progress.
   6.33.1. Data entered into the MC will be verified by another pilot. Check both the coordinate
   information and the distances between waypoints against the flight plan.
   6.33.2. Crews will use the Master Document (Computer Flight Plan) and an appropriate
   plotting chart to plot all oceanic waypoints from entry to exit. As a minimum, annotate the
   chart with the mission number, PIC's name, and date. If practical, the chart may be reused.
   Retain the chart and master document in unit Stan/Eval for 120 days following mission
   completion.
   6.33.3. In-Flight, use all available navigational aids to monitor MC performance.
   Immediately report malfunctions or any loss of navigation capability which degrades
   centerline accuracy to the controlling ARTCC. Use the following procedures for flight
   progress:
       6.33.3.1. When possible, perform a gross error MC check using available NAVAIDs
       prior to, or immediately upon entering the Category I Route/over water segment.
       6.33.3.2. On a Category I route, when approaching each waypoint, recheck coordinates
       for the next waypoint.
       6.33.3.3. Approximately 10 minutes after each waypoint, plot aircraft position, and
       compare plotted position to expected track. Annotate latitude/longitude and time of plot.
       6.33.3.4. If revised clearance is received, record and plot the new route of flight on the
       chart.
   6.33.4. Operations in International/Territorial Airspace. (See FLIP, FCG, and AP, for further
   guidance). US military aircraft and DoD personnel entering another nation to conduct US
   government business must have the approval of the foreign government concerned to enter
   their airspace. Foreign clearances for US international air operations are obtained through US
   officials known as Defense Attaché Officers (DAOs).
       6.33.4.1. There are essentially two types of airspace: international airspace and territorial
       airspace. International airspace includes all airspace seaward of coastal states' territorial
       seas. Military aircraft operate in such areas free of interference or control by the coastal
       state. Territorial airspace includes airspace above territorial seas, archipelagic waters,
       inland waters, and land territory, and is sovereign airspace. Over flight may be conducted
       in such areas only with the consent of the sovereign country.
       6.33.4.2. Consistent with international law, the US recognizes sea claims up to 12NMs.
       Diplomatic constraints and/or a lack of diplomatic clearances usually result in missions
       operating in international airspace. Therefore, it is imperative sufficient information be
       provided far enough in advance to allow compliance with FCG requirements established
       by the countries concerned. The US does not normally recognize territorial claims
       beyond 12NMs; however, specific guidance from certain US authorities may establish
       limits, which differ from the standard.
       6.33.4.3. Flight Information Region (FIR). An FIR is an area of airspace within which
       flight information and related services are provided. An FIR does not reflect international
AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010                                                            105


      borders or sovereign airspace. Aircraft may operate within an established FIR without
      approval of the adjacent country, provided the AC avoids flight in territorial airspace.
      6.33.4.4. Aircrews on a flight plan route, which takes them from international airspace
      into territorial airspace, for which approved aircraft clearances were obtained, should not
      amend entry point(s).
      6.33.4.5. Violations of foreign sovereignty result from unauthorized or improper entry or
      departure of aircraft. Aircrews should not enter into territorial airspace for which a
      clearance has not been duly requested and granted through diplomatic channels.
      6.33.4.6. ATC agencies are not vested with authority to grant diplomatic clearances for
      penetration of sovereign airspace where prior clearance is required from the respective
      country. Aircraft clearances are obtained through diplomatic channels only.
      6.33.4.7. In the event ATC agency challenges the validity of a flight routing or attempts
      to negate existing clearances, ACs must evaluate the circumstances. The normal response
      will be to attempt to advise the ATC agency that the aircraft will continue to planned
      destination, as cleared in international airspace. The key phrase is "in international
      airspace." Safety of flight is paramount in determining mission continuation. Under no
      circumstances should aircrews construe a clearance, which routes their mission over
      sovereign airspace, which was not approved through diplomatic channels before mission
      departure, as being valid authorization.
      6.33.4.8. Aircrews operating missions requiring unique or specially developed routing
      will normally be briefed at home station, onload station, and/or by the last C2 facility
      transited before performing the critical portion of the mission.
      6.33.4.9. Aircrews (except on weather reconnaissance missions) normally are not tasked
      to and should not fly "due regard" routings unless coordinated with the appropriate
      MAJCOM C2 and specifically directed in the mission FRAG. The "due regard" or
      "operational" option obligates the military AC to be their own ATC agency to separate
      their aircraft from all other air traffic. If operational requirements dictate, ACs may
      exercise the "due regard" option to protect their aircraft. Aircraft will return to normal air
      traffic services as soon as practical.
6.34. Navigational Aid Capability. The following airspace categories are each defined in
FLIP, and are considered special qualification airspace: MNPS, RVSM, RNP, and BRNAV.
   6.34.1. Should any required equipment fail before entering such airspace, request a new
   clearance to avoid this airspace.
   6.34.2. Should any required equipment fail after entry into such airspace, immediately notify
   ATC and coordinate a plan of action.
   6.34.3. Document (in the aircraft forms) malfunctions or failures of required equipment,
   including the failure of this equipment to meet tolerances.
   6.34.4. Required Navigation Performance (RNP) Airspace. C-17 aircraft equipped with
   integrated GPS navigation systems are approved in RNP airspace without time limitations.
      6.34.4.1. RNP-10. If all updating capability is lost, C-17 aircraft are certified to operate
      for 6.2 hours (after entering NAV mode) in RNP-10 airspace. If any in-flight update is
 106                                             AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010


       accomplished (GPS or Radio Nav), the aircraft may continue in RNP-10 airspace until
       the figure of merit exceeds ―8‖ (approximately 6 hours after last update).
          6.34.4.1.1. Preflight Procedures. Review maintenance logs to ascertain status of
          RNP-10 equipment.
          6.34.4.1.2. En route. Before entering Oceanic Airspace, the aircraft position should
          be checked as accurately as possible by using external navigation aids (coast-out fix).
          Periodic crosschecks will be accomplished to identify navigation errors and prevent
          inadvertent deviation from ATC cleared routes. Advise ATC of the deterioration or
          failure of navigation equipment below navigation performance requirements and
          coordinate appropriate actions.
          6.34.4.1.3. Document (in the aircraft forms) malfunctions or failures of RNP required
          equipment, including the failure of this equipment to meet RNP tolerances.
   6.34.5. Basic Area Navigation (BRNAV) Airspace. BRNAV navigation accuracy criteria is
   RNP-5. C-17 aircraft with GPS UPDATE selected are approved for BRNAV operations with
   no restrictions. If GPS UPDATE is unavailable, select RADIO UPDATE and ensure the
   FOM remains 7 or better.
   6.34.6. Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum (RVSM) Airspace. Airspace where RVSM is
   applied is considered special qualification airspace. Both the operator and the specific aircraft
   type must be approved for operations in these areas. Pilots will refer to FLIP AP/2 and the
   following for RVSM requirements:
       6.34.6.1. Both primary altimeters, at least one autopilot, the altitude advisory system, and
       the transponder, must be fully operational. The AC will request a new clearance to avoid
       this airspace should any of this equipment fail.
       6.34.6.2. Engage the autopilot during level cruise.
       6.34.6.3. Crosscheck the altimeters before or immediately upon coast out. Record
       readings of both altimeters.
       6.34.6.4. Continuously crosscheck the primary altimeters to ensure they agree ± 200 feet.
       6.34.6.5. Limit climb and descent rates to 1,000 feet per minute when operating near
       other aircraft to reduce potential TCAS advisories.
       6.34.6.6. Immediately notify ATC if any of the required equipment fails after entry into
       RVSM airspace and coordinate a plan of action.
       6.34.6.7. Document in the aircraft forms malfunctions or failures of RVSM required
       equipment.
6.35. CIRVIS and Other Reports. Report all vital intelligence sightings from aircraft as
indicated in FLIP planning or FLIP En route Supplement.
   6.35.1. In-flight harassment or hostile action against C-17 aircraft. Aircraft subjected to
   harassment or hostile action by foreign aircraft will immediately contact the nearest USAF
   air and ground voice facility and report the encounter. Include aircraft nationality, type,
   insignia, or any other identifying features; note position, heading, time, speed when harassed,
AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010                                                            107


   and the type of harassment. Request relay of the report to the nearest C2 agency. Also,
   attempt to contact the nearest command post when in UHF and VHF range.
6.36. In-flight Meals. Pilots should not eat meals at the same time, and their meals should
consist of different menu items.
6.37. Communications. See paragraph 5.12
6.38. In-flight Emergency Procedures. The PIC shall report deviations from directives that
may occur as a result of an emergency according to AFI 11-202V3. Time and conditions
permitting, inform passengers of the situation and intentions as appropriate.
   6.38.1. Notification of Controlling Agencies. When practical after completing the aircraft
   emergency action checklists and associated actions, crews should furnish the controlling
   agency and appropriate C2 agencies with a description of the difficulty, assistance required,
   intentions, and any other pertinent information.
   6.38.2. The PIC may initiate a CONFERENCE HOTEL/SKYHOOK when additional
   expertise is necessary. Communications procedures are as follow:
       6.38.2.1. Local Area. When in UHF or VHF range, initiate the conference over
       appropriate frequencies.
       6.38.2.2. En route. When out of UHF range, use HF/AERO-I to establish a phone patch
       with the nearest or controlling C2 center as appropriate.
       6.38.2.3. Provide the following information when time permits.
           6.38.2.3.1. Narrative description of the situation to include actions taken by the crew
           and the intentions of the PIC.
           6.38.2.3.2. What assistance is being requested.
           6.38.2.3.3. Fuel on board and hours of endurance.
           6.38.2.3.4. Position.
           6.38.2.3.5. Altitude and flight conditions.
           6.38.2.3.6. Type cargo, number of personnel and distinguished visitors (DV) on
           board.
           6.38.2.3.7. Qualification of PIC.
           6.38.2.3.8. Planned landing base.
           6.38.2.3.9. ETA at landing base.
6.39. Need for Medical Assistance. When a person aboard the aircraft requires medical care,
the PIC will notify the station of intended landing in sufficient time so the aircraft may be met by
medical personnel. Notification will include the patient‘s sex, approximate age, and major
complaint.
6.40. Weather Forecasts. It is the pilot‘s responsibility to obtain destination weather prior to
descent. The primary sources are 18 AF TACC weather operations, OWSs, and USAF weather
flights via pilot-to-meteorologist service (PMSV) or through a USAF aeronautical station. For
aircraft flying in EUCOM AOR (ENAME operations) contact USAFE/OWS at Sembach AB
 108                                             AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010


GE. SOUTHCOM AOR contact 25 OWS at Davis-Monthan AFB, AZ. The ATC system can
provide weather information to en route aircraft.

Section 6F—Arrival

6.41. Descent. Before descent into unfamiliar areas, appropriate terrain charts ((Operational
Navigation Chart (ONC), Sectional Aeronautical Chart, Tactical Pilotage Chart (TPC), or Joint
Operations Graphic (JOG)) should be reviewed to increase aircrew situational awareness of
obstructions. Primary crewmembers will not be involved in duties other than aircraft operations,
descent and approach monitoring, and required checklist items from the initial descent point to
landing.
   6.41.1. Night and Marginal Weather Operations. Fly a precision approach, if available, at
   night or during marginal weather. If a precision approach is not available, fly any available
   approved instrument approach.
       6.41.1.1. A visual approach may be flown during night VFR conditions if an approved
       instrument approach to the landing runway is not available or operational missions
       require a tactical approach.
       6.41.1.2. On training/evaluation flights, pilots may fly non-precision approaches or VFR
       traffic patterns to accomplish required training and evaluations. The pilot not flying will
       monitor a precision approach when practical to enhance safety.
       6.41.1.3. For recovery at home station, pilots may elect to fly a visual or non-precision
       approach, if weather minimums permit.
6.42. Instrument Approach Procedures.
   6.42.1. Instrument approach RVR/visibility and, if required, ceiling minimums will be as
   published for a category "D" aircraft. If approach speeds exceed 165 knots, the minimums for
   category "E" will be used.
   6.42.2. Prior to starting an instrument approach, pilots will confirm their aircraft can comply
   with the missed approach climb gradient requirements established in AFI 11-202V3. If
   unable to meet required climb gradients, pilots must coordinate alternate missed approach
   procedures with ATC, which will ensure terrain clearance, prior to commencing the
   approach. If this is not possible, do not attempt the approach.
   6.42.3. Weather minimums. Before starting an instrument approach, or beginning an en
   route descent, pilots will confirm the existing weather is reported to be:
       6.42.3.1. At or above required visibility for straight-in or sidestep approaches.
           6.42.3.1.1. For PAR approaches, visibility will be no lower than RVR 2400 (730
           meters) or 1/ 2 mile visibility (800 meters) with no RVR readout available.
       6.42.3.2. At or above required ceiling and visibility for circling approaches.
           6.42.3.2.1. For circling approaches with no published ceiling requirement, the
           required ceiling shall be computed by taking the published HAA plus 100 feet
           rounded up to the next one hundred foot value. (For example, if the HAA is 747 feet,
           add 100 feet to get 847 feet and then round up to the next one hundred foot value
AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010                                                          109


          which would be 900 feet. Your ceiling for the approach must be at or above 900 feet.)
          When circling minimums are published, but not by category, circling approach
          minimums will be as published, but in no case lower than 600 feet and 2 miles
          visibility.
       6.42.3.3. Increase the published visibility minimums of an instrument approach by ½ SM
       or as noted in NOTAMs, on ATIS, or on the approach plate, when the runway approach
       lighting system (ALS) is inoperative. (This applies only to the ALS itself, not to VASIs,
       PAPIs, and other lights that are not a component of the ALS.)
       6.42.3.4. If ceiling is below the value depicted for published DoD or NACA precision
       approach, but visibility is at or above authorized minimums, the pilot will comply with
       fuel requirements of Chapter 14, prior to initiating en route descent, penetration, or
       approach.
   6.42.4. Flight Instrumentation Requirements.
       6.42.4.1. Aircraft are limited to a DH/MDA based on a HAT of 300-feet and RVR 40, or
       ¾-mile visibility (1220-meters) with no RVR if full flight instrumentation is not available
       and operational.
NOTES:
1. Full flight instrument for Category I ILS and precision approach radar (PAR) includes the
flight director, a HUD or PFD and NAV display at each station, and no shared ADC or IRU.
2. Full flight instrumentation for a CAT II ILS includes the flight director, a HUD or PFD and
NAV display at each station, and no ―No CAT II‖ warning message. A HUD will be used by the
PF position, if available.
   6.42.5. Category I ILS Procedures. Decision height for precision approaches will be as
   published, but no lower than 200 feet height above touchdown (HAT).
       6.42.5.1. ILS Precision Runway Monitor (PRM) Approaches. Both pilots must be
       certified to conduct an ILS PRM approach. Comply with the following operational
       procedures:
          6.42.5.1.1. Two operational VHF communication radios are required.
          6.42.5.1.2. The approach must be briefed as an ILS/PRM approach.
          6.42.5.1.3. If unable to accept an ILS PRM approach clearance, contact the FAA
          ATCSCC at 1-800-333-4286 prior to departure time to obtain a pre-coordinated
          arrival time. Pilots who arrive at a PRM airport unable to accept PRM approach
          clearance, who did not contact ATC prior to departure, should expect an ATC
          directed divert to a non-PRM airport.
          6.42.5.1.4. All breakouts from the approach shall be hand flown. Autopilots shall be
          disengaged when a breakout is directed.
          6.42.5.1.5. Should a TCAS Resolution Advisory (RA) be received, the pilot shall
          immediately respond to the RA. If following an RA requires deviating from an ATC
          clearance, the pilot shall advise ATC as soon as practical. While following an RA,
          comply with the turn portion of the ATC breakout instruction unless the pilot
          determines safety to be a factor.

   6.42.6. Category II ILS Procedures. DH is based on radar altitude. Minimum HAT is 100
   feet. Minimum RVR is 1200. Maximum crosswind limitation is 10 knots.
       6.42.6.1. Aircrews will not execute an actual Category II ILS to minimums unless both
       pilots are qualified and current in Category II ILS. The AC must have logged at least 100
       hours in command since AC qualification.
   6.42.7. NDB Procedures. NDB approaches may be flown during day, night, or IMC
   conditions after compliance with any airfield restrictions in GDSS/GDSS2/ASRR. Back up
   each approach with available navaids/GPS to include loading the NDB coordinates in the
   Mission Computer (MC).
   6.42.8. Established on a Segment of the Approach. When cleared for, or established, on a
   segment of the approach, and the weather is reported or observed to be below approach
   minimums, the PF has the option of continuing the approach to the missed approach point
   (MAP)/DH. If the approach is abandoned, level off (or descend if a lower altitude is required
   for the missed approach procedure). Comply with the last assigned clearance until a new or
   amended clearance is received. Do not continue a CAT II ILS if the weather is reported to be
   below CAT II minima.
       6.42.8.1. Do not continue the approach below minimums unless the runway environment
       is in sight and the aircraft is in a position to make a safe landing.
       6.42.8.2. If the approach is continued, sufficient fuel must be available to complete the
       approach and missed approach, and proceed to a suitable alternate with normal fuel
       reserve.
       6.42.8.3. The PIC has final responsibility for determining when the destination is below
       designated minimums, and for initiating proper clearance request.
   6.42.9. Holding. An aircraft may hold at a destination that is below landing minimums, but
   forecast to improve to or above minimums provided:
       6.42.9.1. The aircraft has more fuel remaining than that required to fly to the alternate
       and hold for the appropriate holding time, and the weather at the alternate is forecast to
       remain at or above alternate filing minimums for the period, including the holding time.
       6.42.9.2. Destination weather is forecast to be at or above minimums before excess fuel
       will be consumed.
6.43. NVG Approach and Landing.
   6.43.1. NVG Approach Weather Minimums. Weather minimums for NVG visual
   approaches and for crewmembers who are non-current and/or unqualified is 1500/3. Current
   and qualified NVG aircrews may fly IFR instrument approaches which transition to NVG
   landings with weather down to 600/2 (OG/CC or equivalent may approve down to 300/1) or
   approach minimums (whichever is higher). Crews must give careful consideration to
   potential hazards during the critical phase of flight. Other weather limitations are IAW this
   instruction and AFI 11-202V3. NVGs have inherent limitations which can further be reduced
   by poor weather conditions. Crews will consider weather conditions, moon illumination and
   position, sky glow at dawn and dusk, cultural lighting, and weapon/expendable effects when
   planning NVG operations.
AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010                                                         111


   6.43.2. NVG Crosswind Limits for Approach.
       6.43.2.1. Runways 90-120 feet wide. Maximum allowable crosswind component is 15
       knots.
       6.43.2.2. Runways wider than 120. Maximum allowable crosswind component is 20
       knots. EXCEPTION: with OG/CC (or equivalent) approval, up to 30 knots crosswind
       component is authorized.
   6.43.3. NVG Failures During Approach and Landing. If the pilot or copilot experience NVG
   failure or other malfunctions at or below 300 feet AGL, perform a go-around. If the PF‘s
   NVGs fail after touchdown, transfer aircraft control to the PNF for the landing rollout.
   Consider using the overt nose lights.
6.44. Unscheduled Landings. When an unscheduled landing or crew rest occurs at a base
without a passenger facility, the AC should immediately advise the appropriate C2 agency and
request assistance in arranging substitute airlift for passengers on board. The following
procedures apply when obtaining support for service members, in a group travel status, who are
transported on AMC organic aircraft flying a Transportation Working Capital Fund (TWCF)
mission, which incur an unscheduled delay due to weather or maintenance problems, forcing the
members to be lodged at that location until the aircraft can continue its mission.
   6.44.1. If the delay is at a location where DoD facilities and AMC TWCF funds are
   available, payment for lodging (contract or on-base) will be made by the local accounting
   liaison/OPLOC citing TWCF funds. The appropriate TWCF fund cite may be obtained from
   the local financial analysis and/ or accounting liaison office. Normally, a BPA contract or AF
   IMT 616 is already established at these locations to charge the routine lodging costs for
   transient or TDY individuals who are on TWCF funded travel orders.
   6.44.2. If the delay is at a location where DoD facilities are available and AMC TWCF funds
   are not available, utilize AF IMT 15, United States Air Force Invoice authority to acquire
   the appropriate lodging accommodations. Upon return to home station, the PIC will send the
   AF IMT 15 to the local accounting liaison office. A copy of the service members' group
   travel orders, along with any other pertinent supporting data, must accompany the form (e.g.,
   lodging invoice and/or receipts). When the AF IMT 15 has been validated, it will be
   forwarded for payment, citing the funds of the unit whose aircraft was delayed.
   6.44.3. If the delay is at a location where both DoD facilities and TWCF funds are
   unavailable, the PIC will utilize AF IMT 15 authority to acquire the appropriate meals,
   quarters, and transportation to support the service members. Upon return to home station, the
   PIC will send the AF IMT 15 to the local accounting liaison office. A copy of the service
   members' group travel orders, along with any other pertinent supporting data, must
   accompany the form (e.g., lodging invoice and/or receipts). When the AF IMT 15 has been
   validated, it will be forwarded for payment, citing the funds of the unit whose aircraft was
   delayed.
NOTE: This policy does not apply to those passengers on delayed TWCF organic aircraft who
are in a per diem or space available status, except for those duty passengers on TWCF funded
travel orders delayed at locations where TWCF funds are available.
 112                                             AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010


6.45. Maintenance Debrief. Complete the AFTO IMT 781 after each flight. After landing,
crewmembers debrief maintenance personnel on the condition of the aircraft, engines, airdrop
systems, avionics equipment, and all installed special equipment as required. At stations without
maintenance support, when a maintenance requirement exists the PIC will ensure a thorough
debrief is provided to the C2 agency. On AMC missions, notify 18 AF TACC Logistics Control
(TACC/XOCL).
   6.45.1. An entry will be placed in AFTO 781A, "Aircraft Subjected to Salt Spray" (state
   lowest altitude and duration) anytime the aircraft is flown under 1000 feet above sea except
   for takeoffs and landings.
   6.45.2. An entry will be placed in AFTO 781A, ―Aircraft Operated on Semi-Prepared
   Runway‖ (state number of landings and takeoffs accomplished on the semi-prepared
   runway).
   6.45.3. (Added-3WG) . Maintenance (MX) Debriefs.
       6.45.3.1. (Added-3WG) . Aircrews will contact CP 30 minutes prior to blocks and pass
       the following information:
           6.45.3.1.1. (Added-3WG) . Aircraft status (A1, A2, A3) – When returning from a
           mission include write ups from previous sorties, if applicable.
           6.45.3.1.2. (Added-3WG) . Identify any MX problems possibly requiring an engine
           run.
       6.45.3.2. (Added-3WG) . At home station, the PIC (or designated crewmember) will
       deliver the aircraft forms to maintenance debrief regardless of aircraft status.
           6.45.3.2.1. (Added-3WG) . Aircrews will annotate all fuel receipts received away
           from Home Station on the AF Form 664, Aircraft Fuels/Ground Servicing
           Documentation Log, and ensure all Fuel receipts are attached or put into the Form. T
           he AF Form 664 will be turned in at MX debrief when the aircraft has returned to
           home station. If receipts are found on the aircraft from previous crews and missions,
           annotate the AF Form 664 that receipts are included from previous crews.
6.46. Customs and Border Clearance.
   6.46.1. Normal operations.
       6.46.1.1. The unit dispatching the mission is normally responsible for the border
       clearance of its aircraft.
       6.46.1.2. Where designated personnel are not assigned, border clearance is the
       responsibility of the PIC. Duties may be assigned to ground personnel or to the
       loadmaster, but the PIC retains ultimate responsibility. When a C-17 aircraft is onloaded
       at a base without an air traffic function, the PIC is responsible for ensuring the following:
           6.46.1.2.1. Crewmembers, troops, and passengers possess current passports and valid
           visas, when required.
           6.46.1.2.2. Crewmembers, troops, and passengers have current certificates of
           immunization (shot record).
           6.46.1.2.3. Cargo entry documents are in proper order.
AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010                                                            113


         6.46.1.2.4. Departing or entering the United States through a location where border
         clearance can be obtained.
         6.46.1.2.5. Obtaining border clearance for aircraft cargo, passengers, crew and
         baggage, if required, before takeoff to a foreign area or after arrival from a foreign
         area.
         6.46.1.2.6. Spraying the aircraft (see the FCG and paragraph 6.47).
  6.46.2. Procedures for US Entry.
     6.46.2.1. En route, the loadmaster will distribute personal customs declarations (when
     not accomplished by passenger services) to all passengers, troops, and crewmembers. The
     loadmaster will also brief passengers and crewmembers on customs regulations, and
     prepare and compile necessary border clearance forms for the PIC's signature.
     6.46.2.2. En route, notify the C2 agency at the base of intended landing of any change in
     ETA to ensure that border clearance is accomplished as soon as possible after landing.
     6.46.2.3. Obtain a permit to proceed when military necessities require that an aircraft,
     which has landed in the United States for customs clearance, to proceed to another base
     in the US to obtain border clearance. The permit to proceed delays customs inspection of
     cargo, passengers, and crew until arrival at the offload station, and saves intermediate
     offloading and reloading normally required for customs inspection. The permit to proceed
     is valid only to the airport of next landing where the border clearance must be completed
     or a new permit to proceed issued by a customs official. Do not make intermediate stops
     between the issue point of the permit to proceed and destination of manifested cargo
     unless required by an emergency or directed by the controlling C2 center.
     6.46.2.4. When an aircraft lands for a US border clearance, a US Customs representative
     normally will meet the aircraft to obtain the required documents. Do not enplane/deplane
     passengers, troops, or crewmembers unless necessary for safety or the preservation of life
     and property (loadmaster excepted). Do not unload until approved by customs and
     agriculture personnel or their designated representatives. This procedure applies to the
     initial landing in the US and all landings required when operating on a permit to proceed
     or until all crew, passengers, and cargo complete final border clearance.
  6.46.3. Inspections of US aircraft by foreign officials.
     6.46.3.1. Follow US Air Force policy on status of military aircraft as stated in the FCG,
     General Information (Chapter 3). In substance, this policy holds that US military aircraft
     are immune from searches, seizures, and inspections (including customs and safety
     inspections) by foreign officials. In addition, PICs must be aware of and adhere to any
     specific FCG provisions for individual countries.
     6.46.3.2. If confronted with a search request by foreign authorities, aircrews should use
     the following procedures.
         6.46.3.2.1. In most cases, search attempts may be halted simply by a statement of the
         PIC to the foreign official that the aircraft is a sovereign instrumentality not subject to
         search without consent of USAF headquarters or the US Department of State officials
         in the country concerned. This should be clearly conveyed in a polite manner so as
114                                            AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010


         not to offend foreign authorities that may honestly, but mistakenly, believe they have
         authority to search USAF aircraft.
         6.46.3.2.2. If foreign authorities insist on conducting a search, the PIC should make
         every effort to delay the search until he or she can contact USAF headquarters
         (through MAJCOM C2) or the appropriate embassy officials. The PIC should then
         notify these agencies of foreign request by the most expeditious means available and
         follow their instructions.
         6.46.3.2.3. If foreign officials refuse to desist in their search request, pending
         notification to USAF headquarters or the appropriate embassy, the PIC should
         indicate that he or she would prefer to fly the aircraft elsewhere (provided fuel, flying
         time, and mechanical considerations permit a safe flight) and request permission to do
         so.
         6.46.3.2.4. If permission is refused and the foreign authorities insist on forcing their
         way on board an aircraft, the PIC should state that he protests the course of action
         being pursued and that he intends to notify both USAF headquarters and the
         appropriate American embassy of the foreign action. The PIC should not attempt
         physical resistance, and should thereafter report the incident to USAF headquarters
         and appropriate embassy as soon as possible. The PIC should escort foreign
         authorities if the inspection cannot be avoided.
      6.46.3.3. Other procedures may apply when carrying sensitive cargo or equipment.
      Follow these procedures and applicable portions of classified FCG supplements.
  6.46.4. Exercises and Contingency Operations.
      6.46.4.1. General. Certain airlift missions, which do not transit normal ports of entry or
      exit, require special procedures to expedite compliance with customs, public health,
      immunization, and agricultural requirements. A joint memorandum of understanding,
      between these agencies and MAJCOM establishes certain procedures and waivers.
      6.46.4.2. Implementation. Implementation of the agreement is not automatic. Traffic and
      border clearing agencies implement all or part of the agreement as necessary for each
      operation. Inspection and clearance may be accomplished at the US onload or offload
      base, or at the foreign onload or offload base.
      6.46.4.3. Customs Procedures.
         6.46.4.3.1. Outbound: No requirement. Filing of Customs Form 7507, General
         Declaration (Outward/Inward), is not required unless directed.
         6.46.4.3.2. Inbound. Prepare one copy of the following documents before arrival:
             6.46.4.3.2.1. Customs Form 7507 (found at http://www.customs.gov) (Passenger

               reporters, and crew-members.
               6.46.4.3.2.3.3. Upon arrival at a CONUS offload base, a customs
               representative will meet the aircraft. Troop commander will turn individual
               declaration to custom representatives
               6.46.4.3.2.3.4. Troops will debark under the observation of the customs
               representative with only a spot check of articles and baggage. The customs
               officer may elect to make a more extensive inspection.
            6.46.4.3.2.4. For troops who are out of the country 140-days, or more:
               6.46.4.3.2.4.1. One copy of the Customs Form 6059B US Customs Baggage
               Declaration Form for each passenger. This includes observers, support
               personnel, civilians, news media personnel, and crewmembers.
               6.46.4.3.2.4.2. Upon arrival at a CONUS offload base, a Customs
               representative will meet the aircraft and collect all declarations. Troops will
               debark under the observation of the customs representative who may make
               discretionary examination of the baggage.
     6.46.4.4. Public Health Procedures.
        6.46.4.4.1. When operating from a base without a traffic officer, the PIC will ensure
        all crew-members and passengers are properly immunized.
        6.46.4.4.2. Spray the aircraft if required.
     6.46.4.5. Immigration Procedures.

            milk, milk products, vegetables, plants, plant pests, soil samples, animals, meat,
            and animal products can be brought into the United States. All items of troop
            personal gear/cargo are to be thoroughly cleaned of mud, dirt, sand, and other
            foreign material before being brought aboard the aircraft. Personal gear and
            equipment must be examined for snails and other plant pests to prevent their
 116                                            AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010


              accidental entry into the U.S.
              6.46.4.6.2.2. Before loading, the command responsible for cargo being airlifted
              will clear vehicles and cargo of snails or other plant pests and of all mud and soil.
              6.46.4.6.2.3. When required by agricultural quarantine regulations, the FCG, or
              higher headquarters, the aircraft will receive an aerosol treatment 30 minutes
              before landing.
              6.46.4.6.2.4. On arrival, agricultural inspectors will inspect the aircraft after
              troops have disembarked. Crewmembers will assemble remains of in-flight
              lunches for prompt removal by fleet service personnel.
              6.46.4.6.2.5. Inspectors examine baggage, equipment, vehicles, and cargo as
              offloaded. Any items, vehicles, or cargo found to be contaminated will be held for
              such treatment as the inspector may direct (washing, steam cleaning, physical
              cleaning, or fumigation).
   6.46.5. Military Customs Pre-Clearance Inspection Program. All crew members will ensure
   compliance with Military Customs Pre-clearance requirements.
6.47. Insect and Pest Control.
   6.47.1. Responsibility. PICs will ensure required spraying is accomplished according to
   AFJI 48-104, Quarantine Regulations of the Armed Forces, Department of Defense FCG, or
   as directed by higher headquarters. Certify the spraying on Customs Form 7507, or on forms
   provided by the country transited. Aircraft should never be sprayed with passengers on
   board. The only exception is when mandated by the FCG.
CAUTION: If the insecticide label directs disembarkation after use, spray before boarding crew
or passengers. Close all doors and hatches for 10-minutes after dispensing and ventilate for 15
minutes before allowing anyone on board.
       6.47.1.1. When spraying is required, use insecticide, aerosol d-phenothrin-2 percent,
       National Stock Number (NSN) 6840-01-067-6674 (or equivalent), to spray the aircraft.
       Wear leather or Nomex gloves while spraying.
          6.47.1.1.1. Direct the nozzle toward the ceiling of the compartment or space being
          sprayed.
          6.47.1.1.2. Spray spaces inaccessible from within the aircraft after completely
          loading fuel, baggage, cargo, and passengers, including baggage compartments,
          wheel wells, and other similar spaces.
          6.47.1.1.3. Spray the cabin, cockpit, and other spaces accessible from within the
          aircraft after the crew is aboard and after closing all doors, windows, hatches, and
          ventilation openings.
       6.47.1.2. Spray for 3 minutes 20 seconds unless longer periods are specified for the
       country being transited.
NOTE: Keep used aerosol cans separate from other trash so they may be disposed of safely.

   6.47.2. Responsibility of PIC In-flight. When seeing any insect or rodent infestation of the
   aircraft in-flight, notify the destination C2 center, airfield management operations, or airport
   manager of the situation before landing so the proper authorities can meet the aircraft.
   6.47.3. Procedure at Aerial Port of Disembarkation (APOD). On arrival at an APOD, do not
   open cargo doors or hatches except to enplane officials required to inspect the aircraft for
   insect or rodent infestation. Do not onload or offload cargo or passengers until the inspection
   is satisfactorily completed. This procedure may be altered to satisfy mission or local
   requirements, as arranged by the base air terminal manager or the local C2 organization.

Section 6G—Miscellaneous

6.48. Dropped Objects. If an externally dropped object is discovered, the flight crew will:
   6.48.1. Notify the appropriate C2 agency as soon as practical; include details of routing,
   altitude, weather, etc.
   6.48.2. Notify maintenance at the first military station transited.
6.49. Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR). If involved in a mishap or incident, after landing and
terminating the emergency, pull the CVR power circuit breaker.
6.50. Life Support and Dash 21 Equipment Documentation. The PIC or designated
representative will:
   6.50.1. Before departing home station or en route stations, ensure appropriate serviceable
   protective clothing, life support, survival, and dash 21 equipment for the entire or remainder
   of the mission are aboard the aircraft.
   6.50.2. Before departing home station and following en route crew changes, review AF
   Form 4076, Aircraft Dash 21 Equipment Inventory, to ensure all required dash 21
   equipment has been certified as installed by maintenance, the initial check has been signed
   by maintenance, and configuration documents match mission requirements.
   6.50.3. Before departing home station and following en route crew changes, review, sign,
   and date the AFTO Form 46, Prepositioned Life Support Equipment, to ensure all required
   protective clothing and life support and survival equipment have been certified as installed
   by aircrew life support and that configuration documents match mission requirements.
   Ensure appropriate number and type of life preservers are aboard for over-water missions
   carrying children and infants.
       6.50.3.1. (Added-3WG) . Life support equipment should not be transferred from one
       aircraft to another without CP coordination. When transfers must be done, entries will be
       made in the AFTO Form 781A of both aircraft. Time permitting; transfers will be
       performed by life support personnel.
   6.50.4. Missing Equipment. Aircrew members discovering equipment missing will
   accomplish the following:
       6.50.4.1. Make an AFTO Form 781A entry for missing equipment. Additionally, ensure
       equipment removed from the aircraft at an en route station is documented in the AFTO
       Form 781A.
 118                                               AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010


       6.50.4.2. Annotate AF Form 4076 and AFTO Form 46 in the next vacant column
       indicating the quantity remaining for the item. Ensure the ICAO location designator is
       entered above the check number of that column. Leave AF Form 4076 and AFTO Form
       46 on board the aircraft in the event of an en route crew change.
       6.50.4.3. Advise the PIC and determine whether the missing equipment should be
       recovered or replaced before mission continuation.
       6.50.4.4. Assist, as required, in preparing reports of survey for missing equipment.
       6.50.4.5. When possible, advise HQ AMC/A37TL (or MAJCOM life support office) and
       appropriate C2 agency (or airport management) before mission continuation.
   6.50.5. Additional Equipment. If more equipment is discovered during the preflight than is
   annotated on the AF Form 4076 or AFTO Form 46, annotate the total quantity in the next
   vacant column for the item. Ensure the ICAO location designator is entered above the check
   number of that column.
6.51. Not Used.
6.52. Airfield Data Reports. Aircrews transiting unfamiliar airfields or airfields where
conditions may adversely affect subsequent flight will:
   6.52.1. Report airfield characteristics that produce illusions, such as runway length, width,
   slope, and lighting, as compared to standard runways, sloping approach terrain, runway
   contrast against surrounding terrain, haze, glare, etc., and previously unknown obstacles,
   airfield markings, or other safety critical items to HQ AMC/A36AS (Airfield Suitability
   Branch).
   6.52.2. Debrief the next C2 center transited.
6.53. Impoundment of Aircraft. If an aircraft is involved in a serious in-flight incident, the
PIC should contact the controlling C2 agency immediately after landing for further instructions.
Impoundment may be required.
6.54. Cockpit Congestion and Loose Objects.
   6.54.1. Store only the minimum amount of professional gear required to accomplish the
   mission on the flight deck. Additional items, to include personal pubs bags, will be secured in
   the crew rest area or cargo compartment. All items will be secured before passing the combat
   entry point through the combat exit point.
6.55. Wake Turbulence Avoidance. Comply with wake turbulence avoidance criteria.
Acceptance of traffic information, instructions to follow an aircraft, or a visual approach
clearance is acknowledgment that the PIC will ensure takeoff and landing intervals and accepts
responsibility of providing wake turbulence separation. Refer to FLIP General Planning (GP)
section 5-37 for more information concerning wake turbulence separation
6.56. Over Flying En Route Stops. The C2 agency may approve a request to over fly a
scheduled en route stop (ANG/DOD for ANG-directed missions, AFRC command center for
AFRC-directed missions).
AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010                                                             119


6.57. Hung Flare Procedures. Conduct the following procedures after the live firing of flares,
if displayed flare quantities have decreased since block-out, or if the crew suspects aircraft battle
damage:
   6.57.1. After landing, taxi to the de-arm area or another suitable safe location to check for
   hung ordnance.
       6.57.1.1. (Added-3WG) . At Elmendorf AFB, de-arm areas and hung flare areas are
       depicted in the 3rd Wing In-flight Guide.
   6.57.2. The loadmaster or another qualified crewmember will deplane the aircraft and check
   all flare dispensers for hung ordnance or damage.
NOTE: ALE-40/47 flare squibs that fail to fire are not considered hung ordnance.
       6.57.2.1. (Added-3WG) . When inspecting for hung flares, avoid the path at which a
       dispensed flare will travel. Do not approach the dispensers any closer than necessary.
       Use caution to avoid engine intakes/exhausts.
   6.57.3. If hung ordnance is found, identified by a protruding or partially ejected flare
   cartridge, the aircraft will remain in a de-arm area until Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD)
   personnel meet the aircraft. The aircraft must remain in the designated safe area until EOD
   personnel can clear all hung ordnance.
       6.57.3.1. (Added-3WG) . If there is evidence of a hung flare, notify the Tower/Ground
       and the 3 WG/ CP. Declare a ground emergency and request explosive ordinance
       disposal (EOD) support. Pass along the following information: Aircraft location; Type
       and quantity of flares hung; What countermeasure dispensing system.(CMDS) position
       the hung flares are located on, (that is, left forward, right aft, and so forth); Type and
       quantity of flares on board; Number of passengers/flight crew on board the aircraft.
       6.57.3.2. (Added-3WG) . Shut down the engines using normal checklists, and deplane
       the passengers / crew using exits away from the hung flare. Evacuate to at least 600 feet
       away from the hung flare.
   6.57.4. If hung ordnance is not found, the aircraft can proceed to the parking location.
6.58. Classified Equipment and Material. Comply with the following or as directed in
MAJCOM supplement.
   6.58.1. Equipment. When classified equipment is onboard, ensure the C2 Center or base
   operations office is aware of the requirement for aircraft security according to Chapter 7 of
   this AFI. At bases not under jurisdiction of the Air Force, ensure the aircraft and equipment
   are protected. AFI 31-401, Information Security Program Management, provides specific
   guidance concerning the security of various levels of classified equipment aboard aircraft.
   For classified aircraft components which cannot be removed and stored, seal the aircraft. If
   available, use Ravens to guard the aircraft; otherwise, use guards employed by the host
   country for flightline/airport area control. Do not leave unguarded classified information
   stored in navigation or radio equipment.
   6.58.2. Material. Ensure Communications Security (COMSEC) and other classified
   materials are turned in at destination and receipts are obtained for COMSEC and classified
   material. The on-site C2 center will provide temporary storage for COMSEC and other
 120                                            AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010


   classified materials during en route, turnaround, and crew rest stops. If a storage facility is
   not available, the aircraft gun storage box may be used for material classified up to and
   including SECRET. Encrypted COMSEC will only be transferred to authorized DoD
   personnel.
       6.58.2.1. (Added-3WG) . If utilizing the aircraft gun box/locker, place the classified
       material in the issued pouch then lock and seal the pouch. Store the locked and sealed
       pouch in the installed aircraft gun box/locker. Place a seal on the gun box/locker and
       secure it with a General Services Administration (GSA)-approved lock. Lock and seal
       the aircraft.
       6.58.2.2. (Added-3WG) .       Hand receipt classified material to properly cleared
       personnel. If in question, these people should be able to produce a clearance
       authorization document from the US State Department or similar office. If necessary,
       properly cleared individuals may also safeguard classified aircraft components to ensure
       constant oversight during ground operations.
   6.58.3. Aircrews will ensure that they have an operable Mode IV when required for mission
   accomplishment. Aircrews will conduct an operational ground test of the Mode IV (ground
   test assets permitting) before deployment overseas, or as specified in the OPORD or
   contingency/exercise tasking.
   6.58.4. Attempt to fix an inoperable Mode IV before takeoff. Do not delay takeoff nor cancel
   a mission for an inoperable Mode IV, except when the aircraft will transit an area where safe
   passage procedures are implemented.
   6.58.5. Conduct an in-flight check of the Mode IV on all missions departing the CONUS for
   overseas locations. Aircrews can request the Mode 4 interrogation check through NORAD on
   UHF frequency 364.2.
   6.58.6. Aircraft with inoperable Mode IV will continue to their intended destinations.
   Repairs will be accomplished at the first destination where equipment, parts, and
   maintenance technicians are available. In theaters where safe passage is implemented,
   aircraft will follow procedures for inoperable Mode IV as directed in the applicable airspace
   control order or Air Tasking Order (ATO).
   6.58.7. Ground and in-flight checks of the Mode IV, when conducted, are mandatory
   maintenance debrief items. Crews will annotate successful and unsuccessful interrogation of
   the Mode IV on all aircraft forms (AFTO IMT 781A).
   6.58.8. Aircrews will carry COMSEC equipment and documents required to operate the
   Mode IV on missions when required for mission accomplishment. Before departing for any
   destination without COMSEC storage facilities, crews will contact their local COMSEC
   managers for guidance.
   6.58.9. (Added-3WG) . Ensure all secure communication equipment and mission computer
   data is zeroized prior to leaving the aircraft.
6.59. (Added-3WG) . Aircrew Data Transfer Device (ADTD):
   6.59.1. (Added-3WG) . Prior to leaving home station, ensure extra printer paper is on
   board the aircraft. Maintenance personnel are responsible for ensuring spare paper is on the
AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010                                                             121


   aircraft. Loadmasters should check storage drawers or crew galley storage bins before
   contacting maintenance.
   6.59.2. (Added-3WG) . Do not make changes to any of the operating properties of the
   ADTD. Many of the features of the ADTD are directly linked to the properties set at the
   factory on the computer. Making changes to these properties can result in malfunctions of
   the ADTD. It‘s prohibited for personnel to add unauthorized programs (that is, games,
   pictures, wallpaper, and so forth) to the ADTD. Do not save mission histories, travel
   vouchers, enlisted performance reports (EPR), officers performance reports (OPR), and so
   forth, to the ADTD hard drive.
   6.59.3. (Added-3WG) . The A: drives on the ADTDs are damaged when dust covers on
   floppy disks get lodged inside. If able, do not use floppy disks with metal dust covers in the
   ADTD. Do not insert/force any sharp object into the floppy drive. If you cannot retrieve a
   disk, write up the ADTD in the aircraft forms.
6.60. (Added-3WG) . Crew Resource Management (CRM):
   6.60.1. (Added-3WG) . During the mission pre-brief, the PIC will appoint an individual
   crewmember to assess CRM during the sortie/mission. Crews are encouraged to use the AF
   Form 4031, CRM Skills Criteria Training/Evaluation Form, as a guide to enhance their CRM
   skills.
   6.60.2. (Added-3WG) . PICs will conduct a formal debriefing following the completion of
   each day‘s mission or local training sortie. Each crewmember should discuss and critique
   crew coordination and the process used to make decisions.
6.61. (Added-3WG) . Thrust Management. C-17 aircrews must use extreme caution while
taxiing at power settings above idle. Airfield operations personnel (especially at civilian fixed
based operators (FBO)) may not be familiar with the jet blast associated with C17 aircraft
taxiing. Ensure sufficient distance is available between the aircraft and other aircraft, structures,
vehicles, or equipment.
6.62. (Added-3WG) . Lost Items. Aircrew members will ensure positive control and
accountability of personal equipment used while performing duties on aircraft. If an item is
discovered as lost/missing on an aircraft, conduct a thorough search of the area. If the item is
still determined to be lost/missing, make an AFTO Form 781A write up describing the item and
where it was lost.
 122                                              AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010


                                             Chapter 7

                                            SECURITY

7.1. General. This chapter provides guidance on aircraft security and preventing and resisting
aircraft piracy (hijacking) of the C-17 aircraft. AFI 13-207, Preventing and Resisting Aircraft
Piracy (Hijacking) (FOUO), AFI 31-101, The Air Force Installation Security Program (FOUO),
and specific MAJCOM security publications contain additional guidance. Aircrews will not
release information concerning hijacking attempts or identify armed aircrew members or
missions to the public.
7.2. Security. The C-17 is a ―Protection Level 3‖ resource. Aircraft security at non-United
States military installations is the responsibility of the controlling agency.
7.3. Air Force Installation Security Program. The following security procedures will
implement AFI 31-101 (FOUO), The Air Force Installation Security Program, requirements for
C-17 aircraft:
   7.3.1. The aircraft will be parked in an established restricted area and afforded protection via
   a two-person Internal Security Response Team (ISRT),with immediate response not to
   exceed 3 minutes, and a two-person External Security Response Team, (ESRT) with
   response capability within 5 minutes.
   7.3.2. When no permanent or established restricted area parking is available, establish a
   temporary restricted area consisting of a raised rope barrier, and post with restricted area
   signs. Provide ESRT 5-minute response and the ISRT from existing areas can respond to this
   area if able to maintain 3-minute response within their primary area. Portable security
   lighting will be provided during the hours of darkness if sufficient permanent lighting is not
   available.
   7.3.3. At non-United States military installations, the PIC determines the adequacy of local
   security capabilities to provide aircraft security commensurate with this chapter. If the PIC
   determines security to be inadequate, the aircraft will depart to a station where adequate
   security is available.
   7.3.4. The security force must be made aware of all visits to the aircraft. The security force
   POC must be identified to the PIC.
   7.3.5. Security force support terminates only after the aircraft doors are closed and the
   aircraft taxies.
   7.3.6. Sealing. Seal the aircraft during all RONs on non-secure ramps.
7.4. Standby Aircraft Security. The PIC shall ensure aircraft hatches and doors are secure to
show unauthorized entry; seal the crew entrance door and aft exterior maintenance tunnel hatch
with a boxcar seal. The PIC shall notify the C2 agency the aircraft is sealed and provide them a
means to access the aircraft in an emergency. Annotate the forms with the time the aircraft was
sealed. The C2 Senior Controller may grant access to a sealed aircraft, shall document time of
entry and ensure it remains launch capable. The PIC or designated representative must be present
if access to the aircraft is required and will ensure the aircraft is resealed. The aircrew pre-flight
portion will remain valid if performed by one aircrew, sealed, and flown by another aircrew.
AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010                                                           123


NOTE: WG/CCs should develop local procedures for documentation and management IAW TO
00-20-1 and MAJCOM Supplement.
7.5. En Route Security. The planning agency must coordinate with the execution agency to
ensure adequate en route security is available. PIC will receive a threat assessment and en route
security capability evaluation briefing for areas of intended operation prior to home station
departure and should request updates from en route C2 as required. If required, a PHOENIX
RAVEN team will be assigned to the mission.
   7.5.1. The PHOENIX RAVEN team will consist of US Air Force security force members.
   The team travels in MEGP status and is responsible to the PIC at all times. In turn, the PIC is
   responsible for their welfare (transportation, lodging, etc.). Ensure security team members
   receive a mission briefing, aircraft egress/passenger briefing (as appropriate).
   7.5.2. Arrival. On arrival, the PIC will assess the local situation and take the following
   actions as required:
       7.5.2.1. Area patrol. Request area security patrols from local security forces. If local
       authorities request payment for this service, use AF IMT 15, USAF Invoice.
       7.5.2.2. Aircrew surveillance. During short ground times, direct armed crewmembers to
       remain with the aircraft and maintain surveillance of aircraft entrances and activities in
       the aircraft vicinity.
       7.5.2.3. Inadequate Security. If in the PIC opinion, airfield security is inadequate and the
       PIC determines the safety of the aircraft is in question, the PIC may waive the flight duty
       period limits and crew rest requirements and depart as soon as possible for a base
       considered reliable. Report movement and intentions to the controlling agency as soon as
       practical. If departure is not possible, the aircrew must secure the aircraft to the best of
       their ability. In no case, will the entire crew leave the aircraft unattended. Crew rest
       requirements will be subordinate to aircraft security when the airframe may be at risk.
       The PIC should rotate a security detail among the crew to provide for both aircraft
       protection and crew rest until relief is available. Request security assistance from the
       nearest DoD installation, US Embassy, local military or law enforcement agencies as
       appropriate.
   7.5.3. Entry Control Procedures. Unescorted entry is granted to crewmembers and support
   personnel assigned to the mission who possess their home station AF Form 1199, Air Force
   Entry Control Card, supported by an Entry Access List (EAL) or aircrew orders.
   Crewmembers and assigned crew chiefs are authorized escort authority.
       7.5.3.1. Normally, non-United States nationals, such as cargo handlers, can perform their
       duties under escort and should not be placed on the EAL.
       7.5.3.2. Personnel not on the entry control list or aircrew orders must be escorted within
       the area.
7.6. Detecting Unauthorized Entry.
   7.6.1. When parking on a secure ramp, the aircraft will normally be left unlocked/unsealed
   to allow ground personnel immediate access. If, in the PIC's judgment, the aircraft needs to
   be sealed in order to detect unauthorized entry, then:
124                                             AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010


      7.6.1.1. Use available box car seals.
      7.6.1.2. Secure the doors in a manner that will indicate unauthorized entry (e.g., tape
      inside of doors to airframe so that entry pulls tape loose).
      7.6.1.3. Close and seal the crew entrance door (box car seal). Confirm the condition of
      the aft hatch seal. (See paragraph 7.6.3)
      7.6.1.4. Wipe the immediate area around lock and latches clean to aid in investigation of
      a forced entry.
      7.6.1.5. Report any unauthorized entry or tampering to the OSI, security forces or local
      authorities, and the C2 agency. Have aircraft thoroughly inspected prior to flight.
      7.6.1.6. (Added-3WG) . Except for aircraft protected by RAVENS, 3 WG aircraft will
      be sealed during all remain over night (RON) and during any ground time when aircrew
      is absent from the aircraft at non-US military installations. The Crew Entry Door will be
      sealed with a lock or boxcar seal. The Forward Escape Hatch and Troop Doors will be
      sealed internally with a cargo strap. The Maintenance/Ditching Hatch will be taped to
      detect entry.
  7.6.2. Security awareness is crucial to effective mission accomplishment. Aircrews must
  always remain vigilant to their surroundings, especially at high threat, low security locations.
  During pre-flight activities, aircrews will inspect accessible areas, to include aircraft wheel
  wells, air conditioning compartments, and cargo compartment under floor area (IAW 7.6.3)
  for unauthorized packages, personnel, or other unfamiliar devices. Report any suspicious
  items to host security forces. Aircrews will maintain a heightened security posture
  throughout all pre-takeoff activities.
  7.6.3. Under floor Hatch Security. The following procedures are to be used when
  inspecting/securing the under floor maintenance area. Crewmembers will not enter the under
  floor area unless specifically required for the mission. Crewmembers will not pin the aft
  hatch from inside the aircraft. Prior to all home station departures, crewmembers will ensure
  both the forward and aft under floor maintenance tunnel access hatches are sealed. If the aft
  hatch is not sealed, open the aft hatch and visually inspect the under floor area from the aft
  hatch. Close and seal the aft hatch (tape, boxcar seal, or suitable alternate) and ensure the
  forward hatch is secured with a boxcar seal. Enter the date, time and initials of the individual
  accomplishing these procedures on the tape (if used). Annotate the aircraft forms with the
  method sealed, (tape or seal), the seal number if applicable, date and time. Prior to each off
  station flight, the loadmaster will check the forward hatch seal and the pilot will inspect aft
  hatch seal during the exterior inspection. Verify the tape/seal on the aft hatch is intact and
  agrees with the write up in the aircraft forms. If the seal/tape has been removed/tampered
  with, notify security personnel immediately. Prior to entering crew rest, check the condition
  of the seal/tape and reapply if necessary. Local missions: no inspection/seal is required for
  either hatch.
      7.6.3.1. (Added-3WG) . When sealing the aft under floor hatch, the boxcar seal should
      be wrapped around the handle once to shorten the seal length. Otherwise, it‘s possible to
      open the hatch without breaking the seal.
AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010                                                            125


7.7. Preventing and Resisting Hijacking.
   7.7.1. In taking action during an aircraft hijacking situation, military forces will act under
   military command within the scope of their duties.
   7.7.2. In the event an aircraft involved in an aircraft hijacking situation is carrying
   documents, equipment, or material that DoD has determined to be highly sensitive, or
   weapons of mass destruction, DoD will provide FAA, and where appropriate, the FBI, with
   all pertinent information. Where possible, the FAA will consult and cooperate with DoD
   prior to directing any law enforcement activity.
   7.7.3. An aircraft is most vulnerable to hijacking when the aircrew is aboard and the aircraft
   is operationally ready for flight.
   7.7.4. A concerted effort must be made to prevent the hijacking of military or military
   contract aircraft by detecting potential hijackers before they board the aircraft.
   7.7.5. Should preventive efforts fail, any actual attempt to hijack a military aircraft must be
   resisted in a manner appropriate to the situation.
   7.7.6. Since air piracy may be committed by political terrorists or by individuals to whom
   the threat of death is not a deterrent but a stimulus, ordinary law enforcement procedures may
   be ineffective. Thus, successful conclusion of a hijacking situation and apprehension of the
   hijackers may require use of specialized law enforcement techniques and procedures.
   7.7.7. Delaying actions have been most successful in overcoming hijackings without loss of
   life or property.
   7.7.8. In the case of an aircraft carrying passengers, the primary concern is the safety of the
   passengers.
   7.7.9. Assistance to hijacked civil or military contract aircraft will be rendered as requested
   by the pilot in command of the aircraft and the authority exercising operational control of the
   anti-hijacking effort.
7.8. Preventive Measures. Commanders at all levels must ensure preventive measures are
taken to minimize access to the aircraft by potential hijackers. When a C-17 is operating away
from home station, the PIC will ensure provisions of this chapter and AFI 13-207 (FOUO), as
supplemented, are complied with.
   7.8.1. Preventive measures include the following: The host station passenger processing or
   manifesting facility should conduct anti-hijacking inspections. Do not board passengers until
   the PIC is fully satisfied with inspection results. In the absence of qualified passenger service
   representatives, the PIC will ensure the anti-hijacking inspection of passengers and baggage
   is accomplished.
   7.8.2. Medical facility commanders are responsible for anti-hijacking inspection of patients.
   When patients are delivered to the aircraft by civilian sources, the aircrew will perform
   required inspections prior to loading.
   7.8.3. During exercises or contingencies in support of combat operations involving the
   movement of large groups of personnel, the unit being supported should manifest passengers
   and perform anti-hijacking inspections.

   7.8.4. Passengers will not carry weapons or ammunition on their person or in hand-carried
   baggage aboard an aircraft. EXCEPTION: Special agents, guards of the Secret Service or
   State Department, RAVEN Team Members, and other individuals specifically authorized to
   carry weapons.
       7.8.4.1. Troops or deadhead crewmembers will not retain custody of ammunition on an
       aircraft. They will turn it in to the troop commander or PIC. Troops may carry unloaded
       weapons and ammunition aboard the aircraft during combat operations. When the tactical
       situation dictates (in coordination with the aircrew), weapons may be loaded at the order
       of the troop commander or team leader.
       7.8.4.2. Dummy clips that can be easily identified may be loaded for training at the order
       of the team leader in coordination with the aircrew.
       7.8.4.3. RAVENs will only be armed in-flight on specifically designated missions
       identified on the mission ―frag‖ as ―RAVEN in-flight arming required‖.
   7.8.5. If weapons must be loaded/cleared, the individual/s will:
       7.8.5.1. Move to a safe, clear area at least 50 feet from any aircraft, equipment, or
       personnel before un-holstering or un-slinging their weapons.
       7.8.5.2. Clear weapons in accordance with standard safety procedures.
7.9. Initial Response. When an act of air piracy involves an Air Force installation or aircraft
within the United States, response will be according to the following guidelines until such time
as FAA assumes active direction of anti-hijacking efforts. Resist all attempts to hijack a military
aircraft. Resistance may vary from simple dissuasion, through deception and subterfuge, to direct
physical confrontation, including the prudent use of weapons.
   7.9.1. The following guidelines should be used to counter a hijacking, actual or threatened,
   while the aircraft is on the ground:
       7.9.1.1. Delay movement of the aircraft to provide time for ground personnel and the
       aircrew to establish communication and execute coordinated resistance actions.
       7.9.1.2. The authority for determining when ground resistance will be discontinued is
       vested in the highest available level of command. When adequate communication cannot
       be established, or when time does not permit, this authority is delegated in the following
       order:
           7.9.1.2.1. MAJCOM commander exercising operational control of the aircraft.
           7.9.1.2.2. MAJCOM commanders in whose Area Of Responsibility (AOR) the
           airfield lies.
           7.9.1.2.3. Senior operational commander on scene.
           7.9.1.2.4. PIC in compliance with MAJCOM directives.
   7.9.2. A hijacked aircraft carrying weapons of mass destruction will not be allowed to
   takeoff. Refer to DoD 5210.41M, chapter 7, for additional guidance.
AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010                                                            127


7.10. In-Flight Resistance. After airborne, success in thwarting a hijacking depends on the
resourcefulness of the aircrew. Many variables of a hijacking preclude use of any specific
counter-hijacking procedure. Some key factors should be evaluated before deciding a course of
action to be taken, including the nature of the threat, danger to life or crippling damage to the
aircraft in-flight, destination indicated by the hijacker, and the presence of sensitive material
onboard. Some counter-hijacking actions the aircrew may consider are:
   7.10.1. Engage the hijacker/s in conversation in an attempt to calm them and to evaluate
   what course of action might be effective.
   7.10.2. Dissuade the hijacker.
   7.10.3. Use facts or subterfuge to convince the hijacker intermediate stops are necessary.
   7.10.4. Propose more favorable alternatives, such as landing in a neutral, rather than a
   hostile, country.
   7.10.5. Exploit any reasonable opportunity to incapacitate or overcome the hijacker
   physically, including the prudent use of firearms.
7.11. Communications Between Aircrew and Ground Agencies. Crews facing a hijacking
threat will notify ground agencies by any means available as soon as practical and follow-up
with situation reports as circumstances permit.
   7.11.1. If possible, transmit an in-the-clear notification of hijacking to ATC. Controllers will
   assign IFF code 7500 (does not preclude subsequent selection of code 7700).
   7.11.2. If in-the-clear transmissions are not possible, report "am being hijacked" by setting
   transponder to code 7500. If unable to change transponder code, or when not under radar
   control, transmit a radio message to include the phrase "(call sign) transponder seven five
   zero zero."
   7.11.3. Controllers will acknowledge receipt and understanding of transponder code 7500 by
   transmitting "(call sign) (facility name) verify squawking 7500." An affirmative reply or lack
   of reply from the pilot indicates confirmation and proper authorities are notified.
   7.11.4. To report "situation appears desperate; want armed intervention," after code 7500 is
   used, change to code 7700. If unable to change transponder code to 7700, or when not under
   radar control, transmit "(aircraft call sign) transponder seven seven zero zero."
       7.11.4.1. When changing from code 7500 to code 7700, remain on 7500 for at least 3
       minutes or until a confirmation of code 7500 is received from ATC, whichever is sooner,
       before changing to code 7700. ATC acknowledges code 7700 by transmitting "(call sign)
       (facility name) now reading you on transponder seven seven zero zero."
       7.11.4.2. Aircraft squawking 7700, after squawking 7500, which are not in radio contact
       with ATC, are considered by ATC to have an in-flight emergency (in addition to
       hijacking), and the appropriate emergency procedures are followed. Notification of
       authorities in this case includes information that the aircraft displayed the hijack code as
       well as the emergency code.
   7.11.5. To report "situation still desperate, want armed intervention and aircraft
   immobilized," leave flaps full down after landing, or select landing flaps while on the
   ground. To facilitate message distribution, transmit "(aircraft call sign) flaps are full down."
 128                                            AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010


   7.11.6. To report "leave alone, do not intervene," retract the flaps after landing. Pilots who
   retract flaps after squawking 7700 should return to code 7500 and remain on code 7500 for
   the next leg of the hijacked flight unless the situation changes. Transmit "(call sign) back on
   seven five zero zero" to emphasize the fact intervention is no longer desired.
7.12. Forced Penetration of Unfriendly Airspace. Refer to FIH for international signals for
air intercept.
7.13. Arming of Crewmembers. When crews are directed to carry weapons (IAW mission
directive, Form 59, OPORD, etc.) a minimum of one pilot and one loadmaster will be armed. All
crewmembers should know who is armed. The following procedures apply when arming is
directed:
   7.13.1. Weapons Issue. Before departing home station, obtain weapons, ammunition, box,
   lock and key. Crewmembers will be armed according to AFI 31-207, Arming and Use of
   Force by Air Force Personnel and MAJCOM publications. If an armed crew member must
   leave the crew en route, transfer the weapon to another authorized crew member using AF
   IMT 1297.
   7.13.2. Wearing of Weapons. Wear weapons in a holster, concealed at all times to prevent
   identifying armed crewmembers. Crewmembers will be armed before beginning preflight,
   on-load or off-load duties and until completion of all post-flight duties. Do not wear weapons
   off the flight line except to and from the C2, armories, and other facilities associated with
   aircrew activities. In general, at overseas locations, weapons are not to be brought off the
   aircraft. In countries where FCG/SOFA authorizes such action, every effort should be made
   to keep all firearms onboard the Sovereign US vessel unless appropriately responding to a
   hostile event or being moved to/from storage at an armory. RAVEN weapons are not to be
   brought off the aircraft unless responding to hostile action or being moved to/from storage at
   an armory.
       7.13.2.1. AMC Passenger Terminal Procedures. Armed crewmembers must discreetly
       identify themselves to AMC passenger service personnel upon arrival at security
       checkpoints. One crew-member will present a valid set of crew orders, military
       identification card, and AF Form 523, USAF Authorization to Bear Firearms,
       authorizing the carrying of concealed weapons. Once terminal personnel verify this, they
       will allow the crewmember to vouch for the remaining crew-members. The entire crew
       will then proceed through the magnetometer without removing objects from their
       pockets. This will prevent passengers from determining which crewmembers are armed.
   7.13.3. Weapons Storage In-Flight. When no passengers are aboard, weapons may be stored
   in the aircraft gun box in-flight after a satisfactory stowaway check. Crewmembers will
   rearm before landing. Weapons will not be unloaded before placing them in the aircraft gun
   box.
   7.13.4. Weapons Storage on the Ground.
       7.13.4.1. Aircrews, including stage crews, will store weapons and ammunition in the
       most secure facility available, normally the base armory.
       7.13.4.2. Non-stage aircrews may store weapons and ammunition in the aircraft gun box.
   7.13.5. When storing weapons in the gun box:
AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010                                                          129


       7.13.5.1. Weapons should normally not be unloaded.
       7.13.5.2. Inform C2 which crew member has the gun box key/combination.
   7.13.6. Crew members will ensure they are reissued the same weapon until mission
   termination at home station.
   7.13.7. Loading and Transfer of Weapons. Load and unload weapons at approved clearing
   barrels if available. Do not use a hand-to-hand transfer of loaded weapons to another crew
   member; place the weapon on a flat surface.
       7.13.7.1. (Added-3WG) . Weapons transported in an ammo can will be loaded
       (magazine inserted with a round in the chamber) with the safety lever on safe and placed
       in the gun box. Armed crewmembers will ensure weapons are carried with the safety off.
       7.13.7.2. (Added-3WG) . If the aircrew is required to load/unload a weapon, aircrews
       will use a clearing barrel if available.
7.14. Force Protection. Crews must be alert to possibility of terrorist activities at all times.
Reference AFMAN 10-100, Airman’s Manual, Joint Service Guide 5260, Service Member's
Personal Protection Guide: Combat Terrorism While Overseas, and AFI 10-245, Air Force
Antiterrorism Standards, for Force Protection measures.
   7.14.1. Personal conduct. Crews must realize their conduct can make them a target for
   individuals dissatisfied with US foreign involvement in their national affairs. Local foreign
   nationals may or may not condone a military presence - crew conduct will be watched and
   judged. Therefore, utilize the following:
7.15. Protecting Classified Material. The Aircraft Commander is responsible for protection of
classified materials aboard their aircraft. As a minimum, insure the IFF equipment is set to zero
and classified information in the mission computer is cleared before leaving the aircraft.
   7.15.1. Hand receipt classified material to properly cleared personnel. If in question, these
   people should be able to produce a clearance authorization document from the U.S. State
   Department or similar office. If necessary, properly cleared individuals may also safeguard
   classified aircraft components to ensure constant oversight during ground operation.
   7.15.2. If transferring materials to properly cleared personnel is not feasible, steps will be
   taken to secure classified materials on the aircraft. Place materials in a pouch, then lock and
   seal the pouch. The pouch should be issued with the COMSEC/classified material. As it is a
   controlled item, it must be returned to the issuing agency upon mission completion. Store the
   locked and sealed pouch in the installed aircraft gun box/locker. Secure the gun box with a
   GSA approved lock then seal the aircraft.
       7.15.2.1. (Added-3WG) . The Sergeant & Greenleaf ® combination lock located in the
       517 AS CTK is a General Services Administration (GSA) approved lock. Personal locks
       will not be used.

                          OPERATIONAL REPORTS AND FORMS

8.1. General. This chapter provides guidelines for worksheets, reports, and forms associated
with AMC operational activities. Consult governing instruction or contact wing, unit, or local
flight safety officers for assistance with safety forms.
8.2. AF IMT 457, USAF Hazard Report. The AF IMT 457 is a tool to notify supervisors and
commanders of a hazardous condition that requires prompt corrective action. For hazardous
weather, complete the front side of an AF IMT 457 and send it to the parent wing flying safety
office. If addressing a computer flight plan deficiency, attach a copy of the AF IMT 72, Air
Report (AIREP). Send your report so the parent unit receives it within 5 days of the event. For
more information, see AFI 91-202, The US Air Force Mishap Prevention Program.
8.3. AF IMT 651, Hazardous Air Traffic Report (HATR). The AF IMT 651 is a tool to
report near midair collisions and alleged hazardous air traffic conditions. See AFI 91-204, Safety
Investigations and Reports, and AFMAN 91-223, Aviation Safety Investigations and Reports for
more information concerning the HATR program.
   8.3.1. AFI 91-204 and AFMAN 91-223 list HATR reportable incidents.
   8.3.2. The PIC shall report the hazardous condition to the nearest ATC agency (e.g. center,
   Flight Service Station (FSS), control tower, or aeronautical radio station) as quickly as safety
   allows. Include the following information in the radio call (as appropriate)
       8.3.2.1. Aircraft identification or call sign.
       8.3.2.2. Time and place (radial/DME of NAVAID, position relative to the airfield,

   8.3.3. Deadline to file a HATR is 24 hours after event via any communication mode
   available. If landing airport has a USAF airfield management function, submit completed AF
   IMT 651 to the airfield management officer for forwarding to wing safety office. If landing
   airport does not have an airfield management office, notify the safety office of the Air Force
   base nearest to location where the condition occurred, PIC‘s home base safety office, or as
   prescribed by overseas MAJCOM. In that case, provide contact sufficient information to
   prepare AF IMT 651.
   8.3.4. Grant individuals who submit a HATR immunity from disciplinary action provided:
       8.3.4.1. If they were the offending party, their violation was not deliberate.
       8.3.4.2. They committed no criminal offense.
       8.3.4.3. Their actions did not result in a mishap.
       8.3.4.4. They properly reported the incident using procedures above.
AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010                                                           131


8.4. AMC IMT 97, AMC In-Flight Emergency and Unusual Occurrence Worksheet. The
AMC IMT 97 is a tool to notify appropriate authorities of any mishap involving crewmembers or
aircraft. PICs shall complete all appropriate areas of the form in as much detail as possible.
When notified, AMC C2 agents will inform their supervisor/commander to start investigation
and reporting activities IAW AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports, and Operation
Report 3 (OPREP-3) procedures. In addition, PICs will preserve all mission and flight related
documents, e.g. flight plans, weather briefings, NOTAMS, Weight and Balance form, etc. for
collection by appropriate safety officials
   8.4.1. PICs will report crewmember or passenger injury, aircraft damage, or injury/damage
   to another organization‘s people or equipment caused by PIC‘s aircraft/crewmember. At a
   minimum, report the following:
       8.4.1.1. Any physiological episode (physiological reaction, near accident, or hazard in-
       flight due to medical or physiological reasons).
NOTE: Crewmembers and passengers involved in a physiological episode will see a flight
surgeon to be evaluated and to ensure the incident is reported in the Air Force Safety Automated
System (AFSAS) as soon as practical.
       8.4.1.2. A human factor related situation, e.g. misinterpretation of instruments;
       information overload (i.e. tactile, aural, and visual input too fast to permit reasonable
       analysis/decision); aircrew task saturation (i.e. too many responses/actions required in a
       short period of time); or confused switchology (i.e. adjacent switches where actuation of
       wrong switch creates dangerous situation). Anonymous reports are acceptable.
       8.4.1.3. A condition that required engine shutdown, in-flight flameout, engine failure,
       suspected engine power loss, or loss of thrust that required descent below MEA. Engine
       failures include, but are not limited to, shrapnel from a failed internal engine component
       penetrating the engine case, engine case rupture/burn-through, engine nacelle fire,
       substantial fuel leak, or unselected thrust reversal. Consistent with safety, immediately
       report incidents that involve multiple engines (may report single-engine incidents upon
       landing). NOTE: Exclude intentional shutdowns for training and/or FCF unless the
       engine fails to restart.
       8.4.1.4. A flight control malfunction (including the autopilot and trim systems) that
       results in an unexpected or hazardous change of flight attitude, altitude, or heading. Enter
       the flag words, ―Reportable Flight Control Malfunction‖ in the AFTO 781A.
       8.4.1.5. A landing gear malfunction aggravated by failed emergency system or
       procedures.
       8.4.1.6. An in-flight loss of all pitot-static or gyro-stabilized attitude/directional
       instrument indications.
       8.4.1.7. Any spillage/leakage of radioactive, toxic, corrosive, or flammable material from
       aircraft stores or cargo.
       8.4.1.8. Conditions that required pilot to depart takeoff or landing surface.
       8.4.1.9. All in-flight fires regardless of damage.
       8.4.1.10. All bird/wildlife strikes regardless of damage.
 132                                               AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010


       8.4.1.11. Incidents that, in the PIC‘s judgment, are in the interest of flight safety.
   8.4.2. Always provide your home station safety officer a copy of relevant information. Make
   every effort to preserve all mission and flight related documents, such as flight plans, weather
   briefings, NOTAMS, Weight and Balance form, etc., for collection by appropriate safety
   officials. PICs shall use the following precedence to report mishaps (as soon as feasible after
   event):
       8.4.2.1. MAJCOM flight safety officer (FSO).
       8.4.2.2. Any FSO.
       8.4.2.3. The nearest USAF C2 center.
       8.4.2.4. Any USAF Airfield Management Operations.
   8.4.3. (Added-3WG) After reporting to the appropriate agency from paragraph 8.4.2 of the
   parent regulation, report all 3 WG aircraft mishaps and unusual occurrences to 3 WG/SE and
   517 AS/ SE as soon as possible (no later than 24 hours) using all available methods to
   include 3 WG/CP or 613 AOC/AMD or TACC while on off-station missions. Aircrews
   should not wait until arriving back at home station to report mishaps and/or unusual
   occurrences. Fill out the 3rd Wing Safety Aircraft Incident Worksheet (or AMC Form 97)
   and fax the form to 3 WG/SE and 517 AS/SE.
8.5. Report Violations, Unusual Events, or Circumstances. PICs shall document events that
require them to deviate from AFI 11-202V3 (unless waived by competent authority) or alleged
navigation errors (include over-water position errors over 24NMs, border, or ATC violations).
Do not release names or personal aircrew information to non-USAF agencies.
   8.5.1. Describe deviation(s) using the following report format:
       8.5.1.1. Facts. Report pertinent details of the event.
       8.5.1.2. Investigation and analysis. Report circumstances which required/drove
       deviation(s).
       8.5.1.3. Findings and conclusions.
       8.5.1.4. Recommendations to prevent recurrence.
       8.5.1.5. Corrective actions taken.
   8.5.2. Include the following attachments with the report:
       8.5.2.1. Formal notification of incident.
       8.5.2.2. Approved crew orders.
       8.5.2.3. Crewmembers‘ official statements (if applicable).
       8.5.2.4. Other pertinent documents submitted in evidence (logs, charts, etc.).
   8.5.3. In addition to above (when aircraft is equipped), PIC shall download original flight
   plan to a floppy disk and turn it in to the C2 center or parent standardization and evaluation
   office.
   8.5.4. OG/CC shall send the original investigation report to the appropriate MAJCOM
   within 45 days of the event/notification. ANG/AFRC OG/CCs shall send original
AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010                                                          133


  investigation report through channels to HQ AFRC/IGI within 35 days of the
  event/notification. HQ AFRC/IGI will send the investigation report to MAJCOM within 45
  days of event/notification.
  8.5.5. Use OPREP-3 reporting procedures contained in AFI 10-206, Operational Reporting,
  for navigation errors over 24 NMs.
     8.5.5.1. When notified of a navigation position error, the PIC (or agency that receives
     initial notification) shall document the circumstances surrounding the incident (using
     report format below) and ensure C2 agents submit an OPREP-3.
     8.5.5.2. Include the following information in the report:
     8.5.5.3. The name and location of agency/unit submitting report.
     8.5.5.4. Effected mission identification number.
     8.5.5.5. Reference OPREPs-3 to determine type of event (i.e., state "navigation position
     error.").
     8.5.5.6. The date, time (Zulu), and location (e.g., ARTCC area) of alleged infraction.
     8.5.5.7. Describe facts and circumstances. Include aircraft type and tail number, unit
     (aircrew‘s wing or squadron), home base, route of flight, point of alleged deviation, and
     miles off course.
  8.5.6. PICs shall expeditiously report unusual events/circumstances that impact their mission
  to appropriate MAJCOM agencies. Reportable events include, but are not limited to,
  spectrum interference, interception, fuel dumping, multiple engine failure, hostile fire, injury
  to passenger or aircrew member, etc. This list is not all exhaustive. Most events require C2
  agents to forward OPREP reports to higher headquarters. In all cases, pass the ―who, what,
  when, where, why, and how‖ of the incident to a C2 agency.
     8.5.6.1. The Spectrum Interference Resolution Program, covered in AFI 10-707,
     Spectrum Interference Resolution Program, establishes procedures to combat the effect
     of meaconing, intrusion, jamming, and interference. PICs who encounter electromagnetic
     interference (EMI) will report the event to the nearest C2 agency as soon as practical.
         8.5.6.1.1. Address EMI reports to: HQ AMC SCOTT AFB IL//A63// and addressees
         listed in AFI 10-707. Send reports via electronic message format with the following
         information in plain text:
             8.5.6.1.1.1. Frequency selected when EMI occurred.
             8.5.6.1.1.2. Equipment affected by EMI. Location of the system. The system
             function, name, nomenclature, manufacturer with model number or other system
             description. The operating mode of the system, if applicable (frequency agile,

          from a non-hostile source need not classify EMI reports unless that report would
          reveal system vulnerability. Classify interference report(s) at stations located in
          combat areas or during sensitive military missions.
8.6. Petroleum, Oil and Lubricants (POL) - Aviation Fuels Documentation. This section
prescribes aviation POL (AVPOL) procedures that ensure correct documentation, form and
invoice processing, and program supervision. Reference AFI 23-202, Buying Petroleum
Products and Other Supplies and Services Off-Station. Use the Multi Service Corporation (MSC)
air card for the purchase of aviation fuel and ancillary ground services at commercial airports
(and some military installations) worldwide. The air card is authorized for use by all U.S.
government aircraft, state, and local law enforcement aircraft, and some foreign government
aircraft. All PICs should plan to use the ―platinum‖ MSC card. In most cases, there will be no
changes when refueling at non-Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) contract locations. The
MSC card is accepted at approximately 4,800 locations worldwide. A list of all MSC-accepting
merchants can be found at https://www.airseacard.com. It replaces the Standard Form (SF) 44,
Purchase Order-Invoice-Voucher, at locations that accept the MSC card.
   8.6.1. Responsibilities. Aircrew and maintenance personnel will be familiar with AVPOL
   procedures and documentation requirements of this chapter. Improper use of the MSC card
   could create financial liability for the purchaser.
   8.6.2. Refuel/defuel USAF aircraft at DoD locations whenever possible. If DoD service is
   not available, purchase fuel from other source(s) in the following priority:
       8.6.2.1. Defense Fuel Supply Center (DFSC) or Canadian into-plane contracts.

       AIRCREW OPERATIONS IN CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL,
         NUCLEAR, AND HIGH-YIELD EXPLOSIVE THREAT ENVIRONMENT

10.1. Overview. The proliferation of Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and High-
Yield Explosive (CBRNE) weapons and the means to deliver them present serious security
threats to the global operations of air mobility forces. This chapter describes the CBRNE threat,
passive defense measures to mitigate that threat, and guidance for ground and flight operations in
a contaminated environment.
10.2. Understanding the CBRNE Threat.
   10.2.1. Chemical Weapons. Militarily significant chemical weapons include nerve, blister,
   choking, and blood agents. A key point for aircrew members to remember is that time is on
   your side. The ultra-violet (UV) rays of the sun, high temperatures, and high absorption rates
   of chemicals all decrease their lethality. Most chemical agents will either evaporate or absorb
   into surfaces. For decontamination, cleaning with hot soap and water and/or a 5 percent
   bleach solution currently appears to be the best and most practical method of removing
   chemical agents that may remain as a contact hazard on glass, and unpainted metal.
   Currently, the only decontaminate authorized for use on aircraft is soap and water. NOTE:
   Recent tests indicate that as a decontaminated aircraft dries, the absorbed chemical warfare
   agent (CWA) may resurface from painted surfaces causing contact and vapor hazards.
   10.2.2. Biological Weapons. Biological warfare agents (BWA) are normally divided into
   three areas: bacteria (i.e., Anthrax) that live outside the cell, reproduce, and are normally
   susceptible to antibiotics; toxins (i.e., Ricin), that are poisons produced by living organisms
   or plants; and viruses (i.e., Smallpox) that normally require the host of a living cell to survive
   and reproduce. Viruses and toxins do not respond to antibiotics. It is probable that the
   medical community would be the first to recognize that an upsurge in ―flu-like symptoms‖ is
   actually a bio attack. Although BWA are degraded by UV rays, humidity and high/low
   temperatures, some BWA (i.e., Anthrax spores) may have a long life, lasting decades under
   the right conditions. Current immunizations and good personal hygiene help prevent
   infection.
   10.2.3. Radiological Weapons. The radiation dispersal device (RDD), or so-called ―dirty
   bomb,‖ is the typical radiological weapon. RDD is any device that disseminates radioactive
   material without using a nuclear detonation. Key points to remember are that shielding and
   distance are the best defenses against radiation exposure.
   10.2.4. Nuclear Weapons. The threat from a nuclear device is from the initial blast, heat,
   radiation, and residual fallout. In addition, the Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) from a nuclear
   detonation can damage electronic equipment. The best protection is a combination of
   shielding, distance from the blast, and limited time of exposure.
   10.2.5. High-Yield Explosives. High-yield explosives are conventional weapons or devices
   that are capable of a high order of destruction or disruption. Passive defense measures
   include hardening of facilities and establishing stand-off distances for personnel and key
   assets.
AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010                                                           145


10.3. CBRNE Passive Defense Measures. Passive defense measures are those activities
conducted to negate, contain, and manage the effects of CBRNE attack. Passive defense
measures include pre, trans, and post-attack actions designed to mitigate the CBRNE threat
through contamination avoidance, protection, and contamination control.
   10.3.1. Contamination Avoidance. Contamination avoidance is the most important passive
   defense measure. Techniques for contamination avoidance include: inflight diversion,
   survival launch, and minimizing exposure to contaminated cargo, aerospace ground
   equipment (AGE), and material handling equipment (MHE).
      10.3.1.1. Inflight Diversion. When advised that a destination airfield is under CBRNE
      attack or has been contaminated, the aircrew will divert to an uncontaminated airfield, if
      at all possible. Authority to land at a contaminated airfield will be specified in the
      controlling OPORD.
      10.3.1.2. Survival Launch. If caught on the ground during attack warning, every
      reasonable effort will be made to launch to avoid the attack. Upon proper clearances,
      aircrew may launch to survive if they have sufficient fuel and unrestricted, safe access to
      the runway. In practice, this option may only be practical for aircraft that have just landed
      or aircraft at or near the end of the runway. If launch is not possible, shut down engines
      and avoid running environmental control systems. Close aircraft doors/hatches/ramps,
      don Individual Protective Equipment (IPE), and seek personal protective cover on the
      base. If time does not permit using base facilities, remain in the sealed aircraft for a
      minimum of one-hour after the attack and/or follow host-base guidance.
      10.3.1.3. Avoiding Cross Contamination from AGE, MHE, and Cargo. All formerly
      contaminated equipment and cargo must be marked to facilitate contamination avoidance
      and the use of protective measures. Additionally, the air shipment of formerly
      contaminated cargo requires special precautions and must be specifically authorized by
      the senior transportation commander.
   10.3.2. Protection. When exposure to chemical and/or biological agents cannot be avoided,
   protection provides the force with the ability to survive and operate in a CBRNE
   environment. Protection is afforded by individual protective equipment, collective protection,
   and hardening of facilities.
      10.3.2.1. Individual Protective Equipment. The current in-flight protective gear for
      aircrew members is the Aircrew Chemical Defense Ensemble (ACDE). The ACDE
      includes the newer Aircrew Eye-Respiratory Protection System (AERPS) above the
      shoulders and the CWU-66/P or CWU-77/P Integrated Aircrew Chemical Coverall
      (IACC). The Ground Crew Ensemble (GCE) consists of the protective mask, C2 series
      canister (or filter element for MCU-2A/P protective mask), and over garment, boots, and
      gloves. The ACDE and GCE provide protection against chemical and biological agents.
      They do not provide blast or radiation protection from an RDD or nuclear detonation.
      The ACDE requires care during donning using "buddy dressing" procedures and Aircrew
      Life Support (ALS) expertise during processing through the Aircrew Contamination
      Control Area (ACCA). NOTE: AECMs will utilize the MCU-2A series mask.
          10.3.2.1.1. ACDE/GCE Issue. Aircrews will be issued sized ACDE and GCE at
          home station. Aircrews will ensure their ACDE and GCE are available at all times
146                                             AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010


         while in a CBRNE threat area. Aircrew members will confirm the mobility bag
         contents and correct sizes.
         10.3.2.1.2. ACDE Wear During Ground Operations. Because aircraft contamination
         is unlikely to occur during flight, ground operations represent the highest threat to
         aircrew safety. Protection from enemy attacks and exposure to liquid chemical agents
         is paramount. Aircrew should limit activities to essential duties only, and separate
         ground duties from air duties.
      10.3.2.2. Collective Protection. Collective protection provides a temperature-controlled,
      contamination-free environment to allow personnel relief from continuous wear of IPE
      such as the ACDE. The basic concept for most facility collective protective solutions is to
      employ overpressure, filtration, and controlled entry/exit. The intent is to provide rest and
      relief accommodations, as well as provide medical treatment in contamination free zone.
      All pressurization systems should be shut down and doors sealed if the crew finds itself
      in need of immediate protection. Crewmembers should avail themselves of facilities, if
      provided, on the airfield.
      10.3.2.3. Hardening. Permanent and expedient hardening measures are used to
      strengthen buildings and utility systems or provide barriers to resist blast effects. To
      reduce the potential of vapor exposure in facilities without collective protection seal
      windows and doors, turn off HVAC systems and use rooms above the first floor
      whenever possible.
  10.3.3. Contamination Control. In the post-attack environment, contamination control
  measures limit the spread of chemical, biological, and radiological contamination through
  disease prevention measures, decontamination, and use of Exchange Zone (EZ) operations.
  Effective contamination control helps sustain air mobility operations by minimizing
  performance degradation, casualties, or loss of material.
      10.3.3.1. Disease Prevention. Up-to-date immunizations, standard personal hygiene
      practices, and the use of chemoprophylaxis are effective biological warfare defensive
      measures.
      10.3.3.2. Decontamination.
         10.3.3.2.1. Inflight Decontamination. Air washing is a useful inflight
         decontamination technique for removing most of the liquid agent from aircraft metal
         surfaces. However, vapor hazards may remain in areas where the airflow
         characteristics prevent complete off-gassing (i.e., wheel wells, flap wells, rivet and
         screw heads, joints, etc.). Flights of at least 2 to 4 hours are recommended, and lower
         altitudes are more effective than higher altitudes. Fly with the aircraft configured
         (gear, flaps, and slats extended) as long as possible to maximize the airflow in and
         around as many places as possible. Be advised that exterior contamination may seep
         into the aircraft interior creating a vapor hazard for aircrews. Use of ACDE is
         recommended.
         10.3.3.2.2. Limits of Decontamination. Complete decontamination of aircraft and
         equipment may be difficult, if not impossible, to achieve. Formerly contaminated
         assets will be restricted to DOD-controlled airfields and not released from US
         government control.
AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010                                                            147


      10.3.3.3. Exchange Zone (EZ) Operations. The AMC Concept for Air Mobility
      Operations in a Chemical and Biological Environment (CB CONOPS) describes a
      method for continuing the vital flow of personnel into a contaminated airfield while
      limiting the number of air mobility aircraft and personnel exposed to the contaminated
      environment. The purpose of the EZ is to minimize the spread of contamination within
      the air mobility fleet, preserving as many aircraft as possible for unrestricted international
      flight. The EZ is an area (located at uncontaminated airfield) set aside to facilitate the
      exchange of uncontaminated (clean) cargo/passengers to a contaminated (dirty) airframe,
      or visa versa, without cross-contamination. Additional information on the EZ is available
      through HQ AMC/A35.
10.4. Flight Operations.
   10.4.1. Mission Planning. Aircrews must be mentally prepared to face the dangers of
   CBRNE weapons. Flight/mission planning must be thorough. Aircraft commanders should
   emphasize ACDE wear, crew coordination, CBRNE hazards and countermeasures, inflight
   diversion, plans for onload/offload in the event of a ground attack, and plans for the return
   leg in the event of aircraft contamination. Alternative scenario plans should also be
   considered in the event mission-oriented protective posture (MOPP) conditions change.
   10.4.2. Establishing the Threat Level. Aircrews should monitor command and control
   channels to ensure they receive the latest information concerning the destination's alert
   condition. Diversion of aircraft to alternate "clean" locations may be required, unless
   operational necessity otherwise dictates. The 18 AF TACC or theater C2 agency (normally
   through the controlling OPORD) will direct aircrew pre-exposure activities such as medical
   pre-treatment for chemical/biological exposure.
   10.4.3. Fuel Requirements. Extra fuel may be needed to compensate for altitude restrictions
   as the result of CB agent exposure. During purge periods, the aircraft will be unpressurized.
   Although the aircrew can use the aircraft oxygen systems, passengers wearing GCE cannot,
   thus restricting the aircraft cruise altitude and increasing fuel requirements accordingly.
   10.4.4. Oxygen Requirements. Operating a contaminated aircraft will increase oxygen
   requirements. Aircrew wear of ACDE will require use of the aircraft oxygen system to
   counter actual/suspected contamination. Using the 100 percent oxygen setting offers the
   greatest protection in a contaminated environment. Appropriate oxygen reservoir levels must
   be planned to meet higher consumption rates. Use the aircraft Dash 1 charts to calculate the
   required reservoir levels.
   10.4.5. Donning Equipment. Aircrew will don ACDE based on the alarm condition (See
   Airman‘s Manual (AFMAN 10-100). Use the "buddy dressing" procedures, and refer to
   AMCVA 11-303, and AMCVA 11-304 to ensure proper wear. When wearing the ACDE,
   Atropine and 2 PAM Chloride auto injectors will be kept in the upper left ACDE pocket. If
   the integrated survival vest/body armor is worn, the Atropine and 2 PAM Chloride auto
   injectors may be kept in the lower right flight suit pocket. This standardized location will
   enable personnel to locate the medication should an individual be overcome by CWA
   poisoning. M-9 paper on the flight suit will facilitate detection of liquid chemical agents and
   ACCA processing. M-9 paper should be placed on the flight suit prior to entering the
   CBRNE threat area or when an alarm ―yellow‖ or higher has been declared. When inbound
   to a CBRNE threat area, prior to descent, the aircraft commander will ensure crew and
 148                                             AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010


   passengers don appropriate protective equipment IAW arrival destination's MOPP level and
   brief aircrew operations in the CBRNE threat area. As a minimum, this briefing will include:
   flight deck isolation, oxygen requirements, air conditioning system requirements, IPE
   requirements, ground operations, and MOPP levels. Aircrew members must determine if the
   wear of the integrated survival vest/body armor and LPUs will restrict dexterity and mobility
   to the point that it becomes a safety issue. If the aircrew deems the equipment to create a
   safety of flight concern, then the items may be pre-positioned (instead of worn) on the
   aircraft to be readily available to the aircrew.
   10.4.6. Communicating Down-line Support. Pass aircraft and cargo contamination
   information through command and control channels when inbound. This information will be
   used to determine if a diversion flight is required or decontamination teams are needed.
   Report the physical condition of any crew/passengers who are showing agent symptoms and
   whether they are wearing chemical defense ensembles.
10.5. Ground Operations.
   10.5.1. Crew Rest Procedures. Operational necessity may require the aircrew to rest/fly in a
   contaminated environment. If the mission is not being staged by another aircrew or pre-flight
   crews are not available, the aircrew may pre-flight, load, and secure the aircraft prior to
   entering crew rest. The departing aircrew will perform necessary crew preparations and pre-
   flight briefings. Then, they will report to the ACCA for processing with assistance from ALS
   personnel. If possible, aircrew transport should be provided in a covered vehicle. Aircrews
   should avoid pre-flighting the aircraft prior to departure to prevent contamination spread to
   them and/or the aircraft. As aircrews proceed to fly, they will require assistance from ground
   support personnel in removing their aircrew protective overcape and overboots prior to
   entering the aircraft.
   10.5.2. Onload and Offload Considerations. Extreme care must be exercised to prevent
   contamination spread to the aircraft interior during ground operations, particularly to the
   flight deck area. Reduce the number of personnel entering the aircraft. Contaminated engine
   covers, safety pins and chocks will not be placed in the aircraft unless sealed in clean plastic
   bags and properly marked IAW technical order requirements. Aircrew members entering the
   aircraft will remove plastic overboots and over-cape portions of the aircrew ensemble and
   ensure flight/mobility bags are free of contaminants and placed in clean plastic bags. Prior to
   entering the aircraft all personnel should implement boot wash/ decontamination procedures.
   Aircrew exiting aircraft into a contaminated environment will don plastic overboots and
   overcape prior to leaving the aircraft.
   10.5.3. Communications. Conducting on/offloading operations, while wearing the complete
   ACDE, complicates communications capability. Use the mini-amplifier/speaker or the
   aircraft public address system and augment with flashlight and hand signals, as required.
   10.5.4. Airlift of Retrograde Cargo. Only CRITICAL retrograde cargo will be moved from a
   contaminated to an uncontaminated airbase. Critical requirements are pre-designated in
   theater war plans. Onload cargo will be protected prior to and while being transported to the
   aircraft. If contaminated, protective cover(s) will be removed/replaced just prior to placing
   the cargo on the aircraft. It is the user's responsibility to decontaminate cargo for air
   shipment. The airlift of contaminated or formerly contaminated cargo requires the approval
   of the senior transportation commander.
AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010                                                         149


   10.5.5. Passenger/Patients. A path should be decontaminated between the aircraft and the
   ground transportation vehicle to reduce interior contamination when loading/unloading
   passengers/patients. Normally, externally contaminated patients and those infected with
   contagious biological agents will not be transported onboard AMC or AMC-procured
   aircraft. The AMC/CC is the waiver authority to this policy. NOTE: An altitude below
   10,000 feet is recommended due to AECM use of the ground chemical mask.
   10.5.6. Physiological Factors. Aircraft commanders must be very sensitive to the problems
   resulting from physical exertion while wearing ACDE. The aircraft commander should
   consider factors such as ground time, temperature and remaining mission requirements when
   determining on/offload capabilities. Individuals involved should be closely monitored for
   adverse physiological effects.
   10.5.7. Work Degradation Factors. Work timetables need to be adjusted to minimize thermal
   stress caused by wearing the ACDE. Aircrews must weigh all factors when performing in-
   flight and ground duties. The following are degradation factors for wearing full GCE, and
   may also be used to represent the Task Time Multipliers for the ACDE. To estimate how
   much time it takes to perform a task or operation, (1) take the Task Time Multiplier (Table
   10.1) for the appropriate Work Rate and ambient air temperature and (2) multiply it by the
   time it normally takes to perform the task. For example, given a heavy work rate and an air
   temperature of 70F, the crewmember should expect a normal one hour task to take 2.1 hours
   while wearing ACDE. A more extensive discussion of this subject is found in AFMAN 32-
   4005, Personnel Protection and Attack Actions.

Table 10.1. Task Time Multipliers.
Work Rate       Temperature
                20-49 F     50-84 F           85-100 F
                -6 to 9 C   10 to 28 C        29 to 38 C
Light           1.2         1.4               1.5
Moderate        1.3         1.4               3.0
Heavy           1.7         2.1               5.0
   10.5.8. Outbound with Actual/Suspected Chemical Contamination. Once airborne with
   actual/suspected vapor contamination, the aircraft must be purged for 2 hours using Smoke
   and Fume Elimination procedures. To ensure no liquid contamination exists, a close
   inspection of aircrew, passenger ensembles, and cargo will be conducted using M-8 and M-9
   detection paper. Detection paper only detects certain liquid agents and will not detect vapor
   hazards. Above the shoulder ACDE should only be removed if there is absolutely no vapor
   hazard. Be advised that residual contamination (below the detectable levels of currently
   fielded detection equipment) may be harmful in an enclosed space. The aircrew must take
   every precaution to prevent spreading of liquid contaminants, especially on the flight deck
   area. The best course is to identify actual/suspected contamination, avoid those areas for the
   remainder of the flight, and keep the cargo compartments cool. If an aircrew member or
   passenger has been in contact with liquid contaminants, all personnel aboard the aircraft will
   stay in full ACDE/ GCE until processed through their respective contamination control area
   (CCA). Upon arrival, the contaminated aircraft will be parked in an isolated area and
   cordoned to protect unsuspecting ground personnel.

   10.5.9. Documenting Aircraft Contamination. When it is suspected or known that an
   aerospace vehicle or piece of equipment has been contaminated with a radiological,
   biological or chemical contaminant, a Red X and detailed description will be entered in the
   AFTO Form 781, and an annotation will be made in historical records for the lifecycle of the
   equipment.
   10.5.10. 10-Foot Rule. The 10-foot rule was developed in order to provide guidance for
   protecting personnel using or handling contaminated resources (such as pallets) or working in
   locations with materials that might retain a residual chemical. The 10-foot rule embodies a
   safety factor that goes beyond current OSD guidance (which allows removal of IPE
   whenever detectors no longer detect a chemical agent vapor hazard). There are two phases
   associated with the 10-foot rule.
       10.5.10.1. Initial Phase. During the initial phase, personnel will remain in MOPP 4
       whenever they stay within 10 feet of the contaminated equipment for more than a few
       seconds. This MOPP level provides personnel the maximum protection from the
       chemical agent as it transitions from a contact and vapor hazard to a vapor hazard only.
       10.5.10.2. Follow-on Phase. In the follow-on phase, personnel will use gloves (i.e.
       leather, rubber, cloth, etc.) when operating on or handling the contaminated equipment.
       Although a contact hazard is unlikely, relatively small amounts of the agent may still be
       present. The use of gloves will ensure that unnecessary bare skin contact with agent
       residue is avoided.
       10.5.10.3. Table 10. 2. shows estimated times associated with initial and follow-on
       phases of the 10-foot rule. To simplify response processes, commanders may choose to
       use the worst case scenario as the foundation for all 10-foot rule actions, i.e., 24 hours for
       the initial phase and all periods of time greater than 24 hours for the follow-on phase.

                             NAVIGATIONAL PROCEDURES

11.1. Flight Planning:
   11.1.1. Normally, mission planning is accomplished and verified while still in a flight
   planning facility/base operations and then electronically transferred to the aircraft mission
   computer. Use the latest weather, description of the load, landing zone/drop zone, and
   waypoint description information for this planning.
   11.1.2. Prior to filing a flight plan, verify computer products and overprinted flight planning
   forms with current charts and FLIP, as well as NOTAMs, organized track messages, etc. If a
   computer flight plan is not available, complete flight planning and print an AFMSS flight
   plan or other approved form for in-flight use as a navigation and fuel management log.
   11.1.3. Sources for obtaining IRU PPOS coordinates will be in the following priority:
       11.1.3.1. GPS PPOS IAW flight manual.
       11.1.3.2. FLIP/Jeppesen Airfield diagrams or MAJCOM approved parking spot
       handouts.
       11.1.3.3. DoD FLIP En Route Supplement.
       11.1.3.4. Best available chart.
   11.1.4. (Added-3WG) . Flight Plan Filing:
       11.1.4.1. (Added-3WG) . A copy of the flight plan (including IFM missions) will be
       sent to Base Operations via fax prior to every flight.
11.2. Flight Plan/Data Verification.
   11.2.1. Computer Flight Plan (CFP) Use. CFPs are the official sources of performance,
   navigation, and climatic data, including en route wind information. If stand-alone computer
   based plans are used, each mission segment should utilize best wind data available. Use only
   MAJCOM validated CFPs.
       11.2.1.1. Use CFPs to the maximum extent practical. Flight crews may manually
       compute flight plans. The PIC has final responsibility for flight plan accuracy and
       diplomatic clearance compliance.
       11.2.1.2. Verify CFPs for route of flight and fuel computation accuracy before departure.
       Pass any flight plan discrepancies to the C2 flight planning office. On flight-managed
       sorties, promptly notify the flight manager of any flight plan discrepancies, to ensure the
       correct route of flight is filed with air traffic control. Identify inaccurate CFP winds to
       TACC/XOCZF if the average wind for a route segment exceeds either 30° error in
       direction or 25 knots in speed.
 152                                             AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010


11.3. En Route:
   11.3.1. Use all available FLIP en route charts, and prior to departures and arrivals, terrain
   charts, to ensure navigational accuracy and terrain clearance. Periodically crosscheck
   navigation solution (i.e., MC FOM, GPS ERR).
   11.3.2. After loading the flight plan, both pilots will use the ND CHART format in
   conjunction with the DEFINE/REVIEW WAYPOINT pages to insure the proper coordinates
   were loaded for all points in the flight plan, especially the destination.
   11.3.3. If a revised clearance is received, revise the flight plan in the mission computer and
   review the new course.
   11.3.4. Low-level Navigation. When the flight plan and navigation databases are properly
   loaded into the mission computer, the aircraft map Navigation Display (ND) and the MCD
   flight plan become the primary sources of navigation information for tactical low-level
   missions.
11.4. Low-Level Navigation. Threat and emission control requirements permitting, use all
available aids (e.g. mission computer data, navigational aid fixes, map reading) to remain
position oriented.
   11.4.1. While aircraft systems provide a self-contained adverse weather, day/night,
   worldwide navigation capability, pilots assume ultimate responsibility for en route
   navigation, terrain avoidance, and time control. During low level operations, attention should
   be focused outside the aircraft, emphasizing threat detection and situational awareness. Limit
   duties that distract attention from outside the aircraft to mission essential items only.
   11.4.2. A navigation display (ND) map format should be displayed on at least one MFD at
   all times.
   11.4.3. Time of Arrival (TOA) control is primarily accomplished by airspeed adjustments. If
   necessary and appropriate to the situation, use planned alternate legs to gain or lose time, use
   timing triangles, fly inside or outside course line (within mission computer route parameters),
   or use time control holding patterns.
   11.4.4. Means of Navigation.
       11.4.4.1. The mission computer navigation solution, backed-up with map reading, is the
       primary means of navigation on VFR low level routes. If conditions permit, ground-based
       navigational aids can be used as additional information sources.
       11.4.4.2. The mission computer is the primary means of route navigation in IMC. If
       conditions permit, onboard radar, ground-based radar, and/or bearing/distance fixes
       should be used as backups.
   11.4.5. Flight at low altitude can be an effective defensive tactic; however, never fly lower
   than the altitude dictated by the threat or mission. Navigation and objective area
   identification become increasingly difficult when threat avoidance requires low
   ingress/egress altitudes, operations at night, or operations during marginal weather
   conditions.
   11.4.6. Low level modified contour flight is flown with momentary deviations above and
   below the base altitude for smoothness of flight. The radar altimeter used by the pilot flying
AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010                                                            153


   will be operational and the radar altimeter altitude reference marker will be set to 50 feet
   below base contour altitude.
   11.4.7. During IMC or night operations, maintain en route altitude by using the best
   available barometric altimeter setting and radar altimeter information. If reported barometric
   settings are unavailable, use GPS barometric settings (found on the MC APPROACH
   PAGE). When the next leg (or segment) altitude is higher than the leg (or segment) being
   flown, cross the waypoint at the highest altitude. If the next leg (or segment) altitude is lower
   than the leg (or segment) being flown, descend when past the waypoint.
11.5. Post Flight.
   11.5.1. For legs in which suspected navigational error, procedural deviation, or other
   abnormality have occurred, download and retain a copy of the M-PLAN and mission
   HISTORY diskette and all pertinent forms including, but not limited to DD Form 175, DD
   Form 175-1, DD Form 1801, CFP, charts, and navigation log. Units will maintain all
   operational mission data on file (hard disk, diskette file, paper copy, oceanic plotting chart,
   etc.) for 120 days.
   11.5.2. For suspected malfunctions or off-DZ drops, record AIRDROP RECALL
   information before leaving the aircraft.
11.6. Mission Computer Directed Approaches.
   11.6.1. The C-17 mission computer directed approach, using the MC APPROACH page of
   the mission computer, does not ensure obstacle clearance. It only mathematically derives a
   final approach course and glide path from pilot input data.
   11.6.2. AFJMAN 11-226, United States Standard for Terminal Instrument Procedures
   (TERPS) establishes the following planning and flight procedures.
NOTES:
Using these procedures does not imply these procedures will comply with all TERPS criteria.
Approaches into rapidly sloping terrain, or where planning documents have significant errors
will still pose potential flight hazards. Thorough planning and precision flying is a must.
Reference AFTTP 3-3.35A, chapter 7 for techniques on programming Mission Computer
approaches.

11.7. Restrictions on Mission Computer Directed Approaches. NOTE: C-17 Mission
computer approach procedures are intended to be used only in contingency situations when no
other published approach procedure is available. Specific authorization from MAJCOM/ A3/DO
(HQ AMC/A3) is required before performing these procedures in IMC. All crews are authorized
to use these procedures for training in VFR conditions IAW AFI 11-202 Vol 3.
   11.7.1. C-17 crews are not authorized to fly RNAV approaches.
   11.7.2. If a published non-precision (VOR, NDB, TACAN, etc.) approach exists, the crew
   may program the MC to mirror the published approach. You may use MC guidance to back-
   up the ground NAVAIDs. In the event the ground navigation aids become unreliable, the
   crew is not authorized to continue the approach procedure using MC guidance.
 154                                            AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010


   11.7.3. In a contingency, the crew will be provided an approved (TERPS‘ed) mission
   computer approach procedure. All data required to program the approach in the mission
   computer will be included on the approach procedure. This will include any high-precision
   waypoints, weather minimums, and missed approach instructions required to safely execute
   the approach. Use the following procedures when authorized to execute a MC approach.
       11.7.3.1. Mission computer FOM of 3 or better is required to fly the approach.
       11.7.3.2. The PNF will confirm that the MC FOM is 3 or better prior to departing the
       IAF, and again prior to sequencing the FAF.
       11.7.3.3. The PNF will monitor the approach on the MFD map display from the IAF
       until VMC with the runway in sight with the rings set at 1 nm. If the aircraft symbol
       deviates from the magenta line by more than 1/2 nm, as displayed on the MFD map
       display, the PF will execute the missed approach, unless the runway is in sight.
       11.7.3.4. It is highly recommended that the approach be flown with the autopilot coupled
       until VMC.
       11.7.3.5. If ―DEGRADED NAV ACC‖ or ―INSUFF NAV ACC‖ is displayed on the
       WAP during the approach, execute the missed approach, unless the runway is in sight.
       11.7.3.6. Weather minima will be no lower than 600-2.
       11.7.3.7. All of the waypoints required to fly the approach and missed approach must
       exist in the current navigation database. If the waypoints are not in the permanent
       navigation database, then unit tactics will provide a disc with the required waypoints to
       be loaded into the custom navigation database. Aircrew will not manually enter or alter
       the latitude and longitude coordinates for any portion of the approach, or missed
       approach.
       11.7.3.8. Enter all of the waypoints for the approach up to and including the FAF in the
       primary flight plan.
       11.7.3.9. Enter all of the waypoints for the missed approach, starting with the missed
       approach point (MAP), in the secondary flight plan. Special attention should be paid to
       whether each way-point is an ―over fly‖ or ―under fly‖. The MAP is usually an ―over fly‖
       waypoint.
       11.7.3.10. Both pilots will review the entire procedure in the mission computer, verifying
       both the coordinates and the MFD map display for accuracy, prior to commencing the
       approach/departure. If any portion does not agree with the published procedure, the
       approach/departure will not be flown.
   11.7.4. If no published approach exists, develop training approaches IAW paragraphs 11.8
   and 11.9
11.8. Mission Computer Approach Planning Guidance.
   11.8.1. Straight-in approaches:
       11.8.1.1. Ensure the runway is properly defined in either the permanent or custom
       airfield database.
AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010                                                         155


     11.8.1.2. Minima (DH/MDA) will be 500 feet above the highest man-made obstacle or
     terrain feature/spot elevation, or 400 feet plus one contour interval above the highest
     depicted terrain contour whichever is highest, within three nautical miles from the FAF to
     the MAP.
     11.8.1.3. Determine the final approach course (note any difference from runway
     azimuth).
     11.8.1.4. Draw a corridor 3 NM each side of the final approach course.
     11.8.1.5. Plot an IAF, 15 NM from the touchdown zone, along the final approach course.
     11.8.1.6. Plot a FAF, 5 NM from the touchdown zone, along the final approach course.
     11.8.1.7. Plot the MAP.
     11.8.1.8. Determine the controlling obstacle from the FAF to the MAP.
     11.8.1.9. Determine the preliminary DH.
     11.8.1.10. Using Chapter 16 and AFTTP 3-3.35A criteria, determine the ingress altitude
     from the IAF to FAF. Use this, or the highest traffic pattern altitude the weather or threat
     will allow as the GS INTCP ALT.
     11.8.1.11. At the aircraft, crosscheck predicted MC APPR PATH with the GS INTCP
     ALT and ensure that the FAF distance is 5 NM or less from the touchdown zone. If not,
     use the MC FAF distance and determine if a new DH is required.
     11.8.1.12. Use the predicted times and MC slowdown points for time control. See
     AFTTP 3-3.35A, table 7.2 for slowdown planning.
     11.8.1.13. Plan the missed approach.
  11.8.2. Circling approaches:
     11.8.2.1. Determine the final approach course (note any difference from runway
     azimuth).
         11.8.2.1.1. Determine the geographic center of the airport. Plan the circling
         maneuver based on airfield restrictions, a threat, etc. Determine a level off point no
         earlier than 2.5 NM from the center of the airport, along the final course inbound.
         Plan to be at circling minima at this point. Use the airport coordinates as the MAP.
         11.8.2.1.2. Minima (MDA) will be 500 feet above the highest obstacle within 5 NM
         of the geographic center of the airport, or 600 feet above the airport elevation,
         whichever is higher.
     11.8.2.2. Draw a 5 NM (radius) circle around the geographic center of the airport.
     11.8.2.3. Plot an IAF, 15 NM from the airport, along the final approach course.
     11.8.2.4. Plot a FAF, 5 NM from the airport, along the final approach course.
     11.8.2.5. The airport is the MAP.
     11.8.2.6. Determine the controlling obstacle within the 5NM circle.
     11.8.2.7. Determine the MDA.
 156                                            AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010


       11.8.2.8. Using Chapter 16 and AFTTP 3-3.35A, determine the ingress altitude from the
       IAF to FAF. Use this, or the highest traffic pattern altitude the weather or threat will
       allow as the GS INTCP ALT.
       11.8.2.9. Plot a level off point 2.5 NM from the airport, along the final approach course.
       Using 500 feet/NM (no wind) from the level off point to the GS INTCP ALT, confirm
       the FAF distance is 5 NM or less from the touchdown zone. If not, compute a new FAF
       distance (new radius) and determine if a new MDA is required.
       11.8.2.10. Plan the circling maneuver.
       11.8.2.11. Use the predicted times and MC slowdown points for time control. For
       manual slow-downs from 300 KCAS, using SBK 2, slow down approximately 10 NM
       from the FAF (4 minutes ETE). For a pop-up from 300 AGL to 1500 AGL, plan 6 NM
       (2.5 minutes ETE). See AFTTP 3-3.35A, table 7.2 for slowdown planning.
11.9. Planning the Missed Approach Segment of Mission Computer Approaches.
   11.9.1. Determine the missed approach point.
   11.9.2. Determine the missed approach course, and develop a waypoint to fly to 5 NM from
   the geographic center of the airport.
   11.9.3. Determine the altitude required at this first waypoint using Chapter 16 and AFTTP
   3-3.35A low level criteria, MEA or MOCA if applicable, or an ATC required altitude,
   whichever is higher.
   11.9.4. Using 250 feet/NM ensures this altitude can be obtained with one engine inoperative.
   11.9.5. At the aircraft, crosscheck coordinates, courses and distances to ensure accuracy.

                                          Chapter 12

                     AIRCREW MAINTENANCE SUPPORT TASKS

12.1. General. This chapter contains aircrew procedures not contained in the flight manual,
other portions of this AFI, or other publications.
12.2. Responsibilities. Aircrew may assist the normal maintenance function when critical
contingency tasking dictate their use, provided this action does not impact crew duty and crew
rest limits specified in Chapter 3 of this AFI.
   12.2.1. (Added-3WG) . Crews may be asked to assist with engine runs; however, this is
   the exception and not standard practice. If the crew is to assist maintenance with an engine
   run, the PIC will have overall authority and adhere to TO 1C-17A-1, Flight Manual,
   procedures and paragraph 12.9, this supplement. Coordinate with Ground and maintenance
   operations center (MOC) (through 3 WG/CP) and determine the maximum power setting for
   the parking spot.
12.3. Authority to Clear a Red X. Pilots are not normally authorized to clear a Red X. If a
situation is encountered where the aircraft is on a Red X and qualified maintenance personnel are
not available to clear it, the PIC may obtain authorization to clear the Red X from the home
station MXG/CC or designated representative, in accordance with TO 00-20-1. Other crew
members are not authorized to clear a Red X. EXCEPTION: The PIC may clear Red Xs for
engine covers, pitot covers, gear pins and SPR drains when qualified maintenance personnel are
not available, unless prohibited by the home station MXG/CC or OG/CC.
12.4. Refueling/Defueling.
   12.4.1. Aircraft Refueling. Aircrew members qualified in ground refueling may perform
   refueling duties. Crewmembers will normally make a AFTO Form 781 red diagonal entry
   rather than draining the SPR sumps. Aircrews will only refuel in cases when maintenance
   support is not readily available and the mission would be delayed. Crewmembers may
   augment maintenance refueling teams at en route stops.
       12.4.1.1. Avoid refueling with JP-8+100 while transiting airfields with JP-8+100
       capabilities. AMC aircraft are not allowed to operate on JP-8+100, except in emergency
       conditions. All JP-8+100 locations are required to maintain a clean JP-8 capability to
       support transient aircraft. If inadvertent refueling with JP-8+100 occurs, de-fuel the
       aircraft prior to flight, and make an AFTO Form 781 entry stating ―CAUTION: Aircraft
       refueled using JP-8+100, preventative measures must be taken when de-fueling.‖
   12.4.2. Refer to TO 1C-17A-1 and TO 1C-17A-2-12JG-28-1. For normal refueling, two
   qualified personnel are required. If aircrew refueling is required at a base with AMC support,
   the PIC will submit an AMC Form 54, describing the circumstances. Only special operations
   qualified aircrews are authorized to hot refuel/defuel.
       12.4.2.1. (Added-3WG) . One crewmember will operate the ground refuel panel and
       another crewmember will act as the refueling supervisor.
       12.4.2.2. (Added-3WG) .      Aircrews must comply with site-specific refueling
       restrictions. TO 1C-17A-2-12 JG-28-1, Servicing Fuel, directs personnel to ensure the
158                                             AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010


      thin part of the lock tab on the fuel cap is pointing to the 12 o‘clock position. Although
      this may be the case a majority of the time, correct procedure is to ensure the thin part of
      the lock tab on the fuel cap is centered on the word "TOP" located on single point
      refueling (SPR) receptacle itself. In some cases the word ―TOP‖ may be at the 3, 6, or 9
      o‘clock positions.
      12.4.2.3. (Added-3WG) . SPR Sump Drainage. The SPR will be drained only if the
      drained fuel can be disposed of safely. At locations without C-17 maintenance, make an
      entry on a RED DIAGONAL in the aircraft forms that the fuel sumps will be drained at
      the next C-17 maintenance station.
  12.4.3. Concurrent Servicing. Concurrent ground operations (simultaneous refueling or de-
  fueling while cargo or maintenance operations are being performed) are authorized in
  accordance with TO 00-25-172, Ground Servicing of Aircraft and Static Grounding/Bonding.
  Aircrews performing Dash-1 preflight inspections or cargo loading concurrent with servicing
  must have cooperation and close coordination with the Concurrent Servicing Supervisor
  (CSS). Crewmembers may act as CSS. The CSS will remain in continuous intercom contact
  with fuel servicing team members during the entire servicing operation.
      12.4.3.1. Movement into or within the safe area must be under control of the CSS.
      Individuals must properly ground themselves before boarding the aircraft or handling fuel
      servicing equipment. Concurrent servicing, loading, and maintenance must be conducted
      according to TO 00-25-172 and current checklists, which will be reviewed before
      concurrent operations. Current checklist procedures take precedence over TO 00-25-172
      procedures.
      12.4.3.2. Simultaneous fuel and oxygen servicing is not authorized.
      12.4.3.3. Winching of rolling stock and non-spark producing (i.e. wooden) pallets is
      authorized. Driving vehicles equipped with spark arresters is authorized during fuel
      servicing. When loading vehicles without spark arresters, the vehicles must be either
      completely inside the cargo compartment, or outside of the established fuel servicing
      safety zone, before fuel servicing lines can be pressurized.
      EXCEPTION: Diesel and turbo-charged (without waste gates) gasoline-powered
      vehicles can be on-loaded or off-loaded without having to stop fuel flow.
      EXCEPTION: Passengers are prohibited in the cargo compartment during winching.
  12.4.4. The following guidance will be used for fuel servicing (refuel) operations only:
      12.4.4.1. Passengers are not allowed on board unless expressly directed by
      MAJCOM/A3/DO, DIRMOBFOR, or in combat. (EXCEPTION: For AE see Chapter
      20) One crewmember is required to monitor the passenger compartment when passengers
      are on board.
      12.4.4.2. Electric and electronic equipment may be left on provided it does not radiate
      energy; but it must not be turned on or off during refueling.
         12.4.4.2.1. TACAN, Radar Altimeters, and HF radios must be turned off.

12.5. Maintenance Monitor Panel.
   12.5.1. Aircrews will not erase any fault unless specifically directed by maintenance.
   12.5.2. COMP FANS will be selected to operate the OBIGGS compressor fans when any
   crewmember needs to go beneath the cargo floor. The upper ON legend is illuminated when
   the switch is depressed, the lower FANS legend will illuminate when both fans are open.
   When selected closed, the OPEN light will extinguish when both fans are off, then the ON
   light will go out.
12.6. Aircraft Recovery Away from Main Operating Base (MOB). When an aircraft will
land at a base other than the MOB, a crew chief should accompany the aircraft. The PIC is
responsible for ensuring the aircraft is turned to meet subsequent mission taskings. If qualified
maintenance specialists are unavailable, the aircrew is responsible for turning the aircraft to meet
subsequent mission taskings.
   12.6.1. Recovery items the aircrew may be responsible for include, but are not limited to, the
   following:
       12.6.1.1. Parking and receiving.
       12.6.1.2. Aircraft servicing.
       12.6.1.3. Supervision of minor maintenance within local capability.
       12.6.1.4. Minor configuration changes to meet mission tasking.
       12.6.1.5. Securing the aircraft before entering crew rest.
       12.6.1.6. Coordinating aircraft security requirements.
       12.6.1.7. AFTO 781-series forms maintenance.
   12.6.2. In all cases where aircrews must service the without qualified maintenance specialist
   assistance, comply with procedures in this chapter.
   12.6.3. Aircrews are not qualified to accomplish the required ground inspections. In those
   instances where maintenance personnel are not available, the aircrew will enter a red dash
   symbol in the AFTO Form 781A, Aerospace Vehicle Flight Status and Maintenance
   Document, updating current status and enter a red dash symbol and a discrepancy that
   reflects that the applicable maintenance inspection (i.e. pre-flight, thru-flight, basic post-
   flight) is overdue.
12.7. Aircraft Servicing Requirements. When adequate maintenance support is not available,
the air-crew may need to perform certain maintenance tasks. Use the job guides (JG) in Table
12.1 If aircrew servicing is required at a base with AMC support, the PIC will submit an AMC
Form 54 describing the circumstances.
NOTE: Aircrews should consult a qualified maintenance facility when questions/concerns arise
as to performing any maintenance task.

      the aircraft has come to a complete stop and engines are at idle power, chock aircraft
      tires. Keep all personnel and equipment clear of aircraft path during engine run. Do not
      allow anyone to enter the aircraft during engine run without my permission. Whenever
      engines are above idle power, continually observe area behind aircraft and notify me of
      any vehicles or aircraft attempting to pass, take-off, or land behind the aircraft. In case of
      fire, move fire extinguisher to affected area and direct fire truck to the fire. When
      directed, use fire extinguisher as necessary to fight ground fire, do not spray into inlet. In
      case evacuation of the aircraft becomes necessary, there are (give number) people

                CARGO AND PASSENGER HANDLING PROCEDURES

13.1. General. The loadmaster coordinates loading or offloading with air terminal operations or
shipping agencies; plans loads; and supervises loading or offloading operations. Performs
preflight and post flight of aircraft and systems, and computes aircraft weight and balance.
Provides for safety and comfort of passengers and troops, and security of cargo, mail, and
baggage during flight. If airdrop qualified, prepares and rigs equipment for airdrop, and
participates in the aerial delivery of equipment, supplies, and personnel.
   13.1.1. Multiple Loadmaster CRM. Although the C-17 was designed to a one loadmaster
   requirement, situations will arise when more than one will be on board the aircraft. To ensure
   good CRM, the primary loadmaster will assume overall responsibility for completion of all
   checklists and ensure no confusion exists about what duties have been accomplished.
13.2. Responsibilities of Aircraft Loading.
   13.2.1. AMC Designated Stations.
       13.2.1.1. Air freight personnel are responsible for selecting cargo and mail for airlift,
       promptly completing documentation, palletizing cargo, load planning, computing load
       distribution, and moving cargo to and from the aircraft to meet scheduled departure. They
       will advise the loadmaster of destination, size, weight, and type of cargo (classified,
       hazardous, etc.) before starting loading operations to permit proper positioning. They will
       also coordinate traffic activities affecting loading and offloading and assign sufficient air
       freight loading personnel for cargo handling. Air freight personnel are responsible for
       safe positioning of material handling equipment and cargo to or from the aircraft cargo
       door, ramp, or ramp toes. Under supervision of the loadmaster, air freight personnel
       prepare the aircraft for loading, stow loading/tiedown equipment if the aircraft is not to
       be reloaded, physically load the aircraft and tiedown cargo and equipment, and release
       tie-down and physically offload cargo.
       13.2.1.2. The loadmaster is responsible for aircraft preflight, load planning; preparation
       of DD Form 365-4, Weight and Balance Clearance Form F-Transport/Tactical;
       certifying load plans; operating aircraft equipment; supervising and directing loading and
       offloading operations; and cargo tiedown. He or she coordinates with the loading crew
       supervisor to verify cargo against manifests. The loadmaster supervises loading
       operations and is responsible for safe movement of cargo into and out of the aircraft. The
       loadmaster will notify the PIC, command post, or terminal operations officer if loading
       personnel are injured or cargo, aircraft equipment, or aircraft structure is damaged during
       loading or offloading. The loadmaster will brief the PIC on any hazardous cargo and
       cargo jettisonability prior to engine start.
       13.2.1.3. Loads planned by qualified load planners will be accepted by the aircraft
       loadmaster and loaded aboard the aircraft as planned, unless the load or any portion of it
       will compromise flight safety or does not comply with applicable aircraft technical orders
       or USAF and MAJCOM publications. If cargo is refused or rearranged for these reasons,
       forward all applicable information, including a copy of the load plan, to MAJCOM
164                                             AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010


      standardization and evaluation through standardization channels. AMC personnel attach
      an AMC Form 54.
      EXCEPTION: The aircraft loadmaster may deviate from load plans to facilitate ease of
      onload or offload of cargo, accommodate additional passengers, and to alleviate
      unnecessary aircraft reconfiguration without submitting documentation. The aircraft
      loadmaster must take into consideration the next station‘s cargo configuration
      requirements and will ensure the aircraft is in proper weight and balance limits.

      13.2.1.4. The loadmaster is the on-scene expert for load planning and accepting cargo for
      airlift. Some loads are not specifically detailed in applicable directives and require the
      loadmaster to use his or her best judgment, based on training, experience, and knowledge,
      to determine the best and safest method of loading the cargo. When difficulties arise, they
      should seek advice of other personnel (i.e., available loadmasters and squadron, group,
      wing, NAF, or MAJCOM standardization personnel).
         13.2.1.4.1. Non-standard cargo/equipment not contained in the aircraft loading
         manual (TO 1C-17A-9) requires certification for air shipment. The shipper will
         provide a copy of the certification to the loadmaster prior to loading. If the
         certification letter with loading instructions/ requirements is not provided to the
         loadmaster, the cargo will not be loaded. Contact Air Transportability Test Loading
         Agency (ATTLA) or ASC/ENFC at Wright Patterson AFB, OH, voicemail (937)
         255-2330/2547 or HQ AMC/A37V for questions concerning cargo certification.
      13.2.1.5. IAW with ATTLA memo, dated 7 May 2002, certification memos prior to 1993
      are validated to include blanket airlift approval for C-17 airlift. This approval applies to
      cargo previously certified on C-130/C-141 aircraft and for those applications previously
      certified on C-5 aircraft that do not violate the limitations in TO 1C-17A-9 loading
      manual. The aircraft loadmaster is the final authority in determining the validity of
      certifications on C-17 aircraft. If the loadmaster determines the cargo is incompatible
      with aircraft dimensions/ limitations or additional steps/special procedures are required to
      enable a safe onload, a Cargo On/Off Loading Validation Worksheet following the
      procedures in paragraph 13.12 will be required. State the reason for rejection or
      comments and recommendations that aided in a safe on/offload. Forward worksheet to
      HQ AMC/A37V.
  13.2.2. At locations without AMC air terminal or traffic personnel, the shipper assumes
  responsibilities as described in paragraph 13.2.1.1 and provides sufficient qualified personnel
  and material handling equipment for loading or offloading. Loadmaster‘s responsibilities and
  authority are the same as described in paragraph 13.2.1.2 and 13.2.1.3.
  13.2.3. During joint airborne air transportability training (JA/ATT), special assignment
  airlift mission (SAAM), USAF mobility, and contingency missions, the loadmaster can
  accept DD Form 2133, Joint Airlift Inspection Record, as a valid pre-inspection of
  equipment being offered for air shipment. This form, validated by two joint inspection
  signatures (user and transporting force), may be used in lieu of the applicable portions of the
  TO 1C-17ACL-2. The DD Form 2133 will not be used to document preparation of hazardous
  materials. This will be accomplished using the Shipper's Declaration for Dangerous Goods.
AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010                                                            165


13.3. Emergency Exits and Safety Aisles. No part of the cargo load will extend over the edge
of the walkway. Equipment such as spare tires, mirrors, etc., protruding from rolling stock may
extend over the walkway. Netted palletized cargo will not extend beyond the vertical stacking
line of the pallet unless specifically authorized in the loading manual or load certification letter
or when authorized for oversized cargo pallets used as a mobility platform. Dunnage may be
required to raise the oversized cargo above the pallet to provide restraint rail clearance.
NOTE: All passenger hand-carried items must be of a size to fit under the seat and must not
obstruct the safety aisle. Any items that do not fit under a seat or obstruct an aisle way will be
stowed with checked baggage and secured for flight.
   13.3.1. When the load consists of palletized netted cargo or is secured with straps, a 30-inch
   space will be maintained between the cargo and the nearest forward litter, occupied seat or
   nuclear cargo. When the cargo, either palletized or non-palletized, is secured with chains, the
   30-inch spacing is not required.
   EXCEPTION: Maintain 30 inch spacing on Aeromedical Evacuation (AE) missions, when
   carrying litters patients.

13.4. Pre-mission Duties.
   13.4.1. Cargo Missions.
       13.4.1.1. Aircraft loadmasters in coordination with aerial port personnel establish
       loading times. Loading times that differ from the normal pre-departure sequence will be
       established, with PIC coordination, before the loadmaster enters crew rest. Loading time
       is governed by the type of load and complexity of loading procedures (bulk, palletized,
       etc.) not by port saturation or management of aerial port workload levels. When reporting
       for duty, the loadmaster checks in with the air terminal operation center (ATOC) or other
       designated location to obtain load breakdown and assist in load planning as required.
           13.4.1.1.1. Duty Loadmaster Operations. Duty loadmasters are used as a means of
           flow control at stations with limited aerial port personnel and/or when units are
           deployed as part of an Expeditionary Airlift Squadron (EAS) or tactical/contingency
           operation. Duty loadmasters do not relieve the primary aircrew loadmaster of their
           duties. Duty loadmasters ensure items loaded on aircraft do not exceed aircraft
           limitations, and time permitting flight restraint will be applied to all cargo. Duty
           loadmasters will accomplish an Interior Safety Inspection, Basic Aircraft Pre-flight
           and all appropriate loading preparation checklists prior to conducting loading
           operations. After completion of aircraft loading, duty loadmasters will accomplish the
           BEFORE LEAVING AIRCRAFT Checklist unless maintenance personnel remain at
           the aircraft to monitor operating aircraft systems. Primary aircrew loadmaster(s) will
           complete all pre-departure checklists to include the AFTER LOADING GENERAL
           Checklist.
           13.4.1.1.2. Phase II Loading Operations. Phase II is an aerial port loading program
           directly managed and supervised by air transportation personnel. It provides port units
           the flexibility to determine the best time to load or off-load aircraft when aircrew
           support is not available. The intent of the program is to allow aerial port management
           the ability to evenly distribute port workloads. It will not serve as an aircrew
166                                            AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010


         enhancement or alleviate the loadmaster‘s responsibility to on/off load aircraft. Phase
         II on/off load operations are not authorized for:
             13.4.1.1.2.1. In transit aircraft with ground times less than 3+15 minutes
             13.4.1.1.2.2. Loads requiring use of the aircraft winch
             13.4.1.1.2.3. Wheeled equipment/rolling stock that exceeds 30,000 pounds
             13.4.1.1.2.4. Aerial Delivery missions
             13.4.1.1.2.5. Specific loads contained in TO 1C-17A-9, Sec VI, unless identified
             by an asterisk (*) (section VI F only)
      13.4.1.2. Proper cargo documentation must accompany each load. A consolidated
      statement (manifest) will be delivered to the aircraft prior to departure unless one is not
      available due to a lack or failure of the manifest processing equipment. In this case, a
      cargo listing or floppy disks containing manifest information must accompany the load.
      13.4.1.3. Make every effort to exchange tiedown equipment on a one-for-one basis. If
      this is not possible, annotate the AF IMT 4069, Tiedown Equipment Checklist. At non-
      AMC stations, 463L pallets will normally be exchanged on a one-for-one basis.
  13.4.2. Passenger Missions. Maximize seat availability on all missions. It may be necessary
  for crews to perform passenger service functions at stations that do not have this capability.
  These functions include manifesting, anti-hijacking processing, and ensuring visa/passport
  requirements are met. Do not hesitate to contact TACC/XOGX, Aerial Port Control Center;
  DSN 779-0350/0355, commercial 618-229-0350/0355, if any questions arise such as to who
  may travel to specific locations or passport/ visa requirements. Aircraft operating within
  other MAJCOMs which have operational command and control over that aircraft will contact
  the appropriate AMOCC for specific details. File a copy of the passenger manifest with the
  most responsible on-scene agency if there is no base operations, or other agency responsible
  for filing the manifest.
      13.4.2.1. Manifesting. Passenger service or base operations personnel manifest
      passengers at locations with an AMC passenger processing activity.
         13.4.2.1.1. The PIC and loadmaster are responsible to ensure all passengers are
         properly manifested. Loadmasters will brief passengers IAW TO 1C-17A-1 and
         should provide each passenger Air Force Visual Aid (AFVA) 11-300, Passenger
         Safety Card.
         13.4.2.1.2. At locations without an AMC passenger processing activity, aircrew will
         manifest all passengers using DD Form 2131, Passenger Manifest, and leave a copy
         of the manifest with the flight plan. If not filed with the flight plan, annotate the
         location of the manifest on the flight plan IAW AFI 11-202V3.
         13.4.2.1.3. When the aircrew accomplishes manifesting, anti-hijack-processing will
         also be completed by the aircrew IAW AFI 13-207 (FOUO).
      13.4.2.2. Ensure all food items are removed from the aircraft by fleet and returned to the
      in-flight kitchen if an extended delay occurs. Ensure that a copy of AF IMT 129, Tally
      In-Out, is received from fleet to relieve the loadmaster of meal accountability.
AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010                                                         167


     13.4.2.3. Complimentary snacks and beverages are authorized on Transportation
     Working Capital Fund (TWCF) funded missions (including ANG and AFRC flown
     missions) for passenger consumption only. Complimentary snacks are not authorized on
     JA/ATT, Joint Chief of Staff (JCS) exercises, or SAAM missions. The squadron or port
     operations officer will ensure snacks and beverages are placed on board when departing
     AMC stations. When departing from other stations and no snacks or beverages are to be
     placed onboard, the loadmaster may obtain required snacks and beverages from the local
     in-flight kitchen. Direct the in-flight kitchen to bill the accounting and finance office at
     the aircraft's home station. Record all unused snacks and beverages on AF IMT 129 and
     return to the in-flight kitchen for turn-in credit.
     13.4.2.4. Ensure the auxiliary power unit is shut down before boarding passengers unless
     adequate ear protection is provided. A passenger service representative or crew member
     will assist passengers at the bottom of the steps, and the loadmaster will assist in seating
     passengers.
        13.4.2.4.1. Passenger Operation of Emergency Exits. Prior to each flight,
        loadmaster(s) will formulate a passenger emergency egress plan. Different cargo
        configurations will dictate procedures to be used. Only English-speaking, physically
        able adults (age 15 and older) will be seated next to an emergency exit. Loadmaster
        will brief those passengers seated next to troop door(s) or the forward emergency
        escape hatch on proper operation and to open the exit when directed. The intent of
        this briefing is to inform those passengers seated next to emergency exits of their
        duties and responsibilities in assisting the loadmaster(s)/crew during passenger/ troop
        emergency egress
     13.4.2.5. When children under the age of two are accepted as passengers, their sponsor
     has the option to either hold the child or place him or her in a Department of
     Transportation-approved infant car seats (ICS). Although the use of ICS for children
     processed through AMC-owned or controlled terminals (including gateways) is no longer
     mandatory, all passengers (duty and space A), regardless of age, are required to be
     assigned their own seat. This policy will provide an infant and their sponsor with a
     dedicated seat allowing the use of an ICS seat at the sponsor‘s discretion; this mirrors
     current FAA (commercial) standards. The FAA has banned the use of booster seats,
     harnesses, and vest child restraints.
        13.4.2.5.1. Passengers may hand-carry their ICS. If used, these seats will be secured
        to a seat using the seat belt. Adults will not hold infant seats during any phase of
        flight.
        13.4.2.5.2. If the mission aircraft is equipped with forward facing "airline style‖
        seats, secure the seat in the same manner as in an automobile. However, if the aircraft
        is configured with side-facing seats, aircrew must ensure the ICS is adequately
        secured. The design of the sidewall seatbelt makes it difficult to remove enough slack
        to secure the ICS. When removing slack from the seatbelt ensure the buckle remains
        on one side or the other so that it can be easily accessed for release. The PIC is the
        final authority for determining whether the ICS is adequately secured.
     13.4.2.6. Download the baggage of no-show passengers and those removed from a flight.
     In the case of SAAM or exercise missions at non-AMC locations, coordinate with tanker
 168                                            AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010


       airlift control elements or deploying unit commanders to decide if downloading of
       baggage is necessary.
13.5. Passenger Handling.
   13.5.1. The loadmaster is key to good passenger relations. The following common sense
   rules should be observed:
       13.5.1.1. Address passengers by proper titles.
       13.5.1.2. Avoid arguments and controversial subjects, national or international politics,
       criticism of other personnel or organizations.
       13.5.1.3. Offer services or perform duties in a manner indicating a personal interest and
       willingness to help.
   13.5.2. Comments by the loadmaster and the manner in which they are made often determine
   passenger attitudes about the flight. Always remember that passengers are individuals;
   address them collectively only when making announcements.
   13.5.3. In-flight Procedures.
       13.5.3.1. Passengers may move about the cabin after reaching cruise altitude; however,
       judgment must be exercised on the number of passengers allowed out of their seats at any
       one time. Encourage passengers to remain seated with their seat belts fastened. Due to
       concern for their safety, passengers are not allowed to lounge or sleep under or on cargo
       or baggage.
       13.5.3.2. Make frequent checks on the following:
          13.5.3.2.1. Cabin temperature.
          13.5.3.2.2. Passengers with small children.
          13.5.3.2.3. Cleanliness of the cabin and lavatories.
       13.5.3.3. Do not allow passengers to tamper with emergency equipment. Passengers will
       not be permitted access to checked baggage.
       13.5.3.4. On long flights, particularly during hours of darkness, use all possible means to
       make passengers comfortable. Dim and extinguish unnecessary compartment lights.
       13.5.3.5. Passengers may visit the flight deck only when approved by the PIC. Use good
       judgment when requesting this authority.
   13.5.4. Meal Service.
       13.5.4.1. Meals are served at normal hours when practical, based on the local time at
       point of departure. Avoid waking passengers to offer meals. Ask the PIC about expected
       flight conditions prior to meal preparation.
       13.5.4.2. Passengers having a boarding pass, AMC Form 148, Boarding/Pass Ticket,
       showing a meal was ordered are served meals in the following sequence:
          13.5.4.2.1. Small children requiring assistance.
          13.5.4.2.2. Distinguished Visitors (DV).
AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010                                                             169


          13.5.4.2.3. All other passengers.
      13.5.4.3. Use the following procedures for box lunches:
          13.5.4.3.1. After takeoff, distribute box lunches to passengers who boarded at the
          previous station. This lessens confusion when flight segments are short and
          passengers board at subsequent stations.
          13.5.4.3.2. Ensure each passenger receives the meal ordered by verifying the
          passenger's AMC Form 148, Boarding/Pass Ticket.
      13.5.4.4. Do not serve liquids or hot food during turbulence.
      13.5.4.5. Turn in all meals unfit for consumption to the first in-flight kitchen. If in radio
      contact with the issuing station, relay aircraft tail number, mission identifier, number of
      spoiled meals (by menu), issuing organization, and in the case of frozen meals, the
      manufacturing agency, and manufacturer's lot number.
      13.5.4.6. When prepared meals have not been furnished to passengers, the loadmaster
      will annotate the individual's boarding pass to reflect reimbursement is authorized.
      Inform passengers they may receive refunds at the next station or the originating or
      destination terminal.
13.6. Over-Packed Meal Procedures.
   13.6.1. Sign for over-packed in-flight meals and supplements delivered to aircraft. These
   meals have been inventoried and annotated showing the total number of meals in each
   container. Do not open containers for inventory.
   13.6.2. Obtain sufficient blank copies of AMC Form 305, Receipt for Transfer of Cash and
   Vouchers
   13.6.3. At the onload station, contact the troop commander or other individual responsible
   for the mission. The unit or user is responsible for collecting for the meals before the onload
   and for turning the money over to the loadmaster with two separate listings. One listing will
   contain the names of those not on separate rations who are authorized to receive a
   government meal at no charge. The other list will contain names of those on separate rations
   and who pay for their meals. Both listings must be certified by the troop commander or
   individual responsible for the mission. The loadmaster will count the money to ensure the
   total is correct and issue a receipt (DD Form 1081, Statement of Agent Officer’s Account)
   to the user.
   13.6.4. At en route, remain overnight, or terminating stations, turn in the money and both
   listings to the flight kitchen. If a flight kitchen refuses to accept the money or meals, have the
   PIC report the incident on AMC Form 54, Aircraft Commander's Report on
   Services/Facilities. (See Chapter 8 for instructions.) Retain the money or meals and turn
   them in to the next available AMC flight kitchen. When a crew change occurs and the money
   or meals are transferred to the outbound loadmaster, the inbound loadmaster will retain the
   signed receipt as proof of money or meals transfer.
13.7. En Route and Post Flight Duties.
   13.7.1. At stations where a crew change is made and loading or offloading is required, the
   inbound loadmaster is responsible for offloading the aircraft. The outbound loadmaster is
 170                                             AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010


   responsible for planning and loading the outbound load. When no crew change occurs, the
   inbound loadmaster is responsible for onloading or offloading cargo.
   13.7.2. At crew stage points, brief relief personnel about passenger and aircraft equipment,
   any missing items, the location of through cargo, mail and baggage, and any information
   pertinent to through passengers. Point out cargo requiring special consideration (hazardous
   material, perishables, etc.).
   13.7.3. Assist passengers to deplane. If BLUE BARKS, DVs, COIN ASSIST, or couriers are
   aboard, the loadmaster will inform the protocol or traffic representative respectively.
13.8. Loaded Weapons. Weapons are considered loaded if a magazine or clip is installed in the
weapon. This applies even though the clip or magazine is empty.
   13.8.1. Personnel who will engage an enemy force immediately on arrival (actual combat)
   may carry basic combat loads on their person. Weapons will remain clear with magazines or
   clips removed until immediately prior to exiting the aircraft. The troop commander will
   coordinate with the loadmaster prior to directing personnel to load any weapons. This applies
   to airborne assaults and airland missions.
   13.8.2. Personnel who will not immediately engage an enemy force will store basic
   ammunition loads in a centralized location for redistribution on arrival at the objective.
   Magazines or clips will not be inserted into weapons.
13.9. Weight and Balance. Accomplish weight and balance for this airplane according to TO
1-1B-50, Weight and Balance, and AFI 11-2C-17V3, Addenda A, C-17 Configuration/Mission
Planning. The unit possessing the airplane maintains the primary weight and balance handbook
containing the current airplane status and provides a supplemental weight and balance handbook
for each airplane. Enclose the supplemental handbook in a wear-resistant binder (preferably
metal), stenciled "Weight and Balance" with the airplane model and complete serial number on
the cover or spine.
   13.9.1. The supplemental handbook will include TO 1C-17A-5-2, AFI 11-2C-17V3
   Addenda A, sufficient copies of DD Form 365-4, Weight and Balance Clearance Form F –
   Transport/Tactical, to complete the mission and a certified copy of the current DD Form
   365-3, Chart C-Basic Weight and Balance Record. Chart C will include the airplane's
   basic weight, basic moment, and center of gravity.
   13.9.2. The weight and balance section of the unit possessing the airplane will maintain the
   required documents.
       13.9.2.1. Ensure a sufficient amount printer paper is onboard to complete the mission.
       13.9.2.2. The loadmaster will turn in the original DD Form 365-4 to be filed at the
       departure airfield and maintain a physical or electronic copy for the duration of the flight.
13.10. Cargo Validation Onloading and Offloading Procedures and Format. To assist in
the cargo validation process, a cargo validation onloading and offloading format is provided in
this chapter. After completion, send through standardization channels to HQ AMC/A37V. Use
the following format when tasked to validate a new loading procedure or when encountering any
cargo you feel requires special or specific onloading, offloading or tiedown procedures not
currently listed in TO 1C-17A-9.
AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010                                                         171


   13.10.1. General Loading Data:
       13.10.1.1. Nomenclature of item. Give military or civilian name, national stock number
       (NSN), and a brief description of the item, i.e., dump truck, medical van, etc.
       13.10.1.2. Dimensions (in inches). Length, width, and height. Rough drawing or picture
       of the unit, pointing out critical dimensions, projections, overhangs, etc.
       13.10.1.3. Weight (in pounds). Gross weight; individual axle weight; or data plate weight
       if possible.
   13.10.2. Number of loading crew personnel and loadmasters required to onload or offload
   cargo and their position to observe clearances, if required.
   13.10.3. Equipment and Material Requirements. Special equipment and material required to
   onload and offload cargo, i.e., cargo winch, prime mover, shoring requirements.
   13.10.4. Aircraft Configuration Required.
   13.10.5. Preparation of Cargo for Loading. Components that must be removed or
   reconfigured to onload and offload cargo, i.e., helicopter struts, exhaust stacks, cabs, etc
   13.10.6. Loading Procedures.
   13.10.7. Location of Tiedown Points.
   13.10.8. Offloading Procedures.
   13.10.9. Comments.
13.11. Emergency Airlift of Personnel.
13.12. Rucksacks. The following procedures apply to loading of rucksacks.
   13.12.1. In all cases, rucksacks will be loaded on the same aircraft as the individual.
   13.12.2. Transported units must ensure that adequate space is provided on the load plan and
   aircraft to ensure all personnel have an unobstructed path to evacuate the aircraft during an
   emergency.
   13.12.3. During administrative deployments, rucksacks may be loaded on deploying
   vehicles, palletized, or floor loaded. Placing rucksacks on the aircraft floor may increase
   loading and offloading times. Also, this method may require more space and reduce the
   number of personnel or equipment airlifted.
   13.12.4. During tactical deployments into a FOB/OB, rucksacks not loaded on vehicles will
   be carried by the individual onto the aircraft. Normally, floor space will be allocated on the
   aircraft load plan for floor loading rucksacks.
       13.12.4.1. When a flight is planned for a short duration, the following procedures apply:
          13.12.4.1.1. The troops may wear the rucksacks in the seat provided the seats are
          placed in the paratroop configuration.
          13.12.4.1.2. All troops must have quick release straps on their rucksacks.
          13.12.4.1.3. Troops will be briefed to leave their rucksacks on the seat if an
          emergency evacuation is necessary.

       13.12.4.2. The following procedures apply to transporting hazardous materials in
       rucksacks.
          13.12.4.2.1. Personnel will only be permitted to carry their basic combat load or
          individual issue of hazardous material when they will engage an enemy force
          immediately upon arrival. Personnel may retain small arms ammunition (cartridge for
          weapons, DOT 1.4) and nuclear, biological, and chemical equipment as long as it is
          retained in a carrier (i.e., bandoleers, pouches, bags). Weapons will remain clear until
          the aircraft has landed or as directed by the loadmaster.
          13.12.4.2.2. Munitions and other hazardous materials placed in rucksacks, field
          packs, or other authorized containers, removed from their shipping container, must be
          adequately protected from accidental functioning. For airland troops and airdrop
          troops who are not rigged prior to takeoff, all carriers will be consolidated in one
          central location on the aircraft (as directed by the loadmaster) and distributed to
          personnel after landing. Paratroopers rigged prior to takeoff may retain individual
          carriers containing hazardous materials.
          13.12.4.2.3. The troop commander or load team chief will brief the loadmaster
          concerning the individual issue of hazardous materials. The loadmaster will brief the
          PIC.
          13.12.4.2.4. Hazardous materials identified for sustainment must be prepared and
          certified according to AFJMAN 24-204.
13.13. Flight Station and Troop Compartment. Not Used.
13.14. Cargo and MHE Issues. Not Used.
13.15. (Added-3WG) . Transporting Human Remains. Aircrew members must ensure
fallen comrades receive appropriate honors. The following procedures apply:
   13.15.1. (Added-3WG) . Upon closing cargo doors, loadmasters will remove and fold the
   American flag, then secure transfer case with tie-down straps. At offload location, prior to
   opening cargo doors remove tie-down straps and drape American flag over transfer case.
   13.15.2. (Added-3WG) . Position the field of blue at the head of the case, positioned over
   the left shoulder. For missions with multiple cases, loadmasters may remove tie-down straps
   during taxi. Additionally, loadmasters must coordinate with the pilot to reduce taxi speed to
   prevent delay in opening cargo doors upon arrival in parking.
   13.15.3. (Added-3WG) . If a mission terminates at Elmendorf with fallen comrades, ensure
   to keep CP informed of your estimated time of arrival (ETA).

                                       FUEL PLANNING

14.1. General. Fuel Plan IAW this chapter and TO 1C-17A-1-2. Additional fuel planning
considerations can be found in AFTTP 3-3.35A, chapter 6.
14.2. Fuel Planning Profiles.
   14.2.1. AMC CFP Fuel Planning Profile. Using the AMC CFP, AMC aircraft plan to be
   overhead the destination/Begin Descent Point with fuel to proceed to the alternate, holding at
   the alternate, and descent/approach and landing fuel. Normally, the divert profile is based on
   Long Range Cruise (LRC) speed at 10,000 feet for alternates 200 NM air distance or less,
   FL310 or 330 for alternates beyond 200 NM. Holding fuel is based on endurance holding at
   10,000 feet for 45 minutes, or 20,000 feet for 1+15 at the overhead alternate gross weight. If
   a visibility only approach is planned, additional fuel is added to compensate for the climb to
   10,000 feet. Approach and landing fuel is planned only once.
   14.2.2. C-17 Mission Computer Profile. The C-17 mission computer plans a complete climb,
   cruise, descent and approach and landing based on the pilot inserted ROUTE DATA and
   PRFM factors. This fuel is ―En route‖ fuel. The ―Alternate‖ fuel is computed from
   destination to alternate as defined in TO 1C-17A-1-2.
   14.2.3. The mission computer will be used to determine final fuel requirements.
14.3. Fuel Conservation.
   14.3.1. Mission planners and PICs will ensure that fuel in excess of required ramp fuel load
   (RRFL) is kept to an absolute minimum. If actual ramp fuel exceeds RRFL by more than
   10%, the PIC will notify the controlling agency and request defueling assistance. During
   contingencies or exercises in which ferrying fuel is operationally desired, the OPORD or
   OPLAN may authorize excess fuel.
   14.3.2. Aircrews may conserve fuel using the following options:
       14.3.2.1. Delay engine start.
       14.3.2.2. Load to an aft CG.
       14.3.2.3. Select the most expeditious taxi route.
       14.3.2.4. Cruise at optimum altitudes at Long Range Cruise (LRC).
       14.3.2.5. Plan an en route descent profile.
       14.3.2.6. Delay configuration when possible (do not alter flight manual procedures).
14.4. General Fuel Planning Considerations.
   14.4.1. Fuel Loads. Final servicing will be delayed until accurate fuel requirements are
   known. Standard ramp fuel loads may be used.
   14.4.2. Planned Landing Fuel. Plan to land at destination with 16,000 pounds, minimum.
   Normally, this does not require additional fuel added to the flight plan.
 174                                               AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010


   14.4.3. For formation flights, plan using the most restrictive aircraft (i.e., heaviest aircraft for
   altitude restriction, or any other applicable restriction). Select formation on the CFG/OPER
   page.
14.5. Air Refueling (A/R) Fuel Planning.
   14.5.1. Computer flight plans are available which incorporate the unique mission
   requirements of air refueling missions. The CFP system contains aircraft air refueling
   performance characteristics, which enable it to prepare a fuel computation. Items and terms
   unique to the A/R CFP are explained below.
       14.5.1.1. Air refueling information block:
           14.5.1.1.1. Departure date/time - Required takeoff time to meet the ARCT.
           14.5.1.1.2. Departure/destination - Departure and destination ICAOs.
           14.5.1.1.3. Alternate - Primary alternate used to compute flight plan.
           14.5.1.1.4. Ramp GW - Total ramp GW (thousands of pounds).
           14.5.1.1.5. Ramp fuel - Required ramp fuel load (thousands of pounds).
           14.5.1.1.6. Payload - Total cargo/passenger weight (thousands of pounds).
           14.5.1.1.7. Operational weight – Pre-stored aircraft operating weight. Should be
           276.5 or 282.5.
           14.5.1.1.8. ARCT-1/KC-135 Offload - ARCT, type of tanker used, and the fuel
           offload. Tanker can be a KC-135 or KC-10.
       14.5.1.2. The column headings in lines three and four which differ from standard CFPs
       are listed below.
           14.5.1.2.1. ETA/OW - Estimated time of arrival at each checkpoint based on required
           takeoff time and over water checkpoint time.
           14.5.1.2.2. GWT - Aircraft GW at each checkpoint (thousands of pounds).
           14.5.1.2.3. FLREM - Fuel remaining at each checkpoint (thousands of pounds).
           14.5.1.2.4. ONLD - Fuel offloaded by tanker (thousands of pounds).
           14.5.1.2.5. TDR - Total distance remaining
       14.5.1.3. The body of the computer flight plan contains the ARIP, ARCP, BINGO, and
       exit point for the appropriate air refueling track. In addition to the waypoints and
       coordinates for the route of flight, the CFP contains the routing from the BINGO point to
       the primary air refueling alternate. (The MC profile assumes a BINGO point 150 NM
       from the ARCP). A separate fuel analysis is provided for each mission segment,
       departure to ARCP, ARCP to exit, and exit to destination.
   14.5.2. In-flight Fuel Planning. For single and multiple A/R, PICs will compute recovery
   fuel requirements, and required on-load requirements. Reference AFTTP 3-3.35A, chapter 6
   for techniques in making these computations.
AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010                                                         175


14.6. Tactical Fuel Planning.
   14.6.1. For a tactical mission, compute fuel required beginning from the final destination to
   determine appropriate gross weights and stored fuels. Ensure low level time and ground
   operations are accounted for.
14.7. C-17 Optimum Fuel Planning.
   14.7.1. The amount of fuel consumed during a heavy airlift mission is greatly influenced by
   wind-optimized routing, cruise altitude, cruise airspeed, excess fuel, and takeoff and climb
   out profile.
       14.7.1.1. Wind-Optimized Routing. The AMC Computer Flight Plan (CFP) System
       automatically provides aircrews a wind-optimized routing for each mission. After
       verifying valid times, payload accuracy, wind forecasts, etc. the CFP route of flight is
       generally assumed to be the most fuel efficient for the altitude wind conditions.
       14.7.1.2. Cruise Altitude. For the C-17, higher is not always better in terms of fuel. The
       optimum cruise altitude is actually 2,000 to 4,000 feet below the maximum cruise ceiling.
       In fact, fuel efficiency is always higher 2,000 to 6,000 feet below the maximum cruise
       ceiling than at the maximum cruise ceiling because the C-17s large engine fan is more
       efficient at altitudes lower than maximum. Attempt to cruise at optimum altitudes, not
       maximum, for the appropriate aircraft gross weight. The mission computer (MC) does not
       provide optimum altitude for the current gross weight. It only provides a value for
       maximum cruise ceiling and assumes cruise at maximum altitudes if automatic step-
       climbs are enabled in the Route Data page. Consequently, optimum cruise altitude must
       be manually determined. Suggested methods for determining altitudes:
          14.7.1.2.1. As a rule-of-thumb 35,000 feet is the optimal altitude for 430K;
          subtract/add 2,000 feet for every 50K increase/decrease.
          14.7.1.2.2. Use MC Progress Page 2 or Performance Pages to determine maximum
          altitude; the optimum altitude is approximately 3,000 feet below this value.
              14.7.1.2.2.1. If Cruise Performance page shows a Long-Range Cruise (LRC)
              speed of .75M, optimum altitude is 2,000 higher than the current altitude; if LRC
              speed is .74M, then optimum altitude is 4,000 feet higher.
          14.7.1.2.3. If ―held down‖ after flight and fuel planning for optimum altitudes,
          additional fuel consumption will be minimal up to 4,000 feet below the optimum
          altitude filed. Consider the following:
          14.7.1.2.4. Request a Mach change and fly the Mach number corresponding to the
          LRC speed on the MC Cruise Performance Page 1. Not reducing Mach speed as gross
          weight decreases imposes substantial and unnecessary fuel penalties over long
          periods of time.
          14.7.1.2.5. En route time will not change substantially from the CFP since TAS will
          be higher at the same Mach at the lower altitude.
       14.7.1.3. Cruise Speed. Maximum Range Cruise (MRC) speed is the speed that will
       attain the maximum miles per unit of fuel at a given gross weight and altitude. MRC can
       be determined by referencing the specific range charts in Part 5 of TO 1C-17A-1-1
176                                             AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010


      (Cruise Chapter). The MRC point is located at the apex of each specific range parabola.
      If, and only if, the aircraft is at the optimum cruise altitude for the gross weight, then
      MRC speed is approximately .74M. For example, at FL290 and a gross weight of 400K,
      MRC is .67M. In this situation, flying .74M would be very fuel inefficient. Long-Range
      Cruise (LRC) speed is the speed where 1% of fuel range is sacrificed to obtain a 4-6%
      speed increase/time advantage over MRC. LRC is provided on the Cruise Performance
      page of the MC and is intended for use on most missions. It can also be determined by
      referencing the specific range charts in TO 1C-17A-1-1. If the aircraft is at the optimum
      altitude for the gross weight, LRC speed will equal approximately .76M. Winds may
      have a significant effect on LRC speed. The MC-computed LRC speed and TO 1C-17A-
      1-1 LRC charts assume no wind conditions. A good rule-of-thumb is to increase LRC
      speed by .02M for every 100 knots of headwind and decrease LRC speed by .02M for
      every 100 knots of tailwind. For example, with a 150-knot headwind, LRC speed should
      be adjusted from .76M to .79M. In nearly every case, the fuel difference between .74M
      and LRC will be negligible (1%) but the en route time difference will be significant (4-
      6%). At optimum altitude, LRC speed is approximately 440 KTAS (enter this number for
      the TAS on the DD Form 175 or 1801).
      14.7.1.4. Selection of the alternate airfield is also an important factor in fuel
      conservation. In most cases, fuel plan to the closest suitable alternate to your destination.
      An obvious exception is situations requiring two-alternate flight plan filing. The decision
      to fuel plan to the closest alternate should be based on common sense and good judgment
      after a careful review of weather conditions, NOTAMs, fuel and NAVAID availability at
      the alternate airfield, load bearing capacity, etc. The important point is to not arbitrarily
      select distant alternates to "hide" fuel but rather to have good rationale and reason for the
      alternate you select for fuel planning purposes. If fuel planning to an alternate very close
      to your destination (e.g., Shaw AFB for Charleston AFB) don't forget to check the
      Progress Page 1 to ensure the predicted fuel at destination exceeds 16,000 pounds (per
      14.4.2). If necessary, enter identified extra fuel into the fuel plan page.
      14.7.1.5. When appropriate, enter identified extra fuel into the fuel plan page. Table 14.1
      lists appropriate fuel penalties for conditions.

                                          Chapter 15

                                      AIR REFUELING

15.1. General. This chapter establishes procedures for aircrews to air refuel the C-17 and is in
addition to procedures in the flight manual, and air refueling manual.
15.2. A/R Limitations. The following limitations apply
   15.2.1. Tanker Autopilot. Tanker pilots will notify receiver pilots when any axis of the
   autopilot is not used. If the tanker copilot is required to fly autopilot-off for training,
   unqualified receiver pilots will not fly the aircraft (N/A FTU). Tanker pilots will notify the
   receiver when copilot autopilot-off training is conducted and receive confirmation that the
   receiver pilot flying the aircraft is qualified.
   15.2.2. A/R Without Tanker Disconnect Capability. Without tanker disconnect capability
   means the boom operator cannot trigger an immediate disconnect. A/R will not be conducted
   after a loss of tanker disconnect capability.
   EXCEPTION 1: Fuel emergency situation.
   EXCEPTION 2: Contingency missions, JCS alert, ORI or CORI, Prime Nuclear Airlift
   Force (PNAF) support missions under normal conditions when the refueling is essential for
   home base recovery, or for any mission when authorized.
NOTE: When conducting A/R without tanker disconnect capability, limit contacts to the
minimum number necessary to complete mission requirements. Do not accomplish boom limit
demonstrations, or practice emergency separations while in the contact position.
   15.2.3. Manual Boom Latching (MBL) (also referred to as Emergency Boom Latching
   (EBL), Override Boom Latching (OBL) and amplifier override). This is an emergency
   procedure. Normal tanker disconnect capability and automatic disconnect limits are
   inoperative. Use of this procedure must be authorized in the mission directive.
NOTE: The boom operator and receiver pilot will coordinate all actions as required by
applicable directives and checklists when making A/R contacts using emergency boom latching
procedures.
   15.2.4. Reverse A/R procedures will be accomplished for operational necessity only.
   15.2.5. Emergency Separations/Breakaways. Follow procedures in IAW TO 1-1C-1-35.
   When separation between receiver and tanker has been effected, the receiver pilot advises the
   tanker "WELL CLEAR" and states altitude passing. When the situation has stabilized,
   coordinate clearance back to precontact. Restrict all emergency separations/breakaways to
   500‘ below individual tanker‘s altitude.
   15.2.6. Practice Emergency Separations:
       15.2.6.1. Prior to the actual accomplishment of a practice emergency separation,
       coordination between the tanker pilot, boom operator, and receiver pilot is mandatory.
       Coordination will include when the separation will occur and who will give the command
       of execution.
AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010                                                               179


       15.2.6.2. Prior to initiating practice emergency separations from the contact position, the
       receiver will ensure their A/R system is not in the override mode.
NOTE: Practice emergency separations will terminate no lower than 500‘ below tanker altitude.
   15.2.7. Receiver A/R Training for Unqualified Receiver Pilots. (This includes copilots,
   aircraft commander upgrade candidates and aircraft commanders refueling from the right
   seat.) In-flight training will be accomplished under direct IP supervision. The following
   procedures apply:
       15.2.7.1. The receiver pilot will inform and receive acknowledgment from the tanker.
       The boom operator at the controls will be qualified for the applicable category receiver.
       (This restriction does not apply during FTU training provided the student boom operator
       is under direct instructor supervision.)
       15.2.7.2. For receiver pilot initial qualification or requalification, the receiver instructor /
       examiner pilot will be in one of the pilot seats with immediate access to the controls
       through all phases of the refueling from pre-contact until post air refueling.
   15.2.8. If a change of pilot control is made, the receiver aircraft will move back to at least
   the pre-contact position except for immediate assumption of control by the instructor pilot.
   15.2.9. If a receiver seat change takes place, move back to at least 100 feet in trail of the
   tanker and to a point where the receiver pilot can maintain visual contact with the tanker until
   the seat change is complete.
   15.2.10. When conducting A/R behind a KC-135, tanker disconnect capability will be
   demonstrated by a boom operator initiated disconnect before conducting a limit
   demonstration or a practice emergency separation from the contact position.
   15.2.11. Weather Limitations.
       15.2.11.1. Turbulence: Do not launch if severe turbulence is forecast on the refueling
       track. Terminate refueling if moderate turbulence is encountered.
       15.2.11.2. Visibility: Do not close from 1 NM range (2 NM for receiver or tanker
       formations) unless you have visual contact with the tankers. Discontinue refueling if in-
       flight visibility is insufficient to continue safe refueling operations.
       15.2.11.3. A/R alternate airfields must meet the criteria of AFI 11-202, V3 for alternate
       airports.
   15.2.12. NVG Use During A/R. Pilots may use NVGs during air refueling rendezvous to
   acquire the tanker but must remove goggles NLT one nautical mile from the tanker.
15.3. Communications Failure. Aircraft experiencing two-way communications failure during
the conduct of A/R shall continue flight in accordance with the following procedures:
   15.3.1. Squawk code 7600 for at least 2 minutes before exiting the track or anchor.
   15.3.2. Aircraft that have not received altitude instructions beyond the exit point shall exit
   the track or anchor at the lowest altitude specified in the clearance for the refueling portion of
   the flight and proceed in accordance with "Procedures for Two Way Radio Failure IFR-VFR"
   set forth in DOD Flight Information Handbook.
 180                                            AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010


15.4. Operational Reporting. Air refueling command and control reporting will be in
accordance with Chapter 2 of this instruction.
15.5. MARSA Applicability for Aerial Refueling. MARSA begins between the tanker and
receiver when the tanker advises ATC that it is accepting MARSA. MARSA is not an ICAO
recognized term. If in doubt as to what separation is provided by ATC, or what separation the
aircrew is responsible for, query the tanker and/or controlling agency.
   15.5.1. If MARSA has not been accepted by the tanker before the receiver reaches the air
   refueling initial point (ARIP), the receiver may be required to hold at the ARIP.
   15.5.2. Once the rendezvous is completed, headings and altitude assignments may be made
   with the tanker concurrence with MARSA remaining in effect.
   15.5.3. Upon completion of the rendezvous, receiver aircraft will remain within 3 miles of
   the tanker until MARSA is terminated.
   15.5.4. MARSA ends when normal separation standards are established, ATC accepts
   control at end of refueling and ATC advises MARSA is terminated.
15.6. Altitude Reservations. An ALTRV is authorization by a central altitude reservation
function (CARF, EUCARF, PACMARF, CARU) or the appropriate ARTCC/CERAP under
certain circumstances, for airspace utilization under prescribed conditions. Air refueling on
operational missions often utilizes an ALTRV under these conditions. ALTRVs may include all,
a portion, or portions of the intended route of flight. Request and approval format can be found
in FAA 7610.4J.
   15.6.1. PICs will ensure ALTRV approval is received prior to mission execution. ALTRV
   status may be verified through the appropriate 18 AF TACC cell.
   15.6.2. Aircraft must depart within the assigned AVANA (ALTRV Void if Aircraft Not
   Airborne) time for the purpose of providing separation between altitude reservations. Normal
   AVANA will be 1 hour. If a mission is to be delayed beyond the AVANA time, coordinate
   with the C2 authority as soon as possible. Rescheduling will normally be in 24-hour
   increments after the original schedule.
   15.6.3. Aircraft on an ALTRV must operate within the altitude, time, and areas specified in
   the approval. An ALTRV APVL authorizes the aircraft to climb or descend as specified.
   Controllers are not required to issue a climb or descent clearance for the various flight
   segments. They may, however, request that the pilot advise them prior to initiating an altitude
   change.
   15.6.4. In a non-radar environment, the aircraft shall advise ATC if actual fix timing will be
   more than plus or minus 5 minutes from the planned ALTRV en route fix estimate.
   15.6.5. File flight plans (1801 or DD175) containing ALTRVs IAW FLIP GP. Include the
   name of the ALTRV in the remarks section of the flight plan. ALTRV requests or approvals
   do not eliminate the responsibility to obtain proper diplomatic clearance or file flight plans.
15.7. Receiver Aircraft Commander Responsibilities.
   15.7.1. Receiver aircraft shall squawk normal when separation from the tanker is greater
   than 3 miles.
AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010                                                          181


   15.7.2. Receiver aircraft will maintain two-way radio contact with ATC until cleared to the
   refueling block altitude, established in that block, and cleared to the A/R frequency by ATC.
   15.7.3. Pilots are reminded that oceanic clearances and an acknowledged readback are
   required for all flights within North Atlantic (NAT) controlled airspace. References for
   oceanic clearance procedures are FLIP Area Planning (AP)/2 and the NAT Minimum
   Navigation Performance Specification (MNPS) Manual.
      15.7.3.1. Receiver pilots will not rely on the tanker to obtain and readback oceanic
      clearance. To the maximum extent possible, receiver pilots should obtain their own,
      individual clearance from the oceanic control authority of the airspace in which they
      intend to operate, prior to entering oceanic airspace. Pilots will request oceanic clearance
      prior to oceanic entry point IAW procedures established in AP/2 and NAT MNPS
      Manual. Consider obtaining clearance and providing read-back prior to rendezvous and
      air refueling.
      15.7.3.2. Tanker aircraft will not accomplish clearance readback for receiver aircraft.
      Receiver ACs are responsible for ensuring that oceanic clearance is always readback to
      the controlling authority by a member of their crew, and acknowledged by the oceanic
      controlling authority, prior to entering oceanic airspace.
15.8. Tanker Aircraft Commander Responsibilities. Tanker ACs are responsible for:
   15.8.1. Remaining within the protected lateral, longitudinal, and vertical airspace of the
   refueling track or anchor including orbit patterns.
   15.8.2. Notifying the appropriate ATC facility of all altitudes vacated and not anticipated for
   further use by refueling aircraft. Such altitudes shall not be reoccupied without further ATC
   clearance.
   15.8.3. Receiver navigation, regardless of the number of tankers or receivers, after
   rendezvous completion through completion of refueling operations (A/R and MARSA have
   been terminated) except when under control responsibility of a military radar facility while in
   an anchor area.
   15.8.4. Maintaining communications with the appropriate ATC facility. All communications
   during refueling operations, including those concerning the receivers, shall be between the
   ATC facility or military radar unit and tanker. To the extent practical, receivers shall
   establish communications with the tanker prior to or when departing the ARIP on the
   specified A/R frequency. The tanker shall assume position reporting responsibility for the
   receivers upon rendezvous completion.
   15.8.5. Coordinating altitude and route clearance:
      15.8.5.1. From the ATC facility for receivers and tanker at least 5 minutes prior to
      refueling completion except when both aircraft are operating on an approved altitude
      reservation (ALTRV).
      15.8.5.2. Through the radar controller when operating in refueling anchors with military
      ground radar. At least 5 minutes prior to completing refueling operations, the military
      radar facility shall forward requests to the assigned ATC facility and subsequently relay
      ATC clearances for the tanker and receiver aircraft from the ATC facility.
 182                                              AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010


       15.8.5.3. Tanker aircrews should not normally obtain oceanic clearances for receiver
       aircraft intending to operate in NAT oceanic airspace. This is a receiver AC
       responsibility.
       15.8.5.4. Tanker aircrews will not readback receiver aircraft oceanic clearance. This is a
       receiver AC responsibility.
   15.8.6. Vertically positioning aircraft prior to reaching the planned exit point, to facilitate the
   safe and efficient transfer of separation responsibility from the military, under the provisions
   of MARSA, to the ATC facility on completion of refueling operations. Vertical separation of
   receivers and tankers shall be accomplished within the assigned altitudes.
   15.8.7. Providing each receiver, upon request, with the aircraft's position at the completion
   of refueling operations. Additional information concerning amendments or changes to the
   receiver's ATC clearance shall also be provided as appropriate.
   15.8.8. Coordinating all refueling formation operations to ensure all aircraft are in proper
   post air refueling formation prior to cell breakup. Prior to terminating air refueling, the lead
   tanker will confirm all aircraft in the formation are in proper post air refueling position with
   required lateral/vertical separation.
15.9. ATC Clearance. A/R operations are normally conducted on tracks or anchor areas
published in DOD FLIP. Operational considerations may require A/R outside published areas or
within an ALTRV. The tanker aircraft commander shall receive specific ATC clearance from the
appropriate ATC facility for the following:
   15.9.1. Entry to/exit from assigned aerial refueling altitude block (except on an approved
   ALTRV).
   15.9.2. Altitudes requested for tanker and receiver aircraft upon completion of air refueling.
   15.9.3. Routing for each aircraft or formation flight when exiting the refueling track prior to
   or beyond the exit point, or different from the flight plan routing.
   15.9.4. Extending the refueling operations beyond the track or anchor exit point due to
   adverse winds, mission requirements, etc.
   15.9.5. Use of altitudes in excess of those for which specific clearance has been granted (i.e.,
   tobogganing).

                             COMBAT MISSION PLANNING

16.1. General. This chapter provides general combat mission planning guidance for planners
and air-crews, standardizing procedures for planning, briefing, and reviewing all missions.
Planners and aircrews should reference AFTTP 3-3.35A for additional mission planning
guidance.
   16.1.1. Pilots require one full day of planning for any missions employing NVGs in the low-
   level environment.
16.2. Assault Landing Zones (ALZ). Assault landing zone operations are conducted to
introduce or evacuate personnel and/or equipment to or from hostile, denied, or unsecured
territory. As a general rule, DZ selection considerations also apply to ALZ selection. Aircraft
performance limitations will be taken into account when selecting an ALZ location. Landing
zone size, lighting patterns, and composition criteria are contained in AFI 13-217.
NOTE: OG/CC is the approval authority for the use of semi-prepared landing zones on missions
within the U.S. to include Alaska and Hawaii. MAJCOM A3/DO approval is required in all other
instances. Reference AMCI 11-208 for coordination process.
   16.2.1. Plan approaches to the ALZ IAW AFTTP 3-3.35A and the airfield identification
   procedures published in the OPORD or SPINS. Brief any deviations from approaches
   described in AFTTP 3-3.35A. Where multiple options are available, select the approach
   which best minimizes exposure to the threat while still allowing a high probability of landing
   on the first approach. Remain unpredictable. If no published approach exists, mission
   computer approaches, when approved, may be built and flown IAW Chapter 11 of this
   instruction.
NOTE: The PIC must ensure landing TOLD data reflects the possibility for a landing at the end
of the zone, and any planned delay in braking due to heated brakes (subtract landing/safety zone
distances from runway available to ensure adequate runway exists for rollout).

   16.2.2. (Added-3WG) . If the mission computer provides ground roll versus landing
   distance data for the selected runway, the runway must be marked in accordance with AFI
   13-217, Drop Zone and Landing Zone Operations, and assault procedures must be executed
   (that is, touching down in the specified touchdown zone and using TO 1C-17A-1 Assault
   Landing procedures).
16.3. Route Planning. To the maximum extent possible, crews should follow guidance listed in
AFTTP 3-3.35A, chapter 4.
   16.3.1. (Added-3WG) . Locally Developed Training Routes. All ―M‖ Series, ―S‖ Series
   and station keeping equipment (SKE) routes depicted in the 3rd WG In-Flight Guide C-17A
   Supplement are available for use. Additionally, any low level route drawn entirely in the low
   altitude tactical navigation (LATN) area defined in the 3rd WG In-Flight Guide C-17A
   Supplement is available for use. Low level routes or portions of routes outside the LATN
   must comply with applicable flight publications (FLIP)/Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR).
   Crews will reference and plot all applicable LATN restrictions found in the 11th Air Force
 184                                             AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010


   Airspace Handbook. This handbook can be found in the C-17 E-Pubs. Aircrews will also
   abide by the LATN restrictions listed in the 3rd WG In-Flight Guide C-17A Supplement.
   16.3.2. (Added-3WG) . To reduce potential for midair collision, aircrew will review low
   altitude charts for visual rules (VR) and instrument rules (IR) MTRs and annotate conflict
   areas along the proposed route.
16.4. Low Level Altitude Restrictions. Low level altitudes will depend upon conditions such
as terrain, threat, the necessity to avoid detection, and equipment limitations. The following
minimum altitudes are established for MAF airlift operations. FLIP/ICAO procedures, training
considerations, terrain, or operational directives may dictate higher altitudes.
WARNING: Aeronautical charts do not depict man-made obstacles less than 200 feet AGL or a
change in terrain until it exceeds the chart contour interval. The worst situation would occur if a
199-foot tower sat on terrain with an elevation just below the next higher contour. For a TPC
(1:500,000) with a contour interval of 500-feet, this results in an uncharted obstacle existing 698
feet above charted terrain. Additionally, the highest spot elevation on any given leg may not be
the highest terrain as in the case of gradually rising elevations. Planners will ensure accurate
terrain analysis by evaluating both spot elevations and the highest contour level. Refer to Figure
16.1., Inherent Chart Errors.

CAUTION: Some charts may depict terrain and obstacle altitudes in meters versus feet (e.g. JOG
and TLM charts in some areas of the world).
AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010                                                            185

   16.4.1. Day VMC En Route. Plan a minimum of 500 feet AGL (300 feet AGL on approved
   routes) modified contour altitude above the terrain using visual references, HUD, and radar

   16.4.2. Night VMC En Route. Plan en route legs at an indicated altitude of 500 feet above
   the highest obstruction to flight (man-made obstacle, terrain feature, or spot elevation), or
   400 feet plus one chart contour interval above the highest depicted terrain contour, whichever
   is highest, within 5 NMs of route centerline to include the aircraft turn radius over each turn
   point (10 NMs outside of the U.S.). If the altitude for the next leg is higher than the current
   leg altitude, climbs will be completed before the turn point. If the altitude for the next leg is
   lower, do not initiate descent until after the turn point. Legs may be segmented to allow flight
   closer to the ground. Once the obstruction is visually identified and the aircraft is confirmed
   well clear, the crew may descend to the next segmented altitude, if lower. See Figure 16.2.
NOTES:
1. AMC FOM of 5 or better is required in order to fly lower than MSA at night.
2. Planning a route on a JOG chart, if available, may reduce night en route altitudes. If the route
has been planned on a JOG and night altitudes are verified, the route may be flown with the
lower altitudes when flying with reference to a TPC.

Figure 16.2. Night VMC En Route Altitude.




   16.4.3. NVG En route. Plan en route legs at an indicated altitude of 500 feet above the
   highest spot terrain elevation, or 400 feet plus one chart contour interval above the highest
   depicted terrain contour, whichever is higher, within 3 NM on centerline. Three miles prior
   to the charted man made obstacle, within 3 NM of centerline, the aircrew must visually
   identify the obstacle. If the obstacle is not identified by 3 NM, climb to attain an altitude 500‘
   above the obstacle. If the altitude for the next leg is higher than the current leg altitude,
   complete the climb prior to the turn point. If the altitude for the next leg is lower than the
   current leg, do not initiate descent until over the turn point. Legs may be divided into
   segments for night altitude computations, depending on terrain differential or threats in order
   to allow flight closer to the terrain. Once the controlling obstacle or terrain feature is visually
   identified and the aircraft is confirmed well clear, the crew may descend to the next
   segmented altitude.
   NOTES:
     1. AMC FOM of 5 or better is required in order to fly lower than MSA at night.
AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010                                                            187


       2. Planning a route on a JOG chart, if available, may reduce night en route altitudes. If
       the route has been planned on a JOG and night altitudes are verified, the route may be
       flown with the lower altitudes when flying with reference to a TPC.
   16.4.4. Minimum Safe Altitude (MSA). MSA is an initial VFR altitude that provides
   additional terrain clearance while the aircrew analyzes situations that require interruption of
   low-level operations (route orientation and aircraft malfunctions or when either pilot will
   leave the seat during low-level operations, etc). An MSA will be computed for each leg or
   route segment or entire low level route. The MSA is 1000 feet above the highest obstruction
   within 5 NMs of route centerline.
   16.4.5. Minimum IFR En Route Altitude. Compute Minimum IFR En Route Altitude by
   adding 1000 feet (2,000 feet in mountainous terrain as defined in AIM, paragraph 5-6-5,
   ADIZ Boundaries and Designated Mountainous Areas) above the highest obstruction to
   flight (man-made obstacle, terrain feature, or spot elevation) within 5 NMs of route
   centerline (10 NMs outside the US). This altitude should be rounded off to the next higher
   100-foot increment. If the altitude for the next leg is higher than the current leg altitude,
   climbs will be completed before the turn point. If the altitude for the next leg is lower, do not
   initiate descent until after the turn point.
       16.4.5.1. Minimum altitudes for IFR operations within published Military Training
       Routes (MTRs) in US sovereign airspace will be computed leg minimum IFR En Route
       Altitude unless a higher altitude is required by FLIP AP/1B. The min IFR altitude may be
       above the top of the MTR leg altitude. In this case, the aircraft will slow to 250 KCAS or
       less, contact ATC and coordinate an alternate clearance.
       EXCEPTION: After thorough route planning by the crew and approval from the wing
       tactics office and OG/CC, aircraft may fly the top of the block on an MTR when that
       altitude is less than min IFR en route altitude. For multiple use local MTRs, OGV will
       issue local approval and restrictions in their unit supplement to this instruction.
   16.4.6. Emergency Safe Altitude (ESA). ESA is designed to provide positive IMC terrain
   clearance during emergency situations that require leaving the low level structure. Several
   ESAs may be computed for route segments transiting significant terrain differentials or a
   single ESA may be computed for the entire low level route. To compute ESA, add 1,000 feet
   (2,000 feet in mountainous terrain) to the elevation of the highest obstruction to flight within
   22 NMs of planned route centerline.
NOTES:
1. Climbing to ESA may put the aircraft or formation in a controlled (i.e., IFR) altitude structure
requiring coordination with Air Traffic Control agencies.
2. Pressure altimeters are calibrated to indicate true altitudes under International Standard
Atmospheric (ISA) conditions. Any deviation from these standard conditions will result in
erroneous readings on the altimeter. This error becomes important when considering obstacle
clearances in temperatures lower than standard since the aircraft‘s altitude is below the figure
indicated by the altimeter. Refer to the Flight Information Handbook to determine correction.
16.5. Peacetime Route Restrictions. In addition to restrictions in AFI 11-202V3, specific
country or theater of operations publications, and FLIP area planning, routes should not be
planned or flown:
 188                                            AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010


   16.5.1. With less than 1 NM separation (3 NMs when in excess of 250 KCAS) when below
   2000 feet AGL from known sensitive environmental (i.e., hospitals, fish hatcheries, large
   poultry complexes, recreation areas, institutions, etc).
   16.5.2. With less than 3 NMs separation from prohibited airspace.
   16.5.3. With less than 3 NMs separation from nuclear power plants.
   16.5.4. Through restricted airspace, except transition or termination in such areas where the
   planning unit is a primary using agency or has approval of the controlling agency.
   16.5.5. In weather conditions less than those specified in this instruction and AFI 11-202V3.
   16.5.6. Below 1000 feet AGL within a 2000 feet radius over cities or towns shown as
   magenta shaded areas on 1:500,000 (TPC) scale charts.
   16.5.7. Over or through active live fire or impact areas that may not be specifically
   designated as prohibited or restricted areas.
   16.5.8. Below 500 feet AGL unless:
       16.5.8.1. Host nation rules specifically allow such VFR operations.
       16.5.8.2. Routes or training areas have been environmentally assessed and surveyed for
       300-foot AGL operations. This restriction does not apply to one-time-use routes. Consult
       FLIP AP/1B for published Military Training Route restrictions.
16.6. Navigation Chart Preparation. Mission planners will construct a master chart for
mission briefings and aircrew reference. Planners may construct the chart using computerized
mission planning systems if available. Sectional charts depict controlled airspace. Low-level
navigation charts will be annotated with any added, deleted, or changed information in the most
recent CHUM or supplement. In no case will CHUM coverage be less than 22 NMs either side of
the entire planned route of flight. Crews may trim charts to no less than 10 NMs after
establishing the ESA. Color copies, if available, of a master chart reduce the probability of
missing or misplotted data on aircrew charts.
CAUTION: 1:50,000 and smaller scale maps do not depict aeronautical information, may not
show man-made obstacles, and are rarely updated through the CHUM.
   16.6.1. Chart Annotation. Individual chart annotations should have, as a minimum,
   turnpoints, IP, DZ, course line, course data, CHUM data and date, ESA and chart series/date.
   Reference AFTTP 3-3.35A for common chart annotations.
   16.6.2. (Added-3WG) . Aircrews should analyze the objective (runway or assault landing
   zone (ALZ)) by using all available resources (for example, current CHUM'd chart, satellite
   imagery, airfield suitability and restrictions reports (ASRR)) to identify terrain and other
   hazards within 10NM of the arrival airfield.
16.7. Aircrew Flimsy. Aircrew flimsies are a standardized collection of essential operational
information required by aircrews to complete mission planning, conduct route study, fly the
mission, and comply with post-mission ground procedures and debriefing requirements.
16.8. Route Study. Crew route study is mandatory before accomplishing flight in the low level
environment. An intensive review of the ingress, objective area, and egress routing by the entire
crew leads to effective crew coordination and safe mission execution. Aircraft turns planned into
AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010                                                           189


higher terrain, critical obstacles that do not meet three-engine climb performance, terrain
analysis, threat locations, terrain masking, and tactics will be discussed. Special emphasis should
be placed on the run-in and objective area for the locations of visual and radar features that will
assist in proper identification. The importance of route study cannot be overemphasized.
16.9. Tactical Aircrew Coordination. Effective crew coordination is crucial to the success of
any flight, especially during tactical operations, and will be discussed prior to executing the
mission. During the route study and/or the mission briefing is a convenient time for the entire
aircrew to discuss specific responsibilities during each phase of the mission. Assigning specific
in-flight duties, such as who is going to fly the aircraft and who is going to operate airdrop
switches, and who is going to scan for threats, will help to reduce confusion during execution.
While there is no clear cut definition of crew coordination, the concept deals with the ability of
the aircrew to handle a rapidly changing environment and successfully perform the task at hand.
This requires maintaining a high level of situational awareness through the cross flow of
information between various crew positions. Information should be relevant, accurate, complete,
timely, and concise, particularly for the objective area and threat reaction maneuvers. Crew
coordination discussions should also encompass individual technique, limitations, emergency
procedures, and previous lessons learned.
16.10. Airlift Support Forces Coordination. Ensure coordination is complete with airlift and
supporting forces. Reference AFTTP 3-3.35A for applicable briefing items.
16.11. Briefings.
   16.11.1. Mission Planning Pre-Brief. The purpose of the mission planning pre-brief is to
   familiarize all crewmembers with the general aspects of the mission. The group or squadron
   commander, combat support group staff specialists, all crewmembers of each participating
   crew, and other personnel concerned with the mission should attend. The mission planning
   pre-briefing may include all information pertinent to the mission and eliminate the need for
   later specialized briefings. In cases where highly specialized information or techniques
   require additional explanation or review (such as formation procedures), schedule a
   specialized briefing. During the briefing, indicate what preparation has been accomplished
   and what is yet to be accomplished. Reference AFTTP 3-3.35A for guidance in conducting
   the briefing.
   16.11.2. Pre-Deployment Briefing. Prior to deployments, the operations officer, mission
   commander, or designated representative should assemble the crew and brief the description
   and purpose of the mission, tentative itinerary, aircraft configuration, special equipment, fuel
   load, clothing required, anticipated housing and messing facilities, sufficient money to defray
   individual‘s anticipated expenses, personal equipment/field equipment requirements, special
   clearance requirements, and flying safety.
   16.11.3. Tactical Mission Briefing. This briefing is required if applicable items are not
   briefed in the Joint Mission Briefing/Mission Briefing. A mission briefing for participating
   pilots, loadmasters, and other personnel as directed by the mission commander, is required
   prior to all low-level and formation missions. Brief applicable items in sufficient detail to
   ensure a clear understanding of mission objectives and procedures. The PIC is responsible for
   ensuring all crewmembers are briefed on applicable mission items (reference AFTTP 3-
   3.35A).
 190                                            AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010


   16.11.4. Specialist Briefing. Conduct specialist briefings to detail operating procedures or
   special interest items. The mission commander determines the requirement for this briefing.
   When appropriate, hold specialist briefings at the completion of the Tactical Mission
   Briefing for pilots, loadmasters, aeromedical personnel, jumpmasters, landing zone control
   officers, STT, and DZST personnel.
   16.11.5. Serial Lead Briefing. The serial leader will assemble the pilots participating in the
   serial to cover any changes or additions arising after the formal mission briefing. Only
   applicable items need to be briefed. Conduct this briefing as appropriate, to allow sufficient
   time to complete necessary aircraft inspections and jumpmaster, loadmaster, or parachutist
   briefings before station time.
   16.11.6. Other Briefings. In addition to the briefings above, mission participants will also
   conduct briefings as required in Section 6.12 of this AFI. These include C2 Center Briefing,
   Aircraft Commander Briefing, Specialized Briefings (Airdrop, Air Refueling, Load Briefing,
   etc.), Weather Briefing, Intelligence Briefing and Hazardous Materials Briefing.
16.12. Mission Debriefings. Hold immediately after the mission if practical. Reference AFTTP
3-3.35A for suggested items to include in the debrief.
   16.12.1. For formation flights, a post-mission debrief should be conducted by the mission
   commander or formation leader.
AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010                                                            191


                                           Chapter 17

                  MISSION EMPLOYMENT/TACTICAL PROCEDURES

17.1. General.
   17.1.1. Each unit will have a tactics ground training program tailored to the unit‘s wartime
   taskings. Tactics and intelligence staff should join forces in this area to ensure success. Using
   a building block approach, the ground tactical training program forms the base of the unit‘s
   tactics program. Each unit‘s tactics ground training program may be different because of the
   differences between unit mission taskings, however, the overall objectives should be the
   same.
   17.1.2. Crews will follow guidance in AFTTP 3-3.35A when performing tactical arrivals and
   departures, or when operating into locations with a hostile threat environment, except as
   noted in this chapter. Brief any deviations from guidance provided in AFTTP 3-3.35A.
   17.1.3. Crews should be prepared to adjust their mission plan based on en route mission
   updates. In a potential threat situation, crewmembers will understand their limitations and
   those of their equipment. Since the procedures contained in this instruction and AFTTP 3-
   3.35A are not all encompassing, air-crews are expected to use good judgment, innovation,
   and sound airmanship to successfully accomplish the mission.
17.2. Tactical Checklists. Combat Entry and Combat Exit checklists will be executed at the
appropriate times/locations for airdrop and tactical airland missions.
   17.2.1. All primary crewmembers will be on interphone from the Combat Entry checklist
   until completion of the Combat Exit checklist, unless crew duties require otherwise. If a pilot
   needs to leave the seat or go off interphone, initiate a climb to an appropriate altitude.
   17.2.2. Personnel performing duties required to be mobile in the cargo compartment during
   airdrop, low level operations, or threat environments will wear protective headgear. All other
   personnel in the cargo compartment will be seated with seat belts fastened.
17.3. Energy Management. Performance data will be carefully considered and energy
management is essential when planning low level operations. This is particularly necessary in
mountainous terrain, at heavy gross weights, at high pressure altitudes, and/or with less than full
engine power capability. Aggressive maneuvering, even at relatively high airspeeds, can place
the aircraft into an approach-to-stall condition or require a go-around. Abrupt control inputs
and/or uncoordinated flight should be avoided. These inputs are particularly hard on the
airframe; and, in some instances, may increase airframe structural loading beyond design limits,
possibly resulting in structural failure. Knowledge of factors that can lead to Pilot Induced
Oscillations (PIO) during the landing phase is critical. It does no good to avoid the threat
successfully only to exceed aircraft and/or pilot capabilities during the approach and landing
phase.
WARNING: Uncoordinated flight reduces stall margins and can cause an abrupt departure from
controlled flight. Uncoordinated flight increases airframe structural loading and should be
avoided unless an actual threat exists.
 192                                             AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010


17.4. Tactical Descents. If necessary, reverse engine idle thrust and speed brakes can be used
to obtain rapid descents from high altitudes. Initial descent rates of over 12,000 fpm may be
achieved. Use of the flight director for guidance is recommended.
   17.4.1. Follow procedures in TO 1C-17A-1.
   17.4.2. Initially, the PF smoothly lowers the nose to approximately 15 degrees nose low and
   then follows the pitch bar to maintain desired speed, and follows the roll bar for lateral
   navigation guidance.
   17.4.3. Stow thrust reversers and speed brakes prior to leveling off. Select and establish
   desired en route airspeed.
   17.4.4. Formation tactical descents are limited to 3-ship formations and a minimum of
   6,000‘ spacing between aircraft.
17.5. NVG Visual Approaches. When flying NVG visual approaches, intercept final no later
than 1.5 miles from the approach end of the runway, and intercept target approach path angle at
no lower than 500 AGL. The first pilot to acquire the landing zone will state Pilot/Copilot has the
LZ. The next pilot to acquire the zone will announce Pilot/Copilot has the LZ at (state clock
position). The clock position will be verbally acknowledged/confirmed by the other pilot.
17.6. Ground Operations. This paragraph outlines procedures to follow when conducting
specific ground operations at forward operating locations. Maneuvering in confined areas,
reverse taxi operations, performing engine running onloads and offloads, and combat offloads all
require a high degree of crew coordination. A thorough briefing and prior preparation are
essential to quick and safe operations. Appropriate ground personnel and subsequent aircrews
should be briefed on any hazards encountered during takeoff or landing (e.g., dust, winds, hostile
activity).
   17.6.1. NVG Lighting During Ground Operations. Operating landing lights with IR lens
   covers/filters for more than 5 minutes on the ground will cause damage to the lights/filters.
   17.6.2. NVG Taxi/Backing. Pilots may taxi using NVGs on airfields without lights (blacked
   out) or equipped with overt or covert lights. If taxiing or accomplishing ground ops on
   blacked out taxiways/ runways/ramps, the Aircraft Commander will ensure aircraft or
   environmental lighting provides for clear definition of taxiway/runway/ramp edge. Comply
   with all taxi restrictions in Chapter 5 and the ASRR. The LM may provide the pilot with
   directions to taxi the aircraft while using NVGs.
   17.6.3. Engine Running Onload and Offload (ERO) Procedures.
WARNING: Do not onload or offload through the crew entrance door and cargo ramp/door at
the same time unless both doors are directly supervised by a C-17A qualified crewmember.
Paratroop doors will not be used.
WARNING: If a combat offload is to be accomplished before offloading vehicles, do not remove
restraint until after the combat offload is completed.
       17.6.3.1. Vehicle parking brakes will not be released until all restraint is removed and
       cleared by the loadmaster.
       17.6.3.2. Personnel to be offloaded will be briefed to secure baggage aboard vehicles (if
       applicable).
AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010                                                           193


       17.6.3.3. Vehicles and all personnel exiting via the ramp will proceed directly aft of the
       aircraft at least 25 feet before turning and at least 200 feet before stopping.
       17.6.3.4. After the aircraft has slowed to taxi speed, the loadmaster may remove all
       tiedowns except one forward and one aft. After ensuring the ramp toes are in the
       appropriate position, open the cargo door, and lower the ramp to an approximate
       horizontal position.
          17.6.3.4.1. (Added-3WG) . During engine running on/off load (ERO) operations,
          the forward emergency escape exit should remain closed unless prolonged operation
          of engine-powered equipment is required inside the aircraft.
       17.6.3.5. The loadmaster will direct all onload and offload operations using briefed
       signals. Other qualified loadmasters (CRG, aerial port) may perform these duties;
       however, the crew‘s primary loadmaster retains overall responsibility for the operation.
       Passengers will be escorted by a crew-member, CRG, Aerial Port, or airfield control (i.e.,
       STT, DACG) personnel when enplaning or deplaning. Deplane passengers before
       removing cargo and enplane after loading cargo unless cargo size and location dictates
       otherwise.
       17.6.3.6. Load Data. If cargo/passenger onload information can be obtained prior to
       landing/ onload, complete the DD Form 365-4 for the subsequent sortie. The loadmaster
       may use the load plan total weight and load center of balance (CB) for entry on the DD
       Form 365-4 provided these procedures are followed:
       17.6.3.7. The load plan data will be checked by a qualified load plan validator (i.e.
       aircraft load-master, CRG loadmaster, aerial port specialist, or any individual who has
       completed the AMC Affiliation Program Airlift Planners Course).
NOTE: If downloading to an empty aircraft, a DD Form 365-4 is not required for the subsequent
sortie.
CAUTION: The stabilizer struts will be stowed and the ramp raised to at least the horizontal
position prior to taxi.
       17.6.3.8. Crew Entrance Door ERO Procedures. The PIC may approve the offload or
       onload of personnel and small cargo through the crew entrance door. In this instance, the
       throttles may be positioned to idle or reverse idle. Deplane the loadmaster to assure safety
       of deplaning/enplaning of personnel.
       17.6.3.9. Reduced Lighting EROs. Reduced light EROs must be accomplished with
       red/NVIS (overt) lighting in the cargo compartment sufficient to permit MHE drivers to
       see marshaller‘s signals and safely position MHE. NVGs will not be used for positioning
       MHE for on/off-loading operations. Dimming rheostat will be set to minimum amount of
       lighting to accomplish LMs duties. LMs may use NVGs to maintain situational
       awareness of the load team behind the aircraft before and after actual loading.
   17.6.4. Combat Offload Procedures. On operational missions, the controlling
   MAJCOM/A3/DO (or DIRMOBFOR for chopped assets) may authorize combat offloads
   when conditions warrant. OG/CC may approve combat offloads on training missions
   following a thorough risk assessment.
 194                                             AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010


WARNING: Many explosive items have specific "drop" criteria that, if exceeded, render the
item useless or dangerous to the user. With the exception of small arms ammunition (Hazard
Class/Division 1.4), explosives and munitions shall not be combat offloaded without approval of
MAJCOM/A3/DO.
EXCEPTION: Explosives and munitions rigged for airdrop may be combat offloaded
without MAJCOM/A3/DO approval.
CAUTION: Excessively rough, sharply undulating or battle damaged surfaces may cause
damage to the aircraft during combat offload operations. Reducing forward taxi speed on these
surfaces will reduce aircraft oscillation. The PIC will ensure the offload area will permit the
offload operation to be conducted without damage to the aircraft.
CAUTION: The PIC is ultimately responsible for ensuring the area in front and behind the
aircraft is clear during the operation. The loadmaster will ensure the area behind the aircraft is
well clear of anything which may be damaged due to engine exhaust blast.
CAUTION: To combat offload, a surface of at least 1,000 feet is required; however, 1,500 feet is
desired to provide a margin of safety.
       17.6.4.1. Ensure the crew rest window to the cargo compartment is clear of obstructions
       for combat offload operations.
       17.6.4.2. If ground personnel are present, the loadmaster will make contact with the
       individuals to ensure no one disrupts the operation. After the area is clear and secure, the
       loadmaster positions for the offload.
       17.6.4.3. All combat offloads will be accomplished from the forward loadmaster station.
NOTE: If combat offloading to an empty aircraft, a DD Form 365-4 is not required for the
subsequent sortie.
       17.6.4.4. NVG Combat Offloads. Pilots and loadmasters may accomplish Combat
       Offloads on NVGs at airfield light levels down to and including blacked out, provided
       aircraft or airfield lighting permit clear definition of taxiway/runway/ramp edges. Cargo
       compartment lighting will be set at minimum level to perform loadmaster duties safely.
17.7. Emergency Airlift of Personnel. Use these procedures for emergency airlift of personnel
from areas faced with enemy siege or hostile fire; or use these when directed by the controlling
component commander, MAJCOM/A3/DO or DIRMOBFOR. Airlift of this nature will normally
be accomplished without the use of individual seats, seat belts, or litter stanchions. Passengers
will be seated on the cargo floor/ramp. The number of personnel will vary depending on size and
the number of tiedown straps on board the aircraft. An estimate of 200 personnel on the main
floor and 25 on the ramp can be used for planning purposes. Personnel may be loaded in groups
of 12 to 16 (depending on size).
The following procedures will apply:
   17.7.1. All Rails and roller conveyors will be stowed. Four ramp toes install in the high
   position.
   17.7.2. When available, mattresses or other cushioning material may be used for seating.
AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010                                                           195


   17.7.3. Troops, passengers, and ambulatory patients will be seated facing forward on the
   cargo floor, sidewall seats, or ramp.
       17.7.3.1. Attach the hook end of tiedown straps to tiedown rings in A and G rows.
       Position personnel laterally between attached straps. After personnel are seated, route
       straps laterally across their legs and secure ratchet end of straps to the tiedown ring in D
       row. Be cautious of making strap to tight to restrict blood circulation in the legs of
       passengers.
   17.7.4. Secure baggage on the ramp when excess baggage and cargo secured on the cargo
   floor (or a pallet) may decrease the number of troops, passengers, and patients
   proportionately.
   17.7.5. The maximum altitude for emergency airlift will not exceed FL250.
   17.7.6. For airlift of patients, see Chapter 20 of this instruction.
17.8. (Added-3WG) . Aircraft Defensive Systems:
   17.8.1. (Added-3WG) . Units will not transport built-up flares (magazines containing
   flares with squib installed). Only the aircraft's defensive system dispensers can contain built-
   up flares. Transport spare flares as hazardous cargo and process for Air Shipment in
   accordance with AFMAN 24-204, Preparing Hazardous Material for Military Air Shipment.
   17.8.2. (Added-3WG) . In the event of a munitions mishap-involving aircraft defensive
   systems (ADS), immediately notify the Fire Department, explosive ordinance disposal
   (EOD), and Wing Safety.
   17.8.3. (Added-3WG) . Halon, carbon dioxide, or water-type fire extinguishers will NOT
   be used on fires involving pyrotechnics or magnesium incendiaries due to the risk of
   explosions.
   17.8.4. (Added-3WG) . Diverting with flares loaded requires close coordination with C2
   and the divert airfield authorities. When loaded with flares, divert bases should be chosen in
   the following order of precedence: US military base, North Atlantic Treaty Organization
   (NATO) military base, joint use NATO/Civilian field (park on the NATO area), Civilian
   airfield.
       17.8.4.1. (Added-3WG) . The countermeasure dispensing system (CMDS) switches
       will remain ―OFF‖ or stand by (STBY) until within the boundary of the flare training
       area. The CMDS switch will be returned to ―OFF‖ or ―STBY‖ prior to exiting the flare
       training area.
       17.8.4.2. (Added-3WG) . The safety switch pins will not be removed until the Combat
       Entry Checklist or just prior to entering the flare training area, whichever comes first.
       These pins will be re-installed as soon as practical after exiting the flare training area.
17.9. (Added-3WG) . Flight Deck Armor. During missions not requiring armor, pieces that
restrict seat movement may be removed and will be properly restrained. Install armor pieces in
original spots upon mission completion.

                                          Chapter 18

                                 AIRCRAFT FORMATION

18.1. General. Aircrews will follow formation procedures in AFTTP 3-3.35A, Chapter 5,
except as outlined below.
18.2. Weather Minimums.
   18.2.1. Takeoff. Takeoff minimums are no lower than 200 foot ceiling and one-half mile
   visibility (RVR 24). If the departure ceiling or visibility is below published approach
   minimums, the formation may takeoff if the requirements for a departure alternate (in
   accordance with Chapter 6 of these instructions) are met.
       18.2.1.1. NVG Formation Departures. Weather minimums for NVG formation
       departures for crewmembers who are non-current and/or unqualified is 1500/3. Current
       and qualified NVG air-crews may fly NVG departures with weather down to 600/2
       (OG/CC or equivalent may approve down to 300/1). Crews must give careful
       consideration to potential hazards during the critical phase of flight. Other weather
       limitations are IAW this instruction and AFI 11-202V3. NVGs have inherent limitations
       which can further be reduced by poor weather conditions. Crews will consider weather
       conditions, moon illumination and position, sky glow at dawn and dusk, cultural lighting,
       and weapon/expendable effects when planning NVG operations.
   18.2.2. Landing. Formation landing minimums are the published minimums for the airport.
18.3. Taxi Interval. Minimum taxi interval is one aircraft length. Lead may increase taxi
interval if circumstances dictate.
18.4. Inadvertent Weather Penetration. If a formation inadvertently enters clouds and/or
areas of poor visibility while operating VFR, flight lead‘s primary concern is to extricate the
formation from the weather while providing safe aircraft separation and terrain clearance.
Wingmen should immediately notify lead of deteriorating visual conditions. The following
procedures apply to formations operating VFR.
   18.4.1. Inadvertent Weather Penetration With SKE. Immediately upon penetrating the
   weather, formation lead will announce, ―XXXX Flight, execute inadvertent weather
   penetration procedures with SKE now, base altitude XXX, base heading XXX, base airspeed
   XXX. Acknowledge.‖ The formation climbs to a base altitude at or above the route/segment
   ESA. Element wingmen initiate climb, select SKE, set cross-track to 1,000 feet left or right,
   as appropriate, and continue climb to the base altitude on the base heading at base airspeed at
   1,000 FPM while maintaining SKE separation. When level at the base altitude, the leader
   commands the section to assume IFR interval. At this command, number 2 and 3 aircraft of
   each element reduce airspeed 20-knots and drift back until they establish intervals of 4,000
   and 8,000-feet, respectively, then reset the appropriate cross-track distance. If visual
   conditions can not be reestablished, lead will contact the appropriate ATC, declare an
   emergency, and request the necessary airspace clearance or individual clearances.
   18.4.2. Inadvertent Weather Penetration Without SKE. Immediately upon penetrating the
   weather, formation lead will announce, ―XXXX Flight, execute inadvertent weather
   penetration procedures without SKE now, base altitude XXX, base heading XXX, base
AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010                                                            197


   airspeed XXX. Acknowledge.‖ The formation climbs to a base altitude at or above the ESA
   for the route or segment. Climb at base speed and 1,000 feet per minute. After the element
   wingmen establish a 1,000 feet per minute climb, they will use 30 degrees of bank to turn to
   a heading 30 degrees right or left, respectively, from the base heading. Maintain this
   divergent heading for one minute (2 minutes from slowdown to escape for airdrop missions)
   before resuming base heading. The use of TCAS, Air-to-Air TACAN or weather skin paint
   will aid in maintaining separation from other formation members. The last element of the
   formation will occupy the base altitude; preceding elements will stack at 1,000-foot intervals,
   with the first element occupying the highest altitude. Do not change the base heading while
   in IMC. If visual conditions can not be reestablished, lead will contact the appropriate ATC,
   declare an emergency if needed, and request the necessary airspace clearance or individual
   clearances.
   EXCEPTION: If executing inadvertent weather penetration without SKE in a personnel
   echelon geometry, #2 will turn 20 degrees off base heading away from the lead airplane
   using 20 degrees of bank. #3 will turn 30 degrees off base heading in the same direction
   away from lead as #2 using 30 degrees of bank. Each wingman will maintain a divergent
   heading for 2 minutes then turn back to base heading.
WARNING: For formation geometries other than visual in-trail, terrain clearance requirements
and airspace restrictions may require modified procedures. Inadvertent weather penetration in
mountainous terrain using the above procedures may be hazardous. Mission planners and flight
leads should thoroughly brief the procedures that best suit the situation.
NOTE: The above procedures are for emergency use and do not constitute authority to violate
AFI 11-202V3, or Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR). Exercising these procedures under
actual weather conditions may constitute a violation subject to appropriate action by USAF and
FAA. Individual aircraft should remain VFR if there is sufficient warning to take evasive action.
Flight leads will take all practical measures to avoid entering controlled airspace without
clearance. Level off initially at VFR cruise altitude to minimize conflict with IFR traffic until an
IFR clearance is obtained.
NOTE: Lead may level the formation below the ESA for the route provided sustained VMC is
encountered and terrain clearance is assured.
   18.4.3. Lead is responsible for calling the inadvertent weather penetration and maintaining
   formation clearance/integrity at all times. Inadvertent weather penetration cannot be written
   for each individual situation. It is therefore critical for lead to keep track of his wingman at
   all times, and be directive if a standard inadvertent weather penetration doesn‘t fit the exact
   condition of the formation.
18.5. Departure Airborne Aborts.
   18.5.1. Aircraft aborting during assembly will execute the briefed emergency procedures,
   hold clear of departing traffic, maintain VMC if possible, notify lead, and contact the
   appropriate controlling agency. If possible, the aborting aircraft will remain clear until a
   landing can be made without interfering with the remainder of the departing formation.
 198                                             AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010


18.6. Formation Recoveries.
   18.6.1. Formation Landings. All aircraft land on the runway centerline with the same flap
   detent setting, and use reverse thrust and brakes as briefed. Continue to the end of the runway
   (or briefed turnoff) without stopping in any position that would prevent succeeding aircraft
   from clearing the runway.
   WARNING: Aircraft will not perform touch-and-go landings or planned go around after
   touchdown maneuvers out of formation recoveries.

   18.6.2. Visual Recoveries. The desired landing interval is 60 seconds (45 seconds
   minimum). Consider extending the interval for icy runway conditions, short/narrow runways,
   or other adverse conditions.
   18.6.3. SKE Recoveries. Desired aircraft interval upon landing is 12,000 feet, 10,000 feet
   minimum.
       18.6.3.1. Do not fly 45/180 ground tracks or course reversal maneuvers.
18.7. Rendezvous. See AFTTP 3-1.35 Attachment 7 (UNCLASSIFIED) paragraph 7.4. Serial
leads may brief alternate rejoin procedures as dictated by the individual situation. The following
procedures can be used in the event that special procedures as not pre-briefed. These procedures
are intended to join multiple sections into one formation. Each section will converge on a briefed
geographic point or radio fix that is referred to as the Start Rendezvous Point (SRP). Each
section will use a different SKE frequency, arriving at the SRP two minutes apart with a
minimum altitude separation of 1,000 feet. (The rendezvous track should be at least 50 NM long
for two sections, and adjusted by planners for more than two sections.)
   18.7.1. Aircrew Procedures. The first section decreases airspeed to 250 KCAS two minutes
   past the SRP. The last aircraft in the first section will be Master for the rendezvous. The
   rejoining section(s) flies the same track as the first section and executes a chase-type
   rendezvous. When the rejoining section is approaching position based on TCAS, A/A
   TACAN, WX radar, or other means, section lead will direct a change to the first section‘s
   SKE frequency and master slot IAW flight manual procedures. If the rejoining section is
   unable to maintain formation position visually, they must obtain altitude separation within
   the section prior to changing SKE frequency and master slot. Follower aircraft will stack up
   500' above section lead. For example, the first section is at 13,000 and the second section
   arrives at the SRP at 14,000 but is unable to establish visual formation procedures. Rejoining
   section lead will maintain 14,000 and coordinate with ATC for a block altitude. Follower
   aircraft will climb to 14,500, 15,000, 15,500… before they switch SKE frequency and master
   slot. When all SKE systems are synchronized, section lead will positively identify the last
   aircraft of the preceding section and continue to close to en route spacing. The joining section
   slows to 250 KCAS as necessary to stabilize in position. Serial lead will be positively
   identified with SKE and an FCI check will be accomplished prior to flying co-altitude in
   IMC. After established in the proper position, the second section descends to the formation
   altitude on section lead's FCI signal.
   18.7.2. Ensure aircraft do not have duplicate slot numbers. Join only one section to the
   formation at a time.
AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010                                                           199


18.8. Formation Air Refueling Procedures.
   18.8.1. Briefing. The lead pilot briefs all PICs within the receiver cell. This briefing will be
   in sufficient detail to cover all phases of cell operations. Reference AFTTP 3-3.35A, chapter
   5 for additional information.
   18.8.2. Aircraft will have operable SKE and radar systems for formation air refueling flights.
   It is the intent of this chapter that these systems be fully operational during FAR operations.
   However, when operational mission requirements dictate, this decision will be left to the
   mission commander.
   18.8.3. SKE will be left on throughout refueling.
   18.8.4. A 180 degree turn on track with multiple receivers will be accomplished with all
   receivers established in a single in-line formation with 1000 feet vertical separation between
   the receivers and the lowest tanker and at least two nautical miles in-trail of the lead tanker.
NOTE: Transitioning to an in-line formation behind T1 will be initiated with all receivers in
their respective post A/R positions.
   EXCEPTION: For 3-on-1 or 2-on-1 only, with prior permission from the tanker, a receiver
   in contact may remain in the contact position during the turn. The other receivers will
   maintain the current altitude and move from either awaiting A/R or post A/R to the in-trail
   position for the duration of the 180 degree turn. The in trail aircraft will return to either
   awaiting A/R or post A/R, whichever is appropriate, once the course reversal is complete
   (tanker is wings level, less than 30 degree intercept heading to track). Before maneuvering,
   the receiver in the contact/pre-contact position will remain in the contact/pre-contact position
   until the other receiver is reestablished in the awaiting A/R or post A/R position.
   18.8.5. Emergency Actions:
       18.8.5.1. Breakaway. Follow procedures in IAW TO 1-1C-1-35. When separation
       between receiver and tanker has been effected, the receiver pilot advises the tanker
       "WELL CLEAR" and states altitude passing. When the situation has stabilized,
       coordinate clearance back to precontact. Restrict all breakaways to 500‘ below individual
       tanker‘s altitude.
18.9. (Added-3WG) . Discrete Interplane Communications. Have Quick and/or Secure
Voice will be used for interplane communications on all formation flights, if available.
18.10. (Added-3WG) . Station Keeping Equipment (SKE):
   18.10.1. (Added-3WG) . SKE frequency. SKE frequencies will be in accordance with the
   C-17 In-flight Guide. Any changes that conflict with the 3rd Wing In-Flight Guide C-17A
   Supplement must be coordinated with Kulis ANG.
   18.10.2. (Added-3WG) . Local SKE routes and air traffic control (ATC) procedures are
   found in the 3 OG/176OG SKE Procedures Letter of Agreement and in the 3rd WG In-flight
   Guide C-17A Supplement. The Letter of Agreement can be found on the 3 OG/OGV
   website.

18.11. (Added-3WG) .      Vertical Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) (Cell) Formation
Procedures:
   18.11.1. (Added-3WG) . Formation lead will ensure all pilots in the formation are briefed
   on the planned vertical IFR procedures from AFTTP 3-3.C-17.
   18.11.2. (Added-3WG) . Lead changes are not allowed when flying cell procedures in
   instrument meteorological conditions(IMC). Cell lead changes may be accomplished in
   visual meteorological conditions (VMC).

                                         AIRDROP

19.1. General. Aircrews will follow guidance in TO 1C-17A-1-4 and AFTTP 3-3.35A for
airdrop procedures, except as noted in this chapter, and Chapter 18.
NOTE: Unless used in conjunction with drop execution, avoid use of the word GREEN after the
Slowdown Checklist and until completion of the Post Drop checklist. "GREEN LIGHT" will be
seen or heard by the loadmaster for all drops.
   19.1.1. NVG Airdrop Procedures. Qualified NVG airdrop pilots are authorized to perform
   normal night operations IAW this chapter and Chapter 16 and Chapter 18 of this
   regulation. Airdrops may be accomplished on drop zones lit IAW AFI 13-217 lighting
   patterns (covert and overt) while wearing NVGs, to include unmarked drop zones.
       19.1.1.1. Loadmasters will use NVGs during airdrops if the mission dictates.
       Loadmasters are authorized to perform equipment airdrops with minimum lighting. Use
       NVGs as necessary to assist with operations and keep cargo area lighting to a minimum.
       During static line personnel operations, use of NVGs in the cargo compartment is not
       authorized; however, use of NVGs on the flight deck is authorized.
       19.1.1.2. Cargo Compartment Lighting. After the Combat Entry Checklist, all cargo
       compartment lighting will be switched to red/NVIS lights. Blacked out (no-light)
       operations in the cargo compartment are not authorized. Loadmasters will carefully
       consider cargo compartment lighting intensity prior to opening ramp and door to
       minimize interference with formation wingmen‘s NVG vision.
   19.1.2. (Added-3WG) . Airdrop Mission Briefings:
       19.1.2.1. (Added-3WG) . Local mission briefings will begin 5 minutes after show time.
       All crewmembers are required to attend the mass briefing. When deployed, briefing
       requirements will be determined by the mission commander, lead pilot or mission
       planners.
       19.1.2.2. (Added-3WG) . Lead pilots or mission commanders will brief all airdrop
       missions.
       19.1.2.3. (Added-3WG) . Formation Debrief. The mission commander/lead pilot will
       ensure that all paperwork is completed, turned in, and the mission properly debriefed.
       All pilots will attend the formation debrief. If a malfunction or incident occurs, the
       loadmaster involved will also attend.
19.2. Airdrop Equipment.
   19.2.1. Airdrop Kits. The loadmaster will maintain an airdrop kit and will ensure enough
   equipment is included to satisfy load or mission requirements. Minimum contents of the
   airdrop kit will include cloth-backed pressure sensitive tape, 1/2-inch tubular nylon cord,
   type III nylon cord, # 5 cord, and inch cotton webbing.
 202                                              AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010


       19.2.1.1. (Added-3WG) . The squadron will maintain a supply of airdrop rigging
       materials (that is, Type III nylon, 80 LB cotton webbing, tape, and so forth) for
       loadmasters to replenish their personal airdrop kits.
   19.2.2. Safety Equipment.
       19.2.2.1. Personnel performing duties required to be mobile in the cargo compartment
       during airdrop, low level operations, or threat environments will wear protective
       headgear (except personnel performing water jumps). All other personnel in the cargo
       compartment will be seated with seat belts fastened. During paratroop missions,
       loadmasters will lower their helmet visor before opening the troop doors and keep them
       lowered until the troop doors are closed.
       19.2.2.2. All occupants of the cargo compartment will either wear a parachute or an
       attached restraint harness, or be seated with a seat belt fastened before a troop door and/or
       the cargo door and ramp is opened. When a troop door(s) or the door/ramp is open and
       the aircraft is below 800 feet AGL or above 14,000 feet MSL, loadmaster(s) will wear a
       restraint harness when performing airdrop duties. For operations over water, when
       parachute(s) are required, LPU(s) will be worn.
       EXCEPTION For static line jumps, static lines are attached to anchor cables before troop
       door(s) are opened. Jumpers exiting on subsequent passes may stand and hook up with
       door(s) opened if they are forward of FS 1027.
           19.2.2.2.1. The restraint harness will be fitted and adjusted prior to flight. The lifeline
           will be 18 feet 6 inches long. After the lifeline has been adjusted, disconnect the
           hook, roll and secure the lifeline, and stow on the restraint harness.
WARNING: Except for an actual contingency, towed trooper, or emergency that threatens the
survivability of the aircraft and crew, the restraint harness will not be disconnected or lengthened
to a point that would allow the loadmaster to fall outside the aircraft.
           19.2.2.2.2. Prior to opening troop door(s) and/or the ramp/door in-flight (or for
           airdrops that require the loadmaster to be positioned at the aft loadmaster station),
           attach the restraint harness at FS 1188 and adjust the life line as follows:
               19.2.2.2.2.1. Troop door airdrop operations: Adjust to allow mobility only to the
               troop door(s) and air deflector controls.
               19.2.2.2.2.2. Cargo Door and airdrop operation: Adjust to allow mobility to FS
               1403.
       19.2.2.3. Three additional parachutes, not including those required for aircrew, will be
       aboard the aircraft for training missions performing personnel airdrops. Two will be
       available for Army safety personnel use. User safety personnel will provide their own
       parachutes for contingency missions.
   19.2.3. (Added-3WG) . Aircrews will carry the Pole Knife assembly for all heavy
   equipment airdrop operations.
19.3. Airdrop Load Information.
   19.3.1. The loadmaster will complete the Joint Airdrop Inspection Records (applicable DD
   Form 1748) before takeoff and verify the accuracy of cargo and troop documentation (see
AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010                                                          203


   AFI 11-231, Computed Air Release Point Procedures, and AFJI 13-210, for specifics). The
   loadmaster will reject loads with inaccurate or unavailable weights, or loads hazardous to
   flight. If inflight rigging is required, the loadmaster will use the applicable DD Form 1748 as
   a checklist to ensure all items are completed.
NOTE: Equipment not rigged IAW 13C-series TOs or Joint Special Operations Command
(JSOC) 350 series manuals, requires a waiver from MAJCOM tactics.
       19.3.1.1. If airdrop loads and airland cargo are carried at the same time, refer to the
       restrictions listed in Table 19.1 These restrictions are designed to prevent airland loads
       from interfering with airdrop rigging equipment.

  19.3.3. (Added-3WG) . Chemical Lights on Airdrop Loads. Attach chemical lights to
  loads for local training airdrops planned to be executed during hours of darkness. Chemical-
  lights will be provided by aerial delivery. All chemical-light attachments will be made with
  80-lb cotton webbing and cloth back pressure sensitive tape as described below.
      19.3.3.1. (Added-3WG) . Container delivery system (CDS) Airdrop Bundles (2 lights):
      Attach two chemical-lights on the load, on opposite corners of each container.
      19.3.3.2. (Added-3WG) . Heavy Equipment Airdrop Platforms (4 lights): Place two
      chemical-lights on the load, on opposite sides of the platform. Attach one chemical-light
      approximately 24 inches from drogue parachute and one on the extraction line
      approximately 24 inches aft of the extraction force transfer coupling (EFTC). Secure
      with one turn single, 80-lb cotton webbing to one ply of the drogue/extraction line and
      tape both ends of the light around one-ply of the same line using cloth backed pressure
      sensitive tape. Tape only the ends of the light to ensure the greatest amount of
      illumination
      19.3.3.3. (Added-3WG) . Airdrop loads not equipped with the minimum amount of
      chemical lights as stated above will be rejected.

19.4. Required Figures of Merit (FOMs).
   19.4.1. In IMC, lead requires a MC FOM of 3 or better to descend from minimum IFR en
   route altitude to IMC drop altitude. IMC airdrop requires a MC FOM of 3 or better to drop
   using MC guidance. For SKE airdrops, the wingmen may descend to IMC drop altitude and
   drop off the SKE timer regardless of MC FOM. Aircrews are authorized to complete airdrops
   with a FOM greater than 3 provided they can visually ensure the load will land on the DZ.
19.5. Notice To Airmen Requirements.
   19.5.1. Airdrop Notice to Airmen (NOTAM). For the airdrop portion of all SKE missions in
   uncontrolled airspace, the mission command unit will comply with the current Federal
   Aviation Administration (FAA) Exemption 4371. A Letter of Agreement between local ATC
   and the military is required when operating under this exemption. Also, provide a NOTAM
   to the FAA Flight Service Station nearest the objective area at least 48 hours in advance of
   the intended activity, regardless of actual or forecast weather. NOTAM information will
   include:
       19.5.1.1. Name of the nearest city or town and state.
       19.5.1.2. Date and time period of intended activity.
       19.5.1.3. Number and type of aircraft.
       19.5.1.4. Altitudes.
       19.5.1.5. IFR Drop Corridor Ingress and Egress points of the route segment expressed in
       radial and DME from a VORTAC.
19.6. IMC Drop Altitude. Plan minimum IMC drop altitude at 500 feet above the highest
obstruction to flight (man-made obstacle, terrain feature, or spot elevation), or 400 feet plus one
contour interval above the highest depicted terrain contour, whichever is higher, within 3
nautical miles either side of the run-in centerline from DZ entry point to DZ exit point or as
specified in AFI 11-231, whichever is higher.
WARNING: Drop zone surveys do not assure terrain and obstruction clearance. The
responsibility is incumbent upon planners and aircrew through thorough mission planning and
chart updating.
NOTE: Altitudes on DZ run-in may be segmented to allow for lowest possible run-in/drop
altitude. Once the limiting obstruction (man-made obstacle, terrain feature, or spot elevation) is
visually identified and the aircraft is confirmed well clear, the crew may descend to the next
segment altitude, if lower.

19.7. IMC Drop Profile. See Figure 19.1

Figure 19.1. IMC Drop Profile.




   19.7.1. IFR Drop Corridor. Defined in FAR Exemption 4371, the IFR Drop Corridor is the
   corridor where aircraft may operate below IFR en route altitude. The beginning of the
   corridor, the IFR Drop Corridor Ingress Point, is a maximum of 40 miles from the IFR Drop
   Corridor Egress Point (co-located with the DZ Exit Point). Plan segmented corridor altitudes
   not lower than 500 feet above the highest obstruction to flight (man-made obstacle, terrain
   feature, or spot elevation), or 400 feet plus one contour interval above the highest depicted
   terrain contour, whichever is higher, within 3 nautical miles of centerline.
   19.7.2. DZ Entry Point. A fixed point in the IFR Drop Corridor where an aircraft or
   formation may safely begin descent from IFR en route altitude or a segmented altitude to
   IMC drop altitude. Formation descent will not begin until the last aircraft is at or past the DZ
   entry point.
   19.7.3. Earliest Descent Point (EDP). Earliest point in the IFR Drop Corridor where the
   formation lead may descend the entire formation to IMC drop altitude and be assured of
   terrain clearance for the entire formation. Computed by subtracting formation length (e.g., a
   4-ship is 2 NMs long) from the computed DZ entry point. A minimum of 6 NM stabilization
   point is recommended in IMC.
AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010                                                             207


    19.7.4. IMC Stabilization Point. The point after the DZ entry point where the lead aircraft
    will plan to be stabilized at IMC drop altitude and airspeed (normally 6NM from the PI).
    19.7.5. Latest Descent Point (LDP). Latest possible point in the IFR corridor where
    formation lead may begin descent to IMC drop altitude and be assured of terrain clearance
    for the entire formation. This is the latest point that ensures all aircraft in the formation are
    stabilized on altitude and airspeed.
    19.7.6. DZ Exit Point. A fixed point on the DZ escape flight path centerline where each
    aircraft will be at minimum IFR en route altitude. Calculate the exit point based upon three-
    engine performance at airdrop gross weight. This point will be a minimum of 4 NMs track
    distance from the trailing edge of the DZ. Also referred to as the IFR Drop Corridor Egress
    Point.
Table 19.2. IMC Drop Profile Calculation.
A DZ Exit Point. Compute this distance as 1 minute at 160 KCAS + climb at 1000 FPM            Write Here
  or as briefed (no greater than 3 engine climb performance). Climb at least 500 FPM or
  as required by terrain/obstructions. Cannot be less than 4 NM. Example: (160
  KCAS/60 min/hr)+(160 KCAS/60 min/hr x 500ft/1000 VVI) = 2.7 + (2.7 x .5) = 4.1
  NM
B DZ Length (Total DZ Length-Leading edge to PI Distance/2025 yd/NM) Example:
  (1688-550)/2025 = .6 NM
C IFR Drop Corridor Entry Point. Computed by subtracting distances A and B above
  from 40 NM. Example: (40 NM - A - B) 40 - 4.1 - .6 = 35.3 NM
D IMC Stabilization Point. Recommended at least 6 NM from the PI, the mission
  commander may extend this distance. Example: 6 NM
E Slowdown from 160 KCAS to Drop Speed. Example 160 to 145 KCAS = .7 NM (See
  attached slowdown distance table)
F Descent from IFR en route to IFR drop altitude. Example Descent from 2000‘ to
  1000‘ MSL = 2.7 NM (@ 160 GS and 1000 FPM see attached distance table)
G Formation Length (3-ship elements, no ghosts) 2-ship .7 NM 3-ship 1.3 NM 4-ship 2.0
  NM 5-ship 2.6 NM 6-ship 3.3 NM Example: 3-ship 1.3 NM

H DZ Entry Point. To extract this distance compute the slowdown point for the last
  aircraft and subtract the initial deceleration distance, or add D + E + F+G above.
  Example (D+E+F+G) 6 + .7 +2.7 +1.3= 10.7 NM Verify the result is not greater than
  the IFR Drop Corridor Entry Point.
I Minimum IFR Drop Altitude. Example: 716 +500 = 1216‘
J Planned Drop Altitude. Highest point on DZ plus AGL drop altitude. Will not be less
  than IFR Drop Altitude. Example: 289 + 800 = 1089‘ (use higher of min IFR and
  planned drop alt) = 1216‘ (Min IFR) (Not Shown)
K Initial Slowdown Distance. Distance needed to slow from en route airspeed to 160
      KCAS* (see attached table)
  Example 240 KCAS to 160 KCAS = 4.7
L Slowdown Distance. Total distance from initial slowdown to PI. Item K + Item F
      + Item E + Item D
  Example (from 240 KCAS to drop airspeed, 2000‘ to 1216‘) 4.7 + 2.7 +.7 + 6 =
  14.1 NM

NOTES:
A: 1 Min @ 160 + Climb to IFR Alt @ 1000 fpm (Table 19.2. A).
B: DZ Length = (Total DZ Length - Leading Edge to PI).
C: 40 - (A+B).
D: IMC Stabilization Point.
E: Slow from 160 to Drop Speed (Table 19.2. C).
F: Descent to Drop Altitude (Table 19.2. B).
G: Formation Length.
H: DZ Entry Point (D+E+F+G).
I: IFR Drop Altitude.
J: Planned Drop Altitude (No Lower than IFR Drop Altitude).
K: Initial Slowdown Distance (Table 19.2. A).
L: Slowdown Distance (Items K + F + E + D).
The C-17 mission computer calculates slowdown based on a deceleration of .05 G. To calculate this
distance use the following formula:
(GS1 - GS2) * (GS1 + GS2)
           6825
Where GS1 = Starting Ground Speed and GS2 = Ending Ground Speed e.g., 240 kts starting speed
with 160 kts ending speed. See Table 19.2., Table 16.5., Table 16.6. for the values already computed.
For time computations, as a rule of thumb, the C-17 slows at approximately 1 knot per second. 6,825
feet is an example shown for 3-ship SKE 800‘ AGL LVAD at North Field.

       with TO 1C-17A-1-4.
       19.8.3.3. (Added-3WG) . Secure each of the pallets for the second airdrop with four
       MB-1 chains and devices (2 for forward and 2 for aft restraint).
       19.8.3.4. (Added-3WG) . Perform an after-loading joint airdrop inspection (JAI) on all
       pallets scheduled to be airdropped on the mission.
       19.8.3.5. (Added-3WG) . Following the first airdrop, attempt to re-engage the locks
       into the remaining pallets prior to landing. If the locks will not engage, verify the pallets
       remain secured with the chains and devices.
       19.8.3.6. (Added-3WG) . Pilots and loadmasters will coordinate the repositioning of
       the pallets. After landing, with the aircraft parking brake set, reposition the pallets to
       required locations in accordance with TO 1C-17A-1-4. Pilots will ensure repositioning is
       complete and pallets are secured prior to resuming taxi operations. Although no further
       JAI is required, loadmasters will perform a review of the DD Form 1748, Joint Airdrop
       Inspection Record, on the pallets with particular attention to locks and static lines.
   19.8.4. (Added-3WG) . For all local dual row training missions, ensure at least one set of
   rails, rollers, and two pairs of locks (one pair left and right) are available for use forward of
   all dual row airdrop pallets as a forward barrier.
19.9. High Altitude Airdrop Operations.
   19.9.1. Reference TO 1C-17A-1-4 for pre-breathing requirements and restrictions. Reference
   AFTTP 3-3.35A chapter 8 for additional information.
       19.9.1.1. Maintain cabin pressure at or below 10,000 feet until the Pre-Slowdown
       Checklist (time for check may have to be adjusted) and until pre-breathing is complete.
       De-pressurization will not exceed 3,000 feet per minute. Slower rates are recommended if
       time allows. Ensure zero pressure differential before clearing doors to be opened.
       19.9.1.2. Physiological Technician (PT) Requirements. PTs will support high altitude
       airdrop missions whenever requested by the mission frag order, the aircrew, or the user.
       A minimum of 2 PTs will be on all airdrops conducted at 18,000 feet MSL or above, or if
       a waiver is granted to exceed exposure limitations of AFTTP 3-3.35A Table 8.3
   19.9.2. The mission computer determines the HARP for all high altitude drops. A two-stage
   model is used to calculate wind drift for HARP airdrops. The total wind drift is obtained by
   adding the drift encountered in the free fall/high velocity stage to that from the high
   drag/deployed stage. Drift due to wind is calculated as the product of the average wind and
   the total time of fall divided by a constant for each stage. The HARP uses ballistic wind and
AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010                                                            213


   deployed wind. Both values must be calculated and entered by the pilot. For high altitude
   drops above FL200, where wind direction can vary greatly from the surface to drop altitude,
   a vectorial average should be used in lieu of a simple arithmetic average. Small errors in
   wind calculations can produce very large errors in drop accuracy. A vectorial average will
   correctly cancel opposing wind velocities (i.e., 90 vs. 270 deg), and give greater weight to
   directions with stronger winds. A vectorial average can be performed using a scientific
   calculator (or laptop computer) via the following method:
NOTE: If using Microsoft Excel for trigonometry functions, convert all angles from degrees to
radians. Tab data is adequate for Sine/Cosine functions, but inadequate for Arctangent functions.
                                                              -1
NOTE: The symbol for arctangent on most calculators is Tan .

   19.9.3. (Added-3WG) . In order to reduce the risk of hazardous high altitude low
   opening/high altitude high opening (HALO/HAHO) airdrop operations, the following
   procedures will take place prior to the execution phase of any local area HALO airdrop:
       19.9.3.1. (Added-3WG) . Crews are required to complete a thorough mission planning
       session to include user interface. The PIC will contact 3 OSS/OSA prior to mission
       execution for airspace coordination, if necessary, and relay time over target (TOT).
   19.9.4. (Added-3WG) . The PIC will discuss No Drop criteria and high altitude release
   point (HARP) location with the jumpmaster, even if the drop is not jumpmaster directed.
   19.9.5. (Added-3WG) . Prior to the release of HALO/HAHO jumpers, aircrew will advise
   air traffic control (ATC) of intentions. Expect to give ATC a 5, 3, or 1 minute warning prior
   to release of jumpers. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES should a jumper exit the aircraft
   without clear coordination with ATC.
19.10. En Route. Pilots are ultimately responsible for en route navigation and time control.
Time control to the objective area should be accomplished primarily by varying airspeed with
secondary methods of flying alternate legs, cutting corners, or extending legs.
   19.10.1. Loadmasters will make a visual inspection of the cargo compartment prior to the
   initiation of the Pre-Slowdown Checklist to ensure that nothing has fallen between or aft of
   the airdrop load(s) as a result of takeoff or evasive maneuvering. A visual inspection of each
   extraction system, to include the security of recovery parachutes, will also be accomplished.
   19.10.2. All primary crewmembers will be in their respective crew positions and on
   interphone from the combat entry point until completion of the combat exit checklist unless
   crew duties require otherwise. Warnings and advisories are normally provided to the aircrew
   by the mission computer.
   19.10.3. Normally, depart the IP on course, using a drift-corrected heading to the CARP. If
   the threat situation dictates, terrain masking procedures may be required until stabilized on
   drop altitude.
       19.10.3.1. In IMC, do not initiate descent from the minimum IFR en route altitude to
       IMC drop altitude until all aircraft in the element are inside the DZ entry point, on course,
       with element lead‘s position positively known.
 214                                            AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010


   19.10.4. The slowdown through escape sequence is depicted in Figure 19.2 A slowdown
   maneuver executed late in the run-in sequence can reduce the time an aircraft is vulnerable at
   a slow airspeed and high altitude in a hostile environment. However, accomplish slowdowns
   early enough to ensure safe drop execution.

Figure 19.2. Slowdown Maneuver Example.




EVENT                                               ACTION
1. Start Slowdown (from 250-350 KCAS)               1. Throttles-Fwd Idle; May Extend SBKs
2. Pop-Up/Descent (as necessary)                    2. Initiate Climb

                                                    Airspeed (250-350 KCAS)
NOTE: For a descending slowdown, descend at 160 KCAS with half flaps. When reaching drop
altitude, select final flaps and slow to drop airspeed.
19.11. Navigation to the CARP. Accurately positioning the aircraft to the release point is the
most critical phase of the airdrop mission. The primary method for navigating to the CARP is
using a MC-calculated release solution updated with GPS. Alternate methods (using radar
beacons, SKE, GRADS, VIRS, pilot-directed visual releases) are available, provided ground
forces are willing to accept less airdrop accuracy.
   19.11.1. The mission computer determines the release point based on desired point of
   impact, desired airspeed/altitude, payload and parachute information, and atmospheric data
   entered for the airdrop. The computed location is then provided to the flight plan. For active
   flight plan airdrops, warning cues are normally controlled according to the Time To Go
   (TTG) indicated on the Airdrop Progress Page. Inside of one minute, the warning cues are
AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010                                                          215


   controlled according to the TTG indicated by the selected airdrop timer. The PF is
   responsible for ensuring the aircraft is positioned at the release point at green light and for
   maintaining drift-corrected track through red light. The PNF is responsible for ensuring a
   count down to green light, the green light call, and the red light call are given.
   19.11.2. Crew coordination is of the utmost importance to ensure all advisories and
   checklists are completed, proper DZ line-up is maintained, the point-of-impact (PI) is
   identified (if VMC), and time over target (TOT) is within established tolerances.
   19.11.3. (Added-3WG) . Airdrop data will be entered into the mission computer (MC) by
   one pilot and verified by another airdrop-qualified pilot on the crew.
19.12. GPS Airdrop. GPS airdrops rely on high precision coordinates to accurately position the
aircraft at the CARP and is the preferred method for C-17 airdrop. GPS airdrop accuracy is not
affected by night or IMC conditions. When visual references are available, crews will ensure the
airdrop load will impact the DZ or call a no drop. A preflight drop box will be computed and
updated on the route as needed. During the "slowdown checklist", the following items must be
confirmed if planning to drop in IMC:
   19.12.1. At least one GPS receiver will be updating with no "RAIM alert" messages present.
   19.12.2. No "degraded NAV ACC" messages will be present.
19.13. Pilot-Initiated Airdrops. Non SOLL-II crews require MAJCOM/A3/DO approval
before accomplishing actual pilot directed airdrops or GRADS.
EXCEPTION: Pilot directed airdrops may be accomplished for training on dry passes only.
19.14. (Added-3WG) . Local Drop Zone (DZ) Operations:
   19.14.1. (Added-3WG) . The local drop zones are found in the 3rd WG In-flight Guide C-
   17A Supplement. The Malamutes Complex, located in R-2203, is home to several drop zones
   of varying size. Specific local restrictions are found in the 3rd Wing In-flight Guide C-17A
   Supplement. Aircrews should consult the AMC Zone Availability Report (ZAR) for the most
   up-to-date DZ surveys before using any DZ. Direct questions on local DZ operations to 3
   OSS/OSK.
       19.14.1.1. (Added-3WG) . Static-line jumpers, including jumpmasters, will be not
       allowed in the door while the aircraft is over water.
   19.14.2. (Added-3WG) . For DZs within R-2203, aircrews must receive verbal clearance
   to drop prior to all actual airdrops. Pre-briefed markings (that is, RAM or letter designator)
   are not sufficient clearance to drop. However, do not drop if the correct markings are not
   displayed, red flare/smoke/light is displayed, or a ―No Drop‖ radio broadcast is received
   from the DZ.
19.15. (Added-3WG) . Personnel Alibi Reporting. During joint airborne operations, the
Army ground force commander (GFC) must be able to determine the number of personnel
(alibis) who did not jump from the aircraft. When required, the pilot in command (PIC), mission
commander, or designated formation member will report the total number of alibis to special
tactics squadron special tactics squadron (STS) or drop zone support team drop zone support
team (DZST) at the completion of the final pass over the DZ. If relay of this information
conflicts with formation procedures or in any way jeopardizes safety, delay the report as
 216                                           AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010


necessary. This guidance is for peacetime exercises only and not intended for contingencies or
when the OPORD, special instructions (SPINS), and so forth, directs radio silence.
19.16. (Added-3WG) . Minimum Drop Altitude. The 3 WG aircrews are limited to a
minimum drop altitude of 550 ft above ground level (AGL) for formation container delivery
system (CDS) airdrops during any training missions (JA/ATT and Local). For contingencies, the
drop altitude will be at the discretion of the Director of Mobility Forces (DIRMOBFOR). For
single-ship operations comply with AFI 11-231, Computed Air Release Point Procedures.
19.17. (Added-3WG) . Malfunctions/Incidents/Off-DZ drops.
   19.17.1. (Added-3WG) . An airdrop malfunction is defined as any complete or partial
   failure of:
       19.17.1.1. (Added-3WG) . The aircraft airdrop system.
       19.17.1.2. (Added-3WG) . Any piece of airdrop equipment.
       19.17.1.3. (Added-3WG) . Personnel or cargo rigging to function as designed before or
       after the drop regardless of the after-impact condition of the individual or equipment.
   19.17.2. (Added-3WG) . An airdrop incident is defined as:
       19.17.2.1. (Added-3WG) . Serious injury or death to a crewmember or other personnel.
       Serious injury for ground personnel is defined by the GFC.
       19.17.2.2. (Added-3WG) . Damage to aircraft equipment or aircraft structure.
       19.17.2.3. (Added-3WG) . Damage to the airdrop load or related airdrop equipment.
       19.17.2.4. (Added-3WG) . A suspected or actual off-DZ drop regardless of proper
       functioning equipment.
   19.17.3. (Added-3WG) . Malfunction/Incident/Off-Drop Zone Drop. T he following
   procedures will be followed by crews experiencing an aerial delivery malfunction/incident or
   off-drop zone drop.
       19.17.3.1. (Added-3WG) . All aerial delivery incidents must be reported in accordance
       with AFI 13-217.
       19.17.3.2. (Added-3WG) . Notify Elmendorf CP. If possible do not de-rig the aircraft
       and equipment or reprogram the airdrop data used in determining the load release point.
       After landing, Wing Tactics and maintenance representatives will inspect the aircraft
       before it is released for subsequent flights. For missions away from home station notify
       C2 having operational control of the mission to determine the recovery airfield where the
       aircraft will be inspected. Aircraft commanders will ensure the proper authorities
       forward the appropriate reports. Wing Tactics will investigate and submit all final
       malfunction and off-DZ reports.
       19.17.3.3. (Added-3WG) . Contact the STS/drop zone support operator (DZSO).
       STS/DZSO will mark and separate equipment drops for further investigation. For
       personnel drops, have the STS/DZSO gather all available information including
       statements from the jumpers and jumpmaster (if applicable). Provide this information to
       the mission commander upon landing.
AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010                                                        217


     19.17.3.4. (Added-3WG) . For malfunctions or incidents involving serious injury or
     death to personnel, off DZ drops, suspected off DZ drops or aircraft damage, do not
     attempt further drops of any kind; land as soon as possible. The aircrew will not airdrop
     again until cleared by the OG/CC.
     19.17.3.5. (Added-3WG) .        Subsequent airdrops may be continued under the
     circumstances listed below and at the aircraft commander‘s discretion. However, 3
     OSS/OSK will be notified immediately after landing or no later than the next duty day.
     Prior to initiating any subsequent airdrops, pilots will record the data from the affected
     airdrop‘s MC recall page (or airdrop waypoints and progress pages if the drop was not
     sequenced).
        19.17.3.5.1. (Added-3WG) . If a drogue malfunction occurs and the drogue is
        successfully jettisoned using the normal drogue jettison switch, the crew may
        continue to drop even if the drogue lands off-DZ.
        19.17.3.5.2. (Added-3WG) . If a CDS or heavy equipment malfunction did not
        result in injury to personnel, an off-DZ drop, or aircraft damage (including any part of
        the personnel airdrop system), the aircraft commander may elect to drop personnel
        before OSK inspects the malfunction.
        19.17.3.5.3. (Added-3WG) . CDS or heavy equipment will not be dropped
        following any CDS, heavy equipment, or personnel malfunction.
     19.17.3.6. (Added-3WG) . Attempt to determine the possible cause of the malfunction
     and complete as much of the DD Form 1748-2, Airdrop Malfunction Report (Personnel -
     Cargo) as soon as possible. Include a copy of the JAI form (if applicable) and crew
     orders with the DD Form 1748-2. Also complete the 3 WG Safety Aircraft Incident
     Worksheet and turn it into the Command Post. For any personnel injury, or damage to
     the aircraft or government property, notify 3 WG Safety and forward them the 3 WG
     Safety Aircraft Incident Worksheet.
     19.17.3.7. (Added-3WG) . Add additional restraint for landing, if necessary, but do not
     de-rig the load.
     19.17.3.8. (Added-3WG) . After full analysis of the malfunction by the primary
     loadmaster, he/she will request through CP the Wing Tactics Loadmaster or Stan/Eval
     loadmaster and the on-call JAI (for cargo loads) meet the aircraft on return to Elmendorf.
     Make this request as early as possible during both duty and non-duty hours. If the Wing
     Tactics or Stan/Eval Loadmaster is unable to meet the aircraft the primary loadmaster
     will deliver the malfunction report and any other documents to Wing Tactics office the
     next duty day.
     19.17.3.9. (Added-3WG) . The 3 OSS/OSK will convene and chair an Aerial Delivery
     Review Panel when directed by their respective OG/CC.

                              AEROMEDICAL EVACUATION

Section 20A—General Information

20.1. Mission.
   20.1.1. This chapter applies to C-17 aircrews, Aeromedical Evacuation Aircrews and all
   management levels concerned with operations of the C-17 aircraft. All operators involved in
   Aeromedical Evacuation missions on C-17 aircraft will use this AFI.
   20.1.2. C-17 aircraft may be used for AE transport of ill or injured DoD members and their
   dependents. These AE missions may be directed at any time by C2 agencies. AE personnel
   will utilize the procedures in applicable AFI/H 11-XXX and 41-XXX series, in conjunction
   with this publication, to accomplish the AE mission.

Section 20B—AE Command and Control

20.2. Operational Control and Reporting of Aeromedical Evacuation Forces.
   20.2.1. HQ AMC is lead command for Aeromedical Evacuation. HQ AMC Directorate of
   Operations (AMC/A3) is the executive agent for operational AE missions.
   20.2.2. Command and control of Aeromedical Evacuation missions is the same as other
   airlift missions.
   20.2.3. The PIC is responsible for ensuring the safety of the flight crew, and all patients and
   passengers. The Medical Crew Director (MCD) is responsible for providing medical care to
   the patients. In matters concerning flight safety, decisions of the PIC are final; in matters of
   patient care, decisions of the MCD are final.
   20.2.4. The MCD will advise the PIC on patient's condition or use of medical equipment
   which may affect aircraft operations.
   20.2.5. HQ AMC Command Surgeon (AMC/SG) is responsible for providing clinical
   standards and procedures concerning the treatment of patients in-flight.
   20.2.6. The Aeromedical Evacuation Operations Officer (AEOO), if available, is responsible
   for supervising flight line execution of AE missions. The MCD is directly responsible for the
   safety and medical well being of patients on the aircraft and coordinates enplaning and
   deplaning procedures with the AEOO and supporting agencies.
20.3. Alerting Procedures.
   20.3.1. At all locations AMC C2 agency will alert the PIC who will alert the MCD. The
   MCD will alert the medical crew. The goal is to link the primary aircraft commander, local
   AMC C2 agency and MCD before mission execution.
   20.3.2. When the AE crew is staged separate from the front-end crew, the MCD will contact
   AMC local C2 agency and establish alert, show time, etc. with the C2 agency. The MCD will
   make every effort to communicate with the front-end crew any mission irregularities prior to
AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010                                                        219


   crew rest. Utilize local AMC C2 agency to leave messages for non-emergency. Crew rest
   will be based on scheduled launch time. Do not violate crew rest.
   20.3.3. The local AMC C2 agency will provide PIC/MCD AE mission information when
   he/she checks on mission status. Local C2 agency will be the link between the AE crews and
   the PIC, thus permitting mission status updates to both parties without interruption of crew
   rest.
   20.3.4. AE mission requirements can change depending on clinical status of patient(s) and
   aircraft availability. There will be occasions when aircraft cannot depart (i.e. MX problems)
   or emergency patient movement that may separate an AE crew from the front-end crew. The
   MCD is responsible for communicating these changes with the PIC and local AMC C2
   agency to de-conflict problems.
20.4. Pilot In Command Responsibilities.
   20.4.1. Establish communication link with the MCD during pre-mission planning and
   throughout the mission.
   20.4.2. Brief AE crew on the mission, flight plan, flight profile, and current threat (as
   applicable).
   20.4.3. The PIC will fully integrate front-end and Aeromedical Evacuation Crew Members
   (AECM) into single crew through the entire mission to include en route transportation,
   dining, billeting, etc.
   20.4.4. Coordinate with MCD and C2 agencies/FM for cabin altitude/flight restrictions
   based on patient requirements.
   20.4.5. For missions with combined cargo and patients, coordinate with the MCD for
   loading, positioning, egress considerations.

   20.7.1. Engines should be shut down during enplaning and deplaning of patients.
   EXCEPTION: ERO procedures as outlined in paragraph 20.14
20.8. Refueling Operations.
   20.8.1. Refueling normally begins after deplaning patients are off the aircraft and prior to
   enplaning that station's patients. The PIC and Concurrent Servicing Supervisor (CSS) shall
   ensure aircrew members and servicing personnel accomplish Concurrent Servicing (CS) per
   AFI 32-2001, The Fire Protection Operations and Fire Prevention Program, and TO 00-25-
   172.
   20.8.2. CS may be accomplished with patients onboard provided:
   20.8.3. The CSS coordinates with all personnel involved prior to beginning concurrent
   operations.
   20.8.4. Prior to starting concurrent servicing, the total number of patients, passengers, and
   crew on board the aircraft will be given to the fire department.
   20.8.5. Loading ramps/stairs are in place for immediate use and exits (excluding the
   overhead escape hatches) are opened for egress.
   20.8.6. At least two AECMs (one must be a Flight Nurse [FN]) remain onboard to observe
   patients and assist patients in the event of an egress.
   20.8.7. If cabin lights, electrical power to operate medical equipment and aircraft interphone
   are operating prior to refueling, use may be continued during servicing operations. Only
   those systems, switches or electrical circuits needed to operate equipment to sustain life, may
   be turned on and used during refueling.
   20.8.8. Patients and passengers will not enter or exit the aircraft during servicing.
   Crewmembers may enter or exit the aircraft only when performing essential duties associated
   with the concurrent servicing operation.
AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010                                                           221


   20.8.9. Activities around the aircraft will be kept to a minimum during the refueling process.
   Onload/ offload patient and passenger baggage prior to or after refueling.
   20.8.10. Do not use the on board toilet facilities during servicing.
   20.8.11. When the aircrew is at the aircraft, the PIC is responsible for all aspects of aircraft
   operations and shall inform the CSS how aircrew members will participate in passenger
   evacuation/safety.
20.9. Aircraft Configuration.
   20.9.1. On designated ARM and operational AE missions, configure the aircraft during pre-
   flight, per TO 1C-17A-9 and AFI 11-2C-17V3, Addenda A.
   20.9.2. Roller conveyers will be stowed, unless required for comfort/baggage pallets. Rollers
   on the ramp will be stowed during patient onloading and offloading operations.
   20.9.3. Enplaning litter patients through the crew entrance door is authorized.
   20.9.4. The Patient Support Pallet (PSP) is a pallet-based system of seat and litter
   accommodation. The PSP is authorized for use on the C-17.
   20.9.5. The PSP will be transported to the aircraft by aerial port personnel, positioned and
   secured on the aircraft by the Loadmaster and configured by the AE crew.
   20.9.6. Loading the patient support pallet, medical equipment, and airline seats should be
   accomplished before the flight crew leaves the aircraft or prior to the crew entering Crew
   Rest.
   20.9.7. PSP configuration will be determined by patient requirements. Each seat has storage
   capacity for required prepositioned life support (EPOS and life vest).
   20.9.8. Extenders and spacers will be used with the PSP(s) to mitigate trip hazards created
   by uneven surfaces between the PSP(s) and/or the C-17 integral stanchions.
   20.9.9. Slight forward-aft pallet movement may occur as the pallet shifts against the pallet
   lock. To prevent this occurrence, secure the PSP with a cargo tie-down strap.
   20.9.10. Therapeutic oxygen is an integral system on the C-17 aircraft.
   20.9.11. In the event of an emergency, patients and passengers will use the Passenger
   Oxygen Kit (POK) or Emergency Passenger Oxygen System (EPOS).
   20.9.12. AECMs will have an oxygen source available. AECMs normally use an MA-1
   portable oxygen bottle, or equivalent. EPOS or EEBDs can be used as an alternate oxygen
   source if the preplanned flight level is below FL 350. NOTE: If a pressure demand regulator
   is used, the oxygen supply will be turned off when the personal oxygen equipment is
   removed.
   20.9.13. Do not secure aircraft or medical equipment adjacent to an emergency exit in a
   manner that will prevent or impede egress.
   20.9.14. Life Preservers. Use the Adult/Child life preserver for patients.
 222                                             AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010


20.10. Passengers and Cargo.
   20.10.1. The PIC, with the concurrence of the MCD, will ensure maximum aircraft
   utilization for passengers and cargo. Passenger restrictions based upon patient considerations
   will be identified when seats are released. The PIC will advise the appropriate C2 agency of
   the number seats available for passengers.
   20.10.2. Cargo and passengers may be carried with patients unless a clear detriment to the
   health and well being of the patient or passengers can be demonstrated. The decision will be
   made by the MCD, considering the need for maximum utilization of the aircraft. Conflicts
   will be referred to the respective tasking AE command element for a decision. Litters will be
   positioned forward of cargo pallets. EXCEPTION: If cargo is in place, and the PIC and
   MCD agree, patients may be transported aft of the cargo. The MCD and Loadmaster will
   ensure patient egress is not affected by mixed cargo/patient loads.
   20.10.3. Cargo will not be bumped except in unusual/abnormal cases, and only after the
   MCD has coordinated with the PIC and notified the tasking AE command element.
   20.10.4. Do not move ambulatory patients to litters in order to provide seating for additional
   patients or passengers.
   20.10.5. For patient comfort and to permit inflight rest for patients use the following for
   missions over 4 hours in duration:
       20.10.5.1. .Minimum of 2 litters must be available for ambulatory patients.
       20.10.5.2. One seat must be reserved for every 3 litter patients.
   20.10.6. An emergency litter will be set up on all AE missions.
   20.10.7. Patient Therapeutic Liquid Oxygen (PT LOX) may be transported for positioning
   and depositioning of Operational/contingency support AE Missions.
   20.10.8. A maximum of 25 PT LOX serviced units may be transported simultaneously
   without Hazmat certification. Processing through aerial port is not required. If shipping more
   than six PT LOX containers as cargo, do not cover the containers with plastic. This will
   prevent potential accumulation of high oxygen concentration levels. WARNING: Ensure the
   cargo floor is free from any oil or petroleum products.
   20.10.9. Hazardous cargo will not normally be transported aboard AE missions.
   20.10.10. AE Movement of Contaminated/Contagious Personnel. Potentially contaminated
   patients must be decontaminated before entering the AE system. However, in extreme
   circumstances, the AMC/CC is the policy waiver authority for movement of
   contaminated/contagious casualties/personnel. If a waiver is approved, AMC will provide the
   capability to move a small number of contaminated/contagious casualties (a combination of
   approximately 50, with a maximum of 20 contagious personnel). AMC will equip AE crew
   operating in designated high-threat areas with the required equipment/supplies to carry out
   this mission.
AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010                                                          223


20.11. Crash/Fire/Rescue.
   20.11.1. Aircraft carrying patient(s) will be provided CFR protection per TO 00-25-172.
   Stand-by CFR vehicle is not necessary during normal operations however, a CFR vehicle
   will be available upon request. The flight crew will coordinate CFR requirements.
   20.11.2. At non-AMC bases, non-U.S. military bases, and civilian airfields, the controlling
   agency will coordinate the CFR coverage, as necessary. The request for CFR vehicle
   coverage may be denied. This will not prevent refueling operations from occurring.
20.12. AE Call Sign/Use of Priority Clearance.
   20.12.1. AIREVAC Priority. The PIC may request AIREVAC priority for preferential ATC
   handling if a delay will affect a patient‘s well being. Aircraft commanders will request
   priority handling if AE missions are experiencing long delays during takeoff or landing
   phases, which will affect a patient‘s condition.
20.13. Not Used.

Section 20D—Contingency Operations

20.14. ERO Procedures.
   20.14.1. ERO procedures are outlined in AFI11-2AE Volume 3. ERO procedures for loading
   patients are authorized for contingency operations or when AE mission requirements dictate
   minimum ground time. ERO procedures can be practiced/trained during ARMs, joint training
   operations, exercises, etc. EROs will not be used in a noncontingency environment unless
   mission essential.
   20.14.2. The loadmaster will be positioned on the left side, at the foot of the ramp and on
   headset during actual onload procedures.
   20.14.3. When litter patients are wearing personal gear (i.e. web belts, canteen, helmets, flak
   vests, etc.) and situation requires/permits, remove personal gear from patients and secure on
   ramp or in a designated area.
20.15. Floor Loading Procedures.
   20.15.1. Floor loading of patients is authorized for all contingency operations when a time
   critical environment exists (i.e. non-secure landing zones, areas faced with enemy
   siege/hostile fire, humanitarian reasons, etc.), and minimum ground time is essential. Floor
   loading procedures can be practiced/trained during aeromedical readiness missions, joint
   training operations, exercises, etc. The cargo/ramp floor will be configured with all rollers
   stowed (cargo permitting). Reference AFI 11-2AE Volume 3 for specific floor loading
   procedures.
   20.15.2. Maximum altitude for floor loaded patients is flight level 350.

                                          Chapter 21

                       EMERGENCY NUCLEAR AIRLIFT (ENAF)

Section 21A—Mission Preparation

21.1. Emergency Nuclear Airlift. Airlift of nuclear weapons may be tasked at any time. The
amount of preparation and assistance required depends entirely on the length of time AMC has to
move the weapons.
NOTE: Use of these procedures requires SECDEF approval.

21.2. Conduct of Operations. Crews will be briefed on and receive detailed instructions from a
specific OPLAN or mission directive. If there is a conflict between this regulation and the
instructions in an OPLAN or mission directive, use the OPLAN or mission directive.
21.3. Emergency Nuclear Airlift Standards. In an emergency, the objective is to move the
weapons safely in a short time. Crews are expected to use sound judgment and common sense in
what may be a turbulent or tense environment. Comply with as many of the nuclear weapons
system safety rules in AFI 11-299, Nuclear Airlift Operations, as possible. Pay particular
attention to the following areas:
   21.3.1. Nuclear weapons will be handled safely. The most immediate hazard is the high
   explosive that can be set off by shock or heat in most nuclear weapons. Use standard aircraft
   TO 1C-17A-1-9 loading procedures. Keep the loading controlled and orderly at all times.
   Load or handle only one item or pallet at a time. Crews may ask shipper or receiver
   personnel to help, but the overall aircraft loading responsibility still belongs to the aircrew.
   Time permitting, crews should refer to TO 1C-17A-16-1 or TO 1C-17A-16-2, section I, II,
   III, or IV for specific instructions that could help crews during onload or offload. Step-by-
   step use of the TO 1C-17A-16-1 is not necessary.
   21.3.2. Load plan: See AF Form 4114, C-17A Nuclear Floor Plan Worksheet.
       21.3.2.1. If crews are required to move the maximum number of one type of weapon,
       section VI of the TO 1C-17A-16-1 is the best guide to determine where to position the
       weapons. Use the maximum tested figure.
       21.3.2.2. For mixed loads (more than one type of weapon), base the load plan on how
       many weapons can be properly restrained using TO 1C-17A-1-9 criteria. Do not allow
       weapons to touch each other when tied down.
       21.3.2.3. Crews may use the TO 1C-17A-1-9 to compute shoring requirements or section
       VI of the TO 1C-17A-16-1, which shows parking and rolling shoring requirements for
       each weapon. For winching operations, the TO 1C-17A-16-1 is a good guide for
       positioning approach shoring.
   21.3.3. Use standard TO 1C-17A-1-9 restraint criteria. Crews may use the tiedown patterns
   in the TO 1C-17A 16-1, which may exceed TO 1C-17A-1-9 criteria. The tiedown patterns
   will aid crews in floor planning a maximum tested load.
AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010                                                         225


   21.3.4. The route of flight will not violate restrictions in the classified United States Air
   Force Special Weapons Overflight Guide (SWOG). Overflying a foreign country with
   nuclear weapons is an extremely sensitive issue, even in an emergency airlift. Comply with
   the SWOG at all times. If crews don‘t have access to the SWOG, request a route of flight that
   complies with the SWOG through command and control center (C2 agency) channels. The
   C2 agency will ensure the route of flight is provided to the aircrew by the most expeditious
   means available. If no route of flight is provided, fly normal air traffic control (ATC)
   routings to the destination. Do not divulge the nature of cargo to any enroute ATC facility or
   country to obtain a specific clearance.
   21.3.5. United States military custody of nuclear weapons is required. Normally, the copilot
   is the courier and maintains custody of the nuclear cargo for the flight. Under certain
   conditions, the shipper may furnish United States military couriers who will retain custody of
   the weapons in flight.
21.4. Aircrew Selection. All C-17 active duty aircrews may be used for ENAF. Time
permitting, AMC will use a sliding scale of options, which may be one or more of the following:
   21.4.1. Assign Prime Nuclear Airlift Force (PNAF) loadmasters and/or pilots so as to have
   one or the other on each aircraft.
   21.4.2. Place PNAF pilot and loadmaster teams at the onload bases to assist with the loading
   and flight planning.
   21.4.3. Use non-PNAF crews in a prepared OPLAN scenario with planned, organized loads.
   21.4.4. Use non-PNAF crews in a short notice, bare-base environment with little or no
   advance preparation or assistance.
   21.4.5. Use ARC crews with Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) approval.
21.5. Aircrew Requirements.
   21.5.1. Crew complement will be according to the OPLAN or specific mission directive. If
   not specified, use a normal crew complement (basic crew, only one LM required).
   21.5.2. The crew will be armed IAW AFI 11-299.
   21.5.3. If crews are tasked for a mission that has a higher security classification than
   personnel security clearance, crews will be authorized emergency access to enough
   information to complete the mission. Approval authority rests with a general officer, wing
   commander, or wing commander equivalent and cannot be delegated.
21.6. Aircrew Briefings.
   21.6.1. Crews should be briefed on the following:
       21.6.1.1. Purpose of the mission.
       21.6.1.2. Classification of the mission, cargo, and locations.
       21.6.1.3. Itinerary, including confirmation of prior coordination for hazardous material
       as required by instrument flight rule (IFR) supplement and alternate airfields.
 226                                             AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010


       21.6.1.4. Cargo. TO 11N-20-11 line numbers should be included. Obtain line numbers
       from the fire department prior to loading. TO 11N-20-11 is a classified technical order
       that assigns an unclassified line number to each nuclear weapon.
       21.6.1.5. "No lone zone," two-person concept, and security requirements.
       21.6.1.6. Personnel authorized to sign for nuclear weapons at the destination.
       21.6.1.7. Current intelligence, including threat analysis.
       21.6.1.8. SWOG route of flight restrictions.
       21.6.1.9. Airborne intercept (SWOG).
       21.6.1.10. Jettisoning (SWOG).
       21.6.1.11. Command Disable System (CDS) procedures.
       21.6.1.12. Emergency procedures outlined in paragraph 21.10

Section 21B—Mission Execution

21.7. General. Use these procedures in addition to the normal operating procedures in the rest
of this regulation.
   21.7.1. Flight Plans. Enter "hazardous cargo" and the mission number in the "other
   information" section of the flight plan. If crews are carrying inert weapons, trainers, or other
   items that could be mistaken for actual weapons by crash or rescue personnel in an
   emergency, enter "inert devices and the mission number.
   21.7.2. Radio Calls:
       21.7.2.1. Departure (onload) base. Before commencing the onload, tell the tower to
       notify the fire department the onload is commencing. Prior to engine start, give the
       controlling agency (ground or tower) the parking location and approximate engine start
       time and announce there is hazardous cargo aboard the aircraft. Ensure a fire truck is
       standing by the aircraft for engine start.
       21.7.2.2. Enroute to offload base. At least 30 minutes prior to landing, contact one of the
       following (in this order): command post, base operations, or control tower. Pass mission
       number and verify that the hazardous cargo information has been received. If the arrival
       base does not have hazardous cargo information, request the following be relayed
       immediately to the crash or fire protection agency and other support agencies as
       appropriate:
          21.7.2.2.1. Aircraft call sign, type, and mission number.
          21.7.2.2.2. Estimated time of arrival (ETA).
          21.7.2.2.3. Department of Transportation (DOT) explosives hazard class or division
          (normally 1.1).
          21.7.2.2.4. Net explosive weight (NEW).
AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010                                                              227


           21.7.2.2.5. Line numbers from TO 11N-20-11 if requested. Obtain line numbers from
           the base fire department or shipper personnel prior to commencing upload at the
           onload location.
           21.7.2.2.6. A request for isolated parking and security forces to meet the aircraft.
21.8. Custody of Nuclear Cargo. Appoint a commissioned officer to be the courier officer (a
copilot or third pilot is the preferred option). The courier officer is responsible for receipt,
custody, security, safety, and delivery of nuclear weapons to authorized receivers.
   21.8.1. Before accepting and loading nuclear weapons, the shipper briefs the crew (at least
   the PIC, courier officer, and primary LM) on the nature and hazards of the cargo. If anyone
   on the crew does not receive the briefing, the PIC will ensure they are briefed the appropriate
   information before the flight. Ask the shipper to point out any specifics issues the crews may
   need to know when handling the weapons (i.e. tiedown points, forklift stirrups, command
   disable system (CDS) procedures, etc). The specific procedures in sections II, III, and IV to
   the TO 1C-17A-16 can also provide helpful information on how to load specific weapons.
   21.8.2. Time permitting, the courier and LM will inspect the cargo before accepting custody.
   The courier should have the shipper verify the integrity of a weapon case and replace any
   broken seals. Crews may be held responsible for damage at the receiving end if crews accept
   a damaged weapon without documentation. Document damage or broken seals on the DD
   Form 1911, Materiel Courier Receipt, prior to signing for the weapon.
   21.8.3. The courier accepts custody of the weapon by signing the DD Form 1911 provided
   by the shipper. Use this form to transfer cargo custody to replacement couriers.
   21.8.4. Release custody of the cargo only to a replacement courier or someone authorized to
   sign for nuclear material. Authorized receivers are identified by the shipper, by message, or
   through the AMC command and control system.
   21.8.5. Time permitting, refer any questions through the 18 AF TACC Command Center to
   TACC/ XOON for resolution.
21.9. Security Procedures. The host base is responsible for providing security for the aircraft
and the nuclear cargo. The courier officer (who has custody of the weapons) is the final authority
on security matters; however, crews should follow the advice and procedures of the host security
force as much as possible. If the situation is serious and crews will load and depart quickly, use
judgment and dispense with the formalities. Prior to takeoff, the PIC will ensure through the 18
AF TACC Command Center that security support is acknowledged for all stations being
transited that day.
   21.9.1. Home Station. Time permitting, conduct a thorough visual search of the aircraft for
   unauthorized explosives or stowaways. Use a bomb detection dog if available. If time is
   critical, do not delay the mission to "sanitize" the aircraft.
   21.9.2. Onload Base. The host base should set up a restricted area, normally with ropes and
   stanchions, around the aircraft.
       21.9.2.1. Entry Control. Use one entry point to maintain strict control of entry into the
       area. The entry controller will have a roster of all personnel allowed to enter. Use a copy
       of the flight orders for the aircrew. Instruct the entry controller to coordinate with the
 228                                            AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010


       aircrew courier before allowing anyone into the area. EXCEPTION: Allow the weapons
       convoy to enter the restricted area without delay.
       21.9.2.2. "No lone zone." Do not allow anyone to be alone in the restricted area or
       aircraft when nuclear weapons are present (either inside the area or aircraft). The purpose
       of a "no lone zone" is to prevent any one person from tampering with a nuclear weapon.
       The easiest way to enforce a "no lone zone" is to always be in pairs inside the restricted
       area (for example, two aircrew members, two shippers, or one aircrew member and one
       shipper).
   21.9.3. In-flight. Maintain the two-person concept throughout the flight. Do not allow
   anyone to be alone in the cargo compartment, crew rest area, or flight deck.
   21.9.4. Arrival at En Route Base. As soon as the engines are shut down, deploy sufficient
   armed crewmembers around the aircraft to control access to the aircraft. Until the host base
   security force is established, the only personnel authorized near the aircraft are aircrew
   members and those support personnel necessary to install landing gear pins, ground power,
   and wheel chocks. Monitor these people at all times. Keep doors closed and be prepared for
   an immediate departure until the host base establishes security.
21.10. Emergency Procedures.
   21.10.1. Security Emergencies. If confronted with a hostile force, crews may use deadly
   force to protect nuclear cargo. To the maximum extent possible crews will resist any attempt
   by a hostile force to capture a nuclear weapon. Consider any attack on an aircraft loaded with
   nuclear cargo, including a hijacking attempt, as an attack against the nuclear weapons. The
   presence of hostages shall not deter the taking of immediate, decisive, and effective action,
   including the use of deadly force, to prevent unauthorized access to, removal of, or to recover
   a nuclear weapon. If a crew comes under attack, take the following actions:
       21.10.1.1. Make an immediate takeoff, with the cargo if possible.
       21.10.1.2. If the attack occurs during onloading or offloading, load the weapons as fast
       as possible, even if improper procedures will be used. Ensure effective cargo restraint and
       take off immediately.
       21.10.1.3. Some weapons have a CDS that internally destroys the capability of a weapon
       to achieve a significant nuclear yield. The CDS will be used when capture of a weapon is
       imminent.
       21.10.1.4. Aircrews will not use emergency destruct procedures on nuclear weapons.
       Emergency destruction of weapons by shaped charges requires SECDEF approval and
       will be accomplished by qualified personnel who have the capability to receive,
       authenticate, and carry out emergency destruct orders. When two properly identified
       shipper or receiver personnel concurrently request custody of the cargo for emergency
       destruct purposes, release the cargo using appropriate custody transfer procedures.
   21.10.2. Jettisoning Nuclear Cargo. The LM will identify which cargo is and is not
   jettisonable according to the TO 1C-17A-1. In an emergency, the PIC bears a moral
   obligation to jettison cargo or crash-land where the least amount of damage will result. Use
   the CDS, if applicable, prior to jettisoning or crash-landing. Record the coordinates of each
   jettisoned item. Observe the jettison restrictions in the SWOG.
AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010                                                               229


   21.10.3. Landing in Foreign Countries. Be prudent and keep things very low key. If
   confronted with demands to board or inspect the aircraft, refer to the status of United States
   military aircraft in the DoD Foreign Clearance Guide (FCG), which states: United States
   military aircraft are sovereign instrumentalities. When cleared to overfly or land in a foreign
   territory, it is United States policy to assert that military aircraft are entitled to the privileges
   and immunities which customarily are accorded warships. These privileges and immunities
   include, in the absence of stipulations to the contrary, exemption from duties and taxation;
   immunity from search, seizure, and inspections (including customs and safety inspection); or
   other exercise or jurisdiction by the host nation over the aircraft, personnel, equipment, or
   cargo on board. Air Force aircraft commanders will not authorize search, seizure, inspection,
   or similar exercises of jurisdiction enumerated above by foreign authorities except by
   direction of HQ USAF or the American Embassy in the country concerned. Diplomatically,
   but firmly, refuse any requests to board or inspect, and get help through any available United
   States channel. Flash priority is authorized.
21.11. Maintenance on Aircraft Loaded with Nuclear Cargo.
   21.11.1. Maintenance on an aircraft loaded with nuclear weapons will not violate safety
   rules normally used with aircraft loaded with conventional explosives. Ensure all
   maintenance and servicing is completed prior to loading nuclear weapons on the aircraft. Do
   not allow the following maintenance to be performed on an aircraft loaded with nuclear
   weapons:
       21.11.1.1. Use of flame producing or uncontrolled heat-producing items that could
       increase the possibility of a fire .
       21.11.1.2. Repairs on the fuel system, cell, and tank or other maintenance where
       significant fuel spills are likely to result from disconnected lines, ruptured components,
       etc.
       21.11.1.3. Aircraft will not be jacked. The temporary lifting of one set of landing gear
       for minor maintenance (integral jacking) is not considered jacking.
       21.11.1.4. Do not concurrently refuel, defuel, or service oxygen while loading or
       offloading nuclear weapons. Ensure a fire truck standing by at the aircraft during
       refueling, defueling, or oxygen servicing of a nuclear laden aircraft.
   21.11.2. Any maintenance performed on an aircraft loaded with nuclear cargo will be
   monitored by the loadmaster, copilot or crew chief.

or equivalent status, to include diplomats, cabinet members, members of Congress, and other
individuals designated by the DoD due to their mission or position (includes BLUE BARK and
COIN ASSIST).
Diverse Departure—The airfield has been assessed for departure by TERPS personnel and no
penetration of the obstacle surfaces exist. An aircraft may depart the field, climb to 400 feet
above the departure end of the runway elevation, turn in any direction, and if a minimum climb
gradient of 200‘/NM is maintained be assured of obstacle clearance. This is normally indicated
on DoD/NOAA publications by the absence of any published departure procedures.
Double Blocking—When an aircraft is required to block-in at one parking spot, then move to
normal parking for final block-in. The extra time required for double blocking will be taken into
account during mission planning/scheduling. To compensate for double blocking on departure,
the aircrew "legal for alert time" may be adjusted to provide additional time from aircrew "show
time" to departure. When double blocking is required on arrival, the aircrews entry into crew rest
will be delayed until postflight duties are complete.
Due Regard—Operational situations that do not lend themselves to International Civil Aviation
Organization (ICAO) flight procedures, such as military contingencies, classified missions,
politically sensitive missions, or training activities. Flight under "Due Regard" obligates the
military PIC to be his or her own air traffic control (ATC) agency and to separate his or her
aircraft from all other air traffic. (See FLIP General Planning, section 7.)
DZ Entry Point—DZ Entry Point. A fixed point in the IFR Drop Corridor where an aircraft or
formation may safely begin descent from IFR en route altitude or a segmented altitude to IMC
drop altitude. The DZ entry point is a maximum of 40 NM before the DZ exit point according to
Federal Aviation Administration FAR exemption 4371C. Formation descent will not begin until
the last aircraft in formation is at or past the DZ entry point.

2 of this instruction to taxi, take-off, and land the aircraft from the left seat under the supervision
of a qualified aircraft commander.
Force Rendezvous Point (FRP)—Navigational checkpoint over which formations of aircraft
join and become part of the main force.
Geographic and Geodetic Coordinates—These numbers indicate locations on the surface of
the earth. Technically, these two types of coordinates are the same. However, for mission
planners, Geographic has come to mean map-derived coordinates while Geodetic refers to
mensurated or photo/survey-derived coordinates. Geodetic and geographic data must not be
mixed during calculations.
Global Decision Support System (GDSS)—AMC's primary execution command and control
system. GDSS is used to manage the execution of AMC airlift and tanker missions. GDSS2 will
assume AMC‘s primary C2 platform when fielded.

Operational Control (OPCON)—Transferable command authority that may be exercised by
commanders at any echelon at or below the level of combatant command. Operational control is
inherent in combatant command (command authority). Operational control may be delegated and
is the authority to perform those functions of command over subordinate forces involving
organizing and employing commands and forces, assigning tasks, designating objectives, and
giving authoritative direction necessary to accomplish the mission. Operational control includes
authoritative direction over all aspects of military operations and joint training necessary to
accomplish missions assigned to the command. Operational control should be exercised through
the commanders of subordinate organizations. Normally this authority is exercised through
subordinate joint force commanders and Service and/or functional component commanders.
Operational control normally provides full authority to organize commands and forces and to
employ those forces as the commander in operational control considers necessary to accomplish
assigned missions. Operational control does not, in and of itself, include authoritative direction
for logistics or matters of administration, discipline, internal organization, or unit training. Also
called OPCON.
Operational Missions—Missions executed at or above 18 AF TACC level. Operational
missions termed "CLOSE WATCH" include CORONET missions and AFI 11-221, Air

TACC. Other operational missions such as deployment, re-deployment, reconnaissance
operations, operational readiness inspections (ORI), AMC channel or SAAM, and JA/ATT
missions may be designated "CLOSE WATCH" as necessary.
Operational Risk Management (ORM)—ORM is a logic-based, common sense approach to
making calculated decisions on human, materiel, and environmental factors before, during, and
after Air Force operations. It enables commanders, functional managers and supervisors to
maximize operational capabilities while minimizing risks by applying a simple, systematic
process appropriate for all personnel and Air Force functions.
Opportune Airlift—Transportation of personnel, cargo, or both aboard aircraft with no
expenditure of additional flying hours to support the airlift.

Permit to Proceed—Aircraft not cleared at the first US port of entry may move to another US
airport on a permit to proceed issued by customs officials at the first port of entry. This permit
lists the requirements to be met at the next point of landing, i.e. number of crew and passengers,
cargo not yet cleared. Aircraft commanders are responsible to deliver the permit to proceed to the
 248                                            AFI11-2C-17V3_3WGSUP_I 15 APRIL 2010


customs inspector at the base where final clearance is performed. (Heavy monetary fines can be

safely return to its point of departure or alternate airport with required fuel reserve.
Portable Mission Planning System (PMPS)—Man-portable AFMSS computer system capable
of loading flight plan information into the C-17 mission computer.
Positioning and De—positioning Missions—Positioning missions are performed to relocate
aircraft for the purpose of conducting a mission. De-positioning missions are made to return
aircraft from bases at which missions have terminated.
Provisional Courier—A person assigned outside the DCS, nominated by his/her parent
command, and trained by the DCS to act as the DCS representative in a specific area.
Quick Stop—Set of procedures designed to expedite the movement of selected missions by
reducing ground times at en route or turnaround stations.
Ramp Coordinator—Designated representative of the C2 agency whose primary duty is the
coordination of ground handling activities on the ramp during large scale operations.
Scheduled Return Time (SRT)—Scheduling tool used by air mobility units to predict when
crews will return to home station. It allows force managers to plan aircrew availability and
provide crews visibility over monthly flying activities. AMC and AMC-gained aircrews (except
those on standby at home station) will have an SRT established on their flight orders.
Scheduled Takeoff Time—Takeoff time is established in the schedule or OPORD. For air
aborts and diversions, this will be engine shut down time (or arrival in the blocks if engine
shutdown is not scheduled) plus authorized ground time. Early deviation does not apply to aborts
or diversions unless the mission is formally rescheduled by current operations.

normally one-half of a division in the case of ships, and normally six aircraft in the case of
aircraft.
Serial—Normally consists of 12 aircraft (2 sections or 4 elements).
Significant Meteorological Information (SIGMET)—Area weather advisory issued by an
ICAO meteorological office relayed to and broadcast by the applicable ATC agency. SIGMET
advisories are issued for tornadoes, lines of thunderstorms, embedded thunderstorms, large hail,
