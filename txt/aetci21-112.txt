Section A—General

1. Objective. The objective of this publication is to establish aircraft maintenance training
policy and procedures for the maintenance activity. It provides guidance on conducting initial,
recurring, and advanced training to the level required so maintenance personnel can effectively
perform their jobs.
2. General. The maintenance training office (MTO) is the office of primary responsibility
(OPR) for aircraft maintenance training programs. However, the program manager (PM) or
director of maintenance (DOM) has overall responsibility for all training programs within the
organization or activity, and must ensure quality training programs are established, effective, and
completed on time according to their performance work statement (PWS), if applicable; AFI 21-
101, Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance Management; the procedures outlined in their
government-accepted training plan, if applicable; and this publication. The CSAM/CAM training
programs do not fall under the purview of AFI 36-2201, Volume 3, Air Force Training Program
On The Job Training Administration, or AFI 36-2232, Maintenance Training.
3. Compliance Terminology. For the purposes of this instruction, the following definitions
apply:
     3.1. Shall, must, or will indicate mandatory requirements. (Will is also used to express a
     declaration of purpose for a future event.)
     3.2. Should indicates a preferred method of accomplishment.
     3.3. May indicates an acceptable or suggested means of accomplishment.
4. Training Resources. The wing leadership and the PM or DOM must ensure training
resources are available and provided to support MTO course requirements and to facilitate
quality, realistic training. The MTO must identify aircraft, major support equipment, and special
test equipment needed for training.
5. Operational Risk Management (ORM). ORM is a decisionmaking process to
systematically evaluate possible courses of action, identify risks and benefits, and determine the
best course of action for any given situation. Consider ORM principles, concepts, and techniques
in the development, implementation, and application of new or existing training programs.
Additional information can be found in AFI 90-901, Operational Risk Management, and
AFPAM 90-902, Operational Risk Management (ORM) Guidelines and Tools.
6. Block Training. The objective of block training is to group as many training requirements as
possible into a single training session. Initially, the training session should provide general
information that everyone requires, and then reduce to the point where only certain categories of
personnel are required to remain in the session. Some examples of courses taught in block
training include fire extinguisher, forms documentation, corrosion control, foreign object
damage, security awareness, egress familiarization, and resource protection, etc.
AETCI21-112 1 JUNE 2010                                                                          5


7. Technical Training and AETC Training Detachment (TD) Courses. Utilize technical
training and TD courses (when available) as an alternate source of training only when the
training capability is clearly beyond that of the MTO. The MTO will develop courses (similar to
TD courses) to train and qualify their work force.
8. Operating Instruction (OI). The MTO will develop and publish an OI that describes local
policy and procedures for managing the maintenance training programs they are responsible for
administering and controlling. Provide HQ AETC/A4MMR with a copy of the published OI and
any revisions to the government-accepted training plan. For CAM units, an OI is not required if
all elements listed below are included in the government-accepted training plan. If not already
described and published in other instructions, supplements, or the government-accepted training
plan, ensure the following topics are included in the OI:
   8.1. Production frequency and distribution of automated training products.
   8.2. Procedures for updating the Maintenance Information System (MIS) training subsystem
   (IMDS/GO81/Quality Management Information System [QMIS]).
   8.3. Personnel in- and out-processing procedures.
   8.4. Procedures for requesting training (internally and externally).
   8.5. Duties and responsibilities of MTO personnel, as applicable.
   8.6. Program management processes, procedures, responsibilities, training resources,
   products, temporary duty (TDY) processing, scheduling procedures, formal training policy
   and procedures, etc., for aircraft maintenance training programs prescribed in this instruction,
   as applicable.

Section B—Responsibilities

9. PM or DOM. The PM or DOM will ensure:

   to support maintenance training programs.
   9.3. Highly qualified maintenance technicians and instructors assigned or attached to the
   MTO are appointed in writing and assign instructors based on the training needs of the
   CSAM and CAM. Personnel selected must possess superior job knowledge, experience,
   communication skills, and a desire to instruct.
   9.4. Maintenance personnel who are not 100 percent task qualified when initially hired,
   promoted, or transferred to a new position, receive required qualification training.
   9.5. Funds are provided to support maintenance training programs.
   9.6. Sufficient aircraft and support equipment are provided to the MTO to support training.

    11.14. Use the MIS training subsystem as the primary system to manage and document
    training for assigned personnel. The goal is to use the MIS to the fullest extent possible so
    training needs can be determined, validated, scheduled, and documented as required.
       11.14.1. Manage MIS training subsystem operation and utilization to include the
       management and production of products, policy, and procedures. Do not duplicate data
       loaded into MIS in other automated systems or manual forms, except to document initial
       certifications in the individual's training record for recurring tasks tracked in the MIS.
       11.14.2. (NA for Vance AFB and G081 using units) Use the IMDS master course
       table (MCT) to schedule, track, and administer maintenance training. Note: The MCT is
       used to document recurring training, special certifications, and inspector authorizations,
       AETC-directed high-interest tasks, and frequently scheduled training. Course codes not
       utilized within 6 months of establishment will be deleted from the MCT. Initial training
       will not be loaded as an MCT course code if there is a recurring training requirement
       unless specifically directed by instructions or standards. Each MIS unit identification (ID)
       is allowed 20 local course codes. These local codes are used for unit- and base-specific
       requirements or tracking needs and locally directed high-interest tasks and will be
       approved by the MTO. The most current MCT listings are available within the respective
       MIS subsystems. Additionally, specific lists and usage instructions can be found in the
       applicable MIS and MIS user manuals. MTOs submit all requested MCT additions,
       changes, or deletions to HQ AETC/A4MMR. If approved, HQ AETC/A4MMR submits
       to the MCT manager at Maxwell-Gunter AFB AL. Request template is available at the
       AETC maintenance training community of practice (CoP).

Section D—Automated Training Records

14. TBA:
   14.1. Description. TBA is an Air Force portal web-based application that fully automates
   Air Force training documentation for all logistics and communications/information
   management communities. TBA provides users with global, real-time visibility into the
   technical qualifications, certifications, and training status of personnel. TBA replaces
   traditional paper-based training records as the standard tool to track and manage job position
   duty-based training. TBA is not used to manage or document ancillary or recurring training
   currently contained in IMDS and the Advanced Distributed Learning Service.
   14.2. AETC Applicability. TBA is used by aircraft and munitions maintenance personnel
   (specific Air Force specialties or civilian equivalents—duty Air Force specialty codes
   (AFSC) 2AXXX, 2PXXX, 2RXXX. and 2WXXX). The use of TBA by AETC CSAM units
   is mandatory for aircraft maintenance employees in duty positions equivalent to the identified
   AFSCs who perform aircraft, component, or equipment maintenance tasks or who operate
   industrial machinery. CSAM supervisors and support personnel who do not perform
   maintenance tasks do not require training records. CAM units will use TBA if directed by
   their PWS and will follow the guidance in this instruction. CAM units not directed to use
   TBA by PWS may use TBA for employees in duty positions equivalent to the identified
   AFSCs if desired and approved by their PM or DOM, administrative contracting officer, and
   HQ AETC/A4MMR. If a contract maintenance unit elects to use TBA in any fashion, the PM
   or DOM will mandate use for all applicable maintenance employees in the work force and
   follow the guidance in this instruction.

  14.4. Training. TBA software is of an intuitive nature, so extensive formal user training is
  not necessary. Available training resources at the TBA CoP include a standardized lesson
  plan for use Air Force-wide, student instructional materials, system users guide, task-level
  instructional videos, and online help. Additionally, there is a user practice environment
  (UPE) that replicates the production software for hands-on training use. Access to the UPE
  will be granted to unit POCs upon request to HQ AETC/A4MMR.
  14.5. Role Assignments. Actions in TBA are accomplished through various user roles, to
  include trainee, trainer, supervisor, etc. Various .power roles are assigned to selected
  individuals in each organization to manage the system. Refer to the TBA users guide for
  additional information about roles and their capabilities. HQ AETC/A4MMR will
  periodically provide field units with a 754 ELSG-developed role report via the HQ
  AETC/A4MM CoP. MTOs will use this report to monitor and manage role assignments.
  Power role assignments must remain limited to only those personnel who require these
  special roles and must be limited. Exceptions to the following limitations will include
  rationale, must be approved in writing by the MTO, and maintained in the file. Table 1
  provides additional guidance on roles.

     14.6. Task Type Definitions:
        14.6.1. Active tasks in TBA are those tasks that are required by a supervisor of a
        subordinate employee as part of that employee’s duty position. Active tasks have been
AETCI21-112 1 JUNE 2010                                                                        15


      trained, certified, and signed off in TBA with dates and supervisor, employee, and trainee
      initials and are expected to be performed by an individual.
      14.6.2. Archived tasks in TBA are considered inactive, and individuals are not qualified
      or authorized to perform those listed tasks when in archive status. Archived tasks are
      those tasks an individual was formerly qualified to perform but is no longer signed off
      and may not perform until a qualified supervisor or trainer either trains the individual or
      ascertains that the individual is qualified to perform the task, and then the task must be
      signed off and placed into active status.
   14.7. Problem Resolution. Users follow their TBA chain of command to resolve problems
   and receive assistance. Users contact their MTO for assistance, and MTOs elevate problems
   as required. MTOs refer software-related problems to the field assistance service team, DSN
   596-5771, option 1, then 4 and 3, or by E-mail at 754.dom.team4@gunter.af.mil. MTOs
   contact the HQ AETC/A4MMR for assistance with policy and procedure matters.
   14.8. Records Impoundment Procedures. In the event of an incident or accident, the
   DOM or PM will determine if TBA training records require impoundment. When directed by
   the DOM or PM, the training manager will immediately print the training records of all
   personnel under investigation. This action will provide a "frozen in time" picture of the
   training records. If determined necessary by the DOM or PM, the MTO-assigned personnel
   manager will place a dash "-" in front of the portal IDs of the individuals who are associated
   with the accident or incident. This will prevent the individuals from logging into TBA. The
   MTO will notify the DOM and PM when the procedures above are completed and will
   reinstate TBA access for affected individuals when directed by the DOM or PM.

Section E—Formal Training

15. AETC Course Quota and AETC TDY Instructor Assistance Procedures:
   15.1. As a general rule, CAM units do not routinely receive AETC formal, TD, or TDY
   instructor assistance, unless specified in the PWS. In the event these resources are required,
   units will follow ETCA procedures and the following guidance:
      15.1.1. Fully justify requests; describe why the CSAM/CAM MTO does not have the
      capability to provide required training; describe the mission impact if training is not
      provided; include a signed statement by the PM or DOM that unit funds are available to
      defray student or instructor TDY costs and course tuition costs.
      15.1.2. Additionally, requests must include the course number, title, and primary and
      alternate dates of desired training.
   15.2. CSAMs will:
      15.2.1. Submit requests for resident course quotas to the local civilian personnel flight or
      office for processing, and provide an information copy to HQ AETC/A4MMR, 555 E
      Street East, Randolph AFB TX 78150-4440.
      15.2.2. Submit requests for AETC TDY instructor assistance to HQ AETC/A4MMR,
      and provide the local civilian personnel flight or office an information copy.
 16                                                                 AETCI21-112 1 JUNE 2010


   15.3. CAM will submit requests for resident course quotas and AETC TDY instructor
   assistance to the applicable administrative contracting officer (ACO) for approval and
   certification. Once approved, the ACO will forward the request according to the ETCA, and
   provide an information copy to HQ AETC/A4MMR, 555 E Street East, Randolph AFB TX
   78150-4440.
   15.4. HQ AETC/A4MMR coordinates with the Air Force Personnel Center or AETC, as
   required, as well as other applicable training managers and providers, validates the training
   requirement, and facilitates procurement of the requested training.

Section F—Training and Certification Programs

16. Test Facility Operator Training Program. Maintenance personnel selected for test
facility operation must receive qualification training, and be evaluated and certified according to
AFI 21-101 and AFI 11-218, Aircraft Operations and Movement on the Ground. Use locally
developed plans of instruction, procedures, and written tests to conduct test facility operator
training.
17. Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE) Operator Training Program. Operation of
powered AGE, by model and type, requires initial qualification training, and a practical
evaluation. Upon assignment to the unit, personnel who operate AGE (except AGE personnel)
must receive initial qualification training. Previous qualifications require a supervisory
evaluation during the initial evaluation process. During this evaluation, the supervisor certifies
that individuals are still qualified to operate the required equipment or that refresher training is
needed. Designated personnel conduct training.
18. Aircraft Installed Engine Run Training Program. Maintenance personnel selected for
engine start and run duties must receive qualification training, and be evaluated and certified

   requirements. The target audience includes jacking members, jacking supervisors, and
AETCI21-112 1 JUNE 2010                                                                           17


   certifiers. To ensure minimum standards are met and proficiency is maintained, all units will
   use the Air Mobility Command (AMC)-approved C-17 integral jacking training materials
   produced by the 437 MOS/MXOT at Charleston AFB SC. The number of individuals
   certified to perform integral jacking should be sufficient to meet mission and production
   requirements.
   22.2. Certifiers. Supervisors shall select highly qualified personnel as certifiers. Certifiers
   must initially view the training video and pass the written test, and then be appointed as
   certifiers in writing by the DOM.
   22.3. Requirements. Personnel must have a minimum of 6 months weapon system
   experience, complete the entire initial training program, and be certified prior to performing
   duties as an integral jacking team member. Initial training will consist of completing the
   requirements of the AMC-approved maintenance qualification training program (MQTP)
   course, which includes the care and handling of equipment, applicable technical data, and
   hands-on performance of actual jacking procedures. Successful completion of all training and
   certification requirements is mandatory prior to placement on the SCR. Annual recertification
   will be accomplished by the technician viewing the integral jacking video, successfully
   completing the written test, and certification by a certifying official.
   22.4. Grandfather Clause. Completion of the new integral jacking MQTP course is not
   required for personnel qualified prior to October 2005. However, those personnel must view
   the integral jacking video, successfully complete the written test (minimum passing score of
   80 percent, corrected to 100 percent) and be task certified by a certifier. Once all
   requirements are completed they will be added to the SCR by maintenance supervision
   following established SCR procedures.
   22.5. Tracking. Use the following G081 course codes to track integral jacking training and
   certification:
       22.5.1. Formal training, integral jacking MQTP course.
       22.5.2. Initial or annual integral jacking member certification or recertification.
       22.5.3. Initial or annual integral jacking supervisor certification or recertification.
       22.5.4. Integral jacking certifying official.
   22.6. Obtaining Materials. The MTO will obtain training materials and tests from the 437
   MOS/MXOT.
23. Air Force Engineering and Technical Services (AFETS), Contractor Engineering and
Technical Services (CETS) Program. The AFETS/CETS (also known as field service
representatives) program, if applicable, is managed by the PM or DOM according to AFI 21-110,
Engineering and Technical Services Management and Control. Utilize AFETS/CETS personnel
to the fullest extent to provide training, and fully integrate them into the instructional effort for
specialized systems and equipment training. The MTO will coordinate, schedule, and evaluate
training provided by AFETS/CETS personnel to ensure training needs are met, and quality
training is provided and documented.
24. AFTO Form 781 Series Documentation Training Program. MTO will develop and
administer an AFTO Form 781 series documentation training program for all on-equipment
maintenance personnel that includes, as a minimum, maintenance documentation procedures,

types of discrepancies constituting grounding of aircraft, procedures for clearing discrepancies,
and in-process inspection requirements and procedures. Training will emphasize the importance
of individual maintenance actions and include automated forms and their use. Document
completed training in the MIS for this one-time training requirement.
25. Audiovisual Training Program. Training program videotapes, computer-based training,
and interactive courseware can be effective in satisfying training requirements. The Defense
Visual Information Directorate distributes Department of Defense, Air Force, and major
command audiovisual training program materials through online ordering at
http://dodimagery.afis.osd.mil/.

Section G—Plan of Instruction

26. Plan of Instruction (POI) and Lesson Plan (LP) Guidance. POIs and LPs are an
approved plan of instruction that provides specific definition and direction to instructors on
learning objectives, equipment, instructional media material requirements, and how training will
be conducted. The POI and LP converts task and knowledge statements into criterion objectives
that consist of a condition, behavior, and standard statement. POIs and LPs are required for
formalized training courses administered by assigned and attached MTO instructors. The
following POI and LP elements meet the minimum acceptable requirements (see Attachment 2
for an example AETC Form 133, Plan of Instruction/Lesson Plan Part I):
      26.1. Title of the course or lesson.
   26.2. Course or lesson length.
   26.3. Methods of instruction.
   26.4. Course or lesson objectives.
   26.5. Methods of measurement.
   26.6. Student to instructor ratio.
   26.7. Instructional equipment and materials.
   26.8. Instructional reference.
   26.9. Instructional guidance.
   26.10. PM, DOM, or MTO supervisor approval of course or LP (signature and date of
   approval).
27. Lesson Plan (LP) Personalization. LPs include an introduction, body, and conclusion for
each topic, task knowledge, and subject knowledge statement (Attachments 3, 4, 5).
   27.1. Instructors maintain approved and current POIs and LPs for each course they are
   qualified and required to teach.
   27.2. LP approval is required prior to initial use and when revised. The PM, DOM, or MTO
   supervisor approves LPs and annotates the instructor’s copy of the LP.
