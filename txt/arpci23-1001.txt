3. Policy. The ARPC Logistics, Education and Training Division (MSL) operates under a centralized
supply and equipment concept which includes preparation of paperwork to buy all supplies and equip-
ment. Excluded are administrative supplies, that can be ordered by directorate supply/equipment repre-
sentatives from the DFAS-DE Supply Store using a DFAS-DE Form 28, Supply Store Purchases
(Attachment 1) or items available through GSA Customer Supply Center using GSA Form 3542, Cus-
tomer Supply Center Order (Attachment 2). Also excluded are requests for Automated Data Process-
ing Equipment (ADPE). This type of equipment must be ordered through the Communications and
Information Directorate (SC) using an AF Form 3215, C4 Systems Requirements Document. Each
directorate will designate, by letter to the Supply and Equipment Branch (MSLG), at least two people to
serve as its primary and alternate supply/equipment representatives. MSLG will serve as the primary
equipment custodian for ARPC accounts. Designated persons will be the only people authorized to
request supplies and equipment through MSLG. MSL serves as resource advisor to the ARPC Financial
Working Group (FWG) and manages funding and budgetary requirements for all supplies and equipment.
