This instruction implements procedures for follow-on actions and documentation required after
UH-1N main transmission replacement. This instruction is applicable to all personnel assigned

maintenance contract employees are responsible for ensuring personnel fully comply with the
contents of this instruction and other related documents. Ensure all records created as a result of
processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with (IAW) AFMAN 33-

1. General.
     1.1. This instruction is designed to prevent precautionary landings outside Yokota Air Base
     (AB) due to chip light illumination after UH-1 transmission replacement. Due to the
     increased possibility of a chip light illuminating during break-in of a new transmission, 374
     AW personnel and UH-1 contract maintenance employees will perform post main gearbox
     chip light prevention procedures as outlined in this instruction. No additional training is
     required.
     1.2. After transmission replacement, the aircraft will be restricted to the local Yokota pattern
     area for at least the first 20 flight hours.
     1.3. Waiver Request. The 374th Maintenance Group Commander (374 MXG/CC) is the
     waiver authority to deviate from flight hour inspection criteria. The 374th Operations Group
     Commander (374 OG/CC) is the waiver authority to deviate from the local Yokota pattern.
2. Responsibilities.
     2.1. UH-1 Maintenance Contractor. The contractor will perform the following actions
     before the first flight after changing a main transmission:
        2.1.1. Annotate the following info note in front of the AFTO Form 781A, Maintenance
        Discrepancy and Work Document: “Due to main transmission change, this aircraft is
        restricted to local Yokota pattern area flying during a 20-flight hour break-in period.
        Aircraft will not depart local Yokota pattern until AIRCRAFT has reached at least
        XXXX.X hours and the 374 MXG/CC has approved release from this restriction. The
        local Yokota pattern is defined such that if a precautionary landing is required it can be
        accomplished within the controlled movement area.”
        2.1.2. Drain, flush and inspect transmission oil and chip detector upon completion of the
        Functional Check Flight (FCF). Conditional Release: During the restriction period in
        paragraph 2.1.1., all exceptional releases will be signed off as a conditional release IAW
        T.O. 00-20-1.
        2.1.3. Inspect the chip detector and external filter after the completion of each sortie.
            2.1.3.1. If no debris is found during inspection, the aircraft may be scheduled to fly
            again.
            2.1.3.2. If debris is found within limits, clean the detector, drain and flush oil, and
            change external filter.
            2.1.3.3. If debris is found outside limits, follow appropriate TO guidance.
        2.1.4. Inspect the chip detector at 30 and 100 flight hours after the transmission change
        following the steps in paragraphs 2.1.3.1-2.1.3.3.
        2.1.5. Send any metal particles found during inspections performed above to Corpus
        Christi Army Depot (CCAD) for analysis and report findings to the 580th Aircraft
        Sustainment Group at Warner Robins Air Logistics Center (WR-ALC).
        2.1.6. Discuss aircraft limitations during daily/weekly scheduling meetings to ensure
        mission profile matches aircraft capability, and affected agencies are aware of an aircraft
        restriction before it is flown after a main transmission change.
374AWI21-108 29 MAY 2013                                                                           3


       2.1.7. Track restriction on their daily UH-1 spreadsheet.
       2.1.8. Upon release by 374 MXG/CC, remove the info note from the front page of the
       aircraft AFTO Form 781A.
   2.2. 459th Airlift Squadron (459 AS). The 459 AS will:
       2.2.1. The 459 AS will ensure all UH-1 crew members and schedulers are aware of the
       contents of this instruction and the restrictions to mission profiles for aircraft following a
       main transmission change to include the definition of “Local Pattern.”
       2.2.2. The 459 AS and scheduler will document the aircraft restriction on the scheduling
       board.
       2.2.3. The 459 AS will communicate aircraft limitations during daily scheduling
       meetings to ensure mission profiles match aircraft capability.
   2.3. MOCC. The MOCC will:
       2.3.1. Update aircraft status slides to include a “Restricted to Local Pattern” notation and
       time to next scheduled transmission inspection.
   2.4. 374 MXG/CC. The 374 MXG/CC will:
       2.4.1. Release the aircraft for normal operations if the chip light has not illuminated
       during the first 20 flying hours after transmission change.
       2.4.2. Consider extending this process in 5 flight hour increments if the chip light
       illuminates during the first 20 flying hours after the transmission change.
3. UH-1 Maintenance Contractor Exemptions. The 374 AW will not hold contractor liable to
provide aircraft as outlined in Appendix 1, and Section 2, Table 2.0. of the performance work
statement contract # FA2517-10-C-8002 during periods aircraft are restricted due to transmission
change.
