This instruction implements Air Force Instruction (AFI) 10-703, Electronic Warfare Integrated
Reprogramming. It assigns responsibilities and outlines procedures to be followed by the 374th
Airlift Wing (374 AW) during a SERENE BYTE (SB)/PACER WARE (PW) event. Because
electronic warfare integrated reprogramming requires multiple agencies to work together, each
agency must ensure that it understands its role in the reprogramming process. It applies to all
agencies in the 374 AW involved in the Electronic Warfare Integrated Reprogramming (EWIR)
process. Note: This publication is available from the 374th Operations Support Squadron
Weapons and Tactics Flight (374 OSS/OSK). The 374 AW Electronic Combat Officer (ECO) is
the primary manager of Wing Electronic Combat (EC) issues. This instruction requires

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Major changes
include: the addition of the AAQ-24 Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasures (LAIRCM) to the
Yokota defensive system inventory.
1. Overview:
     1.1. SB is an exercise to test our ability to reprogram our Electronic Warfare (EW) systems
     rapidly and efficiently. The systems primarily affected at Yokota Air Base (AB) are the
     AN/ALE-47 Countermeasures Dispensing System (CMDS), AAR- 47 Missile Warning
     System (MWS) and the AAQ-24 Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasures (LAIRCM).
     1.2. PW is not an exercise; it is real world reprogramming of the same systems.
     1.3. The procedures in this instruction will differ slightly between SB and PW; however, the
     end results are the same: reprogram the affected EW systems rapidly and efficiently.
     1.4. The most critical element of a SB/PW event is TIMELINESS. We compete against the
     clock in an effort to reprogram the systems as rapidly as possible, get the aircraft in the air,
     and give the crewmembers the best opportunity to complete their mission. There must be
     NO delay in the process.
     1.5. This instruction outlines local procedures for all affected organizations. The coordinator
     for the SB/PW is the Wing ECO or their designated representative. AFI 10-703 offers
     additional guidance on this program.

(374 AW/CP)

3. SB/PW Flow:
   3.1. For Yokota AB a SB/PW event will start upon receipt of a SB or PW message via the
   SIPRNET (PACER WARE message organizational account) or the Multi-Service Data
   Distribution System (MSDDS). The Wing ECO (or designated representative) and 374
   AW/CP will both check their respective organizational account once per duty day. The 374
   AW/CP will notify the Wing ECO if they receive a message.
   3.2. Upon receipt of a SB/PW message the Wing ECO will determine whether the SB/PW
   affects equipment at Yokota AB. Often SB/PW messages arrive for other systems (i.e.,
   ALQ-184, ALQ-131 pods) and may not apply to Yokota AB.
 4                                                             374AWI10-703 12 APRIL 2012


     3.3. If the SB/PW applies, the Wing ECO will notify EWS and begin to contact the affected
     organizations and alert them to the SB/PW message. As additional messages arrive, the
     Wing ECO will notify affected organizations.
        3.3.1. Upon notification of a SB/PW event, the Wing ECO will as a minimum ensure the
        36th Airlift Squadron Commander (36 AS/CC) or 36 AS Director of Operations (36
        AS/DO), EWS, 374th Aircraft Maintenance Squadron Commander (374 AMXS/CC), and
        the 374 AMXS Pro Super are notified of the event.
     3.4. The alerted maintenance organizations will prepare their equipment for reprogramming.
     3.5. Normally, SB/PW messages will arrive in the following order:
        3.5.1. Alert/Notification Message.
        3.5.2. System Impact Message (SIM).
        3.5.3. Reprogramming Impact Message (RIM)/TCTO (May also receive MIM at this
        time).
        3.5.4. MIM.
        3.5.5. Data.
        3.5.6. Implementation Message (IMP).
     3.6. SIPRNET emails will be the primary means for receiving PW/SB messages. The
     secondary means will be the MSDDS. If EWS has trouble retrieving files from the
     SIPRNET or MSDDS, they will notify the Wing ECO immediately.
     3.7. Once the data has reached the EWS, support equipment will be programmed IAW
     technical order (TO) procedures and/or the RIM/MIM.
     3.8. The Wing ECO will give permission to begin reprogramming after the IMP is received
     and all necessary coordination is complete. All sections responsible for reprogramming must
     inform the coordinator (via the MOC) of the start/stop times for Program Loader Verifier
     (PLV) loading and each aircraft reprogrammed. The coordinator will track this information
     on the SB tracking sheet (see Attachment 3) for use in writing an After Action Report
     (AAR). It is extremely important that this information be as accurate as possible.
     3.9. If any delays or problems arise, contact the coordinator immediately. Take action to
     solve any problems, as time delays cannot be allowed.
     3.10. The coordinator will ensure crewmembers and intelligence are aware of all SIMs,
     RIMs, and subsequent changes to aircraft and equipment.
     3.11. MOC will inform the coordinator when aircraft have been reprogrammed.
4. Reprogramming Requirements.
     4.1. SERENE BYTE (SB).
        4.1.1. SB is a code word associated with an exercise. SB is a test of our capability to
        reprogram software in aircraft EC equipment.
        4.1.2. Usually, a SB will only require the reprogramming of three (3) aircraft or
        associated EC equipment. If a SB message arrives requiring more aircraft to be
374AWI10-703 12 APRIL 2012                                                                   5


      reprogrammed, the exercise will be complete when all reprogramming requirements are
      met.
      4.1.3. After all reprogramming is complete, the coordinator will declare the SB
      terminated.
      4.1.4. Reprogram aircraft in the squadron designated by the event coordinator. Any
      flightline assistance will be coordinated through the Pro Super.
   4.2. PACER WARE (PW).
      4.2.1. PW is a code word associated with a real world reprogramming.
      4.2.2. Reprogram all the affected systems/aircraft. The Wing ECO, 374 AMXS Pro
      Super, and Crisis Action Team (CAT), if convened, will determine specific
      aircraft/system reprogramming order.
5. Organization Procedures:
   5.1. The Wing ECO will be one of the first people to know when a SB/PW event starts.
      5.1.1. When a message comes in, everyone on the SB/PW checklist (Attachment 2) will
      be contacted. Wing ECO will contact EWS first. EWS personnel can be reached through
      the MOC.
      5.1.2. When contacting the EWS on the phone read the UNCLASSIFIED subject line to
      the EWS.
          5.1.2.1. Record EWS name, location, and contact number. Annotate this on the
          SB/PW checklist. Update EWS data if it changes.
      5.1.3. On SB or PW messages highlight the unclassified subject line. Annotate any
      message that includes the ―SIM‖ in the subject line.
   5.2. 374 AW/CP will ensure receipt of PW/SB message traffic by checking SIPR account
   and MSDDS daily.
      5.2.1. When a message comes in, 374 AW/CP will contact the Wing ECO and inform
      them of message.
      5.2.2. If unable to contact the Wing ECO, contact the Alternate Wing ECO or the 36 AS
      ECO.
   5.3. Event Coordinator (usually the Wing ECO).
      5.3.1. Overview: It is important to realize that assuming the duties of coordinator means
      the Wing ECO has overall responsibility for how well this process works. If the event
      coordinator delegates control to someone, coordinator will ensure they understand the
      importance of it. Event coordinator will be vigilant and see the exercise to completion.
      5.3.2. The following information in this section is given as a basic reference for the
      coordinator. The coordinator is expected to have a basic understanding of all the
      agencies affected and what their duties are during a SB/PW event. In the EC world this
      becomes very important.          Questions are encouraged (preferably before an
      exercise/inspection) and can be directed to Wing ECO.
6                                                           374AWI10-703 12 APRIL 2012


    5.3.3. The following people are qualified to be the event coordinator (in order of
    precedence): Wing ECO, Alternate Wing ECO, 374 OSS/OSK flight commander, 36 AS
    ECO, and any attached 374 AW Weapons Officer.
    5.3.4. A SB/PW event may start with a warning message. When this is received you
    need to notify everyone on the SB/PW checklist. The SIM and RIM should be read
    carefully to make sure they apply to the systems we have.
       5.3.4.1. SIM. This informs you that a threat has changed in some way and also
       details what effect it will have on the Aircraft Defensive System (ADS).
       5.3.4.2. RIM. The RIM details how the Air Warfare Center (AWC) plans to
       compensate for the change in the threat (i.e., reprogram the ADS). The RIM also
       states the impact of implementing or not implementing the change. The SIM and
       RIM should be read carefully to make sure they apply to the ADS we have.
       5.3.4.3. MIM. This message details how maintenance personnel will accomplish
       reprogramming. This becomes the maintenance guideline. It needs to be validated
       and date stamped by EWS as TCTO material.
       5.3.4.4. Along with or immediately after the RIM, the data will be posted on the
       MSDDS. This could also be tagged onto the end of another message, so read
       everything carefully. Once the data comes, EWS will download it to a disk. These
       data disks contain the actual information that will be loaded into the ADS.
       5.3.4.5. IMP. This is the actual authorization from Headquarters Pacific Air Force
       (HQ PACAF) to reprogram the affected systems. For SB and PW once the EWS has
       both the data disk and the IMP, the event coordinator will ensure reprogramming of
       the first aircraft occurs in a timely manner. Do not reprogram anything (except
       PLVs) until EWS receives the IMP.
       5.3.4.6. As a minimum, the following list of offices need to know immediately that a
       SB/PW is in progress. All SB/PW Messages: MOC, 36 AS/CC (or DO), 374
       AMXS/CC, Pro Super, and EWS.
    5.3.5. Procedures
       5.3.5.1. Upon notification of a SB/PW message, read the message and see if it
       applies to the 374 AW. If it applies to the 374 AW, call the appropriate personnel.
       5.3.5.2. Alert/Notification Message Received: (this will say, ―Expect data within X
       hours.‖)
           5.3.5.2.1. Notify everyone on SB/PW checklist (Attachment 2).
       5.3.5.3. SIM Received:
           5.3.5.3.1. Determine if it applies to 374 AW aircraft.
           5.3.5.3.2. When notifying the 36 AS, set up a mass brief time aircrew (if PW
           message).
              5.3.5.3.2.1. If it is a PW message, make a copy for the squadron‘s ECO and
              direct the squadron ECO to brief all available crew members prior to their
              next flight.
374AWI10-703 12 APRIL 2012                                                                   7


           5.3.5.3.3. Coordinate with the Pro Super and CAT and determine which aircraft
           will be reprogrammed (all if PW), and in what order.
        5.3.5.4. RIM Received.
           5.3.5.4.1. Determine if it applies to 374 AW aircraft.
           5.3.5.4.2. Notify everyone on the checklist.
           5.3.5.4.3. Ensure EWS have PLVs ready.
        5.3.5.5. Data Message Received.
           5.3.5.5.1. Record the following information.
               5.3.5.5.1.1. The time EWS downloads data from SIPR email or MSDDS.
               5.3.5.5.1.2. The time each PLV was loaded.
        5.3.5.6. IMP Received:
           5.3.5.6.1. Notify appropriate personnel and give the approval to reprogram (all
           coordination with Pro Super/squadrons should be complete). The Wing will
           accomplish the reprogramming in a timely manner. Timing starts when you have
           both the data and the IMP message.
           5.3.5.6.2. Monitor progress.
           5.3.5.6.3. Ensure MOC and Pro Super knows to:
               5.3.5.6.3.1. Record the time IMP received.
               5.3.5.6.3.2. Record the start/stop time of first aircraft reprogrammed.
               5.3.5.6.3.3. Record the start/stop time of all other aircraft reprogrammed.
        5.3.5.7. Prepare a ULM to be sent to the appropriate off-base agencies no later than
        (NLT) 72 hours after exercise termination.
  5.4. Squadron ECOs:
     5.4.1. The Squadron ECO‘s responsibility is to ensure that the SB/PW event flow
     proceeds smoothly within the unit. Primary responsibilities will be:
        5.4.1.1. Coordinate with Wing ECO to determine procedures to receive SB/PW
        messages when deployed.
        5.4.1.2. Brief all aircrew members on the threat changes in the RIM and SIM (if
        Wing ECO is unavailable).
        5.4.1.3. Monitor all SB/PW message traffic.
        5.4.1.4. Ensure smooth communication flow within the squadron.
        5.4.1.5. Be prepared to up-channel any problems encountered with the SB/PW effort
        that cannot be resolved at the squadron level.
        5.4.1.6. Supply the event coordinator with squadron inputs to the ULM.
8                                                              374AWI10-703 12 APRIL 2012


       5.4.2. The SQ ECO‘s role in the SB/PW event is limited to squadron level except in the
       following cases where SQ ECO will fill the role as event coordinator.
          5.4.2.1. If at a deployed location.
          5.4.2.2. If you are the only event coordinator who can be located when a SB/PW
          begins.
          5.4.2.3. In these cases, you will be responsible for the flow of the exercise. For
          detailed instructions see the procedures for ―Event Coordinator.‖
    5.5. MOC.
       5.5.1. The SB/PW coordinator will call at the start of the SB/PW and tell you which
       equipment is being reprogrammed. Help the coordinator (if necessary) determine which
       personnel to recall.
       5.5.2. Wing/SQ ECO will relay upload time from the EWS personnel on the flightline to
       the event coordinator.
       5.5.3. Ensure aircraft are not reprogrammed until the IMP has been received, and the
       event coordinator has authorized reprogramming. When the coordinator gives the order
       to reprogram, ensure all appropriate maintenance organizations are informed
       immediately.
       5.5.4. Be prepared to assist the coordinator with reprogramming priorities and other
       needs. Contact coordinator for reprogramming requirements.
       5.5.5. Document any problems and solutions and forward them within 24 hours of event
       termination to the coordinator at the end of the SB/PW.
    5.6. 374 AMXS Production Supervisor:
       5.6.1. The event coordinator will contact the Pro Super when a SB/PW message and/or
       data arrives. EWS will download data from SIPR email or MSDDS.
       5.6.2. AN/ALE-47 CMDS,AAR-47 MWS, and AAQ-24 LAIRCM reprogramming: for
       SB events usually only three aircraft will be reprogrammed. Message traffic received
       may specify otherwise. For PW events, all applicable systems will be reprogrammed.
       Do not reprogram any aircraft until specifically told to do so by the event coordinator or
       the MOC. If you have any equipment problems, contact the event coordinator.
       5.6.3. Ensure EWS section is ready for reprogramming. When possible, have aircraft
       equipment (i.e., Aerospace Ground Equipment [AGE], power applied, etc.) set up prior to
       EWS arrival. The squadron Pro Super will coordinate with the Wing ECO to determine
       aircraft reprogramming sequence (i.e., which aircraft is first).
       5.6.4. Keep the coordinator and MOC informed of any problems or delays.
       5.6.5. Ensure that EWS returns all systems to their original configuration at the end of a
       SB event.
    5.7. EWS Section:
       5.7.1. When the event coordinator calls you to inform you of a SB/PW message,
       download files from SIPR email or MSDDS.
374AWI10-703 12 APRIL 2012                                                                     9


      5.7.2. Contact the Pro Super to make sure he/she is aware of a pending reprogramming
      task and to coordinate reprogramming efforts on the flightline. Ensure all AGE
      equipment and personnel are prepositioned.
      5.7.3. Once the data is downloaded, load the PLV IAW TO procedures. After the PLVs
      are loaded, ensure the event coordinator records the start and stop times of the PLV
      programming.
      5.7.4. When the IMP arrives, the coordinator will authorize reprogramming of the
      affected equipment/aircraft systems.
      5.7.5. As the aircraft are reprogrammed, give the event coordinator (via MOC) the
      aircraft tail number and the start/stop times.
      5.7.6. SB: Plan on reprogramming three ALE-47/AAR-47/AAQ-24 systems. The event
      coordinator or Pro Super will designate which tail numbers to reprogram. If a message
      arrives that specifies otherwise, follow the instructions in the message. If you have
      questions, notify the coordinator.
      5.7.7. PW: Reprogram all ALE-47/AAR-47/AAQ-24 systems in the sequence specified
      by the squadron Pro Super or coordinator.
      5.7.8. Keep the coordinator in the loop concerning any delays or problems. Document
      any problems and solutions and forward them to the coordinator within 24 hours.
      5.7.9. Upon termination of a SB, return all ALE-47/AAR-47/AAQ-24 systems to their
      original configuration. Deliver an after action report detailing any problems to the
      coordinator/Wing ECO within 24 hours of event conclusion.
6. Event Conclusion:
   6.1. The SB/PW event will be complete when all systems that need to be reprogrammed are
   finished.
   6.2. At conclusion of a SB, all systems must be returned to their original configuration.
   6.3. Any problems, hold-ups, or delays encountered will be documented by the flight
   commander/chief and forwarded to the coordinator within 24 hours of event conclusion.
   6.4. The event coordinator will prepare an ULM to be sent to the appropriate off-base
   agencies NLT 72 hours after exercise termination. The coordinator will also provide a copy
   to all on-base agencies involved in the SB/PW event.
7. Continuity:
   7.1. In order to ensure all organizations have the proper contact information, all PW/SB
   players will contact the Wing ECO when personnel/contact information changes.
      7.1.1. The Wing ECO will maintain and distribute the SB/PW alert list.
      7.1.2. When primary contacts are TDY to include deployments, each organization will
      have a secondary point of contact that is knowledgeable of the PW/SB process. Each
      organization will verify the Wing ECO has the appropriate contact information for that
      person.

  7.2. All PW/SB players will maintain a SIPR account and have readily available SIPRNET
  access. They will have email access to the 374 AW PW organizational account and
  applicable members will have a MSDDS account.
