This Publication implements guidance for the process whereby DLA requests engineering
support for National Stock Numbers (NSNs) which are item managed (IM) by DLA, and for
which the Engineering Support Activity (ESA) is OC-ALC. This publication applies to OC-
ALC, 848 SCMG and 498 NWBA organizations providing engineering support to DLA. It does
not apply to Air Reserves or Air National Guard. Its guidelines apply to Engineering, Screening
and Focal Point offices involved in processing the DLA Form 339 (hereafter referred to as "the
339 process" or "339s"). This instruction establishes organization of, procedures for, and the
responsibilities for the DLA Form 339, Request for Engineering Support, and its processing. It
provides guidance and instruction to process 339s received by OC-ALC/ENSDD Focal Point
and, subsequently, identified and distributed to various Engineering organizations. Refer
recommended changes and questions about this publication to the Office of Primary
Responsibility using AFIMT 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication. Ensure all
records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in
accordance with AFMAN 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with
the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule located at https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-

1. Procedure.
     1.1. This OI provides guidance for the process whereby DLA requests engineering support
     for National Stock Numbers (NSNs) which are item managed by DLA, and for which the
     ESA is OC-ALC. See Process Flowchart, Attachment 3. The request is made via the
     Form 339, which is automated on the DLA PDMI system, a web-based application managed
     by DLA. The URL for this is: https://pcf1.bsm.dla.mil/ESA. The DLA website interfaces
     with OC-ALCs internal workflow management system referred to as Integrated Engineering
     Support (IES). The URL for this is: https://prd-ies02.tinker.afmc.ds.af.mil.             The
     electronic form and all associated attachments are imported into the IES environment for
     processing. IES receives incoming requests in what is referred to as the "Newstate". Focal
     point personnel promotes new requests to the ―ESA-Identification‖ state. After researching
     the item and upon confirmation that OC-ALC is the ESA for the subject NSN, all relevant
     identification is attached to the 339 and promoted to the respective Engineering office.
     Engineering processes the request by providing their response via text input into appropriate
     blocks, attaching related files and upon supervisory review, the 339 follows a reverse path
     and returns to the focal point office for out-processing. The ESA response is quality
     reviewed by the Focal Point for applicable support categories provided, billable man-hours
     and completeness prior to closing request and returning to DLA. To gain access to IES,
     contact OC-ALC/ENSDD Focal Point office for required access request documents. For
     access to DLA PDMI, you must apply via the following website: https://amps.dla.mil.

            returning to DLA as a misrouted 339 request.

2. Metrics.
   2.1. The following metrics are presented, at least quarterly, to Directorate and Group level
   Management. Each metric (below) measures the Center’s overall performance and
   individually to Division and Branch level where applicable). AF GLSC equivalent is (Wing,
   Group, Squadron).
      2.1.1. Total number Received.
      2.1.2. Total number Work-in-Process (WIP). (all open requests)
      2.1.3. Total number Completed overall. (includes Return w/o Actions (RWOAs) and
      Misroutes)
      2.1.4. Total number Completed by Engineering groups only. (does not include RWOAs
      or Misroutes)
      2.1.5. Percent WIP (Open) and On-Time.
      2.1.6. Percent Completed and On-Time.
   2.2. An email is sent each month to all the ESA points of contact, and first level supervisors
   informing them of their on-time completion percentage. A listing of each case number is
   also provided for all WIP and Completed requests; those that are past due highlighted red.
   2.3. A signed Directorate/Group level memorandum is sent monthly to each Engineering
   office informing them of their individual 339 performance. Organizations not meeting the
   suspense on the 339 must provide a corrective action plan (CAP) for each WIP (Open) and
   late request. The CAP shall explain why the suspense was not met and what the action plan
   is moving forward.
   2.4. Annually, OC-ALC/EN will evaluate historical workload data and future projected
   workload to develop a recommendation for the allocation of the 339 authorizations. A
   manpower allocation recommendation will be presented to the OC-ALC/GKO and 448
   SCMW/OM commanders and their chief engineers.
3. Training.
   3.1. OC-ALC/ENSDD is the owner of the 339 process at OC-ALC and, as such, will provide
   initial training to personnel involved in the DLA 339 process. Initial training will provide a
   global understanding of the 339 process, which will include a basic understanding of the
   mission, roles and responsibilities, databases (IES and DLA PDMI) and the 339 timeline.
   Training may be provided via classroom instruction or PowerPoint presentation, information
   paper, or on-the-job training. (See Attachment 1 for References and Terms)
   3.2. IES access request documents can be obtained from the Focal Point office. The first-
   level supervisor will be responsible for ensuring that their personnel understand their roles
   and responsibilities in the 339 process.

4. Funding. OC-ALC/ENRF will control and manage funding received for all DLA 339
workload (WIP and Completed).
5. Deployment. Following approval, this OI will be presented to the engineering and associated
workforce via Staff Summary procedures to participants in the home office 3-letter staff
meetings, and to any other organization as requested.
6. Maintenance. This OI will be reviewed by the OPR biennially. The reviewer may also
undertake a random survey with known users to check on the usefulness of any part of this OI
process. A decision will be reached following each review on the need for revising this OI.
7. Records. Copies of completed 339s are electrically stored for historical purpose. Insofar as
they constitute evidence of actions, they will be entered into the appropriate group file plan.

operation, or the preservation of life or safety of operating personnel, as determined by the
military services.
Critical Safety Items (CSI)— A critical safety item is a part, an assembly, installation
equipment, launch equipment, recovery equipment or support equipment for an aircraft or
