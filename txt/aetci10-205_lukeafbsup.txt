                                  EXERCISE PROGRAM

1.1. Scope:
1.1.4. (Added) The exercise program is the primary vehicle the wing and vice commander use
to determine wing and base mission readiness and to prepare for higher headquarters evaluations
and assessments. 56 FW Inspector General Exercise and Evaluations (56 FW/IGI) will
incorporate the objectives of Luke AFB units, agencies, and participating tenant units into
exercise scenarios to meet exercise requirements. Units are encouraged to use exercises as an
opportunity to accomplish training or fulfill annual requirements as an added benefit.
AETCI10-205_LUKEAFBSUP 13 DECEMBER 2011                                                     5

                                 EVALUATION TEAM

2.2. EET Membership:
  2.2.1. (Added) Personnel appointed as EET evaluators should be highly skilled,
  experienced and motivated officers/NCOs with a broad range of expertise in their
  organization and should be the rank of Staff Sergeant, civilian equivalent, or higher. When
  nominating new evaluators, commanders should consider whether their nominee is among
  their top functional area experts. EET members must be able to serve for at least 1 year and
  be releasable to 56 FW/IGI during exercises. EET members should be familiar with their
  unit/organization’s responsibilities in supporting the response to contingency
  operations. (i.e., Initial Response Force, Follow-on Support Elements, Emergency
  Operations Center (EOC) to include Emergency Support Functions (ESFs),
  Support/Recovery teams, etc).
  2.2.2. (Added) 56 FW/IGI will maintain an EET roster and disseminate it as required.
  Group/squadron commanders and staff agency chiefs are charged with appointing members
  to the EET. All unit requests, for both assigning and removing personnel from the EET,
  must be in writing, signed by the appropriate unit commander and approved by the EET
  Chief (56 FW/IGI). As needed, commanders and staff agency chiefs will designate a new
  EET member 30 days prior to the removal of a predecessor from the team. Current EET
  membership is based on updated appointment letters. Removal of a name from an updated
  appointment letter constitutes removal from the EET. The format for assigning or removing
  members to the EET via a new appointment letter is shown in Attachment 2.
  2.2.3. (Added) Upon request, the 56 FW/IGI will provide reporting officials supplemental
  information for inclusion in EET members’ OPRs or EPRs.
  2.2.4. (Added) 56 FW minimum EET staffing requirements are as follows:

         2.2.4.1. (Added) Commanders should review and appoint additional EET members as
         necessary to ensure that all functional areas are supported. Additionally, commanders
         will ensure that alternates or additional EET members are provided to cover possible
         deployments to ensure support to the 56 FW exercise program.
     2.2.5. (Added) The EET member’s unit is responsible to schedule required training no later
     than 30 days after assignment to the EET. Training will include initial EET training and may
     include: chemical warfare training, Air Force Incident Management System (AFIMS)
     training, cargo prep/pallet build-up, hazardous cargo training and Self-Aid Buddy Care
     (SABC) training. The EET Chief will track initial EET training and the member’s unit will
     track all other training. The minimum training requirements are listed in the training
     checklist found in Attachment 3.
     2.2.6. (Added) EET members will:
         2.2.6.1. (Added) Complete all initial training as outlined in Attachment 3 within 60
         days of appointment to the EET.
         2.2.6.2. (Added) Deconflict normal duties with exercise requirements.
AETCI10-205_LUKEAFBSUP 13 DECEMBER 2011                                                    7


     2.2.6.3. (Added) Attend all required EET meetings. If an absence is unavoidable the
     member will contact with 56 FW/IGI to schedule a makeup meeting as soon as possible.
     2.2.6.4. (Added) Advise 56 FW/IGI immediately of any impending leaves, TDYs, or
     deployments, especially if it will cause their removal from EET duties and assignment of
     a replacement.

                                            Chapter 3

                                    EXERCISE PLANNING

3.1. Scope:
     3.1.4. (Added) This supplement does not preclude units from conducting in-house exercises
     involving more than one unit; however, unit exercises should be coordinated with       56
     FW/IGI prior to implementation and conducted on a non-interference basis.
3.2. Design and Development:
     3.2.5. (Added) 56 FW/IGI will identify the primary EET members for the initial exercise
     planning and exercise development. Once designated to plan the exercise, those EET
     members will ensure they are available during the 60 day planning period.
        3.2.5.1. (Added) For exercise security, initial design and planning of the exercise will
        be limited to the core group of evaluators from required units and wing staff agencies.
        The core group of evaluators consists of Command Post, OSI, Security Forces, Safety,
        Civil Engineers, Medical, and all other units required for scenario specific expertise. The
        Public Affairs (PA) EET member may attend initial exercise planning meetings to assess
        possible media and/or community impact as required.
        3.2.5.2. (Added) Attendance at scheduled EET planning meetings is mandatory. All
        EET members that will be evaluating objectives will attend each planning meeting unless
        specifically excused by the EET chief.
        3.2.5.3. (Added) EET members involved in planning will coordinate with their
        commanders to determine what functional areas will be tested during the exercise and the
        level of participation desired to meet the commander’s intent.
        3.2.5.4. (Added) EET members involved in exercise planning will be prepared to
        develop evaluation checklists, injects, objectives, procure props or simulations, or help
        prepare role players for use during the exercise and will identify and determine any
        specialized training required to evaluate those areas.
     3.2.6. (Added) 56 FW/IGI will coordinate all exercises with 56 FW/CC/CV prior to
     initiation. For exercises that effect sortie generation or programmed flying training (PFT),
     56 FW/IGI will provide key supervisors with a proposed exercise schedule to minimize
     conflicts.
     3.2.7. (Added) Special Instructions (SPINS) will provide specific guidance for each
     announced exercise if necessary for unit coordination of exercise instructions.
3.3. Security:
     3.3.1. (Added) To instill a sense of uncertainty and confusion typically found in actual
     catastrophes, the details of Major Accident Response Exercises (MAREs), Natural Disaster
     Response Exercises (NDREs), anti-terrorism, and resource protection exercises will not be
     pre-announced. Senior staff members are often the key players in disaster response exercises
     and evaluating their reactions to various inputs is a prime focus of the readiness evaluation.
AETCI10-205_LUKEAFBSUP 13 DECEMBER 2011                                                         9


   For this reason, advance notice of the specific timing and type of exercise to be initiated
   should not be divulged.
   3.3.2. (Added) The Security Forces Control Center will be pre-notified of exercises meant
   to evaluate the reaction of maintenance personnel to flight line intrusions. As an alternative
   to pre-notification, a security forces’ EET member will be standing by in the control center
   prior to and during intrusion exercises.
   3.3.3. (Added) All exercise documents will be marked “For Control Eyes Only.” EET
   members will ensure exercise documents remain in their control to prevent compromise of
   the exercise scenario.
3.4. Objectives:
   3.4.3. (Added) EET members will work closely with their unit commanders to develop
   exercise objectives that are realistic and measure a unit’s response to the given exercise
   scenario. EET members will not share the details of the exercise scenario but will use a
   general description to help commanders determine a unit’s desired exercise objectives (i.e.,
   using a term like “Terrorist Use of CBRN exercise” instead of “A terrorist will release
   Anthrax in the dining facility at 0900 after gaining access to the base by jumping the wall.”).
   3.4.4. (Added) During exercise planning EET will review previous findings and will work
   to develop scenarios and objectives to validate corrective actions.
3.5. Master Scenario Events List (MSEL):
   3.5.3. (Added) EET members will not make changes to the MSEL without EET Chief or
   White Cell (during execution) approval. Due to the planning involved to develop the
   exercise scenario additional inputs may cause confusion, omission of objectives, or
   unintended consequences as a result of undesired responses. Deviations are only authorized
   to prevent the exercise from following unnecessary courses of action or to preserve safety.
   3.5.4. (Added) In order to evaluate various facets of readiness, an event or even a major
   portion of an exercise must be “forced” in a particular direction. Though in reality the
   circumstances may not likely happen, occasionally they must be made to happen for
   evaluation necessity and cost effectiveness. An example of this would be the need to
   evaluate Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) personnel performing render safe procedures
   on a damaged bomb on an inbound aircraft. Reality would be to divert the aircraft to an
   isolated location. However; it would not be cost effective to send an EOD team and the
   evaluators to an isolated base to demonstrate the render safe procedure. Consequently, the
   scenario must be written to “force” the aircraft to land at Luke with defective ordnance in
   order that EOD personnel may be evaluated.
3.9. Approval:
   3.9.1. (Added) The EET Chief will contact the 56 FW/CC for approval before conducting
   any exercise. The EET Chief will confirm that approval is also granted for use of the AtHoc
   System, Giant Voice, or base alerting sirens. Prior approval to use the different alerting
   systems will allow more realistic response and allow evaluation of base notification and
   response times.

   3.9.2. (Added) With the exception of 56 FW Recall Exercises, Luke AFB personnel are
   exempt from the requirement to wear Air Force service dress uniform for exercises that occur
   on a Monday. Due to the nature of activities performed in support of exercise operations the
   appropriate utility uniform (ABU, Flight Suit, etc.) will be worn.
3.10. Pre-Exercise Briefing:
   3.10.1. (Added) Attendance at the pre-exercise meeting is mandatory for all EET members
   participating in or evaluating the exercise. The meeting is also to open to all current and
   qualified EET members, however the exercise scenario must be protected and will not be
   discussed outside of official meetings.

                                  EXERCISE EXECUTION

4.1. Scenario:
   4.1.1. (Added) Start of exercise (STARTEX) will be at the discretion of the EET chief as
   planned in the MSEL with 56 FW/CC authorization.
   4.1.2. (Added) End of exercise (ENDEX) will be at the discretion of the 56 FW/CC with
   the concurrence of the EET chief.
   4.1.3. (Added) EET members will be in their assigned locations prior to the scheduled
   evaluation time and will be prepared in accordance with the briefed exercise plan.
4.2. Control:
   4.2.1. (Added) Due to limited Fire and Security Forces response, a pause of exercise
   (PAUSEX) will be initiated for any real world emergencies. To initiate a PAUSEX, transmit
   “Crown Talon XXXX PAUSEX, PAUSEX, PAUSEX” over the EET radio net. During a
   PAUSEX all exercise activities will cease in their current state unless otherwise directed by
   the EET Chief.
       4.2.1.1. (Added) PAUSEX may be initiated by 56 FW/CC, 56 FW/CV, Fire, Security
       Forces, Safety, the EET Chief, or EET NCOIC.
   4.2.2. (Added) Real-world events that impact the base beyond the normal emergency
   response will result in stopping the exercise. Safety violations will also result in stopping the
   exercise. To stop the exercise completely, transmit “This is a Real-World Emergency,
   Crown Talon XXXX KNOCK IT OFF, KNOCK IT OFF, KNOCK IT OFF” over the EET
   radio net.
       4.2.2.1. (Added) KNOCK IT OFF may be initiated by anyone, particularly if it is
       caused by a safety concern.
       4.2.2.2. (Added) Following a KNOCK IT OFF the EET Chief will determine with 56
       FW/CC direction if the exercise is terminated at its current state or if it will be resumed
       once the situation is resolved.
   4.2.3. (Added) EET members will be prepared to instruct exercise participants when
   required during exercise execution to maximize learning opportunities. EET members will
   not interfere with exercise response but will be prepared to identify corrective actions on the
   spot to responding personnel.
4.3. Data Collection:
   4.3.1. (Added) An EET member will be assigned to evaluate each objective. Additionally,
   a senior EET member will be appointed as the POC for each subject area. That POC will be
   responsible for compiling the data, observations, and discrepancies for the EET members in
   their area of expertise.

                             EXERCISE DATA ASSESSMENT

5.1. Assessment Documents:
   5.1.3. (Added) AFI 90-201, Inspector General Activities, exercise grading criteria will be
   used for each objective as well as for the overall exercise. A Satisfactory grade will be
   given for any objective or the overall exercise if it is judged to have only met standards.
5.2. Debriefings:
   5.2.3. (Added) At ENDEX, all participating EET members must attend the scheduled Hot
   Wash. The Hot Wash will be closed to everyone but EET members involved in the exercise
   and appropriate trusted agents. Team members will provide a thorough, unbiased assessment
   of unit performance during the exercise.
       5.2.3.1. (Added) Deficiencies identified during the Hot Wash will be validated with unit
       commanders prior to being finalized and submitted to 56 FW/IGI.
5.3. Afteraction Report:
       5.3.1.1. (Added) EET members will submit exercise strengths, commendables,
       observations, recommended improvement areas, and deficiencies no later than 2 working
       days after ENDEX. Unit commanders and section chiefs should be notified of all
       findings and observations prior to submission to 56 FW/IGI.
5.4. Corrective Actions:
       5.4.2.1. (Added) Agencies identified as OPRs for findings in exercise reports will
       provide a written response to 56 FW/IGI as outlined in the final report instructions. The
       response will reference the report finding number, action taken, and recommendation
       whether the finding should be closed or remain open as outlined in Attachment 4 and
       Attachment 5. If the recommendation is to keep the finding open, provide an estimated
       completion date (ECD) for the finding. Replies will be approved by the 56 FW/IG.
       5.4.2.2. (Added) Units will submit a written follow-up response to 56 FW/IGI before
       the open finding ECD has expired or when the finding has been corrected and closure is
       recommended.
       5.4.2.3. (Added) Whether a corrective action taken warrants closure of a finding will be
       determined by and at the sole discretion of the 56 FW/IG.
       5.4.2.4. (Added) Initial finding responses will have a suspense of approximately 14
       days from the date of the final report. Subsequent status updates will be sent to 56
       FW/IGI every month until the finding is closed.
          5.4.2.4.1. (Added) OPRs that do not respond to 56 FW/IGI by the suspense date
          designated in the exercise report will include a late letter explaining the missed
          suspense with the overdue response.
AETCI10-205_LUKEAFBSUP 13 DECEMBER 2011                                                       13


                                          Chapter 7

                                EXERCISE SIMULATIONS

7.1. Simulations:
   7.1.2. (Added) Simulations are actions taken by the unit when directed to demonstrate a
   task or tasks that due to peacetime constraints cannot be accomplished because of prohibitive
   expense, expenditure of critical resources, significant safety concerns, real world mission
   impact, etc. Simulations will be kept to an absolute minimum. When simulations are
   unavoidable, units may propose a workaround procedure to “simulate” the non-executable
   portion of the task to be performed. Rules should allow periodic testing of all but the most
   sensitive procedures.
   7.1.3. (Added) All simulation requests will be routed through the unit commander, group
   commander, EET chief then to the 56 FW/CC as outlined in Attachment 6, no later than 30
   days prior to the exercise the simulation is requested for. Approval authority for all
   simulation requests lies with 56 FW/CV as delegated by the 56 FW/CC. Unless a simulation
   is approved, all actions are expected to be carried out as you would in a real world scenario.
   7.1.4. (Added) Do not simulate exercise activities not specifically addressed in this
   supplement unless the actual performance of the activity would result in significant
   unwarranted expenditure of time or resources, would incur government indebtedness, or
   would have a detrimental effect on the safety of daily operations.
   7.1.5. (Added) Standard Simulations. Standard simulations are pre-approved for use
   during wing exercises. During Command Directed Exercises and Higher Headquarters
   Inspections these simulations WILL NOT BE USED. These simulations have a pre-
   approved workaround and do not require justification for use. If a unit must deviate from the
   pre-approved simulation, then the simulation ceases to be considered standard and the unit
   must submit a non-standard simulation request (Attachment 6) for review/approval as
   outlined above.
      7.1.5.1. (Added) Simulation: Simulate wrap and purge of engines and marshaling of
      engine trailers with engines installed. Workaround: If spare engines are available, one
      engine would be purged, wrapped, and installed on a trailer, then marshaled together as
      one increment. If other spare engines are available, the purge/wrap will be simulated and
      engines marshaled to fill the remaining increments. If spare engines are not available,
      simulation will be accomplished by marshaling engine trailers without the engines
      installed. The 56th Maintenance Group will identify engine donors by aircraft tail
      number, in case of real world contingencies.
      7.1.5.2. (Added) Simulation: Simulate cancellation of tour groups on base.
      Workaround: 56 FW/PA will demonstrate the capability of cancelling a tour to EET
      without actually cancelling any scheduled tours.
      7.1.5.3. (Added) Simulation: Simulate issuing BW/CW antidotes to members
      processing during deployment exercises. Workaround: The medical logistics staff will
      provide simulated BW/CW antidotes to those individuals that require them based on the
      exercise scenario. Real antidotes WILL NOT BE ISSUED.
14                                   AETCI10-205_LUKEAFBSUP 13 DECEMBER 2011


     7.1.5.4. (Added) Simulation: Simulate issuing antimalarial and maintenance
     medications to members processing during deployment exercises. Workaround: The
     pharmacy will demonstrate the capability to provide sufficient quantities of medication to
     supply antimalarial and maintenance medications to all deploying troops using either on-
     hand supply or rapidly obtained medications.
     7.1.5.5. (Added) Simulation: Simulate       administering     meningococcal     vaccine,
     smallpox vaccine, typhoid vaccine, yellow fever vaccine, or anthrax vaccine and simulate
     performing TB screening. Workaround: The immunization clinic will provide a
     written list of individuals that would require the meningococcal vaccine, smallpox
     vaccine, typhoid vaccine, yellow fever vaccine, anthrax vaccine, or TB screening based
     on the exercise scenario.
     7.1.5.6. (Added) Simulation: Simulate manning of 56th Medical Group (56 MDG)
     unsecured entrances, 100% ID checks of all personnel entering the facility, and
     inspection of all hand carried items during EXERCISE FPCON Charlie or Delta IAW 56
     FW Installation Security Plan. Workaround: During an exercise the 56 MDG will
     simulate these actions by posting guards at the unsecured entrances to check IDs and
     inspect packages. These guards will stand post while all measures are implemented and
     for an additional 15 minutes after, for each EXERCISE FPCON level change as indicated
     by the appropriate FPCON checklist.
     7.1.5.7. (Added) Simulation: Simulate movement of patient vehicles beyond 25 meters
     from the 56 MDG. Workaround: During an exercise, the 56 MDG Security Team will
     place signs on all patient car windshields within a 25-meter perimeter of the building that
     would be moved in a real-world scenario. Active Duty members will still be required to
     relocate their vehicles beyond the 25 meter point.
     7.1.5.8. (Added) Simulation: Simulate 56 MDG relocation of dumpsters and
     concrete/rock trash receptacles beyond 25 meters from buildings when required IAW the
     56 FW Installation Security Plan during EXERCISE FPCON Bravo, Charlie, and Delta.
     Workaround: During an exercise, 56 MDG will place signs on all trash receptacles that
     say they have been moved beyond the 25-meter perimeter.
     7.1.5.9. (Added) Simulation: Simulate relocation of dumpsters, concrete/rock trash
     receptacles, vehicles, and objects beyond 25 meters from buildings from the following
     high risk facilities when required IAW the 56 FW Installation Security Plan during
     EXERCISE FPCON Bravo, Charlie, and Delta: Main Exchange (Bldg 1540),
     Commissary (Bldg 1550), and 56th Mission Support Group (56 MSG) (Bldg 1150).
     Workaround: During an exercise, all high risk facilities will comply with the 25-meter
     clear zone requirement except those listed above. These facilities will implement all
     measures during real world contingencies.
     7.1.5.10. (Added) Simulation: Simulate single point of entry to the 56 MDG (Bldg
     1130) and the 56 MSG (Bldg 1150) to include Random Access Measures (RAMs) when
     required during EXERCISE FPCON Bravo, Charlie, and Delta. Workaround: The 56
     MDG and 56 MSG will simulate these actions by posting guards at two separate
     entrances to check IDs and inspect packages as required by CSD. The guards will stand
     post while all measures are implemented for each EXERCISE FPCON level change as
     indicated by the appropriate FPCON checklist.
AETCI10-205_LUKEAFBSUP 13 DECEMBER 2011                                                      15


     7.1.5.11. (Added) Simulation: Simulate the use of forms during deployment exercises
     (DEPLOYEX). Workaround: The full medical screening process will still be
     accomplished to ensure deployers are medically qualified. The 56 MDG will complete
     one full set of paperwork for a single deployer to demonstrate capability and EET will
     validate the process to ensure deployers pass through all phases of the medical clearance
     process.
     7.1.5.12. (Added) Simulation: Simulate quantitative fit test (QNFT) paperwork in gas
     mask carriers for members processing during deployment exercises. Workaround: The
     Bioenvironmental Engineering office will provide documented proof of fit tests for real
     world deployers. If requested by EET they will be prepared to demonstrate the ability to
     perform a fit test on the evaluator or a role player as required.
     7.1.5.13. (Added) Simulation: Simulate the recall of Individual Mobilization
     Augmentee (IMA) personnel. Workaround: LGPPR will contact Unit Reserve
     Coordinators. Unit Reserve Coordinators will telephone all IMAs and inform them of the
     exercise. IMAs will not report to duty. Coordinators will report back to LGRDX with
     the status of the recall.
     7.1.5.14. (Added) Simulation: Simulate shutting down base utilities. Workaround:
     CE will demonstrate capability by dispatching crews to utility turn-off points and having
     them go through their emergency turn-off procedures up to the point where they would
     actually turning off service but will NOT ACTUALLY INTERRUPT SERVICE.
     7.1.5.15. (Added) Simulation: Simulate the use of explosives during exercises
     involving EOD. Workaround: All render safe procedures will be demonstrated using
     training or simulated devices.
     7.1.5.16. (Added) Simulation: Simulate having sponsors meet all visitors at
     installation gates when required in EXERCISE FPCON Charlie. Workaround:
     Sponsors will provide telephone verification of all visitors to the Security Forces Control
     Center. Contractors and delivery vehicle drivers will be escorted when Security Escort
     Service (SES) is available but will not be delayed awaiting an escort. SES will form and
     operate for 2 hours, or until the evaluator or inspector determines the SES procedures are
     adequate.
     7.1.5.17. (Added) Simulation: Simulate filling the Durra-Bull Barriers with water
     when used. Workaround: All barriers will be configured as required in the approved
     barrier placement plan. When requested by EET 56 SFS will be prepared to demonstrate
     the capability by filling one (1) barrier.
     7.1.5.18. (Added) Simulation: Simulate closing Main Exchange and Commissary
     loading ramps when entry is restricted to one door during increased EXERCISE
     FPCONs. Workaround: Loading ramp closure will be demonstrated by posting signs
     and directing visitors to the entry control point (ECP) and closing and locking loading
     ramp doors for 5 minutes.
     7.1.5.19. (Added) Simulation: Simulate applying and/or using neutralization agents
     and use of indicator chemicals during all training and wing exercises. Workaround: All
     equipment, consumables and personal protective equipment (PPE) will be on hand to
     perform HAZMAT duties. Actual use of neutralization chemicals or indicator chemicals
16                                   AETCI10-205_LUKEAFBSUP 13 DECEMBER 2011


     will be simulated to prevent unnecessary risk to personnel, damage to aircraft or
     facilities, long term clean up, and disposal of hazardous byproducts. These steps will be
     simulated and response personnel must display capability using either training equipment
     (if available) or by being able to talk through each step. Finally, personnel will be
     prepared to demonstrate proper donning of PPE when weather and equipment permit.
     Demonstration of proper PPE wear may be performed in climate controlled facilities
     during summer months if required.
  7.1.6. (Added) Non-Standard Simulation. Any simulation not listed in section 7.1.5 of
  this supplement is considered non-standard and must be submitted for approval by the group
  commander by letter through the EET Chief as outlined in Attachment 6 of this instruction.
  Request only one simulation per letter stating subject (short title), simulation description,
  justification, workaround, and POC as a minimum. New simulation requests will be sent for
  review and approval annually when this basic document is sent for review and approval. A
  request statement asking for temporary simulation approval may be added to out-of-cycle
  request submissions.
  7.1.7. (Added) Refer to AFI 90-201 and AETC Sup 1 to AFI 90-201 for additional
  simulation information and/or requests.

   8.5.4. (Added) Activities Exempt from Evacuation. As it is impossible to be aware of all
   events scheduled in a given area of the base from day to day, these one-time functions should
   be considered non-players and not be evacuated.
   8.5.5. (Added) New Exemptions. Any exemption not listed in section 8.5.3 of this
   supplement is considered new and must be submitted for approval by the group commander
   by letter through the EET Chief as outlined in Attachment 7 of this supplement. Request
   only one exemption per letter stating the building number, description of personnel exempted
   (students, non-AF civilians, prisoners, etc.), justification, and POC as a minimum. New
   exemption requests will be sent for review and approval annually when this supplement is
   routed for review and approval. A request statement asking for temporary exemption
   approval may be added to out-of-cycle request submissions.
