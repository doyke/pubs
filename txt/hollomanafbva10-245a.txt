FPCON ALPHA: This condition applies when there is an increased general threat of possible terrorist activity against personnel
or facilities, the nature and extent of which are unpredictable, and circumstances do not justify full implementation of FPCON
BRAVO measures. However, it may be necessary to implement certain measures from higher FPCONs measures resulting from
intelligence received or as a deterrent. The measures in this FPCON must be capable of being maintained indefinitely.
