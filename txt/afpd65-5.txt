aircraft, weapons, space, and information technology; it applies to both military and civilian Air Force
personnel. This publication shall be applied to contractors or other persons through the contract or other
legally binding agreement with the Department of the Air Force. Refer recommended changes and ques-

SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This document is substantially changed and must be reviewed in its entirety.
The changes to this AFPD constitute a complete policy directive update. Included are requirements for
conducting cost, economic, business case, and financial analyses with specific emphasis on acquisition
program cost estimates and Non-Advocate Cost Assessments (NACAs) for milestone reviews, annual
programming and budgeting decisions, source selections, Analysis of Alternatives (AoA), and program
and unit cost breaches (potential Nunn-McCurdy cost breaches). In addition, the AFPD defines key roles
and responsibilities for Headquarters Air Force (HAF) and Major Commands (MAJCOMs).

1. The Air Force shall support the Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution System (PPBES)
and the acquisition system within the Department of Defense, by providing decision makers with credible

and objective cost, economic, and business case analyses. In addition, the Air Force shall provide finan-
cial oversight of Air Force Services Non-Appropriated Fund Instrumentality (NAFI) activities and analy-
sis of the Army and Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES).

2. The Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Financial Management (SAF/FM) is responsible for Air
Force cost, economic, and business case analysis and will work collaboratively with other headquarters
organizations (SAF/AQ, SAF/US, etc.) to ensure analyses provided to decision makers are realistic, reli-
able, and complete.

    3.1. Program cost estimates for Acquisition Category (ACAT) I programs and selected ACAT II/III
    programs.
       3.1.1. ACAT I cost estimates shall be led by a properly qualified member of the Armed Forces or
       full-time employee of the Department of Defense.
       3.1.2. Estimates shall be updated annually and used to support milestone decisions, PPBES for-
       mulation, source selections, program and unit cost breaches (potential Nunn-McCurdy cost
       breaches), and Analysis of Alternatives on programs expected to meet ACAT I thresholds.
    3.2. Non-Advocate Cost Assessments (NACAs) for ACAT I programs and selected ACAT II/III pro-
    grams.
       3.2.1. All NACAs shall be led by a properly qualified member of the Armed Forces or full-time
       employee of the Department of Defense.
       3.2.2. The Service Acquisition Executive (SAE), or delegate, and the Air Force Corporate Struc-
       ture (AFCS) shall consider the NACA in ACAT I program milestone and PPBES decisions. In a
       similar fashion, the Program Executive Officer (PEO)/Center Commander shall use selectively
       generated NACAs at programmatic decision points and in support of PPBES activities for ACAT
       II/III programs.
       3.2.3. NACAs shall be updated annually and used to support milestone decisions, PPBES formu-
       lation, source selections, program and unit cost breaches (potential Nunn-McCurdy cost
       breaches), and Analysis of Alternatives on programs expected to meet ACAT I thresholds.
    3.3. Independent Cost Estimates (ICEs) / Component Cost Analyses (CCAs) for Major Defense
    Acquisition Programs (MDAPs) and Major Automated Information Systems (MAISs) milestones
    where decision authority has been delegated to the SAE.
       3.3.1. All ICEs/CCAs shall be led by a properly qualified member of the Armed Forces or
       full-time employee of the Department of Defense.
       3.3.2. SAF/FM or the SAE may direct stand-alone ICEs/CCAs on a case-by-case basis.
    3.4. Economic analysis (EA), business case analysis (BCA), financial analysis, and special studies.
       3.4.1. Develop inflation indices based on OUSD (Comptroller) guidance.

Terms
Analysis of Alternatives (AoA)â€”A study conducted to explore numerous conceptual solutions with the
goal of identifying the most promising options. The AoA is used to justify the rationale for formal
initiation of the selected course of action.
Business Case Analysis (BCA)â€”A decision support document that identifies alternatives and presents
business, economic, and technical arguments for selecting an alternative to achieve organizational or
functional missions or goals.
Component Cost Analysisâ€”An independent cost estimate or analysis conducted by the Air Force Cost
Analysis Agency.
Cost Estimate / Analysisâ€”A documented analysis that predicts future costs, including profit, to develop
and field a desired system. This requires evaluation of costs and risks of the development, production,
operation, support and disposal of a system. A key element of a comprehensive estimate is a cost risk/
uncertainty analysis of relevant cost, schedule, and performance factors.
Cost Risk / Uncertainty Analysisâ€”The process of quantifying the uncertainties associated with
elements of the cost model such as cost estimating relationships (CERs), technical parameters that drive
CERs, labor and other rates, and the schedule. The probability (risk) that a specific cost target will be
exceeded is derived from the total uncertainty of the estimate.
Economic Analysis (EA)â€”A systematic approach to the allocation of scarce resources. It compares the
present value of the monetary costs and benefits of the alternatives under consideration, and describes and
analyzes relevant non-monetary costs and benefits.
Independent Cost Estimate (ICE)â€”A cost estimate / analysis prepared by an organization not directly
responsible for the development, acquisition, or support of the program. The ICE must include a cost risk/
uncertainty analysis and complete documentation.
Major Automated Information System Program Changeâ€”MAIS programs that experience: a) a
schedule delay of more than six months, but less than one year or b) development cost or full life-cycle
cost growth of at least 15 percent, but less than 25 percent over the original estimate or c) a significant,
adverse change in the expected performance from the parameters originally submitted to Congress, shall
notify congressional defense committees in writing within 45 days of the determination.
Non-Advocate Cost Assessment (NACA)â€”An analysis of program cost / price, as well as schedule and
technical risk, prepared by an organization not directly responsible for the development, acquisition, or
support of the program. NACAs are designed to support the AFCS and acquisition milestone decision
process, and can range from a simple sufficiency review of an existing estimate to a complete ICE. The
NACA should include a cost risk/uncertainty analysis (when possible) and complete documentation.
Program Deviationâ€”A cost, schedule or technical deviation from the approved Acquisition Program
Baseline (APB).
Unit Cost Breach (potential Nunn-McCurdy Cost Breach)â€”Major Defense Acquisition Programs
experiencing: a.) significant cost growth of 15% or more in Program Acquisition Unit Cost (PAUC) or
Average Procurement Unit Cost (APUC) over the current baseline estimate or b.) 30% or more in PAUC
or APUC over the original baseline estimate, are required to notify Congress of the cost growth and
submit a Selected Acquisition Report (SAR) during the quarter the breach was determined. Programs with
critical unit cost increases of at least 25% in PAUC or APUC over the current baseline or 50% in PAUC

or APUC over the original baseline estimate are required to notify Congress, submit a SAR, and submit
SecDef certification (10 USC 2433).
Program Cost Estimate (PCE)â€”The cost estimate produced by the acquiring organization (i.e., Product
Center, ALC, or Laboratory).
