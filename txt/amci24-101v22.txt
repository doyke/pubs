     Development Data (TPFDD) library. Additionally, Core AFSC training requirements are
     identified in the air transportation (2T2X1) Career Field Education and Training Plan
     (CFETP), Specialty Training Standards (STS), and Qualification Training Packages (QTPs).
     1.1.2. For skill-level upgrade, 2T2X1 personnel are first trained in basic and general
     responsibilities, then trained in the specific tasks and duties within the unit. As individuals
     demonstrate proficiency in one section, they may be reassigned and trained in another
     section until they can perform all transportation functions. The STS for air transportation
     provides functional qualification standards.
     1.1.3. Air Transportation Online Training (OT) will be used to supplement performance-
     based instruction but will not replace on-the-job training or serve as a substitute for
     performance evaluations.
     1.1.4. Trainee Evaluation. Unit OJT trainers and instructors will be knowledgeable of
     instructional and evaluation principles.
            1.1.4.1. Objective performance evaluations are the most appropriate way to measure
            task competence since the desired product of training is a fully trained individual,
            able to perform his/her duties with little or no assistance. The standards for
            performance objectives are identified in the 2T2X1 CFETP, STS, and each QTP.
            Performance learning objectives are met only when the trainee demonstrates task
            competence through a performance evaluation.
            1.1.4.2. Objective written/online tests are appropriate for assessing learning geared
            toward increasing knowledge or changing attitudes (i.e., principles of leadership or
            safety). Unless stated in the training criteria, 80% is the minimum passing standard
            for written/online tests.
1.2. Purpose. This volume outlines the requirements to train AMC’s Air Transportation (AFSC
2T2X1) personnel to a level in which they are able to fulfill AMC’s missions.
1.3. Applicability. Requirements outlined in this publication apply to active duty 2T2X1 and
civilian equivalent personnel assigned to AMC units. It also applies to Air Reserve Component
(ARC) units unless otherwise noted.

                   AIR TRANSPORTATION ONLINE TRAINING (OT)
4.1. General. Online training is an individualized computer based training system designed as a
bridge between formal technical school training (AFSC 2T2X1) and upgrade training at unit
level. This concept standardizes training content from formal schools, career development
courses (CDC), and unit OJT. AFRC units will find applicable guidance in AFRCI 24-101,
Reserve Aerial Port Program. ADLS Online training website located at https://amc.csd.disa.mil .
4.2. Purpose. This guidance establishes standardized procedures for operating online training
worldwide. It contains guidelines, sets policy, and defines responsibilities for the use and
maintenance of the online training system. Online training has been designated as a Lead
Command Operating System with HQ AMC/A4TR as the OPR (reference AFI 10-901, Lead
Operating Command-Communications and Information Systems Management).
4.3. Policy:
    4.3.1. Supervisors and trainees will establish a thorough understanding of how to use online
    training software, lesson structure, and how online training applies to OJT.
    4.3.2. Trainees unable to obtain lesson proficiency IAW the lesson objective should receive
    additional training and assistance from their supervisor/trainer. The supervisor/trainer is
    responsible for ensuring task proficiency through hands-on performance evaluation.
    4.3.3. Supervisors will monitor online training with the unit training manager to ensure
    trainees satisfactorily complete all required online training lessons.
    4.3.4. Unit training personnel and supervisors will ensure online training material

      CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, NUCLEAR, AND HIGH-YIELD
                      EXPLOSIVE (CBRNE) TRAINING
5.1. General:
       5.1.1. CBRNE Defense training requirements are outlined in AFI 10-2501, Air Force
       Emergency Management (EM) Program Planning and Operations, paragraph 6.6.1.
       Additional CBRNE operational requirements and training information can be found in
       AFMAN 10-2503, OPERATIONS IN A CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL,
       NUCLEAR, AND HIGH-YIELD EXPLOSIVE (CBRNE) ENVIRONMENT. Several portions of
       AFMAN 10-2503 apply and should be used for training and drilling.
       5.1.2. Unit-level CBRNE training applies to all air transportation personnel at AMC units
       (including Traffic Management Personnel and AMC-gained ARC Personnel assigned to
       aerial ports) with a deployment commitment in high or medium chemical threat areas. The
       intent is to ensure appropriate task qualification training (TQT) is accomplished for
       mission-essential duties in a toxic chemical, biological, or radiological environment while
       wearing a full ground crew chemical ensemble. Individuals must complete unit-conducted
       CBRNE TQT in addition to CBRNE Awareness and CBRNE Survival Skills training IAW
       AFI 10-2501, paragraph 6.6.1.13. When possible, TQT will be conducted in conjunction
       with wing/base exercises. CBRNE TQT must include career field specific duties
       performed within air terminal work centers and during vehicle operations. As a minimum,
       CBRNE TQT will be conducted every 24 months (not applicable to AFRC) and
       documented in G081 or Patriot Excalibur (PEX).
       5.1.3. Air transportation personnel may be tasked to support the establishment and
       operation of an Exchange Zone (EZ) to transfer cargo to/from contaminated and clean
       aircraft without allowing spread of contaminants. EZ procedures (including a step-by-step
       aerial port job guide) can be found in the AMC Counter-Chemical, Biological,
       Radiological, and Nuclear Concept of Operations (AMC C-CBRN CONOPS, 1 Jun 07) on

                                             Chapter 7
         AIR TRANSPORTATION DUTY POSITION TRAINING/EVALUATION


7.1. Purpose. Unit-conducted individual work center qualification training is critical to the
overall success of the unit's mission and the individual. Work center training ensures individuals
are qualified to fulfill their role within the units' transportation processes and ensures tasks are
performed in a safe, satisfactory, and standardized manner. Air Transportation Standardization
and Evaluation (ATSEV) and the use of QTPs create a standardized unit-level
training/evaluation program throughout the air transportation community. QTPs are air
transportation unique lesson plans developed by the USAF Expeditionary Center at the request
and management of HQ AMC/A4T for air transportation units and will be completed prior to
signing off the associated task.
7.2. Qualification Training Package (QTP):
      7.2.1. QTPs are instructional packages designed for use by units to guide trainers and
      evaluators in training/evaluating unit personnel in their assigned tasks. The CFETP
      identifies all career field tasks with QTP’s assigned, annotated with “Q” in the left column
      of the CFETP. Air transportation units will use QTPs, and either Task Training Guide
      (TTGs) or Knowledge Training Guides (KTGs) for all duty position qualification training.
      Task-oriented QTPs consist of a TTG, Training Assessment (TA), lesson plan, and a Task
      Evaluation Checklist (TEC). The TTG is a training guide used by the trainer and includes:
      task number, training objectives, training references, prerequisites such as online training or
      other QTPs that must be completed, an estimated completion time, and training steps.
      QTP’s are located on the AMC/A4TR website: https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-
      af/USAF/AFP40/d/1074111948/Files/a4t/a4tr/training/hello.html .
      7.2.2. Task oriented QTPs (TTGs) require the completion of a TEC. The TEC is an
      evaluation tool that contains a task checklist and blocks for annotating process compliance.
      Most TECs also require the completion of a TA. Reference materials may be used to look
      up the answers to test questions. TAs will be administered online in ADLS. Personnel must
      achieve a score of at least an 80% on the TA before completing the TEC. Oral assessments
      may be administered to employees whose knowledge of the English written language is
      limited. Individuals who do not meet minimum test score requirements or who do not
      satisfactorily complete the TEC will continue with training until the requirements are met.
      7.2.3. Once training is completed, training will be assessed by an individual(s) (other than
      the trainer) who is (are) QTP trained/qualified on the task(s). The ATSEV Quality
      Assurance (QA) Unit Program Manager (UPM) and evaluators will randomly
      observe/assess the training of unit personnel ensuring standardization of training and proper
      process completion. The qualification process involves completion of the applicable TEC
      and TA. Once individuals are QTP trained, the TECs are not required to be maintained and
      will be returned to the trainee. Units should recommend individuals maintain the completed
      TECs should their OJT records become lost.
      7.2.4. Completed TECs will be given to the ARC team chief for later inclusion in Training
      Business Area (TBA) for ARC personnel trained by active duty trainers.
AMCI24-101V22 31 DECEMBER 2012                                                                     13


    7.2.5. If Senior NCOs will be performing any section processes on a recurring basis and/or
    providing training on a task they have never been QTP trained, they must be QTP trained
    before process accomplishment and/or conducting training. Training will be documented in
    TBA.
    7.2.6. Civil service employees are required to train to the QTP standard. Units will need to
    engage local unions regarding the application of the QTPs with this as an approach: QTPs
    are part of AF’s training and evaluation program. Its purpose is to ensure all personnel are
    adequately trained to accomplish their duties. It's a mandatory program for all AMC and
    AMC-gained air transportation personnel, whether active duty, ARC, or civilian. To
    accomplish assigned tasks within the command standard, everyone must be trained. The
    reasons for training are many, but usually are driven by an action that results in an
    individual being introduced to a task for the first time such as a new hire or being reassigned
    to a task that they may have previously performed but require refresher training. Testing is
    just one tool used by a trainer to evaluate the effectiveness of training. By testing, we
    evaluate the training, not the individual. No civilian employee will be penalized for failing
    test(s) given to evaluate training. Should a trainee fail in testing, training will continue until
    the employee reaches the point where they can pass the test(s). Additionally, tests are not to
    be used as an appraisal of performance nor will testing be a factor in the member’s annual
    appraisal or maintained as part of a members record. Union chapters support quality
    assurance and training as long as results do not affect the annual appraisal. Local Civilian
    Personnel Office and Staff Judge Advocate know how to approach the union and they
    understand the local labor contract (contracts vary by location). Local union leadership
    must be consulted since they will be able to provide you with advice on any issues you may
    have administering training and the evaluation of training to our civilian employees.
7.3. Proficiency Assessment. If an individual changes duty station or duty position (PCS, PCA,
or TDY), a Proficiency Assessment (PA) is required by the new supervisor. The supervisor must
conduct a PA using the individuals training record(s) with the individual and determine the
current proficiency level in each assigned duty position task. The supervisor determines, from
the assessment, if QTP re-training is required. This session will be documented in the
individual’s TBA record.
7.4. Retraining. Automatic/recurring QTP duty position re-training is not required, regardless
of status (Active/ARC/Civilian). Exceptions are as follows: retraining is requested by the
individual, during repeat process evaluation(s) the individual demonstrates a lack of proficiency,
or the supervisor determines from the PA that QTP retraining is required. Note: Section
leadership will determine the number of failures required before the retraining of a process must
be accomplished.
7.5. Process Evaluations. Process evaluations are assessments of procedures required to
accomplish the unit’s mission. Every effort should be made to evaluate personnel in the
performance of their daily transportation duties without disruption of the normal work schedule.
The evaluation focus is on the efficient and effective completion of processes without any major
findings. Safety is inherent in all processes and will be an integral part of all evaluations.
Immediately stop all process evaluations where safety is compromised.

7.6. Material Handling Equipment (MHE) and Vehicle Evaluations:
      7.6.1. Safe and proper MHE operation is of the utmost importance. In addition to initial
      training and qualification, a qualified instructor shall evaluate each operator at least once
      every 3 years and provide refresher training in relevant topics as required. Exception: our
      weapons systems (i.e. Tunner and Halvorsen) require an annual qualification requirement.
      To ensure personnel remain proficient on the vehicles used within their duty section all
      operators must receive an evaluation on each vehicle type. The evaluation process will
      consist of all three vehicle inspections (before, during, and after) and vehicle operation.
      During the evaluation process, evaluator assistance will not be provided to the individual.
      The evaluation shall include, but not be limited to, changes in types of equipment in use,
      changes in operating environment, reportable mishaps, due caution notices, and reports of
      near-misses. Document initial training in TBA and refresher evaluations in G081 or PEX.
      Personnel who are/have been unqualified or currently trained and have not driven a specific
      piece of MHE for an excessive period of time must undergo an evaluation to determine if
      they still possess the skills and knowledge to safely operate the MHE. Also, individuals
      initiating a mishap during MHE operation must undergo an evaluation. If the result of the
      evaluation is that they are not qualified, the QTP must be re-accomplished. If the MHE is a
      K-Loader, the unit must decide if they should re-accomplish the 2-week/3-day course or just
      the QTP.
      7.6.2. The MHE Evaluation requirement may be met by capturing and documenting a
      Personal Evaluation (PE) of a MHE operator that resulted in a Pass. There are no testing
      (TAs) requirements for this evaluation. Note: If leadership determines they cannot
      maintain MHE operator proficiency due to limited deployments/MHE usage they may
      require annual evaluations of operators.
      7.6.3. The C-5 Staircase Truck is a complex vehicle requiring qualified and proficient
      personnel when positioning and de-positioning at the aircraft. Therefore, in addition to the
      initial training requirements, refresher training evaluations must be completed every 2 years
      by re-accomplishing the applicable QTP. Document the initial training in TBA and
      refresher training in G081 or PEX.
7.7. Work center trainers will:
      7.7.1. Meet all requirements listed in AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program; AMCI
      24-101, Vol 20, Air Transportation Standardization Evaluation (ATSEV) Quality
      Assurance, and this instruction.
      7.7.2. Be QTP trained in the tasks/processes for which they train others.
      7.7.3. Ensure QTPs are current before use.
      7.7.4. Complete the Air Force Training Course.

   LOGISTICS RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (LRM) TRAINING REQUIREMENTS
9.1. Purpose. LRM is a course designed to immerse all personnel into the culture and
knowledge of human factors philosophy focusing on the importance, requirements, and
implementation of LRM principles into daily logistics activities. Error reduction efforts through
human factors will be used to improve processes, reduce logistics errors, decrease logistics
induced damage, and decrease on-the-job-injuries. This will be done by integrating the technical
skills of logistics personnel with interpersonal skills and basic human factors knowledge along
with operational risk management in order to improve communication, effectiveness, and safety
in logistics operations.
        9.1.1. To facilitate our common LRM culture, the Air Force’s Core LRM course will
        consist of a one-time 16-24 hour block of instruction taught by a certified LRM
        instructor using the mandatory course material currently documented on the A4TR
        website:       https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af/USAF/AFP40/d/1074111948/Files/a4t/a4tr/
        training/hello.html .
        9.1.2. LRM refresher class will be every two years and no less than 4 hours of
        instruction tailored to highlight local base procedures/conditions.
        9.1.3. LRM training is required at all CONUS and overseas long-tour locations
        and will be taught to all military personnel and government civilians serving in
        Air Transportation organizations to include Aerial Port Squadrons, Air Mobility
        Squadrons, Logistics Readiness Squadrons and Aerial Port Flights. Because of
        the challenges posed by manpower rotations, LRM training is not required at
        short-tour locations; however, these units will advocate LRM to the maximum
        extent possible in order to strengthen the cultural changes LRM requires to
        succeed.
               9.1.3.1. The HQ AMC/A4T will:
               9.1.3.2. Assign an LRM OPR and identify the OPR POC to units.
               9.1.3.3. Conduct annual course reviews to ensure currency of LRM course content.
        9.1.4. Commanders will:
              9.1.4.1. Ensure an effective Logistics Resource Management (LRM) program is
              being properly executed and managed.
              9.1.4.2. Encourage training participation and attendance by other base agencies.
              9.1.4.3. When practical, classes are populated with a mixture of AFSs, skill levels
              and ranks from across Logistics to maximize benefits of course discussions.
              9.1.4.4. Determine applicability and requirement for LRM training for AF
              military personnel possessing transportation AFSCs, but performing duties in
              non-transportation positions.
              9.1.4.5. Course completion will be tracked in G081 using course code ANCL
              000040 or in PEX (CRWs only).
              9.1.4.6. Identify and appoint personnel to serve as LRM course instructors
AMCI24-101V22 31 DECEMBER 2012                                                  17

                             JOINT INSPECTION TRAINING
                           (Not Applicable to Guard and Reserve)
A4.1. Joint inspection Definition. Joint inspection (JI) is the inspection of aircraft loads by
qualified representatives from the moving unit and the supporting airlift representative.
A4.2. Objective and Scope:
       A4.2.1. Provide the guidance and tools necessary to ensure standardized JI training is
       being provided to selected unit personnel. JI instruction at the unit level will be executed
       using HQ AMC-approved curriculum to ensure standardized training command wide.
       A4.2.2. At a minimum, each unit will have enough fully qualified JI personnel as tasked
       by their associated AEF TPFDD library.
       A4.2.3. All AMC units must establish a JI Program IAW this publication. Exceptions
       will be made on a case-by-case basis in coordination with HQ AMC/A4TR. Program
       requirements consist of three elements:
                A4.2.3.1. Joint Inspection Instructor Qualification Course.
                A4.2.3.2. Hazardous materials inspector/preparer qualifications IAW AFMAN

      planning, careful scheduling, timely implementation, capable direction, and skillful
      application. Commanders and supervisors at all levels must support the program to assure
      its effectiveness.
      A4.4.3. The JI process is extremely important for a safe air deployment. It is designed as
      a partnership between the mobility force inspection team and the deploying force. Joint
      inspection personnel must be familiar with and adhere to the applicable guidance and
      procedures outlined in the publications and T.O.s specified in Attachment 1 of this
