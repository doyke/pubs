1. General Information. AMC’s warfighting mission requires command insight and involvement in all
major focus areas for Special Access Programs (SAPs) ranging from Department of Defense (DoD) SAPs
sponsored by individual services to those processes managed at Joint Staff and Air Staff levels to enhance
warfighting capability. To minimize strain on Headquarters AMC (HQ AMC) staff resources, streamline
both internal and external communications, and ensure maximum efficiency, the oversight of these focus
areas are the responsibility of a single organization, HQ AMC/CVZ (Combat Capabilities). HQ AMC/
CVZ reports directly to the Vice Commander, but supports all directorates within HQ AMC and subordi-
nate AMC units.
   1.1. HQ AMC/CVZ will serve as Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) for all SAP issues. As
   OPR, HQ AMC/CVZ will function as AMC’s SAP Central Office (SAPCO) to provide policy, over-
   sight, and guidance for SAP management. Additionally, HQ AMC/CVZ will identify the appropriate
   organization(s) within AMC to serve as Office of Coordinating Responsibility (OCR) and delegate
   execution of specific programs and/or mission areas to the appropriate organization(s) or determine
   that program management and execution to remain within HQ AMC/CVZ.
