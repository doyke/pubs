                                            Chapter 1

                                  GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. General. The purpose of this instruction is to bring together all the services provided by
the 30th Operations Support Squadron Weather Flight (30 OSS/OSW) to all customers on
Vandenberg Air Force Base. For the purpose of this document, the term Weather Flight (WF) is
used synonymously with the 30 OSS/OSW and refers to the entire weather flight. Basic support
concepts and procedures are outlined in this instruction along with Air Force and Air Force
Space Command directives, the Range Universal Documentation System (UDS) and 30 OSS
Operating Instructions for range support.
1.2. Concept of Operations. The WF provides operational and staff weather support to the
30th Space Wing (30 SW) and tenant units; mission weather services for all DoD and
commercial spacelift/ballistic missile missions on VAFB; observation and forecasting support
for DoD and commercial spacelift, ballistic missile test, and air operations on VAFB and west
coast offshore operating area; resource protection for VAFB/30 SW and tenant unit resources
and people; trained weather professionals to support contingencies worldwide; weather data and
studies for planning. The WF operates weather systems to support operations at VAFB.
Agencies requiring weather support will contact the WF with the pertinent details as early as
possible. Agencies requiring recurring support not covered in this instruction will contact the
WF Commander (see Attachment 1, Point of Contact). Adequate notice is essential for optimum
support.
     1.2.1. The WF is comprised of two sections focused on different aspect of the mission. The
     operations section deals with weather support to the customer and training. The systems
     section manages weather system requirements, scientific research, climatology
     services/support, and is the technical interface to acquire, upgrade, and sustain systems.
     1.2.2. A contract organization provides surface observation data for the Vandenberg airfield
     and upper-air observation data from the surface to approximately 100,000 feet above the
     range.
     1.2.3. Non-flying missions include all space and ballistic launch/recovery support.
     1.2.4. The WF has both an in-place wartime mission and a mobility mission. Active duty
     members are assigned to Air and Space Expeditionary Force Unit Task Codes. Activated
     members receive pre-deployment training prior to deployment.
1.3. Operational Sensor Suite. To fulfill the weather support mission, the WF operates an
extensive suite of weather sensors and systems to ingest, process, manage, distribute, and archive
meteorological information from local sensors, as well as national, international, and satellite
sources. The unit uses 26 wind towers, 15 wind profilers, 4 lightning detection sensors, 3
Automated Surface Observing Systems, and a Doppler Radar to gather weather data across the
range. Due to the diversity of specialized systems and number of active sensors, the
meteorological equipment suite represents one of the largest concentrations of meteorological
instrumentation in the world. The density of sensors, combined with state of the art technology
and 24-hour-a-day collection, provides a multitude of specialized measurements that helps the
USAF and its mission customers to successfully complete their missions in a variety of weather
conditions. This unique and comprehensive meteorological data is also available to academic
30SWI15-101 15 MARCH 2013                                                                   7


and government research scientists, if approved by the WF/CC or designee.         The Range
Instrumentation Handbook describes WF weather equipment in further detail.
1.4. Duty Priorities. WF operations personnel can become task saturated at times (e.g., sudden
onset of severe weather). To assist WF personnel in prioritization of customer support during
such times, principal duty priorities are defined below. WF observers (Table 1.1.) and
forecasters (Table 1.2) will adhere to these priorities, and supported agencies should have an
understanding of these priorities.

1.5. Assumptions, Shortfalls, and Limitations.
     1.5.1. WF Assumptions. Weather support can only be provided if the appropriate facilities,
     funding, communications, personnel, and indigenous support (e.g., power, water, etc) are
     available.
     1.5.2. WF Shortfalls. Some services may not be available (e.g., out of station briefings) due
     to other higher priority missions.
     1.5.3. WF Limitations.
        1.5.3.1. Forecasting Limitations. The WF issues operational forecasts valid for periods
        up to 24 hours. Beyond 24 hours, all forecasts are for planning/information only.
        Forecasts or outlooks beyond 10 days are largely based on climatology.
        1.5.3.2. Watches, Warnings and Advisories (WWAs) Limitations. The expanse and
        topography of the WR requires regional tailoring of forecast support and products. All
        WWAs will extend out to and include 10 Nautical Miles (NM) from the VAFB boundary.
        The exception is warnings pertaining to winds, which are issued to cover North VAFB, ,
        and/or the airfield. The lightning warning is broken out to cover North VAFB and South
        VAFB. No WWAs are issued for the airfield during periods of airfield closure. In these
        cases, notices will apply to the airfield environment. Specific WWAs procedures are
        detailed in Chapter 7.
            1.5.3.2.1. Wind warnings above 1,000 ft sea level. Topographic features and lack
            of representative weather instrumentation make it difficult to forecast winds for sites
            above 1,000 ft sea level. As a result, sites above 1,000 ft use north and south VAFB
            wind warnings for below 1,000 ft (figure 7.2.) for winds > 35 kts but < 50 kts as a
            precursor for potentially higher winds. Sites above 1,000 ft only receive an official
            wind warning when winds are forecasted > 65 kts.
        1.5.3.3. Observing Limitations.
            1.5.3.3.1. The observer location is slightly behind building 1765 (balloon shelter),
            with the airfield complex 1 1/2 miles to the south. The facility does not allow a 360-
            degree view of the runway complex from the official observation point. There is an
            obstruction from 150–180 degrees due to Base Operations and Flight Line Fire
            buildings.
            1.5.3.3.2. The Alternate Observing Site is located behind building 1746. Buildings
            adjacent to the flightline and trees restrict the view from the northeast to southeast,
            out to approximately 3/8 miles.
            1.5.3.3.3. The WF uses the Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS) for most
            elements of a surface observation. The weather observer manually transmits surface
            observations both locally and longline when the airfield is open. When the airfield is
            closed, the observation is transmitted by the ASOS longline with an AUTO remark
            just after the date-time group. When the airfield is closed, the observation is not
            transmitted locally on Joint Environmental Toolkit (JET).
            1.5.3.3.4. Runway Visual Range (RVR) Limitations. The Representative
            Observation Site (ROS) has the ability to use ASOS visibility readings to manually
30SWI15-101 15 MARCH 2013                                                                     9


           compute Runway Visual Range (RVR) and transmit it on JET when required per
           AFMAN 15-111.
1.6. WF Sharepoint Site. The WF site on the Vandenberg Sharepoint page is located under the
following URL: https://eis.afspc.af.mil/unit/30sw/30wf/Pages/Default.aspx . This site
provides a link to the 5-day forecast. The WF will email data, such as the Range Operations 5-
Day forecast, to those who cannot access this site.
1.7. Release of Weather Information. Release of weather information to non-DoD agencies or
the public must be approved by the WF/CC or designee. The WF will consult with 30 SW
Public Affairs and 30 SW Office of the Staff Judge Advocate before requesting release authority.

                                            Chapter 3

                                    AIRFIELD SERVICES

3.1. Forecasting Hours of Operation. The Weather Operations Center (WOC), located in Bldg
21150, operates Monday through Friday from 0400L to 2000L and Saturday/Sunday from 0700L
to 1500L.     The WOC will operate 24-hours per day 72 hours prior to scheduled
launch/recoveries.
3.2. Terminal Aerodrome Forecasts (TAF). Range Weather Forecasters (RWF) aid the 25th
Operational Weather Squadron (25 OWS) to prepare a TAFfor the area within a 5 statute mile
radius of the airfield at 0700L and 1500L Monday through Friday and on weekends if the airfield
is open. A third TAF is issued at 2300L if flight operations are on-going.
3.3. Observing Hours of Operation. At a minimum, weather observers man the
Representative Observation Site (ROS) and provide surface observing services from 1 hour prior
to scheduled airfield opening until the airfield closes. Weather observers conduct daily upper-air
soundings at 1200 UTC (ZULU), when weather conditions warrant, and as required for range
operations.
3.4. Basic Weather Watch (BWW). A BWW will be conducted by weather personnel when
the airfield is open and there is a radiosonde balloon being tracked in the air. Because of the
balloon tracking, the observer cannot monitor the weather continuously and may not detect and
report all weather changes as they occur. The BWW observing program establishes the
minimum requirements needed to ensure the proper level of weather watch is maintained.
   3.4.1. During a BWW, weather personnel will recheck weather conditions, at intervals not to
   exceed 20 minutes since the last observation/recheck, to determine the need for a SPECI
   observation, when any of the following conditions are observed to be occurring or are
   forecast to occur within 1 hour:
       3.4.1.1. Ceiling forms below or decreases to less than 1,500 feet;
       3.4.1.2. Ceiling dissipates, or increases to equal or exceed 1,500 feet;
       3.4.1.3. Visibility decreases to less than 3 miles (4800 meters);
       3.4.1.4. Visibility increases to equal or exceed 3 miles (4800 meters);
       3.4.1.5. Precipitation (any form);
       3.4.1.6. Thunderstorms;
       3.4.1.7. Fog or mist
   3.4.2. In addition to the above minimum requirements, weather personnel will remain alert
   for any other changes in weather conditions that will require a SPECI observation. Weather
   personnel will also monitor local area observational and forecast products as often as
   necessary to keep abreast of changes expected to affect their area of responsibility.
3.5. Continuous Weather Watch (CWW). A CWW is conducted when no weather balloons
are being tracked, so weather personnel will monitor weather conditions continuously and
perform no other significant duties. In addition to taking METARs, weather personnel will take
and disseminate observations as conditions occur that meet SPECI observation criteria.
30SWI15-101 15 MARCH 2013                                                                  15


3.6. Cooperative Weather Watch. Vandenberg control tower personnel will perform a
cooperative weather watch, IAW Paragraph 9.9.5, and notify the observer of previously
unreported changes in the weather which could be critical to flight safety or other WR
operations.
3.7. Observation Types. The WF produces two different types of observations.
   3.7.1. Manual Observations. When the airfield is open, a position qualified weather
   technician is responsible for observing, evaluating, and preparing METAR/SPECI
   observations. These observations will be disseminated locally and longline via JET.
   3.7.2. Automated Observations. During non-duty hours when the airfield is closed, the
   Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS) will continually sense and measure the
   atmosphere and send out observations longline as required. The ASOS has no local
   dissemination capability.
3.8. Points of Observation. For most meteorological elements the airfield is the primary Point
of Observation.
   3.8.1. Airfield. The ASOS located on the airfield measures prevailing visibility, present
   weather, obscurations, temperature, dew point, pressure and wind data.
   3.8.2. Observation Facility. The cloud height and ceiling elements are measured at the
   airfield via the ASOS sensors and, during hours of manual observing, the weather technician
   will use these readings as a baseline during their evaluation and preparation of the
   METAR/SPECI observations.
3.9. Special and Local Weather Observation Criteria. Observing procedures and observation
criteria are derived from AFMAN 15-111, Surface Weather Observations, and from DoD Flight
Information Publications (FLIP) published specifically for VAFB.
3.10. Limited Observation Support. Agencies requiring surface observing support from other
VAFB locations will coordinate in advance with the WOC or WF NCOIC (see Attachment 1,
Points of Contact).
3.11. Dissemination of Observations. Airfield observations are disseminated to VAFB air
traffic control tower, base operations, and the command post and to the worldwide network via
JET when observers are on duty at the ROS. Automated Surface Observation System (ASOS)
airfield observations are available via telephone when observers are not on duty at the ROS
during forecasting operating hours (see Attachment 1, Points of Contact).
3.12. Backup Dissemination of Observations. In the event of a JET outage, airfield
observations will be disseminated via telephone or direct line first to the VAFB control tower
and then to the base operations and command post. Observations will be disseminated longline
via the Joint Air Force and Army Information Network or another AF weather station if
NIPRNet is down.
3.13. Upper-Air Observing. Upper-air operations are conducted from Bldg 1764, . Upper-air
observers will obtain VAFB control tower clearance, when the airfield is open or contact Los
Angeles Center when the VAFB airfield is closed before releasing balloons not associated with
mission operations. To collect upper level weather information, the observers release two
different types of Radiosondes:
 16                                                          30SWI15-101 15 MARCH 2013


   3.13.1. High Resolution Radiosondes. High Resolution Automated Meteorological Profiling
   System (AMPS) radiosondes are connected directly beneath a clear Jimsphere balloon. They
   measure wind speed and direction only, and have an altitude restriction of approximately
   55,000 feet. They are called “high resolution” winds because of the Jimspheres capability to
   detect small-scale wind features. These radiosondes are used for mission support only.
   3.13.2. Low Resolution Radiosondes. Low Resolution AMPS radiosondes are connected 70
   feet below a latex balloon. They measure wind direction and speed, temperature, and
   humidity. These balloons reach at least 100,000 feet on a regular basis. The wind
   measurements are considered “low resolution” because the pendulum motion of the 70 foot
   train is filtered out during derivation of the final winds, eliminating small-scale wind
   features. These radiosondes are used for both mission and daily synoptic runs.
3.14. Pilot to Metro Services (PMSV). RWFs provide PMSV response during operating hours
on assigned frequency 342.4MHz. Aircrews shall relay pilot reports (PIREP) during PMSV
contacts.

4.1. Range Operations 5-Day Forecast. This forecast is for planning purposes and is issued at
0500L and 1600L Monday through Friday and by 0800L on Saturday and Sunday. The forecast
highlights weather conditions that may affect upcoming range operations (Figure 4.1. and 4.2.).
The forecast is coded G/Y/R for each specific operation to indicate the likelihood of any weather
impacts. If Y or R is forecast for the operation, the weather element expected to violate a
constraint is annotated next to the Y or R indicator. This forecast acts as a “heads-up”. Prior to
beginning any operation, contact the RWF to obtain a site/mission-specific forecast.

4.2. L-X Day Forecasts. The Launch Weather Officer (LWO) provides operational weather
forecasts for all spacelift and ballistic missile launch/recoveries. Mission forecasts that specify
the probability of violating constraints are typically issued at L-3 days and is provided in the
standard format (Figure 4.3.). L-X day forecasts are not amended and are issued once per day
leading up to a mission.

4.4. Staff Weather Briefings. Any 30 SW agency can request a weather briefing to an
audience located on base. Some examples of staff weather briefings are the wing staff meeting,
START, and deployment weather briefings. If the location of interest for the briefing is
susceptible to tropical cyclone activity, keep in mind the 48 to 72 hour tropical cyclone outlooks
contain a high degree of uncertainty, are for planning purposes only, and are subject to change.
The WF will not deviate from the official tropical cyclone forecasts issued by the National
Hurricane Center.

                           MISSION EXECUTION FORECASTS

5.1. Mission Execution Forecast (MEF). The WF will deliver MEFs through three different
avenues: Flight Weather Briefing (DD Form 175-1), Toxic Hazard Zone (THZ) forecasts, and on
console mission forecasts. The WF will coordinate/tailor the delivery method and timing of the
MEF with supported agencies to fit mission requirements. WF personnel will tailor information
delivery to critical decision points (outlined on the MEFs) within the supported agencies’
operational cycle (e.g., mission planning) where a weather forecast would provide the maximum
benefit to the successful outcome of the mission. WF personnel will use the mission execution
forecast process (MEFP) throughout MEF creation. The MEFP is constantly changing and being
updated to provide weather support to leadership so they can make the correct operational
decisions with regards to weather and environmental effects. The MEFP is a continuous cycle
that adapts as parent/host location needs change. The deliberate process governing why we
choose a particular product to build our MEFs is Operational Risk Management (ORM). The
six-step ORM cycle (Table 5.1) is interwoven into our MEFP to ensure hazards and risks are
identified, controlled and reviewed in the most effective manner. A brief description of the six-
step ORM process is listed below. MEFs must be horizontally consistent with (but not
necessarily mirror) products issued by Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA) and all Operational
Weather Squadrons used to create the MEF. However, during rapidly changing conditions,
emergencies, or when conditions threaten resource protection, the WF will amend the MEF to
accurately reflect conditions.

Step 6. Supervise and Review            Keep a watch out on your controls, cancel if
                                        necessary and review if anything can be learned.
5.2. Flight Weather Briefing, DD Form 175-1. WF will provide transient aircrews with a
flight weather briefing when requested. The RWF will conduct the flight weather briefings by
telephone. Flight departure, enroute, and destination weather is briefed using DD Form 175-1,
30SWI15-101 15 MARCH 2013                                                                     23


Flight Weather Briefing, or local form (Figure 5.2). WR mission briefings will include off-
shore weather conditions, sea states and other information, as requested.

5.3. Toxic Hazard Zone (THZ) Forecasts. WOC personnel prepare/disseminate cold-spill
THZ forecasts using the Meteorological and Range Safety Support System (MARSSS) and Air
Force Toxic (AFTOX) diffusion model. Specific information is provided in Attachment 6 and
30 SWI 91-106, Toxic Hazard Assessments.
   5.3.1. Each THZ is issued with a 2-hour valid time and is monitored and verified at 45 and
   90 minutes into the valid period.
   5.3.2. THZs will be amended in accordance with launch facility and safety requirements.
   Following is the amendment criteria:
      5.3.2.1. Initial distance of either Tier 3 or 2 is 500 feet or less and the 45/90 minute
      distance exceeds the initial distance by 50 feet or 20%, whichever is greater.
      5.3.2.2. Observed wind speed is less than 4 knots and initial Potential Hazard Zone
      (PHZ)/Emission Hazard Zone (EHZ) forecast azimuth was not circular.
      5.3.2.3. Observed wind speed is 4 knots or greater and initial PHZ/EHZ forecast azimuth
      was circular.
      5.3.2.4. Observed standard deviation is two or more times the initial standard deviation.
 24                                                            30SWI15-101 15 MARCH 2013


       5.3.2.5. Observed wind direction differs from the initial wind direction by plus or minus
       twice the initial standard deviation or more.
   5.3.3. The originator of the request receives the THZ by phone and/or JET.
   5.3.4. Hot spill toxic forecasts are prepared and disseminated by 30 SW/SEL incorporating
   data provided by WOC personnel.
5.4. On Console Weather Forecast. The Launch Weather Team (LWT) uses all
meteorological sensing equipment, to include weather reconnaissance aircraft, to assess the
current and forecasted atmospheric conditions for mission operations. The LWT must have clear
and convincing evidence that all launch commit criteria (LCC) are not being violated. The eight
range safety LCCs are mandatory to protect Vandenberg vehicles from natural and triggered
lightning (Figure 5.3. through 5.12.). The WF uses the Advanced Weather Interactive
Processing System (AWIPS) to create an on console weather forecast to achieve this result. The
briefing is typically composed of:
   5.4.1. Slide 1: General Slide detailing mission information (Name of mission, date of launch,
   etc).
   5.4.2. Slide 2: Severe Weather Status highlighting any WWAs.
   5.4.3. Slide 3: Exposure Forecast.
   5.4.4. Slide 3: Launch/recovery Forecast.

                      LAUNCH/RECOVERY WEATHER SERVICES

6.1. Launch/Recovery Support. The WF provides comprehensive launch/recovery support to
the DoD, National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), Missile Defense Agency (MDA) and
commercial launch/recovery providers operating at Vandenberg. Each customer requests
weather support in the Universal Documentation System (UDS) based on their mission-unique
requirements for the space environment, wind, precipitation, temperature, etc. The available 30
OSS/OSW support is then documented in the applicable Operations Directive (OD). The major
launch/recovery systems supported at Vandenberg include Delta II, Delta IV, Atlas V, Pegasus,
Minotaur, Taurus, and MDA test vehicles and interceptors. Descriptions of these systems are
found in the Forecast Reference Notebook (FRN).
6.2. Pre-launch/Recovery Weather Support. Many weather services are provided prior to the
day of launch/recovery, such as:
   6.2.1. Weather Constraint Coordination. The LWO, in consultation with the Program
   Support Manager (PSM) and the launch customer, assists in determining the launch weather
   constraints for each mission and how the constraints will be monitored. The resulting
   documents that detail the weather constraints are the OD and the launch constraints
   document. Launch vehicle specific weather sensitivities and support requirements change
   with each mission and are identified within the UDS.
   6.2.2. Balloon Tests. Upper-air weather services and the ability of the launch customer to
   access balloon data are often tested several times in the days and weeks leading up to the
   launch/recovery. Members of the LWT will release the balloons and make any required
   editing of the data during these balloon tests.
   6.2.3. Dress Rehearsals. The LWO participates in rehearsals that are part of each mission
   campaign to include wet dress and mission dress rehearsals.
   6.2.4. Preliminary Briefings/Reviews. The LWO provides operational weather forecasts
   for all spacelift and ballistic missile launch/recoveries. The L-X day forecasts are provided
   in the standard format (see Chapter 4, Planning Weather). In addition, LWOs provide
   weather briefings at the Group Readiness Review, Pre-Launch Readiness Review, and
   Launch Readiness Review as well as other reviews depending on the launch agency and
   vehicle. Readiness review weather briefings include the status of weather equipment and the
   launch weather team for the launch/recovery as well as the expected weather for the
   launch/recovery and a POV either a user or safety weather constraint.
6.3. Day of Launch/Recovery Weather Support. The WF utilizes the majority of its
personnel to provide weather support on the day of launch/recovery.
   6.3.1. On Console Weather Support. The LWO leads the LWT and must have clear and
   convincing evidence that all launch commit criteria are not being violated. With the
   concurrence of the Launch Weather Commander, the LWO gives the final weather "go" for
   launch/recovery. During on-console briefings (see Chapter 6, MEF) the LWO provides
   current status as either "Red" or "Green" indicating a constraint is either currently violated or
   not violated. The LWO will also provide a POV, which indicates the probability that a
30SWI15-101 15 MARCH 2013                                                                   29


  constraint will be violated at T-0. A high POV value indicates a likely "Red" condition at T-
  0 and allows the launch agency to choose a desired hold point in the count that occurs before
  an irreversible event in the countdown.
  6.3.2. Upper-Air and Surface Observing. Upper-air balloon observations as well as
  balloon editing services are provided on the day of launch/recovery. These observations are
  needed by the launch customer in making the final decision to launch and by 30 SW/SEL in
  determining safety of flight. The balloon schedule is determined by range safety's
  requirements and by the launch customer's requirements outlined in the OD. Although each
  mission has its own unique balloon schedule, the first balloon is generally released
  approximately 8-10 hours before T-0. On average, weather balloons are then released
  approximately every hour; however, the time between balloon releases varies widely within
  each mission.
  6.3.3. Cold Spill Toxic Hazard Zones. Cold-spill toxic analyses are provided by the range
  weather forecaster during the countdown to determine the threat to the base and local
  population in the event of an unplanned release of toxic chemicals before the launch. An
  increase in the size of a cold-spill THZ does not itself impact the launch countdown. It can
  be used by range safety and/or the launch agency as a reason to avoid proceeding with a
  particularly dangerous stage of the countdown where the potential for a toxic spill is at its
  greatest.
  6.3.4. Hot Spill Weather Forecast. During mission operations the WF provides specialized
  wind and thermodynamic forecasts for T-0. These forecasts are used by 30 SW/SEL to
  conduct hot spill safety analyses using the Rocket Exhaust Effluent Diffusion Model
  (REEDM) and the Launch Area Toxic Risk Analysis (LATRA) program.
  6.3.5. Blast Distant Focusing Overpressure Model (BlastDFO). For certain mission
  operations, namely large class EELVs (Delta IV and Atlas V), the WF provides wind and
  thermodynamic forecasts to 30 SW/SEL to conduct blast distant focusing overpressure
  analyses using the BlastDFO model. Based on the results of the BlastDFO output, 30
  SW/SEL may halt the countdown or delay the mission due to the threat to personnel and the
  public.
 30                                                             30SWI15-101 15 MARCH 2013


                                            Chapter 7

            WEATHER WARNINGS, WATCHES, AND ADVISORIES (WWA)

7.1. Customer Requirements. Western Range agencies and customers needing special WWA
support will document their requirements and forward them to the Flt/CC for review and
validation. Customer requirements must include weather phenomenon and thresholds (when
applicable), lead-time required for notification, and actions taken by the customer upon receipt of
a warning, watch, or advisory. The final decision is left to the Flt/CC to approve changes to
current lead times due to mission constraints of other users. Figure 7.1. shows a complete list of
those agencies and offices that get notified in the event of severe weather. It also outlines what
office will make the notification.

Figure 7.1. WWA notification chain
30SWI15-101 15 MARCH 2013                                                                          31


7.2. Meteorological Watch (METWATCH) Program. Via the METWATCH program, the
WF monitors observations and forecasts for weather conditions that will endanger property or
life, pose a safety hazard, or adversely affect a supported customer’s operations. When these
conditions are observed or forecast to occur, the WF will notify customers of these critical
weather conditions through weather warnings, watches and advisories issued through JET.
Exception: Pillar Point AFS receives wind warnings via the 25th OWS.
   7.2.1. Weather Warnings. A weather warning is a special notice to support agencies giving
   them advanced notification (with sufficient time for protective actions) of weather
   conditions, of sufficient intensity to pose a hazard to life, property, expected to directly affect
   a designated geographic area or an area defined within a set nautical mile distance of a
   designated location.
   7.2.2. Weather Watches. A weather watch is a special notice to supported agencies
   concerning atmospheric conditions that may signal a future potential for weather conditions
   of intensity to pose a hazard to life or property. It can be used as a “heads up” for agencies to
   consider making plans to take required protective actions should an actual Weather Warning
   be issued. If weather conditions do favor severe weather, or if severe weather is imminent,
   the Watch will be upgraded to a Warning.
   7.2.3. Weather Advisories. A weather advisory is a special notice to supported agencies
   notifying them that non-severe weather conditions, which could affect their operations, are
   occurring within a designated geographic area or within a set nautical mile distance of a
   designated location.
7.3. WWA Criteria. Weather forecasters prepare and issue weather WWA for VAFB as
defined in Tables 7.1, 7.2. and 7.3. Desired lead-time is the advanced notice a supported agency
needs to react to an advisory or warning/watch and put protective measures into effect. WF
weather warnings and watches require lead times deviate from the standard set of warnings and
watches listed in AFMAN 15-129, Table 3.14. These deviations have been coordinated with
Western Range Customers and the 30th Space Wing Commander to meet the unique mission and
resource protection requirements of Vandenberg AFB. This requires base personnel to take
appropriate protective measures due to warnings/watches issued for 10 NM vice 5 NM distances,
as noted in AFOSH Standard 91-100.

7.5. Severe Weather Action Procedures (SWAP). The duty forecaster will alert the WF
NCOIC after the issuance of any watches or warnings. The WF NCOIC will determine if the
Severe Weather Action Team (SWAT) needs to be activated. The SWAT will respond as
required, before the expected occurrence of a severe weather event to analyze and assess the
weather threat. If the SWAT determines the installation is at risk for severe weather, then a
contingent of the SWAT will remain on duty performing enhanced MISSIONWATCH until the
threat has passed. However, if the SWAT determines the installation is not at risk for severe
weather, the weather unit will return to normal operations. The SWAT team is composed of the
SWAT leader (WF NCOIC, Flt/CC, or 30 OSS/DO) and any other weather personnel deemed
essential by the SWAT leader. SWAT duties correlate to Duty Priority 5, “Issue weather
warnings and advisories locally” (Table 1.2). During emergencies, the WF follows procedures
outlined in the Emergency Action Binder.

7.6. Severe Weather Reporting. After an occurrence of severe weather (winds 50 knots or
greater, hail 3/4 inch or greater, or tornado), the weather unit will report the following items to
30 SW/CP: the actual severe weather conditions experienced; the forecast valid at the time of
the occurrence to include any watches or warnings issued; and the operational status of
meteorological equipment at the time of the event. If there is damage to Air Force property that
rises to DoD, AF or MAJCOM interests 30 SW/CP will report the severe weather occurrence on
Vandenberg AFB in accordance with OPREP-3 reporting procedures in AFMAN 10-206 and
AFI 10-229.

                                     SPACE WEATHER

8.1. General: The foundation for information dominance lies in effective, secure military
communications. Unfortunately, both space and terrestrial weather environments can degrade
military communication systems. One of the objectives of the Air Force Weather Agency
(AFWA) is to provide analysis and forecast products that provide military communicators and
end users with a single picture of potential environmental effects that may impact their systems.
Several Vandenberg platforms are affected by space weather and could delay or scrub a
launch/recovery.
8.2. Responsibility.
   8.2.1. WF responsibilities concerning space weather:
       8.2.1.1. Identify those units and operations, within its purview, that may be affected by
       space weather events and should receive space weather support and interpret, apply, and
       tailor the AFWA and other space products to provide mission-enhancing data to their
       supported agencies.
       8.2.1.2. Interpret, apply and tailor existing products for the appropriate supported
       agencies. The WF will interpret space weather products and then extract the relevant data
       and information and apply it for their supported agencies operations.
       8.2.1.3. Submit any known space weather impacts within launch area to AFWA via the
       Space Weather Impact Debriefing and Assessment Form located on JAAWIN.
       8.2.1.4. Be knowledgeable of the AFWA space weather products built around six
       categories of missions/systems adversely affected by space weather.
       8.2.1.5. Be aware of these space weather products and determine their utility to other
       supported agencies. If existing products do not meet supported agencies needs, requests
       for new products may be submitted through AFWA to meet requirements.
       8.2.1.6. Supported agencies will review solar impacts and contact the WF about their
       requirements.
8.3. Space Weather Events: (see Figure 8.1 AFWA space forecast product).
   8.3.1. There are three space weather events that could cause impacts to operations:
       8.3.1.1. Solar Activity: Occurrence of moderate or greater x-ray flares and significant
       solar radio bursts.
       8.3.1.2. Charged Particle Environment:       Occur due to solar events or enhanced
       geomagnetic activity.
       8.3.1.3. Geomagnetic Activity: Overall geomagnetic activity level of the Earth’s
       magnetic field.
   8.3.2. There are six space environmental impacts:
       8.3.2.1. High Frequency (HF) communications: Temporary degraded or total loss of HF
       communications. Solar flares usually affect the lower portion of the HF spectrum, but
30SWI15-101 15 MARCH 2013                                                                   37


     can blackout the entire spectrum if sufficiently energetic. Strong geomagnetic activity
     often results in a decrease in the ionosphere’s ability to reflect HF signals.
     8.3.2.2. Ultra High Frequency (UHF) SATCOM: Temporary degraded or total loss of
     UHF SATCOM communications due to changes in the ionosphere and occurs in the high
     latitudes and equatorial region. Strong geomagnetic activity can significantly degrade
     UHF communications.
     8.3.2.3. Satellite Operations/Health: Spacecraft anomalies and degradation of spacecraft
     components due to radiation interference to communication satellite circuits.
     Geomagnetic particles can enhance and accelerate particles in the space environment
     which can cause damage through a discharge, or can damage the satellite through
     collision or by overwhelming or disorienting the satellite’s sensors.
     8.3.2.4. Satellite Object Tracking/Satellite Drag: Space object tracking loss and increase
     drag on low earth orbiting spacecraft. Drag results from the heating or cooling of the
     upper atmosphere due to the changes in the sun’s radiation output, or to geomagnetic
     activity.
     8.3.2.5. High Altitude Flight: Harmful radiation dosage to personnel in high altitude
     operations. This radiation is a product of cosmic rays from outside the solar system as
     well as very high-energy protons occasionally produced by explosive events on the sun.
     8.3.2.6. Radar Interference/Anomalous Returns: Increased interference or false returns
     to sunward and/or pole ward looking radars. Radio frequency bursts from the sun can
     cause interference to radars when the sun is in their field of view. Anomalous returns can
     occur when the geomagnetic activity disturbs the ionosphere.
  8.3.3. There are four general functions that are routinely impacted by space weather:
     8.3.3.1. Navigation Applications.
     8.3.3.2. Intelligence Collection.
     8.3.3.3. Satellite Operations.
     8.3.3.4. Space Tracking.

   9.9.1. Inform the weather observer whenever the airfield wind sensor is changed.
   9.9.2. Inform the weather observer when the active runway is changed.
   9.9.3. Inform the WOC when the JET is inoperative.
   9.9.4. Relay all PIREPs to the RWF.
   9.9.5. Assist the Observer in monitoring weather conditions (perform a CWW) by notifying
   the weather observer of any perceived difference between the observed and reported weather
   conditions which may affect flight safety. The observer will reevaluate the weather
   conditions whenever a reliable source reports weather conditions different from the last
   disseminated observation. Based on this reevaluation and local policy, weather personnel
   will either generate a SPECI observation if the different conditions warrant immediate
   dissemination, or include the differing conditions in the next required METAR or SPECI
   observation if the conditions alone do not warrant immediate dissemination. These
   observations will include but are not limited to:
      9.9.5.1. Location and movement of thunderstorms.
      9.9.5.2. Rapidly deteriorating visibility/tower visibility.
      9.9.5.3. Presence of fog that could hinder an approach and landing of arriving aircraft.
      9.9.5.4. Beginning and ending of precipitation.
      9.9.5.5. Observed lightning.
      9.9.5.6. Report changes in prevailing visibility and sector visibility to the weather
      observer when either prevailing visibility and/or sector visibility is less than 4 statute
      miles and is different from the current observation visibility.
   9.9.6. Provide the airfield observer or RWF with a report of any convective activity in the
   local area.
   9.9.7. If workload and duty priorities permit, monitor the WF PMSV frequency during short-
   term PMSV outages. Per AFMAN 15-129 the forecaster will request the tower to monitor
   the PMSV frequency and relay all requests to the forecaster during short-term PMSV outages
   (normally less than 1 hour). Tower may or may not be able to honor this request.
   9.9.8. Provide WF personnel indoctrination training on local air traffic control facilities and
   capabilities when needed.
9.10. Frontier Control (2 ROPS/DON) will:

   9.10.4. Forward all PIREPS to the RWF. During mission operations, forward PIREPS to the
   LWO in the WCC.
9.11. 30th Space Communications Squadron (30 SCS) will:
   9.11.1. Conduct or arrange maintenance on all airfield weather systems and associated
   circuits. Restoral priorities are dependent on current airfield, mission operations and
   requirements.
   9.11.2. Ensure WF primary and back-up communications are available to meet customer
   specified watch/warning/advisory notification timelines.
   9.11.3. Provide WSR-88D on-site technician support when requested. The LWO will
   determine if the weather dictates the need for an on-site WSR-88D technician just prior to
   going into crew rest for each mission. If the weather forecast is favorable, they will ask that
   the technician be on standby. If the weather forecast is marginal, they will request that a
   WSR-88D technician be out at the radar site when the LWO arrives on duty for the mission.
   The LWO typically arrives on duty for the mission from 6-8 hours prior to the mission.
9.12. 30th Contracting Squadron (30 CONS) will:
   9.12.1. Review, coordinate, and approve all mission requirements when support is provided
   by 30th Space Wing mission support contracts, (e.g., WROCI, ASSC, LOSC, and WSPEC).

                                        Chapter 10

                  DISSEMINATION OF WEATHER INFORMATION

10.1. Weather Data Systems.
   10.1.1. Joint Environmental Toolkit (JET). The JET is used to acquire, process, display,
   and disseminate weather information. JET consists of a central processor located in bldg
   12000, with communications links to AFWA at Offutt AFB NE. Anyone possessing a valid
   JET account within the VAFB firewall can access weather information going to
   https://jetkvbg.vandenberg.af.mil/jetspeed/portal/. JET is used to transmit and receive
   weather observations and forecasts. It is the primary dissemination tool for local weather
   watches, warnings, and advisories. Any supported agency requiring JET access should
   contact the WF NCOIC.
   10.1.2. Integrated Data System 5 (IDS 5). The IDS 5 system displays many types of
   airfield-related information, including weather, to many agencies on base.
10.2. Communication Outages.
   10.2.1. JET External Communications. In the event of a system outage, the WF will
   contact the VAFB NCC and/or JET Helpdesk to troubleshoot and mitigate the problem. In
   the interim, weather data will be retrieved via the Internet, using the JAAWIN or other
   meteorological web pages.
   10.2.2. JET Terminal Outage. In the event a supported agency’s JET access is
   unavailable, the supported agency will notify the WF of the outage and arrange alternate
   support if possible during the outage.
10.3. Telephone Hotlines. Hotlines connect the WOC to other VAFB agencies as listed below.
Agencies must report hotline outages to 30 SCS telephone maintenance.
   10.3.1. 30 SW/CP (Bldg 10577).
   10.3.2. Upper-air Observatory (Bldg 1764).
   10.3.3. AOS (Bldg 1746).
   10.3.4. 30 OSS/OSAA:       Airfield Management Operations Flight Planning Room (Bldg
   1746).
10.4. Closed Circuit Television (CCTV). During WR mission operations, weather information
is routinely disseminated via the VAFB CCTV network.
10.5. Pilot-to-METRO-Service (PMSV). Edwards AFB provides backup PMSV coverage
during extended PMSV outages.
 44                                                         30SWI15-101 15 MARCH 2013


                                        Chapter 11

                   EMERGENCY/CRISIS AND BACK-UP SUPPORT

11.1. General: In the event of an emergency or crisis WF members will follow checklists
outlined in the unit Emergency Action Binder located in the WOC in building 21150. IAW
MOA MET 15-98, the 25th Operational Weather Squadron will provide backup during
catastrophic communication and/or power outages. If neither the Emergency Action Binder nor
MOA MET 15-98 covers the emergency/crisis WF members will follow leadership direction
using the ORM 6-step process outlined in table 5.1.
11.2. Alternate Observation Site (AOS). In the event Bldg 1764 is evacuated, surface
observing support will be conducted from Base Operations, Bldg 1746. Service may be slightly
degraded while the observer is operating from Bldg 1746. There is no alternate upper-air
observing location.
11.3. Alternate Operating Location (AOL). In the event Bldg 21150 is evacuated, forecasting
operations and toxic hazard zone support will be conducted from the WF Surface and Upper-air
Observing Facility, building 1764. All products and services that are produced at the primary
location, Bldg 21150, except PMSV information, can and will be produced at the alternate
location. The quality of forecast products may be slightly degraded while the forecaster is
operating from Bldg 1764 due to lack of access to the Doppler weather radar, local lightning
detection system and locally-saved climatology data. As a backup for the PMSV, Edwards AFB
will be asked to monitor our frequency in order to ensure pilots get needed service.

unrepresentative of the local weather conditions. The following criteria require TAF amendment
when the condition is occurring or is expected to occur for more than 30 minutes and is not
correctly forecasted by the next whole hour. A TAF amendment is also required anytime one of
the following criteria is forecasted to occur but does not occur by the specified hour and is no
longer expected to occur within the next 30 minutes.

                   COLD SPILL TOXIC HAZARD ZONE FORECASTS

A7.1. Potential Hazard Zone (PHZ): The PHZ product is produced and disseminated prior to
an operation in preparation for an accidental spill or unplanned emission. A PHZ has Zone 2 and
3 based upon the current allowable exposure criteria. PHZs issued for N2O4 will also have a
Zone 1 calculated, however not disseminated unless requested. A PHZ is also issued for the
transport of non-rocket propellant, toxic commodities. In this case, only one downwind distance,
taken from DoT Pamphlet 5800.5, is given.
A7.2. Emission Hazard Zone (EHZ): The EHZ is established prior to the planned emission of
toxic propellants into the atmosphere (e.g., tank venting). EHZs are based upon the exposure
criteria values listed in Table 1 of 30SWI 91-106.
A7.3. Operational Hazard Zone (OHZ): This THZ is established following the accidental or
unplanned release of a toxic commodity to the environment. If a PHZ was previously in effect,
the PHZ becomes the OHZ until a new OHZ can be calculated based upon exactly how much
was released to the environment and predicted weather conditions. OHZs are based upon the
Zone 1, 2 and 3 concentration levels, with Zone 1 being the maximum allowable for sensitive
individuals. OHZs are issued at 15 minute intervals for as long as the accident or exercise
scenario exists. Dissemination is via NTFS and other communication systems. For more
detailed information on hazardous material emergency response, see 30 SW Plan 32-4002,
Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT) Emergency Response Plan. NOTE: All wind directions are
with respect to true North.
