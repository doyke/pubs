SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This simplifies the nomination process by limiting nominations to one page using the AF Form
1206, Nomination for Award, (para 2.2); allows commanders to consider elements when writing
package (para 2.4.); changes when the panel will convene from the B Unit Training Assembly
(UTA) to the Primary UTA (para 4.2); and the nomination process (para 2).
1. Objective. Officers are the commissioned leaders of the United States Air Force Reserve.
Many are outstanding in their military and technical performance, as well as in their civilian
profession. The objective of this program is to recognize and honor these outstanding officers
below the grade of colonel who are not commanders. A secondary purpose is to build morale
within the wing, provide career motivation, and improve retention. This instruction identifies the
 2                                                           446AWI36-2802 24 AUGUST 2012


procedures necessary to recognize outstanding officers. The enthusiasm of each commander and
supervisor will determine the success of this program.
2. Nomination Process. Prepare nomination packages as described below:
     2.1. Each Group Commander (AMDS, ASTS and Headquarters (HQ) Staff are considered a
     group for this process) may nominate one field grade and one Company Grade Officer each
     quarter (January-March, April-June, July-September, and October-December).
     2.2. The commander will state in his own words why the nominee should be selected. The
     nomination will be typed using AF Form 1206. Officer Performance Reports (OPR) rules
     and style of writing apply. The Air Force Form 1206 will be limited to a maximum of nine
     lines in the category of leadership/job performance and six lines for other
     accomplishments/significant improvement. In addition, a copy of their current fitness
     assessment must be attached.
     2.3. The commander may consider achievements and/or significant events of the current
     quarter and the previous quarter when nominating an officer.
     2.4. The commander’s justification should consider, but is not limited to the following
     elements:
        2.4.1. Leadership/ Job Performance in Primary Duty.
        2.4.2. Other Accomplishments/Significant Improvements
     2.5. Eligibility Requirements:
        2.5.1. No unexcused absences during the preceding 12 months.

the quarter for which the nominee is being considered (i.e., April, July, October, January).
4. Selection Process:

     Maintenance Group Commander (446 MXG/CC), 446th Mission Support Group Commander
     (446 MSG/CC), and an additional officer in the wing serving in the grade of Colonel. A

     representative (group deputy commander or squadron commander) to attend in their place.
     4.2. The panel of officers will convene on Sunday during the primary UTA in the month
     which follows the quarter under consideration (i.e., April, July, October, January) at 1300 in
