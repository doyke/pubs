     coordinating efforts between engineering, financial management, contracting, testing,
     logistics, and program management functional areas within the program office. “Program
     office” is here defined as any management center where there is an assigned Program
     Manager (PM) managing Acquisition Category (ACAT) IC, II, and III programs, as well as
     non-ACAT efforts.
     2.2. Program Manager.
        2.2.1. The PM will be the decision authority for programs during manufacturing
        activities and execution of the manufacturing process.
        2.2.2. The PM will request adequate resources needed for oversight and support of the
        manufacturing process. Resources will include adequate funding, appropriate physical
        facilities, skilled personnel, and appropriate tools.
        2.2.3. The PM shall assign responsibility and authority for performing the process,
        developing work products, and providing the services of the process. In assigning
        accountability, the PM will ensure the achievement of specified results throughout the
        life of the program. The PM will assign responsibility using detailed job descriptions
        and/or project documents, and ensure designated personnel have documented authority to
        perform the assigned responsibilities.
     2.3. Chief Engineer (CE).
        2.3.1. The CE shares responsibility for the manufacturing process, and will designate a
        Point of Contact (POC) for this process.
        2.3.2. The CE shall manage the Manufacturing Process Plan. The plan, at a minimum,
        will describe the activities, resources, and schedule required to accomplish this process.
        2.3.3. The CE shall monitor and control the manufacturing process ensuring 1) the
        process is performed as planned, 2) the process adheres to the description, 3) the process

  4.11. Ensure Production is Conducted According to Plan.
     4.11.1. The PM shall ensure that manufacturing processes and procedures adhere to the
     approved plan(s) to provide a uniform, quality product with consistent performance. The
     PM shall also ensure that metrics are tracked and reported to maintain insight into the
     manufacturing operations, e.g., actual hours per ship set or lot, realization or efficiency,
     traveled work, cycle time, scrap/rework/repair, cost of quality, process capabilities,
     Manufacturing Review Board (MRB) dispositions, quality escapes, and first pass yields.
     4.11.2. Systems being produced or repaired must be assembled and tested in accordance
     with approved factory processes. Finally, the system must pass the approved factory tests
     prior to sign-off.
     4.11.3. On a periodic basis, the system IPT and associated support agencies, as needed,
     shall discuss appropriate production, retrofit, and repair status, metrics, ongoing failure
     investigations, etc.

     4.11.4. Hardware is tested as it is produced in accordance with documented acceptance
     test procedures, which are maintained under configuration control. Successful testing of
     the system under these procedures ensures that the system meets allocated hardware
     requirements.
     4.11.5. When properly configured, the system is accepted as an end-item which meets all
     performance (including safety, suitability, and effectiveness) and integration
     requirements.
     4.11.6. The program office will accept systems once they have successfully passed top-
     level acceptance testing per the approved plan. AFNWC has delegated government
     acceptance of systems passing systems factory tests to DCMA.
     4.11.7. Once systems are available, the program works with United States Strategic
     Command (USSTRATCOM) and United States Air Force Europe (USAFE) to determine
     the destination for shipping instructions. Typically, once the warfighter has determined
     the receiving location for the system, the program office will accomplish the detailed
     transportation steps.
  4.12. Supply Chain Management.
     4.12.1. The PM shall ensure the establishment and maintenance of a supplier
     management program. This supplier management program shall:

        4.12.1.2. Assure that MRLs at key suppliers support project needs
        4.12.1.3. Assure supplier compliance with requirements
        4.12.1.4. Address risks associated with transferring work between facilities
        4.12.1.5. Identify and manage supplier risks
        4.12.1.6. Establish a process/culture to facilitate continuous improvement throughout
        the supply chain, and continuously assess overall health.
     4.12.2. Site visits shall be performed to ensure process plans are documented and
     followed, and that chosen supplier(s) can perform, with follow-up visits to control
     process drift. Conferences tailored to educating each supplier on their contract, as well as
     the key technical elements of the overall project, are recommended.
     4.12.3. The supply chain management system will ensure clear communication with
     suppliers and sub-vendors. The system will address the numbers and types of inventory
     needed, associated delivery dates and rates of deliveries, the quality of received items,
     cost agreements, and the risks associated with each item.
     4.12.4. Figure 4.2. provides a flow chart summarizing the Supply Chain Management
     program.
