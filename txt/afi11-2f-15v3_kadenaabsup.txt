It applies to 18th Wing (18 WG) and partner/visiting units at Kadena AB. This publication does
not apply to the Air National Guard or US Air Force Reserve units and members. It is a
standalone publication and must be read in conjunction with AFI11-2F-15, Volume 3. Refer
recommended changes and questions about this publication to 18 OG/OGV, the Office of
Primary Responsibility (OPR), using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of
Publication. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication
are maintained in accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Major changes
include the removal of all local F-15 administrative standards and techniques, which have been
2                                                      AFI11-2F-15V3_KADENAABSUP

compiled as the 18OG F-15 Administrative Standards pamphlet. What remains is purely regulatory
in nature, and cannot be briefed “non-standard.” Additionally, this revision incorporates several
recent Flight Crew Information Files (FCIFs) and write-in changes due to local airspace
restructuring. It assumes a working knowledge of many AFIs and relies heavily on AFTTP 3-3,
Volume 4, Combat Aircraft Fundamentals, F-15, for standards.

                            LOCAL OPERATING PROCEDURES

Section 8A–Introduction

8.1. (Added) Scope. This supplement establishes local operating procedures for Kadena AB and
supplements the basic instruction. It applies to pilots who fly 18th Operations Group (18 OG) F-
15s. Most information is specific to Kadena AB. However, when deployed to other locations,
comply with this supplement to the max extent possible, or local guidance, whichever is more
restrictive.

8.2. (Added) Deviations. The 18th Operations Group Commander (18 OG/CC) or his designated
representative may authorize deviations to local procedures specified in this chapter.

8.3. (Added) References. The primary references for F-15 operations are T.O.s 1F-15A-1, 1F-
15A-1-1, 1F-15C-34-1-3, AFTTP 3-1, AFTTP 3-3, AFI 11-214, AFI 11-2F-15V3, and Kadena
AB Instruction (KADENAABI) 13-204, Airfield Operations Instruction. This supplement should
be used in conjunction with the Shogun In-flight Guide, Volume 1, F-15, and Volume 2, F-15
Exercise / Base-X, maintained by 18 OG Standardization and Evaluation (18 OG/OGV).

8.4. (Added) Changes. Submit recommendations for improvements via AF Form 847,
Recommendation for Change of Publication, to 18 OG/OGV.

Section 8B–General Policy

8.5. (Added) 18 OG Standards. Standards provide a common reference for conducting daily
flying operations. Flight leads may deviate from the standards; however, deviations must be
briefed. Refer to the classified 18 OG Tactical Standards for tactical employment and the 18 OG
Admin Standards for administrative guidance.

8.6. (Added) Flight-Duty Period Limitations. Pilots and supervisors of flying (SOF) will
adhere to the Flight-Duty Period (FDP) and minimum pilot rest requirements specified in AFI
11-202, Volume 3, and its PACAF supplement.

8.6.1. (Added) Fighter FDP may be extended to 14 hours for fighter aircraft delivery missions
including transoceanic (re)deployment with the 18th Wing Commander (18 WG/CC) approval as
per PACAF/DO waiver.

8.6.2. (Added) Pilots may fly up to three sorties per day as long as the third sortie lands before
the end of civil twilight.

8.7. (Added) Go/No-Go Procedures. Pilots must be current for Flight Crew Information Files
(FCIFs), Volume I, Sections A, B, C, Safety Read File, Stan/Eval periodic testing requirements,
and Situational Emergency Procedures Training (SEPT) prior to being assigned an aircraft.

8.8. (Added) Situational Emergency Procedure Training (SEPT).

8.8.1. (Added) Accomplish a SEPT each calendar month in accordance with AFI 11-2F-15,
Volume 1. Failure to accomplish by the end of the month will result in grounding until
subsequently completed. Log SEPTs on 18 WG Form 18, Situational Emergency Procedure
Training (SEPT) Card. Maintain the current cards near the squadron operations desk. The
squadron Chief of Stan/Eval (FS/CCV) will retain completed SEPT cards from the previous year.
Squadron project officers should ensure SEPT cards are taken on flying temporary duties
(TDYs).

8.8.2. (Added) SEPT sessions will be accomplished in accordance with the following guidance.
These procedures comply with AFI 11-2F-15, Volume 1, paragraph 4.2.2.

8.8.2.1. (Added) SEPTs should be accomplished one-on-one, or in small flight-sized groups. All
members should participate to the full extent and share equal time responding to emergency
situations. Pilots will develop SEPT scenarios using F-l5 mishaps/incidents as baseline cases.
Special interest items and recent Dash-1 changes should be emphasized.

8.8.2.2. (Added) Pilots will cover the SEPT Topic of the Month during each SEPT session. 18
OG F-15 Stan/Eval (18 OG/OGVEF) will coordinate an annual SEPT Topic of the Month list
every calendar year with squadron commander (SQ/CC) or squadron deputy commander
(SQ/DO). This list will be forwarded to squadron stan/eval shops (CCVs), and included in each
new reprint of the 18 WG Form 18, SEPT Card.

8.8.2.3. (Added) SEPT sessions will include at least one flight lead and will cover at least ten
emergency procedures (EPs). Discuss at least two EPs for each phase of flight during the SEPT
session. At least 5 of 10 EPs must be critical EPs marked with an “*” on the SEPT card. Cover
each EP at least once per half year.

8.8.2.4. (Added) Accomplish at least two SEPTs each half calendar year with an IP or squadron
supervisor to include minimum fuel and emergency divert training.

8.8.2.5. (Added) Pilots will accomplish a minimum of 2 SEPTs in the simulator (SIM) per half
year. These may be accomplished with another pilot or contract instructor at the console. These
simulators can also count toward Air Expeditionary Force (AEF) 20-month cycle Instrument/EP
SIM requirements in accordance with the PACAF F-15C Ready Aircrew Program (RAP) tasking
message. The fact that the SEPT was accomplished in the simulator must be logged on the SEPT
card. An IP/FE administering an SEPT/EP Evaluation (EPE) may satisfy SEPT requirements at
the console.

8.8.3. (Added) G-Awareness Continuation Training. In accordance with AFI 11-2F-15, Volume
1, the squadron will develop a program to ensure an A/A mission tape for each pilot is reviewed
during flight debriefs. Additionally, a flight surgeon, IP, or squadron supervisor will sign the
semiannual flight surgeon/supervisor Anti-G Straining Maneuver on the SEPT form each half.
AFI11-2F-15V3_KADENAABSUP                                                                    5


8.9. (Added) Publications.

8.9.1. (Added) Pilots will carry the following on all flights: T.O.1F-15A-1CL-1, Flight Checklist;
T.O. 1F-15C-34-1-3CL-1, Nonnuclear Weapons Delivery Checklist; Shogun In-Flight Guide,
Volume 1, F-15; Shogun Eagle Driver Supplement; appropriate FLIP: En Route Supplement,
Flight Information Handbook, Volume 1, Volume 2 (with any applicable change notices), and En
Route Charts 3, 4, 5, and 6; and an 18 WG Form 4 (or substitute), F-15 Flight Data, on local
missions. A substitute 18 WG Form 4, as a minimum, must include all information on the front
of the 18 WG Form 4 including Takeoff and Landing Data (TOLD). The 18 WG Form 4 or
substitute will be maintained in the card server on weapons shop mission planning computers. It
will also be available on deployable laptops.

8.9.2. (Added) During Exercises – Shogun In-Flight Guide, Volume 2, F-15 Exercise/Base X.

8.10. (Added) Life Support Equipment.

8.10.1. (Added) Pilots will check their life support equipment thoroughly prior to each flight.
Oxygen and communications connections will be checked on the TTU-529/E Manside Tester.

8.10.2. (Added) Select Pressure Breathing (PBG) on the aircraft oxygen regulator for all flights.

8.10.3. (Added) SQ/CCs will determine survival vest wear policy. Pilots will wear anti-exposure
suits in accordance with AFI11-301V1_18WGSUP, Aircrew Life Support Program, paragraphs
6.4.5.2. through 6.4.5.2.10.

8.11. (Added) Command and Control.

8.11.1. (Added) The SOF, call sign “Shogun 10,” is the direct representative of the 18 OG/CC.
Use the SOF (Shogun 10) frequency (302.5) to communicate with the SOF regarding airfield
status, EPs, weather, alternates, divert fuels, etc.

8.11.2. (Added) Aborts. If a flight member ground aborts, the flight lead may renumber the flight
as required and inform squadron operations. Squadron operations will notify Shogun 10 and
Command Post.

8.11.3. (Added) Single-Ship Policy. Approved local single-ship missions due to airborne fallout
are advanced handling or dedicated instrument sorties. Both require operations supervisor
approval when other F-15s are airborne or squadron commander (SQ/CC) or squadron deputy
commander (SQ/DO) approval when no other F-15s are airborne. SQ/CC,SQ/DO or designated
rep approval is required for single-ship AHC sorties by inexperienced pilots. Single-ship aircraft
will attempt to utilize airspace occupied by other F-15s to the max extent possible and establish
radio contact on area common or C2. Single-ship aircraft will also establish two-way radio
contact with the SOF (Shogun 10) to include area entry, check-in every 30 minutes, and monitor
Ch 10 during RTB. Single-ship off island cross-country flights requires 18 OG/CC or designated
representative approval.
6                                                        AFI11-2F-15V3_KADENAABSUP

8.11.4. (Added) Rescue support is coordinated by the SOF. Day F-15 flying requires any rescue
support be available {33d Rescue Squadron (33 RQS), Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF),
or the Japanese Coast Guard}. Night F-15 flying requires 33 RQS rescue support unless waived
by 18 OG/CC. Normally, the JASDF Southwestern Division Headquarters will be the primary
rescue contact during daytime 18th Wing local flying.

8.11.5. (Added) Cables at Futenma MCAS. During all local single-runway operations or
anticipated dual runway closure during daily operations, the SOF will verify the cable status at
Futenma MCAS.

8.12. (Added) Fuel Requirements.

8.12.1. (Added) VFR Fuel Required. Set area bingos to arrive at the FAF or initial with at least
2,000# (day) and 3,000# (night or single runway ops). Once established in the local VFR or
RADAR pattern, pilots will weigh AFI 11-2F-15, Volume 1, training requirements/currencies,
land times, tower crew training and pattern congestion to continue pattern work or land, but
pilots will land with at least 1,500#.

8.12.2. (Added) IFR Fuel Requirement. Set area bingos (day or night) to arrive at the FAF with
at least the required alternate/divert fuel in accordance with Table 8.1. During IFR conditions,
contact the SOF, as required, for the most current weather information.

Table 8.1. (Added) Fuel Required

                 Airfield Status                           Fuel Required at FAF / Initial
 Day VFR Recoveries – Either Pattern Open                            2,000 #
 Night VFR Recoveries or Single Runway Ops                           3,000 #
 IFR Recoveries – Naha/Futenma Alternate                             3,000 #
 IFR Recoveries – Nyutabaru Alternate                                8,000 #

8.13. (Added) Weather.
8.13.1. (Added) Weather Conditions. The OG/CC, Top 3, or SOF may WX Hold takeoffs. Under
normal circumstances, expect this WX Hold call to come from the SOF, in consultation with the
OG. OG will only cancel flying for the entire wing in extreme cases (Typhoon, impending
contingency, etc.) Based on expected length of WX Hold, individual squadrons (in consultation
with their AMU's) will make the decision to delay or CNX flying. This decision will be from the
SQ/CC or DO, and can be delegated to the Top 3. Under normal circumstances, do not expect
the SOF or OG to cancel flying. Upon making a WX CNX call, Top 3 will notify the acting OG
(IAW "WX Cancel" checklist). When contacting the SOF, command post, etc IAW the SQ WX
Cancel checklist, Top 3s must clarify they are only speaking for the 44/67 FS, not all flying for
the OG.

8.13.2. (Added) Local Wind Limit. Kadena F-15s will not fly training sorties in airspace where
current or forecast surface winds of 40 knots or greater, including gusts, exist. Local F-15 flying
will be canceled if Kadena AB current or forecast surface winds are 40 knots or greater,
including gusts.
AFI11-2F-15V3_KADENAABSUP                                                                    7



8.13.3. (Added) Local Wave Heights Limit. Due to the limited reporting capability of accurate
wave heights in the local flying area, the best information is available on the Kadena Weather
home page Mission Essential Forecasts. The SOF, in conjunction with the 18 OG/CC or his
representative, will use the following wave height guidance to determine suitability for fighter
flying operations. Wave heights 10’ or greater: No local F-15C sorties may be launched unless
waived by the 18 OG/CC.

8.13.4. (Added) On Island Alternates. Do not use Naha as a planned weather alternate if
temporary conditions (including those due to thunderstorms or rain showers) for your estimated
time of arrival (ETA) (+1 hour) are worse than a ceiling of 1,000 feet or 500 feet above the
lowest compatible published landing minimums, whichever is higher, and a visibility of 2 SMs
or 1 SM above the lowest compatible published landing minimum, whichever is higher. This
applies to 18 WG F-15s for local and off-island sorties and is more restrictive than AFI 11-202,
General Flight Rules, Volume 3. The 18 OG/CC or designated representative is the waiver
authority for these more restrictive alternate weather criteria.

8.13.5. (Added) Fighter Index of Thermal Stress (FITS) guidance applies to pilots outside of an
air-conditioned environment. An F-15C with engines running and an operable Environmental
Control System (ECS) is considered an air-conditioned environment. See Attachment 22 for
Fighter Index of Thermal Stress chart.

8.14. (Added) Bird Watch Condition.

8.14.1. (Added) Reference KADENAABI 13-204, Chapter 24.

8.14.1.1. (Added) Bird Watch Condition (BWC) Low. BWC Low is the normal bird condition at
Kadena with no restrictions.

8.14.1.2. (Added) BWC Moderate. Pilots will execute one approach to a full-stop landing.
Formation takeoffs, multiple approaches, formation approaches and formation landings are
prohibited.

8.14.1.3. (Added) BWC Severe. Takeoffs are prohibited unless waived by 18 OG/CC. Landings
also require 18 OG/CC waiver except in an emergency. With coordination with SOF, pilot
should consider landing opposite direction if winds, flock position, bird condition, and cables
allow.

8.14.2. (Added) Pilot Responsibility. Pilots who observe any bird activity which could constitute
a hazard will contact the SOF (Shogun 10), tower, or command post with the following: call
sign, location, altitude, time of sighting, type of bird (if known), number of birds and action of
birds (soaring, nesting, etc.)

Section 8C–Ground Operations

8.15. (Added) Clearances. The primary departures used on local flights are the W-172, W-173,
and W-179 or Hotel 1. Obtain a clearance prior to takeoff. All clearances except Hotel 1 provide
an IFR departure, VFR en route portion, and an IFR recovery. During mission planning, if
weather precludes a VFR breakout below FL200 or within 40 NM, file an 1801 flight plan;
include area entry point and altitude to climb to in the working area.

8.16. (Added) Preflight.

8.16.1. (Added) Step Brief. Qualified operations supervisors will brief, at a minimum, aircraft
tail number, parking location, configuration, maintenance status, airfield status to include
significant Notice to Airmen (NOTAMs), hazards, constraints, weather,
tanker/AWACS/GCI/adversary coordination and status, and overall Operational Risk
Management (ORM). Ops sups will ensure all go-no-go items and currencies have been
reviewed. Step time will allow for a minimum of 10 minutes at the jet for preflight/start ops.

8.16.2. (Added) Aircraft forms will be stowed in the lower gun door prior to starting engines for
all sorties. Ejection seat pins and the canopy jettison pin will be stowed in the map case.

8.16.3. (Added) For cross-country flights or deployment sorties Dash-21 gear [intake covers,
canopy strut, horse blanket (ECS vent cover)] will be tied down in Bay 5 or stowed with
grounding wire and safing pins in the VTR door.

8.16.4. (Added) Mode 4, Have-Quick (HQ), and Fighter Data Link (FDL) will be rotated on the
Zulu date. Pilots must check the aircraft forms to verify the Mode 4 and FDL crypto dates.

8.17. (Added) Ground Operations.

8.17.1. (Added) Ground Abort. Coordinate appropriate aircraft write-ups before stepping to a
spare. If you ground abort two aircraft after starting engines on both, do not start a third aircraft
nor fly the scheduled sortie, unless waived by SQ/CC or SQ/DO or designated representative.
Multiple engine starts, for the purpose of accomplishing redball actions do not constitute an
“abort.” Apply FITS guidance if appropriate.

8.18. (Added) Taxiing.

8.18.1. (Added) Routing. See Figure 8.1.

8.18.1.1. (Added) Runway 5. Upper Fighter Ramp (UFR) to Taxiway Delta is standard for flow
throughs 26-50. Echo to Kilo is standard for flow throughs 1-25. Note: Use caution at Echo near
Golf and the UFR for returning fighters.

8.18.1.2. (Added) Runway 23. Upper Fighter Ramp to Golf via the Northeast Connector is
standard for flow throughs 1-20. Echo to Golf is standard for flow throughs 21-50. If desired,
AFI11-2F-15V3_KADENAABSUP                                                                    9

request Taxiway Echo to Kilo from Ground. Note: Use caution at Echo near Golf and the UFR
for returning fighters.

Figure 8.1. (Added) Taxi Out




8.18.2. (Added) Taxi Spacing. Taxi on the centerline with 300’ spacing. If congestion dictates,
aircraft may stagger with 150’ spacing as they approach and hold short of EOR, the runways, or
are taxiing between the runways. Spacing may be reduced when holding short of or entering the
runway. Do not taxi past vehicles or equipment less than 10’ from wingtips. Objects within 10-
24’ require a wing walker. The dashed yellow lines in the Upper Fighter Ramp and parking areas
provide 10’ wingtip spacing and may be used in lieu of a wing walker (if taxiing on the yellow
line). The solid yellow lines on taxiways do not provide wingtip clearance. Therefore, do not taxi
past vehicles or equipment on taxiway shoulders with less than 25’ clearance or a wing walker.

8.18.3. (Added) Maximum Taxi Speed. 25 knots; 10 knots on the Upper Fighter Ramp or while
making sharp turns. CAUTION: When using Taxiways D and E, the significant slope
requires speed management that allows time for action should brakes or nose-wheel
steering fail.

8.19. (Added) Before Takeoff.

8.19.1. (Added) EOR. F-15s will arm and quick check before all flights. Upon entering the
arming area, park in the available position farthest from the runway with the flight echeloned
10                                                       AFI11-2F-15V3_KADENAABSUP

toward the runway (see Figure 8.2.). Both runways have four arming locations, with overflow
spots as depicted in Figure 8.2. Flight leads will make a 2-minute call before takeoff on Ground
frequency.

Figure 8.2. (Added) Arming Areas




Section 8D–Flying Operations

8.20. (Added) Takeoff.

8.20.1. (Added) Line-up in accordance with AFTTP 3-3.

8.20.2. (Added) Single-ship rolling takeoffs are authorized as required. Pilots will verify safe
arming and configuration prior to takeoff by ensuring no streamers, pins or covers are installed in
any aircraft in the formation.

8.20.3. (Added) Noise Abatement Procedures. Noise abatement procedures will not be used in
IMC or during syllabus directed radar trail departures conducted in VMC. Pilots will maintain at
or below 1,300 if directed by tower.

8.20.3.1. (Added) Single-Ship. Climb at 250 KIAS until 3,000 ft MSL then accelerate to normal
climb speed. For afterburner takeoffs, cancel AB prior to the end of the runway or as soon as
safety dictates.

8.20.3.2. (Added) Formation. Climb at 300 KIAS until 3,000 ft MSL then accelerate to normal
climb speed. For afterburner takeoffs, cancel AB prior to the end of the runway or as soon as
practical.

8.20.3.3. (Added) Unrestricted Climbs. Request unrestricted climbs on initial call to clearance
delivery with desired altitude. Unrestricted climbs will only be accomplished on Functional
Check Flight (FCF)/ incentive / orientation flights unless an operational need exists.
AFI11-2F-15V3_KADENAABSUP                                                                   11

8.20.4. (Added) Always use the runway with operational departure end barriers. CAUTION:
During Cable Bird launch and recovery operations, both approach and departure end
barriers will be removed from the inside runway (05R/23L) from 10 minutes prior until 15
minutes after the launch or recovery operation.

8.21. (Added) In-Flight Procedures.

8.21.1. (Added) Departure. If on a Whiskey departure (W172, 173, 179) and unable to reach
VMC by 40 DME to cancel IFR, remain within 40 DME and advise Radar Approach Control
(RAPCON). Flights can obtain vectors or clearance to climb, or request to proceed direct to a
holding fix and enter holding. Consider filing a Hotel 1 flight plan if WX precludes transition to
VFR prior to airspace entry.

8.21.1.1. (Added) Trail Departures. Spacing between aircraft will normally be 12,000’ trail. The
lead aircraft will squawk Mode 3/C as assigned by ATC, and the trail aircraft squawks Mode 3/C
5300.

8.21.2. (Added) Systems Check. Accomplish above 5,000’ in accordance with AFTTP 3-3,
Volume 4.

8.21.3. (Added) G-Awareness Exercise. Brief and fly the G-Awareness Exercise on all missions,
day or night, with or without NVGs, when tactical maneuvering is planned to exceed 5 Gs.
Accomplish above 5,000’ in accordance with AFTTP 3-3, Volume 4 and AFI 11-2F-15, Volume
3.

8.21.4. (Added) F-15 2-Tank Maneuvering Limitations.

8.21.4.1. (Added) A pilot may transition from limited to unlimited maneuvering during an
engagement after the external wing tanks are empty and making a “Tanks Dry” call.

8.21.4.2. (Added) Avoid spiking the AOA below 10,000 AGL/AWL.

8.21.4.3. (Added) BFM missions for aircraft with 2 wing tanks will be limited to long range
perch BFM setups (9/12K’), high aspect/neutral BFM, or beyond visual range (BVR) all aspect
missile defense setups.

8.21.5. (Added) Imbalances. Wingman will inform flight leads of any fuel imbalance of 500lbs
or greater.

8.21.6. (Added) Air Refueling Procedures. See Attachment 18.

8.22. (Added) Kadena Airspace.

8.22.1. (Added) Airspace. The local flying area is all airspace within 200 NM of Kadena. The
air-to-air warning areas include W172, W173, W179, and W185. Mobile 9 and Shovel are
altitude reservations (ALTRVs) normally extending from 5,500’ AGL to FL 400 (flight leads
will check the daily schedule for exact ALTRV altitudes and times). Reference the Shogun In-
flight Guide, Volume 1, for area depiction, and frequencies. Okinawa RAPCON controls the
airspace within 50 NM of Naha from ground level up to and including FL 200, and a 30 NM
radius of Kume-Jima (N2620 E12645) from 700’ AGL to 5,000’ MSL. Kadena AB lies within
the Okinawa Class B airspace, which extends 30 NM from the Naha VORTAC, up to 10,000’
MSL. Radar sequencing and separation service are in effect for aircraft within the Class B
airspace. Do not enter the Okinawa Class B airspace without clearance from RAPCON.

8.22.2. (Added) Fly VFR hemispheric altitudes to and from the areas when operating VFR.

8.22.3. (Added) Supersonic Flight. 18 OG F-15s will limit supersonic operations to overwater
training areas and greater than 15 NM from any land. Additionally, avoid supersonic flight
within 5,000’ or 5 NM of rotary wing aircraft and known surface vessels. Report supersonic
flight within 15 NM of land on the AF Form 121, Sonic Boom Log.
AFI11-2F-15V3_KADENAABSUP                                                                13


Figure 8.3. (Added) Okinawa Airspace Overview




8.22.4. (Added) Restrictions. Avoid using AB and low altitude over flight of inhabited areas
below 2,000 AGL over any island within the Ryukyuan chain (exceptions: safety of flight and
approved tactical ranges). Avoid Aguni Shima (N2635 E12713) by 1 NM.

8.22.5. (Added) Maritime Operations (MAROPS). Without specific coordination and
clearance, avoid aircraft carriers by 20 NM below 5,000’ AWL. Avoid fishing and merchant
ships by 1 NM.

8.22.6. (Added) Altimeter Settings. Use 29.92 above the transition altitude (FL 140) to and
from the airspace, and during AAR. Use last known local altimeter setting during area work to
ensure minimum altitude clearances in accordance with AFI 11-214. Upon entering the area,
C2/flight leads/mission commanders will pass the local altimeter setting. Wingmen acknowledge
in turn.

8.22.7. (Added) When not being vectored by RAPCON, and safety permitting, avoid civilian
airliners by 10 NM and 5,000’ to preclude setting off Traffic Collision Avoidance System
(TCAS).

8.22.8. (Added) Battle Damage Check. Required after all day flights where maneuvering
occurred.
14                                                         AFI11-2F-15V3_KADENAABSUP


8.23. (Added) Recoveries.

8.23.1. (Added) Flight leads squawk assigned recovery code prior to departing area boundaries,
wingmen squawk standby. When exiting W173 to the west, use caution near the KAD 059°
Radial due to Naha departures and recoveries. VFR cloud clearances permitting, fighter aircraft
recovering to Kadena will be at the reporting fixes (UKIKA, ZIDEN, OTIMI, ELSOL, JUMTI)
at the in-flight guide depicted altitude for the Whiskey recoveries with fuel to fly the recovery as
shown. Contact Okinawa RAPCON 50 DME from Kadena (NLT Class B airspace boundary)
with call sign, ATIS and recovery intentions (W-17x to initial, tactical initial, high initial or
instrument approach).

8.23.2. (Added) If unable to maintain VFR at the depicted recovery altitude, or for F-15s wishing
to recover to Kadena via other than the Whiskey recoveries (simulated min fuel recovery, for
instance), coordinate with RAPCON well prior to 35 DME.

8.23.3. (Added) All aircraft must obtain an ATC clearance to operate in Okinawa’s Class B
airspace. Fighter aircraft from Kadena AB are automatically cleared to enter the Class B airspace
upon radar identification and initial control instruction. Aircraft are still considered VFR until an
IFR clearance is issued by ATC. Do not mistake VFR sequencing instructions for an IFR
clearance. Upon initial contact during RTB, Okinawa approach will use the phrase “Maintain
VFR,” or issue an IFR clearance by stating “Cleared to Kadena via....” (Example: “Cock 01
radar contact. Maintain VFR, procede direct initial, descend and maintain 2,500’.” Or: “Bat
01, cleared to Kadena via radar vectors. Fly heading 230,descend and maintain 6000’.)

8.23.4. (Added) Kadena Overhead Open. Standard recovery is W-17x recovery, followed by
further clearance direct to high initial from Kadena arrival.

8.23.5. (Added) Kadena Overhead Closed. The standard IFR recovery is a W-17x trail
recovery or a Hotel 1to an ILS final to the outside runway (5L/23R). Fly the trail recovery in
accordance with AFTTP 3-3, Volume 4, and AFI 11-2F-15, Volume 3.

8.23.6. (Added) Position Reporting. Kadena ATC controllers will give instructions in
approximate distance measuring equipment (DME) range. When instructed to report a specific
pattern position (“Shogun 1, Report 5 DME Final”), pilots will report position in DME.
(“Shogun 1, 5 DME”)

8.23.7. (Added) Traffic Pattern. The overhead pattern closes at the end of civil twilight.
Multiple approaches may be flown until the end of civil twilight for day flying and flown until
2200L for approved night flying. For weekend recoveries, plan for one full stop approach.
Multiple approaches and overhead patterns on weekends or holidays require 18 OG/ CC or
designated representative approval. See Figure 8.4. and Figure 8.5. Reference KADENAABI
13-204 and the Shogun In-flight Guide, Volume 1, for more information.
AFI11-2F-15V3_KADENAABSUP                                                                15


Figure 8.4. (Added) Traffic Pattern




8.23.7.1. (Added) Pattern Entry. Fly to initial at 300 KIAS and 2,500’ MSL. At 5 DME,
descend to 1,800’ MSL and turn to line up with the inside runway (05R/23L) unless otherwise
directed by tower. Proceed to 3 DME initial and call “C/S, Initial, Full Stop/Low Approach.”
Break towards the Tower (to the southeast) for any runway. Report base with intentions and
landing runway. “C/S, Base, Gear Down, Full Stop/Low Approach, Left/Right.”

Figure 8.5. (Added) Noise Abatement




8.23.7.2. (Added) Straight-In. Descend to 1,300' MSL when directed by Kadena arrival or
Kadena Tower and proceed direct to a 5 DME final. Report gear down with intentions. "C/S, 5
DME, Gear Down, Full Stop/Low Approach." Avoid Futenma Class D (extends up to 2,000')
unless given clearance from Kadena arrival.

8.23.7.3. (Added) Closed Pattern. Request closed with intentions. "C/S, Request Closed, Full
Stop/Low Approach." If approved, maintain at or below 1,300' MSL until departure end and pull
16                                                         AFI11-2F-15V3_KADENAABSUP

closed at the end of the runway. If delayed (Runway 23), pull closed feet wet to avoid noise
sensitive areas. Midfield and present position closed patterns are authorized if approved by the
tower.

8.23.7.4. (Added) Re-Entry to Initial. If closed traffic is not desired, call “C/S, Re-Enter”
“Yomitan /Koza.”

8.23.7.5. (Added) Yomitan. On departure, call “C/S, Re-Enter Yomitan.” Climb runway
heading to 2,000’ MSL (maintain at or below 1,300’ MSL until past departure end), turn to
heading 320 and continue climb to 2,500’ MSL. Proceed to and report Yomitan airfield. “C/S,
Yomitan, Initial.” Continue southwest (Runway 05) / northeast bound (Runway 23) until abeam
3 DME initial, then turn direct initial and descend to 1,800’ MSL. When lined up with the
runway, report “C/S, Initial Full Stop / Low Approach”. Remain within 4.3 DME of Kadena.

8.23.7.5.1. (Added) Holding at Yomitan. If holding with tower at Yomitan is desired to check
an abnormal configuration or another emergency procedure, initiate a turn towards the field at
2,500’ after coordination with tower for potential traffic conflicts. At all times, remain within 4.3
DME to avoid the approach corridor to NAHA.

8.23.7.6. (Added) Koza. On departure, call “C/S, Re-Enter Koza.” Climb runway heading to at
least 2,000’ MSL (maintain below 1,300’ MSL until past departure end), turn to heading 140°
and climb to 2,500’ MSL. Proceed to Koza (KAD 140/2.5) and report “C/S, Koza, Initial.”
Continue southwest (Runway 05) / northeast bound (Runway 23) until abeam 3 DME initial,
then turn direct initial. Remain within 4.3 DME of Kadena. This pattern over flies the
Futenma Class D (extends up to 2,000’). Therefore, delay your descent to 1,800’ MSL until
turning to line up with the runway at 3 DME initial.

8.23.7.7. (Added) Pattern Straight-In. On departure, call “C/S, Yomitan Straight-In.” Once
approved, maintain 1,300’ MSL until established on a 3-4 NM normal glide path. Remain within
4.3 DME of KAD. Note: Straight-ins from Koza are not authorized.

8.23.7.8. (Added) Tactical Initial. Flight leads fly to 3 DME initial on the inside runway
(05R/23L) at 350 KIAS. (3&4 fly 1-mile trail). Wingmen fly tactical formation at 3,000’ not to
exceed the confines of Kadena AB. Lead pitches out normally, two pitches simultaneously with
lead, pauses at 90° (belly check) and continues to normal spacing on downwind using power and
G as required. Three delays break to roll out in trail with two. Second element follows the same
procedures as the lead element.

8.23.7.9. (Added) High Initial (Primary VFR recovery). Flight leads fly to initial on the inside
runway (05R/23L) at 400 KIAS up to 6,000’ MSL. (#3 & 4 fly 1-mile trail.) Wingmen fly
tactical formation at 3,000’ not to exceed the confines of Kadena AB. Lead executes a
descending break to arrive on downwind at 1,800’ MSL. Two pitches simultaneously with lead
in a descending break, pauses at 90° (belly check) and continues to normal spacing on downwind
using power and G as required. Three delays break to roll out in trail with two. Second element
follows the same procedures as the lead element. If unable to break due to conflict, flight leads
AFI11-2F-15V3_KADENAABSUP                                                                      17

turn to Yomitan/Koza (wingmen fluid in turn), descend to 2,500’ MSL once deconfliction
ensured and re-enter initial.

8.23.8. (Added) Nonstandard Trail. Flight leads should consider radar status, experience level,
fuel remaining, weather categories, etc. when determining who leads the radar trail formation
and landing order. Spacing between aircraft will normally be 12,000’ trail. The lead aircraft will
squawk Mode 3/C as assigned and the trail aircraft squawks Mode 3/C 5300. ASR and PAR
approaches are not authorized with radar trail recoveries.

8.23.8.1. (Added) Flight leads send wingmen to trail via a radio call after confirming wingmen’s
good radar and NAVAIDS. Wingmen lock and call “C.S. Tied” on the Aux.

8.23.9. (Added) Split-to-Land. Split-to-land is when a flight in standard formation flies an
instrument approach to one runway then splits one of the element to land on the other runway.
This option is a circling approach for the aircraft that offsets (circles) to the other runway, and
therefore, cannot be executed from a precision approach.

8.23.10. (Added) Transition-to-Land. Transition-to-land is when an aircraft flies an instrument
approach to one runway then offsets (circles or side-steps) to land on the other runway.

8.23.11. (Added) For both split-to-land and transition-to-land make the request on initial contact
with RAPCON. Do not begin the split or transition maneuver prior to the FAF. Use circling
MDA and missed approach procedures. Only one aircraft may low approach back to radar (one
to tower and one to radar is acceptable). Aircraft executing a low approach to radar should fly the
approach to the outside runway (5L/ 23R) to avoid conflict at the departure end of the runway.

8.23.12. (Added) Multiple Radar Patterns. Expect Kadena standard radar climb-out: Remain at
or below 1,300’ until departure end. Turn to 360° no later than 2 DME and climb to maintain
3,000’. Advise tower when executing climb-out, and expect push to RAPCON for further
vectors. See Figure 8.4.

8.23.13. (Added) Off-Station Approaches. Practice approaches at Naha require USFJ
coordination and approval. Practice approaches at Futenma are not allowed without prior
coordination/approval from Futenma base operations, due to noise abatement procedures.

8.24. (Added) Landing.

8.24.1. (Added) Minimum Spacing. 3,000’ behind other F-15s; 6,000’ for night landings,
landings with runway condition reading (RCR) less than 16 (wet), or behind dissimilar fighter
type aircraft (unless within the same formation). Full runway spacing is required behind non-
fighter type aircraft. If a go-around is required, do not directly overfly aircraft on the runway.
CAUTION: The runway approach and departure ends are exceptionally slick during wet
weather due to rubber buildup.
18                                                       AFI11-2F-15V3_KADENAABSUP


8.25. (Added) After Landing.

8.25.1. (Added) All F-15s will de-arm after flight. Park in the de-arm position farthest from the
runway with the flight echelon toward the runway. Normally, aircraft will taxi back to the chocks
immediately after de-arm is complete as a single ship. Taxi toward the runway before looping
behind others in de-arm to limit jet blast and FOD.

8.25.2. (Added) If de-arm is full, hold between the runways (RWY 23 Active) or park 45° to the
taxiway until there is an open spot (RWY 5 active). Note: leave sufficient room for others to taxi
to parking. See Figure 8.2.

8.25.3. (Added) Call ground for clearance to taxi to parking or hot pits. Include “…via Wash
Rack”. If using the fighter freshwater rinse facility. See paragraph 8.25.5. for wash rack
procedures.

8.25.4. (Added) Taxi Back. See Figure 8.6.

Figure 8.6. (Added) Taxi Back




8.25.5. (Added) Fighter Wash Rack. F-15s will use the Fighter Wash Rack after the last flight
of the day, to the max extent practical. The Wash Rack can accommodate a single 4 ship every
AFI11-2F-15V3_KADENAABSUP                                                                  19

20 minutes (for system recharge). A NOTAM will be issued when the Fighter Wash Rack is
unavailable. After de-arm, request taxi clearance with ground prior to proceeding, and be vigilant
for taxi conflicts. See Figure 8.7. for procedures and taxi flow.

Figure 8.7. (Added) Fighter Wash Rack Procedures




8.26. (Added) Maintenance Debrief.

8.26.1. (Added) Prior to maintenance debrief, pilots will check 8 MM tapes to ensure the system
operated properly. Write-up malfunctions and poor picture quality. Debrief all flight and ground
aborts in maintenance debrief section. Maintenance codes for aircraft are as follows:

8.26.2. (Added) Code 1. Aircraft flyable with no discrepancies.

8.26.3. (Added) Code 2. Aircraft flyable and capable of further mission assignment with normal
turnaround time. However, the aircraft has minor discrepancies or partially inoperative systems.
Operations superintendents will coordinate with maintenance supervisors to determine suitability
of Code 2 aircraft to fly subsequent training missions.

8.26.4. (Added) Code 3. Aircraft or aircraft system has major discrepancies that may require
repair/ replacement prior to further mission assignment, or major discrepancies with tactical
systems render the aircraft non-fully mission capable (Non-FMC).

8.27. (Added) GCI/AWACS.

8.27.1. (Added) Efforts should be made by flight leads to coordinate a phone or face-to-face brief
(day prior) / debrief (post-flight) with GCI/AWACS controllers. At a minimum, fax data card
20                                                        AFI11-2F-15V3_KADENAABSUP

prior to flight and flight critique post flight. Brief and use Have Quick and secure voice on every
mission with AWACS if able. IMC intercepts (day or night) require GCI/AWACS.
GCI/AWACS cannot approve extensions or schedule changes to the range period. Coordinate
range extensions through GCI/AWACS with squadron operations. The following control
agencies are available:

8.27.2. (Added) JASDF. Operates continuously, monitors 276.3 and is available for flight
following. The Sector Operations Center is “RODERICK.” Primary sites include “HARRIER”
(west), “READMIT” (northeast), and “ZEPPELIN” (all others).

8.27.3. (Added) USAF. The 623d Air Control Flight (623 ACF) call sign “LIGHTSWORD”
operates from a joint USAF/JASDF facility at Naha (Kadena 634-2366/Fax 634-5519, Naha
637-7439/Fax 637-7429).

8.27.4. (Added) USMC. “VICE SQUAD” is available only for missions as reflected in the 18
OG weekly flying schedule. Coordinate 24 hours in advance to add/cancel scheduled sorties
(636-2234/Fax 636-3414).

8.27.5. (Added) 961st Airborne Air Control Squadron. Coordinate with “COWBOY” the day
before the mission or with a ground liaison officer (GLO) the morning of the mission. Use the
pre-briefed frequency or COWBOY’s common frequency (233.1) for airborne contact (634-
8111/Fax 634-8114).

8.27.5.1. (Added) When AWACS’s primary radar is “bent,” control using the IFF system, if
authorized by the E-3 mission crew commander, may be possible. To ensure that controlled
aircraft understand the situation, weapons directors will transmit on initial contact “COWBOY is
IFF only, provide own separation from strangers.” F-15 pilots will acknowledge with, “Copy,
IFF only.” The controller can only see squawking aircraft. During the mission, controllers can
transmit applicable tactical information including bogey dope and picture calls; however, snaps
and vectors are advisory in nature. F-15 pilots must ensure safe separation from strangers prior to
accepting directive calls from the controller.

8.27.6. (Added) If traffic advisories are desired when clear of the Okinawa Class B airspace and
VFR, advise approach control and remain on Okinawa approach control’s frequency. If flight
following is desired when clear of Okinawa approach control’s airspace (50 NM radius from
Naha, up to FL 200), attempt contact with the appropriate agency on GCI common or the pre-
briefed frequency. Traffic advisories will be provided to the maximum extent practical.
Additionally, monitor the working area common frequency when practical. GCI/AWACS may
not have both entering and exiting flights on the same frequency. Check-out with GCI/AWACS
when area work is completed.

8.28. (Added) Night Procedures. A night phase brief will be given to all pilots prior to night
employment per the squadron’s training plan.
AFI11-2F-15V3_KADENAABSUP                                                                     21

8.28.1. (Added) Aircraft Required Lighting. Aircraft lighting will be in accordance with
AFI11-2F-15, Volume 3. In addition, one vertical stabilizer light (either anti-collision or
position) and thelanding light must be operative.

8.28.2. (Added) Night Taxi. Taxi spacing is 300’ on the centerline.

Section 8E–Weapons Employment

8.29. (Added) 8 MM Procedures. Title tapes in accordance with the checklist or exercise spins.
Tape “trigger check” for safe gun. Tape G-Awareness turns for flight lead, supervisor, and/or
flight surgeon review. Tape all air-to-air engagements with the intercom on for Anti-G Straining
Maneuver (AGSM) analysis.

8.31. (Added) ALE-45 (CMD) and ALQ-135 (ICS) Procedures.

8.31.1. (Added) During ground operations, keep the countermeasures dispenser (CMD) off
except when accomplishing the CMD ground bit check. Accomplish this check on Taxiway K
(RWY 05) or Taxiway K/G (RWY 23) and write up any discrepancies after flight. At Kadena,
keep the CMD switch in off until “feet wet” and outside the Class B airspace. If diverting to
Futenma or Naha, attempt to dispense all chaff and flares “feet wet” greater than 10 miles from
the coast. Off station, follow deployed operating procedures. Regardless of location, chaff
employment is authorized only within warning area boundaries. Chaff employment in W179 is
NOT authorized when winds aloft are reported or forecast to be greater than 50 knots, unless it is
RR-188 chaff.

8.31.2. (Added) To reduce the risk of aircraft collision with expendable countermeasures, the
following restrictions apply: During training, 18 WG fighter aircraft will not dispense/deploy
countermeasures (chaff, flare, or similar decoys – tethered or not) with a known attacking aircraft
within 3,000’ behind the defender. When training with non-18 WG aircraft, the same restriction
is to be applied by the defender and must be briefed as a special instruction. Countermeasure use
is not restricted when approaching high aspect merges.

Section 8F–Abnormal Procedures

8.32. (Added) Abnormal Procedures.

8.32.1. (Added) Unless briefed otherwise, handle in-flight emergencies (IFEs) within elements
and attempt to escort the aircraft with the IFE to landing. Recover via a straight-in ILS / TACAN
or visual approach as required. Notify the appropriate ATC agency as soon as possible. Request
a single-frequency approach (SFA) on Ch 18 (370.2) and coordinate with Shogun 10 as required
on Ch 10 (302.5). Reference the Shogun In-flight Guide, Volume 1 (Pink Pages), for more
information.

8.32.2. (Added) Aborts. Transmit “Call Sign, Aborting” in the aux radio if able. Switch back to
tower and repeat the call adding “Cable, Cable, Cable” if required. Use speed brake as a visual
22                                                       AFI11-2F-15V3_KADENAABSUP

signal. Trailers: Slow speed – abort behind, or high speed – takeoff (consider max AB, but do not
directly overfly aircraft on runway).

8.32.3. (Added) Aircraft Departure From Controlled Flight. After any suspected or actual
departure from controlled flight, discontinue the mission and RTB. Conduct a battle damage
(BD) check (and a flight controllability check if required). Land via straight-in approach with
chase. Inform operations superintendent of the event and save tapes for tape review by squadron
supervision. Write up all departures in AFTO Forms 781 in accordance with T.O. 1F-15A-1-1
procedures and submit a 1-hour report to safety regardless of cause.

8.32.4. (Added) Fuel Dumping. When fuel dumping is required, it will be conducted over water
to the max extent possible, and above 5,000’ AWL.

8.32.5. (Added) Jettison Procedures. Attempt to jettison hung ordnance within the confines of
the weapons delivery range. If outside the confines of the weapons delivery range, proceed
outside 12 NM from land, visually clear the area of surface vessels, and jettison ordnance. In
cases of emergencies which cannot be covered by any of the provisions above, jettison ordnance
in the safest available area at least 1 mile clear of land mass and surface vessels. Use sound
judgment in situations affecting personal safety, as well as the lives and property of others. The
primary method of jettison will be via the selective jettison method.

8.32.6. (Added) Rescue. Aircraft with initial visual on the accident/survivor is the initial on-
scene commander (OSC) until lowest digit flight lead coordinates another OSC and designates
an airborne mission commander (AMC). If AWACS or a KC-135 aircraft are available, they will
become the AMC. If the AMC is an F-15, utilize GCI/AWACS over Shogun-10 aux. The AMC
will be the primary command and control for rescue forces. The OSC will coordinate with
survivor on 243.0 or 282.8 (as required) over GCI/AWACS aux, to communicate with both the
survivor and the AMC. OSC will keep the accident area in sight, mark the position, and relay
information to AMC. If the flight was working autonomously, the OSC should utilize Shogun-10
aux to relay information to any other airborne players. After initial contact with survivor, use
282.8 as primary rescue frequency – only the OSC and survivor should use this frequency.
Rescue forces will take control on arrival. Japan Coast Guard (JCG) or JASDF rescue forces may
arrive on scene using different frequencies. To prevent any conflicts, one radio in the holding
stack should contact RODERICK/LIGHTSWORD on 276.3 to help deconflict with JASDF MU-
2 and CH-46s.

8.32.7. (Added) Controlled Ejection. Reference Dash-1 checklist and Shogun In-flight Guide,
Volume 1. (See Figure 8.8.)

8.32.8. (Added) Emergency/Alternate Airfields. First choice: Futenma. Use Naha if
weather/conditions do not allow landings at Futenma. Consider Ie Shima under dire
circumstances. Reference the Shogun In-flight Guide, Volume 1, for divert procedures.

8.32.9. (Added) Divert Procedures.
AFI11-2F-15V3_KADENAABSUP                                                                   23

8.32.9.1. (Added) Futenma is the primary divert/alternate for normal, local operations. Monitor
Shogun 10 (Ch 10, 302.5) when divert becomes a possibility. Reference Shogun In-flight Guide,
Volume 1, for divert information (airfield description, routing and/or fuel requirements). If
diverting to Futenma, declare an emergency if you have any CMDs remaining.

Figure 8.8. (Added) Controlled Ejection




8.32.9.2. (Added) Figure 8.9. is an example of off-island divert from the Shogun In-flight Guide.
It is not an approach plate so consult FLIP as appropriate. Use it as a quick reference for initial
actions to get to Nyutabaru from the FAF. For example, from Kadena, go 034° for 394 NM,
NHT is CH 97 and the Lat/Long is listed. With 6250# at the FAF, a 2 bag F-15 following the
profile will land with 2000#. Add 200# fuel consumption for every 25 kts headwind. The profile
is from the bingo charts in the Dash-1 checklist and assumes a mil power climb from sea level at
350 KIAS to FL 455 with – 220s, fly .88 Mach en route. The level off block gives a gouge for
how much fuel remains and the fuel flow in pph. A 30-min checkpoint gives another check on all
the same numbers. The descent block is for an idle power, 220 KIAS descent for recovery. There
are also blocks for the airfield diagram and quick reference approach availability and data.

8.32.9.3. (Added) Nyutabaru. Nyutabaru is the primary off-island divert location. Figure 8.9. is
an excerpt from the Shogun In-flight Guide, Volume 1. It is for reference only and pilots should
consult FLIP as appropriate during an actual divert situation. CAUTION: This divert profile
crosses reduced visual separation minimum (RVSM) airspace. F-15s may be capped at
FL250 based on not being RVSM equipped. This restriction adds roughly 1100# to the
calculated divert fuels in the IFG. Therefore, aircraft with more than 8000# at the FAF can
accept a level off prior to optimum cruise altitude. 7000# will be the standard fuel required for
Nyutabaru as the alternate but pilots must fly the minimum fuel profile to arrive at Nyutabaru
with 2000#. Do not hesitate to declare an emergency if ATC does not give the clearance
required to stay on the minimum fuel profile.

AFI11-2F-15V3_KADENAABSUP                                                                    25

8.32.9.3.1. (Added) When accomplishing fuel calculations in the cockpit, remember that use of
Attitude Director Indicator (ADI) mode and fuel flows to determine fuel burned for the time
remaining does not account for the fuel saved (400-600#) in the descent.

8.32.9.3.2. (Added) Jettison at Optimum Cruise Altitude. Jettison external stores over water
as required to ensure safe recovery.

8.32.9.4. (Added) Shimoji Shima is an emergency field only. Shimoji Shima is not normally
used as an alternate because the field has no cables and radar is required to find the FAF.

8.32.9.5. (Added) After landing at the divert airfield, contact the home unit and 18 WG
Command Post with divert location, number of aircraft, and aircraft status. If deployed, contact
squadron supervision at the deployed location.

8.32.10. (Added) NORDO. If blind, proceed in your block to your designated point and hold in
your block VMC if able.. If no one rejoins by joker fuel or the end of area time, RTB in
accordance with Shogun In-flight Guide, Volume 1, procedures and squawk M3 7600. NORDO
aircraft will be escorted to landing as soon as practical. Normally, element integrity will be used
for RTB.

8.32.11. (Added) Hung Ordnance Procedures. There are two types of hung ordnance.
“Category 1” is hung live ordnance (including flares), resulting in a full response by all
applicable agencies. “Category 2” includes hung inert bombs or gun anomalies, resulting in
limited response by all applicable agencies. With hung “Category 1” ordnance, safe switches and
declare an emergency. State your hung ordnance category. Avoid populated areas on RTB and
utilize a chase aircraft. Land from a straight-in approach. A flare is considered “hung” when the
squib fired and the flare is partially ejected and therefore “hung” vice CMD or squib problems
where there is not an attempt to eject the flare.

8.32.11.1. (Added) Canopy Unlocked Procedures. If a canopy unlocked light during flight is
not corrected by Dash-1 procedures, recover the aircraft via hung ordnance Category 2
procedures in the Shogun In-flight Guide Volume 1.

8.32.12. (Added) Engine Anomalies. Accomplish a battle damage check after any engine
anomaly.

8.32.13. (Added) Landing Gear Anomalies. If you do not engage the barrier with a gear
anomaly, stop straight ahead and have the gear pins installed (traffic and runway availability
permitting). Safety permitting, the aircraft may then be taxied or towed to park.

8.32.14. (Added) Barrier Engagements. The standard configuration of barriers at Kadena is all
barriers up except the first approach end cable on the outside runway (5L/23R). On a daily basis,
all barriers will be fully operational.

8.32.14.1. (Added) Practice barrier engagements during Exercises or barrier certifications
required 18 OG/CC or designated representative approval. Practice engagements and
26                                                         AFI11-2F-15V3_KADENAABSUP

certifications must be scheduled and pre-briefed prior to step with the pilot, ops sup, fire chief,
wing safety, airfield management, crash recovery and barrier maintenance. During the
engagement all above players, plus ground control, should coordinate on the SOF (Shogun 10)
frequency (Ch. 10, 302.5). The fire chief is the on-scene commander.

8.32.14.2. (Added) Go through de-arm, engage the barrier toward the longer part of the runway.
Do not accomplish on landing roll. The maximum speed is 100 knots. Following a barrier
engagement, the aircraft will shut down and be towed off of the runway.

8.32.14.3. (Added) Slingshot/power out/rollback barrier extractions are prohibited in accordance
with AFI13-204_PACAFSUP1, Functional Management of Airfield Operations.

8.32.15. (Added) Hot Brakes Procedures. If suspected, confirmed, or abort occurred above 120
knots, inform tower and taxi to hot brake area. Hot brake areas are located in each arm/de-arm
area offset toward the runway, and between flow-through 50 and taxiway Delta on the upper
fighter ramp. Stop with nose of aircraft facing into the wind. Do not shut engines down until
instructed to do so.

8.32.16. (Added) Brake Failures. If a brake failure occurs on the runway, lower the tail hook (if
required), stop straight ahead, advise tower and wait for assistance to shut down.

8.32.17. (Added) Taxi After Emergencies. If any doubt concerning aircraft safety exists, get
chocked, call for a tug and shut down. Coordinate with the SOF (Shogun 10) for further
instruction. Do not taxi aircraft with malfunctions that affect the nose wheel steering or brake
system (hydraulic failures, higher than normal thrust, anti-skid failures).

8.32.18. (Added) Chase Formation. Any pilot may fly safety chase for aircraft under emergency
or impending emergency conditions. Qualified pilots (including MQT pilots who have
successfully completed an instrument/qualification evaluation) may chase as safety observer for
aircraft performing simulated instrument flight or hung ordnance patterns. Specialized missions
(i.e., OT&E, WSEP, live weapons delivery, etc.) and training conducted in accordance with AFI
11-2F-15, F-15--Aircrew Training, Volume 1, may be chased by CMR/BMC pilots designated
by group/squadron commanders. All other chase events may only be flown by IP/FEs or
upgrading IPs under the supervision of an IP. Except IP/FE/specialized missions, a chase aircraft
will maneuver in a 30°-60° cone with nose/tail clearance to 1,000’, to effectively clear and/or
provide assistance. IP/FE/specialized mission aircraft will maneuver as necessary, but must
maintain nose/tail separation until required to transition to close formation when deemed
necessary by the IP/FE. No chase aircraft will stack lower than the lead aircraft when below
1,000’ AGL. All chase aircraft will attempt to fly on the outside of the turn at Kadena during
overhead patterns. The minimum altitude summary is included in the Shogun In-flight Guide,
Volume 1.

8.32.19. (Added) Two/Four Ship Flight Lead Clarification. In accordance with AFI 11-2F-15,
Volume 1, and the 18th Wing F-15 Syllabus, after the successful completion of 2-ship flight lead
syllabus, the 2-ship flight lead is cleared to employ two aircraft in daily training and contingency
operations as well as control a maximum of six aircraft in daily training to orchestrate 2 v 1, 2 v
AFI11-2F-15V3_KADENAABSUP                                                                    27

X, or 2 + 2 v 2 training as required by the operations training plan. After the successful
completion of 4-ship flight lead syllabus, the 4-ship flight lead is cleared to employ four aircraft
in daily training and contingency operations or control a maximum of 10 aircraft in daily training
to orchestrate 4 v X or 4 + 2 v 4 training as required by the operations training plan. Any blue air
employment of more than four aircraft requires the flight lead to complete a mission commander
checkout.

8.33. (Added) F-15 Alternate Missions. See Attachment 19.

8.34. (Added) Cross Country and Deployment Flights.

8.34.1. (Added) Procedures. In accordance with AFI 11-202, Volume 3, PACAF Supplement,
cross country requests are approved by 18 OG/CC or his designated representative. Submit a
cross country request (Attachment 21), approved by SQ/CC, SQ/DO, or Assistant DO to 18
OG/CC not later than 1200L, 10 days prior to departure. Cross country itineraries will be posted
at the squadron and 18 WG Command Post. Once off station, SQ/CC or SQ/DO must approve
deviations from the itinerary. The 18 WG Command Post will be notified of changes to the
itinerary.

8.34.2. (Added) Execution. Conduct flights on IFR flight plans to the maximum extent possible.
Proposed VFR legs must be annotated on the request form and approved by the 18 OG/CC.
Carry at least one copy of flight orders. Wear an anti-exposure suit when required, in accordance
with AFI11-301V1_18WGSUP. Landings must be accomplished before local sunset unless
approved by the 18 OG/ CC. Bases of intended landing must have operational and compatible
instrument approaches and NAVAIDS for anticipated or forecast weather conditions. Comply
with AFI 11-202, Volume 3, takeoff and landing restrictions. JP-4/5/8 single point refueling,
liquid oxygen, and nitrogen service must be available. Ensure the aircraft are equipped with Joint
Oil Analysis Program (JOAP) kits, probe and intake covers, tank and weapons safety pins (if
required), FLIP pubs, and aircraft forms. The gun must be mechanically and electrically safe and
unloaded if manning a static display. Ensure security is adequate. Relay the following to 18th
Wing Command Post prior to takeoff when off station: Tail numbers, call sign, expected takeoff
time, and destination. Upon arrival (not later than 2 hours after landing), pass the following: Tail
numbers, call sign, aircraft status, actual takeoff and landing times, sortie duration flown, next
proposed takeoff time and destination, and point of contact at cross country location. Ensure all
safety and servicing measures are complied with before leaving the aircraft.

8.34.3. (Added) Deployments. Prior to deployments or cross country flights, ensure the flight
planning process includes a thorough study of terrain elevations encountered en route, in the
operating areas, and during the recovery phase. Ensure pilots are aware of, and brief adjusted
controlled and uncontrolled ejection altitudes for all deployment phases and on every deployed
location mission. Non-DoD approaches require HQ PACAF approval. Forward requests for
approval to 18 OG/OGV not later than 30 days prior to intended use. The 18 OG/OGV will
forward to PACAF. Pilots must then confirm approach approval.

8.34.4. (Added) Static Displays. Comply with AFI 11-209. Reference Shogun Eagle Driver
Supplement.

8.34.5. (Added) Flyovers. For all flyovers reference AFI 11-209 for guidance.

8.35. (Added) Hot Turn Operations.

8.35.1. (Added) A “Hot Turn” is refueling the aircraft without shutting down both engines or
doing a through-flight/munitions reload and then flying another sortie. Hot turns are normally
accomplished during surges or exercises. Normally, the crew chief will plug-in with a comm
cord. No more than two hot turns (three flights) may be flown in sequence without a through-
flight inspection.

8.35.2. (Added) Hot Pits. Cursory will normally be accomplished in de-arm after normal checks
are complete. Shut down the #1 engine when directed and taxi single engine to the Hot Pits. Do
not delay for wingmen unless briefed or directed otherwise. Taxi via taxiway Kilo and hold short
of Service Apron 3, if required, for aircraft departing the Hot Pits. Normally, there are 2 or 3 Hot
Pit refueling spots. If they are full, hold on the southwest side of Service Apron 3 with a
maximum of 4 aircraft. When complete, taxi single engine to arming via taxiway Kilo. Taxi
clockwise on Service Apron 3. See Figure 8.10.

8.35.3. (Added) Surge Operations Specifics. See Attachment 20.

8.36. (Added) Chemical Warfare (CW) Sorties. The CW familiarization sortie will normally
be flown in an F-15D aircraft with a CMR/BMC pilot in the back seat as a safety observer,
unless waived by the SQ/CC.

8.37. (Added) Records Management. This publication does not require the collection of
records or privacy act information.

                                    TANKER STANDARDS

A18.1. (Added) Shogun Standard Air Refueling Procedures. These air refueling standards are
for 18th Wing aircraft to air refuel with 909 ARS tankers in any local AR track within 300 NM
of Kadena. Deviations from this standard are permitted. Deviations must be coordinated and
approved by all affected aircrews and controllers and be in compliance with T.O. 1F-15A-1CL-1
and ATP-56(B).

A18.1.1. (Added) VMC refueling should be attempted to the max extent possible.

A18.2. (Added) Preflight Planning. Air refueling specifics will be outlined in the tanker
coordination sheet for daily flying or in the appropriate SPINS/ATO for exercises. The 18 OSS/
OSO is responsible for issuing the tanker coordination sheet for daily 18 WG AAR operations.

A18.2.1. (Added) Tanker Coordination Sheet. The tanker coordination sheet will be issued not
later than 24 hours prior to the scheduled AAR. The normal means of distribution is via e-mail to
the squadron scheduling shops. Changes to the coordination sheet within 24 hours of the
scheduled refueling require voice notification of all affected agencies (909 ARS, 44 FS, 67 FS,
961 AACS, 623 ACF, etc). The coordination sheet will list tanker call signs, number of tankers,
tanker track, tanker altitude, and AAR control and boom frequencies (and backups). The sheet
will also list receivers in chronological order with call signs, number in flight, RVCTs, and initial
track altitude.

A18.2.2. (Added) Altitude Deconfliction. The standard AAR altitude for tankers is FL240 in all
tracks. Tankers operating in formation will stack 500’ above the formation lead; i.e., lead tanker
at FL240, #2 at FL245, etc. Receivers will be assigned initial rendezvous altitudes via the
coordination sheet. Receivers will maintain a minimum of 1,000’ below tanker altitude until
visual or cleared higher by the tanker. Subsequent receivers will be stacked 1,000’ below
preceding flights; i.e., Bat 1, FL230, Demon 1, FL220, Cock 1, FL210. Altitudes may be reused
if separated by time (>40 minutes between RVCTs).

A18.2.3. (Added) Track Arrival. Tankers will enter the track via RVIP. Receivers proceeding to
AAR will initially reference the RVIP. They may proceed direct to the tanker after radio contact
is established and cleared by the tanker lead, GCI, or AWACS. RV Alpha procedures will
normally be used; RV Delta procedures can be utilized if pre-briefed and coordinated with all
parties.

A18.2.4. (Added) Ops Supervision. Squadron operations supervisors will confirm the status of
tankers and/or receivers before stepping aircrew (See paragraph 8.16.1. Step Brief). Each
squadron is responsible for notifying all affected players if there are changes to the plan.
Additionally, the SOF will monitor tankers/receivers and pass any real-time changes to the
affected players as time and conditions permit.
AFI11-2F-15V3_KADENAABSUP                                                                       35

A18.3. (Added) Command and Control. GCI/AWACS should always be scheduled to control
tanker operations in local airspace. Tanker operations can continue if the controlling agency falls
out. The lead tanker aircraft commander has the ultimate authority for conducting AAR.

A18.3.1. (Added) Communications. GCI/AWACS will provide control on AAR rendezvous.
Receivers will contact the boom when directed by GCI/AWACS or the tanker. The standard
AAR rendezvous frequencies are 255.9 primary, 288.0 secondary. The standard air-to-air
TACAN is 81Y for the tankers and 18Y for receivers. Tankers will squawk a Mode 1 of 33.
EMCON 3 is standard. The following table outlines the standard communications plan for local
F-15 AAR.

Table A18.1. (Added) F-15 AAR Communications Plan

Phase                     Frequency R1              Frequency R2              Remarks
Rendezvous                RDZV                      Manual Aux                AWACS/GCI Control

Departing Tanker          RDZV                      Manual Aux                AWACS/CGI Control

A18.3.2.(Added) Rendezvous. LIGHTSWORD or COWBOY will control operations in the air
refueling track and receiver/tanker rendezvous. In the event GCI/AWACS is not available, the
tanker lead will control rendezvous and authorize receivers to proceed down track. All aircraft
will set altimeter to 29.92. At initial contact with GCI/AWACS (on RDVZ) or the tanker lead
(on Boom/AAR PRI), receivers will transmit altitude, Mode 3 squawk, and weapons status
(“Cock 1, Flight Level 2-3-0, Mode 3 53XX, noses cold”).

A18.3.2.1. (Added) Rendezvous Under GCI/AWACS Control. GCI/AWACS, in coordination
with the tanker lead, will direct receivers to the appropriate tanker. Receivers should contact
GCI/AWACS as soon as possible, but no later than 5 minutes prior to arriving at the RVIP. If
already working with GCI/AWACS in the warning areas, receivers will change frequencies as
directed by the controller. Receivers will initially set altitudes outlined in the tanker coordination
sheet. GCI may redirect the receivers to different altitudes to effect the rejoin and/or manage
multiple receiver flights. It is important that GCI/AWACS maintains positive control over
rendezvous operations in coordination with the tanker lead. Receivers not on time for their
scheduled RVCT may have to cancel AAR.

A18.3.2.2. (Added) Rendezvous Without GCI/AWACS Control. Receivers may conduct AAR
operations without GCI/AWACS control. In this case, receivers must adhere to the times and
altitudes outlined on the tanker coordination sheet until in radio contact with the tanker lead.
Initially, receivers will proceed toward the RVIP. After establishing radio contact with the tanker
on AAR (boom) primary, they may proceed directly to the tanker with approval from the tanker
lead. All receivers must be on the common AAR (boom) primary frequency for deconfliction.
The tanker lead has the ultimate authority to control the flow of receivers to and from the
rendezvous.

A18.3.2.3. (Added) RVIP Procedures. Receivers arriving at the RVIP and not cleared down
track by the tanker or GCI will hold at the RVIP at their assigned coordination sheet altitude or
36                                                        AFI11-2F-15V3_KADENAABSUP

as directed by GCI. If unable to hold at the RVIP (i.e., fuel, weather, etc), receivers should cancel
their AAR and proceed with alternate missions or RTB, as appropriate. Receivers will fuel plan
to have enough gas to proceed from the working airspace to the RVIP, rejoin with the tanker, and
maintain recovery fuel if unable to refuel. No more than three flights (eight aircraft maximum)
should be rejoined with one tanker at a time. Flights may maintain a trail position with altitude
deconfliction if authorized by the tanker lead or GCI.

A18.4. (Added) VMC F-15 Refueling Procedures. The first 2-ship joins to the observation
position (left wing); after visually verifying that no refueling is in progress and that the boom is
lowered, the first receiver may join directly astern. The second 2-ship joins to the observation
position, outboard of an awaiting receiver, if applicable. No more than three aircraft will occupy
the observation position. The standard refueling order is 1-2-3-4. Third or subsequent flights will
rejoin to 1 NM sequential trail and move forward when sufficient space is available in the
observation position and cleared by the tanker.

A18.5. (Added) IMC F-15 Refueling Procedures. Rendezvous formation is 2-ships in close
formation or 2 x 2 radar trail (4-ship). From behind the tanker, utilize no more than 50 knots of
closure inside 3 NM and offset 15° left (keep 15° right on VSD). Close for visual contact to
1,500’ slant range (1 NM no lock) while maintaining at least 500’ vertical separation; maximum
rate of closure inside 3,000’ is 10 knots and closure must cease at 1,500’. Join as above once
visual. Subsequent flights will hold in radar trail until sufficient space is available in the
observation position and cleared by the tanker.

A18.6. (Added) Night Procedures. Follow IMC procedures above, even in VMC. Highest digit
receiver keeps anti-collision beacons on for the flight until proceeding to the astern area, widest
digit turns beacons on when highest digit turns beacons off. (i.e., in a 4-ship, 4 has beacons on
and all others are beacons off. The 3 turns beacons on when 4 turns beacons off. When 4 returns
to 3’s wing, 4 turns beacons on and 3 turns beacons off.) KC-135 Lighting (F-15s only): For
single tankers, tanker turns off upper and lower strobes when receiver’s formation is within ½
NM trail and leaves them off until all fighters have departed. For tanker formation, leave upper
strobe on. If no fighters are on the wing, tanker turns on upper and lower strobes in between sets
of fighters until the next formation is within ½ NM.

A18.7. (Added) Departing the AR Track. Receivers will depart the track high. Climb to 1,000’
above the highest aircraft in the air refueling formation before initiating a turn; i.e., in a
formation of two tankers at FL240 and FL 245, receivers will depart at FL 255. Use caution
departing formation refueling ops during IMC. GCI/AWACS will control AR track departures.
In the event GCI/AWACS is not available, the tanker lead will control departure flow.

A18.8. (Added) Emergency Procedures. Handle EPs in accordance with applicable MDS
guidance. Under normal circumstances, do not refuel with an EP or malfunctioning AR system.
If an emergency arises that requires air refueling, coordination between tanker and receiver
aircrew takes priority over all EMCON considerations.

A18.9. (Added) Opportune Air Refueling. Opportune Air Refueling is a plan to help
coordinate real-time air refueling opportunities increasing 18 WG interoperability. Opportune
AFI11-2F-15V3_KADENAABSUP                                                                     37

Air Refueling addresses daily mission changes (i.e., weather, receiver fallout, etc.) where time
does not allow use of the tanker coordination sheet. This includes airborne KC-135s that have
returned to the local area and have offload available. Flight leads will ensure all flight members
are properly briefed on AAR before using Opportune Air Refueling.

A18.9.1. (Added) Shogun In-flight Guide, Volume 1, contains the standard RVIP, RVCP,
altitude, and communications information for all local AR tracks.

A18.9.2. (Added) Tankers requiring receiver aircraft will coordinate through Tiger Ops to
determine if additional receivers are available. Tiger Ops, with 909 ARS/DO approval, will
coordinate directly with 44FS, 67 FS, 961 AACS Ops for receiver availability and 18 OSS/
OSOS for airspace availability and will establish RVCTs.

A18.9.3. (Added) Contact squadron ops sup to set up Opportune Air Refueling. With squadron
ops sup approval, squadron ops personnel will coordinate with 909 ARS Ops to determine tanker
availability. The AR standards in the preceding paragraphs apply. Planned deviations will be
specifically briefed. Receivers conducting Opportune Air Refueling must obtain appropriate
deconfliction before entering the tanker track.

A18.10. (Added) Airspace. AR will be scheduled in local airspace via the tanker coordination
sheet. In the case where aerial refueling and ACBT are being conducted in the same airspace,
18OSS/OSO will assign altitude and/or geographic deconfliction on the daily airspace sheet.
When using altitude as the primary means of deconfliction, there must be a minimum of 2,000’
between floors and ceilings; e.g., Bat in W185 below FL180; AR in W185 above FL200. This
deconfliction plan will also be included on the tanker coordination sheet. Airspace limited by
altitude may restrict the number of flights able to refuel within the same RVCT timeframe.

A18.11. (Added) Contingencies. Any changes to any part of the AAR plan must be
communicated to all players as soon as possible. After aircraft launch (receivers or tankers), the
SOF (or Shogun Control, during exercises/contingencies) via GCI/AWACS will serve as the
focal point for distributing information. Any aircraft that cannot comply with the tanker
coordination sheet for any reason (fallout, weather, etc) will pass alibis to Shogun 10. Shogun 10
will attempt to contact all players affected by the change (flight discrete freqs, LIGHTSWORD,
Tiger Ops, etc). Airborne aircraft and LIGHTSWORD/COWBOY should contact Shogun 10 for
the most current information. Finally, there is no requirement to refuel on any local training
mission. If the weather is bad, GCI is down, the timing is off, or if the air refueling seems forced,
discontinue AAR operations.

                               F-15 ALTERNATE MISSIONS

A19.1. (Added) Alternate missions for F-15s include Instruments, AHC, BFM, ACM, or TI. See
paragraph 8.11.3. for single-ship policy.

A19.1.1. (Added) Alternate missions will be briefed, coordinated, and approved by the Top 3
(Added – Top 3 Alternate Mission Checklist). The flight lead is responsible for ensuring all
participants are aware of any alternate mission that may be flown. At a minimum, cover specific
fallout examples that may arise and the mission type that will result given that fallout.

A19.1.2. (Added) Alternate missions will be less demanding or complex than the primary
mission. Approved missions from the in-flight guide (AHC, BFM, ACM and TI) may qualify as
an alternate mission, assuming they are less demanding or complex than the primary. Examples
follow:

A19.1.2.1. (Added) Example 1. Primary mission is LFE 8vX (Cope Thunder, Red Flag).
Weather precludes launch of adversaries. F-15s decide to fly. A 4v4 Blue vs. Red Tactical
Intercept (TI) mission is acceptable. Blue 1-4 executes with Blue SPINs. Red 1-4 (formerly Blue
5-8) executes with LFE-briefed adversary Red SPINs. Red must have pre-briefed a Red-air
tactic. Limited maneuvering applies.

A19.1.2.2. (Added) Example 2. Primary mission is 4v4 TI. You may fly a 2v4 TI. You can also
fly ACM, BFM, or AHC.

A19.1.2.3. (Added) Example 3. Primary mission is ACM. You can fly BFM or AHC.

A19.1.2.4. (Added) Example 4. Primary mission is BFM. The only fallout missions you may fly
are AHC or Instruments.

A19.1.3. (Added) During surge / hot pit operations, combining flight members and flexing
between BFM and ACM is allowed to provide for logical flow and to maximize training. All
anticipated missions will be briefed in accordance with A.5, Surge Ops.

A19.1.4. (Added) Use of Spare IPs for MQT, FLUG, and IPUG. The following details IP
fallout options:

A19.1.4.1.(Added) The SQ/DO or higher must concur with the spare IP plan. With SQ/DO
approval, the following situations can be modified on a case by case basis.

A19.1.4.1.1. (Added) BFM. Briefed and flown as scheduled. No mixing/matching of
IP/Students.
AFI11-2F-15V3_KADENAABSUP                                                                    39

A19.1.4.2. (Added) ACM, TI, or ACT missions. There is an option for a Red air pilot to spare
forward into the position of Blue 1 (or Blue 2 in the case of FLUG or IPUG) if Blue 1 falls out.
In order to spare forward, the following provisions must be met:

A19.1.4.2.1. (Added) The Red air pilot must be a qualified IP.

A19.1.4.2.2. (Added) The Red air pilot must be designated prior to and attend the blue air
element brief. Red air coordination for the fallout IP will occur prior to step.

A19.1.4.2.3. (Added) The Red air pilot will review the student’s grade book in advance.

A19.2. (Added) AHC. See the Shogun In-flight Guide, Volume 1, for specific maneuvers.

A19.3.(Added) BFM.

A19.3.1. (Added) General. Load SCL 1. Use modified AIM-9 WEZ for perch BFM, and full-up
AIM-9M/X for High Aspect. Kill Criteria: 2 shots / 1 guns track. No AIM-120-only kills. Missile
shots within the first 5 seconds on a perch setup and pre-merge (neutral setup) shots do not count
towards kills. 5,000’ Floor. 500’ Bubble.

A19.3.2. (Added) BFM Objectives. See Table A20.1.

A19.3.3.(Added) Perch Setups. 18,000’. 4 AA. 6,000’ & 9,000’ Perch: 430 KIAS. 3,000’ Perch:
Defender 375 KIAS; Offender 400 KIAS. Initiate perch setups from line abreast at perch range
plus 3-5,000’. (Use 20,000’, 420 KIAS if floor is set at 10,000’ or higher.) The 2-ship check
turns into the defender. Defender reverses when offender is pure pursuit and turns as required to
maintain 40° angle off tail. Offender maintains pure pursuit and calls ranges and aspect if not
4L/R. The fight is on at the designated range or when the offender calls “Fight’s On.”
Separations are valid at 9,000’ with opening Vc within 1,000’ of the floor.

A19.3.3.1.1 (Added) Combat Perch Setups. 12,000’-18,000’. 4AA. 2.5nm line abreast. Check turn
into defender. Offender calls “2 miles” and any aspect angle other than 4. Defender initiates break
between 2.0 nm and 4000’. Auto fights-on at the defender’s break turn.

  A19.3.4. (Added) High Aspect BFM Setups. 18,000’, >350 KIAS. Start 6-12,000’ line abreast.
  “Turn Away” call means level check turn 45° away from each other, until 4-5nm or “Padlocked”.
  “Fight’s On” means cleared to turn in and maneuver. Separations are valid at 2NM with opening
  Vc within 1,000’ of the floor.

  A19.4. (Added) ACM.

  A19.4.1. (Added) Perch ACM Setups. Element: 16-18,000’, 420-450 KIAS, 1.5-2.0 NM Line
  Abreast. Bandit: 9,000’ (+1,000’) back in 30° cone from the element. See Table A20.2. and
  Table A20.3 for ACM objectives and SPINS.

  A19.4.2. (Added) Cap and Tap ACM. The element stays within 20 NM of the reference point.
  Bandits begin no closer than 20NM to the element. If multiple adversaries, only one bandit
  engaged at a time. See Table A20.2. and Table A20.3. for ACM objectives and SPINS.

  A19.4.3. (Added) Bandits will call “Tally 1 only” on the common frequency and maintain their
  block until tally 2 or a “Continue” call is made from blue air. When calling “Continue”, the
  blue element picks up primary deconfliction responsibility and the bandit is cleared out of his
  block.

                                    SURGE OPERATIONS

A20.1. (Added) This policy establishes operational guidance to ensure safe, efficient F-15 surge
operations. Surges allow for efficient sortie generation. The nature of a surge also carries an
increased risk in comparison to the normal flying schedule. When that risk exceeds an acceptable
level, squadron leadership or the flight lead will call “Knock it off.” The following guidance
applies for surges:

A20.1.1. (Added) The mixing and matching of flight lead and wingmen (in accordance with
current Letter of X’s) is authorized as long as the overall guidance of this policy is met.

A20.1.2. (Added) All flyers will receive the same mass brief. Two or more squadrons desiring
the option of mixing and matching flight leads and wingmen must either brief together in the
same location or receive identical briefings created by wing weapons if briefings are in separate
locations. The intent is to prevent single ship missions when BFM or ACM can be accomplished.
Operations supervisors will use good judgment and coordinate pairings.

A20.1.3. (Added) Primary mission and surge tactical objectives (BFM, ACM, TI, etc.) will be
thoroughly briefed.

A20.1.4. (Added) Mass brief will cover WX, NOTAMS, admin, standard out/back, and TRs.

A20.1.5. (Added) Desired learning objectives and KIO criteria will be thoroughly briefed. Due to
the increased tempo of surge operations, more conservative KIO criteria will be used by flight
leads.

A20.1.6. (Added) There will be a dedicated portion of the mass brief covering all pertinent
tactical phases of flight for the primary mission. The 18 WG and CAF F-15 tactical standards
will be utilized.

A20.1.7. (Added) Red Air options will be briefed and understood. A hard copy of a Red Air
playbook will be available to each pilot for review.

A20.1.8. (Added) MQT students may fly in the surge with the following guidance:

A20.1.9. (Added) The primary option for an MQT student is to brief and fly with a dedicated IP.
MQT students will only fly missions that are commensurate with their progress in the MQT
syllabus (Example: If MQT student is complete with BFM phase and is currently in the ACM
phase, then student can fly BFM or their current MQT ACM Upgrade sortie with the
dedicated/briefed IP. They cannot fly in a TI or ACT mission).

A20.1.10. (Added) However, any IP can fly with any MQT pilot, assuming both attended the
surge brief. If this option is used, the type of mission will reduce to one that the student has
already demonstrated proficiency in. (Example: If MQT student is complete with BFM phase

Components
Notes:
Note 1- Other OPLANS will be FSL unless determined by 18OG/CC.
Note 2- Any reduction in system requirements will be: 1) coordinated with MX to ensure the
capability of correction is available at the intended destination and 2) coordinated with Tactical
Command and Control to ensure the deployment aircraft with a reduced MESL will not be rolled
into a combat sortie. If the requirement to fly a combat sortie exists and cannot be waived, or the
parts/capability for a MX solution does not exist at or enroute to the deployed base, before the
aircraft will be required to fly a combat sortie then the OPLAN column requirement drive the
MESL.
Note 3- Only need 1 UHF radio for deployment/Local training.
Note 4- One operational KY radio required per four ship.
Note 5- All Eight (8) Aim-120 & (4)/Aim-9 Stations are required.
*Can be waived by squadron Top 3 depending on mission/weather constraints.
