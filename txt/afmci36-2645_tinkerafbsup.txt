This supplement implements and extends the guidance of AFMCI 36-2645, Senior Functional
Roles and Responsibilities, dated 31 Jan 2011. AFMCI 36-2645 outlines the functional
management construct and the roles and responsibilities of Senior Functionals within Air Force
Materiel Command (AFMC). This instruction is not intended to supersede any higher level
instruction regarding civilian workforce management. Does not apply to the Air Force Reserve
and Air National Guard units, except where noted otherwise. Refer recommended changes and
questions about this publication to the Office of Primary Responsiblility (OPR) using the AF
Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication; route AF Form 847s from the field
through publications/forms managers. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes
prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with AFMAN 33-363, Management
of Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule
(RDS) located in https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm

1.3.10. (Added) Functional Training. Functional training results in knowledge, which can be
utilized in two or more divisions. Training that is unique to weapon system or work center,
would NOT be considered functional. APDP training is also NOT functional training. Training
that enhances management, supervisory and leadership skills would be considered functional.
1.4. (Added) For functional management to be successful, it is imperative for organizational
leaders and CSFs to develop collaborative relationships. At Oklahoma City Air Logistics Center
(OC-ALC), the primary focus is to develop and implement codified processes which provide
 2                                   AFMCI36-2645_TINKERAFBSUP 25 OCTOBER 2011


clearly defined roles and responsibilities, ensure consistency in implementation, enable strategic
functional hiring and promote effective functional training.
3.1.2.1.( Added) CSF Identification. The OC-ALC CSF appointment letter is provided in
Attachment 5, and identifies the following CSFs.
3.1.2.1.1. (Added) Manpower and Personnel (DP): OC-ALC/DP
3.1.2.1.2. (Added) Engineering (EN): OC-ALC/EN
3.1.2.1.3. (Added) Financial Management (FM): OC-ALC/FM
3.1.2.1.4. (Added) Contracting (PK): OC-ALC/PK
3.1.2.1.5.( Added) Program Management (PM): OC-ALC/GK
3.1.2.2. (Added) Authorized CSF Representatives. It is necessary for outside support
organizations (e.g. Manpower, Personnel, etc.) to know who has been authorized by a CSF to
speak on his or her behalf. In order to manage this responsibility, OC-ALC/DPB, in cooperation
with the CSFs, will develop and maintain a list of “Authorized CSF Representatives.” Once the
initial list is developed, CSFs can easily make changes by contacting OC-ALC/DPB. In
addition, any one needing a copy of this list can obtain one by contacting OC-ALC/DPB.
3.1.3.1.1. (Added) In order to ensure a certain level of standardization, the table in Attachment 6
identifies which responsibilities can and cannot be delegated per OC-ALC/CA direction. Each
CSF will utilize the OSF Appointment Letter to formally designate roles and responsibilities to
OSFs as appropriate.
3.1.3.2. (Added) OSF Identification. Each CSF is responsible for formally identifying OSFs via
an OSF appointment letter. The positions identified in Attachment 7 have been identified as the
OSFs for their respective organizations.
3.1.3.3. (Added) Functional Boards. Each CSF should establish a functional board for his/her
functional area. Board members should include any and all identified OSFs. The CSF can also
identify other members as appropriate. The board will discuss and make decisions on issues
pertaining to the entire functional community. Such issues include but are not limited to issue
resolution, hiring, career broadening, promotions and UCI inspections.
4.1. (Added) This Tinker Air Force Base (Tinker AFB) Supplement applies to all OC-ALC
organizations that report directly to OC-ALC/CC as well as tenant units requesting local CSF
support. AFMC tenants will fall under their home units for CSF management; however, OC-
ALC CSFs will provide support as appropriate.
4.1.1. (Added) CSFs and line organizations must adhere to the processes outlined in this
supplement. They may however, develop and publish additional, clarifying guidance pertaining
to their specific functional areas as necessary.
5.1.6.1.1. (Added) Strategic Hiring. All CSFs at OC-ALC will utilize the basic process outlined
below. As with other processes laid out in the supplement, CSFs can provide additional, CSF-
specific guidance as appropriate. The Contracting CSF will work closely with organization
leaders to keep them apprised of contracting workforce management activities and to provide an
open line of communication for organization leaders to provide input and identify issues;
however, formal coordination of the organization leaders is not required for workforce
management decisions of the Contracting CSF.

5.1.6.1.1.1. (Added) Initiate Request for Personnel Action (RPA) - The gaining supervisor
initiates an RPA by requesting/submitting an RPA buildsheet or other method accepted by the
Resource Manager (RM) or Personnel Resource Official (PRO) and processes the action
accordingly. The supervisor will identify “By Name Request” candidates selected to fill the
position at this time.
5.1.6.1.1.2. (Added) Create RPA Buildsheet & Authorization Change Request (ACR, as
required) - The RM creates an RPA buildsheet. If a change is required on the UMD, the RM or
PRO will ensure the ACR is submitted.
5.1.6.1.1.3. (Added) Obtain OSF Coordination (if applicable) - The RM or PRO ensures the
RPA buildsheet and ACR are forwarded to the OSF (if applicable) for coordination.
5.1.6.1.1.4. (Added) Obtain CSF Approval For Hiring – Once OSF coordination is received, the
RM or PRO forwards the RPA buildsheet and ACR to the CSF for approval. CSF approves
series/grade, method of fill and employee selected for the position (for “By Name Request”
candidates ) and returns approved RPA buildsheet back to the RM or PRO, along with a clear
message approving any UMD changes requested. The 72d Air Base Wing (72 ABW)
supervisors will coordinate selection with CSF prior to submission to RM.
5.1.6.1.1.5. (Added) Create RPA in DCPDS - The RM or PRO creates the RPA in the Defense
Civilian Personnel Data System (DCPDS) and sends it to Civilian Personnel for processing.
5.1.6.1.1.6. (Added) Submit ACR (as required) - If change to the UMD is necessary, the RM or
PRO will ensure the ACR is submitted to the installation Manpower Office in accordance with
the guidance provided.
5.1.6.1.1.7. (Added) Make Selection (if other than “By Name Request”) – Upon receipt of the
list of candidates from the AFPC-OL, the gaining supervisor makes a selection in accordance
with applicable guidance, policies, and regulations and submits selection to the RM or PRO.
5.1.6.1.1.8. (Added) Obtain CSF Approval For Seletion (and OSF coordination if applicable) –
The RM or PRO ensures the selection is submitted to the CSF for approval. The CSF approves
the selection and returns to RM or PRO who forwards selection to AFPC/OL for processing.
5.1.8.1. (Added) Career Broadening. All OC-ALC CSFs are expected to develop a functional
career broadening program following the basic processes outlined in this section. CSFs may also
provide additional, CSF-specific guidance as needed.
5.1.8.1.1. (Added) Goals. The primary goals of the functional career broadening programs are
to add breadth and depth to the individual’s experience and provide the functional organizations
a highly trained and motivated work force. Benefits to individual employees include exposure to
different disciplines and broadened experience. Employees become more valuable to the
organization and are able to demonstrate different levels of professional skills as a result of
organizational moves. The programs are developed to foster an agile workforce that is prepared
for future mission requirements and provide individuals the diversity and breadth of experience
necessary to achieve their personal goals.
5.1.8.1.2. (Added) Basic Principles. The following basic principles will be utilized by each
functional career broadening program.
5.1.8.1.2.1. (Added) Employees will be considered for a career broadening move when
requirements are met in accordance with CSF policy. Relevant experience and current
 4                                   AFMCI36-2645_TINKERAFBSUP 25 OCTOBER 2011


assignments will be reviewed, and will be the basis for determining who should be considered
for a career broadening assignment.
5.1.8.1.2.1.1. (Added) The career broadening program will not interfere with management’s
responsibility to assign personnel to various positions as the need arises.
5.1.8.1.2.1.2. (Added) Though every employee meeting the criteria will be considered for a
career broadening assignment, the decision to reassign will be at management’s discretion.
Employees may volunteer for job changes under these programs.
5.1.8.1.2.2. (Added) Functional boards will oversee the career broadening programs and make
recommended changes to the programs as deemed necessary (reference paragraph 3.1.3.3.).
5.1.8.1.2.3. (Added) Functional boards will convene as required, with semi-annual
comprehensive reviews for career broadening rotations.
5.1.8.1.2.3.1. (Added) Supervisors of the employees to be screened may be asked to provide
Individual Development Plans (IDPs) and resumes to the boards.
5.1.8.1.2.3.2. (Added) The boards will make every effort to consider employees’ wishes as
expressed in the IDP, but also will consider the overall impact job changes will have on the
organizations.
5.1.8.1.3. (Added) CSF Responsibilities. The CSFs shall:
5.1.8.1.3.1. (Added) Manage the functional career broadening programs to ensure they are
executed in accordance with this instruction, Center and personnel policies and regulations.
5.1.8.1.3.2. (Added) Announce opportunities for functionally aligned employees to apply for
participation.
5.1.8.1.3.3. (Added) Consolidate requests and provide results to the boards.
5.1.8.1.3.4. (Added) Market the programs to supervisors and management, highlighting the
program opportunities to bring in necessary skills and cultivate an improved workforce.
5.1.8.1.3.5. (Added) Collaborate with gaining and losing supervisors to obtain suggestions on
potential candidates, vacancies, and actions.
5.1.8.1.3.6. (Added) Facilitate release conditions and reporting date negotiations between
gaining and losing supervisors.
5.1.8.1.3.7. (Added) Develop, maintain and deliver program information to employees,
supervisors and management.
5.1.8.1.3.8. (Added) Schedule and chair the boards. Keep the boards up-to-date-on new
candidates, vacancies, proposed actions, and in-work actions.
5.1.8.1.4. (Added) Functional Board Responsibilities. The boards shall:
5.1.8.1.4.1. (Added) Identify vacancies and encourage supervisors to identify vacancies to be
considered for the career development programs.
5.1.8.1.4.2. (Added) Identify any additional candidates that organizations would like considered
for career broadening.
AFMCI36-2645_TINKERAFBSUP 25 OCTOBER 2011                                                         5


5.1.8.1.4.3. (Added) Act as the final approval decision authority for their respective
organizations.
5.1.8.1.4.4. (Added) Review       career   development     programs    and   recommend      process
improvements.
5.1.8.1.5. (Added) Functionally Aligned Employee Responsibilities. The functionally aligned
employees shall:
5.1.8.1.5.1. (Added) Participate in the career broadening program by registering desires when
program calls are made. Understand management may review all candidates however it does not
guarantee a rotation will be made.
5.1.8.1.5.2. (Added) Understand that after an assignment is made, the employee will rotate as
agreed to by the boards.
5.1.9.3. (Added) Authorization Change Requests (ACRs) and Requests for Personnel Actions
(RPAs). ACRs and RPAs submitted for functionally aligned positions must display appropriate
coordination (CSF or OSF, based on delegation). They must also be submitted in the correct
format as outlined by OC-ALC/DP. This format, as well as any additional information regarding
ACRs can be obtained from the Manpower Office (OC-ALC/DPB). The Civilian Personnel
Office (OC-ALC/DPP) provides guidance on the format, submission requirements and any
additional information for RPAs.
5.4.1.1. (Added) The charter provided in Attachment 8 establishes the CSF Corporate Board
(CSFCB) at OC-ALC. It also establishes a CSF Working Group (CSFWG) to provide
information, recommendations and support to the CSFCB. The CSFCB is chaired by OC-
ALC/CA, and the CSFWG is chaired by OC-ALC/DPB.
5.4.1.1.1. (Added) The primary functions of the CSFCB are to ensure standardization across the
Center to the greatest extent possible, hold resolution authority in situations where arbitration is
necessary to resolve disagreements between CSFs and organizational leaders and consider any
other CSF business that requires attention and/or resolution.
5.4.1.1.2. (Added) CSFCB voting members will include CSFs and all Center direct reporting
unit CCs/CLs and direct reporting non-unit leaders with personnel falling under the functional
management umbrella. In addition, leaders of AFMC tenant units will be identified as members
of the CSFCB.
5.4.2.1. (Added) Issue Resolution Process. The expected path for issue resolution is through the
established chain of command within the organization, then to the respective directorate
chief/unit leader and CSF, if necessary. If further arbitration and decision are required, both
parties will outline the issue to the CSFCB, or, if appropriate, to OC-ALC/CA for decision.
7. (Added) Unit Compliance Inspections (UCI) Checklist. The UCI Checklist titled “Senior
Functional Roles and Responsibilities” will be utilized for CSF Compliance Oversight and
Inspection. This document can be found at Attachment 9.

Note: That just because a task is delegable does not mean a CSF is obligated or will choose to
delegate it.
Note: Requires coordination with servicing manpower office.
Note: contracting functional exceptions outlined in Section 6.7. The Contracting CSF has
approval Authority for all authorization management activities related to the contracting
workforce.
Note: CSF is conduit to HQ AFMC for management of senior leader planning.
Note: Comply IAW HQ AFMC functional for approval.
A6.2. Although the responsibility for approving OCRs is not delegable, the actual development
of the OCRs is delegable.
A6.3. This responsibility is non-delegable unless the skill change is contained within a function.
For example, if the change crosses functions (e.g. 8XX to 5XX), it needs to be approved by both
CSFs. However, if it is within a function (e.g. an 8XX to another 8XX), the CSF can delegate
the approval authority to the OSF.
A6.4. Although the creation/submission of ACRs is delegable, per Section 5.1.9.1 of AFMCI
36-2645, the CSF maintains OPCON for the ACR process within non-units.
A6.5. Although the creation/submission of RPAs is delegable, per Section 5.1.9.2. of AFMCI
36-2645, the CSF maintains OPCON for hiring, fills and the RPA process.
A6.6. According to Section 6.5 of AFMCI 36-2645, org leaders are responsible for this, not
CSFs.

it is up to the home units to identify OSFs for tenant organizations. Tinker CSFs/CSFOs will
work with appropriate POCs as necessary to provide support to AFMC tenant organizations.
