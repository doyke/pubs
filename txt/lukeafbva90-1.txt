                    56TH FIGHTER WING INSPECTOR GENERAL (IG) COMPLAINTS PROGRAM

The Inspector General Complaint Resolution Program is described in AFI 90-301. You may go to an inspector or IG at any level, but
experience has shown commanders and supervisors are the people best equipped to resolve complaints. If a policy, directive or instruction
provides a specific means of appeal or redress of a grievance, you must exhaust those appeal procedures. You must be able to allege the
process was mishandled or handled prejudicially before IG channels will process a complaint of mishandling. The following matrix
provides for appropriate referral to agencies with programs for the redress of these complaints. This figure does not list every type of
complaint that can be handled by other appeal channels. Dissatisfaction with the outcome of an appeal is not sufficient basis for an IG
investigation.
