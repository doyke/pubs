                                 WING EXERCISE PREPARATION

1.1. General. The following procedures explain how the 92 ARW participates in local exercise activities.
Wing Inspections, 92 ARW/XPI, will oversee the process and ensure the POCs meet the schedule. The
exercise participants will prepare for the exercise. All needed planning meetings will be set up by the
players or their home station preparation team. Some exercises will be close hold until messages are
released, others will have a large lead-time, and the participants can start their preparations as early as
they need/want.

1.2. OPLAN 8044 Exercise. 92 ARW/XPOT is the keeper of OPLAN 8044 knowledge in the wing. The
Wing Readiness Officer will collect exercise objectives (see Attachment 2 for examples) from the
groups and XPOT to design an exercise outline. Once Wing Readiness receives an overall outline, they
will go to 92 ARW/XPI, Command Post, and Intel for expansion into the exercise scenario. XPI and the
Exercise Evaluation Team (EET) will manage and evaluate the exercise and its preparation, but will not
devise the layout of operations and the procedures used in the exercise area. A sample exercise format can
be found in Attachment 3 . Follow the procedures below to plan this exercise.
   1.2.1. No Later Than (NLT) 70 days prior to the exercise start date, Wing Readiness will task the
   group readiness offices for their exercise objectives. The suspense date will be NLT 60 days prior to
   the exercise. Wing Readiness will collect inputs from the Vice Wing Commander (CV). XPI will get
   inputs from EET (if any). This is each group’s chance to ensure the exercise includes areas the group
   wants or needs observed. Readiness offices must ensure they get inputs from all units in their group to
   include group commanders.
   1.2.2. Intel will prepare or update a scenario buildup for the exercise.
   1.2.3. The readiness offices will know what equipment, based off their tasked Unit Type Codes
   (UTCs), will be deployed with the exercise participants and what would be pre-positioned at the For-
   ward Operating Location (FOL). Readiness offices will notify XPI and Logistic Plans, 92 LRS/
   LGRRP, which items will be pre-positioned so they can tailor those items out of the deployment
   schedule-of-events (DSOE).
   1.2.4. The outline must consider the Mission Essential Task Listings (METLs) as outlined in the latest
   AMC Task Version List and AMCPAM 90-202, Inspection Guide. The wing’s EET members will
   ensure the final Master Scenario Event Listing (MSEL) evaluates as many Mission Essential Tasks
   (METs) as possible for their respective areas to include the common core METs.
   1.2.5. The basic exercise outline will be briefed at the Installation Readiness Council (IRC) NLT 30
   days prior to exercise start.
   1.2.6. The outline will be approved by the IRC and turned over to XPI NLT 30 days prior to the exer-
   cise start date.
   1.2.7. The MSEL will be complete (CV approved) NLT five days prior to the exercise. The MSEL
   and final message traffic are close-hold items releasable to EET members only.
   1.2.8. Readiness offices will update XPI and Logistic Plans with any changes to the pre-positioned
   equipment list NLT 24 hours prior to exercise execution via AMC Form 188, Inspection/Exercise
   Communication.

1.3. Ability To Survive and Operate (ATSO) Exercise. The 92 CES/CEX (Civil Engineer Readiness
Office) is the OPR of ATSO for the wing; however, an ATSO exercise requires a large range of inputs
from each squadron/group in the wing. Readiness offices will collect exercise objectives (see Attach-
ment 2 for examples) from their groups (to include group commander input). Once all inputs are received
CEX, Wing Readiness, Intel, and applicable units will organize a wing ATSO outline. Upon completion
of the outline, it will be sent to XPI and Intel for expansion into an exercise scenario. XPI/EET will man-
age and evaluate the exercise and its preparation. XPI is not responsible to devise the layout of operations
and the procedures to be used in the FOL but will review and approve or make recommended changes
based on HQ AMC IG guidance. A sample exercise format can be found in Attachment 4 . Follow the
below procedures to plan an ATSO.
    1.3.1. XPI will reserve the PHOENIX TENT package NLT six months prior to the exercise.
    1.3.2. NLT 90 days out from the scheduled ATSO exercise start date, Wing Readiness will task the
    group readiness offices for their exercise objectives. The suspense date will be NLT five days prior to
    the outline meeting. Wing readiness will collect inputs from the CV. XPI will give inputs to include
    the exercise-simulated location. This is each group’s opportunity and responsibility to ensure the exer-
    cise includes areas the group wants or needs observed. Ensure the readiness offices get inputs from
    ALL the units in their group to include group commanders.
    1.3.3. The outline must consider the METLs as outlined in the latest AMC Task Version List and
    AMCPAM 90-202. The wing’s EET members will ensure the final MSEL evaluates as many METs as
    possible for their respective areas to include the common core METs.
    1.3.4. Wing Readiness will chair an outline meeting with CES/CEX, all squadron/group readiness
    offices, Intel, and applicable units NLT 60 days prior to exercise start (XPI needs time to coordinate
    with outside agencies). The goal is to develop an outline that includes as many of the group’s inputs as
    possible.
    1.3.5. Intel will prepare or update a scenario buildup for the exercise.
    1.3.6. Wing Inspections, with the help of Logistics Plans, Intel, and CEX will develop the Warning
    Order, OPORD, and DEPORDS.
    1.3.7. The readiness offices will know what equipment will be deployed based off their tasked UTCs,
    with the exercise participants and what should be pre-positioned in theater (host nation assets). Readi-
    ness offices will notify XPI and Logistic Plans with which items will be pre-positioned so Logistic
    Plans can tailor those items out of the DSOE. Tailoring equipment should occur after receipt of Oper-
    ation Order (OPORD) and Air Mobility Tasking (AMT) notional tasking.
    1.3.8. CES will update the PHOENIX TENT controlling agency on whether or not we will use the
    Phoenix tent package.
    1.3.9. CEX will ensure Camp Airey and the surrounding exercise area is available.
    1.3.10. 92 LRS/LGRRP EET will draft the Exercise AMT to meet the exercise outline/scenario and
    include agreed upon UTCs and Unit Line Numbers (ULNs). These UTCs, ULNs will be in accordance
    with the Air Force Wartime Utilization Summary (AFWUS).
    1.3.11. The exercise outline will be briefed to and approved by the IRC and turned over to XPI NLT
    45 days prior to the exercise start date. The outline will include specific UTCs to support the exercise
    outline/scenario.
FAIRCHILDAFBI90-201 29 FEBRUARY 2004                                                                     7


   1.3.12. The outline will then go to XPI and Intel for MSEL and message traffic preparation. XPI will
   try to meet all of the objectives in the outline, but will arrange the MSEL in a manner that truly tests
   the objectives desired (i.e., times may change). XPI may change some areas of the outline if they do
   not coincide with the HQ AMC IG ORI blueprint.
   1.3.13. The Threat Working Group (TWG) will meet to review the outline and coordinate EET sce-
   nario inputs with realistic present day capabilities, 45 days prior to the start of the exercise (STAR-
   TEX).

   tioned equipment list NLT 24 hours prior to exercise execution via AMC Form 188.

1.4. Major Accident Response Exercise (MARE). CES/CEX also possesses the MARE knowledge in
the wing. Therefore, they, along with XPI and the Medical Group, will design and create each MARE
exercise. Other group EET representatives can provide scenarios to meet operational needs, (e.g., Safety
for aircraft mishap). XPI and EET will manage and evaluate the exercise and its preparation. XPI will not
devise the layout of operations and the procedures to be used; however, they will approve or make recom-
mended changes based on headquarters guidance. Follow the below procedures to plan a MARE.
   1.4.1. NLT 60 days prior to the scheduled MARE; XPI, CEX, Group Readiness Representatives will
   get together to create the exercise scenario and identify broad objectives.
   1.4.2. NLT 45 days prior to the MARE, the scenario will be briefed at the Installation Readiness
   Council and group objectives will be sought.
   1.4.3. NLT 30 days prior to the MARE, the coordinated group objectives are due to XPI.
   1.4.4. NLT 14 days prior to the MARE, the EET will incorporate the objectives and develop a MSEL.
   The MSEL is a close hold item releasable to EET members only.
   1.4.5. NLT 5 days prior to the exercise start date, the CV will approve the outline.

                                               Chapter 3

                                   EXERCISE GROUND RULES

3.1. General. These ground rules apply to personnel who are participating in a 92 ARW exercise. Unless
specifically told not to do something, do what you would do in a real-world situation.
   3.1.1. If at any time someone feels the situation at hand jeopardizes the safety of personnel or poses
   potential damage to equipment, the individual should immediately declare, “Terminate, terminate, ter-
   minate.” When a terminate is declared, EET members will assess the situation and take appropriate
   action. Resumption of the exercise resides with the EET Team Chief.
   3.1.2. Everyone must be aware of severe weather, dehydration, heat stress and physical fatigue. If a
   person feels ill, they should immediately request medical assistance.
   3.1.3. Any person responding/tending to a real-world emergency will immediately become exempt
   from exercises and may unmask as necessary to provide immediate care to individuals and/or help
   confront the emergency situation. While deployed, a white armband with a Red Cross will identify
   real-world medical personnel. Real-world ambulance (if deployed to the exercise area) will have a
   “real-world” sign placed on the dashboard.
   3.1.4. Units should continue to meet all real-world reporting requirements from unit, group, MAJ-
   COM and Air Force publications. The EET team will act in the capacity of the "host base," "host
   nation," "theater command," and other external agencies for all exercise events. EET does not have
   waiver authority; any requests for waivers to AFIs, AMCIs, etc., must be worked through appropriate
   channels. Responses to scenarios and requests for additional guidance or information will be coordi-
   nated through the Exercise Team Chief.
   3.1.5. All required reports and messages will be completed and signed (released) by the appropriate
   authorities. Do not transmit exercise messages without functional inspector guidance/approval. Addi-
   tionally, copies of all messages will be provided to the EET team. One will receive responses to your
   requests and reports in a realistic time period.
   3.1.6. Planning Roles and Responsibilities.
       3.1.6.1. EET Planning Role. EET planners act in a variety of roles. These include, but are not lim-
       ited to, higher headquarters, Theater Combatant Commanders, and Host Nation. EET will define
       large-scale deployment sequence (Advanced Echelon (ADVON) Day, Deployment Day(s), etc.).
       EET will write and transmit message traffic, intelligence scenario and employment taskings. EET
       will be the approval agency for support requests and identify sources of support and supplies.
       3.1.6.2. Unit Planning Responsibilities. Monitor higher headquarters planning; provide feedback
       and additional information as needed. Plan to form the force and protect the force upon arrival at
       the deployed location. Plan to establish operational capability as defined by the Operations Order.
   3.1.7. XPI-Issued Badges. During the exercises, there will be three badges used by various personnel
   in specific roles. The meaning of the badges are as follows:
       3.1.7.1. Blue with “IG”: Inspectors and Augmenting Inspectors: Unlimited access.
       3.1.7.2. Blue with “EET”: Unlimited access.
       3.1.7.3. Blue with “Observer”: Unlimited access.

     3.1.8. XP/EET Trusted Agents. The trusted agent role is significantly different than the role of the
     unit’s designated POCs for normal coordination. Inspected units must respect the unique role of the
     trusted agent; an inspected wing trusted agent is not allowed to divulge XPI-related information.
     3.1.9. Exercise Visitor Policy. Unit commanders who wish to visit their UTCs during the exercise
     must coordinate their visit IAW procedures established by the Deployed Forces Commander (DFC),
     in-process through PERSCO, and bring the appropriate Military Operational Protective Posture
     (MOPP) gear. Inspected unit visitors (not observers) are considered unit guests, and the inspected unit
     is responsible for their protection, finding billeting space and subsistence. Commanders and First Ser-
     geants may sign out Observer badges at the Exercise Control Group center, Bldg. 2080, and proceed
     by foot into the exercise area or make use of bus transportation into the exercise area. A maximum of
     four observer badges may be signed out at one time.
     3.1.10. Other Inspected Unit Responsibilities.
        3.1.10.1. POVs are not permitted within the security perimeter of the exercise.
        3.1.10.2. Deployed exercise vehicles used by players will be identified with a placard identifying
        the AEW (P) and be assigned by the deployed Transportation Officer/NCO. This placard will be
        affixed to the vehicle so it is clearly visible to XP/EET.
        3.1.10.3. Ensure unit equipment is removed from the exercise area within 24 hours of End Exer-
        cise (ENDEX).
        3.1.10.4. Real world medical coverage for exercise players will be located as directed by the EET
        Team Chief.
        3.1.10.5. The DFC will designate approved smoking areas.
        3.1.10.6. Only vehicles inside the aircraft restricted area may leave keys in the ignition and win-
        dows rolled up when unattended.
        3.1.10.7. During in processing at the deployed location, PERSCO will mark ID cards to identify
        exercise players. The PERSCO EET member will brief the XP/EET what marking was used.
        3.1.10.8. During deicer operations, the driver and basket operator may unmask and unsuit for
        safety. Host nation personnel, if approved by the EET team chief, may assist in deicing operations.
        3.1.10.9. When someone becomes an exercise casualty they need to be brought to the Casualty
        Collection Point, and a doctor will verify the death. SVS will process them through the morgue,
        then PERSCO will send out the appropriate reports/requests. The casualty will be his/her own
        replacement.
        3.1.10.10. Personnel found outside the play area or violating the Rules of Engagement (ROE) will
        be taken into custody and placed in host nation confinement until processed by the participants/
        legal team within ROE arrangements.
     3.1.11. Aircraft/Aircrew Generation Requirements.
        3.1.11.1. Units will generate all tasked aircraft and corresponding aircrews. We recognize the
        schedules units must maintain to keep their aircraft ready to meet real-world taskings. For this rea-
        son, the XP/EET will exempt stringent isochronal and refurbishment aircraft on a case-by-case
        basis, if it can be shown that tasking them for the exercises would negatively impact the unit's abil-
        ity to complete scheduled isochronal inspections or refurbishment within required time frames.
FAIRCHILDAFBI90-201 29 FEBRUARY 2004                                                                     19


     Units should respond to exercise taskings as they would real-world contingencies and demonstrate
     their ability to accelerate work on all of their aircraft in order to meet exercise requirements.
     3.1.11.2. Aircraft and aircrews generated to support Higher Headquarter (HHQ) missions and
     scheduled to depart more than 12 hours prior to designated exercise closure time will not count
     toward deployment readiness mission generation. All aircraft moving passengers and cargo to the
     forward operating base (FOB) must meet closure at the FOB. All tasked aircraft and correspond-
     ing aircrews not required to move passengers and cargo to the FOB will be generated through
     engine start.
  3.1.12. Weapons.
     3.1.12.1. Bulk shipment or individual issue of weapons for support personnel during the deploy-
     ment is at the commander’s discretion and should be based on FOB intelligence information.
     3.1.12.2. A blank round may be carried in the chamber when directed by the deployed com-
     mander or designated representative. All issued weapons will be fitted with blank firing adapters.
     Blank ammunition will not be fired at personnel closer than 25 feet.
     3.1.12.3. Do not bring live ammunition for any weapon to the deployed location. The only excep-
     tion may be live ammunition required by real-world security forces personnel. Coordination with
     the XP/EET SF staff is mandatory before live ammunition can be brought to the deployed area of
     operations.
     3.1.12.4. All magazines that will have blank ammo loaded in them will be painted blue or have
     blue tape on the magazine.
     3.1.12.5. Under no circumstance will 9mm sidearm be taken to the FOB. Personnel who are nor-
     mally assigned handguns for deployment will demonstrate issue and turn-in procedures until
     informed by an XP/EET inspector that it is no longer required. Personnel may also be asked to dis-
     assemble and assemble their weapon. All other UTC-tasked weapons will be deployed.
     3.1.12.6. If selective arming is implemented, all non-SF personnel will be armed with not less
     than 40 rounds of blank ammunition for each M-16 rifle. One weapon will be available for each
     manpower requirement reflected in the deployable UTC; the exceptions are noncombatants, i.e.
     chaplain and legal. Medical and aero medical units are armed IAW AFI 41-106, Medical Readi-
     ness Planning and Training.
     3.1.12.7. The wing will have all required blank munitions available for issue to the deployed
     munitions custodian. The munitions custodians will then distribute the ammunition as required.
     Personnel possessing a weapon without blank ammunition will be considered unarmed.
     3.1.12.8. Do not remove blank adapters from M-16s.
     3.1.12.9. Military airlift is the primary means of transporting weapons and ammunition (if
     required) to or from the exercise. Units will develop and execute a plan to source weapons and
     ammunition that ensures maximum use of military airlift. Commercial transportation of munitions
     to or from the exercise is not authorized unless three conditions are met: (1) all other available mil-
     itary airlift options are exhausted, (2) the unit commander concurs, and (3) the XP/EET approves.
     3.1.12.10. Deployed armory guidance is located in AMCPAM 31-1, The Air Mobility Command
     Arming Policy, para 6.9.

     3.1.13. Attacks, Ground Burst Simulators (GBS), Unexploded Ordnance (UXO), and Decontamina-
     tion.
        3.1.13.1. Enemy attacks may be initiated by smoke grenades, GBSs, small arms fire, input cards,
        bird cannons or any situation that threatens the security of unit resources and personnel. The color
        of any smoke used has no meaning.
        3.1.13.2. Do not treat expended XP/EET ordnance (GBS, smoke canisters) as UXOs. However,
        XPI ordnance that has misfired will be treated as a real-world UXO with real-world reporting,
        evacuation and cordon requirements.
        3.1.13.3. Limit all exercise UXO cordons to 10 percent of the real-world cordon required.
        3.1.13.4. Aircraft, vehicles and equipment damaged, destroyed or contaminated as a result of sim-
        ulated enemy activity may be returned to service after appropriate unit actions are taken and
        approved by the functional XP/EET inspector. Units are expected to develop “work arounds” and
        brief the XP/EET evaluators.
     3.1.14. Inspected units may borrow equipment to meet mission requirements, within the following
     guidelines:
        3.1.14.1. It must be part of a command tasking.
        3.1.14.2. The required resources must be UTC authorized and cannot be satisfied with non-tasked
        unit resources.
        3.1.14.3. Appropriate requests will be submitted to and approved by the XP/EET team.
     3.1.15. Units will not be allowed to coordinate the use of additional local equipment and facilities
     beyond what is provided and deployed without prior XP/Exercise Director approval except for
     real-world emergencies.
     3.1.16. Once unit personnel and equipment are processed they will not be used to support building/
     processing of follow-on UTCs/chalks. These resources will not be available until after arrival at the
     deployed location.
     3.1.17. Actual TDY length will be reflected in the levy flow. For inspection purposes, consider the
     length of TDY to be 45 days.
     3.1.18. All personnel are confined to the play areas unless previously approved by the XP/Exercise
     Director to travel off the compound. Anyone found off the compound in an unauthorized status will be
     subject to hostile capture and removal from duty for 24 hours.
     3.1.19. When deployed to the FOB, all commercial food sources are off limits to inspected unit per-
     sonnel. Unless previously coordinated with the evaluators, anyone found consuming commercial food
     or beverages from outside the FOB play area will be removed from duty for 24 hours. The inspected
     unit will not airlift food items into the Area of Responsibility (AOR) unless approved by the Services
     inspector prior to the exercise. Individuals shall not bring food items to replace meals. A field
     exchange will be established by Services at the FOB.
     3.1.20. Inspected unit personnel are prohibited from possessing alcoholic beverages at the FOB. Any-
     one consuming or possessing alcoholic beverages will be immediately taken into custody and returned
     to their unit commander for appropriate actions.
FAIRCHILDAFBI90-201 29 FEBRUARY 2004                                                                   21


  3.1.21. The host nation can, with pre-coordinated Wing Readiness/EET approval, provide personnel,
  equipment and supplies based on requests from the supported unit. Submit written requests for
  host-nation supplies or equipment on an AMC Form 188 or on a typed/handwritten letter; be sure to
  include the type of supplies, amount needed, and indicate when supplies are required. Place the
  request in the host nation in-box located in the Wing Operations Cell (WOC). Supply requests are not
  automatically approved, and resources will not be authorized until XP/EET approval is obtained.
  3.1.22. Notify the functional inspector prior to giving any briefings (i.e., pre-convoy, Rapid Runway
  Repair (RRR), crash rescue, structural, shift-change, pre-mission, etc.); however, do not delay brief-
  ings if an inspector is not present.
  3.1.23. Vehicle Operations in MOPP. Specific ground rules will be given to all occupants and opera-
  tors of vehicles inside the Play Area for the appropriate clothing and equipment during MOPP condi-
  tions. When operating a vehicle outside the Play Area, the driver must remove their mask and may
  remove their chemical boots in order to promote safety. All other occupants will wear the full protec-
  tive gear for the current MOPP level. All occupants and the operator will be in the appropriate MOPP
  level when exiting the vehicle at their destination.
  3.1.24. If an individual becomes ill, injured or requires emergency leave, the unit must coordinate a
  replacement through theater channels.
  3.1.25. The unit Survival Recovery Center (SRC) commander will coordinate with the on-site XP/
  EET inspector prior to any reduction in Alarm condition, Force Protection Condition (FPCON), or
  MOPP level. This action is necessary to ensure all evaluation objectives are met.
  3.1.26. Actual cash will not be required for personnel processing. Contracting and comptroller per-
  sonnel may wear BDUs when conducting business on the local economy.
  3.1.27. Do not issue or ship actual nerve agent antidotes or pretreatment tablets. However, units must
  present a plan to provide actual antidotes and to bulk-ship nerve agent pretreatment tablets. Units must
  deploy simulated nerve agent antidotes using any locally developed substitute, such as clothespins.
  3.1.28. Play Areas are delineated by the red line boundaries as shown on the Play Area Map. The
  deployed wing is responsible for conducting sweeps for UXO, assessing/ reporting facility and infra-
  structure damage, monitoring nuclear, biological, chemical (NBC) contamination, and performing
  recovery actions within these areas.
  3.1.29. The provisional commander may want the flexibility to establish some limited number of
  work centers outside the delineated Play Areas. If so desired, the following actions are required to
  meet inspection objectives:
     3.1.29.1. The Provisional Unit will identify work areas located outside the Play Areas to the XP/
     EET.
     3.1.29.2. Members working in these facilities must be appropriately dressed for the current
     MOPP level, FPCON, and/or Alarm Condition and will respond appropriately to all changes in
     MOPP level, FPCON, and/or Alarm Condition.
     3.1.29.3. Personnel working in these facilities are required to conduct appropriate pre-attack,
     attack, and post-attack actions IAW AFMAN 10-100, Airman’s Manual.
     3.1.29.4. Sweep responsibility for the unit extends out to a 100-foot radius surrounding each work
     center.

        3.1.29.5. The Provisional Wing is responsible for providing all support (e.g., Civil Engineer,
        EOD, Fire, Damage Assessment, etc.) to these work centers. In many instances, US deployed
        forces will be responsible to provide repair teams to bring critical facilities back on line.
     3.1.30. Sleeping facilities, their associated shower/latrines, and their immediate vicinities are desig-
     nated “No-Play” areas.
        3.1.30.1. “No-Play” areas are safe from all types of simulated hazard, attack, or opposing action
        and are for the specific use of off-duty personnel.
        3.1.30.2. Members within the immediate vicinity of a “No-Play” facility are not required to take
        immediate action or demonstrate the current MOPP level or Alarm Condition until declaration of
        Alarm RED, FPCON DELTA, or MOPP-4. When any of these conditions is declared, off-duty
        members in the immediate vicinity of a “No-Play” facility will move indoors and remain indoors
        until the “All Clear” is declared.
        3.1.30.3. Members (on or off duty) not in the immediate vicinity of a “No-Play” facility must be
        appropriately dressed for the current MOPP level, FPCON, and/or Alarm Condition and will
        respond appropriately to all changes in MOPP level, FPCON, and/or Alarm Condition.
        3.1.30.4. If Alarm RED is declared, off-duty members not in the immediate vicinity of a
        “No-Play” facility will take appropriate personal protective actions and wait for announcement of
        Alarm BLACK or release by the XP/EET before proceeding to their destination.
     3.1.31. Example applications of rules provided in paragraph 0
        3.1.31.1. A member relaxing in the immediate vicinity of a “No-Play” facility may remain in
        place in non-protective attire throughout the early changes in MOPP level, FPCON, and Alarm
        levels. When MOPP 4, FPCON DELTA, or Alarm RED is reached, the member must return to the
        interior of the “No-Play” facility and remain inside until the “All Clear” is declared.
        3.1.31.2. A member participating in recreational or physical training activities in the immediate
        vicinity of a “No-Play” facility may remain in place in non-protective attire throughout early
        changes in MOPP level, FPCON, and Alarm levels. When MOPP 4, FPCON DELTA, or Alarm
        RED is reached, the member must return to the “No-Play” facility and remain inside until the “All
        Clear” is declared.
        3.1.31.3. A member traveling to the dining facility in MOPP 3 hears the giant voice announce
        “Alarm RED, MOPP 4.” The member must seek available cover and don their protective gear. The
        member may proceed to their destination after the declaration of Alarm BLACK or with the per-
        mission of an XP/EET inspector.
        3.1.31.4. Members must take note of the current MOPP level, FPCON and Alarm Conditions
        before venturing away from a “No-Play” area in order to be properly dressed/prepared for the cur-
        rent MOPP level, FPCON or Alarm Condition. The member must be ready to meet the challenges
        of any changes in MOPP level, FPCON, or Alarm Condition.
     3.1.32. The XP/EET reserves the right to selectively clear (reduce MOPP level, FPCON and/or Alarm
     Condition) selected areas or facilities in order to meet the needs of the inspection. Players in selec-
     tively cleared areas and facilities will be instructed as to what to do and how to respond by the XP/
     EET member clearing the area or facility.
FAIRCHILDAFBI90-201 29 FEBRUARY 2004                                                                     23


3.2. Command and Control.
   3.2.1. XP/EET will replicate, as closely as possible, theater ballistic missile warnings. Notification of
   launch may come over Satellite Communications (SATCOM), High Frequency (HF), telephone or
   some other communications method as determined by the unit, to the unit Command and Control (C2)
   mode. For example, a call may be placed to the unit SRC stating, "ballistic missile inbound." (NOTE:
   the time between notification and missile impact depends on many variables, including weather, col-
   lection platform location and operator efficiency. Units should not expect a set time lapse between
   notification and impact. Notification is thus primarily a C2 function and not an intelligence responsi-
   bility.
   3.2.2. Inspected units will set up host nation (XP) in-boxes in the WOC, SRC, CE Damage Control
   Center (DCC), Central Security Control/Base Defense Operations Center (CSC/BDOC), and other
   functional control centers as applicable.
   3.2.3. Inspected units will prepare exercise situation reports (SITREP) and operations report
   (OPREP-3) messages from home station and deployed location as appropriate, but do not transmit.
   Addressees will include the minimum essential identified in AFI 10-206, Operational Reporting, and
   any applicable AMC, AFRES, or ANG supplement. Provide voice reporting to the XP/EET inspector,
   when present, or to the Air Operations Center (AOC). These reports will be filed with all other reports
   for XP/EET inspector review.

3.3. Intelligence.
   3.3.1. Intelligence message traffic. During planning, pre-deployment and deployment message traffic
   will flow via SIPRNET e-mail. If phone lines are not available to run classified modem, Intel EET
   will drop message traffic in person.
   3.3.2. XP/EET will always attempt to provide specific, AMC unit-oriented scenario intelligence. Sce-
   narios written by XP/EET will use real country names whenever possible. Unit intelligence will use
   real-world reference documents and data sources for background information on such things as terror-
   ist groups, health concerns, evasion and recovery information, survival issues, enemy orders of battle
   (OB) and enemy threat capabilities and employment doctrine/tactics. This approach maximizes real-
   ism, assures maximum availability of reference materials and provides the greatest practical training
   benefit for unit intelligence personnel.
   3.3.3. The scenario message traffic will begin to flow about 30 days prior to unit deployment. Mes-
   sage traffic will usually consist of one simulated Daily Intelligence Summary (DISUM) each working
   day prior to the exercise, but may be adjusted due to holidays or planning needs. Message traffic will
   switch to deployed theater format before unit deployment, at which time frequency will increase dra-
   matically. Exercise message traffic will replicate real-world traffic whenever possible. Units will
   receive DISUMs, INTSUMs, INTREPS, MISREPs, special analytical reports and Order of Battle
   updates. Order of Battle updates will be XP-generated and serve as modifications to real-world base-
   line data. During planning, pre-deployment and deployment message traffic will flow via SIPRNET
   email. If phone lines are not available to run classified modem, message traffic will be dropped in per-
   son by Intel EET.
   3.3.4. Pulling data from Intelink-S will satisfy most exercise-driven intelligence requirements. Exer-
   cise-driven requirements not satisfied via Intelink-S, including requests for information, requests for
   imagery (domestic or foreign), and Maps, Charts and Geodesy (MC&G) products, will be coordinated
24                                                      FAIRCHILDAFBI90-201 29 FEBRUARY 2004


     through XP/EET. Once validated by XP/EET, units will then process requirements via existing chan-
     nels IAW AMCI 14-103, Requesting Intelligence Information and Imagery.
     3.3.5. All units will be expected to attain and maintain connectivity with HHQ intelligence functions.
     3.3.6. Units are expected to build, issue and track aircrew Evasion and Recovery (E&R) kits while
     operating under simulated hostile conditions. If the simulated theater of operations is also a unit’s
     OPLAN-tasked theater, the unit will be expected to have on hand or on order Evasion Charts (EVC).
     3.3.7. In the absence of an OSI office, some unit commanders may desire intelligence personnel to
     conduct initial screening interviews of enemy prisoners of war (EPW). The XP/EET team recognizes
     intelligence personnel have neither training nor formal guidance on the conduct of EPW screening
     interviews, and thus will not grade this function. However, due to a different perspective on the situa-
     tion and greater familiarity with Essential Elements of Information, intelligence personnel may be
     able to elicit valuable information not obtained by Security Forces interrogation.

3.4. Mission Execution.
     3.4.1. User-related Guidance. With some exceptions controlled by the XP/EET, ATO/GDSS and/or
     AOC-tasked missions will support real-world users. Tanker missions will support TACC-validated
     horse blanket contracts and/or AOC-validated requests in user-booked airspace. Airlift missions will
     support users as arranged by XP/EET through various means. Make normal peacetime efforts to sat-
     isfy user requirements within the limits of safety, aircrew judgment and training, and inspection
     requirements. Deviations to any departure/landing times will be as necessary to satisfy user require-
     ments but must be coordinated through the WOC and AOC. Direct contact with user units is not
     authorized unless preapproved by AOC. Unless preapproved by AOC, do not discuss potential for
     future missions with users during in-flight communications.
     3.4.2. Flight Plan and GDSS Guidance. DD Form 175, Military Flight Plan is considered a substi-
     tute for DD Form 1801, DOD International Flight Plan. Expect the EXERCISE warning order to
     provide AFTO 781 codes (mission symbols) and GDSS mission number construction references. The
     deployed AEW will load mission information into GDSS. The SOC will update sortie information in
     GDSS.
     3.4.3. Mission Tracking for Theater-deployed Scenarios. The AOC directs the theater-level opera-
     tions; the WOC directs unit-level operations; within the AOC, Combat Plans builds the ATO and
     Combat Operations executes the ATO (see AFI 13-1AOCV3). AOC actions will be simulated by the
     XP/EET as appropriate. The WOC is not responsible to actively track mission progress after the air-
     craft departs the deployed location. Other locations may input mission-tracking information into
     GDSS. Be aware that XP/EET AOC may not have GDSS access and might pass mission-tracking
     information to the AEW for administrative entry into GDSS. Upon mission completion, the deployed
     AEW may input missing GDSS information based on aircrew mission recaps or AFTO 781 entries.
     Provide the AOC final copies of mission information the morning after each employment day (pro-
     vide to XP/EET inspector in WOC).
     3.4.4. Guidance for Phantom-user Missions. Inspectors will provide guidance as required at an appro-
     priate point and the unit/crew may be given the option to fly a training (i.e. transition) sortie within a
     designated launch and recovery window coordinated through XP/EET inspector, the WOC and the
     AOC. The fuel load must be considered since AOC will not approve in-flight fuel dumping to adjust
FAIRCHILDAFBI90-201 29 FEBRUARY 2004                                                                        25


   landing gross weight outside of an emergency situation. If a training sortie is desired/approved, the
   crew will cancel the original flight plan and refile the training mission.

3.5. Operations.
   3.5.1. Aircrews need not deploy with an extended set of communications security (COMSEC) mate-
   rial to cover the full, simulated deployment length. They will deploy with a seven-day supply of
   COMSEC. No simulation form needs to be completed for this.
   3.5.2. Emergency aircraft taxiing will be simulated during exercise scenarios. A simulated taxi con-
   sists of: a qualified taxi crew on board, all checklist items up to, but not including engine start, and all
   required personnel in position. Once the taxi crew requests engines start clearance, simulate removing
   the chocks and wait three minutes. DO NOT START ENGINES. After this point the taxi is complete
   and restoration actions can be taken.
   3.5.3. Combat departures, arrivals and threat reaction maneuvers will be briefed, as applicable, and
   flown to the extent allowed in applicable AFI 11 series instructions.
   3.5.4. Aircrews should anticipate an XP/EET operations inspector on the flight deck for each mission.
   Plan crew complements accordingly, and seat the inspector at a station with aircraft intercom and
   radio capability.
   3.5.5. Inspected units will prepare chart packages and mission information for XP/EET inspectors to
   track mission progress in-flight. Information in these packages should match aircrew information, and
   does not need to be any more elaborate than what the aircrews receive. DO NOT “gold-plate” flight
   inspector packages.
      3.5.5.1. For single- and two-ship missions prepare one additional package.
      3.5.5.2. For three- and four-ship missions, prepare two additional packages.
      3.5.5.3. For four- through six-ship missions, prepare three additional packages.
   3.5.6. For deployment planning purposes, consider the deployment leg as the final leg into the FOB
   when the aircraft reaches the midpoint between home station and the deployed location.
   3.5.7. Chemical Threat Area (CTA) Operations.
      3.5.7.1. Aircrew members from inspected units who transit the AOR and/or bed-down in a chem-
      ical threat area during the exercise will possess a complete aircrew and ground crew chemical war-
      fare defense-training ensemble, as well as personal protective gear. However, transient aircrews
      do not need to bring chemical gear if they meet the following criteria. (a) They will be transiting
      the deployed site for the sole purpose of deploying or re-deploying EXERCISE forces. (b) They
      transit the deployed site on deployment, transition or redeployment days. (c) They do not plan to
      remain overnight. (d) They do not plan to leave the ramp/base operations area. If CWD ensemble
      is required, they must also carry two complete sets of plastic overcapes and plastic overboots. The
      standard CWU-27/P flight suit will replicate the CWU-66/P and 77/P integrated aircrew chemical
      coverall (IACC) for training/exercise purposes. Therefore, do not remove the IACC from the
      sealed container.
      3.5.7.2. If your unit is equipped with both types of chemical defense suits (CWU-66/P or 77/P and
      the MK-1 charcoal under coveralls); aircrews may be tasked to demonstrate aircrew chemical con-
      tamination control area (ACCA) processing for both types of suits. For a crewmember to simulate
26                                                 FAIRCHILDAFBI90-201 29 FEBRUARY 2004


     the CWU-66/P with the standard flight suit (CWU-27/P), he or she must have at least one
     CWU-66/P in their serviceable, real-world D-bag. If crewmembers are equipped with only MK-1
     under coveralls in their real world D-bag, they must deploy with training MK-1 under coveralls.
     3.5.7.3. A complete operational above-the-shoulder aircrew chemical defense equipment (ACDE)
     ensemble includes the following: HGU-55/P helmet (when required), MBU-13/P CBO mask,
     CRU-80/P filter pack, and HGU-41/P hood for the first generation ensemble. The aircrew eye res-
     piratory protection (AERP) ensemble will consist of the HGU-55/P helmet (when required),
     MBU-19/P AERPs hood/mask assembly, CQU-7/P AERPs blower unit with suspension straps,
     and the MXU-835/P AERPs intercom unit.
     3.5.7.4. A complete training below-the-shoulder ACDE ensemble includes the following: MK-1
     charcoal under coveralls, cotton undershirt, cotton drawers, flight suit, gloves and boots. The
     CWU-66/P or 77/P may be substituted for the charcoal under coveralls and the flight suit. In order
     to prevent unnecessary use of serviceable assets, "below-the-shoulder" training assets will be
     used.
     3.5.7.5. Commanders may authorize the use of the MCU-2/P-series ground crew mask with hood
     to simulate the MBU-19/P hood and mask assembly only. If the MCU-2/P mask is issued, crew-
     members must be prepared to demonstrate use of operational assets at the discretion of the XP
     inspector. If operational CRU-80/P filter packs are limited or vacuumed packed, the CRU-60/P
     connector or similar connector may be used.
     3.5.7.6. The XP/EET will task units to conduct launch/recovery operations during Condition
     Black, and demonstrate full ACDE suit-up and ACCA processing.
     3.5.7.7. Aircrew members performing non-flying duties or supporting ground operations (i.e.,
     planning team, preflight and loading teams, scheduling team, ramp coordinator, supervisor of fly-
     ing (SOF), etc.) will be issued the ground ensemble. These personnel, not scheduled for immedi-
     ate flying, will don the ground crew training ensemble consistent with the current MOPP level and
     process through the ground crew chemical decontamination line if exposed to chemicals.
     3.5.7.8. All aircrew personnel may be evaluated during ground operations (i.e., transiting to/from
     the aircraft, buddy dressing, ACCA operations, and decontamination procedures). To avoid chem-
     ical saturation and cross-contamination, ground personnel will not be processed through the
     ACCA. The ACCA is for aircrew use only.
     3.5.7.9. ACCA processing may be performed while wearing the standard CWU-27/P flight suit
     since they are nearly identical to the CWU-66/P or 77/P. Units possessing first-generation capabil-
     ity will be tasked to demonstrate ACCA processing while wearing the MK-1 charcoal under cov-
     eralls. Crewmembers will return all ACDE to life support immediately after the threat or exercise
     is terminated.
     3.5.7.10. When under attack (Alarm Red), crewmembers must take “immediate cover" and
     assume the appropriate MOPP level. If MOPP level 4, don the MCU-2/P-series ground crew mask
     and gloves. If outdoors or working at the aircraft, don the plastic overcape and boots to demon-
     strate capability, then remove the overcape (due to safety considerations).
     3.5.7.11. Members working at the aircraft must safely turn off aircraft systems and remove power
     before seeking shelter.
FAIRCHILDAFBI90-201 29 FEBRUARY 2004                                                                      27


      3.5.7.12. Prior to missions, aircraft, aircrews or maintenance personnel are not considered “out of
      play” unless released by an on-scene XP inspector.
      3.5.7.13. During Alarm Black/MOPP level-four conditions, and when safe to move from shelters,
      aircrew members ready to fly will report to the ACCA to change into their full ACDE. Be pre-
      pared to continue the launch process.
      3.5.7.14. Members engaged in preflight activities during Alarm Black, MOPP 4, may be permit-
      ted by an on-scene XP/EET inspector to remove the ground chemical mask during critical opera-
      tions and will re-don when these operations are complete. Members are permitted to remove their
      helmets when headset use is required. If communication is hindered to such an extent that pre-
      flight activities cannot be conducted safely, coordinate with the on-scene inspector to remove the
      mask at times not specified in these Ground Rules.
      3.5.7.15. If an XP/EET Inspector is not assigned to the mission, coordinate for one crewmember
      to remain on headset and ask the WOC for AOC (XP) instructions. If XP AOC directs to continue,
      remain on the aircraft and hold further actions until cleared by maintenance personnel sweeping
      the flight line. If XP AOC does not direct mission preflight actions to continue, the WOC will
      direct the crew to power down all aircraft systems, secure the aircraft, deplane in appropriate
      MOPP gear and seek appropriate cover.
      3.5.7.16. Aircraft required to land during increased readiness postures will contact command and
      control at the FOB for information and guidance. During Alarm Red, aircrew will hold or delay in
      the air consistent with ATC, weather, fuel requirements and safety. If aircraft are within 10 NM of
      landing, they may continue to a safe landing at the FOB during Alarm Red. Aircrew will not taxi
      into the exercise play area/parking ramp during Alarm Red, unless unable to gain permission for a
      ground holding point from the local ATC tower. If required to taxi to the exercise area during
      Alarm Red, crews will stop immediately after entering the ramp. They will not proceed to their
      parking spot until Alarm Black is declared and their path is cleared.
      3.5.7.17. Aircrews receiving increased readiness postures while airborne will be given 20 minutes
      after engine shutdown to don the ACDE for the current MOPP level. The aircrew will open the
      crew entry door if the on-scene inspector requests to get on board to evaluate donning procedures.
      3.5.7.18. Aircrew recovering during Alarm Black will accomplish maintenance/intelligence
      debriefing as required and IAW unit procedures developed for use in a toxic environment.

3.6. Aircrew Life Support.
   3.6.1. Due to a compressed exercise scenario, units will setup an ACCA facility as soon as they coor-
   dinate the location with the XP/EET life support inspector. If practical, the ACCA will be physically
   separated from the FOB. Proper coordination with the appropriate command and control authorities
   and the on-site life support inspector will be conducted prior to establishing the ACCA. For the pur-
   pose of complete evaluation, the ACCA will be considered a high-threat area and personnel will react
   to all attacks on the supported installation, including complete wear of CWDE, flak vests, helmets,
   and web gear. Personnel not properly responding to alarms may be designated casualties by the XP/
   EET. The ability to communicate with command and control agencies will be emphasized and evalu-
   ated.
   3.6.2. Units are expected to set-up complete life support facilities within the “play area” to support all
   aspects of the flying mission. This includes demonstrating the dispersal plan and the capability of
28                                                      FAIRCHILDAFBI90-201 29 FEBRUARY 2004


     inspecting and maintaining all assigned life support equipment. When flying activities dictate and
     staffing numbers allow, the life support operation will be manned 24 hours a day. Units with limited
     staffing levels will coordinate work timeframes with the XP/EET life support inspector.
     3.6.3. Do not deploy actual aircrew handguns to the FOB. Handgun issue and return procedures will
     be demonstrated at home station by those life support units responsible for issue and turn-in of aircrew
     weapons. Life support will continue weapons issue and turn-in at FOB simulating only the actual
     weapons. Clearing barrels and procedures must comply with established guidance.
     3.6.4. To effectively evaluate chemical warfare defense procedures, the XP/EET may task units to
     demonstrate a limited number of full ACDE donning and ACCA operations. To meet this require-
     ment, life support units will deploy a minimum of eight various-sized MBU-19/P AERP mask and
     hood assemblies, CQU-7/P blower units, and MXU-835/P intercommunication units.
     3.6.5. Aircrews should place all personal flight equipment and clothing in a bag during processing
     through the ACCA so it can be easily returned to them.
     3.6.6. Life support will not set up and operate any functions in designated “no play” areas (this
     includes issuing and receiving equipment in “no play” areas) at the FOB.
     3.6.7. The only standard simulation authorized for E&R kits is simulation of blood chits.

3.7. Maintenance.
     3.7.1. Do not send maintenance aircraft historical file jackets downrange. Unit maintenance person-
     nel will brief the XP/EET maintenance inspector on what historical records would be included in the
     jacket with each deploying aircraft.
     3.7.2. Maintenance personnel must test Mode 4 of the Identification, Friend or Foe (IFF) prior to each
     sortie to simulate overseas and all simulated in-theater sorties.
     3.7.3. The unit must coordinate the cannibalization of aircraft components from non-possessed air-
     craft, or any aircraft not available for the exercise, with an XP/EET inspector. When required, the unit
     must also receive approval from higher headquarters. Additionally, any component canned from pos-
     sessed aircraft must be coordinated with an XP/EET inspector.
     3.7.4. Upon arrival, the Maintenance Group will provide the XP/EET aircraft maintenance inspectors
     a home station radio, a listing of radio call signs, a current copy of all maintenance operating instruc-
     tions, a copy of the special certification roster and their emergency actions checklists. Prior to deploy-
     ment, provide a list of all deploying personnel, all support equipment by identification number and a
     radio with the deployed locations frequency.
     3.7.5. For units receiving initial readiness inspections, do not begin generating aircraft until XP/EET
     give approval. Normally this is done once XP/EET personnel arrive at the unit command post.

3.8. Logistics.
     3.8.1. For units receiving an initial readiness inspection, do not begin unit processing, marshaling or
     loading operations prior to the arrival of the inspection team chief or designated representative. The
     exception will be personnel having a valid crew rest requirement. Squadrons may assemble assets in
     their unit prior to XP/EET team arrival; however, do not create a centralized wing/group assembly or
     preassembly area until cleared by the XP/EET team.
FAIRCHILDAFBI90-201 29 FEBRUARY 2004                                                                 29


  3.8.2. Do not transfer equipment accountability to the FOB. Deployed equipment custodians will be
  agent of record and will need to do the custodian authorization/custody receipt listing (CA/CRL) but
  are not required to do a transfer.
  3.8.3. Accomplish exercise taskings using only assigned assets unless specifically authorized other-
  wise by XP/EET inspectors. The unit will process, marshal and load all tasked personnel/equipment to
  meet scheduled deployment/redeployment flow and closure times.
  3.8.4. All ADVON personnel and equipment will apply against tasked UTCs.
  3.8.5. Do not deploy operational C and E mobility bags to the FOB. Units may tailor operational A
  and B bags to support climatic conditions as well as lodging and messing requirements at the FOB or
  FOL. Units will be required to demonstrate the capability to issue operational bags to deploying
  forces. All designed operational capability (DOC)-tasked bags and required backup stocks are subject
  to inspection for serviceability and accountability of contents. Minimum items for A-Bag will be
  listed in the AMT. A-Bag items do not need to be carried in a bag.
  3.8.6. Prior to the aircraft departing for the FOL/FOB, the cargo deployment function (CDF) must
  ensure the aircraft commander’s package contains the air outbound manifest diskette.
  3.8.7. Plan to use AMC Omnibus OPLAN Format for LOGSTAT reporting but do not transmit. Brief-
  ing the report to XP/EET AOC will simulate transmission.
  3.8.8. Deploy what is needed to support the operations for three to four days. Do not deploy 45 days
  worth of spare parts. The EXERCISE CONOPS and OPORD will identify equipment available at the
  deployed location. UTC LOGDET equipment that is needed to support the operation that is in excess
  of what is available (pre-positioned) should be brought by the tasked UTCs. UTCs tasked with “stan-
  dard” equipment packages are normally those who have specialized equipment that is not available at
  the FOL. These will be indicated in the AMT.
  3.8.9. The deploying AEW is responsible for identifying individuals on unit ADVON(s) to accept
  accountability for vehicles/equipment, munitions, rations, facilities and miscellaneous pre-positioned
  items. Members identified should be prepared to inventory and sign for these items.
  3.8.10. Provide the logistics plans XP/EET inspector with the following documentation:
     3.8.10.1. One copy of each AMT
     3.8.10.2. One copy of the final Deployment Schedule of Events (DSOE), which includes all
     scheduled and actual times
     3.8.10.3. One copy of all passenger manifests, cargo manifests and final load plans.
     3.8.10.4. One copy of each deployment-related message sent
     3.8.10.5. One copy of the tailored LOGPLAN file along with a summary of your deployment
     tasking which includes total short tons deployed and total personnel deployed
     3.8.10.6. One copy of the LOGMOD LOGBOOK and any other event logs produced in the DCC
     3.8.10.7. A copy of deployed equipment CA/CRL
  3.8.11. Deployed unit(s) will strictly adhere to unit policy and guidance on vehicle and equipment
  issue, receipt and turn-in procedures.
30                                                      FAIRCHILDAFBI90-201 29 FEBRUARY 2004


     3.8.12. All deployed units will coordinate with Ground Transportation XP/EET inspection personnel
     prior to procuring any parts or materials outside of the host nation bench stock capabilities.
     3.8.13. Deployed unit(s) will be responsible for all vehicles and equipment damages incurred during
     the accountability period.
     3.8.14. AFSC Substitutions. The following AFSC substitutions require no XP/EET team coordination
     or approval: those allowed IAW AFI 10-403, Deployment Planning and Execution, para 5.1.2. , those
     authorized specifically in the UTC Mission Capability Statement (MISCAP), and those authorized
     IAW published Functional Manager guidance. However, any AFSC substitutions outside of those
     described above or deviations from the number of personnel to be tasked in each UTC as reflected in
     the appropriate XP/EET participants messages must be submitted with justification to the XP/EET
     team for review and approval/disapproval.

3.9. Prime Base Emergency Engineering Forces (Prime BEEF).
     3.9.1. Unit Civil Engineers should be prepared to provide XP/EET inspectors copies of checklists,
     handouts, booklets and plans upon request.
     3.9.2. Do not isolate systems or turn off utilities unless specifically directed to do so by an on-scene
     XP inspector.
     3.9.3. The XP/EET inspector will meet with Unit Civil Engineer representatives to acquaint the team
     with the locations of facilities, materials, resources and exercise area boundaries
     3.9.4. Facility Damage. Damage Assessment Teams will be provided an input card with detailed dam-
     age. If an XP/EET Inspector is not available to meet the damage assessment team on site, a dam-
     age-input card labeled “FOR DAMAGE ASSESSMENT TEAM USE ONLY” will be posted at the
     main entrance. The damage-input card may not be removed from the facility. Once a Bill of Materials
     (BOM) is completed for repair of the facility and presented to the CE XP/EET inspector, a time for
     return of the facility will be determined unless the facility is taken out of play permanently.
     3.9.5. Airfield Damage. A “strip” to conduct airfield damage assessment will be identified to the par-
     ticipants. Orange traffic cones will denote all damage. Two cones placed side by side will be used to
     mark the center of a crater. The diameter of the crater will be noted on a placard attached to these
     cones. Four single cones will denote spall and bomblet fields. Each cone will represent a corner of the
     field. A placard will be attached to one corner cone denoting the number of spalls or bomblets. The
     Civil Engineer XP/EET Inspector will provide any additional damage or inputs necessary for Mini-
     mum Operating Strip (MOS) selection. A Civil Engineer XP/EET Inspector may not be present at the
     site. If the inspector is not present, the team may proceed with its assessment without delay. If no
     cones are placed, no damage has resulted to the airfield.
     3.9.6. Work Orders. Execution of work orders to support the Host Nation (home station), as provided
     by the XP/EET, will constitute a graded portion of the inspection. Any materials, equipment or tools
     required but not available in the deployed tool kits will be provided by the Host Nation (home station
     CES). Host Nation (home station CES) personnel will serve as quality inspectors for all work accom-
     plished. Once a work order or orders have been received from the Civil Engineer XP/EET Inspector,
     the deployed team may directly interface with Host Nation (home station CES) representative to gain
     access to sites, equipment, tools and vehicles. Host Nation (home station CES) personnel will be
     solely responsible for approving changes in work scope or design and serve as the technical expert for
FAIRCHILDAFBI90-201 29 FEBRUARY 2004                                                                      31


   questions and problems. The Civil Engineer XP/EET Inspector will negotiate with the deployed unit
   to balance scenario integrity with real-world safety and work requirements.

3.10. Readiness.
   3.10.1. The XP/EET inspector will provide chemical monitoring results to unit personnel as appropri-
   ate after monitoring times have elapsed.
   3.10.2. Do not "burn" an M256 kit unless directed by an XP/EET inspector. If an XP/EET inspector
   is not present, all results will be reported as negative (no chemicals present) after the appropriate mon-
   itoring time has elapsed.
   3.10.3. Limit all disaster response force activities (i.e., establishment of an on-scene control point,
   halting traffic, etc.) to the play area unless otherwise directed by the XP/EET inspector.
   3.10.4. Water will be used to simulate all decontamination solutions and sand will be used to simulate
   all decontamination absorbents.
   3.10.5. Two-inch masking tape or magnetic strips will simulate M-8 paper and M-9 tape. The tape
   will be marked as either M-8 or M-9. Do not use tape on vehicles, only use magnetic strips for M-8 or
   M-9.
   3.10.6. Do not dig trenches along aircraft operating surfaces; however, plans and procedures to do so
   must be available. Mark UXO holding areas with stakes and flagging ribbon.
   3.10.7. Blackout Procedures. For vehicles and equipment, place a single strip of 2-inch magnetic
   strips marked "Blackout" on all appropriate areas. Do not affix tape to any vehicle surface. For facili-
   ties, complete a full blackout of one (1) window and the main entrance with whatever appropriate
   materials on hand or that can be procured. The remaining facility entrance and windows may be sim-
   ulated blacked-out by posting or taping a paper marked “BLACKOUT” to the window or entrance.
   3.10.8. Hardening Demonstrations. The AEW will be tasked with one hardening demonstration to be
   constructed with a minimum of (or no) simulations. Sandbags may be used in the demonstration only
   with the approval of the Support Group XP/EET Inspector. See CE Annex to Base Support Plan on the
   AMC XP Website for materials available on site or procurable in the local area. The demonstration
   must be properly designed and of sufficient dimensions to meet mission requirements. The Mission
   Support Group XP/EET Inspector must approve any simulations in the demonstration. The location of
   the demonstration and item to be hardened will be chosen at random from a list of 10 Inspector Gen-
   eral-selected candidates during the inspection. Demonstrations will be constructed with multifunc-
   tional teams as directed by the XP/EET. The unit must maintain the integrity of the demonstration
   throughout the inspection.
   3.10.9. Hardening Simulations. All hardening simulations should reflect hardening plan priorities and
   will be assessed as part of the inspection process for design, structural integrity and layout. An item
   (facility, vehicle, equipment item, etc) is considered simulated hardened when a properly constructed
   sandbag corner is erected for one corner of the hardening layout. The corner erected will be consid-
   ered a segment of the actual sandbag wall surrounding the item. The corner must be a minimum of
   three feet long on each wing as measured along the inside dimension. The height and thickness of the
   assembled corner will be considered the height and thickness of the entire sandbag wall (i.e. a four
   foot high, two foot thick corner simulates a four foot high wall, two foot thick). The boundaries of the
   rest of the sandbag wall will be simulated with a single strand of surveyor’s tape. If overhead protec-

     tion is included as part of the simulation, post a sign on the sandbag corner with “OVERHEAD PRO-
     TECTION PROVIDED” clearly printed. These simulation rules do not apply to Security Force
     Defensive Fighting Positions (DFPs). Each Security Force UTC will be required to erect one fully
     protected defensive fighting position capable of meeting the expected threat or situation. Remaining
     DFPs may be simulated in a manner as directed by the Security Force Inspectors. Units must maintain
     the integrity of all simulations throughout the inspection.
     3.10.10. An XP/EET inspector must review the unit’s plan and approve all selected sites before the
     CCA is erected.
     3.10.11. All UTCs with equipment packages will complete one contamination avoidance (CA) dem-
     onstration.
     3.10.12. Non-air-conditioned facilities (to include tents), aircraft, and vehicles may have their win-
     dows, doors or flaps open during alarm conditions yellow and black and during increased FPCONs.
     Any entrance kept open must be controlled and marked as simulated closed or blocked. However, if
     unit members use the simulated blocked entrances, then opposing forces (OPFOR) may also use the
     entrances, and if contamination is present, the facility, vehicle or aircraft is subject to contamination.
     3.10.13. NBC Plotting Maps. Deploying readiness teams will bring the appropriate scale maps (e.g.
     1:50, 1:250) for NBC plotting. If maps of the scenario area of operations are not available, other maps
     may be used. The XP/EET Readiness Inspector will coordinate with the deployed team to adapt the
     map to ensure it meets the needs of the inspection.

3.11. Fire Protection.
     3.11.1. The senior military firefighter assigned to the fire protection flight will deploy as the fire
     chief. Exception: when the base fire chief is military, the next most senior military firefighter may fill
     the role of the deployed fire chief, active duty only.
     3.11.2. Coaching from local/in-place firefighters will not be permitted.
     3.11.3. Each firefighter will deploy with a complete set of aluminized protective clothing.
     3.11.4. Two P-19s, one P-18, and one P-20, based on host nation support and aircraft maximum on the
     ground (MOG) is the standard deployed vehicle set for an exercise. These vehicles and associated
     manpower will not be used for non-exercise support activities without XP/EET approval. Adjustments
     to vehicles and staffing due to real-world events will be coordinated through the XP/EET fire protec-
     tion inspector.
     3.11.5. The fire station will not be used as a dispersal location except during periods of inclement
     weather, or when approved by the XP/EET due to real-world fire protection requirements.
     3.11.6. One structural pumper (host nation support) may be available for exercises. The pumper may
     be housed in the fire station; however, it will be cross-manned by deployed firefighters.
     3.11.7. Hose line operations on all exercises will include one wet line (discharging water) to show
     capability prior to entering a building or aircraft with one or more dry lines.
     3.11.8. One firefighter on each deployed/dispersed firefighting vehicle will wear aluminized protec-
     tive clothing in lieu of the ground crew ensemble. Firefighters responding to all real-world emergen-
     cies will not wear body armor.
FAIRCHILDAFBI90-201 29 FEBRUARY 2004                                                                   33


   3.11.9. Firefighters deploying with J-Fire CWDE will simulate wearing the silver pants during all
   MOPP conditions. Prior to engaging in firefighting operations, whether exercise or real world, fire-
   fighters will don all appropriate firefighting protective clothing over the J-Fire CWDE.
   3.11.10. Firefighters will wear self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) equipment during all fire
   response exercises. Firefighters will remove SCBA prior to entering the flight deck of large-frame air-
   craft, and then simulate wear once completed with flight deck operations.
   3.11.11. Personnel being removed during aircrew extraction exercises will be taken to the top of the
   ladder or stairs, be allowed to climb or walk down, and then will again resume their simulated inca-
   pacitated status.
   3.11.12. Simulate the use of aqueous film forming foam (AFFF) or dry chemical agents. The first
   arriving aircraft rescue fire fighting (ARFF) vehicle will demonstrate capability by discharging water
   on approach. Discharge in a manner to avoid the aircraft and nearby equipment.
   3.11.13. Simulate forcing locked doors by bringing required tools to the door to show the capability.

3.12. Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD).
   3.12.1. Real-world mobility munitions will not be expended during the inspection. However, a 100
   percent joint inspection may be accomplished. The Munitions Storage Area will be considered the dis-
   persal site for all mobility munitions once marshaled through the deployment process at home station.
   3.12.2. Training munitions listed in AMCI 90-201, Attachment 4, must be onhand at the deployed
   location. Simulate EXRODS, C4, FLEX, or other explosives with a 1’ - 3’ length of detonating cord.
   The EOD XP/EET inspector must be on site and approve all explosive operations. EOD teams are
   responsible for controlling the immediate area during all explosive/recovery operations.
   3.12.3. Projectiles will be removed from all non-electric .50 caliber cartridges.
   3.12.4. All DAT with EOD technicians and UXO teams will have at least three loaded field-fabricated
   de-armors (FFD) prepared at all times (except for caps). Fully loaded FFDs using plaster of paris
   (POP) slugs will be utilized at the discretion of the EOD XP/EET inspector. A minimum of 10 POP
   slugs will be prepared.

3.13. Prime Readiness in Base Services (RIBS).
   3.13.1. Prime RIBS teams will establish and operate a control center in the exercise area.
   3.13.2. A Mortuary Control Center (morgue) will be established in the exercise area. Lead services
   team is responsible to bring mortuary kit. Prime Ribs mortuary personnel will process all remains to
   include simulated storage, reporting procedures and transportation or temporary internment.
   3.13.3. XP/EET services inspector will provide operational ration forecast/order to HQ Air Force Ser-
   vices Agency and A-rations forecast to the applicable home station services representative.
   3.13.4. The deployed services team is responsible to bring all field accounting forms, account for all
   meals, and at the end of the exercise, transfer/turn-in unused food rations. Reconciliation/turn-in of
   funds must be turned into the respective units accounting and finance office. All accounting docu-
   ments must be completed and turned in with their end of the month reports and sent to HQ AMC/SVA,
   503 Ward Drive, Suite 203, Scott AFB, IL 62225.

     will be inside the play area. Unit members who have signed/paid for their meal are not required to
     react to ATSO/Inspection inputs. They will receive their meal and continue into the dining area and
     complete their meal. One server must be pre-designated as safety representative. The SVS safety team
     member will not don protective equipment and continue to feed whoever has paid for/signed for their
     meal. He/she will also monitor all field-feeding equipment (M-2 burners, immersion heaters and
     M-59 field range). All other personnel in the play area (including food service personnel) are expected
     to respond to alarms/threats.
     3.13.6. Deployed units will serve at least two hot meals per day during the time period the main body
     is deployed. Unitized Group Rations (UGRs) may be used for the first and/or last meals at the FOB
     only. MREs will be used when hot meals are not available.
     3.13.7. Initially, the inspected unit may be allowed full use of the dining facility. However, the SV
     XP/EET inspector will challenge units to demonstrate field-feeding equipment usage. All units must
     demonstrate their ability to use the baking cooking method using the M-59 field range. Units may set
     up a field kitchen to prepare and serve their meals. The Services Inspector must approve NON-LOG-
     DET electrical equipment.
     3.13.8. Prime Ribs lodging personnel will use the AFSVA approved lodging software. Deployed Ser-
     vices team is responsible to bring laptop computer and lodging administration kit. A tabletop briefing
     will be presented to the Services inspector detailing plans for expansion. The lodging office will be
     located inside the play area. Lodging quarters are designated “no-play” areas.
     3.13.9. XP/EET will task the executive agent or lead services team to setup a field exchange. AAFES
     POCs will also be provided to the executive agent. The responsible agent will receive/verify inven-
     tory, supplies, invoices and change funds from the AAFES facility. The unit will also be responsible
     to resupply merchandise from the AAFES facility, provide security, inventory controls and receive
     change funds. The respective services units must transfer, reconcile funds and accounting documents
     and turn in unsold merchandise prior to departure.
     3.13.10. Deployed Services team is responsible to bring a recreation kit. A tabletop briefing will be
     presented to the Services inspector detailing plans for a 180-day deployment. The recreation tent/
     activity can be placed inside or outside the exercise area at unit’s discretion.

3.14. Security Forces.
     3.14.1. Defendable Perimeter: The Security Force team will receive the location of their defendable
     perimeter from the Security Forces Inspection Team upon arrival.
     3.14.2. Attacks or hostile acts, initiated either inside or outside the base perimeter, will be countered.
     3.14.3. Firepower may be brought to bear upon a retreating aggressor. However, Air Force personnel
     will not pursue beyond the base perimeter.
     3.14.4. Exercise armed personnel who fail to halt when challenged or who display hostile intentions
     (OPFOR) may be engaged by fire. Warning shots will not be fired.
     3.14.5. Mobility munitions will not be palletized or brought to the play box.
     3.14.6. The host nation forbids the presence of, or use of, claymore mines, hand grenades, and LAW
     rockets. For safety reasons, do not use real-world trip flares or booby traps. Do not deploy them to the
FAIRCHILDAFBI90-201 29 FEBRUARY 2004                                                                    35


   exercise. Units may use non-pyrotechnic early warning devices. If used, SF XP/EET personnel will
   validate them for safety prior to allowing their use in the field.
   3.14.7. If a conflict arises between American and host nation personnel within the defended perime-
   ter, detain the individual and request a host nation liaison officer (security forces EET/inspector).
   3.14.8. While performing their duties, security forces personnel will not wear reflective belts or
   reflective vests. Real-world security personnel will not be subject to any XP/EET exercise scenario.
   Real-world security personnel will not be in the play box at anytime unless responding to a real-world
   security event.
   3.14.9. Enemy Prisoner of War (EPW) Procedures: Once U.S. forces have completed all processing/
   questioning actions, the EPW will be turned over to host nation police forces (a security forces inspec-
   tor) for further disposition.
   3.14.10. 92 SFS EET will dictate the use of MILES equipment for security forces personnel. Three to
   six additional M-16s, 120 rounds of blank 5.56mm ammo with magazines and MILES equipment per
   weapon will be deployed for EET use (see exercise AMT for specific details on required equipment).
   3.14.11. The simulated use of the M-203 grenade launcher will be permitted. The grenadier will
   explain use of battle sight, target location and distance. Permission to utilize a 40mm must be directed
   by the deployed unit’s control center IAW local base rules of engagement.
   3.14.12. A deployed equipment listing and a weapons qualification listing will be provided to the
   security forces EET inspector.
   3.14.13. At the FOB, requests for additional equipment not on the LOGDET must be procured
   through deployed contracting. The XP/EET contracting inspector must review all documents. Use of
   additional equipment will be determined based on availability of requested items.
   3.14.14. Perimeter defense measures can be established. However, these restrictive devices should
   not hamper real-world emergency response and evacuation. The SF/EET inspector must approve
   placement and materials before construction of defensive barriers. The use of concertina wire will be
   simulated by the use of surveyor’s tape.
   3.14.15. All deployed members will be briefed and follow their Operating Instruction (OI) on “Secu-
   rity Forces Exercises, Standards, and Procedures.” If there are any questions about this or other weap-
   ons safety procedures, an XP/EET SF person will clarify at the deployed location.
   3.14.16. OPFOR/Aggressor Ground Rules.
      3.14.16.1. XP/EET inspectors will not aid OPFOR during exercise scenarios.
      3.14.16.2. If an inspector is not present when OPFOR are apprehended, OPFOR are authorized to
      call time out if injured or for safety reasons.
      3.14.16.3. OPFOR/aggressors will be briefed on ground rules by SF/EET inspectors.

3.15. Communications.
   3.15.1. All communication UTCs must be able to install, relocate, remove or reconstitute/restore
   secure/non-secure voice and data communications systems where no services presently exist, are of a
   limited nature or lack support required to conduct deployed AMC mobility operations. Must be able
   to support current operations and respond to new or changing customer requirements by modifying

     the infrastructure. Provide communications and computer support to mission functions. Sustain com-
     binations of equipment, people, procedures and other resources.
     3.15.2. Communication UTCs that do not have equipment but are DOC tasked to support it, such as
     6KTAJ and 6KVA9, will be provided with equipment from the home station, another unit or a combi-
     nation of the two.
     3.15.3. Units will not request frequencies/call-signs from the TACC. All frequency requests must go
     through AMC IG Communication section. The C2SID will be published approximately five days
     prior to deployment.
     3.15.4. Table 3.1. is a list of frequencies and phone lines that will be available at the deployed loca-
     tion. See C2SID for details.

     3.15.5. Requests for “simulated secure” communications are disapproved.
     3.15.6. All requests for Host Nation communications must be directed through the XP/EET commu-
     nication inspector.
     3.15.7. Use of frequency scanners is prohibited throughout the inspection.
     3.15.8. XP/EET communication inspectors must approve the use of any Host Nation communication
     equipment/assets.

3.16. Medical.
     3.16.1. 92 MDG may be tasked to provide real world medical coverage for wing exercises. Whenever
     possible, 92 MDG will supply this coverage. The 92 MDG/CC will determine the assets required for
     the exercise scenario and manpower deployed.
FAIRCHILDAFBI90-201 29 FEBRUARY 2004                                                                    37


   3.16.2. Real-world medical support will limit the quantity of medical equipment and supplies for use
   in treating real-world casualties to what is deemed essential. Climatic conditions, location, and num-
   bers of deployed personnel will dictate quantity and type of medical supplies. Units should plan to
   treat minor injuries and illnesses without assistance of local medical units and should endeavor to
   return members to EORI participation as soon as possible.
   3.16.3. Real-world medical personnel will provide prompt ambulance coverage within the “play
   box.” Deployed elements within the “play box” will develop a communication plan for requesting
   real-world medical response. Additionally, the senior medical person at the deployed location will
   establish an emergency action plan with local civilian and military medical facilities, in case further
   medical support is needed.
   3.16.4. Real-world medical personnel at the deployed location will not react to exercise scenarios or
   wear chemical ensembles. Whenever possible, real world medical coverage personnel will reside in
   the local community. However, if the exercise is off-base in an austere location, coverage personnel
   may be required to billet and mess under the same conditions as the exercising units.
   3.16.5. Do not give AOR-specific immunizations. Units must show the plan they would implement to
   obtain sufficient quantities of AOR-specific immunizations in the event of a contingency. It is only
   required to administer routine mobility immunizations that are overdue or will come due during the
   actual EORI dates. If some normal mobility shots cannot be given on the processing line due to fund-
   ing or other constraints, explain this to the lead medical inspector. Immunizations personnel will
   maintain a log of individuals requiring vaccinations.
   3.16.6. Do not deploy actual medical records due to potential for loss or damage. Instead, deploy cop-
   ies of the medical information required IAW AFI 10-403, paragraph 1.5.18.2.
   3.16.7. Narcotics will not be deployed to the FOB (except for real-world medical coverage). Each
   UTC that would use narcotics will simulate them by using a container marked as narcotics. Personnel
   will use standard accounting and securing measures.
   3.16.8. All equipment and supplies brought to the AOR will be listed on the UTC’s allowance stan-
   dard and will be operational. Submit simulation requests for all perishable supplies or sensitive equip-
   ment that will not be used or substituted.

3.17. Personnel.
   3.17.1. Personnel will deploy with identification tags/cards and shot records. Medical and chaplain
   personnel will also deploy with Geneva Convention Cards.
   3.17.2. Except as indicated below, personnel will not deploy with passports; Career Development
   Course materials; AF Form 623A, On-the-Job Training Record -Continuation Sheet; or unit headgear.
   3.17.3. Contracting and Comptroller personnel are required to bring passports.
   3.17.4. Assume stop loss has been implemented.
   3.17.5. Extension of enlistment and/or reenlistment of personnel, whose ETS falls within the deploy-
   ment time period, may be simulated. Personnel readiness function (PRF) or deployment processing
   unit (DPU) must show proof the individual requiring retainability was identified and the type of
   retainability the individual would have received.

     3.17.6. The PRF may produce, as a minimum, five contingency, exercise and deployment (CED)
     orders per person. An example of one NATO order must be provided for exercises that would require
     the completion of an actual NATO order. The NATO order provided need only be prepared, not pub-
     lished (e.g., no number/date/seal). If the readiness office completed an actual NATO order during the
     fiscal year for an actual deployment, a copy of that order will suffice for this requirement.
     3.17.7. The MPF will ensure appropriate statements are included in the remark section of the CED
     orders, IAW AFI 10-215, Personnel Support for Contingency Operations (PERSCO). In addition to
     the actual length of the deployment and field conditions statements include the following statements
     in the CED: “Officers must pay the discount rate plus surcharge (in cash) for meals. No large bills
     (greater than 20 dollars) will be accepted. Enlisted personnel will have the discounted meal rate
     deducted from their pay at their home station. No per diem authorized during period of field duty.”
     3.17.8. EVERY MPF: Please provide a package marked “XP/EET PERSONNEL INSPECTOR” con-
     taining the items listed below. Deliver the package to the troop commander of the final deploying
     chalk from your base, who will in-turn deliver the package (along with the personnel accountability
     kit) to the PERSCO. (NOTE: If your deployment process (MPF PRF/DPU) is not being inspected,
     provide an IG package containing only orders (paragraph 20.7.1.) along with a memo stating which
     deployment requirements were not filled. The memo must include a list of ULN/POS number (in
     alphabetical order) and TDY AFSC that was not filled and the reason the position was not filled.
     Include any approved AMC 188s in the package.)
        3.17.8.1. One copy of contingency orders, amendments or revocations, and NATO order as appro-
        priate.
        3.17.8.2. Deployment requirements document sorted by chalk then last name.
        3.17.8.3. A mismatch roster containing required AFSC, control AFSC, primary AFSC, secondary
        AFSC, name, unit line number/position number.
        3.17.8.4. One copy of any deployment waiver letters.
        3.17.8.5. A copy of all approved AMC Forms 188 that pertain to personnel issues or changes the
        deployment requirements.
        3.17.8.6. One copy of every message or report produced by the PRF.
        3.17.8.7. A copy of the completed deployment requirements document (DRD) and personnel files
        on disk.
        3.17.8.8. A copy of discrepancies with name and unit.
     3.17.9. If an employment manning document is not flowed, the readiness office must produce a suit-
     able substitute and provide it to deployed personnel team for their use. PRFs must notify the PERSCO
     team of any changes to the deployment plan. Telephoning or faxing a copy of the changes is sufficient.
     3.17.10. PERSCO may deploy with minimum supplies necessary for actual length of deployment. An
     inspector at home station will review the remaining supply kit.
     3.17.11. PERSCO must develop a method to maintain real-world strength accountability as well as
     strength accountability for exercise casualties.
FAIRCHILDAFBI90-201 29 FEBRUARY 2004                                                                  39


      3.17.11.1. PERSCO will not update duty status for any casualties. Updates will be simulated. The
      XP/EET inspector will advise PERSCO specifically how to manually account for exercise casual-
      ties and also how long a casualty is "dead," as events occur during the exercise.
      3.17.11.2. PERSCO must develop a method to account for transient inter-theater aircrews remain-
      ing overnight, even if they are billeted off-site. Three possible ways this can be done: 1. TALCE/
      MST to gets aircrew orders and coordinates with PERSCO. 2. Maintenance personnel meeting the
      aircraft get a copy of aircrew orders, or 3. Aircrew checks into the base via the WOC. Other solu-
      tions are possible.
      3.17.11.3. Unit will determine PERSCO procedures to be used by personnel arriving and depart-
      ing the EXERCISE via commercial air. Itinerary for personnel arriving via commercial air or any
      method other than military air must be provided to the PERSCO at least 24 hours before the indi-
      viduals scheduled arrival.
      3.17.11.4. PERSCO must maintain a daily listing with the following information: daily total of
      active duty, guard and reserve personnel report. The following is an example of how the informa-
      tion should be reported.




      3.17.11.5. Once all personnel have been accounted for and prior to departure of all deployed per-
      sonnel, PERSCO must provide a roster in Excel format containing; Name, Grade, TDY AFSC,
      and PAS to the XP/EET inspector on all personnel.
   3.17.12. The secure data device will be fully utilized by PERSCOs and PRFs. Passwords must be
   obtained well before an inspection. Active duty units must contact AMC/DPXCP, for red-mini
   requirements several months before the start of their inspection.

3.18. Contracting/Comptroller.
   3.18.1. For exercise purposes, the higher authority for comptroller and the head of contracting agency
   for contracting is the contracting XP/EET inspector.
   3.18.2. Comptroller units may pare and tailor their LOGDET kit.
   3.18.3. Contracting will develop a contingency continuity book based on a long-term presence.
   3.18.4. Contracting officers will select procurement instruments based on short-term immediate mis-
   sion essential needs.
   3.18.5. Based on real world and simulated acquisitions, contracting and comptroller functions will
   balance accounts at least daily. A total cumulative report of both real world and simulated expendi-

                               WING SIMULATION PROCEDURES

4.1. General. The information below outlines the process that will be used to submit AMC Form 188,
(simulation form) for local exercises and AMC IG inspections.
   4.1.1. The group readiness offices will collect simulations from their groups. Ensure SQ/CC reviews
   the simulations before getting GP/CC signature. Use the standard format (AMC Form 188) sent out by
   Wing Readiness.
   4.1.2. The simulations will then be submitted to Wing Readiness.
       4.1.2.1. They will have the original GP/CC signature.
       4.1.2.2. Those not in the standard format will be returned for correction.
   4.1.3. Wing Readiness will review the simulations and get WG/CV approval.
   4.1.4. WG/CV-approved simulations will be briefed to WG/CC for approval at the CAT.
   4.1.5. The original copies will be kept in the CAT.
   4.1.6. Copies of the WG/CC-approved simulations will then be given to the group CAT/CSS repre-
   sentatives and XPL. One copy of the simulations will be given to Wing Readiness for EET reference.
   4.1.7. Once approved, the simulations (with corrections/amendments from WG/CV) will be sent elec-
   tronically to XPOT for posting on the web site.

4.2. Suspense. For exercises the simulations must be at Wing Readiness seven days before the exercise
starts.

                                                 Chapter 5

                                  UNIT COMPLIANCE INSPECTION

5.1. General. A Unit Compliance Inspection (UCI) is an assessment of both Common Core Compliance
Areas and Mission Areas. Federal law mandates the inspection of Common Core Compliance Areas such
as Voting Assistance, Intelligence Oversight, and Sexual Harassment Education and Prevention. Failure
to comply in these areas can lead to serious lawsuits and heavy fines. Mission Areas are processes identi-
fied by senior Air Force and MAJCOM leadership that are critical or important to the health and perfor-
mance of organizations. Some examples of Mission Areas are: Aircrew Protection, Installation Security,
Personnel, and the Self-Inspection (SI) program. Visit the AMC/IG web site to view the areas that pertain
to our command. Normally, a UCI will be conducted on a three-year basis by the AMC/IG for active duty
units; the 92 ARW conducts its UCI inspections in the months of May and November each year to ensure
compliance.
     5.1.1. Some Mission Areas affect numerous functional areas and others are functional area specific.
     In other words, depending on which Mission Areas it is, it could affect one squadron, three or even the
     entire wing. The SI program falls into the category of affecting many individual functional areas. It is
     likely there is more than one SI checklist per squadron. This is the reason why some squadrons are
     required to complete a UCI Mission Area checklist, an SI checklist, and the 92 ARW Squadron UCI
     checklist. The latter checklist was designed to incorporate portions of Mission Area checklists, which
     affect numerous areas. Other squadrons may not have a Mission Area checklist specific to them, so
     they may accomplish fewer checklists. Some UCI Mission Area checklists are the same as the SI
     checklist. This is solely the design of the MAJCOM functional manager. This is not the case for every
     functional. The UCI/SI checklists can differ dramatically because they can address different opera-
     tions in the same functional area. To fulfill the requirements for meeting inspection guidelines, each
     functional will need to visit the AMC/IG web site and check for both the UCI and SI checklists that
     pertain to their functional area or squadron. This is the best way to gain knowledge of the require-
     ments for the squadron and effectively meet UCI guidelines.
     5.1.2. The 92 ARW manages the UCI program by way of UCI Functional Managers. Each Functional
     Manager is assigned to either a By-Law or Mission Area checklist. This assignment was based on
     their area of expertise and the UCI checklist criteria. UCI Functional Managers serve as points of con-
     tact in regard to UCI matters such as: completion, continuity, training and by conducting squadron
     external inspections to ensure processes are being followed. For more specific guidance dealing with
     the UCI program refer to 0, The Wing Inspection Program. Below are general responsibilities dealing
     with the UCI Program outlined in AMCI 90-201.

5.2. Responsibilities. Inspected Unit Responsibilities:
     5.2.1. Have required program material and/or personnel available during the inspection period.
     5.2.2. Complete UCI checklists prior to IG team arrival. Copies of current UCI checklists and other
     information are available from HQ AMC/IG web site.

5.3. Corrective Actions. Units that receive a Marginal or Unsatisfactory grade for any given By-Law
areas, Mission Areas, or sub-areas must take immediate action to correct discrepancies. The inspected

unit commander must submit a corrective action plan to the Wing Commander via XPI two weeks prior to
the official AMC/IGCY suspense. If AMC will reinspect the area, XPI will notify the effected unit.

                                    SELF-INSPECTION PROGRAM

6.1. General. Self-Inspections are directed by AMC for unit commanders to focus on high priority items
of interest within their functional area of responsibility. Self-Inspection (SI) checklists provide command-
ers with a tool to assess unit health and compliment other inspection programs. AMC directed that SIs be
conducted on a semiannual basis; the 92 ARW fulfills this requirement by conducting SIs in the months
of May and November each year.
     6.1.1. For a SI program to effectively work it needs to be properly managed. The wing accomplishes
     this by appointing squadron, group and wing Self-Inspection Managers (SIM). A SIM is a point of
     contact in regard to SI completion, continuity, training and ensuring established processes are in place
     for a particular squadron, group or wing. Overall responsibility for the SI program does reside with
     commanders at all levels however, it is the SIMs duty to effectively manage the program. To ensure
     continuity, commanders appoint their respective SIM in writing to their group and the Wing Inspec-
     tions office. The most important task the SIM has is meeting the SI program requirements listed in
     AFI 90-201, AMCI 90- 201, and this instruction.
     6.1.2. To begin the SI process, first visit the AMC/IG web site. The AMC web site provides all the
     AMC SI checklists for the various functional areas. Locate pertinent functional areas to gain access to
     the checklists that pertain to the unit. If it is unclear which checklists pertain, contact the functional
     manager or Wing Inspections. Any effective inspection program starts with accurate data, so ensure
     your checklists are up-to-date. Complete each SI checklist for the unit, record the results and monitor
     discrepancy completion. A minor discrepancy can be corrected at the squadron level. Ensure all minor
     discrepancies are tracked for your squadron and reported to the respective group SIM for review. A
     significant discrepancy requires wing, 18 AF or AMC resources. Squadron and Group SIMs ensure
     significant SI discrepancies are elevated to the 92 ARW/XPI office for review with the 92 ARW/CV.
     For further guidance on managing a squadron SI program refer to 0, The Wing Inspection Program.
     Below are general responsibilities dealing with the SI program listed in AMCI 90-201.

6.2. Responsibilities: Unit Responsibilities:
     6.2.1. Units will accomplish applicable SI checklists every May and November.
     6.2.2. Units will up channel issues requiring HQ assistance to XPI.
     6.2.3. XPI will have units accomplish an SI within six months of a new Wg/CC taking command and
     forward the results to 18 AF.

                                     SPECIAL INTEREST ITEMS

7.1. General. The purpose of a Special Interest Item (SII) is to determine the extent and impact of known
or suspected problems, identify specific deficiencies, or to confirm a problem has been resolved. The
Wing Inspections office will receive a notification via proper communication channels, notify the affected
agencies of the SII of what actions to take and provide all pertinent information. Affected units are
required to track and report progress on a regular basis to their respective groups and the Wing Inspections
office. See 0, The Wing Inspection Program for additional guidance.

7.2. Corrective Actions. Units that receive a Marginal or Unsatisfactory grade for any given By-Law
areas, Mission Areas, or sub-areas must take immediate action to correct discrepancies. The inspected
unit commander must submit a corrective action plan to the Wing Commander via XPI two weeks prior to
the official AMC/IGCY suspense. If AMC will reinspect the area, XPI will notify the effected unit.

                                                Chapter 8

                                   WING INSPECTON PROGRAM

8.1. General. This chapter establishes guidance for conducting SI, UCI and SII programs specific to the
92 ARW. Responsibilities for completion of these inspections reside with commanders at all levels; how-
ever, actual operation and management reside with the 92 ARW/CV. The CV may waive certain require-
ments of this instruction for organizations that have an internal improvement program. The office of
primary responsibility for wing inspection activities is 92 ARW/XPI.

8.2. Purpose. The inspection programs enable commanders to identify and correct management defi-
ciencies for noncompliance with Air Force directives, instructions, state and federal laws. Serious and
repeat discrepancies can be eliminated permanently through conscientious and regular use of these pro-
grams. The program must be an ongoing effort at all levels of command and not solely an administrative
exercise.

8.3. Inspection Types. There are an abundant number of inspections both internal and external, which
are conducted at Fairchild AFB. The objective of 92 ARW/XPI is to give the SIM a solid foundation of
the various types of inspections and how the wing manages them. The inspections that SIMs should be
familiar with are SI, UCI and SII. An exception, for example, is the Environmental Compliance Assess-
ment Management Program (ECAMP) inspection. This is not a SI, UCI, nor SII, but this inspection is
conducted instead. These inspections should also be addressed by the SIM.

8.4. Responsibilities:
     8.4.1. The Vice Commander:
        8.4.1.1. Is responsible for the overall operation of the Wing Inspection Program to ensure inspec-
        tions are conducted on a semiannual basis at a minimum.

                                      GATEKEEPER PROGRAM

9.1. Responsibilities.
   9.1.1. The SAF/IGI, and AMC Gatekeepers are to monitor and deconflict, to the extent practical, the
   type and amount of evaluation activities in an Air Force unit.
   9.1.2. The Fairchild AFB Gatekeeper monitors, deconflicts and receives approval for all visits to the
   base. They will receive guidance from AMC on any issue the base my have with a visit. The Gate-
   keeper will keep a current calendar of all scheduled visits. This calendar will be posted on the Fair-
   child Intranet.

9.2. Visits Requiring Approval.
   9.2.1. Air Force, HQ/AMC, DOD, and non-DOD agencies conduct many inspections, award visits,
   audits and staff assistance visits (SAV) to field units each year. The command gatekeeper is responsi-
   ble for monitoring these visits under the gatekeeper program. Each base within the command must
   assign a person to become the gatekeeper. This person will ensure visits do not conflict with other vis-
   its already scheduled. They will send the request for visits to the appropriate group for coordination
   and approval. Then they will send the request to the Vice Wing Commander, who has final approval
   authority over all visitors to the base. If a problem arises, the base gatekeeper would contact the MAJ-
   COM gatekeeper to see what can be done to fix the problem. This may mean the visit or inspection
   would have to be moved or cancelled. If an associate unit resides on the base, they must still get
   approval for all visits through the gatekeeper program.
   9.2.2. Visits will be categorized and prioritized into the following four groups: Combat Readiness,
   Resource Management, Awards and Other.
       9.2.2.1. Combat Readiness. These visits include EORIs, NSIs, UCIs, OPLAN 8044 inspections,
       ASEV and readiness–related compliance inspections.

Sample Area For Improvement:


AREA FOR IMPROVEMENT: Mortuary Affairs representative contacted Dental Clinic requesting
forensic support but was very unfamiliar with the process.


COMMENT: Dental Clinic Flight Commander was notified by Mortuary Affairs to provide forensic
support to identify DV riding in downed aircraft. Mortuary Affairs representative was not sure of proper

Sample Finding:



FINDING MARE 03-08: The MX recovery team vehicle (call sign MS-2) attempted to cross the active
runway without direct radio contact with the Air Traffic Control Tower on the Tower net.



COMMENTS: The MX recovery team vehicle did not have a radio with the Tower net frequency in their
possession when attempting to cross the controlled movement area; FAFBI 13-200, Flight Vehicle
Control and Driving Program, Chapter 4 states vehicles operating in the controlled movement area
(runway) must have the Tower net and be able to maintain radio contact with the Air Traffic Control. The
Air Traffic Control Tower was contacted by Maintenance Operations Control Center (MOCC) and
requested approval for three vehicles to cross the active runway. The Air Traffic Control Tower told the
MOCC the vehicle would not be allowed to cross the runway without direct radio contact with the Air
Traffic Control Tower on the tower net. The MOCC then requested the tower make radio contact with
MX recovery vehicle on the Maintenance "A" radio frequency. Permission to cross the active runway
was then given to the MX recovery team. Use of the Maintenance "A" radio frequency is not authorized
and creates an opportunity for a mishap to occur. The response time of the MX recovery team was
hindered by not having the tower net frequency.

 tent to await a news release and a briefing on the situation. A Disaster Control Group representative
 should respond to the DCG and coordinate a news release with the On Scene Commander. A PA
 representative should also arrange for a subject matter expert to do a press briefing on the situation.

 This part is for EET only. DO NOT give this information to the exercise participants. This is what we
 expect them to do when they receive the input.
