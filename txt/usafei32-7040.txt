1. Background: HQ USAFE/A7NO periodically conducts site visits of installations throughout
USAFE to evaluate infrastructure systems and programs. The results of these site visits are
documented in the Structures, Utilities & Pavements Evaluation Report (SUPER) for each
installation. Recent site visits have identified a large number of AC systems that provide
“comfort cooling” and are not authorized according to guidelines set by the Command.
Unauthorized “comfort cooling” systems create three issues: (1) unnecessary electrical
consumption/costs, (2) excessive mechanical equipment/refrigerant inventory, (3) significant use
of time/funds on maintenance/repairs. Reducing the number of unauthorized AC systems saves
precious utility dollars and assists the Command achieve its required annual energy intensity
reduction. In addition, eliminating unauthorized AC systems reduces the amount of equipment
and refrigerant that is required to be maintained and tracked. Finally, removing unauthorized
AC systems allows the Civil Engineer Squadron (CES) to focus their time, efforts, and funds on
authorized AC systems to ensure optimal performance and energy efficiency. While challenges
exist in balancing energy conservation with quality of life and customer satisfaction, base
organizations must support federally mandated energy reduction goals while conserving taxpayer
dollars.
2. Primary Definitions:
     2.1. Comfort Cooling – is the effort to reduce the temperature and/or humidity levels for the
     purpose of human comfort. USAFE installations that do not meet the temperature
     requirements identified on Attachment 4 are not authorized comfort cooling. The official
     source for weather data to determine comfort cooling eligibility is the 14th Weather
     Squadron Climate Services.         Updated weather information can be found at
     www.afccc.af.mil. See Attachments 4, 5, and 6 for information on comfort cooling
     temperature requirements, weather data, and USAFE facilities that are authorized comfort
     cooling based on these guidelines.
     2.2. Equipment Cooling – is the effort to reduce the temperature and/or humidity levels for
     the purpose of cooling specialized equipment or electronics IAW manufacturer’s
     specifications, a technical order (TO), or other appropriate published document. To the most
     extent possible, this equipment should be separated so that cooling is not inadvertently
     provided to an unauthorized area. This allows the AC system to be sized properly by
     providing cooling only to the area required.
     2.3. Ventilation – is the process of introducing fresh air into a facility to provide higher
     indoor air quality.
     2.4. Natural Ventilation – is the process of using windows or other non-mechanical
     methods to introduce fresh air into a facility.
     2.5. Mechanical Ventilation – is the process of using mechanical equipment such as an air
     handler to introduce fresh air into a facility or an exhaust fan to withdrawal stale air from a
     facility.
     2.6. Free Cooling – an economical method of using outside air to provide cooling. This is
     usually performed in the evening and early morning hours when the outside temperatures are
     lower, reducing or eliminating the need to operate the facilities AC system, thereby reducing
     overall energy consumption.
USAFEI32-7040 6 MARCH 2013                                                                         3


   2.7. Traditional Mechanical Cooling (TMC) System – a mechanical system that uses a
   compressor and a refrigeration cycle to provide cooling to the desired space. The most
   common forms of TMC systems found on Air Force installations include: chillers, package
   units, split systems, air to air heat pumps, and window units.
   2.8. Non-Traditional Mechanical Cooling (Non-TMC) System – a mechanical system that
   uses a compressor and a refrigeration cycle to provide cooling to the desired space.
   However, the method of heat transfer and other design efficiencies differentiate a Non-TMC
   system from a TMC system. Non-TMC systems include: ground and/or water source heat
   pumps and free cooling chillers.
   2.9. Alternative Cooling Methods – a way to achieve the desired cooling effect without the
   use of a TMC or Non-TMC system. Some examples are: window tinting, blinds, shade trees,
   additional insulation to reduce heat gain/loss, selective de-lamping, and the use of a ventilation
   system to utilize free cooling. USAFE organizations should consider alternative cooling methods
   first as a way to maintain the required temperature as these methods consume the least amount of
   energy and have the lowest operating and maintenance costs. In addition, units should
   continually look for new energy-saving practices and are encouraged to incorporate multiple
   sustainable design technologies appropriate for each specific location and climate. Additional
   information on energy efficient cooling methods can be found in FEDERAL ENERGY
   MANAGEMENT PROGRAM (FEMP) Best Practices Guide for Energy-Efficient Data Center
   Design, http://www1.eere.energy.gov/femp/pdfs/eedatacenterbestpractices.pdf
   2.10. Energy Management Control System (EMCS) – a centrally located system that
   allows an operator to view conditions within a facility based on data received from remote
   sensors. These sensors can relay a wide range of information such as room temperature,
   hot/chilled water temperatures, and equipment operation status. The operator is able to
   adjust set-points, operate valves, fans, or pumps to achieve the desired temperature.
3. Procedures to meet USAFE’s AC Utilization Guidance: BCE’s should develop an energy
efficient approach to cooling and follow the steps below to accurately assess the number, types,
and purposes of the AC systems operating on their respective installation. (T-3)
   3.1. Inventory all existing AC systems: All USAFE installations will conduct a complete
   inventory of all existing AC systems (see Attachment 3 for the inventory format). The
   inventory should identify the facility number, facility function, user/occupant, type of AC
   unit, manufacturer, model number, serial number, rated capacity, electrical specifications,
   refrigerant type, refrigerant amount, purpose (comfort or equipment cooling), and any waiver
   status. (T-3)
   3.2. Shut-down, lock-out and remove unauthorized AC systems: As AC systems are
   identified as unauthorized, they should be shut-down and electrically locked. This action
   should be annotated and tracked on the inventory sheet. Discontinuing the use of these
   systems will save annual utility dollars while ensuring time and funds are spent on authorized
   systems. As funding and time permits, these systems should be permanently removed from
   the facility. The BCE is required to notify the user that the AC system has been identified as
   unauthorized and will be removed unless the user can provide sufficient justification showing
   the system supports a mission essential function or is supported by some other regulation.
   During this period, components and/or refrigerant from these systems could be used to repair
   authorized systems as needed. NOTE: If special circumstances exist to where the user is
4                                                             USAFEI32-7040 6 MARCH 2013


    reasonably expected to receive an approved waiver, it may continue to operate IAW Para 3.4.
    The timeline for initial compliance with this publication is detailed in Para 9.2. (T-3)
       3.2.1. Portable-type AC units are not authorized for permanent operation in USAFE
       facilities. The BCE has the authority to purchase or rent portable-type AC units for
       temporary use in emergency cooling applications. These units should only remain in
       operation until the emergency has been alleviated. Organizations are not authorized to
       procure and install portable AC units for use within their facilities. As these instances are
       identified, the BCE will provide a formal memo to the responsible Squadron Commander
       notifying him/her that the AC unit will be confiscated if not promptly removed. (T-3)
       3.2.2. Individual organizations are not permitted to purchase any AC systems with their
       Government Purchase Cards without written approval from the BCE. AC systems that
       were purchased and/or installed by parties other than CE should be included in the
       installation AC inventory, and should be shut down/removed unless a waiver package is
       submitted and approved. In the event that CE determines an AC system provides
       unauthorized comfort cooling and the user refuses to allow the system to be shut down,
       the user will be responsible for submitting a full waiver package and obtaining approval.
       See section 7 for guidance on submitting a waiver. This should be documented
       appropriately on the annual AC equipment inventory. (T-3)
    3.3. For AC systems that are authorized by a current UFC, TO, or other valid
    regulation: Identify the specific space that requires AC. A UFC that references a
    requirement for AC cannot be used to justify cooling for an entire building. Investigate
    alternative cooling methods and best practices that require less energy and still satisfy the
    temperature requirement. If alternative cooling methods can be implemented, provide a
    summary of the plans for implementation on the AC inventory. Document the UFC, TO or
    other valid regulation on the AC equipment inventory. (T-3)
    3.4. For AC systems that are not authorized by any UFC, TO, or other valid regulation
    but special circumstances exist that may warrant AC: Investigate alternative cooling
    methods and best practices that require less energy and still satisfy the temperature
    requirement. Once all alternative cooling methods have been investigated and deemed
    unacceptable/unfeasible, prepare and submit an AC waiver package for review. See section 7
    for guidance on submitting a waiver. (T-3) NOTE: In the interest of energy efficiency, all
    comfort cooling systems should maintain interior temperature set-points as defined below in
    Table 1. In addition all bases should observe a “cooling season” and “heating season”. All
    authorized comfort cooling systems should not be in operation until the outside air
    temperatures exceed 75 degrees Fahrenheit (24 degrees Celsius) dry bulb or 68 degrees
    Fahrenheit (20 degrees Celsius) wet bulb for five consecutive days. In addition the “heating
    season” should not begin until the outside temp drops below 55 degrees Fahrenheit (13
    degrees Celsius) for five consecutive days. (T-3)

 *Cooling is only authorized when in compliance with this instruction. (T-3)
4. Ongoing management of the AC system inventory:
   4.1. Prior to installing a new AC system in an existing facility, alternative cooling methods
   should be investigated and applied to the fullest extent possible. In addition, during major
   repair or replacement of an existing AC system, alternative methods to meet the conditioned
   air requirements should be researched and implemented if economically cost effective. (T-3)
   4.2. In existing non-waivered facilities with a heat pump as the only source of heat, the
   cooling function should be disabled so the system will only function in heat mode. Operating
   the heat pump in cooling mode for the purpose of comfort cooling is not authorized without a
   formal waiver. (T-3)
   4.3. If the function and/or user of a facility changes, the status of any existing waivers will
   be revoked until the need for cooling is assessed. Moving into a facility with an AC system
   installed does not automatically authorize the occupant the use of this system. Similarly, if a
   facility has an AC system that was originally installed for the purpose of equipment cooling
   and this equipment is moved or no longer utilized, the AC system becomes unauthorized.
   This area should not be converted into an administrative area with the intention of
   maintaining the AC system for comfort cooling. The system should be shut-down,
   electrically locked, and scheduled for removal IAW Para 3.2. (T-3)
   4.4. During the initial or any following equipment inventories, if an AC system is identified
   as unauthorized and is also inoperative; this status should be annotated on the inventory to
   ensure that no further time or funds are allocated for repair or maintenance. In addition, if an
   HVAC technician responds to a service call for an inoperative AC system and it is
   determined that the system is unauthorized, the technician need not continue with the repair.
   The fact that funds have been spent on the initial installation is not a valid reason to continue
   with the repair. Once a system is identified as unauthorized, it should be shut-down and
   electrically locked. The BCE is required to notify the user that the AC system has been
   identified as unauthorized and therefore will not be repaired and will be removed as time and
   funding allows unless the user can provide sufficient justification showing the system
   supports a mission essential function or is supported by some other regulation. (T-3)
   4.5. In the event that the facility occupant refuses to allow the system to be shut down, and
   this issue cannot be resolved through normal chain of command channels, the user will be
 6                                                             USAFEI32-7040 6 MARCH 2013


     responsible for submitting a full waiver package and obtaining approval. See section 7 for
     guidance on submitting a waiver. This should be documented appropriately in the annual AC
     equipment inventory. NOTE: If special circumstances exist to where the user is reasonably
     expected to receive an approved waiver, the system may continue to operate IAW Para 3.4.
     Waiver approvals will be in accordance with this instruction and the guidelines set forth, not
     past actions or agreements. There is no grandfather clause. (T-3)
     4.6. Once a waiver package is approved, it will remain current until a change in the facility
     function or user. A new waiver package will not be required each year. However, the annual
     AC equipment inventory and waiver data call should reference the approved waiver. (T-3)
     4.7. In the event organizations bypass the established work request approval process and hire
     a contractor to install an AC system within their facility, the BCE has the authority to
     determine if CES will assume responsibilities for maintenance and repairs. In addition, if
     this system is determined to be unauthorized, it should be shut-down and electrically locked.
     The using organization will be responsible for submitting a waiver package if they wish to
     pursue keeping the system operational. See section 7 for guidance on submitting a waiver.
     The user will also be responsible for funding the removal of the AC system if the waiver is
     disapproved. However, if the system is for an authorized purpose, the BCE should follow
     current established procedures for instances of this nature in determining responsibilities for
     maintenance and repair. No waiver request is needed if the AC system is for an authorized
     purpose. (T-3)
     4.8. All new facilities on USAFE installations should incorporate construction methods to
     reduce or eliminate the need for AC. This includes proactive designs that reduce facility heat
     gain in the summer and heat loss in the winter. Design criteria used in new construction
     should be in line with UFC 1-200-02; High Performance and Sustainable Building
     Requirements and the Air Force Sustainable Facilities Guide to the maximum extent
     possible. In cases where the Host Nation has applicable energy codes/requirements, adhere
     to the most stringent standards. Waivers for the use of AC should be submitted for review
     prior to 35% of design completion. (T-3)
5. Compliance: All USAFE Civil Engineer units should utilize this instruction as the primary
guide in determining AC eligibility. Installation BCEs, CES Engineering and Operations Flight,
and Contracting personnel should also consult the latest version of any DoD Unified Facilities
Criteria (UFC) documents to evaluate AC cooling requirements based on the function of the
facility. The UFC will not be considered as stand-alone justification for use of AC, but should
be used to help understand the requirements for each type of facility. Facility specific UFC
design guides that reference a requirement for AC does not provide a blanket authorization for
AC in the entire facility. In addition, the most energy-efficient and cost effective means,
including alternative cooling methods, of satisfying the temperature, humidity, and ventilation
requirements should always be considered first. (T-3)
6. Responsibilities
     6.1. Facility Managers: All AC installation requests should be submitted to CE Customer
     Service by the appointed facility manager using the AF Form 332, Base Civil Engineer Work
     Order Request. (T-3)
USAFEI32-7040 6 MARCH 2013                                                                      7


      6.1.1. All requests will be accompanied by a full justification of the requirement to allow
      the BCE to fully understand the function of the facility and the mission impact if the
      request is not approved. If the request is related to provide cooling to a specific piece of
      equipment, provide a copy of the technical specifications that identifies the acceptable
      temperature and humidity operating range. (T-3)
   6.2. Civil Engineer Squadron: CE Customer Service is the focal point for receiving the
   work request from the facility manager and preparing the work order package for review;
   ensuring all pertinent documentation and justification is provided. The CE Operations Flight
   conducts the initial review to determine the validity of the request and will be the OPR for
   the AC system waiver program. The HVAC shop conducts the inventory assessment and
   provides any updates concerning facility function and the need for submitting/cancelling any
   waivers to Operations Flight leadership. If the AC installation request is approved, and based
   on the scope, the package is forwarded to the Engineering Flight; the BCE will determine
   which flight is responsible for staffing any waiver requests. (T-3)
      6.2.1. If a waiver is approved by HQ USAFE/A4/7D, the BCE may proceed with the normal
      processing of the request for execution. The approved request may contain stipulations on
      the installation and energy management of the system. Variances will be staffed back up to
      HQ USAFE Energy/Mechanical Engineer for review and approval. (T-3)
      6.2.2. Civil Engineer Squadrons should use the AC inventory (Attachment 3) to track
      the status of all submitted, pending, and approved waiver packages; along with all other
      systems that are under evaluation. The full inventory will be submitted to HQ
      USAFE/A7NO by 1 September each year. (T-3)
   6.3. HQ USAFE/A7NO Staff: The HQ USAFE Energy/Mechanical Engineer and
   HVAC/R Program Manager are the focal points for clarifying questions in regards to AC
   eligibility, waiver package review status, and waiver routing procedures. The staff is
   responsible for disseminating “Best Practices” and information across USAFE installations to
   standardize and continually improve processes. The staff will assess compliance with this
   instruction during scheduled SUPER visits. (T-3)
7. Waiver Packages: Waiver packages to install or continue using AC systems for comfort
cooling must be approved by the USAFE Civil Engineer, HQ USAFE/A4/7D. An AC system
that is solely used to provide cooling for equipment does not require a waiver. (T-3)
   7.1. Waiver Package Routing
      7.1.1. All waiver packages must be reviewed by the Command Mechanical Engineer and
      HVAC/R Program Manager in HQ USAFE/A7NO. After review, the request, along with the
      A7NO assessment and recommendations, will be forwarded to HQ USAFE/A7N for a final
      review and recommendation decision prior to being submitted to HQ USAFE A4/7D for
      approval/disapproval. During this process, the BCE or a delegated Point of Contact may
      need to provide supplemental information to support the request. (T-3)
      7.1.2. HQ USAFE/A7N will send an official memorandum to the BCE concerning the
      approval or disapproval of the waiver package. An approved waiver may include conditions
      on the system to include secured temperature controls to limit user access,
      minimum/maximum temperature settings, and night setback. These conditions are required
 8                                                                USAFEI32-7040 6 MARCH 2013


        for the use of the AC system and will be subject to verification by HQ USAFE/A7NO staff
        during SUPER visits. (T-3)
     7.2. Steps to submit a Waiver Package: To provide the required information and to reduce
     any unnecessary work, the waiver process is broken down into two steps; initial validation
     and then final validation and approval. (T-3)
        7.2.1. Step 1 - Initial Validation: Step 1 will be used to quickly determine if the facility
        or space meets the eligibility requirements for AC prior to obligating additional
        manpower or funds. The information below should be submitted to HQ USAFE/A7NO
        for the initial validation review. (T-3)
            7.2.1.1. Function of the Facility/Mission Impact Statement: Provide an E-SSS
            explaining the function of the facility or space to justify the need for AC and the
            mission impact if not approved. Also include a recommendation from the BCE as to
            approve or disapprove this request. (T-3)
            7.2.1.2. Load calculations: Complete a load calculation accounting for the total
            square footage of the area needing cooling, number of people that would normally
            occupy the space, and all electronic equipment that generates heat. A load calculation
            template can be provided from HQ USAFE/A7NO upon request. (T-3)
            7.2.1.3. Floor plan: Include a comprehensive floor plan of the area needing cooling
            that clearly identifies any doorways or windows. Also identify if there are any
            existing AC or ventilation systems. (T-3)
        7.2.2. Step 2 - Final Validation and Approval: If after the completion of Step 1, HQ
        USAFE/A7NO determines the facility or space meets the initial eligibility requirements
        for AC; additional information will be required to complete Step 2 for final validation
        and approval. (T-3)
            7.2.2.1. Proposed AC System Information: Provide the specifications on the type,
            size, and type of controls of the proposed AC system. Include the reasoning of why
            this is the best solution for the application. (T-3)
            7.2.2.2. Comparison of Alternative Cooling Methods: Provide a comparison of
            alternative cooling methods and explain why these methods will not fulfill the
            requirement. Identify if alternative cooling methods will be used in conjunction to
            reduce the overall heat load. (T-3)
            7.2.2.3. Lifecycle Cost Analysis: Complete a full lifecycle cost analysis with
            estimated installation, operating, and maintenance costs over the expected “life” of the
            system. (T-3)
8. Recommendations for All Approved “Comfort Cooling” AC Systems:
     8.1. Programmable thermostatic controls: Systems should utilize a thermostatic control
     that allows for the programming of night/weekend setback. The control should also have locked
     setpoints or placed within a lockable thermostat cover in situations that facility occupants should
     not have access to adjust the settings. The thermostatic control should be capable of
     communicating with an Energy Management Control System (EMCS). (T-3)

   8.2. Occupancy sensors: Place occupancy sensors in rooms that may be unoccupied for
   extended periods of time to shut down the mechanical cooling components of the AC system
   after a predetermined time. The fan may continue to run for air circulation and ventilation
   purposes. (T-3)
   8.3. Metering: Meter facilities with AC systems of 10 tons (35 kW) or larger using an
   advanced electrical meter. (T-3)
9. Reporting Requirements and Compliance Checks:
   9.1. Initial AC Inventory: Create and maintain a list of facilities with AC systems within 120
   days of this instruction’s implementation date and send to HQ USAFE/A7NO upon completion,
   and by 1 September each year thereafter. See Attachment 3 for the required format. Include the
   following: (T-3)
      9.1.1. Facility Number
      9.1.2. Facility Function
      9.1.3. Facility User/Occupant
      9.1.4. General Description of AC System (type of AC unit)
      9.1.5. Hertz
      9.1.6. Phase
      9.1.7. Amps
      9.1.8. KW
      9.1.9. Refrigerant Type
      9.1.10. Refrigerant Amount (either kg or lbs is acceptable)
      9.1.11. Purpose of AC System (comfort or equipment)
      9.1.12. Waiver Status (if applicable)
   9.2. Initial Compliance Requirement: Develop a program to ensure all systems are in
   compliance with this instruction within 36 months of implementation. (T-3)
   9.3. Compliance Checks: HQ USAFE/A7NO will review the accuracy of the equipment
   inventory along with any waivers and other documentation during SUPER facility assessments.
   In addition, a line item related to the compliance of this instruction will be added to the
   Management Internal Control Toolset (MICT) Self-Inspection checklist for units to track their
   own status. (T-3)

  9.4. Annual AC Inventory & Waiver Data Call: Installation BCEs must submit an updated
  AC inventory to HQ USAFE/A7NO by 1 September each year. The status of any waivers should
  be annotated on this inventory to accurately reflect those systems that have been approved for
  continued operation. (T-3)
