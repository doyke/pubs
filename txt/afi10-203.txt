                                             Chapter 1

                                    GENERAL PROVISIONS

1.1. Purpose. This Instruction establishes procedures for the documentation and administrative
management of Airmen with injuries or illnesses that may impact their ability to perform their
military duty. These procedures have been developed to ensure maximum utilization and
readiness of personnel, while preserving their health and minimizing risk of further injury or
illness. This Instruction and AFI 41-210, TRICARE Operations and Patient Administration
Functions, describe appropriate courses of action for Integrated Disability Evaluation System
(IDES) pre-screening disposition when individuals have medical conditions potentially affecting
their continued retention for military service or deployability in the Air Force (AF), as outlined
by the standards per AFI 48-123, Medical Examinations and Standards.
     1.1.1. This Instruction provides a method to communicate medical recommendations to
     Commanders. This will allow optimum utilization of Airmen in their charge within the
     guidelines of the medical recommendations and ensure timely return to duty following
     medical evaluations related to potentially unfitting conditions.
     1.1.2. Commanders may consult with the medical unit’s Senior Profiling Officer (SPO) to
     maximize use of personnel with Duty Limiting Conditions (DLCs). An assessment based on
     operational risk of personnel assigned to a unit is critical to maintaining unit readiness at the
     highest degree possible.
     1.1.3. Purpose of AF Form 422, Duty Limiting Condition Report. The AF Form 469 is used
     to describe physical limitations and recommend duty restrictions (DR) to the Commander
     when there is a potential risk to an Airman’s health, safety and well-being, the safety of the
     mission, or the ability of the Airman to effectively accomplish the mission. Additionally, the
     AF Form 469 is used to convey limitations related to the AF Fitness Program (FP) as well as
     Fitness Assessment Exemptions (FAE). In general, the AF Form 469 will describe an
     Airman’s limitations and Fitness Assessment Clearance/Exemptions.
     1.1.4. Purpose of AF Form 422, Notification of Air Force Member’s Qualification Status.
     The AF Form 422 is used for initial qualification, qualification for retirement or separation,
     military retraining, Permanent Change of Station (PCS), Professional Military Education
     (PME), and similar functions as directed in this or other guidance. The AF Form 422
     describes what an Airman is qualified to do based on medical assessment (unless specifically
     directed otherwise, as in paragraph 3.3.2.1 of this Instruction).
1.2. Physical Profile System to include Physical Profile Serial Chart (PULHES). The
physical profile system classifies individuals according to physical/functional abilities and long
term availability for worldwide duty IAW AFI 36-2101, Classifying Military Personnel (Officer
and Enlisted), Air Force Officer Classification Directory (AFOCD) and enlisted structure found
in the Air Force Enlisted Classification Directory (AFECD).
     1.2.1. Applicability. The physical profile system applies to the following categories of
     personnel:
        1.2.1.1. Applicants for appointment, enlistment, and induction into military service.
AFI10-203 20 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                      5


       1.2.1.2. AD, and ARC Airmen; USAF Academy and Reserve Officers’ Training Corps
       (ROTC) cadets; and students in the Uniformed Services University of Health Sciences
       (USUHS) and Health Professions Scholarship Program (HPSP).
   1.2.2. Profiles. Profiles are descriptions of transient or permanent limitations to functioning
   which are used for establishing suitability for career fields or Air Force Specialty Codes
   (AFSC). A profile can be established on a DD Form 2808, Report of Medical Examination,
   an AF Form 422, or other forms as directed. Once a profile is established, it is considered
   current unless updated during a Preventive Health Assessment (PHA), the Airman has
   undergone a RILO (with or without initiation of an Assignment Limitation Code C (ALC-
   C)), Medical Evaluation Board (MEB), or a World Wide Duty (WWD) or Fitness for Duty
   (FFD) evaluation (ARC only), or has a current duty or mobility restriction (MR) of at least 6
   months duration. See paragraph 3.1.2. of this Instruction for further guidance.
1.3. Duty limitations. Duty limitations are entered on the AF Form 469. Duty limitations will
indicate what the member cannot do based on their current occupational duties with resultant
mobility and/or fitness restrictions if appropriate. (T-2) The maximum allowable duration of the
AF Form 469 following RILO or MEB is 15 months. (T-2) For any other restrictions the
maximum allowable duration of the AF Form 469 is 365 days. (T-2) DLCs annotated on an AF
Form 469 must be reviewed for appropriateness and accuracy at every clinical encounter
between the Airman and a provider. (T-2) Additionally, the AF Form 469 must be re-validated
and renewed or revised, as appropriate, at each PHA at a minimum. (T-1) See Chapter 3 of this
Instruction for further guidance.
   1.3.1. Any DLC which restricts mobility for a cumulative period of 365 days or may be
   considered unfitting for continued military service must undergo a review by the Deployment
   Availability Working Group (DAWG) for an Initial RILO referred to HQ AFPC Medical
   Retention Standards Branch (DPANM), or the appropriate ARC Chief of Aerospace
   Medicine (SGP), IAW AFI 48-123 and AFI 41-210. (T-1) The Initial RILO at DPANM or
   ARC SGP may result in Return To Duty (RTD) without restrictions, RTD with ALC-C,
   referral for MEB, or other outcomes as directed by DPANM or ARC SGP. See paragraph
   4.2 of this Instruction for further guidance.
   1.3.2. Aeromedical Services Information Management System (ASIMS) can track up to
   three DLCs simultaneously; however, an Airman may only have one active AF Form 469 at a
   time. (T-1) If a provider desires to add a new diagnosis to an existing AF Form 469, the
   mobility impact of the restriction and desired release date of the new functional limitations
   secondary to the new diagnosis must be considered in light of the existing AF Form 469
   functional restrictions and dates (see AFI 10-203 Supplemental Guidance). (T-1) If the new
   diagnosis is mobility restricting and the release date will not exceed the maximum duration
   of the existing AF Form 469, the provider can edit the existing AF Form 469 and add the
   new functional limitations due to the new diagnosis. If the new diagnosis is mobility
   restricting and will exceed the maximum duration of the existing AF Form 469, the provider
   must re-accomplish an AF Form 469 including any pre-existing limitations. (T-1) If the new
   diagnosis is not mobility restricting, the existing AF Form 469 will allow the addition of the
   new diagnosis and an extended release date not greater than 365 days. Note: ASIMS
   maintains a record of all previous AF Form 469s.
 6                                                              AFI10-203 20 NOVEMBER 2014


     1.3.3. Individuals may have up to three distinct medical conditions requiring DRs, MRs
     and/or FRs on an AF Form 469 with up to three separate expiration dates. If there is more
     than one diagnosis on the AF Form 469, the provider will indicate functional limitations (if
     any) and expiration date of each duty or MR in the “Restrictions” section, as well as
     limitations to fitness activities. (T-2) This will prevent the medical staff from having to
     initiate a new AF Form 469 when one set of restrictions reaches the expected release date,
     but the patient’s status in terms of the AF Form 469 remains otherwise unchanged. If a MR
     expires prior to a DR, the AF Form 469 will allow an extended release date for the DR. (T-2)
1.4. Special Considerations.
     1.4.1. ARC unique issues. For ARC Airmen, refer to AFI 48-123 and AFI 36-3209,
     Separation and Retirement Procedures for Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve
     Members.
        1.4.1.1. For purposes of this Instruction, the term Medical Treatment Facility (MTF) will
        be used to refer to all AD and ARC Medical Units, unless otherwise specified as AD
        MTF for AD, Reserve Medical Unit (RMU) for AFRC, or Guard Medical Unit (GMU)
        for ANG units.
        1.4.1.2. Medical Standards Management Element (MSME) is an AD element. The
        function of the MSME is executed by a 4N0X1 in AFRC and a full-time health
        technician for the ANG, or otherwise as directed. For the purpose of this Instruction, the
        term MSME will be used to include the AD and ARC functions.
     1.4.2. Refusal to obtain medical evaluation or treatment. After evaluation by medical
     consultants, Airmen who refuse to obtain further medical evaluations or treatment for
     potentially disqualifying defects, as required or recommended, will be referred by the
     DAWG to DPANM or ARC SGP as applicable for Initial RILO or Fit for Duty (FFD)
     determination IAW AFI 41-210. (T-1) DPANM or ARC SGP will consider the Airman’s
     retainability in the service with the medical condition in its current state and the probability
     of progression of disease or worsening of the medical condition without the recommended
     medical treatment. Depending on the final disposition of the case, the Airman may not be
     eligible for military disability payment and may be subject to involuntary separation under
     AFI 36-3206, Administrative Discharge Procedures for Commissioned Officer; AFI 36-
     3208, Administrative Separation of Airmen; AFI 36-3209, or AFI 48-123.
        1.4.2.1. Second opinion. Any Airman with a potentially disqualifying condition has the
        option of seeking a second opinion to explore treatment options. The second opinion
        must be provided by a consultant arranged through MTF referral processes, unless an
        ARC member is seeking a second opinion during a Fitness for Duty (FFD)/World-wide
        Duty (WWD) determination for a condition found Not in the Line of Duty (NILOD). (T-
        1) When both medical opinions agree and the Airman refuses all treatment options
        provided, an Initial RILO must be accomplished. (T-1) If the medical opinions differ, the
        Airman may choose one of the treatment options given. Further medical opinions will
        only be considered upon appeal to the MTF SGH who will determine whether the
        evaluation or treatment is a covered benefit which is deemed by the SGH to be medically
        necessary. (T-2)

     inform the Airman’s commander to initiate the waiver if the service member is tasked to
     deploy. (T-0, DoDI 6490.07)
         2.10.6.1.1. The local SGH and SGP will develop local protocol which covers all
         temporary medical treatment and evaluation that limit deployments, but meets
         retention standards. They will also identify non-Mental Health providers to sign the
         AF Form 469 when a mental health condition is the reason for a AF Form 469. If
         none are assigned the Airman’s PCM will be responsible for signing the AF Form
         469. See supplement for additional information. Any waivers for this requirement
         will be directed to AFMOA/SGP.
AFI10-203 20 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                     11


          2.10.6.1.2. Comments placed on the AF Form 469 will be generic and apply to all
          medical conditions that meet retention standards but may be waived if requested (T-
          1). For example; “service member undergoing medical evaluation and/or treatment
          for a condition that precludes deployment at this time. A deployment waiver may be
          considered if tasked to deploy prior to expiration date. Contact (SGP/MSME/PCM) if
          tasked for deployment.”
          2.10.6.1.3. The local policy will apply to all conditions (not only mental health) to
          include but not limited to potential malignancies undergoing work-up that preclude
          deployment, symptomatic hypothyroid initiating medication, severe hypertension not
          stabilized with medication, and also initiation of medication for mental health
          diagnoses.
          2.10.6.1.4. Providers must carefully weigh the rigors of potential assignments
          carefully to avoid exacerbations of conditions brought on by the rigors of contingency
          operations. See DoDI 6490.07, Enclosure 3, paragraph h, for a description of mental
          health situations that are disqualifying for deployment. (T-0, DoDI 6490.07)
       2.10.6.2. If Command notification is not warranted per DoDI 6490.08, DoDI 6490.07, or
       AFI 48-123, an AF Form 469 will not be created for the specific encounter or clinical
       concern. (T-0: DoDI 6490.08)
2.11. Competent Medical Authority (CMA).
   2.11.1. For Airmen requiring continuous monitoring after administrative qualification for
   Personnel Reliability Program (PRP), the CMA will report any medical condition requiring
   generation of an AF Form 469 to the losing Commander, gaining certifying official and the
   gaining CMA IAW DoD 5210.42-R_AFMAN 10-3902, Nuclear Weapons Personnel
   Reliability Program. (T-0: DoD 5210 .42-R_AFMAN 10-3902)
   2.11.2. Once the gaining CMA (at installations with active PRP Airmen assigned) is notified
   that the incoming Airman has received an AF Form 469, the gaining CMA shares
   responsibility to monitor AHLTA, or equivalent for the ARC, for medical conditions which
   may preclude the Airman from assignment to the gaining base and PRP. (T-0: DoD 5210.42-
   R_AFMAN 10-3902) Care will be taken to ensure that distribution of a patient’s protected
   health information (PHI) is limited to the minimum necessary and that these disclosures are
   properly accounted for IAW AFI 41-210. (T-1)
2.12. Clinical Consultants shall:

       the requesting MTF within 30 days of the Airman’s encounter with the consultant. (T-2)
       This may be delayed if significant studies are pending, but will not exceed 30 days
       following definitive diagnosis. Note: Consults on ARC Airmen must be completed
       within 30 days if the Airman is receiving care for a line of duty condition; otherwise they
       must be done within 90 days. (T-2)

       military service or deployability, the MTF clinical consultant shall include specific
       recommendations in the medical record or narrative summary regarding these issues and
       will communicate these recommendations to MSME within one duty day of the clinical
       encounter for referral to the DAWG. (T-1) See AFI 10-203 Supplement for additional
       guidance.
       2.12.1.3. If a clinical consultant in an MTF determines an Airman requires a duty
       limitation, the consultant will initiate an AF Form 469 (or equivalent form specific for the
       service of the consultant), and will communicate this duty limitation to the Airman’s
       PCM. (T-2) If the assigned PCM is not a provider in an AF MTF, the consultant’s
       recommendation will be forwarded to the MSME office (or ARC equivalent) in the AF
       MTF nearest the Airman’s duty location. (T-2) See AFI 10-203 Supplemental Guidance
       for additional guidance.
   2.12.2. Only consider recommendations from civilian (non-MTF) clinical consultants that
   are related to, or describe, functional limitations. (T-2) AF providers are the final authority
   on deployment, medical retainability, and physical limitation recommendations (see

                                          Chapter 3

           ESTABLISHING AND DISSEMINATING DUTY LIMITATIONS

3.1. General Requirements.
   3.1.1. Completion of an AF Form 469. When a provider determines an Airman needs a
   duty limitation, the following describe the minimum steps for completion of the AF Form
   469. (T-1) See AFI 10-203 Supplemental Guidance for additional information.
      3.1.1.1. The healthcare provider (or designee) will enter demographic data, diagnosis,
      physical limitations and/or restrictions and then specify resulting DRs, MRs, and/or FRs,
      and with a release date/s into ASIMS. (T-1) The provider or clinic staff must cross-check
      the Airman’s organization and duty phone with the Airman. (T-2) In order to properly
      complete the AF Form 469, the provider must check a box for MR (see 3.4), DR (see
      3.3), or FR (see 3.2), or some combination thereof. (T-1) Only specific limitations will
      be entered in the comments section as noted in 3.1.1.2. (T-1) Diagnoses will be recorded
      in the appropriate section of the AF Form 469 electronic interface, but will not be printed
      on the form. (T-0: 45 CFR §164.514(d), DoD 6025.18-R, C8.2) The provider will then
      electronically sign the “Health Care Provider” line on the form. (T-1)
      3.1.1.2. The AF Form 469 is used solely to describe physical limitations, functional
      impairments, or specific restrictions. (T-1)
         3.1.1.2.1. Functional limitations noted on the AF Form 469 will convey necessary
         detail to allow the Commander to make informed decisions concerning the
         management of his/her personnel. (T-1) Limitations will be timely, accurate and
         unambiguous and be written in simple terms understandable by non-medical
         leadership and supervisors. (T-1)
         3.1.1.2.2. The AF Form 469 will contain no positive affirmations regarding the
         Airman’s workplace or what the Airman can do in the workplace. (T-1) However,
         the AF Form 469 may contain positive (“should”, “can”, “will”, etc.) instructions
         regarding an Airman’s medical management. (Example: for an Airman who has
         undergone foot surgery, the AF Form 469 may state: “Airman should use hard
         orthopedic shoe in place of uniform footwear and should use crutches.”) Refer to
         AFI 36-2903, Dress and Personal Appearance of Air Force Personnel for the
         alterations that are authorized.
         3.1.1.2.3. If additional medical management inputs are included such as follow-up
         care appointments, do not include any reference that would describe the diagnosis.
         For example, instead of stating “member to follow-up with Infectious Disease Clinic
         in 90 days,” state “member to follow-up with specialty care clinic in 90 days”. This
         allows the command to know this is important for Airman to be released for
         appointments that are critical to return the Airmen to work or complete their medical
         evaluation, but does not disclose the diagnosis or type of clinic the patient may
         require.
   3.1.2. Completion of a AF Form 422. The AF Form 422 is a profile containing
   descriptions of long-standing or permanent physical limitations which are used for
AFI10-203 20 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                   19


   establishing suitability for career fields or AFSC. (T-1) The AF Form 422 also may be used
   by the DAWG to communicate to the commander and member that the member had a trigger
   event that was reviewed by the DAWG with the updated PULHES.
      3.1.2.1. The AF Form 422 is updated when completing other medically related personnel
      functions, which include initial qualification, military retraining, PCS (if appropriate),
      PME, and similar functions as directed in this or other guidance. (T-1)
      3.1.2.2. The AF Form 422 is updated after a RILO (with or without initiation of an ALC-
      C), MEB, WWD or FFD evaluation. (T-1) In these cases, re-accomplish a profile
      (PULHES) on an AF Form 422 to reflect updates from the RILO, MEB, WWD, or FFD
      determination. (T-1) If a member has an ALC-C removed during another DPAMN or
      ARC/SGP review, the AF Form 422 will be updated to reflect the new PULHES. (T-1)
      3.1.2.3. Information noted on the AF Form 422 will convey necessary detail to allow the
      Commander and personnel system specialists to make informed decisions concerning the
      management of personnel. (T-1) Information will be timely, accurate and unambiguous
      and be written in simple terms understandable by non-medical leadership and personnel
      system specialists. (T-1) The diagnosis or other medical justification for the statements
      will not be placed on the AF Form 422 (T-0; 45 CFR §164.514(d), DoD 6025.18-R,
      C8.2). The requirements for follow-up care should not be included on the AF Form 422.
   3.1.3. When AF Forms 422 and/or AF Form 469 are completed and MTF staff confirms that
   unit notification is indicated, the ASIMS program will automatically email the appropriate
   information to the Airman’s commander or commander’s designee(s).
      3.1.3.1. Notifications made using the automated features of ASIMS are sent via un-
      encrypted email. The email contains a link to the ASIMS program that restricts access to
      those approved to receive PHI by the MTF HIPAA Privacy Officer (HPO) using
      Common Access Card (CAC) certificates. Notifications made outside of the ASIMS
      program must follow guidance in AFI 41-210 in order to protect PHI.
   3.1.4. Any AFRC Airman with a condition that is disqualifying from his/her specific duties
   and/or has an AAC 31 is not allowed to participate in any pay or point gaining activity until
   the condition has resolved or waiver is granted IAW AFI 36-2254 V1, Reserve Personnel
   Participation.
3.2. FRs and FAEs.
   3.2.1. If an Airman has a medical condition affecting fitness, but not impacting mobility,
   retention, or AFSC duties, an AF Form 469 will be generated by the provider who initially
   assesses the condition. (T-1) The AF Form 469 will detail functional limitations, specific
   FRs (to include restrictions from unit fitness activities if appropriate), and FAE. (T-1) See
   AFI 10-203 Supplemental Guidance for additional information. NOTE: These actions will
   be accomplished by the ARC MLO (or other appropriate designee) for ARC Airmen IAW
   AFI 36-2905.
      3.2.1.1. If the FR and/or FAE is ≤180 days duration, the AF Form 469 will be signed and
      closed by the provider (or ARC MLO), a copy will be provided to the Airman at the time
      of the clinical encounter, and an electronic copy will be transmitted to the unit. (T-1)
 20                                                        AFI10-203 20 NOVEMBER 2014


      3.2.1.2. If the FR or FAE is for a duration of > 180 days, or if it is a component
      exemption specifically for abdominal circumference (AC), the AF Form 469 must be
      signed (but not closed) by the provider (or ARC MLO), then reviewed by MSME as well
      as a PO, prior to closing the AF Form 469 and transmitting to the unit. (T-1) The Airman
      may be provided a draft printout of the restriction, however the provider will ensure that
      the Airman understands that this is only a draft that may be changed after review. The
      unit will not receive the FR or FAE from the MTF until after the AF Form 469 is
      reviewed by a PO. (T-1)
          3.2.1.2.1. AC exemptions must be reviewed by the DAWG before final closure by
          any MTF PO and transmission to the unit. (T-1) (Exception: AC exemptions for
          pregnancy do not require DAWG review.)
          3.2.1.2.2. The unit commander may choose to apply the draft FAE if the final AF
          Form 469 has not been received at the time of FA, however the final AF Form 469
          will supersede the draft recommendations for all future FAs.
          3.2.1.2.3. If an Airman has a chronic medical condition affecting fitness, the AF
          Form 469 may include FR and FAE with a term of validity of up to 365 days. These
          long-standing AF Form 469 will be reviewed by the PCM at the PHA. (T-1) The
          review will determine the need for restriction continuance, or any changes in the
          condition that may necessitate an Initial or other RILO. (T-1) Medical conditions
          impacting the FA only and not impacting mobility, retention, or AFSC duties do not
          automatically require Initial RILO. All FAE written for 365 days will be referred by
          the provider and/or MSME to the DAWG for review. (T-1) There are no permanent
          FA/FAE exemptions.
   3.2.2. If an Airman has a valid AF Form 469 and changes duty location (PCS etc.), the AF
   Form 469 are valid at the gaining installation for FRs and FAEs. (T-2)
3.3. DRs Only.
   3.3.1. For DRs with no mobility, retention, retraining, or fitness implications, the AF Form
   469 signed by the health care provider will be made available electronically via ASIMS to
   MSME for review and signature. (T-1) Following MSME signature, the information will be
   made available via ASIMS email notification to the Airman’s unit. PO review/signature is
   not required. See paragraph 3.1.3.1. of this Instruction for guidance on protecting PHI.
   3.3.2. DRs that could permanently affect an Airman’s ability to perform their AFSC-specific
   duties, but do not affect continued military service, will be handled administratively
   beginning with AFSC disqualification IAW AFI 36-2101 (Chapter 4) and AFI 48-123. (T-1)
      3.3.2.1. The provider will initiate a new AF Form 422 stating “Member meets AF
      retention standards for continued service but does not meet AFSC-specific physical
      standards and is therefore disqualified for AFSC XXXX”.(T-1) The diagnosis or other
      medical justification for the statement will not be placed on the AF Form 422 (T-0; 45
      CFR §164.514(d), DoD 6025.18-R, C8.2).
      3.3.2.2. MSME will review the AF Form 422 with the Airman (T-2). MSME will edit
      the AF Form 422 to annotate medical qualification statements for any prior AFSCs that
      have been held by the Airman.(T-1) Note: If MSME assesses that the Airman may not
AFI10-203 20 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                   21


      be eligible for retraining, the case will be referred to the DAWG for Initial RILO
      consideration. (T-1) See AFI 10-203 Supplemental Guidance for additional information.
3.4. MR.
   3.4.1. When a medical condition will prevent an Airman from deploying, with or without
   duty or fitness limitations, the provider will check the MR box on the AF Form 469 and enter
   the release date of the restriction. (T-1)
      3.4.1.1. After electronic signature by the provider, the form will be automatically
      forwarded to MSME which will assess the form and determine if the condition will
      require an AAC 31 (release date of 31 to 365 days) or 81 (pregnancy). If an AAC 31 or
      81 is needed, MSME will check the appropriate AAC box and sign the form which will
      then automatically forward to the PO.(T-1) (Note: MRs <31 days duration do not require
      AAC 31 or PO review/signature.)
      3.4.1.2. The PO will review the restrictions and the coding and validate by electronic
      signature, and then forward the form electronically to the Airman’s unit Commander via
      ASIMS email notification for concurrence/non-concurrence. (T-1) The AF Form 469
      should be forwarded to the Squadron Commander within one duty day of initiation by the
      provider, but no later than two duty days (except for Code 81 which has up to 5 days). (T-
      2) For ARC Airmen, the AF Form 469 will be forwarded to the Commander prior to the
      Airman’s next duty day. (T-2)
      3.4.1.3. The Commander or designated representative will issue the form to the Airman
      following signature by the Commander. (T-2)
   3.4.2. If a Commander chooses to non-concur on the MR, the Commander must contact the
   MTF/SGP within 7 duty days (COB on last day of UTA for ARC) of receipt of the mobility
   restricting AF Form 469 (no contact from the Commander will be considered concurrence).
   (T-2)
      3.4.2.1. The MTF/SGP, with assistance from MSME, will collect and review pertinent
      medical data, consulting as needed with the provider who initiated the MR. (T-2) The
      MTF/SGP may override the provider’s recommendation and revise or remove the MR in
      order to resubmit to the Airman’s Commander. If the MTF/SGP agrees with the
      provider, the MTF/SGP will discuss the case with the Airman’s Commander. (T-2)
      3.4.2.2. If the MTF/SGP and Unit Commander disagree, the Airman can be placed on
      mobility status with the concurrence of the Commander’s next reporting official
      (normally the Airman’s Group Commander). If the second level Commander non-
      concurs as well, the final Commander acting on the AF Form 469 issues a completed
      copy to the Airman after the MTF/SGP notifies MSME of the action and MSME
      generates a new AF Form 469. (T-2) The new AF Form 469 will still reflect the MR and
      initial AAC but will include a statement indicating that the Airman’s Squadron/Group
      Commander non-concurred and the Airman will be considered available for
      mobility/deployment. (T-2) Rationale for the decision will be documented by the
      MTF/SGP in the Airman’s medical record. (T-2)
      3.4.2.3. A specified deployment may have medical requirements determined by the
      COCOM. Thus, while a Commander may place an individual on mobility regardless of
 22                                                          AFI10-203 20 NOVEMBER 2014


      medical recommendations, the gaining COCOM may not accept the Airman for
      deployment. For a defined deployment, the MTF will coordinate through its MAJCOM
      to the gaining COCOM regarding waiver of defined medical requirements.(T-1)
      3.4.2.4. In the event of a Commander’s non-concurrence on an AF Form 469 for an
      Airman with a condition which is unfitting for continued military service, an Initial RILO
      will still be prepared and forwarded to DPANM IAW AFI 41-210 (or to appropriate ARC
      SGP). (T-1)
   3.4.3. Permanent MRs (e.g. ALC-C) may only be determined by DPANM or ARC SGP.
   These mobility limitations will be displayed on the AF Form 469 permanently at the bottom
   of the physical limitations/restrictions portion and once assigned, will not be changed,
   removed, or overridden by any local DLC or profile action (additional restrictions may be
   added as appropriate). (T-1) Only waiver authorities as described in AFI 41-210 may
   authorize deployment for individuals placed on ALC restrictions. Unit commanders may not
   non-concur with MRs directed by DPANM or ARC SGP (i.e. ALCs).
3.5. Pregnancy-related Duty Limitations.
   3.5.1. When an Airman is diagnosed as pregnant, PH will be notified via direct referral from
   the provider or clinic staff, by an AF Form 469 initiated by the provider, or through other
   appropriate means, IAW AFI 44-102. (T-1) (For ARC, the Airman is required to notify the
   medical unit and provide proof of pregnancy). (T-1) If MSME receives a new AF Form 469
   for pregnancy, it will be immediately forwarded to PH for appropriate action as the action
   office for the Fetal Protection Program. (T-1)
      3.5.1.1. PH, in coordination with the PCM and if applicable the Women’s Health
      Provider, will issue an initial AF Form 469 within 5 duty days of notification to PH or
      MSME of a positive pregnancy test. (T-1) The AF Form 469 will include standard DRs,
      MRs, and FRs (IAW para 3.5.2. of this Instruction). (T-1) For the ARC, the AF Form
      469 will be processed the next UTA (T-1).
      3.5.1.2. For pregnant Airmen assigned to a workplace monitored as part of the
      Occupational and Environmental Health Program (OEHP), standard duty limitations may
      require additional or altered limitations, based on workplace-specific hazards IAW
      AFMAN 48-146, Occupational and Environmental Health Program Management. (T-1)
      If indicated by the OEHP, the Airman’s worksite will be evaluated for hazards that could
      affect the mother or fetus.(T-1) If this evaluation indicates the need for a change in the
      standard duty limitations, the AF Form 469 will be modified within 15 duty days (within
      two UTAs for ARC) of initial PH notification with restrictions tailored to the hazards of
      the Airman’s workplace. (T-1) Bioenvironmental Engineering (BE) will provide a
      written workplace evaluation to PH based on either the latest workplace survey (if
      conducted within the last 12 months) or a specific site visit to identify workplace hazards.
      (T-1) PH will, in turn, coordinate with the installation Occupational and Environmental
      Health Consultant and the women’s health provider or PCM to finalize the duty
      limitations on the AF Form 469. (T-1) ARC may have civilian OB/GYN consultation on
      duty limitations.
      3.5.1.3. Duty limitations associated with pregnancy may require temporary removal from
      certain AFSC duties. Retraining will not be required.
AFI10-203 20 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                   23


   3.5.2. The Obstetrics and Gynecology (OB-GYN) Consultants to the AF/SG will validate the
   AF standard DRs, MRs, and FRs for pregnancy annually and produce an updated AF Form
   469 pregnancy overprint or template. The DAWG may approve changes to the standard
   template when deemed appropriate. Changes will be documented in the DAWG minutes. (T-
   1)
3.6. Multiple Action AF Form 469.
   3.6.1. If an Airman requires an AF Form 469 be initiated for multiple purposes (mobility,
   duty, and/or fitness), MRs always have highest priority in processing. (T-1) This means that
   management of the AF Form 469 must follow the process described in paragraph 3.4. of this
   Instruction. (T-1) If there are no MRs, but there are DRs and FRs, then process the AF Form
   469 following paragraph 3.3. of this Instruction. EXCEPTION: Pregnancy-related AF forms
   469 will be processed IAW section 3.5. of this Instruction.
   3.6.2. FR/FAE issued with either (or both) MR and DR may be printed and provided to the
   Airman by the provider as a draft (the provider would only sign in one place). Follow
   guidance in paragraph 3.2.1.2. of this Instruction on issuing a draft AF Form 469 for the
   Airman while the DR and MR follow the review processes described herein. (T-2)
3.7. External duty limitations (civilian or sister service). All AF personnel must report
changes in physical status to their AF military medical unit. (T-1) Duty limitations from a non-
AF provider are a recommendation and must be entered on an AF Form 469. (T-1) AF providers
retain final mobility recommendation authority. (T-1)
3.8. Dental.
   3.8.1. When an Airmen is placed into Dental Readiness Classification (DRC) 3, an AF Form
   469 will be initiated (T-1). The AF Form 469 will be the primary means of notifying
   commanders that a member is in DRC 3 (T-1). See AFI 47-101, Managing Air Force Dental
   Services, for more information.
   3.8.2. DRC 4 generally does not require an AF Form 469. However, if the class 4 extends
   beyond 30 days without resolution, an AF Form 469 may be used, at the discretion of the
   Chief of Dental Services in consultation with the SGP, as an additional tool to communicate
   the non-deployable status of the Airman to the unit. For the AFRC, if the Airman is in DRC 4
   they will be placed in a No Pay, No Points status. (T-1)

                        DAWG CASE MANAGEMENT REVIEW

4.1. Routine DAWG Case Reviews.
   4.1.1. Purpose. The DAWG will be established at each wing/base level and will meet at
   least monthly to review personnel with a DLC that affects mobility, retention, or long-term
   physical fitness. (T-1) The DAWG will identify personnel not deployment eligible (Not
   Mission Capable, NMC) and track progress of the medical condition through resolution or
   definitive disposition. (T-1) They will further identify cases exceeding prescribed time
   limits, review a representative sample of DLCs, and provide feedback to PCM teams,
   including providers, via the SGH. (T-1) The DAWG will produce and provide a report to the
   MTF executive committee via the Aerospace Medicine Council (AMC). (T-1) The DAWG
   will also review cases referred for potentially unfitting medical conditions. (T-1)
      4.1.1.1. The DAWG at ARC installations should meet monthly, but not less than
      quarterly. (T-2) At co-located bases, ARC representatives are highly encouraged to
      participate in the RegAF host base DAWG to ensure ARC Airmen requiring Initial
      RILOs and/or MEBs are managed appropriately (e.g. through RegAF channels for duty-
      related conditions or through ARC for non-duty related FFD/WWD conditions).
      4.1.1.2. In certain circumstances, disclosures of an Airman’s PHI by the DAWG are
      required by law and must be accounted for IAW AFI 41-210.
   4.1.2. Membership will consist of the SGP, SGH, SPO, all available POs, MSME, PEBLO
   (or ARC equivalent), a PCM representative, and, as appropriate, an ARC Wing Fitness
   Program Manager (WFPM). Others may be assigned or invited to attend as needed (e.g.
   DoD/Veterans Affairs (VA) military services coordinator). Any invitees must be authorized
   to receive the PHI being discussed, otherwise attendance would not be permitted IAW AFI
   41-210.
      4.1.2.1. A mental health representative may be invited or appointed to the DAWG
      depending on the number and complexity of mental health cases to be reviewed.
      4.1.2.2. Any member of the medical management team (Health Care Integrator, Case
      Manager, Utilization Manager, or Disease Manager) may be invited or appointed to
      provide clinical case management expertise, as desired. Similarly, a referral management
      specialist may be invited or included. (Note: Not applicable for ARC bases.) If this
      individual is not a nurse, the DAWG may consider including a clinical nurse to provide
      clinical case management input, support, and guidance to MSME.
      4.1.2.3. A representative from the Women’s Health Clinic (or equivalent section
      managing pregnant Airmen) may be invited or included as a member of the DAWG, at
      the discretion of the Chair, if indicated for better management of AAC 81 cases.
      4.1.2.4. Providers who have empanelled cases being considered at the DAWG, or who
      initially referred a case or are involved in the clinical management of the case, may be
      invited to attend the DAWG based on the discretion of the DAWG Chair and the
      availability of the provider.
AFI10-203 20 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                   25


     4.1.2.5. The DAWG Chair may invite attendees who are not assigned to the MTF staff,
     but only for those portions of the meeting that do not address individually identifiable
     health information. For PHI-related portions of the meeting, DAWG attendance by
     personnel not assigned to the MTF staff should be limited. If it is necessary for a unit
     commander/designees to attend, these personnel may only attend portions of the DAWG
     applicable to Airmen under their designated command structure.
  4.1.3. The DAWG will review and provide oversight of the following processes: (T-1)
     4.1.3.1. Airmen with DLCs which do not affect mobility. For Airmen with DLCs ≥ 365
     cumulative days in duration but who are still mobility qualified (to include DR, FR,
     and/or FAE), the MSME will review each case following the review by the PCM as part
     of the PHA process. (T-1) Medical conditions affecting the fitness assessment only and
     not impacting mobility, retention, or AFSC duties do not automatically require Initial
     RILO.
     4.1.3.2. AAC 31 Review. An ASIMS generated list of all personnel with an AAC 31
     will be reviewed by MSME prior to the DAWG. (T-1) For cases identified for DAWG
     review, MSME will review the medical records, in consultation with the provider as
     appropriate, and be prepared to present issues and potential solutions for these cases. (T-
     1) Providers may be required to attend the DAWG meeting, at the discretion of the
     DAWG Chair, if deemed appropriate to discuss cases.
         4.1.3.2.1. AAC 31 Review minimum reviews. Any AF Form 469 with an AAC 31
         that has been in effect for 90 days or more will be reviewed to ensure the MR are
         applied appropriately to the clinical condition. (T-1) Once this 90-day review has
         been accomplished on a specific AF Form 469, it does not need to be reviewed again
         until it has reached 300 days in effect.
         4.1.3.2.2. The issuing provider (or PCM if more appropriate) will be notified by
         MSME when an AF Form 469 with an AAC 31 reaches 300 days cumulative time (or
         will reach 300 days by the time of the next DAWG meeting) for a single condition in
         preparation for referral to DAWG. (T-1) If the DAWG determines that it is probable
         that the restrictions will not be lifted before one year has passed, an Initial RILO or
         FFD will be initiated immediately without waiting for 365 cumulative days under
         restriction to pass. (T-1) For ARC FFDs will follow the same timeline as initial
         RILOs. (T-2)
     4.1.3.3. Potentially Unfitting Cases are reported to the DAWG through five trigger
     events. (T-1) A trigger event is a condition or occurrence which may indicate a service
     member has (a) medical and/or mental health condition(s) that is/(are) inconsistent with
     retention standards or deployability. Each DAWG should establish procedures and
     guidelines for reporting trigger events at its respective MTF; but the preferred method is
     the “Refer to DAWG” Tool in ASIMS. (T-1) See User Guide for Refer to DAWG Tool
     for additional details. Preliminary review of a trigger event should occur at the next
     scheduled DAWG meeting, and not more than 45 days after the case is referred to the
     PEBLO or MSME by the provider. See 4.2. for details of DAWG Review. (T-1) Trigger
     events include, but are not limited to, the following:
26                                                         AFI10-203 20 NOVEMBER 2014


        4.1.3.3.1. Provider, after discovering a potential or questionable service-disqualifying
        medical condition for any Airman regardless of rank, is responsible for submitting the
        case to the DAWG.
        4.1.3.3.2. DAWG Surveillance Tracking determines that a member has a chronic
        condition which may preclude him/her from performing AFSC duties, deploying to
        field conditions, have an unfitting condition and/or will not return to mobility status
        prior to cumulative 365 days for condition or related issue(s). Regardless of the
        diagnosis, after 12 months of cumulative AAC 31 status for the same or related
        issue(s), the full case must be referred to DPANM via an initial RILO for
        adjudication review. (T-1)
        4.1.3.3.3. Commander requests evaluation of unit service members due to poor duty
        performance or deployment concerns stemming from a potential medical or mental
        health condition.
        4.1.3.3.4. DPANM (or ARC/SGP) directs. DPANM may identify conditions via an
        Annual or Modified RILO and direct the MTF to submit an Initial RILO package.
        4.1.3.3.5. PCS, TDY or Deployment Cancellation or Curtailment for a medical or
        mental health reason.
     4.1.3.4. AAC 81, Pregnancy Reviews. The MSME function will query ASIMS for all
     AAC 81 cases monthly and the continued pregnancy status will be confirmed by the
     Women’s Health Clinic (or equivalent section that manages pregnant airmen). (T-1)
     Discrepancies will be resolved to ensure the earliest possible return of the Airman to
     unrestricted duty. (T-1) MSME will report to the DAWG on the overall rate of AAC 81
     cases and the status of discrepancies. (T-1)
     4.1.3.5. MPF Reconciliation. At least annually, and when deemed appropriate by the
     DAWG, MSME will request from the installation MPS a list of all personnel with an
     AAC 31, 37, and 81 for reconciliation with ASIMS data. (T-2) This reconciliation will
     be documented in the DAWG minutes, but will only need further discussion/investigation
     if significant discrepancies are found. (T-2)
     4.1.3.6. Modified RILO due dates. The PEBLO (or ARC equivalent) will track
     Modified RILO due dates for all personnel with an ALC-C. (T-1) MSME (or PH) will
     assist in keeping this list current by advising the PEBLO of any new RILO cases (Airmen
     with an existing ALC-C) identified during the in-processing medical record review
     process (T-1). Prior to each DAWG, the PEBLO will review these records to identify
     problems which require attention. (T-1) Those cases that are identified with problems
     (overdue, complex diagnoses, etc.) will be reviewed at the DAWG with status updates
     provided by both the PEBLO and the PCM on cases currently being worked. (T-1) The
     ARC physical examination section will track ALC-C RILO due dates for WWD cases.
     (T-2)
     4.1.3.7. MEDCON cases. The DAWG shall review initial medical continuation
     (MEDCON) cases for IDES consideration and will collaborate with the ARC Case
     Management Office on subsequent referrals to IDES. (T-2) See AFI 36-2910 for further
     information on management of MEDCON cases. For ARC DAWG, all MEDCON and
     Incapacitation Pay cases are to be reviewed. (T-2)
AFI10-203 20 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                      27


      4.1.3.8. DLC quality review. The SGP and SGH will direct or conduct a review of the
      quality of DLC determinations and FAE as documented on AF Form 469 and present
      monthly statistics (quarterly for the ARC) on this review. (T-1) See AFI 10-203
      Supplemental Guidance for additional information.
          4.1.3.8.1. This review may be accomplished through the facility provider peer review
          program or other means as deemed appropriate by the DAWG, and will address
          questions per the AFI 10-203 Supplemental Guidance. The results will be presented
          to the Professional Staff (or ARC equivalent) at least annually or more frequently as
          determined by the DAWG. (T-2)
          4.1.3.8.2. The proportion of DLCs to be reviewed will be determined by the DAWG
          (and documented in the minutes at least annually) but shall be an adequate sample to
          provide an accurate representation of the quality of DLCs in the MTF. (T-2) A
          specified portion of the DLCs must include FAE. (T-2)
      4.1.3.9. Any potential adverse medical events (ie. Delay in diagnosis or medical error)
      noted at the DAWG should be reported to the SGH and MTF Healthcare Risk Manager
      IAW AFI 44-119.
4.2. DAWG Review for Initial RILO.
   4.2.1. For cases referred to the DAWG, the DAWG will determine whether an Airman’s
   condition(s) meets standards for continuing military service IAW AFI 48-123. (T-1) Once a
   case is referred to the DAWG, it should be reviewed at the next scheduled DAWG meeting,
   but no more than 45 days after the referral is made (for ARC 90 days). (T-1) The DAWG
   review will take into account all available and appropriate information related to the case. (T-
   1) The disposition of the DAWG review can be documented within the ASIMS “Refer to
   DAWG” Tool and may include:
      4.2.1.1. Case dismissal. If the Airman is found to be fit for continued military service
      and mobility based on the information considered, the AF Form 469 may be updated
      appropriately and the case dismissed to routine medical care.
          4.2.1.1.1. Case dismissal does not preclude the Airman being considered for DAWG
          review again in the future for the same condition if the Airman’s status changes.
          4.2.1.1.2. A note will be placed in the Airman’s medical record indicating that the
          condition was reviewed for possible MEB or FFD and found to be fit without need
          for Initial RILO or MEB. (T-1) See AFI 10-203 Supplement and ASIMS “Refer to
          DAWG” Tool Guidance for additional information.
      4.2.1.2. Initial RILO or FFD referral. The condition does not meet medical retention
      standards and/or the Airmen is not capable of deploying without some restrictions. In
      these cases, Initial RILO will be initiated IAW paragraph 4.2 of this Instruction and AFI
      41-210. (T-1) For those cases where the Airman’s hospitalization or treatment progress
      appears to have medically stabilized but the final prognosis or outcome may not be
      known for more than a year, the referral for Initial RILO will not be delayed as long as
      the course of recovery is relatively predictable and a reasonable determination can be
      made that the condition will be unlikely to resolve or improve to meet standards IAW
28                                                        AFI10-203 20 NOVEMBER 2014


     AFI 48-123 within 12 months. (T-1) See AFI 10-203 Supplemental Guide for additional
     information.
  4.2.2. Initial RILO. Once the DAWG Chair directs that an Initial RILO is indicated, MSME
  will initiate an AAC 37 on the Airman’s AF Form 469. (T-1) Individual providers will not
  initiate the AAC 37. (T-1) Once applied, the AAC 37 will remain in effect until DPANM
  directs removal via the AFPC/FL 4 or ARC SGP by memorandum. (T-1)
     4.2.2.1. Once the Code 37 is initiated by the DAWG, the PEBLO will coordinate
     bringing the Initial RILO package to the next DAWG meeting IAW AFI 41-210. (T-1) If
     the Initial RILO package is not ready to present at the next DAWG meeting, the case
     must be tracked as an open item in the DAWG minutes, with an explanation of why it is
     delayed, until the package is complete and has been reviewed by the DAWG. (T-1) The
     MSME will also coordinate having the provider attend the DAWG if the DAWG Chair
     deems this appropriate. (T-1)
     4.2.2.2. Once the Initial RILO package is complete (to include all specialty consultations
     and special studies), the entire package must be reviewed by the DAWG and signed off
     by either the SGH or SGP to ensure that it is complete and accurate. (T-1) This step
     serves as a final quality review and will be completed no more than 30 days (one UTA
     for ARC) after the case was initially reviewed at the DAWG. (T-1) If the final review is
     delayed beyond 30 days, the reason for the delay will be documented in the DAWG
     minutes. (T-1)
     4.2.2.3. The Initial RILO packages will be forwarded to DPANM or ARC SGP as
     applicable for adjudication with a recommendation from the DAWG for either MEB or
     RTD (this recommendation is not binding on the adjudication by DPANM or ARC SGP)
     IAW AFI 41-210. (T-1)
  4.2.3. DPANM or ARC SGP Adjudication. DPANM or ARC SGP as applicable will review
  the Initial RILO packages and will advise the PEBLO of the disposition via the AFPC Form
  4 or as communicated from the ARC SGP. The disposition by DPANM or ARC SGP is final
  and has the same effect and authority as a MEB. The PEBLO will follow instructions noted
  below and in AFI 41-210. (T-1) The MSME will ensure below actions occur. (T-1)
     4.2.3.1. RTD. If DPANM or ARC SGP directs that the Airman is RTD, the PEBLO will
     notify MSME and the provider. (T-1) MSME will immediately release the AAC 37. (T-
     1) AF Forms 422 and AF Form 469 will be initiated or updated (as appropriate) to reflect
     ongoing restrictions deemed appropriate by the DAWG. (T-1) A disposition of RTD
     does not preclude the Airman being considered for Initial RILO again for the same
     condition if the condition changes or deteriorates enough to warrant re-consideration.
     4.2.3.2. ALC-C. DPANM or ARC SGP may direct RTD with application of an ALC-C.
     The PEBLO will notify MSME and the provider, and MSME will immediately release
     the AAC 37. (T-1) AF Forms 422 and AF Form 469 will be initiated or updated (as
     appropriate) with language directed by DPANM or ARC SGP as applicable and ongoing
     restrictions deemed appropriate by the DAWG. (T-1) MSME will use specific ALC-C
     language as outlined in AFI 41-210. (T-1)
         4.2.3.2.1. DPANM is the authority to assign or remove the ALC-C on AD Airmen.
         The appropriate ARC SGP is the authority to assign or remove the ALC-C for ARC
AFI10-203 20 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                  29


          Airmen. An assigned ALC-C code may be stratified based on risk to the individual
          as well as medical requirements. The code may be valid indefinitely, but must be
          reviewed and renewed IAW AFI 41-210 or specific guidance from DPANM or the
          appropriate ARC SGP for ARC Airmen.
          4.2.3.2.2. For Initial RILOs returned from DPANM or ARC SGP with direction for
          RTD or ALC-C, MSME, in coordination with the provider and PO, will ensure that
          appropriate long-term FR and FAE are included on the AF Form 469 if indicated for
          review with annual PHA. (T-1)
       4.2.3.3. Refer for MEB. If DPANM or ARC SGP determines that the Airman may be
       unfit for military duty, an MEB will be directed. (Note: Does not apply to NILOD
       conditions for ARC, see paragraph 4.2.4. of this Instruction) The PEBLO will notify
       MSME to ensure that the AAC 37 stays valid. (T-1) The PEBLO will initiate the VA
       Form 21-0819 VA/DoD Joint Disability Evaluation Board Claim, then forward the form
       to the provider for further clinical information and signature to initiate the Veteran’s
       Affairs (VA) evaluation as part of the IDES IAW AFI 41-210 and other applicable
       regulations within 10 duty days of receiving the Form 4 from DPANM. (T-1)
       4.2.3.4. Other. DPANM or ARC SGP may send a case back to the MTF for ongoing
       medical management, they may return with no action (reason will be provided), or they
       may request additional information. In each of these cases, appropriate restrictions and
       MTF actions will be detailed on the AFPC Form 4 or ARC SGP memorandum, to include
       disposition of the AAC 37. (T-1)
   4.2.4. ARC Airmen with non-service connected issues will have a FFD/WWD
   determination. The respective ARC SGP will generally use the same Initial RILO package
   requirements for FFD/WWD determinations as AD Initial RILOs, but may specify additional
   (or fewer) criteria and processes. AD units supporting ARC Airmen will obtain and maintain
   a copy of applicable guidance. (T-2)
   4.2.5. The authority to deploy an Airman with an ALC-C is based on stratification levels, or
   as specified in the reporting instructions for a defined deployment. A description of ALC
   stratification and the process for waiver requests are detailed in AFI 41-210.
4.3. Metrics.
   4.3.1. The MSME function will develop a report from ASIMS data reflecting the current
   status of their wing and supported units, reporting through the DAWG to the MTF executive
   function and wing Commander (as required) via the AMC. (T-1) Components of the report
   will include:
       4.3.1.1. Fully Mission Capable (FMC, formerly Medically Mobility Ready (MMR))
       percentage. These Airmen are “green” for all ASIMS requirements and are capable of
       deploying with no medical actions required.

     with AAC 31, 37, or 81.        It also includes Airmen with an ALC, regardless of
     stratification.
  4.3.2. Diagnosis and Medication Surveillance. At least ten times per year, MSME will
  present findings to the DAWG of selected diagnostic or medication using queries as directed
  by the SGH to ensure Airmen with certain medical conditions do not remain unidentified in
  the mobility reporting system. (T-1) MSME will ensure the reviews are performed and will
  present findings at the DAWG, e.g., cases that may need DLC action or Initial RILO to the
  DAWG. (T-1) The SGH will ensure these findings are also presented at the Professional
  Staff or other appropriate forum at least annually. (T-2) See AFI 10-203 Supplemental
  Guidance for additional instructions. ARC should perform no less than quarterly.
  4.3.3. In addition to the above metrics, the DAWG will track the following data each month
  and report to the MTF Executive committee via the AMC (quarterly for the ARC): (T-1)
     4.3.3.1. Timelines and outcomes related to Initial RILOs/MEBs, as follows:
         4.3.3.1.1. Average duration from the date a potential Initial RILO case via a trigger
         event is identified to the PEBLO/MSME until the DAWG determination for Initial
         RILO or case dismissal. (T-2) Metric is < 45 days. Each case that exceeds the metric
         will be documented in the DAWG minutes including the cause for the delay. (T-2)
         4.3.3.1.2. Average duration from DAWG determination for Initial RILO until the
         case is transmitted to DPANM or ARC SGP as applicable (cases dismissed by the
         DAWG will not be included). (T-2) Metric < 30 days. Each case that exceeds metric
         will be documented in the DAWG minutes. (T-2)
         4.3.3.1.3. Average duration from DPANM or ARC SGP notification to the MTF to
         conduct an MEB until referral into the IDES system. (T-2) Metric within 10 duty
         days (ARC next UTA). Each case that exceeds metric will be documented in the
         DAWG minutes. (T-2)
         4.3.3.1.4. IDES Metrics as stated by AFI 41-210 and other guidance to PEBLO to
         monitor the IDES process. Each case that exceeds metric will be documented in the
         DAWG minutes. (T-2)
     4.3.3.2. Overdue rate for Annual RILO cases (#cases overdue at time of DAWG
     meeting/total ALC-C cases in MTF rosters). (T-2)

                                          Chapter 5

FITNESS FOR DUTY (FFD)/ WORLD WIDE DUTY (WWD) AND PRESUMPTION OF
                              FITNESS

5.1. ARC Airmen. ARC Airmen entitled to disability processing IAW 36-3212, Physical
Evaluation for Retention, Retirement, and Separation, will undergo Initial RILO processing by
RegAF MTFs. (T-2) ARC Airmen with non-duty related issues will undergo FFD/WWD
processing by the ARC medical unit and be reviewed by the appropriate ARC SGP. (T-2) ARC
SGP will provide additional guidance as needed. For FFD purposes, Commanders and their
designees must receive medical information for fitness for duty determinations. Only the
minimum information necessary will be provided. If disclosures of this information have not
been specifically authorized by the Airman, the MTF will account for the disclosures IAW AFI
41-210. (T-0) DoDI 1332.38, 45 CFR §§164.502(b), 164.508, 164.512(k), DoD 6025.18-R,
C8.2 ).
5.2. Presumption of Fitness. The existence of a physical defect or condition does not in itself
necessarily provide justification for or entitlement to an Initial RILO, MEB, ALC, or FFD. For
most Airmen approaching retirement, a full MEB is not necessary (see AFI 41-210, paragraph
4.53.1.4.). DPANM will review the Initial RILO package and determine the appropriate case
disposition. Review by ARC SGP for the ARC will suffice unless the presumption of fitness is
in doubt; ARC SGP retains the authority for medical hold in cases where presumption of fitness
is in doubt for ARC Airmen. See AFI 36-3212, paragraph 3.17. for further guidance regarding
presumption of fitness.

 LIMITED SCOPE MEDICAL TREATMENT FACILITIES (LSMTF) AND MEDICAL
                        AID STATIONS (MAS)

6.1. Definitions.
   6.1.1. LSMTFs are medical elements, flights, or small medical squadrons with a credentialed
   medical provider that do not provide the scope of services found in a medical group.
   LSMTFs are typically assigned to a line squadron or group (e.g. Air Base Squadron, Mission
   Support Group or Air Base Group). In some cases, a LSMTF may report directly to a wing
   or MAJCOM.
   6.1.2. MAS are small medical elements without a credentialed medical provider and are
   typically located at a geographically separated unit (GSU) or a Munitions Support Squadron
   (MUNSS) site.
       6.1.2.1. MUNSS sites are GSUs responsible for receipt, storage, maintenance and control
       of United States War Reserve Munitions in support of the North Atlantic Treaty
       Organization (NATO) and its strike missions. See AFI 21-200, Munitions and Missile
       Maintenance Management.
       6.1.2.2. GSUs are units that are not at the same physical location or base as the parent
       unit.
6.2. Responsibilities.
   6.2.1. MAJCOM/SG. The MAJCOM/SG for the supported GSU and MUNSS (LSMTF,
   MAS, and GSU without LSMTF or MAS) will assign the nearest AD AF MTF as the
   supporting MTF (with written concurrence of the MAJCOM/SG for the supporting MTF if
   assigned to a different MAJCOM), for each GSU and MUNSS within their area of
   responsibility to assist with the documentation and administrative management of Airmen
   with DLC.
   6.2.2. Supporting MTF/CC
       6.2.2.1. Is ultimately responsible for the documentation and administrative management
       of Airmen with DLCs as defined in this AFI at the GSU and MUNSS sites and will
       ensure appropriate support is provided. (T-1)

       MTF personnel to meet the requirements to support assigned GSU and MUNSS sites
       based on current manpower models and increased workload. (T-1)
       6.2.2.3. Will ensure a credentialed provider, preferably a PO, is available to counsel
       Airmen placed on AAC 31, 37, or 81 at the GSU and MUNSS sites. (T-2) This
       counseling may occur via video teleconference or telephone when circumstances do not
       allow face-to-face contact but will be documented by the credentialed provider in the
       Airman’s electronic medical record. (T-1)
   6.2.3. MTF SGP at supporting MTF. Will ensure appropriate documentation and
   administrative management of Airmen with DLCs at the GSU or MUNSS sites. (T-1)
AFI10-203 20 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                     33


  6.2.4. PO at the supporting MTF will perform PO duties for Airmen assigned to supported
  GSU or MUNSS sites who require an AF Form 422 or AF Form 469. (T-1)
     6.2.4.1. If the GSU or MUNSS site Airman is not empanelled to a PCM at the supporting
     MTF and receives duty limitation recommendations from a civilian provider, the PO at
     the supporting MTF will initiate an AF Form 469 using the civilian provider’s
     recommendations as a guide. (T-1) If the GSU or MUNSS Airman is empanelled, the
     PCM will perform this function. (T-1) The AF provider that transcribes the civilian
     provider’s recommendations retains final authority on the restrictions placed on the AF
     Form 469. (T-1)
  6.2.5. DAWG at the supporting MTF will administratively manage the DLC, AAC 31, 37,
  81, ALC-C, and RILO (Initial and Annual) cases from the GSU and MUNSS sites as
  outlined in this Instruction. (T-1)
  6.2.6. MSME at the supporting MTF will perform the MSME functions as outlined in this
  instruction for the supported GSU and MUNSS sites. (T-1) Video teleconferencing,
  teleconferencing, or electronic data and communication systems may be used to facilitate
  these functions. (T-1)
  6.2.7. The PEBLO at the supporting MTF will perform their functions as outlined in this
  Instruction and AFI 41-210 for the supported GSU and MUNSS sites. (T-1) Video
  teleconferencing, teleconferencing, or electronic data and communication systems may be
  used to facilitate these functions. (T-1)
  6.2.8. LSMTF Officer in Charge (OIC) or Non-commissioned Officer in Charge (NCOIC).
     6.2.8.1. Will ensure that patients presenting for care are evaluated, treated and/or referred
     as appropriate by a credentialed provider. (T-1) Note: Credentialed providers at a
     LSMTF will have the same scope of responsibility as providers at the supporting MTF to
     include the appropriate evaluation, clinical management, referral, DLC and profile
     disposition, and narrative summary preparation as appropriate for their patients.
     6.2.8.2. Will ensure that information for patients with DLCs is entered into ASIMS and,
     when indicated, made available electronically to the supporting MTF for MSME review
     and PO approval IAW this Instruction. (T-1)
     6.2.8.3. Will ensure that medical records and provider staff are made available for the
     supporting MTF DAWG. (T-1)
     6.2.8.4. Will coordinate with GSU and MUNSS site Commanders to ensure Airmen
     obtain the required exams and studies. (T-1)
     6.2.8.5. Will ensure that LSMTF credentialed providers prepare an appropriate narrative
     summary when required within the time specified by policy and provide all supporting
     documents and information for Initial and Annual RILOs, MEB, or other IDES
     processing to the supporting MTF. (T-1)
     6.2.8.6. If no LSMTF credentialed provider is available, the LSMTF OIC/NCOIC will
     ensure Airmen with a DLC that restricts mobility (AAC 31, 37, or 81) are referred to the
     supporting MTF to receive counseling by a credentialed provider, preferably a PO. (T-1)
     This counseling may occur via video teleconference or telephone when circumstances do
34                                                          AFI10-203 20 NOVEMBER 2014


     not allow face-to-face contact but will be documented by the credentialed provider in the
     Airman’s electronic medical record. (T-1)
  6.2.9. OIC overseeing MAS:
     6.2.9.1. Will ensure that patients presenting for care are evaluated, treated and/or referred
     as appropriate under the supervision of a credentialed provider. (T-1) Note: MAS
     medical personnel will provide documentation and management of Airmen with DLCs as

responsibility of all Airmen, for purposes of this AFI, fitness activities are not included in the
definition of Duty Restrictions.
Fitness Assessment Exemption—a recommendation resulting from a medical evaluation which,
if applied explicitly, restricts one or more components of the Air Force Fitness Assessment
Fitness for Duty— Refers to the evaluation process when a service member has a condition
which is questionable or disqualifying for military duty and not be in the line of duty. See AFI
48-123, Chapter 10 for additional details.
Fitness Restriction—a recommendation resulting from a medical evaluation which, if applied
explicitly, restricts activities that an Airman may perform as part of a personal, unit-based fitness
program, and/or Air Force Fitness Assessment.
Functional (or Physical) Limitation—the inability of an Airman to perform specific physical
movements or actions based on an assessment of the Airman’s injury or illness by a medical
professional.

Functional (or Physical) Restriction—a report of an Airman’s injury or illness, based on
evaluation by a medical professional, that describes specific physical activities or functions that
are recommended for the Airman to avoid to allow recovery or reduce risk of further injury.
Mobility Restriction—a recommendation resulting from a medical evaluation which, if applied
explicitly, limits or restricts an Airmen’s participation in deployment or mobility actions.
Mobility qualifications are outlined in AFI 48-123.
Physical Profile—a long-standing or permanent assessment of an Airman’s ability to participate
in military activities. The physical profile is described using the PULHES system IAW AFI 48-
123 with additional information in the Medical Standards Directory. It is validated annually at
the PHA and as needed for actions related to Air Force career development.
Preventive Health Assessment (PHA)—A recurring assessment of an Airman’s health status
IAW AFI 44-170.
