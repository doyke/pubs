same amount of retention credit as Luke employees with acceptable ratings during Reduction In
Force in accordance with appropriate law, rule or regulation.
2.7.4. With the available funds in the organization awards program, the Awards Approving
Official will grant Performance Awards to all employees who receive an Acceptable rating
taking into consideration various circumstances during the rating period. Such circumstances for
any exceptions are: disciplinary action, extended sick leave, insufficient award justification,
leave without pay, length of time in position, long-term full-time training, and promotion.
