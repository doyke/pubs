                                                Chapter 1

                                               GENERAL

1.1. Overview          . This instruction provides guidance and responsibilities to Air Force aircrew
munitions requirements. This instruction is applicable to all Air Force, ANG and AF Reserve units who
authorize, allocate, expend, or manage aircrew training munitions.
     1.1.1. Aircrew members expend munitions during combat, training, operational readiness
     inspections, weapons competitions, exercises, tests, or demonstrations. Logistics agencies manage
     munitions assets and loading procedures in accordance with AFI 21-101, Aircraft and Equipment
     Maintenance Management, AFI 21-201, Conventional Munitions Maintenance Management, and
     AFI 25-101, War Reserve Materiel (WRM) Program Guidance and Procedures. Agencies requiring
     aircrew type munitions will assist with forecasting and validating munitions requirements, managing
     unit munitions allocations, and providing operational expertise.
     1.1.2. DoD Instruction 3000.4, DoD Munitions Requirements Process (MRP), para 4.1, directs the
     Military Departments to establish munitions requirements, in accordance with the Guidance for
     Development of the Force (GDF) and Guidance for the Employment of the Force (GEF), enabling
     military forces to perform their assigned military mission. The munitions requirements shall:
        1.1.2.1. Address the operational objectives of the Combatant Commanders against potential
        threats, consider logistics capabilities, retain residual capability to perform continuing missions
        and support Current Operation/Forward Presence Requirements (CO/FPR) at the end of any
        major combat operation (MCO) and identify sufficient test and training munitions to achieve and
        maintain readiness.
     1.1.3. The Air Force develops and publishes the Total Munitions Requirement (TMR) to support
     MRP reporting responsibilities. DoDI 3000.4 defines TMR as follows:
        1.1.3.1. Total Munitions Requirement: The sum of war reserve munitions requirements and
        Training and Testing Requirement (TTR).
            1.1.3.1.1. War Reserve Munitions Requirement: The sum of combat requirements, strategic
            readiness requirements, and CO/FPRs.
               1.1.3.1.1.1. Combat Requirement: The quantity of munitions required to equip a
               specified force structure to perform its assigned military mission and to meet Combatant
               Command (COCOM) objectives, including munitions needed for risk mitigation.
               1.1.3.1.1.2. Current Operation/Forward Presence Requirements (CO/FPRs): The sum of
               the munitions required to arm forces to conduct current operations and meet forward
               presence obligations. Forward presence includes Global Naval Force Presence Policy
               and operations as directed by the President.
               1.1.3.1.1.3. Strategic Readiness Requirement: The quantity of munitions needed to arm
               forces not committed to support combat operations in the assigned MCOs, as well as
               those in the strategic reserve. Includes any additional munitions requirements generated
               from treaties or statutory obligations to allies.
            1.1.3.1.2. Training and Testing Requirement (TTR): Munitions required to train the force
            and support Military Department programs ensuring that weapons and platforms deliver the
            intended effectiveness (can be stated as an annual requirement, a FYDP requirement, and/or
AFI11-212 8 APRIL 2009                                                                                 5


          projected life cycle of each munitions). Surveillance, acceptance testing, and production
          losses of munitions items are accounted for in this category.
      1.1.3.2. AF/A5RC accomplishes its obligations to DoD MRP using the Non-Nuclear
      Consumables Annual Analysis (NCAA) process. Procedures outlined in this AFI support this
      effort by defining the test and training requirement portion of the overall munitions requirements.
1.2. Forecasting Aircrew Munitions Requirements.
   1.2.1. The Ready Aircrew Forecasting Tool (RAFT) is an automated program that calculates
   aircrew training munitions requirements. RAFT utilizes authorized aircrew ratios from AFI 65-503,
   USAF Cost and Planning Factors, number of Primary Mission Aircraft Inventory (PMAI), ratio of
   actual Combat Mission Ready (CMR)/Basic Mission Capable (BMC) aircrew and the required
   events listed on the Ready Aircrew Program (RAP) tasking message. Formal Training Unit (FTU)
   and Weapons School (WS) requirements are based on the number of students per course and the
   number/types of items required to complete syllabus events. FTU and WS are given direct
   support munitions for instructor performance demonstration requirements. RAFT uses test plan
   munitions requirements to capture test requirements.
   1.2.2. The RAFT program allows for the rapid consolidation and standardization of Major
   Command (MAJCOM) test and training munitions requirements into a single USAF reference
   document. This consolidated source directly supports munitions allocation decisions that are made
   in conjunction with actual munitions inventory availability. RAFT can also illustrate the potential
   impact on training munitions as a result of force structure adjustments.
   1.2.3. Only Primary Mission Aircraft Inventory (PMAI), Primary Training Aircraft Inventory
   (PTAI), and Primary Development/Test Aircraft Inventory (PDAI) aircraft garner munitions
   authorizations. Attrition Reserve (A/R) and Backup Aircraft Inventory (BAI) aircraft are not used in
   requirements computations.
   1.2.4. ACC/A3TW will develop and validate training and combat fly-away requirements and
   capture test requirements for all users except those noted in 1.2.4.1. These requirements will be
   submitted to AF/A5RC and the 784th Combat Sustainment Group’s Global Ammunition Control
   Point no later than the suspense date published in the Peacetime Conventional Ammunitions
   Requirements (PCAR) forecast submission instruction memorandum.
      1.2.4.1. HQ Air Force Material Command (AFMC) and HQ Air Force Special Operations
      Command (AFSOC) will develop and validate training and combat fly-away requirements and
      capture test requirements for their commands. These requirements will be submitted to
      AF/A5RC and the 784th Combat Sustainment Group’s Global Ammunition Control Point no
      later than the suspense date published in the Peacetime Conventional Ammunitions
      Requirements (PCAR) forecast submission instruction memorandum.
   1.2.5. The 784th Combat Support Group website on the AF Portal Agile Munitions Support Tool
   (AMST) module will be used to submit and manage Out-of-Cycle Requests (OOCR) and Allocation
   Transfer Requests (ATR).
   1.2.6. Munitions are forecasted using correct major category and requirement codes to identify their
   intended use. Use of munitions for other than their intended purpose is strictly prohibited. A
   complete list of major category codes is published in the annual PCAR instruction memorandum.
1.3. Munitions/Missile Shortages.
6                                                                        AFI11-212 8 APRIL 2009


    1.3.1. AF/A5RC will determine munitions use category prioritization when physical assets are not
    available to support requirements. This determination will be approved by AF/A5R and briefed by
    AF/A5RC at the beginning of the annual munitions allocation conference. As a general rule,
    category prioritization will be as follows:
       1.3.1.1. Homeland Defense.
       1.3.1.2. Combat Fly-Away.
       1.3.1.3. Combat requirements.
       1.3.1.4. Test support.
       1.3.1.5. Higher Headquarters tasking.
       1.3.1.6. MAJCOM approved Weapons School and FTU syllabi.
           1.3.1.6.1. Weapons School and FTU syllabi requirements will be supported to a minimum of
           80% of the validated requirement for those items less than 100% but greater than 50%
           supportable when possible. Allocations supporting these requirements for items less than
           50% supportable will be negotiated at the allocations conference. AF/A5RC will make final
           determinations.
       1.3.1.7. Unit RAP training.
       1.3.1.8. Host unit support of deployed unit training (e.g. RED FLAG; GREEN FLAG, Weapons
       Instructor Course (WIC) support, Weapons System Evaluation Program (WSEP) support, etc).
       1.3.1.9. Foreign Military Training Support (FMTS) category ―N‖.

      assets are not available to meet all requirements.
      2.10.2. Submit predicted munitions requirements for their test programs to their supporting
      MAJCOM. Test items may include spare items in order to meet restrictive range or test time tables,
      however these additional items must be identified as spare items and are authorized for use only
      when a primary item can not be used. If testing requires additional test items, test managers will
      submit an OOCR.
      2.10.3. Increased range, complexity and lethality of many weapons routinely require the use of a
      Telemetry (TM) Instrumentation Kit (TIK) and/or Flight Termination System (FTS) during
      developmental and operational test and evaluation as well as testing during sustainment. The
      guidance for forecasting and programming for these assets is contained in AFI 99-120, Forecasting

               AIRCREW MUNITIONS REQUIREMENTS/AUTHORIZATIONS

3.1. Non-Expendable Captive Carry Aircrew Training Munitions.
   3.1.1. Aircrew Captive Carry Training Munitions/Missiles are used for practice attacks with air-to-
   air and air-to-surface training munitions that emulate weapons switchology and attack profiles.
   Units do not forecast these requirements. ACC/A3TW will determine requirements based on
   anticipated wartime tasking and established standards in coordination with MAJCOMs. (Reference
   Attachment 4 for the Non-Expendable Captive Carry Aircrew Munitions Load Factor/Standards.
   (HQ AFSOC will develop the requirements for AFSOC units)).
   3.1.2. WS and FTU units may forecast for inert/dummy items for classroom training requirements.
   However, these forecasts will be limited to inert bomb bodies, fuzes, fin assemblies, and other small
   component items. Items such that are all up rounds such as, Joint Standoff Weapon, Wind
   Corrected Munitions Dispenser , Joint Air to Surface Standoff Missile, Small Diameter Bomb,
   Terminal Guided Missile, Captive Air Training Missiles, etc., are not forecasted.
3.2. Non-Expendable Air Munitions Training Authorization for Load and Ground Crews.
   3.2.1. Units, managers, and custodians will forecast for the minimum quantities of non-expendable
   air munitions required to provide realistic munitions production, maintenance, and weapons load
   crew training. Forecasts will be compiled using the Air Force Standard for Non-Expendable Air
   Munitions Training Authorizations obtained on the AF/A4LW Knowledge Now CoP on the Air
   Force portal.
   3.2.2. The non-expendable training munitions standards provide basic requirements for weapons
   load crew, sortie generation operations, combat munitions maintenance training, nuclear weapon
   loading, maintenance, and handling training, exercises, evaluations, inspections, and competitions.
      3.2.2.1. The standard explains how these authorizations are established, reviewed and revised.
      These authorization standards are the primary source used to forecast non-expendable air
      munitions for training.
   3.2.3. Justifications referenced in other validated Air Force and Higher Headquarters directives that
   identify munitions requirements may be included in requirements forecasts and may exceed the Air
   Force standard requirements, if fully justified.
   3.2.4. The OPR for these standards is AF/A4LW. Submit comments, changes and suggested
   improvements concerning this standard and these authorizations through command channels to
   AF/A4LW, 1030 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1030 or through e-mail: AF/A4LW
   Workflow. AF/A4LW will coordinate changes with all OPRs and OCRs.
3.3. Expendable Training Munitions.
   3.3.1. Aircrew training munitions authorizations are based on flying training sorties/events as set by
   the Ready Aircrew Program, approved syllabus training, Test Requirements, Operational Readiness
   Inspections (ORIs), select exercise/competitions, and special demonstrations.
   3.3.2. Aircrew training munitions requirements are calculated using RAFT. ACC/A3TW will
   provide MAJCOMs/units with individual copies of the RAFT program for their review prior to the
   annual ACC Test/Training Munitions Working Group conference. (Does not apply to AFMC or
   AFSOC.)
 12                                                                             AFI11-212 8 APRIL 2009


      3.3.3. For effective training, some training events (i.e., chaff/flare/20-30mm ammo, etc) may require
      more than one expenditure/event to complete. When expenditures per event are not defined by
      appropriate training guidance, the individual RAFT tables will be the source utilized to derive the
      munitions requirement. This RAFT table value will be established with a consensus of
      MAJCOM/Unit representatives at the annual ACC Test/Training Munitions Working Group
      (TTMWG), or via email.
         3.3.3.1. In the event a consensus cannot be reached, AF/A5RC will use the ACC approved
         number from the most current Realistic Training Review Board (RTRB) to set the maximum
         allowable value. AF/A5RC may establish lower values in order to manage limited stockpiles
         and/or to allow for more-timely positioning of WRM assets in the field.
         3.3.3.2. Use of common event definitions (number of items per event) will help ensure equitable
         sharing between all users, especially where assets are not 100% supportable for training.
      3.3.4. Additional munitions may be authorized for ORIs, selected exercises/competitions, or certain
      special demonstrations. The office of primary responsibility (OPR) will forecast and send their
      requirements to ACC/A3TW, HQ AFMC, or HQ AFSOC for inclusion into the annual forecast.
      OPRs are the MAJCOM Inspectors General, and/or the appropriate exercise/competition OPRs.
      These OPRs are responsible for ensuring munitions allocations are transferred to the tasked units.
         3.3.4.1. Additional munitions are not authorized for RED FLAG, GREEN FLAG, AEF spin-up,
         or most deployment/exercises. During these deployments/exercises, aircrews are completing
         normal training events at an alternate location. Every attempt should be made to forecast these
         requirements at the location they will be used.
3.4. Developmental and Operational Test Munitions.           Developmental and Operational Test
Munitions are required to support Developmental Test and Evaluation (DT&E), Operational Test and
Evaluation (OT&E), Tactics Developmental and Evaluation (TD&E) as well as other test projects such
as Weapons System Evaluation Program (WSEP), Air Force SEEK EAGLE Program (SK), and major
System Design & Development (SDD) tests.
      3.4.1. Responsible Test Organizations (RTO) must forecast for the munitions needed for all tests
      and coordinate their forecast with the supporting MASO. RTO/Major System Program Offices
      (SPO) will consolidate standard munitions test requirements and forecast by organization. Munitions
      required to support test requirements should be allocated to a specific test plan or directive. RTOs
      should forecast munitions requirements by Complete Round Code (CRC) whenever possible in lieu
      of the component Master National Stock Number (MNSN). MNSNs may only be used when a CRC
      has not been developed, suitable substitutes are not available or incorrectly catalogued, or when the
      CRC would not be appropriate for use. Telemetry (TM) Instrumentation Kit (TIK) and/or Flight
      Termination System (FTS) requirements must be considered and programming for these items will
      be accomplished IAW AFI 99-120. Test munitions, TM, TIK, and FTS requirements will be
      projected concurrently with the Future Years Defense Program (FYDP).
         3.4.1.1. Test forecasts may include spin-up requirements to maintain aircrew proficiency
         throughout the fiscal year. However, back-to-back test using the same munitions should not
         require two sets of spin-up munitions. Spin-up requirements will be identified separately from
         actual test requirements via requirement code.
         3.4.1.2. Expedited procedures may be used in cases where short notice testing is required due to
         unique situations (i.e., safety, potential reliability issues, expedited integration due to possible
AFI11-212 8 APRIL 2009                                                                               13


       combat, etc). Test agencies are strongly encouraged to submit their requests at the earliest
       possible time. Expedited procedures are not a substitute for planned tests on a known schedule.
3.5. Combat Fly-Away Munitions. Combat Fly-Away munitions are specifically intended to equip
bomber, fighter, airlift, Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR), and Special Operations Forces (SOF)
aircraft with munitions that could be employed enroute to the deployed location or would reduce aircraft
regeneration or aircrew preparation time upon arrival at the deployed location.
   3.5.1. Combat Fly-Away munitions are a fly to the fight authorization. AF/A5RC must approve all
   requests to load-out quantities greater than the current fiscal year allocation.
       3.5.1.1. Units are not authorized to expend combat Fly-Away munitions for test and training
       requirements without prior written approval from their parent MAJCOM. Procedures for
       obtaining approval are contained in AFI 25-101, War Reserve Materiel (WRM) Program
       Guidance and Procedures.
       3.5.1.2. Units are not authorized to use/load-out combat Fly-Away munitions during Air
       Expeditionary Force (AEF) rotations or AEF aircraft swap-outs unless specifically tasked to do
       so by deployment/operational order, air tasking order, or by higher headquarters.
       3.5.1.3. Air-to-Air missiles required to support Fly-Away will be supported by the TAMP
       program and allocations distributed via AMST.
3.6. Combat Munitions Requirements. Combat munitions requirements are computed by AF/A5RC
using the Non-nuclear Consumables Annual Analysis (NCAA) process. Normally, CONUS units do not
garner combat munitions allocations. However, when the NCAA process identifies specific MDS that
are tasked to fly CONUS-CONUS combat sorties, gaining theater commanders will coordinate the pre-
positioning of a portion of their combat allocation at the tasked unit with ACC/A3TW and ACC/A4MW.
3.7. Tactical Air Missile Program (TAMP). The TAMP document defines the processes and policy
for computing live Air-to-Air missile requirements for Test, WRM, Fly-Away, and non-expendable inert
Captive Carry requirements for test/training. This program is managed by AF/A5RC and is part of the
NCAA. The TAMP document is augmented by AFI 99-108, and must be strictly adhered to.
   3.7.1. All USAF Captive Carry missile requirements will be computed by ACC/A3TW IAW the
   standards in Attachment 4 using the Captive Carry Missile Forecasting Tool (CCMFT).
   ACC/A3TW will provide MAJCOMs/units with individual copies of the CCMFT results for their
   review prior to the annual ACC Test/Training Munitions Working Group conference.
   3.7.2. Fly-Away tactical missile requirements will be developed by ACC/A3TW and finalized at the
   TAMP conference.
   3.7.3. As appropriate, tactical AUR AIM-9 missiles include one TMU-72 coolant tank (argon bottle)
   per allocated missile. An additional allocation of one TMU-72 coolant tank per allocated Category
   ―G‖ missile will be allocated to facilitate quick turn of the missiles during combat operations. An
   additional allocation of one half (0.5) TMU-72 coolant tank per allocated Category ―F‖ & ―T‖
   missiles will be allocated to facilitate quick turn of the missiles during Fly-Away and Homeland
   Defense operations.
3.8. Afloat Prepositioned Fleet (APF) Munitions Vessels.              APF munitions are swing-stocks
designated for pre-positioning on the Afloat Prepositioned Fleet (APF).
 14                                                                           AFI11-212 8 APRIL 2009


      3.8.1. APF ship reconstitution has highest priority for munitions allocations during the allocation
      cycle the reconstitution is to be performed. Munitions required to support reloading efforts may not
      available for allocation to other tasks.
3.9. Foreign Military Operations and Training Munitions. Foreign military operations and training
munitions requests will be provided to ACC/A3TW for inclusion in RAFT.
3.10. Current Operations. Current operations munitions are required for daily operations, such as
airlift flights over hostile areas, drug interdiction, or Operation Noble Eagle for protection of AF
installations, equipment, personnel, and homeland security operations. These munitions are not
expected to be expended, except during the course of real world/daily operational situations.
3.11. Standard Air Munitions Package (STAMP). STAMP munitions are swing-stocks designated
for pre-positioning at STAMP locations within CONUS for rapid deployment to combatant commands.
Operational flying units do not garner munitions allocations under this category.
AFI11-212 8 APRIL 2009                                                                                     15


                                                Chapter 4

                                   REPORTING REQUIREMENTS

4.1. Reporting Requirements. Munitions are managed on a fiscal year (FY) basis and require several
reports. Use of CRC, MNSN, Department of Defense Identification Code (DoDIC), and nomenclature
for aircrew munitions reporting is mandatory. Use MNSN or DoDIC only when a CRC is not applicable
or established.
4.2. Aircrew Munitions Forecast. Units assist in validating their aircrew munitions forecast based on
RAP requirements, MAJCOM, and ACC/A3TW guidance. Forecasts for non-RAP munitions
requirements are due to ACC/A3TW no later than 1 October each year. Extension to this suspense must
be requested and approved by the hosting OG/CC, or equivalent, and forwarded to ACC/A3TW for
consideration.
4.3. End-of-Year expenditure reports. Wings will provide ACC/A3TW an End-of-Year expenditure
report. ACC/A3TW will provide a standard report format that will be available on the NIPRNET web
page for unit use. If needed, to suit individual unit needs, A3TW will assist in providing additional
pages/formats as required. Expenditure totals will be coordinated between unit operations and the
MASO before submission to ensure expenditure quantities are accurate. Allocations will reflect any
OOCR and transfer adjustments. Expenditure data release authority is the OG/CC or equivalent. Note;
HQ AFSOC and HQ AFMC will provide a command expenditure report to ACC/A3TW for inclusion
into the USAF report.
   4.3.1. The End-of-Year report is due to ACC/A3TW NLT 14 October each year. This report must
   include a justification (alibi) if the total expenditure is less than 85% percent of the allocation for the
   year the report referenced. The justification must be specific, i.e., operations driven limitation
   (include weapons, range, deployment issues), logistics related limitation, safety related limitation,
   manufacturer related (items scheduled for delivery direct from vendor but not received), or
   depot/transportation related (items delay by depot work or transportation delays, etc).
   4.3.2. Off-station expenditures must be included in munitions expenditure reports. Off station
   expenditures apply to those munitions expended at another location to which allocations have been
   transferred. If allocations have hot been transferred, expenditures should be counted against home
   station. Do not report expenditures for units from other MAJCOMs operating at an installation on a
   temporary basis.
   4.3.3. ACC/A3TW will provide a synopsis of the consolidated expenditures with alibis to AF/A5RC
   NLT the end of the calendar year.
4.4. Forecast, Allocation, Expenditure Timelines.        The following timeline is provided as
information only and is subject to change. A firm timeline will be published in the annual PCAR
instruction memorandum.

                                              Chapter 5

                     MANAGING AIRCREW MUNITIONS ALLOCATIONS

5.1. Allocation Management.
   5.1.1. Units may be allocated munitions items in more than one category. Munitions must be issued
   and expended for their intended purpose as identified by the category code. (Note: Aircrew
   munitions are managed on Stock Record Account and are not issued to Custody accounts.
   Categorization of an asset expenditure by Category code occurs after actual expenditure, not before.
   Each item must be issued and expended for its intended purpose as identified by the category code.
   5.1.2. Units will monitor allocations closely to ensure authorized and prudent use of munitions. In
   some cases, aircrew munitions are allocated at less than 100% of a unit’s requirement. Assets must
   be expended wisely throughout the fiscal year to ensure effective aircrew training.
   5.1.3. Wing Weapons Officers (WWO) will analyze expenditure rates quarterly to identify potential
   excess allocations. When WWO determine they are unable to use (expend) any portion of their
   fiscal year allocation(s), the allocation(s) will be transferred back to ACC/A3TW for possible
   redistribution to other USAF units.
5.2. Out-of-Cycle Requests (OOCR).          An OOCR is the vehicle for obtaining new, changing, or
increasing munitions annual allocations. The Wing Weapons Officer will submit OOCRs through the
MASO in accordance with AFI 21-201 and MAJCOM-specific guidance. OOCR submitted before an
operational unit expends 70 percent of their current allocation will normally be disapproved. OOCRs
will be submitted to the MASO using the format in Attachment 2. 784th Combat Sustainment Group
website on the AF Portal AMST module will be used for Out-of-Cycle Requests that can not be
supported locally.
   5.2.1. MAJCOMs must add comments to OOCRs submitted by their units. Comments should
   address     as    a     minimum,       additional    supporting    justification,    current   asset
   (allocations/expenditures/transfers and relevant condition code) posture for the item and why it can
   not be supported from within the unit of MAJCOM. The intent is to ensure that units have tried to
   source the allocation within their chain of command first. If unsupportable at the requesting
   unit/Wing, ACC/A3TW will attempt to source from other command/unit allocations before
   submitting the OOCR to A5RC.
5.3. Complete Round Code (CRC) Conversions. CRC conversion requests (example; changing a
live bomb allocation to an inert configuration) will be in the same format as an OOCR with the
exception of the following additional information: ―From CRC‖ and ―To CRC‖ and do not require
OG/CC signature.
5.4. Allocation Transfer Requests (ATR). ATRs are accomplished to transfer an allocation from one
unit to another unit and they may be within or between MAJCOMs. A common use for ATRs would be
to transfer unit munitions to an exercise location for use by that unit during their participation.
ACC/A3TW may direct a transfer from a unit that is unable to expend their allocation to another unit, or
to accomplish higher priority training.
   5.4.1. Units will transfer aircrew allocations IAW the directions in AFI 21-201. As a general rule,
   allocation transfers between commands are completed by the losing MASO after coordination with
   the MAJCOM.
 18                                                                           AFI11-212 8 APRIL 2009


         5.4.1.1. The losing MASO in coordination with the wing weapons officer will ensure the unit
         has sufficient allocations to support exercise requirements and pass allocations to the supporting
         unit MASO not later than 60 days (CONUS-to-CONUS) and 90 days (OCONUS-to-CONUS or
         OCONUS-to-OCONUS) before the exercise begins. Allocation transfers inside these timelines
         may jeopardize munitions support due to supply/transportation timelines associated with the
         need of requisitioning/sourcing munitions assets. Timely transfers aid munitions personnel at the
         exercise location with the planning and scheduling of munitions support. Supporting/gaining
         units have seven (7) days to notify the transferring unit of any support issues.
      5.4.2. Requests to accomplish an ATR will be submitted to the MASO by the wing weapons officer
      using the format in Attachment 3. Units must submit ATRs for approval using the 784 CBSG web
      site AMST module.
5.5. After Action Reports (AAR).            The purpose of an AAR is to document a deployed unit’s
expenditures, and to assist in returning remaining allocations back to the unit’s home station (where the
original allocation came from). It serves as reconciliation between quantity transferred in from a
deployed unit and the actual quantity expended by the deployed unit.
      5.5.1. AAR should be accomplished immediately following the event, but must be accomplished no
      later than 14 days following the event. Use the 784 CBSG web site (AMST module) to complete an
      AAR.
