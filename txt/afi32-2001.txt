periods of reduced FES capability for approval of the installation commander.
1.9. Civil Engineer Engineering (CEN) Flight Chief. The CEN Flight Chief is responsible to
the BFM to ensure all construction projects are designed with all required fire/life safety features
according to all applicable and referenced building and electrical codes.
1.10. Civil Engineer Operations (CEO) Flight Chief. The CEO Flight Chief is responsible to
the BFM for inspection, testing, maintenance and documentation associated with all fire
detection, notification, suppression, water distribution systems, including any fire pumps. CEO
is also responsible for acquiring and maintaining any reserve/backup stock(s) of fire
extinguishing agent(s) needed for installed systems.
1.11. Civil Engineer Readiness and Emergency Management (CEX) Flight Chief. The CEX
Flight Chief is the installation lead for the installation Emergency Management program and is
responsible for maintaining the Installation Emergency Management Plan and fulfilling the
requirements of DoDI 6055.17, DoD Installation Emergency Management (IEM) Program, as it
pertains to implementing the National Incident Management System through the AF Incident
Management System. Additionally, the CEX Flight Chief maintains a close relationship with the
IFC and ensures effective integration of CEX personnel during emergency operations according
to their training and equipment. This necessitates coordination of CEX roles and responsibilities
during emergency operations such as HazMat/CBRN incidents with the IFC and periodic
participation in associated training events.

                                              Chapter 2

                                            STANDARDS

2.1. Mission. The mission of FES Flights is to provide fire prevention services and minimize
negative consequences of emergency incidents. The scope of services includes releases of
hazardous materials (including chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN)) resulting
from accident, natural causes, or intentional use as a weapon of mass destruction (WMD); fires
that endanger people, property, or the environment regardless of the property involved (wildland,
equipment, buildings, aircraft, etc.); fires in nearby federal agency facilities in the event normal
FES are inhibited; persons trapped or otherwise unable to escape a dangerous situation; pre-
hospital medical emergencies (non-transport); or intervention at other emergency situations such
as natural or manmade disasters that threaten life, property or the environment. The scope of
services is divided into categories to distinguish between most commonly demanded FES
services that every FES Flight must be prepared to deliver (core services) and infrequently
demanded FES services that may be provided if resources permit (non-core services).
     2.1.1. Core Services. Core services include fire prevention and minimizing adverse
     consequences at most probable incidents (i.e. pre-hospital medical emergencies; a structure
     fire contained in the room or area of origin; an aircraft fire at one location, one side, interior
     or exterior; rescue; a HazMat release manageable with defensive operations, entrapment
     resulting from automobile or equipment accidents, and Wildland Urban Interface (WUI)
     fires). The FES Flights’ resource authorizations are based on the most demanding core
     services and the assumption that only one major emergency incident will occur at a time. In
     the event that multiple incidents occur, response priorities are pre-determined in installation
     emergency management plans.
     2.1.2. Non-Core Services. Installation commanders may approve non-core services not
     included in paragraph 2.1.1 utilizing existing resources. Specifically, wildland fire fighting,
     technical rescue, offensive HazMat operations and other emergency operations to manage
     uncommon local risks may be assigned to the flight. However, due diligence must be
     incorporated in the decision process resulting in an RM plan prepared by the IFC that
     addresses the risk to core missions. When the risk is not acceptable, commanders may
     provide unit-funded additional resources to enable the flight to accomplish the non-core
     services. The installation commander will advise the Command Civil Engineer of all
     approved non-core services not included in paragraph 2.1.1 (T-3). The Command Civil
     Engineer will determine, based on the significance of the non-core services approved
     whether other MAJCOM leaders need to be advised.
2.2. Goal. The goal of the FES Flight is to prevent or reduce injury and loss of life, and
minimize damage to property and the environment.
2.3. Objectives. The goal is achieved through two objectives:
     2.3.1. Prevent fires or minimize their consequences. This objective is achieved with an
     aggressive and effective fire prevention program consisting of project design reviews, fire
     inspections, code enforcement and fire safety education.
     2.3.2. Minimize the adverse consequences of emergency incidents. This objective is
     achieved by early intervention with sufficient resources to accomplish the stated core
AFI32-2001 27 FEBRUARY 2014                                                                     9


   services. Emergency action plans are developed to manage potential emergency incidents
   that cannot be quickly contained and controlled.
   2.3.3. At least 90% of all facilities on the installation are in fire demand zones. Response
   time standards to these facilities are specified in DoDI 6055.06. Facilities outside fire
   districts are considered remote and outlying facilities and response time standards are
   established in USAF Technical Implementation Guide (TIG) 1710.
   2.3.4. The Standards of Cover must include areas/facilities where response time standards
   specified in DODI 6055.06 is not expected to be met (T-0). Since additional risk may be
   incurred, the IFC must inform the users of these areas/facilities of the potential consequences
   (T-1).
2.4. Emergency Response Capability (ERC). ERC is the level of service that can be provided
with available personnel, equipment, vehicles and fire extinguishing agents. The ERC can be
affected by the lack of trained personnel, reduced fire fighting agent, equipment out-of-service,
and the capability to meet established response times. The ERC assumes that only one major
emergency incident will occur at a time.
   2.4.1. ERC is expressed as an Optimum Level of Service (OLS), Reduced Level of Service
   (RLS), Critical Level of Service (CLS), and Inadequate Level of Service (ILS).
       2.4.1.1. Optimum Level of Service (OLS). OLS is when all authorized resources are
       available for emergency response within response time standards. OLS provides
       sufficient capability for quick response and sustained operations after arrival on scene.
       During OLS, emergency response forces shall accomplish all objectives when responding
       to emergency incidents.
       2.4.1.2. Reduced Level of Service (RLS). RLS is when the ERC is less than OLS but
       greater than CLS. Sufficient capability is provided for initial response, scene assessment
       and implementation of mitigation tactics. This level of service represents increased
       risk/loss potential due to lack of ERC to perform rescue and sufficient mitigation tactics
       simultaneously. FES objectives may not be successful during situations where
       simultaneous rescue and fire fighting activities are required.
           2.4.1.2.1. Reduced ERC may result from unfunded or unfilled manpower
           authorizations, deployments, leaves, vehicle impairments, or other temporary
           conditions such as traffic obstructions or road construction. Because of these variable
           factors, the AF considers operating at a RLS to be a normal day-to-day situation.
           2.4.1.2.2. While in RLS, the IFC allocates resources according to local risk factors
           with the goal to provide the highest feasible level of service during higher risk
           periods, while reducing capabilities when the risk is lower. At the high end of the
           RLS range, most FES objectives can be achieved at emergency incidents. As ERC
           decreases, cross-staffing and multi-tasking of emergency responders will be necessary
           to accomplish critical emergency response tasks. As ERC further decreases, the
           probability of accomplishing required FES objectives diminishes.
       2.4.1.3. Critical Level of Service (CLS). A CLS capability exists when 7 firefighters are
       available to respond to an emergency within the response time standards. For non-
       aircraft related emergencies, at least 4 of the firefighters must respond within the
 10                                                          AFI32-2001 27 FEBRUARY 2014


       response time standard for initial response and the remaining 3 firefighters must arrive on
       scene within the response time standard for a full response (T-1). Aircraft emergencies
       must meet established response time criteria for announced and unannounced
       emergencies (T-1). Upon arrival, the Incident Commander will determine the appropriate
       actions to be taken depending upon their initial evaluation of the situation. Successful
       outcomes can only be expected when the incident can be quickly mitigated. Firefighters
       are expected to revert to defensive operations when the emergency cannot be quickly
       contained. This level of service represents limited rescue capability and increased
       risk/loss potential due to limited resources. Therefore, operating at CLS continuously for
       periods of more than 72 hours is prohibited without a written RM plan signed by the
       installation or wing commander. Exception: Fire stations serving only remote and
       outlying areas or auxiliary airfields may operate continuously at CLS when the
       installation or wing commander has approved such operations in a written RM plan.
          2.4.1.3.1. Emergency response forces can expect to accomplish FES objectives when
          the incident can be quickly contained and mitigated. Due to exhaustion and resource
          limitations, CLS is considered a “one shot” capability that cannot be sustained for
          more than approximately 15 minutes. Firefighters are expected to revert to defensive
          operations when the emergency cannot be contained quickly. The property involved
          in the fire is expected to receive severe damage.
       2.4.1.4. Inadequate Level of Service (ILS). ILS is when ERC for a CLS is unavailable.
       The property involved in the fire is expected to be destroyed.
          2.4.1.4.1. An ILS consists of 6 firefighters or less. Interior operations are considered
          unsafe unless the Incident Commander (IC) determines that responders are unlikely to
          be injured or killed.
          2.4.1.4.2. When at least 4 responders are on scene and in known rescue situations,
          interior rescue operations may be attempted. A team consisting of 2 firefighters may
          conduct interior rescue operations while the other 2 firefighters serve as a rapid
          intervention team (RIT) poised to rescue the interior firefighters. One of the RIT
          team members may have additional assignments but must be able to immediately
          cease all operations and assume RIT duties when required. All operations in interior
          IDLH areas must be with teams of at least two, in continuous contact (visual or
          physical) with each other and in direct communication with the RIT team (T-1).
          During ILS, facility entry for fire fighting purposes is only permitted for fires in the
          incipient stage. With less than 4 responders on scene, interior rescue or fire fighting
          operations may not be attempted.
2.5. Regulatory Guidance. FES operational policy consolidates a wide variety of requirements
from DoD instructions, OSHA, and NFPA standards. NFPA standards and recommended
practices affecting FES operations form the foundation for AF FES operations and are adopted as
written or as implemented with specific TIGs.
   2.5.1. Technical Implementation Guides (TIG). TIGs ensure implementation of NFPA
   standards is consistent with AF policy and guidance.
       2.5.1.1. The AF Fire Chief establishes working groups consisting of members nominated
       by the Command Fire Chiefs and other personnel when appropriate to assist in the
AFI32-2001 27 FEBRUARY 2014                                                                       11


       development of TIGs. TIGs which are consistent with an NFPA standard may be
       approved by the AF Fire Chief after coordination with MAJCOM Civil Engineers. TIGs
       containing deviations from NFPA criteria require approval by The AF Civil Engineer.
       2.5.1.2. To allow time for analysis of potential impacts, a new or revised NFPA standard
       is not implemented until one year after its publication date. When a TIG is issued, it
       remains in effect until superseded, withdrawn, or one year following a new edition of the
       NFPA standard. If a TIG is not published within one year, the NFPA standard will be
       implemented as written unless otherwise directed by the AF Fire Chief.
   2.5.2. North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Standardization Agreements
   (STANAGs). Units assigned to and that execute NATO missions implement NATO
   STANAGs as ratified by the United States. Ratification and applicability of NATO
   STANAGs are located at https://diweb.hq.nato.int/.
2.6. Standards of Cover (SOC). The IFC will establish a SOC which is defined as “written
policies and procedures that establish the distribution and concentration of fixed and mobile
resources of an organization.” The installation’s SOC must be based on the performance
requirements in DoDI 6055.06 (T-1).
2.7. Basic Allowance for Subsistence (BAS). To meet response time standards, firefighters
need to be in a ready-response position at the assigned fire station. Therefore, firefighters will be
authorized BAS (T-3) IAW the Essential Station Messing exceptions listed in Air Force Manual
65-116, Volume 1, Defense Joint Military Pay System Active Component (DJMS-AC) FSO
Procedure.
2.8. FES Policy Deviations. FES policy consolidates a wide variety of requirements from DoD
instructions, OSHA, NFPA standards, etc. Therefore, deviating from AF policy is carefully
managed to avoid additional risk to people and property and ensure compliance with higher level
requirements. The IFC, as the installation commander’s FES risk advisor, prepares an RM plan
that assesses the risk resulting in deviation from this instruction and advises commanders on the
proper course of action.
   2.8.1. Short-Term Deviations. Short-term deviations are caused by immediate unavoidable
   circumstances that reduce capability below the RLS or situations that cause a deviation from
   the requirements of DoDI 6055.06 or other FES policy for less than 90 days continuously.
   Short-term deviations are normally resolved at the IFC level. The IFC will establish RM
   plans, response plans and standard operating procedures to address variations in risk and
   capability (T-1). Reductions in levels of service are reported as instructed in paragraph 6.5.
       2.8.2. Temporary Deviations. Temporary deviations are situations that exist for more
       than 90 days but less than one year that reduce capability below RLS or situations that
       cause a deviation from the requirements of DoDI 6055.06 or other FES policy. The IFC
       prepares a RM plan that includes a get-well date within one year of the approval date.
       Temporary deviations and the RM plan must be approved by the installation commander
       and forwarded within 7 days to the Command Civil Engineer (T-3). The Command Civil
       Engineer will determine, based on the significance of the deviation whether higher levels
       of MAJCOM leadership need to be advised. Approved temporary deviations are valid for
       up to one year from the date of approval.
 12                                                          AFI32-2001 27 FEBRUARY 2014


   2.8.3. Long-Term Deviations. The Secretary of the Air Force (SECAF) has delegated Long-
   Term Deviation authority to the Air Force Civil Engineer. The approval shall contain clear
   statements that the approver has accepted the increased risk caused by the deviation and that
   the approval is for those long term deviations. Long term deviations are situations that last
   more than 1 year, but less than 3 years that reduce capability below RLS or situations that
   cause a deviation from the requirements of DoDI 6055.06 or other FES policy. If the
   approval authority changes, deviation shall be briefed to the new approval authority (T-1).
   Expiring approval may be reviewed provided all steps in the approval process are
   reaccomplished or revalidated.
   2.8.4. Reporting Deviations. Command Fire Chiefs provide a copy of all approved
   temporary and long-term deviations to AFCEC/CXF no later than 31 Oct of each year. The
   Air Force Fire Chief will provide copies of all approved temporary and long-term deviations
   to AFSEC/SEG no later than 30 Nov of each year. The AF Civil Engineer will also provide
   copies of all temporary and long-term deviations from DoDI 6055.06 to the DUSD (I&E).
2.9. Fire Protection Engineering Criteria Policy Deviation. NFPA standards for facility
design and construction are adopted when referenced in Uniform Facility Criteria (UFC) 3-600-
01, Fire Protection Engineering for Facilities and Engineering Technical Letters (ETL). Issues
out of compliance with fire protection criteria in UFCs and ETLs must have an approved
corrective action plan or an approved exemption from criteria compliance. AFI 32-10141,
Planning and Programming Fire Safety Deficiency Correction Projects provides guidance for
the evaluation of fire safety criteria deficiencies, the preparation and approval of corrective
action plans and criteria exemptions.
   2.9.1. Deviations from other AF policy, such as technical orders, must be approved by the
   appropriate authority for that publication and a courtesy copy of the approved deviation will
   be provided to AFSEC/SEG.
2.10. Master (Strategic) Planning. IFCs will develop a 3-5 year master plan that coordinates
the vision, mission, values, and goals of the FES Flight (T-3). The master plan utilizes a service-
area-wide balanced and cost-effective hazard management strategy that takes into consideration
existing conditions and anticipates overall community growth.
2.11. Contract Fire Fighting Operations. At installations where fire fighting is provided by
contract, the staffing levels will be fixed as determined by a risk assessment accomplished by the
MAJCOM Fire Chief and approved by the MAJCOM Civil Engineer IAW DoDI 6055.06
Enclosure 9.
2.12. Mutual Aid Offsets. AF resources may be offset by adequate and reliable mutual aid
capability where arrangements are made for immediate access to the installation. Mutual aid
partners are considered adequate and reliable if they are organized and equipped to satisfy the
authority having jurisdiction, are able to meet response time standards and, based on historical
experience, respond if called. Automatic aid agreements where the AF and mutual aid partners
automatically respond to each other’s jurisdiction can mutually offset resources and are
encouraged.

                                           Chapter 3

                         FES ORGANIZATION AND PROGRAMS

3.1. Flight Organization. FES flight organizational structure is broadly categorized as
Management and Administration, Fire Prevention, Training, and Operations. The FES
management staff provides administration, communication, oversight and supervision for the
flight. It consists of the Fire Chief, Deputy Fire Chief, Operations Assistant Fire Chief (one per
shift), Training Assistant Chief, Health and Safety Assistant Chief, and Fire Prevention Assistant
Chief. The administrative staff includes the fire inspectors, emergency communications center
dispatchers and an administrative assistant.
   3.1.1. Except for the administrative assistant/secretary and dispatchers, all positions are
   classified under the GS-0081 series Fire Protection and Prevention and Air Force Specialty
   Code (AFSC) 3E7X1. Dispatchers are classified under the GS-2151 series Dispatching.
   Dispatchers will be civilian except at locations where AF civilian positions are not authorized
   (T-3). When necessary, military 3E7X1 personnel may be assigned dispatcher duties on a
   rotational basis; however, IFCs will ensure the tour length is minimal and does not impact
   operational proficiency training needs.
   3.1.2. All military, civilian (GS-0081s and GS-2151s), contractors or other persons
   providing FES for the AF will meet the certification requirements of DoD 6055.06-M, DoD
   Fire & Emergency Services Certification Program (F&ESCP) and the training requirements
   of the Fire Emergency Services Training Program (T-1).
   3.1.3. To maximize personnel availability, work schedules for FES administrative personnel
   (GS-0081/AFS 3E7XX) who have the requisite certifications, training, and physical
   qualifications may include one or more 24-hour shifts during a pay period. The only
   acceptable justification for administrative personnel to work irregular (56/60 hour)
   workweeks is to support FES fire operations. During the 24-hour shift, FES administrative
   personnel are assigned fire fighting duties as a secondary duty and retain their normal
   administrative duties as their primary duties. This procedure helps to mitigate personnel
   shortages in FES operations and avoids adverse mission impact.
   3.1.4. Base Fire Marshals will ensure that all regularly-scheduled civilian overtime is fully
   justified. They also ensure that the work schedule for military firefighters does not exceed 72
   hours per week (T-3). Official duties, including official appointments, must be accomplished
   within this 72-hour workweek. Exceptions are allowed when additional duties are prescribed
   for disciplinary purposes or during severe manpower shortages where additional work hours
   are needed to meet CLS capability.
3.2. Management. The IFC establishes and maintains FES programs to ensure the protection of
AF personnel, property and the environment, while ensuring firefighter safety.
   3.2.1. The FES Assessment Program (FESAP). The FESAP is based on national consensus
   standards, OSHA regulations, Commission on Fire Accreditation International (CFAI), DoD
   and AF specific guidance and policy. The assessment provides benchmarks to promote
   efficiency, sound management practices, and to verify compliance with regulatory
   requirements. The FESAP is maintained on the AF FES CoP or the next generation
   replacement available through the AF Portal. FES managers use the FESAP as the standard
 14                                                            AFI32-2001 27 FEBRUARY 2014


   annual self-inspection program checklist. Command Inspector General (IG) teams may
   adopt the FESAP checklist as the standard inspection checklist. Command specific items do
   not apply to ANG unless the unit has been gained by that command or the items have been
   approved by NGB/A7XF FESO. Command Fire Chiefs will validate the FESAP at every AF
   FES location on a tri-annual basis.
   3.2.2. Firefighter Fitness and Wellness (FFW) Program. All AF firefighters whose positions
   require participation in emergency incident operations, to include firefighters with 56-/60-
   hour work schedules, will participate in a FFW program as a part of their normal work
   schedule (T-0). The FFW program must be consistent with USAF TIG 1500, Fire
   Department Occupational Safety and Health Program and NFPA Standard 1583, Standard
   on Health-Related Fitness Programs for Fire Department Members as established by the IFC
   (T-0). Individuals not physically capable of performing essential job functions will be
   referred to the Fire Department Physician for a fitness-for-duty evaluation in accordance with
   5 CFR, Part 339, Medical Qualification Determination (T-0). Members disqualified must be
   immediately removed from fire fighting duties (T-0).
   3.2.3. Occupational Safety and Health (OSHA) Program. The FES OSHA Program will
   comply with USAF TIG 1500 (T-0). The IFC will complete RM plans addressing non-
   compliant items and plan remediation actions (T-3). RMs will be approved by the
   installation commander and provided to the Command Fire Chief and Installation Risk
   Manager. The fire prevention office will notify the host safety office of any assigned risk
   assessment codes (RACs) 1, 2 or 3 for identified hazards (T-3).
   3.2.4. Wildland Fire Management Program (WFMP). In accordance with AFI 32-7064,
   Integrated Natural Resources Management, the IFC will determine the number and types of
   certifications required for the expected level of involvement prescribed in the WFMP (T-3).
   Other than urban interface, wildland fire fighting is not a core FES mission; FES funding for
   resources does not include wildland missions. For installations having a WFMP that includes
   FES responsibilities beyond urban interface, the IFCs will develop an RM that addresses the
   risk to core missions (T-3). When firefighters are required to conduct wildland fire fighting
   beyond the incipient stage, training will be provided to meet NFPA 1051, Wildland
   Firefighter Professional Qualifications (T-0). The IFC will determine when additional
   certifications are required; such additional certifications may include those of National
   Wildland Coordinating Group (NWCG) Wildland Fire Qualification Subsystem Guide
   (Publication Management System 310-1 and National Fire Equipment System 1414)
   qualifications.
3.3. Fire Prevention Program. The objectives of the Fire Prevention Program are to prevent
fires, facilitate early intervention at fires and ensure the safety of exposed personnel during fires.
These objectives are accomplished through four program elements: fire prevention inspection,
FES facility pre-incident plan review, code enforcement and fire safety education.
   3.3.1. Execution of the Fire Prevention Program is a top priority for the FES flight. The Fire
   Prevention Section will be properly staffed IAW DoDI 6055.06, with DoD certified fire
   inspectors IAW DoDI 6055.06M (T-1). The IFC may assign fire inspectors to firefighter
   positions as secondary duties provided the inspector has the required training, certifications,
   and physical qualifications to perform such duties.
AFI32-2001 27 FEBRUARY 2014                                                                    15


  3.3.2. The Civil Engineer Engineering (CEN) Flight is responsible for the installation Fire
  Protection Engineering (FPE) Program, including ensuring all projects are designed and
  constructed IAW UFC 3-600-01, Fire Protection Engineering for Facilities, Engineer
  Technical Letters (ETLs), NFPA standards or host nation standards depending on the Status
  of Forces Agreement.
     3.3.2.1. CEN is responsible for ensuring all O&M projects including repair,
     modification, and modernization correct identified Fire Safety Deficiencies (FSDs) in any
     area involved IAW UFC 3-600-01, sections 1-3.1 and 1-3.2.
     3.3.2.2. Fire inspectors will review plans to ensure all required features are present and
     local emergency response elements are incorporated (i.e., accessibility to facility, location
     of fire hydrants, etc.) IAW UFC 3-600-01, but they do not conduct the required FPE
     reviews of technical designs (T-0).
     3.3.2.3. The IFC will provide plans review comments to the CEN Flight Chief for
     incorporation in projects (T-3).
  3.3.3. Fire prevention inspections are conducted at least annually for all facilities. The IFC
  may institute more frequent inspections to include unannounced and after hours inspections.
  Exception: Family housing is excluded except for the common areas within multi-family
  housing units and privatized housing when directed by local agreements. Common areas
  include laundry rooms, game rooms, stairwells, hallways, elevators, storage areas, etc.
     3.3.3.1. Objectives of fire prevention inspections include identifying, documenting and
     reporting fire hazards and FSDs. Management of fire hazards and assignment of RACs is
     outlined in AFI 91-202, The US Air Force Mishap Prevention Program. Management
     and assignment of Fire Safety Deficiencies and associated codes is outlined in AFI 32-
     10141, Planning and Programming Fire Safety Deficiency Correction Projects.
     3.3.3.2. USAF TIG 1, Fire Code and AFI 91-203, Air Force Consolidated Occupational
     Safety Instruction, incorporates and defines standards for fire prevention inspection
     requirements. Due to the complexity of AF missions and facilities, other AF Instructions
     or publications may also apply.
     3.3.3.3. Craftsmen in the Civil Engineer Operations (CEO) Flight inspect, test and
     maintain installed fire protection systems (detection/suppression/water distribution/fire-

     for correcting fire hazards/deficiencies on-the-spot or submitting an AF IMT Form 332
     for the necessary work order, job order, or construction project. Immediate corrective
     actions may include lock out/tag out of defective equipment, termination of hazardous
     operations, or occupancy/use restrictions in affected facilities. The local Safety Office
     must be notified when lock out/tag out of defective equipment is used.
     3.3.4.2. The CE work request review board is responsible for scheduling work orders/job
     orders IAW the assigned RAC/FSD codes. The IFC is responsible for tracking
     CAPs/mitigating actions until the hazard/deficiency is corrected or waived. While
     hazards and FSDs remain uncorrected, the IFC notifies the next higher commander
     progressively up to the installation commander.
  3.3.5. Fire safety education is an essential part of workplace safety training, and is promoted
  during fire inspections and other personal contacts. It may be tailored for specific audiences
  and purposes, such as fire extinguisher training or public assembly employee training. Fire
  safety education objectives are to equip personnel with the information needed to prevent
  fires, protect themselves and intervene early when fire occurs. IFCs ensure educational
  processes are in place to inform and motivate installation personnel on fire prevention
  responsibilities.
     3.3.5.1. Fire Prevention Week (normally the week of October 9th) is a nationally
     established period to provide fire safety education to employees, their families and the
     public.
  3.3.6. Use AF Form 218, Facility Fire Prevention and Protection Record, or automated
  product as a checklist and to record results of facility inspections. Facility inspection records
  will be entered into ACES-FD with the exception of facility portable fire extinguisher
  information (T-3). Facility portable fire extinguisher accountability will only be maintained
  on the AF Form 218 (T-3). Facility managers/supervisors shall inspect, document and
  maintain the location of all their facility fire extinguishers IAW AFI 91-203, paragraph
  6.2.4.7 (T-2). The FES flight shall provide facility managers information on facility fire
  extinguisher requirements outlined in applicable NFPA standards (T-0).
  3.3.7. Use AF Form 1487, Fire Prevention Visit Report, or automated product, to document
  fire hazards and FSDs, and identify the condition of the fire prevention program to
  commanders. Fire prevention visit reports will be entered into ACES-FD (T-3).
  3.3.8. Installed Fire Protection Systems. IFCs must monitor the status of systems and devices
  provided to facilitate fire safety for personnel and property (T-1). All foam systems will be
  tested IAW NFPA 412, Standard for Evaluating Aircraft Rescue and Fire-Fighting Foam
  Equipment (T-0). The CEO Flight is responsible to maintain these systems. This includes
  the procurement of agents required for re-servicing fire suppression systems.
     3.3.8.1. The CEO Flight Chief ensures the inspection, testing, repair, and maintenance of
     fire protection systems and water distribution systems are conducted in accordance with
     UFC 3-601-02, Operations and Maintenance: Inspection, Testing, and Maintenance of
     Fire Protection Systems; and UFC 3-230-02, Operation and Maintenance: Water Supply
     Systems. Fire protection system impairments and systems out of service reporting and
     corrective actions will comply with AFI 32-10141 and the UFC 3-601-02 (T-1).
AFI32-2001 27 FEBRUARY 2014                                                                   17


       3.3.8.2. CEO personnel or contractor equivalent must record all water distribution flow
       tests on the computer generated AF Form 1027, Water Flow Test Record, or automated
       product. The AF Form 1027 is located on the AF FES CoP or the next generation
       replacement and provides copies to the IFC annually.
3.4. FES Training. The IFC establishes a program that ensures certification and proficiency
training requirements for all military AFSC 3E7X1, civilian GS-0081 and GS-2151 (serving as
FES Dispatchers). Trainers will record all FES proficiency and certification training on the AF
Form 1085 Fire Protection Training Report and in ACES-FD (T-3).
   3.4.1. FES personnel will meet the minimum training requirements in the FES Training Plan
   (FESTP) as outlined in the FESAP maintained on the AF FES CoP or the next generation
   replacement (T-1). Firefighters at non-AF led joint bases will comply with the host agency’s
   proficiency training program (T-1). Additionally, chief officers are highly encouraged to
   attend at least one professional enhancement seminar per calendar year such as those offered
   by the International Association of Fire Chiefs or other professional organizations, see
   paragraph 3.4.5.
   3.4.2. Where foreign national/host nation firefighters are employed, IFCs with MAJCOM
   coordination and approval have the authority to approve equivalent certification and training
   requirements according to specific job assignments and agreements with the host nation.
   3.4.3. Training to achieve FES certifications is a personal responsibility. Supervisors
   facilitate certification by providing guidance, access to training materials, instruction, and
   performance testing required for certification. Training to achieve FESCS certification is
   available to each AF employee at no cost to the unit or individual. Acquiring training for
   FES certifications from non-AF/DoD sources requires prior approval by the Command Fire
   Chief.
   3.4.4. Certification in the F&ESCP will be granted only for skills required for the current
   duty position, the next-higher position to which an individual may be assigned or as required
   by deployment duty position. Command Fire Chiefs may approve waivers based on unique
   mission needs. All MAJCOM approved waivers will be included in the individual
   certification package when submitted to AFCEC/CXF for consideration.
   3.4.5. Recognizing the importance of continued professional development through
   education, training and professional affiliations, FES personnel are highly encouraged to seek
   advanced education opportunities from accredited academic organizations and colleges.
   Additionally, Chief Fire Officer, Chief Medical Officer, or Fire Officer professional
   credentials through the Center for Public Safety Excellence (CPSE) are highly encouraged
   for fire chiefs, deputies, and assistant chiefs.
   3.4.6. AFCEC/CXF is responsible for approving and investigating effective and cost-
   efficient methods to provide training. AFCEC/COS (Engineering Support Division)
   maintains environmentally acceptable design plans and drawings for aircraft live-fire training
   facilities and is responsible for commissioning and design modifications. Aircraft live-fire
   training facilities will be maintained and operated in accordance with Technical Order (TO)
   35E1-2-13-1, Operation and Maintenance Instruction Manual Aircraft Fire Training Facility
   (T-1). This TO is managed by AFCEC/CXF. Any modifications to aircraft live fire trainers
   must be coordinated by the MAJCOM and approved by AFCEC. Mobile fire trainers will be
 18                                                          AFI32-2001 27 FEBRUARY 2014


   operated and maintained in accordance with manufacturer specifications and instructions (T-
   0). Structural fire training facility designs and commercially procured products must satisfy
   the performance test elements of Firefighter II, as specified in NFPA Std. 1001, Standard for
   Firefighter Professional Qualifications. Structural fire training facilities will meet NFPA
   Std. 1403, Standard on Live Fire Training Evolutions (T-0). All live-fire structural training
   will be conducted in accordance with NFPA Std. 1500 and NFPA Std. 1403 (T-0).
       3.4.6.1. All propane based AF operated fire training systems/devices used for firefighter
       training will be approved for operation by AFCEC/CO (Operations Directorate) before
       being used to train DoD military or civilian firefighters (T-2). All propane training
       devices will comply with NFPA 58, as appropriate, and will provide a single action
       emergency shutdown capability with flame extinguishment for exterior fires of not more
       than 10 seconds and interior fires of not more than 5 seconds (T-0).
       3.4.6.2. Flammable gas fire training devices must use gasses that meet current NFPA
       standards (T-0).
       3.4.6.3. Flammable liquid training devices will use flammable liquids that meet military
       standards for JP-8 (Jet-A, Jet-A1) (T-0). JP-5 or DF-2 are permitted for use in fire
       training application. JP-8 or JP-5 removed from aircraft for excessive moisture content
       will be acceptable for training applications and may be mixed with the same fuel type
       meeting present-day military standards. Different fuel types will not be mixed nor will
       multiple fuel types be used in a training event. Contaminated flammable liquids or those
       suspected of being contaminated will not be used for live fire training.
       3.4.6.4. The IFC at each installation with a flying and/or structural mission will program
       for a permanent live fire aircraft/structural training facility (T-1). These trainers must
       comply with AFCEC/COA acceptable design plans and drawings, and must be
       maintained as outlined in 3.4.5. above, NFPA and manufacturer’s guidelines.
   3.4.7. To maintain proficiency in various structural scenarios, live fire training will be
   conducted IAW NFPA 1403 (T-0).
       3.4.7.1. Fire training devices for Class A combustibles will use acceptable class “A”
       materials which are pine excelsior, wooden pallets, straw, hay, and other ordinary
       combustibles. Pressure treated wood, rubber, plastic, and straw or hay treated with
       pesticides or harmful chemicals will not be used. Use of Class A combustibles will be
       limited IAW NFPA 1403 to preclude flashover conditions which could endanger
       firefighters undergoing training evolutions.
3.5. FES Operations. The goal of the FES operations section is to minimize adverse
consequences of emergency incidents by intervening early with appropriate available resources
and in accordanc with response time standards indicated in DoDI 6055.06. Available resources
dictate the level of service provided. Emergency operations are conducted using the assumption
that only one major incident will occur at the same time. Should more than one major incident
occur at the same time, the IC uses base disaster plans to determine the priority for response. In
most cases, response to multiple emergencies can occur at the same time. However, when an
actual major emergency incident occurs, all FES resources may be required to manage the
incident and response to other emergencies are not expected.
AFI32-2001 27 FEBRUARY 2014                                                                      19


  3.5.1. Incident Management. Emergency incidents are managed according to AFI 10-2501,
  Air Force Emergency Management (EM) Program Planning and Operations. The Incident
  Command System (ICS) is a component of the AF Incident Management System (AFIMS).
  ICS is a standardized incident management structure used during all emergencies, large or
  small to include training evolutions.
     3.5.1.1. The Incident Commander (IC) is the individual responsible for all incident
     activities, including responder safety, development of an Incident Action Plan, and
     utilization of all emergency resources. The IC has overall authority and responsibility for
     conducting incident operations and is responsible for the management of all incident
     operations at the incident site. An IC is required for all incidents. The senior fire official
     is ordinarily the IC for all incidents requiring response by more than one
     agency/organization.
     3.5.1.2. All FES personnel that respond to FES emergencies will receive progressive IC
     training as indicated in the FESTP (T-1).
     3.5.1.3. Incident Safety Officer (ISO). ISO responsibilities will be accomplished at all
     incidents and during training evolutions (T-1). When responding off base, the IFC will
     appoint an ISO to observe AF operations (T-1). If unsafe conditions are observed or
     encountered by AF firefighters, the ISO will mitigate the condition and inform the IC.
  3.5.2. Aircraft Rescue and Fire Fighting (ARFF). ARFF capabilities are based on the
  quantity of fire fighting agent, agent discharge rates, the number of fire fighting vehicles,
  availability of firefighters, and response times to perform initial fire ground operations for the
  largest assigned or transient (where approved by variance) aircraft.
     3.5.2.1. It is a core mission to rescue aircrew members from aircraft involved in
     accident/fire incidents. At locations with a flying mission, all firefighters must be trained
     in aircrew rescue and extraction techniques on assigned and transient aircraft, IAW TO
     00-105E-9, Aerospace Emergency Rescue and Mishap Response Information (Emergency
     Services) (T-1).
     3.5.2.2. Where the FES Flight is the primary provider of ARFF services to civil airports,
     the certified civil operator must comply with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) 14
     CFR Part 139 requirements. DoD policy and federal statute do not permit the FAA to
     inspect DoD controlled airfields or military service ARFF facilities, equipment, and
     records at airports where DoD provides ARFF services for Part 139 certified airport
     operators. To help ensure civil operators have the information they need to show the
     FAA they meet Part 139 standards, the IFC will provide a DoD ARFF Capability Report
     to the airport operator to demonstrate that the AF ARFF services meet DoD and
     applicable National Fire Protection Association standards (T-0). This report will be
     provided in January of each year and prior to any FAA inspection when requested by the
     civil airport operator. The template for this report is located on the AF FES CoP or next
     generation replacement. If the FAA inspector identifies deficiencies in the report, the
     civil airport operator may request additional information and the IFC will respond within
     8 business hours. No direct contact between the DoD ARFF provider and FAA personnel
     is permitted. Additionally, the IFC will review the airport’s Emergency Operations Plan
     annually and participate in the triennial exercise referenced in the plan (T-1).
20                                                         AFI32-2001 27 FEBRUARY 2014


  3.5.3. Structural Fire Fighting. Structural fire fighting capability is based on attack and
  extinguishment of fires in the room or area of fire origin and providing for the safety of
  personnel exposed to such fires.
  3.5.4. HazMat and Terrorist Use of CBRN. The IFC will maintain a defensive capability to
  respond to peacetime HazMat and CBRN incidents (T-1). However, offensive operational
  plans must be developed. The flight’s core capabilities during these incidents includes:
  command, control, communications, accountability, fire suppression, rescue and extrication,
  emergency decontamination and preserving evidence performed by HazMat Operations and
  Technician certified responders.
     3.5.4.1. Limited atmospheric monitoring, detection, mass personnel decontamination and
     operations in the IDLH locations will only be performed when qualified personnel and
     adequate resources are available to effectively mitigate the incident.
     3.5.4.2. Neutralization, recovery, cleanup, and disposition of hazardous waste (to include
     bio-hazards, blood, body fluids, etc.) are accomplished by trained experts in related fields
     and are not a function of FES personnel. Follow requirements established by 29 CFR
     Part 1910.120, Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response; DoDI 3020.52,
     Department of Defense Installation Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and
     High-Yield Explosive (CBRNE) Preparedness Standards; NFPA Std. 472, Standard for
     Competence of Responders to Hazardous Materials/Weapons of Mass Destruction
     Incidents and AFMAN 91-201, Explosive Safety Standard.
     3.5.4.3. When FES Flight staffing is insufficient to accomplish offensive HazMat
     operations, the IFC will institute a plan for incorporating an integration of HazMat
     resources, supplementing FES manpower with other on-base personnel who have been
     adequately credentialed and equipped (e.g., Bioenvironmental, Readiness/EM personnel,
     Safety, etc.) (T-1). The plan will identify properly credentialed and trained personnel
     outside FES to provide hazard identification, air monitoring/detection, sampling,
     decontamination and medical support to assist FES personnel.
     3.5.4.4. The Hazardous Materials Equipment Plan (HMEP) standardizes the HazMat
     equipment in FES Flights across the AF based on the size of the installation. The HMEP
     sets precedence by establishing both the minimum and maximum quantities of equipment
     authorized. The HMEP ensures asset management, accountability, inspection and
     inventory controls. FES Flights are not resourced to manage catastrophic incidents.
     Rather, resources are provided for capability to manage most probable incidents and
     plans are developed locally for a collaborative (other organic responders, mutual aid, etc.)
     response to manage catastrophic incidents. The HMEP can be found at the AF FES CoP
     or next generation replacement. Local quantities may be adjusted based on unique
     missions when approved by the Command Fire Chief. Addition of equipment to the
     HMEP must be approved by the AF Fire Chief.
  3.5.5. Technical Rescue. The IFC will maintain a capability to perform rescue related to FES
  core missions (T-1). This capability may be integrated with other functions through cross-
  staffing or provided as a stand-alone capability.
     3.5.5.1. The IFC determines the requirements for advanced rescue technician training
     and certification based on mission needs of the installation. Based upon installation-
AFI32-2001 27 FEBRUARY 2014                                                                  21


     specific requirements, some FES personnel may require training in special operations
     such as confined space, high/low angle rope rescue, urban search and rescue, vehicle
     extrication and water rescue.
  3.5.6. Emergency Medical Services (EMS). The EMS program entails responding to
  emergency medical incidents for early intervention with appropriate patient care. The EMS
  program remains the responsibility of the installation senior medical officer.          At
  installations/locations without organic medical capability/assets, the EMS program is
  managed by the MAJCOM/FOA/DRU Medical Authority.
     3.5.6.1. The FES flight’s primary role in the EMS program is to respond to medical
     emergencies and provide patient care at the Emergency Medical Responder (EMR) level.
     All FES Operations Section personnel are required to be certified to the Department of
     Transportation (DOT) EMR level. FES’s role is limited to supporting the Medical Group
     by providing Basic Life Support (BLS) with Non-Transport (NT) (i.e., no responsibility
     for patient transport) except when performed IAW paragraph 3.5.6.3.
     3.5.6.2. The installation senior medical officer will provide the FES Flight with: AF-
     approved EMS protocols; EMS program management oversight to include all initial and
     recurring training and certification for the agreed upon EMR or Emergency Medical
     Technician (EMT) level of care; and expendable supplies and durable equipment as
     specifically identified in the supply lists approved by AF/SG3 and AF/A7C (T-1). The
     approved list will be posted on the AF/SG knowledge exchange and the items provided
     will be determined based on the level of care provided at each installation. Guidance for
     issuing supplies and equipment will be accomplished IAW AFI 41-209, paragraph 3.23,
     Medical Logistics Support. DHP funds will not be used to purchase supplies and
     equipment items that are normally contained on FES response vehicles (i.e. backboards,
     extrication equipment, etc.).
     3.5.6.3. Any FES role in EMS above the EMR level must be clearly articulated in a
     Memorandum of Understanding/Agreement (MOU/A) per DoD Instruction 4000.19,
     Support Agreements and AFI 25-201, Support Agreement Procedures (T-0). The
     MOU/A must be coordinated through the Air Force Medical Service EMS Work Group
     and approved by the MAJCOM/A7 and Surgeon General (SG), before the FES Flight can
     assume any role beyond BLS/NT.
         3.5.6.3.1. The MOU/A must address medical dispatch, resource requirements,
         training/certification requirements, medical logistics, funding, medical authority,
         protocols, program oversight, command and control, insurance and billing
         procedures, and personal and organizational liability. The MOU/A must also address
         the cleanup and disposal of all biohazards (T-1).
         3.5.6.3.2. At approved locations where firefighters provide the EMT level of care.
         The number of individuals who need to be certified will be determined by multiplying
         3 individuals per fire station by the manpower factor of 2.64 (i.e. funded EMTs equal
         (3 firefighters)(3 fire stations)(2.64) for a total of 24).
         3.5.6.3.3. If FES personnel have already obtained a national or state level EMT
         certification; they may maintain their EMT certification; but they can only practice at
 22                                                         AFI32-2001 27 FEBRUARY 2014


           the EMR level at those locations without an approved MOU/A for higher levels of
           care.
       3.5.6.4. Unless the medical group provides additional resources, FES EMS capabilities
       are predicated upon response times from existing or future fire station locations without
       regard for any EMS-based timelines. Availability of FES assistance is contingent upon
       the on-duty FES staff not being otherwise engaged in an emergency at the time of the
       EMS emergency.
           3.5.6.4.1. When first to arrive, FES personnel will perform necessary BLS/NT
           activities until the primary EMS provider arrives on-scene and assumes patient care.
           FES personnel, while performing duties as an employee of the USAF, who hold
           Advanced EMT or Paramedic certifications, will transfer care to the arriving
           ambulance crew staffed with EMT or higher qualifications.
           3.5.6.4.2. FES responders will annotate EMS response actions on the AF Form 552,
           Air Force Patient Care Report (T-3). The original copy of the completed AF Form
           552 must be turned into the local military MTF no later than the next duty day.
       3.5.6.5. Any EMS contract or other written agreements with the local community are the
       responsibility of the installation senior medical officer and is not included in the fire
       department’s mutual aid agreement. The FES Flight will have no role in providing
       contract oversight, administration, QAE, etc.
   3.5.7. Tenant Ambulance Crews. (contractor and/or Medical Group). Due to response time
   requirements from fire stations, the fire station may host an ambulance crew staging area.
   FES Flights hosting a non-fire managed ambulance service will develop a MOU/A with the
   Medical Group per DoD Instruction 4000.19, and AFI 25-201, and outline specific
   operational and safety requirements for tenant compliance (T-1). As a minimum, biohazard
   waste disposition, infectious disease control measures, and exposure protection practices will
   be addressed. Compliance with USAF TIG 1500 and NFPA 1581, Standard on Fire
   Department Infection Control Program is mandatory.
   3.5.8. Radio Access. The IFC, with approval of the installation commander, will determine
   the agencies authorized transceiver access to fire and crash radio networks (T-3). A
   minimum of two radio frequencies are required for use by the fire department to provide
   effective command and control. At larger bases with multiple fire districts, one frequency for
   each district is desirable. One frequency will be limited to fire department access only for
   tactical fire ground operations. Additional frequencies may be required to support mutual
   assistance operations and training. FES ground-to-aircraft communication is required at all
   locations with aircraft operations.
   3.5.9. Hazardous Standbys. FES will support aircraft hazardous standbys outlined in TO 00-
   25-172, Ground Servicing of Aircraft and Static Grounding/Bonding and other applicable
   aircraft technical orders as deemed necessary by the IFC (T-1).
3.6. Privatized Housing Response Management. FES will provide fire protection to
privatized housing developments located within the Installation boundaries under proprietary or
exclusive federal jurisdiction IAW applicable jurisdictions and project transactions documents
(T-0). Under concurrent jurisdiction the AF or local municipal FES response will be determined
upon established/applicable support agreements and as outlined in project transaction documents.
AFI32-2001 27 FEBRUARY 2014                                                                  23


As required, the BCE provides annual response data in accordance with reimbursement
methodology with supporting documentation and source references to the CE Resource Advisor
to compute annual updates for reimbursable costs for fire protection services IAW AFI 32-6007,
Privatized Housing Management.
3.7. Emergency Responder Rehabilitation. Physical demands associated with emergency
operations and exercises, coupled with environmental conditions could impact the safety and
health of the individual responder. Rehabilitation is an essential element of any major incident
and large-scale exercises.
   3.7.1. Rehabilitation services during real-world emergencies may be provided to DoD and
   non-DoD emergency responders IAW Title 42 United States Code Section 1856(b)-(c),
   1856a and 1856d. Specifically 42 USC § 1856 (a) provides that federal agencies can enter
   reciprocal agreements with any “fire organization…for mutual aid furnishing fire protection
   for the agency property.” The statute defines fire protection at 42 USC § 1856 (b) to include
   “personal services and equipment services, including basic medical support…” Therefore,
   through established mutual aid agreements with local, state, and federal fire organizations
   installation commanders can provide meals and beverage as “personal services” with
   appropriated funds.
   3.7.2. Rehabilitation services during exercises may be provided at Government expense
   when the provision of that food is necessary to achieve the training program’s objectives.
   Title 5 United States Code Section 4109, identifies three conditions that must apply: 1) The
   meal or refreshments must be essential to the training program 2) attendance at the meal or
   refreshment break must be necessary for full participation in the program and 3) the
   employee cannot be free to take the meal/refreshment break elsewhere.
       3.7.2.1. When planning exercises, sufficient pauses in the exercise to eliminate the need
       for nutritional supplement rehabilitation shall be provided (T-3). The IC is responsible
       for ensuring emergency responder rehabilitation is appropriately executed and proper
       exercise planning may alleviate the need for extended rehabilitation operations.
       3.7.2.2. First and foremost, emergency responder rehabilitation is about taking care of
       our emergency responders during strenuous operations and making exercises as realistic
       as possible, which may necessitate providing food and beverages during the training.
3.8. Air Reserve Command (AFRC) Military Firefighters. AFRC firefighters in Unit
Training Assembly (UTA) or Inactive Duty for Training (IDT) status are in a training status and
will not augment host FES Flight manning IAW AFI 36-2254, Volume 2. AFRC firefighters
performing annual tours or man-days are in an operational mode and will comply with this
instruction.

                                           Chapter 4

                                         RESOURCES

4.1. Emergency Response Resources. Primary FES resources are fire vehicles, manpower and
equipment. These resources are provided to manage emergency incidents associated with FES
core missions explained in paragraph 2.1.1. Non-core missions may be required locally that use
resources assigned for core missions. These non-core missions must be identified in the flight’s
organizational statement and Standards of Cover. The missions provided to the installation must
be briefed to the installation commander annually (T-3).
   4.1.1. Manpower. Manpower authorizations are based on core missions. Manpower
   authorizations are predicated on managing one major FES incident at a time. Manpower is
   provided to accomplish tasks necessary to manage emergency operations, such as operating
   hose lines, operating vehicles and pumps, ventilating facilities, search and rescue, life-saving
   emergency care, and command and control. IFCs allocate available resources to manage
   FES incidents based on local risk factors.
       4.1.1.1. Manpower authorizations on the Unit Manning Document (UMD) reflect
       workload requirements for full mission accomplishment. Funding of manpower
       authorizations on the UMD is decided by senior leadership at HQ USAF and MAJCOM
       levels with consideration of available funds, mission-importance, and acceptable levels of
       risk.
       4.1.1.2. IFCs allocate available resources to manage FES incidents based on local risk
       factors. Incident Commanders on scene ensure tasks assigned to firefighters can be
       performed safely with available resources.
   4.1.2. Vehicles. Fire Vehicles are authorized in Allowance Source Code (ASC) 010, Vehicle
   Fleet (Registered) All MAJCOM. The type and size of vehicle is calculated based on
   providing fire fighting agents for aircraft and structure fires, specialized equipment, and
   incident command. Use the AF Form 1800, Operator’s Inspection Guide and Trouble
   Report to accurately record daily operator daily vehicle inspections.
       4.1.2.1. Six fire fighting Vehicle Core Sets are established in USAF Fire and Emergency
       Services Vehicle Validation and Realignment Plan (VVRP). ARFF vehicles carry the
       quantity of agent needed to extinguish a large fire involving the largest aircraft expected.
   4.1.3. Force Activity Designator (FAD) codes for fire fighting vehicles, equipment, and
   supplies will be equal to the flying mission or highest mission being supported as prescribed
   in AFMAN 23-110, USAF Supply Manual (T-1).
   4.1.4. Service Testing and Annual Inspections. All fire vehicle pump systems will be tested
   IAW manufacturer specifications and applicable NFPA standards (T-0). All worksheets and
   forms used in the testing process will be maintained IAW Air Force Records Information
   Management System (AFRIMS) guidelines (T-3). Record inspection/test results on the AF
   Form 1078 Fire Truck and Equipment Test and Inspection Record or electronically or
   ACES-FD when available.
   4.1.5. Equipment. IFCs will maintain sufficient stock levels of fire fighting support
   equipment (T-1). ASC 490, Civil Engineering Fire Emergency Support and Aircraft Rescue
AFI32-2001 27 FEBRUARY 2014                                                                      25


   Fire Fighting Equipment, ASC 16, Special Purpose Clothing and Personal Equipment and
   ASC 429, Civil Engineering Red Horse, Prime BEEF, Prime Ribs Teams provide the
   primary basis of issue. IFCs determine the reserve levels of specialized equipment.
       4.1.5.1. All ancillary fire ground and training equipment (ladder, self contained breathing
       apparatus (SCBA), hose, rope, powered equipment, etc.) will be maintained IAW the
       applicable NFPA standards, technical data and manufacturer’s instructions (T-0).
       Inspection, maintenance and testing records will be maintained in ACES-FD (T-3). Use
       AF Form 1071, Inspection Maintenance Record to document reoccurring specialized
       equipement inspections. Maintain records IAW AFRIMS guidelines.
   4.1.6. Fire Extinguishing Agent. ARFF vehicles carry sufficient agent for one refill,
   therefore reserve/backup stock(s) of fire extinguishing agent(s) is limited to one complete
   refill of assigned fire fighting vehicles (T-1). IFCs will ensure agent conservation tactics are
   included in all training and exercises and will rigidly enforce such tactics during fire fighting
   operations.
   4.1.7. Where water tanker or tenders are used for any movement, a certified fire officer will
   be in the cab (T-2).
   4.1.8. Responder Safety. During emergency operations, the IC will give full consideration to
   the risks presented to all members on the fire ground and especially to members entering any
   IDLH environments. Operations that cannot be performed safely in accordance with OSHA
   regulations and applicable NFPA Standards will not be attempted.
4.2. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). All military firefighters are issued PPE as
outlined in Attachment 6, Figure A.8.1., at the first duty location as professional gear. When
individuals receive Permanent Change of Station (PCS) orders, these orders will include a
statement directing all PPE to be hand carried to the next duty station and authorizing excess
baggage. Upon PCS, the losing IFC will provide an AF Form 538, Personal Clothing and
Equipment Record, annotating the PPE issued.
   4.2.1. Personnel being discharged from active duty service and selected for transition to
   ANG or AFRC will transfer with PPE. For civilian firefighters, the losing IFC determines
   the disposition of PPE. If the employee is allowed to take the PPE, the gaining IFC will be
   notified. Military firefighters not assigned to FES Flights (instructor, staff, etc.) will be
   issued PPE at their next duty assignment. The losing IFC will ensure all PPE is inspected
   IAW NFPA Std. 1851, Standard on Selection, Care, and Maintenance of Protective
   Ensembles for Structural Fire Fighting and Proximity Fire Fighting, manufacturer’s
   guidance and the gear is safe to use.
4.3. Duty Uniforms. FES personnel issued PPE must wear station work uniforms while
assigned to an apparatus, conforming to the requirements in NFPA 1975, Standard on
Station/Work Uniforms for Emergency Services (T-0). These uniforms are provided to military
firefighters by the unit. For civilians, station work uniforms are bought by the employee or
provided by the employer as determined locally. NOTE: Additional civilian uniform
information is provided in AFI 32-2006, Uniform and Grooming Standards for Civilian Fire
Emergency Services Personnel.
   4.3.1. Fire Protection Badge. AFI 36-2903, Dress and Personal Appearance of Air Force
   Personnel, prescribes wear of the fire protection duty badge for military personnel.
26                                                         AFI32-2001 27 FEBRUARY 2014


     4.3.2. Military personnel working within the FES Flight are authorized to wear the duty
     badge appropriate to their normally assigned duty position within the flight. There are
     four fire emergency services duty badges:
        4.3.2.1. Station Chief and below (firefighter) - one trumpet/scramble.
        4.3.2.2. Assistant/District Chief - gold shield with three trumpets.
        4.3.2.3. Deputy Fire Chief - gold shield with four trumpets.
        4.3.2.4. Fire Chief - gold shield with five trumpets.
     4.3.3. Military FES personnel not assigned to FES Flights are authorized to wear the fire
     protection duty badge as prescribed below.
        4.3.3.1. Base Fire Marshals may wear the Fire Chief duty badge after completing the
        Fire Marshal course (X30ZR32E4 0F1A) and may continue to wear it in all
        subsequent duty positions that include FES management and oversight
        responsibilities.
        4.3.3.2. The commander, Louis F. Garland DoD Fire Academy is authorized to wear
        the Fire Chief duty badge. Course supervisors are authorized to wear the Assistant
        Chief duty badge. Fire instructors at all FES training sites and 3E7X1 personnel
        performing recruiter duty will wear the firefighter duty badge.
        4.3.3.3. AFCEC/CXF, Command FES, and 3E7XX MAJCOM Inspector General
        staff members MSgt and below, if properly certified, are authorized to wear the
        Assistant Chief duty badge. All SMSgts, if properly certified, are authorized to wear
        the Deputy Chief duty badge.
        4.3.3.4. The AF Fire Chief, Command Fire Chief’s and all CMSgts, AFSC 3E700,
        are authorized to wear the Fire Chief duty badge.
        4.3.3.5. In honor of fallen firefighters, FES personnel may wear a black band on the
        Fire Protection Badge.
            4.3.3.5.1. To honor fallen firefighters that die while actively engaged in fire
            protection duties on or off duty, all FES personnel may wear the black band until
            interment.
            4.3.3.5.2. To honor firefighters that die on or off duty but not engaged in fire
            protection duties, only personnel assigned to that duty station may wear the black
            band until interment.
AFI32-2001 27 FEBRUARY 2014                                                                    27


                                           Chapter 5

                         EXTERNAL AGENCY COORDINATION

5.1. External Agency Coordination. The installation commander may establish a Mutual Aid
Agreement (MAA) with civilian communities or other government agencies to offset internal
shortfalls in FES staffing, vehicles, or equipment if the MAA does not violate the prohibitions of
10 USC 2465, Prohibition on Contracts for the Performance of Fire Fighting or Security-Guard
Functions.
   5.1.1. Air Force Reserve Command Prime BEEF FES Units. The AFRC Prime BEEF Unit
   Fire Chief will establish a support agreement with the Host Fire Chief to facilitate the use of
   resources and maximize training opportunities. Support agreements will include a plan to
   address emergency response during AFRC Prime BEEF training evolutions to ensure host
   unit’s response capability is not significantly degraded.
5.2. Mutual Aid Agreements. The IFC manages mutual aid agreements in accordance with
Attachment 3 (US) and Attachment 4 (Foreign) of this instruction. The format and substantive
provisions for these agreements may be modified or supplemented by MAJCOM FES Staff,
subject to a legal review by the installation Staff Judge Advocate, and approval by the
installation commander. Air Force (AF) FES organizations may be part of automatic response
agreements with local community fire services organizations when approved by the installation
commander. Emergency responses to local communities must be approved by the installation
commander and will be in accordance with AFI 10-801 (T-3). Coordinate requests for
reimbursement of emergency services support provided during responses with the installation
financial management staff in accordance with DoD Directive 3025.18, Defense Support of Civil
Authorities, and AFI 65-601, Volume 1, Budget Guidance and Procedures.
   5.2.1. IFCs are encouraged to seek mutual aid agreements with surrounding communities to
   increase capabilities at large FES incidents. Honor requests for assistance under such
   agreements except when an actual FES incident is in progress on the installation or when
   supporting the request would reduce AF capability below the CLS. IFCs will exercise
   mutual aid agreements annually (T-3).
   5.2.2. CLS as defined in paragraph 2.4.1.3 is an acceptable level of service when honoring
   requests for assistance from mutual aid partners.
5.3. Defense Support of Civilian Authorities. Procedures for response to requests for
assistance from civil authorities are prescribed in DoD Directive 3025.18 and AFI 10-801.
DSCA responses include mutual aid responses and are reported to the Command Post. Costs
associated with DSCA responses, other than support to mutual aid partners, may be
reimbursable. Record expenses incurred for all DSCA responses in ACES-FD. Consult the local
comptroller to develop procedures to seek reimbursement for FES support.
5.4. National Response Framework and National Incident Management System. Homeland
Security Presidential Directive 5 (HSPD-5) implements the National Incident Management
System (NIMS). HSPD-5 is implemented in the AF through AFIMS. The IFC must coordinate
with local emergency response agencies to familiarize each other with the IMS used and develop
procedures to integrate the IMS systems (T-3).
 28                                                          AFI32-2001 27 FEBRUARY 2014


5.5. Off/On-Base Familiarization. FES personnel will become familiar, at least annually, with
areas surrounding the base where they may provide mutual aid or assistance and likewise for
responding personnel that may be required to respond on the installation from the local
community. (T-3). Annual joint training exercises are recommended. IFCs will maintain copies
of civilian community fire department emergency response plans for high hazard areas when
those communities maintain such plans and where permitted by host nation/local laws (T-3).
5.6. Fire Incident Investigations. Fire investigations are performed in accordance with AFI
91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports and AFMAN 91-224, Ground Safety Investigation and
Reports. For Class C incidents, the IFC determines the most probable cause. For Class A & B
incidents, the Safety Investigation Board President and/or Single Investigating Officer (SIO) will
request the support of subject matter experts through the MAJCOM FES staff when conducting
fire investigations. Any time FES tactics or competency is an issue; the convening authority will
request investigative support from the MAJCOM FES Staff.
5.7. FES Response Reporting. The IFC reports FES responses as prescribed in Attachment 2.
5.8. Pre-Incident Plans. The IFC will develop pre-incident plans for facilities having a
significant fire or loss-of-life potential; hazardous operations; all assigned aircraft; and any
transient aircraft the IFC deems necessary (T-1). Facility pre-incident plans are recorded on AF
Form 1028, Facility Pre-Fire Plan, or computer generated equivalent form. Facility pre-incident
plans are required to be reviewed, validated and/or updated annually or whenever the floor plan
of a facility is altered. Aircraft pre-incident plans are recorded on AFTO Form 88, Aircraft Pre-
Fire Plan, or computer generated equivalent form. Aircraft pre-incident plans are required to be
reviewed, validated and/or updated annually or anytime there is a change to Technical Order
(T.O.) 00-105E-9, Aerospace Emergency Rescue and Mishap Response Information (Emergency
Services) for the applicable assigned or transient aircraft (T-1). AFCEC/CXF is responsible for
the development, maintenance, and web management of T.O. 00-105E-9. This T.O. is managed
by the AFCEC/CXF Technical Content Manager and provides aircraft emergency rescue, fire
fighting, and hazardous materials information and procedures.
5.9. Joint-Use Airport Agreements. If the AF provides fire fighting services at joint-use civil
airports, include a release and indemnification clause in accordance with Attachment 5 (T-0).
5.10. Prior Notification of Exercises. The IFC or senior fire official (SFO) on duty must
receive at least a 30-minute prior notification when exercises involve fire fighting vehicles,
equipment, or personnel.
AFI32-2001 27 FEBRUARY 2014                                                                    29


                                            Chapter 6

                       RISK ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT

6.1. Risk Assessment and Management. The IFC is responsible for managing available
resources to minimize risk to people, property, and the environment. Risk decisions based on
fact-based analysis provide a high degree of confidence that FES incidents will be managed
appropriately with available resources. Risk assessments based on actual emergency response
data, tempered with sound professional judgment, provides the best opportunity for effectively
managing FES incidents.
   6.1.1. Failure to provide adequate fire prevention services poses the greatest potential for
   long-term negative impact on fire safety. MAJCOM Directors, Installation Commanders,
   Base Civil Engineers and IFCs must ensure prevention programs including engineering
   controls, education, and enforcement receives the highest priority to effectively mitigate
   hazards (T-1).
   6.1.2. The FES operations function is critical to the safety of people and property during
   emergencies. When emergencies occur, early intervention is the critical factor in reducing
   the potential for damage, injury and death. For this reason, response time standards are
   crucial to initial success.
   6.1.3. The level of service provided must be balanced based on risk, probability of incidents
   and available resources. Although RLS may provide resources needed to accomplish
   successful operations, it must be measured against historic response data to ensure resources
   are sufficient for the risk. When CLS is reached, leaders must recognize the severe
   limitations of FES capability. There are, however, periods where the Installation
   Commander, Base Civil Engineer and IFC must consider a reduction of service. These
   include but are not limited to:
       6.1.3.1. Vehicles out of service, sick leaves, deployments, or support to mutual aid
       partners.
       6.1.3.2. Periods of reduced activity or “down days” when normal base operations
       (example, flying, aircraft maintenance or wing support functions) are suspended.
6.2. Allocating Resources. At OLS,        staffing is available to reasonably ensure successful
outcome at most emergency incidents.      However, RLS is expected to occur frequently and for
extended periods at most installations.    At any LOS, the IFC will allocate available resources
based upon assessment of local risks,     with the goal of maintaining at least CLS within the
response time standards for each fire     district. Use local emergency response data and the
following facts to allocate resources.
   6.2.1. Many FES incidents can be managed with one fire vehicle responding within the
   response time standard for early intervention. However, fire fighting is a labor-intensive task
   that requires adequate staffing to perform in as safe a manner as possible. Consequently,
   IFCs must actively manage FES incidents to reduce risk to firefighters and ensure rapid
   intervention teams are available.
   6.2.2. Historic data indicates most FES incidents occur when/where people are present and
   rarely occur in unoccupied buildings or parked aircraft not undergoing maintenance.
 30                                                         AFI32-2001 27 FEBRUARY 2014


6.3. Mitigating Risk. IFCs have wide latitude to manage risk in allocating available resources
according to local risk factors, to provide capability within the limits of available resources.
   6.3.1. Except to provide CLS capability, dramatic actions such as, increased work hours
   and/or contractor support are not necessary. By allocating available resources (vehicles in
   service and firefighters for a maximum of 72 hours per week), an acceptable level of service
   can normally be provided. Options to maximize available manpower resources include:
       6.3.1.1. Adjusting work schedules so more resources are available during higher risk
       periods and fewer during lower risk periods.
       6.3.1.2. Assigning management and administrative personnel to the FES Operations
       Section as training and certifications allow.
   6.3.2. Cross-staffing and utilizing qualified administrative personnel provides additional
   FES capability and can mitigate manpower shortages.
6.4. Risk Management Plans. The IFC will establish risk management plans addressing
reduced ERC when the department will operate below OLS for review by the BFM and approval
by the Installation Commander (T-1). The plan must include control measures implemented by
the IFC that describe both the probability and consequence of the potential risk (T-1). These
components include predicting the consequence of the identified risk and the probability of the
incident occurring based on historic response data. Control measures can include varying the
available resources by time of day and day of the week based on the predicted probability while
considering the consequence during both periods of risk. These plans are developed in advance
and consider the following factors:
   6.4.1. An assumption that only one major FES incident will occur at a time. All available
   FES resources may be employed to manage a single large FES incident.
   6.4.2. Historic emergency response data proves early intervention by occupants, operators or
   firefighters occurs at almost every FES incident, preventing major incidents that require
   extensive resources.
   6.4.3. When a reduction in the level of service occurs, IFCs implement the management plan
   actions. In all cases, IFCs are empowered to take any action necessary to continuously
   maintain CLS for each fire district unless operating at an ILS is approved by the MAJCOM
   Civil Engineer. With the Installation Commander’s recommendation, MAJCOM Civil
   Engineers may approve operating at ILS consisting of at least 4 firefighters and one vehicle
   provided follow-on responders are available within 24 minutes.
6.5. Level of Service Capability Reporting. CLS capability must be maintained in each fire
district at all times (T-1). Whenever CLS capability cannot be continuously provided additional
resources will be allocated to provide increased capability (T-1).
   6.5.1. To ensure commanders are aware of reduced capability, IFCs will make the following
   notifications:
   6.5.2. As RLS capability diminishes the IFC will immediately notify the BFM and submit an
   RM plan IAW paragraph 6.4.
   6.5.3. Prior to exceeding 72 hours at CLS the BFM will make appropriate notifications to
   inform the installation commander and MAJCOM FES Staff.
AFI32-2001 27 FEBRUARY 2014                                                                    31


   6.5.4. The BFM will make appropriate notifications to inform the installation commander
   and MAJCOM FES Staff when CLS will not be available for any period of time within a fire
   district (T-1).
6.6. Minimum Manning Standards. Except to define the CLS or ILS for each fire district, a
minimum number of firefighters required to be available is not specified by this instruction.
Minimum staffing standards that prescribe a number of firefighters that prevent varying the level
of service based on risk factors are prohibited. IFCs have wide latitude to allocate resources
according to local risk factors. Such standards restrict the IFC’s ability to allocate resources
according to risk factors; a fundamental tenet of FES risk management.

Terms
Aircraft Rescue and Fire Fighting (ARFF) Vehicle— Vehicles designed to deliver and
dispense fire fighting agents on fires involving aircraft.
Air Force Fire Emergency Services Community of Practice (AF FES CoP)— The official
web site for AF FES.
Automated Civil Engineer System—Fire Department (ACES-FD)— A comprehensive
automated fire department management, dispatch, data collection and fire incident reporting
system. ACES-FD is mandatory for use in all AF FES Flights excluding expeditionary flights.
Commission on Fire Accreditation International (CFAI)— The CFAI program is a
comprehensive self-assessment and evaluation model that enables fire and emergency services
organizations to examine past, current, and future service levels and performances and compare
them to industry best practices. This process leads to improved service delivery by helping fire
departments.
Critical Level of Service (CLS)— The level of service where one fire company (at least one
appropriate vehicle and 7 firefighters) is available to respond to each fire demand zone within
AFI32-2001 27 FEBRUARY 2014                                                                   39


response time standard. This level of service represents increased risk/loss potential due to the
lack of capability. CLS provides only one brief opportunity to accomplish FES objectives
without follow-on support.
Cross-Staffing— Used to ensure sufficient staffing levels; qualified administrative personnel
provide additional FES capability and can mitigate manpower shortages. Members present and
assigned are, on duty, and available to safely and effectively respond. The use of cross-staffing
reduces the capability to meet the minimum level of service objectives for multiple incidents.
DoD Component— USAF, USA, USN, USMC, and the Defense Logistics Agency.
DoD Fire and Emergency Services Certification Program (F&ESCP)— A national system of
accredited training that results in certification at various FES duty positions.
Emergency Response Capability (ERC)— The combination of trained personnel, available fire
fighting agent and equipment, and the ability of the FES Flight to meet established response time
standards. Deficiencies in these areas can diminish the overall capability of the flight. This
capability assumes that concurrent major emergency incidents will not occur.
Fire Demand Zone (FDZ)— A specific area within a fire district that demands similar
resources, tactics, and strategy to manage FES incidents. Within each FRD, fire demand zones
are established based on pre-planning and historical response data to identify specific
requirements/demands for FES incidents. FDZ are influenced by geography, special hazards,
type of construction, and occupancy. All facilities within an FDZ are identified with required
resources capable of meeting response times to the facilities 90% of the time. Resources from
multiple FRDs can be utilized to meet the FDZ requirements.
Fire District— The geographical area that a fire station serves.
Fire Vehicles— Emergency response vehicles designed to pump or carry fire extinguishing
agents to the scene of a fire, transport specialized equipment required for FES operations, or
provide command and control capability. Fire vehicles include command and control, pumpers,
rescue, HazMat, quints, aerials, wildland and ARFF vehicles.
Fire Safety Hazard— Conditions that can cause a fire.
Fire Safety Deficiency— Conditions that cannot directly cause a fire but will increase risk to
personnel or property if a fire occurs.
Inadequate Level of Service (ILS)— The level of service when ERC required for CLS is
unavailable. ILS is comprised of a minimum of one appropriate emergency response vehicle
consisting of 6 personnel or less. The property involved in the fire is expected to be destroyed.
National Fire Protection Association (NFPA)— A national organization, recognized as the
authority for all matters involving fire emergencies that publishes national consensus standards
and the National Fire Codes.
National Fire Incident Reporting System (NFIRS)— A national database of emergency
response data, owned by the Department of Homeland Security’s Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) and managed by the United States Fire Administration. NFIRS is
the central depository used by all DoD FES response organizations. ACES-FD sends response
data to the Naval Safety Center for population of the NFIRS database.
 40                                                         AFI32-2001 27 FEBRUARY 2014


Optimum Level of Service (OLS)— The level of service where all authorized resources are
available for emergency response within response time standards. OLS provides sufficient
capability for quick response and sustained operations after arrival on scene. During OLS,
emergency response forces accomplish all feasible FES objectives when responding to
emergency incidents.
Reduced Level of Service (RLS)— The level of service when ERC is less than OLS but greater
than CLS. Sufficient capability is provided for initial response, scene assessment and
implementation of mitigation tactics. This level of service represents increased risk/loss
potential due to lack of ERC to perform rescue and sufficient mitigation tactics simultaneously.
FES objectives may not be successful during situations where simultaneous rescue and fire
fighting activities are required.
Senior Fire Official (SFO)— The senior certified fire official at the scene of an emergency.
Wildland Urban Interface (WUI)— WUI is the area where houses/facilities meet or
intermingle with undeveloped wildland vegetation. Areas where houses/facilities and wildland
vegetation intermingle are referred to as intermix WUI. Developed areas that abut wildland
vegetation are characterized as interface WUI.
AFI32-2001 27 FEBRUARY 2014                                                                  41

                               FES RESPONSE REPORTING

A2.1. Initial Notification:
   A2.1.1. Within six hours of the beginning of a significant FES emergency incident, provide
   notification to AFCEC/CXF and Command FES office by phone (after duty hours) or email
   (during duty hours). Significant FES emergency incidents result in:
       A2.1.1.1. A loss of $50,000 or more to military family housing (combined AF and non-
       AF loss). NOTE: Report responses to privatized or leased housing incidents as mutual
       assistance responses when USAF organizations provide initial response services.
       A2.1.1.2. A loss of $100,000 or more (combined AF and non-AF loss).
       A2.1.1.3. Loss of life or lost time injury at incidents where FES personnel rendered
       service.
       A2.1.1.4. Injury to FES personnel occurred during the emergency operation.
       A2.1.1.5. Adverse public reaction.
       A2.1.1.6. Mutual aid responses that require extensive use of personnel or equipment to
       suppress major fires, assist in mass injury or casualty recovery, have significant public
       impact potential, or result in injury or death of AF personnel.
       A2.1.1.7. Any event that generates OPREP 3 where FES personnel responded, had
       knowledge, and/or rendered service.
       A2.1.1.8. Any aircraft hangar fire suppression system activation that discharges foam or
       any other fire suppression agent.
   A2.1.2. Initial notification methods:
       A2.1.2.1. During normal duty hours (0700-1600 Central Standard Time), the MAJCOM,
       FOA, or the base FES office will up-channel information by email (designate as high
       importance) to AFCEC.CXF.workflow@us.af.mil. Attach the report generated by the
       Fire Emergency Response Notification System (FERNS) (available at the AF FES CoP or
       the next generation replacement) or the ACES-FD generated report. When email is not
       immediately available, summarize the FERNS report by phone to AFCEC/CXF at DSN
       523-6321/6159/6158/6221/6150 or commercial (850) 283-6321/6159/6158/6221/6150,
       using priority precedence.
       A2.1.2.2. After normal duty hours (1600-0700 Central Standard Time), the MAJCOM,
       FOA, or base FES office sends an email as indicated in A2.1.2.1, then summarizes the
       FERNS report to AFCEC/CXF via 325th Fighter Wing Command Post, Tyndall AFB FL,
       DSN 523-2155/2023 or commercial (850) 283-2155/2023, and request contact with the
       AFCEC FES representative.
   A2.1.3. AFCEC/CXF notifies the USAF/A7CX staff when appropriate.
A2.2. Interim Updates. The IFC ensures AFCEC/CXF is notified of significant incidents in
progress for more than six hours, or when such incidents have not concluded within 12 hours.

A2.3. Final Notification by Email. Within 12 hours following a significant FES incident, the
IFC, through the BFM, will coordinate an email and forward to the Command FES office and
AFCEC.CXF.workflow@us.af.mil. Attach the complete FERNS report to this email.
A2.4. Final Report. The IFC will complete a report within five business days for all responses
through ACES-FD to the National Fire Incident Reporting System (NFIRS).
A2.5. Saves Report. The IFC will evaluate each emergency operation to determine if a save
resulted. A save is when the direct action of firefighters saved a life, prevented further injury or
made a rescue, saved property from fire or prevented/avoided a direct loss to the AF. More
specific instructions and the Saves Report are available at the AF FES CoP or next generation
replacement. Complete the Saves Report and forward to the Command FES office that in-turn
will forward to AFCEC.CXF.workflow@us.af.mil no later than 72 hours after the incident.

their own jurisdictions.

l. Should a dispute arise between the Parties under or related to this Agreement, the Parties agree
that within 30 days after notice of the dispute from one Party to the other, the Parties will attempt
to resolve the dispute through negotiations. If such negotiations reach an impasse, the Parties
agree that within 60 days after Notice of an impasse, they will attempt to resolve the matter
through any method or combination of non-binding alternative dispute resolution (ADR)
methods available under the Administrative Dispute Resolution Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-
320 (codified at 5 U.S.C. §§ 571-583). The cost of any third party neutral will be divided
equally between the Parties, and the selection of any third party neutral will be by agreement of
the Parties. If such ADR proceeding does not result in resolution of the dispute, the Parties may
separately pursue any remedy available to a Party under the law. However, both Parties agree
that the initiation of formal litigation does not preclude further attempts at resolving the dispute
through alternative dispute resolution methods. Both Parties agree that the terms of this clause
will be considered the “Administrative Remedies” that must be exhausted, prior to institution of
any formal litigation.
