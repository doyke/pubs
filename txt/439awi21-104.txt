1. The Weekly Flying/Maintenance Schedule. The 439th Operations Support Squadron (439
OSS), Operations Scheduling (OSOS), 439 MOS/Plans Scheduling and Documentation (PS&D)
and 439 AMXS/MXAB sections maintain constant coordination to minimize the impact changes
have on achieving long range objectives and maximizing reaction time. This schedule is the
final planning guide for both maintenance and operations. Daily coordination efforts between
439 OSS/OSOS, 439 PS&D and 439 AMXS/MXAB ensure changes to the schedule are
necessary and kept to a minimum. Verbal coordination will be followed up by generation of the
AF Form 2407.
2. Procedures. The weekly flying schedule will be posted in accordance with Air Force
Instruction (AFI) 21-101, paragraph 7.8.2. Changes to the weekly flying schedule require
coordination and approval. Commanders may delegate this authority to the designated

the AFMS/Online Schedules/Weekly directory. All schedule changes will be coordinated and
documented electronically prior to the start of the flying period, on an AF Form 2407. The form
is located on the L-Drive, under the AFMS/Online Schedules/Weekly directory, and will be
transmitted by the requesting agency and will submit the AF Form 2407 with specific reasons for
the change to their approving authority Production Superintendent or an individual within their
Chain of Command that is listed on the authorization AF Form 2407 approval officials’ letter.
The Approving Official will approve the AF Form 2407 by electronically signing the appropriate
block. Upon approval, the AF Form 2407 will be forwarded for coordination to Operations
Scheduling, 439 PS&D and 439 Maintenance Operations Control (MOC).

     MOC.

     (GO81 and locally developed spreadsheets to include the Monthly and Weekly online
     schedules).
