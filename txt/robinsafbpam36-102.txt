swings, excessive crying, excessive anger, out of character language or actions. May include

    this problem.”

    and take care of this”; shouting uncontrollably and throwing things.

           2.1.1.1. Talk to the employee. The employee may have personal difficulties. Do not
           suggest to the employee that you believe that his/her behavior is due to a medical
           problem, but be supportive if the employee defends his/her actions claiming a
           medical condition. If the employee indicates a medical problem, contact the
           Occupational Medicine Services (OMS) office, extension 67590, for guidance. Do
           not send the employee to OMS without clearance from the Chief of Occupational
           Medicine. Under most circumstances, the employee should be directed to obtain
           medical documentation from his/her personal healthcare provider. It is appropriate to
           remind troubled employees that Employee Assistance Program counselors are
           available. After 1530 and on weekends, the employee may be granted sick leave,
           annual leave, or leave without pay, if requested. Assistance is available for civilian
           employees 24 hours a day through Federal Occupational Health at 1-800-222-0364.

           (EMR) specialist in the Directorate of Personnel (WRALC/DPLA/B) through
           Customer Service for further guidance at extension 20601.
           2.1.1.2. If there is reason to believe the employee is suicidal, contact OMS for
           guidance immediately. Do not leave the employee alone. After 1530 hours and on
           weekends, escort the employee to the Houston Medical Center Emergency Room for
           evaluation. The supervisor should contact the emergency POC identified on the
           employee’s AF Form 971, Supervisor’s Employee Brief, advise them of the
           employee’s situation, and have POC meet employee at the Houston Medical Center
           Emergency Room, if necessary. Document incident(s)/behavior and notify the EMR
           specialist as soon as possible.
       2.1.2. CATEGORY B.
           2.1.2.1. Contact your servicing EMR specialist immediately for guidance. If the

         2.1.4.4. Document the incident(s), get witnesses’ statements, if possible, and contact
         the servicing EMR specialist as soon as possible for further guidance.
  2.1.5. For all Categories, if management offers or orders a medical examination which is
  beyond the scope of care provided in OMS or Mental Health, the unit must provide adequate
  funding for the examination to be performed by an off-base medical provider.
  2.2. EMPLOYEE RELATIONS
     2.2.1. CATEGORY A.
         2.2.1.1. Determine if supervisor has discussed behavior with the employee.
         2.2.1.2. If the employee claims there is a medical problem, contact OMS for advice
         on how to properly direct the employee to provide medical documentation from
         his/her healthcare provider.
