SUBJECT: Air Force Guidance Memorandum for AFI 36-2205, Applying for Flying Training,
         Air Battle Manager, and Astronaut Programs

       By Order of the Secretary of the Air Force, this Air Force Guidance Memorandum
provides policy changes to AFI 36-2205, Applying for Flying Training, Air Battle Manager, and
Astronaut Programs (dated 29 October 2004). Compliance with this memorandum is
mandatory. To the extent its directions are inconsistent with other Air Force publications, the
information herein prevails in accordance with AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms
Management.

        This memorandum changes policies and procedures relevant to application requirements
for specialized undergraduate pilot training (SUPT) and undergraduate remotely piloted aircraft
training (URT). Specifically, the change mandates a minimum Pilot Candidate Selection Method
(PCSM) score, consolidates minimum AFOQT scores for pilot, RPA, CSO and ABM candidates,
and transfers the waiver authority for applicants who require age and/or total federal service
commission date (TFCSD) limit waivers to attend undergraduate flying training.

This Guidance Memorandum that applies to all Regular Air Force (RegAF), Air National Guard
(ANG), and Air Force Reserve (AFR) members, except where noted otherwise and becomes
void after one year has elapsed from the date of this memorandum, or upon incorporation by
interim change to, or rewrite of AFI 36-2205, whichever is earlier.

This instruction sets eligibility guidelines, application requirements, and responsibilities for
undergraduate flying training, air battle manager, and astronaut programs for Air Force officers
and enlisted members on Extended Active Duty (EAD). This Air Force Instruction (AFI) serves
as an application guide for pilot and navigator training for officers and enlisted members of the
Air National Guard (ANG) and Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC). Members of the ANG
and AFRC are ineligible to apply to the active duty programs under the provisions of this
instruction, regardless of length of active duty tour or EAD status. Age and/or total federal
service commission date (TFCSD) limit waivers must be submitted through the chain of
command to the Air Force Chief of Staff (CSAF), delegated to the Vice Chief of Staff (AF/CV),
for approval. This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 36-22, Military
Training and directs collecting and maintaining information subject to the Privacy Act of 1974
authorized by Title 10, United States Code (U.S.C.), and Section 8013, Secretary of the Air
Force. System of Records Notice F036 AFPC M, Officer Utilization Records System, applies.
Refer to Attachment 1 for glossary. Process all supplements that affect any military personnel
function as shown in AFI 33-360, volume 1, Publications Management Program. Maintain and
dispose of all records created as a result of prescribed processes in this instruction in accordance
with AFMAN 37-139, Records Disposition Schedule. The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995
affects this instruction. The Forms Management Program per AFI 33-360, volume 2, Forms
Management Program affects this instruction. Send comments and suggested improvements of
this AFI on AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication, to (HQ
AFPC/DPAOT3), 550 C Street West Suite 31, Randolph AFB TX 78150-4733.

(Replace) 1.1.1. Meet all medical standards for pilot (including RPA pilot), combat system
operator (formerly navigator), or air battle manager training as specified in AFI48-123, Medical
Examination and Medical Standards.

(Replace) 1.1.4.1. Rated applicants must complete the Test of Basic Aviation Skills (TBAS) and
attain minimum required Air Force Officer Qualification Test (AFOQT) scores as outlined in
Table 1.1. Line officer commissioning program information and standards are located in AFI36-
2605, Air Force Military Personnel Testing System. Contact the military personnel section or the
base education office for more information regarding AFOQT and TBAS testing. Note: AF/A1P
is the approval authority for all exception to policy (ETP) requests to waive minimum standards.
Submit requests in writing with the commander’s concurrence via AFPC/DSYX to AF/A1PT.

(Add New) 1.1.4.1.1. Individuals applying for pilot training and remotely piloted aircraft (RPA)
training require a Pilot Candidate Selection Method (PCSM) score of at least 10. PCSM
combines the TBAS score with the pilot AFOQT score and private flying time (see AFI 36-2605,
attachment 3). AFI 36-2605, attachment 1, clarifies the procedure for applicants to follow when
updating flying hours used in the PCSM calculation. All updates to flying hours must be
processed 45 days prior to selection board date to allow updates to the PCSM. Updates received
after the cut-off may not be reviewed by the selection board. Enter the PCSM score in the block
provided on AF Form 215, Aircrew Training Candidate Data Summary. PCSM scores are
available online at http://access.afpc.af.mil/pcsmdmz/index.html. Questions can be directed to
the PCSM Program Office at (210) 698-4460 or toll-free (866) 698-4464, ext. 101.

(Modify Existing) A2.1. Change HQ USAF/DPPPR to HQ USAF/A1PPR

(Replace) A2.2. Active Component Airmen: Submit the request for an age and/or TFCSD limit
waiver indorsed by the applicant’s immediate squadron, group, and wing commander to the
respective MAJCOM/A3 (or functional equivalent). MAJCOM/A3s will forward the waiver
request to AF/A1PPR (see A.2.1 for instructions), who will then staff the request to AF/A3/5 for
final decision (Figure 1). Reserve Component Airmen: Applicants in the rank of Captain (O-3)
and below shall submit requests through the applicant’s immediate squadron, group and wing
commander to NGB/A3 (AFRC/A3 for Reserve applicants) in coordination with respective
Rated Management and Personnel Policy sections. NGB/CF and AFRC/CC have final decision
authority for their respective waiver requests in this category (Figure 1). Applicants in the rank
of Major (0-4) and above shall submit requests through the RegAF process following NGB/A3
(AFRC/A3 for Reserve applicants) endorsement (Figure 2). All component requests shall
include names, dates, and other details to clearly document the administrative, counseling, or
medical error. Attach a complete copy of the UFT application and include a completed flying
class I/IA physical with any approved medical waivers, certified by HQ AETC/SGPS.

                         Figure 1.                              Figure 2.
(Replace) A2.3. If a member exceeds the age and/or TFCSD limits and does not meet the above
criteria to be considered for a waiver, he or she may request an exception to policy (ETP)
through their MAJCOM or ANG chain of command as directed in A2.2. Age and TFCSD limits
exist to protect the interests of the total rated force and should not be taken lightly. Exceptions to
policy will normally be granted only in rare circumstances when a commander can document
sustained, exceptional performance and the deviation from policy is minor. Further, commanders
must specifically and explicitly justify why supporting an ETP for an individual, considering a
large pool of fully qualified applicants, is in the best interests of the Air Force, Air National
Guard, or Air Force Reserve. Each ETP imposes potential increased risk to operational safety
and effectiveness. Only the rare, truly exceptional individual should be endorsed and forwarded
through the chain of command for ETP consideration.

                                 APPLICATIONS FOR
                      UNDERGRADUATE FLYING TRAINING (UFT) AND
                            AIR BATTLE MANAGER (ABM)

1.1. Application Requirements. Refer to Figure 1.1. for eligibility criteria. The applicant must:
    1.1.1. Meet all medical standards for pilot, navigator, or air battle manager training as specified in
    AFI 48-123, Medical Examination and Medical Standards.
    1.1.2. A flying training eliminee (FTE) recommended for Specialized Undergraduate Navigator
    Training (SUNT) by the eliminating or approving authority may exceed the 30 year age limit and 5
    years of total active federal commissioned service (TAFCS) at the time of entry into SUNT. The FTE
    must be selected for SUNT while in eliminee status and SUNT must be the initial training following
    elimination from pilot training. The FTE must meet the minimum Air Force Officer Qualification Test
    (AFOQT) requirements outlined in paragraph 1.1.3. and academic requirements established by HQ
    AETC. Active duty officers lose their eliminee status if they depart permanent change of station
    (PCS) from the UFT training location, or are awarded a new Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC). ANG
    and AFRES FTEs may return to their home station to await next available training class start date
    without loss of FTE status.
    1.1.3. Officers attending UFT who are eliminated due to short-term (less than 1 year) medical reasons
    (as determined by the eliminating authority) will be re-entered into the same UFT program following
    medical requalification. Those officers who are eliminated due to long-term (1 year or more) medical
    reasons may reapply for consideration on the first UFT selection board following medical requalifica-
    tion as long as they remain otherwise eligible.
    1.1.4. Requirements:
       1.1.4.1. Attain minimum required AFOQT scores. Items 1, 2, and 3 below apply to pilot and nav-
       igator applicants, only items 2 and 3 apply to ABM applicants. NOTE: See AFI 36-2605, Air
       Force Military Personnel Testing Systems, for AFOQT procedures. For the purpose of this appli-
       cation, AFOQT scores do not expire.
       1.1.4.2. Score in the 25th percentile or higher in the respective category (pilot or navigator-tech-
       nical) composite for which they are applying.
       1.1.4.3. The combined total score of the pilot and the navigator composites must be at least 50th
       percentile.
       1.1.4.4. At no time shall the pilot or navigator composite be less than the 10th percentile.
    1.1.5. Pilot applicants must complete the Basic Attributes Test (BAT). Schedule BAT testing through
    your Military Personnel Flight (MPF) Customer Service Section. The Pilot Candidate Selection
    Method (PCSM) combines the BAT score with the pilot AFOQT score and private flying time. A
    PCSM score is a requirement for all individuals applying for pilot training through any of the Air
    Force pilot training accession sources (see AFI 36-2605, attachment 3). AFI 36-2605, attachment 1,
    clarifies the procedure for applicants to follow when updating flying hours used in the PCSM calcula-
    tion. All updates to flying hours must be processed 45 days prior to selection board date to allow
    updates to the PCSM. Any updates processed after the cut-off may not be processed in sufficient time

   for review by the selection board. Enter the PCSM score in the block provided on AF Form 215, Air-
   crew Training Candidate Data Summary.
   1.1.6. Active Duty applicants must not exceed their 30th birthday or 5 years beyond their Total Fed-
   eral Commissioned Service Date (TFCSD) by the start date of the board’s first available UFT class as
   specified in the UFT Selection Board Announcement message. See Attachment 2 for age or commis-
   sioned service waiver request procedures. Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve applicants must
   not exceed their 30th birthday or 5 years beyond their TFCSD by their assigned UFT class start date

                   AGE OR COMMISSIONED SERVICE WAIVER REQUEST

A2.1. Applying for an Age or Commissioned Service Waiver. Submit a request for a waiver in memo
form with the appropriate letterhead and current address. (See AFMAN 33-326, Preparing Official Com-
munications)
For Active-duty Age Waiver Requests:HQ USAF/DPPPR
(Recommend sending by overnight mail)1040 Air Force Pentagon
Washington DC 20330-1040
For ANG waiver requests, route through:State Adjutant General
                                      to: HQ ANG/DPFO
Jefferson Plaza #1, 10th Floor
1411 Jefferson Davis Highway
Arlington VA 22202-3231
If an ANG request is disapproved, it will be returned through HQ ANG/DPDF to the applicant’s state
headquarters, which will forward to the applicant’s unit.
For AFRC waiver requests, send to:HQ AFRC/DPMB
155 Richard Ray Blvd
Robins AFB GA 31098-1635
Waivers.
   A2.1.1. For waiver requests to be considered, applicants who exceed the age and/or TFCSD criteria
   must document that an administrative, counseling, or medical error occurred within the last two years
   and prevented the applicant from applying for UFT when otherwise fully eligible. Further, command-
   ers must explicitly justify why supporting a waiver for an individual over fully qualified candidates is
   in the best interest of the Air Force, Air National Guard, or Air Force Reserve. Applicants who have
   already had at least one opportunity to compete for UFT are generally not approved for a waiver.
   A2.1.2. Administrative error: Committed by an Air Force, Air National Guard, or Air Force Reserve
   agency or otherwise beyond the applicant’s control. Examples of administrative errors include:
       A2.1.2.1. An application package was forwarded to the MPF to process, but the MPF failed to
       forward it, sent it to the wrong address, or did not properly screen the application package for the
       required forms resulting in the package not meeting the UFT selection board.
       A2.1.2.2. An incomplete or incorrect medical form.
   A2.1.3. Counseling error: An Air Force, Air National Guard, or Air Force Reserve agency gave
   incorrect information that the applicant could not verify. For example, a member was told that he
   could not apply for UFT when he actually met all the eligibility criteria.
   A2.1.4. Medical error: An incorrect diagnosis of a medical condition prevented the applicant from
   applying when otherwise eligible. For example, a member was diagnosed as having a disqualifying
20                                                                      AFI36-2205 29 OCTOBER 2004


     condition, but a review of the original diagnosis showed he was medically qualified. Attach the orig-
     inal medical form and the medical authority's supporting comments.

A2.2. Submit the request for an age and/or TFCSD waiver indorsed by the applicant’s immediate Squad-
ron/CC, Group/CC, Wing/CC, NAF/CC, and MAJCOM/CC (or appropriate chain-of-command leading
to The Adjutant General (TAG) for ANG applicants), and forward to HQ USAF/DPPPR or HQ ANG/
DPFO for staffing to the CSAF for final action. Include names, dates, and other details to clearly docu-
ment the administrative, counseling, or medical error. Attach a complete copy of the UFT application and
include a completed flying class I/IA physical with any approved medical waivers, certified by HQ
AETC/SGPS.
     A2.2.1. All waiver requests are reviewed on an individual basis and, if approved, allow the applicant
     a one-time opportunity to compete for UFT. For active duty, if the requested age and/or TFCSD
     waiver is not received in time for CSAF action before the UFT board convenes, the waiver package
     will be returned to the MAJCOM POC. If the waiver request is approved, HQ USAF/DPPPR will for-
     ward the package to HQ AFPC/DPAOT3 for inclusion on the board and notify the MAJCOM POC.
     However, if the application is disapproved, it will be returned to the MAJCOM POC. In either case,
     the MAJCOM POC will notify the applicant of the CSAF action through the chain of command. For
     ANG applications, USAF/DPPPR will forward approved and disapproved applications to ANG/
     DPDF for class scheduling or further disposition. In all cases, the individual applicant will be notified
     of the waiver decision via the chain-of-command.
     A2.2.2. The CSAF may delegate the approval authority for age and commissioned service waiver
     requests.
     A2.2.3. The disapproval authority for an age or TFCSD waiver is vested in the Wing/CC (or equiva-
     lent). If the application is disapproved, it will be returned to the applicant. The disapproval authority
     within the ANG chain-of-command for an age or TFCSD waiver is The Adjutant General. Any appli-
     cation disapproved by The Adjutant General will be returned to the applicant.
     Exceptions to Policy.

A2.3. If a member exceeds the age and/or TFCSD limits and does not meet the above criteria to be con-
sidered for a waiver, he or she may request an exception to policy (ETP) through their MAJCOM or ANG
chain of command as directed in A2.3. Age and TFCSD limits exist to protect the interests of the total
rated force and should not be taken lightly. Exceptions to policy will normally be granted only in rare cir-
cumstances when a commander can document sustained, exceptional performance and the deviation from
policy is minor. Further, commanders must specifically and explicitly justify why supporting an ETP for
an individual, considering a large pool of fully qualified applicants, is in the best interests of the Air
Force, Air National Guard, or Air Force Reserve. Each ETP imposes potential increased risk to opera-
tional safety and effectiveness. Only the rare, truly exceptional individual should be endorsed and for-
warded through the chain of command for ETP consideration.
     A2.3.1. ETP requests judged by the Wing/CC (or equivalent) or TAG for Air National Guard, to have
     insufficient support or merit should be denied and returned to the applicant.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This change adds IC 2004-1 (Attachment 9). This change distinguishes between a waiver and an excep-
tion to policy and clarifies the process for an Undergraduate Flying Training applicant to request a waiver
or exception to policy to the age and Total Federal Commissioned Service limits. See the last attachment
of the publication, IC 2004-1, for the complete IC. A bar (/) indicates revision from the previous edition.

Waivers.
A2.2.. For waiver requests to be considered, applicants who exceed the age and/or TFCSD criteria must
document that an administrative, counseling, or medical error occurred within the last two years and pre-
vented the applicant from applying for UFT when otherwise fully eligible. Further, commanders must
explicitly justify why supporting a waiver for an individual over fully qualified candidates is in the best
interest of the Air Force, Air National Guard, or Air Force Reserve. Applicants who have already had at
least one opportunity to compete for UFT are generally not approved for a waiver.
A2.2.1. Administrative error: Committed by an Air Force, Air National Guard, or Air Force Reserve
agency or otherwise beyond the applicant’s control. Examples of administrative errors include:
A2.2.1.1. An application package was forwarded to the MPF to process, but the MPF failed to forward it,
sent it to the wrong address, or did not properly screen the application package for the required forms
resulting in the package not meeting the UFT selection board.
A2.2.12.. An incomplete or incorrect medical form.
A2.2.2. Counseling error: An Air Force, Air National Guard, or Air Force Reserve agency gave incorrect
information that the applicant could not verify. For example, a member was told that he could not apply
for UFT when he actually met all the eligibility criteria.
A2.2.3. Medical error: An incorrect diagnosis of a medical condition prevented the applicant from apply-
ing when otherwise eligible. For example, a member was diagnosed as having a disqualifying condition,
but a review of the original diagnosis showed he was medically qualified. Attach the original medical
form and the medical authority's supporting comments.
A2.3. Submit the request for an age and/or TFCSD waiver indorsed by the applicant’s immediate Squad-
ron/CC, Group/CC, Wing/CC, NAF/CC, and MAJCOM/CC (or appropriate chain-of-command leading
to The Adjutant General (TAG) for ANG applicants), and forward to HQ USAF/DPPPR or HQ ANG/
DPFO for staffing to the CSAF for final action. Include names, dates, and other details to clearly docu-
ment the administrative, counseling, or medical error. Attach a complete copy of the UFT application and
include a completed flying class I/IA physical with any approved medical waivers, certified by HQ
AETC/SGPS.
A2.3.1. All waiver requests are reviewed on an individual basis and, if approved, allow the applicant a
one-time opportunity to compete for UFT. For active duty, if the requested age and/or TFCSD waiver is
not received in time for CSAF action before the UFT board convenes, the waiver package will be returned
to the MAJCOM POC. If the waiver request is approved, HQ USAF/DPPPR will forward the package to
HQ AFPC/DPAOT3 for inclusion on the board and notify the MAJCOM POC. However, if the applica-
tion is disapproved, it will be returned to the MAJCOM POC. In either case, the MAJCOM POC will
notify the applicant of the CSAF action through the chain of command. For ANG applications, USAF/
DPPPR will forward approved and disapproved applications to ANG/DPDF for class scheduling or fur-
ther disposition. In all cases, the individual applicant will be notified of the waiver decision via the
chain-of-command.
A2.3.2. The CSAF may delegate the approval authority for age and commissioned service waiver
requests.
A2.3.3. The disapproval authority for an age or TFCSD waiver is vested in the Wing/CC (or equivalent).
If the application is disapproved, it will be returned to the applicant. The disapproval authority within the
AFI36-2205 29 OCTOBER 2004                                                                               33


ANG chain-of-command for an age or TFCSD waiver is The Adjutant General. Any application disap-
proved by The Adjutant General will be returned to the applicant.
Exceptions to Policy.
A2.4. If a member exceeds the age and/or TFCSD limits and does not meet the above criteria to be con-
sidered for a waiver, he or she may request an exception to policy (ETP) through their MAJCOM or ANG
chain of command as directed in A2.3. Age and TFCSD limits exist to protect the interests of the total
rated force and should not be taken lightly. Exceptions to policy will normally be granted only in rare cir-
cumstances when a commander can document sustained, exceptional performance and the deviation from
policy is minor. Further, commanders must specifically and explicitly justify why supporting an ETP for
an individual, considering a large pool of fully qualified applicants, is in the best interests of the Air
Force, Air National Guard, or Air Force Reserve. Each ETP imposes potential increased risk to opera-
tional safety and effectiveness. Only the rare, truly exceptional individual should be endorsed and for-
warded through the chain of command for ETP consideration.
