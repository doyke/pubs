This publication establishes procedures for Air Force Policy Directive 21-1, Managing
Aerospace Equipment Maintenance; and establishes procedures for the 366th Fighter Wing (366
FW) Bad Actor, CND, and Repeat/Recur Program. This instruction pertains to, but is not limited
to maintenance actions within the 366th Maintenance Group (366 MXG), the 366th Aircraft
Maintenance Squadron (366 AMXS), and the 366th Component Maintenance Squadron (366
CMS). It implements guidelines contained in Air Force Instruction (AFI) 21-101, Aerospace
Equipment Maintenance Management, and Combat Air Force (CAF) Supplement; and Technical
Order (TO) TO 00-35D-54-WA-1, USAF Deficiency Reporting, Investigating, and Resolution. It
is applicable to avionics maintenance personnel under the direction of 366 MXG/CC. Ensure all
records created (e.g., DD Form 1574, AFTO Form 350, CND Report, etc.) as a result of
processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with (IAW) Air Force
Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of IAW Air Force Records
Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at
https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61a/afrims/afrims/. Contact supporting records managers as

1. General. The primary objective of the bad actor program is to identify and remove from
service avionics LRUs that repeatedly fail on the aircraft but cannot be reliably duplicated or
repaired during intermediate level maintenance. Return these units to depot for further testing to
identify deficient technical data, operational flight programs, or built-in-tests, poor quality
design, manufacturing defects, inadequate training, or software test voids in the field. The
objectives of CND, Repeat/Recur Program is to ensure a thorough review occurs on all LRUs
which CND during bench check, or are identified as in-shop repeat/recurs during historical
research. While specific procedures for CND, and repeat/recur LRUs may differ in individual
sections, all sections will exercise proper supervisory review of maintenance actions to ensure
only quality products are returned to Aircraft Maintenance Units (AMU) or supply.
2. Responsibilities:
     2.1. Ensure bad actor LRUs are identified and returned to depot with a Deficiency Report
     (DR).
     2.2. Ensure bad actor LRUs have detailed documentation on fault indications, test steps
     failure results, and past failure data.
     2.3. Ensure authorized personnel review LRU histories and maintenance actions for all
     CNDs.
     2.4. Ensure LRUs are identified as repeat/recur through LRU historical checks.
3. Procedures:
     3.1. Closely scrutinize LRUs delivered from AMU for accurate description on the Air Force
     Technical Order (AFTO) Form 350, Reparable Item Processing Tag. If failure data is
     inadequate, contact the squadron production supervisor or AMU technician for clarification.
     3.2. Avionics flight technicians will maintain close coordination with AMU avionics
     specialists to collect additional failure data such as repeated cannibalizations, multiple
     failures on different aircraft, and other problems.
     3.3. Sections performing 3-level maintenance will do a thorough review of LRU history
     before maintenance to determine if LRU meets repeat/recur criteria. Sections performing 2-
     level maintenance may wait until completion of maintenance to review LRU history as
     testing failure will dictate return to depot.
     3.4. For first time LRU repair action or CND the following procedures apply. Upon
     completion of testing, a qualified technician will inspect the LRU, sign two Department of
     Defense (DD) Forms 1574, Serviceable Tag – Materiel, and return unit to service. Submit
     LRU and paperwork to work center production supervisor for history review. Use Global
     Eye/RAMPOD database or equivalent to annotate "FIRST TIME CND". In an effort to
     provide immediate feedback to AMU supervision, electronically route CND report IAW
     Attachment 2, Sample CND Report, as an e-mail attachment to squadron production
     supervisor. Squadron Production Supervision (Mustang-2) will inform maintenance
     supervision and applicable AMU supervision.
     3.5. For first time repeat/recur (second time in repair cycle) the following procedures apply.
     Conduct standard LRU testing. If testing results in a BCS without a repair action taken
     (CND), open the LRU, inspected for internal chassis damage, foreign objects/debris and all
     components reseated. Repeat standard testing. If the unit tests without error or fault, notify

   work center supervisor for history review, annotate Global Eye/RAMPOD database "FIRST
   REPEAT/RECUR," and electronically route CND worksheet IAW Attachment 2 as an e-
   mail attachment to Squadron Production Supervisor (Mustang-2). Mustang-2 will inform
   maintenance supervision and applicable AMU supervision.
   3.6. For second repeat/recur failure (third time in repair cycle) the following procedures
   apply. Conduct standard LRU testing. If testing results in a BCS with no repair action taken
   (CND), take the suspect LRU to AMU for aircraft ground/BIT checks. If not possible, enter
   the LRU into the Bad Actor Program. Return LRUs to depot with a DR. Brief the avionics
   flight chief, maintenance supervision, and AMU maintenance supervision on LRU history for
   each bad actor returned to depot.
   3.7. If a LRU is ground checked on an aircraft and a faulty component is isolated as the
   cause of the repeat/recur failure, return the component to depot with a DR. The LRU will
   continue to be monitored as a repeat/recur until no longer applicable.

Definitions
Could Not Duplicate (CND) is defined as a reported failure that cannot be duplicated during
standard in-shop testing procedures.
MOUNTAINHOMEAFBI21-167 19 JULY 2010                                                            5


A "Repeat" in the backshop is defined as an identical or similar LRU failure that occurs within
5 hours of operation for items with elapsed time indicators (ETI) or within 10 calendar days for
items without ETI.
A "Recur" in the backshop is defined as an identical or similar LRU failure occurring within
15 hours of operation for items with an ETI or within 30 calendar days for items without an ETI.
A "Bad Actor" in the backshop is defined as a second time repeat/recur failure – third time in
shop under previously identified criteria. If testing results in a Bench Check Serviceable (BCS)
with no repair action taken, the unit should be entered into the Bad Actor Program.
A LRU can also be considered a bad actor if it has a combination of CND and repair actions in a
6-month period but continues to exhibit aircraft failures. Note: While these criteria attempt to
be comprehensive, the discretion of the reviewer should be used to ensure a suspected LRU
meets the intent of these criteria. If AMU and backshop technicians concur, LRUs may be
returned to depot as bad actors before above criteria are met. All bad actor LRUs will have DRs
submitted.
