   2.1.1. IAW Health Affairs Policy Memo 06-006, the PHA is required annually. This is
   distinct from IMR policy as it applies to all Airmen, including those who are non-deployable
   and may be exempt from IMR standards. (T-0).
   2.1.2. PHAs become due (turn “yellow”) 12 months (366 days) from the last PHA
   completion date. Once the PHA becomes due, there is a 90-day “yellow” window to
   accomplish the PHA before the PHA “goes red” and the unit is penalized on their PHA IMR
   (i.e., the PHA is green for 365 days; turns yellow (due) on day 366, and turns red (overdue)
   90 days later on day 456). Note: It is not the intent of the 90-day yellow period to establish
   a de facto 15-month PHA requirement. PHAs performed just prior to the 15-month cut-off
   should be the rare exception and not the rule. (T-0).
   2.1.3. An AF Form 1042, Medical Recommendation for Flying or Special Operational Duty,
   for personnel in special operational duty status, issued in conjunction with PHAs will be
   valid for the entire green and yellow periods (12 months plus 90 days; 455 days total). (T-2).
   Reference paragraph 2.1.4.1. for undergraduate pilot training (UPT).
   2.1.4. Newly accessed Airmen will have their first PHA accomplished during the first 180
   days of their first permanent duty assignment. Upon in-processing, their PHA will be
   considered to be in a “yellow” status and turn “red” on day 181 if the PHA is not completed.
   (T-1).
       2.1.4.1. A member’s PHA should be current prior to beginning active UPT and remain
       current throughout.
       2.1.4.2. If a member was not on AD (e.g., AFROTC/OTS candidates) prior to arrival at
       UPT or is otherwise not PHA current, then the member will have a PHA accomplished
       during their in-processing at the UPT base. (T-2).
   2.1.5. PHAs will not routinely be completed earlier than 30 days prior to due date (60 days
   for ARC Airmen) except to accommodate circumstances specified below. Note: The
   element (FHME, FOMC or MSME) servicing the patient will identify the need for an early
   PHA. (T-1). Reference paragraphs 1.2.19.1., 2.1.6.4., 2.1.7., 2.1.8., or 2.2.10. for specifics
   regarding these exceptions:
       2.1.5.1. As required to coordinate with attending in-residence PME, retraining/training
       assignments, PCS to remote locations and GSUs (as defined in 1.2.6.2.), and prolonged
       temporary duties (TDYs); (T-1).
       2.1.5.2. Every effort will be made to synchronize the timing of DHA 4 and DHA 5 with
       a member's PHA IAW NDAA 2010, Sec 708, DoDI 6490.03, Deployment Health, and
       DoDI 6490.12, Mental Health Assessments for Service Members Deployed in Connection
       with a Contingency Operation. A complete DHA Program Guide, with additional
       information on timing and other requirements can be found on the Kx at
       https://kx2.afms.mil/kj/kx3/deploymenthealth/Pages/home.aspx. (T-0).
10                                                          AFI44-170 30 JANUARY 2014


     2.1.5.3. As permitted by MAJCOM/SGP or AFMSA/SG3PF AF Form 1042 waivers;
     (T-1).
     2.1.5.4. In cases of ANG general officer promotions; and (T-1).
     2.1.5.5. As needed to accommodate mandatory occupational and environmental health
     medical surveillance exams (OEH MSE). (T-1).
  2.1.6. Face-to-face provider PHA appointment criteria.
     2.1.6.1. Airmen will have a face-to-face preventive health visit with a credentialed
     provider at least once every three years (ANG every 5 years). Face-to-face provider PHA
     visits, as well as any non-dental visits, which have an age-, gender-, and risk-based
     prevention-focused piece, will satisfy this requirement (see PHA guide for further
     details). Providers are strongly encouraged to accurately code preventive visits with
     appropriate codes. When such preventive services are provided, patient care teams
     should also update ASIMS reflecting that a face-to-face prevention visit has occurred.
     Note: ARC medical units are not required to code PHA visits. (T-2).
     2.1.6.2. Additional face-to-face provider PHA appointments may be necessary under the
     following circumstances:
         2.1.6.2.1. A patient may request a provider appointment in conjunction with their
         PHA visit. (T-2).
         2.1.6.2.2. As required per PHA business rules. (T-2).
         2.1.6.2.3. A provider appointment may be directed by the Airman’s patient care team
         (or surrogate) after AF Web HA, health record review, AHLTA and ASIMS review.
         The patient care team, led by the provider, will review and document
         critical/priority/routine health risk assessment findings, and assess if further
         evaluation is required. (T-1).
     2.1.6.3. MAJCOMs and MTFs may modify business rules to require more frequent
     provider PHA visits; however, ASIMS and AF Web HA software will not be modified to
     accommodate MAJCOM-specific or MTF-specific business rules. (T-1).
     2.1.6.4. PHAs for Airmen requiring an AF Form 1042 will be accomplished as part of
     their annual face-to-face Flight and Operational Medicine Examination (FOME) (i.e.,
     flying/special duty physical). (T-1). Note: The approval authority for extensions or
     waivers for FOMEs or PHAs is the MAJCOM/SGP or AFMSA/SG3PF.
  2.1.7. Airmen PCSing from an AF installation to a remote location or another location
  without local AF MTF FHME support will have a PHA within 60 days of PCS even if this
  means accomplishing a PHA earlier than the originally scheduled due date. (T-1). This is
  necessary to minimize the administrative and logistical burden of performing PHAs at
  locations without local AF MTF FHME assets.
  2.1.8. PHA and deployments. PHAs do not need to be accomplished on deploying Airmen
  as long as the PHA is current (within 365 days of the last recorded PHA) on the projected
  deploy date. (T-1).
     2.1.8.1. During deployments, Airmen will not be monitored for PHA currency and will
     be considered exempt from PHA requirements. (T-2).
AFI44-170 30 JANUARY 2014                                                                  11


         2.1.8.1.1. Although Airmen will not be monitored for PHA/OEH MSE/FOMEs while
         deployed, Airmen should not deploy with due/overdue examinations, IMR
         requirements, or other requirements for these programs. Every effort will be made to
         conduct prior to deployment. (T-2).
         2.1.8.1.2. Upon redeployment, Airmen will be required to update their due/overdue
         PHA/OEH MSE/FOMEs within 90 days of return. (T-2).
      2.1.8.2. If the AF Form 1042 is due to expire during the deployment, the home station
      FOMC will accomplish a new AF Form 1042 with the extended expiration date
      (redeployment date plus 90 days). (T-2).
         2.1.8.2.1. If the AF Form 1042 holders have a waiver that will expire during the
         deployment, the home station FOMC will request a waiver extension through the
         granting waiver authority. ANG members will ensure fly waivers are current
         throughout the deployment. (T-2). Note: The waiver authority may grant the waiver
         extension to be concurrent with the AF Form 1042 (redeployment date plus 90 days)
         unless health, safety and/or mission completion would be compromised.
      2.1.8.3. For OEH MSEs that will become due or overdue during deployment, FHME will
      make every effort to conduct prior to deployment IAW AFI 48-145, Occupational and
      Environmental Health Program. If not completed, document the reason why it was not
      accomplished in the medical record (AHLTA preferably). (T-1). Exception: IAW
      OSHA standards OEH MSEs must be current throughout the deployment for civilian
      deployers. (T-0).
2.2. PHA Requirements.
   2.2.1. IAW HA Policy Memo 06-006 completion of the AF Web HA, a self-report health
   status tool. (T-0).
      2.2.1.1. For deployers, DHA 1, DHA 2, and/or DHA 3 could be used in place of the AF
      Web HA as the patient self-report health status tool if completed within 60 days of the
      PHA Cell appointment. Note: An interval history will still need to be accomplished and
      ASIMS updated. (T-2).
      2.2.1.2. The AF Web HA must be completed no earlier than 60 days prior to the PHA
      Cell/FOMC appointment. ARC members will have the Web HA complete prior to PHA
      appointment. Note: PRP/BPRP/PSP personnel are required to complete the AF Web HA
      at an MTF computer with results immediately reviewed and addressed by a CMA. All
      other Airmen are strongly encouraged to complete the AF Web HA prior to coming to the
      MTF for their PHA appointment. (T-1).
      2.2.1.3. PHA Cell/FOMC technicians (hereafter referred to collectively as technicians)
      will check the AF Web HA “Multiple Patient Report” throughout the duty day for all
      Critical, Priority, and Routine findings from their respective empaneled population. (T-
      1). These findings will be managed in the following manner: Note: See 2.3.9. for ARC
      members.
         2.2.1.3.1. All Critical findings must be addressed within one duty day. All Priority
         findings must be addressed within three duty days. (T-1).
12                                                            AFI44-170 30 JANUARY 2014


         2.2.1.3.2. Technicians will initiate the telephone consult in AHLTA for Critical and
         Priority findings; flag it as “high priority” and immediately forward it to the
         members’ patient care team for review. (T-1).
         2.2.1.3.3. The patient care team nurse (or ARC health technician) will review all
         “high priority” flagged PHA telephone consults, contact the member within in the
         specified timeframe to obtain clinically relevant information via either telephone or
         an in-person visit, as well as document the encounter in AHLTA or paper record if
         AHLTA is unavailable. All attempts at patient contact will be documented in
         AHLTA or paper record if AHLTA is unavailable. The patient care team nurse will
         forward telephone consults to the provider (or surrogate) for final review, disposition,
         and signature. Note: The date/time the Airman electronically submits his/her AF
         Web HA and the date/time the patient care team provider signs the “high priority”
         PHA telephone consult will be used to determine one- and three-duty day suspense
         compliances for Critical and Priority findings respectfully. (T-1).
         2.2.1.3.4. Once Critical and Priority findings have been appropriately addressed, the
         balance of AF Web HA results and the other PHA (or FOME) requirements may be
         accomplished at that time (or an appointment made) and completed at a later time.
         Future follow up appointments should not preclude the closing out of the member’s
         PHA.
         2.2.1.3.5. PHAs with Routine AF Web HA findings will undergo a records review to
         determine the need for further follow up/tests and referral to the members’ respective
         patient care team via standard appointing systems. (T-1).
  2.2.2. Technicians will review ASIMS for all due or overdue IMR requirements and direct
  the member to the appropriate clinic/laboratory to complete any requirements. (T-2).
  2.2.3. Technicians will conduct a thorough health record review using the medical record
  (AHLTA and paper record if AHLTA is not available) for interval medical and surgical
  history, family history, and currency of clinical preventive services since the members’ last
  PHA. (T-2).
  2.2.4. Technicians will identify age and gender specific CPS as directed by the PHA
  business rules, and document the recommended offerings on the appropriate PHA AHLTA
  template or paper record if AHLTA is not available. (T-2).
     2.2.4.1. The patient care team is responsible for follow-up of any PHA Cell scheduled
     services.
     2.2.4.2. The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) Guide to Clinical
     Preventive Services is the main source of guidance for CPS and located at
     http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/.
  2.2.5. Technicians will ensure there has been an officially measured blood pressure (i.e.,
  medical or dental clinic) within the last 12 months (ANG, within 5 years and AFR, every 3
  years). As needed, the technician will accomplish and record blood pressure measurements.
  (T-1). Note: Business rules for blood pressure screening and managing elevated blood
  pressures are based on the most recent Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection,
AFI44-170 30 JANUARY 2014                                                                   13


  Evaluation,    and      Treatment      of     High      Blood           Pressure      Report
  (http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/hypertension/index.htm).
  2.2.6. Technicians will ensure there has been an officially measured weight and officially
  measured height within the last 12 months (ANG, within 5 years and AFR, every 3 years).
  Official measurements are limited to clinic- and fitness assessment cell-obtained
  measurements. Self-reported heights and weights will not be used. As required, technicians
  will measure and record the Airman’s height and/or weight. (T-1).
  2.2.7. Body Mass Index (BMI) is automatically calculated in ASIMS and results will be
  manually transcribed into AHLTA. BMIs will be managed according to PHA business rules.
  (T-2).
  2.2.8. For all ANG members, visual acuity is required every year for flyers and every five
  years for non-flyers. (T-2).
  2.2.9. Technicians will, regarding identified health risks, recommend clinical services, IMR
  requirements, DLC actions, Review in Lieu of (RILO) actions, Fit for Duty (FFD)
  determinations, and/or appropriate clinical follow-ups IAW ASIMS/AF Web HA guidance,
  the PHA Guide, and other relevant instructions. (T-2). Note: Records requiring further
  evaluation for mobility or duty restricting limitations (e.g., duty-limiting conditions >365
  days that do not affect mobility) will be referred to the MSME. Duties in this regard will be
  limited to distributing AFMOA- or ECOMS-approved, PHA-related, patient education
  handouts. The “Full Patient Report” generated at the end of the AF Web HA will provide
  Airmen with health education for specific identified risks.
  2.2.10. When annual OEH MSE requirements are conducted in conjunction with the PHA
  (as locally determined), technicians will review ASIMS as part of the PHA health records
  review. (T-2). If OEH MSEs are to be performed in conjunction with PHAs and OEH MSE
  requirements preclude PHA intervals greater than 12 months then PHAs may be performed
  earlier than prescribed to accommodate these requirements.
  2.2.11. The PHA portion of the FOME for aviators, Airmen on aeronautical orders, and
  special operational duty personnel must include an in-person interview with a credentialed
  military flight surgeon with privileges in the FOMC. (T-1). If the PHA is performed by a
  non-AF flight surgeon (e.g., Navy, Army, or Coast Guard flight surgeons), it requires review
  and certification by a base-, GMU-, or RMU-level SGP or, if unavailable, parent
  MAJCOM/SGP.
  2.2.12. The patient care team will use ASIMS and the AF Web HA “AHLTA Copy and
  Paste report” (or paper copy if AHLTA unavailable) to assess cardiovascular risk in Airmen
  and counsel them, as needed, to minimize this risk. (T-1). This assessment will be
  documented by the patient care team in the medical record (paper copy or AHLTA). The
  Cardiovascular       Risk      Assessment      and      Management        (CRAM)       site
  (https://kx2.afms.mil/kj/kx8/CRAM/Pages/home.aspx) can assist providers in appropriately
  assessing and calculating cardiac risk. Note: Not applicable for the ANG.
  2.2.13. The patient care teams (or their surrogates) must re-validate and renew or revise, as
  appropriate, the AF Form 469 at each PHA at a minimum IAW AFI10-203. (T-1). The
  medical record and interval history must be reviewed for conditions that may require an AF
  Form 469. This review will be documented in the medical record.
14                                                             AFI44-170 30 JANUARY 2014


  2.2.14. As part of the PHA, Airmen will be medically evaluated for clearance to participate
  in a physical fitness-training program to meet fitness requirements IAW AFI 36-2905,
  Fitness Program. This does not replace screening requirements prior to official fitness
  assessments. Airmen unable to participate in physical activity sufficient to train to meet
  fitness requirements should be issued an AF Form 469, with activity restrictions. (T-2).
  2.2.15. Airmen who have had an MEB (or FFD) and require subsequent RILOs will have
  their RILO timelines reviewed by their patient care team during their PHA and as a part of
  the health records review. While annual RILOs should be coordinated (synchronized) with
  the annual PHA, the patient care team (or surrogate) must ensure that RILO suspenses are
  met regardless of an Airman's PHA timeline. Annual RILOs will be coordinated with the
  MTF Physical Evaluation Board Liaison Officer (PEBLO) and forwarded to AFPC or ARC
  HQ IAW AFI 41-210. (T-2).
  2.2.16. The PHA is “complete” for reporting purposes when the following are accomplished:
     2.2.16.1. AHLTA and/or paper medical record review have been completed.
     2.2.16.2. The Airman’s patient care team (or surrogate) has addressed AF Web HA
     results including all Critical and Priority findings, and has made definitive care plans and
     dispositions (referral, appointment, etc.) pertaining to these responses. (T-1).
     2.2.16.3. Face-to-face provider visit, if required by 2.1.6., has occurred.
     2.2.16.4. CPSs recommended and offered, education and counseling have been
     scheduled, and referrals placed (e.g., referral to non-military provider, specialty clinic,
     HAWC, etc.). ARC medical components will document when ARC Airmen are advised
     to see their non-military patient care team for CPS (ref. 2.3.2.2.). (T-2).
     2.2.16.5. Required documentation accomplished by technician and the patient care team
     (ref. 2.2.16.).
     2.2.16.6. The provider has reviewed and signed the PHA, including the PHA AHLTA
     note. For ANG, qualified health technicians can sign the Web HA with no
     critical/priority findings and the member has no other PHA requirements. (T-2).
     2.2.16.7. The PHA AHLTA note has been accurately coded. PHAs not requiring a face-
     to-face provider visit should normally be coded with evaluation and management (E/M)
     code 99420 (0.24 relative value units). PHAs in conjunction with MEBs and RILOs may
     require E/M disability exam codes. ARC medical units are not required to code PHA
     visits. (T-2).
     2.2.16.8. For personnel requiring the AF Form 1042, it has been completed and recorded
     in ASIMS at the same time as the PHA.
     2.2.16.9. Provider has made a DLC determination, or initiated a diagnostic work-up, if
     appropriate and/or RILO or FFD actions have been completed. (T-2).
     2.2.16.10. The PHA completion date has been recorded in ASIMS by the patient care
     team, if completing the PHA, or PHA Cell, if completing the PHA. (T-2).
     2.2.16.11. CPS      results,  including     laboratory    results    and     completed
     educational/counseling programs (e.g., tobacco cessation programs), are not required to
     complete a PHA for ASIMS and unit reporting purposes.
AFI44-170 30 JANUARY 2014                                                                  15


      2.2.16.12. Concerns regarding worldwide duty qualifications should be addressed with
      an AF Form 469 and not delay PHA completion.
   2.2.17. Required PHA Documentation.
      2.2.17.1. Summary of care note in AHLTA using AFMOA-approved templates (e.g.,
      Tri-Service Workflow AIM) or paper record if AHLTA is unavailable, appropriately
      coded (if applicable), and signed/co-signed by the Patient Care provider (or surrogate).
      2.2.17.2. PHA completion date and provider visit date (if applicable) recorded in ASIMS
      by PHA Cell or the patient care team, if completing the PHA. (T-2).
      2.2.17.3. Completed AF Form 1042 (for personnel who require it).
      2.2.17.4. Signed AF Form 469, if renewed, modified, or initiated during the PHA. The
      AF Form 422, Notification of Air Force Member’s Qualification Status, is only
      accomplished when needed (overseas clearance, AFSC retraining, etc.). Refer to AFI 10-
      203 for further guidance.
      2.2.17.5. Documentation in AHLTA of clearance to begin or continue exercise program
      and/or completed AF Form 469.
      2.2.17.6. The section conducting the PHA (i.e., PHA Cell or patient care team) will
      update the electronic DD Form 2766, Adult Preventive and Chronic Care Flowsheet,
      IAW AFI 41-210. This update to the DD Form 2766 should include previously
      undocumented significant medical events, allergies, and surgeries in addition to the
      current PHA activities. (T-2).
      2.2.17.7. For ARC, Web HA will be documented in AHLTA or paper record if AHLTA
      is not available. (T-2).
2.3. ARC.
   2.3.1. Reservists and Air Guard members assigned to units with sufficient medical assets
   will receive their PHAs within their own Reserve or Guard units. (T-2).
   2.3.2. When ARC medical resources necessary to complete PHAs are inadequate or
   unavailable, ARC members are eligible for PHAs and other readiness-related evaluations at
   other AF MTFs. (T-2).
      2.3.2.1. ARC members need not be in military status to schedule MTF appointments, but
      must be in military status (active, inactive, or points-only) at the time of the medical
      service. (T-2).
      2.3.2.2. ARC members are instructed to see their non-military patient care team for
      clinical services not covered under these provisions. (T-2).
   2.3.3. ARC members assigned to units without local AF MTF support will complete the AF
   Web HA, will have their responses reviewed by a provider (or a nurse or trained health
   technician for the ANG) and will, at a minimum, be personally contacted to complete the
   PHA process. (T-2).
      2.3.3.1. The person who contacts the Airman (trained health technician, nurse, or
      provider) will be determined by the expertise required by AF Web HA responses.
16                                                           AFI44-170 30 JANUARY 2014


     Positive AF Web HA responses may require additional documentation from their non-
     military patient care team. (T-2).
     2.3.3.2. The ART Team or Health Technicians will oversee the completion of PHAs. (T-
     2).
  2.3.4. The Reserve Health Readiness Program (RHRP) may be used to provide PHA
  services for ARC GSUs and/or units who lack unit medical resources. The RHRP can
  provide these services through a nationwide network of non-military providers. Email
  rhrp@tma.osd.mil       or    see    either   http://rhrp.fhpr.osd.mil/home.aspx    or
  http://www.pdhealth.mil/hss/healthcare_services.asp for further information about the
  RHRP. Note: Group events must be requested and approved through ARC Surgeons
  General OPRs.
  2.3.5. ARC members will have annual PHAs conducted using AFMOA-developed business
  rules. As required, these business rules will be modified to meet special AFR and ANG
  requirements (1.2.7.1.). (T-1).
     2.3.5.1. Reservists will receive PHAs per the latest AFRC/SGP consolidated program
     memorandum located at https://kx2.afms.mil/kj/kx/AFRCAerospaceMed/Pages/home.aspx.
     (T-2).
  2.3.6. ARC units will process PHAs using FHME surrogates detailed in 1.2.18.1. (T-2).
  2.3.7. ARC members not requiring AF Form 1042 will have a face-to-face provider PHA
  appointment at the following minimum frequency: ANG at least every 5 years and AFR at
  least every 3 years. Note: ARC members requiring AF Form 1042 will have a face-to-face
  provider PHA annually in conjunction with their FOME (i.e., flying/special duty physical).
  (T-2).
  2.3.8. ANG officers being considered for promotion to general officer or promotion within
  the general officer ranks must undergo a PHA within 6 months of the recognition board.
  Forward copy of the PHA to: NGB/SGPF GO EAD REVIEW at
  ngb.sggoeadreview@ang.af.mil. (T-1).
  2.3.9. ARC members will be notified of any critical or priority findings at the end of their
  AF Web HA session and will be directed to seek civilian medical care as appropriate. (T-1).
     2.3.9.1. Designated ANG medical personnel will follow-up critical and priority AF Web
     HA results no later than the next Unit Training Assembly (UTA). (T-1).
     2.3.9.2. ART Team will follow up critical findings immediately (until the Reservist is
     contacted) and priority findings within one week (until the Reservist is contacted). All
     attempts to contact the member shall be documented. (T-1).
  2.3.10. The Readiness Management Group (RMG) has administrative control over IMAs
  and compliance oversight. The MTF supporting the IMA’s AD unit of attachment is the
  provider for PHA services and shares responsibility with the RMG for tracking, data entry,
  and compliance. (T-2).
     2.3.10.1. The AD MTF is responsible for AF Form 469/422 actions associated with the
     PHA and the RMG/SG should be notified of all AF Form 469/422 actions through secure
     e-mail (i.e., ASIMS generated or MiCare) at afrc.rmgsg@afrc.af.mil. (T-2).
AFI44-170 30 JANUARY 2014                                                                     17


   2.3.11. Expired PHAs in ARC members.
      2.3.11.1. Reservists with expired PHAs will be referred to their CCs IAW AFI 36-2254
      Vol.1, Reserve Personnel Participation, and processed IAW AFI 36-3209, Separation
      and Retirement Procedures for Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve Members, or
      involuntary transferred to the Individual Ready Reserve in accordance with AFI 36-2115,
      Assignments Within the Reserve Components. (T-2).
      2.3.11.2. ANG members with expired PHAs will be referred to their CC and processed
      IAW AFI 36-3209. (T-2).
      2.3.11.3. ARC members involuntarily ordered to AD will not delay such action because
      of an expired PHA. For those ARC personnel with expired PHAs, PHAs will be
      accomplished within the first 60 days of AD. Members will not deploy with expired
      PHA or IMR requirements per 2.1.8.1.1. (T-2).
   2.3.12. Service members must have a current PHA prior to transfer to an ARC unit. The
   PHA must remain current for the first 90 days upon accession to the ARC unit. Prior to
   accession to ARC, service members with potentially disqualifying conditions IAW 48-123,
   must be evaluated for fitness for duty (IRILO or MEB). (T-2).
2.4. PHAs for Geographically Separated Airmen.
   2.4.1. Geographically separated Airmen are Airmen not collocated on the same installation
   nor enrolled to the MTF that administers their PHA (the “Reporting MTF”, see 2.4.2.1.
   below). MAJCOM/DRU CCs and unit CCs (if applicable) must ensure their geographically
   separated Airmen receive an annual PHA. (T-1).
   2.4.2. Definitions of Reporting and Supporting MTFs.
      2.4.2.1. “Reporting” MTFs are the MTFs accountable to MAJCOM/DRUs for PHA
      reporting and tracking purposes, and are usually collocated on the same installation as the
      MAJCOM/DRU. Reporting MTFs provide due/overdue PHA rosters to MAJCOM/DRU
      CCs and oversee PHA processing for geographically separated Airmen.
      2.4.2.2. “Supporting” MTFs are DoD and non-DoD MTFs providing healthcare services
      to geographically separated Airmen. These supporting MTFs include, but are not limited
      to, DoD MTFs (AF, Army, or Navy), and, where no DoD MTF exists, approved
      TRICARE service providers such as U.S. State Department medical facilities and non-
      military providers.
   2.4.3. Geographically separated Airmen with local supporting AF MTFs.
      2.4.3.1. Geographically separated Airmen collocated with or near supporting AF MTFs
      (as determined by MAJCOM/DRU and supporting MTFs) will follow standard PHA
      instructions and procedures, and receive PHAs and follow-up care at these MTFs. (T-1).
      2.4.3.2. Reporting MTF PHA Cells/FOMCs will coordinate with supporting AF MTF
      PHA Cells/FOMCs to administer and execute PHAs for geographically separated
      Airmen. (T-1).
   2.4.4. Geographically separated Airmen at locations without local AF MTF support but
   supported by Independent Duty Medical Technicians (IDMTs). (T-1).
18                                                           AFI44-170 30 JANUARY 2014


     2.4.4.1. PHA processes shall be directed by the designated IDMT physician preceptor
     and administered by the technician at the physician preceptor’s assigned MTF. (T-1).
     2.4.4.2. PRP/BPRP/PSP at IDMT-staffed GSUs.
        2.4.4.2.1. At GSUs with a PRP/BPRP/PSP mission where the medical support is
        provided by AD IDMTs, the IDMTs may facilitate the gathering of PHA information
        but the PHA provider for PRP/BPRP/PSP personnel will be a CMA. (T-1).
        2.4.4.2.2. At GSUs where the CMA is not collocated with the PRP/BPRP/PSP
        personnel, the CMA will remotely review PHA results while the Airman waits at the
        GSU medical facility. (T-1).
        2.4.4.2.3. If the remote CMA review cannot be accomplished at the time of the
        Airman’s PHA appointment, the Airman will be suspended from their
        PRP/BPRP/PSP duties until PHA results are reviewed by the CMA. (T-1).
  2.4.5. Geographically separated Airmen at locations without local AF MTF or IDMT
  support.
     2.4.5.1. PHA completion will be monitored and overseen by the GSU AF CC (or
     equivalent) in coordination with the reporting MTF PHA Cell/FOMC. In situations
     where no GSU AF CC (or equivalent) exists, the reporting MTF PHA Cell/FOMC will
     monitor and oversee PHA completion. (T-1).
     2.4.5.2. After completing the AF Web HA, geographically separated Airmen without
     local AF MTF or IDMT support will, at a minimum, be contacted (preferably by phone
     or video link) by the reporting MTF to review AF Web HA responses, and provide and
     document appropriate counseling and education. The MTF should develop a process to
     maximize efficiency in facilitating GSU PHA completion to reduce repeat phone calls.
     The SGP and SGH shall identify workflow processes to complete GSU PHAs at the
     appropriate level of care based on ASIMS and AF Web HA reports (e.g., critical and
     priority responses will be addressed by a credentialed privileged provider, and preventive
     counseling based on AFMOA- and ECOMS-approved patient education IAW CFETP).
     (T-1).
     2.4.5.3. Clinical PHA services, counseling, and follow-up care will be scheduled by the
     member or their appointed UHM and be performed at the local supporting non-AF MTF.
     Some cases (e.g., critical and priority results) will require the reporting MTF PHA
     personnel to confer directly with medical personnel at the supporting MTF to
     appropriately transfer care and schedule needed services. The reporting MTF SGP will
     ensure all care provided by the supporting MTF involving critical and priority AF Web
     HA responses is reviewed with supporting non-AF MTF personnel within the required
     time suspenses to ensure appropriateness of care and disposition. See paragraph 2.3.9.
     for ARC management of critical and priority responses. (T-1).
     2.4.5.4. FFD and other military-related medical determinations will be made remotely by
     the reporting MTF SGP as clinically and administratively appropriate. If this cannot be
     done, the reporting MTF SGP, with cooperation and assistance of supporting MAJCOM
     assets (e.g., PACAF, USAFE), will arrange for this determination to be made at a
     regional DoD MTF. (T-1).
AFI44-170 30 JANUARY 2014                                                                  19


      2.4.5.5. The Airman will request that documentation of services provided by the
      supporting MTF be forwarded (faxed, emailed, or mailed) to the reporting MTF PHA
      Cell/FOMC for entry into AHLTA and ASIMS. Additionally, upon PCS from a
      geographically separated location to an AF installation, in-processing will involve a
      thorough health record review to ensure pertinent interval care (including PHAs and
      related services) is entered into AHLTA and ASIMS. (T-1).
      2.4.5.6. The reporting MTF SGP or designee has final signature authority on PHAs
      performed at non-AF MTFs. Documentation necessary to complete PHAs for
      geographically separated Airmen is the same as those listed in 2.2.16. (T-1).
      2.4.5.7. In lieu of the remote processes detailed in this section, MTF CCs may choose to
      periodically send or permanently assign appropriate personnel (providers, technicians,
      etc.) to larger GSUs to administer PHAs.
   2.4.6. In areas where multiple DoD MTFs are located near one another (e.g., the National
   Capital Region); Airmen may be TRICARE-enrolled at nearby MTFs other than the
   reporting MTF responsible for administering their PHA. The reporting MTF is still
   responsible for ensuring these Airmen receive annual PHAs and track compliance. MTFs
   must develop local instructions and procedures to meet these requirements. Options include,
   but are not limited to, directing these Airmen back to the reporting MTF to accomplish the
   PHA, accomplishing these PHAs as “geographically separated PHAs” as defined in this
   section, or developing other processes and standing agreements with nearby DoD MTFs to
   accomplish these tasks.
2.5. Support for Sister Service Members’ PHAs.
   2.5.1. AF MTFs supporting Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard PHA requirements
   will coordinate with applicable Sister Services’ unit administrative or personnel support
   offices to develop standardized PHA processes specifying requirements, notification and
   scheduling procedures, and required documentation. (T-1).
   2.5.2. Sister Service PHAs will be administered by PHA Cell or FOMC, as appropriate.
   PHAs administered by PHA Cell will be referred to their patient care team (or surrogate) as
   directed by locally developed processes. (T-1).
   2.5.3. AFMOA/SGPM (via the Kx) will serve as a repository for Sister Service-specific
   forms, instructions, guidance, and expertise. (T-1).
