     and first or emergency responders.
     3.2. The installation Command Post (CP) is the primary command and control function for
     initial installation notification and warning. Additional information and updates during a
     response and recovery from an emergency will be provided by fire dispatch, the BDOC, and
     the EOC. The CP will execute emergency recalls as prescribed by functional guidance and
     AFI 10-2501 as supplemented using At Hoc. 92 CES/CEXM will provide rosters to the CP
     for EOC recalls.
FAIRCHILDAFBI10-2501 3 DECEMBER 2013                                                           7


  3.3. The EOC is the command and control function for all base response and recovery once
  recalled. The EOC may be used by or augmented with local responders and emergency
  management personnel as needed.
     3.3.1. During normal duty hours, the EOC is considered to be in a “warm” status. This
     can quickly be raised to a “partial” level of recall, including a “monitor” status, when
     formal tracking of an incident begins. A “full” recall may be requested by the Incident
     Commander or EOC Director.
     3.3.2. The primary facility layout will comply with unified facilities criteria. This
     includes an EOC Operations room for the EOC Director, the Operations section and key
     staff, with work centers in separate rooms for Logistics and Planning Sections as well as
     additional office space for the EOC Director, administrative support, and classified
     communications.
  3.4. EOC members will be trained and appointed in accordance with AFI 10-2501 as
  supplemented and this publication. Commanders and the Director of Staff will equip EOC
  members with tools required for an effective and efficient response and recovery. These
  include, but are not limited to, a method of direct recall (phones or other electronic device),
  functional reference material, and copies of checklists supporting the EOC Director’s
  checklist. These checklists will be reviewed by the EOC Manager (CES/CEXM) before
  implementation as required by AFI 10-2501.
  3.5. 92 ARW/CC or MSG/CC, acting as the EOC Director, will recall the EOC. This should
  be done only after consulting with the Incident Commander in order to establish the correct
  level of recall (see Fairchild AFB EOC Activation Guide) and to ensure EOC members have
  a safe route of travel to either the primary or alternate EOC. EOC members will respond
  safely but quickly once recalled and sign in with the EOC Manager.
  3.6. The EOC will be organized in accordance with AFI 10-2501 as supplemented and the
  AMC and Fairchild AFB EOC Guides. Once recalled, EOC organizational representatives
  are under operational control of the EOC Director.
  3.7. Office of Primary Responsibilities will report directly to the ICS Support Section Chiefs
  which are: Finance/Administration, Operations, Logistics and Planning. Incident Command
  System (ICS) Support Section Chiefs will report to the EOC Director but will keep open and
  continuous lines of communication with the on scene incident command staff they are
  supporting, their respective units of assignment, and each other. EOC Director’s staff will
  report to the Executive Officer. See Figure 3.1.

        FOR DISEASE CONTAINMENT
     3.8. Checklists are provided to the EOC Director, ICS Support Section Chiefs and other key
     staff. ESF members are required to develop supporting checklists for detailed actions as
     required by AFI 10-2501 as supplemented and the IEMP 10-2.
     3.9. The EOC will not be fully demobilized until the ICS Support Section Chiefs and the
     EOC Director agree that further recovery actions would be more effectively accomplished
     from members’ normal duty sections. The EOC Director may partially demobilize the EOC
     at any time
