                                          Chapter 1

                                TRAINING MANAGEMENT

1.1. Scope. This chapter identifies the purpose and training objectives of the Air National
Guard (ANG). These objectives apply to all ANG members (traditional guardsmen, air
technicians, active guard reservists and statutory tour) and comply with National Defense
strategy, Federal statutes (Title 10 U.S.C., § 101, 32 U.S.C. §§ 316, 502, 503, 504 or 505),
Department of Defense (DoD) and National Guard Bureau (NGB) policy. ANG is responsible
for implementing and administering approved NGB policies for the ANG. The OPR for training
management, requirements forecasting, goals and objectives is NGB/A1.
1.2. Purpose. To provide training in compliance with Titles 10, 32 and 37 of the United States
Code; DoD directives and memoranda; ANGI 65-101, Air National Guard Workday Accounting
and Reporting Procedures. DoDI 1215.13 policy requires establishment of training programs
that provide a minimum number of inactive duty training periods (IDT), and active duty training
(ADT) required for attaining the prescribed unit readiness status and maintaining individual
proficiency. Due to the high visibility of the training program, state headquarters, commanders
and unit training managers must ensure proper internal controls, resource management, and
documentation prescribed by this instruction is accomplished.
1.3. Terms Explained. DoDI 1215.06, Para 6.1.4.1.3 defines Other Training Duty (OTD) as
applicable to the reserve components and encompasses all reserve component training and states
that non-technician personnel will receive priority consideration for such training. When
performing training or support duty, all ANG members shall be on IDT, ADT, or full-time
National Guard duty (FTNGD) status. For the purpose of this instruction the following terms
apply (see chapters 4 through 9 for ANG specific terms):

Table 1.1. Acronyms & Definitions (IAW DoDD 1215. 06, 7 February 2007).
AD        Active duty - Full-time duty in the active military service of the United States It
          includes full-time training duty, annual training duty, and attendance, while in active
          military service, at a school designated as a Service school by law and the Secretary
          for the Military Department concerned. It does not include full-time National Guard
          duty. For the Reserve Components (RC), AD is comprised of the categories ADT and
          ADOT.
ADT       Active Duty for Training – A category of AD used to provide structured individual
          and/or unit training, or educational courses to RC members. Included in the ADT
          category are AT, IADT, and OTD. The primary purpose of ADT is to provide
          individual and/or unit readiness training. Support to mission requirements, i.e.,
          operational support, may occur as a consequence of performing ADT.
ADOT      Active Duty for Other than for Training - Active duty to support active component or
          reserve component missions. It includes the categories of ADOS (formerly active
          duty for special work (ADSW)), AGR duty and involuntary AD IAW 10 U.S.C. Secs.
          12301, 12302, and 12304. Training may occur in the conduct of ADOT.

FTNGD Full-Time National Guard Duty - Training or other duty, other than inactive duty,
      performed by a member of the ANG in a member’s status as a member of the
      National Guard of a State or territory, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or the
      District of Columbia as described in 10 USC § 101(d)(5). FTNGD is active service
      IAW 10 USC § 101(d)(3).
IDT   Inactive Duty for Training (IDT). Authorized training performed by members of an
      RC not on AD, and performed in connection with the prescribed activities of the TRC,
      of which they are a member. It consists of regularly scheduled unit training periods,
      ATPs, and equivalent training as defined in DoDI 1215.06. The primary purpose of
      IDT is to provide individual and/or unit readiness training. Support to mission
      requirements, i.e., operational support, may occur as a consequence of performing
      IDT. IDT also encompasses muster duty, in the performance of the annual screening
      program.
IADT  Initial Active Duty Training (IADT). Training that provides basic military training
      and technical skill training required for all enlisted accessions. IADT is always done
      in a Title 10, Federal Status.
MPA   Military Personnel Appropriations (MPA) man-days. MPA man-days provided by
      active AF organizations to support active duty missions accomplished by ANG
      members. These are active duty workdays (10 USC § 12301(d)). These training
      periods may satisfy the requirement for an ANG member to perform 15 days of active
      service for training if the duty is directly related to the member's specialty training.
      For specific MPA guidance see AFI 36-2619, Military Personnel Appropriation Man-
      Day Program.
AGR   Active Guard and Reserve Duty (AGR). AD performed by a member of an RC, or
      FTNGD performed by a member of the National Guard under an order to AD or
      FTNGD for a period of 180 consecutive days or more for organizing, administering,
      recruiting, instructing, or training the RCs. Personnel performing such duty are
      included in the Full Time Support numbers for each RC under the collective title of
      AGR.

   1.4.2. Federal. To develop, maintain, and provide the Air Force with operationally ready
   units to augment the Active Air Force whenever necessary, and support DoD peacetime or
   contingency operations.
1.5. Channels of Communication. Official communications that relate to training will
normally be forwarded from the unit training manager to NGB/A1Y. Policy review actions will
be submitted through more formal channels consistent with local policy, but must be coordinated
with the Adjutant General prior to submission to the National Guard Bureau or the Air National
Guard Readiness Center.
1.6. Training Objectives. The objectives of training are:
   1.6.1. To provide educational opportunities that enhance the ability of units to successfully
   execute tasked missions when called upon in peacetime or war. Specific focus must be on
   developing leadership, mental attitude, and the job knowledge required to transition from
   peacetime duties to wartime duties.
       1.6.1.1. To provide timely training opportunities to members allowing full qualification
       in the authorized grade and position to which they are assigned.
       1.6.1.2. To reduce organizational risk through training that advocates safety, asset
       protection and resource optimization.
1.7. Training Responsibilities.
   1.7.1. State Responsibilities - The Constitution and Federal law states that training of the
   ANG is conducted under the command of State authorities. Such training will be conducted
   as prescribed by ANG commanders in accordance with ANG directives; applicable Air Force
8                                                           ANGI36-2001 19 OCTOBER 2009


    gaining command training policies, standards, and programs; and as directed by the state
    adjutants general.
       1.7.1.1. The adjutant general is responsible for overseeing training participation within
       their respective state.
    1.7.2. Wing/Unit Responsibilities - The highest ANG command level on base is responsible
    for developing and overseeing a training plan for all areas required by its subordinate units.
    The unit commander is ultimately responsible for ensuring all members are trained to the
    degree and in the manner required to accomplish the assigned mission.
       1.7.2.1. The systematic accomplishment of training during the limited training time
       available necessitates the development and publication of a master unit training plan.
       This training plan will be accomplished by each unit on, or assigned to, the installation.
       1.7.2.2. Training administrators must be appointed to assume responsibility for the
       accomplishment of training objectives, both ancillary and skill level in nature, for all
       members of their sections. They will prepare and publish a monthly training program for
       their sections indicating planned training of individuals in general military and specific
       operations areas.
    1.7.3. Supervisor/Section Responsibilities – In accordance with the training criteria
    established by the Chief of Staff, USAF, each gaining MAJCOM is responsible for the
    inspection and evaluation of training of the ANG within their command. Operational
    readiness inspections and Quality Air Force Assessments conducted by MAJCOMs and
    numbered Air Forces are used to determine the effectiveness of each unit's training program.
1.8. Training Authorization. Authorization of pay, entitlement to retirement points, and any
claim or benefit that may arise as a result of military service requires documentary evidence that
the member was in a duty status and performed such duty as authorized by Federal law or
regulation. Unit commanders will issue written authorization governing training, in a pay or
non-pay status, in advance of such training. Commanders must pay particular attention to
ensuring appropriate internal controls are in place to monitor authorization, certification and
documentation in the execution of the workday program.
    1.8.1. Written authorization may contain the schedule of training for the entire organization,
    subordinate elements, or individual members. AF Form 40, Authorization for Inactive Duty
    for Training; NGB Form 105M, Authorization for Inactive Duty Training; NGB Form 105S,
    Authorization for Individual Inactive Duty Training; NGB Form 633, Unit Training
    Assembly Attendance Roster; or authorized substitute, may be used to satisfy this
    requirement, where feasible.
    1.8.2. No member will be scheduled for training that will enable him or her to perform or be
    paid for duty performed in excess of the equivalent of 360 active service training days in any
    fiscal year. The performance of inactive duty does not count toward this limitation. (DoD
    7000.14R Vol 7A) A combined total of no more than 75 IDT retirement points for UTAs,
    correspondence courses, and membership points can be credited for members whose
    Retention/Retirement (R/R) year ends on or after 23 September 1996. For members whose
    R/R year ends prior to 23 September 1996 no more than 60 IDT retirement points may be
    credited. Award a year of satisfactory service for retirement when a member earns a
    minimum of 50 points (including membership points) in their full R/R year.
ANGI36-2001 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                                     9


   1.8.3. Non-prior service members are not authorized to participate in any training other than
   unit training assemblies prior to completion of initial active duty.
   1.8.4. AD Points. May be earned for serving on AD during any authorized period of
   training.
   1.8.5. IDT Points. May be earned for performing duties during a UTA, RUTA, SUTA, PT,
   TPPA, or AFTP.
   1.8.6. ECI Points. May be earned through correspondence courses or PME.
   1.8.7. Points will not be awarded for social functions, attending sporting events, attending
   meetings of the Air Force Association, National Guard Association of the United States, and
   other such organizations.
   1.8.8. Point Data. HQ ARPC keeps point data for each member on a computer record and
   on microfilm. Unit MPFs maintain a hard copy in the member’s records.
   1.8.9. Points. The number of points earned performing duty determines the member’s
   eligibility for retirement. One point is awarded for each day of active duty. Award one point
   for each UTA period of 4 hours, not to exceed 2 points per calendar day. ECI determines the
   number of study hours awarded for correspondence courses or PME. Each member will
   receive up to 15 membership points per year while an active guard member and a satisfactory
   participant.
   1.8.10. Training administration includes identification of training deficiencies at member,
   unit and organizational levels. Unit commanders have a responsibility to initiate corrective
   action as soon as possible to minimize negative mission impact.
   1.8.11. If a training deficiency cannot be resolved at the unit, wing or state level, notify
   NGB/A1F through the chain of command of the deficiency, the impact on the mission and
   any potential solutions that have been identified.
1.9. Record of Attendance. Although supervisors must maintain training records, it is
ultimately the member’s responsibility to ensure participation in any type of training is properly
recorded for attendance, pay and/or benefit purposes.
1.10. Satisfactory Participation. Each member must ensure that all training requirements are
met to achieve and maintain the appropriate competency and skill level commensurate with their
grade and position. A unit member is responsible for contacting their unit commander, or
supervisor, as soon as the member becomes aware that he/she will not be able to attend any
scheduled period of duty. Each member is also responsible for maintaining their current address
and telephone number with the unit, the Military Personnel Flight (MPF) and Finance.
1.11. Unsatisfactory Participation. Unsatisfactory participation is defined as failure to meet
mission requirements in established guidance. Failure to meet these requirements will lead to
separation actions IAW AFI 36-3209, Separation Procedures for Air National Guard and Air
Force Reserve Personnel.
1.12. Non-pay Status. Except for pay and allowances, a member in this status is entitled to the
same benefits as if he or she were in a pay status. Duty without pay shall be considered for all
purposes as if it were duty with pay (10 U.S.C. §§ 12315 and 101(d)(5), and 32 U.S.C. § 502
(f)(2)).
10                                                            ANGI36-2001 19 OCTOBER 2009


     1.12.1. Participation in training without pay with the member’s consent is authorized when
     ordered in writing by the unit commander to participate in such training.
     1.12.2. When a traditional guardsman requires medical or dental care for a duty related
     illness or injury, place the individual in this status (Line Of Duty determination must be made
     IAW AFI 36-2910). Source of care may be a civilian or military provider.
     1.12.3. Traditional Guard members may perform pay and non-pay status duty via
     telecommuting. Guidance is provided in ANGI 36-8001, Air National Guard Traditional
     Guard Member Telecommuting Policy.
1.13. Organization and Equipment for Training. The organization of the ANG units and
required authorizations for equipment will be in accordance with the appropriate ANG unit
manpower document (UMD), and the United States Air Force Table of Allowances (TA).
1.14. Standards and Requirements. Members must meet the following requirements when
performing any type of duty. Failure to meet these standards could result in denial of pay and
points by the commander:
     1.14.1. Dress and appearance standards of AFI 36-2903, Dress and Appearance of
     Personnel.
     1.14.2. Physical fitness requirements outlined in ANGI 10-248, Air National Guard Fitness

ANGI36-2001 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                                   11


                                          Chapter 2

                               THE WORKDAY PROGRAM

2.1. Purpose. The ANG workday program is designed to forecast requirements, allocate
resources, and maintain an audit trail of resources expended. Internal controls must be
maintained to ensure personnel are performing training in their assigned CAFSC/DAFSC and
workdays are expended appropriately and judiciously.
2.2. Categories of Workdays:
   2.2.1. Active Service (AS). An AS day is normally a minimum of 8 hours and accrues
   retirement points at the rate of no more than one point per day. AS includes the various
   forms of Active Duty (AD) and Full-Time National Guard Duty (FTNGD).
      2.2.1.1. Annual Training (AT). The primary purpose of AT is to provide individual
      and/or unit readiness training. Support to mission requirements, i.e., operational support,
      may occur as a consequence of performing ADT. May be performed in either Title 32
      (State) or Title 10 (Federal) status. See chapter 3.
      2.2.1.2. Special Training (ST). Workdays allocated to accomplish training that cannot be
      achieved during AT or UTAs. May be performed in either Title 32 (State) or Title 10
      (Federal) status. See chapter 4.
      2.2.1.3. Active Duty for Operational Support (ADOS) (Formerly Active Duty for Special
      Work (ADSW)). Authorized voluntary AD for RC personnel funded through applicable
      military or Reserve personnel appropriations (ADOS-AC funded or ADOS-RC funded)
      to support AC or RC programs, respectively. The purpose of ADOS is to provide the
      necessary skilled manpower assets to support existing or emerging requirements.
      Authorization of ADOS shall be managed pursuant to Issuances established by the
      Secretary concerned. To assist the Military Departments in managing ADOS tours, the
      following criteria are provided. See chapter 4.
      2.2.1.4. Formal School Training (FST). Workdays for all officer and prior service
      enlisted school training. May be performed in either Title 32 (State) or Title 10 (Federal)
      status. See chapter 5.
      2.2.1.5. Basic Military Training (BMT). Workdays performed by non-prior service
      members to attend initial active duty for Training (IADT) in Title 10 (Federal) status.
      These workdays are centrally managed by NGB/FM and are not allocated on the unit
      workday document.
      2.2.1.6. Temporary AGR. Workdays are not currently allocated on the unit workday
      document for temporary AGR tours.
   2.2.2. Inactive Duty for Training (IDT). Inactive duty training periods, normally a minimum
   of 4 hours and accrues one retirement point per inactive duty period, not to exceed two points
   per calendar day.
      2.2.2.1. Unit Training Assemblies (UTAs). Drill periods will normally consist of 4
      hours each. Normally four UTAs are scheduled on one weekend each month. See
      chapter 6.
12                                                          ANGI36-2001 19 OCTOBER 2009


        2.2.2.2. Proficiency Training (PT). A training period not less than 4 hours that is
        performed in addition to scheduled UTAs. See chapter 7.
        2.2.2.3. Training Period Preparation Assemblies (TPPA). A period of not less than 4
        hours used by selected individuals in the preparation for scheduled UTAs. See chapter 8.
        2.2.2.4. Additional Flying Training Period (AFTP). A minimum 4-hour training period
        available only to aircrew members used to achieve flying proficiency and related ground-
        training activities. See chapter 9.
2.3. Policies and Procedures:
     2.3.1. Training Authority. The Chief, NGB will issue the basic authority for members of
     ANG units to participate in training activities. The issuance of workday allocation
     documents constitutes authority for commanders to publish necessary orders for active
     service and to authorize inactive duty.
     2.3.2. The ANG workday program can only be used to meet bona fide training requirements
     and/or validated training support needs. Workdays cannot be used to circumvent manning
     limitations or make up shortages in military technician or AGR authorizations.
     2.3.3. NGB/FMA will allocate workdays for each fiscal year based on assigned unit strength
     levels, specific activities and resource integrated process team decisions.
     2.3.4. Base Workday Control Officers (BWCO), or their designated alternates, are the
     primary points of contact regarding all workday matters. Requests initiated through channels
     other than BWCOs must be approved and coordinated with the BWCO, including special
     training and school training workdays.
     2.3.5. Proper workday utilization codes (WUCs) must be reported for the purpose of actual
     workday usage. (See your local FM office for listing of WUC definitions.) The WUC
     "OTHER" should be used only when the activity does not fit in a specific category.
2.4. Workday Requests.
     2.4.1. Requests for additional workdays will be honored based on validity, priority, and
     current resource availability. A WUC must be identified when requesting additional days
     from a validating resource advisor. Requests for additional workdays will be the unfunded
     process in NGB/FMA for AT and program managers for all other workdays.
     2.4.2. Requests for return of workdays must be accomplished immediately. Workdays
     allocated to support a specific program must be used for that program only. If an event is
     canceled, it is the unit's responsibility to return the days. A WUC must be identified when
     returning workdays. Failure to react immediately creates an enormous drain on resources
     that could be used to support other valid unfunded ANG requirements. Return or transfer of
     workdays will be through NGB/FMA for AT and program managers for all others.
     2.4.3. Units that have a requirement for workdays to be transferred from one ASN to another
     to support high priority training requirements should submit requests in accordance with
     current Fiscal Guidance.
     2.4.4. Supplemental Instructions. State Adjutants General and commanders may supplement
     this instruction, as appropriate, to ensure adequate controls of the base workday program.
ANGI36-2001 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                                        13


   Adequate internal controls must be in place to ensure compliance with supplemental
   instructions.

                                     ANNUAL TRAINING

3.1. General. All members except non-prior service personnel will participate in at least 15
days of AT during the fiscal year unless fulfilled by another type of active service, or excused for
a reason stated in paragraph 3.3. A written excusal will be kept on file for each member that
does not perform 15 days of AT or another type of active service which satisfies the 15 day AT
requirement. No written excusal is needed if the member performs 15 days of active service as
documented by pay records. Individuals may be ordered to training for periods of 1 to 15 days
on an individual basis, by small teams, subsections, sections, or flights as well as squadron,
group, or wing exercises that require attendance of all assigned personnel. The commander is
provided complete flexibility to schedule all available workdays to meet peak training periods or
to satisfy gaining command requirements.
3.2. Attendance:
   3.2.1. State Adjutants General. Federally recognized State Adjutants General and their staffs
   may attend AT of the Army and/or Air organizations of the respective states during dates
   specified in published orders.
   3.2.2. Commanders and staff members. Commanders and staff members of organizations
   that train at different sites or during different training periods may visit the AT of subordinate
   units.
   3.2.3. Units. Units on probation will not attend AT without prior written authorization from
   the Chief, NGB.
   3.2.4. Members. Members will normally attend AT with the unit to which assigned. The
   State Adjutants General may authorize attachment of individuals to another unit of the same
   State or to units of another State with the concurrence of the State Adjutants General of the
   other state.
3.3. Excusals: A commander may excuse a member (documentation required) from all or a
portion of 15 days of AT if one or more of the following applies:
   3.3.1. The member has served 2 or more years on AD and was released from AD during the
   fiscal year in which AT is scheduled.
   3.3.2. The member has completed his or her initial period of IADT within 6 months of
   commencement of AT.
   3.3.3. The member is found physically or mentally incapacitated.
   3.3.4. Scheduled training falls within the last 180 days of a member's obligated participation
   in the ANG.
   3.3.5. The member has enlisted during the fiscal year and accomplished a proportionate
   share of the 15-day AT requirement (1-1/4 days per month, rounded off).
   3.3.6. The member is scheduled to retire or separate from the unit during the fiscal year and
   accomplished a proportionate share of the 15-day AT requirement (1-1/4 days per month,
   rounded off).
16                                                            ANGI36-2001 19 OCTOBER 2009


     3.3.7. The member requests excusal and circumstances exist that in the opinion of the unit
     commander would impose extreme hardship upon the member.
     3.3.8. The member requests excusal and in the opinion of the unit commander the readiness
     status of neither the individual member nor the unit will be diminished by the excusal of the
     member.
     3.3.9. The member has already performed active duty during the year (school or special
     training days). The number of AT days authorized will be combined with performed duty to
     ensure that the members receives at least 15 active duty days (creditable towards a good
     retirement year).
3.4. Leave of Absence. When emergency circumstances arise that prevent an individual from
completing his or her ordered tour of AT, he or she will be relieved from duty by their
commander, and, where appropriate, scheduled to complete the remainder of the tour at a later
date.
3.5. Annual Training Performance Limitations:
     3.5.1. Annual training will not normally exceed a total of 15 days per fiscal year per
     individual member. However, in order to ease scheduling problems, expedite local planning,
     and assist in accomplishment of unit and individual training requirements, additional AT
     workdays per individual in excess of 15 days may be authorized. However, no member may
     perform more than 30 days of annual training in any one fiscal year as limited by DoDI
     1215.06, paragraph 6.6.4.1.2.2. Orders published at the request of the appropriate official are
     sufficient documentation of approval.
     3.5.2. Members who have already participated in 15 days of active service will not normally
     be scheduled to perform home station annual training. If home station active service is
     performed after completion of the member’s required 15 days, the member will perform duty
     on each day of the active service tour. Upon completion of the required 15 active duty days,
     the member will no longer be authorized to perform duty on a non-duty day unless the
     member is actually present for an 8-hour period.
     3.5.3. Units needing to place members on more than 30 days of annual training must contact
     NGB/FMAE and request to have annual training days converted to special training or ADOS,
     as appropriate for the use of the workdays.
3.6. Transportation of Personnel: When the annual training tour is not to be performed at
home station, government transportation must be used when possible. When ANG requirements
will be better served, travel may be directed by government conveyance or by transportation
request.
3.7. Duration: Performance of an AT workday must be a minimum of 8 hours.

               SPECIAL TRAINING (ST) AND OPERATIONAL SUPPORT

4.1. Introduction. Special training tours are specific category training periods designated to
accomplish a variety of training and operational support requirements that could not normally be
accomplished during UTAs, AT, and AFTPs. An explanation of when ST is authorized, the
types, restrictions, and limited uses are described here. These training periods may also satisfy
the requirement for ANG members to perform 15 days of active service for training at the local
commander’s discretion if the training provided meets the member’s wartime training
requirements.
4.2. Authorization. ST workdays are allocated by ANG program managers to units for specific
purposes (e.g., airlift support, deployments, and exercises) and may be issued at the start of the
fiscal year or on an as needed basis throughout the fiscal year.
4.3. Duration and Limitations:
   4.3.1. Performance of a ST workday at home station must be a minimum of 8 hours.
   Extended orders may be required for particular missions (e.g., ADOS, counter-drug support)
   allowing individuals to remain on orders during non-working days, such as weekends and
   holidays.
   4.3.2. ANG may place a limitation on certain types of ST or establish a priority on their use.
   This may occur when resources that have been tentatively approved for a specific program
   are reprogrammed by ANG to meet unforeseen critical requirements elsewhere.
   4.3.3. ST workdays that have been authorized for a specific purpose will be used only for
   that purpose (e.g., alert, exercises/deployments, etc.). Appropriate action must be taken to
   return the unused days via the validating resource advisor.
   4.3.4. Workdays used for travel will be included when determining the workday
   requirements. Workdays will not be programmed for payment of accrued leave for tours that
   exceed 29 days. Commanders will establish a leave policy to ensure that individuals take all
   leave accrued prior to the tour end date stated in the member's orders. Travel will be
   programmed in accordance with DoD 7000.14R Vol 7A, Chap 2.
   4.3.5. The primary purpose of ST workdays is to support continuation, qualification, and
   conversion training in the ANG mission equipment and for participation in operational
   training exercises; this applies to both flying and mission support. ST workdays for
   conferences and workshops must be held to a minimum.
   4.3.5.1. For units that are undergoing a conversion (i.e. activation, weapons system change,
   etc.) the purpose of ST days is to support non-formal conversion training for up to a 139 day
   period; and to support special conversion related operational projects, for up to a 179 day
   period. ST days are not to be used for time-frames beyond those stated.
   4.3.6. Individuals participating in any exercise or event located OCONUS not exclusively
   for the purpose of training and organization of ANG personnel (not to include Hawaii,
   Alaska, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands) will be ordered to AD under10 U.S.C. §
   12301(d), MPA man-days or ADOS days.

     4.3.7. ST workdays will not be reallocated between MPF IDs without written approval from
     the issuing program manager.
     4.3.8. Workdays required for support of specific events (e.g., exercises, airlift support, close
     air support, joint training, ferrying of aircraft, etc.) will be requested from the appropriate
     validating program manager.
     4.3.9. ST workdays will not be converted between officers and enlisted or vice-versa at the
     unit level. Requests must be sent to the original program manager who sent you the days.
     4.3.10. Under no circumstances will members be allowed to qualify for active duty
     sanctuary while serving on voluntary orders (any orders other than 10 U.S.C. § 12304
     {Presidential Reserve Callup}, 10 U.S.C. § 12302 {Partial Mobilization}, or 10 U.S.C. §
     12301 {Full/Total Mobilization}). Members who will enter sanctuary (18 years creditable
     active service) while on voluntary orders will complete a Statement of Understanding,
     Waiver of Active Duty Sanctuary, PRIOR to entering onto orders. This statement can be
     found in AFI 36-2131, Attachment 4.
     4.3.11. Counterdrug tours are operational missions and should be considered active service
     other than for training.
     4.3.12. Traditional guardsmen who accept active service tours in support of ANG or NGB
     for short duration projects or other administrative/support functions will be placed in an
     ADOS status. These days can be utilized at any location where assistance is needed to
     support ANG national headquarters. ADOS days may also be provided to traditional
     guardsmen representing NGB/ANG at conferences, seminars, workshops, etc. The
     NGB/ANG office being supported should provide ADOS workday resources. Technicians
     will perform special work for ANG/NGB in technician status utilizing bureau directed travel
     (BDT), unless the specified duty requires the member to be in an active military status (e.g.
     ASA). Members representing their state or unit at conferences, workshops, seminars, and
     meetings will use their own resources.
     4.3.13. Special training workdays assigned to validating program managers other than
     counterdrug are for the purpose of training and will not be used to assist in special projects or
     augment full-time support at NGB or ANG.
4.4. Requests to Program Managers. Validating program managers (NGB/ANG) may
establish their own workday request format and method of communication (e-mail, letter, etc.)
ANGI36-2001 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                                   19


                                           Chapter 5

                              FORMAL SCHOOL TRAINING

5.1. Formal school training (FST). A category of active service in a pay status to accomplish
required formal school AFSC upgrade training, refresher/proficiency training, or professional
military education. These training periods may also satisfy the requirement for ANG members
to perform the fiscal year requirement of 15 days of active service for training. Technicians are
prohibited from attending FST in a technician status.
5.2. Priorities for School Training. Initial skill, skill-level awarding training, in-residence
professional military education (PME), wartime required training, and mandatory recurrent
training are supported with school workdays and travel funds. Desirable/optional training or
events such as conferences, workshops, seminars, or symposiums are not supported with school
workdays or travel funds.
5.3. Limitations.
   5.3.1. Formal school workdays that have been validated and issued for a specific person or
   purpose will be used only for that person or purpose. Appropriate action must be taken to
   return the unused days via the BETM/BWCO and NGB/A1Y.
   5.3.2. Workdays used for travel will be included when determining the workday
   requirements. Workdays do not need to be programmed for payment of accrued leave for
   tours that exceed 29 days. When possible, accrued leave should be taken during the tour.
   Tours will not be extended solely for the purpose of allowing a member to use accrued leave.
   Payment of accrued leave will be IAW with DoD 7000.14R Vol 7A, Chap 35.
   5.3.3. School workdays will not be converted between officers and enlisted or vice-versa at
   the unit level.
   5.3.4. Members will not report to a training location without a Program Training Manager
   (PTM) issued TLN and a passing FIT score.
   5.3.5. All ANG members attending Undergraduate Flying Training (UFT) programs and
   Professional Military Education (PME) will attend in a Title 10 status.
   5.3.6. With regard to downtime between formal courses, members with a break in training
   (BIT) of greater than 30 days will return to their home station and be removed from school
   orders. These members will not be authorized downtime. If the member's BIT is less than
   30 days between courses they may remain on school days and remain in place awaiting their
   follow-on training. If the member returns to their home station in any status other than leave
   they will be removed from school day orders. JSUPT students awaiting IFF or fighter FTU
   and required to maintain landing currency will remain on school day orders at their assigned
   UPT base. BETMs should contact the program training manager (PTM) to schedule
   appropriate training. For exceptions to this policy contact NGB/A1Y.
   5.3.7. Units must forecast their training requirements for locally generated TLN school day
   courses such as simulator and physiological training. Units should have a training plan and
   obligate the funds by publishing orders before 31 Jul. NGB/A1Y cannot guarantee school
20                                                            ANGI36-2001 19 OCTOBER 2009


     days will be available after 31 Jul for these requirements not published on orders prior to 31
     Jul.
     5.3.8. Technicians will attend formal schools in military status. This policy does not
     preclude each unit from sending their personnel to unit funded supplemental training in
     Technician status in an effort to accommodate their members’ personal wishes. The BETM
     office has a list of unit funded courses. Commanders must keep in mind that if the
     supplemental unit funded training curricula requires that the member must meet military
     standards, such as required PT, for graduation; the technician will then attend the unit funded
     course in military active duty (annual training) status. Simulator training is exempt from this
     policy. Units may elect to unit fund technicians to simulator training in technician status.
     5.3.9. Cross country flights that are part of undergraduate flying training are not published
     by the member’s home unit but rather by the AETC base providing the training. Downtime
     between flying training courses is approved up to 30 days; over 30 days must be approved by
     NGB/A1Y.
     5.3.10. EMEDS training at Alpena, MI is school day funded with the following constraints,
     otherwise the course is unit funded. To be school day funded units must attend training using
     MIL AIR only (commercial air is not authorized unless unit funded). The course duration is
     no more than 7 days and members are billeted on base.
     5.3.11. TDY vs. PCS: A course or courses of instruction is considered a PCS if at the same
     location for more than 139 days ―scheduled duration‖ (see JFTR U2146), not the number of
     training days. If the scheduled duration from the course start date to the course end date
     minus the holidays and early report days is more than 139 days then the course must be
     attended in a PCS status. BAH waivers may be requested to keep the BAH rate from the
     members HOR.
     5.3.12. LEAVE: Non Prior Service (NPS) are not authorized regular leave while on Initial
     Active Duty Training (IADT). The only exception to this rule is when the schoolhouse
     releases members during the December holiday exodus. For Prior Service personnel (PS),
     take accrued leave during the tour. In addition, regular leave must be authorized by the
     Commander of the AETC unit while on an SD order. Tours are not extended for the purpose
     of allowing a member to use accrued leave. Payment of accrued leave is IAW with DOD
     7000.14R Vol 7A, Chap 35. While on seasoning days, if members are certified or mission
     qualified before expending the allocated seasoning days, then the unit will remove the
     member from seasoning days and return the unused days to NGB/A1Y and the member will
     be paid for unused leave as above.
5.4. Allocation. FST workdays and travel/ per diem funding (under project P541) are issued by
name and TLN via the program FM Checkbook to the BWCO.
     5.4.1. School workdays are accounted using the School Resource Report, an online tracking
     program. This program uses TLN data from MILPDS and must be kept up to date at each
     unit BETM office.
     5.4.2. TLNs from Training Resource Quota Indicators (TRQIs) other than the three ANG
     TRQIs: CC10, CNN0 and CC40 will not be funded by NGB using school days and must be
     unit funded with annual or special training resources.
ANGI36-2001 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                                   21


   5.4.3. Orders must be published and obligated as soon as the BETM receives the TLN.
   5.4.4. Because of limited funding for training each year, NGB/A1Y will collect back
   unobligated days several times during the year based on an AROWS report of days not
   obligated on orders. Those dates are available in the annual Workday Guidance letter sent to
   units. Units must ensure they have published all school orders for TLNs received before
   each date.
   5.4.5. Units will not contact the school houses directly and will work through the appropriate
   program training manager to secure a TLN for a formal school.
5.5. Letter of Authority/Training Line Number. A letter of authority (LOA) or training line
number (TLN) are not determining factors for school workday utilization. The purpose of a
LOA/TLN is to reserve a seat in a course for a specific individual. A LOA/TLN does not mean
that formal school workdays are automatically issued. Consult your BETM, who has access to
the BETM COP and the School Resource Report website which contain a course listing provided
by NGB/A1Y or PTM to see if a course is FST or unit funded. NGB/A1Y will not fund
LOAs/TLNs issued by other Training Requirement Quota Identifiers (TRQIs). Members will
not report to a training location without an ANG issued LOA/TLN.
5.6. Seasoning Days. This training provides unit or equipment-specific training not taught at
formal training locations. Seasoning is generally defined as training accomplished at home
station. Prior service and non-prior service (NPS) personnel are authorized seasoning as shown
in the annual authorized seasoning list from NGB/A1Y. Seasoning days listed on the authorized
list are the maximum allowed and if members are certified or trained before using the maximum
days listed then they should be removed from seasoning days.
   5.6.1. For the most up to date information regarding seasoning days and their use see the
   annual workday guidance and seasoning day guidance issued by NGB/A1Y.
   5.6.2. Military technicians and AGRs are not authorized seasoning days.
5.7. Line of Duty (LOD). When a member is injured on school training or BMT orders they
should contact the ANG liaison and NGB to report the injury and ensure the process of a LOD
determination is started. When additional days might be needed to continue the member on
orders, the BETM should contact NGB/SGOA and NGB/A1P.
5.8. Counterdrug (CD) Orders and School Tours. Counterdrug funds cannot be used for
other purposes. To ensure compliance with this congressional mandate, NGB/A1 will reimburse
NGB-CD for members on CD ADOS tours attending certain, but not all, schools. Do not break
CD ADOS tour orders for PME, seven-level training, or mandatory recurrent training. Per
memorandum of agreement between NGB-J3-CD and NGB/A1Y the member must notify CD
chain of command. The CD State Support Coordinator will forward request to NGB-J3-CD
Resources Branch. NGB-J3-CDR notifies State Support Coordinator who will coordinate the
travel or school with state training manager. Reimbursement will occur at the NGB level
through NGB-J3-CD and NGB/A1Y. Contact NGB-CDF with questions regarding CD. No one
will attend a school in CD status without prior approval from NGB-J3-CD. The TDY order is
published citing school travel funds
22                                                           ANGI36-2001 19 OCTOBER 2009


5.9. Holiday Exodus at AETC Training Locations. ANG and AFRC members attending
formal schools will remain in school-tour/IADT status during the holiday closure period, which
begins after COB Friday, 19 Dec 08, and ends 2 Jan 08 for , in time for students to report for
class Monday 5 Jan 09. The following options are available for ANG & AFRC technical
training students:
     5.9.1. Take leave: Students may take up to the amount of leave they accrue, or will accrue
     during the period of their orders, at their own expense. Advanced leave is authorized.
     Students may take less, but the maximum amount of leave needed for this period is 15 days.
     Excess leave is not authorized. No travel orders for the purpose of the holiday closure period
     will be issued.
     5.9.2. Remain at school: Students who remain at school will perform duties as required by
     the training organization.
     5.9.3. Perform Duty at the Permanent Duty Station (PDS) during the Formal School Holiday
     Closure: Students who live within commuting distance of their PDS, or who will otherwise
     lodge within commuting distance of their PDS (at their own expense), for the duration of the
     Duty at the PDS, may return at their own expense to perform duty during the holiday closure
     period. They must have written authorization from the TRS commander, coordinated with
     their PDS commander. Authority: AFI 36-3003, paragraph 6.1.3., and JFTR U-4175.
        5.9.3.1. Performing Duty at the PDS, during the holiday closure period, is at the
        member's request and convenience. This duty is performed at no-cost-to-the-government
        and approval authority rests with the training squadron commander (TRS/CC) or
        authorized representative, with the duty being ―concurred‖ by or coordinated with, the
        PDS/CC, or authorized representative. Note for NPS Airmen, PDS/CC=MPF/CC, not
        AFSC specific unit.
        5.9.3.2. Under no circumstances are units to recall any student. The PDS/CC cannot
        authorize or direct a member to return to perform duty. This would constitute a unit
        recall. Unit recalls are prohibited. A recall action terminates course enrollment, cancels
        the training line number, and precludes the student's return after the holiday period.
        5.9.3.3. Definition of Duty or Suitable Work: Consider duty or suitable work to be
        comparable to the type of duty a student would perform at the training location during the
        holiday break, to include: cleaning details, runner, answering phones, or helping in the
        area of the student’s assigned AFSC. Specific duty within the student’s assigned AFSC
        is not required. NOTE: Duty cannot be performed at the student’s home of record (no
        telecommuting).
        5.9.3.4. Students must not depart earlier than, nor return later than, times authorized by
        technical training school officials, for their respective courses. Training squadron
        commanders are the final authority for approval.
        5.9.3.5. Students may drive their vehicles back from leave only if approved by the TRS
        and home unit for TPC or TR Cost.
ANGI36-2001 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                              23


     5.9.3.6. A request memorandum for Duty at the PDS during the Formal School Holiday
     Closure must be completed through the first endorsement prior to departure. The
     member is responsible for completing the required information in the memorandum and
     ensuring the document is faxed to the PDS/CC for endorsement. The technical training
     squadron that the member is assigned to will provide the memorandum for their students.
     A copy of the completed memorandum must be returned to the Liaison Office and also
     must be submitted with the travel voucher at the end of training.

                                           Chapter 6

                               UNIT TRAINING ASSEMBLIES

6.1. Historical Perspective. Some training objectives such as ancillary training, physicals, and
messing can best be met effectively during scheduled UTA weekends. Much training, however,
requires an intense one-on-one trainer-student relationship using highly complex equipment.
The availability of trainers and training equipment is greatly limited on unit UTA weekends.
Therefore, the procedures in this chapter are designed to provide commanders maximum
flexibility in scheduling their resources to meet training objectives. This flexibility comes from
the use of the full-time workforce, which is the backbone of the training cadre and is available
throughout the unit’s scheduled workweek. This chapter establishes basic policy and procedures
for conducting these IDT periods and implements the policies contained in DoD 1215.6 and DoD
1215.13, and the provisions of 32 U.S.C. § 502 and 37 U.S.C. § 206(e).
6.2. Definitions:
     6.2.1. Unit Training Assemblies (UTA). A unit-training period of 4 hours scheduled to
     include the majority of assigned unit personnel. (See paragraph 6.3.)
     6.2.2. Split Unit Training Assemblies (SUTA). A unit training period of 4 hours scheduled
     to include 50 percent or less of assigned personnel. (See paragraph 6.4.) (NOTE: UTAs and
     SUTAs are normally scheduled in blocks of four training periods over a 2-day weekend.)
     6.2.3. Rescheduled Unit Training Assembly (RUTA). A 4-hour supervised training period
     rescheduled by a commander or designated representative outside a regularly scheduled UTA
     or SUTA weekend. (See paragraph 6.5.)
     6.2.4. Equivalent Training (EQT). A 4-hour supervised training period designed to allow an
     individual member to make up an excused absence (for pay) or unexcused absence (for
     retirement points only) from a UTA, SUTA, or RUTA. (See paragraph 6.6.)
     6.2.5. Telecommuting. A UTA will not be authorized for performance of telecommuting
     duties. This program is performed in a point’s only status. (ANGI 36-8001, Air National
     Guard Traditional Guard Member Telecommuting Policy.)
6.3. Unit Training Assemblies:
     6.3.1. Scheduling. All federally recognized units will conduct 48 UTAs each fiscal year
     except as noted in paragraph 6.3.2. below. No more than two UTAs will be conducted on
     any one-calendar day. When a commander determines that it is necessary to reschedule a
     UTA due to weather conditions or mission requirements causing more than 4 UTAs to be
     conducted in one calendar month, a letter of notification must be forwarded to NGB/A1Y. A
     UTA schedule in the form of an order published not later than 4 months before the first
     newly scheduled UTA month will be the primary means of informing unit members of
     impending UTAs. The schedule should contain a 12-month UTA schedule and contain the
     following information: date, time, and location of each UTA. It shall also contain the
     following statement: ―All members of the (designated unit) are hereby ordered to attend all
     unit training assemblies shown on this training schedule unless attending a split UTA
     (SUTA) or Rescheduled UTA (RUTA).‖ The schedule should be provided to individuals and
ANGI36-2001 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                                       25


  posted in a conspicuous place. A copy of UTA schedule for the upcoming fiscal year will be
  forwarded to NGB/A1Y NLT 1 September of each year.
  6.3.2. Limitations:
     6.3.2.1. Units or members called to active duty involuntarily under 10 U.S.C. § 12304
     {Presidential Reserve Call up}, 10 U.S.C. § 12302 {Partial Mobilization}, or 10 U.S.C. §
     12301 {Full/Total Mobilization} during the fiscal year will participate in a prorated
     number of UTAs for the remainder of the fiscal year. Units returned to State control
     under 32 U.S.C. § 325 (b) may make up missed UTAs. Wing Commanders are provided
     complete flexibility to schedule available UTAs to meet peak training periods or to
     satisfy gaining command requirements. State Adjutants General and Commanders may
     supplement these instructions, as appropriate, to ensure adequate control of the base
     workday program.
     6.3.2.2. The Secretary of the Air Force may authorize a unit to conduct more or less than
     the prescribed number of UTAs. Units requiring such authority will submit requests and
     justification to NGB/A1Y. The makeup of UTAs includes members that may have been
     away on orders to attend Formal School Training under 32 U.S.C. § 504.
     6.3.2.3. ANG unit commanders may authorize members, with their consent, to
     participate in training duties without pay.
     6.3.2.4. Members of the ANG may attend scheduled UTAs with organizations other than
     their own for the following purposes:
         6.3.2.4.1. To attend ANG schools.
         6.3.2.4.2. Unique training available only at other locations.
         6.3.2.4.3. To attend college at another location.
         6.3.2.4.4. When the place of duty is not the unit in which the position is authorized
         (e.g., State staff flight surgeon performing duty at a subordinate flying unit).
         6.3.2.4.5. Chaplain duty as required.
         6.3.2.4.6. Absence from the vicinity of the parent unit for an extended period.
         6.3.2.4.7. Valid circumstances as determined by the commander.
         6.3.2.4.8. Non-prior service members may only receive pay for Unit Training
         Assemblies of up to 48 Inactive Duty Drills.
  6.3.3. Constructive Attendance. Members may be considered as constructively present
  during training assemblies, although not entitled to pay, when they are authorized in writing
  to be absent for one of the following reasons:
     6.3.3.1. When attending an accredited basic course, AFROTC during the academic year
     and participation with his/her unit is determined not feasible by the State Adjutant
     General.
     6.3.3.2. When performing active service.
     6.3.3.3. When hospitalized or incapacitated as a result of line of duty injury or illness.
  6.3.4. Required approvals:
26                                                            ANGI36-2001 19 OCTOBER 2009


        6.3.4.1. A member may train with an ANG unit located within the same State provided
        both commanders concerned approve.
        6.3.4.2. A member may train with other reserve components subject to the concurrence
        of the State Adjutant General and the approving authority of the reserve component.
        6.3.4.3. A member may train with units of the Active Air Force provided the State
        Adjutant General and the Air Force commander concur. The Active Air Force unit where
        duty is to be performed must be in the United State or a U. S. territory.
        6.3.4.4. A member may train with an ANG unit located in another state provided both
        State Adjutants General, or their designated representatives, concur.
     6.3.5. Duration of UTA. A UTA will be no less than 4 hours in duration, except as follows:
        6.3.5.1. The State Adjutants General may authorize a UTA of not less than 2 hours
        duration for the purpose of the entire unit’s participation in certain drills, ceremonies, or
        parades that are conducted outside the unit’s home installation.
        6.3.5.2. Under exceptional circumstances, a member may be credited with attendance at
        a UTA for pay purposes as long as he or she has participated in the scheduled UTA for at
        least 2 hours. Although commanders are permitted the flexibility of granting this
        authorization based upon the circumstances involved, appropriate internal controls must
        be maintained. Internal controls should include advance written authorization and special
        attention for consecutive periods of authorization. This provision will not be exercised
        for personal convenience of the member concerned.
        6.3.5.3. A Unit Commander may, under extenuating circumstances, release all members
        of their units from the requirement to complete the 4-hour period. This action should
        only be taken after the unit has performed a minimum of 2 hours and the commander
        must state in writing the reasons for this early release. A copy of this memorandum must
        be forwarded to the Adjutant General.
     6.3.6. Satisfactory Performance:
        6.3.6.1. Members must be physically and mentally capable of performing UTA duty.
        Commanders are responsible for informing all personnel of their respective units that
        each member must report any physical or mental condition that might impair their
        performance of duty before they start any UTA. If the physical or mental ability of a
        member is questionable, the professional opinion of qualified military medical personnel
        and evaluation for performance of such training should be obtained.
        6.3.6.2. Unit commanders may grant excused absences to individuals who miss a UTA.
        Members must be excused in writing even if the missed UTA will not be performed in a
        RUTA, SUTA, or EQT status. No more than 4 UTA periods may be made up in a paid
        EQT status in any fiscal year. (See paragraph 6.6.)
        6.3.6.3. At the discretion of the unit commander, unexcused absences should normally
        result when:
            6.3.6.3.1. Member fails to report for the UTA without prior approval.
            6.3.6.3.2. Member is late for the UTA or leaves early without prior approval.
ANGI36-2001 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                                    27


           6.3.6.3.3. Member fails to comply with all provisions of AFI 36-2903, Dress and
           Personal Appearance of Air Force Personnel, and the commander directs the member
           to depart the duty station for the infraction(s).
   6.3.7. With the commander's approval, unexcused absences may be made up for retirement
   points only. No pay entitlement accrues to an individual making up an unexcused absence.
   6.3.8. Process unsatisfactory participation IAW guidelines in AFI 36-3209, Separation
   Procedures for Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve Personnel.
6.4. Split Unit Training Assemblies (SUTA): A SUTA occurs when the manpower resources
of an ANG unit are divided and organizations perform training during different training periods.
Commanders of units are authorized SUTAs to maximize flying training or to achieve other
mission goals that cannot be achieved during one training period. Prepare NGB Form 633,
Attendance Roster IAW ANGI-65-101, Chapter 3.3.6.
   6.4.1. SUTAs are also authorized to provide staff visits; inspections, or training that must be
   accomplished at times other than the scheduled UTA.
   6.4.2. Commanders may schedule units or portions of units to perform training in a SUTA
   status whenever compatible training cannot be achieved on a regular UTA.
   6.4.3. In accordance with 32 U.S.C. 502 (b), to have a series of formations credited as an
   assembly for drill, all parts of the unit must be included in the series within 90 consecutive
   days. Therefore, SUTAs must be scheduled within 90 days of the regular scheduled UTA.
   6.4.4. SUTAs authorized will meet the following criteria:
       6.4.4.1. The training is accomplished by complete subordinate elements of the unit
       (flight, team, section, or subsection) as indicated in the appropriate manpower source
       listing or by individuals grouped for specialized training.
       6.4.4.2. Each part of a SUTA is supervised by an officer or noncommissioned officer (E-
       5 or above) and is of the same or greater duration as the training assembly for which
       substituted.
   6.4.5. Scheduled training that cannot be conducted due to changing circumstances and
   requirements will be canceled and rescheduled. Examples:
       6.4.5.1. A training flight cannot be accomplished due to weather conditions or
       availability of aircraft or training equipment.
       6.4.5.2. The unit to be supported by support personnel is required to change UTA dates.
       6.4.5.3. Training cannot be conducted due to natural disasters, civil disturbances, or
       other compelling reasons, as determined by the commander.
       6.4.5.4. The attendance at the parent unit for the scheduled UTA will be the sum total of
       the attendance of each of the authorized split assemblies. However, no member will be
       counted more than once nor receive credit for more than one formation.
6.5. Rescheduled Unit Training Assembly (RUTA). The RUTA is available to commanders
to achieve training objectives using maximum available equipment and full-time personnel
resources. Commanders are responsible for mission readiness, and therefore maintain the
28                                                           ANGI36-2001 19 OCTOBER 2009


authority for decisions to reschedule a unit training assembly for members. The following
conditions and limitations apply:
     6.5.1. The provisions of paragraphs 6.3.2. 6.3.4., 6.3.5., and 6.3.6. apply to RUTAs.
     6.5.2. A RUTA must be requested and approved in advance of the missed period. If the
     request and/or the approval were initially made verbally, approval must be documented prior
     to the RUTA being performed. Documentation may be on the NGB Form 633, NGB Form
     105 remarks section or may be documented separately. Wherever documented, the
     documentation should include the reason for the RUTA.
     6.5.3. Criteria for Approval.
        6.5.3.1. Training received during a RUTA must be of equal to or better quality than the
        training that would have been received during the missed training assembly.
        6.5.3.2. If the RUTA is at the request of the member, the unit commander may deny or
        approve based upon valid circumstances as determined by the commander.
        6.5.3.3. Training objectives such as ancillary training, physicals, and unit continuity and
        cohesiveness must be maintained.
        6.5.3.4. A RUTA will not be performed outside of the fiscal year of a missed UTA or
        SUTA.
        6.5.3.5. A RUTA must be approved by the commander or their designated
        representative(s).
        6.5.3.6. An individual may only perform RUTAs for those scheduled UTAs, which fall
        during the time the individual, is an active member of the ANG. Since ANG assistants
        are authorized to perform all UTAs for a six-month period at anytime during the six
        months the allowable UTAs must be prorated based on the number of months the
        member is actively assigned to the ANG. For example, if an ANG assistant is retiring in
        November, the allowable number of UTA periods in that 6-month period is eight.
            6.5.3.6.1. An individual known to be switching from ANG Technician or Traditional
            Drill status to AGR status may not be authorized to perform RUTAs for drills
            scheduled after the AGR start date. AGRs switching back to ANG Technician or
            Traditional Drill status may not be authorized to perform RUTAs for drills scheduled
            prior to the AGR end date.
6.6. Equivalent Training (EQT). A member may be allowed to make up a UTA that was
missed even if the UTA was missed without prior approval. EQTs can be performed in a pay
status for excused absences and in a non-pay status (retirement points only) for unexcused
absences, as approved by the commander.
     6.6.1. Commanders may allow individuals to make up a maximum of four missed UTA
     periods in a paid EQT status per fiscal year [37 U.S.C. § 206(e)].
     6.6.2. An EQT period without pay (for retirement points only) may be performed outside of
     90 calendar days of the missed scheduled UTA period but within the member's anniversary
     year. UTAs performed in a non-pay status will be documented on NGB Form 105m/s or a
     locally substituted form, held separately from attendance records for UTAs in a pay status,
     and forwarded directly to MPF.
ANGI36-2001 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                                  29


   6.6.3. The training received during an EQT must be of similar nature and quality to that
   which was missed. EQT will be appropriate to and enhance ability of the individual to
   accomplish the duties of the position to which he or she is assigned. In the case of staff or
   support personnel, this may include actions to enhance the training, management, or
   readiness of the unit.
   6.6.4. Paragraphs 6.3.2., 6.3.4., 6.3.5., and 6.3.6. also apply to EQTs.

                                 PROFICIENCY TRAINING

7.1. Purpose. Proficiency training (PT) enables officers and enlisted personnel to achieve or
maintain a high level of proficiency within the member's AFSC to improve the readiness posture
of the ANG. PT periods will be a minimum of 4 hours in duration and a maximum of 8 hours.
A member may perform a maximum of one PT per calendar day, and may not be performed in
conjunction with another type of IDT period (UTA, RUTA, EQT, AFTP, or TPPA) or active
service (AT, ST, etc.). Four hours in duration is the minimum; however, greater length training
periods are strongly encouraged to maximize resource utilization.
7.2. Provisions and Limitations:
     7.2.1. Utilization of PTs by technician employees must be closely monitored by the base
     workday control officer. Technician personnel will be in a technician leave status anytime
     they are on orders for military duties.
     7.2.2. Air weapons controllers, technicians of the tactical air control system (TACS), space
     and missile warning operators, and aerial port personnel who are military technicians are
     authorized to perform PTs.
     7.2.3. Other military technicians are eligible to perform PTs if the duty being performed is
     not in any way related to the technician's normal technician duty. For example, if a
     technician air operations specialist were required to work in base operations after normal
     duty, authorization of a PT for such duty would be inappropriate since the work to be
     performed is related to his or her technician duties.
     7.2.4. PT periods are authorized for fire protection support; however, they must be
     controlled to ensure that use is limited to only auxiliary firefighters, non-technician fire
     protection personnel, and the base fire chief. NOTE: Units are not allocated fenced PT days
     for fire protection support since adequate full-time support is authorized; therefore, their
     technicians are not authorized to perform PTs for fire protection.
     7.2.5. No individual may exceed 30 PTs per fiscal year.
ANGI36-2001 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                                    31

                   TRAINING PERIOD PREPARATION ASSEMBLIES

8.1. Purpose. TPPAs are used by key training personnel for the preparation of training
programs; lesson plans, training aids, and unit training administration in order to provide the
maximum training during a UTA weekend.
8.2. Provisions and Limitations:
   8.2.1. TPPA authorizations. The only members authorized TPPAs are those individuals, in
   designated types of units or specific functional activities, who are in UMD or additional duty
   positions that involve the preparation, administration, and supervision of inactive duty unit
   training activities. Such training activities include AFSC continuation/proficiency training,
   ancillary training, OJT, and similar requirements. Commanders must limit the authorization
   of TPPAs to those that are necessary to maintain the standards of training of the unit(s)
   involved.
       8.2.1.1. Unit/Activity Authorizations. All units and functional activities are authorized
       TPPAs.
       8.2.1.2. Individual member authorizations.
           8.2.1.2.1. Each individual eligible member will be authorized a maximum of 30 per
           fiscal year.
           8.2.1.2.2. Quarterly limitations. A member may be paid for no more than eight
           TPPAs per fiscal quarter.
           8.2.1.2.3. Daily Limitations. Only one TPPA per individual will be authorized
           during a calendar day. TPPAs may not be performed in conjunction with any other
           type of inactive service training day (UTA, RUTA, AFTP, PT, EQT) or active service
           for training day (AT, ST, etc.).
8.3. Utilization and Eligibility:
   8.3.1. TPPAs are authorized for use by traditional guardsmen only. Military technicians are
   not eligible for TPPAs.
   8.3.2. TPPAs will be a minimum of 4 hours in duration although greater length assemblies
   are encouraged.
   8.3.3. Distribution. Priority of distribution should be given to units and functions with no or
   little full-time support.

                                            Chapter 9

                        ADDITIONAL FLYING TRAINING PERIODS

9.1. Purpose. AFTPs for officers and enlisted on flying status enable flight personnel to
achieve and maintain a high level of flight proficiency in order to promote flight safety and
improve the readiness posture of the ANG. All planning pertaining to the use of AFTPs will be
directed toward these goals. DoD guidance (DoDI 1215.06) limits the use of AFTPs to primary
aircrew members to conduct aircrew training and combat crew qualification training to attain and
maintain aircrew flying proficiency and sustain required readiness.
9.2. AFTP Authorizations. The only members authorized AFTPs are those who are in
authorized positions that require active flying: API codes 1, 6 and 8. Designated personnel must
remain professionally and physically qualified to maintain eligibility. Accomplishment of all
authorized AFTPs is not mandatory. Commanders must limit the authorization of AFTPs to
those that are necessary to maintain the professional qualification and proficiency of
assigned/attached aircrew personnel. Aircrew members must be obtaining or maintaining
qualification in an aircraft in order to perform an AFTP in that aircraft or authorized simulator
(NGB/A3 will maintain a list of approved simulator devices).
9.3. Annual/quarterly authorizations: See Tables 9-1 and 9-2.
     9.3.1. For pararescue personnel, authorized aircrew related ground-training activities include
     situational medical exercises, field training, communications training, and transportation
     from training areas.
     9.3.2. Converting Units. Table 9-2 applies to those aircrew members who are assigned to a
     unit undergoing a primary aircraft conversion and who are required to train in that specific
     aircraft.
     9.3.3. Status Change:
        9.3.3.1. Traditional Guardsman to Military Technician. When a member becomes a
        technician, the new quarterly and annual AFTP limitations for a technician apply
        immediately. If the member has already exceeded the quarterly or annual limitation at
        the time of the status change, no waiver is required for the duty that has already been
        performed but no additional AFTPs are authorized for the remainder of that period.
        9.3.3.2. Temporary Technician. Periods of temporary technician duty do not change the
        number of AFTPs authorized for a member.
        9.3.3.3. Promotion to Colonel. When a member is promoted to colonel, the new
        quarterly and annual AFTP limitations for an O-6 apply immediately. If the member has
        already exceeded the quarterly or annual limitation at the time of the status change, no
        waiver is required for the duty that has already been performed but no additional AFTPs
        are authorized for the remainder of that period.
9.4. Requirements and Limitations. The minimum requirements and limitations for aircrew
members on current flying status participating in AFTPs are as follows:
     9.4.1. AFTPs will be authorized in advance.
ANGI36-2001 19 OCTOBER 2009                                                                       33


   9.4.2. An AFTP is not authorized on a day when the member has participated in two UTAs,
   two EQTs, two RUTAs, two SUTAs, one PT, one TPPA, or an active service day.
   9.4.3. One AFTP can be performed in conjunction with one UTA, EQT, RUTA, or SUTA on
   the same calendar day provided the aggregated training time is not less than 8 hours.
   9.4.4. No more that two AFTPs per individual are authorized during 1 calendar day.
   9.4.5. Each AFTP must be a minimum of 4 hours in duration but can be longer.
   9.4.6. At least one sortie/approved simulator must be performed per flying AFTP.
   Exception: two AFTPs may be logged if the sortie duration for one sortie is four hours or
   more, provided the combined training time is not less than 8 hours.
   9.4.7. If a training session extends past 2400 hours, the time after midnight is included in the
   last AFTP of the previous day. A maximum of two AFTPs per flight, regardless of duration
   may be authorized.
   9.4.8. Once a mission departs, crewmembers must remain in the initial pay status until the
   termination of the mission/flight. The AFTO 781, ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data
   Document, may not be broken for the sole purpose of changing pay status.
   9.4.9. Ground AFTPs may be credited when the aircrew member performs the ground
   training requirements listed below and are a minimum of four hours.
   9.4.9.1. The training requirements listed in Simulator and AFI 11-MDS including computer
   based training and unit training devices.
       9.4.9.2. Standardization/evaluation examination requirements established in AFI 11-
       MDS.
       9.4.9.3. Aircrew mission planning activities for subsequent operational training flights.
9.5. Crewmember duties.
   9.5.1. Aircrews must be authorized and scheduled to perform crewmember duties in the
   aircraft in which they perform the AFTP. AFTPs will only be credited when the member
   performs flight duties, or related ground training requirements to include flight simulator
   training in a simulator on the list maintained by NGB/A3. Related ground training
   requirements do not include supervisor of flying, runway supervisor, launch control officer,
   landing zone officer, drop zone officer and other such duties.
   9.5.2. Aeromedical evacuation (AE) personnel are authorized to use AFTPs in the following
   AE roles:
   9.5.2.1. Fulfilling any crewmember position.
       9.5.2.2. As a simulated patient (an AE crewmember will not act solely as a patient on a
       mission; member must perform at least one training event).
   9.5.3. Pararescue personnel may perform AFTPs on any aircraft, when their duties relate to
   their currency or qualification, i.e., parachutist duties, free fall swimmer deployments, etc.
9.6. Military Technician Participation: AFTPs are authorized during military technician
hours provided the technician is on annual leave, leave without pay, or compensatory leave
status. If any portion of the flight occurs in military technician status, the technician will not be
34                                                           ANGI36-2001 19 OCTOBER 2009


eligible for a paid AFTP. When AFTPs, including preflight and/or post flight, result in or
include activities other than those conducted during an ANG technician’s normal duty day, the
technician is required to be in a leave status during the period of those activities.
9.7. Records and Report:
     9.7.1. Recording entries. When a flight originates and terminates at station in different time
     zones, the AFTP duty time entries will be recorded using the local time at point of departure
     for the AFTP.
     9.7.2. Reports and records of attendance. Reports and records of all AFTPs will reflect
     authorization by the unit commander or designated representative. NGB Form 105 or
     authorized substitute will be used to document each completed AFTP for pay purposes.
