This instruction implements AFPD 32-10, Installation and Facilities and 32-90 Real Property
Asset Management. This instruction establishes the responsibilities and procedures of the Civil
Engineer’s Work Request Priority System (WRPS). It applies to all 35 FW units and tenants on
Misawa Air Base that submit work order requirements to the 35th Civil Engineer Squadron for
accomplishment.

Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are
maintained in accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records,
and disposed of in accordance with Air Force Records Information Management System
(AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-
af61a/afrims/. Additionally, if the publication generates a report(s), alert readers in a statement
and cite all applicable Report Control Numbers in accordance with AFI 33-324. Refer
recommended changes and questions about this publication to the Office of Primary
Responsibility (OPR) using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication; route
AF Form 847s from the field through the appropriate functional’s chain of command.”

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This instruction was reaccomplished to coincide with significant changes in Civil Engineer Work
Request Priority System.
1. General.
   1.1. An efficient and effective system for submitting and prioritizing civil engineer (CE)
   work is critical to ensuring limited resources are directed toward the most needed
2                                                        35FWI32-1003 19 NOVEMBER 2009


    requirements. The Work Request Priority System (WRPS) gives commanders the means and
    responsibility to determine what CE support is most critical in facilities under their
    command. An understanding of the process for identifying, prioritizing and submitting work
    requests to CES, as outlined in this instruction, is important for managing both workload and
    expectations. This instruction applies to in-house work orders, but does not include direct
    scheduled work (DSW: typically 50 hours or less), self-help work, or project scope work.
    Infrastructure work orders for mission sustaining maintenance and repair will be determined
    and categorized separately within CE. The following are examples of infrastructure work
    orders:
       1.1.1. Airfield surfaces
       1.1.2. Roads, parking lots and sidewalks.
       1.1.3. Water treatment plants, storage and distribution systems.
       1.1.4. Wastewater collection plants and treatment systems.
       1.1.5. Base storm drainage systems.
       1.1.6. Electrical distribution systems and substations.
       1.1.7. POL storage and distribution systems.
       1.1.8. Steam plants and distribution systems.
       1.1.9. Facility painting and roofing.
    1.2. The WRPS establishes an active file of 50 work orders allocated to Misawa Air Base
    organizations according to the breakout shown in Attachment 1. The number of work orders
    allocated to each organization is determined using approximate square footage of facilities
    within each group after accounting for large, minimally occupied facilities. Each group will
    develop their own methods and procedures for prioritizing work requests. Groups cannot
    submit requests above their allocation.
    1.3. Following group prioritization, selected work requests will be submitted to CES, placed
    into the active file, and they will remain there until completed as an in-house work order,
    funded as a project, or reclassified as a DSW, self-help work order, disapproved, or otherwise
    cancelled in the WRPS database. If a work request is reclassified, it will be removed from
    the active file and the appropriate group will be notified that an allocation is open for
    submittal of their next work request.
    1.4. CES will direct resources to work orders based upon the priority received from each
    group. The active 50 will be generally worked on a first-in first-out basis, but due to
    complexity, scope of work, availability of materials, manpower, funding and other
    considerations, work orders may not actually be completed in the order submitted.
    1.5. Groups may insert a mission-critical work order in place of a work request in the active
    file; however, this is discouraged since resources (manpower, funds, materials, planning, or
    design for projects) will have already been committed to/expended on work orders in the
    active top 50. Work requests that displace a work order which already has resources
    committed, must have mission impact justification signed by the owning group commander
    and must be coordinated through the MSG commander.

2. Responsibilities.
   2.1. Each organization indentified on Attachment 1 will:
       2.1.1. Appoint a liaison to work closely with respective facility managers and 35 CES for
       WRPS issues. This liaison should be the Group deputy or organizational equivalent.
       2.1.2. Develop a Group system to prioritize their work requests prior to submittal to 35
       CES.
   2.2. 35 CES will:
       2.2.1. Review and approve policy changes in the WRPS.
       2.2.2. Review    group    mission-critical          insert     requests         and   provide
       recommendations/approval.
       2.2.3. Chair the Work Request Review Board (WRRB) to determine final classification
       or disposition of work requests.
       2.2.4. Maintain overall control of the WRPS.
       2.2.5. Be responsible for operations of the WRPS.
       2.2.6. Ensure work order packages are complete and communicate and justify the proper
       requirement.
       2.2.7. Maintain accurate reports to track all work orders in the active file.
       2.2.8. Notify the appropriate work order monitor when an allocation opens for their
       WRPS group and request their next priority be placed into their active file.
       2.2.9. Conduct meetings as required with WRPS group monitors to advise them on status
       of the work orders in their active file and address any questions about the program.
   2.3. Group or organization WRPS liaison will:
       2.3.1. Maintain the group’s prioritized work orders in the inactive file.
       2.3.2. Submit the group’s next highest priority work request to 35 CES when notified
       there is an allocation available.
       2.3.3. Act as the single point of contact for WRPS issues.
3. Procedures.
   3.1. Facility managers will submit work requests to 35 CES Customer Service section. If an
   initial review by CE personnel determines the work request to be above DSW scope or
   unique in nature, the work request will be routed to the WRRB.
   3.2. If the WRRB determines the work request is work order scope, the CES customer
   service section will forward the request to the owning organization’s liaison for
   prioritization.
   3.3. If the WRRB determines the work request is project scope, the CES customer service
   section will send the request directly to the 35 CES Programming Flight. Projects will be
   prioritized at the Facilities Board.

    3.4. Work requests submitted for fire, safety or bio-environmental deficiencies must have a
    report attached with a corresponding risk assessment code (RAC) or fire safety deficiency
    code (FSDC). These requests will be worked separately based of severity of the condition
    and will not count against Group allocations.
    3.5. The Group WRPS Liaison will hold prioritized work requests not currently in the active
    file, until notified of an opening of an allocation for submittal of their next priority.
