3. Motorcycle PPE.
   3.1. Minimum Required PPE. Motorcycle PPE minimum requirements are mandated in AFI
   91-207, paragraph 3.4.2.3. Wing safety will maintain decision authority if ambiguity arises
   with a specific piece of PPE meeting the minimum requirements.
   3.2. Backpacks. Backpacks may be worn if the backpack itself meets the high visibility and
   retro-reflective property requirements for an outer upper garment IAW AFI 91-207
   paragraph 3.4.2.4.
      3.2.1. High visibility/retro-reflective backpacks are authorized in uniform for safety
      considerations on days the member rides a motorcycle IAW AFI 36-2903, paragraphs
      2.8.1 and 2.8.4.
      3.2.2. Backpacks may be covered or wrapped with a high visibility/retro-reflective upper
      garment to meet the intent of AFI 91-207. A reflective belt around the backpack does not
      meet the high visibility/retro-reflective intent.
   3.3. Highly Encouraged PPE. In addition to the mandatory PPE requirements in AFI 91-207,
   the following items are highly encouraged in order to further minimize injury to riders:
4                                                  552ACWI91-207 10 SEPTEMBER 2013


    3.3.1. Full Face Helmet. Although half-face or three-quarter-face helmets are authorized
    as long as they meet DOT standards, these helmets provide no protection to the eyes, jaw,
    and nose should a rider’s face come in contact with an object or the ground in an
    accident.
    3.3.2. Jacket and Pants Designed for Motorcycle Use. Clothing designed for motorcycle
    use is designed to be abrasion resistant and also provides additional padding to the rider.
    Long-sleeved shirts and jeans meet the minimum requirements but provide zero
    protection against skin abrasion or bruising and breaking of bones.
    3.3.3. Hearing Protection. Short exposure to wind noise on a motorcycle at highway
    speeds can cause permanent hearing damage with or without a helmet. Riders are
    encouraged to wear hearing protection to the maximum extent practical. Riders are
    cautioned that they may initially notice that hearing protection impacts their situational
    awareness by limiting, or changing, the sounds they are used to hearing when another
    vehicle is nearby. Riders should maintain vigilance and realize that the new sound
    characteristics will become the norm.

              552 ACW UNIT COMMANDER’S MOTORCYCLE SAFETY GUIDE

Table A3.1. 552 ACW commander’s motorcycle safety guide


The intent of this guide is to educate unit commanders with little exposure to motorcycle riding. This guide can be used by
commanders or their representatives in conjunction with Attachment 2 to brief new unit riders.

Visit the motorcycle training library at www.msf-usa.org for resources and more information on the basics of motorcycle
riding.
PPE and Training requirements are paraphrased excerpts from AFI91-207, The US Air Force Traffic Safety Program, 27
Oct 2011.

Unit Commander or designated MSR will provide initial briefing to new or newly assigned riders within 30 days from
initial assignment, identification as a rider, or purchase of a motorcycle.

Required PPE. PPE applies to all AF military on or off a DoD installation and all AF civilian personnel on a DoD installation or
in a duty status when off a DoD installation:

Head Protection – Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 218 (DOT sticker), UNECE 22.05, British Standard 6658, Snell
M2005 (Snell 2005 sticker) certified helmet.

Eye Protection – Impact and shatter resistant goggles, wrap around glasses, or a full-face helmet shield designed to meet or
exceed ANSI Standard Z87.1, or UNECE 22.05 or BS6658. A windshield does not constitute proper eye protection.

Protective Clothing – Wearing of long sleeved shirt or jacket, long trousers and full-fingered gloves or mittens. Gloves or mittens
will be made from leather or other abrasion-resistant material.

Foot Protection – Sturdy, over the ankle footwear that affords protection for the feet and ankles (durable leather or ballistic-type
cloth athletic shoes that cover the ankles may be worn). Sandals, low quarters, sneakers and similar footwear will not be used.

Visibility – Upper garments and backpacks with high visibility colors (fluorescent) during the day and retro-reflective material
during the night. A reflective belt around the backpack does not meet high visibility/retro-reflective requirements.

Highly Recommended PPE. The following items are highly encouraged in order to further minimize injury to riders:

Head Protection – Full face helmet and in ear hearing protection.

Protective Clothing – Jacket and trouser made for motorcycle use and a spine protector.

Visibility – Headlight and brake modulators, auxiliary running lights, and reflective tape on motorcycle.

Safety Training. Training applies to all military personnel who operate a motorcycle on a roadway any time, on or off-duty and
on or off military installations and all AF civilian personnel while in a duty status on official business, who operate a motorcycle
on a roadway, and all operators of a government owned motorcycle. AF civilian personnel duty status is defined for this training
as an AF civilian that has the riding of a motorcycle in their position description. Riding a privately owned motorcycle as
transportation to and from work or lunch isn’t considered in a duty status. Any other persons on base are not required to attain
any training other than applicable state/federal requirements.

Required Training. Attend and complete an approved motorcycle rider education course.

Recommended Training. Riders should complete an intermediate approved motorcycle course within 120 days after completion
of initial training. Riders should also attend and complete at least one approved motorcycle rider education course at intervals not
less than three years and not more than five years.

Mentorship Program. Unit mentors should identify with each of their riders and be aware of each rider’s skill set. One-on-one
mentorship rides should be used to encourage safety riding in less experienced or high risk riders.
552ACWI91-207 10 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                                                   9

Oklahoma Law. Local law should be reviewed by the individual or briefed to the individual by the unit motorcycle safety
representative. City ordinances vary from state law. Current as of the publishing of this instruction the following Oklahoma laws
are in effect as an example:

Registration does not need to be carried in the state of Oklahoma. Proof of insurance and driver’s license with “M” endorsement
must be carried.

In the city of Oklahoma City, it is illegal to have headphones on for listening to music while driving or riding.

Hazards Of Loaning/Borrowing And Renting A Motorcycle. Handling and balancing characteristics vary widely between
motorcycle types. Cruiser style bikes have a lower center of gravity (CG) than standards and sport bikes. Braking and
acceleration performance can also vary a great deal.

When loaning or borrowing a motorcycle the rider needs to be cognizant of the characteristics to expect from that particular
motorcycle. Effort should be made to slowly gain confidence in the unfamiliar machine.

Rented motorcycles leave the rider with no prior knowledge of the motorcycle’s service record or current state of repair. Most
rented equipment is abused and “close calls” that could have damaged an essential portion of the motorcycle, are rarely reported.
Riders must be vigilant to closely inspect the condition of a motorcycle before renting. It is recommended to use a TCLOCS
inspection (found on the MSF website) at a minimum.

Weather and Road Hazards. Potential hazards in Oklahoma are as follows:

Expect high gusty winds all year long. Normally from the north or south, the winds will be a direct crosswind on I-240 or I-40.

Street corners, on-ramps, and turn lanes will have dirt, sand, or gravel.

Rural areas present greater threat of wide life on road. Stray domestic animals also pose a threat especially in developed
communities.

Merging lanes are very short in Oklahoma, even at interstate intersections. The on ramp to I-35N from I-240E is particularly
dangerous.

Construction can leave raised edges or large holes in the ground.

Alcohol and Riding. Zero alcoholic drinks are recommended prior to riding a motorcycle, regardless of time in between the last
drink and the ride. Full alertness is required for riding. A2D2 and unit programs are available for rides home.

Recent Mishaps and Causes. Unit MSRs should brief riders on recent mishaps within the unit and across the wing. Wing safety
can provide sanitized copies of mishaps upon request.
