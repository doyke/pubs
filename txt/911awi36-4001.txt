1. OVERVIEW:
   1.1. The 911 AW Commander’s Coin Recognition Program provides an informal means to
   recognize individuals and small groups for one-time contributions of superior performance or
   personal effort.
   1.2. The Coin Recognition Program recognizes superior performance directly contributing to
   mission accomplishment in a manner not covered by any other 911 AW awards program.
2. RESPONSIBILITIES:
   2.1. G-Series commanders will approve all coin recipients.
2                                                               911AWI36-4001 18 JULY 2012


    2.2. G-Series commanders will ensure control of recognition coins and secure, track and
    document the presentation of coins.
       2.2.1. The coins used in this award program must be purchased with appropriated funds
       in accordance with AFI 65-601, Vol 1, Budget Guidance and Procedures.
       2.2.2. Coin inventory will be tracked by spreadsheet to include:
           2.2.2.1. Name and rank/civilian grade of presenter and recipient.
           2.2.2.2. Recipient organization.
           2.2.2.3. Date and purpose of award.
3. ELIGIBLE RECIPIENTS
    3.1. Any military member or appropriated fund employee assigned to Pittsburgh
    International Airport (IAP) Air Reserve Station (ARS), Pennsylvania. Commanders may
    approve, on a limited basis, the award of a recognition coin to an individual assigned outside
    their unit/installation providing they meet the criteria in paragraph 1 and have made a
    significant contribution to the mission of their unit; however, coins purchased with
    appropriated funds may not be given to non-appropriated fund employees. In addition, they
    may not be used as tokens of appreciation for government officials, foreign officials or non-
    federal personnel in recognition of general support or improved community relations. Coins
    for these types of officials, however, may be purchased with official representation funds for
    situations covered by AFI 65-603, Official Representation Funds – Guidance and
    Procedures, para. 4.
4. CRITERIA.
    4.1. The criteria to receive a Commander’s Recognition Coin are broad; however,
    commanders should limit awards to those who have gone above and beyond the normal call
    of duty. This program is established to recognize superior performance and recognition coins
    cannot, under any circumstances, be used as mementos.
