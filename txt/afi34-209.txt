This instruction implements AFPD 34-2, Managing Nonappropriated Funds. It assigns responsibilities
and explains financial management and accounting procedures for all Services (SV) nonappropriated
fund instrumentalities (NAFI). Funds managed by the Board of Directors, Army and Air Force Exchange
Service, chaplain funds, patrons' and prisoners' trust funds, private organizations' funds, and funds estab-
lished for employees of government contractors are exempt. While the financial policies and procedures
do not apply to private organizations, they may use them as guidelines.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS

                                                 Chapter 1

                       PRINCIPLES, STANDARDS, AND REQUIREMENTS

1.1. Accounting Entity. The NAF Accounting Office (NAF AO) summarizes financial accounting
results in terms of the entities that conduct the operation.
   1.1.1. Consider each NAFI (established according to AFI 34-201, Use of Funds) a separate entity for
   accounting purposes. Maintain asset, liability, and equity accounts at the NAFI-level. Use subsidiary
   records to reflect the location within the NAFI where the assets are used.
   1.1.2. NAFIs consist of one or more subdivisions called cost centers. Do not confuse the accounting
   term cost center with the operational term activity. Group financial transactions relating to one oper-
   ational activity (e.g., an NCO club) into one or more cost centers (e.g., bar, restaurant, snack bar, etc.).
   See AFMAN 34-214 for standard cost center codes and descriptions. These codes are used for
   accounting purposes only. They do not imply any organizational or operational relationship. AFSVA/
   SVF must approve, in advance, changes or additions to these codes. Use an optional third digit to pro-
   vide further subdivisions (if needed).

1.2. Document Flow and Control. The activity manager sends all accounting documents to the NAF
AO the next workday after the transaction date. Off-base sites submit accounting documents to the ser-
vicing NAF AO using a prearranged schedule.

1.3. General Ledger. The NAF AO maintains a separate general ledger for each NAFI. Air Force NAFs
use a uniform general ledger chart of accounts to summarize NAFI business transactions.
   1.3.1. General Ledger Account Codes (GLAC). AFSVA/SVF develops and assigns standard
   three-digit GLACs to identify general ledger and balance sheet accounts. AFSVA/SVF must approve,
   in advance, changes or additions to these codes. The NAF AO uses an optional fourth digit to provide
   increased detail data within the guidelines of each GLAC description. See AFMAN 34-214 for
   GLACs and descriptions.
   1.3.2. Authorized Changes. AFSVA/SVF approves, in advance, requests to combine history bal-
   ances of individual accounts.
   1.3.3. General Ledger Maintenance. The NAF AO maintains the general ledgers and prepares the
   financial statements. They post transactions to the general ledger each workday. Before publishing
   financial statements, the NAF AO:
       1.3.3.1. Includes information from other systems, such as Point of Sales (POS) systems, into the
       NAF accounting syste.
       1.3.3.2. Prepares adjusting and closing entries.
       1.3.3.3. Updates financial records.
       1.3.3.4. Reconciles subsidiary records to general ledger control accounts.
   1.3.4. The RMFC designates a central control point to compile all data for final processing. Before
   publishing the financial statements, the RMFC ensures that the NAF AO accomplishes the items listed
   in 1.3.3.paragraph 1.3.3.
8                                                                        AFI34-209 10 JANUARY 2005


    1.3.5. Subsidiary Records. The NAF AO keeps subsidiary records on balance sheet accounts. Rec-
    oncile the balances in these subsidiaries to the general ledger control accounts before preparing the
    financial statement. Automate the subsidiary records where possible. If the subsidiary records are not
    in balance to the general ledger control accounts, the RMFC annotates the financial statement before
    releasing to external users.

1.4. Nonappropriated Fund Standard Accounting Management System (NAFSAMS). A F S VA
maintains the standard Air Force accounting system. They provide centralized software development,
maintenance, and support. AFSVA releases software updates and is the single organization authorized to
change Air Force standard software.

1.5. Interim Financial Statements. The NAF AO prepares reports monthly and provides the informa-
tion to SV management. SV management uses the interim financial statement to assess each operation's
current performance. SV management uses the interim financial statements to plan for the future.
    1.5.1. Adjusting Entries. The NAF AO posts required adjusting entries before completing interim
    reports. Refer to AFMAN 34-214. Establish and use a checklist for all required adjusting entries and
    automated processing. Document and explain adjustments to the general ledger on AF Form 2541.
    The NAF AO prepares one copy of the form and retains the forms as backup documentation. Dispose
    of the form according to AFI 37-133V1, Records Disposition -- Responsibilities and Procedures. and
    AFI 37-133V2, Records Disposition--Standards. Number and control journal vouchers (JV) by
    NAFI. Enter the JV number on the transaction to provide an adequate audit trail. The RMFC or des-
    ignee (i.e., office manager) approves AF Forms 2541. Before approving, ensure that the NAF AO
    correctly prepared the entries and that explanations or backup documents have sufficient detail.
    1.5.2. Finalizing the Financial Statement. After the NAF AO posts all transactions to the G/L for
    the current accounting period, the NAF AO:
       1.5.2.1. Prepares a preliminary trial balance.
       1.5.2.2. Reconciles all subsidiary records.
       1.5.2.3. Prepares the final interim trial balance before the final closeout.
       1.5.2.4. Maintains the original trial balance.
       1.5.2.5. Provides each manager and the Nonappropriated Fund Financial Analyst (NAFFA) with
       a copy (or a copy of the interim financial statement).
    1.5.3. Financial Statements. The NAF AO prepares a final financial statement for each NAFI at the
    end of each accounting period after they have produced and reconciled the trial balance.

1.6. Fund Equity. The RMFC limits transactions into and out of equity to:
    1.6.1. Net income.
    1.6.2. Net losses.
    1.6.3. Approved prior year adjustments.
    1.6.4. Entries associated with the establishment, disestablishment, distribution, or redistribution of
    capital (see AFMAN 34-214).
AFI34-209 10 JANUARY 2005                                                                                9


1.7. Prior-Period Fund Equity Adjustments. The RMFC submits requests for prior-period fund equity
adjustments to SAF/FMCEB through the MAJCOM, AFSVA/SVF, and AF/SVF. The NAF AO records
the transaction only after SAF/FMCEB grants written approval. Footnote the financial statements with an
explanation of the cause of the adjustment. Refer to AFMAN 34-214 for additional details.

1.8. Reserving Fund Equity. The NAF AO establishes the following Reserved Equity accounts:
   1.8.1. Reserved Equity-Current Purchases. At the end of each accounting period, adjust this
   account to reflect the total value of all outstanding orders which have not yet been received. Include
   outstanding orders from all obligation documents, such as outstanding purchase orders, blanket pur-
   chase agreement (BPA) orders, and purchase requests for goods and services, including fixed assets
   on order.
   1.8.2. Reserved Equity-Capital Requirements. During the month of September for each fiscal
   year, close the current dollar amount in the reserved equity to Fund Equity-Prior Year and set up the
   dollar amount for the next fiscal year. As of 30 September this account should reflect one fiscal year
   of proposed capital requirements (for example 30 September 1993 would reflect a balance for FY 94).
   At any other time during the year, the balance reflects the amounts approved but not yet obligated for
   the current FY. The NAF AO posts a change to this account when:
       1.8.2.1. The NRB changes (part I that deals with capital assets).
       1.8.2.2. An activity orders a capital item.
       1.8.2.3. The fiscal year closes.
           1.8.2.3.1. At the close of the fiscal year, the NAF AO reduces the current balance to zero and
           establishes the amount for the next fiscal year based on Part I of the NRB.
           Base-level NAFIs record only that portion of their NRB that the base will fund.
              1.8.2.3.1.1. MAJCOMs record the dollar value of approved grants for NRB items which
              have not yet been paid.
              1.8.2.3.1.2. The MAJCOMs adjust these amounts as they transfer portionsof these grants
              to base level.
   1.8.3. Reserved Equity-Quantity (Bulk) Expendable Equipment. During the month of September
   for each fiscal year (FY), close the current dollar amount in this reserve equity account to Fund Equity
   - Prior Year and set up the dollar amount for the next fiscal year. As of 30 September, this account
   should reflect one year of proposed quantity purchases of expendable items (part II of the NRB) (for
   example 30 September 93 would reflect a balance for FY 94). At any other time during the year, the
   balance reflects the amounts approved but not yet obligated for the current FY. The NAF AO posts a
   change to this account when:
       1.8.3.1. The NRB changes (part II that deals with bulk purchases).
       1.8.3.2. The fiscal year closes . Follow the guidance in paragraph 1.8.2.1.
       1.8.3.3. An activity orders expendable equipment.
10                                                                       AFI34-209 10 JANUARY 2005


1.9. Income. Record income when earned. Record to the benefiting cost center, if practical and identifi-
able. Income collected before the accounting period in which it is earned is recorded as a liability. The
liability is transferred to income in the period in which it is earned.

1.10. Expenses. Record expenses when incurred. Record expenses to the cost center incurring the
expense, if practical and identifiable.
     1.10.1. Certain expenses, such as general advertising, depreciation on equipment for general purpose
     use, and accounting support service charge, are overhead expenses. The NAF AO posts these
     expenses to fund administration as defined in the cost center codes for A1-A9. Do not prorate those
     overhead expenses to other activities (except CCC A9 and certain marketing expenses as defined in
     CCC A5). Do not record identifiable activity operating expenses into the NAFI's fund administration
     cost center.
     1.10.2. Transfer merchandise, supplies, or services between activities at cost.

1.11. Grants. The NAF AO posts grants according to AFMAN 34-214.

1.12. Extraordinary Items. The RMFC submits requests to record any transaction as an extraordinary
gain or loss to SAF/FMCEB through the MAJCOM, AFSVA/SVF, and AF/SVF. The NAF AO records
the transaction only after SAF/FMCEB gives written approval. Attach a footnote to the financial state-
ments with an explanation of the cause of the transaction and its effect on current operations.

1.13. Contingencies. Contingencies are existing conditions, situations, or circumstances involving
uncertainty as to possible gain or loss. The NAFI ultimately resolves contingencies when one or more
future events occur or fail to occur. The RMFC works with SV management to determine the amount of
the loss contingency. The NAF AO post accruals for loss contingencies where the outcome is probable
and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Do not record gain contingencies in the financial state-
ments. When SV management identifies a contingency, the NAF AO footnotes the financial statements
explaining the contingency and the potential for gain or loss.

1.14. Assessments. The NAF AO posts Air Force assessments to the activity being assessed.

1.15. Command Lodging Fund (CLF) Procedures. The NAF AO posts transfers of cash from the
CLFs to base lodging funds and vice versa as transferred equity.

1.16. Morale, Welfare, and Recreation Fund Transfers. The NAF AO posts base or MAJCOM avail-
able cash transfers as transferred equity. When Air Force returns cash to the base or MAJCOM, each
level records it as transferred equity.

1.17. Accounting in Small NAFIs. The NAF AO maintains NAF accounting records on the accrual
basis of accounting, except as shown below.
     1.17.1. The IUF maintains accounting records on a cash basis if total revenue is less than $36,500 per
     year, and authorization is received from MAJCOMs.
AFI34-209 10 JANUARY 2005                                                                              11


   1.17.2. Small NAFIs that lack local accounting support, or those with limited programs such as MAJ-
   COM or remote site NAFIs, may not need all of the detailed accounting records and procedures
   required by larger NAFIs.
   1.17.3. Small NAFIs may use the cash receipts journal; check register; adjusting, closing, and revers-
   ing journals; and other general purpose journals as required to support their financial statements.

1.18. Major Command (MAJCOM) Supplements.
   1.18.1. MAJCOMs may supplement this instruction. AFSVA/SVF approves drafts of command sup-
   plements to this instruction before publication. The MAJCOMs furnish a copy of the final publication
   to AFSVA/SVF.
   1.18.2. BRFs or CWFs. Coordinate command supplements involving BRFs or CWFs with the BOD
   AAFCWF before submitting to AFSVA/SVF. Send one copy of each approved command supplement
   involving BRF or CWF to the BOD AAFCWF.

1.19. Requests for Technical Assistance or Waiver. Submit requests for clarification or interpretation
of this instruction through the MAJCOM/SVF or field operating agency (FOA) to AFSVA/SVF. Submit
each request for waiver, except those waivers authorized and granted locally according to AFI 34-201,
through the MAJCOM/SVF or FOA to AFSVA/SVF. Waivers granted according to AFI 34-201 must be
approved by the installation commander through the custodian, SV commander or director, as applicable.
MAJCOMs submit their requests for waiver concerning BRFs and CWFs to AFSVA/SVF through the
BOD AAFCWF, 21 Army Pentagon, Washington DC 20310-0021. In the request for waiver, outline the
problem, identify the specific requirement to be waived, recommend an alternative, and furnish complete
justification. Waivers to this AFI have no effect without a control number assigned by the approving
authority.
   1.19.1. Review waivers, at least annually or when conditions and circumstances change.
   1.19.2. Waivers are valid for a period not to exceed 3 years. At the end of the 3-year period, reevalu-
   ate waivers through the custodian, SV commander or director, MAJCOM, FOA, BOD AAFCWF, or
   AFSVA/SVF, as appropriate.
   1.19.3. All waivers in effect before the date of this AFI are void and must be reaccomplished.

1.20. Forms. AFSVA/SVFA approves request for changes to Air Force forms. SV may automate the AF
and NAF forms if form content and requirement do not change on a form.

1.21. Financial Management Training. The custodian conducts (or obtains) financial management
training as required for Services. The NAFFA provides financial management training as requested by
SV.

1.22. Program Training Aids (PTAs). Additional guidelines can be found under Financial Management
on the Financial Training Aids section located on the Air Force Services web site, www-r.afsv.af.mil. A
complete index of the PTAs can be found for various subjects.

                                                Chapter 2

                                       BUDGET PROCEDURES

2.1. NAF Budget Preparation Time-Frame. Prepare all NAF budgets annually before the beginning of
the FY. See AFMAN 34-214 for recommended NAF budgeting schedules and management responsibili-
ties.
     2.1.1. SV prepares Income and Expense (I&E) budgets and NAF Requirements Budgets (NRB) for
     each cost center within a NAFI.
     2.1.2. SV prepares cash flow budgets for each NAFI.
     2.1.3. The SV commander or director, or activity manager for BRFs and CWFs, makes recommenda-
     tions to the installation commander for requests to higher headquarters for NAF funding support.

2.2. Who Prepares the NRB. The activity manager prepares the NRB for a minimum of 5 years.
     2.2.1. Chapter 8 and AFMAN 34-214 defines each type of item included on this budget.
     2.2.2. See AFMAN 34-214 for preparation instructions.

2.3. Who Prepares the NAF I&E Budget. Activity managers prepare NAF I&E budgets for their activ-
ity. Activity managers use these projections, when compared to actual performance, to help identify spe-
cific areas where they need revised planning or corrective action in their operations. Activity managers:
     2.3.1. Develop financial objectives and goals with their flight chief and RMFC based on requirements
     of the SV commander or director or higher headquarters.
     2.3.2. Prepare realistic budgets for cost centers under their management.
     2.3.3. Justify their budget by explaining major changes in income or expense categories over the prior
     FY, seasonal variances, payroll computations, and departures from established standards or goals.
     2.3.4. Quarterly NAF Budgets. Although budget preparation is an annual requirement, we recom-
     mend that, as a minimum, activity managers update their projections each quarter, based on current
     performance and expected changes. This will maintain four quarters of budget data at all times. The
     RMFC consolidates these revisions to provide more accurate cash flow projections and trend analyses
     throughout the year.

2.4. Who Prepares the NAF Cash Flow Budget. The RMFC prepares an annual cash flow budget, with
quarterly projections, prior to the beginning of each FY. See AFMAN 34-214. The SV commander or
director and the RMFC use the cash flow budget to plan the use of cash resources while maintaining the
cash solvency of the NAFI.
     2.4.1. Revise this budget weekly or monthly as needed.
     2.4.2. Use historical balance sheet data, NRBs and I&E budgets to project cash flow for each NAFI
     over a given period of time. Show the desirable operating cash balance range and project the expected
     cash balance compared to that range.

2.5. Who Reviews and Approves the NAF Budgets. All levels of management take part in the review
and approval process once the activity manager completes the budget. AFMAN 34-214 details manage-
ment's responsibilities in this process. The installation commander approves the completed budgets for
all NAFIs.

2.6. Who Prepares the APF Budget. The RMFC works with SV management to prepare the APF Bud-
get. Activity managers prepare a separate budget (apart from the NRB) for capital items to be received
from APFs (see AFMAN 34-214). Activity managers, flight chiefs and the resource advisor review all
operational needs and capital requirements to identify those which can be purchased with APFs.
   2.6.1. If APFs are not authorized for a specific item, the activity manager includes the requirement in
   the appropriate NAF budget
   2.6.2. SV submits any capital or operational needs for which APF funding is authorized, but unavail-
   able as unfunded requirements in the APF budget. AFI 65-106, Appropriated Fund Support of
   Morale, Welfare and Recreation Programs and Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentalities, provides
   guidance on APF authorizations.
   2.6.3. SV obtains approval to use NAFs when APFs are not available for an item that is authorized
   APF support. See AFI 34-201 or 65-106. After obtaining approvals, remove the item from the APF
   budget and include it on the applicable NAF budget.

2.7. Budget Working Committee. The SV commander or director may establish a budget working com-
mittee to review and prioritize items on the NRB and to consolidate, by NAFI, the NRBs submitted by
activity managers. The committee prioritizes the consolidated NRBs to best meet the needs of SV and
best utilize available funds (see AFMAN 34-214).

2.8. Using the NRB.
   2.8.1. Who Approves Unprogrammed NAF Expenditures. The installation commander approves
   all unprogrammed NAF purchases, or delegates this authority (in whole or in part) to the SV com-
   mander or director.
       2.8.1.1. Advise the budget working committee, if established.
       2.8.1.2. Limit such purchases to emergencies. Nonavailability of APFs does not constitute an
       emergency. SV follows APF procedures to obtain the needed funds, or requests a waiver to spend
       NAFs (see AFMAN 34-214).
       2.8.1.3. Do not confuse the approval of unprogrammed NAF purchases with the purchasing
       authority as stated in AFI 64-301, NAF Contracting.
          2.8.1.3.1. Base Restaurant Fund Managers/Custodians and Base Civilian Welfare Fund Cus-
          todians submit their requests for unprogrammed requirements to their respective councils for
          approval.
          2.8.1.3.2. Once the installation commander approves the unprogrammed purchase, the activ-
          ity manager annotates the item on the NRB. The RMFC should include unprogrammed NRB
          items in the NAFI's cash flow budget once they are approved.
14                                                                     AFI34-209 10 JANUARY 2005


     2.8.2. Ordering NRB Items:
        2.8.2.1. The activity manager sends all requests to purchase NRB items to the RMFC, or desig-
        nee. Inform the RMFC, or designee, of any delays in ordering NRB items since this directly
        impacts cash flow. Time purchases to limit adverse impact on operations.
        2.8.2.2. The RMFC, or designee, reviews each request to purchase NRB items before buying to:
            2.8.2.2.1. Ensure the purchase is on an approved NRB or approved by commander as unpro-
            grammed. Record unprogrammed purchases in the minutes of the NAFs Council.
            2.8.2.2.2. Ensure appropriate approvals to spend NAFs are obtained if the purchase is autho-
            rized APF support.
            2.8.2.2.3. Ensure the purchase is included in the cash flow budget.
            2.8.2.2.4. Determine that enough cash is available to buy the item.
            2.8.2.2.5. Certify the availability of funds before obligating funds. The Base Restaurant Fund
            Manager and the Civilian Welfare Fund Custodian cer tify fund availability for their funds.

2.9. Who Revises NAF Budgets:
     2.9.1. NAF I&E Budgets and NRBs. Activity managers review their budgets at least quarterly.
     Request revisions, as needed, based on expected material changes and current activity needs (see
     AFMAN 34-214 for procedures). The installation commander approves revisions to the NAF I&E
     budget and the NRB.
     2.9.2. Cash Flow Budgets. The RMFC revises the cash flow budget as needed throughout the year to
     determine the effect of purchasing items on the NAFI's cash account.

2.10. Who Prepares the Financial Analysis. The NAFFA prepares an outside financial analysis at least
as of the end of each quarter. The RMFC coordinates on it. The SV commander or director decides which
NAF operations require more frequent outside analysis, and how often it is required. The RMFC keeps
the approved schedule in the life-of-the-fund file.
AFI34-209 10 JANUARY 2005                                                                            15

   the transaction only after SAF/FMCEB grants written approval. Attach a footnote to the financial
   statements with an explanation of the adjustment. Refer to AFMAN 34-214 for additional details.
   3.1.5. Extraordinary Items. The RMFC submits requests to record any transaction as an extraordi-
   nary gain or loss to SAF/FMCEB through AFSVA/SVF and AF/SVF. The NAF AO records the trans-
   action only after SAF/FMCEB grants written approval. Attach a footnote to the financial statements
   with an explanation of the cause of the transaction and its effect on current operations.

3.2. USAFA Cadet Dining Hall NAFI.
   3.2.1. Authority. This NAFI is established under the authority of DoD Instruction (DoDI) 1338.17.
   3.2.2. The NAF AO uses AFI 34-209, AFMAN 34-214, and AFMAN 34-215 to account for the cadet
   dining halls. When these directives conflict with DoDI 1338.17, the requirements in DoDI 1338.17

             COMMERCIAL CREDIT SYSTEMS AND MERCHANTS AGREEMENTS

4.1. Commercial Credit Authority. SAF/FMPB approves all commercial credit systems. SAF/FMPB
must consult with the Comptroller, Department of Defense, before issuing approval. Commercial credit
systems are not authorized in BRFs or CWFs. The RMFC submits requests through the installation com-
mander, AFSVA/SVF, and USAF/SVF to SAF/FMPB. See AFMAN 34-214 for detailed procedures.
     4.1.1. A commercial credit card contract replaces, in full or in part, the current accounts receivable
     and dues collection function for a NAFI or activity. AFI 64-301 contains a sample credit card contract
     format. See AFMAN 34-214 for additional procedures.

4.2. Merchant Agreement Authority. An activity uses a merchant agreement to accept one or more
nationally recognized credit cards from its customers. Merchants agreements are not authorized for BRFs
and CWFs.
     4.2.1. The installation commander approves the request to establish a merchants agreement and for-
     wards it to AFSVA/SVF.
     4.2.2. AFSVA/SVF approves the merchants agreement.
     4.2.3. The RMFC or designee should contact AFSVA/SVFBM if the agreement includes Electronic
     Data Capture (EDC) terminals or if a current contract converts from paper transactions to EDC. Con-
     tact them prior to issuing the Request for Proposal (RFP). AFSVA/SVFBM explains the various EDC
     applications and options available.
     4.2.4. The NAF AO does not issue locally drawn checks against a credit card account.
     4.2.5. The base NAFIs pay all fees associated with those types of accounts, except for account main-
     tenance and analysis.
     4.2.6. Activities accept major credit cards, if established for an activity, as specified by the contract.
     The NAF AO posts the expense of the service charge to the activity.

4.3. Advance Payments. AFSVA/SVPH gives advance approval to accept credit cards for advance pay-
ments. The activity manager submits approval requests to AFSVA/SVPH. Patrons can make a partial
payment on account with a credit card in advance without advance approval.
AFI34-209 10 JANUARY 2005                                                                                 17


                                                Chapter 5

                                              PROPERTY

5.1. Property. The NAF AO maintains accounting records and updates the subsidiary account for NAF
property transactions. This includes:
   5.1.1. Maintaining property records on all fixed assets.
   5.1.2. Processing payments to vendors.
   5.1.3. Preparing asset lists for inventory purposes.

5.2. Acquisition of Assets:
   5.2.1. The NAF AO posts transactions for acquisitions of assets in capital asset GLACs.
       5.2.1.1. Include all related expenses, such as freight, discounts and installation charges.
       5.2.1.2. Use the criteria in AFMAN 34-214 to determine whether you record an item in a capital
       asset GLAC or an expense GLAC. The purchase must cost $1,000 or more before the NAF AO
       capitalizes it. The asset must have a useful life of two years or more.
   5.2.2. SV acquires NAFI assets by several methods.
       5.2.2.1. NAF Purchases. NAF purchased fixed assets include those purchased with grant funds
       received from higher headquarters. (For grants relating to Base Restaurant Funds and Base Civil-
       ian Welfare Funds, refer to AR 215-7/AFR 176-14.)
       5.2.2.2. Donations. The NAFI acquires donated property at no expense from a source other than
       another AF NAFI. The donator must transfer title to the NAFI. The NAFI accepts donations as
       specified in AFI 34-201. The RMFC and activity manager, with the assistance of the DRMO or
       SCO, determine the fair market value of the donation. The NAF AO posts donated property at fair
       market value. If the donation qualifies as a fixed asset, post it as an asset in the financial records
       and depreciate it over the useful life.
       5.2.2.3. Inter and Intra NAFI Transfers. Any activity that transfers property completes AF Form
       2534, NAF Property Disposal/Transfer Receipt. The activity manager prepares an original and
       three copies of this form. Approval required by AFI 34-201 is adequate supporting documenta-
       tion. The gaining NAF AO receives the original AF Form 2534 and posts the transaction accord-
       ing to AFMAN 34-214. A copy is provided to the losing activity, the gaining activity, and the SV
       Chief Logistics Support Section (LSS). The NAF AO disposes of the form according to AFI
       37-138 and AFMAN 37-139.

5.3. General Services Administration (GSA) Seized Property. The NAF AO capitalizes acquisition
costs of $1,000 or more for GSA property. The property must have a useful life of two or more years to
capitalize these costs. See AFMAN 34-214 for detailed procedures.

5.4. Defense Reutilization and Marketing Office (DRMO) Property. The NAF AO capitalizes acqui-
sition costs of $1,000 or more for DRMO property. The property must have a useful life of two or more
years. Reference AFI 34-204 to determine the appropriate conditions to place DRMO acquisitions on the
Master Fixed Asset Listing (MFAL) and for managing, controlling, and disposing of DRMO property.
18                                                                         AFI34-209 10 JANUARY 2005


5.5. Leases. The NAF AO posts leases as either capital leases or operating leases. Use the criteria in
AFMAN 34-214 to decide if leases are capital or operating. Amortize capital leases over the life of the
assets. Post other leases as operating leases. Post rental expense when payment is made. See AFMAN
34-214 for detailed procedures.

5.6. Repair of Fixed Assets. The NAF AO capitalizes repair of any fixed asset when the repair costs
$1,000 or more. The repair must extend the useful life of the asset 2 years or more. If the repair does not
qualify, post the cost as an expense. See AFMAN 34-214.
     5.6.1. Equipment. Use the same property number with an alpha code A, B, C, etc., for the number of
     repairs. When the activity disposes of the property, the NAF AO writes off the related repairs.
     5.6.2. Renovations. The NAF AO writes off the undepreciated value of a previous renovation when
     a new renovation completely changes the previous one. Write off related renovations when an activity
     disposes of a facility.

5.7. Depreciation. The activity manager assigns the projected life for a fixed asset based on the depreci-
ation tables in AFMAN 34-214. The RMFC helps the activity manager to determine the projected life.
The RMFC and the civil engineers establish facility depreciation periods according to the depreciation
table in AFMAN 34-214.
     5.7.1. See AFMAN 34-214 for procedures on computing depreciation. The NAF AO posts deprecia-
     tion expense to the cost center where the property is actually used. Do not charge depreciation
     expense to an administrative cost center code except when one of the following situations apply:
        5.7.1.1. The operation's business office physically uses the property.
        5.7.1.2. More than one cost center uses the property. An example is a general purpose vehicle
        used by a club.
     5.7.2. The applicable activity manager determines whether or not fixed assets have a salvage value.
     The RMFC, DRMO, and the SCO help to determine the salvage value. The NAF AO uses these val-
     ues to determine the depreciable value.
     5.7.3. The NAF AO continues to post depreciation expense for NAF capital assets transferred to APF
     records until the items are fully depreciated. Post the depreciation expense in the transferring activ-
     ity's cost center.

5.8. Master Property Record Changes. The activity manager prepares an AF Form 2534 to physically
move property items between cost centers or to dispose of property by any method. Forward the com-
pleted form to the NAF AO. The NAF AO processes the transfer in the accounting records. A copy of the
Master Property Record Change list will be provided to the logistics manager. See AFI 34-201 and AFI
34-204 for additional procedures on disposal of NAF and DRMO property.

5.9. Trade-in of Assets. The NAF AO posts the disposition of the old asset using the normal process.
Post the newly acquired asset at its full cost (before trade-in). Post the trade-in value as a gain in the dis-
posed asset account. Trade-in value of old asset does not affect the acquisition value of the new equipment
listed in the property sub-system. For additional procedures, see AFI 34-201 and AFI 34-204 for manag-
ing, controlling, and disposing of NAF and DRMO property on the MFAL.
AFI34-209 10 JANUARY 2005                                                                                  19


5.10. Disposition of Assets. The NAF AO posts disposals of assets in the accounting system. Post any
gain or loss resulting from the disposal on the financial statement. Use this procedure for all assets includ-
ing those acquired by transfer or donation. See AFMAN 34-214 for detailed procedures.

5.11. NAF Fixed Assets Inventory. All activities physically inventory NAF fixed assets annually. Qual-
ified personnel from an activity other than the one being inventoried observe the taking of the inventory.
See AFMAN 34-214 for detailed procedures.

5.12. Acquisition of Expendable Items. Expendable items do not do not meet fixed asset requirements.
See AFMAN 34-214 for detailed procedures on acquisition of expendable items.

5.13. Government Loaned Aircraft. The NAF AO capitalizes initial repair costs to make government
loaned aircraft air worthy. The repair must cost $1000 or more. It must have a useful life of two years or
more. If it does not meet this criteria, post the repair cost as an expense.

5.14. Government Loaned Aircraft Engines. The NAF AO depreciates an aircraft engine only when
the old unit is removed from the aircraft and replaced by a rebuilt or new engine. Depreciate the replace-
ment engine only until the first overhaul is due or for a maximum useful life of three years.

5.15. Claims. AFSVA settles claims for insured assets that are destroyed or damaged. Once AFSVA set-
tles the claim, the NAF AO adjusts the affected accounts. Usually claim settlements do not exceed the
acquisition value less accumulated depreciation of the property destroyed (book value).

5.16. BRF/CWF. For acquisitions or disposal of assets belonging to a Base Restaurant Fund or Base
Civilian Welfare Fund, see AR 215-7/AFR 176-14.
20                                                                       AFI34-209 10 JANUARY 2005


                                                Chapter 6

                                     REVENUE TRANSACTIONS

6.1. Revenue Processing. Activities prepare AF Form 1875 to provide accountability for individual
cashiers. The activity prepares one copy of AF Form 1875 and keeps it in the activity. Activities prepare
AF Form 1876 or the daily cash reconciliation report (for lodging operations) to report deposits and con-
solidated income to the NAF AO. Prepare the AF Form 1876 in duplicate. Forward the original to the
NAF AO and keep one copy in the activity. Dispose of AF Form 1875 and AF Form 1876 according to
AFI 37-133V1 and AFI 37-133V2. Activity managers control ICRs and CCCRs according to AFI 34-202
, Protection of Assets. The NAF AO subsequently uses the AF Form 1876 to enter information into the
financial records. AFMAN 34-214 contains detailed accounting procedures.

6.2. Service Charge Procedures for Lodging Funds. When TLFs charge several different rates, the
NAF AO uses fourth-digit shredouts of the appropriate revenue GLAC to account for each rate within the
TLF cost center.

6.3. Monte Carlo Night. The NAF AO accounts for Monte Carlo as a resale operation.

6.4. Qualified Recycling Program (QRP). The NAF AO posts income and expenses to the QRP cost
center, if applicable. AFMAN 34-214 contains detailed accounting procedures.

6.5. Interest. AFSVA/SVF provides the interest rate paid on all cash within the CMIP and the amount of
any end-of-year dividend. The NAF AO posts interest income in the applicable NAFI's administrative
cost center code.

6.6. AAFES Simplified Dividend. The NAF AO does not accrue for distributions as they are made on a
current basis. AFMAN 34-214 contains detailed accounting procedures.

6.7. Operating Subsidies. The NAF AO posts subsidies from foreign governments as nonoperating
income in the applicable cost center. Post the associated expense to the applicable cost center.

6.8. Foreign Currency. NAF activities involved in accommodation exchange services buy foreign cur-
rency for resale at the wholesale rate established by the contracted military banking facilities (MBF) over-
seas. AFMAN 34-214 explains the computation.

6.9. Commercial Sponsorship Program. The NAF AO posts the sponsorship in the activity identified
by the vendor. Use the administrative CCC of that activity if appropriate. If the vendor does not specify
an activity, record the sponsorship in the NAFIs administrative CCC.

6.10. Randolph Sheppard Act-Vending Facility Program for the Blind. T h e N A F A O p o s t s t h e
NAFI's proceeds from vending machines as revenue in the applicable cost center. Show the payment to
agencies for the blind as expenses in those cost centers. Use applicable GLACs to record these expenses.
AFI34-209 10 JANUARY 2005                                                                         21


6.11. Slot Machine. The NAF AO posts slot machine income and expenses in the activity having the slot
machines. Use cost center codes A9, G5, W5, X5, Y5 and Z5 to record transactions involving slot
machine revenue and expenses. See the guidelines in AFMAN 34-214.
22                                                                      AFI34-209 10 JANUARY 2005

                                      ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE

7.1. Internal Accounts Receivable (A/R) Processing. The NAF AO maintains A/R subsidiaries except
for lodging funds. The NCR 9300 User's Manual contains instructions for processing A/R. AFMAN
34-214 contains other A/R procedures. If problems arise in balancing the general ledger control accounts
to subsidiary records, the RMFC or designee assists in reconciliation. If the NAF AO identifies variances
but cannot correct them prior to publishing financial statements, the NAF AO footnotes the financial
statements.

7.2. A/R Function Located Outside the NAF AO. AFSVA/SVF approves requests to locate the A/R
function outside the NAF AO. The RMFC prepares an A/R operating instruction (OI) for each approved
operation. Include instructions to ensure:
     7.2.1. The operating location reconciles the subsidiary record to the control account, as a mini-
     mum,before preparing the financial statement.
     7.2.2. The operating location prepares a proper aging of accounts receivable.

7.3. A/R Operating Instruction. The RMFC develops an OI to provide guidance on monitoring A/R.
Include guidance on:
     7.3.1. Follow-up actions
     7.3.2. Account write-offs.
     7.3.3. Procedures to prevent fraud by collusion (more than one person working together to cause the
     fraud).

7.4. Billing Cutoff Date. Activity managers and the RMFC attempt to establish a billing cutoff date
other than the end of the month. Do not make the cutoff date earlier than the 16th of the month. Ensure
this date coincides for all clubs serviced by the NAF AO. The NAF AO posts dues for the current month,
regardless of cutoff date, as of the 15th of the month (after posting all daily business for the 15th).
     7.4.1. Advance Dues. Customers may pay dues and fees in advance. See AFMAN 34-214 for
     details.

7.5. Minimum or Maximum Purchase Requirement for Extension of Internal Credit. The SV com-
mander or director approves minimum or maximum amounts that a customer may charge on internal
credit.

7.6. Scope of Credit. Members of clubs may use their membership cards in any MWR fund activity. See
AFMAN 34-214 for detailed A/R procedures.

7.7. Organizational Credit. The SV commander or director may authorize official organizations to pur-
chase through an open charge account from NAFIs. The NAF AO keeps written authorization (includes
project officer's name and number) on file.
AFI34-209 10 JANUARY 2005                                                                             23


7.8. Late Payment Charge. The MAJCOM/SV may authorize a late payment charge on member
accounts. Do not authorize more than $20 for any one delinquent cycle (60 and 90 days). The NAF AO
posts late payment charges as non-operating revenue to the NAF AO cost center to offset costs of collect-
ing delinquent accounts. Do not charge more than $40 for the entire delinquency period. See AFMAN
34-214.

7.9. Finance Charges. Do not charge finance charges or service charges (not to be confused with late
payment charges, paragraph 7.8.) for delinquent charge accounts.

7.10. Billing Receivables. The billing office prepares monthly statements, except where SV limits
charges to dues only. In that instance, the billing office is not required to issue monthly statements.
   7.10.1. The NAF AO may mail statements in bulk. Sort them by zip code.
   7.10.2. The NAF AO may place statements into Postal Service Center (PSC) lock boxes without post-
   age.

7.11. Reversal of Dues Incorrectly Charged. The NAF AO prepares the list with back-up documenta-
tion to request dues adjustments. If the NAF AO does not maintain the A/R subsidiary records, the activ-
ity manager of the operating location submits the list and back-up documentation to the RMFC. The
RMFC approves any dues adjustments. Once approved, the NAF AO processes the adjustment. See
paragraph 7.16. for procedures to write-off valid uncollectible accounts.

7.12. Collection Actions. The NAF AO performs collection actions except where waived. This does not
prevent activity managers from helping the NAF AO collect delinquent A/R.
   7.12.1. The NAF AO:
       7.12.1.1. Processes collection actions according to AFI 34-202.
       7.12.1.2. Maintains, controls and reports delinquent accounts and returned checks on AF Form
       1708. The NAF AO prepares one copy of the AF Form 1708. Complete the applicable blocks on
       the form each time a bank returns a check because of non-sufficient funds and whenever an indi-
       vidual makes a payment on a returned check. Total the form each month to help balance the
       Returned Check subsidiary. The NAF AO retains completed forms and disposes of the forms
       according to AFI 37-133V1 and AFI 37-133V2.
       7.12.1.3. Documents follow-up actions.
   7.12.2. The NAF AO does not delay the minimum follow-up actions required in AFMAN 34-214.
   The installation commander approves requests to shorten the time-frame in AFMAN 34-214.

7.13. Bad Debt Write Off Procedures. If the follow-up procedures prescribed in paragraph 7.12. and
AFMAN 34-214 are not successful, the RMFC begins write-off procedures as stated in AFI 34-202. The
NAF AO posts the bad debt write-off to the NAF AO cost center.

7.14. Commercial Debt Collection Contracts. RMFCs use the Air Force Nonappropriated Fund Pur-
chasing Office (AFNAFPO) procured commercial debt collection contract to collect past due accounts,
returned checks, and other debts owed to Air Force NAFIs. Use the contract for individuals where pay-
ment cannot be recovered through DD Forms 139, Pay Adjustment Authorization, or APF/NAF payroll
24                                                                       AFI34-209 10 JANUARY 2005


systems. See AFI 34-202. When an account is sent to the collection agency, the NAF AO writes it off the
financial statements. Record the bad debt write off in the NAF AO cost center.

7.15. Reinstatement of Membership Privileges. The SV commander or director approves requests for
reinstatement of membership privileges (see AFMAN 34-214).

7.16. A/R Aging and Reporting. The NAF AO prepares and reports aged A/R for all NAFIs and activi-
ties authorized internal credit systems. When a location outside the NAF AO maintains the A/R subsid-
iary records, the activity manager furnishes an aged A/R report to the NAF AO.

7.17. Dues Cutoff for Delinquent Accounts. The NAF AO does not post membership dues to a mem-
ber's account after 3 months dues have been posted and remain unpaid. The NAF AO can only charge up
to three months' unpaid dues in the following instances:
     7.17.1. A member has an MPO pending.
     7.17.2. A member turns in his or her club card and the member is three months delinquent when the
     card is turned in.
     7.17.3. A member leaves the base without clearing the club.

7.18. Allowance for Uncollectible A/R. The NAF AO posts bad debt expense at the end of each
accounting period. Post the estimated value of uncollectible A/R. Use the NAF AO cost center. Record
this same amount in an allowance for uncollectible A/R account. Base the estimate on the average
write-offs of A/R using historical data.
     7.18.1. Do not establish an amount that exceeds one percent of the A/R for the current period. If the
     estimate of average write-offs is greater than one percent, review collection procedures to ensure they
     are sufficient and timely.
     7.18.2. The NAF AO reduces the allowance for uncollectible A/R account when an actual account is
     written-off. If the write-off reduces the allowance for uncollectible A/R account to zero, expense any
     remaining amount to be written-off in the current accounting period.

7.19. Allowance for Uncollectible Returned Checks. If the amount of write-offs is not significant, the
NAF AO may post the expense at the time of write-off. If history indicates significant amounts writ-
ten-off, establish an accrual according to paragraph 7.18.

7.20. Accounts with Credit Balances. The NAF AO reviews accounts with credit balances at the end of
each accounting period. If the credit balances exceed five percent of total A/R due, the NAF AO posts
this amount in an unearned income liability account. Reverse the entry the following month. If the credit
balances are less than five percent of the receivables, net them in the A/R asset account.

7.21. Lodging A/R.
     7.21.1. Lodging personnel send statements to TDY personnel on the last day of the month for:
        7.21.1.1. Visiting officers' quarters (VOQ).
        7.21.1.2. Visiting airmen quarters (VAQ).
AFI34-209 10 JANUARY 2005                                                                             25


       7.21.1.3. Temporary lodging facilities (TLF).
   7.21.2. Send statements only if patrons used the quarters for 15 days or more and the anticipated stay
   during the succeeding month exceeds 15 days (see AFMAN 34-214).
   7.21.3. Collection actions required in AFI 34-202 remain the RMFC's responsibility. Use the
   time-frame in AFMAN 34-214 to complete follow-up actions. The Innkeeper processes collection
   actions on accounts that are 30 and 60 days delinquent. The RMFC ensures that the Innkeeper is per-
   forming collection actions in a timely manner. Once accounts become 90 days delinquent, the RMFC
   assumes responsibility for additional collection actions.

7.22. Returned Checks. For policy, follow-up, and collection procedures on returned checks, see AFI
34-202.
26                                                                     AFI34-209 10 JANUARY 2005


                                               Chapter 8

                         PURCHASE AND CONTROL OF MERCHANDISE

8.1. Purchase and Control of Merchandise. AFMAN 34-214 describes the required procedures and
related forms. The RMFC ensures that:
     8.1.1. There is a separation of duties between contracting and payment of accounts payable.
     8.1.2. Activities maintain adequate control over merchandise inventories.
     8.1.3. Activities maintain adequate control over the movement of such goods from one location to
     another.

8.2. Advance Payment Conditions and Authority. Certain businesses will not ship merchandise or
provide services until the NAFI pays for the goods either in a full or partial payment. The RMFC autho-
rizes advances or prepayments. The RMFC takes all steps available to prevent advances or prepayments.
Do not exceed contracting authority when authorizing advances or prepayments. Do not confuse advance
payments with situations where the vendor requires payment upon receipt of goods or services. See
AFMAN 34-214.

8.3. Overseas Shipments. The NAF AO accounts payable technician receives a vendor invoice and
proof of shipment from the vendor to request payment of overseas shipments. The NAF AO normally
processes this request before the activity receives the goods. The technician keeps an open suspense file
of all invoices paid on merchandise not yet received. Once the activity accepts the shipment and notes no
damage, forward the receiving document to the NAF AO. AFI 64-301 describes documents evidencing
proof of shipment.

8.4. Partial Shipments. The activity documents receipt of partial shipments on a DD Form 250, Mate-
rial Inspection and Receiving Report. The activity completes the form and writes Partial Shipment
across the top of the form. Annotate the form with the original purchase order (PO) number. Complete
the partial receiving report with the item number, quantity received, and description of items received.
Annotate the original PO to show items received in a partial shipment, the date received, and the date the
partial receiving report was forwarded to the NAF AO.

8.5. Value Added Tax (VAT). Under United States and Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) agreement,
authorized personnel may obtain exclusion from the German VAT if they make their purchases through
an official US government contracting activity at USAF Europe (USAFE) installations. VAT offices are
part of the MWR Fund. For currency conversion on VAT transactions, the NAF AO reimburses the Mili-
tary Banking Facility (MBF) the difference between the bulk rate and the wholesale rate for its monthly
VAT Deutsche Mark (DM) transactions. For procedures governing operation of VAT offices see USAFE
AFR 176-1. The base must operate this program to at least break-even.

8.6. Stock Records. The NAF AO uses the NAFSAMS inventory system to maintain automated stock
records to track inventory or highly sensitive items. Activities may use other automated systems to track
in-house inventories.
AFI34-209 10 JANUARY 2005                                                                              27


   8.6.1. The applicable activity manager maintains stock record cards on all transactions involving fire-
   arms. Report any discrepancies immediately to the RMFC.
   8.6.2. When using stock record cards, limit access to the cards. Secure records during nonduty hours.

8.7. Stock Levels and Reorder Points. The activity manager and RMFC establish stock levels and reor-
der points. The NAF AO may include reorder points in the inventory subsidiary.

8.8. NAF Transfer Between Cost Centers (TBCC). The activity manager or designee uses AF Form
2533 or an order entry form to transfer goods or stock between cost centers. The activity manager or des-
ignee may consolidate work orders to one TBCC. See AFMAN 34-214 for instructions on preparing the
AF Form 2533. Prepare the form in an original and two copies. Send the original to the NAF AO. The
issuing activity keeps copy one and the receiving activity keeps copy two. Dispose of the form according
to AFI 37-133V1 and AFI 37-133V2.

8.9. Stock Numbers and Standard Units of Measure. The NAF AO, with the assistance of the activity
manager, assigns stock numbers and standard units of measure to control inventories on all resale, store-
room merchandise and supply items. Use consistent numbers throughout all NAFIs. The activity anno-
tates the stock numbers on AF Form 2533 or uses order entry forms when transferring merchandise for
resale or promotion. See the NCR 9300 User's Guide for the list of standard units of measure and their
abbreviations used when processing inventory. Refer to AFMAN 34-214 for additional details.

8.10. NAF Interfund Purchases. The activity manager or designee uses an AF Form 1735 or order
entry form to order services or merchandise from other NAFIs. The ordering activity manager processes
and numbers IPOs or order entry registers. Prepare the AF Form 1735 in an original and three copies.
Send the original and one copy to the NAF AO and one copy to the selling NAFI. The ordering NAFI
retains one copy of the form. The RMFC signs the IPO unless purchase authority was delegated to the
ordering activity manager. The NAF AO processes the payment between the applicable NAFIs, using AF
Form 1804, NAF Interfund Dollar Transfer. Prepare one copy of the AF Form 1804. Retain it in the
NAF AO to support the payment. Process the payment not later than the following month (See AFMAN
34-214). Dispose of AF Form 1735 and AF Form 1804 according to AFI 37-133V1 and AFI 37-133V2.

8.11. Spoilage, Breakage, and Out-Dated Material. The activity manager determines the amount of
spoilage or breakage by incident, not by individual line item. The NAF AO posts reported losses in the
month of occurrence. AFMAN 34-214 contains accounting procedures.

8.12. Commodities. The activity manager controls commodities received through the United States
Department of Agriculture (USDA) Food Program. The requirements for ordering, receiving, and con-
trolling inventory and payment vary from state to state. The activity manager, appropriate flight chief,
and the RMFC, decide the method of inventory accountability. See AFMAN 34-214.
28                                                                       AFI34-209 10 JANUARY 2005


                                                Chapter 9

                               ACCOUNTS PAYABLE PROCESSING

9.1. Establishment of Accounts Payable. The NAF AO posts accounts payable transactions when an
activity has received goods or services on credit. The NAF AO makes payment to the vendor to clear the
accounts payable.

9.2. Documents and Entries. The NAF AO does not record an obligation unless orders or agreements
are in writing and supported by a receiving report (RR) or proof of shipment. Any activity using a POS
system to maintain perpetual inventory enters receiving documents into the POS system before forward-
ing to the NAF AO. Activities using POS systems forward documents to the NAF AO no more than 2
workdays after the receiving date.

9.3. Payable Suspense File. The NAF AO establishes a suspense file for all payables. The NAF AO sets
the file up to ensure they pay invoices timely and to help reconcile the subsidiary. The documents in this
file make up the subsidiary record of the general ledger control account. The total should balance to the
automated accounts payable subsidiary and the general ledger control account. After processing receiv-
ing reports through the payable system, file them in the suspense file for matching with invoices and mak-
ing payment.

9.4. Proof of Shipment. The NAF AO may need to pay vendors on shipment, rather than on receipt of
goods. Review the contract terms to determine if the vendor requires payment on shipment. See AFMAN
34-214 for guidance.

9.5. Vendor Invoices. The vendor mails invoices directly to the NAF AO. When the NAF AO receives
the invoice, the RMFC may provide a copy of it to the activity manager. See AF Form 2210, General
Provisions, for required information for a vendor to include on invoices. The NAF AO uses the invoice
as part of the documentation required for payment. Include vendor invoice numbers with the check to the
vendor. See AFMAN 34-214 for overpayments and minor errors on invoices.

9.6. Discounts. The NAF AO posts discounts by reducing the cost of the item purchased. Take all dis-
counts to which you are entitled. The discount period begins with the date of the contractor's invoice. For
the purpose of earning a discount, the day that the NAF AO issues the check is considered the payment
date. To comply with the Prompt Payment Act, mail checks to vendors on the same day they are issued.

9.7. Delivery Costs. The NAF AO posts freight costs to purchase expendable equipment, supplies, or
resalable merchandise as supplies expense or cost of goods as appropriate. Include freight, postage, etc.,
as part of the purchase price. Include freight cost associated with capitalized items (fixed assets) as part
of the acquisition cost of the asset.

9.8. Preparing Accounts Payable for Payment. The NAF AO matches vendor invoices with the
receiving reports. The activity manager or designee certifies AF Forms 1735 used to transfer merchan-
dise between NAFIs. No invoice is required for AF Forms 1735. Pay AF Forms 1735 using interfund
dollar transfers.
AFI34-209 10 JANUARY 2005                                                                               29


9.9. Documentation Required for Payment. The NAF AO usually requires three documents to sub-
stantiate payment to a vendor. They are: a contract, a receiving report, and a vendor invoice. The follow-
ing qualify as a contract:
   9.9.1. Purchase order.
   9.9.2. Blanket purchase agreement (BPA), or a call or delivery order written against an NPA, etc.
   9.9.3. A single document that constitutes a contract.
   9.9.4. When an Air Force agency or a utility provides goods or services, the NAF AO does not
   receive a formal contract (for example, commercial telephone service or purchases from the commis-
   sary).
       9.9.4.1. The NAF AO substantiates payments to government sources by their invoices and
       extended commissary subsistence requests (AF Form 287, Subsistence Request).
       9.9.4.2. The activity manager or designee certifies the government invoices and commissary sub-
       sistence requests.
       9.9.4.3. The designer certifies invoices for interior design contracts.
       9.9.4.4. The NAF AO uses the documents in this paragraph to support payment.
       9.9.4.5. The lodging fund may request customer refunds using SIMS check requests.
   9.9.5. Use of AF Form 2539, NAF Disbursement Request. Use AF Form 2539 instead of a pur-
   chase order, for items such as:
       9.9.5.1. Loan payments
       9.9.5.2. Registration or entry fees.
       9.9.5.3. NAF official travel.
       9.9.5.4. Tax payments and Internal Revenue Service payments.
       9.9.5.5. Workers' compensation claims.
       9.9.5.6. Payments to other government instrumentalities.
       9.9.5.7. Payments against special contracts, interior design, commercial telephone, utilities, etc..
       See AFMAN 34-214 for entertainers and NAF official travel.
       9.9.5.8. The person requesting the check completes one original of the AF Form 2539 and has it
       approved by the activity manager or designee, or the RMFC or designee. Forward the AF Form
       2539 and supporting documentation to the NAF AO so they can prepare the check. The NAF AO
       retains the AF Form 2539 and disposes of it according to AFI 37-133V1 and AFI 37-133V2.
   9.9.6. Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA). The NAF AO should pay amounts due vendors for
   calls placed against BPAs or interfund purchases monthly. This does not apply to meat or meat food
   products. Pay for meat or meat food products according to the Prompt Payment Act. See AFMAN
   34-214 for other requirements related to paying vendors on BPA.
   9.9.7. Signature Authorization. The RMFC or designee approves documents authorizing payments
   made from NAFs. The RMFC designates signature authority in writing. File the authorization in the
   LOF.
30                                                                     AFI34-209 10 JANUARY 2005


     9.9.8. Filing Paid Documents. The NAF AO marks all backup documentation by stamping it paid
     after making disbursements. File one copy of the check, with all backup documentation, in the
     accounts payable disbursements file. File these chronologically by vendor.
     9.9.9. Centralized Payment of Consolidated Purchases. A F S VA / S V F F p a y s v e n d o r s f o r
     AFNAFPO central buys and subsequently withdraws the amount paid from each base's CMIP
     account. See AFMAN 34-214 for details.

9.10. Prompt Payment Act (Public Law 97-177) Requirements. The Prompt Payment Act applies to
contracts awarded (including purchase and delivery orders), calls placed against blanket purchase agree-
ments, and blanket delivery orders, on or after 1 April 1989. The act also applies to contracts awarded to
foreign vendors outside the United States for work performed or supplies delivered outside the United
States. The act requires federal agencies to pay their bills on time, to take discounts when payments are
made by the discount date and to pay interest penalties when payments are late. AFSVA/SVF publishes
the applicable interest rate as required by the Secretary of the Treasury. The NAF AO must pay interest
penalties when due regardless of whether the vendor requests payment. Calculate interest on a 360 day
year. For details on the Prompt Payment Act, see AFMAN 34-214.
AFI34-209 10 JANUARY 2005                                                                             31


                                              Chapter 10

                                            INVENTORY

10.1. Inventory Maintenance. Activity managers control inventories at all times to prevent loss due to
spoilage, obsolescence, or theft. The NAF AO maintains inventory records by updating the system with
information from accounts payable, AF Forms 2533, or NCR order entry forms. To ensure the general
ledger and the actual inventory contain the same data, the RMFC may establish a cutoff date for inventory
related documents (see AFMAN 34-214). The types of inventories are:
   10.1.1. Central storeroom. The NAF AO accounts for inventory maintained in a central storeroom
   as an asset until the storeroom issues the inventory. Once the storeroom issues the inventory, the NAF
   AO posts the expense in the applicable GLAC using the applicable CCC.
   10.1.2. In-Use. Activities establish inventories for merchandise held for resale or consumption in
   sales outlets.
   10.1.3. Decentralized Storeroom. Activities establish decentralized storeroom inventories as:
       10.1.3.1. Backup stock for in-use inventories.
       10.1.3.2. High value or sensitive (such as POL and spare parts for aero club and slot machine
       operations) merchandise identified by management for additional control.
   10.1.4. Consigned Merchandise. The consignor establishes consigned merchandise inventory to
   control items received on consignment. When consigned goods are received, the NAF AO does not
   post the receipt of, or any obligation for, the consigned items in the financial records. The activity
   manager tracks and controls consigned merchandise according to the procedures in AFMAN 34-214.
   10.1.5. Fixed Assets. The MFAL includes all furniture, fixtures and equipment, and pilferable items
   from all sources, i.e., NAF, DRMO, etc. Show this inventory as the appropriate accounting type, i.e.,
   DRMO or NAF. Provide a complete MFAL to logistics and applicable managers, as a minimum, quar-
   terly. AFMAN 34-214 contains additional procedures.
   10.1.6. Inventory-In-Transit. The NAF AO records items purchased but received by an agent out-
   side the NAFI proper. When the NAFI receives the items, record in the correct accounts.

10.2. Establishing Inventory Dollar Levels. The SV commander or director approves maximum inven-
tory levels for each cost center (see AFMAN 34-214).

10.3. Review of Storeroom and In-Use Inventories. Activity managers review all inventories and
stock records to identify slow moving items and dead stock at least semiannually. The SV commander or
director may authorize below cost sales (not promotional) for slow moving or dead stock inventory items.

10.4. Inventory Schedule and Frequency. Activity managers submit completed inventory count sheets
to the NAF AO for extension. The NAF AO processes inventories promptly to obtain a dollar valuation
of the physical inventory for inclusion in the financial reports. The RMFC uses the physical inventory to
determine if variances exist and if analysis or investigation is required according to AFI 34-202.
   10.4.1. Activities inventory all food or beverage activities, pro shops, audio/photo and tickets
   monthly
32                                                                       AFI34-209 10 JANUARY 2005


     10.4.2. Activities inventory other resale merchandise including centralized and decentralized store-
     rooms and merchandise on consignment, as a minimum, at the end of each quarter.
     10.4.3. Activities inventory merchandise held for special events by type of event. Inventory includes
     items received from commercial sponsored occasions (see AFI 34-202).
     10.4.4. The activity manager inventories firearms daily. The activity manager sends an inventory as
     of the end-of-the-month to the NAF AO.
     10.4.5. The SV commander or director may allow any activity having a point-of-sale (POS) system
     that maintains perpetual inventory to take only an annual physical inventory. As a minimum, an inde-
     pendent observation team must observe the taking of the physical inventory:
        10.4.5.1. At the end of the FY.
        10.4.5.2. On change of activity manager (unless waived).
        10.4.5.3. When spot checks by the NAFFA indicate an inventory problem.
        10.4.5.4. When required by an Air Force Audit.

10.5. Change of Activity Managers.
     10.5.1. The NAF AO furnishes fixed asset property listings to the activity managers when manage-
     ment changes. Incoming activity managers must satisfy themselves as to the correctness of the prop-
     erty records. To verify the property records, the activity usually physically inventories the property.
     The incoming activity manager may waive this requirement. The NAF AO attaches the waiver to the
     change of custodian certificate (See AFI 34-204 and AFMAN 34-214 for details.)
     10.5.2. The incoming activity manager also checks correctness of decentralized storeroom or in-use
     inventories. See AFMAN 34-214 for details.

10.6. Change of Custodian (RMFC). Change of custodian does not require a physical inventory except
for NAF AO assets. Transfer inventories by exchanging receipts between the outgoing and incoming
RMFCs. (See AFI 34-204.)

10.7. Decentralized Storeroom (Aero Club and Slots Operation). See AFMAN 34-214 for decentral-
ized inventories for Aero clubs and slot machines.

10.8. Free Items or Donations. When vendors provide free items as bonuses or a purchase discount, the
receiver notes the free items on the receiving report. The NAF AO records free items on the inventory.
     10.8.1. If an activity receives donations for special occasions and gives them away, the activity man-
     ager accounts for these items without having the NAF AO process them through the inventory and
     cost of goods sold. The RMFC or designee examines all transactions involving donations to ensure
     that the activity manager accounts for the items received.

                                            CHILD CARE

11.1. Reimbursement for Child Care Food Programs (CCFP). The NAF AO posts income, accounts
receivable and subsequent reimbursement for child development program participation in the USDA
CCFP. The USDA administers the program in all states and territories through the state or regional office.
Follow regional USDA policies for completion and reporting purposes.
   11.1.1. Reimbursement Requests for Continental United States (CONUS) Bases. A t C O N U S
   bases, the child development center director or designee completes the required forms requesting
   reimbursements (using state provided forms). Send the requests to the NAF AO. The NAF AO rec-
   onciles the forms to the subsidiary record and forwards them to the state's office for the USDA CCFP.
   11.1.2. CCFP Sponsorship Family Day Care Providers. Air Force Child Development Centers
   (CDC) act as sponsors for family day care home providers participating in the USDA CCFP.
       11.1.2.1. USDA, through the sponsoring CCFP, reimburses family day care providers for part of
       the costs of providing nutritional meals and snacks to the children. The NAF AO does not issue
       IRS Form 1099 for CCFP disbursements to family day care providers for USDA reimbursements.
       11.1.2.2. The CDC receives compensation from the USDA to administer the program. The CDC
       can use the funds received from USDA to hire staff to administer the program.

11.2. Accounting for Child Care Service to Volunteers. The CDC or authorized family day care pro-
viders may provide child care services for volunteers when the volunteers serve the Air Force community.
   11.2.1. When the CDC provides child care services to volunteers, refer to AFMAN 34-214 for
   accounting procedures.
   11.2.2. The installation commander may approve, in writing, a specific number of family day care
   providers to care for children of volunteers when no space is available in the CDC. The NAF AO pre-
   pares a nonpersonal service contract, in advance, with the provider to specify the rate charged and
   other charges (for example, food, diapers). The NAF AO provides the day care provider an IRS Form
   1099 at year-end according to IRS requirements. The NAF AO includes on the IRS Form 1099 the
   amount paid to day care providers for volunteer care. Do not include amounts paid relating to USDA
   food reimbursements.

                                                Chapter 12

                                                REPORTS

12.1. Temporary Lodging Facility (TLF) Assessment.
     12.1.1. AFSVA/SVF advises the NAF AO of new or changed rates for assessment collection and
     reporting purposes.
     12.1.2. The NAF AO computes the TLF assessment. Do not count or include visiting officers' quar-
     ters (VOQ) and visiting airmen's quarters (VAQ) used for permanent change of station (PCS) families
     unless AFSVA/SVP officially redesignates them as TLFs. Post all income from such units in the
     VOQ or VAQ cost centers of the lodging fund. See AFMAN 34-214 for computation of the assess-
     ment. HQ AFSVA/SVF will pull the assessment based on the amounts recorded into GLAC 501 (a
     percentage of the income in the TLF cost center). Once HQ AFSVA/SVQA receives the RCS:
     HAF-MWR(Q)7407 report, they will verify the financial information. After verification, HQ
     AFSVA/SVF will pull the revenue from the base's CMIP account (40 days after the quarter just
     ended).

12.2. MWR Personnel Strength and Benefit Programs Report, RCS: HAF-SV(Q) 9485. The NAF
AO reports employee totals as of the last pay period of the quarter to HQ AFSVA/SVQA. Include foreign
national information that is not included in the US employees' payroll system. See AFM 176-378 for for-
mat. This report is designated emergency code C3. Continue reporting during emergency conditions,
delayed precedence. Submit data requirements as prescribed, but submission may be delayed to allow
higher precedence reports. Submit by nonelectronic means, if possible, during emergency conditions.

12.3. APF Support to Morale, Welfare, and Recreation (MWR) Activities, RCS:

nated this report emergency status code C2. Continue reporting during emergency conditions, normal
precedence. Submit data requirements as prescribed, or as soon as possible after submission of priority
reports. Continue reporting during MINIMIZE. For reporting CMIP transactions, follow guidance in
AFMAN 34-215.

12.5. Nonappropriated Fund Financial Statement Report, RCS: HAF-MWR(Q)7407. See AFMAN
34-214 for the format of the financial statement for all NAFIs. The OPR designated this report emergency
status code C2. Continue reporting during emergency conditions, normal precedence. Submit data
requirements as prescribed, or as soon as possible after submission of priority reports. Continue reporting
during MINIMIZE.
     12.5.1. The financial statement consists of four basic elements:
        12.5.1.1. Balance Sheet. The NAF AO prepares a report of assets, liabilities, and fund equity (see
        AFMAN 34-214).
AFI34-209 10 JANUARY 2005                                                                               35


       12.5.1.2. Income and Expense (I&E) Statement. The NAF AO prepares a consolidated state-
       ment of income and expenses for each NAFI and supports the consolidated statement with indi-
       vidual cost center reports. Use the same format for the consolidated statement and the individual
       cost center reports (see AFMAN 34-214). Report the amount of appropriated fund support pro-
       vided for each NAFI on the quarterly consolidated statement.
       12.5.1.3. Statement of Cash Flows (SCF). The RMFC or designee prepares this statement on a
       quarterly and annual basis. Prepare it either manually or by using an automated program.
       12.5.1.4. Supporting Schedules. AFSVA/SVF, MAJCOM, and local management may require
       supporting schedules to the financial statements. As a minimum, the NAF AO prepares the fol-
       lowing to support financial statements:
           12.5.1.4.1. Schedule of aged accounts receivable.
           12.5.1.4.2. A copy of AF Form 1736 to support the quarterly financial statement. See

           of AF Form 1736. Send one copy as a supporting schedule to the financial statement. Dispose
           of the AF Form 1736 according to AFI 37-133V1 and AFI 37-133V2.
           12.5.1.4.3. Special Morale and Welfare Expenditure Reconciliation. The NAF AO prepares
           the SM&W Expenditure Report for each quarter according to AFI 34-201. The NAF AO rec-
           onciles the SM&W report to cost center Q on the MWRF financial statement.
   12.5.2. Special Instructions, Frequency, and Distribution. See AFMAN 34-214 for special report-
   ing instructions for unit funds, subordinate commands, MAJCOMs, BRFs, and CWFs.
   12.5.3. NAF AOs transmit the Nonappropriated Fund Financial Statement Report (RCS:
   HAF-MWR(Q)7407 to MAJCOMs to arrive by the 15th calendar day after the quarter being reported.
   Each MAJCOM accumulates the reports from the bases and submits the Nonappropriated Fund
   Financial Statement Report (RCS: HAF-MWR(Q)7407) report to AFSVA/SVQ to arrive NLT the
   20th of the month after the end of each fiscal quarter. (See AFMAN 34-214 for format for submis-
   sion, MAJCOM submission and method of submission).

12.6. Quarterly Prompt Payment Report, PPA Report, ACCT RPT (Q)1619. N A F A O s p r e p a r e

                                              Chapter 13

             DEPOSITS, CHECK WRITING, AND CONTROL OF CHECK STOCK

13.1. Deposit Slips. The NAF AO receives the numbered deposit slips (validated and unvalidated) for
CMIP processing. If the NAF AO receives an unvalidated deposit slip, suspense it until the bank sends a
validated copy. The NAF AO should receive the validated deposit slip within 3 days after the day of busi-
ness. Immediately notify the office manager of any variances between the suspensed deposit slip and the
validated deposit slip when received. If the NAF AO finds a difference in the amount actually deposited,
process a deposit adjustment to the general ledger and CMIP.

13.2. Bank Fees and Charges. The NAF AO posts bank fees and charges to the NAFI's administrative
cost center. Include those items that are not identified to a patron. This includes fees for deposit bags,
keys or deposit slips and re-presented check fees absorbed by the NAFI (does not include return check
service charge). It also includes the fee paid for armored car service.

13.3. Check Writing Function.
   13.3.1. Check Number Control Log. The NAF AO maintains a log (either manual or automated) of
   all checks (written and voided) and related information for general, payroll, limited payee checks.
   13.3.2. Check Writing. The NAF AO reports checks written to AFSVA/SVFB through CMIP trans-
   mission. Under CMIP, the NAF AO prepares all checks except payroll from a single general check
   stock. The individual responsible for check writing (check writer):
       13.3.2.1. Uses checks in numerical sequence.
       13.3.2.2. Writes checks for individual NAFIs and identifies the NAFI on each check. Include the
       NAF ID on each check stub (except payroll).
       13.3.2.3. Spells out the dollar amount for checks typed manually or processes them through a
       check protector. They should not contain typing errors or strikeouts.
       13.3.2.4. General Checks. The NAF AO normally writes checks on a weekly or biweekly basis
       to ensure compliance with the Prompt Payment Act requirements. The NCR 9300 automatic
       check generation program normally generates these checks. However, the NAF AO may prepare
       handwritten checks for out-of-cycle payments.
       13.3.2.5. Foreign Currency Checks. Overseas locations use foreign currency and limited payee
       checks. The NAF AO uses a foreign currency checking account, established in a military banking
       facility in the overseas area, to satisfy local requirements for foreign currency and to make dis-
       bursements that require this medium of exchange. Use limited payee checks (LP) for change
       funds and accommodation sales (see AFI 34-202).
   13.3.3. Distribution of Checks and Paid Documents. The check writer returns the signed checks
   with supporting documents to the accounts payable technician for distribution. AFMAN 34-214 con-
   tains mail, retention, and distribution instructions.

13.4. Control of Blank Check Stock. The NAF AO stores blank checks in a locked container or safe.
Use DD Form 2661, Spoiled/Control Check Record, to record receipt, issue, return, balance on hand,
and spoiled or voided checks. Maintain a separate check control record for each type of check.
38                                                                  AFI34-209 10 JANUARY 2005


     13.4.1. NAFIs not under CMIP obtain check stock from normal commercial sources.

13.5. Destruction of Blank Check Stocks. When a blank stock of checks needs to be destroyed, two
individuals independent of the check writing function witness the destruction (see AFMAN 34-214). The
NAF AO notifies AFSVA/SVFB of the destruction according to AFMAN 34-214.
AFI34-209 10 JANUARY 2005                                                                            39

                              MISCELLANEOUS TRANSACTIONS

14.1. Aero Club Liability Insurance Expense. The NAF AO computes liability insurance premiums
for Aero Club aircraft based on the number of flying hours per aircraft. See AFMAN 34-214.

14.2. Aero Club Hull Insurance. The NAF AO computes hull insurance based on the declared value of
each aircraft. See AFMAN 34-214.

14.3. Workers' Compensation (WC). The Payroll Retrieval Interface to General Ledger (PRIGL) pro-
gram computes the accrued WC expense and produces the journal entries used to update the financial
records. The PRIGL computes premiums based on US civilian gross payroll. The NAF AO posts the pre-
mium expense by the end of each accounting period to each applicable cost center. See AFMAN 34-214.

14.4. Unemployment Compensation (UC). The PRIGL computes the accrued UC expense and pro-
duces the journal entries used to update the financial records. The PRIGL program computes premiums
base on US civilian payroll. The NAF AO posts the premium expense by pay period to each applicable
cost center where personnel are assigned. See AFMAN 34-214.

14.5. Asset and Liability Insurance. The NAF AO records premiums at the end of each accounting
period based on balances from the quarterly 7407 report (RCS: HAF-MWR(Q)7407). Use the fund
administration cost center for each NAFI.
   14.5.1. Asset Computation. The NAF AO computes asset premium payments based on the book
   value of assessable assets.
   14.5.2. Liability Computation. The NAF AO computes liability premium payments based on the
   total gross income for each applicable NAFI.

14.6. Group Life Accidental Death and Dismemberment and Comprehensive Medical Expense
Insurance Program. The PRIGL computes the employer's share of the Insurance Program. The NAF
AO posts this expense each pay period to the respective cost center where personnel are assigned. Trans-
fer the total employee and employer share of group insurance to the MWR fund. The NAF AO makes
payment from the MWR fund to the Air Force Insurance Fund (AFIF) through CMIP.

14.7. Retirement Program. The PRIGL computes the employee's contribution of retirement and trans-
fers it to the MWR fund. The NAF AO makes payment from the MWR fund to the Air Force Retirement
Fund (AFRF) through CMIP.

14.8. Reimbursements from MAJCOMs. When MAJCOMs authorize reimbursements, the NAF AO
does not net the reimbursement into the expense account. Record the expense in full on the NAFI's books.
The MAJCOM does not reimburse for more than 100 percent of the actual cost.

14.9. Procedures for Aero Club Accruals. The NAF AO accrues the anticipated engine overhaul or
replacement cost monthly. NAF AOs should also establish accruals in Aero Clubs for any other planned
major maintenance such as repainting aircraft. To account for accrued maintenance, the NAF AO keeps
40                                                                       AFI34-209 10 JANUARY 2005


two separate subsidiary ledgers, one for engine overhaul and one for other planned maintenance. See
AFMAN 34-214.

14.10. Promotions. An activity uses the entertainment and promotional expense GLACs to separate the
expense of such programs. Use these accounts for programs or events held to further the growth or devel-
opment of that activity. The NAF AO posts expenses for goods and or supplies only when an activity spe-
cifically advertises the items in connection with a promotion, or the item is used during a free program.
Transfer labor expenses only if an activity specifically schedules labor that is used in conjunction with the
promotion or giveaway. Post the cost of the entertainment or promotion to the activity receiving the ben-
efit. See AFMAN 34-214 for additional details.

14.11. Severance Pay. The NAF AO accrues obligations for severance pay due employees according to
AFMAN 34-214. Accrue severance for NAF foreign national employees during the period in which the
entitlement is earned, whether or not the amount is currently payable. For other NAF employees, sever-
ance accrual begins when the NAFI knows it will incur such a liability in the future (for example, when
announced for closure or major realignment). Set aside funds in the severance benefits investment pro-
gram to pay for future liabilities. Contact AFSVA/SVF to establish a severance benefits investment
account.

       NONAPPROPRIATED FUND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTING
10 JANUARY 2005
SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This change incorporates interim change (IC) 2005-01 which updates AFI 34-209 to comply with AFI
34-204, Services Property Management. A "|" indicates revised material since the last edition.
1.22. Program Training Aids (PTAs). Additional guidelines can be found under Financial Management
on the Financial Training Aids section located on the Air Force Services web site, www-r.afsv.af.mil. A
complete index of the PTAs can be found for various subjects.
5.2.2.3. Inter and Intra NAFI Transfers. Any activity that transfers property completes AF Form 2534,
NAF Property Disposal/Transfer Receipt. The activity manager prepares an original and three copies of
this form. Approval required by AFI 34-201 is adequate supporting documentation. The gaining NAF AO
receives the original AF Form 2534 and posts the transaction according to AFMAN 34-214. A copy is
provided to the losing activity, the gaining activity, and the SV Chief Logistics Support Section (LSS).
The NAF AO disposes of the form according to AFI 37-138 and AFMAN 37-139.
5.4. Defense Reutilization and Marketing Office (DRMO) Property. The NAF AO capitalizes acquisi-
tion costs of $1,000 or more for DRMO property. The property must have a useful life of two or more
years. Reference AFI 34-204 to determine the appropriate conditions to place DRMO acquisitions on the
Master Fixed Asset Listing (MFAL) and for managing, controlling, and disposing of DRMO property.
5.8. Master Property Record Changes. The activity manager prepares an AF Form 2534 to physically
move property items between cost centers or to dispose of property by any method. Forward the com-
pleted form to the NAF AO. The NAF AO processes the transfer in the accounting records. A copy of the
Master Property Record Change list will be provided to the logistics manager. See AFI 34-201 and AFI
34-204 for additional procedures on disposal of NAF and DRMO property.
5.9. Trade-in of Assets. The NAF AO posts the disposition of the old asset using the normal process. Post
the newly acquired asset at its full cost (before trade-in). Post the trade-in value as a gain in the disposed
asset account. Trade-in value of old asset does not affect the acquisition value of the new equipment listed
in the property sub-system. For additional procedures, see AFI 34-201 and AFI 34-204 for managing,
controlling, and disposing of NAF and DRMO property on the MFAL.
10.1.5. Fixed Assets. The MFAL includes all furniture, fixtures and equipment, and pilferable items from
all sources, i.e., NAF, DRMO, etc. Show this inventory as the appropriate accounting type, i.e., DRMO or
NAF. Provide a complete MFAL to logistics and applicable managers, as a minimum, quarterly. AFMAN
34-214 contains additional procedures.
10.5.1. The NAF AO furnishes fixed asset property listings to the activity managers when management
changes. Incoming activity managers must satisfy themselves as to the correctness of the property
records. To verify the property records, the activity usually physically inventories the property. The
incoming activity manager may waive this requirement. The NAF AO attaches the waiver to the change
of custodian certificate (See AFI 34-204 and AFMAN 34-214 for details.)

10.6. Change of Custodian (RMFC). Change of custodian does not require a physical inventory except
for NAF AO assets. Transfer inventories by exchanging receipts between the outgoing and incoming
RMFCs. (See AFI 34-204.)
