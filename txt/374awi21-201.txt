5. Procedures. Elements and individuals that work with countermeasure munitions will use the
following procedures:
     5.1. Delivery: ECM personnel request delivery through MXS-10. The Munitions Flight will
     then dispatch the requested countermeasure munitions to the flight line. Munitions personnel
     will annotate the munitions delivery on the AF Form 4331 and ensure only authorized
     personnel sign for munitions.
     5.2. Return:
         5.2.1. ECM personnel will download expenditures as required based on expenditure
         levels established by the Wing/Squadron Weapons Officer. When magazines are
         downloaded, ECM personnel will complete an AF Form 2434 with expenditure
         information as stated in paragraph 4.4.5.
         5.2.2. ECM personnel will inform MXS 10 when assets are ready for pick up. The
         Munitions Flight will then return all downloaded munitions from the flight line back to
         the MSA for processing.
     5.3. Reconciliation: Countermeasures will be reconciled when returned to the munitions
     processing facility. Reconcile countermeasure munitions using the following procedures:
         5.3.1. The Munitions Flight will return all downloaded magazines to the MSA for
         inspection and verification against the AF Form 2434 received from ECM personnel.
         5.3.2. Upon return to the MSA, the munitions will be 100% inspected for expenditures
         by munitions personnel. If a discrepancy between actual expenditures and AF Form 2434
         is discovered, Munitions Flight personnel will contact 374 AMXS Production
         Superintendent to rectify the discrepancy. No munitions will be delivered until the
         discrepancy is resolved.
         5.3.3. Upon completion of reconciliation, the munitions inspector will clear expenditures
         from the worktable.
         5.3.4. Chaff/flare will be expended from the CAS database using procedures outlined in
         AFI 21-201, Conventional Munitions Maintenance Management.
         5.3.5. During extended downtime of CAS during contingencies, the Munitions Flight
