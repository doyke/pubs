                                   Preface
Force protection is a commander’s top priority in any military operation. For
this reason, civil engineers must always be aware of the latest tactics, tech-
niques, and procedures (TTPs) used to protect our forces, particularly in hos-
tile environments. Engineers implement physical security measures to protect
personnel and critical assets needed to achieve military objectives. To assist
in these efforts, this handbook is intended to be a reference for constructing
and employing expedient fighting positions, obstacles, shelters, and revet-
ments. It focuses primarily upon measures engineers can employ to protect
airbases and mitigate the effects of direct- and indirect-fired weapons. This
handbook should be used in conjunction with AFH 10-222, Volume 3, Civil
Engineer Guide to Expeditionary Force Protection, as well as other 10-222
series AF Handbooks and 10-219 series AF Pamphlets. Although many of the
TTPs described are designed to protect critical resources through hardening
and the use of obstacles, commanders must not lose sight of the fact that
standoff provides the best chance of success in protecting the force. In addi-
tion to the information contained in the aforementioned publications, civil
engineers should be familiar with the security engineering series of Unified
Facilities Criteria (UFC) and the latest guidance provided by those organiza-
tions constantly testing materials and designs to provide better protection for
our military forces. These include organizations such as the Air Force Re-
search Laboratory (AFRL) and the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE)
Protective Design Center (PDC). This handbook does not address TTPs de-
signed to defeat the vehicle-borne improvised explosive device (VBIED)
threat. The Air Force Battlelab, through extensive testing, developed an ex-
cellent handbook for this purpose. AFH 10-2401, Vehicle Bomb Mitigation
Guide (FOUO), focuses on the threat of VBIED attacks and describes the
latest TTPs that can be employed to defeat this tactic. This handbook does not
contain information for designing collective protection shelters. This informa-
tion can be found in AFMAN 10-2502 series publications and USACE Engi-
neering Technical Letters (ETLs) 1110-3-490 and 1110-3-498. USACE ETLs
can be downloaded from http://www.usace.army.mil/.

                                 Chapter 1
                            INTRODUCTION
1.1. Overview. Although tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used in
modern warfare have evolved throughout history, the basic concepts of de-
fense and the use of earthworks remain critical elements of force protection
(FP). Historically, earthworks consisted of three parts: a ditch or trench, a
short mound of earth material (a parapet) on the enemy side of the ditch to
disrupt the enemy’s flow, and a higher mound on the defenders’ side of the
ditch for protection and to cover troop movements (Figure 1.1). Earthworks
were often reinforced with wood, stone, and rocks and fortified with stakes to
provide additional obstacles to slow down the enemy’s approach or defend
against larger weapons like the catapult and cannon. This concept of defense
and other methods of fortification carry over to modern uses of earthworks.
The TTPs covered in this handbook relate to the construction and employ-
ment of defensive fighting positions, protective shelters, obstacles, and re-
vetments. Although the TTPs are aimed at mitigating the effects of blast and
fragmentation effects from conventional weapons, many of these measures
can also provide protection against the effects of nuclear weapons. However,
refer to AFTTP(I) 3-2.46, Multiservice Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures
for Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical (NBC) Protection, for guidance on
constructing fighting positions and using existing shelters for protection
against NBC effects. Before protective measures can be employed effectively
in an expeditionary environment, it is necessary to understand the threat.

1.2. The Threat. Direct- and indirect-fired weapons are common threats to
airbases. Direct-fired weapons are projectiles designed to penetrate exterior
protection. These weapons are highly accurate and capable of firing different
types of projectiles including: (1) chemical or kinetic energy projectiles, (2)
ball or tracer rounds, and (3) armor piercing rounds or high explosive shaped
charges. Indirect-fired weapons include mortars, artillery shells, rockets, and
bombs. These types of weapons are highly mobile and easily concealed. They
can be fired from launchers or set on timers to allow aggressors time to es-
cape prior to launch. Indirect-fired weapons do not require a clear line of
sight to a specific target; aggressors rely on blast and fragmentation effects to
damage or destroy their intended targets. Table 1.1 lists typical weapons and
describes their effects. Planners must consider these potential threats.
Table 1.1. Typical Weapons and Their Effects.
              Weapon                                     Effects

munitions, incendiary, demolition      gen deprivation, in-structure shock, crater-
charges, etc.                          ing, ground shock.

1.2.1. Blast and Fragmentation Effects. Exploding munitions produce ex-
treme hazards such as blast and fragmentation. Mitigating the effects of these
weapons must be a top priority for civil engineers during contingencies. Bed-
down and sustainment efforts might become futile if the force itself is vulner-
able to a potentially devastating attack. Blast and fragmentation effects are
briefly described in the following paragraphs.
AFH 10-222 Volume 14 1 August 2008                                          13


1.2.1.1. Blast Effects. Explosive charges release an enormous amount of en-
ergy instantaneously through thermal radiation and shock waves. The shock
wave is a compression wave that causes the atmospheric pressure to rise
(overpressure) and peak in a fraction of a microsecond, followed by a slower
(hundredths of a second) decline in atmospheric pressure, referred to as the
positive phase of the shock wave. The pressure continues to decline to subat-
mospheric pressure (negative phase of the shock wave), and then returns to
normal (Figure 1.2). The positive impulse (intense pressure), represented by
the area below the positive phase of the pressure-time curve, causes serious
damage and destruction. It is important to know that blasts from high-
explosive shells or rockets occur in three distinct ways: (1) overhead burst
from artillery, which can destroy structures from the top; (2) contact burst;
artillery shells that explode upon impact, causing excavations and other struc-
tures to collapse from ground shock or foundation instability; and (3) delay
fuze bursts, which are projectiles designed to penetrate a target before deto-
nating. Information on the effects of blasts on all types of structures can be
found on the USACE PDC website at https://pdc.usace.army.mil.

AFH 10-222 Volume 14 1 August 2008                                           14


1.2.1.2. Fragmentation Effects. Fragmentation effects of weapons are char-
acterized as either primary or secondary fragmentation. Fragmenting weapons
are designed to propel debris from their casings (primary fragmentation) to-
wards a target to damage or destroy it. Secondary fragmentation is caused
when the force of a blast causes objects to break apart, propelling additional
debris towards critical assets at extremely high velocities. The following
paragraphs explain these effects in more detail.
1.2.1.2.1. Primary Fragmentation. Primary fragmentation is caused by the
breakup or shattering of weapon casings upon detonation. The steel casings
of fragmenting weapons are designed to produce a mass amount of debris
traveling at a high rate of speed (thousands of feet per second) when the pro-
jectile detonates and disintegrates. Fragmentation effects caused by detona-
tion of a high-explosive bomb have a greater effective range than blast ef-
fects. These types of weapons are very effective against unprotected person-
nel and other soft targets. The destructive power of fragmenting weapons is
maximized by using bombs specifically designed to achieve this effect or by
using bombs with airburst functioning fuzes. Although fragmentation effects
can be mitigated by well-designed obstructions on the ground, planners must
also consider the effect of a direct hit or an airburst.
1.2.1.2.2. Secondary Fragmentation. Secondary fragmentation is caused
when blast pressure from a weapon detonation exerts enough force upon ex-
isting structures in close proximity to cause the structure to break apart and
become additional projectiles traveling at high rates of speed. Although it
may be impractical to harden temporary structures to resist the effects of blast
or fragmentation without sufficient standoff, properly constructed protective
structures such as berms and revetments can provide some degree of protec-
tion without posing the risk of becoming fragmentation hazards themselves.
To be effective, berms and revetments must be properly sited in relation to
the assets they are intended to protect. Siting and constructing berms and re-
vetments are covered in more detail in Chapter 5 of this handbook.
AFH 10-222 Volume 14 1 August 2008                                             15


1.3. Planning. Civil engineers must develop plans to employ physical secu-
rity measures designed to mitigate the effects of an enemy attack. This is a
unique challenge in the expeditionary environment, since mobility assets are
usually not designed to be capable of withstanding attacks from different
types of weapons. For this reason, standoff, modern application of earth-
works, and other expedient methods are used to counter known threats.

1.3.1. Planning Factors. Some key factors engineers consider while planning
for physical security include desired levels of protection, potential threats,
criticality and vulnerability assessments, and acceptable levels of risk. In ad-
dition, planners must take into account the type of structures to be deployed,
available funding, existing infrastructure (including natural and manmade
features), available standoff, and local resources available, such as contract
support and indigenous construction materials. These factors, and any others
unique to the deployed location, form the basis for force protection planning.

1.3.2. Levels of Protection. Physical security measures are employed to ob-
tain certain levels of protection. These protection levels are usually based
upon known threats and the results of intelligence and assessment reports. It
is unrealistic to believe all assets can be protected and the threat completely
eliminated. This perception causes valuable resources to be wasted or misal-
located. Risk management is based on the assumption that some risks must be
taken to ensure limited resources are applied against the highest priority as-
sets first, rather than all assets equally. Criticality assessments usually result
in the assignment of certain values to particular assets. They reveal the degree
of debilitating impact that destruction of certain assets would have upon the
mission; obviously, personnel come first. Unacceptable losses require higher
levels of protection. Assets most critical to the mission must be afforded
higher levels of protection, especially if vulnerability assessments indicate
these assets are not already sufficiently protected. Different levels of protec-
tion are described in UFC 4-020-01, DOD Security Engineering Facilities
Planning Manual. The following paragraphs cover the assessments usually
conducted to assist commanders in determining levels of protection.
AFH 10-222 Volume 14 1 August 2008                                           16


1.3.3. Threat Assessment. This assessment is used to identify threats based
on key factors such as the existence, capability, and intentions of potential
hostile forces and terrorist groups. Group activities and the operational envi-
ronment are also considered. Potential threats are categorized in various ways
(e.g., terrorists, saboteurs, spies, extremists, criminals). Any weapons, tools,
and explosives likely to be used in an attack upon DOD personnel or critical
assets are also identified during the assessment.
1.3.4. Criticality Assessment. The criticality assessment is the process used
to systematically identify key assets (e.g., personnel, equipment, stockpiles,
buildings) deemed mission critical by commanders based on their importance
to the mission or function. This assessment forms the basis for prioritizing
assets requiring certain levels of protection. Commanders must consider all
assets that need protection, all required protective measures, and all available
resources (e.g., time, materials, personnel, equipment).
1.3.5. Vulnerability Assessment. The vulnerability assessment is an evalua-
tion conducted to determine if key assets are provided appropriate levels of
protection. Protection levels are based on minimum standards where no spe-
cific threat has been identified or on higher levels of protection where a spe-
cific threat has been identified. This assessment analyzes the threat, likely
tactics, and key targets that may be vulnerable to attack.
1.3.6. Risk Assessment. Risk assessments help commanders make decisions
on the most effective ways to allocate limited resources needed to protect
personnel and critical assets. The assessment is based upon the results of the
threat, criticality, and vulnerability assessments. Based on these assessments,
the commander commits resources to achieve certain levels of protection for
personnel and mission-critical assets. With limited resources, all assets cannot
be afforded equal levels of protection. Risk Management provides the com-
mander with the best information available to make resource allocation deci-
sions. If plans do not incorporate these assessments, they will likely be too
reactive and cause limited resources to be misdirected or wasted. For addi-
tional information on the assessments used in determining levels of protec-
tion, refer to AFH 10-222, Volume 3, Civil Engineer Guide to Expeditionary
Force Protection.
AFH 10-222 Volume 14 1 August 2008                                           17


1.3.7. Resources. Planners must identify resources needed to implement se-
curity measures throughout all stages of deployments. A limited amount of
resources usually drives the need to apply risk management to ensure the
most critical assets are adequately protected. The following paragraphs cover
the areas planners must consider.
1.3.7.1. Funding. Funding for FP resources must be given the highest prior-
ity. Although civil engineers may not be directly involved with funding deci-
sions at the highest levels, it is important to know that the Chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff has access to a special fund, known as the Combating
Terrorism Readiness Initiative Fund (CbTRIF). The CbTRIF is a joint-
services fund designed to fund projects for emergent or high-priority force
protection equipment or construction. These funds can be used to procure
physical security equipment to reduce vulnerabilities. Requests for funding
through this process must be for unanticipated requirements where the ur-
gency for funding cannot be met through the normal Service funding process.
However funds are obtained, ensure all FP requirements are clearly identified
and address the exact purpose for which the requirements are needed, includ-
ing vulnerabilities that commanders must addressed (unless classified).
1.3.7.2. Materials and Equipment. Class IV materials (i.e., construction and
barrier materials) are available through many sources, including the Defense
Logistics Agency’s Defense Supply Centers at https://www.dla.mil. Planners
should become familiar with these sources and the different types of con-
struction materials that can be acquired. If construction materials and other
equipment resources (e.g., earth-moving and material handling equipment)
are not readily available in the deployed area, these items may need to be
purchased and brought forward to establish some level of protection during
initial beddown. Planners must also be aware that locally available materials
and equipment may be of inferior quality, making it difficult to implement
effective FP measures. When planning for materials and equipment, consider
the possibility of increased threats that may require additional resources.
Also, consider the possibility of pre-positioning FP resources at or near the
site as war reserve materiel; this will provide the capability to quickly imple-
ment physical security measures in conjunction with initial beddown.
AFH 10-222 Volume 14 1 August 2008                                            18


1.3.8. Training. Every effort must be made to ensure civil engineers are suf-
ficiently trained on physical security TTPs prior to deploying. Hands-on
training is needed to ensure deploying personnel are proficient in constructing
critical structures such as guard towers, berms, ditches and protective shel-
ters. There are several training venues available to assist civil engineers prior
to expeditionary deployments.
1.3.8.1. US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Protective Design Center
(PDC). The USACE PDC offers several training courses on security engi-
neering and protective design. These courses are in-resident and range from
two to eight days. Some courses cover the different software programs used
to estimate blast effects. For example, the Blast Effects Estimation Model
(BEEM) is an assessment tool used to estimate facility damage and personnel
injuries resulting from an attack. The BlastX software performs calculations
of shock wave effects. Keep in mind, engineers using this software must be
extremely familiar with the different programs and their application to avoid
miscalculating or misinterpreting specific outputs. Mobile Training Teams
(MTTs) can also be scheduled to conduct security engineering courses at a
unit’s home station. However, the unit must pay all expenses related to bring-
ing MTTs to their location. The PDC also has an on-line open forum that
allows members to post questions and receive information from engineers
who are experts in a variety of areas. For additional information, go to the
PDC website at https://pdc.usace.army.mil.
1.3.8.2. Theater Construction Management System (TCMS). TCMS is a
PC-based automated construction planning, design, management, and report-
ing system that is used by military engineers for contingency construction
activities. Its primary purpose is to support OCONUS (outside the Continen-
tal United States) requirements. It combines state-of-the-art computer hard-
ware and software with Army Facilities Component System (AFCS) design
information to support and enhance the accomplishment of engineer mission
activities in the theater of operation or other mission arenas. A wealth of in-
formation, including drawings and specifications for expeditionary structures,
such a guard towers, revetments, and various obstacles, can be retrieved
through TCMS at http://www.tcms.net.

1.4. Protective Construction. Protective construction refers to the design,
construction, and layout of facilities to support an integrated and in-depth
plan to protect personnel and critical assets from enemy attack. From a civil
engineer perspective, these efforts should be focused on activities related to
survivability. The mission cannot be successfully accomplished if the force is
devastated by enemy attacks. Survivability, defined in JP 3-34, Engineer
Doctrine for Joint Operations, involves a concept aimed at protecting all as-
pects of a military operation (e.g., personnel, weapons, supplies) while simul-
taneously maintaining the capability to deceive the enemy. Survivability tac-
tics include building a strong defense; employing frequent movement tactics;
using camouflage, concealment, and deception (CCD); and constructing
fighting and protective positions for personnel and equipment (Figure 1.3).
In addition to guidance provided in this handbook, several publications (clas-
sified FOUO) provide detailed guidance to ensure appropriate levels of pro-
tection are provided for key assets based on specific locations and threats.
These documents, sometimes referred to as the security engineering series of
UFCs, are listed in Table 1.2. In addition to UFCs, planners should be famil-
iar with the latest TTPs outlined in the Joint Contingency Operations Base
(JCOB) Force Protection Handbook and the Joint Forward Operations Base
(JFOB) Force Protection Handbook. These documents can be downloaded
from the Joint Staff Antiterrorism Portal (ATEP) website at
https://atep.dtic.mil.

                                  Chapter 2
                          FIGHTING POSITIONS
2.1. Overview. Fighting positions are fortified structures used for protection
against hostile fire. They can also be used as central points from which to
direct fire at offensive forces and provide overlapping fields of fire with adja-
cent fighting positions. The positions are constructed either hastily or deliber-
ately, depending on the availability of time, materials, and the threat. Ideally,
they should be sited to take advantage of natural terrain that conceals them
and obscures direct lines of sight while providing a means to direct fire to-
wards the enemy. Overhead cover is constructed when time is not a factor.
The most important point to remember when constructing a fighting position
is to make sure it cannot be detected. Do not site these positions where the
enemy expects to find them. Once detected, the “element of surprise” will be
lost. Camouflage should be applied to these positions to further complicate
the enemy’s ability to detect them. All of these tactics provide security forces
with the capability needed to decisively eliminate attempts to penetrate camp
boundaries or launch attacks upon military installations.

2.2. Safety. Safety is paramount to constructing fighting positions. Personnel
have been killed and injured as a result of improperly constructed fighting
positions. FM 5-34, Engineer Field Data, FM 5-103, Survivability, and Gov-
ernment Training Aid (GTA) 05-08-001, Survivability Positions, contain
guidance for proper construction. Supervisors must ensure their personnel are
trained on these procedures and should always supervise the actual construc-
tion. Once constructed, these positions must be inspected frequently, espe-
cially after the area experiences heavy rainfall and immediately after an at-
tack. Table 2.1 contains basic criteria for constructing fighting positions.

2.3. Materials. During contingencies, engineers use whatever materials are
available to construct and fortify fighting positions. Attachment 2 lists pro-
tective characteristics of some materials that can be used for these efforts
along with information that can be used to determine the required thickness
of materials needed to mitigate the effects of various types of weapons.
AFH 10-222 Volume 14 1 August 2008                                         22

AFH 10-222 Volume 14 1 August 2008                                                  23


2.4. Hasty Fighting Positions. Hasty fighting positions are used when time
and materials are limited. They can be constructed using whatever objects or
materials that inhabit the area (i.e., dirt, trees, logs, boulders, etc.). If an exist-
ing depression is available, it can be used as a hasty fighting position. Hasty
fighting positions are constructed by digging a hole at least 18 inches deep for
protection against indirect fire. The position should be able to accommodate
the occupant, be at least 24 inches wide, and include parapets for frontal and
flank cover. Ideally, the position is sited where natural cover from direct fire
is available (i.e., trees, large rocks, rubble, etc.). This helps to conceal the
position and make enemy detection difficult. If natural cover is not available,
use the soil excavated from the hole or other fill material in the surrounding
area to construct parapets. NOTE: Do not leave fresh soil exposed – the en-
tire position must be camouflaged. Parapets should be at least 18 inches high,
36 inches thick, and 6 inches (one-helmet distance) away from the hole. If
logs are used instead of soil or sandbags, they must be held firmly in place
with strong stakes 2 to 3 inches in diameter and approximately 18 inches
long. Frontal cover is constructed for protection against small caliber direct
fire. Flank and rear cover is used to mitigate the effects of indirect fire burst
to the flank and rear. Hasty fighting positions can be set up quickly with little
effort, but provide a minimum amount of protection. If properly located, and
the unit will remain in the area, improve the position as time permits to in-
clude overhead cover. Use the basic criteria presented earlier in Table 2.1
and FM 5-103 when constructing hasty fighting positions. The following
paragraphs contain brief descriptions of various hasty fighting positions.

2.4.1. Crater Positions. Crater positions, which are depressions in the ground
caused by exploding shells or bombs, can provide protection under direct fire.
These positions should be at least 2 to 3 feet wide and 18 inches deep. The
trenching tool is used to dig a steep face or parapet for added protection.

2.4.2. Skirmisher’s Trench. A skirmisher’s trench can also provide immedi-
ate cover. This position requires troops to lie down in the prone position and
use the entrenching tool or other means to scrape the surrounding soil and
build parapets between themselves and the direction of enemy fire.
AFH 10-222 Volume 14 1 August 2008                                           24


2.4.3. Prone Position. The prone position, illustrated in Figure 2.1, is an
improved skirmisher’s trench that conforms to the position and body length
of its occupant. It serves as a good firing position and provides better protec-
tion from direct fire weapons than the crater or skirmisher’s trench. Parapets,
18 inches in height, should be constructed around the position for protection
against indirect fire. However, because this is essentially a hasty position,
overhead cover is not usually constructed.
Figure 2.1. Hasty Fighting Position.




2.5. Deliberate Fighting Positions. Deliberate fighting positions are de-
signed to accommodate personnel, their equipment, and certain weapons to
be employed from the position. These positions are more protective and
should be constructed if a unit will be in a particular location for an extended
time. Several types of deliberate fighting positions can be constructed based
on (1) the weapon to be employed from the position, (2) the number of per-
sonnel that will occupy the position, and (3) the amount of gear and equip-
ment the position must accommodate. Supervisors ensure positions are prop-
erly constructed and overlapping fields of fire are provided with adjacent
fighting positions. The next few paragraphs describe procedures for con-
structing deliberate fighting positions. Although some guidance is provided
here, refer to FM 5-103 for details on constructing intercepting trenches for
fighting positions sited in areas that may experience ground shock.
AFH 10-222 Volume 14 1 August 2008                                           25


2.5.1. One-Person Deliberate Fighting Position. One-person deliberate
fighting positions (Figure 2.2) are constructed when time and materials are
available and the tactical situation warrants additional protection. The exca-
vation is relatively small, making it easier to use materials from the surround-
ing area for overhead cover and camouflage. This position must allow the
individual to fire to the front and oblique while behind frontal cover. All of
the basic construction criteria established for one-person deliberate fighting
positions also applies to fighting positions constructed on larger scales and
for different reasons. Critical aspects of constructing a one-person deliberate
fighting position will be covered first; variations to these basics will follow.
Figure 2.2. One-Person Deliberate Fighting Position.




2.5.1.1. Sectors of Fire. Sectors of fire are usually assigned by security per-
sonnel and form the basis for siting positions. If possible, select an area that
will provide natural frontal cover protection from enemy direct fire. If natural
cover is unavailable where the position is sited, construct parapets.
AFH 10-222 Volume 14 1 August 2008                                            26


2.5.1.2. Aiming and Sector Stakes. Aiming and sector stakes can be em-
placed to help security personnel with firing and to define sectors of fire. Out-
line the position as shown in Figure 2.3. For a one-person position, the hole
is usually about the length of an M-16 (roughly 3 feet and 3 inches long) and
as wide as two helmets (roughly 2 feet). NOTE: This usually is not done for
hasty fighting positions.

2.5.1.3. Parapets. Prepare parapet retaining walls using logs or other natural
materials. If logs are used, stake them down firmly with stakes about 2 to 3
inches in diameter and 18 inches long. The walls should be at least 6 inches
(one-helmet distance) from the edge of the hole. Build the front wall first, at
least two sandbags high (approximately 18 inches), 36 inches thick, and the
length of two M-16s (approximately 6 feet and 6 inches long). Sandbags
should be 75 percent full. Next, build flank walls with the same height and
thickness as that of the front wall, with the length being approximately equal
to that of one M-16. The rear wall should be one sandbag high and one M-16
long. Dig the hole to armpit depth and slope the walls. Throw the excavated
soil forward of the parapet retaining walls and pack it down hard.
Figure 2.3. Outlining One-Person Fighting Position.
AFH 10-222 Volume 14 1 August 2008                                           27


2.5.1.4. Grenade Sumps. Determining where to locate grenade sumps de-
pends on the type of fighting position being constructed. For a one-person
fighting position, grenade sumps (Figure 2.4) should be dug into the bottom
front face of the position at approximately a 30-degree angle and 12 to 18
inches deep, about the length of an entrenching tool. The width of the sump
should be approximately equal to the width of the entrenching tool shovel.
Use whatever tools are available to slope the floor towards the grenade sump.
This will make it easier to kick a grenade into the hole and get out of the way
so the blast goes into the back wall. For a larger, two-person fighting posi-
tion, grenade sumps are usually dug at each end of the position to allow oc-
cupants to move towards the opposite end away from the blast. Avoid locat-
ing grenade sumps under overhead cover, especially if the cover is con-
structed across the middle of the fighting position. The blast could reflect off
the cover and cause injuries or collapse the entire structure. A combination of
grenade sump trenches and holes can be used for special-purpose fighting
positions. A T-shaped position allows for additional observation or firing
zones but may require additional grenade sumps. Make sure the blast from
the sump is not directed towards any occupied sections of the position.
Figure 2.4. Grenade Sump – One-Person Fighting Position.
AFH 10-222 Volume 14 1 August 2008                                              28


2.5.1.5. Fighting Position Revetments. In wet, sandy, or poorly compacted
soils, revetments are used to reinforce the sides of fighting positions and
trenches to prevent collapse (Figure 2.5). Revetting is also necessary when
positions are dug in soils with large amounts of clay or high plasticity as
these soils may liquefy, displace, or shear from ground shock. Without re-
vetments, the walls of a position in sandy soils would have to be sloped to
achieve a certain depth. However, this is not recommended since the top
opening of the position would be too wide, making it difficult to incorporate
overhead cover. Revet fighting positions using material held in place with
either braced or tied pickets. Pickets can be lumber, wooden poles, standard
concertina wire pickets, metal poles, angular posts, or trees. Wooden pickets
from trees or saplings should be at least 3 inches in diameter. The pickets are
used to hold matting material (i.e., brushwood mats, lumber, wire mesh, geo-
textile fabric, cloth mat, etc.) against the soil face. More rigid facing materials
include plywood, landing mats, corrugated metal, and timbers. Use the field
expedient procedures outlined in Attachment 3 to classify soils and deter-
mine whether revetments are needed.
Figure 2.5. Fighting Position Revetment.
AFH 10-222 Volume 14 1 August 2008                                           29


2.5.1.6. Crawl Trenches. If time is available and the overall defensive pos-
ture needs to be enhanced, crawl trenches can be constructed to connect fight-
ing positions and prevent personnel from being exposed to enemy fire as they
move about the area. The depth of these trenches is based on the availability
of time and resources. Engineers will have to assist others with excavation
and trench reinforcement (Figure 2.6). Crawl trenches should be dug in a
zigzagged pattern to prevent the enemy from being able to fire down a long
section if the trench is breached. This pattern will also help to reduce the ef-
fects of fragmentation if the crawl trench is hit with explosive munitions.

2.5.1.7. Ground Shock Intercept Trenches. Since fighting positions might
be needed in areas subject to high levels of ground shock based on certain
soil or geological conditions, civil engineers must have some general knowl-
edge of geology and different soil types. Ground shock sufficient enough to
collapse fighting positions can occur when these positions are constructed
over water tables too close to the bottom of the positions or in areas where the
soil is located within 25 feet of and/or over an underlying rock formation,
moist clay, or soils with high water content. Ground shock is intensified by
reduced resistance through the soil or reflection from the underlying soil and
rock formations. One way to reduce the effect of ground shock on fighting
positions involves constructing ground shock intercept trenches. Ground
shock intercept trenches are meant to collapse from ground shock and thereby
absorb enough of the ground shock to prevent fighting positions from collaps-
ing. These types of trenches are dug approximately 12 inches wide to a depth
that is at least 2 feet deeper than the fighting positions they are intended to
protect. They should also be at least 6 feet longer than the width of the fight-
ing position. Locate the trenches away from fighting positions at a distance
approximately 1 1/2 to 2 times the depth of the trench, as illustrated in Figure
2.7. Due to their narrow width, these trenches can easily be camouflaged.
Table 2.2 can be used as a checklist to ensure revetments, crawl trenches, and
ground shock intercept trenches are being properly constructed.

Table 2.2. Checklist - Fighting Position Revetments and Trenches.
           Use field soil sampling techniques (Attachment 3) to determine
 1         soil types and whether revetments will be required
           Use lumber, wooden poles, metal poles, concertina wire pickets,
 2         or trees as pickets to hold revetting material in place
           If wooden pickets from trees or saplings are used for pickets,
 3         ensure they are at least 3 inches in diameter
           Use flexible items such as brushwood mats, wire mesh, geotex-
 4         tile fabric, and cloth mats for facing material if available
           Use more rigid items such as corrugated metal sheets, landing
 5         mats, and lumber for facing material if available
           Space pickets based on soil type and facing material used (up to
 6         30 inches for flexible material and 78 inches for rigid material)
           Drive pickets at least 18 inches into the ground; use stakes to
 7         help stabilize the pickets in place if needed
           Drive stakes into the ground at a distance from the edge of the
 8         excavation equal to the depth of the excavation
           If more than 3 or 4 stakes are used, alternate the distance; place
 9         every other stake equal to the depth of the excavation plus 2 feet
           Consider the need to construct ground shock intercept trenches
 10        to absorb ground shock from explosions near fighting positions
           If needed, construct ground shock intercept trenches between
 11        fighting positions and likely impact point for high explosives
           Dig intercept trenches at least 12 feet wide and at least 2 feet
 12        deeper than fighting positions
           Dig intercept trenches at least 6 feet longer than the width of the
 13        fighting positions they are meant to protect
           Locate intercept trenches away from fighting positions at a hori-
 14        zontal distance of 1 1/2 to 2 times the depth of the trench
AFH 10-222 Volume 14 1 August 2008                                           32


2.5.1.8. Fighting Position Overhead Protection and Cover. Fighting posi-
tion overhead protection is used to mitigate the effects of blast and fragmen-
tation from direct- and indirect-fired weapons. Cover provides concealment
and protects against weather. Overhead protection and cover are always
needed unless it will make the position easy to detect. The following para-
graphs cover basic concepts for overhead protection and cover. Attachment
2 contains information on thicknesses for protection against certain weapons.
However, always reference FM 5-103, GTA 05-08-001, and GTA 07-06-001,
Fighting Position Construction Infantry Leader’s Reference Card.

2.5.1.8.1. Roof Supports. For standard one- and two-person fighting posi-
tions, 4-inch x 4-inch x 6-foot lumber or timber equivalents are normally used
for roof supports. To form the base structure for overhead cover, logs or lum-
ber 4 to 6 inches in diameter can be used. Table 2.3 compares cut timber to
the equivalent size of processed lumber. If logs are used, secure them with
stakes approximately 2 to 3 inches in diameter and about 18 inches long.
Make sure bearing support beams are properly positioned. Set support logs
back a distance equal to approximately 1/4 the depth of the hole and embed-
ded approximately halfway into the ground as illustrated in Figure 2.8. Set
overhead cover supports back about 1 foot or 1/4 the depth of the hole.

2.5.1.8.2. Stringers. Stringers are made from solid and sturdy material, such
as lumber or timber, and are used to support overhead cover. For standard
one- and two-person fighting positions, 4-inch x 4-inch x 8-foot lumber or
timber equivalents are normally used and spaced 6 inches on-center. On-
center spacing is critical to the safety of fighting positions. If stringers are
placed too far apart, they will be less capable of carrying the dead weight of
overhead cover. Stringer span (the unsupported distance between each end of
material used as stringers) is also critical. Table 2.4, extracted from GTA 05-
08-001, can be used to determine span and center-to-center spacing for wood-
supporting soil cover to defeat various contact bursts. Figure 2.9 illustrates
stringer placement for overhead cover. Ensure stringers are approximately the
same size as roof supports, are laid side by side across them, extending at
least 1-foot past the supports on each side of the fighting position.

2.5.1.8.3. Dustproof Layer. Once the stringers are properly placed, put a
dustproof layer over the base logs/stringers (Figure 2.10). The dustproof
layer could be 4-feet by 4-feet sheets of 3/4-inch plywood. Nail the plywood
dustproof layer to the stringers. This layer will also help to keep water from
leaking through the overhead cover into the fighting position.

2.5.1.8.4. Cover. Place 6 to 8 inches of soil on top of the dustproof layer
(Figure 2.11). If sandbags are used, cover them with waterproof material as
well. If they are drenched during rainy weather, sandbags will become very
heavy and could cause roof supports to collapse.
Figure 2.11. Completed Fighting Position – Side View.




2.5.1.8.5. Inspection. Supervisors should have hands-on experience in con-
structing various types of fighting positions. There is no substitute for learn-
ing by doing. These leaders must be capable of inspecting fighting positions
during construction, after they are covered, before they are camouflaged, and
again after they are camouflaged to ensure proper procedures are followed.
The structure’s integrity must be approved before adding overhead cover and
applying camouflage. In addition to GTA 05-08-001 and FM 5-103, Table
2.5 can be used to ensure fighting positions are properly constructed.
AFH 10-222 Volume 14 1 August 2008                                           37

           Build front, flank, and rear parapets two sandbag layers high
 7         and 18 inches thick
           Place stringers (4 to 6 inches in diameter) on top of roof sup-
 8         port. Refer to Table 2.6 for stringer spacing
           Ensure stringers extend past roof supports and into parapets
 9         (remove a portion of the parapets and place on top of stringers)
           Place waterproof bags, ponchos, etc., on top of the stringers
 10
           Place 6 to 8 inches of packed dirt or sandbags on top of the wa-
 11        terproof material
           If sandbags are used, place a water-resistant material over the
 12        sandbags to prevent them from becoming saturated
           Cover the dirt with sod, and camouflage the overhead cover
 13
           Ensure the supervisor inspects the position upon completion and
 14        again daily, especially following bad weather or an attack
AFH 10-222 Volume 14 1 August 2008                                               38


2.5.1.9. Concealment and Camouflage. The most important consideration in
constructing fighting positions is making sure they cannot be detected. After
overhead cover is constructed, use concealment and camouflage techniques to
make the position undetectable. Concealment is anything that hides the fight-
ing position from enemy observation. It may be natural material (i.e., bushes,
leaves, grass, etc.) or artificial material (i.e., burlap, nets, etc.). If possible,
locate fighting positions where natural cover, such as bushes, tall grass, trees,
logs, stumps, mountainous terrain, or large rocks can help to conceal them.
Take advantage of natural cover (i.e., wooded areas, hills, rock formations)
for concealment, and cover shiny objects such as watches, compasses, and
bayonets. Camouflage is used to blend the position with the surrounding ter-
rain. The key to camouflaging fighting positions is to alter the appearance of
the asset being protected in a manner where it becomes part of the back-
ground. Camouflage also makes use of natural and manmade material. Study
the terrain and vegetation of the area. Natural cover could include materials
such as trees, brush, grass, leaves, rocks, or boulders. When using natural
cover for concealment, be careful not to disturb the look of the natural sur-
roundings – use materials commonly found in the area where an asset is to be
concealed. If vegetation/foliage is used to camouflage a position, it must be
replaced before it dries and turns colors, making the position stand out in its
surroundings. Since fresh soil can be used to detect a fighting position, it
must be disposed of far away from the position. Be careful not to leave tracks
leading to or from the position. Do not use too much material; this could
make the position stand out from its surroundings. Once the position is com-
pleted, inspect it from the enemy's viewpoint. As a final test of camouflage
and concealment efforts, mark off 35 meters (38 yards) in the direction of the
enemy and look back at the position to determine if it is undetectable and
blends in with the surrounding area.
AFH 10-222 Volume 14 1 August 2008                                            39


2.5.2. Two-Person Deliberate Fighting Position. Two-person deliberate
fighting positions are most common. Basic requirements for these positions
are essentially the same as those for one-person fighting positions with key
differences. Although this position is preferred, it is not without drawbacks.
Two-person fighting positions require more digging and prove difficult to
camouflage. It also provides a better target for grenades because the excava-
tion is larger. Typical combat gear such as the M-16 rifle and helmet can be
used to measure dimensions (Figure 2.12). For example, the length of a two-
person fighting position can be measured using two M-16 rifles (approxi-
mately 6 feet and 6 inches). The width can be measured with two helmets
(approximately 2 feet). The following paragraphs describe details for con-
structing two-person fighting positions.
Figure 2.12. Two-Person Deliberate Fighting Position.




2.5.2.1. Sectors of Fire. Unlike the one-person deliberate fighting position,
the two-person fighting position involves two fields of fire. Fighters occupy
opposite ends of the position after being assigned specific sectors of fire. This
is referred to as clearing primary and secondary fields of fire.

2.5.2.2. Aiming and Sector Stakes. Place sector stakes and aiming stakes (if
needed) at both ends of the fighting position to help stabilize the weapon dur-
ing firing and assist in targeting when visibility is limited. Position grazing
logs or sandbags between the sector stakes for each field of fire.
AFH 10-222 Volume 14 1 August 2008                                          40


2.5.2.3. Parapets. Construct parapets approximately one-helmet distance
from the edge of the excavation. Start with the front parapet, and then con-
struct the flank and rear parapets.

2.5.2.4. Outlining the Fighting Position. Outline the position on the ground
using a tree limb or anything available. A two-person deliberate fighting posi-
tion is usually rectangular in shape. The length of the deliberate two-person
fighting position is approximately two M-16s long. The width is about the
length of two helmets. Scoop out elbow holes to help stabilize the weapon
when firing.

2.5.2.5. Digging. Dig the position armpit deep, throwing the dirt forward to
the front parapet, then towards the flank and rear parapets. Pack the dirt down
hard. Remove any fresh dirt away from the position so it does not indicate
recent excavation activity.

2.5.2.6. Grenade Sumps. Grenade sumps are constructed at each end of the
two-person deliberate fighting position (Figure 2.13). This allows the blast to
go straight up while occupants move to the opposite end of the position. The
floor should be sloped towards the grenade sumps on each end to make it
easier to kick the grenade into the sump.

Figure 2.13. Grenade Sumps – Two-Person Deliberate Fighting Position.
AFH 10-222 Volume 14 1 August 2008                                          41


2.5.2.7. Additional Considerations. Conduct field soil sampling and deter-
mine if revetments or some type of reinforcement is needed. Procedures for
conducting soil sampling in the field can be found in Attachment 3. Also,
determine if trenches must be constructed to provide additional cover from
direct fire. To construct trenches and revetments, follow the same procedures
described for one-person deliberate fighting positions.

2.5.2.8. Overhead Cover. Employ the same techniques used to construct
overhead cover for the one-person fighting position. Avoid digging grenade
sumps under overhead cover, especially if overhead cover is constructed
across the middle of the structure. The blast could not only reflect off the
cover, but it could also collapse the structure.

2.5.2.9. Camouflage and Concealment. Employ the same camouflage and
concealment techniques as those for one-person deliberate fighting positions.

2.5.2.10. Modified Two-Person Deliberate Fighting Position. When fight-
ing positions are designated to provide cover for adjacent fighting positions
or to cover dead space in close terrain, rectangular-shaped fighting positions
can be modified to provide a wider sector of fire by extending one or both
ends of the fighting position at an angle of about 45 degrees. Figure 2.14 and
Figure 2.15 illustrate how two-person deliberate fighting positions can be
constructed with a rectangular shape for typical sectors of fire and modified
(curved) to provide a larger area of coverage. Curving the hole around the
frontal cover may be necessary in close terrain for better observation and fir-
ing to the front and to the next flank position. A curved fighting position al-
lows one person to maintain watch to the front while the other person rests or
eats. It also enables occupants to observe and fire to the front when not being
fired at, and to move back behind the frontal cover under heavy fire.

2.5.3. Machine Gun Fighting Position. The machine gun fighting position is
basically a two-person fighting position with some differences. It is outlined
as a T-shaped fighting position with two firing platforms to cover primary
and secondary sectors of fire (Figure 2.16). Due to the gun’s vibrations,
sandbags may be needed to line the floor of the platform and stabilize the
tripod legs to prevent them from moving. Also, the walls of the platform may
need to be reveted. Excavate to armpit depth and use the soil to build frontal,
flank, and rear parapets. Dig two grenade sumps and build overhead cover
similar to that of a two-person fighting position. For this type of position, the
ammunition bearer can dig a one-person fighting position to the flank of the
gun position, essentially modifying the position into a three-person fighting
position. The ammunition bearer should be able to see and fire to the front
and oblique and also to cover the front of the machine gun. The ammunition
bearer's position is connected to the machine gun position by a crawl trench
that allows the ammunition bearer to bring ammunition to the gun or replace
the gunner or assistant gunner (see Figure 2.17 and Figure 2.18). A three-
person machine gun fighting position has several advantages; (1) there is a
leader in each position, enabling more effective command and control, (2)
this type of position allows for 360-degree observation and fields of fire, and
(3) with three occupants, one person can provide security; one can do priority
work; and one can rest, eat, or perform needed maintenance. Also, this type
of position is more difficult to suppress since it is occupied by three fighters.

2.5.4. Modified Machine Gun Fighting Positions. When only one sector of
fire is assigned for a machine gun, only one half of a position is dug, usually
L-shaped (Figure 2.19). Time permitting, this position should be improved
into a T-shaped position. Another option is the horseshoe-shaped position
(Figure 2.20). Although the horseshoe-shaped position allows for easy 180-
degree traverse across the front, it provides less frontal cover and less protec-
tion from indirect fire than the T-shaped position. For this reason, the T-
shaped position is usually preferred.

2.5.5. Mortar Position. Civil engineers may be tasked to assist in construct-
ing mortar positions needed to defend military sites (Figure 2.21). These
positions are constructed in a circular fashion and sized based on the weapon
system to be employed. Typically, mortar positions are 6 to 8 feet in diameter
at the bottom, about 5 feet deep, and have a 20-inch high berm for protection
against enemy fire. These fighting positions must be dug deep enough to pro-
tect the occupants and weapons being employed without restricting direct
lines of sight towards the enemy. The walls should be sloped outwards and
reveted with sandbags or some other type of structural material to prevent the
position from collapsing after repeated launch concussions. The upper diame-
ter of the position can be 9 to 12 feet. Some mortar positions may not have
overhead cover because of the weapon being employed, making it difficult to
apply camouflage. A trench system is used for entry, and a separate position
is excavated to protect the crew from enemy fire. The trench leads from the
back of the mortar position away from the direction of fire, and extends for a
short distance back from the position and turns at a 90-degree angle into an
access trench to a covered position. The entrance trench should be reinforced
to prevent collapse. Since there is no overhead cover, a drainage sump can be
constructed near the entrance. Slope the floor towards the sump. This sump
can also be used as a grenade sump.
Figure 2.21. Mortar Position.
AFH 10-222 Volume 14 1 August 2008                                            47


2.5.6. Light Antitank Weapon (LAW) Fighting Position. Although the
LAW can be fired from other fighting positions, it is best to construct a dedi-
cated LAW fighting position that is located and designed to accommodate the
backblast from the weapon (Figure 2.22). Site the position such that the area
to the rear of the firing area is away from trees, walls, parapets, or loose
gravel that could deflect the backblast or blow debris from the backblast to-
ward other fighting positions and personnel. The LAW fighting position
should be about the size of a large, straight two-person fighting position and
have overhead cover located at one end of the fighting position. At the other
end of the fighting position, the LAW gunner position may have a small plat-
form for elbow rests cut into the top of the wall; the front face of the position
should be inclined forward for better stability. If frontal protection is needed
at the gunner's position, it should be minimal and stabilized. If there is raised
rear protection, it must be low enough to ensure that the blast is not diverted
toward another fighting position or back at the gunner. Also, make sure the
rear wall of the fighting position is not too high for the LAW’s full range of
fire. This could cause the blast to become entrapped in the fighting position
for elevated shots. Locate grenade sumps at both ends of the position.

AFH 10-222 Volume 14 1 August 2008                                          48


2.5.7. Aboveground Fighting Positions. Effective aboveground fighting
positions can be constructed using earth-filled wire mesh containers. Some
container units are made from a steel mesh framework lined with non-woven
geotextile material. Their advantage over other forms of protective works
includes their lightweight characteristics. They can be transported in a com-
pressed, “accordion” style, then expanded on-site and filled with locally
available material (Figure 2.23) such as rocks, rubble, sand, gravel, or soil.
This is extremely important from a logistical standpoint. The following para-
graphs describe how these units can be used to construct a small aboveground
fighting position. These types of containers can also be used to construct
other types of protective structures, bunkers, and revetments. Bunker con-
struction is covered in Chapter 3, and revetment construction is covered in
Chapter 5. For details on constructing different types of structures using wire
mesh container units, refer to the manufacturer’s instructions, the JFOB Force
Protection Handbook or the JCOB Force Protection Handbook. In addition,
detailed construction drawings and instructions on building a variety of pro-
tective structures using earth-filled protective barrier can be downloaded from
TCMS. During planning, civil engineer planners should gain access to this
site and download the construction schematics and instructions needed to
implement effective FP measures immediately upon arrival.
Figure 2.23. Wire Mesh Containers Being Expanded and Filled On-Site.
AFH 10-222 Volume 14 1 August 2008                                           49


2.5.7.1. Site Selection and Preparation. Site selection and preparation are
critical to the performance of structures built using wire mesh containers. Soil
conditions and drainage patterns must be considered when siting these struc-
tures. Factors that influence deterioration of near-surface materials are ele-
vated moisture levels, soil erosion, freeze/thaw cycles, decay of organic mat-
ter, and compression of weak soils. Wire mesh container structures transmit
their loads through the “fill walls” into the foundation below. The foundation
needs to be stable enough to absorb these loads. The site should be flat and
level with sufficient strength and stability to support the structure for the
amount of time it is needed. If a structure cannot be sited on an improved
surface such as concrete, asphalt, or stabilized soil, the area should be graded
to remove excess materials and loose surface soils to provide a smooth and
level surface to prevent the structure from settling and shifting over time. To
improve the surface area, dig a trench, approximately 20 inches beneath each
wall of the structure (Figure 2.24). The width of the trench should extend 20
inches beyond the edge of each wall. Line the trench with a geotextile cloth
(minimum weight 200 g/m2) and backfill it with a well compacted layer of
coarse graded fill material or crushed rock. Test the foundation for strength
and stability before starting any type of construction.
Figure 2.24. Improved Foundation.
AFH 10-222 Volume 14 1 August 2008                                           50


2.5.7.2. Materials. Civil engineer planners must work closely with the servic-
ing logistics function to ensure the required materials are ordered and will be
available when needed. In addition, heavy equipment, such as bulldozers and
front-end loaders, and hand tools (i.e., shovels, rakes, pliers, wire cutters,
etc.) will be needed. As an example, the next few paragraphs describe how to
construct an aboveground single-bay fighting position. NOTE: Always refer
to the manufacturer’s instructions for proper construction procedures.
2.5.7.3. Single-Bay Fighting Position. To construct an aboveground single-
bay fighting position using earth-filled containers, begin expanding the bays
of the containers and laying out the framework (Figure 2.5) and connecting
the joining pins. Make sure the flaps at the bottom of the units are folded out.
Once these actions are completed, begin placing fill material in the center of
the bays uniformly throughout the first layer. Generally, the bays are filled in
lifts no greater than 9 inches and lightly compacted using manual hand tam-
pers or by foot – do not use compacting equipment for this purpose. The bays
should bulge along the sides while filling. This allows them to deform to their
maximum state. Do not attempt to use restraints to prevent this deformation
process. To accommodate deformation, pull the coil hinges located at the
bottom of the bays out approximately 4 inches during initial filling. If the
containers being used do not have coil hinges at the bottom of the bays, just
pull the sides of each bay outwards. Since the example being used here in-
volves constructing an aboveground single-bay fighting position, a second
layer will be constructed on top of the first layer. When a second layer is to
be constructed, halt filling approximately 4 inches from the top of each bay.
Figure 2.25. First Layer – Single-Bay Fighting Position.
AFH 10-222 Volume 14 1 August 2008                                           51


2.5.7.4. Second Layer. After the first layer is complete, align the second
layer as depicted in Figure 2.26. Seal both layers together using the geotex-
tile flaps located at the bottom of the second layer and use the plastic ties to
connect them. Uniformly fill the second layer as previously described.
Figure 2.26. Second Layer – Single-Bay Fighting Position.




2.5.7.5. Composite Panels. Align the 2- by 14-foot composite panels on top
of the second layer of earth-filled units along the vertical walls as shown in
Figure 2.27.
Figure 2.27. Composite Panels – Single-Bay Fighting Position.
AFH 10-222 Volume 14 1 August 2008                                           52


2.5.7.6. Waterproof Membrane. Place the 2- by 8-foot composite panels on
top of the roof supports and connect them using the toggle connectors. Drive
the toggle connectors in as far as possible, cut them flush, then place the wa-
terproof membrane on top of the roof as illustrated in Figure 2.28.
Figure 2.28. Waterproof Membrane – Single-Bay Fighting Position.




2.5.7.7. Overhead Cover. Constructing overhead cover is the last step. Begin
by aligning sections of containers along the roof as shown in Figure 2.29.
Ensure the flaps at the bottom of the units are folded in. Fill the bays as pre-
viously described and lightly compact. After all of the bays are filled, place
approximately 2 feet of fill material in the center of the roof to complete
overhead cover (Figure 2.30). Once completed, check to make sure there is
no excessive deflection of the roof (up to 1½ inches is acceptable). Also,
make sure the roof supports are centered on the sidewalls and sheet pilings
are fully supported by the roof supports. Lastly, check to make sure all walls
are straight and that there is no excessive settlement of the walls.

                                 Chapter 3
                      PROTECTIVE STRUCTURES
3.1. Overview. This chapter covers different types of bunkers and shelters
that can be employed in the expeditionary environment (Figure 3.1). Bunkers
and shelters should be designed to withstand near misses or direct hits from
rockets, artillery, and mortars and strategically located throughout the site.
The types of protective shelters employed during contingencies are based on
many factors including: (1) the threat, (2) stage of the deployment, (3) in-
tended use of the structure, (4) available materials, (5) available equipment,
(6) available man-hours, and (7) construction skills. During initial beddown,
engineers must focus immediately upon designing and constructing protective
shelters needed to counter known and potential threats. Initially, expedient
methods will likely be required. However, as contingency operations begin to
stabilize and access to additional resources become available, engineers must
focus on improving designs and constructing protective shelters that afford
more protection for personnel and mission-critical assets. While planning,
keep in mind that the best protective shelters are those that provide the most
protection and require the least amount of time and effort to construct.
Figure 3.1. Protective Structures.
AFH 10-222 Volume 14 1 August 2008                                             55


3.2. Expedient Protective Structures. When designing bunkers and shelters,
consider the purpose (e.g., command post, observation post) and the degree of
protection desired (small arms, mortars, bombs). These structures should be
sited and constructed out of the path of natural drainage lines. If possible, site
shelters on reverse slopes, in wooded areas, or in some form of natural fortifi-
cation such as a ravine, valley, gully, hollow or depression for added protec-
tion. NOTE: Reverse slopes of hills and mountains also provide some protec-
tion from the effects of nuclear weapons since the heat and light from the
fireball of a nuclear blast and the initial radiation tend to be absorbed by hills
and mountains. For additional information on NBC protection, refer to
AFTTP (I) 3-2.46. Once constructed, continuously improve the protective
capability of bunkers and shelters as time permits. The following paragraphs
outline key factors to be considered when designing and constructing expedi-
ent protective structures.

3.2.1. Overhead Protection for Expedient Protective Structures. Expedi-
ent shelters should have some type of overhead cover. Although it may not be
possible to provide overhead cover for every asset, fighting positions and
mission-critical assets deemed vulnerable to certain threats must be provided
appropriate levels of protection. Overhead cover can be constructed from a
combination of berms, revetments, or partially buried structures if engineers
are not limited by the lack of time or resources. During the initial stages of a
deployment, however, it is very likely that time and resources will be limited.
This is why it is very important that civil engineers focus initially on defeat-
ing specific threats (e.g., direct- and indirect-fired weapons) and protecting
the most critical assets, rather than attempting to equally protect all assets
from all possible threats. See Attachment 2 for a list of the different types of
materials that may be available in the expeditionary environment for use in
constructing overhead cover to protect against various projectiles.
AFH 10-222 Volume 14 1 August 2008                                        56


3.2.2. Corrugated Metal Culvert Shelter. Aboveground metal culvert shel-
ters can be constructed in areas where personnel are billeted or work in non-
protected buildings or expeditionary structures and need shelter in the event
of an attack (Figure 3.2). Covered with earth (18 to 24 inches), these struc-
tures can provide a significant amount of protection. However, do not to use
the top of these types of structures to support overhead cover without first
reinforcing the base of the structure. Use lumber, timber, berms, revetments,
or other expedient means of supporting the overhead cover. The shelter is 6
feet high and consists of two rows of 55-gallon drums with about a 4-foot
span between rows. Two- by four-inch studs measuring 4 inches higher than
the drums are centered inside each drum. The drums are then filled with soil.
A 2- by 8-inch top plate is connected to the 2- by 4-inch studs lengthwise
through the bunker. The corrugated metal pipe halves are bolted together and
connected to the top plates. A 2-foot layer of sandbags is placed along each
row of drums. To protect the ends of the bunker, erect barrier walls 2 feet
beyond the entrances. Additional protection is provided on the sides and ends
by increasing sandbag thickness. This shelter provides protection against
mortars and small caliber weapons.
Figure 3.2. Corrugated Metal Culvert Shelter.
AFH 10-222 Volume 14 1 August 2008                                           57


3.2.3. Fighting Bunker With Overhead Cover. It is impractical to place
enough earth cover on a structure to protect it against all weapons. However,
by combining materials and using them in layers, protection is provided with
less excavation and effort. The designs illustrated in Figure 3.3 through
Figure 3.5 use five 2-inch or seven 1-inch layers of lumber as the base sup-
port for the roof. Layers of materials are placed on the base in sequence to
provide overhead protection. Table 3.1 and Table 3.2 contain a bill of mate-
rials and required stringer thickness based on the thickness of earth cover for
this design. These different layers are described in the following paragraphs.

3.2.3.1. Dust-Proof Layer. Tar paper, canvas, or tarpaulins are lapped and
placed on top of the base of the roof to keep out dust and dirt.

3.2.3.2. Cushion layer. The cushion layer is intended to absorb the shock of
detonation or penetration. Untamped earth is the best material for this pur-
pose and should be at least 12 inches thick. Materials such as loose gravel
transmit shock to the layer below and should not be used in the cushion layer.
This layer extends on all sides for a distance equal to the depth of the shelter
floor below the ground surface, or to a minimum of 5 feet.

3.2.3.3. Waterproof Layer. The waterproof layer is constructed of the same
or similar materials as the dust-proof layer. It is intended to keep moisture
from the cushion layer in order to retain the cushioning effect of the soft, dry
earth and minimize the dead load the structure must carry.

3.2.3.4. Burster Layer. The burster layer is intended to cause a projectile to
detonate before it can penetrate into the lower layers. This layer is made of 6
to 8 inches of rocks placed in two layers with the joints broken. It should be
at least 12 inches thick. Irregular-shaped rocks are more effective for this
purpose than flat rocks because they can change a projectile’s angle of pene-
tration. If rocks are not available, 8-inch logs can be used. They must be
wired tightly together in two layers. The burster layer should extend on each
side of the shelter a minimum of 6 feet. Lastly, cover the burster layer with
two inches of untamped earth or sod as a camouflage layer.

3.3. Prefabricated Structures. Prefabricated structures provide a rapid con-
struction and placement capability. The most commonly used prefabricated
structures are the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) shel-
ters and ISO shipping containers.

3.3.1. Expandable Tactical ISO Shelters. ISO shelters (Figure 3.6) are not
as vulnerable to blast and fragmentation as tents and provide highly mobile,
environmentally controlled space for a variety of field activities. Several
models are available, including non-expandable, one-side expandable, and
two-side expandable models. Tactical shelters are wired for 60 or 100 amp,
three-phase electrical distribution and are integrated with internal fluorescent
lights, 120 VAC, 20 amp electrical outlets, an external area light, and an in-
terface for external environmental control units. Although research is con-
stantly being conducted to develop designs that are capable of resisting the
effects of blast and fragmentation, tactical shelters can be hardened with
sandbags, revetments, berms, concrete barriers, or other methods to provide
some degree of protection. For additional details on the use of tactical shel-
ters, refer to AFH 10-222, Volume 6. DOD also established a Joint Commit-
tee on Tactical Shelters (JOCATAS) to prevent the duplication of tactical
shelter research and development amongst the services. JOCATAS is also
responsible for approving the DOD Standard Family of Tactical Shelters.

3.3.2. ISO Bunkers. ISO bunkers are constructed using ISO containers hard-
ened with earth-filled protective barriers (Figure 3.7). The following para-
graphs briefly describe construction of an ISO bunker. There are several dif-
ferent types of bunkers that can be constructed using earth-filled containers.
For additional information on ISO bunkers and other types of bunkers that
can be constructed using ISO containers, refer to the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions and TCMS. The next few paragraphs describe construction of an above-
ground 20-foot ISO bunker. NOTE: When building these types of bunkers,
keep in mind the ISO containers cannot be load-bearing structures. Steel
framing or other structural support approved by an engineer with experience
in structural analysis must be used to support the top cover. Before attempting
to construct this bunker, planners must ensure the resources are available to
complete all phases of the project. These resources include bunker kits; heavy
equipment such as bulldozers, vibratory rollers, dump trucks, cranes, fork-
lifts, and front-end loaders; and technical guidance. Once a site is selected,
follow the guidance in Chapter 2 for site selection and preparation. Con-
struction can begin once planners are satisfied all resource requirements have
been met.
Figure 3.7. ISO Bunker.

3.3.2.1. First Layer. The first layer of wire mesh containers for the ISO bun-
ker requires three sections of containers equal to nine bays. Begin by collaps-
ing one of the nine-bay sections to make a section that is eight bays long.
Next, break down another nine-bay section into two units with four bays
each. Align the bays as illustrated in Figure 3.8, ensuring the flaps at the bot-
tom of the units are folded out. Once the layout is complete, begin filling the
units in 9-inch lifts (approximately). Start from the center of the bays and fill
the bays in a uniform manner, ensuring some bays are not being filled faster
than others. Lightly compact the fill material after each lift using manual
hand tampers or by foot – do not use compacting equipment for this purpose.
Continue this process until all bays are filled. Compact the last layer in prepa-
ration to construct the second layer of the ISO bunker. For more guidance on
infill procedures, refer to Chapter 2, the manufacturer’s instructions, or
TCMS.

3.3.2.2. Second Layer. The second layer of the ISO bunker also requires
three sections of containers (nine bays per section). Note that the material
needed to construct the second layer is identical to the material needed to
construct the base layout. This is because the second layer must be perfectly
aligned with the first layer. Once again, begin by collapsing one of the three
sections (nine bays) to make a section that equates to eight bays. Take an-
other section (nine bays) and separate it into two separate sections consisting
of four bays. Align these sections as illustrated in Figure 3.9, ensuring the
flaps at the bottom are folded out. Once the layout is complete for the second
layer, connect the plastic ties between the first and second layers, and begin
filling the units using the proper fill procedures previously described.
Figure 3.9. Second Layer – ISO Bunker.
AFH 10-222 Volume 14 1 August 2008                                          65


3.3.2.3. Roof Support. Once the second layer is complete, begin preparing
the roof support. To support the roof structure, four 18-foot, U-shaped sheet
pilings are required. Place two pieces of the sheet pilings end-to-end on top
of each of the sidewalls of the structure as illustrated in Figure 3.10. Ensure
the panels are centered on the sidewalls. Other materials such as 6- by 6-inch
lumber can be used in lieu of sheet pilings for roof support if approved by an
engineer with experience in structural analysis. This structure will be de-
pended upon to shield personnel from attacks, and its structural integrity can-
not be overemphasized. For this reason, any tendency to improvise materials
or procedures during construction should be avoided.
Figure 3.10. Roof Support — ISO Bunker.
AFH 10-222 Volume 14 1 August 2008                                          66


3.3.2.4. Sheet Piling and Waterproof Membrane. Once the sheet pilings
are firmly in place along the sidewalls, 24 18-foot U-shaped sheet pilings are
laid across the structure, firmly on top of the roof supports as illustrated in
Figure 3.11. When placing the sheet pilings, slide the pieces together from
the ends to lock them in place. Again, any attempts to improvise should be
avoided, and any material substitution should be approved by an engineer
with experience in structural analysis. Once the sheet pilings are in place
across the structure, the waterproof membrane can be placed on top of them.
Sandbags can then be placed on top of the waterproof membrane to level the
roof (Figure 3.12).

3.3.2.5. Overhead Cover. After installing the waterproof membrane, the next
step is to put the overhead cover in place. This requires 24 sections of con-
tainers, 2 feet high, 2 feet wide, and 4 feet long. Place the units as illustrated
in Figure 3.13, making sure the sandbags are beneath the edges of the units
to prevent soil from leaking through and on to roof. Fill each unit with loose
soil and lightly compact. Once this is complete, place approximately 2 feet of
soil in the center of the roof. Once this is completed, refer to Table 3.3 and
do a quick visual check to make sure the structure is intact.

    inches is acceptable)

4   Make sure all walls are straight
5   Make sure there is no excessive settlement of the walls

3.4. Reinforced Concrete Bunkers. Reinforced concrete bunkers are used
extensively in the expeditionary environment to provide immediate shelter
from imminent or repeated attacks. Figure 3.14 shows reinforced concrete
culvert bunkers commonly found in SWA and a different type of reinforced
concrete bunker developed by the USACE’s Engineer Research and Devel-
opment Center (ERDC). The entrances of reinforced concrete culvert bunkers
can be blocked by concrete barriers, additional sandbags, or some other bar-
rier to prevent the effects of blasts and fragmentation from entering the struc-
ture. The ERDC bunker is designed to eliminate a direct line of entrance for
blast and fragmentation into the structures. These structures are usually de-
signed to accommodate 25 to 30 personnel and can be placed above or below
the ground (based on the threat). It is important to note that these bunkers are
not effective against direct hits from 120 mm mortars and 122 mm rockets.
Therefore, these bunkers should be fully buried in a cut and cover configura-
tion or covered by several layers of sandbags. Cover the roof of the bunkers
with 2 to 3 layers of sandbags for protection against quick-fused 82 mm and
120 mm mortars. Cover bunkers with approximately 48 inches of sandbags or
bury them with approximately 48 inches of soil cover for protection against
quick-fused 122 mm rockets. Place at least layers of sandbags along the bun-
ker walls for protection against blast and fragmentation effects of near-miss
(4 feet) hits from 82 mm and 120 mm mortars and 122 mm rockets. Rein-
forced concrete bunkers can be manufactured locally or acquired through the
Logistics Support function. For additional information on these and other
types of bunkers, obtain access to TCMS. The ERDC should also be con-
tacted at www.erdc.usace.army.mil for the latest designs since these struc-
tures are constantly being tested and improved.

                                 OBSTACLES
4.1. Overview. Obstacles, from a tactical military perspective, can be de-
scribed as any obstructions designed and employed to impede, oppose, block,
or disrupt the movement or intentions of an opposing force. They can exist
naturally, be expediently constructed, or be prefabricated and moved into
place when and where needed. While the employment of obstacles can have
significant advantages, constructing them can be labor-intensive, and they can
inhibit the movement of both enemy and friendly forces. For this reason, ob-
stacles must be employed with a clear goal and understanding. This chapter
covers many types of obstacles that can be employed in the expeditionary
environment to protect assets and enhance force protection efforts. For addi-
tional details, refer to MIL-HDBK-1013/10, Design Guidelines for Security
Fencing, Gates, Barriers, and Guard Facilities, and UFC 4-022-02.

4.2. Planning. Responsibility for developing a plan for using obstacles, the
barrier plan, normally rests with civil engineers and security forces. The plan
outlines how obstacles will be employed continuously and during periods of
heightened alert. A prioritized list of key facilities and critical assets to be
protected is used to develop the plan. Civil engineers work closely with secu-
rity personnel to identify resources needed to adequately protect key facilities
and assets. Although some installations may preposition these assets and em-
ploy them upon heightened alert or increased threats, in the expeditionary
environment, limited resources may not allow for maintaining barriers in
storage or prepositioned status for heightened alert. Barriers may need to be
employed where needed continuously to provide protection in high threat
environments. This determination is made on-site. The barrier plan should
summarize the number and types of barriers employed as well as additional
requirements, employment locations, if and where barriers will be preposi-
tioned, their intended purpose (i.e., traffic control, perimeter security, etc.),
and resources and equipment needed to move or relocate and install the barri-
ers when needed (i.e., anchors, cables, forklift, trailer, etc.). A dedicated bar-
rier team should be appointed, trained, and exercised regularly.
AFH 10-222 Volume 14 1 August 2008                                         71


4.3. Natural Obstacles. Natural obstacles can include steep slopes, escarp-
ments, ravines, gullies, ditches, rivers, streams, canals, swamps, marshes,
snow, and trees (see Table 4.1). Trees between 6 to 8 inches in diameter,
dense shrubs, and other vegetation can be used to enhance efforts to restrict
access to military sites. If complemented with other forms of barriers such as
barbed or concertina wire (Figure 4.1), trees and dense vegetation can be
used to enhance standoff. Barbed wire can be run low (9 to 30 inches above
the ground) in tall grass, shrubs, or brush and anchored on small pickets or
draped through shrubs to cause tripping hazards and injury to enemy person-
nel attempting to encroach upon a military site. Dense trees and shrubs can
also obscure direct lines of sight to a location and decrease the enemy’s tar-
geting capability. Keep in mind a clear zone must always be maintained to
prevent enemy personnel from advancing too close to the site’s perimeter.
There are some disadvantages of using trees and shrubs for the purposes just
covered. In some regions, trees and shrubs can be labor-intensive to maintain.
Also, these natural barriers can be used by the enemy as cover while attempt-
ing to breach protective barriers. An analysis will have to be conducted to
determine if trees and vegetation can be used to enhance force protection ef-
forts, or whether these areas will have to be cleared to prevent the enemy
from gaining an advantage in efforts to breach security measures.

4.4. Field Expedient Obstacles. During initial beddown it may be necessary
to use whatever means available to construct obstacles for protection. How-
ever, once material and equipment are more readily available, these measures
should be complemented or replaced with more effective means of protection.
The following paragraphs describe expedient methods that can be used to
construct and employ obstacles when time and materials are limited.

4.4.1. Abatis. During initial beddown, trees can be used to construct an aba-
tis, one of the oldest forms of barriers (Figure 4.2). The term “abatis” is a
French word meaning “a heap of material thrown.” It is constructed by cut-
ting down trees, leaving them attached to the stump, and arranging them in a
row with the branches facing towards the direction of the enemy to impede
movement. To ensure the tree remains attached to the stump, cut the butt of
the tree two-thirds through on the opposite side to which it is to fall. The trees
are then forcefully pushed over in the required direction. The branches can be
sharpened, making the barrier a primitive version of barbed wire. To be even
more effective, tree branches can be interlaced with barbed wire if available.
Although this type of expedient barrier may be necessary during the early
stages of a contingency due to severely limited resources, it should not be
used as a permanent barrier for a deployed site unless combined with more
modern forms of obstacles to enhance the level of protection.
Figure 4.2. Abatis.
AFH 10-222 Volume 14 1 August 2008                                           74


4.4.2. Log Obstacles. During initial beddown, logs can be used to construct
different types of obstacles and expedient barriers. The following paragraphs
describe some of the different ways logs can be used to restrict movement
around and throughout a deployed location. These are considered temporary
measures. Once contingency operations begin to stabilize and material and
equipment are more readily available (locally or through supply channels),
these types of barriers should be complemented or replaced with more effec-
tive means of impeding, blocking, or disrupting movement. Some of these
methods will be covered later in this chapter.

4.4.2.1. Log or Lumber Wall. A log wall, as illustrated in Figure 4.3, can be
constructed to block access to certain areas or to protect critical assets. This
type of barrier construction consists of short sections of 4- to 6-inch logs or
lumber stacked together between posts of the same size as the wall sections.
The posts are fastened together at the top and further held in place by guy
wires or ropes fastened to stakes. Several 10- to 12-foot wall sections should
be constructed toward the front of the position and placed in a staggered fash-
ion rather than building one long wall which could be destroyed by a single
detonation from enemy weapons.
Figure 4.3. Log Wall.
AFH 10-222 Volume 14 1 August 2008                                          75


4.4.2.2. Log Hurdles. Log hurdles are used to form barriers approximately
18 inches high across a road. Individual logs may be as small as 10 inches in
diameter if they are lashed or wired together and staked in place. Once log
hurdles are wired together, stagger shorter logs (6- to 7-foot lengths) along
the path in 10 to 12-foot segments, and place full width logs as illustrated in
Figure 4.4. Hurdles can slow vehicles enough to allow security forces to en-
gage an intruder or cause a vehicle to lose control. For more effectiveness,
hurdles can be used in conjunction with other obstacles such as ditches and
log cribs.
Figure 4.4. Log Hurdles.
AFH 10-222 Volume 14 1 August 2008                                             76


4.4.2.3. Log Cribs. Log cribs are simple obstacles consisting of short sec-
tions of logs (or other materials such as steel planks if available) fashioned
together as bins to contain dirt or rocks. Log cribs can be rectangular or trian-
gular and are used to block vehicle paths of travel on narrow roads (Figure
4.5). When possible, fill the cribs with material excavated by digging a shal-
low ditch in front of the cribs. Anchor revetment materials to prevent them
from being easily pushed out of the way. These obstacles are effective against
wheeled and tracked vehicles, especially in restricted areas like narrow moun-
tain roads. Unless substantially built, these types of obstacles are not effective
against heavy tracked vehicles. To make these obstacles more effective, log
hurdles can be constructed ahead of the cribs to force vehicles to slow down
prior to encountering them.
Figure 4.5. Log Cribs.
AFH 10-222 Volume 14 1 August 2008                                          77


4.4.3. Expedient Posts. The next few paragraphs cover different types of
posts that can be used to block access roads either permanently or temporar-
ily. The method used will depend on many factors, including the need for
access by friendly forces, the threat, availability of equipment and materials,
and the need to maintain an active offensive and defensive capability.

4.4.3.1. Timber Posts. Timber posts can be used to stop vehicles if partially
buried and driven into the soil at an angle between vertical and 50 degrees
toward the direction of movement (Figure 4.6). The posts should be ap-
proximately 10 feet long and extend 3 1/2 to 4 feet aboveground. Set the
posts between 3 to 4 feet apart in rows with 10 feet between rows. They can
be either aligned or staggered. Logs should be a minimum of 5 inches in di-
ameter for hardwoods and about 10 inches in diameter for softwoods. Wire
entanglements can be used in conjunction with this measure for increased
effectiveness.
Figure 4.6. Timber Posts.
AFH 10-222 Volume 14 1 August 2008                                           78


4.4.3.2. Steel Angled Posts. Steel pipes can be used as posts to block road-
ways and entrances. The pipes should be approximately 6 feet long and 4
inches in diameter. They are spaced approximately 4 feet apart and driven
into the surface approximately 3 feet at an angle between 30 to 45 degrees.
The post holes can then be backfilled with either soil or concrete to increase
their strength. Vehicles attempting to penetrate these types of barriers at high
speeds will experience major damage, and occupants will more than likely be
severely injured. Steel angled posts can be installed parallel or perpendicular
to a roadway. To prevent access by individuals on motorcycles, drill holes
into the top of each post and thread ½-inch diameter steel wire cable through
each post as indicated in Figure 4.7.
Figure 4.7. Steel Angled Posts.
AFH 10-222 Volume 14 1 August 2008                                           79


4.4.4. Berms and Ditches. Civil engineers should include expedient con-
struction of shallow berms and ditches while planning beddown activities for
deployments (Figure 4.8). Constructing these terrain features around the pe-
rimeter of a deployed location will slow or prevent vehicles from penetrating
the restricted boundary. It is important to remember that these features should
be gradual and shallow. Shallow berms and ditches make it more difficult for
speeding vehicles to avoid and provide less cover for intruders attempting to
infiltrate the area. While planning, consider the different types of heavy
equipment that will be required to construct berms and ditches.

4.4.4.1. Triangular Ditches and Hillside Cuts. Triangular ditches and hill-
side cuts are relatively easy to construct and are very effective against a wide
range of vehicles. Hillside cuts are variations of the triangular ditch adapted
to hillside locations. These terrain structures may need to be reveted to pre-
vent them from being easily filled or collapsed. Constructing additional ob-
stacles, such as log hurdles (protected side) to complement these structures
,will make them more effective in slowing and stopping vehicles (Figure
4.9). When placed at blind curves or hilltop transitions, log hurdles or spoil
mounds can cause speeding vehicles to go out of control.

4.4.4.2. Trapezoidal Ditch. A trapezoidal ditch requires more construction
time, but is more effective in stopping vehicles. With this type of construc-
tion, a vehicle will be trapped when the front end falls into the ditch and the
undercarriage is hung up on the leading edge of the ditch.

4.4.4.3. Berms. Berms are very effective in reinforcing existing perimeter
structures and stopping vehicles, and are relatively easy to construct. How-
ever, this task can also be time-consuming, and engineers need to ensure
heavy equipment will be available to construct berms immediately upon arri-
val to the deployed location.

4.4.5. Earth-Filled Obstacles. Field expedient methods for constructing ob-
stacles such as log cribs can be very effective and necessary, particularly
when a unit is on the move or simply does not have access to other types of
materials. However, these methods can be labor-intensive and time-
consuming. If available, prefabricated materials can also be filled with earth
and used as obstacles. Examples of some prefabricated objects that can be
used along with sand, soil, rocks, or other natural materials include wire mesh
containers, sandbags, and 55-gallon drums (Figure 4.10). If available, they
can be earth-filled and used as obstacles for various purposes (i.e., block
roads and entry points, establish standoff, reinforce perimeters, control vehi-
cle traffic, etc.). In an austere environment, individuals are limited only by
their imagination in how readily available fill material can be used in con-
junction with prefabricated structures and materials to construct effective
obstacles. In addition, some of the same structures and materials that can be
used to create obstacles can also be stacked and used as revetments, which
will be covered in Chapter 5.

AFH 10-222 Volume 14 1 August 2008                                          83


4.4.6. Urban Rubble. In the urban environment, large chunks of concrete,
junked vehicles, and damaged equipment are a few examples of items that
can be used as obstacles (Figure 4.11). Built-up areas can naturally restrict
movement due to the amount of existing structures. These areas are normally
not used to beddown personnel deployed to overseas locations. However,
they may exist nearby and could be used as a staging area for enemy forces to
attack the base. Security personnel may use these areas as part of the base
defense. The use of urban rubble as obstacles can be further enhanced by cra-
tering streets, demolishing walls, and overturning or derailing heavy vehicles
or railroad cars. Roadblocks can be built from rubble or construction materi-
als. Barbed wire can be used to surround urban rubble for increased effec-
tiveness as obstacles. In this environment, personnel are only limited by their
imagination.

4.4.7. Concertina Wire Roadblocks. When laid in depth about 11 rows deep
across a roadway, strung concertina wire can be used as a roadblock (Figure
4.12). It is more effective when supported by pickets, and can also be used in
conjunction with steel hedgehogs. The materials needed to construct this ob-
stacle include 11 rolls of concertina wire, one roll of barbed wire, 30 long
pickets, and 22 short pickets. This material is enough to construct a concer-
tina wire obstacle approximately 33 feet in depth along the roadway. For en-
gineers experienced in laying concertina wire, this obstacle can be con-
structed in approximately one hour. Table 4.2 contains installation proce-
dures for the concertina wire roadblock.

4.4.8. Concertina Wire Fence. Concertina wire is commonly used as an ob-
stacle in the expeditionary environment. A triple-strand concertina wire fence
can be a very effective obstacle. This type of fence uses three rolls of stacked
concertina wire. One roll is stacked on top of two rolls running parallel to
each other, forming a pyramid. This obstacle can delay an intrusion long
enough to allow security forces to engage the enemy. Table 4.3 describes
installation procedures for triple-strand concertina wire fence.
Table 4.3. Installation Procedures – Triple-Strand Concertina Wire.
              Lay out front row of long pickets at 5-pace intervals; place
   1          short pickets 2 paces from each end (Figure 4.13)
              Place rear row of long pickets 1 meter behind front row and
   2          staggered; place short pickets 2 paces from each end
              Install pickets with the lower notch 4 inches aboveground;
   3          ensure the concave side of U-shaped picket faces enemy
              Position a roll of concertina wire at the 3rd picket in the front
   4          row, and every 4th picket thereafter
              Lift each roll of concertina wire on the front row and drop it
   5          over the long pickets; join ends as illustrated in Figure 4.14
              Fasten the bottom of the concertina wire to the ground by
   6          driving a staple over each pair of end hoops, one over the
              bottom of a coil at each long picket, and one at the l/2 and
              l/4 points of the 3.8-meter (12.5-foot) picket spacing
              Stretch a barbed wire strand along the top of each front row
   7          and fasten it to the tops of the long pickets, using the top eye
              tie for screw pickets. These wires are stretched as tightly as
              possible.
              Repeat the installation process for the back row, then install
   8          the top row and attach it to the back row

4.5. Prefabricated Obstacles. The remainder of this chapter focuses on those
obstacles that are usually prefabricated and moved into place as needed, and
those obstacles that are not usually considered expedient due to the time and
materials needed for construction.

4.5.1. Chain Link Fencing. Chain link fencing can be used to form a con-
tinuous obstacle around a site. Although they are considered obstacles to pe-
destrian traffic, fences are not very effective unless reinforced using cables or
other methods to prevent them from being easily breached. This can be ac-
complished with cable at least ¾-inch in diameter. The cable is strung at 30
inches and 35 inches above the ground (Figure 4.15). Fences can also be
used in conjunction with other security measures such as berms, earth-filled
containers, surveillance cameras, motion detectors, etc. Once constructed,
they should be inspected frequently to detect evidence of breaches and to
ensure any maintenance needed is identified. For additional details on design-
ing security fencing, reference MIL-HDBK-1013/10, Design Guidelines for
Security Fencing, Gates, Barriers, and Guard Facilities (will be republished
as UFC 4-022-03). If it is determined that fence construction should be ac-
complished via local contract, the specifications in UFGS-32 31 00.00 10,
UFGS-32 31 13.00 20, and UFGS-32 31 13.00 40 can be used in developing
the contract Performance Work Statement (PWS). This document, along with
any other UFGS documents, can be downloaded from the Whole Building
Design Guide (WBDG) website at http://www.wbdg.org.

4.5.2. Obscuration Screens. Perimeter obscuration screens are used to block
direct lines of sight to sensitive areas or facilities from outside the perimeter
of a site in an effort to reduce targeting opportunities from direct-fire weap-
ons. This can be done in various ways using trees, dense vegetation, chain
link fences with slats, wooden fences, camouflage netting, etc. Obscuration
screens are not usually designed or constructed to provide protection against
direct fire. If installed around facilities, place obscuration screens on the
side(s) facing the site’s perimeter to reduce exposure. Obscuration screens
can also be placed on perimeter fences to block lines of sight into the camp
area (Figure 4.16). When using obscuration screens on fences, make sure
personnel inside the site or facility are still able to see outside and observe
any suspicious activities.
Figure 4.16. Obscuration Screen on Perimeter Fence.
AFH 10-222 Volume 14 1 August 2008                                         90


4.5.3. Predetonation Screens. Predetonation screens are used to detonate
antitank weapons and dissipate the effects between the area where the screen
is constructed and the weapons’ primary target (Figure 4.17). The screen can
be constructed of wood, solid fencing material, etc. It is usually constructed
between 10 to 40 feet from the structures it is intended to protect. For addi-
tional information on constructing and siting predetonation screens, refer to
UFC 4-020-03FA. A predetonation screen may have several effects. Hope-
fully, it will damage the fuze on the weapon, causing it to dud. The structure
being protected must still be capable of defeating the kinetic energy of the
fired round. The primary purpose is to detonate an antitank rocket when it
strikes the screen. In this case, the combination of standoff distance and the
construction of the protected facility must defeat the gas jet from the shaped
charge. Antitank rounds emit a concentrated stream of molten metal upon
detonation (known as shaped charge) capable of penetrating several inches of
steel. The predetonation screen must cause the round to detonate far enough
from the asset to mitigate the damage from the molten material and spent
rocket engine.
Figure 4.17. Predetonation Screening.
AFH 10-222 Volume 14 1 August 2008                                            91


4.5.4. Concrete Barriers. With the exception of the Jersey barrier, most con-
crete barriers currently being used throughout Southwest Asia are from 8 to
12 feet tall, 4 to 6 feet wide, weigh between 10,000 and 20,000 pounds, and
are usually reinforced with steel (Figure 4.18). Tall concrete barriers, such as
the Texas barrier and Alaska barrier, are being used for various reasons, in-
cluding protection from the effects of blast and fragmentation. The effective-
ness of these barriers depends on their thickness, height, and distance from
the asset being protected. If a barrier breaks apart as a result of a detonation,
the debris generated from the barrier itself becomes secondary fragmentation
and can be quite lethal, offsetting efforts to reduce the effects of fragmenta-
tion. When planning to deploy these types of barriers throughout the site, the
civil engineer planner must consider the heavy equipment (e.g., cranes, flat-
bed trailers) that will be needed to transport and maneuver these structures
into place. Once barriers are in place, earth-filled containers or soil berms can
be used to reinforce them to prevent secondary fragmentation in the event the
barrier breaks apart from the force of a detonation. Detail drawings of all
types of concrete barriers can be downloaded from the AFCESA AT/FP In-
stallation Engineering Community of Practice at:
https://wwwd.my.af.mil/afknprod/ASPs/CoP/OpenCoP.asp?Filter=OO-EN-
CE-A7.

4.5.5. Vehicle Barriers. Vehicle barriers are categorized as either active or
passive. Active and passive barriers can be fixed or movable, depending on
how they are made, operated, or used. Some commercial barriers are dual-
classified when they meet the requirements for both categories (e.g., fixed-
active, portable, passive). Fixed vehicle barriers are permanently installed and
usually require heavy equipment to move or dismantle. Examples include
hydraulically-operated rotation or retracting systems, pits, and concrete or
steel barriers. Portable vehicle barriers are those barriers that can be easily
relocated if needed. However, heavy equipment may be required in some
cases to lift and transport these types of barriers. The following paragraphs
briefly describe some of the types of vehicle barriers that can be used in the
expeditionary environment. For details on selection and application of vehicle
barriers, refer to UFC 4-022-02. In addition, a list of DOD-certified anti-ram
vehicle barriers can be downloaded from the USACE PDC website at
https://pdc.usace.army.mil. The list is updated periodically as different types
of anti-ram vehicle devices are crash-tested.

4.5.5.1. Active Vehicle Barriers. Active barriers are those with moving parts
that require some action, either by personnel, equipment, or both. These are
mechanical devices used primarily to block access by vehicles that are a
potential threat. A couple of examples of active vehicle barriers are shown in
Figure 4.19 and Figure 4.20. In addition to those illustrated, active barriers
include retractable bollards, beams, and sliding gates. Most of these barriers
will require civil engineer support for setup and installation. More permanent
types of active barriers are usually purchased through supply channels,
moved into place using heavy equipment, and installed in accordance with
the manufacturer’s instructions. For planning purposes, UFC 4-022-02
contains barrier performance ratings and cost data for different types of active
barriers. It may also be possible to obtain contract support for on-site
construction of active vehicle barriers. If this option is being considered, refer
to UFGS 34 71 13.19, Active Vehicle Barriers, when constructing
performance work statements. This document can be downloaded from the
WBDG website at http://www.wbdg.org/.

4.5.5.2. Passive Vehicle Barriers. Unlike active barriers, passive vehicle
barriers have no moving parts. Their effectiveness relies upon their ability to
absorb energy and transmit that energy into the foundation. The following
paragraphs briefly describe some types of passive vehicle barriers.

4.5.5.2.1. Jersey Barriers. Jersey barriers (Figure 4.21) are typically em-
ployed for countermobility around entry control points and approach avenues.
They can be staggered on roads to create serpentine paths, forcing drivers to
slow down to negotiate curves prior to reaching the entry point. They can also
be used to establish site boundaries. To be an effective vehicle barriers, they
must be anchored to the surface and/or cabled together (along straight paths)
to provide added strength and resistance.
Figure 4.21. Jersey Barrier.
AFH 10-222 Volume 14 1 August 2008                                           95


4.5.5.2.2. Fixed Bollards. Fixed bollards are excellent obstacles for anti-ram
protection. In the field environments, these obstacles can be constructed of ½-
inch thick steel pipe about 8 inches in diameter and 7 feet long. The pipes are
filled with concrete and anchored into a 4-foot concrete footing so they pro-
ject 3 feet above the ground (Figure 4.22). The pipes should be spaced no
more than 4 feet apart. Fixed bollards can be placed inside or outside existing
fences to channel vehicle traffic away from certain areas or prevent vehicular
access into certain areas. When planning for fixed barriers such as these, sev-
eral factors such as future site expansion and possible relocation of facilities
and other structures should be taken into consideration. These types of activi-
ties may require fixed bollards to be excavated and reconstructed in other
areas. Also, be careful not to place permanent barriers in areas where emer-
gency response vehicles may need to gain access in the event of an attack or
other emergency.
Figure 4.22. Fixed Bollards.
AFH 10-222 Volume 14 1 August 2008                                           96


4.5.5.2.3. Removable Posts. Removable posts can be set in a prefabricated
concrete base constructed under the road (Figure 4.23). Steel posts, such as
heavy-walled, 6-inch diameter pipes or steel I-beams approximately 7 feet
long, can be used. A 30-inch long steel pipe sleeve is constructed into the
base and slightly recessed from the top. The inside diameter of the sleeve
should be just large enough to accommodate the posts. The number of rows
and spacing may depend upon the availability of time, materials, threat, and
location. Pipes can be filled with concrete for additional strength. Stagger the
sleeves as indicated, maintaining 4 to 5 feet between posts and 18 inches to
the front and back of each row. Keep rows about 10 feet apart. Cover the
sleeves when not in use to keep out debris. When required, remove the covers
and drop the posts into place (heavy equipment may be needed). Lift handles
can be welded to the posts for easy removal, and concertina wire can be
strung throughout the rows to complicate removal by enemy forces.
Figure 4.23. Removable Posts.
AFH 10-222 Volume 14 1 August 2008                                          97


4.5.5.2.4. Concrete Cubes and Cylinders. Concrete cubes and cylinders can
be effective obstacles. Cubes and cylinders of concrete (Figure 4.24) can be
cast in place or precast and moved into place. Place the obstacles in irregular
patterns to prevent wheeled and tracked vehicles from moving between them
or pushing the obstacles out of position. They can be used between buildings
or on top of elevated roadways to block traffic. To be effective vehicle barri-
ers, they must be cabled together.
Figure 4.24. Typical Concrete Cube and Cylinder.




4.5.5.2.5. Concrete Tetrahedrons and Dragon’s Tooth. Concrete tetrahe-
drons are pyramids with a triangular base, while dragon’s teeth are concrete
pyramids with a square base (Figure 4.25). These obstacles are effective in
stopping vehicles where access is restricted (i.e., roadways between build-
ings). Dragon’s teeth are employed in multiple rows across an avenue of ap-
proach. Space the dragon’s teeth about 4 to 5 feet between teeth and rows
across the avenue of approach; rows can be aligned or staggered. They must
be cabled together o be effective vehicle barriers.

4.5.5.2.6. Steel Hedgehogs. Hedgehogs are made using three pieces of angle
iron 4 inches by 4 inches and approximately 4 feet long. The pieces are
welded to a 4-inch steel plate (Figure 4.26). They can weigh up to 160
pounds. They are designed to rotate under vehicles and puncture or overturn
them. They perform well in areas with high vegetation where they can be
concealed. Exposed parts can be painted to blend with the terrain. Steel
hedgehogs must be cabled together to be effective vehicle barriers.

                               REVETMENTS
5.1. Overview. Revetments are generally defined as raised walls or structures
designed to provide protection against bombs, rockets, grenades, small arms
fire, and the effects of blast and fragmentation. Revetments can be as simple
as a wall of sandbags or as elaborate as major construction projects involving
permanent, hardened revetments and aircraft shelters (Figure 5.1). Revet-
ments of sufficient height can be used to provide full sidewall protection
around open stores of critical equipment and material assets. Revetments can
also function as obstacles to vehicles and other forms of possible intrusion. In
the expeditionary environment, revetments are commonly composed of a soil
berm and some type of structural material used as a retaining wall to hold
back and stabilize the mass of earth. This type of revetment can be very effec-
tive against blast and fragmentation effects. This chapter covers the different
types of revetments that can be used for a variety of purposes in the expedi-
tionary environment.
Figure 5.1. Various Types of Revetments.
AFH 10-222 Volume 14 1 August 2008                                           100


5.2. Berms. Time available to conduct comprehensive planning during initial
stages of deployments can be very limited. Logistical support needed to
immediately implement force protection measures may also be difficult at the
height of a military campaign. Initially, earthen berms may be the engineer’s
best option for protecting military personnel and mission-critical assets.
Properly sited, constructed, and maintained, berms can mitigate blast and
fragmentation effects from near-miss explosions caused by mortars, rockets,
or artillery shells. They are particularly effective against explosions that pro-
duce blast effects moving at high velocities and generating low-angle frag-
ments along the ground’s surface. In austere environments, berms can be used
to define boundaries, act as barriers, reduce noise, and obstruct lines of sight.
The height of force protection berms can be anywhere from 6 to 12 feet.
Required heights are usually based on the height of equipment or structures to
be protected and known threats within the area or region. While berms and
other types of revetments, such as those constructed from sandbags or timber,
provide similar stopping ability for high-explosive detonations and projec-
tiles, earth berms provide better protection against multiple or repeated at-
tacks. When an earth berm is hit, its mass tends to engulf the round, and
ejected matter falls back onto the berm. Berms can be freestanding, supported
by different methods of revetting, or built directly upon structures for
protection. They can also be used to reinforce other protective measures such
as reinforced fences, concrete structures, sandbags, or earth-filled containers
structures. Regardless of the purpose or type of berm being constructed, much
soil will be needed. Berm construction also requires heavy equipment (i.e.,
dump truck, backhoe, bulldozer, roller compactor, etc.) to move large masses
of soil around and skilled equipment operators. Engineers must take these
factors into consideration while planning for force protection. It is important
to note that earth berms, because of their shapes (i.e., low-sloped faces, lim-
ited heights, etc.), have limited effectiveness in protecting certain weapon
systems and critical aircraft support operations; therefore, additional meas-
ures may need to be employed. The next few paragraphs describe the use of
berms in the expeditionary environment. Additional information on different
types of berms can be downloaded from TCMS.
AFH 10-222 Volume 14 1 August 2008                                            101


5.2.1. Free-Standing Berms. When designing free-standing berms, key ele-
ments to consider are height, thickness, and slope. Also keep in mind the
need to use natural vegetation, geotextile fabric, and/or a drainage system to
prevent erosion. If camouflage and concealment are important, consider add-
ing more vegetation and varying the berm’s width and height along the pe-
rimeter to reduce its visual signature. The next few paragraphs cover basic
considerations for designing and constructing free-standing berms.
5.2.1.1. Berm Height. Berm heights (Figure 5.2) are usually determined by
the height of the asset(s) to be protected. If the asset to be protected is 6 feet
tall, the berm will need to be at least that height for adequate protection.
Figure 5.2. Berm Height.




5.2.1.2. Berm Thickness. Required thickness is usually determined by the
desired level of protection for the asset(s) and any known threats. Security
and Intelligence personnel will be involved in making this determination. A
berm’s thickness is measured at its crest (Figure 5.3), which is where the
slope of the berm levels off. A small slope is still maintained at the crest to
allow for drainage and prevent ponding. If the berm’s required thickness is
determined to be 36 inches, the berm must be 36 inches thick at its crest.
Attachment 2 contains information on various thicknesses of materials
needed to protect against certain threats. For practical purposes (e.g., mainte-
nance), the crest of a free-standing berm is usually between 2 and 3 feet.
Figure 5.3. Berm Thickness.
AFH 10-222 Volume 14 1 August 2008                                            102


5.2.1.3. Berm Slope. The slope of a free-standing berm is approximately
equal to the soil’s internal angle of friction or angle of repose (Figure 5.4).
The angle of repose is the steepest grade at which the type of soil used will
remain in place without reinforcement. If granular or loose soils are used for
construction, it will be difficult to obtain a steep slope since the angle of re-
pose places limits on the capability to form a steep slope without reinforce-
ment. If more cohesive soils (e.g., soils containing clay) are used, it is possi-
ble to form a steeper slope because the soil will remain in place at steeper
angles than it would with loose or granular soils. A berm’s slope is described
as its vertical to horizontal distance (V:H) as measured from the center of the
berm. For force protection berms, the slope is normally between 1:1 and 1:2.
Let’s suppose the height (vertical length) of a berm with a 1:1 slope needs to
be 10 feet tall, with a 3-foot crest. Without considering the crest size initially,
the horizontal length of the berm from the center would also be 10 feet (1:1
slope). However, with a 3 foot crest, the horizontal length of the berm (from
its center) will be equal to the height of the berm plus 1 foot and 6 inches, or
11 feet and 6 inches. The additional length accounts for ½ the length of the
berm’s crest (3 feet), which is a relatively horizontal surface. Using the same
example, we can determine that the total horizontal length of an 11-foot berm
with a 1:1 slope and 3 foot crest would be approximately 23 feet (11feet and
6 inches + 11 feet and 6 inches). Figure 5.5 illustrates the difference between
berms with slopes between 1:1 and 1:2. Note that the slope gets less steep as
the angle of repose decreases. If berm slopes need to be steeper than is possi-
ble with the type of soil being used, reinforcement will be required. Some
concepts of berm reinforcement are covered in the next few paragraphs.

5.2.2. Structurally-Supported Berms. Berms can be supported by bracing
or other means of structural support which allows them to be constructed
much closer to critical assets than free-standing berms (Figure 5.6). Precast
concrete retaining walls are an excellent means of structural support for
berms. If precast concrete obstacles are not available, expedient retaining
walls can be built using plywood, corrugated metal, landing mats, or what-
ever sturdy material might be available with enough strength to provide the
needed support. Bracing material can be tied to deadman supports that are
either exposed on the face of the berm or buried underneath (Figure 5.7).
When constructing these types of berms, remember to allow enough room
between the structure and the face of the berm to allow personnel space to
maneuver heavy equipment or other support needed to perform berm mainte-
nance.

5.2.2.1. Reinforcing Berms. Berms can be used to provide additional
strength to other barriers such as concrete structures. If an existing above-
ground concrete wall can resist airblast loads but the wall thickness is not
sufficient to prevent concrete spall from airblast and fragments, a soil berm
placed against the wall is almost always the most economical way to prevent
spall (Figure 5.8). Sandbags can be used to reinforce the berm’s face, espe-
cially if the berm is constructed of granular materials. Berms can also be built
directly upon the structure they are intended to protect (Figure 5.9). In some
cases (dictated by the threat), berms can be built upon a structure and contin-
ued over the top of the structure. Engineers with experience in structural
analyses must make the determination on whether any structure can support
additional loading from berming.

5.2.2.2. Berms and Retaining Walls. If precast concrete revetments are not
available for expediency, berms can be constructed against retaining walls if
the proper materials are available. Building a berm against a retaining wall
allows the berm to be located closer to the asset (Figure 5.10). Close place-
ment provides a greater degree of protection from the effects of blast and
fragmentation. Retaining walls should be no more than 11 feet high. One-
sided retaining walls may also be built with 6- by 12-foot posts, 4- by 4-foot
horizontal runners, and a sheathing surface of at least 1½ inches of plywood,
heavier gauge (16 gauge or better) corrugated metal, or landing mats. Posts
should be set at least 4 feet into the ground and no more than 4 feet apart. On
the berm side of the posts, starting at ground level, nail horizontal runners to
the posts at no more than 2 feet apart for each runner. Fill in between the 4-
by 4-foot runners by nailing short sections of 4- by 4-foot pieces to the posts
between runners. Fasten the plywood or metal sheathing to the 4 x 4s. There
are two ways to anchor the retaining walls to each post. The more protected
way is to anchor each post approximately two-thirds the height of the berm to
deadman anchors that will be located under the berm material. Use at least
3/8-inch guy cable run on a 3:1 slope (vertical to horizontal) down to the
deadman anchor. The alternative method is to anchor each post to three indi-
vidual deadman anchors placed along the face of the berm. While this can
help stabilize the berm, it exposes the anchors to more damage from blast.

5.3. Sandbag Revetments. Walls can be built from sandbags in much the
same way as bricks are used to construct walls. Keep in mind, however, that
sandbag revetments require a lot of time and labor. In addition, sandbags tend
to deteriorate in extreme weather environments. While planning, purchasing,
or ordering sandbags, keep in mind that all sandbags are not made of the
same material and are therefore not of the same quality. For limited use,
sandbags of lesser quality can be used. However, for prolonged use under
extreme weather conditions, a higher quality sandbag may be needed. The
following paragraph covers the different types of sandbags that can be used
and procedures for building sandbag revetments.
5.3.1. Types of Sandbags. Sandbags most commonly used during contingen-
cies are made from cotton, polypropylene, or acrylic materials. The polypro-
pylene sandbags tend to last longer than cotton sandbags. Acrylic sandbags
(quickly replacing cotton and polypropylene bags) are rot and weather resis-
tant. The US Army Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC)
conducted a study of sandbag materials’ ultraviolet (UV) resistance to
determine which products provide optimal service life considering unique
exposure conditions in areas such as Southwest Asia (SWA). The study
focused on identifying what material maintained tensile strength (property
associated with the material’s integrity) under prolonged exposure to UV
radiation. The study concluded cotton duck material performs best under
these conditions, followed by acrylic materials, which also performed well.
Table 5.1 contains national stock numbers for sandbags approved for use by
DOD and available through regional defense supply centers.

5.3.2. Siting Sandbag Revetments. Sandbag revetments may not provide
effective protection from blast overpressure if not properly sited. These types
of revetments may be effective against fragmentation effects; however, unless
the shielding can be located very close to the asset as shown in Figure 5.11,
blast overpressure may still impact the asset. If revetments are sited close
enough to the protected asset, they may be able to deflect the blast wave over
the asset to prevent damage. If a structure can withstand the additional side
load, sandbag revetments can also be built with a straight face against the
wall of the structure (Figure 5.12).
Figure 5.11. Sandbag Revetment Close to Protected Asset.




Figure 5.12. Sandbag Revetment Built Against a Structure.
AFH 10-222 Volume 14 1 August 2008                                          110


5.3.3. Sandbag Revetment Construction Details. After properly siting the
location for sandbag revetments, begin by filling the bags approximately 3/4
full with soil or a soil-cement mixture. Overfilling the sandbags will prevent
them from being flattened or shaped. To fill in voids between bags, fill bags
with less soil. The useful life of sandbags can be prolonged by filling them
with a mixture of dry earth and cement, normally in the ratio of 1 part cement
to 10 parts dry earth. The cement sets as the bags take on moisture. A ratio of
1:6 should be used for a sand-gravel mixture. To expedite the sandbag filling
process, an expedient sandbag filler such as that illustrated in Figure 5.13,
can be constructed if materials are available. Prefabricated sandbag fillers can
also be purchased commercially (check with the servicing logistics function).
Figure 5.13. Expedient Sandbag Filler.
AFH 10-222 Volume 14 1 August 2008                                         111


5.3.3.1. Free-Standing Sandbag Revetment. For a free-standing revetment,
the sandbags should be sloped between 4:1 and 5:1 (vertical to horizontal) for
any structure over 2 feet (Figure 5.14). Construct the bottom row of the re-
vetment with sandbags placed as headers; then, alternate rows of headers and
stretchers as indicated, staggering the joints between layers of sandbags. Each
sandbag should be pounded with a flat object, such as a 2- by 4-inch board, to
make the wall more stable. Stretchers should be placed with the sewn seams
facing towards the reveted face, while headers are placed with the tied ends
facing towards the reveted face. Ensure the top row of the revetment consist
of headers. Before constructing sandbag revetments, determine if the base of
the structure will need to be reinforced.

5.3.3.2. Partially-Braced Sandbag Structure. Additional strength and sta-
bility can be provided to a sandbagged revetment by creating a partially-
braced structure. Use landing mats, corrugated metal sheets, reinforced ply-
wood, or other structural facing material on the vertical surface of the revet-
ment and tie it to the sloped face for support (Figure 5.15).

5.4. Metal Revetments. Metal bin revetments are designed to provide shelter
or protection from low-angle, high-velocity fragments, shrapnel, and impro-
vised explosive devices. They can also be used as anti-ram vehicle barriers.
These types of revetments are made from some type of roll-formed metal,
typically 16-gauge or 18-gauge steel.
5.4.1. B-1 Revetment. The B-1 revetment comes in a kit that provides a 16-
foot high, 82-inch wide, and 252-foot long steel bin revetment (Figure 5.16).
Due to the large concentrated mass of fill material required for this revetment,
it must be constructed on a stabilized ground surface or pavement. The cell
sections of the revetment are assembled in place or can be assembled on the
ground and lifted into place with the use of a crane. When filling, use a po-
rous material or a 1/2- to 3/4-inch gravel layer at the bottom to allow for
drainage, an impervious sheeting material along the sides to contain soil ma-
terial, and a waterproof cap to prevent fill saturation or FOD hazards. For
details on constructing B-1 revetments, refer to procedures outlined in TO
35E4-170-2, Aircraft Revetment Kit, Type B-1.

AFH 10-222 Volume 14 1 August 2008                                        114


5.4.2. Corrugated Galvanized Steel Revetments. The US Army ERDC
developed metal revetments as an alternative to soil-filled geotextile revet-
ments to address longevity issues related to severe environmental conditions
(Figure 5.17). The design and technology are based on the B-1 revetment,
weapons threats in SWA, and the reduced footprint needed for logistical re-
quirements. Several kits were developed and are available through the De-
fense Supply Centers. Table 5.2 contains specifications and ordering infor-
mation for these revetments. The overall pallet size for each kit is 37 inches
wide, 100 inches long, and 19 inches high. For additional information, con-
tact the servicing logistics function.

5.5. Precast Concrete Revetments. The use of precast concrete revetments
(also referred to as concrete retaining walls) is an effective expedient method
for protecting critical assets (Figure 5.18). They can be used in areas that
require protection from fragmentation, airblast from near-miss general-
purpose bombs, and high explosive artillery shells, rockets, mortars, and
small arms. If used without berming, they provide good protection against a
first strike, but limited protection from repeated or multiple attacks due to
susceptibility to fragment damage and spalling. During repeated attacks,
weakened or displaced slabs can break apart and become secondary fragmen-
tation, posing yet another threat. The edges of most revetments do not have
overlapping surfaces at the corners. The corners may require additional rein-
forcement (e.g., sandbags). If concrete revetments can be acquired locally,
ensure the material used to construct these revetments meets military stan-
dards of construction. Also, be aware that equipment (i.e., flatbed trailer,
forklift, crane, etc.) will be needed to move and place these revetments.

AFH 10-222 Volume 14 1 August 2008                                          116


5.6. Precast Concrete Wall. The portable precast concrete wall consists of a
wall section with two notches that fit into two separate, notched footings of
precast concrete (Figure 5.19). This type of revetment can be from 5 to 15
feet high, 6 feet wide, and 6 inches thick. The freestanding units can be butted
together side-by-side and at 90-degree corners; they can also be enhanced
with berms. Additional details on constructing and erecting precast concrete
wall revetments can be downloaded from TCMS.
Figure 5.19. Precast Concrete Wall.
AFH 10-222 Volume 14 1 August 2008                                        117


5.7. Soil-Cement Revetments. Soil-cement revetments provide greater pro-
tection from fragmentation and require less surface area than earthen berms
(Figure 5.20). The walls of these revetments can be constructed with a 10:1
vertical-to-horizontal slope with a crest at least two feet thick. However, be
aware that formwork and proper mixing equipment are required for construc-
tion. Depending on the wall’s height, the foundation may require a higher
bearing capacity than a soil berm and may have to be improved with a mix-
ture of cement. In addition, walls with significant heights may need to be
built in several lifts. If possible, build the formwork strong enough to allow
forming in one or two lifts. If lifts are used, consider using some form of
doweling between the lifts. The amount of water needed to moisten the mix-
ture and allow cement hydration and the ratio of cement-to-soil (by weight)
will vary based on soil type. Generally, 1-part Portland cement to 10 parts
soil is used for soil-cement construction.
Figure 5.20. Soil-Cement Revetment.
AFH 10-222 Volume 14 1 August 2008                                          118


5.8. Concrete Culverts. Precast concrete culverts are constructed in various
sizes, but are usually limited to 8-foot lengths for ease of handling. If the
concrete culvert’s outside diameter is at least 30 inches, it can be used for
protective construction. Larger diameter culverts (up to 6 feet in diameter)
can also be used. The culverts are stood up on end to stabilize the foundation
and positioned closely together. If possible, obtain straight-sided culverts
(without grooved ends) so they can be placed together vertically without any
gaps between them. If the culverts have bell ends, place the larger bell ends
down and fill in the gaps between rows with filled, smaller diameter PVC
pipe or concrete culverts. Use at least two rows of culverts, and stagger the
joints as indicated in Figure 5.21. If available, drive steel dowels or pipes
into the ground at the center of each pipe to stabilize them. Fill the culverts
with dry sand or soil and cap the tops with at least 10 inches of concrete and a
short length of exposed dowel or pipe. Tie the dowels together by welding
reinforcing bars to the dowels on each row and between the opposite two
adjoining culverts. Do not stack culverts on top of each other. Be aware that
concrete culverts come in various strengths to resist traffic loads. Culverts
with little traffic loading capacity are usually constructed with lower quality
concrete and less reinforcing, making them unsuitable for use.

AFH 10-222 Volume 14 1 August 2008                                           119


5.9. Timber and Lumber Revetments. There is little difference between
timber and lumber revetments except the raw materials. They are both built
like plywood walls, except that the inside facing material is either saplings or
lumber (Figure 5.22). The facing timbers of the timber revetment are usually
2- to 3-inch sapling trunks laid parallel, one on top of the other and fitted to-
gether to avoid gaps. The facing lumber of a lumber revetment is a minimum
2-inch thick board or 2 inches of layered plywood sheathing. For a timber
revetment, the posts are usually 6 inches in diameter and spaced no more than
2 feet apart, while lumber revetments use 2- by 4-inch studs spaced about 12
inches apart. The posts are normally set 2 feet into the ground for bracing and
have 3 tie-cables run between opposite posts. One cable provides a tie at mid-
height, while the other two cables are at about 1/6 the height from the top and
the bottom, respectively. As a minimum, every other post is tied. The ends of
the revetments are blocked with additional posts of timber or lumber; there-
fore, the minimum width of the revetment can be greater than the plywood
wall type revetment. As a minimum, the walls are built in cells every 10 feet.
A cross-braced wall is built within the lumber revetment by using 2 sets of 4-
by 4-inch posts set 2 inches apart to create a slot on the inside of each wall.
Then 2-inch thick lumber is stacked in the slot to create a cross-braced wall
section. For the timber wall, two sets of the 6-inch diameter posts are set
about 3 inches apart on each side of the wall. Cross members are notched and
stacked to fit into the facing logs. Timber and lumber revetments are filled
with soil to provide strength and stability for these expedient structures.
Figure 5.22. Timber and Lumber Revetments.
AFH 10-222 Volume 14 1 August 2008                                            120


5.10. Sand Grid Revetments. Sand grids are prefabricated forms that expand
into honeycomb-shaped cells used to confine fill material such as sand or
gravel. Original grids were 38 inches wide, 8 inches high, and 20 feet long
when expanded. Grids with varying sizes (e.g., widths up to 8 feet) are now
available. Figure 5.23 illustrates how sand grid revetments are constructed.
Grids are laid out over metal pickets at each end and stacked one layer upon
the next. The maximum freestanding height for a revetment 38 inches wide is
8 feet (12 layers), although only a height of 6 feet (9 layers) are recom-
mended unless additional picket anchors are added to the standard anchors.
To achieve additional height, lower rows should be laid with either wider
sand grids or additional rows of sand grids run parallel, face to face. Middle
and upper rows are made with narrower sand grids. Make sure all rows have
anchor pickets or additional intermediate pickets extending to several adjoin-
ing layers. If rows are run parallel, face to face, tie the rows together for sta-
bility. To prevent erosion and soil loss with sand grids that are not notched,
place a geotextile fabric between each layer of sand grid and cover the top
layer with impervious sheeting and sandbags. For additional details on con-
structing sand grids, refer to the manufacturer’s instructions or access TCMS.

AFH 10-222 Volume 14 1 August 2008                                             121


5.11. Earth-Filled Container Revetments. Earth-filled container revetments
have proven to be very effective in protecting critical assets in expeditionary
environments. When planning to use these materials for revetment construc-
tion, keep in mind that small hand tools and heavy equipment, such as front-
end loaders, cranes with buckets and dump trucks, will also be needed. The
following paragraphs describe typical construction of a revetment using
earth-filled containers. For details on infill procedures, refer to Chapter 2. In
addition, detailed information on constructing various types of revetments
using wire mesh containers can be found in the manufacturer’s instructions or
downloaded from TCMS.
5.11.1. Site Selection and Preparation. Revetments must be constructed on
well-drained, flat, and stable surfaces. If necessary, follow the guidance in
Chapter 2 to improve surface areas where revetments will be constructed.
5.11.2. Materials. Constructing a revetment 9 feet high and 8 feet long might
require approximately 6 sections of wire mesh container sections, assuming
there are 9 bays per section, and each bay is 56 inches high and 42 inches
wide.
5.11.3. First Layer. Once a site is selected, lay out the units as depicted in
Figure 5.24, ensuring the attached plastic wire ties are located at the top.
Overlap the coil hinges located at the common corners between sections, and
insert the connecting pin (Figure 5.25). Once all three sections of the first
layer are connected, expand the bays 2 to 4 inches and begin filling the corner
bays, and then every 8th to 12th bay thereafter with 1 foot of lightly com-
pacted fill placed in two 6-inch lifts to anchor the layer for the remaining fill.
Once anchored, fill the remaining bays. Use manual hand tampers or lightly
compact the fill material by foot – do not use compacting equipment.
5.11.4. Second Layer. Arrange units as illustrated in Figure 5.26. Connect
the second layer to the first layer using the plastic ties. Fill the units with soil
and make sure it is very well compacted. Upon completing the second layer,
conduct a quick visual inspection, making sure the walls are straight, there is
no excessive movement of the walls, and that adequate clear distance is pro-
vided between the walls.

5.12. Siting Revetments. Revetments must be properly sited to mitigate the
effects of blast and fragmentation. Some basic principles for siting large
structural revetments are listed in Table 5.3. In general, revetments should be
sited as close as possible to protected assets. If not, fragmentation effects may
be mitigated but the blast overpressure can still cause damage since blast
waves tend to reform after traveling over objects. Figure 5.27 and Figure
5.28 are examples of improperly and properly sited revetments. When siting
revetments, safe operational clearance for assets such as aircraft must also be
considered. With the exception of revetments designed for parked aircraft,
most revetments are designed to prevent straight-in access to the assets being
protected. Aircraft revetments, in particular must be arranged in a manner that
prevents propagation between cells of multiple revetments. This is a major
concern for engineers. When aircraft loaded with cannon rounds, rockets,
missiles, and bombs are exposed to extreme heat from a detonation or from
other burning aircraft, the weapons may tend to cook-off and detonate or
launch. By dispersing aircraft such that cells do not face each other and fuel
drains away from other aircraft, propagation can be limited (Figure 5.29). If
dispersal is not possible, such as on an aircraft parking or refueling ramp,
clusters of revetments (Figure 5.30) can be used. Figure 5.31 illustrates
Table 5.3. Principles for Siting Large Structural Revetments.
        Step                               Action
         1     Align revetments in a manner that will block direct paths to
               the protected asset and prevent or mitigate the effects of
               fragmentation from a nearby weapons detonation
          2    Extend revetments far enough past the protected asset to cut
               down the angles of exposure.
          3    Where revetments are not connected, overlap them to
               eliminate any direct paths to the protected assets
          4    If revetments cannot be overlapped (e.g., entrance corners),
               develop alternative methods for protecting the assets from
               the effects of blast and fragmentation at these openings (i.e.,
               portable concrete revetments, sandbag revetments, etc.).
          5    When angles of exposure cannot be decreased (e.g. aircraft
               revetments), do not place decoys in areas to block exposure

Antiterrorism—Defensive measures used to reduce the vulnerability of in-
dividuals and property to terrorist acts, to include limited response and con-
tainment by local military forces. Also called AT.
Building Hardening—Enhanced conventional construction that mitigates
threat hazards where standoff distance is limited. Building hardening may
also be considered to include the prohibition of certain building materials and
construction techniques.
Building Separation—The distance between closest points on the exterior
walls of adjacent buildings or structures.
Combating Terrorism—Combating terrorism within the DOD encompasses
all actions, including antiterrorism (defensive measures taken to reduce vul-
nerability to terrorist acts), counterterrorism (offensive measures taken to
prevent, deter, and respond to terrorism), terrorism consequence management
(preparation for and response to the consequences of a terrorist inci-
dent/event), and intelligence support (collection and dissemination of terror-
ism-related information) taken to oppose terrorism throughout the entire
AFH 10-222 Volume 14 1 August 2008                                          134


threat spectrum, to include terrorist use of chemical, biological, radiological,
nuclear materials or high-yield explosive devices (CBRNE).
Controlled Perimeter—A physical boundary at the perimeter of a site where
vehicle access is controlled, an area within an installation, or another area
with restricted access. A physical boundary sufficient to channel vehicles to
access control points. Access control at a controlled perimeter requires the
demonstrated capability to search for and detect explosives. Where the con-
trolled perimeter includes a shoreline and there is no defined perimeter be-
yond the shoreline, the boundary will be at the mean high water mark.
Counterterrorism—Offensive measures taken to prevent, deter, and respond
to terrorism. Also called CT.
Criticality Assessment—The process used to systematically identify key
assets (i.e., personnel, equipment, buildings, etc.) based on their importance
to the mission or function and are deemed mission critical by commanders.
Deterrence—The prevention from action by fear of the consequences based
on the existence of a credible threat of unacceptable counteraction.
DOD Building—Any building or portion of a building (permanent, tempo-
rary, or expeditionary) owned, leased, privatized, or otherwise occupied,
managed, or controlled by or for DOD. DOD buildings are categorized as
uninhabited, inhabited, primary gathering, and billeting.
Expeditionary Structures—Those structures intended to be inhabited for no
more than 1 year after they are erected. This group of structures typically
includes tents, Small and Medium Shelter Systems, Expandable Shelter Con-
tainers (ESC), ISO and CONEX containers, General Purpose (GP) Medium
tents, and GP Large tents.
Force Protection—Commander's program designed to protect Service mem-
bers, civilian employees, family members, facilities, information, and equip-
ment in all locations and situations; accomplished through planned and inte-
grated application of combating terrorism, physical security, operations secu-
rity, and personal protective services and supported by intelligence, counter-
intelligence, and other security programs.
AFH 10-222 Volume 14 1 August 2008                                         135


Improvised Explosive Device (IED)—Device fabricated in an improvised
manner incorporating destructive, lethal, noxious, pyrotechnic, or incendiary
chemicals designed to destroy, incapacitate, harass, or distract. May incorpo-
rate military stores but usually made from nonmilitary components.
Information Security—Protection of classified information that is stored on
computers or transmitted by radio, telephone, or any other means.
Inhabited Building—Buildings or portions of buildings routinely occupied
by 11 or more DOD personnel and with a population density of greater than
one person per 40 gross square meters (430 gross square feet). This density
generally excludes industrial, maintenance, and storage facilities, except for
more densely populated portions of those buildings such as administrative
areas. The inhabited building designation also applies to expeditionary and
temporary structures with similar population densities. In a building that
meets the criterion of having 11 or more personnel, with portions that do not
have sufficient population densities to qualify as inhabited buildings, those
portions that have sufficient population densities will be considered inhabited
buildings while the remainder of the building may be considered uninhabited,
subject to provisions of these standards. EXAMPLE: a hangar with an admin-
istrative area. The administrative area would be treated as an inhabited build-
ing and the remainder of the hangar could be treated as uninhabited.
Level of Protection—The degree to which an asset (person, equipment, ob-
ject, etc.) is protected against injury or damage from an attack.
Obscuration Screen—A physical structure or some other element used to
block the line of sight to a potential target.
Obstacle—Any obstruction designed or employed to disrupt, fix, turn, or
block movement of an opposing force, and to impose additional losses in
personnel, time, and equipment on the opposing force. Obstacles can exist
naturally, be constructed, or a combination of both.
Operations Security—An analytic process used to deny an adversary infor-
mation - generally unclassified - concerning friendly intentions and capabili-
ties by identifying, controlling, and protecting indicators associated with
AFH 10-222 Volume 14 1 August 2008                                           136


planning processes or operations. OPSEC does not replace other security dis-
ciplines - it supplements them.
Passive Defense—Measures taken to reduce the probability of and to mini-
mize the effects of damage caused by hostile action without the intention of
taking the initiative.
Perimeter Security—Security elements that form the first line of defense for
a site or installation. Elements include standoff, physical barriers, access con-
trol, entry control points, security lighting, hardened fighting positions and
overwatch towers, intrusion detection and surveillance systems, and security
forces.
Physical Security—That part of security concerned with physical measures
designed to safeguard personnel; to prevent unauthorized access to equip-
ment, installations, material, and documents; and to safeguard them against
espionage, sabotage, damage, and theft.
Predetonation Screen—A structure designed to protect a critical asset by
causing a weapon to detonate prior to hitting the primary target, causing its
effect to dissipate in the distance between the screen and the target.
Revetment—A raised structure that provides a level of protection against
splinters, shrapnel, and/or projectiles from bombs, rockets, grenades, small
arms fire, or other weapons effects.
Risk Management—The process of identifying, assessing, and controlling
risks arising from operational factors and making decisions that balance risk
cost with mission benefits.
Standoff Distance—A distance maintained between a building or portion
thereof and the potential location for an explosive detonation.
Temporary Structures—Structures erected with an expected occupancy of
three years or less. Typically includes wood-frame and rigid-wall construc-
tion and such things as Southeast Asia (SEA) Huts, hardback tents, ISO and
CONEX containers, pre-engineered buildings, trailers, stress tensioned shel-
ters, Expandable Shelter Containers (ESC), and Aircraft Hangars (ACH).

Terrorism—The calculated use of unlawful violence or threat of unlawful
violence to inculcate fear. It is intended to coerce or to intimidate govern-
ments or societies in the pursuit of goals that are generally political, religious,
or ideological.
Terrorist—An individual who uses violence, terror, and intimidation to
achieve a result.
Terrorism Threat Analysis—In antiterrorism, threat analysis is a continual
process of compiling and examining all available information concerning
potential terrorist activists by groups that could target a facility. A threat
analysis will review factors of the presence of a terrorist group, operational
capability, activity, intentions, and operating environment.
Threat Assessment—The process used to conduct a threat analysis and de-
velop an evaluation of a potential terrorist threat and the product of a threat
analysis for a particular unit, installation, or activity.
Terrorist Threat Level—A scale used by DOD intelligence agencies to de-
scribe the severity of terrorist threats. The terrorist threat level is established
by DIA and geographical combatant commanders and only applies to those
threats to DOD interests.
Unified Facilities Criteria—The Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) system is
prescribed by MIL-STD 3007 and provides planning, design, construction,
sustainment, restoration, and modernization criteria and applies to the Mili-
tary Departments, the Defense Agencies, and the DOD Field Activities in
accordance with USD(AT&L) Memorandum dated 29 May 2002. UFC will
be used for all DOD projects and work for other customers where appropri-
ate. UFCs are living documents and will be periodically reviewed, updated,
and made available to users as part of the Services' responsibility for provid-
ing technical criteria for military construction. Headquarters US Army Corps
of Engineers (HQUSACE), Naval Facilities Engineering Command
(NAVFAC), and Air Force Civil Engineer Support Agency (AFCESA) are
responsible for administration of the UFC system.

Vulnerability—In AT, a vulnerability is a situation or circumstance, which,
if left unchanged, may result in the loss of life or damage to mission essential
resources.
Vulnerability Assessment—A DOD, command, or unit-level evaluation
conducted to determine how vulnerable installations, units, exercises, ports,
ships, residences, facilities, or other sites are to terrorist attacks. Identifies
areas of improvement needed to withstand, mitigate, or deter such acts.

                                  Attachment 2
                        PROTECTIVE MATERIALS
A2.1. Overview. When planning and designing fighting positions, shelters
,and other protective structures, it is important to know the characteristics of
certain materials and how they might be affected by certain weapons. The
following paragraphs describe materials that might be available and how
these materials can be used effectively in the expeditionary environment.

A2.2. Characteristics of Materials. Engineers should be aware that different
types of materials offer different degrees of protection. For protective con-
struction efforts, certain materials can be used for shielding or as structural
components to hold shielding materials in place.
A2.2.1. Soil. Soil can be an effective shield against direct fire, indirect fire,
blast, or fragmentation effects. Dense soils offer more protection and resis-
tance to penetration. Coarse-grained soils provide better protection than fine-
grained soils with the same density. Dry sandy soil provides better protection
than silt, clay, and silty-clay soils. Saturated soils offer a less degree of resis-
tance to penetrating projectiles, as illustrated in Figure A2.1. Wet clay is the
most susceptible to ballistic penetration.
Figure A2.1. Soil Resistance to Penetration.
AFH 10-222 Volume 14 1 August 2008                                          140


A2.2.2. Concrete. Steel reinforced concrete provides excellent protection
against direct fire, indirect fire, and fragmentation. However, placement of
concrete structures is important, as they are subject to fail when a large deto-
nation occurs nearby and can themselves become secondary fragmentation.
A2.2.3. Steel. Steel provides excellent protection against fragmentation re-
sulting from direct- and indirect-fired weapons. Obstacles made from steel
can be effectively utilized to resist the effects of many types of weapons.
A2.2.4. Rocks. Rocks can be effective against direct and indirect fire and
fragmentation. Hard rocks can deform, stop, or deflect projectiles. Small
rocks and gravel can be used similar to soil and is less susceptible to mois-
ture. A disadvantage of using rocks is that they can become weakened after
multiple hits or become projectiles if dislodged by blast or upon impact.
A2.2.5. Brick and Masonry. Brick and masonry have similar characteristics
of rocks against penetration and fragmentation effects. However, unrein-
forced brick and masonry do not afford the same protection as concrete be-
cause of less density.
A2.2.6. Snow and Ice. Snow and ice may be the only material available at
some locations and may be effective against small caliber weapons and
nearby blast when used in mass or in combination with frozen soil.

A2.2.7. Lumber and Timber. Wood (e.g., lumber, plywood, timber) has
limited value in stopping projectiles or fragments due to its low density. This
material needs to be very thick to stop small caliber and anti-tank weapons.
A2.2.8. Miscellaneous Materials. If available, miscellaneous materials, such
as landing mats, cargo pallets, steel containers, and culverts provide some
degree of protection from penetrating projectiles and fragmentation effects.
A2.3. Expedient Materials for Protection Against Explosions. Table A2.1,
extracted from FM 5-103, contains thicknesses of materials needed to provide
adequate protection from nearby explosions. In some cases, engineers must
use whatever materials are available at the site to devise and construct struc-
tures needed to contain these shielding materials.

A2.4. Table A2.2, extracted from FM 5-103, contains required thickness for
materials to protect against projectiles. Except where indicated, the thickness
of material shown can protect a target from a single strike from the weapon
specified. If intelligence indicates the enemy may be capable of placing mul-
tiple projectiles upon an individual target or certain area, the thicknesses indi-
cated in the table should be doubled. Refer to the JCOB and JFOB Force Pro-
tection Handbooks for additional information on the use of available materi-
als to construct expedient fortifications in the expeditionary environment.

                                 Attachment 3
                  FIELD CLASSIFICATION OF SOILS
A3.1. Overview. Tests described in this attachment will help in classifying
different types of soil in the field environment. These tests are based on in-
formation contained in AFJMAN 32-1034, Materials Testing, FM 5-410,
Military Soils Engineering, and UFC 3-220-10N, Soil Mechanics. Engineers
should become familiar with these references and ensure they are available
during deployments.

A3.2. Soil Classification. The Unified Soil Classification System (USCS)
divides soils into one of three major categories which include (1) coarse-
grained, (2) fine-grained, and (3) highly organic. These soils are further di-
vided into major categories based on their properties and characteristics.
Table A3.1 contains symbols used to group different types of soils and dis-
tinguish soils with different characteristics. These symbols are combined to
further describe soils (e.g., GW = well-graded gravel).

A3.3. Field Classification and Testing. Although most tests can be per-
formed without laboratory equipment, using No. 40 and No. 200 sieves pro-
vides better accuracy and speeds up testing. Sieves are screens attached
across the end of a cylindrical metal frame. The screen allows particles
smaller than its openings to fall through and retains larger particles. Sieves
with screen openings of different sizes allow you to sort soil into particle
groups based on size (Figure A3.1).

A3.3.1. Visual Examination. A visual examination can be used to establish
the color, grain sizes, and grain shapes of the coarse-grained portion, some
idea of the gradation; and some properties of the undisturbed soil. While vis-
ual examinations may require a large sample of soil, these tests can usually be
conducted with a pint (approximately one canteen cup full) of soil. Soil sam-
ples should be taken from the levels of soil that will be exposed during con-
struction and are related to the structural strength of the construction. For
example, if soil needs to be tested for a fighting position, the sample should
be taken from the exposed wall material that will be a part of the structure
rather than the topsoil layer.

A3.3.1.1. Colors. Color helps to distinguish between soil types. It can also
indicate the presence of certain chemicals or impurities. Colors in general
become darker as moisture content increases and lighter as soil dries. Some
fine-grained soils with dark, drab shades of brown or gray (including almost
black) contain organic colloidal matter. Clean, bright shades of gray, olive
green, brown, red, yellow, and white are associated with inorganic soils.
Gray-blue or gray-and-yellow mottled colors frequently result from poor
drainage. Red, yellow, and yellowish-brown soils result from the presence of
iron oxides. White to pink soils may indicate considerable silica, calcium
carbonate, or aluminum compounds.
AFH 10-222 Volume 14 1 August 2008                                          146


Figure A3.1. Standard Sieve Set.




A3.3.1.2. Grain Sizes. The sample size of gravels range down to the size of
peas, about ¼-inch (e.g., materials retained on a No. 4 sieve). Sands start just
below this size and decrease until individual grains are just distinguishable by
the naked eye. The eye can normally see individual grains about 0.07 milli-
meters in size (about the size of the No. 200 sieve). Silt and clay particles,
which are smaller than sands, are indistinguishable as individual particles.

A3.3.1.3. Grain Shapes. Shapes of visible particles can be determined while
the sample is examined for grain sizes. Sharp edges and flat surfaces indicate
angular shapes, while smooth, curved surfaces indicate rounded shapes.
Some particles may not be completely angular or rounded. These shapes are
referred to as either subangular or subrounded, depending on which shape
predominates.
AFH 10-222 Volume 14 1 August 2008                                                      147


A3.3.1.4. Distribution of Grain Sizes. While laboratory analysis is needed to
determine accurate distribution of grain sizes, a field approximation can be
made by separating larger grains from the remainder of the soil. Table A3.2
contains field methods for determining distribution of grain sizes.

Table A3.2. Distribution of Grain Sizes.

 1   Separate larger grains (gravel and some       If the fines exceed 50 percent, the
     sand particles down to about 1/8-inch and     soil is considered fine-grained (silt--
     larger) from the remainder of the soil.       M, clay--C, or organic--O). If the
     Examine the remainder of the soil and         coarse material exceeds 50 percent,
     estimate the proportion of visible individ-   the soil is coarse-grained (gravel--G
     ual particles (larger than No. 200 sieve)     or sand--S)
     and the fines (smaller than No. 200 sieve).
     Convert these estimates into percentages
     by weight of the total sample.
 2   Examine coarse-grained soil for gradation     If there is a good distribution of all
     of particle sizes from the largest to the     sizes, this means the soil is well-
     smallest                                      graded (W). If there is an overabun-
                                                   dance or lack of any size, this means
                                                   the material is poorly graded (P)
 3   Estimate the percentage of the fine-          If less than 5 percent (non-plastic
     grained portion of the coarse-grained soil    fines) of the total, the soil may be
                                                   classified either as a GW, GP, SW, or
                                                   SP type, depending on the other in-
                                                   formation noted above. If the fine-
                                                   grained portion exceeds 12 percent,
                                                   the soil will be either M or C and
                                                   requires further testing to identify. If
                                                   the fine-grained portion is between 5
                                                   and 12 percent (non-plastic fines or

                                                   soils (M, C, or O) require other tests
                                                   to distinguish them further
AFH 10-222 Volume 14 1 August 2008                                           148


A3.3.1.5. Undisturbed Soil Properties. Using characteristics determined up
to this point, evaluate the soil as it appeared in place. Gravels or sands can be
described qualitatively as loose, medium, or dense. Clays may be hard, stiff,
or soft. The ease or difficulty with which the sample was removed from the
ground is a good indicator. Soils that have been cultivated or farmed can be
further evaluated as loose or compressible. Highly organic soils can be
spongy or elastic. In addition, the moisture content of the soil influences the
in-place characteristics. This condition should be recognized and reported
with the undisturbed soil properties.

A3.3.2. Sedimentation Test. The visual observation test is used to approxi-
mate the proportions of sand and gravel in a soil by spreading the dry sample
out on a flat surface and separating the gravel particles by hand. When No. 40
and No. 200 sieves are not available, separating the fines from the sand parti-
cles is achieved by the sedimentation test. Place a small amount of the fine
fraction of soil, such as a heaping tablespoon, in a transparent container, such
as a jar. Break up any lumps of soil (especially the clays) by grinding the soil
in a canteen cup and add it back to the container. Cover the sample with
about 5 inches of water and agitate by stirring or shaking. The soil particles
will settle out in the time periods indicated in Table A3.3.

A3.3.3. Results of Sedimentation Test. The test will differentiate the coarse
fraction from the fine fraction of a soil. The coarse materials are larger than
0.4 mm and would be retained on a No. 40 sieve. Fine sands fall between 0.4
mm and 0.7 mm. The fine materials will be less than 0.072 mm and would be
material passing a No. 200 sieve. To obtain the fines, wait 30 seconds after
shaking and then gently pour the liquid with suspended fines into another
container. Add additional water to the original container and shake again.
Repeat the above process with the just used sample, again waiting 30 seconds
and pouring the clearer liquid into the second container. Repeat until the liq-
uid appears clear. Pour the water with the fines into a flat pan; dry the soil in
the container (i.e., the sand) and the soil in the pan (i.e., the fines) by letting
the water be wicked or evaporated off. Determine the relative amounts of
fines and sand.

A3.3.4. Modified Sedimentation Test. For the numerous tests that require
use of all fines (i.e., the fines and fine sand materials passing a No. 40 sieve),
the above procedure can be modified to provide this test material. Take a
sample of the original material and separate out the gravel particles by hand.
Place a small amount of the fine fraction of soil in a transparent container and
break up any lumps of soil (especially if clay) by grinding the soil in a can-
teen cup with an improvised wood pestle and add back to the container.
Cover the sample with about 5 inches of water and agitate by stirring or shak-
ing. Between 1 and 2 seconds after stopping the agitation, pour off the water
with the suspended materials into a flat pan and dry the soil. The soil in the
pan will contain particles in the fine and fine sand range.

A3.3.5. Breaking or Dry Strength Test and Powder Test. Perform these
tests only on material passing the No. 40 sieve. Prepare a pat of soil about 2
inches in diameter and ½-inch thick by molding it in a wet, plastic state.
Allow the pat to dry completely. Once dried, grasp the pat between the
thumbs and forefingers of both hands and attempt to break it. Figure A3.2
illustrates the proper way to hold the pat. If the pat breaks, perform the
“Powder Test” by taking a portion of the broken pat and rubbing it with the
thumb in an attempt to flake particles off. Table A3.4 can be used to draw
conclusions from these tests.

  cracks. Make sure when performing this test not to break the sample
  along shrinkage cracks

A3.3.6. Odor Test. The odor test is performed by taking a small representa-
tive sample and heating it with an open flame, such as a match or a candle.
Check for odor. Organic soils (OL and OH) usually have a distinctive, musty,
slightly offensive odor.

A3.3.7. Cast Test. The cast test is performed by mixing a representative por-
tion of the sample with water until it can be molded or shaped without stick-
ing to the fingers. Compress the soil into a ball or cigar-shaped cast. Observe
the ability of the sample to withstand handling without crumbling. Use Table
A3.5 to draw conclusions based on the cast test.

passing the No. 40 sieve. A portion of the sample is mixed with water until it
can be molded or shaped without sticking to the fingers. Shape the sample
into a ball or an elongated cylinder and roll the prepared soil cylinder (on a
flat, nonabsorbent surface) rapidly into a thread approximately 1/8-inch in
diameter. The technique is shown in Figure A3.3. If the moist soil rolls into a
thread, it is said to have some plasticity. Plasticity is a property of the fine-
grained portion of a soil that allows it to be deformed beyond the point of
recovery without cracking or appreciable volume change. This property per-
mits clay to be rolled into thin threads at some moisture content without
crumbling. Some minerals, such as quartz powder, cannot be made plastic no
matter how fine the particles nor how much water is added. Thus, the degree
of plasticity is a general index to the clay content of a soil. The number of
times it can be lumped back together and rolled into a thread without crum-
bling is a measure of the degree of plasticity of the soil. Materials that cannot
be rolled in this manner are non-plastic or have a very low plasticity. Table
A3.6 can be used to draw conclusions for the roll or thread test.

A3.3.9. Ribbon Test. This test is also performed only on material passing the
No. 40 sieve. A representative portion of the sample is mixed with water until
it can be molded or shaped without sticking to the fingers. Form a roll of soil
about ½- to ¾-inches in diameter and 3 to 5 inches long. Lay the roll across
the palm of one hand (palm up), and starting at one end, squeeze the roll be-
tween the thumb and forefinger over the edge of the hand to form a flat, un-
broken ribbon about 1/2 to 3/4 inches thick. Allow the ribbon as formed to
hang free and unsupported (Figure A3.4). Continue squeezing and handling
the roll carefully to form the maximum length of ribbon that can be supported
only by the cohesive properties of the soil. Use Table A3.7 to draw conclu-
sions.

A3.3.10. Wet Shaking Test. The wet shaking test is performed only on the
material passing the No. 40 sieve (see Figure A3.5 for illustrations). A repre-
sentative portion of the sample (enough material to form a ball of material
about 3/4-inch in diameter) is mixed with water until it can be molded or
shaped without sticking to the fingers. The sample (soil pat) is then spread
across the palm of the hand with the blade of a knife or small spatula. Shake
the hand with the soil pat horizontally and strike that hand vigorously with
the other hand. Check the soil for a reaction where water comes to the sur-
face, producing a smooth, shiny appearance. This appearance is described as
livery. Squeeze the sample between the thumb and forefinger using the other
hand. Check to see if the surface water quickly disappears, the surface be-
comes dull, and the material becomes firm, resisting deformation. Continue to
apply pressure and check to see if cracks occur and the sample crumbles like
a brittle material. Very fine sands and silts can be readily identified with the
wet shaking test. However, it is rare to find fine sands and silts without some
amount of clay, which causes varying reactions to the wet shaking test. Even
a small amount of clay will tend to greatly retard this reaction when the water
comes to the surface. Table A3.8 can be used to draw conclusions using the
wet shaking test.

A3.3.12. Shine Test. This test is performed only on the material passing
through the No. 40 sieve. To conduct this test, take a small, slightly moist pat
sample and rub a fingernail or a smooth metal surface such as a knife blade
across the sample. Use Table A3.10 to draw conclusions using the shine test.

A3.3.13. Wash, Dust and Smear Test. The wash, dust, and smear test in-
volves a couple of methods with varying results. Only material passing
through the No. 40 sieve is used for this test. For the first method, take a
small, completely dry sample of soil and drop it from a height of 1 to 2 feet
above a clean, solid surface. Acknowledge the results to determine the
amount of dust that is produced. Refer to Table A3.11 to draw conclusions.
The second method involves taking a small amount of soil and adding water
to it until it is moist but does not stick to the fingers. The sample is then
smeared between the thumb and forefinger. Acknowledge the results and
again use Table A3.11 to draw conclusions.

A3.3.14. Feel Test. Perform feel tests only with material passing the No. 40
sieve. This is done by rubbing the sample between the fingers and observing
the texture. Determine if it is floury, smooth, gritty, or sharp. Rub the sample
on the inside of the wrist. Sand will feel gritty and silts (if dry) will dust read-
ily and feel soft and silky. Clay will powder with difficulty, but feel smooth
and gritless like flour. If the sample is clay, squeeze a piece of the undis-
turbed soil between the thumb and forefinger to determine its consistency.
Remold the soil by working it between the hands and observe the results. If
the sample becomes fluid, it is clay that is probably near the liquid limit. If
the sample remains stiff and crumbles when reworked, it is probably clay
below the plastic limit.

A3.4. Plasticity Estimation. To obtain the range of plasticity of soils
(amount of clay material), conduct the following test using a small sample.
First, remove all particles coarser than a grain of salt. Mold the remaining
particles into a small cube (about 3/4-inch), adding enough moisture to obtain
a putty-like consistency, then allow it to air dry. Once dry, place the cube
between the forefinger and thumb and squeeze to crush it. Use Table A3.12
to determine the sample’s plasticity.

Table A3.12. Results and Indications of Plasticity.

                 Result                                Indication
Cube falls apart easily              Soil is nonplastic
Cube is easily crushed               Soil is slightly plastic
Cube is difficult to crush           Soil is medium plastic
Cube is impossible to crush          Soil is highly plastic
