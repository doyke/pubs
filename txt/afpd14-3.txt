This policy directive provides guidance for protecting intelligence information. It defines authority lines,
roles, and responsibilities for oversight and implementation of programs and procedures to ensure proper
controls and protection in preserving the integrity of intelligence collection systems.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed.

Establishes requirement for AF development of automated systems for efficiency of SCI security man-
agement. Designates HQ USAF/XOIIS as Cognizant Security Authority for SCI. Designates HQ USAF/
XOIIS, Intelligence Security Division as SCI Security Policy Team, chartered to establish SCI control
and release programs for AF. Establishes one Base, one SSO policy. Establishes HQ AIA/SO as OPR for
compilation and submission of quarterly intelligence information compromise and security education
training reporting. Discontinues requirement for HAF-IN(Q) 9327, Results of Security Management
Inspection Report.

1. Intelligence information is crucial to an effective Air Force fighting force. It must be controlled and
protected to preserve the integrity of the intelligence collection system. Some intelligence information
designated as Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) requires additional control and protection.
This Directive establishes policy for the control, protection, and dissemination of Air Force intelligence
information.

2. The Air Force will maintain effective control of the dissemination of intelligence information among
US intelligence community components, US forces outside the intelligence community requiring the
information, foreign nationals, foreign governments, and contractors.

3. Intelligence information will be secured, handled, and disseminated only by properly designated users.
   3.1. The Air Force will validate organizations authorized to receive and handle SCI, indoctrinate per-
   sonnel for access to SCI, and train them to protect against unauthorized disclosures. In addition, the
2                                                                                AFPD14-3 1 MAY 1998

    Air Force will maintain SCI facilities and communications capabilities certified to support SCI han-
    dling.
    3.2. The Air Force will develop automated systems to sustain efficiency of intelligence security man-
    agement.
    3.3. The Air Force will develop procedures to report compromises of classified intelligence informa-
    tion or serious failures to comply with the provisions of security regulations which are likely to result
    in compromise.

4. This directive establishes the following responsibilities and authorities:
    4.1. Director of Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance, DCS/Air and Space Operations, is the
    Air Force Senior Official of the Intelligence Community (SOIC), responsible for intelligence informa-
    tion security for the Air Force.
    4.2. HQ USAF/XOII (Associate Director for Intelligence) is the Air Force authority for issues involv-
    ing the release of intelligence information.
       4.2.1. HQ USAF/XOIIS is the Air Force Cognizant Security Authority (CSA) for SCI, the single
       principal designated by the SOIC to serve as responsible official for SCI security program man-
       agement.
       4.2.2. HQ USAF/XOIIS will establish intelligence security control and release programs and
       oversee Major Command (MAJCOM), Field Operating Agency (FOA), and Direct Reporting Unit
       (DRU), intelligence security programs. In addition, they will represent the Air Force in national
       and Department of Defense (DoD) intelligence security forums.
    4.3. Air Force activities will control intelligence information in accordance with governing directives
    and report intelligence information security violations to HQ Air Intelligence Agency Security Office
    (AIA/SO).
       4.3.1. Air Force activities will conduct quarterly security awareness training with emphasis on
       reducing or preventing recurrence of violations. MAJCOM SSOs will report number of personnel
       receiving security education training per quarter to HQ AIA/SO. HQ AIA/SO will use training
       satistics to identify and document correlations between security violation trends and the conduct
       security education training.
    4.4. The host Major Air Command (MAJCOM) for an installation will ensure SCI communications
    and security management are provided as necessary to support any Air Force unit mission on that
    installation. The host command may contract with a tenant organization to provide SCI communica-
    tions and SCI security management oversight at an Air Force installation for the host command. Ten-
    ant organizations will work with the host MAJCOM to ensure there is only one AF SSO per
    installation. The Air Force Office of Special Investigations will retain a separate SSO to support its
    counterintelligence and force protection responsibilities.
    4.5. Commanders/Senior Intelligence Officers (SIO) will ensure facilities where intelligence infor-
    mation is used meet security requirements and that personnel are trained to protect the information.
    Commanders/Senior Intelligence Officers may enter into agreements (Memorandums Of Agreement)
    with other United States security organizations to provide or receive security services. The sharing or
    consolidation of security resources and skills required to meet the needs of the participantâ€™s individual
    governing directives is encouraged.

                 MEASURING AND DISPLAYING POLICY EFFECTIVENESS

A1.1. The Air Force will measure the success of controlling, protecting, and disseminating intelligence
information by evaluating the number of intelligence information compromises occurring quarterly . The
data will be displayed on bar charts that show the number of certain, probable, or possible compromises
and the category of each compromise. Analysis will focus on identifying trends in categories of compro-
mise. The objective is to reduce the number of intelligence information compromises.

A1.2. MAJCOMs, FOAs, and DRUs will report all SCI security violations as defined in DoD
S5102.21-M-1, Sensitive Compartmented Information Administrative Security Manual, and AFMAN
14-304, The Security, Use, and Dissemination of Sensitive Compartmented Information.

A1.3. HQ AIA/SO will provide a two-part quarterly report, RCS: HAF-XO(Q) 9326, that identifies
trends in security violations and the impact of security education and training programs on security vio-
lation trends. Part I: Compiled data from initial and follow-up security violations reports received from
MAJCOMs, FOAs, and DRUs. Part II: Compiled data reflecting number of individuals receiving secu-
rity education training. Submit quarterly Intelligence Information Compromise and Security Education
Report to HQ USAF/XOIIS. This report is designated emergency status code D. Immediately discon-
tinue reporting data requirements during emergency conditions.

categories by name. The specific training conducted will be assigned the category it best serves.
