                                          Chapter 1

                                 GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. General. This AFI provides flight examiners and aircrew members with procedures and
evaluation criteria used during flight evaluations on RC/OC/WC/TC-135 aircraft. For evaluation
purposes, refer to this AFI for evaluation standards. Adherence to these procedures and criteria
will ensure an accurate assessment of the proficiency and capabilities of aircrew members. Each
crew specialty has a separate chapter in this AFI that provides specific information and grading
criteria for that specialty. (ANG: 170 OSS/CC will be notified when situations require an OG/CC
or SQ/CC approval/waiver)
1.2. Recommendation for Change of Publication. Recommendations for improvements to
this volume will be submitted on AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication,
IAW AFI 11-215, Flight Manuals Program, to HQ ACC/A3TV. Approved recommendations
will be collated into interim or formal change notices, and forwarded to HQ USAF/A3O-AT for
HQ USAF/A3 approval.
1.3. Waivers. IAW AFI 11-202V2 and the ACC Sup procedures, waiver requests must be
routed through the Numbered Air Force (NAF) for comment. Waiver approval authority for
RC/OC/WC/TC-135-specific aircrew requirements is HQ ACC/A3T (ANG: NGB/A3), unless
otherwise specified in this volume. All waiver requests must include the following, as
applicable:
   1.3.1. Name, rank, crew position, type aircraft, type of evaluation, expiration date, and
   applicable paragraph.
   1.3.2. Justification for waiver
   1.3.3. Unit plan of action
1.4. Procedures:
   1.4.1. Flight Examiners (FE’s) will use the grading policies contained in AFI 11-202V2 and
   the evaluation criteria in this instruction for conducting all ACC and ACC-oversight units
   RC/OC/WC/TC-135 Flight, Aircrew Training Device (ATD), and Emergency Procedures
   Evaluations (EPE). All evaluations assume smooth air, a stable platform, and normal
   operating conditions. Compound emergency procedures will not be used.
   1.4.2. All evaluations fall under the Qualification (QUAL), Instrument (INSTM), Instructor
   (INSTR), Mission (MSN) or SPOT categories listed in AFI 11-202V2. For dual/multiple
   qualification or difference evaluations that do not update an eligibility zone, list as "SPOT"
   on the front of the AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification (bold face), and explain
   that it was a difference evaluation under "Mission Description." Each squadron may design
   and maintain evaluation profiles for each Mission Design Series (MDS) that include
   information on each crew position. These profiles will be approved by OGV and they will
   incorporate requirements set in the applicable grading criteria and reflect the primary unit
   tasking.
       1.4.2.1. Schedule all evaluation activity on one sortie and an operational aircraft to the
       greatest extent possible. All flight phase requirements should be accomplished in-flight.
6                                                      AFI11-2RC-135V2 2 FEBRUARY 2010


       If a required event is not accomplished in-flight, OG/CC is the waiver authority for the
       event to be completed in the ATD (must be SIMCERT 1 or TVC 1). This may be
       delegated no lower than SQ/CC unless otherwise authorized in position specific chapters
       of this AFI.
       1.4.2.2. During all evaluations, any grading areas observed by the evaluator may be
       evaluated. If additional training is required for areas outside of the scheduled evaluation,
       document the training required under the appropriate area on the AF Form 8.
       1.4.2.3. Each chapter in this AFI contains a table of requirements for various evaluations.
       The NOTES column of each table may include an "X" which refers to a general note
       found in the individual grading criteria, and/or a number which refers to a note shown
       below the table. To complete an evaluation, all areas annotated with an "R" must be
       successfully completed.
       1.4.2.4. Unit flight examiners may give evaluations outside of their organization to
       include administering evaluations between ACC and ANG.
    1.4.3. Momentary deviations from tolerances will not be considered in the grading, provided
    the examinee applies prompt corrective action and such deviations do not jeopardize flying
    safety. Cumulative deviations will be considered when determining the overall grade.
    Deviations incurred while employing the "See and Avoid" concept will be considered
    momentary deviations. The FE will state the examinee’s overall rating, thoroughly critique
    specific deviations, area grades assigned, and assign any required additional training.
    1.4.4. FEs will not evaluate students with whom they have flown 50% of the
    qualification/upgrade training or those they recommend for qualification/upgrade flight
    evaluation without SQ/CC approval.
1.5. General Evaluation Requirements:
    1.5.1. Publications Check. The publications check is a requisite to all qualification
    evaluations, and will be annotated in the Comments block of the AF Form 8 only if
    unsatisfactory. LEP and annual A page checks in individually issued flight manuals must be
    accomplished, documented, and current. Unit OGV will list the required flight publications
    each aircrew member is responsible for in the local supplement to AFI 11-202V2.
    1.5.2. Written Examinations:
       1.5.2.1. The requisites in Table 1.1 are common to all crew positions and will be
       accomplished IAW AFI 11-202V2, as supplemented, and unit directives. These should be
       accomplished prior to the flight phase.

   1.5.3. Emergency Procedures Evaluations (EPE). Every Qualification evaluation which
   updates an expiration date will include an EPE. For pilots, the FE will administer the EPE in
   the ATD (Aircrew Training Device) when available. Document the method of EPE
   accomplishment in Comments block of the AF Form 8. For all other crewmembers, an EPE
   will be accomplished orally and Emergency Procedures grading criteria will be used to
   evaluate this event. Units will determine scenarios for EPEs. The FE will assign an overall
   EPE grade (1 or 3) in the qualification ground phase block of the AF Form 8.
   1.5.4. Qualification Evaluations. These evaluations should be combined with Instrument
   evaluations, as applicable for the crew position.
   1.5.5. Mission Evaluation. IAW AFI 11-202V2 the requirement for a separate mission
   (MSN) evaluation is waived. The various procedures and techniques used throughout the
   different model variants are managed through a ground training program which results in a
   mission certification. Mission certifications will be IAW 11-2RC-135V1 and documented in
   the appropriate training folder.
       1.5.5.1. For aircrew who maintain multiple mission certifications, recurring evaluations
       need only evaluate the primary mission events as long as currency is maintained in all
       other required training events.
   1.5.6. Instructor Evaluations. Initial Instructor flight evaluations should be conducted with a
   student occupying the applicable aircrew position whenever possible. The instructor
   examinee will monitor all phases of flight from an advantageous position and be prepared to
   demonstrate or explain any area or procedure. The FE will particularly note the instructor's
   ability to recognize student difficulties and provide effective, timely corrective action. The
   FE should also evaluate the grade assigned and TAPR (Training Accomplishment Report)
   completed for the student on all initial instructor checks. The student will perform those
   duties prescribed by the instructor for the sortie being accomplished. If an actual student is
   not available, the FE will identify to the examinee (prior to the mission) the level of
8                                                      AFI11-2RC-135V2 2 FEBRUARY 2010


    performance to be expected from the FE acting as the student. If this option is utilized, at
    least one event or briefing must be instructed. Periodic instructor evaluations will be
    administered in conjunction with required qualification and instrument flight evaluations.
    The examinee must occupy the primary duty position for an adequate period of time to
    demonstrate proficiency in the crew position with required qualification and instrument flight
    evaluations. All instructor evaluations will include a pre-flight and post-flight briefing.
    1.5.7. Instrument Evaluations. Instrument evaluations apply to pilots. See Chapter 2 of this
    volume for specific requirements. General instrument procedures should be evaluated in the
    ATD in conjunction with the EPE.
    1.5.8. No-Notice Evaluations. OG/CC will determine no-notice evaluation procedures/goals.
    1.5.9. Difference Evaluations. Difference evaluations will be annotated as SPOT evaluations
    (but do not update expiration dates unless all periodic evaluation requirements are
    accomplished IAW AFI 11-202V2). These evaluations may be used to qualify aircrew
    coming from similar platforms, i.e. JSTARS, AWACS, KC-135, etc or may be a one-time
    requirement for equipment upgrades or if there are significant equipment differences or
    procedures in model variants of the same MDS, i.e. Open Skies Pacer CRAG, TCTO -509,
    etc.
    1.5.10. Qualification in more than one Mission Series RC/OC/WC/TC–135 does not meet
    multiple qualification criteria nor does it require MAJCOM DO authorization.
1.6. Grading Instructions and General Grading Criteria. Standards and performance
parameters are contained in AFI 11-202V2 and this instruction. A three-level grading system is
used for most areas; however a "Q-" grade will not be indicated under critical areas.
    1.6.1. Critical Areas. Critical areas are events that require adequate accomplishment by the
    examinee in order to successfully achieve the sortie objectives and complete the evaluation.
    If an examinee receives a "U" grade in any critical area, the overall grade for the evaluation
    will be "Q-3." Critical areas are identified by "(CRITICAL)" following the applicable area
    title.
    1.6.2. Non-critical Areas. If an examinee receives a "U" grade in a non-critical area then the
    overall grade awarded will be no higher than "Q-2." An examinee receiving a "Q-" grade in a
    non-critical area or areas may still receive a "Q-1" overall grade at evaluator discretion. An
    overall "Q-3" can be awarded if, in the judgment of the flight examiner, there is justification
    based on performance in one or several areas/sub areas.
    1.6.3. The FE must exercise judgment when the wording of areas is subjective and when
    specific situations are not covered.
    1.6.4. Evaluator judgment will be the final determining factor in deciding the overall
    qualification level.
    1.6.5. General Criteria. The following general qualification criteria and the instructor
    grading criteria are common to all crew positions and will be used for all applicable
    evaluations:

                                            Chapter 2

                                   PILOT EVALUATIONS

2.1. General. The grading criteria contained in this chapter are applicable to evaluations for
pilots and were established by experience, policies, and procedures set forth in flight manuals
and other directives. Evaluators must realize that grading criteria contained herein cannot cover
every situation. Written parameters must be tempered with mission objectives and, more
importantly, mission/task accomplishment in the determination of overall aircrew performance.
Specific requirements for each evaluation are as follows:
2.2. Qualification Evaluations:
   2.2.1. Ground Requisites: See Table 1.1
   2.2.2. Flight Phase: All areas required in Table 2.1 under AC (Aircraft Commander
   qualification) or PQ (Pilot qualification) will be evaluated, unless not applicable to the
   specific aircraft as noted. During recurring evaluations for aircraft commanders, a right seat
   approach and landing is required. Any approach work not completed on the scheduled sortie
   may be completed in the ATD (if available) with SQ/CC approval.
   2.2.3. Copilots initially upgrading to aircraft commander will have a qualified IP (desired) or
   FE (secondary) in the copilot’s position during critical phases of flight.
2.3. Mission Certifications. Mission Certifications ensure that individuals are capable of
performing duties essential to the effective employment of the aircraft. Mission Certifications are
accomplished IAW local training requirements and/or SQ/CC directions. Mission certification
flight events are normally performed during Qualification evaluations, but may be performed on
any flight with an instructor certified in that mission.
   2.3.1. Multiple Mission Certifications. When authorized by the OG/CC IAW 11-2RC-
   135V1, to establish or maintain mission certifications in more than one -135 model, use the
   following guidance. To add an additional -135 model (RC/OC/WC), a separate mission
   certification for that model will be accomplished. Some model transitions may require a
   difference evaluation, see paragraph 2.5 below for further guidance. To initially mission
   certify in more than one -135 model, or for recurring evaluations of pilots mission certified in
   more than one -135 model, complete flight evaluation IAW AFI 11-202V2. Ensure
   Qualification Examination(s) and Emergency Procedures Examination(s) cover all applicable
   models and mission requirements. For aircraft commanders mission certifying in a model
   with reversers, reverse thrust landing must be evaluated in a reverse thrust equipped aircraft
   for initial Qualification evaluations (may be accomplished in the ATD with OG/CC waiver).
   2.3.2. Qualification in TCTO-509/non TCTO-509 aircraft will be initiated by initial
   qualification in one engine type, followed by a difference qualification in the other.
   Subsequent annual qualification evaluation in one engine type will satisfy requirements for
   both types of aircraft, provided ground testing encompasses both aircraft types and the
   individual is current in both engine types.
2.4. Instrument Evaluations:
   2.4.1. Ground Requisites. Instrument Examination.
14                                                       AFI11-2RC-135V2 2 FEBRUARY 2010


     2.4.2. Flight Phase. All areas required in Table 2.1 under "INSTM" will be evaluated.
2.5. Difference Evaluations:
     2.5.1. Ground Requisites: Closed Book exam with Boldface.
        2.5.1.1. Pilots transitioning from the KC-135 or 707 series aircraft models to an
        RC/OC/WC/TC-135, require an Open Book, Closed Book, Boldface, and EPE. The EPE
        should emphasize the difference between models.
     2.5.2. Flight Phase: Required transitions will be IAW AFI 11-2RC-135V1. The following
     transitions also require a flight evaluation. Evaluate applicable items in Table 2.2
        2.5.2.1. Transition from non-reverser equipped aircraft to an aircraft model with thrust
        reversers. Flight Phase for Thrust Reverser Engines transition consists of Landing
        (reverse thrust) and Simulated Engine Out Pattern/Landing (reverse thrust) (AC/IP only).
        2.5.2.2. Pilots not qualified in receiver air refueling who seek qualification for receiver
        air refueling. Flight Phase for air refueling transition consists of AR/Receiver.
     2.5.3. Pilots who require a difference evaluation in another model (same engine type,
     reverser configuration, and air refueling capability) require a Closed Book and Boldface
     exam only (flight evaluation not required). Complete training required by 11-2RC-135V1
     prior to administering examination.
2.6. Instructor Evaluations. Pilots receiving initial instructor evaluations must occupy the
right seat for evaluation of takeoff, air refueling, initial buffet (ATD only), and all traffic pattern
activity. An IP or FE must occupy the left seat. On recurring checks, instructors may occupy
either seat to accomplish required items in Table 2.1. A student, pilot, copilot, IP, or FE may
occupy the opposite pilot position. All "INSTR" areas must be evaluated. In all cases, the
examinee will occupy the position normally required to instruct, and will perform all tasks as
demonstration items. Instructor examinees will accomplish the following demonstrations:
     2.6.1. Air refueling envelope demonstration.
     2.6.2. Approach to initial buffet (Initial C-135 Instructor Check; accomplish only in the
     ATD).
     2.6.3. 30 Flap landing.
     2.6.4. Simulated three-engine rudder power off low approach (first instructor evaluation in
     TF33 equipped C-135 aircraft only).
     2.6.5. Touch and Go landing.
     2.6.6. Grade demos using the criteria for Area 37, Demonstration and Performance. To
     receive a Q grade for the 30 Flap landing/Touch and Go landing, the examinee must satisfy
     the criteria for Area 25, Landing, and Area 26, Touch and Go landings. Unsatisfactory
     performance may result in U grades for both areas depending on the nature of the
     discrepancy.
     2.6.7. Instructor Requalification Evaluations. Will be IAW AFI 11-2RC-135V1 and follow
     guidance for Recurring Instructor Evaluations in paragraph 2.6
2.7. Emergency Procedures Evaluations, additional guidance:
AFI11-2RC-135V2 2 FEBRUARY 2010                                                               15


    2.7.1. Qualification EPEs will evaluate the pilot’s performance of all Boldface Procedures, a
    cross section of noncritical emergency procedures, and knowledge and performance of
    general systems operation. If accomplished in the ATD, a cross section of instrument
    procedures, holding, and unusual attitude recoveries should be included. Use the Emergency
    Procedures - Bold Face criteria for Bold Face emergencies, and the Emergency Procedures
    criteria for all other emergency situations given. Use Systems Knowledge/Operation criteria
    to evaluate general systems operation. Use Instrument areas plus Takeoff, Departure,
    Cruise/Navigation, and Descent areas to evaluate general instrument procedures.
2.8. Pilot Evaluation Requirements:
    2.8.1. Table 2. 1. lists areas for pilot or copilot qualification, instrument, and instructor
    evaluations. (AC=Aircraft Commander Qual, PQ=Pilot Qual).
    2.8.2. Table 2. 2. lists areas for pilot or copilot difference flight evaluations and mission
    evaluations.

                                 NAVIGATOR EVALUATIONS

3.1. General. Grading criteria contained herein cannot cover every situation. Written
parameters must be tempered with sortie objectives, evaluator judgment, and task
accomplishment in the determination of overall aircrew performance. Specific requirements for
each evaluation are as follows:
3.2. Qualification Evaluations: Qualification evaluation ensures that individuals are capable of
using the equipment and skills necessary to navigate the aircraft.
     3.2.1. Ground Requisites: See Table 1.1
     3.2.2. Flight phase: All areas in Table 3.1 under "QUAL" (Qualification) will be evaluated.
     Any air refueling or area work not completed on the scheduled sortie may be completed in
     the ATD with SQ/CC approval.
3.3. Multiple Certifications. When authorized by the OG/CC IAW 11-2RC-135V1, to
establish or maintain certifications in more than one -135 model, use the following guidance. To
add an additional -135 model (RC/OC/WC), a separate certification for that model will be
accomplished. Some model transitions may require a difference evaluation covered below. To
initially certify in more than one -135 model, or for recurring evaluations of navigators certified
in more than one -135 model, complete flight evaluation IAW AFI 11-202V2. Ensure
Qualification Examination(s) and Emergency Procedures Examination(s) cover all applicable
models and mission requirements.
     3.3.1. For examinees flying in multiple models (e.g., 338th CTS instructors) the collection
     maneuver will be the one flown by his/her primary aircraft.
3.4. Difference Evaluations. Difference Evaluations allow an individual to qualify in the same
crew position in a similar MDS or in a new or different system within the same MDS. Difference
evaluations do not update expiration dates.
     3.4.1. Complete difference training and certification/qualification IAW AFI 11-2RC-135
     Volume 1.
     3.4.2. Requisites: Closed book examination.
     3.4.3. Flight phase: A flight evaluation may be conducted as determined by the squadron
     commander.
3.5. Instructor Evaluations:
     3.5.1. Initial Instructor. The initial instructor evaluation should be a separate evaluation. If
     combined with a recurring qualification evaluation, the examinee must be in the seat for the
     primary events (e.g. air refueling, recon orbit procedures, etc). Landing gear emergency
     extension will be demonstrated by the examinee while verbally explaining the procedure.
     The examinee must demonstrate proficiency by instructing a student navigator (ideal) or a
     qualified navigator, in all areas required for a qualification evaluation. The evaluator may
     require the examinee to demonstrate and/or present verbal instruction of air refueling,
     emergency equipment, aircraft systems, navigation procedures, and techniques. These
AFI11-2RC-135V2 2 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                   29


    demonstrations will be briefed to the examinee and will be accomplished inflight at an
    appropriate time so as not to interfere with the examinee’s crew duties or pacing.
    3.5.2. Recurring Instructor. For recurring instructor evaluations, all applicable areas required
    in Table 3.1 will be evaluated to include those listed under "INSTR" (instructor). The
    evaluator may require the examinee to demonstrate and/or present verbal instruction of air
    refueling, emergency equipment, aircraft systems, navigation procedures, and techniques.
    These demonstrations will be briefed to the examinee and will be accomplished inflight at an
    appropriate time so as not to interfere with the examinee’s crew duties or pacing.
    3.5.3. Instructor Requalification Evaluations. Comply with any restrictions in AFI 11-2RC-
    135V1 and follow guidance for Recurring Instructor Evaluations.
3.6. Emergency Procedures Evaluations (EPE). Use a verbal EPE to satisfy the requirements
for grading Area 4, "Emergency Procedures."
3.7. Navigator Evaluation Requirements:
    3.7.1. The table below lists areas for navigator qualification and instructor evaluations.

NOTES
AFI11-2RC-135V2 2 FEBRUARY 2010                                                               31


1. Computer-generated products are authorized for all mission planning. When used, the
navigator is responsible for the data’s accuracy.
2. Errors that occur as a result of a previous error will not be considered when applying the
grading criteria.
   3.9.2. AREA 10, General Navigation and Inflight Information.
       3.9.2.1. Q. Maintained course, any deviations were momentary and did not exceed 5
       NM (2 NM or as specified for operations below Flight Level (FL) 180) from ARTCC-
       cleared course. System crosschecks using all available resources were accomplished
       during the flight. Significant errors were resolved prior to the next crosscheck.
       3.9.2.2. Q-. Did not allow the airplane to deviate more than 10 NM (4 NM or as
       specified for operations below FL 180) from the course. System crosschecks using all
       available resources were accomplished during the flight.
       3.9.2.3. U. Exceeded Q- tolerances.
NOTES
1. The navigator is always responsible for position awareness. Navigator’s primary responsibility
for navigation commences at level off and ceases when the pilot or air traffic controller assumes
responsibility for navigation to the terminal facility.
       3.9.3. AREA 11, Pacing.
       3.9.3.1. Q. Held an even workflow achieving maximum use of available time. Stayed
       ahead of flight progress. Ensured accurate and timely position reports, alter headings,
       and/or control times. Expeditiously dealt with deviations from original flight plan.
       3.9.3.2. Q-. Pacing was adequate but occasionally worked behind aircraft. Position
       reports not over 5 minutes late and turning points not over flown by more than two
       minutes.
       3.9.3.3. U. Overall pacing was unsatisfactory. Worked behind aircraft throughout most
       of flight. Position reports were late by more than 5 minutes and turn points were over
       flown by more than two minutes.
   3.9.4. AREA 12, Communication Device Loading Procedures.
       3.9.4.1. Q. Examinee will load Mode 4 Codes and load secure voice in the UHF or VHF
       radio IAW prescribed procedures and within limitations.
       3.9.4.2. Q-. Codes required for the sortie were improperly set/loaded due to minor
       deviations and equipment was not operated completely IAW prescribed procedures but
       equipment limitations were not exceeded and sortie success was not jeopardized.
       3.9.4.3. U. Examinee was unable to set/load required codes, equipment was not operated
       IAW prescribed procedures, equipment limitations would have been exceeded without
       evaluator intervention and sortie success was affected. NOTE: Examinee will not be
       held responsible for equipment malfunctions as long as procedures were correct. If codes
       cannot be loaded due to equipment malfunction or timing, an oral evaluation of these
       procedures will fulfill the requirement in this area.
   3.9.5. AREA 13, Equipment Operation.
32                                                     AFI11-2RC-135V2 2 FEBRUARY 2010


        3.9.5.1. Q. Navigation equipment was operated IAW prescribed procedures with no
        more than minor deviations or omissions that could not cause damage to equipment or
        significantly degrade system performance. Equipment malfunctions were correctly
        analyzed and corrected when possible for satisfactory equipment capability. The
        coordinates in the navigation system were never more than 5 NM in error provided there
        were no equipment malfunctions.
        3.9.5.2. Q-. Navigation equipment was not operated IAW prescribed procedures.
        Equipment malfunctions were incorrectly analyzed or corrective actions were incomplete
        or incorrect. Variations or omissions in prescribed procedures, erroneous data insertion,
        or faulty techniques caused a significant degradation of equipment performance. In any
        case actions could not have damaged equipment or jeopardized mission objectives. The
        coordinates in the navigation system were never more than 10 NM in error provided there
        were no equipment malfunctions.
        3.9.5.3. U. Exceeded Q- criteria. NOTE: The extent of in-flight corrective action
        required of the navigator to alleviate a search radar malfunction will be determined by the
        mission requirements.
     3.9.6. AREA 14, Air Refueling.
        3.9.6.1. Q. Rendezvous and air refueling procedures were IAW prescribed procedures
        and all checklists were accomplished with no more than minor discrepancies. Met
        planned air refueling timing +/- 1.5 minutes using all reasonable effort. If unable to make
        the scheduled air refueling rendezvous time after using speed control and route
        adjustment techniques, coordinated a revised RVCT. No training was lost by the tanker
        or receiver which could be attributed to the navigator’s error. Directed closure to within
        1 NM of tanker.
        3.9.6.2. Q-. Displayed lack of knowledge and familiarity with the checklists and/or
        rendezvous and air refueling procedures, however, knowledge was sufficient to
        accomplish rendezvous and air refueling with minimal loss of training time/activity.
        Ineffective timing control resulted in unnecessarily delaying the rendezvous. Poor
        planning or inattention on the navigator’s part caused the examinee to overlook timing
        control until it was too late to make the rendezvous using speed control and route
        adjustment techniques (greater than 1.5 minutes but less than 2.5 minutes of briefed time
        of the RVCT) but a revised RVCT was then coordinated prior to the IP. Receiver
        navigator directed closure to within 1 NM of tanker. No significant amount of training
        was lost by the tanker or receiver.
        3.9.6.3. U. Displayed lack of knowledge and familiarity with the checklists and/or
        rendezvous and air refueling procedures to the extent that the rendezvous or air refueling
        was jeopardized or precluded or significant training time/activity was lost. Poor planning
        or inattention on the navigator’s part caused the examinee to overlook timing control
        until it was too late to make the rendezvous using speed control and route adjustment
        techniques, and no revision was made to the RVCT. Timing exceeded Q- tolerances.
        Significant training was lost by tanker or receiver. Receiver navigator was unable to
        direct closure to within 1 NM of tanker. Rendezvous radio calls were incorrect, extremely
        non-standard or late to a degree that caused confusion and compromised safety of flight.
AFI11-2RC-135V2 2 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                33


NOTES
1. Navigators must demonstrate proficiency in ATP-56(B) and established flight manual
procedures.
2. Air refueling includes rendezvous (Point Parallel/RV Delta or Enroute/RV Golf), orbit,
interplane communications, breakaway, and post air refueling.
3. Examinee will not be penalized for radio malfunctions or limitations (e.g., unable to contact a
command post) that prevent revising the rendezvous time or accomplishing required radio calls
on time.
   3.9.7. AREA 15, Landing Gear Alternate Extension.
       3.9.7.1. Q. Landing gear alternate extension procedures were performed with no
       deviations or with minor deviations or omissions that did not affect the safe outcome of
       the procedure and crew coordination was satisfactory.
       3.9.7.2. Q-. Landing gear alternate extension procedures were performed with several
       minor deviations or omissions that could have affected the outcome of the procedure.
       Crew coordination was satisfactory with minor errors.
       3.9.7.3. U. Landing gear alternate extension procedures were performed with major
       deviations or omissions that affected the safe outcome of the procedure. Crew
       coordination was unsatisfactory and/or safety was compromised. NOTE: Emergency
       extension of landing gear will be accomplished by navigators on initial qualification and
       initial instructor evaluations only. Need not be re-accomplished when qualifying in other
       series aircraft equipped with identical emergency extension systems.
   3.9.8. AREA 16, Descent/Approach/Landing.
       3.9.8.1. Q. Monitored aircraft position and approach instructions. Configured FMS for
       appropriate approaches and verified correct landing data was loaded (N/A OC/WC-135).
       Furnished the pilot with headings, ETAs, and other information when required.
       Thoroughly understood approach and/or missed approach instructions/procedures.
       Monitored appropriate FLIP terminal approach plate. Made all required calls, and
       ensured terrain clearance.
       3.9.8.2. Q-. Monitored aircraft position but did not monitor or understand approach
       and/or missed approach instructions/procedures. Slow in providing headings, ETAs, and
       other information when required.
       3.9.8.3. U. Failed to monitor aircraft position. Did not ensure terrain clearance during
       approach. Incorrectly loaded FMS landing data and approach was delayed, or wrong
       approach was loaded into FMS.
   3.9.9. AREA 22, Data Track (RC-135S/U).
       3.9.9.1. Q. Present position counters were no more than 5 NM in error throughout data
       run provided there were no significant equipment malfunctions. Roll out at top of track
       (TOT) was made good within 1 minute of planned/announced timing and collection was
       not degraded by the aircraft position. The navigator forwarded the maximum time-on-
       track and current true heading to the TC within 2 minutes after initial rollout and all
       subsequent rollouts during the data run. The aircraft heading was corrected to within 2
34                                                       AFI11-2RC-135V2 2 FEBRUARY 2010


        degrees of desired data run heading not later than 3 minutes after rollout on the data
        track.
        3.9.9.2. Q-. Present position counters were no more than 10 NM in error throughout
        data run provided there were no significant equipment malfunctions. Roll out at TOT was
        made good within 90 seconds of planned/announced timing and collection was degraded
        but still accomplished. The navigator forwarded the maximum time-on-track and current
        true heading to the TC within 3 minutes after initial rollout and all subsequent rollouts
        during the data run. The aircraft heading was corrected to within 3 degrees of desired data
        run heading not later than 5 minutes after rollout on the data track.
        3.9.9.3. U. Exceeded Q- criteria.
NOTES
1. RC-135S navigators must demonstrate data track procedures by planning and flying a data
track leg. Data track is that portion of navigation that starts at rollout on data run until return to
orbit or roll out on heading when departing the data track. Any enroute navigation exercises or
procedures will terminate at roll in point (RIP) at TOT and may resume within 5 minutes of the
end of data track or receipt of the RTB message.
2. During orbit and data track, aircraft position will be monitored at all times. Recording of
aircraft positions on data run paperwork fulfills the requirements of aircraft position/crosscheck.
3. In-flight information will be recorded IAW mission directives/AFI 11-2RC-135 Volume 3.
4. Evaluatees will be able to identify and discuss differences between Cobra Ball and Combat
Sent navigation procedures.
     3.9.10. AREA 23, Reconnaissance Orbit Area Procedures (RC-135V/W).
        3.9.10.1. Q. Orbit area procedures were in accordance with prescribed directives and
        were accomplished with no more than minor discrepancies. Every reasonable effort was
        made to make exit timing within +/- 1.5 minutes of briefed control time with no degrade
        to collection activity. Repositioned aircraft as required to cover tactical mission
        requirements and no collection was lost due to aircraft positioning.
        3.9.10.2. Q-. Displayed a lack of knowledge and familiarity with orbit area procedures.
        However, knowledge was sufficient to ensure orbit area procedures were accomplished
        with minimal loss of training or collection activity. Exit timing was greater than 1.5
        minutes but less than 2.5 minutes of briefed time.
        3.9.10.3. U. Displayed a lack of knowledge and familiarity with orbit area procedures to
        the extent that the orbit area procedures were jeopardized or training time/collection
        activity was lost. Failed to position the aircraft over the exit point within 2.5 minutes of
        the briefed control time. If aircraft was covering friendly assets, collection capability was
        degraded due to aircraft positioning. NOTE: If the reconnaissance orbit area procedures
        must be terminated or abbreviated for weather, equipment malfunction, emergency, or
        mission profile change, the evaluator may give credit for this event provided all "Q"
        requirements are met. Grade orbit area procedures IAW AFI 11-2RC-135V1,
        RC/OC/WC/ TC-135 Aircrew Training.
     3.9.11. AREA 24, OPEN SKIES Operations
AFI11-2RC-135V2 2 FEBRUARY 2010                                                              35


       3.9.11.1. Q. Maintained course, any deviations were momentary and did not affect
       mission accomplishment. System crosschecks using all available resources were
       accomplished every 30 minutes to verify the accuracy of navigation equipment, and
       significant errors were resolved prior to the next crosscheck. A minimum of two Open
       Skies turns and three sensor legs were flown with no adverse effect on sensor operations.
       3.9.11.2. Q-. Deviations from course were minor and would have had a minimal effect
       on mission accomplishment. System crosschecks using all available resources were
       accomplished during the flight but exceeded 30 minutes, or significant errors were not
       addressed in a timely manner. Improper execution of Open Skies turns would have led to
       a minor loss of sensor operations.
       3.9.11.3. U. Exceeded Q- criteria.
   3.9.12. AREA 25, OPEN SKIES Navigation Leg Communications.
       3.9.12.1. Q. Made 90 percent or more of the required sensor call actions. Timely and
       effective communication with the pilots and mission crew did not prevent successful data
       collection.
       3.9.12.2. Q-. Made 80 percent or more of the required sensor call actions. Deviations or
       omissions in communications resulted in significant degradation of data collection.
       3.9.12.3. U. Exceeded Q- criteria.
NOTES
1. The required sensor action calls are: one minute to sensor on; 30 seconds to sensor on;
countdown to sensor on; 30 seconds to sensor off; countdown to sensor off.
2. Sensor calls will not be considered missed if they conflict with other call/actions that are
critical to flight safety and/or data collection.
   3.9.13. AREA 26, CONSTANT PHOENIX Operations.
       3.9.13.1. Q. Adequately monitored position and ensured placement of aircraft to
       optimize collection IAW WC-135 orbit and reintercept procedures. System crosschecks
       using all available resources were accomplished every 30 minutes to verify the accuracy
       of navigation equipment, and significant errors were resolved prior to the next
       crosscheck. Kept aircraft within bounds of operating area at all times.
       3.9.13.2. Q-. Deviations from course were minor and would have had a minimal effect
       on mission accomplishment. Displayed a lack of familiarity with WC-135 orbit and re-
       intercept procedures.    System crosschecks using all available resources were
       accomplished during the flight but exceeded 30 minutes, or significant errors were not
       addressed in a timely manner. Aircraft strayed outside the operating area boundary.
       3.9.13.3. U. Exceeded Q- criteria.

               ELECTRONIC WARFARE OFFICER (EWO) EVALUATIONS

4.1. General. The criteria contained in this chapter are established by experience, policies, and
procedures set forth in flight manuals and other directives. Evaluators must realize that grading
criteria contained herein cannot cover every situation. Written parameters must be tempered with
sortie objectives and more importantly, task accomplishment in the determination of overall
aircrew performance. The criteria contained in this chapter are applicable to all qualification and
instructor flight evaluations for RC-135 Electronic Warfare Officers.
4.2. Qualification Evaluations:
     4.2.1. Ground Requisites: See Table 1.1
     4.2.2. Flight Phase: All areas required in Table 4.1 under "QUAL" will be evaluated.
     4.2.3. Dual Qualification Evaluations. When authorized IAW AFIs 11-202V1 and 11-2RC-
     135 Vol 1, to establish or maintain qualification in two different EWO positions on the same
     MDS, use the following guidance. Dual Qualification requires a separate evaluation for each
     position. Both evaluations may be combined on one sortie provided all required grading areas
     are evaluated for both positions. Requisites are normally combined.
4.3. Difference Qualifications. Difference Qualifications allow an individual to qualify in a
different tactic/system within the same MDS. Complete difference training and certification IAW
AFI 11-2RC-135V1. Training in a different system does not qualify a crewmember in a different
crew position. Difference Qualifications do not update expiration dates.
     4.3.1. Ground Requisites. Qualification Examination (closed book).
     4.3.2. Flight Phase. A flight evaluation may be conducted as determined by the squadron
     commander.
4.4. Instructor Evaluations. All areas required in Table 4.1 under "INSTR" will be evaluated.
General grading criteria is located in Chapter 1. Units will complete initial instructor checks
during flight.
4.5. EPE. Use the Emergency Procedures criteria to evaluate EPEs. The EPE satisfies the in-
flight requirements for Area 4, Emergency Procedures, if no actual emergency procedure is
experienced in-flight.
4.6. EWO Evaluation Requirements:
     4.6.1. Use Table 4.1

Table 4.1. EWO Evaluation Requirements.

4.7. Grading Criteria:
    4.7.1. For grading common areas, see Chapter 1.
4.8. Specific Grading Criteria: NOTE: Only the areas applicable to the position(s) being
evaluated are to be graded. All equipment settings, operating procedures, and tolerances will be
in accordance with current tasking, operating directives and checklists. Loss of collection or
configuration capability due to equipment malfunction or sortie timing, not attributed to
examinee error/deviation, will not constitute significant data loss or be interpreted as
jeopardizing sortie success. Type of sortie being flown/ simulated will dictate requirements for
this area.
    4.8.1. AREA 9, Equipment/Systems Knowledge.
        4.8.1.1. Q. Satisfactory knowledge of applicable reconnaissance equipment and related
        systems.
        4.8.1.2. Q-. Incomplete knowledge of applicable reconnaissance equipment and related
        systems. Aware of and understands system limitations and cautions.
        4.8.1.3. U. Unsatisfactory knowledge of applicable reconnaissance equipment and
        related systems. Unaware of or does not understand system limitations or cautions.
        NOTE: Equipment/system discussions may be accomplished at any time prior to the
        critique. Evaluators must ensure discussions do not interfere with the examinee’s crew
        duties.

                AIRBORNE SYSTEMS ENGINEER (ASE) EVALUATIONS

5.1. General. The criteria contained in this chapter are applicable to flight evaluations for the
Airborne Systems Engineer positions on all OC/RC-135U/S/V/W aircraft. Evaluators must
realize that grading criteria contained herein cannot cover every situation. Written parameters
must be tempered with sortie objectives and task accomplishment in determination of overall
aircrew performance. Requirements for each evaluation are as follows:
5.2. Qualification Evaluations:
     5.2.1. Ground Requisites. See Table 1.1
     5.2.2. Flight Phase. All areas required in Table 5.1 under "QUAL" will be evaluated unless
     not applicable to the specific aircraft as noted. Make all possible attempts to complete
     evaluations in-flight. If unable, with 55 OG/CC waiver, the evaluation may be completed
     using a static aircraft or ATD. All appropriate aircrew members should be present when
     using a static aircraft to evaluate areas normally performed with crew interaction.
5.3. Dual Qualification Evaluations. When authorized IAW AFIs 11-202V1 and 11-2RC-
135V1, to establish or maintain qualification in two different ASE positions on the same MDS,
use the following guidance. Dual qualification requires a separate evaluation for each position.
Evaluations may be combined on one sortie provided all required grading areas are covered for
both positions and a like specialty is available for both positions not to include the evaluator.
Further the evaluatee must be current and qualified in both baselines/positions in order to
combine these evaluations.
5.4. Difference Qualifications. Difference Qualifications allow an individual to qualify in the
same crew position in another MDS/model or in a different tactic/system on the same MDS.
Complete difference training and certification IAW AFI 11-2RC-135V1. These evaluations do
not update expiration dates.
5.5. Instructor Evaluations. Specific criteria are included in paragraph 1.5.6 and Table 5.1
5.6. Emergency Procedures Evaluations (EPE). Use the Emergency Procedures criteria to
evaluate Emergency Procedures Evaluations. The EPE satisfies the in-flight requirements for
Area 4, Emergency Procedures, if no actual emergency procedure is experienced in-flight.
5.7. ASE Evaluation Requirements:
     5.7.1. Use Table 5.1

Terms
Airborne Systems Engineer—The generic term for the OC-135 and RC-135S/U/V/W
reconnaissance system maintenance technicians. ASE requirements apply to all ASE positions
unless otherwise directed.
Aircraft Commander (AC)—Pilot who has been certified to perform "pilot-in-command"
duties.
Airmanship— An aircrew member’s continuous perception of self and aircraft in relation to the
dynamic environment of flight, threats, and tasking, and the ability to forecast, then execute,
tasks based on that perception.
Copilot (C)—Pilot qualified to perform duties in the right seat only.
Critical Phases of Flight—Take-off, air refueling, approach to landing, landing, a CCTS/CFIC
only maneuver, or any flight maneuver specifically requiring immediate access to controls.

Approaches to planned missed approaches and air refueling rendezvous are not considered
critical phases of flight.
Deviation— Performing an action not in sequence with current procedures, directives, or
regulations. Performing action(s) out of sequence due to unusual or extenuating circumstances is
not considered a deviation. In some cases, momentary deviations may be acceptable; however,
cumulative deviations will be considered in determining the overall qualification level.
Electronic Warfare Officer (EWO)—An individual qualified to perform EWO duties.
Error— Departure from standard procedure. Performing incorrect actions or recording
inaccurate information.
Flight Examiner/Evaluator—A crew member designated to administer evaluations.
Instructor—Crew member trained, qualified, and certified by the squadron commander as an
instructor to perform both ground and in-flight training.
Instructor Supervision—When a current instructor, who is qualified in the same crew position,
supervises a maneuver or training event. For critical phases of flight, the instructor pilot must
occupy one of the seats/stations, with immediate access to the controls.
Major (deviation/error/omission)— Detracted from task accomplishment, adversely affected
use of equipment, or violated safety.
Minor (deviation/error/omission)— Did not detract from task accomplishment, adversely
affect use of equipment, or violate safety.
Omission— To leave out a required action or annotation.
Raven—An EWO crew member qualified to operate specialized electronic warfare equipment
onboard the RC-135 aircraft.
Simulated Engine Failure Take—off Continued (EFTOC)—Practice procedure simulating
engine failure after a take-off or touch-and-go. Follow aircraft specific procedures in AFI 11-
2RC-135, Vol 3 and aircraft tech orders.
Supervised training status—Crew member will fly under instructor supervision as designated
by the squadron commander or evaluator.
Training Devices—All trainers, computer assisted instruction, sound-on-slide programs, videos,
and mockups designed to prepare students for flight training or augment prescribed continuation
training.
