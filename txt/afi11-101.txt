This instruction implements AFPD 11-1, Flying Hour Program. It requires major command (MAJCOM)
and field operating agency (FOA) flying hour program managers to submit flying hour program reports to
HQ USAF. It explains how to prepare and when to submit reports. This instruction does not apply to
AFRES or ANG units. MAJCOM/FOAs planning to issue supplements to this instruction must submit
drafts of the supplement to HQ USAF/XOOT for approval prior to printing and distribution. During
MINIMIZE reports are required (alternate delivery methods may be used). These reports are designated
emergency status code C-2. Continue reporting during emergency conditions, precedence normal.
Address comments or questions on these procedures to HQ USAF/XOOT, 1480 AF Pentagon, Washing-
ton DC 20330-1480.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This change contains recommended language from the AFAA report 0062005, Flying Hour Projections
Used in Computing Spares Requirements. Intent of the change is to improve the accuracy of Air Force
Flying Hour information and related internal controls. A bar ( | ) indicates a revision from the previous
edition.


1. Flying Hour Update Report (RCS: HAF-XOO[SA]9408). This report is used by MAJCOM/FOA
flying hour program managers to request realignments to the flying hour program.
   1.1. The information submitted by MAJCOM/FOA program managers is used to update the USAF
   Program, Aerospace Vehicles and Flying Hour documents (referred to as the PA series or PA docu-
   ments) which project the congressionally approved flying hours for all Air Force operations and is the
   basis for developing support requirements and costs.
2                                                                     AFI11-101 1 NOVEMBER 2002


    1.2. MAJCOM/FOA program managers will submit flying hour update reports to HQ USAF/XOOT
    semiannually not later than 15 February and 15 July via both floppy disc and hard copy. See Attach-
    ment 1 for format.
    1.3. Use the most current HQ USAF flying hour program PA document information as the baseline
    for proposed changes.
    1.4. Do not include program change requests in the flying hour update. Use flying levels contained in
    current PA documents for the report.
    1.5. MAJCOM/FOA flying hour program managers will update average sortie duration (ASD) infor-
    mation (which is used to support logistical requirements) when ASDs are projected to change. ASD
    updates are not required for "E" coded aircraft assigned to Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC).
    Adjusting a unit's ASD only affects the sortie computer model thereby changing its spare support level
    requirements. It does not affect the unit's flying hour authorization.
    1.6. MAJCOM/FOA program managers will ensure flying hour updates include changes to the pro-
    gram covered in the budget year (next FY) and out years.
    1.7. Negative reports are required.
    1.8. Flying hour updates will reflect how the program will be flown during the upcoming budget year.
    This forms the baseline for submittal of MAJCOM/FOA financial plans.
    1.9. MAJCOM/FOA program managers will refine out-year programs to ensure that the program-
    ming process provides proper support for spares and other related support resources. Adjustments to
    the budget year program should be relatively small.
    1.10. Flying hour updates are based on mission requirements or sortie generation capability, which-
    ever is lower. Reports must consider logistical, manpower and financial factors in determining pro-
    jected flying hour realignments.
    1.11. Changes in flying hour allocations are done on a zero dollar balance transfer (ZBT) basis.
    When the requested dollar value for hours exceeds those in the PA documents, cost offsets must be
    provided from within the MAJCOM/FOAs flying hour program or operations and maintenance
    (O&M) resources.

2. Quarterly Flying Hour Execution Report (RCS: HAF-XOO[Q]9409). This report is used to man-
age the execution year flying hour program, ensure the program is executed within fiscal constraints, and
to validate REMIS data.
    2.1. Submit Quarterly Flying Hour Execution Reports no later than 35 calendar days following the
    end of each fiscal quarter.
    2.2. Send report to HQ USAF/XOOT and SAF/FMBOM with an information copy to HQ Air Force
    Materiel Command, Infrastructure Planning Division (HQ AFMC/XPX). For format see Attachment
    2.
       2.2.1. Quarterly Execution Reports are not required for "E" coded aircraft flying in program ele-
       ment code (PEC) 65807f.
    2.3. In Part I show a complete breakout of the flying hour program by budget activity code (BAC);
    PEC; mission design series (MDS); PA program; funded program; first, second, and third quarter pro-
AFI11-101 1 NOVEMBER 2002                                                                              3


   grams (or actual hours flown); cumulative adjustments; and a derived fourth quarter program (actual
   hours).
      Validate actual hours flown against REMIS and resolve any discrepancies between the two.
      Revalidate prior quarters with REMIS to account for late data.
      Treat each BAC as a separate allocation. After the last PEC/MDS listing show that BAC total. At
         the end show a grand total of all BAC data.
      Make all adjustments against the programmed fourth quarter hours. Proper program execution is
        accomplished by observing fourth quarter values and ensuring that units only fly that amount.
        Derive fourth quarter numbers by subtracting the first, second, and third quarter values from
        the annual program and then applying the net adjustment to that figure. A negative value in
        the fourth quarter indicates that a MAJCOM is overflying their program without offsets.
      MAJCOM/FOAs with aircraft supported by mixed funding will include a category breakout by
        O&M and reimbursable hours.
   2.4. In Part II summarize all adjustments to the applicable quarters report. See Attachment 2 for for-
   mat.
   2.5. In Part III summarize contingency hours (if applicable) broken out by MDS, PEC, and contin-
   gency supported.
   2.6. All data should be rounded to the nearest whole number.

3. Out-of-Cycle Program Adjustments. MAJCOM/ FOAs submit Out-of-Cycle Program adjustments
when they desire to adjust their flying hour program based on:
   AFPD 11-1 and AFPD 11-2, Flight Rules and Procedures.
   When conditions prevent flying the entire flying hour program.
   A requirement for additional flying hours exists.
   End-of-year flying hour turn-in.
   3.1. Submit to HQ USAF/XOOT and SAF/FMBOM, with an information copy to HQ AFMC/XPX.
   The request must include BAC, PEC, MDS, hourly adjustment, associated O&M costs, and impact
   statement rationale. Associated O&M costs will include AVPOL, system support, general support,
   replenishment spares (depot level reparables), and depot maintenance.
   3.2. Telephonically advise HQ USAF/XOOT not later than 1 September of intent to turn-in flying
   hours. Submit written request not later than 10 September.
   3.3. MAJCOM overfly projections will be validated and submitted at the end of each POM cycle to
   HQ USAF/XOOT, SAF/FMBO, and HQ USAF/ILPY, with an information copy to HQ AFMC/XPX.
   HQ USAF/ILPY will provide initial and updated overfly hour projections to HQ AFMC/LG, who will
   enter the validated projections into the D200A system.

4. Hours/Crew/Month (HCM) Requirement Report (RCS: HAF-XOO [A] 9410). MAJCOMs will
submit an HCM Requirement Report (as applicable) annually to arrive at HQ USAF/XOOT not later than
15 April.
4                                                                  AFI11-101 1 NOVEMBER 2002


    4.1. Organizations possessing the following CC, CA, and IF coded aircraft (B-1, B-2, B-52, A-10,
    F-15, F-15E, F-16, F-111, EF-111, F-117, KC-10, KC-135, C-5, C-17, C-141, and C-130) must submit
    an unconstrained RPI-1 HCM requirement in hours per month. Project HCM requirement for the bud-
    get year and the next 5 fiscal years. Include methodology used in determining HCM.
    4.2. Do not consider any fiscal, logistical, or manpower limitations when computing requirements.
    Data will ultimately be passed to OSD as a comparison of MAJCOM requirement versus MAJCOM
    program.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS

This change contains recommended language from the AFAA report 00062005, Flying Hour Projections
Used in Computing Spares Requirements. Intent of the change is to improve the accuracy of Air Force
Flying Hour information and related internal controls.

3.3. MAJCOM overfly projections will be validated and submitted at the end of each POM cycle to HQ
USAF/XOOT, SAF/FMBO, and HQ USAF/ILPY, with an information copy to HQ AFMC/XPX. HQ
USAF/ILPY will provide initial and updated overfly hour projections to HQ AFMC/LG, who will enter
the validated projections into the D200A system.
