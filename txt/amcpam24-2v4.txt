This volume implements AFPD 24-2, Preparation and Movement of Air Force Materiel, and provides
information needed to load plan a portion of the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF). Aircraft discussed in
this volume is the wide-body Lockheed L-1011. Provisions of this volume applies to Active Duty,
National Guard, Military Reserve Units and other government agencies while utilizing commercial air-
craft during contingencies.
This volume of AMCP 24-2 is intended for use as a load planning guide. Equipment listed is dimension-
ally compatible with all Lockheed L-1011 aircraft and cargo areas discussed. Final approval of the proce-
dures in this publication, however, ultimately rests with the individual contractor providing airlift services
to the DoD. When new or additional information is received from the manufacturer, it will be provided as
a change to this publication.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed.

The information contained herein is identical to the information in the previous pamphlet broken down
into a more manageable file size. No data has changed. Users of this volume should print volume one
which deals with the Administration, Policies, Specialized Loading Support Equipment, and Passenger,
and Baggage Loading.

1. General Description: The Lockheed L-1011 is a wide-body, long-range, tri-jet passenger aircraft. The
L-1011 is normally configured to carry from 246-330 passengers. Variations on passenger seats depend
upon aircraft series, location of galley, spacing requirements of the seats, and contract requirements. A
cargo version of the basic L-1011-1 (S/N 1012) was made available for military use in 1995 along with
eight former British aircraft that were converted to the cargo configuration. Figure 2. and Figure 3. show
the general dimensions and characteristics of the L-1011. Figure 4. and Figure 5. provide critical ground
clearance information for personnel working under or around the aircraft. Notice that these figures repre-
sent information on the two different series aircraft; i.e. the –1/-100/–200, and the –500 respectively.

Figure 1. Lockheed L-1011, Tri Star.




2. Passenger Seating. Passenger configuration and seating capacity vary greatly by aircraft series,
model, and individual carrier. The Joint Service Capabilities Plan (JSCP) uses 145 passengers per airplane
for the L-1011-100 and 205 passengers for the L-1011-500 for wartime planning, based on 400 pounds
per individual over a 3500 NM leg. Figure 6. through Figure 8. provide typical seating arrangements that
may be seen on CRAF L1011 (–1/ -100 / –200 series) aircraft while Figure 9. and Figure 10. show simi-
lar information for the –500 series. Passenger payload capabilities for each model are listed in Attach-
ment 2.

3. Lower Lobe Compartments. There are three lower lobe Compartments on the L-1011. The Forward
lower lobe (FLL), center lower lobe (CLL), and the aft bulk compartment (ABC). The size of these com-
partments and access doors vary with aircraft model and series (see Figure 11. through Figure 17. for
dimensions and capacities). There are no restraint mechanisms available to secure 463L pallets, therefore
the user should plan to bulk load all available compartments.

4. Loading Sequence. The carrier determines loading sequence for establishing proper center of bal-
ance.

5. Cargo Loading. The –200 F series is the only freight carrying L-1011 in the CRAF inventory. The last
four figures (Figure 18., Figure 19. and Figure 20.) address the Cargo Door, the floor schematic and list
of “Maximum Pallet Position Gross Weights” allowed on the floor.

6. Cargo Compartments, General Description. Cargo compartments are provided both above and
below the cabin floor, each compartment having its own power operated door.
    6.1. The cabin cargo compartment which meets the FAR Part 25.857 Class E requirements is
    equipped with a floor level handling and restraint system which will accommodate a variety of pallet
    configurations. This system is not power operated.
    6.2. The Main Cabin Cargo Compartment can accommodate 26 463L 88” X 108” pallets when built
    to fit within the contour of the aircraft fuselage. (See Figure 7.13 for contour limits.)
