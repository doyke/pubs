1. Overview.
     1.1. Patient safety involves a variety of clinical and non-clinical activities that health care
     organizations leaders undertake to identify, evaluate and reduce the potential harm to
     beneficiaries and to improve the quality of health care. Effective medical/health care error
     reduction requires an integrated approach and supportive environment in which patients, their
     families, organizational staff and leaders can identify, manage, and learn from actual and
     potential risks.
     1.2. Establishes procedures to execute a dedicated program for avoiding patient harm and
     improving patient safety within all 59 MDW facilities. Manages a system for reporting good
     catches, and actual patient safety events in order to identify system or process failures and to
     enhance improvement strategies.
     1.3. The 59 MDW promotes a non-punitive, interdisciplinary approach to decrease
     unanticipated adverse health care outcomes. The 59 MDW fosters and supports an
     organizational environment that recognizes and acknowledges potential risks to patient safety
     and the occurrence of medical/health care errors.
2. Goals.
     2.1. For leadership to instill patient safety as a core value in all aspects of healthcare
     delivery.
     2.2. For staff to embrace patient safety as an uncompromising core value with all they do.
59MDWI44-130 16 JULY 2013                                                                       3


   2.3. To maximize the use of technology to enhance patient safety.
   2.4. To develop and maintain a culture which fosters communication without fear of
   retribution.
3. Scope of Focus.
   3.1. The Patient Safety Focus. The PSP focuses on system and process design rather than on
   the individuals involved in a given patient safety related event. In the patient safety
   conscious culture, when an error occurs, the response is not to ask “who,” but rather “why.”
   This instruction provides guidance for the execution of a program dedicated to avoiding
   patient harm and improving patient safety.
   3.2. Interface with Risk Management (RM) staff. Any patient safety event that results in
   harm may be considered a potentially compensable event (PCE). The Patient Safety staff
   will be informed of all PCEs and these will be managed by RM according to the guidance in
   AFI 44-119, Medical Quality Operations. Similarly, the Patient Safety staff will notify RM
   staff of any events that may be PCEs.
   3.3. Referral to the Commander. The vast majority of errors are unintentional. However,
   certain events, as noted below, warrant administrative, disciplinary, or legal action. Should
   any of the following be discovered in the course of a patient safety event evaluation, the 59
   MDW Commander will be informed immediately:
       3.3.1. Criminal activity, e.g.: rape, assault and battery, homicide, etc.
       3.3.2. Intentional unsafe acts due to gross negligence or reckless behavior.
       3.3.3. Alleged patient abuse.
       3.3.4. Impairment due to medical and/or psychological conditions including alcohol or
       other drug abuse.
4. Responsibilities.

     if an event meets the criteria of an sentinel event and if so, ensures the event is reported
     to AFMOA and the AAAHC as applicable.
        4.4.7.1. Adverse incident, adverse drug event and sentinel event:
            4.4.7.1.1. Adverse incident is an event such as actual breaches in medical care,
            administrative procedures or other breaches events resulting in an outcome that is
            not associated with the standards of care or acceptable risks associated with the
            provision of care and service for a patient.
            4.4.7.1.2. An adverse drug event is an injury resulting from a medical

       catches, actual events and adverse incidents) and the reporting process.
5. Administrative Details.
   5.1. Patient Safety Education and Training.
       5.1.1. 59 MDW staff. All assigned personnel will receive Patient Safety education and
       training during their initial orientation and on an annual basis through SWANK. Patient
       Safety topics should include, but are not limited to:
       5.1.2. National Patient Safety Goals.
       5.1.3. The importance and location of all Surgeon General NOTAM.
       5.1.4. Roles and responsibilities in reporting patient safety events.
   5.2. NPSG Champions.
       5.2.1. Manage and track progress for 59 MDW’s implementation and compliance with
       assigned NSPG.
   5.3. SBAR is WHASC’s official standardized hand-off communication technique. This
   mnemonic tool is not intended to be memorized, but is intended to be used as a memory
   jogger when hand-offs are taking place to ensure staff are mentally considering all important
   aspects of hand-off communications. Hand-offs are two-way interactive communications
   allowing the opportunity to ask and respond to questions/comments between the giver and
   receiver of patient information as the patient’s care moves from one caregiver to another.
   Ask “what else do you need to know, any clarification?”
       5.3.1. What SBAR stands for:
          5.3.1.1. S-Situation: Examples: Identify yourself and your role/job. Include patient‘s
          name, identifiers, age, sex, and location. Current status/circumstances, code status,
          identify uncertainties, differential diagnosis, recent status changes, and response to
          treatment.
          5.3.1.2. B-Background: Examples: Co-morbidities, previous episodes, current
          medications, family history, socioeconomic factors. If reporting to a provider, you
          may briefly state patient‘s admission diagnosis, date of admission, pertinent medical
          history, and synopsis of treatment to date.
8                                                                59MDWI44-130 16 JULY 2013


           5.3.1.3. A-Assessment: Examples: Chief complaints, vital signs/symptoms,
           diagnosis, critical lab values/reports, allergies, alerts (falls, isolation, etc). If
           reporting to a provider, you may state patient‘s most recent vital signs, changes from
           prior assessment such as oxygen needs, mental status, neurological changes, pain,
           monitor changes, Gastrointestinal/Genitourinary, and mobility status.
           5.3.1.4. R- Recommendation: Examples: What actions were taken or are required
           (the Plan). State why action is needed, level of urgency, explicit timing, and
           prioritization of actions. State who is responsible for action. Include patient and
           family appropriately. Alternate plan? If reporting to a provider, you may briefly
           state; Do you think we should do? Are any tests needed? How often do you want
           vital signs? When do you want us to call again?
       5.3.2. All healthcare members responsible for accepting or transferring care of a patient
       (either permanently or temporarily) must communicate all SBAR patient information
       when handing off the patient. The depth of detail of all the components of SBAR
       depends on the patient’s conditions and the type of transfer.
       5.3.3. Hand-offs require a process for verification of the received information, including
       repeat-back or read-back, as appropriate.
    5.4. Falls Prevention. All patients have a risk for falling due to environmental and personal
    factors. Staff must assess and periodically reassess patients for the risk of falling, as
    appropriate.
       5.4.1. Areas identified as having patients at high risk for falls include Same Day Surgery
       (SDS), conscious sedation areas, Urgent Care Clinic, Internal Medicine, and Physical
       Therapy. The above areas will determine risks associated with patient population served,
       and assess for risk for falls. The criteria listed below may not warrant a patient be
       identified as a falls risk. Therefore, clinicians (doctors, nurses, technicians) and front
       desk staff in these areas as well as in all outpatient clinic areas must use their judgment to
       identify patients at risk for falls.
       5.4.2. From the areas identified as high risk for falls, the clinicians must assess and
       periodically reassess these patients for the risk of falling as appropriate and take
       appropriate action.
       5.4.3. As a minimum, use the following criteria for screening adult patients at risk for
       falls:
           5.4.3.1. Age (>65 higher risk).
           5.4.3.2. Functional or mobility issues, physical status (unsteady gait, history of limb
           amputation, use of walker, cane, crutches, prosthetics).
           5.4.3.3. Visual/hearing deficits.
           5.4.3.4. Medications (hypnotics, sedatives, analgesics, and psychotropics).
           5.4.3.5. History of falls.
       5.4.4. Assist those persons identified at risk for falls during the screening process and if
       there is a change in their status assist as needed throughout their outpatient visit.
59MDWI44-130 16 JULY 2013                                                                        9


     5.4.5. Ensure hallways and floors remain dry and clear of any obstacles, especially those
     that may slide or roll. Clearly identify any hazardous areas or obstacles over which the
     patient may trip. Examples include trashcans, laundry containers, computer terminal
     stands and cords, patient bags, and any personal belongings.
     5.4.6. Both the patient and family will be educated on the potential for falls and provided
     information on interventions to eliminate and/or decrease falls potential.
     5.4.7. In SDS: Place a yellow falls identification bracelet where it is visible to staff
     members.
     5.4.8. If a fall occurs in an outpatient area (within clinic or waiting area) the clinic staff
     will:
         5.4.8.1. The first staff member on the scene should ensure the safety of the person
         who fell.
         5.4.8.2. Call 911 if the patient needs immediate medical attention.
         5.4.8.3. Escort and/or encourage patient to go to the primary care manager or Urgent
         Care Clinic for evaluation and treatment.
         5.4.8.4. If equipment is involved, remove the equipment from the area, tag the
         equipment with the identified potential problem, and have medical maintenance
         check the equipment in accordance with AFI 41-201, Managing Clinical Engineering
         Programs and manufacture’s literature. The equipment will not be used on any other
         patient until inspected and cleared by Medical Maintenance.
  5.5. Event reporting.
     5.5.1. Upon identification of an actual event, the staff member will immediately attend to
     the patient’s or visitor’s medical and safety needs.
     5.5.2. The staff member or the supervisor of the staff member who identified the event
     will notify the patient's physician(s) as soon as possible to report the event and to report
     on the patient's clinical condition.
     5.5.3. The staff member or the supervisor of the staff member who identified the event is
     responsible for preserving related materials that may require further investigation.
     5.5.4. A PSR will be submitted for all medication and non-medication incidents to
     include good catches and actual events. A PSR icon appears on all desktops to report an
     event. Any staff member can initiate a PSR. The PSR will be completed by the staff
     member who identified the event or by their supervisor whenever possible. A common
     access card is required to report in the PSR, anyone who witnesses a patient safety event
     can report in the PSR system.
     5.5.5. Provide a clear and factual, yet concise description of the event and avoid
     opinions. For good catches, document what the potential event was and how it was
     averted.
     5.5.6. The name of the individual completing the report is not required but is
     encouraged. A name provides a point of contact if more information is required or to
     provide feedback.
10                                                             59MDWI44-130 16 JULY 2013


     5.5.7. Address a factual statement about the event in the patient's medical record and/or
     explain what happened to the patient. For example: Patient found on floor. Patient
     checked for injuries. No complaint of head, back, hip or extremity pain; patient assisted
     back to bed and physician notified.
     5.5.8. The department/specialty clinic that discovers any adverse incidents related to
     disease, disability, or death of a patient due to a device implant needs to immediately
     notify Patient Safety and Risk Management.
     5.5.9. The Patient Safety Office staff will analyze the report, determine additional
     actions as appropriate, track and trend events and act as the central repository for all
     reports generated within the facility and its outlying areas of responsibility.
     5.5.10. Adverse Drug Reactions. Procedures are in place for reporting these incidents to
     pharmacy services and the Pharmacy and Therapeutic Committee see 59 MDWI 44-115,
     Pharmacy and Medication Management.
     5.5.11. Blood Product Reaction. Complete section IV of 59 MDW Form 3232, Blood
     Component Crossmatch/Transfusion Record in accordance with 59 MDWI 44-107, Blood
     Products and Cellular Components.
     5.5.12. Do not use the PSR for the following events:
         5.5.12.1. Staff injuries. Refer to 59 MDWI 91-203, Medical Wing Safety Program,
         for further information.
         5.5.12.2. Sharps injuries and biological agent splashes should be reported via a Blood
         Borne Pathogen report IAW 59 MDWI 48-105, Medical Employee Health and
         Exposure Control Program.
  5.6. Events requiring expedited reporting. In addition to potential adverse incident reporting
  in paragraph 4.2.8. above, events related to the Translogic tube system and pager
  malfunctions should be reported to the Patient Safety Office at 292-6161/0220/6283, as soon
  as possible but no later than 24 hours after an event related to these subjects. For delays
  related to critical test values, or diagnostic imaging report notifications refer to 59 MDWI 44-
  155, Critical Test and Critical Value Management.
  5.7. Good catch reporting.
     5.7.1. Definition: Any process variation or error or other circumstance that could have
     resulted in harm to a patient but through chance or timely intervention did not reach the
     patient or did not harm the patient.
     5.7.2. Good catches occur more frequently than actual events. They provide an
     opportunity to improve the systems without having to experience an actual event.
     Examples of good catches include:
         5.7.2.1. A procedure is almost done on the wrong patient but was “caught” before the
         procedure actually started.
         5.7.2.2. A patient who is allergic to penicillin is ordered a prescription for the
         medication. The pharmacy staff identifies the allergy before it is dispensed and the
         patient does not receive the medication.
59MDWI44-130 16 JULY 2013                                                                     11


        5.7.2.3. Good catch falls. Patient was falling but did not hit ground or other object
        because staff member (s) intervened.
     5.7.3. Good catches will be reported in the PSR in the same manner as an actual event.

Aggregate—To combine standardized data and information.
Aggregate Review—The process of analyzing recurring events, injuries, or good catches for
trends and patterns. This information is utilized by the organization for process improvement
interventions.
Contributing Factors—Additional reasons, not necessarily the most basic reasons, for an event
to be less than ideal, as planned, or as expected. Contributing factors may apply to individuals,
systems operations, or the entire organization.
Data—Material, facts or clinical observations that have not been interpreted.
Evaluation—Analysis of collected, compiled and organized data pertaining to important aspects
of care. Data are compared with predetermined, clinically valid criteria; variations from criteria
are determined to be acceptable or unacceptable; and problems or opportunities to improve care
are identified.
Harm—Personal injury of a physical, emotional or psychological nature as a result of an event.
Intentional Unsafe Act—Any alleged or suspected act or omission of a provider, staff member,
contractor, trainee, or volunteer pertaining to a patient involving a criminal act; a purposefully
unsafe act; patient abuse; or an event caused or affected by drug or alcohol abuse. Intentional
unsafe acts are matters for law enforcement, disciplinary system, or administrative investigation
and fall out of the purview of the patient safety program. If an intentional unsafe act is revealed,
this report shall be referred to applicable command authorities via the established chain of
command.
Good Catch—Any process variation, error or other circumstance that could have resulted in
harm to a patient but through chance or timely intervention did not reach the patient. These
events are also known as “close call” or “good catch”.
Medication Error—A preventable event that may cause or lead to inappropriate medication use
or patient harm while the medication is in the control of the health care professional, patient or
consumer. Such events may be related to professional practice, health care products, procedures
and systems, including prescribing; order communication; product labeling, packaging, and
nomenclature; compounding; dispensing; distribution; administration; education; monitoring and
use.
Patient—Individual at the facility for treatment, either as an outpatient, or for radiology,
pharmacy or laboratory activities. Includes period of time from arrival to departure, including
time in parking area and waiting time anywhere in the facility, such as in the dining facility.
Risk Assessment—A method used to proactively evaluate the probability of a patient safety
event in order to minimize the risk of the event actually occurring.
Root Cause—The most basic reason that a situation did not turn out ideally, as planned or as
expected.
Root Cause Analysis—A process for identifying the basic or contributing causal factor(s)
associated with an adverse incident or good catch. The review is interdisciplinary and includes
those who are closest to the process. It focuses on systems and processes, not individual
performance. The analysis asks “what” and “why” until all aspects of the process are reviewed
and all contributing factors have been determined. It identifies changes that could be made in

                                PATIENT IDENTIFICATION

A4.1. Overview.
   A4.1.1. Use at least two approved patient identifiers when providing care, treatment, or
   services. The intent for this goal is two-fold: first, to reliably identify the individual as the
   person for whom the service or treatment is intended; second, to match the service or
   treatment to that individual.
A4.2. Responsibilities.
   A4.2.1. Senior Leadership will:
       A4.2.1.1. Promote a culture that emphasizes the use of the described patient
       identification process in caring for all patients.
       A4.2.1.2. Ensure all personnel are educated on the policies and procedures delineated in
       this instruction.
   A4.2.2. Department chairmen and squadron/flight commanders will ensure the use of the
   patient identification process identified in this instruction.
   A4.2.3. All staff including providers, nursing, and ancillary/allied staff will utilize each
   patient’s full name and date of birth as the two standard identifiers associated with NPSGs.
A4.3. Patient Identification Process.
   A4.3.1. General.
       A4.3.1.1. All staff are responsible for verifying the patient’s identity by using the
       appropriate two patient identifiers which are the patient’s full name (including suffix, Jr,
       Sr, III, etc) and date of birth prior to conducting tests, initiating treatments and
       procedures, administering or dispensing medications, or obtaining laboratory specimens.
       A4.3.1.2. WHASC staff will actively involve the patient and as needed the patient’s
       family in the identification and matching process, asking for example, “Please tell me
       your full name and date of birth”. When active patient involvement is not possible or the
       patient’s reliability is in question (i.e. children), the individual collecting the specimen,
       administering the medication, or treatment is responsible for identity verification.
       A4.3.1.3. When verifying the patient’s identity, staff should never state the name and
       date of birth and ask the patient to confirm it. Confused patients or individuals in a
       behavioral health care setting might agree even when it is not their name. WHASC
       personnel will always ask the patient to state his or her full name and date of birth.
   A4.3.2. Specific.
       A4.3.2.1. Outpatients. Use the patient’s full name (including suffix, Jr, Sr, III, etc) and
       date of birth. Compare the identification information to the patient’s hardcopy medical
       document or electronic record in either Composite Health Care System or Armed Forces
       Health Longitudinal Technology Application and the patient’s identification statement

      requirement.
A4.4. Communication Issues.

      staff may use additional identifying data such as the patient’s social security number.
      A4.4.2.2. If patient identification cannot be verified using the two patient identifiers, the
      patient’s care, unless emergent in nature, must not proceed until such a time that the
      patient’s identification can be properly verified. In the event identification still cannot be
      verified, the receptionist at the front desk will contact Member Services to assist with
      patient identification.
