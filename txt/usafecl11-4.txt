This publication implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 11-2, Aircraft Rules and
Procedures. This inspection checklist is developed to support AFI 90-201, Inspector General
Activities, and the USAFE Supplement 1, inspection programs. This checklist identifies
compliance items that support guidance in the following: law, executive order, higher
headquarters publication (Department of Defense (DoD), Air Force Instructions (AFI), Air Force
Manuals (AFMAN), etc.) and United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) publications. It
applies to all USAFE KC-135 operations and supports guidance in the following: AFI 11-202
Volume 1, Aircrew Training, AFI 11-2KC-135 Volume 1, KC-135 Aircrew Training. Units
supplement this publication to add internal compliance items, ensure that any local publications,
instructions or supplements are created in accordance with AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms
Management. This checklist is intended for inspection use. Send comments and suggested
improvements to this publication on AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication,
to Headquarter USAFE, Directorate of Air and Space Operations, Operations and Training
Branch (HQ USAFE/A3TO), Unit 3050, Box 15 APO AE 09094. Ensure that all records created
as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with Air

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This Interim Change implements corrections on several references as a result of updates and
revision of currently referenced policy. A “*” indicates newly revised material.

1. General. The items listed do not constitute the order or limit the scope of the inspection and
assessment. As a minimum, units should use USAFE inspection checklists in conjunction with
the annual Unit Self Assessment. The objective is to identify deficiencies that preclude
attainment of required capabilities. Units can supplement this publication to add internal
compliance items. Users may add any item that, in the exercise of good judgment, requires
examination. This directory may be used in whole or in part by higher headquarters (HHQ)
during visits or exercises.

    1.1. Core Compliance Guide Items (CCGI) and Compliance Guide Items (CGI). Items
    identified by functional managers to prioritize command requirements and to allow the
    Inspector General (HQ USAFE/IG) inspectors to assess criticality of deficiencies.

    1.1.1. CCGI. Items identified by HQ USAFE directorates and functional managers as key
    result areas for successful mission accomplishment including, but not limited to, items where
    non-compliance could result in serious injury, loss of life, excessive cost, litigation or affect
    system reliability. These requirements may be mandated by law, Executive Order, DoD
    directive, safety or Air Force and USAFE strategic plans. CCGIs are referred to as
    significant guide items requiring direct IG evaluation. Identify CCGIs by using uppercase
    and bold letters.

    1.1.2. CGI. CGI are areas that require special vigilance and are important to the overall
    performance of the unit. Noncompliance could result in some negative impact on mission
    performance but is not likely to result in injury, unnecessary cost, or litigation. Identify CGIs
    by using standard sentence case.

2. Applicability. All items on this inspection checklist are assigned an applicability code
designating to which type of unit the item applies. Applicability code 3 designates the following
main operating bases: Aviano, Incirlik, Lakenheath, Mildenhall, Ramstein, and Spangdahlem.
Applicability code 4 designates Air Support Operations Group (ASOG), including associated Air
Support Operations Squadron (ASOS).
