                                            Chapter 1

                               GENERAL RESPONSIBILITIES

1.1. Overview. The 42 OSF/CC is responsible for overseeing the Crashed, Damaged or
Disabled Aircraft Recovery (CDDAR) program at Maxwell AFB. The CDDAR program applies
to all USAF host and tenant organizations and is designed to recover crashed, damaged, or
disabled aircraft in a minimum time period consistent with the following considerations:
     1.1.1. Requirement to open the runway for operational use.
     1.1.2. Prevention of secondary damage to the aircraft.
     1.1.3. Preservation of evidence for mishap or accident investigations IAW AFI 91-202, The
     US Air Force Mishap Prevention Program and AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and
     Reports.
     1.1.4. 42 ABW Plan 10-2, Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan (CEMP), provides
     procedures for tasked organizations in the event of an actual aircraft mishap.
1.2. CDDAR Recommended Composition.
     1.2.1. The primary CDDAR team members are from the Base Operating Support Services
     (BOS) Transient Alert office, and the 908 MXS set as augmentees. Management of the
     primary CDDAR equipment will be the Transient Alert section. Mission Design Series
     (MDS)-specific (C-130) aircraft equipment used for CDDAR will be managed by the 908
     MXS. The CDDAR team should include personnel assigned to the repair and reclamation
     section. Duties will include management of crash recovery equipment and the removal of
     crash/damaged aircraft IAW AFI 21-101, Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance
     Management.
     1.2.2. Augmentee members should consist of personnel that assist the CDDAR Team for the
     purpose of identifying system components and advising the team chief on system hazards.
     They may be required to know basic recovery methods and assist as a general labor source.
     1.2.3. When base-assigned C-130 aircraft are involved, augmentee members should be part
     of the 908 MXS repair and reclamation section. Maintenance crew chiefs and other
     maintenance personnel may be needed for technical advice.
     1.2.4. Specialized teams are personnel qualified with specific personal protective equipment
     to secure and contain various hazards associated with recovery operations. These personnel
     can be identified locally to meet situational needs (i.e.; hydrazine team, composites hazard
     team).
1.3. Agencies Involved. Numerous organizations are involved in planning, managing, and
performing recovery operations. This section briefly outlines lists of the following organizations
outside of aircraft maintenance who may be involved.
NOTE: 42 ABW Plan 10-2, Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan, has a listing of
organizations.
     1.3.1. Senior Fire Official (SFO), 42 ABW Plan 10-2, paragraph 3.10.3.1. The SFO will
     respond immediately to the emergency/accident site. Upon arriving at the site, the SFO will
MAXWELLAFBI21-102 20 JULY 2010                                                                    5


   determine and plot the exact location of the accident site and Entry Control Point (ECP) then
   relay the associated grid coordinates and safe route to the 42 ABW CP, 42 OSF/AOA
   Airfield Management Operations, and the EOC if activated.
       1.3.1.1. Request Bioenvironmental Engineering (BE) support through the EOC once
       activated.
   1.3.2. Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD). EOD is not available at Maxwell-Gunter AFB.
   Coordinate all EOD support through the 42 ABW EOC, if activated; otherwise, contact the
   42 ABW/CP, who will establish contact with the proper EOD POC.
NOTE: The nearest military EOD support is available from the US Army, Fort Benning, GA,
DSN: 835-4974 or 835-4154.
NOTE: For nuclear weapons/components, EOD support is available from Barksdale AFB, LA,
DSN: 781-1020 or 781-3765.
   1.3.3. SF Representative, 42 ABW Plan 10-2, paragraph 3.10.4.1
   1.3.4. Emergency Management, 42 ABW Plan 10-2, paragraph 3.13.4

   1.3.11. 908 AW, 42 ABW Plan 10-2, paragraph, 3.13.11
   1.3.12. Host/Tenant Base CDDAR Responsibilities.                Each host base has overall
   responsibility for recovery of host/tenant crashed/disabled aircraft. Since tenant units are
   responsible for the condition/repair of their aircraft, tenant units must be actively involved in
   training to assist host base recovery operations during real world responses. Technical
   expertise, technical data, MDS-unique tools/special equipment, and airframe/system
   familiarization are the primary contributions tenant units make to the host CDDAR program.
   Host units must ensure they are capable to provide and support recovery operations for all
   base assigned aircraft, to include tenant aircraft. Tenant units are required to participate in
   host training exercises and equipment inventories. Tenant units must coordinate with the
   host for CDDAR support, training, exercises, and equipment inventories. Develop Support
   Agreements (SA) to document requirements.
1.4. Recovery Program Responsibilities. The 42 ABW/CC is responsible for implementing
policy, plans and agreements to ensure compliance with established recovery programs, and
ensuring affected organizations publish a unit instruction containing specific responsibilities and
procedures for CDDAR.

1.6. Inspection and Inventory. 42 OSF/AOT and 908 MXG are responsible for inspecting
their respective crash recovery equipment to include: airbags, control consoles, and other
equipment items before and after each exercise or use. Periodic inspections on equipment shall
be conducted as established by Technical Order (TO) or, as a minimum, annually.
   1.6.1. An inventory of all crash recovery equipment will be conducted annually. Document
   inspections and inventories in Maintenance Information System (MIS) and on the crash
   recovery master inventory log. The Air Force Technical Order (AFTO) Form 244,
   Industrial/Support Equipment Record, or Major Command (MAJCOM) approved form will
   be used to document large equipment items (airbag, manifold, etc.).
   1.6.2. Inform     Airfield   Operations     Management in        writing of equipment
   shortages/serviceability that hinders CDDAR support. Maintain a current listing of
   vendors/suppliers in the local area that lease heavy equipment, vehicles or other items that
   are not available on base and may be required.
1.7. Training Requirements.
   1.7.1. All CDDAR team members must be trained in recovery procedures according to this
   instruction, other applicable Air Force and MAJCOM directives, and flight/element
   developed training guides.

     sling, apply enough tension to sling to ensure proper sling positioning (fore and aft). Do not
     lift the aircraft wheels off the ground.
     1.7.3. After initial training of both hands-on and academic training/exercises, all crash
     recovery team members shall receive annual refresher training.
     1.7.4. Additional training items are addressed in chapter 6 of this instruction.
1.8. Recall Procedures. 42 ABW/CP and 908 AW/CP will be given a telephone recall roster by
the CCDAR team chief for all CCDAR personnel that may be recalled during after-hours
operations. During the event of a recall, the CDDAR team chief will be contacted by the
Command Post to initiate a pyramid recall. Team members will have 60 minutes to respond.

                                         CDDAR TEAM

2.1. Purpose. The purpose of this guide is to assist leaders and members of the CDDAR team,
to plan for and conduct successful recovery operations. It is intended to promote thoughts and
ideas for various techniques, which can be used. Any effective variations of these techniques,
new techniques developed, or available new equipment identified should be submitted to
MAJCOM for evaluation.
2.2. Mishap/Accident Investigations. Virtually every aircraft which requires recovery has
been involved in a mishap. Certain conditions require the investigating commander to convene
an accident investigation. CDDAR leaders and planners should be familiar with these procedures
and know the precedence of such investigations over recovery efforts. 42 ABW/JA with
42 ABW/SE may provide assistance regarding the effects of these investigations on recovery
operations.
2.3. Responsibilities. When a mishap occurs on or near a base, the nearest Air Force Base
commander is responsible for providing Crash, Fire-fighting and Rescue (CFR) and EOD
support. He or she also must secure and preserve any evidence or wreckage. Before beginning
any recovery operation, the CDDAR team chief must obtain approval from the incident
commander (IC), the EOD team chief (when applicable) and the investigating commander.
2.4. Urgency of Recovery. Chapter 5 covers methods of aircraft removal for truly urgent
situations. This type of recovery places both assets and personnel at risk and is to be avoided
except during times of tension or war.
2.5. Recovery. Even normal safe recovery procedures can be executed at an increased pace if
conditions warrant. In such cases, techniques may be used which risk additional damage to the
aircraft. The following factors should be considered to determine how great the need is for rapid
recovery. The IC will determine urgency.
   2.5.1. Availability of alternate taxiways.
   2.5.2. Availability of alternate airports.
   2.5.3. Position of disabled aircraft relative to aircraft movement areas.
   2.5.4. Cost of diversions/loss of operations.
   2.5.5. Military alert commitments.

                      OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT (ORM)

3.1. Situation Evaluation. The first task at an aircraft recovery site is to gather information and
evaluate the situation. The initial response team will be able to gather much of this data and
initiate requests for additional information from appropriate sources. This section provides
sample checklists for gathering essential data. Having all this information on a single clipboard
will make it easier to answer questions. Once all necessary information has been gathered it can
and should be used to accomplish a risk assessment, using ORM.
   3.1.1. Safety, definitions, purpose, scope, and using ORM is the common sense approach to
   making calculated decisions on human material and environmental factors. It enables those in
   charge to maximize operational capabilities while minimizing risks at all levels, preserving
   assets, and safeguarding health and welfare. The most important aspect of ORM is to accept
   no unnecessary risk. Use ORM as follows:
   3.1.2. ID Risk. Identify the hazard. Hazard can be defined as any real or potential condition
   that can cause injury, illness, or death to personnel, or damage to or loss of equipment or
   property. The dimensions of a hazard are not confined, nor do they have limits.
   3.1.3. Assess the Risk. Risk is the probability and severity of loss linked to the hazard.
   Assessment is the detection of hazards and the application of measurement to the level of risk
   they represent. The assessment step in the process quantifies probability, severity, and the
   cost.
       3.1.3.1. Analyze Risk Control Measures. Investigate specific strategies and tools that
       reduce or eliminate risk.
       3.1.3.2. Make Control Decisions. Decision makers deal with risk by accepting, avoiding,
       reducing, spreading, or transferring it. This requires the expenditure of assets: money,
       time, procedures, regulations, training, materials, facilities, manpower, or policy.
       3.1.3.3. Risk Control Implementation. Once control strategies have been analyzed, an
       implementation strategy needs to be developed and applied by management and the work
       force.
       3.1.3.4. Supervise and Review. ORM is a process that continues throughout the life
       cycle of the system, mission, or activity. Once controls are in place, the process must be
       scrutinized to determine its effectiveness.
3.2. Environmental, Safety and Health Hazards. The key for developing a safe and effective
CDDAR program is communication and coordination. The CDDAR office of primary
responsibility (OPR) must ensure the BOS Contractor Health and Safety Officer is consulted and
directly involved in determining personnel health hazards, training required, and appropriate
levels of PPE for CDDAR team members under their supervision (i.e. contracted employees).
BE is responsible for determining personnel health hazards, training required, and appropriate
levels of PPE for government augmentees ( i.e. military and civil service employees). For
contractor personnel, 42 MSG/ESH is responsible to contact the IC to obtain aircraft specific
information, such as is required in 1.3.12, if other than 908 AW C-130 aircraft are involved.
MAXWELLAFBI21-102 20 JULY 2010                                                                 11


NOTE: There are two distinct phases of an aircraft mishap--initial response and recovery.
Initial response teams face the probability of an aircraft fire. As the composite material burns,
gases, vapors and solid particles are released into the smoke plume. Recovery team members
may be exposed to fibers and respirable dusts as aircraft parts are moved, modified by cutting,
breaking, twisting, or hammering. Personnel tasked to participate in crash or post-crash
response, recovery, maintenance, and/or clean up operations must be aware of and briefed on all
possible health issues involved. Units must ensure local policies and procedures for handling
crash damaged composites are addressed; to include training and PPE. The BOS Transient Alert
should have the following Personal Protective Equipment on hand:

   a.   A minimum of two full-facepiece respirators (North 5400 or other approved by ESH)
   b.   Organic and HEPA filters
   c.   Tyvek coveralls
   d.   Steel toe boots
   e.   Ear muffs 29 dBA NRR or greater
   f.   Hard hats, Type 1, Class A
   g.   Goggles
   h.   Leather gloves
   i.   Nitrile or latex gloves
   j.   Faceshield

   3.2.1. The BOS Transient Alert office must develop a respiratory protection program for
   proper respirator use IAW Department of Labor, Occupational Safety and Health
   Administration (OSHA) standard Title 29, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part
   1910.134, Respiratory Protection, current edition (i.e. 29 CFR 1910.134). As determined by
   BE and based on government personnel exposure potential, 42 ABW organizations involved
   in CDDAR operations must develop a respiratory protection program for proper respirator
   use IAW Air Force Occupational Safety and Health (AFOSH) Standard 48-137, Respiratory
   Protection Program.

                                             Chapter 4

                                           EQUIPMENT

4.1. Overall Equipment Planning. This chapter deals with equipment commonly used for
Aircraft Recovery. The CDDAR team will be cognizant of the following requirements:
   4.1.1. What equipment is available (inventory).
   4.1.2. The types and capacities of available equipment (cranes, dozers, etc.).
   4.1.3. Contractual arrangements necessary for additional equipment required (Government
   Purchase Card, base contracting, agreements etc.).
4.2. Other Factors. Other factors to be considered are:
   4.2.1. Terrain in the region of responsibilities (woods, hills, water, urban areas, etc.).
   4.2.2. Climate extremes.
   4.2.3. Type and frequency of flying operations.
4.3. Crash Recovery Trailer (908 MXG). Standard equipment in the crash recovery trailer
should include:
   4.3.1. Slings, dollies, tow bridles, etc. for aircraft assigned to that base.
   4.3.2. Ropes, cables, pulleys, chains, etc.
   4.3.3. Empty sandbags, timbers, shoring material.
   4.3.4. Pneumatic lifting bags, hoses, control consoles.
   4.3.5. Plywood sheets.
   4.3.6. Steel plates, pierced steel planking.
   4.3.7. Picks, shovels, sledge hammers, crowbars.
   4.3.8. Grounding rod and grounding cables.
   4.3.9. Gloves, coveralls, hard-hats, body harness, hearing protectors, goggles, etc.
   4.3.10. Fluid sample kits for fuel, oil, and hydraulic fluid.
   4.3.11. Communication headsets and ground cords.
   4.3.12. First aid kits.
   4.3.13. Main landing gear (MLG) cradle (for fighter aircraft).
   4.3.14. Step ladders and step stands.
4.4. Diversified Base Assets. Aircraft recoveries will generally require assets from numerous
base organizations. Aircraft maintenance shops provide both specialized equipment and
personnel trained in its use. Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE) shops will be called upon to
provide support equipment. Organizations such as Civil Engineering frequently have items and
equipment necessary for recovery operations.
MAXWELLAFBI21-102 20 JULY 2010                                                            13


4.5. Common Support Items. Equipment which must be collected from various base locations
may include:
   4.5.1. Maintenance stands and other non-powered AGE.
   4.5.2. Air compressors, generators, lighting, heaters, air conditioners, and other powered
   AGE.
   4.5.3. Mobile Command Post.
   4.5.4. Communications equipment.
   4.5.5. Earth moving equipment.
   4.5.6. Tow vehicles, de-fueling trucks, etc.
   4.5.7. Mechanics tools.
   4.5.8. Sand, gravel, cement, timbers, lumber.
   4.5.9. Cables, chains, hooks, clamps, hand winches.
   4.5.10. Metal cutting saws, bolt cutters.
   4.5.11. Cranes, winch trucks.
   4.5.12. Food, water, coffee, etc. (for recovery personnel).
   4.5.13. Standby medical and fire support.
   4.5.14. Portable temporary shelters.
4.6. Recovery Teams. Commanders will consider recovery teams to be emergency operations
and will allow recovery crews access to disaster preparedness and other emergency assets. The
CDDAR team chief will know what is available from such stores. CE readiness will be contacted
and advance arrangements made to obtain their assets. Emergency stocks may include mobility
assets such as:
   4.6.1. Hand-held radios.
   4.6.2. Mobile communications vans.
4.7. Local Contractor Equipment. CDDAR efforts commonly require items and/or equipment
not available on base. Due to the serious nature of recovery work, funding is usually made
available to purchase or rent local equipment. Local plans should address funding sources and
identify contractual methods to be used. Frequently required items include:
   4.7.1. Large cranes (with properly trained operators).
   4.7.2. Earth moving equipment.
   4.7.3. Timbers, gravel, etc. (in large quantities).

                                            Chapter 5

                                   AIRCRAFT REMOVAL

5.1. Urgent Removal. Depending on the circumstance, a crash, damaged or disabled aircraft
may require immediate removal. This is to be accomplished despite certain additional damage to
the aircraft.
NOTE: Urgent removal scenarios are not usually applicable to most stateside bases.
   5.1.2. An aircraft removed by conventional methods (slings, bags, jacks) will require less
   time to complete damage repairs in comparison to one removed by urgent removal
   techniques (dozer). This difference in repair times may justify use of conventional recovery
   methods despite increased recovery times. Joint decisions are required by the owning
   Command of the aircraft and host-base Command.
5.2. Evaluation of Damage: Unless the recovery team chief possesses significant knowledge
regarding the aircraft type, it is not likely that an accurate damage evaluation can be made.
Where a team chief may see a pile of scrap metal, a mechanic for that aircraft may see numerous
high value spare parts or even a repairable airframe. When possible, type-experienced
maintenance personnel should be called to assist in removals. Thus, damage to critical parts may
be avoided.
5.3. Pulling vs. Pushing: There usually isn’t a need to push an aircraft from a runway or
operational area; pulling is always preferable. Some advantages are as follows:
   5.3.1. Safety: Pulling can be accomplished from a safe distance away from the aircraft. In
   urgent removal situations there will likely be unexploded ordnance, fuel fires, dangerous
   chemicals and/or other hazards to personnel. Removal operations are best conducted away
   from the aircraft.
   5.3.2. Traction: Vehicles used to pull the aircraft can be positioned where traction is better
   than that around the aircraft. Pulling may be done by winch from anchored positions.
   5.3.3. Damage: Pulling usually results in less airframe damage than pushing.
5.4. Pulling Techniques: Winching is a preferred method since it is more controllable. If an
aircraft must be pulled on an arcing path, winching from changing anchor positions is preferred
if terrain allows. Pulling is broken into two parts: cable attachment and airframe sliding
procedures. Sliding procedures applicable to pushing as well as pulling airframes are generally
illustrated in applicable aircraft -3 aircraft structural technical order manuals.
5.5. Cable Attachment: Structural manuals list cable attachment points for various aircraft
types in order to accomplish removal. Generally, landing gear trunnion points, landing gear,
major bulkheads, longerons and wing spar attachment points are used. It may be faster and safer
to use heavy chains with hooks to attach cables with prepared loops to the airframe.
   5.5.1. The attachment should be made at the lowest possible point so that pulling results in
   slight upward lift of the airframe. Attachment is also to be at the airframe points closest to the
   pulling vehicles to avoid downward loading on forward Center of Gravity (CG) points.
MAXWELLAFBI21-102 20 JULY 2010                                                                  15


5.6. Recovery Methods. Aircraft recovery usually involves seven general steps. The extent of
these steps will depend upon the size and type of aircraft and the general situation. Recovery
team members must be familiar with all parts of this section and should consider which
techniques are most likely to be used at their location. Recovery steps:
   5.6.1. Overall assessment, analysis, planning, and briefings.
   5.6.2. Alteration of weight and CG.
   5.6.3. Functional and structural assessment of the aircraft.
   5.6.4. Lifting the aircraft.
   5.6.5. Providing portability to the airframe.
   5.6.6. Lowering the aircraft.
   5.6.7. Movement of the aircraft.
5.7. Briefings. As soon as the initial planning step has been completed, a briefing should be
conducted by the CDDAR team chief for all involved parties. Comments and critique are
encouraged to allow pooling of everyone’s expertise. The briefing should address the next step
(alteration of weight and CG) in detail. A tentative plan to accomplish the remaining recovery
steps should be briefed in general terms. This will allow all involved to begin thinking of various
possible hazards and ways to minimize them. Detailed briefings are best broken down into
several distinct tasks and one person appointed to be responsible for each task. Each task leader
must fully understand their responsibilities and how they interface with others. Task leaders are
expected to brief all other personnel involved in their tasks.
5.8. Briefing Content. Briefings should cover the following topics:
   5.8.1. The tasks to be accomplished (what).
   5.8.2. The intended purpose of each task (why).
   5.8.3. The sequence of the tasks (when).
   5.8.4. Responsibility for each task (who).
   5.8.5. Coordination of the task (how).
   5.8.6. Any known hazards involved.
   5.8.7. Evacuation procedures.
5.9. Evacuation Procedures. Due to the many unknown (as well as known) hazards involved
in an aircraft recovery, an evacuation plan is essential. Every individual involved in the recovery
operation must be informed of evacuation procedures. During extended recovery efforts, shift
changes and the arrival of various specialists must be considered. Plans should be established by
the CDDAR team chief to ensure that everyone entering the security perimeter is advised of
evacuation procedures.
   5.9.1. Three key elements of an evacuation plan are:
       5.9.1.1. Alarm. How an alarm will be sounded if a serious hazard is seen.
       5.9.1.2. Recognition of Alarm.       What the alarm/signal will be for recognition and
       response purposes.
 16                                                   MAXWELLAFBI21-102 20 JULY 2010


       5.9.1.3. Response.     What the appropriate response will be upon receiving the
       alarm/signal.
5.10. Evacuation Signals. Noise level is the primary factor to consider in devising an
evacuation signal. Recovery operations are frequently very noisy. Often nearby aircraft
operations are still being conducted. Visual, as well as audio warnings, should be considered.
Portable air horns, large spotlights, whistles, and megaphones can also be used as signals.
Consider the frequency of the ambient noise and try to use audio signals with different and/or
varying frequencies.
5.11. Alteration of Weight and CG. Prior to lifting an aircraft, especially large aircraft, the
weight is generally reduced as much as possible. In some cases, adding or shifting weight to
selected points may aid recovery by changing the CG.
   5.11.1. Before beginning any weight or CG changes, the existing aircraft weight and CG
   must be determined as closely as possible. Flight crew members, crew chiefs and aircraft tech
   orders are all good sources for this data. The applicable aircraft ―-3‖ structural repair
   instruction contains additional data.
5.12. CG Transfer. In the event that only a portion of the aircraft must be lifted (e.g. single
point landing gear collapse), much work can be saved by shifting the aircraft CG away from the
portion to be lifted. This may actually be more beneficial than reducing the aircraft weight. For
example, if the nose wheel is collapsed, shifting weight (and thus CG) rearward can reduce
effective nose weight until one man can lift it. Several precautions must be taken to control such
operations to avoid overstressing the airframe or causing additional damage.
   5.12.1. The following examples are methods of CG transfer:
       5.12.1.1. CG movement by fuel transfer.
       5.12.1.2. CG movement by cargo transfer.
       5.12.1.3. CG movement by weight addition.
       5.12.1.4. CG movement by weight reduction.
       5.12.1.5. Weight reduction for lifting.
       5.12.1.6. Munitions removal.
       5.12.1.7. Fuel removal.
       5.12.1.8. Engine removal.
       5.12.1.9. Component removal.

                                           TRAINING

6.1. Aircraft Recovery Training General. The transient alert section will establish a training
program. This program will require the identifying of essential personnel to implement
procedures outlined in AFI 21-101, chapter 6 and local directives. Training objectives will
incorporate knowledge, understanding, and hands-on usage. Experience levels will be at the five
and seven level or contractor equivalent, utilizing classroom and application training in
coordination with the 908th CDDAR team chief.
   6.1.1. Levels of training as follows:
       6.1.1.1. Five Level – train and qualify personnel in responsibilities, procedures, technical
       references, and equipment to a knowledge or understanding level needed for recovery
       methods.
       6.1.1.2. Seven Level – operates, explains, understands, and can instruct basic task
       procedures and equipment used in recovery methods.
6.2. Training Requirements. Training requirements may differ from unit to weapon system.
Each unit must use its own judgment to identify conditions particular to assigned aircraft. The
Transient Alert section will focus on the C-130 airframe.
   6.2.1. Classroom instruction will use this CDDAR guide incorporating theory and
   understanding of crash recovery operations.
   6.2.2. Hands-on: Training that requires individual user knowledge and application of
   equipment and tools used. This will be accomplished locally and may be tested in
   conjunction with training hulks if available.
6.3. Recovery Team Qualifications. All team members must be qualified in basic CDDAR
operations. All qualifications are recorded in Maintenance Information Systems (MIS) as
applicable.
   6.3.1. Qualification Training Requirements. All team members must be trained and
   qualified in recovery procedures IAW AFI 21-101, Mission Design Series (MDS) specific
   technical data, and applicable unit-developed training guide.
   6.3.2. All recovery team members must receive annual qualification training following
   initial training comprised of both academic and hands on training/exercises. Ensure all
   qualification training is documented.
6.4. Scenarios. Scenarios are ideal training situations. They enhance real world recovery
requirements. The CDDAR team chief should develop scenarios and incorporate them with
hands-on training.
6.5. Recovery Team Qualification Training. IAW AFI 21-101, all recovery team members
must receive initial training comprised of both academic and hands on training/exercises. IAW
AFI 21-101, AETC Sup 1, use tethering lines during all hoisting operations. When using a hoist
and sling, apply enough tension to sling to ensure proper sling positioning (fore and aft).
Aircraft lifting exercises may be accomplished by using a unit owned aircraft, utilizing training

hulks, or participating with other organizations possessing training assets. Ensure all training is
documented in IMDS. Do not lift the aircraft wheels off the ground.
Note: The actual recovery of an aircraft performed by a unit satisfies the annual requirement
when it meets all aspects of a crash recovery exercise and, for 42 OSF/AOT was evaluated by the
42 CONS Quality Assurance Evaluator (QAE).

                                       MISCELLANEOUS

7.1. Briefings. Briefings will be accomplished by the CDDAR team chief prior to training on
actual aircraft recovery operations. Keep in mind not all situations are common. Each weapon
system has unique concerns to every recovery. Performing operations safely IAW technical data,
Air Force Occupational Safety and Health (AFOSH) and OSHA standards will minimize risks.
When hazards cannot be completely eliminated, consider operational risk management (ORM)
analysis. Below are suggested topics:
   7.1.1. Personal issues, potential mishap or hazards including PPE.
   7.1.2. Can workers be struck by or contacted by anything?
   7.1.3. Can workers strike against or come in contact with any item which can cause injury?
   7.1.4. Can workers be caught in or between anything?
   7.1.5. Can workers fall?
   7.1.6. Can workers overexert?
   7.1.7. Are workers required to do repetitive lifting or heavy lifting?
   7.1.8. Are workers exposed to potential hazards such as toxic gases, chemicals, radiation, or
   noise?
7.2. Safety Assessments. The following are additional personnel and safety assessments
pertaining to aircraft recovery:
   7.2.1. Are workers wearing required PPE (safety toe shoes, hearing protection, gloves, and
   safety goggles)?
   7.2.2. Are workers aware of avoiding suspended loads when lifting items?
   7.2.3. Are workers aware of lifting cable limitations?
   7.2.4. Is on scene supervision assessing the risks in climbing operations?
   7.2.5. Is the crash site area assessed for slip and fall potential?
7.3. Environmental. Aircraft crashes may involve issues and situations that have both before
and after environmental repercussions.        Survey assessment and correction of initial
environmental impacts need to be resolved immediately, such as fluid or gas leakage, cargo
spillage and physical damage to include fire. These items should already be analyzed but may
require technical expertise from the recovery team specialties or base functions. Additional
information may need to be solicited from 42 MSG/CEV, BE and SE prior to entering a recovery
site. Further, the Safety Investigation Board (if convened) will be intimately involved in any
mishap and no recovery operation will proceed until direction is given.
NOTE: Environmental issues are enforced by federal, state, and local laws. Proper authority
must be involved prior to closure of any aircraft incident.
