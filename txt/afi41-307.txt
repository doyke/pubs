This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 41-3, Worldwide Aeromedical
Evacua- tion, and establishes, defines, and implements nursing considerations and standards of
care in the aero- medical evacuation (AE) system. It applies to all AE unit-assigned or associated
in-flight care personnel, and all Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) and Air National Guard
(ANG) medical units. Send com- ments and suggested improvements on an AF Form 847,
Recommendation for Change of Publication, through channels, to HQ AMC/SGN, 203 West
Losey Street, Suite 1600, Scott AFB IL 62225-5219. This is the initial issue of this publication
which replaces AMCR 164-1, Chapter 7, Air Mobility Com- mand Special Publication
(AMCSP) 164-50, Volume 4, Nursing Considerations and Nursing Care Stan- dards.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This interim change establishes the AF 3899L, Patient Movement Record En Route Critical
Care, as the required form for CCATT documentation, outlines minimum requirements for
completing the AF 3899C, Patient Movement Record Physical Assessment, replaces Dramamine
with Meclizine as the approved over-the-counter medication for air sickness, establishes
guidelines for epidural analgesia and peripheral nerve block patients in the aeromedical
evacuation system and establishes the AF IMT 3899M, PCA Pain Management Flow sheet and
the AF IMT 3899N Epidural Analgesia/Peripheral Nerve Block Flow sheet. A margin bar (|)

            GENERAL INFORMATION AND NURSING CONSIDERATONS

1.1. Purpose. Standardizes AE clinical guidelines for providing a safe transportation
environment for Department of Defense (DoD) beneficiaries and designees. Information
presented in this Air Force Instruction (AFI) sets minimal standards for stable peacetime and
stabilized wartime/contingency patient airlift operations. It is not intended to be all-inclusive or
replace current national guidelines and practices. Each provider participating in AE missions
must maintain professional expertise, accepting responsibility and accountability for their own
judgment and actions. Individuals will provide care based upon their AFSC scope of
practice/specific core competencies, level of knowledge, training, and skill.
1.2. Applicability. This AFI applies to all AE unit-assigned or associated in-flight care
personnel, and all AF Active Duty, Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) and Air National
Guard (ANG) medical units.
1.3. Revisions. Direct any recommendations for improvements/changes and current references
to HQ AMC/SGN through command channels, using AF Form 847, Recommendation for
Change of Publica- tion.
1.4. Publication Administration. Distribute this AFI to all AE and staging units. Each AE
flight instruc- tor and evaluator will maintain a copy. A copy will be a part of the AE mission
publications kit. Unit com- manders will determine further distribution requirements.
1.5. Responsibilities. It is the responsibility of AE unit commanders to ensure assigned
personnel are using this document to provide initial and recurring training for aeromedical
evacuation crewmembers (AECMs). Headquarters Air Mobility Command, Command Nurse
(HQ AMC/SGN) is the major com- mand office of primary responsibility for this AFI.
   1.5.1. Definitions:
       1.5.1.1. Warning - Procedures and techniques could result in personal injury or loss of
       life if not carefully followed.
       1.5.1.2. Note - A procedure or technique that is essential to emphasize.
       1.5.1.3. Shall and Will - Used to express that the requirements are binding and
       mandatory.
       1.5.1.4. Should - Used to express a non-mandatory desire or preferred method of
       accomplish- ment and shall be construed as a non-mandatory provision.
       1.5.1.5. May - Used to express an acceptable or suggested means of accomplishment and
       shall be construed as a non-mandatory provision.
1.6. Standards of Care and Performance - General:
   1.6.1. Standards of Care (SOC): Refer to AFPD 46-1. The SOC in the air are adapted to
   the air- craft’s capabilities and limitations, and the in-flight environment.
   1.6.2. Standards of Performance: Refer to AFPD 46-1. The standards of professional
   performance are the expected level of function based on education, level of experience and
   criteria of the current AFSC position requirements. AMC/SGN has adopted the Air and
 8                                                                 AFI41-307 20 AUGUST 2003


     Surface Transport Nurses Associa- tion (ASTNA) standards of professional performance
     (when operationally feasible).
     1.6.3. Standards of Practice: Refer to AFPD 46-1. The identified level of accomplishment
     focuses on the personnel and includes competence, experience, and education of the medical
     personnel, as the situation permits. The primary goal of AE medical transport is to meet the
     perceived, actual, or poten- tial health needs of the patient, while maintaining the continuum
     of care. NOTE: Commanders are responsible for assuring the clinical currency of assigned
     personnel.
     1.6.4. Continuum of Care: Matching an individual’s ongoing needs with the appropriate
     level and type of medical, psychological, health, or social service within an organization and
     across multiple organizations.
     1.6.5. Legal Considerations.
        1.6.5.1. All flight nurses (FNs) and aeromedical evacuation technicians (AETs) shall be
        familiar with legal standards of nursing practice as described in current texts and
        references listed in this AFI. The AECMs and Critical Care Air Transport Team
        (CCATT) members have a responsibility to notify the Medical Crew Director (MCD) of
        all incidents, accidents, and legal problems detected during the mission. Such matters
        shall be carefully documented as close to the occurrence as possible.
            1.6.5.1.1. The medical crew director (MCD) is responsible for identifying and
            elevating the above issues to the Tactical Airlift Control Center/Air Mobility
            Operations Control Center/Air Operations Center/Patient Movement Requirements
            Center (TACC/AMOCC/AOC/PMRC) and AMC/SG.
        1.6.5.2. Patient’s Property. Use AF IMT 1053, Record of Patient Storing Valuables;
        on http://www.e-publishing.af.mil/search.asp?keyword=1053&Go.x=23&Go.y=9.

        1.6.5.3. Medical-Legal Considerations. Medical personnel may subject the Air Force
        to liability if negligent in the performance of duties or in the discharge of obligations.
        Negligence is the devi- ation from accepted standards of performance. All personnel must
        exercise sound and prudent judgment in providing patient care.
            1.6.5.3.1. Patient Injury. In the event a patient is injured while in the AE System,
            the FN, AET, CCATT, staging facility nurse and medical technician or Flight
AFI41-307 20 AUGUST 2003                                                                        9


           Surgeon will document the injury and care rendered on the patient’s medical record.
           Complete and forward a DD Form 2852, AE Event/Near Miss Report; document
           occurrence on AF Form 3829, Summary of Patients Evacuated by Air.
           1.6.5.3.2. Signing Forms for Patients. The FN may sign a document as required on
           behalf of an unconscious, incompetent or infectious patient, and if physically unable.
           When signing for the patient, indicate “for unconscious patient, John Doe.” For other
           patients, an entry of “patient unable to sign” may be made. Two witnesses will sign
           the form in both instances.
           1.6.5.3.3. Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) Orders.
              1.6.5.3.3.1. AE personnel are not authorized to accept “partial” code orders. For
              example, CPR only, no intubation and chemical code only.
                  1.6.5.3.3.2.1. A completed AF For 3838, DNR Certification for Aeromedical
                  Evacu- ation, attached to an AF IMT 3899, Patient Movement Record.
                  1.6.5.3.3.2.2. “Do Not Resuscitate” order on DD Form 602 or AF Form 3899
                  that is signed, dated and timed. NOTE: DNR orders will not be more than 72
                  hours before the originating flight.
              1.6.5.3.3.3. Prior to flight, verify the order with the patient and/or the patient’s
              family.
           1.6.5.3.4. Unaccompanied Minors/Incompetent Adults. Any unaccompanied
           minor, under the age of 18 or any unaccompanied non-active duty patient who is
           incapable of directing their own care will have a DD Form 2239, Consent for
           Medical Care and Transportation in the AE System attached to the DD Form 602
           or AF Form 3899.
              1.6.5.3.4.1. Minors under the age of 14 will have an attendant.
                  1.6.5.3.4.1.1. If a parent or guardian cannot accompany a minor under 14, the
                  originat- ing medical facility will send a responsible adult as the non-medical
                  attendant (NMA). This NMA will carry a written Power of Attorney to cover
                  the time period the minor will be in the AE system.
                  1.6.5.3.4.1.2. If the parent or guardian is unavailable to sign the DD Form
                  2239 a tele- phone consent may be obtained by two witnesses who will verify
                  the call and sign the DD Form 2239.
              1.6.5.3.4.2. Minors over the age of 14 may travel alone.
1.7. Special Considerations for Patients Who Are Seriously Ill and Those at Significant
Risk. There is a critical need for ongoing interaction among all those concerned with carrying
out the mission to ensure patient sensitivity, safety, continuum of care, quality assurance/risk
management, and profession- alism.
   1.7.1. Medical Attendants (MA). MAs are required for patients whose needs exceed the
   capabilities of the medical crew or who require special attention en route. The supporting
   PMRC identifies the requirement for a MA and coordinates with the referring medical
   treatment facility (MTF). The refer- ring MTF will provide the required MAs, except during
   contingencies. In some instances, MAs may be additional AECMs. All MAs are responsible
 10                                                                AFI41-307 20 AUGUST 2003


   for providing patient care and coordinating patient care requirements with the MCD/FN.
   MAs will document care and administer medication in-flight, and will remain with the
   patient and coordinate breaks with the medical crew. At en route remaining overnight (RON)
   stops, MAs will brief personnel providing direct patient care for their patient(s) during rest
   periods and will remain available for consultations. The MA will accompany the patient to
   the MTF or may be relieved by the same level care provider from the receiving MTF at the
   flight line.
   1.7.2. Critical Care Air Transport Team (CCATT). Each CCATT consists of one
   intensivist or non-intensivist physician (as the situation dictates), one critical care nurse, and
   one cardiopulmonary craftsman specially trained to provide critical care/specialty care during
   aeromedical transport. They represent a critical care team that can be added to the basic AE
   crew in order to offer a higher level of care to stabilized patients during AE staging and
   flight. The CCATT utilizes basic AE equipment and enhances treatment capability with
   expanded drugs and ventilation equipment. CCATTs have no stand alone electrical,
   mechanical, or oxygen equipment. The AF Form 3899L is the required CCATT
   documentation form and serves as the legal record of patient care while in the AE system.
       1.7.2.1. During mission execution, CCATTs will organizationally align under the AE
       command structure, and will be a supporting element of the staging facility or any AE
       element. The CCATT physician is the clinical authority during missions, and with the
       other team members, is responsi- ble for documenting and providing care; they may be
       called upon to consult and/or assist in the care of other patients. When in-flight, the
       CCATT works with and receives mission operational direction from the MCD. The
       mission operational management authority and responsibility remains with MCD.
1.8. Comfort Items and Procedures. Making a patient comfortable during airlift requires
knowledge of the stresses and hazards of flight. Making an appraisal of the patient’s particular
situation, using available equipment and improvising can provide many small comfort measures.
NOTE 1: During contingencies, patients may not have personal hygiene, comfort items, and
extra clothing. NOTE 2: Frequently assess adequacy of pain control measures.
   1.8.1. Reducing Fatigue. All patients are susceptible to the effects of fatigue. Litter patients
   require special planning and care to reduce fatigue. Besides decreased atmospheric pressure,
   oxygen tension, humidity, and noise, they are subjected to constant vibration. Several basic
   nursing interventions can be accomplished to counter these stresses of flight.
       1.8.1.1. When appropriate, place litter patients in seats for short periods of time.
       Mobilization of patients reduces fatigue and helps prevent venous stasis and deep vein
       thrombosis.
       1.8.1.2. When condition or diagnosis prevents the patient from getting up, and is not
       contraindi- cated, backrests are available to elevate their head. The backrest is the best
       and easiest way of pro- viding head elevation. Encourage active and passive exercises.
       1.8.1.3. If special equipment is not available, elevate the patient’s head with rolled
       towels or blan- kets as props or immobilizers. Patient’s limbs should be supported in the
       position of function.
AFI41-307 20 AUGUST 2003                                                                         11


   1.8.2. Position Changes. Combined with ambulation, head elevation, and support of limbs,
   there is a need for position change. Position changes should be made every 2 hours. When
   conditions do not permit position changes, range of motion exercises should be performed.
NOTE: When feasible, all litter patients should ambulate frequently, assisted to the lavatory and
allowed to sit in a seat; ensure adequate pain control. Encourage ambulation every two hours for
patients whose condition warrants to prevent deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
   1.8.3. Skin Care. Lotion is a standard supply item for back rubs and/or skin care.
   Disposable wash- cloths are available and can be placed in a plastic bag, dampened with hot
   or cold water, and distributed to the patients. Antiseptic towelettes are available and will be
   offered before meals and after a patient uses a urinal or bedpan.
   1.8.4. Oral Hygiene. When toothbrushes and paste are available, offer to patients so they
   may brush their teeth. Disposable “toothettes” make an acceptable substitute for
   toothbrushes. Patients who are to ingest nothing by mouth (NPO) can be given mouthwash.
   Mouth care is essential because of the reduced humidity in the aircraft cabin. The best way to
   combat reduced humidity and resulting dehy- dration in high-risk patients is to monitor
   intake and output (I & O), and provide adequate oral fluid intake at least every 2 hours.
   Comatose, paralyzed, and other patients at risk should have mouth care at least every 2 hours.
   A 4x4 sponge dipped in mouthwash can be used to clean the mouth. This pro- cess can be
   repeated until the mucous membranes of the mouth, tongue, and teeth are clean. If avail-
   able, use a 4x4 sponge dipped in mineral oil and apply a very light coating on the mucous
   membranes. Application of petroleum jelly to the lips is also helpful.
   1.8.5. Sleep. On long flights, provide patients with extra pillows and blankets to make them
   as com- fortable as the environment allows. Disposable earplugs will be offered to each
   patient to reduce noise. Dimming the lights in-flight provides an atmosphere for sleep and
   relaxation. An uncomfort- able position may hinder sleep more than the vibration and noise
   of the engines.
   1.8.6. Ambulatory Patients. Ambulatory patients generally require minimal assistance for
   comfort. Observe patients for signs of discomfort from pain or fatigue. When possible, extra
   litters are carried for ambulatory patients unable to complete a flight sitting up. Periodically,
   during en route stops and long flying intervals, patients should be encouraged to stand up and
   stretch to promote circulation to the extremities. Any complaints of calf tenderness or new
   posterior leg pain must be evaluated by the AECM.
   1.8.7. Latrine Facilities. Although the location of latrines is provided in the preflight
   briefing, this information may be of little value to litter-bound patients. Brief patients that
   urinals, bedpans, and modesty curtains are available for them; if not, patients may assume no
   provisions have been made. Some patients may wait until they are in extreme distress before
   inquiring about meeting elimination needs. NOTE: Assess toileting needs to limit the impact
   on the patient during mission launch and exe- cution, especially with large patient loads.
1.9. Vital Signs. Because of the stresses of flight, special consideration is given to vital signs.
They must be closely monitored since a change may be the first indication a patient’s condition
is deteriorating.
   1.9.1. Temperature, Pulse, and Respiration (TPR). Obtain any time a patient’s condition
   and/or nursing judgment indicates a need. TPRs are required and recorded on patients with
 12                                                                 AFI41-307 20 AUGUST 2003


   elevated temper- atures, suspected or known infections, or abnormal pulse rates. In addition,
   in-flight TPR checks should be performed on VSI/SI patients, those with head injuries,
   inflammatory processes, infections, and/or those experiencing dehydration in-flight.
   1.9.2. Blood Pressure (BP). When indicated, a BP should be obtained as part of the
   preflight assess- ment. If the BP is abnormal, compare readings bilaterally. Because of the
   noise level on aircraft, BP readings cannot always be heard by stethoscope and may have to
   be palpated.
       1.9.2.1. If using palpation for determining the BP, the reading may vary 8 to 10 mm Hg
       when compared to an auscultation reading. The pressure is charted as systolic/P. Diastolic
       pressure can- not be determined in this manner.
   1.9.3. Pulse Oximetry (pulse ox). Obtain a preflight oxygen saturation baseline and
   recheck at cruise altitude when patients have risk factors that may lead to in-flight hypoxia or
   aggravated by hypoxia.
   1.9.4. Neurological Checks. Depending on the patient’s condition, pupils will be checked
   and the level of consciousness noted on a specific schedule (Refer to Table 3.1, Glasgow
   Coma Scale). Assessment of grip, sensory, and motor responses is also necessary.
1.10. Nursing Care Guidelines. Ensure every effort is made to provide for the continuity of
care for each patient. Personnel will:
   1.10.1. Carefully observe all patients throughout the course of the mission.
   1.10.2. Regularly inspect casts, dressings, drainage tubes, restraints, and the skin condition
   of chronic and immobilized patients and appropriately document findings.
   1.10.3. Plan nursing care using the patient’s chart and other information to control pain,
   conserve the patient’s energy and avoid fatigue.
   1.10.4. Maintain patient rapport; answer questions, keep the patient informed, comfortable,
   and well nourished/hydrated.
   1.10.5. Administer medications and treatments as ordered. Administer medications in-flight
   on the same schedule as in the originating MTF or as near as possible. The goal of
   administering any type of medication or treatment in the AE system is to maintain the
   continuity of care from the originating MTF to the destination MTF without significant
   delays. Adjust administration times to the destination time zone, if there are no
   contraindications. NOTE: Frequently assess adequacy of pain control mea- sures.
   1.10.6. Maintain litters to present a neat, orderly appearance. Straighten or change sheets and
   position litter straps as required. Keep the aircraft interior neat and clean when possible.
   1.10.7. Periodically distribute comfort items.
   1.10.8. Provide ear plugs, blankets, and pillows if available.
   1.10.9. Provide beverages for those not on fluid restrictions at least every 2 hours.
   1.10.10. Serve meals as close to normal mealtimes as possible. Special diets are usually
   served first. Assist patients with eating as necessary.
AFI41-307 20 AUGUST 2003                                                                        13


   1.10.11. The MCD and charge medical technician (CMT) will direct, supervise, and assist
   the other AECMs while they are performing patient care and other in-flight duties.
1.11. Medical Emergency/Change in Patient Status.
   1.11.1. In an emergency or wartime situation, a provider must take reasonable and necessary
   action within their knowledge and experience to preserve life and health.
NOTE 1: In the absence of direct physician contact/supervision and when operationally feasible,
FNs will immediately start interventions following the most current American Heart Association
advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) algorithms. Refer to Attachment 13, In-Flight Adult
ACLS. If no AECMs are currently trained, follow basic life support (BLS) protocols, establish
oxygen (O2), and an intravenous (IV) line. All IV solutions will be either lactated ringers (LR) or
normal saline (NS).

NOTE 2: A trained and competent FN may administer medication according to established
protocols IAW this AFI. Refer to 7.4.
   1.11.2. Immediately notify the aircraft commander (AC) regarding the gravity and nature of
   the situ- ation. Request and establish immediate radio communication with the Tactical
   Airlift Control Center/ Air Mobility Operations Control Center/Air Operations Center/Patient
   Movement Requirements Cen- ter (TACC/AMOCC/AOC/PMRC) for a physician and
   guidance for landing at an airfield capable of handling the situation, when indicated. If
   unable to contact TACC/AMOCC/AOC/PMRC, contact a physician on the ground for further
   direction of patient care.
   1.11.3. Per TACC/AMOCC/AOC/PMRC guidance, land at the nearest airfield capable of
   handling the situation. In grave circumstances, the MCD may request the AC declare an in-
   flight medical emer- gency to expedite landing.
   1.11.4. Notify the supporting TACC/AMOCC/AOC/PMRC regarding changes in patient
   status, mis- sion irregularities, coordination of mission needs, and equipment/transportation
   requirements as soon as possible (ASAP).
NOTE: The patient’s name and SSN will not be used in radio or cell phone communications;
use the patient’s cite number only.
       1.11.4.1. Be ready to communicate age, sex, diagnosis, subjective and objective data,
       including vital signs and pulse oximetry, known allergies, and for women of childbearing
       years: Date of last menstrual cycle, if indicated. Also report treatment/intervention, date
       and time (if indicated), and the outcome. Be prepared to request orders, mission
       deviation/divert, etc. to expedite meeting patient and mission requirements.
   1.11.5. Anytime a patient is removed from a flight for clinical evaluation or there is a
   significant change in status, notify TACC/AMOCC/AOC/PMRC, ASAP.
       1.11.5.1. A member of the medical crew should accompany the patient to the MTF to
       maintain the same level of care and to provide report to the MTF physician. NOTE: In
       some instances, a civilian ambulance will respond to transport the patient to the MTF and
       the local memorandum of agreement may not permit military medical personnel to ride in
       the ambulance.
 14                                                                AFI41-307 20 AUGUST 2003


           1.11.5.1.1. If a member of the medical crew cannot accompany the patient to the
           MTF, a report will be provided to the receiving MTF physician via radio or
           telephone. The original DD Form 602/AF Form 3899 and other medical records will
           accompany the patient to the MTF.
       1.11.5.2. Whenever possible, the MCD will ensure a copy of the DD Form 602/AF Form
       3899 is Faxed to the PMRC. If the DD Form 602/AF Form 3899 cannot be copied,
       provide detailed infor- mation on AF 3829, and complete DD Form 2852.
1.12. Patient Validation/Acceptance for Flight.
   1.12.1. The patient movement clinical coordinator (PMCC) in the PMRC obtains all
   necessary clini- cal data and medical equipment requirements from the attending physician
   prior to manifesting the patient for movement.
   1.12.2. If the patient requires total care or continuous observation, a MA from the
   originating medical facility or staging unit may be required to accompany the patient. The
   PMRC will coordinate this requirement with the originating physician. Depending on the
   severity of illness/injury and the situa- tion, the CCATT may be the MAs on the mission. The
   PMRC will request CCATT support from the TACC/AMOCC/AOC.
   1.12.3. The PMCC will provide the MCD and the receiving MTF with all pertinent clinical
   data and equipment requirements. The MCD will brief the other AECMs and flight crew as
   necessary. NOTE: In the event the MCD has determined a patient is not stable/stabilized, is
   at significant risk for flight, or requires care beyond the scope of the AE crew, the MCD will
   coordinate with the TACC/AMOCC/ AOC/PMRC before refusing the patient. Depending on
   the contingency/tactical environment, refus- ing a patient for flight may not be applicable.
1.13. Enplaning/Deplaning Procedures. Refer to AFI 11-2AE, Vol 3 (forthcoming).
1.14. Patient Movement Classification: Designates patient status (either litter or ambulatory),
based on diagnosis and ability to self-help in an emergency, and are assigned by originating
physician in coordina- tion with the PMRC. The MCD may assign a higher classification, e.g. 2B
to 2A if the patient’s condition warrants the upgrade. The MCD may not downgrade a patient’s
classification, e.g., 1A to 1C.
WARNING: Medical personnel should be mindful of unreported patient status changes or
clinical encounters that occur after the initial reporting of patient movement requests, especially
during AE mis- sions and RON MTF locations. All medical personnel will continuously and
independently reassess and document patient status, and ensure appropriate patient classification
and treatments that lead to safe patient transport outcomes. This consists of recurring and
focused patient/family interviews, patient edu- cation, and preflight, in-flight, and post-flight
physical assessments. Very often in the in-flight environ- ment, the primary assessment skills are
inspection and palpation. Ther efore, collaboration, communication, and documentation by
clinical providers is critical in the AE environment.

NOTE: Immediately notify TACC/AMOCC/AOC/PMRC if change in patient
status/classification impacts continuity of care, transportation and other requirements. Complete
DD Form 2852.

      FLIGHT PHYSIOLOGY AND THE PHYSIOLOGICAL STRESSES OF FLIGHT

2.1. General Principles of Flight Physiology/Gas Laws. The independent variables of
temperature, pressure, volume, and relative mass of a gas govern the body’s physiologic
response to barometric pres- sure changes as the aircraft changes altitude.
   2.1.1. Boyle’s Law: The principles of gas expansion. At constant temperature, the volume
   of gas is inversely proportional to the pressure. An increase in altitude causes a decrease in
   barometric pres- sure. One example is the volume of gas in a balloon will expand at altitude.
   2.1.2. Dalton’s Law: The law of partial pressure. The total pressure of a gas mixture is the
   sum of the individual (or partial) pressures of all gases in the mixture.
   Barometric/atmospheric pressure is the pressure exerted against an object by the atmosphere.
   As altitude increases, barometric pressure decreases. Oxygen concentration remains 21%
   regardless of altitude. Barometric pressure multiplied by the concentration of gas is equal to
   the partial pressure of the gas. As altitude increases, the partial pressure of a gas decreases.
   The actual available oxygen decreases with altitude because oxygen mol- ecules move farther
   apart, possibly resulting in hypoxia.
   2.1.3. Charles’ Law: When the pressure is constant, the volume of gas is nearly
   proportional to its absolute temperature. If the mass of gas is kept under constant pressure
   and the temperature of the gas increases or decreases the volume will increase or decease
   accordingly. When flying at sea level to 35,000 ft, temperature decreases 1 degree every 100
   meters (330 ft). As an example, the pressure read- ing in an oxygen tank decreases as the
   temperature decreases.
   2.1.4. Henry’s Law: The principle of evolved gas disorders. The solubility of gases in
   liquids: The quantity of gas dissolved in 1 cm3 (1 ml) of a liquid is proportional to the partial
   pressure of gas in contact with the liquid. The weight of gas dissolved in a liquid is directly
   proportional to the weight of the gas above the liquid. An example is shaking a can of soda
   and opening it immediately. The balance of pressure is altered, releasing the bubbles of gas
   in the soda. The release of nitrogen bubbles into the blood after a rapid decompression
   causing the bends is another example.
   2.1.5. Graham’s Law: The law of gaseous diffusion. Gases flow from higher pressure (or
   concentra- tion) to a region of lower pressure (or concentration). Simple diffusion or gas
   exchange at the cellular level is an example.
2.2. Physiological Stresses of Flight. Patients in the AE environment are more susceptible to
physio- logic stresses encountered at altitude. These stresses of flight include decreased partial
pressure of oxy- gen, barometric pressure and thermal changes, decreased humidity, noise,
vibration, fatigue, and gravitational forces (G-Forces).
   2.2.1. Decreased Partial Pressure of Oxygen (paO2). Dalton’s gas law states the total
   pressure of a mixture of gases is equal to the sum of the partial pressures of each gas in that
   mixture. This gas law in addition to Boyle’s, Charles’s and Henry’s gas laws affects the
   volume, temperature, and pressure of all gases, at a given altitude. Therefore, with higher
AFI41-307 20 AUGUST 2003                                                                           19


  altitude, the pressure on all gases, including oxygen, is decreased. This leads to the condition
  called hypoxia.
  2.2.2. Barometric Pressure Changes. Boyle’s Law states at a constant temperature, the
  volume of gas is inversely proportional to the pressure. On ascent gas expands and on decent
  gas contracts. Therefore, trapped or partially trapped gases within certain bodily cavities;
  i.e., the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, lungs, skull, middle ear, sinuses, and teeth expand in direct
  proportion to the decrease in pressure. This increased volume becomes significant as 1 liter
  of gas at sea level becomes 1½ liters at 9,000 feet. For example, the discomfort associated
  with certain types of diseases or injuries, gas expansion at higher altitudes may constitute a
  real threat by disturbing cardiopulmonary dynamics. Untreated gas expansion in the
  abdominal cavity can raise the diaphragm. With diaphragmatic crowd- ing, lung volume, and
  expansion are decreased. If this distention is great enough, the vessels in the area will
  become compressed, altering the blood supply to vital organs.
     2.2.2.1. Equilibrium of pressure is dependent upon the size of the opening into the
     cavity, the extent of the pressure changes, the density of pressure of the inside gas, and
     the elasticity of the cavity or chamber walls. Management in-flight is directed toward
     atmospheric changes in the air- craft cabin during ascent and descent. The equilibrium
     between the gas inside and outside the cav- ities, i.e., the ears and sinuses, must adjust as
     the cabin environment moves through the changes in barometric pressure.
  2.2.3. Thermal Changes. An increase in altitude results in a decrease in ambient
  temperature. Air- craft cabin temperature fluctuates considerably depending on the
  temperature outside the aircraft. This is caused by the inability of temperature controls to
  respond rapidly, and the necessity to open aircraft doors at en route stops. Inside aircraft
  temperature variations from 15C (59F) or lower, to 25C (77F) should be expected in winter
  flying, and in summer 20C (68F) to greater than 35C (95F) is not uncom- mon. This wide
  variation requires the AE crewmember be aware of cabin temperature changes in rela- tion to
  patient care and comfort.
     2.2.3.1. Hyperthermia and hypothermia can be seen with many disease conditions, i.e.,
     burns, and certain neurological disorders in the neonate. Both conditions increase the
     body’s oxygen require- ments. In hyperthermia, metabolic rate increases, whereas in
     hypothermia, shivering increases the energy needs and therefore, increases the body’s
     oxygen consumption.
     2.2.3.2. Thermal and vibration change, depending on if the change is to hot or cold, can
     have either an antagonistic or synergistic effect. The body’s primary response to heat
     exposure is vasodilatation and activation of the cooling mechanisms. Cold exposure and
     vibration stimulate vasoconstriction and decreased sweating. Exposure to whole body
     vibration appears to interfere with the normal human response in a hot environment by
     reducing blood flow and decreasing the sweat rate. Turbulence can be produced by high
     and low temperature changes in the outside air. Turbulence increases stress during flight
     by promoting fatigue and increasing susceptibility to motion sickness and disorientation.
     2.2.3.3. Maintenance of adequate body temperature can be accomplished by anticipating
     these thermal changes. Blankets, warm clothing, and liquids can be supplied to patients as
     needed. In the event of extreme temperatures, or malfunctioning of the aircraft heating or
     air-conditioning sys- tems on the ground, request a H-1 heater (Ground heater) or MA-30
20                                                                AFI41-307 20 AUGUST 2003


     air conditioning unit (ground air-conditioner unit) or another approved system from
     Maintenance/Operations.
 2.2.4. Decreased Humidity. When air is cooled, it loses its ability to hold moisture. Air at
 altitude is cold, possessing very little moisture. The higher the altitude, the colder and drier
 the air. The fresh air supply is drawn into the aircraft cabin from a very dry atmosphere.
 When an aircraft takes off, there is a small amount of moisture present in the cabin air,
 furnishings, clothing and other items in the cabin. Additionally, a small amount of moisture
 is generated from the respiration of the people on board. As the aircraft increases altitude, the
 air exhausted overboard eventually carries trapped moisture away. Eventually, virtually all
 the original moisture is lost. After 2 hours of flying time on a typical flight, there is less than
 5% relative humidity. After 4 hours, relative humidity is less than 1%.
     2.2.4.1. Patients with respiratory problems will begin to feel uncomfortable if the
     humidity drops much below 5 to 10%. For a healthy person, low humidity results in
     nothing more than chapped lips, scratchy or slightly sore throat, hoarseness, and general
     moisture loss. But for a patient, this decreased humidity often aggravates their condition.
     2.2.4.2. Patients receiving oxygen therapy in-flight are doubly jeopardized because
     oxygen is a drying agent. Use humidification devices for all patients receiving oxygen
     whenever possible. Special units are available for warming humidification and to keep
     the secretions loose in the lower respiratory tract. Tracheostomy patients in particular
     may require warmed humidification during AE.
         2.2.4.2.1. Some steps to minimize the problems caused by decreased humidity
         include, mouth care, lip balm, and adequate fluid intake.
  2.2.5. Noise. Noise may be defined subjectively as a sound that is unpleasant, distracting,
  unwar- ranted, or in some other way undesirable. The human hearing mechanism has a wide
  range and is fairly tolerant, but in many aircraft this tolerance is exceeded.
     2.2.5.1. Unprotected exposure to noise can produce undesirable effects, i.e., interference
     with effective communications, temporary (auditory fatigue), permanent threshold shifts
     (sensorineural hearing loss), and varying levels of fatigue.
         2.2.5.1.1. Auditory fatigue incurred by noise is frequently accompanied by a feeling
         of “full- ness,” high-pitched ringing, buzzing, or a roaring sound (tinnitis) in the ears.
         Tinnitus of this type will usually subside within a few minutes after cessation of the
         noise exposure, but for some individuals it may continue for several hours. Most of
         the truly significant forms of undesirable response to acoustic noise, such as nausea,
         disorientation, and excessive general fatigue, are associated only with very intense
         noise, such as a blast or explosion. Other signs of exposure are loss of appetite and
         interest, diaphoresis, salivation, nausea or vomiting, head- ache, fatigue, and
         discomfort.
     2.2.5.2. When reducing noise levels is not feasible, patients should be offered and
     encouraged to Wear earplugs, and instructed in their proper use.
  2.2.6. Vibration. When the human body is in direct contact with a source of vibration,
  mechanical energy is transferred, which is degraded into heat within those tissues that have
  dampening properties. The response to whole body vibration is an increase in muscle activity
AFI41-307 20 AUGUST 2003                                                                       21


  both to maintain posture and to reduce the resonant amplification of body structures. This is
  reflected in an increase in metabolic rate, and a redistribution of blood flow with peripheral
  vasoconstriction. The increase in metabolic rate during vibration is comparable to that seen in
  gentle exercise, and respirations are increased to achieve the necessary elimination of
  increased carbon dioxide. Additionally, disturbances in visual acuity, speech, and fine-
  muscle coordination result from vibration exposure.
     2.2.6.1. The effects of vibration on the body can be reduced by attention to the source of
     vibra- tion, either by modification of the transmission pathways, or alteration of the
     dynamic properties of the body. Aircraft manufacturers have eliminated severe vibrations
     by using improved designs and materials; however, some vibrations still occur as a result
     of engine operation, flap, and land- ing gear extension and retraction, and general aircraft
     movement.
     2.2.6.2. To minimize these reactions, AECMs should properly secure patients away from
     the bulkhead and floor, encourage and assist with position changes, and provide adequate
     padding and skin care.
  2.2.7. Fatigue. All of the stresses of flight induce fatigue to some degree. It can be said that
  fatigue is an inherent stress in the airborne world. Erratic schedules, hypoxic environment,
  noise, vibration, and imperfect environmental systems will eventually take their toll. Fatigue
  is the end product of all the physiological and psychological stresses associated with
  exposure to altitude. Factors may be self-imposed stresses.
     2.2.7.1. D - Drugs. Use of over-the-counter (OTC) drugs, misuse of prescription drugs,
     and use of stimulants such as caffeine can cause insomnia, tremors, indigestion, and
     nervousness.
     2.2.7.2. E - Exhaustion. Exhaustion can lead to judgment errors, limited response, falling
     asleep, channeled attention, and changes in circadian rhythm.
     2.2.7.3. A - Alcohol. Using alcohol may cause histotoxic hypoxia, affect efficiency of
     cells to uti- lize oxygen, interfere with metabolic activity, and can result in a hangover.
     2.2.7.4. T - Tobacco. Besides exposing the body to tar, nicotine and carcinogens,
     smoking two packs of cigarettes per day results in 8-10% of the body’s hemoglobin being
     saturated with carbon monoxide.
     2.2.7.5. H - Hypoglycemia. Poor dietary intake can cause nausea, headache, dizziness
     and judg- ment errors.
  2.2.8. Gravitational Forces (G-Forces). Acceleration and deceleration along the
  longitudinal axis (fore/aft) is the most important G- force to be considered in aeromedical
  transport. Newton’s First Law of Motion states that unless acted upon by a force, a body at
  rest will remain at rest, and a body in motion will move at constant speed in a straight line.
     2.2.8.1. The implications here are primarily applicable to the neurological patient,
     especially those sustaining head trauma. When the aircraft accelerates or decelerates, it is
     possible that already swollen or bruised brain or spinal cord tissue could experience
     further damage. These patients are secured on a padded on a litter with a backrest (if not
     contraindicated) with the head facing aft for flight.
 22                                                                 AFI41-307 20 AUGUST 2003


         2.2.8.2. Acceleration/deceleration in side facing and rear seats requires extra padding
         between the abdomen and seat belt for small children, pregnant women, and patients with
         abdominal surgery.
2.3. Hypoxia: A condition where there is a decrease in tissue oxygen or oxygen supply
inadequate for meeting tissue needs. Hypoxia is a general term describing an oxygen deficiency
in the tissues sufficient enough to cause impairment of function. Oxygen deficiency can result
from various causes. A low partial pressure of oxygen (paO2) may not mean tissue hypoxia and
may be clinically acceptable.
   2.3.1. Satisfactory oxygenation is contingent on certain factors. These include patent
   respiratory pas- sages, neuromuscular function, elastic lungs, and a movable thoracic cage as
   well as an adequate rate and depth of respiration, which in turn is dependent on an intact
   respiratory center in the brain stem. Additional factors are: An adequate supply of blood at
   the alveolar level, diffusion of oxygen from alveoli to the blood, adequate hemoglobin in the
   blood, and adequate circulation of blood to tissue cells.
   2.3.2. Stages of Hypoxia in Normal Individuals.
         2.3.2.1. Indifferent Stage: Starts at sea level and extends to 10,000 ft. The body reacts
         with a slight increase in heart rate and ventilation. Night vision begins to diminish at
         5,000 ft.
         2.3.2.2. Compensatory Stage: Extends from 10,000 ft to 15,000 ft. The body attempts
         to protect itself against hypoxia by increasing blood pressure, heart rate, and the rate and
         depth of respira- tion. Efficiency and performance of tasks requiring mental alertness
         becomes impaired.
         2.3.2.3. Disturbance Stage: Extends from 15,000 ft to 20,000 ft. Characterized by
         dizziness, sleepiness, tunnel vision, and cyanosis. Thinking becomes slowed and there is
         a loss of muscle coordination.
         2.3.2.4. Critical Stage: Extends from 20,000 ft to 30,000 ft. Marked mental confusion,
         incapaci- tation followed by unconsciousness.
      2.3.3. Major Causes of Hypoxia in the AE Environment:
         2.3.3.1. High Altitude: Due to decreased paO2 at altitude. NOTE: Altitude is the most
         important cause of in-flight hypoxia.
         2.3.3.2. Hypoventilation: Decreased alveolar ventilation, or any condition resulting in
         decreased partial pressure of oxygen in the alveoli. Hypoventilation is often caused by
         diseases outside the respiratory system and can exist when lung tissue is normal.
         2.3.3.3. Lung Pathology: Conditions of the lungs producing arterial hypoxia in the
         presence of normal alveolar paO2 is termed “increased alveolar-arterial oxygen tension
         difference.” Three mechanisms contribute to this condition:
            2.3.3.3.1. Diffusion Defect: Interference with diffusion of oxygen from alveolar air
            into pul- monary blood results in lowered paO2. This is seen in diffuse pulmonary
            infiltration, intersti- tial fibrosis or early edema, viral pneumonia, sarcoidosis, and
            anemias.
AFI41-307 20 AUGUST 2003                                                                       23


            2.3.3.3.2. Abnormal Perfusion-Ventilation Ratio: An important aspect of normal
            lung physiology is local/regional optimization of alveolar perfusion based on the
            ventilation of the alveolar-capillary units. In certain lung diseases there is a
            breakdown of this optimization with a resulting deterioration in gas exchange. This is
            seen in patients with pulmonary emphysema, status asthmaticus, pulmonary edema,
            pulmonary embolus, or chronic bronchitis.
            2.3.3.3.3. Intrapulmonary Shunts: When the ventilation perfusion ratio is
            abnormal due to poor ventilation of the alveoli, the blood passes through the involved
            parts of the lung without the oxygen-carbon dioxide exchange occurring. For
            example, in lobar pneumonia, the blood passes directly from the pulmonary arterial
            circulatory system into the pulmonary venous sys- tem without a gas exchange.
   2.3.4. Types Of Hypoxia:
       2.3.4.1. Hypoxic Hypoxia (Altitude Hypoxia): Caused by exposure to the airborne
       environ- ment. Results in deficiency in alveolar oxygen exchange. A lower barometric
       pressure at altitude results in a decrease in alveolar paO2 and interferes with ventilation
       and perfusion. Any condition requiring oxygen at sea level must be closely monitored at
       altitude.
Altitude                                             Blood oxygen saturation

Sea Level                                            98%

10,000 ft                                            87%

22,000 ft                                            60%
       2.3.4.2. Hypemic Hypoxia: A reduction in the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood
       caused by anemia, hemorrhage, hemoglobin abnormalities (sickle cell disease), drugs
       (sulfur nitrites), or chemicals (cyanide, carbon monoxide). Carbon monoxide has a 200 x
       greater affinity to bond to hemoglobin than oxygen.
WARNING: Pulse oximetry reading may not be accurate in carbon monoxide poisoning.
       2.3.4.3. Stagnant Hypoxia: A reduction in total cardiac output due to the pooling of
       blood and the reduced blood flow to the tissues. Interferes with the transportation phase
       of oxygen by reduc- ing systemic blood flow. Causes include: Respiratory failure, shock,
       continuous positive pressure ventilation, acceleration (G-Forces), pulmonary embolus,
       extremes in environmental temperature, postural changes, tourniquets, hyperventilation,
       embolus (clot or gas), cardiovascular embolus, high positive end expiratory pressure
       (PEEP), arterial spasm, and heart failure.
   2.3.5. Characteristics of Hypoxia:
       2.3.5.1. The onset of hypoxia may be gradual or insidious. Intellectual impairment
       occurs as slow thinking, faulty memory of events and immediate recall, delayed reaction
       time, and a tendency to fixate. As aircrew members, we are afforded the opportunity to
       experience and identify our own symptoms of hypoxia, during initial and refresher
       Altitude Physiology Training. Generally, patients are not familiar with their personal
 24                                                               AFI41-307 20 AUGUST 2003


         symptoms of hypoxia, so we must be alert to all possi- ble signs and symptoms they may
         exhibit. Because aeromedical patients are already in a compro- mised state, they will
         usually experience the effects of hypoxia earlier than normal. Hypoxia can be classified
         either by objective signs (those perceived by an observer) or by subjective symptoms
         (those perceived by the subject). NOTE: Cyanosis has been determined to be an
         unreliable sign of hypoxia because the oxygen saturation must be below 75% in persons
         with normal hemoglobin before it is detectable.

Belligerence                                      Anger
   2.3.6. Prevention: Administer O2 based on underlying pathology, preflight vital signs and
   pulse oximetry. Consider an altitude restriction and placement near O2 for high-risk patients.
      2.3.7. Treatment of Hypoxia. Refer to Airway, Breathing and Respiratory Management.
         2.3.7.1. Maintain airway, breathing, and circulation (ABCs).
         2.3.7.2. Administer O2 at 4-6 liters via nasal cannula. Administer high flow O2 for
         severe symp- toms or respiratory/cardiac arrest. Encourage slow, deep breaths.
         2.3.7.3. Obtain vital signs and use a pulse oximetry to maintain the O2 saturation above
         91%. Annotate maximum cabin altitude (MCA).
         2.3.7.4. Request lower cabin altitude if unresponsive to high flow O2 and operationally
         feasible. Complete DD Form 2852.
NOTE: Monitor oxygen equipment in-flight. The most frequently reported cause of hypoxia
while using oxygen is lack of discipline and equipment malfunction. Conscientious equipment
preflight checks and frequent in-flight monitoring will reduce this hazard. Inspection of oxygen
equipment when hypoxia is suspected may reveal the cause. Correction of the malfunction
should help bring immediate relief. If it does not, and other physiologic causes for all types of
hypoxia have been addressed, oxygen contamina- tion should be considered as the cause. Use an
AFI41-307 20 AUGUST 2003                                                                        25


emergency oxygen cylinder, and descent should be initi- ated as soon as possible and followed
by the analysis of the oxygen system contents.
       2.3.7.5. Altitude Restrictions and Supplemental Oxygen: The decision for an altitude
       restric- tion or supplemental oxygen administered at altitude should be based on the
       following:
           2.3.7.5.1. Most aircraft normally used for AE must fly at altitudes much lower than
           their nor- mal cruise to maintain sea level pressurization in the cabin. Flying lower at
           a lower altitude increases fuel consumption, decreases range, and increases the
           probability of turbulence. Inap- propriate cabin altitude restrictions can result in the
           use of alternate routes, which lengthen air miles flown, and increase time and cost of
           flight.
           2.3.7.5.2. At a 7,000 feet altitude, a healthy person’s paO2 is 60 mmHg or about 90
           percent saturation. Studies indicate important parameters in assessing the risks of
           altitude exposure in patients with cardio-respiratory disorders. Patients with a paO2
           below 60 mmHg (90 percent saturation) will probably have difficulty with hypoxic
           hypoxia at or above 2,000 to 4,000 feet.
              2.3.7.5.2.1. During cruise altitude, patients with decreased pulmonary perfusion
              and those with cardiac conditions should be closely observed. Patients having a
              pulmonary disease with an undetected coronary artery disease may be affected
              significantly by hypoxic hypoxia.
              2.3.7.5.2.2. Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) should
              be administered low flow oxygen therapy (1 to 2 liters per minute via nasal
              cannula, or a 24 to 31 percent venturi mask) to avoid suppression of their hypoxic
              drive. NOTE: Closely monitor respiratory rate if receiving higher concentrations
              of O2.
           2.3.7.5.3. Disease Pathologies Requiring Preflight Evaluation and Possible
           Altitude Restrictions: Pulmonary emphysema and chronic bronchitis. Extensive
           pneumonic consoli- dation, extensive tumors or granulomatous processes, pulmonary
           atelectasis and infarction, status asthmaticus, aspiration pneumonia, diffuse
           parenchymatous diseases, interstitial fibro- sis, alveolar proteinosis, sarcodosis, and
           lymphagitic spread of carcinoma. Refer to Table 4.1 O2 Delivery Systems.
2.4. Hyperventilation: An abnormal increase in the rate and depth of breathing.
Hyperventilation is of concern because it produces changes in cellular respiration. Although
unrelated in cause, the symptoms of hyperventilation and hypoxia are similar and often result in
confusion and inappropriate corrective proce- dures. NOTE: Treat as hypoxia when in-flight.
   2.4.1. Contributing Factors:
       2.4.1.1. Psychological stress: Fear, anxiety, apprehension, and anger.
       2.4.1.2. Environmental Stress: Decreased partial pressure of oxygen, barometric
       pressure changes, thermal changes, decreased humidity, noise, vibration, fatigue, and G-
       Forces.
       2.4.1.3. Drugs: Salicylates and progesterone.
 26                                                                  AFI41-307 20 AUGUST 2003


         2.4.1.4. Physiological: Metabolic acidosis, increased temperature, pregnancy, and
         altered neuro- logical status.
      2.4.2. Treatment for Hyperventilation:
         2.4.2.1. At altitude, the treatment for hyperventilation and hypoxia of the AE patient is
         identical. Administer high flow O2 and encourage slow deep breathing. Refer to Table
         4.1
         2.4.2.2. When a patient is hyperventilating from anxiety, the act of putting a mask on his
         or her face to administer oxygen may heighten the anxiety and increase tidal volume.
         Talk with the patient to find out why they are hyperventilating and give them exercises to
         reduce respiratory rate.
            2.4.2.2.1. Methods to reduce the patient’s respiratory rate include counting to 10
            slowly as they exhale, working with the patient to control inhalations and exhalations
            to only 10 times a minute. Give the patient a watch with a second hand and instruct
            them to maintain a respira- tory rate between 10 and 16 breaths per minute.
2.5. Hypercapnia: Refers to increased amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the blood. CO2
accumulates in the blood due to poor alveolar ventilation. As the O2 in the blood is lowered, the
CO2 is raised. The increased CO2 stimulates the respiratory center in the brain stem. Elevated
partial pressure of arterial car- bon dioxide (paCO2) is a powerful vasodilator, producing both
peripheral and cranial vasodilatation. Any condition that causes poor alveolar ventilation can
result in hypercapnia.
   2.5.1. Signs/Symptoms of Hypercapnia: Headache, vertigo, hypertension, papiledema,
   hypoten- sion (late stage), coma, and cardiac failure.
   2.5.2. Hypoxia and hypercapnia are physiologic states that often contribute significantly to
   the mar- ginal condition of the patient on the ground. The cabin altitude attained in a
   pressurized aircraft pro- duces only a modest reduction in hemoglobin oxygen saturation, but
   the reduction can cause a deficiency that is critical to vital tissues if the patient’s pre-existing
   condition is marginal. Decreased partial pressure of oxygen (paO2) will affect all of the body
   organs.
      2.5.3. Pathological States Primarily Producing Hypercapnia:
         2.5.3.1. Central Nervous System. Pharmacological depression (barbiturates, narcotics,
         alcohol, and tranquilizers), cerebrovascular accident, meningitis and encephalitis, severe
         intracranial hypertension, associated with trauma, and tumors may cause hypercapnia.
         2.5.3.2. Diseases of Nerves and Muscles: Guillain-Barre’ Syndrome, Muscular
         Dystrophy, Myasthenia Gravis, insecticide poisoning, tetanus, chronic progressive
         polyneuropathy, diptheric polyneuritis, and poliomyelitis.
         2.5.3.3. Diseases of the Chest Wall: Flail chest and kyphoscoliosis.
         2.5.3.4. Metabolic Diseases: Severe hypothyroidism, starvation, obesity, and electrolyte
         imbal- ance.
         2.5.3.5. Pulmonary Causes: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (emphysema and
         chronic bronchitis), acute obstructive disease, severe asthmatic disease, acute
         bronchiolitis, mechanical obstruction such as blood, water, or pus, pulmonary edema,
AFI41-307 20 AUGUST 2003                                                             27


     massive parenchymal lung disease, restrictive disease of the pleura, severe pain or
     diaphragmatic embarrassment after surgery, mechanical obstruction of large airways,
     upper respiratory obstruction, and obstruction of trachea or large bronchi.

                                   PRE-FLIGHT ASSESSMENT

3.1. Assessment: Patient and mission requirements and the setting will determine how
extensive this process will be. Tactical and peacetime patient information flow is variable.
Obtain as much history as possible from the supporting PMRC, the patient, and other providers.
The following guideline deals with the trauma patient entering the AE environment but can be
modified to meet other types of patients.
   3.1.1. Mechanism of Injury: Obtain as much history as possible to focus assessment.
         3.1.1.1. Identify what force produced the wound (penetrating or blunt).
         3.1.1.2. Identify areas of the body most subject to secondary trauma. Blunt trauma may
         not give a clue about injuries.
         3.1.1.3. Identify injuries that can be predicted from history (i.e. ARDS, infection from
         open wounds, etc.).
         3.1.1.4. Identify how the stresses of flight will affect the outcome for this patient.
3.2. Primary Survey: Accomplished at the scene or when the patient is initially seen by
medical person- nel at a first aid station, MTF, MASF, ASF, CASF or at the flight line. Life
threatening conditions are identified and management begins. Ensure this is done prior to flight.
Reassessment of ABCs is ongoing. NOTE 1: In the AE environment, the primary assessment
skills are inspection and palpation. NOTE 2: The following are ASTNA and Trauma Nurse Core
Course (TNCC) guidelines. Other nationally recog- nized primary and secondary trauma
assessment standards that quickly identify and treat life-threatening conditions are acceptable.
   3.2.1. Airway with C-Spine Control.
         3.2.1.1. Assessment: Ascertain patency; rapidly assess for airway obstruction.
         3.2.1.2. Treatment/Management.
             3.2.1.2.1. Establish a patent airway. Refer to Airway and Respiratory Management.
             3.2.1.2.2. If C-spine injury is suspected, maintain the C-spine in a neutral position
             with man- ual immobilization when establishing the airway.
      3.2.2. Breathing: Ventilation and Oxygenation.
         3.2.2.1. Assessment:
             3.2.2.1.1. Expose the neck and chest. Maintain C-spine immobilization, if indicated.
             3.2.2.1.2. Determine the rate and depth of respiration; effective/ineffective.
             3.2.2.1.3. Inspect and palpate the neck and chest for tracheal deviation and vein
             distention, unilateral and bilateral chest movement, use of accessory muscles, nasal
             flaring, any signs of injuries or deformities, and crepitis.
             3.2.2.1.4. Percuss the chest for presence of dullness or hyper-resonance.
             3.2.2.1.5. Auscultate the chest bilaterally as environment allows.
AFI41-307 20 AUGUST 2003                                                                         29


       3.2.2.2. Treatment/Management: Refer to Airway and Respiratory Management.
           3.2.2.2.1. Administer high flow oxygen.
           3.2.2.2.2. Ventilate with bag-valve mask or pocket mask.
   3.2.3. Circulation.
       3.2.3.1. Assessment.
           3.2.3.1.1. Determine the source of external hemorrhage
           3.2.3.1.2. Pulse: Quality, location and rate. NOTE: A palpable radial pulse indicates
           a systolic BP of at least 80 mm Hg; a palpable femoral pulse indicates a BP of at least
           70 mm Hg; a pal- pable carotid pulse indicates a BP of at least 60 mm Hg.
           3.2.3.1.3. Assess perfusion by evaluating skin color, moisture, temperature and
           capillary refill.
           3.2.3.1.4. Obtain blood pressure and paradoxical pulse, if time permits.
       3.2.3.2. Treatment/Management: Refer to Shock Management.
           3.2.3.2.1. Control bleeding.
           3.2.3.2.2. Insert 2 large bore IVs (14-16g), if indicated. Simultaneously obtain blood
           for hematological and chemical analysis, type and cross match, depending on clinical
           situation and local procedures. Not an in-flight requirement.
           3.2.3.2.3. Initiate IV fluid therapy with (warmed, PRN) Ringer’s Lactate solution (1st
           choice), or normal saline (2nd choice), and blood replacement as ordered.
   3.2.4. Disability: Brief Neurologic Examination.
       3.2.4.1. Determine the Level of Consciousness (LOC): The most important indicator of
       brain function. Avoid words such as stupor or coma, as these words have different
       meanings for differ- ent people. Refer to the following AVPU scale below for guidance:
A - Alert - Is the patient alert and oriented to person, place, and time?
V - Does patient respond purposefully to vocal stimuli?
P - How does patient respond to painful stimuli? Is the response purposeful?
Decorticate - extensor rigidity in the lower extremities combined with flexor
posture in the upper extremities. May be more prominent on one side than the other.
Decerebrate - extensor rigidity in all extremities. Flaccid - no response.
U – Unresponsive
   3.2.5. Exposure/Environment: If condition and situation warrants, completely undress the
   patient. Prevent hypothermia, if possible.
   3.2.6. Diagnostics: History, vital signs, cardiac monitor and pulse oximeter applied as
   necessary.
3.3. Secondary Assessment. This assessment is a brief, systematic process to identify ALL
injuries, obtain history and mechanism of injury as well as maintaining core body temperature,
obtaining a com- plete set of vital signs, temperature, pulse oximetry, and the insertion of a Foley
catheter and nasogastric tube, as required.

  3.3.1. General Appearance: Note the patient’s body position, posture and any guarding or
  self-pro- tection movements. Observe for stiffness, rigidity, or flaccid muscles. Note unusual
  odors such as alcohol, gasoline, chemical, vomitus, urine or feces. Previous assessments, the
  patient’s condition and environment determine the extent of this assessment.
 3.3.2. Head and Maxillofacial.
     3.3.2.1. Assessment:

                     AIRWAY AND RESPIRATORY MANAGEMENT

4.1. Stresses of Flight.
   4.1.1. Decreased Partial Pressure of Oxygen: Exacerbates possible oxygenation deficiencies
   due to the compromised respiratory system and diminished cilliary action.
   4.1.2. Barometric Pressure Changes: May cause spontaneous pneumo-thorax in a trauma
   patient with significant respiratory compromise. GI tract gas expansion may cause
   diaphragmatic crowding lead- ing to lower tidal volumes.
   4.1.3. Thermal: Heat increases body temperature and cold produces muscle shivering
   increasing the metabolic rate and O2 demand on the body. This is particularly true in
   ventilator dependent patients.
   4.1.4. Decreased Humidity: The effectiveness of cillary action is decreased and secretions
   are thicker.
   4.1.5. Fatigue: Most patients with respiratory disorders are already fatigued from the added
   workload of just breathing. The overall effect of the previously mentioned stresses of flight
   and the total length of time in the AE system may exacerbate the patient’s condition.
4.2. Assessment.
   4.2.1. Ascertain the mechanism of injury or disease. Look, listen and feel for the following
   indicators requiring possible intervention:
       4.2.1.1. Use of accessory muscles, intercostal and substernal retractions, crowing,
       stridor, nasal flaring, and position of patient.
       4.2.1.2. Tongue obstructing the airway in an unconscious victim.
       4.2.1.3. Loose teeth and/or other foreign objects.
       4.2.1.4. Facial and/or oral bleeding.
       4.2.1.5. Facial fractures resulting in loss of maxillary and mandibular structural integrity.
       4.2.1.6. Inhalation injury or nasal/mucosal charring.
       4.2.1.7. Tracheal edema.
       4.2.1.8. Hematomas, bruising, wounds, and crepitus of neck and upper chest.
       4.2.1.9. Severe respiratory distress or status epilepticus may require sedation or
       paralyzing agents.
       4.2.1.10. Note position of trachea.
       4.2.1.11. GCS < 8 may indicate hypoxia.
4.3. Treatment/Management of the Airway.
   4.3.1. Airway Obstructed or Partially Obstructed:
36                                                               AFI41-307 20 AUGUST 2003


     4.3.1.1. Position patient to allow for maximum ventilation. Consider a backrest if not
     contraindi- cated.
        4.3.1.1.1. Unconscious patient - place in the supine position with additional cervical
        spine immobilization, if indicated.
     4.3.1.2. Clear the Airway: Techniques to open or clear an obstructed airway include:
        4.3.1.2.1. Jaw Thrust (preferred technique for C-spine injuries).
        4.3.1.2.2. Head Tilt/Chin Lift.
        4.3.1.2.3. Manual removal of loose or foreign debris.
        4.3.1.2.4. Suctioning (do not invoke a gag reflex).
            4.3.1.2.4.1. Hyperventilate the patient for approximately 60 seconds with 100%
            oxygen before and after suctioning.
            4.3.1.2.4.2. Do not suction longer than 10 seconds.
            4.3.1.2.4.3. Suctioning or other manipulations of the oropharynx are performed
            gently to prevent stimulation of the gag reflex and subsequent vomiting.
     4.3.1.3. Use of Airway Adjuncts: Refer to ACLS/ATLS/PALS for appropriate size
     selection.
        4.3.1.3.1. Oropharyngeal or Nasopharyngeal Airways.

            4.3.1.3.2.1. Indications: Used if gag reflex is intact or teeth are clenched, and
            when the insertion of an oral airway is technically difficult or impossible (because
            of trismus, mas- sive-trauma around the mouth, mandibulo-maxillary wiring,
            etc.).
            4.3.1.3.2.2. Contraindications: Facial or basal skull fractures.
            4.3.1.3.2.3. Complications: If tube is too long or large, it may enter the esophagus
            produc- ing gastric distention, and may cause severe epistaxis or adenoid
            bleeding, especially in children.
     4.3.1.4. Advanced Airway Treatment/Management. WARNING : These procedures
     will be performed by specially trained healthcare professionals working within their
     ASFC scope of prac- tice.
        4.3.1.4.1. Intubation.
            4.3.1.4.1.1. Orotracheal Intubation.
                4.3.1.4.1.1.1. Indications: Cardiac arrest, inability of the patient or the rescuer
                to ade- quately ventilate with high flow O2 or protect the airway with
                conventional methods.

   oxygen.
   4.4.2. Assure there will be sufficient O2 available in-flight.
   4.4.3. Administer oxygen for:
       4.4.3.1. Any signs of hypoxia and respiratory distress or significant change from original
       assess- ment. Refer to Flight Physiology and the Physiological Stresses of Flight and
       Table 4.1
          4.4.3.1.1. When administering O2 to correct hypoxia, allow approximately 3-5
          minutes to elapse; this will provide a more accurate pulse oximeter reading. NOTE:
          Any patient with a prn order for O2 who requires O2 or who is unexpectedly placed
          on O2 in-flight will have an entry on AF Forms 3899/DD Form 602, DD Form1380

Desired Sea Level Equivalent (SLE) Oxygen Percentage
      Even though the delivered O2 may be at 100%, the partial pressure of oxygen necessary to deliver
      100% SLE cannot be obtained (ex: 100% O2 @ 8,000 feet only provides 75% O2 SLE).
      Desired % O2 SLE cannot be obtained at these altitudes.

EXAMPLE: A patient receiving fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 30% while on the ground
and who will be flying at a cabin altitude of 8,000 feet will need to have the FiO2 increased to
40% to deliver the same partial pressure of oxygen as the patient was receiv- ing on the ground.

           the ET or tracheostomy.
WARNING 1: If a CCATT team and/or a cuff pressure monitor are unavailable and an endot-
racheal tube (ET) or tracheostomy tube cuff requires inflation for flight, ensure it is not inflated
with air. Inflate cuffs with sterile normal saline (NS) solution or IAW the manufac- ture’s
recommendations. Use the minimal leak technique to avoid tissue trauma. Document use of NS
on DD Form 602 and AF Forms 3829 and 3899. WARNING 2: Using NS in the endotracheal or
tracheostomy cuffs may decrease blood flow to tissue and interfere with future cuff management
at the receiving MTF resulting in a more complex airway re-intubation.

NOTE: The CCATT physician may elect to fill endotracheal and tracheostomy tube cuffs with
air and then attach to a cuff pressure monitor to minimize tissue trauma and the complications of
re-intubation. Cuff pressure is usually maintained between 15-20 cm, and will be checked pre-
flight, at cruise and hourly, on descent, and prior to deplaning. Document cuff pressures on DD
Form 602 and AF Forms 3829 and 3899.
       4.4.4.4. Ventilator Patients.
           4.4.4.4.1. Only approved ventilators will be used for AE missions. AECMs are
           responsible for ensuring the ventilator interfaces with aircraft systems and a dedicated
           regulator/oxygen line is available to operate ventilators. WARNING: Refer to AFI
           41-309, AE Equipment Stan- dards, for a list of approved ventilators, and prior to
           attaching a ventilator to an oxygen source.
           4.4.4.4.2. An MA familiar with the ventilator, a respiratory therapist, or both should
           accom- pany ventilator patients.
           4.4.4.4.3. A dedicated suction unit and manual resuscitator is assigned to the patient.
           4.4.4.4.4. Considerations for Ventilator Patients:

               4.4.4.4.4.8. Soft wrist restraints in place to prevent extubation.
               4.4.4.4.4.9. Re-evaluate the patient and ventilator settings at altitude; changes at
               altitude may require ventilator-setting adjustments. Tidal volume and FiO2 are
               examples.

               4.4.4.4.4.10. PEEP settings will remain constant at altitude. Patients with PEEP
               do not have additional risks at altitude. Refer to AFI 41-309.

           if color changed from original assessment.
4.5. Chest Tubes. Chest tubes may be left in position for AE but a Heimlich valve should be in
place prior to patient transfer to the flightline, and will be in place prior to flight. Chest drainage
units listed in AFI 41-309 are approved for airborne use; follow individual equipment
requirements as directed. Glass bottles will not be used in-flight.
   4.5.1. In normal situations, patients with recently removed chest tubes will not be airlifted
   until the following conditions are met:
       4.5.1.1. A minimum of 24 hours post chest tube removal.
       4.5.1.2. Expiratory and lordotic chest x-ray at least 24 hours post chest tube removal
       with the interpretation documented in the patient’s medical records. NOTE: In
       contingency operations these requirements may not be feasible.
       4.5.1.3. Occlusive dressing is applied to the site where the chest tube was removed.
   4.5.2. Preflight    /In-Flight  Considerations     and     Care    for    Chest     Tube
   Patients. WARNING: Hands-on preflight assessment, including breath sounds, vital signs
   and pulse oximetry, and inspection of the chest tube and its connections are essential for
   successful patient outcomes.
       4.5.2.1. Ensure all connections are taped, and tubing is not looped or kinked and not
       hanging below the drainage system.
       4.5.2.2. Mark level of collection chamber, remembering water from the water seal
       chamber will be pulled into the collection chamber after each descent. Refer to AFI 41-
       309.
       4.5.2.3. Document whether or not there is an air leak in the water seal (bubbling
       indicates free air in the chest).
       4.5.2.4. Chest tubes may be left in position for AE and a Heimlich Valve is not needed if
       the chest drainage system has an integral one-way valve and is approved for in-flight use
       (i.e. Atrium model 4050). The Heimlich Valve is required when chest tubes are
       connected to straight drainage (i.e. empyema) and when using AE approved chest
       drainage systems without an integral one-way valve (i.e. Pleurevac).
           4.5.2.4.1. Chest drainage units listed in the current AE Equipment Standards are
           approved for use in-flight; ensure familiarity with conditions for use. Other drainage
           units may be encoun- tered in the AE system and are acceptable if a one-way valve
           system is present and conditions for use are followed and a waiver is obtained IAW
           the AMC AE Equipment Standards Guide. NOTE: The sending MTF is not required
           to supply Kelly Clamps for transfer to AE system.

       4.5.2.5. Do not allow the chest drainage system to be above the level of the chest.”
       ADD: NOTE: Position patient mid-tier to facilitate drainage. WARNING: When
       operationally feasible, one should not floor load patients with chest tubes.
       4.5.2.6. Do not clamp the chest tube while moving the patient.
       4.5.2.7. Maintain and document I&O on each trip segment and as required.
       4.5.2.8. Check the suction control frequently; evaporation may occur in-flight, changing
       the amount of suction. Adjust the suction control to maintain minimal bubbling.
       4.5.2.9. Move and drain chest drainage tubing hourly to facilitate flow and prevent
       clotting. Do not milk chest tubes because it causes increased intra-pleural pressure.
       4.5.2.10. Unless contraindicated, position on a backrest for comfort. Pain medication as
       required.
4.6. Pulmonary Emergencies.
   4.6.1. Initial Response.
       4.6.1.1. Maintain the airway and assist breathing.
       4.6.1.2. Administer high flow O2 to maintain pulse oximetry greater than 91%. Refer to
       Table 4.1
WARNING: If a COPD patient is unstable and/or needs assistance with a resuscitation device,
give high flow O2 (Refer to Table 4.1.).

NOTE: High concentrations of O2 may produce respiratory depression in patients who retain
CO2 (i.e.; COPD) because the increase in PaO2 blocks the stimulant effect of hypoxemia on the
respiratory center. Administer O2 at 2-4 LPM via nasal cannula for stable COPD patients.
       4.6.1.3. Start IV to keep vein open (KVO).
       4.6.1.4. Consider altitude restriction based on mission requirements; confer with AC.
       4.6.1.5. Contact TACC/AMOCC/AOC/PMRC for guidance and possible diversion to a
       MTF capable of handling the situation, as required.
   4.6.2. Asthma/Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).
       4.6.2.1. Assess Signs and Symptoms:
          4.6.2.1.1. Tachypneic, labored respirations with increased effort on exhalation
          (prolonged).
          4.6.2.1.2. Possible cough and dyspnea.
          4.6.2.1.3. Signs of Hypoxia: Fatigue, headache, dizziness, and irritability.
          4.6.2.1.4. The absence of wheezing, difficulty speaking, and use of accessory
          muscles indi- cates an emergent situation.
       4.6.2.2. Treatment/Management: Refer to Initial Response paragraph 4.6.1
          4.6.2.2.1. Administer medication and oxygen as directed. Refer to paragraph 4.6.1.2
          4.6.2.2.2. Force fluids or IV therapy, if not contraindicated.
44                                                                AFI41-307 20 AUGUST 2003


  4.6.3. Tension Pneumothorax.
     4.6.3.1. Usually occurs as a result of blunt or penetrating thoracic trauma, and as a
     complication of treating an open pneumothorax; this may also include a kinked or clotted
     chest tube. Air enters the pleural space and is unable to escape on expiration. As a result,
     air accumulates in the inter- pleural space, and the interpleural pressure increases with
     each inspiration. The involved lung col- lapses and the mediastinum shifts to the opposite
     side, compressing the contralateral lung. Venous return to the heart is decreased and
     perfusion becomes poor.
     4.6.3.2. Assess Signs and Symptoms:
        4.6.3.2.1. Signs of hypoxia (agitation and tachycardia). Refer to Table 2.1
        4.6.3.2.2. Severe respiratory distress with dyspnea (air hunger and rapid respirations)
        and cyanosis.
        4.6.3.2.3. Tracheal shift to unaffected side.
        4.6.3.2.4. Decreased or absent chest expansion on affected side.
        4.6.3.2.5. Diminished or absent breath sounds on affected side.
        4.6.3.2.6. Difficulty ventilating ET.
        4.6.3.2.7. Distended neck veins and hypotension.
        4.6.3.2.8. Hyperresonance on percussion.
        4.6.3.2.9. Presence of clots in the chest tube or Hemilich valve.
     4.6.3.3. Treatment/Management: For additional information, refer to ATLS/TNCC.
        4.6.3.3.1. If this occurs preflight, the patient is not stable for flight. If this occurs in-
        flight, decrease the cabin altitude, if operationally feasible, and contact
        TACC/AMOC/AOC/PMRC for guidance and possible diversion to a MTF capable of
        handling the situation.
        4.6.3.3.2. If chest tube is present:
            4.6.3.3.2.1. Assure the drainage system is operational.
            4.6.3.3.2.2. If clotting is suspected, “milk” the drainage tubing to move plugged
            clots. “Milk” the drainage tubing in the direction of the drainage system – assure
            all connections are secure. With one hand, hold the drainage tubing approximately
            four inches from the distal end of the Hemilich valve; with the other hand,
            squeeze the tubing and pull in the direction of the drainage system, approximately
            12 inches. Monitor the drainage in the chest tube and the Hemilich valve for the
            presence of clots of fibrin; change the Hemilich valve if clotted.
        4.6.3.3.3. If chest tube is not present:
            4.6.3.3.3.1. Needle Thoracostomy (temporary procedure pending placement of
            chest tube): Pressure must be relieved immediately with large bore needle or
            intravenous cathe- ter. WARNING: This intervention will be performed by
            specially trained healthcare pro- fessionals working within their ASFC scope of
            practice. For additional information, refer to ATLS/TNCC
AFI41-307 20 AUGUST 2003                                                                     45


  4.6.4. Open Pneumothorax. Air enters the chest via an open wound; also known as a
  “sucking chest wound.”
     4.6.4.1. Assess Signs and Symptoms:
         4.6.4.1.1. Severe respiratory distress with dyspnea and cyanosis.
         4.6.4.1.2. Gurgling, sucking wound.
         4.6.4.1.3. Tachypnea and grunting.
     4.6.4.2. Treatment/Management.
         4.6.4.2.1. Cover the wound at the end of exhalation with a sterile occlusive dressing.
         Tape dressing on three sides to create a “flutter valve” effect. Air is prevented from
         entering the chest on inspiration but is allowed to escape on expiration.
         4.6.4.2.2. If respiratory distress continues to increase, a tension pneumothorax may
         be devel- oping. If this is suspected, remove the occlusive dressing to allow the
         trapped air to escape. Re-tape the dressing as described above.
  4.6.5. Flail Chest.
     4.6.5.1. Multiple rib fractures with loss of chest wall stability. Normal thoracic function
     and gas exchange is impaired, and the underlying pulmonary contusion and splinting of
     the fracture pain leads to hypoventilation and hypoxia. The flailing segment moves
     inward during inspirations and outward during expiration. Severe muscle spasms may
     conceal the flailing segment.
     4.6.5.2. Signs and Symptoms.
         4.6.5.2.1. Respiratory distress with dyspnea, cyanosis, and hypoxia.
         4.6.5.2.2. Paradoxical chest wall movement.
     4.6.5.3. Treatment/Management.
         4.6.5.3.1. Administer high-flow humidified oxygen. Refer to Table 4.1
         4.6.5.3.2. Intubate and assist with ventilation, based upon degree of hypoxia and the
         degree of stabilization. WARNING: This intervention will be performed by specially
         trained healthcare professionals working within their ASFC scope of practice.
         4.6.5.3.3. May have PEEP or Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) for
         stabilization.
         4.6.5.3.4. Monitor intravenous fluid infusion to prevent over hydration.
         4.6.5.3.5. Splint chest or place on affected side.
         4.6.5.3.6. Pain control.
  4.6.6. Massive Hemothorax.
     4.6.6.1. Assess Signs and Symptoms:
         4.6.6.1.1. Severe respiratory distress with dyspnea.
46                                                              AFI41-307 20 AUGUST 2003


        4.6.6.1.2. Labored breathing, not attributable to tension pneumothorax, open
        pneumothorax and flail chest, and combined with other data, e.g. mechanism of
        injury.
        4.6.6.1.3. Signs of shock and hypoxia. Refer to paragraph 6.2.3.1. and Table 2.1.

                                    BURN MANAGEMENT

6.1. Burns. Burn patients are frequently transported on AE missions and require intensive in-
flight nurs- ing care. The expert management consultants for worldwide AE are at the US Army
Institute of Surgical Research. CONUS burn patients transferring to this facility are normally
accompanied by a burn team from the center. The burn team, only under special circumstances,
accompanies burn patients from over- seas. The TACC/AMOCC/AOC/PMRC will coordinate
the delivery of the burn team and their equipment to the originating facility and subsequent AE
airlift of the patient back to the burn center. In all cases, burn patients should be moved within 24
hours from the time of injury.
   6.1.1. Conditions requiring immediate transport and contact with the burn team, if the
   situation allows.
       6.1.1.1. Burns involving >10% total body surface (TBS) in children and adults over 50
       years old.
       6.1.1.2. All burns involving >20% TBS.
       6.1.1.3. Significant burns to the hands, face, genitalia or perineum.
       6.1.1.4. 3rd degree burns >5% TBS.
       6.1.1.5. Burns with inhalation injury requiring intubation.
       6.1.1.6. Burns with significant pre-existing medical disorders.
       6.1.1.7. Multiple trauma associated with burns.
       6.1.1.8. Significant electrical injury (including lighting).
       6.1.1.9. Chemical burns as follows: White phosphorus burns involving >5% TBS;
       vesicant gas involving >5% TBS, conjunctivae, or significant injury to airway.
6.2. Stresses of Flight.
   6.2.1. Decreased Partial Pressure: Exacerbates oxygenation deficiencies due to compromised
   respira- tion and/or the decreased partial pressure of oxygen in the presence of carbon
   monoxide poisoning.
   6.2.2. Barometric Pressure Changes: Increases gastric distention and discomfort.
   6.2.3. Humidity: Exacerbates fluid loss.
   6.2.4. Vibration: May increase pain.
   6.2.5. Thermal: Loss of natural insulation and skin integrity leaves the patient prone to
   hypothermia and pain. Severity of the burn affects the autonomic temperature regulatory
   functions and may increase oxygen demand.
   6.2.6. Fatigue: Exacerbates the patient’s underlying condition.
6.3. Preflight/In-Flight Considerations:
   6.3.1. Assessment/Treatment/Management.
50                                                                 AFI41-307 20 AUGUST 2003


  6.3.2. Airway: Secure early.
     6.3.2.1. Check for patency and be alert for: Tracheal edema and inhalation injury.
     6.3.2.2. Assess Signs & Symptoms of Inhalation Injury. NOTE: Inhalation injuries
     are at high risk for rapid airway obstruction; serious consideration should be given to
     intubation pretransport.
         6.3.2.2.1. Suspect in blasts and being confined in a burning environment. NOTE:
         Onset may be delayed and other injuries may not be apparent.
         6.3.2.2.2. Nasal/Mucosal charring.
         6.3.2.2.3. Burns and/or soot on face, in mouth and nose.
         6.3.2.2.4. Carbonaceous sputum.
         6.3.2.2.5. Hoarseness.
         6.3.2.2.6. Carbon monoxide poisoning symptoms include pink to cherry-red skin,
         tachycar- dia, tachypnea, headache, dizziness, and nausea; CNS symptoms vary with
         carboxyhemoglo- bin level. Refer to Medical Management for more in-depth
         information. WARNING: Pulse oximetry reading may not be accurate in carbon
         monoxide poisoning.
  6.3.3. Artificial Airways: Refer to Airway and Breathing Management for more in-depth
  informa- tion.
     6.3.3.1. Administer high flow O2 via cool mist to maintain pulse oximetry greater than
     91%.
     6.3.3.2. Secure tubes with ties or suture rather than tape.
  6.3.4. Fluid Loss/Resuscitation.
     6.3.4.1. IV access via 2 large bore (18 gauge or larger), if needed.
     6.3.4.2. First 24 Hours:
         6.3.4.2.1. The goal of initial fluid resuscitation is to restore and maintain adequate
         tissue per- fusion and vital organ function, in addition to preserving heat-injured but
         viable tissue. Fluid needs are based on the size of the patient and the extent of the
         burn. The two most common formulas for estimating fluid needs are the Parkland
         formula, (4 ml/kg/% BSA burned), and the Modified Brooke formula, (2 ml/kg/%
         BSA burned). These formulas have been combined and presented as the Consensus
         formula of 2 to 4 ml/kg/% BSA burned. NOTE: All of the for- mulas call for one-half
         of the total amount to be infused over the first 8 hours from the time of the injury, and
         the second half infused over the following 16 hours.
     6.3.4.3. Urinary Output: Determines the adequacy of renal perfusion and fluid
     resuscitation.
         6.3.4.3.1. Adult hourly output is maintained between 30 to 50 ml.
            6.3.4.3.1.1. With electrical burns, maintain output at 75-100cc/hr to prevent
            buildup of myoglobin in the kidneys. NOTE: Urine will be rusty red in color.
AFI41-307 20 AUGUST 2003                                                                       51


          6.3.4.3.2. Children, under 30 kg, hourly output is maintained at 1 to 2 ml/kg/% BSA
          burned.
NOTE: Patients with 20% TBS or more, excluding first-degree burns, should have an IV, NG,
and Foley catheter in place during all phases of AE.
   6.3.5. Dressings: Refer to Infection Control and Wound Management for more in-depth
   information.
       6.3.5.1. Ensure burns are dressed with clean, dry, non-constrictive, bulky dressings.
       6.3.5.2. Cover dressings with clean linens to help decrease pain from air currents and
       prevent gross contamination during transport.
       6.3.5.3. Cover sheets with “space” blankets and clean blankets or sleeping bags for
       temperature control. NOTE: Do not change dressings in-flight; reinforce only.
   6.3.6. Antacid therapy, as directed.
6.4. Cardiac Monitoring: For patients with cardiac history, hypertension, electrical burns, and
patients over 50 years of age.
6.5. Circulation Checks: (All extremities). Refer to Musculo-Skeletal Management for more
in-depth information.
6.6. Mental Status: Key indicator of hypoxia and cardiovascular stability. Perform
neurovascular assessments frequently.
   6.6.1. Treat hypoxia from shock, carbon monoxide poisoning, sepsis or the effects of
   altitude.
6.7. Temperature Control: Extremely prone to hypothermia. Monitor temperature and
maintain a high temperature in the cabin, if possible.
6.8. Positioning and Exercise:
   6.8.1. Essential to promote circulation and provide comfort and prevents contractures,
   pressure sores, thrombosis, and conversion of burns.
   6.8.2. Maintain the position of function (i.e.; hands, joints, and feet).
       6.8.2.1. Elevate upper torso: Assists cerebral venous return, slows down edema
       formation, and assists respiratory functions by reducing diaphragm crowding.
       6.8.2.2. Elevate extremities: Reduces edema, increases venous return, and reduces pain.
6.9. Narcotics/Analgesics:
   6.9.1. Used for both sedation and pain relief. Administered in frequent small-titrated dosages
   via IV.

                                              Chapter 7

                              IV THERAPY/ DRUG MANAGEMENT

7.1. Intravenous (IV) Therapy.
   7.1.1. Stresses of Flight.
         7.1.1.1. Barometric Pressure Changes: Air expansion at altitude may cause some IV rates
         to fluc- tuate. The rate of ascent/descent varies with different aircraft, so does the rate and
         flow of IV fluid. Pressures are constantly changing due to en route stops, weather
         conditions, and capabilities of the aircraft pressurization system.
            7.1.1.1.1. Situations potentially dangerous to a patient are a sudden surge of fluid,
            unregulated flow to the patient, and air bubbles in the administration tubing.
   7.1.2. Critical Area of Consideration: Accurate administration of IV therapy poses one of
   the greatest concerns in-flight. Drip rates will be reevaluated once cruise altitude is reached,
   frequently throughout the flight, after descent and after a rapid decompression. NOTE:
   “Dial-a-flows” will not be used to regulate IV rates in-flight.
      7.1.3. IV Containers.
         7.1.3.1. Plastic IV Containers: Plastic solution containers are preferred for in-flight use
         because they are easy to handle and secure, do not break, and expand/contract with
         changes in barometric pressure without venting.
         7.1.3.2. Glass IV Containers: Not routinely used in today’s medical environment.
         However, there may be some instances where medication/fluids in glass containers will
         be infused in-flight. IV glass bottles without integral venting rods do not allow for the
         escape of expanding air. The expan- sion of air will force the fluid out of the bottle or the
         IV will not drip at all. NOTE: Do not use glass bottles without venting them.
         7.1.3.3. Venting Procedures: Any rigid plastic or glass IV bottle requiring venting is
         done utiliz- ing aseptic technique.
            7.1.3.3.1. Insert an 18-gauge needle through the bottle cap into the lumen of the
            integral air rod of the bottle.
            7.1.3.3.2. Remove the cap from the air vent on the drip set and insert a sterile 2 cc
            syringe into the vent.
            7.1.3.3.3. Secure the syringe and plunger into the vent by running a strip of tape over
            the plunger of the syringe and around the neck of the IV bottle. As the air of the bottle
            expands it leaves via the needle inserted into the air rod; the syringe acts as a plug,
            held in place by the tape, and prevents fluid from pouring out of the bottle.
            7.1.3.3.4. Non-Vented Drip Sets: When non-vented drip sets are used, it is necessary
            to insert a needle only into the integral air rod of the IV bottle.
            7.1.3.3.5. Volutrole (Metered Drip Sets Constructed of Pliable Plastic): The meter
            chamber is filled and clamped off between the bottle and the chamber. (Since the
            meter chamber collapses as it empties, air does not enter or expand in the chamber).
AFI41-307 20 AUGUST 2003                                                                      53


         7.1.3.3.6. Metered Drip Sets Constructed of Rigid Plastic: Systems with air vents in
         the metering section of the drip set allow air in the tubing during rapid decompression
         and will not be used.
  7.1.4. Additional Fluid Therapy Techniques.
     7.1.4.1. Arterial and Hemodynamic Lines. Fluid chamber must be completely filled
     with fluid to prevent the possibility of air in the line during patient movement. High-
     pressure tubing must be used with all invasive hemodynamic lines.
     7.1.4.2. Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN). Patient routing should be as short and
     direct as pos- sible. NOTE: TPN must be refrigerated en route.
     7.1.4.3. An order for TPN or D10W is written on the AF Form 3899/DD Form 602/DD
     Form 1380 and includes quantity, frequency, rate, and lab studies required at RON
     MTFs. NOTE: D10W may be used en route if TPN solution is not available.
  7.1.5. Preflight/In-flight Considerations for IV Therapy.
     7.1.5.1. Document the IV start time, site, catheter gauge, and the last dressing change, if
     known.
     7.1.5.2. Label IV bag with solution, date, start and stop times and initials. Do not use
     markers because they are absorbed into the plastic bag.
     7.1.5.3. Infusion Pumps will be used for heparin, cardiac and vasoactive medications,
     neonatal/pediatric patients, and TPN. Refer to AFI 41-309, AE Equipment Standards.
     7.1.5.4. Ensure line is patent.
     7.1.5.5. Assess insertion site and evaluate for infection/irritation: Redness/red streaks at
     insertion site, warmth, edema, purulence/drainage, and pain.
     7.1.5.6. Ensure patient has enough IVs, medications, and supplies to reach the
     destination facility.
         7.1.5.6.1. When patient medical supplies and patient movement items (PMI) are
         coordinated with the AE system in advance, most items will be provided from the AE
         staging base. With- out advance coordination, the originating facility will be
         responsible for providing these items and should provide a 1-day minimum of
         supplies, except for patient movement from theater to CONUS and within CONUS
         where a 3-day minimum should be provided.
     7.1.5.7. Patients receiving TPN require glucose monitoring. WARNING: Currently,
     there is no glucose monitor or chemstrip on the approved basic AECM in-flight medical
     equipment list. In-flight glucose monitoring may not be accurate due to barometric
     changes, and requires close observation of objective and subjective signs of
     hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia. When avail- able, assist the patient and/or family in
     utilizing the patient’s or the originating facility’s monitor at en route stops; MTFs at RON
     destinations will perform quality testing of glucose monitors just prior to the patient’s
     departure to the flightline. NOTE 1: If the patient or family is unfamiliar with the glucose
     monitor, the originating facility will provide training to ensure the AECMs are knowl-
     edgeable and proficient on the use of the glucose monitor prior to takeoff. NOTE 2: The
 54                                                               AFI41-307 20 AUGUST 2003


      CCATT equipment package may include an ISTAT that is capable of in-flight glucose
      monitoring.
      7.1.5.8. Place patients receiving IV therapy in the middle to low tier to facilitate IV flow,
      if possi- ble.
      7.1.5.9. After a Rapid Decompression, the following difficulties may be encountered:
      Bags/bot- tles break, drip sets pop out, blood backs up into tubing, and excessive air and
      fluid is forced into patient.
          7.1.5.9.1. AECM Action Following a Rapid Decompression: Clamp tubing, check
          infusion site, bottle or bag, infusion pump (if applicable), and tubing. Assess for signs
          and symptoms of infiltration. Clear the tubing of air and resume infusion if not clotted
          or infiltrated
7.2. Administration of Medication.
   7.2.1. General Information. Administer medications in-flight on the same schedule as in the
   originat- ing MTF, or as near as possible. The goal of administering any type of medication
   or treatment in the AE system is to maintain the continuity of care from the originating MTF
   to the destination MTF without significant delays. Drug administration time may be adjusted
   to the destination time zone, if there are no contraindications.
   7.2.2. Documentation: : Includes patient assessment, complaint, pain control management,
   pertinent past treatment/medication, allergies, medication dose, time administered, other
   interventions or mea- sures used, results of treatment.
NOTE: Use AF IMT 3899I Patient Movement Medication Record. Document all medication
adminis- tration times in ZULU.
7.3. Controlled Drugs.
   7.3.1. A controlled drug accepted by the healthcare provider becomes his/her responsibility
   for accountability, control, safeguarding, and disposition.
      7.3.1.1. AF IMT 579, Controlled Substance Register. Mandatory for unit accountability
      and doc- umentation of all narcotic inventories. Completed at change of
      shift/beginning/end of every mis- sion and when accessed for patient use.
   7.3.2. When controlled drugs are brought onboard the aircraft, the MCD and MTF
   representative together will complete an inventory.
      7.3.2.1. The name and quantity of drugs are noted and signed for on the AF IMT 3899A,
      (Front) Controlled Drug Accountability (Refer to Table 1.1.). If these drugs are returned
      to the MTF, the representative and MCD must annotate the AF IMT 3899A with the
      statement “Refused and Returned,” and both persons sign the form.
   7.3.3. Prescribed controlled drugs entrusted to a patient/attendant are considered to be the
   property of the individual, who is then responsible for safeguarding and administering the
   drug(s). FNs will deter- mine if the patient or attendant is competent to safely manage these
   drugs.
   7.3.4. All controlled substances will accompany the patient to the destination MTF.
AFI41-307 20 AUGUST 2003                                                                       55


   7.3.5. Upon termination of the mission, all unaccompanied/unserviceable controlled drugs
   are docu- mented on the AF Form 3859, Turn-In of Unaccompanied Narcotics, and turned
   into the drug room for disposition per local policy. Annotate AF Form 3829.
   7.3.6. If off loaded at the incorrect MTF, notify TACC/AMOCC/AOC/PMRC for immediate
   track- ing.
   7.3.7. Drugs Missing/Unaccounted For.
       7.3.7.1. As soon as the FN realizes that controlled drugs are missing, report the loss
       immediately to the aircraft commander.
       7.3.7.2. As soon as possible, the FN makes a written statement or affidavit documenting
       the cir- cumstances surrounding the loss, type, and quantities of drugs missing. If
       possible, obtain written statements or affidavits from any persons having knowledge of
       the circumstances surrounding the loss. Send documents to the Drug Room manager and
       the PMRC medical director.
       7.3.7.3. If the FN suspects drugs were stolen by person(s) onboard the aircraft, the
       aircraft com- mander should notify the Office of Special Investigations or the security
       police upon landing at the first military airfield. Keep all persons onboard the aircraft
       until an investigation is accomplished.
          7.3.7.3.1. If the drugs are still not located, the FN should prepare statements or
          affidavits stat- ing actions taken and results for the investigating agency. Complete
          DD Form 2852.
7.4. Administration of Medication According to Established Protocols. In emergency
situations, the FN initiates care based on individual competency, level of knowledge and skill.
Refer to the current edi- tion of the “Nursing Drug Handbook or Physicians’ Desk Reference.”
NOTE 1: The medications described in the related chapters/attachments of this AFI may be
administered one time, unless otherwise stated, by a “trained and competent” FN. Once treatment
is started, concur- rently contact the TACC/AMOCC/AOC/PMRC for further physician orders
and for guidance and possi- ble diversion to a MTF capable of handling the situation.

NOTE 2: Follow the most current ACLS guidelines for cardiac arrest.

NOTE 3: Unless contraindicated, administer IV medications rapidly followed by an immediate
20-30cc bolus of IV fluid and elevate the extremity.
   7.4.1. Documentation will include subjective and objective data for giving the medication;
   vital signs, if indicated; known allergies; for women of childbearing years: date of last
   menstrual cycle; date and time of administration and notification of a physician, and the
   outcome. The following state- ment will be documented on AF Form 3899/DD Form 602/DD

                                  MEDICAL MANAGEMENT

8.1. Cardiac Management.
   8.1.1. Stresses Of Flight.
       8.1.1.1. Decreased Partial Pressure of Oxygen: Increases myocardial workload,
       predisposing compromised patients to arrhythmias, chest pain and may lead to
       myocardial infarction. Consider cabin altitude less than 6000 ft for cardiac patients.
       8.1.1.2. Barometric Pressure Changes: Gas expansion in the GI tract may cause
       diaphragmatic crowding and decrease in tidal volume.
       8.1.1.3. Thermal: Excessive heat may cause patients on cardiac medication to become
       hypoten- sive. Hyperthermia and hypothermia may increase cardiac oxygen
       requirements.
       8.1.1.4. Fatigue: Cumulative effect of stresses may exacerbate the patient’s condition.
       8.1.1.5. G-Forces: Takeoff may increase returning blood flow and cardiac workload for
       some car- diac patients. Use a backrest for cardiac patients on a litter.
8.2. Preflight/ In-Flight Considerations for Cardiac Patients.
   8.2.1. Patients with a recent acute myocardial infarction (AMI) are considered for AE on an
   individual basis. Consultation between the referring physician and the validating flight
   surgeon is the foundation for developing a safe movement care plan for all patients. When
   continuous cardiac monitoring or other critical care modalities are required, the validating
   flight surgeon, in consultation with the referring physician, shall determine if a CCAT team,
   or medical attendants such as a physician, or ACLS trained nurse will accompany the patient.
   The referring physician and validating flight surgeon will work together to determine the
   appropriate AE timeframe and clinical support for cardiac patients. The final decision for
   determining these requirements rests with the validating flight surgeon. A 12-Lead EKG
   tracing taken within 24 hours of scheduled flight and read by a qualified physician should
   accompany the patient.
   8.2.2. Patient History.
       8.2.2.1. Assess if patient is free of chest pain; the last episode of chest pain and if it was
       associ- ated with shortness of breath (SOB), nausea and diaphoresis, and what actions
       and/or medications are used to relieve pain. Identify other current medications (some
       cardiac medications induce hypotension), and the presence of a pacemaker or implantable
       cardioverter-defibrillator.
   8.2.3. Assess ability to ambulate for prolonged periods and climb stairs.
   8.2.4. Assure Nitroglycerin and other medications are available prior to takeoff.
   8.2.5. All inpatient cardiac patients should have preflight vital signs and pulse oximetry;
   repeat pulse oximetry at altitude.
   8.2.6. Use a backrest if on litter.
 58                                                               AFI41-307 20 AUGUST 2003


   8.2.7. Place near O2 for flight.
   8.2.8. WARNING: Electromagnetic interference (EMI) from handheld and stationary
   surveillance systems interferes with implantable cardiac pacemakers and implantable
   cardioverter-defibrillators (ICD). Changes in pacing rates, shock, and possible cardiac arrest
   may occur. Use alternate anti-hijacking procedures for patients and passengers with these
   medical devices. In-flight Adult ACLS. Notify TACC/AMOCC/AOC/PMRC. NOTE:
   Assess the airway, breathing, circu- lation, mental status, and the possible causes for
   symptoms. Secure the airway and have monitor/defibril- lator available. Perform cardio-
   pulmonary resuscitation (CPR), if indicated. All patients suspected to be symptomatic, at
   high risk or unstable will be placed on high flow O2 (Refer to Table 4.1.), have an IV access
   with a large bore IV catheter, and placed on the cardiac monitor and a pulse oximeter. Attach
   EKG strips to document rhythm on DD Form 602, 1380, AF Forms 3829 and 3899.
   WARNING: Treat the patient, not the monitor. An adequate airway, ventilation,
   oxygenation, chest compressions and defibrilla- tion take priority over obtaining IV access
   and administering medications.
8.3. Cardiac Emergencies/Cardiac Arrest: Refer to current ACLS Guidelines and
Attachment 13, In-flight Adult ACLS. Notify TACC/AMOCC/AOC/PMRC. NOTE: Assess the
airway, breathing, circulation, mental status, and the possible causes for symptoms. Secure the
airway and have monitor/defibrillator available. Perform cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR),
if indicated. All patients suspected to be symptomatic, at high risk or unstable will be placed on
high flow O2 (Refer to Table 4.1), have an IV access with a large bore IV catheter, and placed
on the cardiac monitor and a pulse oximeter. Attach EKG strips to document rhythm on DD
Form 602, 1380, AF Forms 3829 and 3899. WARNING: Treat the patient, not the monitor. An
adequate airway, ventilation, oxygenation, chest compressions and defibrillation take priority
over obtaining IV access and administering medications.
      8.3.1. Ischemic Chest Pain. Refer to Attachment 4.
   8.3.2. Congestive Heart Failure/Cardiogenic Shock: Pump failure that may result from a
   MI, val- vular malfunction, septal defect, left ventricular aneurysem or cardiac trauma.
         8.3.2.1. Assess cardiopulonary, neurological and hemodynamic status - BP, HR, pulse
         oximetry, GCS, peripheral perfusion, presence of edema, color, and warmth of skin.
            8.3.2.1.1. Signs and Symptoms: Anxiety. Dyspnea/shortness of breath with rales and
            rhonchi. Distended neck veins, tachycardia, hypertension or hypotension (cardiogenic
            shock). Dia- phoresis, arrhythmias. Appears ashen, with cool and clammy skin.
         8.3.2.2. Treatment/Management. Refer to paragraph 8.3 and Table 4.1
            8.3.2.2.1. Cardiac monitor.
            8.3.2.2.2. Strict I & O.
         8.3.2.3. Contact TACC/AMOCC/AOC/PMRC for guidance and possible diversion to a
         MTF capable of handling the situation. The physician may order Furosemide IV,
         Morphine IV, Nitro- glycerin SL, and if hypotensive, a vasopressor.
   8.3.3. Cardiac Tamponade. Rapid or slow accumulation of fluid into pericardial sac
   compresses the heart and decreases cardiac output. Results from inflammation, traumatic
   wound injury to heart, heart failure, cardiac contusion, neoplasm, and aortic dissection.
AFI41-307 20 AUGUST 2003                                                                       59


     8.3.3.1. Assess Signs & Symptoms: Beck’s Triad: high venous pressure - distended neck
     veins, low arterial pressure and distant/muffled heart sounds. Dyspnea, tachypnea,
     cyanosis, tachycardia, hypotension, and severe anxiety. QRS may have smaller
     amplitude.
     8.3.3.2. Treatment/Management: Refer to 8.3 and to current ACLS Guidelines.
        8.3.3.2.1. Avoid positive pressure ventilation via bag-mask or ET tube. The
        physician may order a fluid challenge.
        8.3.3.2.2. The only treatment that alleviates the cause is pericardiocentesis.
        WARNING: This procedure will only be performed by highly trained healthcare
        professionals.
  8.3.4. Symptomatic Premature Ventricular Contractions (PVCs) and Tachycardia,
  Symptom- atic Bradycardia, and Cardiac Arrest. Refer to current ACLS guidelines for
  drug indications, actions and precautions.
     8.3.4.1. Symptomatic Premature Ventricular Contractions (PVCs) and Ventricular
     Tachy- cardia (VT). Refer to current ACLS Guidelines.
        8.3.4.1.1. Presence of multi-focal and/or frequent PVCs, and VT, in conjunction with
        chest pain, SOB, low BP, change in mental status, shock, pulmonary congestion,
        congestive heart failure and acute MI.
     8.3.4.2. Symptomatic Bradycardia. Refer to current ACLS Guidelines.
        8.3.4.2.1. Signs and symptoms: Low BP, pulmonary congestion, SOB, chest pain,
        and decreased level of consciousness, shock, pulmonary congestion, congestive heart
        failure and acute MI.
            8.3.4.2.1.1. A pulse rate, relative to the blood pressure, is too low. An example is
            a heart rate of 65 and a BP of 80/50.
        8.3.4.2.2. Consider transcutaneous pacing (TCP) with AE approved Cardiac Monitor/
        Defibrillator. FNs may initiate pacing IAW current ACLS Guidelines and will contact
        Com- mand and Control (C2) for mission diversion and physician guidance and
        sedation and pain medication prior to starting TCP. NOTE: TCP is used for short
        intervals until transvenous pac- ing can be initiated (with appropriate equipment
        waiver via HQ AMC/A3/VM for in-flight use).
        8.3.4.2.3. En route adult transvenous pacing requires direct CCATT or physician
        supervision IAW the PMRC VFS and the tasked unit Chief Nurse Executive (CNE)
        for appropriate medi- cal crew complement.
        8.3.4.2.4. All pediatric patients requiring en route transvenous or transcutaneous
        pacing require direct physician supervision.
     8.3.4.3. Ventricular         Fibrillation/Pulseless         Ventricular          Tachycardia
     (VF/VT). NOTE 1 : Fol- low current ACLS guidelines for defibrillation. NOTE 2:
     Place a blanket or a long cardiac board underneath the patient for protection and the even
     distribution of the delivered current while defibrillating on the floor of the aircraft. NOTE
     3: All types of litters may be used during defibril- lation as long as safety precautions are
     followed.

       8.3.4.4. Asystole and Pulseless Electrical Activity (PEA). Follow current ACLS
       guidelines.
          8.3.4.4.1. Consider and treat the possible causes: hypovolemia (volume infusion);
          hypoxia (ventilate); tension pneumothorax (needle decompression); drug overdose
          (tricyclics, digitalis, B-blockers, calcium channel blockers, narcotics); hyperkalemia;
          numerous blood transfusions; cardiac tamponade, pulmonary embolism, and acidosis.
8.4. Blood Dyscrasia. Affects one or more of the blood components, the bone marrow or the
entire blood system. It can be acute or chronic, acquired or congenital. Seen in chemotherapy,
post-transplant, post-trauma, renal and liver disease. Refer to Lippincott.
   8.4.1. Stresses of Flight.
       8.4.1.1. Decreased Partial Pressure of Oxygen: Exacerbates the body’s decreased oxygen
       trans- port capability in the blood leading to hypoxia and cardiac decompensation.
       8.4.1.2. Thermal: Hot and cold temperatures increases the body’s oxygen requirements.
       8.4.1.3. Decreased Humidity: Dehydration causes headaches and decreases blood
       volume.
       8.4.1.4. Fatigue: Complicates the underlying pathology.
   8.4.2. Red Blood Cells (RBCs): Transport oxygen and carbon dioxide. The efficiency of
   RBCs depends on the quantity and quality of the hemoglobin it contains. Normal hemoglobin
   concentration is 14-16 g per 100cc, and varies with the patient’s sex and age.
       8.4.2.1. Patients with hemoglobin below 8.0 mg may be transported if the condition is
       chronic and stable, and not related to bleeding. Patients with a hematocrit below 25% are
       not airlifted without concurrence of the Validating Flight Surgeon (VFS). Low flow O2 is
       used continuously on patients with extremely low hemoglobin or hematocrit levels, as in
       dialysis and chemotherapy patients. An altitude restriction below 5000 feet may be
       ordered by the VFS. Refer to Table 8.1
          8.4.2.1.1. Types of Anemias.
              8.4.2.1.1.1. Hemolytic: Destruction of erythrocytes by bacteria, parasites, venom,
              transfu- sions, chemicals, and genetics (thalassemia and sickle cell – sickling can
              occur at cabin altitudes as low as 4000 ft).
              8.4.2.1.1.2. Aplastic: Failure of the bone morrow to produce erythrocytes due to
              chemi- cals, drugs and disease.
   8.4.3. White Blood Cells (WBCs or leukocytes): The main function of leukocytes is to
   isolate areas of inflammation or infection. Normal adult blood contains 5,000-10,000 WBCs
   per cubic centimeter of whole blood.
       8.4.3.1. Leukocyte Disorders.
          8.4.3.1.1. Caused by abnormal WBCs (too few, too many or abnormal morphology).
          8.4.3.1.2. Monitor pre-flight absolute neutrophil count (ANC) and en route
          temperature. ANC below 1000 is considered neutropenic and at risk for infection;
          below 500 is a severe risk for infection and for flight. Monitor temperature every four
AFI41-307 20 AUGUST 2003                                                                            61


          hours. Temperature above 100.4 F is considered significant; above 101.0 F requires
          antibiotics, usually gentamycin or vancomycin.
              8.4.3.1.2.1. Results in low resistance to gram-negative organisms. Use good hand
              wash- ing, protective isolation with the patient wearing a N95 mask, and no fresh
              fruits or black pepper (contains high levels of gram negative bacteria).
   8.4.4. Platelets (thrombocytes).
       8.4.4.1. Thrombocytopenia: observe for bruising, uncontrolled bleeding, petechiae,
       hematuria, hemotomas, and GI bleeding. Normal platelet count is greater than 150,000.
       8.4.4.2. Avoid aspirin and non-steriodal anti-inflammatory drugs that may interfere with
       platelet function.
   8.4.5. Preflight/In-flight Nursing Care for Blood Dyscrasias.
       8.4.5.1. Oxygen administration as needed. Refer to Table 8.1 and Table 4.1

Table 8.1. Guidelines to Determine Oxygen Requirements.




NOTE: These parameters are based on hemoglobin because hematocrit may be decreased or
elevated in dehydration or fluid overload.
       8.4.5.2. Litter with backrest.
       8.4.5.3. Offer blankets; patients with anemias tend to have a greater sensitivity to cold.
       8.4.5.4. Offer fluids often to avoid headaches and decreased blood volume.
       8.4.5.5. Administer blood products, as ordered. AF Form 1225, Informed Consent for
       Blood Transfusion, signed if feasible.
       8.4.5.6. Use Standard and Transmission Based Precautions. Refer to Infection Control
       for more in-depth information.
8.5. Diabetes Mellitus. Refer to Lippincott.
   8.5.1. Stresses of Flight.
       8.5.1.1. Decreased Partial Pressure of Oxygen: Diabetic retinopathy and peripheral
       vascular symptoms may be exacerbated.

       8.5.1.2. Decreased Humidity: Leads to dehydration.
       8.5.1.3. Thermal: May contribute to poor circulation, exacerbating sensitivity.
       8.5.1.4. Fatigue: May precipitate/exacerbate condition.
   8.5.2. Preflight/In-flight Considerations for Diabetes Mellitus.
       8.5.2.1. Ascertain time of last meal.
       8.5.2.2. Type, time and amount of hypoglycemic medication.
       8.5.2.3. Assure medications and special diet are onboard and available.
       8.5.2.4. Ensure meal is served on time. Observe for objective and subjective signs of
       hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia. MTFs at RON locations will test blood glucose just
       prior to the patient’s departure to the flight line. Although glucose monitors are not
       included in the AE allowance standard, use of a glucose monitor approved for in-flight
       use is authorized. AECMs should be prepared to assist patients and/or attendants in
       performing blood glucose checks using an approved monitor on the ground and in the air.
       A current listing of blood glucose monitors approved for in-flight use can be found on the
       Air     Force     Medical     Equipment     Development       Laboratory     website    at
       ttps://medlog.detrick.af.mil/mlc/site_apps/clineng/afmedl/.
       8.5.2.5. Hyperglycemia. Early: polydipsia, polyuria, fatigue, nausea, vomiting,
       abdominal pain and cramps; dry, warm, flushed skin. Later: Kussmaul respiration, fruity,
       sweet breath, hypoten- sion, stupor and coma.
          8.5.2.5.1. Treatment/Management. Insulin and IV fluids as directed by a physician.
       8.5.2.6. Hypoglycemia (potentially life-threatening). Refer to Attachment 8.
8.6. Decompression Sickness: Caused by the evolution of free gas bubbles from the tissues and
fluids of the body as a result of marked decreases in barometric pressure. Nitrogen, a
metabolically inert gas, is pri- marily involved. Nitrogen behaves predictably according to
Henry’s Law: evolves in a manner similar to the formation of bubbles in a bottle of carbonated
beverages when the cap is removed. Refer to Flight Physiology for more in-depth information.
   8.6.1. Stresses of Flight.
       8.6.1.1. Decreased Partial Pressure of Oxygen: Exacerbates existing hypoxia.
       8.6.1.2. Barometric Pressure Changes: Nitrogen escapes and exacerbates symptoms.
       8.6.1.3. Noise, Thermal Changes, Vibration, and Fatigue: Exacerbates underlying
       pathology
   8.6.2. Symptoms of Decompression Sickness. There is no regular sequence, and it is
   possible to exhibit various symptoms simultaneously.
       8.6.2.1. Skin: itching, tingling, cold or warm sensations, and occasionally a mottled rash
       – the “Creeps”.
       8.6.2.2. Joints: pain in or around the body joints – the “Bends.” More commonly, the
       larger joints of the elbows, shoulders, knees, and ankles are involved.
AFI41-307 20 AUGUST 2003                                                                      63


      8.6.2.3. Respiratory: deep and sharp sub-sternal pain, dry progressive cough, and a
      feeling of suf- focation – the “Chokes.”
      8.6.2.4. Central Nervous System (CNS): Most Dangerous. Includes muscular weakness,
      head- ache, visual impairment, speech difficulties, mental confusion, bowel and bladder
      dysfunction, paralysis, and coma – the “Staggers”.
   8.6.3. Preflight/ In-flight Considerations En Route to the Hyperbaric (Decompression)
   Cham- ber. (May also apply to individuals with carbon monoxide poisoning, gas gangrene,
   or extensive wound infections).
      8.6.3.1. Requires continuous 100% O2 via a tight fitting mask, unless otherwise ordered.
      Follow local guidance if the Bends Kit (12P Crew Mask with extension hose, and a high
      pressure O2 line) is utilized.
      8.6.3.2. Requires destination field altitude as the MCA (recommended) en route.
      8.6.3.3. Immobilize joints and maintain complete bedrest, unless otherwise ordered.
      8.6.3.4. Trendelenberg position increases cerebral edema and ischemia, and is
      contraindicated.
      8.6.3.5. May have an IV to maintain hydration.
      8.6.3.6. The use of narcotics may mask CNS symptoms.
      8.6.3.7. A potential in-flight hazard any time cabin pressurization is lost. Any individual
      experi- encing symptoms during flight needs prompt treatment. Suspect if individual has
      been Scuba div- ing within the last 24 hours.
         8.6.3.7.1. Administer 100% O2 and immobilize the painful area. Refer to Table 4.1
         8.6.3.7.2. Request a lower cabin altitude and notify TACC/AMOCC/AOC/PMRC
         PMRC for guidance and possible diversion to a MTF capable of handling the
         situation, as required.
         8.6.3.7.3. Must be evaluated by a flight surgeon even if the symptoms disappear
         during descent.
8.7. Unconscious/Known or Suspected Narcotic Overdose. Refer to Attachment 11.

                              NEUROLOGICAL MANAGEMENT

9.1. Stresses Of Flight.
   9.1.1. Decreased Partial Pressure of Oxygen: Lower levels of O2 causes brain cell and tissue
   ischemia and ultimately death, and produces cerebral edema and increased intracranial
   pressure (ICP) which leads to hypoventilation and further hypoxemia. NOTE: One hypoxic
   episode in the presence of TBI may lead to a catastrophic secondary brain injury.
   9.1.2. Barometric Pressure Changes: Penetrating head injuries, skull fractures and severe
   facial frac- tures may produce air in the cranium, causing increased ICP. The potential for ear
   block exists in those patients who have a decreased level of consciousness, inability to follow
   directions or a physical dis- ability. Valsalva increases ICP. NOTE: An altitude restriction
   minimizes the stresses of barometric pressure changes and decreased partial pressure of
   oxygen.
      9.1.3. Vibration: May cause motion sickness and vomiting, thus increasing ICP.
   9.1.4. Thermal Changes: A consideration for patients with hypothalamus involvement.
   9.1.5. Decreased Humidity: Will dry the corneas of patients with decreased corneal/blink
   reflex, and increase dehydration and headaches.
   9.1.6. G-Forces: Takeoff may increase ICP and bleeding for litter patients or decrease
   cerebral blood flow to ambulatory patients. Litter patients are secured and padded on a
   backrest (if not contraindi- cated) with the head mid-line. NOTE: Physician determines head
   aft or forward litter positioning for flight.
9.2. Types of Head Injuries/Degenerative Diseases
   9.2.1. Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). Mechanism of Injury: Acceleration/deceleration,
   penetrating/non-penetrating forces from an explo- sion/over pressurized blast wave (the
   speed of sound), fall, direct impact, or motor vehicle/aircraft crash. For more detailed
   information see: http://www.pdhealth.mil/TBI.asp#cg.
         9.2.1.1. Penetrating TBI is typically identified and cared for immediately. TBI does not
         cause “shock.”
         9.2.1.2. The treatment goals are to prevent the secondary brain injury and progressive
         damage from hypoxemia, hypotension, cerebral hypoxia and edema, and to recognize and
         to treat the early signs of intracranial hypertension or increasing ICP by maintaining an
         adequate airway, monitor- ing pupils, LOC and the GCS for sudden or subtle changes.
         (Refer to 3.3.7 and Table 3.1) NOTE: Baseline preflight assessment, including pulse
         oximetry is essential.
             9.2.1.2.1. Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) reflects the degree of systemic tissue
             hypoperfusion; maintain > 70 mm Hg (BP 90/60):
MAP = (Systolic BP – Diasystolic BP) + Diasystolic BP
                     3
AFI41-307 20 AUGUST 2003                                                                          65


           9.2.1.2.2. Cerebral Perfusion Pressure (CPP) is the pressure gradient that drives
           blood and nutrients into the brain. Normal range: > 70mmHg .
CPP= MAP-ICP
                 9.2.1.2.2.1. CPP is dependent upon:
                    9.2.1.2.2.1.1. Automatic/autoregulation dilation and constriction of the
                    cerebral blood vessels to maintain constant blood flow despite fluctuations in
                    the systemic blood pres- sure.
                    9.2.1.2.2.1.2. Systolic BP > 90 mmHg.
                    9.2.1.2.2.1.3. ICP < 20 mmHg.
NOTE: When ICP increases, the body attempts to perfuse the compressed brain tissue at all
cost. Hypotension in head injured patients can be catastrophic because cerebral blood vessels
cannot autoregu- late and therefore cannot constrict to preserve cerebral blood flow during
hypotension. When autoregula- tion is lost, massive cerebral vasodilation occurs, and secondarily
increases ICP

Table 9.1. Head Trauma Outcomes
 ICP (mmHg)                 CPP (mmHg) = MAP-ICP
 0-10 Normal                80-100 Average
 > 15-18 Treat              60 Possible Brain Ischemia
 > 40 Poor Prognosis        40 Irreversible Brain Ischemia
 > 60 Probably Fatal        30 Neuronal Cell Death

                    9.2.1.2.2.1.4. GCS Indicators
                    9.2.1.2.2.1.5. Moderate TBI = 9-13
                    9.2.1.2.2.1.6. Severe TBI = 3-8
   9.2.2. Immediate TBI Signs/Symptoms: alteration in mental status typically resulting in the
   tempo- rally related onset of: headache, nausea, vomiting, dizziness/balance, fatigue,
   insomnia/sleep distur- bances, drowsiness, sensitivity to light/ noise, blurred vision, difficulty
   remembering, and/or difficulty concentrating.
WARNING: mTBI may be missed, especially in the presence of other more obvious injuries
such as heat or toxic injury, hypovolemic shock/dehydration, eye and spinal injury, and acute
stress reactions.
   9.2.3. Military Acute Concussion Evaluation (MACE) Mandatory during the first 48
   hours for all individuals involved in an explosion/blast, fall, blow to the head and/or motor
   vehicle/aircraft crash who were dazed, confused, “saw stars” or lost consciousness (even
   momentarily) should be consid- ered to have suffered a concussion. See Table 9.3 Military
   Acute      Concussion       Evaluation    (MACE),        and      refer    to    http://www-

       9.2.3.1. Casualties displaying any of the “red flags” in Table 9.3 MACE “Red Flags”
       should be referred for additional medical evaluation as soon as operationally possible. If
       new symptoms occur before takeoff, the patient is not stable for flight, and needs to be
       cleared by a flight surgeon. Notify Theater PMRC, ASAP.
       9.2.3.2. If symptoms occur in-flight,               start     high        flow   O2;   contact
       TACC/AMOCC/AOC/PMRC for guidance.

         possible, posi- tion on side to prevent aspiration.
         9.6.4.2. Prepare to use suction, administer high flow O2, and assist respirations as
         required. Do not attempt to place a bite block while seizing.
         9.6.4.3. Observations to record during seizure: Any aura? Was rigidity superseded by
         jerks or convulsions; when did this occur? What part of the body started moving first? To
         what areas did the convulsion spread? In what order? Did the body change position
         during the seizure? Was there a chewing of the mouth and rolling of the eyes present? If
         the eyes where open, what did the pupils look like? Did they change in size? Together or
         individually? What was the respiratory pattern? What was the skin appearance? Flushed,
         ashen, and clammy? If unconscious, how much time elapsed before the patient regained
         consciousness? Did sleep follow? If so, how long? Incontinent of urine or feces?
      9.6.5. Treatment After a seizure (Post-Ictal).
         9.6.5.1. Maintain airway. Rule out hypoxia.
         9.6.5.2. Litter if needed.
         9.6.5.3. Obtain vital signs and pulse oximetry. Perform a detailed neuro assessment.

     9.6.5.4. Post Ictal (improving): Maintain seizure precautions and O2. Decrease stimuli as
     much as possible. Minimize the situation if there is a long-term history of seizures.
     Provide support, reas- surance and comfort.
     9.6.5.5. If Seizure Continues for More than Three Minutes or Restarts Without
     Regaining Consciousness. This is considered status epilepticus, a medical emergency.
     Medicate as directed and notify TACC/AMOCC/AOC/ PMRC for guidance and possible
     diversion to a MTF capable of handling the situation, as required. Refer to Attachment 9.

           MUSCULO-SKELETAL SYSTEM AND WOUND MANAGEMENT

10.1. Stresses Of Flight.
   10.1.1. Decreased Partial Pressure of Oxygen: Exacerbates the effects of hemorrhage, shock
   and low hemoglobin and hematocrit (H & H).
   10.1.2. Barometric Pressure Changes: May cause compartment syndrome if patient is in a
   cast or has recent internal injuries.
   10.1.3. Vibration: May affect alignment and/or positioning of set fractures, and increase
   pain.
   10.1.4. Humidity: May lead to dehydration predisposing individuals to deep vein thrombosis
   (DVT) and may also cause skin dryness over time, leading to itching under cast.
   10.1.5. Thermal: Changes of temperature may compromise circulation and increase pain;
   patient can sweat under cast on the flight line and then become cold at altitude.
10.2. Preflight/In-Flight Considerations.
   10.2.1. Assess and maintain ABCs.
   10.2.2. Neurovascular Assessment: Compare to unaffected extremity.
       10.2.2.1. Peripheral pulse qualities (proximal/distal to injury). Presence does not rule out
       injury; re-assess frequently and compare to unaffected extremity.
       10.2.2.2. Capillary refill less than 2 seconds is normal.
       10.2.2.3. Presence of edema. Remove constricting items above and below the injury
       (rings and watches).
       10.2.2.4. Color and temperature.
       10.2.2.5. Motor function.
       10.2.2.6. Sensation: compare to unaffected anatomical site.
       10.2.2.7. Reassess after position change and immobilization.
       10.2.2.8. Instruct the patient to report any pain and motor sensory changes (tingling,
       numbness, and pain).
WARNING: Sitting in cramped conditions for a long period of time, and/or injury and infection
may lead to a DVT or a blood clot deep in the tissues of the calves or groin. DVT may lead to a
pulmonary embolus and even death. Symptoms include pain in the calf or behind the knee that
may increase with standing or ambulating, the feeling of being on pins and needles, swelling, and
warmth or skin discoloration. Encour- age fluids, ambulating, as well as stretching and flexing of
calf muscles. If symptoms appear, refer to paragraph 4.6.7. Pulmonary Embolism.
       10.2.2.9. Compartment Syndrome: The compromise of neurovascular viability due to
       swelling of, or bleeding into tissues encased within the fascial sheath of extremity.
AFI41-307 20 AUGUST 2003                                                                       73


       Caused by open/closed fractures, external fixation/skeletal devices, compression/crushing
       injuries or constrictive ban- dages/casts.
          10.2.2.9.1. Assess for Signs and Symptoms: edema, pulseless, pallor, parethesia,
          paralysis, pain, firmness, and cyanosis.
          10.2.2.9.2. Treatment/Management.
              10.2.2.9.2.1. Remove constrictive dressings, bivalve cast, bandage and re-apply.
              10.2.2.9.2.2. Elevate the extremity.
              10.2.2.9.2.3. Administer pain medication after assessment. NOTE: Frequently
              assess ade- quacy of pain control measures.
10.3. Disability/Immobilization.
   10.3.1. Spinal Cord Injuries: Refer to Neurological Management.
   10.3.2. Amputation: control bleeding and pain.
   10.3.3. Pelvic Fractures: complete bedrest. May have external fixation devices. Refer to
   paragraph 4.8.7. Pulmonary/Fat Embolism.
   10.3.4. Application of Splints/Aces/Kerlix:
       10.3.4.1. Proper splint placement: the joint above and the joint below the injury.
       10.3.4.2. Proper alignment: in the position of function.
       10.3.4.3. Security of splint/ace. Re-wrap if too tight or too loose. NOTE: Air Splints: air
       expands at altitude. Requires close observation and adjustments during ascent, at altitude
       and descent, and should not be used in-flight if alternate splinting devices are available.
10.4. Wound Management.
   10.4.1. All combat wounds are considered contaminated and will not be closed initially.
   10.4.2. Obvious injuries associated with air pressure changes of severe blasts may also have
   myocar- dial, pulmonary, and intestinal contusions or shearing injuries.
   10.4.3. Note type and amount of drainage on dressings. On the aircraft, dressings will not be
   changed; reinforce only.
   10.4.4. Any wound associated with a fracture must be managed as if it were an open fracture
   and treatment should be started within eight hours. This includes debridement and IV
   antibiotics prior to flight.
   10.4.5. Observe for increased temperature, erythemia (redness) at wound site, swelling, and
   presence of drains (note amount, color and location).
   10.4.6. Do not remove impaled objects - stabilize.
   10.4.7. Do not attempt to replace eviscerated bowel. Cover with a moist sterile occlusive
   saline dress- ing and insulate to prevent hypothermia.
   10.4.8. Control bleeding with direct pressure, elevation, and pressure points.
 74                                                                AFI41-307 20 AUGUST 2003


   10.4.9. The use of tourniquets to control bleeding is not recommended unless there are no
   other options.
   10.4.10. Pain medication as ordered after assessment. NOTE: Frequently assess adequacy of
   pain control measures.
10.5. Casts.
   10.5.1. Ideally, plaster casts should be at least 48 hours old to allow for possible soft tissue
   expansion after an acute injury.
   10.5.2. Plaster casts should be bivalved if swelling is expected or if the cast restricts
   emergency egress, i.e; Spica. NOTE: If bivalving jeopardizes alignment of the fracture, the
   physician must be informed there may not be cast cutters available in-flight, and then write
   the order “Do Not Bi-Valve” on the appropriate patient treatment form.
   10.5.3. If the cast is over a surgical wound site, “window” the cast to allow for tissue
   expansion.
   10.5.4. Assess cast for: proper drying, cracks, rough edges, drainage and bleeding (outline,
   date and time site), foul odor, and pressure points.
   10.5.5. Perform circulation and neurological checks prior to flight. If abnormal, contact the
   MTF to bivalve the cast or loosen the bivalved cast.
10.6. Preflight/In-Flight Considerations for Orthopedic and Soft Tissue Injuries.
   10.6.1. Ensure skin integrity remains intact.
   10.6.2. Maintain immobility to control bleeding, maintain circulation, and to prevent fat
   embolism.
   10.6.3. Maintain traction.
       10.6.3.1. Ensure stability when using the following equipment:
       10.6.3.2. Stryker frame with or without Collins traction.
       10.6.3.3. HALO/external fixation/skeletal traction: pin care, as ordered.
       10.6.3.4. C-Collar, backboard or other non-shifting medium.
       10.6.3.5. HARE, SAGER, KENDRICK Traction devices and Thomas splints.
       10.6.3.6. NATO traction. WARNING: Do not use free hanging weights in-flight.
   10.6.4. Positioning & Alignment.
       10.6.4.1. Reposition every 2 hours with pillows.
       10.6.4.2. Pad and elevate extremities. WARNING: Do not tie extremities to any portion
       of the air- craft in order to maintain elevation
       10.6.4.3. Range of motion (ROM) exercises.
       10.6.4.4. Avoid resting extremities on the bulkhead or the interior of the aircraft due to
       effects of vibration.
       10.6.4.5. Litter patients should be positioned away from the bulkhead.
AFI41-307 20 AUGUST 2003                                                                         75


       10.6.4.6. Spica casts require two litter spaces.
       10.6.4.7. Mobility impaired ambulatory patients should not be near emergency exits. A
       “break- down” seat closest to the bulkhead may be used to elevate lower extremities.
       10.6.4.8. Hemovac/Jackson-Pratt (JP) drains may be present post-op: note placement and
       amount.
       10.6.4.9. N/G tube may be indicated to relieve abdominal pressure for patients in full
       body casts.
       10.6.4.10. Patients with complex injuries should be evaluated for calf tenderness and
       possible pulmonary/fat embolism. Refer to paragraph 4.6.7
10.7. Wound Drainage Tubes (Jackson-Pratt, T-Tube, Hemovac etc. ).
   10.7.1. Assess insertion site and assure suction is maintained at altitude, if indicated.
   10.7.2. Document I & O.
   10.7.3. Use standard precautions for disposal of blood and body fluids.
10.8. Negative-Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT).
   10.8.1. NPWT systems are generally indicated for the management of wounds, burns, ulcers,
   flaps and grafts. They apply negative pressure, using suction, to the wound in order to
   remove fluids, including wound exudates, irrigation fluids, and infectious materials. Benefits
   of NPWT include augmented wound granulation, wound contraction, improved control of
   wound exudates, decreased wound edema, reduced skin maceration, and improved pain
   management.
NOTE: Extra wound vacuum canisters should be available in the event current ones become full
or cracked.
CAUTION: KCI® NPWT is only compatible with KCI® equipment.
   10.8.2. NPWT is contraindicated in the presence of exposed anastomotic sites, exposed
   vasculature, exposed nerves, exposed organs, necrotic tissue with eschar present, untreated
   osteomyelitis, non-enteric and unexplored fistulas, and malignancy in the wound. Also,
   carefully consider the use of this therapy in patients with certain risk factors, including those
   with a high risk for bleeding and hemorrhage, and those receiving anticoagulants or platelet
   aggregation inhibitors.
   10.8.3. Assess patient comfort and system function every 2 hours inflight.
       10.8.3.1. Be vigilant for potentially life-threatening bleeding complications that are rare,
       and be prepared to take prompt action if that occurs.
       10.8.3.2. NPWT should not be interrupted for greater than two hours within a twenty-
       four hour period due to the potential for infection.
       10.8.3.3. Assess proper function by examining for alarms on the pump unit and
       inspecting the dressing. The dressing for a properly functioning system should have a
       “raisin-skin” appearance.
       10.8.3.4. The NPWT may cease effective pressure if the occlusive dressing is not sealed.
       Occlusive reinforcement may need to be applied.
 76                                                              AFI41-307 20 AUGUST 2003


       10.8.3.5. For non-correctable wound vac system failures inflight, when the patient’s
       destination is greater than 2 hours away, the overlying occlusive film should be opened
       by making 2-3 slits into the film to allow for wound drainage. DO NOT remove the
       occlusive film or the sponge inside the wound for risk of bleeding or wound
       contamination. A dry dressing should then be applied over the site and reinforced as
       needed. Report wound vac system failure and actions taken to receiving facility during
       handoff for follow-on care.
NOTE: The provided guidance at 10.8.3.4. is for use inflight should full system failure occur.
If wound vac system failure occurs while on the ground at originating station or during en route
stops contact the appropriate theater Patient Movement Requirements Center.
   10.8.4. Document amount of drainage on I&O sheet.
AFI41-307 20 AUGUST 2003                                                                     77

              EYES, EARS, NOSE, AND THROAT (EENT) MANAGEMENT

11.1. Eyes.
   11.1.1. Stresses of Flight.
      11.1.1.1. Decreased Partial Pressure of Oxygen: May cause increased intraocular
      pressure and vasodilatation due to hypoxia and may aggravate retinal hemorrhage,
      detached retina and glau- coma.
      11.1.1.2. Barometric Pressure Changes: Causes increased pressure with pain and reduced
      blood flow to the eye. Post-op eye surgery patients may have trapped air in the globe;
      certain gases used in surgery may persist three to nine weeks. A closed penetrating eye
      injury may also have trapped air in the globe; air normally is reabsorbed in three days.
      Expanding air at altitude may lead to increased pressure, pain and/or extrusion of eye
      contents.
      11.1.1.3. Decreased Humidity: Excessive drying of the eyes leads to corneal irritation
      and abra- sions of the sclera, especially in comatose patients or patients whose eyes do
      not completely close.
      11.1.1.4. Vibration/Thermal/Turbulence: Leads to motion sickness, vomiting, and
      increased intraocular pressure and pain.
   11.1.2. Preflight/In-Flight Considerations.
      11.1.2.1. Assess Extent of Visual Impairment/In-flight Risks.
          11.1.2.1.1. Treatment/Management: Suspect air in the globe with recent surgery, and
          penetrat- ing eye injuries with documented air in the globe (may also have associated
          facial trauma/ burns and head and C-Spine injuries).
              11.1.2.1.1.1. Post-op eye surgery patients will be cleared by an ophthalmologist
              prior to flight.
              11.1.2.1.1.2. Successful outcomes for penetrating eye injuries with documented
              air in the globe are highly dependent on rapid transportation to specialized care.
              Maintain a maxi- mum cabin altitude of 2000 feet if operationally feasible.
              NOTE: The VFS considers the following prior to ordering a cabin altitude: Flying
              at lower altitudes decreases speed and increases fuel consumption; rapid
              transportation to definitive care takes precedence.
                  11.1.2.1.1.2.1. All penetrating eye injury patients will be on O2 at 4 LPM via
                  nasal cannula or mask while in-flight.
          11.1.2.1.2. Hyphema or blood in the anterior chamber may re-bleed 2-7 days post
          injury. Re-bleeding may cause pain and substantial visual disability or blindness.
          WARNING: Val- salva is contraindicated in these patients.
          11.1.2.1.3. Medication: Must be ordered on the appropriate patient treatment form
          and pro- vided by the originating MTF.
78                                                               AFI41-307 20 AUGUST 2003


            11.1.2.1.3.1. Mydriatic drops (gtts): Dilates the pupil, impairs close vision, and

11.2. Ears.
   11.2.1. Stresses of Flight.
      11.2.1.1. Barometric Pressure Changes: Gas expansion or contraction affects the middle
      ear when pressure in the air filled cavities does not equalize with the cabin pressure.
      Equalization depends on the patency of the eustachian tube. During ascent, pressure is
      normally passively vented. Dur- ing descent, the eustachian tube needs active “opening”
      as the pressure becomes negative.
      11.2.1.2. Noise: Exposure for even a short period of time can lead to tinnitus, mild to
      severe pain, fatigue, and temporary to permanent hearing loss. Position away from high
      noise areas of aircraft and provide ear protection.
   11.2.2. Ear Block. Potential patients at risk are: upper respiratory infections (URI), sinus
   infections, allergies, otitis media, on high-flow O2, facial injury, nasal packing, infants,
   inability to use hands, post-eyes-nose-throat (ENT) surgery, difficulty swallowing, language
   barriers, unconscious/comatose patients. WARNING: Valsalva is contraindicated in patients
   with: glaucoma, recent eye surgery or injury, nasal/facial fractures, history of aneurysm,
   severe hypertension, cardiac disease and arrhyth- mias, and neurological disease with ICP.
   These patients should be evaluated by a flight surgeon prior to flight.
      11.2.2.1. Preflight Considerations.
          11.2.2.1.1. Prevention at originating MTF: Evaluate risk for ear block. Brief patient
          on signs and symptoms, as well as techniques to prevent potential ear block (if not
          contraindicated), and to notify AECM immediately if difficulty in clearing ears
          occurs. NOTE: Blast victims should be evaluated and treated for possible infection
          and trapped air following ruptured tym- panic membranes; tape dressing to absorb
          blood and fluid from the external ear canal, and assure it does not block or enter the
          external canal.
          11.2.2.1.2. Prevention techniques. The following may help prevent ear blocks on
          descent: swallowing; yawning, moving jaw from side to side; chewing gum (avoid on
          ascent); Toynbee maneuver (swallowing water with the nostrils closed); Valsalva;
          turn head away from the blocked ear while stretching the opposite ear to the shoulder
80                                                               AFI41-307 20 AUGUST 2003


         (stretches the Eustachian tube of the blocked ear), and while in this position, have the
         patient valsalva.
         11.2.2.1.3. Assess for signs/symptoms: fullness, pain (mild to severe), pressure in
         ear(s), decreased hearing (mild to acute), vertigo, tinnitus, and severe pain (indicates
         possible rupture of the eardrum that provides relief, but may lead to shock).
         11.2.2.1.4. Treatment/Management: Pre-medicate with oral or nasal decongestants
         unless contraindicated.
         11.2.2.1.5. FN may delay transport if patient is unable to “clear” ears or if an altitude
         restric-    tion  is    required      but      operationally     unrealistic.     Notify
         TACC/AMOCC/AOC/PMRC.
  11.2.3. In-flight Considerations.
     11.2.3.1. Ensure parents of infants/children have full bottle or glass with straw to aid in
     clearing of ears.
     11.2.3.2. Assist any patient/passenger with clearing ears using the above techniques.
     11.2.3.3. Use warm moist cloth to neck just below the ear or massage area just below the

         11.3.2.6. Force fluids en route.
11.4. Maxillofacial/Sinus Block/Teeth.
   11.4.1. Stresses Of Flight.
         11.4.1.1. Barometric Pressure Changes: Gas may become trapped or partially trapped in
         sinuses and teeth, increasing pain.
         11.4.1.2. Decreased Humidity: Causes mucous membranes to dry out leading to pain
         and/or dis- comfort.
         11.4.1.3. Vibration: May increase pain and exacerbate underlying condition.
   11.4.2. Preflight/In-flight Considerations.
         11.4.2.1. Maxillofacial Assessment/Treatment/Management.
             11.4.2.1.1. Jaw Immobilization: Assess for type of immobilizer and release

         flight.
      11.4.3. Sinus Block. Sinuses normally equalize and vent during ascent. On descent,
      individuals who are at risk for problems and sinus blocks are more likely to have colds,
      allergies, and chronic or acute sinus conditions.
         11.4.3.1. Preflight/In-Flight Considerations.
             11.4.3.1.1. Prior to flight, brief patients on signs and symptoms, and how to notify
             AECMs.
             11.4.3.1.2. Assess for Signs/Symptoms: include pain (mild to severe), burning
             sensation, ten- derness over the affected sinus, bloody/mucopurulent discharge, teary

                11.4.3.1.3.4.1. Re-ascend and slow the rate of cabin descent, if possible.
                11.4.3.1.3.4.2. Administer mild vasoconstrictors. Refer to paragraph 11.2.3.5
                11.4.3.1.3.4.3. Observe     for   relief   of   pain   and      pressure,   and   for
                bleeding/drainage.
            11.4.3.1.3.5. Evaluation by a flight surgeon at en route stop or RON to assess
            whether the patient may continue with the mission.
            11.4.3.1.3.6. If the patient continues on the mission, coordinate slower descents
            and pro- vide patient with vasoconstrictor for the subsequent descents; may
            require an altitude restriction. Observe for bleeding/drainage. NOTE: Valsalva
            and using the Politzer Bag may not be effective because of the very small
            openings and passageways into the sinuses. With irritation and inflammation
            these openings and passages swell quickly. Valsalva and using the Politzer bag
            may actually increase the patient’s pain.
  11.4.4. Teeth. Tooth pain may be associated with trapped gas in a decayed tooth or pressure
  on the tooth below the blocked sinus.
     11.4.4.1. May require an altitude restriction until tooth is evaluated and treated. Have a
     flight sur- geon evaluate the patient prior to flight.
     11.4.4.2. If pain occurs at altitude, descend until pain is diminished, if operationally
     possible.
         11.4.4.2.1. Document and communicate with receiving MTF for further evaluation.
         11.4.4.2.2. Instruct patient/passenger to seek medical attention at final destination.

12.1. Gastrointestinal (GI) Considerations.
   12.1.1. Stresses of Flight.
         12.1.1.1. Barometric Pressure Changes: Gas expansion may cause abdominal discomfort,
         decreased lung expansion and volume, nausea and vomiting, and may require nasogastric
         tube decompression preflight or in-flight. If on a continuous feeding, allow for venting.
         12.1.1.2. Vibration: May exacerbate patient’s underlying condition or diagnosis.
         12.1.1.3. Thermal: Underlying condition or diagnosis may make the patient more
         sensitive to thermal changes and more susceptible to motion sickness.
         12.1.1.4. Fatigue: May exacerbate the patient’s condition due to the overall effect of the
         previ- ously mentioned stresses of flight and length of time the patient has been in the AE
         system.
      12.1.2. Motion Sickness.

            MANAGEMENT OF OBSTETRICS/ IN-FLIGHT CHILD BIRTH

13.1. Stresses Of Flight.
   13.1.1. Decreased Partial Pressure of Oxygen: May cause an increase in cardiac workload
   with a decrease in diaphragmatic excursion. Lower concentration of O2 to the placenta
   results in fetal hypoxia.
   13.1.2. Barometric Pressure Changes: Gas expansion may cause pain and uterine irritability
   and decrease capacity for lung expansion.
   13.1.3. Noise/Vibration: May increase seizure risk in preeclamptic and eclamptic patients,
   and may cause uterine irritability and excessive stimulation and movement of the fetus.
   13.1.4. Decreased Humidity: Dehydration may induce or complicate pre-term labor.
   13.1.5. Fatigue: Excess weight, physiological changes, overall affects of the previously
   mentioned stresses, and the length of time in the AE system fatigues the patient.
   13.1.6. G-Forces: May result in pushing fetus onto the maternal vena cava or the placenta.
13.2. General Considerations.
   13.2.1. Patients who are beyond the 34th week of pregnancy are not routinely accepted for
   AE, but will be moved if determined necessary by a physician. NOTE: An incubator will be
   carried and ready to use on board the aircraft.
   13.2.2. Patients in premature labor or with prematurely ruptured membranes may be airlifted
   after labor is controlled on a case-by-case basis.
   13.2.3. A physician or a competent obstetrical nurse may be required to accompany a high-
   risk OB patient.
   13.2.4. Patient Positioning : Strict bedrest, as directed, in the left lateral recumbent (LLR)
   position. Ambulatory, place a small pillow between the seatbelt and the lower abdomen,
   across the hips. Should have a litter available.
   13.2.5. Supplies and Equipment.
       13.2.5.1. Universal OB pack/bulb syringe.
       13.2.5.2. ALSS, (Refer to AFI 41-309).
       13.2.5.3. Oxygen and suction available.
       13.2.5.4. Doppler/Doptone.
       13.2.5.5. Pulse Oximeter.
       13.2.5.6. Privacy curtain.
       13.2.5.7. IV Infusion Pump.
       13.2.5.8. Cardiac Monitor.
 90                                                                AFI41-307 20 AUGUST 2003


   13.2.6. A post partum mother may accompany an infant to more definitive care. Assure
   medication and supplies accompany the patient. If determined to be unstable, notify
   TACC/AMOCC/AOC/ PMRC for guidance and possible diversion to a MTF capable of
   handling the situation.
13.3. Preflight Assessment and Documentation: Includes the following:
   13.3.1. Maternal vital signs, to include preflight pulse-oximetry, temperature, and breath
   sounds if indicated. Note any presence of edema.
   13.3.2. Expected Date of Confinement (EDC)/Gestational age; current OB history (gravida,
   parity, and abortions) and previous OB history (previous complications, vaginal or cesarean
   section).
   13.3.3. Onset, duration, frequency and intensity of contractions, if present. The presence of
   back, pel- vic and/or rectal pain.
   13.3.4. Membranes intact; if not, note time of rupture, amount, color and odor.
   13.3.5. Assess for active bleeding; estimate the amount.
   13.3.6. Presentation, last vaginal exam/cervical status, if indicated. NOTE: Do not attempt a
   vaginal exam.
      13.3.7. Preflight urinalysis (protein and sugar). 13.3.8 Fetal Heart Tones (FHTs; Normal
      range for FHTs: 120-160/minute): Obtained prior to flight, reassess at cruise altitude, and
      every 12 hours there- after. Documentation of FHTs and fetal movement will be
      accomplished starting at the 20th week of gestation.
   13.3.8. Other significant medical history: age, diabetes, headache, epigastric pain, cardiac
   disease, seizures, hypertension, smoking, and alcohol and drug abuse.
13.4. Treatment/Management Priorities, Preflight, and In-flight Considerations for High-
Risk OB. A qualified medical attendant will usually accompany these types of patients.
   13.4.1. Maintain adequate oxygen transport across the placenta to the fetus.
         13.4.1.1. Keep on litter, off back and in the LLR position. If mother must be on back, use
         pillow to promote uterine displacement and relieve pressure on the superior vena cava,
         which can lead to hypotension and decreased oxygen flow to the fetus.
   13.4.2. Vital signs appropriate to stage of labor, to include FHT via doppler/doptone. Assess
   FHT for one full minute during and after contractions; note location and character, and any
   slowing or irregu- larities. NOTE: Assess FHTs immediately after rupture of membranes.
   13.4.3. Management of Magnesium Sulfate (MgSO4) Infusion (for preterm labor or
   pregnancy induced hypertension).
         13.4.3.1. Monitor maternal blood pressure, respirations, accurate intake and output, and
         deep ten- don reflexes (DTRs). NOTE: Obtain during preflight assessment and hourly or
         as ordered to iden- tify early congestive heart failure (CHF), pulmonary edema, sepsis,
         seizures, and adult respiratory disorder.
         13.4.3.2. Pre-flight H and H, urinalysis (protein and sugar) and serum MgSO4.
         13.4.3.3. Oxygen, Ambu/Laerdal bag, and intubation equipment/supplies available.
AFI41-307 20 AUGUST 2003                                                                   91

       present (insure balloon is deflated in SG prior to take-off).
          13.4.3.4.1. Infusion Pumps: Mainline/MgSO4 infusion.
       13.4.3.5. Foley catheter should be in place to monitor strict I & O. NOTE: Consider
       LLR position when monitoring Foley output.
       13.4.3.6. Calcium gluconate for MgSO4 toxicity. NOTE 1: Must be ordered on the
       patient treat- ment form and provided by the originating MTF. NOTE 2: Not a part of the
       in-flight medical kit.
   13.4.4. MgSO4 Toxicity.
       13.4.4.1. Be vigilant for loss of DTRs, pulse less than 60/min; BP less than 90
       mmHg/systolic; urine output less than 30cc/hour.
       13.4.4.2. Treatment/Management. Notify TACC/AMOCC/AOC/PMRC for guidance and
       possi- ble diversion to a MTF capable of handling the situation and concurrently:
          13.4.4.2.1. Discontinue the MgSO4 infusion for severe CNS depression (lethargy,
          slurred speech) or respirations less than 12 bpm.
          13.4.4.2.2. Place on cardiac monitor.
          13.4.4.2.3. Administer calcium gluconate 10% solution, per physician’s order
          (usually 1 gram), slow IVP over 3 minutes. WARNING: May produce cardiac
          arrhythmia, bradycardia or cardiac arrest. Stop infusion if chest pain occurs. If
          treatment is initiated, concurrently con- tact TACC/AMOCC/AOC/PMRC for
          guidance and possible diversion to a MTF capable of handling the situation, as
          required. NOTE: This is not an AE Drug Protocol.
   13.4.5. Seizure Precautions. Refer to Neurological Management. NOTE: Management of
   the mater- nal airway and adequate oxygenation of the fetus across the placenta takes
   precedence as soon as an airway is established.
       13.4.5.1. Anticonvulsant drug therapy as ordered by the accompanying physician.
13.5. Gestational Diabetes (Insulin dependent): Labor increases metabolic needs, be aware of
the signs and symptoms of hyper/hypoglycemia. Refer to Medical Management.
   13.5.1. Treatment/Management (If in labor).
       13.5.1.1. Continuous insulin or glucose infusions with mainline Lactated Ringers will
       stabilize maternal glucose levels and may reduce neonatal hyperglycemia (Insulin is
       discontinued at deliv- ery).
       13.5.1.2. Maintain NPO.
       13.5.1.3. Evaluate glucose levels prior to take off and as ordered at en route stops;
       maintain levels at 80 to 120 mg. NOTE: Terbutaline is contraindicated for an insulin-
       dependent diabetic because of its transient hyperglycemic effects.
13.6. Pregnancy Induced Hypertension (PIH). Complications include decreased placental
perfusion. In-patient record and/or narrative summary is essential.
   13.6.1. Treatment/Management Priorities.
 92                                                                AFI41-307 20 AUGUST 2003

13.12. Delivery Complications.
   13.12.1. Breech Presentation. This involves the bony pelvis area and extremities (one or
   both feet or knees may be present). There is a high incidence in multiple birth deliveries and
   hydrocephalus. Breech presentation is likely to have cord prolapse, entanglement and
   compression. Labor is usually slower in breech presentation.
      13.12.1.1. Treatment/Management.
96                                                             AFI41-307 20 AUGUST 2003


        13.12.1.1.1. Aggressive coaching to prevent pushing.
        13.12.1.1.2. Check for presence of cord and palpate for pulse.
        13.12.1.1.3. If Delivery is Imminent:
            13.12.1.1.3.1. Do not touch fetus until umbilicus is delivered then disentangle the
            cord.
  13.12.2. Postpartum Hemorrhage.
     13.12.2.1. Assess Signs and Symptoms. Refer to Shock Management.
        13.12.2.1.1. Normal physiologic changes in pregnancy may mask hypovolemia.
        13.12.2.1.2. Greater than 4 - 6 pads per hour indicates a high volume of blood loss.
        13.12.2.1.3. Increase in fundal height and a non-palpable bladder.
        13.12.2.1.4. Boggy fundus.
     13.12.2.2. Treatment/Management.
        13.12.2.2.1. Massage fundus.
        13.12.2.2.2. Put baby to breast.
        13.12.2.2.3. Do not place anything in vagina.
 13.12.3. Prolapsed Cord. Cord slips in front of or alongside the presenting fetal part. May
 occur when there is inadequate room between the fetal parts and the maternal pelvis.
 Predisposing factors: rupture of membranes when the fetus is not engaged in the pelvis;
 shoulder and foot presentations; prematurity and hydramnios. NOTE: Suspect with FHT
 deceleration/bradycardia after rupture of the membranes.
     13.12.3.1. Assessment Signs/Symptoms: Cord visualized or palpated in the vagina,
     variable deceleration/bradycardia of FHTs with contractions or between contractions, and
     cord is exposed to cold room air resulting in a reflex constriction and a decrease of O2 to
     the fetus.
     13.12.3.2. Management/Treatment:
        13.12.3.2.1. If the Cord Is NOT Visualized or Palpated:
            13.12.3.2.1.1. Place patient in LLR or LLR Trendelenberg.
            13.12.3.2.1.2. Monitor vital signs, O2 saturation and FHTs.
        13.12.3.2.2. If the Cord IS Visible:
            13.12.3.2.2.1. Don sterile gloves and apply upward manual pressure to presenting
            part to lift off the cord. WARNING: Do not discontinue upward manual pressure
            unless directed by a physician.
            13.12.3.2.2.2. Place patient in knee chest or deep Trendelenberg position (latter
            preferred for aircraft landing).
            13.12.3.2.2.3. Have MA or AECM remain with patient during descent and
            landing.
AFI41-307 20 AUGUST 2003                                                                       97


  13.12.4. Uterine Inversion. Uterus turns inside out (may be complete, extending through
  the cervix and into the vagina, and could be visible). May be a result of over aggressive third
  stage management or spontaneously after a contraction or high pressure in the abdomen, i.e.,
  sneezing, valsalva.
     13.12.4.1. Assess Signs and Symptoms:
         13.12.4.1.1. Sudden and severe abdominal pain.
         13.12.4.1.2. Profuse vaginal bleeding after delivery.
         13.12.4.1.3. Defect in the fundus or inability to palpate the fundus.
         13.12.4.1.4. Hypovolemic shock.
     13.12.4.2. Treatment/Management. Refer to Shock Management.
         13.12.4.2.1. Allow for spontaneous delivery of the placenta to decrease the risk of
         the hemor- rhage.
  13.12.5. Uterine Rupture. Location and extent influences the degree of hemorrhage and
  complica- tion (most bleeding is into the peritoneal cavity). Life threatening in-flight medical
  emergency. Notify TACC/AMOCC/AOC/PMRC for guidance and possible diversion to a
  MTF capable of handling the situation.
     13.12.5.1. Predisposing factors include scarred uterus/prior C-section, vigorous fundal
     pressure, and external pressure during delivery and direct trauma.
         13.12.5.1.1. Assess Signs and Symptoms:
             13.12.5.1.1.1. Sudden, severe, and continuous abdominal pain.
             13.12.5.1.1.2. May have shoulder and chest pain.
             13.12.5.1.1.3. Contractions may be absent or increase in frequency and intensity.
             13.12.5.1.1.4. Hypovolemic shock.
     13.12.5.2. Treatment/Management: Refer to Shock Management.
  13.12.6. Shoulder Dystocia. Exists when the head is delivered and the shoulder does not
  follow with gentle traction; the shoulders are pushed against the symphysis preventing torso
  delivery.
     13.12.6.1. Treatment/Management. Refer to Lippincott.
  13.12.7. Trauma in Pregnancy. May be categorized as, but not limited to, blunt injury
  (commonly from automobile accidents), thermal injury, or penetrating injury. Refer to Shock
  Management
     13.12.7.1. General treatment/management focuses on the mother and includes:
         13.12.7.1.1. Monitor VS, FHTs, and contractions.
         13.12.7.1.2. Obtain baseline O2 saturation prior to flight, then in-flight (PRN), and
         prior to deplaning.
         13.12.7.1.3. Administer supplemental O2 if oxygen saturation drops below 91%.

      resuscitation and stabilization then evaluate fractures, uterine bleeding, and fetus status.
13.13. Immediate Care Of the Newborn. Refer to Lippincott and to Pediatric/Neonate
Management.
   13.13.1. Clear the airway through suctioning (either with a bulb syringe or 5 - 60 mmHg
   suctioning), suction mouth first, then the nose. Visualization of the vocal chords and possible
   tracheal suctioning may be required if meconium staining is present.
   13.13.2. Dry newborn using vigorous stimulation; however, if meconium staining is present,
   avoid stimulation until airway is clear.
   13.13.3. Assess vital signs and APGAR score at one and five minutes. Refer to Table 13.1
   13.13.4. Ensure the cord remains clamped to avoid bleeding.
   13.13.5. Placed in warmed ALSS, if available, or wrap infant in a blanket. Have mother hold
   infant for body warmth if ALSS is unavailable.
   13.13.6. Use blow-by O2.
   13.13.7. Prevent heat loss from radiation (between body and surrounding objects),
   convection (air- flow over the body), evaporation (wet infant), and conduction (between body
   and contact with objects).

                        PEDIATRIC/NEONATAL MANAGEMENT

14.1. Stresses Of Flight.
   14.1.1. Decreased Partial Pressure of Oxygen: Infants and younger children are more
   reactive to hypoxia, and will become hypoxic earlier than adults.
   14.1.2. Barometric Pressure Changes: Encourage the use of a pacifier/bottle on descent to
   help the infant/child clear their ears. Gastric compression may restrict diaphragmatic
   movement, especially if supine; elevate head and consider decompression with an oral or
   nasogastric tube.
   14.1.3. Thermal: Thermal changes have the greatest impact on infants and young children
   who have a very sensitive thermoregulating system. Increase the cabin temperature, if
   necessary.
   14.1.4. Decreased Humidity: Infants and children are more susceptible to dehydration. If
   infant is in an Airborne Life Support System (ALSS), ensure that the proper amount of
   distilled sterile water is present in the humidification sponge. If not NPO or receiving IVs or
   tube feedings, give fluids at least every two hours. NOTE: Assess for infant dehydration:
   palpate for depressed anterior fontanel.
   14.1.5. Noise: Infants/children are sensitive to excessive noise. Earplugs should be cut in
   half (verti- cally) to fit the smaller ear canals. Infants in ALSS should also wear earplugs,
   even though the double paned construction muffles aircraft noise.
   14.1.6. Vibration: Ensure infants are padded when in car seats or the ALSS.
   14.1.7. Fatigue: Fatigue has the greatest impact on pediatric patients of any age (newborn to
   12 years old). The result of fatigue is an uncooperative child.
14.2. Preflight/In-flight Considerations.
   14.2.1. Assess airway and breathing.
       14.2.1.1. Respiratory dysfunction is the most common cause of cardiac arrest so
       stabilization of the airway is of primary concern.
       14.2.1.2. A child’s trachea is narrow, tongue is large, intercostal muscles are weak;
       proper posi- tioning is essential.
       14.2.1.3. Use Head Tilt, Chin Lift to open the airway.
       14.2.1.4. For spinal immobilization use Jaw Thrust. WARNING: Hyperextension or
       flexion of the neck will cause airway compression. A rolled towel placed under the
       shoulders of the infant or child aids in maximizing airway size and reducing resistance.
       For neutral alignment of the C-Spine, align the external auditory meatus with the
       shoulders.
   14.2.2. If intubated, there should be a medical attendant accompanying the patient capable of
   manag- ing the airway and a ventilator.
 100                                                                AFI41-307 20 AUGUST 2003


       14.2.2.1. Use cuffless endotracheal tubes up to age eight.
       14.2.2.2. Have on hand one size larger and one size smaller endotracheal tube.
       14.2.2.3. Right-mainstem bronchus intubation is more common in children. Evaluate
       prior to takeoff.
       14.2.2.4. Monitor pulse oximetry and titrate O2 to maintain SaO2 greater than 91%.
       14.2.2.5. Ensure adequate humidification of the O2 delivery systems.
   14.2.3. Vital Signs: Normal Heart Rate. Count apical pulse for a full minute. WARNING:
   brady- cardia is life threatening and is associated with hypoxemia; CPR is indicated if the
   child is bradycardic with poor perfusion or is pulseless.
       14.2.3.1. Infant: 120-160/min.
       14.2.3.2. Toddler: 90 – 140/ min.
       14.2.3.3. Preschool: 80 - 110/min.
       14.2.3.4. School age: 75 - 110/min.
       14.2.3.5. Adolescent: 60 – 90/min.
   14.2.4. Normal Respiratory Rate. Count for a full minute. NOTE: a respiratory rate
   greater than 60/min is abnormal for any child.
       14.2.4.1. Infant: 30 - 60/min.
       14.2.4.2. Toddler: 20– 40/min.
       14.2.4.3. Preschool: 20 - 30/min.
       14.2.4.4. School age: 18 - 30/min.
       14.2.4.5. Adolescent: 12 – 16/min.
   14.2.5. Blood Pressure. Average systolic pressure for children one year old and over: (Age
   in years X 2) + 90mm Hg; lower limit: (Age in years X 2) + 70mm Hg indicates hypotension.
   14.2.6. Skin Color. Cyanosis is a late sign of hypoxia.
   14.2.7. Mental Status/Level of Activity. Active and alert? Lethargic or unresponsive?
   14.2.8. Urine Output.
       14.2.8.1. Infant: 2 ml/kg/hr.
       14.2.8.2. Child over 2 yr: 1 ml/kg/hr.
   14.2.9. Offer fluids every one to two hours (unless contraindicated).
NOTE: IV infusion pumps will be used for all neonatal/pediatric patients.
14.3. Rapid Cardiopulmonary Assessment.
   14.3.1. Early recognition of the symptoms of progressive deterioration in respiratory and
   circulatory function and prompt initiation of therapy can often prevent cardiac arrest.
   WARNING: Bradycardia is life threatening and is associated with hypoxia; CPR is indicated
   if the child is bradycardic with poor perfusion or is pulseless. Notify
AFI41-307 20 AUGUST 2003                                                                      101

                                 ANAPHYLACTIC SHOCK

A2.1. Anaphylactic Shock: An acute systemic allergic reaction as a result of the release of
chemical mediators after an antigen-antibody reaction. An immediate, life-threatening reaction.
   A2.1.1. Caused by injection (such as tetanus antitoxin, penicillin), ingestion (foods such as
   shellfish), inhalation, stings and bites.
   A2.1.2. Assess Signs and Symptoms: May occur within minutes after exposure to allergic
   substances. Release of chemical mediators causes vasodilation, increased capillary
   permeability, constriction of the bronchus, and decreased peristalsis.
       A2.1.2.1. Skin: Flushed, itching, with or without hives; edema of face and tongue may
       be present.
       A2.1.2.2. Respiratory: Laryngeal edema, bronchospasm, cough, wheezing, tightness or
       pain in chest. Stridorous breathing and retractions.
       A2.1.2.3. Circulatory: Hypotension, tachycardia, arrhythmia, palpitations, pallor,
       dizziness and syncope.
       A2.1.2.4. Neurological: Anxiety, fatigue, lethargy and coma; sudden loss of
       consciousness and seizures.
   A2.1.3. Preflight/In-flight Considerations and Care for Anaphylactic Shock.
       A2.1.3.1. Maintain ABC’s. Start high flow O2 (Refer to Table 4.1). Monitor pulse
       oximetry.
       A2.1.3.2. Establish an IV and administer fluids if hypotensive.
       A2.1.3.3. Remove the causative agent, if known.
       A2.1.3.4. Treatment/Management: Notify TACC/AMOCC/AOC/ PMRC for guidance
       and pos- sible diversion to a MTF capable of handling the situation, and concurrently
       initiate:
          A2.1.3.4.1. Epinephrine (1: 1000) 0.3ml subcutaneous (SC) every 15 mins. for
          adults. Repeat up to 3 times (x) for moderate bronchospasm, facial and laryngeal
          edema. NOTE: Pediatrics: Epinephrine 0.01cc/kg (1:1000) SC, one dose only for
          moderate-severe bron- chospasm, facial and laryngeal edema.
              A2.1.3.4.1.1. Stimulates both alpha and beta receptors of the sympathetic nervous
              system.
              A2.1.3.4.1.2. Side effects: nervousness, tremor, headache, palpitations,
              hypertension, tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation. May exacerbate severe
              congenital heart defects and congestive heart failure.
          A2.1.3.4.2. Administer Benadryl (diphenhydramine) 50mg IVP x 1 if
          unresponsive to SC EPI.
              A2.1.3.4.2.1. Contraindicated in acute asthma and lactating women.

   (EC)”
       A3.1.1.1. Percutaneous injury: needlestick or cut with sharp object.
       A3.1.1.2. Contact of mucous membrane or non-intact skin (e.g. dermatitis, chapped
       skin).
       A3.1.1.3. Contact with intact skin when duration is prolonged or extensive.
   A3.1.2. Initial Treatment.
       A3.1.2.1. Immediately wash wound and skin sites that have been in contact with human
       blood and body fluids (BBF) with soap and water or with AE approved waterless hand
       cleaners/antisep- tics when handwashing facilities are inadequate, inaccessible, or when
       there is an interruption in the water supply.
       A3.1.2.2. Mucous membranes should be flushed with water or normal saline.
       A3.1.2.3. Topical antiseptics are not contraindicated; the application of caustic agents
       (e.g. bleach) or the injection of antiseptics or disinfectants into the wound is not
       recommended.
A3.2. Assessment of HCW Exposure Risk. Refer to “Step 1.”
   A3.2.1. Immediately notify the PMRC Validating Flight Surgeon (VFS) or local MTF
   physician of the following:
       A3.2.1.1. Name, SSN, Date/Time of Injury/Exposure, Unit of Assignment/Phone, Home
       Phone.
NOTE: Reporting of name and SSN is limited to land line telephones.
       A3.2.1.2. Date of last hepatitis B vaccine and results of last antibody/titer screening, if
       known.
       A3.2.1.3. Current medication, allergies and past history including possibility of
       pregnancy.
       A3.2.1.4. How the exposure occurred.

       A3.2.2.1. The BBF source, type of exposure (mucous membrane; compromised integrity
       of skin and percutaneous).
       A3.2.2.2. The volume, duration, and severity of exposure.
       A3.2.2.3. Determine Source Patient Demographics and the HIV Status Code (HIV
       SC). (Figure A3.1, Step 2).
           A3.2.2.3.1. Source Patient Name, Cite Number, Diagnosis, and HIV Status, if
           known. NOTE: Reporting of name is limited to land line telephones.
           A3.2.2.3.2. Determine the source patient’s Hepatitis history.
           A3.2.2.3.3. The PMRC/VFS or local physician will review the above factors and
           determine the course of treatment for the exposed HCW. (Figure A3.1, “Step 3:
           Determine the PEP Rec- ommendation”)
       A3.2.2.4. If the Exposure is Considered to be High. The physician will order a STAT
       dose of Combivir [zidovudine (AZT) and lamivudine (3TC)] one tablet P.O., one dose
       only, to be admin- istered within two hours of exposure.
WARNING: The HCW’s local flight surgeon, public health physician or the receiving MTF
prescribes additional Combivir after a complete physical assessment and laboratory studies are
accomplished.
           A3.2.2.4.1. The HCW will require baseline HIV, Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C
           screening before receiving additional Combivir. Once prophylaxis is started, a
           baseline and weekly CBC, BUN, Creatinine, AST, ALT, Bilirubin and CK is
           required. Follow up IAW local directives.
NOTE: The source patient should be screened for HIV, Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C at the same
MTF as the HCW. If this is not possible, obtain accepting physician name and phone number.
           A3.2.2.4.2. If the situation occurs in-flight or the HCW is away from home station,
           the PMRC/VFS determines if a waiver for continued performance in a duty status is
           appropriate, and if the mission and the source patient will be diverted to a MTF
           capable of handling the sit- uation.
              A3.2.2.4.2.1. The PMRC/VFS will determine fitness for continued performance
              in a duty status in coordination with the MAJCOM/SGP to assure HCW returns to
              the duty station, and will initiate reporting IAW current clinical performance
              management guidelines.
           A3.2.2.4.3. Combivir Side Effects: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache and
           fatigue should be reported to a physician immediately. WARNING: Do not consume
           alcoholic beverages.
           A3.2.2.4.4. When the Two-Hour Treatment Window is Nearing. If the EC and
           the HIV SC is considered high, and the PMRC/VFS or another physician cannot be
           contacted, a HCW may take Combivir one tablet P.O., one dose only. Notify PMRC
           as soon as possible.
              A3.2.2.4.4.1. The aircraft commander, the MCD and AECMs will assess the
              situation and the condition of the HCW to determine if the mission will continue

     ISCHEMIC CHEST PAIN (REFER TO THE CURRENT ACLS ALGORITHM)

A4.1. Ischemic Chest Pain. Patients with coronary atherosclerosis may develop chest pain that
may be indicative of various degrees of coronary artery occlusion. Rapid recognition, treatment,
and communica- tion to the TACC/AMOCC/AOC/PMRC for guidance and possible diversion to
a MTF capable of han- dling the situation may improve clinical outcomes for these patients.
   A4.1.1. Assessment.
       A4.1.1.1. Complains of an uncomfortable pressure, fullness, squeezing or pain in the
       center of the chest lasting several minutes. Pain may spread to shoulders, neck, arms, the
       jaw, back or between the shoulder blades.
       A4.1.1.2. Chest pain may be accompanied by lightheadedness, fainting, sweating, nausea
       or shortness of breath.
       A4.1.1.3. Feeling of distress, anxiety or impending doom.
       A4.1.1.4. Obtain vital signs every 5 - 15 minutes. Place on cardiac monitor and pulse
       oximeter. Listen to heart and lung sounds – significantly diminished in the AE
       environment.
       A4.1.1.5. Ask the following: What precipitated the episode and when did it start? Is this
       pain dif- ferent from previous episodes, if so, how? Have patient rate pain on a numerical
       scale 1-10, with one being the least and 10 being the worse. How does patient obtain
       relief from chest pain epi- sodes?
A4.2. Treatment/Management. Notify TACC/AMOCC/AOC/PMRC for guidance                           and
possible diver- sion to a MTF capable of handling the situation, and concurrently initiate:
   A4.2.1. Administer high flow O2 (refer to Table 4.1) until chest pain is relieved. Then
   administer O2 at 2-4 lpm by nasal cannula.
   A4.2.2. Administer Nitroglycerin SL one 0. 3 to 0.4 mg tablet or spray every five
   minutes x 3 doses for suspected cardiac chest pain.
       A4.2.2.1. Action: Decreases venous blood return to the heart; decreases preload and
       oxygen con- sumption; dilates coronary arteries; increases cardiac collateral flow;
       decreases the pain of cardiac ischemia.
       A4.2.2.2. Monitor BP after each dose. Do not administer additional doses if BP is below
       90 sys- tolic.
       A4.2.2.3. Side effects: headache, hypotension, dizziness, flushing, palpitations, nausea
       and vom- iting. NOTE: Notify a physician ASAP if chest pain is unrelieved.
   A4.2.3. Move to litter with a backrest if in a seat, if indicated.
   A4.2.4. Cool cabin if diaphoretic and nauseous.
   A4.2.5. If chest pain is unrelieved, contact a physician.
   A4.2.6. Administer ASA 160mg to 325 mg PO if chest pain is unrelieved by
   Nitroglycerin.

       NOTE: Second Level MTFs will provide Rh Negative packed red cells to Rh Negative
       male and female patients. Third Level and higher MTFs have the capability and are
       expected to group, type and crossmatch blood prior to transfusion of O Negative patients.
AFI41-307 20 AUGUST 2003                                                                       123


     In the event of shortages of Rh Negative blood, priority will be given to Rh Negative
     female recipients.
     A5.3.2.2. A physician must order the administration of blood or blood components.
     NOTE: Only physicians will initiate/order blood product therapy.
     A5.3.2.3. A nurse and/or the medical attendant (physician and nurse) are primarily
     responsible for the proper administration of blood and blood components. A trained and
     competent medical technician may act as the second verifier.
     A5.3.2.4. Obtain and record pre-infusion vital signs, including temperature.
     A5.3.2.5. Prior to starting the transfusion, two medical personnel, one who will be a
     nurse or phy- sician, will verify the physician order, cross verify and compare the blood
     unit Form/Tag SF 518, Blood or Blood Component Transfusion Record and the
     Patient Identification Card. In the absence of a patient ID band, the patient’s military
     identification card, passport or dog tag will be used.
     A5.3.2.6. At the bedside, cross-verify and compare the blood unit Form/Tag SF 518, the
     Patient Identification Card, and the patient’s identification bracelet/tag. Each verifier will
     sign Section 3 of SF 518. WARNING: Always wear gloves and goggles when handling
     and hanging blood prod- ucts.
     A5.3.2.7. All blood and blood products will be administered through a dedicated line of
     Normal Saline (NS). Flush the entire IV line with NS prior to starting the infusion.
     WARNING: Do not add any other medications or IV fluid to the line or unit of blood.
     A5.3.2.8. Start the transfusion at a slow rate and administer approximately 50 cc over 15
     minutes. Document date and start/end time on SF 518, DD Form 602, and AF Forms
     3829/3899.
     A5.3.2.9. Continually monitor the patient during the first 15 minutes. Check vital signs
     and tem- perature after the first 15 minutes of infusion, repeat in 15 minutes, then every
     30 minutes (twice) and then hourly until one hour post-transfusion.
     A5.3.2.10. Educate patient regarding possible adverse reaction signs and symptoms
     (chills, back or chest pain, hives, rash, and/or wheezing). Refer to Attachment 7,
     Reaction to Blood Products

                     MENTAL HEALTH/BEHAVIOR MANAGEMENT

A6.1. The acute exacerbation of psychiatric or behavioral disorders in-flight may place the
aircraft, crew, and other patients and passengers at risk. Some patients who present a clear flight
safety risk and qualify for in-flight restraints may not qualify for the use of restraints in a ground-
based medical facility. Use of restraints must not be for the convenience of the medical staff,
ground transportation crew or the AE crew. There must be a clear indication of need, based on
the risk to flight safety, to the patient, or others on board. Higher acuity psychiatric patients
judged a high risk by the originating physician and PMRC/VFS will be pre-medicated for flight
and have PRN drug orders from the originating physician. Use of restraints requires clear
physician orders. Patients require special consideration and attention in all phases of the AE
environment to safeguard personal dignity and respect for cultural, psychological and spiritual
values, and to ultimately ensure personal safety and the safety of others. The goal is to use the
safest and least restrictive measures to control behavior within the AE environment, utilizing
physicians, nurses, medical attendants (MA), and family members.
WARNING: Maintain strict patient confidentiality and release medical records and information
only on a need-to-know basis. This is particularly for individuals with legal, financial or
domestic difficulties.
   A6.1.1. Stresses of Flight.
       A6.1.1.1. Decreased partial pressure of oxygen and low humidity exacerbates effects of
       medica- tion.
       A6.1.1.2. Noise, fatigue, prolonged confinement in the aircraft, and vibration may
       increase irrita- bility and the occurrence of agitation and hallucinations.
A6.2. General Patient Considerations.
   A6.2.1. Psychiatric patients typically are physically healthy, and therefore capable of
   independent actions that could directly threaten the crew and other patients. Patients with
   severe or moderately severe behavior problems will be on a litter or have a litter available
   while in-flight. All psychiatric lit- ter patients should wear hospital pajamas and a robe
   (without a belt), unless otherwise ordered.
   A6.2.2. The requirement for an MA should be determined by the originating physician in
   consulta- tion with the PMRC/VFS IAW AFI 41-306. All severe psychiatric patients
   requiring ongoing supervi- sion will have a MA of the same gender, and when necessary a
   MA of commensurate rank during movement between the originating and the destination
   facility, unless otherwise ordered.
NOTE: All MAs are responsible for planning and coordinating care with the MCD/FN,
including assess- ing the environment for safety, administering medications, and charting. MAs
will maintain one-to-one contact with the patient, and coordinate breaks with the medical crew.
   A6.2.3. Position litter patients in the lowest litter space, away from the flight deck,
   emergency exits, and O2 shutoff valves. Assign ambulatory patients a seat near the bulkhead,
   away from the flight deck, emergency exits and O2 shut off valves. Assess potential safety
   risks of nearby objects and cargo.
AFI41-307 20 AUGUST 2003                                                                      125


   A6.2.4. Litter patients are allowed to carry eyeglasses, toothbrush, and a small amount of
   money (not to exceed $25.00), wedding band, rings, wristwatch, ID card, and wallet.
   A6.2.5. The patient and their hand-carried bags will be searched for sharps, matches, lighters
   and cig- arettes prior to enplaning; items not allowed will be inventoried, secured, and
   deplaned to the receiv- ing MTF. Use AF Form 3854, Receipt of Valuables.
   A6.2.6. Disposable eating utensils do not need to be removed for high-risk patients but
   should be inventoried when trays are collected.
   A6.2.7. Bed availability for meeting psychiatric in-patients’ Remaining Overnight (RON)
   require- ments in the AE system has greatly diminished. Higher acuity psychiatric patients,
   i.e., 1A or 1B, or alcohol abuse patients may require RON bed-down in off-base psychiatric
   facilities. Notify PMRC personnel of requirements in the event of unscheduled RON’s.
A6.3. Patient Classifications. Diagnosis, past history of extreme behavior, ability to cooperate
and understand direction, the potential for unannounced violent outbursts and the assessed risk to
flight safety, self and/or others, determines the patient’s classification.
   A6.3.1. 1A: Severe psychiatric litter patients requiring the use of physical restraints,
   sedation, and close supervision. See paragraph A6.5.2.1.6 for time-limited restraint
   guidelines.
       A6.3.1.1. The referring physician, the PMRC, the MA, and the MCD may determine the
       patient’s behavior is a high risk to flight safety.
       A6.3.1.2. The patient will be stabilized prior to AE movement based on the originating
       provider’s capabilities with appropriate psychiatric medications that will effectively
       control symptoms of extreme agitation and/or anxiety.
       A6.3.1.3. The originating physician will write orders for routine medication, as well as,
       PRN medication for breakthrough behavior while the patient is in the AE system.
       A6.3.1.4. Extremely high-risk psychiatric patients that may require advanced sedation
       manage- ment skills en route should travel with a physician.
       A6.3.1.5. Should travel in hospital garments.
       A6.3.1.6. Should travel with a MA.
   A6.3.2. 1B: Moderately severe psychiatric litter patient requiring tranquilizing medication
   or seda- tion for flight. Keep restraints available and secured on the litter or with the MA.

AE transport if the patient’s behavior is determined to be detrimental to self and others, the
patient has not been adequately prepared for AE movement, and therapeutic interventions are
ineffective. Document on AF Forms 3829/3830/3899 and DD Form 602. Notify
TACC/AMOCC/AOC/PMRC at time of refusal.
A6.4. Preflight/in-flight Considerations for Patients with Mental health/Behavior
Management Disorders.
   A6.4.1. Physical Factors: Age, cognitive level, sleep patterns, nutrition/hydration,
   elimination, touch, comfort, and physical activity.
       A6.4.1.1. Offer fluids and nutrition frequently, allow ambulation, sitting in “get up”
       seats, “stretch breaks” at en route stops, and comfort breaks.
   A6.4.2. Pathophysiological Factors: Drug interactions, substance abuses, dehydration,
   poor nutri- tion, underlying disease/illness, and metabolic and endocrine disturbances.
       A6.4.2.1. Correct underlying pathology (dehydration; alcohol and drug detoxification).
A6.4.2.2. Observe for and treat hypoxia.

       A6.4.2.3. Sedated patients may be more susceptible to dehydration and/or hypoxia, and
       aspiration during patient movement.
WARNING 1: Body temperature of 102° and above along with increased agitation while on
antip- sychotic medication may indicate neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). If symptoms
appear preflight, the patient is not stable; notify TACC/AMOCC/AOC/PMRC. If symptoms
appear in-flight, hold medication, document, and notify TACC/AMOCC/AOC/PMRC.
AFI41-307 20 AUGUST 2003                                                                        127


WARNING 2: High potency neuroleptics, such as Haldol, may cause extrapyramidal symptoms
(EPS) within hours or a few days after starting medication (See paragraph A6.6.7.2.1.). Medica-
tion side effects may also include cardiac irregularities, hypotension, respiratory suppression, and
over-sedation. If symptoms appear in-flight, hold medication, document, and notify TACC/
AMOCC/AOC/ PMRC for guidance and possible diversion to a MTF capable of handling the sit-
uation.

WARNING 3: If previously untreated EPS symptoms are present preflight, the patient is not
stable for flight. Notify TACC/AMOCC/AOC/PMRC.
       A6.4.2.4. Assure hydration and adequate nutrition.
       A6.4.2.5. Record intake and output if in restraints for more than 24 hours.
   A6.4.3. Psychological Factors: Anxiety/fear, fatigue, depression/grief, denial, boredom,
   communi- cation barriers, stress, post-traumatic stress, relocation/PCS, and socialization.
NOTE: History of physical or sexual abuse may affect individual reactions to physical contact
and place the individual at greater psychological risk.
       A6.4.3.1. Maintain line-of-sight or one-to-one observation for patients in restraints
       and/or with suicidal, homicidal or elopement precautions.
       A6.4.3.2. Use neutral or passive language.
       A6.4.3.3. Assign one AECM, preferably the same gender to act as the team leader. This
       caregiver will coordinate with the MCD and the MA should further interventions be
       required.
       A6.4.3.4. Give clear behavioral expectations and establish a verbal contract, including
       when medication or restraints will be used. Examples: Seatbelts, no smoking, “stretch
       breaks,” no access to the flight deck, and use of the lavatory.
       A6.4.3.5. Provide updated mission information.
       A6.4.3.6. Determine whether medication is effective or excessive. Document and
       communicate findings.
       A6.4.3.7. Facilitate feelings in a nonjudgmental manner and explore ways to help the
       individual to cope while in the AE system.
       A6.4.3.8. Offer fluids every two hours.
       A6.4.3.9. Use a language interpreter as needed.
   A6.4.4. Environmental Factors: Confined space, noise, lighting, positioning, temperature,
   aircraft systems, and personal items.
       A6.4.4.1. 1A patients will have line-of-sight observation when restraints are on.
       A6.4.4.2. All psychiatric patients should be identified to the medical crew.
       A6.4.4.3. Maintain cabin coverage, especially for suicidal and elopement risks.
A6.5. Management of Patients Requiring Restraints In the AE Environment.
 128                                                                 AFI41-307 20 AUGUST 2003


   A6.5.1. Purpose: The application of restraints is a response to emergent and dangerous
   behavior of the patient who is an immediate danger to self and others within the AE
   environment. The goal is to provide the safest, least restrictive, and most effective method for
   the patient while maintaining the safety of everyone in the airborne environment. Restraints
   will not be applied as punishment or for crew convenience. Whenever possible, use
   behavioral measures and medication first.
WARNING: When applying physical restraint, there is a potential to produce serious
consequences, such as physical and psychological harm, loss of dignity, violation of an
individual’s rights, and even death.
   A6.5.2. Preflight/In-flight Restraint Requirements.
       A6.5.2.1. Physicians will annotate orders on AF IMT 3899F, Patient Movement
       Physician Orders for Behavior Management and Restraints
           A6.5.2.1.1. Date and time order, and state when restraints will begin (i.e., prior to
           leaving for the flightline or boarding the aircraft).
           A6.5.2.1.2. Type of Restraint: 4 point or other; leather or soft; Posey belt; padded
           mitts. Restraints must accompany the patient and be provided by the originating
           facility.
           A6.5.2.1.3. Position: supine, prone, or lateral (left or right).
           A6.5.2.1.4. Justification for placement:
               A6.5.2.1.4.1. Danger to flight safety, self or others.
               A6.5.2.1.4.2. Too agitated/violent to administer sedatives.
               A6.5.2.1.4.3. Danger of dislodging vital therapeutic devices.
               A6.5.2.1.4.4. Other reasons determined by the physician.
           A6.5.2.1.5. The least restrictive means for providers to attempt: medication,
           education/coun- seling, and family involvement.
           A6.5.2.1.6. Physician Written Time-Limited Orders for Restraints.
               A6.5.2.1.6.1. Within 24 hours, restraints are limited to:
                   A6.5.2.1.6.1.1. Four (4) hours for adults.
                   A6.5.2.1.6.1.2. Two (2) hours for children and adolescents age 9 to 17.
                   A6.5.2.1.6.1.3. One (1) hour for patients under age 9.
NOTE: A physician will renew AE restraint orders every 24 hours. Refer to A6.7.
               A6.5.2.1.6.2. As a minimum, the MCD/FN caring for a patient during AE
               movement must observe a restrained patient for the initial period of the time-
               limited restraints described by age in paragraph A6.5.2.1.6.1 before considering
               any modification in the restraint plan. During these time limits, the MCD/FN may
               remove wrist restraints but not the ankle restraints. This is consistent with
               maintaining flight safety and facilitates patient feeding and other personal
               activities while the patient adapts to the AE environment. See para- graph
AFI41-307 20 AUGUST 2003                                                                        129


               A6.5.2.1.9 for early release criteria.
NOTE: The MCD/FN may determine a patient requires restraints or the patient requires the
continuation of restraints in the AE environment beyond the above time limits (Refer to
paragraph A6.6.5.1.). In either situation, the use of restraints will not exceed 24 hours. Notify
TACC/AMOCC/AOC/PMRC of the appli- cation of restraints within one hour. Document
application and continuation of restraints on AF Forms 3899/3829 and DD Form 602. Include
assessment, alternative measures taken, the reasons for application or continuation, and the
length of time restraints were on during the mission, including minimal level of observation
described below.
           A6.5.2.1.7. Level of Observation Required for Patients in Restraints. (See
           Paragraph A6.6.9 for managing patients at risk for dislodging vital therapeutic
           devices).
               A6.5.2.1.7.1. Every 15-minute circulation and neurological assessments of all
               extremities with devices, and safety checks. Minimal requirement.
               A6.5.2.1.7.2. Line-of-sight. Minimal requirement.
               A6.5.2.1.7.3. Other, as ordered per physician: One-to-One (the originating MTF
               will pro- vide a medical attendant to stay with the patient at all times).
           A6.5.2.1.8. Expected outcome for a patient in restraints (i.e., regains control, verbal
           contract or adequately sedated).
           A6.5.2.1.9. Early release and wrist restraint removal criteria for the FN, in
           conjunction with the medical attendant, includes, but is not limited to orientation to
           time, person and place, fol- lows and/or reads commands, ability to recall, calm
           affect, and no signs of agitation. Addition- ally, the individual reliably contracts for
           safety, accepts limits and is adequately sedated.
               A6.5.2.1.9.1. If the MCD’s reassessment concludes restraints are no longer
               needed, remove one extremity restraint at a time to check skin integrity and
               perform skin care to the area. Document findings and decision on AF Forms
               3899/3829 and DD Form 602.
NOTE: When restraint is terminated and the same behavior reoccurs, the original order may be
reapplied if alternative measures remain ineffective.
           A6.5.2.1.10. Medication to be given preflight, and PRN if behavior becomes
           unmanageable.
           A6.5.2.1.11. Intake and output for individuals in 4-point restraints more than 24
           hours.
           A6.5.2.1.12. Request for patient care team assessment at en route MTF for
           individuals in restraints more than 72 hours.
A6.6. Preflight/In-flight Considerations for the Application of Restraints.
   A6.6.1. 1A patients will have restraints on prior to boarding the aircraft; 1B patients will
   have restraints available on the litter or with the MA.
 130                                                                 AFI41-307 20 AUGUST 2003


   A6.6.2. Inspect short and long belts, and the wrist and ankle cuffs for cuts, tears, and
   excessive wear.
WARNING: Prior to flight, assure there are compatible/operable restraint keys available and
caregivers know placement; prior to take-off, ensure the restraint key is not bent and opens the
locking device.
   A6.6.3. An AECM formally trained and competent in the application of restraints, will
   coordinate with the MCD and the MA and act as the team leader. The team leader establishes
   and is responsible for patient interaction while en route.
   A6.6.4. The safest and least restrictive alternative methods for controlling violent and
   uncontrollable behavior in the AE environment will be utilized. These include but are not
   limited to:
       A6.6.4.1. Verbal de-escalation, verbal contract, explanation of consequences for not
       changing behavior, family intervention, and medication as ordered.
   A6.6.5. Perform a brief neurological exam. Rule out and treat hypoxia.
       A6.6.5.1. Assessment includes but is not limited to orientation to time, person and place,
       ability to follow commands or recall directions, reliably contracts for safety, accepts
       limits and if a danger to flight safety, self or others, too agitated/violent to administer
       sedatives.
   A6.6.6. When alternative measures are unsuccessful, the AECM team leader, in conjunction
   with the MCD and the MA, will:
       A6.6.6.1. Ensure the patient, the crew, and others are not in immediate danger.
       A6.6.6.2. Direct the notification of the flight crew to include securing access to the flight
       deck.
       A6.6.6.3. Make every effort to maintain the patient’s dignity and privacy.
       A6.6.6.4. Inform the patient and family member (if present) he/she is out of control, and
       the crew is assuming control until he/she is able to regain control.
   A6.6.7. Acute Exacerbation of Psychiatric or Behavior Disorders. If the patient is
   exhibiting aggressive and uncontrollable behavior, is extremely agitated and violent, and/or
   is determined to be a danger to flight safety, self or others on the aircraft, give PRN
   medication as ordered. If no PRN med- ication is ordered, give Haldol or Valium IAW the
   guidance below. Consult with the PMRC physician and TACC/AMOCC/AOC/ PMRC for
   guidance and possible diversion to a MTF capable of handling the situation and for further
   medical direction within one hour, if operationally feasible.
WARNING: Give either Haldol or Valium, not both.

NOTE 1: When ever possible, give medication first. If the patient is extremely violent, out of
control, and a threat to flight safety, follow paragraph A6.6.8. and then give medication.

NOTE 2: If this situation occurs prior to takeoff, the patient is not stable for flight. The patient
will be stabilized with medication prior to take-off in coordination with the
AFI41-307 20 AUGUST 2003                                                                      131


TACC/AMOCC/AOC/PMRC and/or local physician. The mission should not be delayed in order
to meet this requirement.
      A6.6.7.1. Perform a brief neurological exam. Rule out and treat hypoxia.
      A6.6.7.2. Give Haldol 2-5 mg IM to adults only if there is no known allergy or
      possibility of pregnancy. If severe behavior continues may repeat in 60 minutes for a total
      of 10 mg IM. Notify TACC/AMOCC/AOC/ PMRC for guidance and possible diversion
      to a MTF capable of handling the situation. Notify the PMRC physician within one hour
      of administration.
          A6.6.7.2.1. Side Effects: Opisthotonos, laryngeal dystonia, Parkinson-like symptoms,
          leth- argy, confusion, and exacerbation of psychotic symptoms; hyperpyrexia and
          heat stroke; tachycardia, hypotension/hypertension; anorexia; dry mouth and urinary
          retention. NOTE 1: May appear within hours or a few days after starting medication.
          NOTE 2: Restlessness, jit- ters, nervous energy and motor agitation may present as
          psychotic agitation; a brief preflight and recurring neurological exam is essential (See
          paragraph A6.6.5).
      A6.6.7.3. Use caution in pregnancy and if already receiving antipyschotic drugs.
      A6.6.7.4. Parkinson-like symptoms of weakness, fatigue, and absence of movement
      place the patient as risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pressure sores.
WARNING: Do not give Haldol to patients who have NMS or EPS symptoms (see paragraph
A6.4.2.3.), Parkinson disease or a high fever along with severe agitation. If NMS or EPS
symptoms appear after administration, contact a PMRC physician.
      A6.6.7.5. Give Valium 5-10 mg IM to adults, one time only , if there is no known
      allergy or possibility of pregnancy. Notify TACC/AMOCC/AOC/ PMRC for guidance
      and possible diver- sion to a MTF capable of handling the situation. Notify the PMRC
      physician within one hour of administration.
          A6.6.7.5.1. Side Effects: Respiratory depression, cardiovascular collapse, pain and
          phlebitis at injections site. Increased sedation when used with Phenobarbital.
          A6.6.7.5.2. Contraindicated in shock, myasthenia gravis, and glaucoma.
   A6.6.8. Application of Restraints to Control the Acute Exacerbation of Mental Health
   or Behavior Disorders.
      A6.6.8.1. A trained and competent FN, in coordination with the MA, may apply
      restraints to con- trol behavior of a patient who is immediate danger to self and others in
      the AE environment when alternative measures are unsuccessful using guidelines in
      paragraph A6.5 paragraph A6.6 and succeeding paragraphs in these sections.
      A6.6.8.2. At least two individuals current in AE restraint application will assist the team
      leader. These individuals work together to place the patient in restraints in a safe and
      timely manner and to reduce the patient’s distress and prevent injury. Medical personnel
      must recognize when addi- tional manpower is needed to protect the patient, crew and
      passengers.
132                                                             AFI41-307 20 AUGUST 2003

      A6.6.10.6. Complete DD Form 2852.
A6.7. Post Mission RON Requirements for Patients in Restraints.
   A6.7.1. The receiving MA will assume responsibility of the patient. In consultation with the
   MCD, this MA determines if restraints will be continued during transportation to the MTF.
   Restraints will not be placed for the convenience of the receiving facility. Continuity of care
   and patient dignity will be maintained en route to the receiving MTF.
   A6.7.2. A physician will perform a face-to-face reassessment of the patient to determine if
   restraints are to be continued for the next 24 hours while in the AE environment.
   A6.7.3. The physician at the RON site will review the FN’s determination to apply restraints
   and/or administer Haldol or Valium en route.
   A6.7.4. In extreme situations, restraints may be required for more than 72 hours in the AE
   environ- ment. If restraints are in use for more than 72 hours, an assessment by a psychiatric
   patient care team will occur before restraints are reordered for flight. If this is not possible,
   contact the PMRC for guid- ance.
A6.8. Post Traumatic Stress syndrome/Combat Fatigue.
   A6.8.1. Develops after experiencing a psychologically traumatic event outside the range of
   usual experience (combat, bombings, kidnapping); the individual re-experiences the event
   through recurrent dreams and flashbacks. Emotional numbness, detachment, and
   estrangement may be used to defend against anxiety. May experience sleep disturbances,
   hypervigilance, guilt about surviving, poor con- centration, and avoidance of the activities
   that trigger memory of the event.
   A6.8.2. Assess Signs and Symptoms (may be associated with other injuries: Tremors;
   profuse sweat- ing; dry mouth; tachycardia; shortness of breath and hyperventilation (rule out
   hypoxia). Irritability. Flat affect, staring, crying, and insomnia. NOTE: May exhibit violent
   and aggressive behavior while in the AE environment.

 TRIAGE/CONTINGENCY OPERATIONS (WAR, MOOTW, HOMELAND DEFENSE,
                      DISASTER RESPONSE)

A10.1. Triage.
   A10.1.1. A process of prioritizing medical care, treatment, and transportation of patients.
   A10.1.2. The purpose is to sort large numbers of victims, maximize limited resources, and
   do the most good for those able to survive and return to duty.
   A10.1.3. Triage is a dynamic and continuous process of assessment. The patient’s status can
   and does change after the initial triage.
   A10.1.4. Triage is performed at different intervals throughout the casualty evacuation and
   treatment sequences, including within the AE environment.
   A10.1.5. The process of triage is instituted when existing resources are overwhelmed and
   medical personnel are unable to render complete care to all of the victims, i.e. Mass Casualty
   Incident (MCI).
A10.2. Triage Categories.
   A10.2.1. Immediate (RED): Treatable life threatening injuries and /or wounds requiring
   stabilizing procedures of moderate to short duration, “To save life and limb.”
   A10.2.2. Delayed (YELLOW): Significant injuries requiring treatment, but can wait a few
   hours before definitive care is begun.
   A10.2.3. Minimal (GREEN): Minor injuries requiring cleaning, minimal debridement,
   tetanus tox- oid, and first aid. Some of these patients are treated and returned to duty, and
   often can help care for others. “Walking Wounded.”
   A10.2.4. Expectant: (Black/Blue). Extensive injuries where survival is unlikely even with
   medical interventions. Once the incident is controlled, medical care can then be considered
   for these patients.
A10.3. Factors Influencing Patient Transfer in Contingency Operations.
   A10.3.1. Tactical/contingency situation.
       A10.3.1.1. Availability of aircraft.
       A10.3.1.2. Area is safe or hostile for aircraft operations. The likelihood of conventional,
       chemi- cal, and biological attack will influence patient loading times.
       A10.3.1.3. Location of MTF and their capabilities may or may not be close to patients’
       originat- ing area.
       A10.3.1.4. MTFs may be limited in number, bed capacity, and critical resources
       necessitating rapid transport to the next level of care. Patients may be minimally
       stabilized or may require sta- bilization prior to flight.
          A10.3.1.4.1. Patients are Considered Stabilized for Flight When:
              A10.3.1.4.1.1. The airway is patent.

       illnesses.
       A10.5.1.2. May be delivered covertly or with other NBC or conventional weapons.
       A10.5.1.3. Known infectious agents or toxins were successfully controlled in natural
       outbreaks in the past. However, they may be genetically altered making known
       treatments ineffective.
       A10.5.1.4. May be difficult to differentiate between natural disease process and a
       biological agent. Suspect if there are numerous individuals experiencing similar
       symptoms.
       A10.5.1.5. Infected patients may be moved before clinical signs are present.
       A10.5.1.6. Epidemic outbreaks may occur 6-36 hours, even if decontaminated.
       A10.5.1.7. Incubation period for inhaled Anthrax spores is one-six days, depending upon
       the dose.
       A10.5.1.8. Separate victims of the attack from unexposed personnel.

         UNCONSCIOUS/KNOWN OR SUSPECTED NARCOTIC OVERDOSE

A11.1. Unconscious/Known or Suspected Narcotic Overdose. Various factors may lead to an
unsus- pected unconscious state or narcotic overdose in the AE environment. These factors may
include     hypoxia,    and       medication      self-administration   and/or     inadequate
communication/documentation.
   A11.1.1. Assessment.
       A11.1.1.1. ABCs.
       A11.1.1.2. Rule out hypoxia.
       A11.1.1.3. Refer to paragraph 3.3.7 Neurological Assessment and Table 3.1GCS.

                                 INFECTION CONTROL

A12.1. General Principles Of Infection Control.
   A12.1.1. The guidelines for personnel technique and recommended standards of patient care
   are con- tained in the most current Center for Disease Control (CDC) guidelines carried on
   each mission, and in local cleaning directives. Enhance local protocols by monitoring the
   CDC’s World Wide Web server at http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dhqp/index.html
   A12.1.2. All medical personnel in the AE environment will implement Standard Precautions
   coupled with Transmission Based Precautions and will keep aircrews informed, as required.
      A12.1.2.1. “Treatment of Biological Warfare Agent Casualties” is available for further
      guidance at https://kx.afms.mil/kxweb/dotmil/file/web/ctb_031091.pdf.
   A12.1.3. Brief all infectious patients and their attendants on isolation procedures and
   precautions.
   A12.1.4. Each aircraft and mission is unique. Environmental lighting in most cases will be
   poor, mak-ing the visualization and identification of blood in body fluids highly uncertain.
   The practice of infec-tion control within the AE setting will adhere to the following
   principles:
      A12.1.4.1. Standard Precautions will be used with every patient regardless of their
      diagnosis or presumed infection status (Refer to A12.2).
      A12.1.4.2. Treat all human blood and body fluids (BBF) as if known to be infectious for
      HIV, Hepatitis B virus, Hepatitis C virus, or other bloodborne pathogens.
      A12.1.4.3. The aircraft is considered a dirty environment. Do not change soiled
      dressings; rein- force only as needed.
      A12.1.4.4. Medical personnel with exudative lesions or weeping dermatitis will refrain
      from direct patient care and from handling patient care equipment/supplies until the
      condition resolves.
      A12.1.4.5. Artificial or long fingernails and chipped nail polish harbor bacteria and
      fungus, and are a risk to patient and personal safety. Individuals who chose to wear these
      items should be guided by professional conscience.
      A12.1.4.6. NOMEX/leather gloves will not be worn while administering patient care.
      A12.1.4.7. Eating, drinking, applying cosmetics, and handling contact lenses is
      prohibited in work areas where there is a likelihood of exposure to BBF.
      A12.1.4.8. Food and drinks are prohibited on countertops where blood/other potentially
      infected material is stored/placed. (EXCEPTION: On cargo aircraft this may not be
      feasible. Ensure the loadmaster/boom operator is notified of the storage/placement of
      such items, so they may dissem- inate the information to the rest of the crew).
   A12.1.5. Patient Assignment and Placement of Patients. NOTE: The airflow of each
   aircraft will govern litter and seat assignments. Refer to Table A12.1
 146                                                             AFI41-307 20 AUGUST 2003


       A12.1.5.1. When feasible, assign a single caregiver to infectious patients or to those who
       are at high-risk for infection. Avoid mixing infectious patients and those at high-risk for
       infection, when- ever possible.
       A12.1.5.2. High-risk patients, i.e., those particularly susceptible to infection (leukemia,
       cancer and post-op patients), must be located as far as possible from infectious patients.
       Consider the direction of airflow in the aircraft and having the high-risk patient wear the
       N-95 mask en route.
       A12.1.5.3. Known or suspected infectious patients should be in the lowest litter position.
       A12.1.5.4. Patients with known or suspected wound infections should not be placed in
       the same litter tier as patients with clean wounds.
       A12.1.5.5. Infectious ambulatory patients will be seated away from other patients if
       possible.
       A12.1.5.6. In the event of a large outbreak, patients who have active infections with the
       same dis-ease (e.g., TB, measles, tularemia, cholera, etc.) may be moved as groups
       (cohorted) in aircraft that meet safe ventilation and airflow requirements for Airborne
       Precautions. See paragraph A12.3.1 Airborne Precautions.
       A12.1.5.7. In austere ground operation settings with limited airflow (e.g., Ambus,
       Humvee, tent- age, etc.), the infectious patient will wear a N95 mask, if applicable (See
       paragraph A12.3 Trans- mission Precautions). The patient will be placed to the greatest
       extent possible downwind, near the airflow exit and away from other patients.
NOTE: When in confined areas and/or in areas with poor air circulation, both the patient and the
health care worker (HCW) will wear a N95 mask
A12.2. Standard Precautions.
   A12.2.1. Hands.
       A12.2.1.1. Handwashing is the single most important method for preventing the spread
       of infec- tion.
           A12.2.1.1.1. Handwashing will be accomplished with soap and running water, if
           available.
           A12.2.1.1.2. AE approved waterless hand cleaners/antiseptics may be used as an
           adjunct to routine handwashing or when handwashing facilities are inadequate,
           inaccessible, or when there is an interruption in the water supply. Waterless hand
           antiseptics may come in a foam, gel, or towelette. NOTE: If visible soiling is present
           on the hands, a towelette will offer the physical removal of the dirt and should be the
           first choice for hand antisepsis. Follow manu- facturer’s directions for use.
       A12.2.1.2. Wash hands before and after each patient contact; immediately after
       removing gloves or other personal protective attire (i.e., gowns, masks, goggles); before
       dispensing medications, performing invasive procedures, touching wounds or touching
       patients who are susceptible to infection; before serving meals; and after sneezing,
       coughing, eating, and performing personal hygiene.
AFI41-307 20 AUGUST 2003                                                                  147


  A12.2.2. Personal Protective Attire (PPA). Worn appropriate for the task, whenever
  exposure to BBF is anticipated.
     A12.2.2.1. Gloves.
        A12.2.2.1.1. Use disposable, single-use gloves.
        A12.2.2.1.2. Change gloves after contact with contaminated materials, even if care of
        that patient is not complete.
        A12.2.2.1.3. Change gloves between each patient.
        A12.2.2.1.4. Wear gloves while serving/handling unwrapped food.
        A12.2.2.1.5. Remove gloves promptly after use and before touching
        noncontaminated items/surfaces. Wash hands after removing gloves. A12.2.2.2.
        Gowns.
        A12.2.2.2.1. Fluid-repellent gowns are worn to protect skin and prevent soiling of
        clothing during procedures and patient care activities likely to generate splashes or
        sprays of BBF. In the event the health care worker’s (HCW) clothing is contaminated
        with BBF, a gown may be worn for a short duration to prevent cross-contamination.
        A12.2.2.2.2. Promptly discard BBF contaminated disposable gowns after use in
        designated biohazard trash bags.
     A12.2.2.3. Goggles and Masks.
        A12.2.2.3.1. Goggles, safety glasses with side shields or mask with a visor will be
        worn any- time splashing of BBF is anticipated. Normal eyeglasses are not
        considered protective apparel. When worn for PPA, masks and goggles protect the
        wearer from splashes or sprays of BBF.
        A12.2.2.3.2. Fluid resistant surgical masks are appropriate and will be changed when
        moist; as a general rule, change after two hours of wear or when wet.
        A12.2.2.3.3. The N95 respirator is approved for in-flight wear and will be worn by
        all care- givers when providing immediate care to a patient with a suspected or actual
        airborne trans- missible infection. Additionally, the N95 is worn by the patient for
        whom the disease is suspected.
           A12.2.2.3.3.1. The N95 mask will be fit-tested by a local Bioenvironmental
           Engineer or a certified fit-tester IAW AFOSHSTD 48-137, Respiratory Protection
           Program and local policy prior to wear by medical personnel. Accomplish fit
           testing for non-medical person- nel if it does not delay mission departure. NOTE:
           Per manufacturer’s guidelines, patients, mission and ground personnel who wear
           this mask do not require an official fit-testing but the medical aircrew member
           will evaluate the “fit” of the mask to the patient’s face, and assure there are no
           gaps or leaks.
           A12.2.2.3.3.2. All personnel and patients will change the N95 mask whenever
           wet or con- taminated with BBF, if the straps are loose or if the mask is damaged,
           and by personnel after completing direct patient care. NOTE: The N95 mask will
           not be reused once it is removed.
148                                                              AFI41-307 20 AUGUST 2003


      A12.2.2.4. Use a resuscitation mask or bag-valve mask to avoid mouth-to-mouth contact.
  A12.2.3. Needles and Syringes/Sharps.
      A12.2.3.1. Do not recap used needles. NOTE: Recapping is acceptable, if blood is drawn
      and no blood tubes are available; use a one-handed scoop technique. Secure the cap with
      tape. Follow paragraph A12.2.7
      A12.2.3.2. Do not bend or break needles.
      A12.2.3.3. Place needles in a puncture resistant container maintained as close to the
      point of use as possible.
      A12.2.3.4. After securing the sharps container in the closed position, off-load sharps
      container according to local policy.
  A12.2.4. Biohazardous Waste.
      A12.2.4.1. Biohazardous waste is defined as liquid or semi-liquid blood, or other
      potentially infectious materials; contaminated items that would release blood or other
      potentially infectious materials in a liquid or semi-liquid state if compressed; items that
      are caked with dried blood or other potentially infectious materials and are capable of
      releasing these materials during handling; contaminated sharps (see above for disposal of
      sharps); and pathological and microbiological wastes containing blood or other
      potentially infectious materials.
      A12.2.4.2. Place a red biohazard bag at the end of the patient’s litter, if BBF is expected.
      Biohaz- ard bags will not to be used for trash that is not contaminated with BBF waste.
      A12.2.4.3. Double-bag waste, if there is a potential for leakage.
      A12.2.4.4. Off-load with the patient for disposal at the local Medical Treatment Facility
      (MTF).
  A12.2.5. Linen.
      A12.2.5.1. All used linen will be handled as if potentially infectious.
      A12.2.5.2. Handle used linen as little as possible, with a minimum agitation, to prevent
      the poten- tial dissemination of microorganisms.
      A12.2.5.3. Place soiled linen in a clear plastic bag for off loading with the patient unless
      contam- inated with BBF, then follow paragraph A12.2.4
  A12.2.6. Urine and Feces.
      A12.2.6.1. Urine and feces from all patients, including those on isolation precautions,
      can be flushed down the aircraft toilet.
      A12.2.6.2. Disposable urinals are used as needed and discarded in the proper waste bag
      (Refer to para. A12.2.4).
      A12.2.6.3. The equipment table of allowances for bedpans is limited. Use of bedpans for
      several patients is accomplished by lining bedpans with a plastic bag and taping securely
      to prevent slip- page and spillage.
AFI41-307 20 AUGUST 2003                                                                        149

      BBF. A separate cooler will be available for storing blood products and specimens;
      follow packing instructions for temperature control.
NOTE: As a minimum, wear gloves. For suspected BW agents, wear full PPA (gown, gloves,
mask, and goggles).
      A12.2.7.2. Avoid contamination of the outside of the container. If contaminated, follow
      para- graph A12.2.8
      A12.2.7.3. All blood/body fluid specimen containers will be labeled with patient
      information and placed in a small biohazard bag or a zip-lock bag that has a biohazard
      label on it.
      A12.2.7.4. Do not place specimens in the refrigerator with medications or food.
   A12.2.8. Cleaning/Disinfecting. NOTE: Performed by AECMs.
      A12.2.8.1. Routine cleaning IAW CDC guidelines/recommendations of contaminated
      areas of the cabin that come in direct contact with patients will help prevent the spread of
      microorganisms.

         A12.2.9.2.2. NOTE: Some vials may appear to be multi-dose when, in fact, they are
         single dose (example: Normal Saline).
      A12.2.9.3. Sterile supplies - check prior to flight for expiration dates, tears, evidence of
      liquid spills, and/or color change.
         A12.2.9.3.1. Expired disposable items are not reprocessed.
AFI41-307 20 AUGUST 2003                                                                        151


           A12.2.9.3.2. Shelf life (sterility) is either event-related and/or time-related:
              A12.2.9.3.2.1. Event-related sterility means that as long as an “event” has not
              occurred to compromise sterility, the item is considered sterile. An event may
              include any of the fol- lowing: the package is torn, ripped open, dropped or
              compromised in a way that causes the healthcare worker to question the integrity
              of the contents.
              A12.2.9.3.2.2. Date-related sterility is based on the type of packaging and will
              have a tag with an expiration date.
       A12.2.9.4. Disposable items are not reused or reprocessed.
A12.3. Transmission Based Isolation Precautions. There are two tiers to isolation. The first is
the use of Standard Precautions as noted above in paragraph A12.2 for use with every patient
contact. The sec- ond tier is the Transmissions Based Precautions for isolating known or
suspected pathogenic microorgan- isms, communicable diseases, or colonized pathogenic
microorganisms. For further guidance, refer to “Treatment of Biological Warfare Agent
Casualties” (AFMAN 44-156). See paragraph A12.1.1
NOTES:
1. The following patient movements require coordination with the Theater Patient Movement
Center (PMRC) and Global Patient Movement Center (GPMRC), and notification of AMC/SG
and the CDC: Multi-drug resistant Mycobacterium Tuberculosis (MDR-TB), Congo Crimean
Hemor- rhagic Fever (CCHF), plague, smallpox, cholera, yellow fever, typhus, malaria, polio,
influenza, and any other diseases under special surveillance by the CDC.

2. GPMRC will notify AMC/SG/USTRANSCOM/SG and when applicable, the CDC.

3. Plague, smallpox, hemorrhagic fevers require approval of the destination country, over-flight
privileges, and approval of any country where the aircraft will land for servicing or where the
patient will remain over night. This information is found in the DOD Foreign Clearance Guide.
Coordination between the theater or USTRANSCOM commander/surgeon and the Department
of State is required. Refer to AFMAN(I) 44-146,1-21, and A12.3.1.
   A12.3.1. Airborne Precautions: Used in known or suspected infected patients with
   microorganisms transmitted by airborne droplet nuclei, small particle residue, 5µ (microns)
   or smaller, of evaporated droplets containing microorganisms that can remain suspended in
   air and can be widely dispersed by air currents or over a long distance. This includes any
   patient with suspected or confirmed TB, chicken pox, measles and disseminated zoster, as
   well as smallpox and during biowarfare/bioterrorism events.
       A12.3.1.1. Isolate to the greatest extent possible. Patient placement should be in a low
       traffic area, downwind in the airflow circulation cycle and near the aircraft’s airflow exit,
       if possible. The air- craft airflow (see Table A12.1) will determine patient placement.
       Minimum isolation require- ments are to position no other patients within ten-feet of the
       patient. Litter is optional and will be placed in the lowest position in the tier. Ambulatory
       patients should be seated next to the sidewall.

Notes:

Cabin air in military aircraft usually does not recirculate or mix with flight deck air mak- ing
HEPA filtering of air unnecessary. Cabin air in civilian aircraft may recirculate with flight deck
air with or without HEPA filtering.

2. There is mixing of cargo compartment air and flight deck air.

3. Dependent on engine speed, altitude and pressurization.

*AE adapted CDC recommendations for removal of TB airborne contaminates from isolation
rooms. Upon mission termination when indicated, all exits and doors are opened and the interior
of the aircraft is aired for the prescribed time. The aircraft air conditioning will be running at
maximum capacity during the airing out time period.

*** Recirculating fans in cargo compartment direct front to back when turned on, however the
air- flow directed aft is at the compartment ceiling and will eventually flow forward along the
cabin floor. In normal operations, cargo compartment air recirculates through a non-HEPA filter,
and then mixes with flight deck air. 100% ambient air (RAM Air) is available if required hen
“hi-flow” is selected on the cockpit environmental control panel.

**** 50% of cabin air recirculates with ambient air through a HEPA filter and does not mix with
flight deck air. 100% ambient air is available if required.

WARNING: Due to aircraft airflow characteristics (aft to forward) and the extreme risk of
transmission of infectious airborne agents to all on board personnel, the C-17, C-21 and C-130
will not be used unless all the criteria for safe transport, based on agent, are met. EXCEPTION:
in extreme instances, the theater surgeon and the director of theater airlift operations will
determine the use of the above aircraft for AE intratheater operations. Theater surgeons will

receive approval from destination MAJCOM/CC and MAJ- COM/SG, and the
USTRANSCOM/CC and USTRANSCOM/SG to use these aircraft during AE interthe- ater
operations. All passengers, patients, medical crew and other crewmembers on these missions will
wear a N95 mask throughout the mission, and will receive the recommended post-exposure
follow-up described in paragraph A12.3.1.5.4. NOTE: C-17 crewmembers in the flight deck and
crew rest areas may remove the N95 mask as long as the door to the cargo compartment is closed
and the environmental system is operating in the “high-flow” mode.
       A12.3.1.2. The CDC recommends the use of filtering devices that have N, P, or R series
       filters with minimum filter efficiency of 95 percent, such as the N95 filtering facepiece
       (N95 mask). Required protective procedures are outlined below:
           A12.3.1.2.1. The patient will wear a N95 mask at all times. This mask need not be fit
           tested but should not have noticeable gaps. Refer to paragraph A12.2.2.3.3.2
NOTE: Patients requiring airborne precautions and O2 may wear the N95 mask over the nasal
cannula (1-4 LPM). Patients requiring higher levels of O2 may require a cabin altitude restriction
or may wear a non-rebreather O2 mask.

WARNING: The lowest O2 percent of the non-rebreather mask is 60%, and the patient must be
able to tolerate high levels of O2 for the duration of the flight. This mask does not have HEPA
capability but has the smallest exhalation openings of the O2 masks. Patients using the non-
rebreather will be placed as close as possible to the aircraft’s exhalation port during the flight.
           A12.3.1.2.2. HCWs will wear a fit tested N95 mask while within ten feet of the
           patient and while providing direct patient care. Refer to paragraph A12.2.2.3.3.2
       A12.3.1.3. Unless directed by the theater director of air operations and the theater
       surgeon and/or USTRANSCOM/CC and USTRANSCOM/SG, other crewmembers,
       attendants and passengers do not require respiratory protection unless they are within ten
       feet of the patient. When within 10’ of the patient, the N95 mask for these individuals
       does not need to be fit tested but should not have noticeable gaps. Refer to paragraph
       A12.2.2.3.3.2
       A12.3.1.4. Strict AE Airborne Precautions. Some infectious agents and the patient’s
       overall clinical condition may require strict airborne precautions on a designated/devoted
       mission with limited crew and with no other patients or passengers on board.
       EXCEPTION: in extreme instances, the theater surgeon and the director of theater airlift
       operations will determine the use of the above aircraft for AE intratheater operations.
       Theater surgeons will receive approval from des- tination MAJCOM/CC and
       MAJCOM/SG, and the USTRANSCOM/CC and USTRANSCOM/SG to use these
       aircraft during AE intertheater operations. WARNING: MDR-TB and infectious ven-
       tilated patients pose the highest risk to the HCW, crew and passengers due to the
       potential for aerosolization of respiratory sections and droplet nuclei. NOTE: Consider
       regional medical intel- ligence reports and threats when validating and planning AE
       transport.
           A12.3.1.4.1. Use Standard and Strict Airborne Precautions. Move on a
           designated/devoted mission with limited crew and with no other patients or
           passengers on board. Refer to Table A12.1 Aircraft Airflow, WARNING.
 154                                                               AFI41-307 20 AUGUST 2003


               A12.3.1.4.1.1. The patient, medical attendants and all mission crewmembers
               (loadmaster, boom operator, etc.) in the cargo/passenger compartment will wear a
               N95 mask for the entire mission. HCWs will wear a fit tested N95 mask. The
               patient and crewmembers do not need to be fit tested for a N95 mask but the mask
               should not have noticeable gaps. Refer to paragraph A12.2.2.3.3.2 NOTE: The
               N95 mask will not be removed to eat or drink while in the cargo/passenger
               compartment. Mission planning should incorporate this requirement.
               A12.3.1.4.1.2. The flight deck crew in aircraft with forward to aft airflow do not
               require N95 masks unless in the cargo/passenger compartment; the N95 mask
               does not need to be fit tested but should not have noticeable gaps. Refer Table
               A12.1 and Refer to paragraph A12.2.2.3.3.2
               A12.3.1.4.1.3. The flight deck crew in aircraft with aft to forward airflow and
               aircraft with mixing of cargo/passenger compartment air and flight deck air will
               wear a N95 mask for the entire mission; the N95 mask does not need to be fit
               tested but should not have notice- able gaps. Refer to Table A12.1 and to
               paragraph A12.2.2.3.3.2 NOTE 1: The N95 mask will not be removed to eat or
               drink. Mission planning should incorporate this requirement. NOTE 2: C-17
               crewmembers in the flight deck and crew rest areas can remove the N95 mask as
               long as the door to the cargo compartment is closed and the environmental system
               is operating in the “high-flow” mode.
                   A12.3.1.4.1.3.1. The flight deck crew may optionally use the aircraft O2
                   supply and wear the aviator mask with the regulator set at 100%.
               A12.3.1.4.1.4. Ventilators will have a HEPA filter connected to the ventilator’s
               expiratory port. NOTE: High PEEP settings may not be possible using a HEPA
               filter. Refer to AMC AE Equipment Standards Guide.
                   A12.3.1.4.1.4.1. Secure ventilation tubing connections and use in-line
                   suctioning.
               A12.3.1.4.1.5. Upon mission termination, all exits and doors are opened and the
               interior of the aircraft is aired out after the mission is complete (Refer to Table
               A12.1). This may be done at home station but AECMs and all crewmembers must
               continue to wear masks until airing-out is complete.
                   A12.3.1.4.1.5.1. Cleaning of patient care area will occur as outlined in
                   paragraph A12.2.8
NOTES:

1. No one will enter the aircraft without a N95 filter mask until the aircraft is aired out. MCD
will coordinate N95 mask requirements with mission ground support personnel. Refer to
A12.2.2.3.3.2.

2. All mission personnel and medical personnel will follow-up after mission completion at their
local MTF or IAW local policy. Refer to A12.3.1.5.

           A12.3.1.10.1. Medical personnel transporting non-MDR TB patients, and all
           crewmembers and medical personnel transporting MDR-TB and ventilated TB
           patients will receive a IPPD 90 days post-mission at their local MTF or IAW local
           policy; results will be forwarded to the PMRC NLT 100 days post-mission. The
           PMRC will then review and forward personnel mis- sion data to AMC/SGP.
   A12.3.2. Droplet Precautions : Use with patients who have infections spread by large
   particle drop- lets generally larger than 5µ in size, generated by the infected patient during
   coughing, sneezing, talk- ing, or during respiratory-care procedures. This includes
   microorganisms such as pneumonic plague, tularemia, CCHF, rubella, diphtheria, mumps,
   pertussis, influenza, and adenovirus.
       A12.3.2.1. Spreads via droplets through the air by coughing, sneezing or talking.
       A12.3.2.2. Droplets can travel up to three feet.
       A12.3.2.3. Transmitted through mucosal surfaces (conjunctiva, nasal and oral mucosa).
       A12.3.2.4. Instruct the patient on the wear of the N95, the use and disposal of tissues in
       the appro-priate waste bag, and washing hands.
       A12.3.2.5. All caregivers and crewmembers within three feet of the patient care area will
       follow Standard, Droplet, and Contact Precautions (N95 mask, gown, gloves, and
       goggles).
       A12.3.2.6. Follow the guidelines for Airborne Precaution Guidelines to position on
       aircraft.
   A12.3.3. Contact Precautions : Use with patients who are infected or colonized by a
   microorganism that spreads by direct contact (skin to skin) or indirect contact (touch) with a
   contaminated object in patient’s environment. Examples include gastrointestinal (GI),
   respiratory, skin or wound infections, and antimicrobial resistant microorganisms such as
   vancomycin and methicillin resistant bacteria. Scabies, Pediculosis, and Acinetobacter
   baumannii are in this category. Follow Standard Precaution Guidelines. NOTE: Use N95
   mask, gown, and gloves when providing direct care.
       A12.3.3.1. Suspect Multi-Drug Resistant organisms in patients who sustained a wound
       during combat or while deployed, have been hospitalized more than one week, were in a
       critical care set- ting, are recovering from multiple trauma, and have indwelling catheters
       and multiple tubes.
       A12.3.3.2. A clean sheet or Chux may be placed over the wound site to prevent
       contamination of litter or seat.
NOTE: Treat all linens as infectious.
A12.4. Infection Control Special Interest Items
   A12.4.1. Vaccinia Patients
       A12.4.1.1. Vaccinia virus infections are complications of smallpox vaccination. This
       infection should not be confused with smallpox disease, caused by Variola virus. While
       Vaccinia is a contact transmission hazard (i.e. contagious), it is significantly less
       infectious and pathogenic than Variola (smallpox).
158                                                               AFI41-307 20 AUGUST 2003


      A12.4.1.2. Vaccinia patients are contact transmission               hazards   and    require
      standard/contact trans- mission-based precautions, including:
         A12.4.1.2.1. Thorough hand-washing after patient contact is the most important.
         A12.4.1.2.2. Wear of PPA (gloves, gowns, and, depending on lesion site, goggles).
         A12.4.1.2.3. Handle of BBF as infectious for bloodborne pathogens.
         A12.4.1.2.4. Terminal cleaning of the patient area.
         A12.4.1.2.5. There is no airborne/droplet threat so respiratory masks are not required.
         A12.4.1.2.6. A clean sheet or Chux will be placed over the site to prevent
         contamination of litter or seat, treat all linens as infectious.
      A12.4.1.3. Use contact precautions to protect personnel from vaccinia lesions. Flight
      crew and medical personnel not caring for vaccinia patients are not at risk nor required to
      be considered for post-mission screening.
      A12.4.1.4. For those directly caring for a vaccinia patient, the following additional
      screening cri- teria may be considered, but is not mandatory:
         A12.4.1.4.1. No immunosuppression due to medication or underlying medical
         condition.
         A12.4.1.4.2. No history of eczema, atopic dermatitis or active skin disease (including
         psoria- sis, moderately severe acne, and other forms of dermatitis).
         A12.4.1.4.3. Not pregnant or attempting to become pregnant.

         A12.4.1.4.5. Not breastfeeding
      A12.4.1.5. Recent smallpox vaccination is highly recommended for all medical
      personnel, including AECMs, CCATT’s and medical attendants directly caring for
      vaccinia patients to pre- vent complications of vaccination at unintended body sites (i.e.
      fingers, hands, face).
      A12.4.1.6. Vaccinia wounds must be covered, preferably with dry, cotton gauze
      dressings, and are reinforced in flight, as needed. Occlusive dressings should be avoided.
      Do not change dressings in-flight; reinforce only.
      A12.4.1.7. Requires dedicated PMI.
      A12.4.1.8. Minimize potential for cross-contamination of non-vaccinia patients. When
      feasible, assign a single caregiver. If operationally feasible, personnel caring for vaccinia
      patients should not be assigned to care for patients with the following medical conditions:
      immunosuppression, to include HIV, cancer, burns, sepsis, autoimmune disorders,
      trauma, steroid use, skin disease, preg- nancy, breast-feeding, or recent PRK.

Table A12.2. Rule Out Clinical (ROC) Indicators List for Highly Communicable Diseases.
The following five key indicators, if present, suggest a highly communicable infectious disease.
These patients may pose a serious disease threat to healthcare providers, aircrews, casual
contacts and receiving communities. These indicators are classified into five categories.
NOTE: A “YES” to Categories 2-5 should prompt immediate telephone consultation with the

Theater Validating Flight Surgeon. Category 1 alone does not necessarily require consultation.


1. POSITIVE HISTORY OF EXPOSURE PLUS ANY OF THE OTHER FOUR CATEGORIES.

• Exposure to sewage, body fluids, and animals prior to illness

• Report of insect bites


2. FEVER (Oral temperature greater or equal to 102 F or 38.9 C)

3. ABNORMAL BLEEDING

• Bleeding from gums or nose

• Petechiae on palate, throat, or on mouth exam

• Patient’s eyes are “bloodshot” in appearance (conjuctival injection)

• Bloody stools or vomitus


4. ADENOPATHY

• Tender or painful lymph nodes

• Report of lymph nodes with a “bruised” or darkened appearance

• “Matted lymph nodes,” “goose-egg” size lymph nodes or lymph nodes draining pus.
5. RAPID RESPIRATORY DECLINE, RASHES/SKIN CHANGES, UNUSUAL
DETERIORATION
• Rapid progression to severe symptoms and illness over a period of less than three days, once
the patient began to feel ill
• “Pox” or “pox-like” skin rash/lesion

• Petecchiae or purpura on the skin

hemorrhagic fever). •
 Icterus (yellow eyes, skin or tongue)

• Cough AND fever in conjunction with any of the following:

o Rapid disease progression or o Petechiae, purpura or
o Lymphadenopathy as described herein.

   A12.4.3. Severe Adult Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). For further information see
   http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/airtransport-sarspatients.htm.
NOTE: Transported on a dedicated mission with the minimum number of crew members IAW
A12.3.1.4. Strict AE Airborne Precautions.
       A12.4.3.1. If possible, place a N95 or surgical mask on the patient to contain droplets
       expelled during coughing. If this is not possible (i.e., would further compromise
       respiratory status, difficult for the patient to wear), have the patient cover the mouth/nose
       with tissue when coughing.
       A12.4.3.2. Oxygen delivery with a non-rebreather face mask may be used to provide
       oxygen sup- port during transport. If needed, positive-pressure ventilation should be
       performed using a resusci- tation bag-valve mask, preferably one equipped to provide
       HEPA or equivalent filtration of expired air. If a patient has been mechanically ventilated
       before transport, HEPA or equivalent fil- tration of airflow exhaust will be used.
       A12.4.3.3. Healthcare providers who directly handle a patient with SARS-CoV or who
       are in the compartment with the patient will wear PPE as recommended for Standard,
       Contact, and Airborne Precautions. This includes: Disposable isolation gown, gloves, eye
       protection, N95 mask.
           A12.4.3.3.1. Respiratory protection will be an N-95 mask or higher-level respirator
           A12.4.3.3.2. Personnel who will have no direct patient contact will wear an N-95 or
           higher-level respirator during transport. See A12.3.1 and A12.3.1.4
           A12.4.3.3.3. Personnel who also provide direct patient care (e.g., moving patients on
           stretch- ers) will wear the recommended PPE.
       A12.4.3.4. Follow A12.2.4 for the disposal of biohazard medical waste.

                             AE PATIENT SAFETY PROGRAM

A14.1. Scope. This chapter defines the requirements and responsibilities for the AE Patient
Safety Program (formerly called Clinical Performance (Quality) Improvement/Risk Management
Program). Each unit operating within the scope of the AE system will develop an active Patient
Safety program. This instruction applies to non-AE medical units, as well as AE units, because
non-AE military treatment facilities play various roles in AE patient care, e.g. patient
preparation, remain overnight (RON) care, or emergency/unplanned evaluation and treatment.
Associate ARC AE Units will coordinate programs with their active duty counterparts.

Improvement and Sentinel Events: Evaluating Cause and Planning Improvement, JCAHO,
1998; DoD Instruction 6025.17, Military Health System Patient Safety Program, 2001.
A14.3. Intent of Program. This instruction describes a “world-wide” AE Patient Safety
program administered at the AE squadron level. It provides a structure and process for engaging
all MAJCOMs, service components, Department of Defense (DoD) and Unified Commands to
support investigation, analysis and process improvement for AE patient safety. The program
should actively promote an environment that encourages event identification and remedial steps
to reduce the rate of future, recurring events. This environment includes minimization of
individual blame or retribution for those involved in an event or in the reporting of an event. The
focus is to establish an AE-wide patient safety program that uses internal and external knowledge
of events and errors to prevent the occurrence of errors and patient harm. All personnel assigned
to an AE unit supporting operational patient missions must be actively involved in these
programs, defining standards, documenting care, improving care, and ensuring standards are met
or exceeded. AMC/SG and DO as the AE lead, in coordination with other MAJCOMs, will use
trend data to adjust policies/procedures as needed to improve processes and patient care.
A14.4. Objectives of Patient Safety in AE. These include but are not limited to:
   A14.4.1. Ensure an acceptable standard of patient safety at all levels, when operationally
   feasible.
   A14.4.2. Provide ongoing and systematic approach for assuring the quality of patient care.
   A14.4.3. Reduce events that cause potential or actual patient harm through risk
   identification.

       chance or through timely intervention, but may have resulted in harm to a patient.
       A14.6.1.2. The boundaries of reporting AE events or near misses start with the PMRC
       clinical and administrative validation activities, extend through all phases of actual
       patient movement, and end with acceptance of custody of care at the final destination
       medical facility (civilian or military).
       A14.6.1.3. Guidelines for completing DD 2852 AE Event/Near Miss Report are
       identified IAW AFI41-313, Chapter 2, Aeromedical Evacuation Documentation.
AFI41-307 20 AUGUST 2003                                                                      171


       A14.6.1.4. Event Classifications. Capture not only events causing harm but also near
       misses that have a high potential for causing harm. There are six possible classifications
       for AE events. Based on the degree of harm or disability to the patient involved. These
       classifications are comparable to the Safety Assessment Code (SAC), which defines the
       severity of harm to the patient as a result of the event as well as the probability of the
       event recurring.

   A14.6.2. Reporting a Medical Class A or B event. These events result in definite and
   serious patient harm. Patient care and safety are paramount and will be managed before
   beginning the reporting process. Reporting of events occurs through the use of DD 2852
   Aeromedical Evacuation Event/Near Miss Report and will be completed and submitted to the
   PMRC and AE Patient Safety Manger within 24 hours of the event.
AFI41-307 20 AUGUST 2003                                                                   175


     A14.6.2.1. An event can be reported by anyone who is aware of it. The reporting person
     should:
     A14.6.2.2. Notify TACC/XOGA for AMC missions and Air Medical Operations Cell
     (AMOC) for theater missions. The C2 agency will notify the regulating PMRC. This
     communication should be accomplished in the most expedient manner available, e.g.
     radio communication, telephone, fax or email.
     A14.6.2.3. The MCD is responsible for obtaining copies of patient care documentation
     contained on a DD Form 602, Patient Evacuation Tag, DD Form 1380, US Field Medical
     Card or AF Form 3899, Aeromedical Evacuation Patient Record. Originals of any form
     documenting patient care will always accompany the patient but, when feasible, copies
     should also be forwarded to the Unit QA representative and the PMRC.
     A14.6.2.4. Notify unit per local procedure. All verbal notifications will be followed up
     with written documentation of the event using DD 2852 AE Event/Near Miss Report.
     NOTE: Do not refer to any forms such as the DD 2852 AE Event/Near Miss Report in
     patient records. The information contained in these forms is protected from disclosure
     under 10 U.S.C. 1102.
     A14.6.2.5. The Unit Quality Manager or designee will input the information from the
     DD 2852 into the AE Patient Safety database, within 24 hours of receipt. Units will
     maintain the original DD2852 AE Event/Near Miss Report for one year. All copies of AE
     Event/Near Miss Report must be reviewed and approved by the Unit Commander prior to
     leaving the unit.
     A14.6.2.6. PMRC Medical Class A or B event response. The regulating PMRC, upon
     notification of Medical Class A or B event, will do the following: provide medical
     direction/immediate    assistance  and   make     notifications  as   needed    to
     TACC/AMOC/Validating Flight Surgeon (VFS)/receiving and/or originating MTF.
     A14.6.2.7. Within 3 hrs of notification of a Medical Class A or B event, the PMRC will
     collect and review all internal PMRC records regarding validation prior to movement.
     Special emphasis should be placed on gathering printouts of the TRAC2ES audit history,
     the patient movement record (PMR), all internal notes, daily log entries, mission tracking
     records, and memoranda by PMRC personnel involved with validation of the movement.
     A14.6.2.8. The PMRC will develop policy for responding to requests for assistance
     during any AE event class.
     A14.6.2.9. Upon notification of a Medical Class A or B Event, the theater MAJCOM
     (AMC, PACAF, USAFE) Surgeons office will, within 7 calendar days of notification,
     decide the level of investigation necessary for this event. The MAJCOM/SG can make
     one of the following decisions:
        A14.6.2.9.1. Medical Incident Investigation (MII).            If the event warrants
        investigation, but does not meet the criteria for a MII, the MAJCOM/SG may refer to
        the Theater AE Medical Director to conduct an AE Event Review as described in
        paragraph 14.7.
        A14.6.2.9.2. If the event occurred intra-theater and meets criteria for an MII, the
        MAJCOM/SG will initiate the investigation process. If the event crosses service
 176                                                            AFI41-307 20 AUGUST 2003


           lines, the MAJCOM/SG may refer this investigation to the Unified Command
           Surgeon.
           A14.6.2.9.3. If the event occurred inter-theater and meets criteria for an MII, the
           MAJCOM/SG will refer the investigation to AMC/SG. If the event crosses service
           lines, AMC/SG may refer this investigation to the USTRANSCOM/SG.
   A14.6.3. MAJCOM/SG will forward event notification and determined level of investigation
   to AMC/SG.
       A14.6.4. In most cases, a Medical Class A , B, or C event will result in either an AE
       event review and/or an AE MII. Either investigative process should ideally be initiated
       within 10 calendar days of the incident.
A14.7. AE Event Review. Provides a less formal review than an MII of an AE Event. AE
event reviews serve as preliminary analyses of the circumstances surrounding an AE event.
Perishable data must be captured without delay, recognizing the difficulty across time zones and
geography in contacting medical treatment facilities, AE crews, and controlling agencies. The
picture of events developed by an AE Event review aids the MAJCOM Surgeon’s decision-
making regarding the requirement to convene more formal reviews or initiate the corrective AE
system actions to prevent a recurrence. AE event reviews are protected from disclosure under 10
U.S.C. 1102.
   A14.7.1. Authority. The MAJCOM, as well as the Theater AE Medical Director or Theater
   AE Quality Manager, can direct an AE event review of a any class event even if that event
   does not meet MII criteria.
       A14.7.1.1. Separate from a MAJCOM-directed review, a Unit Commander can direct a
       unit-level AE Event Review at any time, for any event. The information gained would
       lead to local unit process improvement and if findings have system-wide implications,
       would be forwarded up the AE chain for dissemination.
   A14.7.2. AE Event Review Process. Refer to Addenda C for a flowchart of the AE
   Event/Near Miss review process, which also includes the medical incident review reporting
   process. The AE event review should be structured much like the Root Cause Analysis for
   sentinel events as described in AFI 44-119, Clinical Performance Improvement.
       A14.7.2.1. The Theater AE Medical Director and/or the Theater AE Patient Safety
       Manager will appoint an AE event review team to conduct a primary assessment of a
       Medical Class A or B event on behalf of the Theater Surgeon. The Theater PMRC and
       theater air component medical units will support the AE event review team takings, as
       directed by the Theater Surgeon or his/her designated convening authority.
       A14.7.2.2. AE Event Review Team. This multidisciplinary team should consist of
       personnel from clinical and functional areas related to the event. The core functional
       areas of the team should consist of team leadership, flight medicine, and flight nursing.
       Efforts should be made to identify personnel who can represent AE execution (TACC or
       AMOC), requirements validation, and clinical specialization related to the patient’s
       condition when selecting team members to review the AE medical event.
       A14.7.2.3. MAJCOM-directed AE event reviews should be completed and forwarded to
       MAJCOM/SG within 45 days of the initial notification of event.
AFI41-307 20 AUGUST 2003                                                                     177


       A14.7.2.4. Unit Commanders will forward AE Event Review Reports on Medical Class
       A through F events to the USTRANSCOM/AMC AE Patient Safety Manager for data
       collection and trending. The AE Patient Safety Tool is a centralized database that
       provides Unit Commanders and representatives, MAJCOM QA and PMRC’s the ability
       to review investigations, results, and process improvements associated with specific
       events.
       A14.7.2.5. Implement the system and process improvements in the final AE Event
       Review Report.
   A14.7.3. The AE Event Review Team will: Provide an in-depth review of all class A, B, C
   events, focusing on potential system or process problems and prepare a final review report
   with action plan and evaluation methodology. The AE event review team will consist of at a
   minimum the AE patient safety manager, AMC-VFS and other members as required.
       A14.7.3.1. Develop an action plan to make system or process improvements.             The
       review team may also determine that no such improvement opportunity exists.
       A14.7.3.2. Design a method to evaluate the effectiveness of the recommended
       improvements.
       A14.7.3.3. In some instances, an AE event review may occur concurrently with an MII.
       When this occurs, the two investigative teams will work in coordination to minimize
       duplicate efforts. If an AE MII occurs after an AE event review, the final review report
       will be made available to the MII Team.
       A14.7.3.4. MAJCOM/SG will: review and approve all final MAJCOM directed AE
       Event Review Reports.
       A14.7.3.5. Forward copies of final AE event review reports to USTRANSCOM/AMC
       AE Patient Safety Manager for data collection and trending.
       A14.7.3.6. USTRANSOM/AMC AE Patient Safety Manager will review all AE event
       review reports and disseminate applicable system-wide lessons learned, through
       AFMOA, the DO community or other avenues as required.
A14.8. AE Medical Incident Investigation (MII). The investigative and event analysis
purpose of an AE event review and a MII are similar. An MII may be considered for any AE
event and is convened when an AE event occurs and an objective evaluation cannot be
completed at the affected unit level and/or the event involves multiple services, geographical
locations or units.
   A14.8.1. An AE MII is a global and in-depth review of an AE event to evaluate a system of
   care. The primary focus of the AE MII is on how or if the AE system contributed to the
   outcome; however, investigators are not restricted from commenting on the appropriateness
   of care delivered by individual providers or services.
       A14.8.1.1. AE MIIs are protected from disclosure under 10 U.S.C. 1102, which is the
       Federal statute that states DOD quality assurance records are confidential and privileged.
   A14.8.2. Authority. MAJCOM/SG can direct an AE MII for any AE event that occurs in
   their theater of responsibility. AMC/SG is the authority for MIIs pertaining to events that
   occur between theaters in coordination with the MAJCOM/CCs of the involved AORs.
 178                                                             AFI41-307 20 AUGUST 2003


   A14.8.3. Refer to AFI 44-119, Chapter 8 for specific guidelines on the AF MII process.
   Major differences between an MTF and AE MII exist and must be considered. An AE MII
   may involve multiple geographical locations, services, and systems of care, which may
   complicate and significantly lengthen the investigative process.
   A14.8.4. MAJCOM/SG reviews and approves or disapproves the final AE MII report.
   USTRANSCOM/AMC SG is notified of results prior to MAJCOM/SG briefing HQ
   USAF/SG or AFMOA/CC.

   while preventing food-borne diseases. NOTE: Patients with a history of extensive trauma
   and illness are more suscep- tible to food-borne diseases.
      A15.1.1.1. The process starts at the originating Medical Treatment Facility (MTF) and
      continues with the en route Aeromedical Staging Facilities (ASF), Mobile and
      Contingency Air Staging Facilities (MASF/CASF), and Aeromedical Evacuation
      Crewmembers (AECMs). Assessment includes significant nutritional risk, food
      allergies/intolerances, special dietary needs, and nutri- tion education needs.
   A15.1.2. Originating and/or en route joint base operating support (BOS) and contracting
   food ser- vices, flight kitchens, and MTFs provide meals, snacks, and beverages for patients
   and attendants in the PM/AE system.
      A15.1.2.1. In some instances, the availability of food items is highly dependant on prime
      vendor sources and the location’s contingency and sustained BOS capabilities.
      A15.1.2.2. Dietitians and/or diet therapy technicians may not be available to monitor all
      aspects of dietetic/nutritional support and food safety, and the local nursing personnel,
      Public Health Officer (PHO), and/or Flight Surgeon (FS) may be required to provide
      support and oversight. Refer to AFMAN 44-144, Nutritional Medicine.
      A15.1.2.3. Procedures for feeding patients during peacetime, contingency, and disaster
      operations will vary at each location. Use AF Form 812, Meal Order Record, AF Form
      1094, Diet Order, memorandums of understanding (MOUs), other AF Services Agency
      forms, and/or instructions on food selection based on dietary requirements.
NOTE: Notify the supporting Command and Control (C2) of significant impact/delays due to
inadequate dietetic support and/or food safety issues. Complete DD Form 2852, Aeromedical
Evacuation Event/ Near Miss Report. Provide detailed information on AF 3829, Summary of
Patients Evacuated by Air, if indicated.
A15.2. Responsibilities
   A15.2.1. Sending or En Route Physician. Physicians write diet orders, including tube
   feedings on AF Form 3899, Aeromedical Evacuation Patient Record, which serves as the
   source document for all diet orders. At locations where there is no dietary/nutritional
   medicine support, the local FS may be required to provide food safety oversight.

          A15.2.8.6.1. Meal Times: 0600-0800, 1100-1300, 1700-1900. Times may be
          adjusted to the destination time zone if there are no contraindications.
          A15.2.8.6.2. Special diets are usually served first. Provide hot meals at scheduled
          meal times when operationally feasible.
          A15.2.8.6.3. Time between the evening and breakfast meals will not exceed l5 hours.
          A15.2.8.6.4. When operationally feasible, patients will be fed prior to patient care
          handoffs, ground/aircraft departure and arrival, and if delay in feeding is anticipated
          due to operational constraints. Note: Consider sending a cold or shelf-stable meal
          with the patient if meal and transportation times overlap.
A15.3. Patient Diet Orders
   A15.3.1. In-Flight Meals for Patients with Regular Diets. Supporting food services and
   MTFs at installations where flights originate will fill orders received from the Patient
   Movement Requirement Center (PMRC), AE element, and/or ASF/MASF/CASF personnel.
      A15.3.1.1. Whenever possible, provide shelf-stable food that does not require
      refrigeration and heating.
      A15.3.1.2. Meals Ready to Eat (MRE). Use MREs during contingency operations if
      other food is unavailable. Provide MREs and snacks for meals during the entire flight.
      For              MRE                diabetic            exchanges,                 see
      https://kx.afms.mil/kxweb/dotmil/file/web/ctb_077841.pdf
   A15.3.2. Therapeutic In-flight Meals (TIMs)/Special Diets. MTFs, where AE flights
   originate, provide TIMs or “special diets” according to the appropriate menu plan. During
   contingency opera- tions, UTC medical personnel may be required to select appropriate food
   items at local BOS food ser- vices.
      A15.3.2.1. TIM/special diet requests should arrive at the MTF or BOS food services no
      later than 2 hours before the aircraft’s scheduled departure time or IAW local policy.
      Submit all diet orders according to the TRAC2ES. Current TRAC2ES diets are: bland,
      diabetic, liquid, low fat, NPO, other, regular, renal soft, and tube feeding.
 182                                                                  AFI41-307 20 AUGUST 2003


         A15.3.2.2. Diet orders include:
             A15.3.2.2.1. Prudent/Healthy. Despite the large variation in ordering capabilities,
             MTFs often provide a frozen heart-smart commercial meal to meet the diet
             modification for most diet orders. The heart-smart frozen meals meet therapeutic diet
             restrictions and are convenient for use in flights with heating and refrigeration
             capability. A “Prudent/Healthy” diet can take the place of diabetic, low fat, regular,
             bland, and renal diets. This is appropriate since these healthy frozen meals are
             moderate in carbohydrates, protein, and lower in fat, sodium, and potassium.
             A15.3.2.2.2. Renal
             A15.3.2.2.3. Dental Soft

A15.4. Preparing Patient Diets
   A15.4.1. Prepare all diets according to the current American Dietetic Association (ADA)
   Nutrition Care Manual and locally approved therapeutic menu patterns. Additional menu
   patterns and refer- ences can be found at the Knowledge Exchange Nutritional Medicine
   Knowledge Junction website.
   A15.4.2. Check regular and therapeutic menus prior to serving to ensure nutritional
   adequacy/ accu- racy. At a minimum, the regular and TIM/special diet menus should be
   compared to the Food Guide Pyramid for nutritional adequacy. See Figure 15.3 below.
   A15.4.3. When operationally feasible, offer a selection of lower-fat entrees and salad
   dressing, whole grain breads, 2 percent (or less) fat milk, and margarine as standard items for
   all regular and soft diets. Whole milk should be offered on 1-3 year old preschool child
 184                                                                AFI41-307 20 AUGUST 2003


   menus. Vitamin C-rich food should be offered daily and Vitamin A-rich foods should be
   offered every other day.

Table A15.3. Major Food Groups and Suggested Daily Intake.




   A15.4.4. Infant/Child Meals. Request food items by specifying the child’s age on the diet
   order request. Pediatric nutrition needs assessment/screening criteria should include an
   assessment of weight for age, weight loss, special dietary needs, food allergies, chronic
   illnesses, and nutrition edu- cation needs.
   A15.4.5. Packing Meals
       A15.4.5.1. Meal Sizes. Keep the entire meal as small as possible due to limited storage
       space aboard the aircraft and other transportation assets.
       A15.4.5.2. Label. Label the box containing the meal and snack with the following
       information: Name, diet, flight #, station enplaned, preparation date, and time.
       A15.4.5.3. Diabetic Snacks. Pack diabetic snacks separately, sealed in a bag. These
       may be placed in the same box with the meal, however, clearly label these packages as
       snacks and indicate the time they should be eaten.
       A15.4.5.4. Packing Patient Meals and TIMs/Special Diets. If operationally feasible
       and avail- able, pack in insulated containers, with ice , and deliver to the patient departure
       point for loading onto the aircraft or transportation asset. NOTE: Consume meals or
       discard non-processed patient food items within four hours.
A15.5. Planning En Route Meal Requirements
   A15.5.1. Refer to TRAC2ES Lift Bed Plan, Manifest, TIM/Special Diet List, Table
   A15.3andA15.4 to determine the number and type of meals for each mission.

NOTES:

1. Shelf stable and does not require refrigeration.

2. Includes sandwiches. Considered “safe” to consume within 4 hours of issue from a food ser-
vice facility if not stored in a refrigerator at or below 41º F. Avoid using mayonnaise.

3. Only when no other shelf-stable food is available.
A15.6. Maintaining Food Safety
   A15.6.1. Dysentery and food-borne illness are a threat to the health of all personnel. Patients
   who are compromised have an increased risk for food-borne illness. Personal hygiene, food
   safety, and sanita- tion practices are critical for all personnel responsible for patient feeding.
   Follow safe food handling practices and limit access to food preparation areas. Refer to
   Infection Control, A12.1
186                                                              AFI41-307 20 AUGUST 2003


  A15.6.2. At operationally feasible locations, potentially hazardous/non-processed foods
  (meat, eggs and milk products) will be maintained either below 41º F or above 140º F in
  order to remain safe. NOTE: Meals containing non-processed food items will be consumed
  within 4 hours or discarded.
  A15.6.3. To minimize risk for food-borne illness, use commercially prepared shelf-stable
  food avail- able through local prime vendor sources whenever possible. MREs are used if
  other shelf-stable food is unavailable.
  A15.6.4. Depending on the location, water and ice sources may not be adequate, so bottled
  water will be required. Follow commander’s OPORD and/or local directives.
 A15.6.5. MASFs, CASFs, ground transportation vehicles, and aircraft may lack adequate
 equipment to store food at safe temperatures.
  A15.6.6. Insulated Containers, Coolers, and Tray Transportation Systems
      A15.6.6.1. When operationally feasible and available, insulated containers or coolers are
      prima- rily used for transport and short-term storage of meals and beverages containing
      cold or hot, non-processed foods (meat, eggs and milk products). NOTE: Unsealed food
      items, medications, and blood products are prohibited. Refer to Infection Control,
      A12.1.4.8
      A15.6.6.2. Usually there is no temperature reading device or power associated with these
      units, making it difficult to know how well the temperature is being maintained.
      Temperatures are not evenly distributed. NOTE: Regardless if using wet or dry ice,
      consume or discard non-processed patient food items within 4 hours of controlled
      refrigeration.
      A15.6.6.3. Ensure clean food transportation containers (ground/aircraft) pre and post use.
  A15.6.7. Storage of unsealed food items, medications, and blood products is prohibited.
  Refer to Infection Control, A12.1.4.8

       EN ROUTE PATIENT MOVEMENT/AEROMEDICAL EVACUATION PAIN
                            MANAGEMENT

A16.1. En Route       Patient    Movement      (PM)/Aeromedical       Evacuation    (AE)    Pain
Management.
   A16.1.1. Pain is a complex experience with multiple dimensions and is always subjective.
Pain is defined by the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) as an unpleasant
sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described
in terms of such damage. NOTE: The ability to communicate effectively in a verbally form may
be diminished while an individual is experiencing pain and is in need of appropriate pain-
relieving treatment.
       A16.1.1.1. Under treated and poorly managed pain may lead to adverse physical and
       psychologi- cal consequences and complications such as pneumonia, deep vein
       thrombosis (DVT), delayed recovery and/or progression to chronic pain. Chronic pain
       diminishes one’s qual- ity of life.
   A16.1.2. The goal of administering any type of medication or treatment in the PM/AE
   system is to maintain continuity of care from the originating medical treatment facility
   (MTF) to the destination MTF. NOTE: Every patient has a right to consistent and appropriate
   assess- ment and adequate pain management to deal with the stresses of the PM/AE
   environment.
A16.2. Stresses of Transport and Flight. Refer to Chapter 2 for detailed discussion.
   A16.2.1. Decreased partial pressure of oxygen: Decreases tissue oxygen availability and will
   exacer- bate oxygenation deficiencies due to preexisting hypoxias related to injury, disease,
   and/or treatment. May exacerbate the CNS effects of pain medication.
   A16.2.2. Barometric Pressure Changes: Gas expansion in the abdominal cavity at cruise
   altitude may lead to crowding of the diaphragm increasing pain and splinting. Splinting and
   diaphragmatic crowd- ing decreases lung volume and expansion, and may exacerbate the risk
   of hypoxia. Consider placing a nasogastric tube.
   A16.2.3. Thermal: Cold temperatures may lead to vasoconstriction, shivering and
   exacerbated pain. Keep patient warm and limit exposure to cold temperatures.
   A16.2.4. Vibration/Turbulence: Increases muscle activity, metabolic rate, and peripheral
   vasocon- striction. Avoid excessive speed of ground transportation assets. Secure patients
   away from the bulk- head and floor of ground vehicles and aircraft, encourage and assist with
   position changes, and provide adequate padding and skin care, especially for orthopedic
   patients with internal/external fix- ators.
A16.2.5. Gravitational Forces: Seat belts in side facing and rear facing seats may cause injury
during acceleration/deceleration; use extra padding between abdomen and seat belt for patients
with abdom- inal surgery.
AFI41-307 20 AUGUST 2003                                                                         189


   A16.2.6. Fatigue: Exacerbates the patient’s underlying condition/diagnosis due to the overall
   effect of previously mentioned stresses of flight, and length of time the patient has been in
   the PM/AE system.
A16.3. Indicators of Pain by Hierarchy:
   A16.3.1. Patient self-report – single most reliable measure of intensity of pain.
   A16.3.2. Pathological conditions or procedures known to be painful.
   A16.3.3. Observed pain-related behaviors (grimacing, restlessness, vocalization, groaning).
   A16.3.4. Reports of pain by family or attendant.
   A16.3.5. Physiological changes (increased pulse and blood pressure).
A16.4. Assessment : WARNING: When assessing pain, always rule out and treat life
threatening condi- tions, such as cardiac pain/pulmonary embolism
   A16.4.1. Obtain vital signs, including pulse oximetry and assess pain at least every 4 hours
   for patients who require en route pain medication administration. NOTE: Take into
   consideration the type of medication, time of onset based on route, and duration of known
   effectiveness.
      A16.4.1.1. Rule out hypoxia (Table 2.1) and compartment syndrome (10.2.2.9).
   A16.4.2. Ascertain the patient’s pain level and their acceptable level of pain. The acceptable
   level of pain is the level of pain the patient is willing to tolerate. Respect the patient’s self-
   report of pain.
      A16.4.2.1. Have the patient rate pain on a numerical scale of 0 – 10 with 0 being no pain,
      1 being the least and 10 being the worse pain possible. Use patient numerical scale
      verbalization or the Wong-Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale (Figure A16.1).

Figure A16.1. Wong-Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale (From Wong D.L., Hockenberry-
Eaton M., Wilson D., Winkelstein M.L., Schwartz P.: Wong's Essentials of Pediatric
Nursing, ed. 6, St. Louis, 2001, p. 1301. Copyrighted by Mosby, Inc.).




          A16.4.2.1.1. Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale (Figure A16.1) is the pain rating
          scale recommend for persons age 3 years and older.
              A16.4.2.1.2. Explain to the person that each face is for a person who has no pain
              (hurt) or some, or a lot of pain. Face 0 doesn't hurt at all. Face 2 hurts just a little
              bit. Face 4 hurts a little more. Face 6 hurts even more. Face 8 hurts a whole lot.
              Face 10 hurts as much as you can imagine, although you don't have to be crying
 190                                                                AFI41-307 20 AUGUST 2003


               to have this worst pain. Ask the per- son to choose the face that best describes
               how much pain he/she has.
NOTE: Once the best pain grading approach is found for a given patient, document and
communicate this scale to en route/in- flight healthcare providers to maintain consistency
between evaluations.
   A16.4.3. Refer to 7.4.1, and document on AF IMT 3899A and 3899I (reverse). Note the
   patient’s self-reported pain as, ‘verbalizes pain scale as “X/10”’ or ‘chooses Wong-Baker
   FACES pain scale “X/10.”’
   A16.4.4. Assess patient understanding and educate patient and staff on the patient’s
   acceptable level of pain and the availability of medications.
   A16.4.5. A pain score of 3 or more usually indicates the need for pain medication.
   A16.4.6. Ascertain characteristics of pain: quality, region, radiation, what provokes/triggers
   (move- ment/dressing changes/deep breathing and coughing), palliates/eases
   (repositioning/elevation/sup- port/medication), and the adequacy and adverse effects of pain
   medication.
A16.5. Assess cultural attitudes, stoicism, guilt, and potential frustration and helplessness,
mental functioning, mood, and fear of pain.
A16.5.1. Educate patients, family and attendants regarding reporting pain and availability of
pain medication, as well as, the low risk of addiction from long-term use and/or high doses of
medication for pain relief, and document on AF Form 3899I (reverse). NOTE: Include
information about prn medications being available around-the-clock.

A16.6. Barriers to Communicating Pain. Infants/children, emotional or cognitive disorders,
cultural, educational or language barriers; artificial airway; sedated/ventilated, and seriously ill.
A16.6.1. Utilize a rating scale (Wong-Backer Faces), interpreter, and medical attendant/family
mem- ber.

A16.6.2. Note the patient’s body position, facial expressions, posture and any guarding or self-
protec- tion movements. Note rate and depth of respirations, and color. Observe for stiffness,
rigidity, or flac- cid muscles.

A16.6.3. For children under the age of 3 and infants, note crying, moaning, arched/rigid torso,
grab- bing/touching wound, extremities tense or pulled up, kicking/squirming, and the
physiological changes of increased pulse and blood pressure.

A16.7. Treatment/Management: NOTE: Document all known allergies on the AF IMT 3899
series
   A16.7.1. Administer pain medication as ordered prior to potential painful events such as
   transporta- tion movement and en route staging treatments and dressing changes. Take into
   consideration the type of pain medication, time of onset based on route, and duration of
   known effectiveness. For example, opioid analgesic onset is immediate when administered
AFI41-307 20 AUGUST 2003                                                                         191


   intravenously, and rapid when administered via intramuscular and oral routes (approximately
   30 – 60 minutes); duration is usually 1– 8 hours.
   A16.7.2. Assess adequacy of pain medication at all patient care handoffs, en route staging
   locations and in- flight. Consider medication for breakthrough pain (pain that “breaks
   through” relief provided by ongoing analgesia).
NOTES:

1. If medication is inadequate or absent at the en route staging facility, the physician/flight sur-
geon will evaluate and order pain medication prior to continuation of PM, complete and for-
ward a DD Form 2852.

2. If a physician is not present and pain medication is not available or is insufficient, request
and establish immediate radio communication with the TACC/AMOCC/AOC/PMRC for a
physi- cian order. The MCD/nurse will complete DD Form 2852 and document the occurrence
on AF Form 3829 if flight related.
   A16.7.3. Non-drug interventions to assist in alleviating pain: Maintain body alignment,
   elevate extremity, change position; readjust splints and bivalved casts; encourage physical
   activity, if opera- tionally and clinically feasible. Consider heat/cold application if not
   contraindicated.
   A16.7.4. Prescribed controlled drugs entrusted to a patient/attendant are considered the
   property of the individual, who is then responsible for safeguarding and administering the
   drug(s) during all phases of PM. Ensure patients understand use and have an adequate supply
   for duration of movement to the receiving MTF. All medical personnel will determine if the
   patient or attendant is competent to safely manage these drugs. NOTE: Patients and non-
   medical attendants will not carry or administer controlled injectible medications without a
   written physician’s order.
   A16.7.5. The originating facility will be responsible for providing pain medication.
   Intratheater requires a 1 day supply and intertheater requires a 3 day supply of medication. If
   narcotics are sent, refer to 7.3. Controlled Drugs.
A16.8. Pain Management Special               Interest   Items. For     detailed   information     see
https://kx.afms.mil/anesthesiology
   A16.8.1. Patient Controlled Analgesia (PCA).
       A16.8.1.1. Various pieces of PCA equipment/pumps for the administration of pain
       medication may be encountered in the PM/AE system. Refer to AMC Equipment
       Standards Guide for current list of AE approved PCA pumps, and waiver process.
WARNING: In addition to correct labeling of IV and pain medication containers/bags, assure all
IV and pain management tubing is taped/labeled with drug/location/date/time in ZULU. For

            Assure pain management tubing is taped/labeled with drug/location/date/time in
            ZULU.
            A16.8.1.2.1.4. Will consider increasing the dose or decreasing lock-out interval
            to account for increased pain during patient transport. A nurse or credentialed
            provider will consider increasing or decreasing the dosage in accordance with
            physician orders.

   A16.8.3. Epidural Analgesia and Peripheral Nerve Blocks.
       A16.8.3.1. Epidural analgesia and peripheral nerve blocks are a proven adjunct for
       severe pain management for patients transiting the continuum of care. Patients will be
       managed by Critical Care Air Transport Teams (CCATT), medical attendants, and/or
       aeromedical evacuation crewmembers (AECMs) and aeromedical staging facility
       personnel. AECMs will manage stabilized patients (not CCATT patients) through the
       AE system. NOTE: All staging facility nursing personnel and AECMs currently
       providing patient care in the AE system must accomplish the approved training plan.
       This training will be completed annually and within 90 days of deployment.. This
       training will be documented in the flight nurse’s Competency Assessment Folder and the
       aeromedical evacuation technician’s Career Field Enlisted Training Plan. However,
       completion of the AF IMT 2519 All Purpose Checklist by the aeromedical evacuation
AFI41-307 20 AUGUST 2003                                                                    197


     technician is not required. The Chief Nurse will be responsible for ensuring all
     AECMs/staging facility nursing personnel have accomplished training prior to caring for
     patients with epidural analgesia or peripheral nerve block infusions. Prior to manifesting
     a patient with epidural analgesia or peripheral nerve block infusions onto an AE flight,
     the presence of the epidural or peripheral nerve block (infusing or capped) will be
     annotated on the Patient Movement Request (PMR) within the TRAC2ES system. The
     theater validating flight surgeon must be aware of the presence of the epidural or
     peripheral nerve block infusion prior to clearing the patient for flight.
        A16.8.3.1.1. It is essential for all providers to know the action and side effects of
        patient specific medications prior to starting care and prior to departure.
            A16.8.3.1.1.1. The following apply to patients moving in the AE system without
            an attendant/CCATT:
                A16.8.3.1.1.1.1. An epidural analgesia or peripheral nerve block infusion
                must be in place and running without incident for a minimum of 4 hours prior
                to departing the sending facility.
                A16.8.3.1.1.1.2. During the placement of the epidural catheter if “loss of
                resistance technique with air” has been used, or a “wet tap” occurs, the patient
                will wait a minimum of 24 hours prior to planned AE mission to decrease the
                possibility of complications such as pneumo-encephalopathy occurring.
                A16.8.3.1.1.1.3. Only analgesic concentrations of local anesthetics will be
                infused. Narcotics (or any other medication) will NOT be added to the
                infusions.
                A16.8.3.1.1.1.4. Only Amides such as Bupivacaine and Ropivacaine will be
                used. The use of Esters such as Procaine and Chloroprocaine is not permitted
                due to increased risks associated with these medications. More dilute
                solutions, i.e. 0.125% Bupivacaine, will be used to decrease the risk of
                sympathetic blockade.
                A16.8.3.1.1.1.5. All infusions must be stable at an analgesic level, not a
                surgical anesthesia level at the T10 dermatome (umbilicus) level. The patient
                should be able to regain partial “motor” control of the lower extremities.
                A16.8.3.1.1.1.6. Other pain medications or narcotics may be administered
                orally, IV or by PCA using established protocols or in conjunction with
                written physician orders.
                A16.8.3.1.1.1.7. All epidural analgesia or peripheral nerve block infusions
                must be administered using an approved infusion pump. Non-approved
                pumps will not be accepted without a waiver from HQ AMC/A3VM. The
                pump and the IV tubing must clearly be labeled as “EPIDURAL INFUSION“
                or “PERIPHERAL NERVE BLOCK INFUSION”.
                A16.8.3.1.1.1.8. A patient hand-off will be completed and documented each
                time a different clinician accepts care of the patient. The hand-off will be
                performed consistent with high alert IV medications to prevent programming
                errors. An independent double-check is defined as two medical persons
198                                                         AFI41-307 20 AUGUST 2003


             familiar with the process/equipment/medication (at least one being a
             registered nurse), independently verifying the practitioner’s/provider’s orders,
             medication hanging, and the correct set up of PCA or IV pump in use (rate,
             dose, volume to infuse, medication concentration, basal rate, bolus lockout,
             etc.). This hand-off will include clearing the infusion history on the infusion
             pump. Documentation of double-checks will be reflected by two signatures
             on required forms/flow sheets or on the AF Form 3899A. This is applicable
             to sending MTFs, ASFs/CASFs, CCATTs and AECMs. Double-checks are
             conducted and documented when initiating high alert medications, during
             handoffs of care, following a change in orders, and when a new bag is started.
             A16.8.3.1.1.1.9. Sufficient orders for the epidural analgesia or regional block
             infusion must be fully documented on the patient movement record (AF Form
             3899). These orders should include medication, infusion rates/settings as well
             as back-up pain management orders in the event the pump should fail or
             inadequate pain relief should occur while the patient is in transit.
             A16.8.3.1.1.1.10. In the event there are complications related to the epidural
             infusion or regional block, nursing personnel will terminate the infusion and
             treat patient as appropriate and per established clinical guidelines included in
             the Epidural and Peripheral Nerve Block Training Plan established by
             Headquarters Air Mobility Command, Office of the Command Surgeon,
             Aeromedical Evacuation Clinical Operations and Training Division.
             Interventions could include a range of activities from administering alternate
             pain adjuncts to airway/circulatory support.          Changes in status and
             interventions will be documented on AF Form 3899 and communicated to the
             appropriate C2 agency.
             A16.8.3.1.1.1.11. At each en route location, an anesthesia provider will be
             contacted if needed for consultation.
             A16.8.3.1.1.1.12. Catheters will not be removed by AECMs or staging
             facility nursing personnel.
             A16.8.3.1.1.1.13. Sterile dressings to insertion site will not be changed in the
             aircraft. They may be re-enforced if necessary.
         A16.8.3.1.1.2. Patients who do not meet the above criteria must be assigned a
         medical attendant who is appropriately trained/credentialed to support such a
         patient. The PMR should also reflect type of infusion and attendant information.
         A16.8.3.1.1.3. All individuals participating in the care of the patient should have
         up-to-date training and experience with PCA use, regional analgesia and the
         equipment. All equipment associated with the use of regional analgesia must be
         approved for flight. Non-drug interventions may also be used to assist in
         alleviating pain: maintain body alignment, elevate extremity, change position;
         readjust splints and bivalved casts; encourage physical activity, if operationally
         and clinically feasible. Consider heat/cold application if not contraindicated.
      A16.8.3.1.2. At each patient care hand off and every 2 hours, assess pain status, level
      of sedation, dermatome level of analgesia, vital signs, motor function, and drug side
AFI41-307 20 AUGUST 2003                                                                      199


           effects. Aeromedical evacuation technicians may assist in providing care to these
           patients in accordance with their CFETP.
              A16.8.3.1.2.1. Assessing Motor/Sensory Dermatome Levels includes motor and
              sensory function checks. NOTE: A “Dermatome’ is best defined as that area of
              the skin that is supplied by a single spinal nerve…or more specifically, the
              vertebral level at which the spinal nerve exits the spinal cord that innervates the
              skin in a contiguous sensory band or stripe (~ 1-2 inches wide). These bands arise
              posteriorly, from the spinal column laterally/anteriorly. Each stripe or band is
              referred to as a dermatome and each dermatome corresponds to a specific nerve
              root. Dermatome segments are standardized to a specific nerve root. Dermatome
              segments are standardized to enable clear/consistent communication about the
              level of anesthesia (sensory blockade).
              A16.8.3.1.2.2. Assessing Motor Function:
                  A16.8.3.1.2.2.1. Ask patient to wiggle toes, dorsiflex foot
                  A16.8.3.1.2.2.2. Ask patient to bend knees/raise leg.
                  A16.8.3.1.2.2.3. Tense the rectus muscles by lifting the head.
                  A16.8.3.1.2.2.4. Refer to your motor block scale to determine the level of
                  motor blockade.
              A16.8.3.1.2.3. Assessing Sensory Function:
                  A16.8.3.1.2.3.1. Temperature - use a cold object; ice/alcohol swab.
                  A16.8.3.1.2.3.2. Touch – apply a sharp and dull object to the skin (paper
                  clip).
                  A16.8.3.1.2.3.3. Begin the assessment along the sternum moving from side to
                  side, progressing downward until the patient identifies a 'change' in ‘touch’
                  sensation and ‘temperature’ sensation (cold warmth or no sensation).
                  Sensation levels may return faster on one side than the other, therefore clear
                  documentation identifying the sensory levels (left and right) should be
                  recorded.
NOTE: Positive findings indicate return of motor function. It does not, however, indicate
resolution of the sensory/autonomic blockade therefore adequate pain control may still be
present.
       A16.8.3.2. Will have continuous pulse ox monitoring
       A16.8.3.3. Obtain temperature every four hours
       A16.8.3.4. Assess skin integrity and change position every two hours
       A16.8.3.5. The Stryker Pain Pump is used to deliver epidural medication. NOTE:
       Narcotics will not be added to epidural infusions,
           A16.8.3.5.1. All infusions must be stable at an analgesic level, and the patient should
           be able to regain partial motor control of the lower extremities.
 200                                                               AFI41-307 20 AUGUST 2003


           A16.8.3.5.2. Follow above guidelines in A16.8.2 Stryker Pain Pump Anesthesia
           Administra-tion.
   A16.8.4. Peripheral Nerve Blocks.
       A16.8.4.1. There are several types of regional anesthesia currently used including
       axillary, femoral, and popliteal peripheral nerve blocks. With these blocks, the anesthesia
       provider injects or infuses the local anesthetic into the tissue surrounding the nerve.
       Needle placement is determined initially by using anatomic landmarks. Next, a
       peripheral nerve stimulator is used to facilitate precise location of the appropriate nerve.
       The anesthetic effect occurs primarily distal to the injection sites. For example, a
       popliteal block may be used for distal surgical procedures, such as the Achilles tendon
       repair. In contrast, intravenous (Bier) nerve blocks are administered distal to the surgical
       site and rely on diffusion rather than direct injection to achieve anesthetic effects.
       A16.8.4.2. All local anesthetic agents used in peripheral nerve blocks induce physiologic
       responses via the same mechanism. Specifically, anesthetics interfere with the neuronal
       membrane’s permeability to sodium. Disruption of sodium exchange results in inhibition
       of neuronal impulses between the affected extremity and the brain. Consequently,
       sensory, motor, and sympathetic neural pathways are affected, and the patient is unable to
       feel or move the anesthetized limb.
       A16.8.4.3. Signs of systemic toxicity include tinnitus, sudden metallic taste, confusion
       that progresses rapidly to loss of consciousness, seizures, and abrupt onset of cardiac
       dysrhythmias. Neurologic symptoms are likely to appear before cardiovascular
       disturbances, unless epinephrine has been added to the block. Inadvertent systemic
       administration of anesthetic combinations containing epinephrine will cause transient
       tachycardia and hypertension.
   A16.8.5. Treatment of Epidural / Peripheral Nerve Block Complication or Toxicity.
       A16.8.5.1. The most broadly accepted theory of Lipid Rescue is that Intralipids create a
       new intravascular lipid compartment, or “lipid sink”, which increases the volume
       distribution of lipophillic drugs. Distribution of drugs to this additional lipid
       compartment rapidly decreases the concentration of overdosed medicines at vital organs
       and quickly reverses the effects of toxic overdoses. Lipid rescue has been proven to work
       in anesthetic overdoses such as bupivacaine and lidocaine.
       A16.8.5.2. If the patient should have a cardiovascular collapse from local anesthetic
       toxicity (Local Anesthetic Toxicity or LAST), the infusion pump will immediately be
       turned off and the following actions will be taken:
NOTE: Every effort must be made as soon as possible to notify the nearest sending facility if
patient is in the staging facility or, if in flight, the responsible PMRC so an immediate mission
diversion can be coordinated.
           A16.8.5.2.1. Airway Management.
           A16.8.5.2.2. Seizure suppression as required.
           A16.8.5.2.3. Initiate ACLS protocols as required.
AFI41-307 20 AUGUST 2003                                                                       201


     A16.8.5.3. If the patient is in cardiopulmonary arrest and established ACLS protocols are
     not succeeding in resuscitating the patient administration of Intralipids must be
     considered using the protocol below. Administration of 20 percent lipid emulsion (values
     in parenthesis are for a 70kg patient):
         A16.8.5.3.1. Bolus 1.5 mL/kg intravenously over 1 minute (~100mL).
         A16.8.5.3.2. Continuous infusion 0.25 mL/kg/min (~18 mL/min; adjust by roller
         clamp).
         A16.8.5.3.3. May repeat bolus twice at minute intervals for persistent cardiovascular
         collapse.
         A16.8.5.3.4. Double infusion rate to 0.5 mL/kg/min if blood pressure returns but
         remains low.
         A16.8.5.3.5. Continue infusion for a minimum of 10 minutes after attaining
         circulatory stability.
         A16.8.5.3.6. Recommended upper limit: approximately 10 mL/kg lipid emulsion
         over the first 30 minutes.
         A16.8.5.3.7. Avoid vasopressin, calcium channel blockers, beta blockers or local
         anesthetic.
         A16.8.5.3.8. Immediately alert anesthesia if patient is in the staging facility or PMRC
         if in flight.
         A16.8.5.3.9. Avoid propofol in patients having signs of cardiovascular instability.
  A16.8.6. Patient Care Responsibilities for Epidural / PNB Infusions.
     A16.8.6.1. Ensure the patient is on continuous pulse oximetry. Assess and document the
     respiratory rate and oxygenation saturation, sedation, vital signs, pain scale, dermatome
     level and side effects (if present) every 2 hours. Document this on the AF IMT 3899M.
     AETs may perform these duties in accordance with their enlisted Career Field Education
     and Training Plan (CFETP). The AET will report these vital signs to the flight nurse. If
     the oxygen saturation falls below 93%, refer to chapter 4, table 4.1 for oxygen delivery
     options.
     A16.8.6.2. Assess motor and sensory function every 2 hours and record on the AF IMT
     3899M. Some motor weakness in patients undergoing epidural analgesia or peripheral
     nerve block therapy to a lower extremity is expected and the patient should be considered
     a risk for falls and require assistance when ambulating. Identify the patient as a fall risk
     via the “Epidural Patient” or “PNB Patient” wrist band.
     A16.8.6.3. Assess the dressing for leakage every four hours and record on the AF IMT
     3899M.
     A16.8.6.4. Monitor for adverse side effects. If adverse side effects occur the course of
     action to take for all problems related to these infusions during flight will be to terminate
     the infusion (turn off the approved AE infusion pump) and resort to other established pain
     management techniques.
202                                                             AFI41-307 20 AUGUST 2003


      A16.8.6.5. Catheters will NOT be removed until re-evaluated by an anesthesia provider
      at the next scheduled en-route stop. Only the anesthesia provider will remove the
      catheter if required. Staging facility personnel and AECMs WILL NEVER remove the
      catheter. Administration of PRN medications per physician’s orders will be the method
      of pain management if the approved AE infusion pump must be turned off due to adverse
      side effects.
      A16.8.6.6. Caution should be taken with any patient receiving epidural or peripheral
      nerve block analgesia via an indwelling catheter who is also receiving anticoagulation
      therapy, to include coumadin, heparin infusions, or Low Molecular Weight Heparin or
      Lovenox.
      A16.8.6.7. Maintain IV access of #20 gauge or larger.
      A16.8.6.8. Change epidural/peripheral nerve block medication bag before infusion runs
      out.
      A16.8.6.9. Ensure the approved AE infusion pump and IV tubing is labeled
      “EPIDURAL ANALGESIA OR PERIPHERAL NERVE BLOCK” and the catheter is
      taped with label indicating "FOR EPIDURAL ANALGESIA or PERIPHERAL NERVE
      BLOCK USE ONLY.". The MCD will ensure the patient’s placement on the aircraft is
      clearly marked on the load plan and specifically identify the patient’s location to the AE
      crew during pre-mission crew brief.
      A16.8.6.10. If in flight, notify the clearing flight surgeon or theater validating flight
      surgeon (via phone patch) for:
         A16.8.6.10.1. Shortness of breath.
         A16.8.6.10.2. Difficulty swallowing.
         A16.8.6.10.3. Dizziness or light-headedness.
         A16.8.6.10.4. Metallic taste in the mouth.
         A16.8.6.10.5. Ringing in the ears.
         A16.8.6.10.6. Catheter dislodgement.
         A16.8.6.10.7. Patient expressions of impending doom.
         A16.8.6.10.8. Pain out of proportion to the clinical injury or out of character for the
         patient’s history.
         A16.8.6.10.9. Seizure activity.
         A16.8.6.10.10. Increasing sedation or presence of confusion.
         A16.8.6.10.11. Respiratory rate of 10/minute or less, or 50% below baseline.
         A16.8.6.10.12. Inadequate analgesia.
         A16.8.6.10.13. Pruritus or nausea/vomiting unrelieved after initial treatment.
         A16.8.6.10.14. Oxygen saturation less than 93% on room air.
         A16.8.6.10.15. Hypotension: postural BP drop > 15mmHg from baseline.
AFI41-307 20 AUGUST 2003                                                                      203


          A16.8.6.10.16. High sensory level: Numbness at or above nipples.

       A16.8.6.12. Epidural analgesia therapy and peripheral nerve block therapy to a lower
       extremity can cause motor weakness and is normal, therefore the patient will require
       assistance with all activity. The staging facility nurses and flight nurses will be
       responsible for assessing the patient’s motor strength. If a patient cannot move their legs
       due to excessive motor block from the infusion, notify the Theater Validating Flight
       Surgeon immediately.
       A16.8.6.13. Motor Activity Assessment Scale (MAAS) score should be documented in
       the chart and the effects of treatment should also be documented.
       A16.8.6.14. If medication is inadequate, providers will follow the Air Mobility
       Command Office Of The Command Surgeon Clinical Practice Guideline For Patient
       Controlled Analgesia (PCA) and Epidural Medications, as well as complete and forward
       a DD Form 2852. If pain medication is not available or is insufficient, request and
       establish immediate radio communication with the TACC/AMOCC/AOC/PMRC for a
       physician order. The MCD/nurse will complete DD Form 2852 and document the
       occurrence on AF Form 3829 if flight related.

   and AECMs.
   A16.9.2. An independent double-check is defined as two medical persons familiar with the
   process/equipment/medication (at least one being a registered nurse), independently verifying
   the practitioner’s/provider’s orders, medication hanging, and the correct set up of PCA or IV
   pump in use (rate, dose, volume to infuse, medication concentration, basal rate, bolus
   lockout, etc.).
   A16.9.3. Double-checks are conducted and documented when initiating high alert
   medications, during handoffs of care, following a change in orders, and when a new bag is
   started.

                                 ENTERAL TUBE FEEDINGS

A18.1. General Principles.
   A18.1.1. Enteral feeding is the delivery of commercially prepared nutritional liquid via a
   tube for adults, infants and children who have a functioning gastrointestinal tract, but are
   unable to orally ingest adequate nutrients to meet their metabolic needs.
        A18.1.1.1. May play a role in both short-term rehabilitation and long-term nutritional
        management, and therapy ranges from supportive or a portion of the needed nutrients to
        primary therapy.
        A18.1.1.2. Conditions requiring enteral feeding include but are not limited to:
        oral/maxillofacial injuries; multiple trauma; hypermetabolism (burns, cancer); sepsis;
        neck/esophogeal/tracheal        trauma;     TBI/CVA;         gastrointestinal       disorders
        (tracheoesophageal fistula, disorders of: absorption, digestion, utilization, secre- tion and
        storage of nutrients); neuromuscular disorders (muscular dystrophy, spinal cord defects,
        and cerebral palsy or damage to the central nervous system); cardiopulmonary disorders;
        failure to thrive and prematurity.

A18.2. En Route/Preflight/In-flight Considerations for All Feeding Tubes.
   A18.2.1. Feedings may be intermittent or continuous low-flow delivered via an AE approved
   feeding pump and tubing, or bolus/gravity feedings IAW the physician’s order or in the
   absence of an AE approved pump. Follow feeding schedule (as ordered).
      A18.2.1.1. Feeding administration set will be changed every 24 hours and labeled with
      the following: Date/Zulu Time, feeding solution and concentrate, rate; any other pertinent
      orders, and name and title of provider.
   A18.2.2. Treatment/Management.
      A18.2.2.1. Assess all GI tubes for placement and gastric residual at every patient care
      hand-off, every four hours, including during continuous feeding, and before injecting any
      fluids or medications:
          A18.2.2.1.1. Ascultate lung sounds
          A18.2.2.1.2. Abdomen: note distention, presence of bowels sounds, rigid/soft,
          tenderness, flatus, bowel movement, and feeding tolerance including nausea,
          vomiting, diarrhea.
          A18.2.2.1.3. Tube placement:
             A18.2.2.1.3.1. Inject 30 mL of air into the tube via irrigation tip syringe while
             listening for air flow over the epigastric area with a stethoscope to confirm
             placement (not advised in aircraft noise environment.)
             A18.2.2.1.3.2. Aspirate stomach contents for amount of gastric residual – Note
             amount and characteristics, and document. NOTE: Do not discard, instill into
             tube and allow to gravity drain
          A18.2.2.1.4. Administer all tube feedings if gastric residual is less than 50% the
          hourly rate or IAW phy- sician’s order.
          A18.2.2.1.5. Hold all tube feedings if gastric residual is greater than 200 mL or
          greater than 50% the hourly rate or IAW physician’s order. Recheck in one hour and
          resume if within nor- mal range. NOTE: If residual remains above limits after the
          second assessment, hold tube feeding and contact TACC/AMOCC/AOC/PMRC for
          physician guidance.
          A18.2.2.1.6. After replacement of gastric contents, medications and bolus feeding
          add 30-60 mL distilled H2O and allow gravity to clear the tube. Avoid infusing air.
 208                                                             AFI41-307 20 AUGUST 2003


           A18.2.2.1.7. Clamp the tube for 30-45 minutes to ensure medication absorption
           before recon- necting to suction, if ordered. NOTE: Do not clamp tube in-flight;
           secure glove/other gravity drainage device if feeding is held, or apply suction if
           indicated (i.e. nausea; vomiting; abdom- inal distention; excessive residual posing
           risk of aspiration).
           A18.2.2.1.8. Maintain head of bed/litter elevated at least 30° with backrest to prevent
           aspira- tion. NOTE: If condition prevents use of backrest, additional care should be
           taken to prevent aspiration, including holding feedings 30-60 minutes prior to takeoff
           and landing. For flight, consider placing patient head forward (towards cockpit) in
           litter position to reduce 4°-8° neg- ative grade, and administer bolus feedings
           preferably at cruise altitude to decrease risk of aspi- ration.
       A18.2.2.2. Oral care will be accomplished every two hours with normal saline or clean
       distilled water, and cleaning/brushing teeth and tongue.
       A18.2.2.3. Documentation includes at a minimum tube location (i.e. oral/nasal/J-G,
       landmarks, bowel sounds, lung sounds); intake/output; feeding type; GI assessment,
       position, oral care, etc.
           A18.2.2.3.1. Vital signs and temperature every four hours on AF IMT 3899A or AF
           IMT 3899D.
           A18.2.2.3.2. Document I&O every four hours on AF IMT 3899E.
       A18.2.2.4. Additional feeding tube care/supplies and formula is required for the
       destination facility IAW 7.1.5.6.
       A18.2.2.5. If NPO and/or documented intolerance to tube feedings for more than 48
       hours, should be evaluated for Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN) prior to flight
       A18.2.2.6. If administration set becomes occluded during transport it should be changed
       and primed, then set at the previous administration rate. NOTE: If feeding tube becomes
       occluded      irrigation     is    unsuccessful,     hold    feedings     and     notify
       TACC/AMOCC/AOC/PMRC for physician guidance.

                 PULMONARY AND FAT EMBOLISM MANAGEMENT

The AE environment promotes risk of embolisms to include; immobility, sitting for long periods
and/or in cramped conditions (aircraft, tactical vehicles), significant dehydration potential.
A19.1. Pulmonary Embolism (PE).
   A19.1.1. A clot that forms in a part of the body and travels through the venous system to
   another part of the body is known as an embolus. A PE is a sudden blockage (small, large or
   complete) in the pulmonary vasculature from an embolus, usually from the deep veins of the
   legs and pelvis. An embolus formed in the veins is known as a Deep Vein Thrombosis
   (DVT) and is the primary cause of PE.
   A19.1.2. Conditions at risk for DVT:
       A19.1.2.1. Poly-trauma, surgery; pelvic and lower extremity trauma/fractures; casts, bed
       rest, (immobile or limited mobility), thrombophlebitis/varicose veins, cardiac disease,
       obesity, malignancy; females who use birth control pills and smoke, pregnancy; geriatrics
       and any known coagulopathy.
   A19.1.3. Symptoms may include, hemoptysis, dyspnea, diaphoresis, chest pain and cough.
A19.2. Fat Embolism.
   A19.2.1. Fat embolism can occur whenever fat globules enter the circulatory system from
   long bone (femur/humerus) and/or pelvic fractures or during orthopedic surgery. Once in the
   bloodstream, the fat globule travels and lodges in the pulmonary vasculature causing an
   obstruction, and then metabolizes to free fatty acids with a resulting diffuse vasculitis and
   inflammation of the lung that leads to pulmonary failure.
   A19.2.2. Symptom onset: 8 hrs – 14 days
       A19.2.2.1. Cardinal Signs: petechial rash on trunk/chest/axillia.
A19.3. Prevention.
A19.3.1. Immobilize pelvis/extremity fractures to prevent bone movement.

   A19.3.2. Assure adequate PO/IV hydration.
   A19.3.3. Encourage ambulation and position changes for all litter and ambulatory patients, if
   not con- traindicated
       A19.3.3.1. Litter patients should be assessed for potential ambulation and mobility
       requirements at each en route stop and in-flight, and should receive maximum mobility
       assistance on a case by case basis.
       A19.3.3.2. Immobile patients should receive active/passive ROM every two hours as
       condition permits. NOTE: Flexion/Extension of the feet to prevent pooling in the lower
       extremities is highly recommended—PREVENTION ONLY, do not use if DVT
       diagnosis is known/docu- mented.
 210                                                             AFI41-307 20 AUGUST 2003


   A19.3.4. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is a drug of choice for
   prevention/treatment of DVT. NOTE: Contraindications for LMWH use are: closed head
   injury; incomplete spinal cord injury; complex pelvic fractures; multiple long bone fractures;
   and obvious bleeding/hemorrhage.
   A19.3.5. Patients with known DVT or PE will have intravenous catheter (IVC) filter, aka,
   “umbrella” placement prior to flight when operational feasible.
A19.4. Signs & Symptoms Common to Both Pulmonary and Fat Embolism: NOTE:
Pulmonary and Fat emboli are serious conditions and may cause death.
   A19.4.1. Sudden onset and unexplained:
       A19.4.1.1. Anxiety.
       A19.4.1.2. Change in LOC (Irritability, restlessness, confusion, and disorientation).
       A19.4.1.3. Sudden onset of dyspnea.
       A19.4.1.4. Tachycardia.
       A19.4.1.5. Angina-like chest pain.
       A19.4.1.6. Decreased oxygen saturation and signs of hypoxia.
       A19.4.1.7. Adventitious breath sounds: pleural friction rub, crackles, and wheezes
       A19.4.1.8. May have fever 101° to 104° without any other causes.
A19.5. Treatment/Management of Acute Pulmonary and Fat Embolism Symptoms
   A19.5.1. Maintain airway and assist breathing.
   A19.5.2. Administer high flow O2 via non-rebreather face mask to maintain pulse oximetry
   91% or greater. NOTE: Intubation and mechanical ventilation may be required.
       A19.5.2.1. Consider decrease in cabin altitude (< 4000) in-flight— if operationally
       feasible.
   A19.5.3. Start IV with RL and administer 500 ml bolus and follow with an hourly rate of
   150 ml/hour unless contraindicated.
   A19.5.4. Place on cardiac monitor.
A19.5.5. Place on pulse oximeter.

   A19.5.6. Monitor vital signs every 15 minutes at a minimum, if operationally feasible
   A19.5.7. Hourly I&O
   A19.5.8. Contact TACC/AMOCC/AOC/PMRC for guidance and possible diversion to an
   MTF capable of handling patient condition if in-flight.
