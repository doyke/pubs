authority is hereby withheld from all subordinates within 2 AF who are not at least:

2.1.1. Wing commanders or group commanders who report directly to 2 AF (direct-reporting
group commanders), or higher, with respect to the following alleged offenses: unprofessional

to the disposition authority.

2.3.1. The commander’s disposition options include: no action, corrective administrative action,
nonjudicial punishment, preferral or disposition of charges previously preferred, and forwarding
the matter to a superior or subordinate authority for disposition. If the commander deems it
appropriate to forward a case to a subordinate commander for further disposition, the commander
may not direct the actions the subordinate commander should take.

3. Suspension and Decertification.

3.1. Handling allegations against MTLs and military member TTIs: Upon any allegation of
faculty/staff sexual assault or unprofessional relationship or student/trainee abuse, if the
subject is a MTL or military member TTI (as opposed to a civilian or contractor instructor), the
MTL’s or military member TTI’s squadron commander will review the allegation and, within 24
hours of receipt, make a determination concerning potential suspension from duties pending
resolution of the matter. Upon disposition, if the allegation is substantiated, the MTL or military
member TTI shall be temporarily or permanently decertified.

3.1.1. When considering potential suspension, the squadron commander will consider the
severity and nature of the alleged offense as well as good order and discipline in the squadron.

3.1.2. If a commander declines to suspend a member alleged to have committed or engaged in a
sexual assault, an unprofessional relationship with sexual contact, physical maltreatment, or an
attempt to commit one of these offenses, the commander must document his/her rationale in the
2 AF weekly consolidated report described in para 4.5. below.

3.1.3. During suspension, the MTL or military member TTI will be prohibited from contact with
trainees and students, be removed from the active training environment, and discontinue the wear
of the blue aiguillette (MTLs only).

3.1.4. Suspension shall continue until at least such time as the allegation that triggered the
suspension is initially disposed by the appropriate authority. At the latest, suspension shall be
continued until final disposition of the allegation. Within this time window, as appropriate, the
MTL’s or military member TTI's squadron commander shall first discover whether the allegation
was unsubstantiated or substantiated as determined by appropriate disposition authorities. If the
allegation is unsubstantiated, the suspension shall be lifted and the member notified.

3.1.5. If the allegation is substantiated, the squadron commander shall choose between the
following options: temporary decertification until completion of remedial training or permanent
decertification. The squadron commander must consider the AFECD SDI 8B100 retention
criteria or other appropriate eligibility guidance when deciding between temporary or permanent
decertification.

3.1.5.1. Remedial training may begin immediately, and temporary decertification has no
minimum required duration.

3.1.6. The initial period of suspension, along with the resulting determinations regarding
decertification, shall be documented via memorandum containing, at minimum, the information
provided in Attachment 2. Such memoranda shall be retained in a member’s personnel
information file (PIF) in accordance with governing guidance. The squadron commander has the
discretion to maintain such memoranda relating to an unsubstantiated allegation in the member’s
PIF with documentation as to why the allegation was unsubstantiated, or to remove these
memoranda from the PIF.

3.1.6.1. Upon law enforcement and judge advocate advice, in order to facilitate investigation,
commanders may remove a member from MTL or TTI duties without providing formal
notification in accordance with these instructions. The member should be provided formal
notification as soon as practicable and suspension documentation completed and filed as
described in this guidance.

3.2. Handling allegations against civilian or contractor TTIs: Upon any allegation of
faculty/staff sexual assault or unprofessional relationship or student/trainee abuse, if the
subject is a civilian or contractor TTI, the squadron commander shall consult with a judge
advocate and either civilian personnel or contracting office in order to determine an appropriate
course of action. Ensuring student and trainee safety shall be given the highest priority in
determining an appropriate course of action.

3.3. Handling allegations against MTIs: A program directing suspension, temporary and
permanent decertification, and remedial training in cases of faculty/staff sexual assault or
unprofessional relationship or student/trainee abuse, if the subject is a MTI, shall be
developed and implemented by 37 TRW (delegable to 737 TRG). This program will be
submitted to the 2 AF/TTOC Director for review and approval.

4. Reporting.

4.1. It is critical to assure that commanders at all levels have access to the information required
to ensure good order and discipline. Therefore, MTLs, MTIs, TTIs, and all other faculty/staff
(except victims of the alleged offense and student/trainees) with knowledge of sexual assault or
unprofessional relationship or student/trainee abuse shall prepare and submit a misconduct
report containing information as described in paragraph 4.2.. Knowledge of a reportable offense
includes, but is not limited to, oral statements by students, instructors, or third parties (parents,
siblings); comments made in end of course surveys and critiques; comments on forms such as
AETC Form 736, Student Feedback, (anonymous or signed); and witnessing the offense.

4.2. A misconduct report shall provide, at minimum, the following information, so far as it is
available: date of report, person reporting, person receiving report, date of offense, type of
offense, alleged victim’s name, status, squadron and graduation date, alleged perpetrator’s name,
status and squadron, and detailed description of the allegation. The misconduct report shall be
forwarded through command channels to the respective training squadron commander. The
report must be forwarded by each individual as soon as possible, but no later than 24 hours after
the allegation or observation is made.

4.3. Each training squadron shall remove all personally identifiable information (PII) from the
misconduct report after final disposition of the allegation. Each training squadron shall maintain
these non-PII misconduct reports in addition to information describing their disposition for a
minimum of two years IAW AFRIMS RDS Table 33-45, Rule 06.00. A record in any format,
electronic or physical, that maintains this information without PII is acceptable. (e.g. Excel
spreadsheet, database, scanned redacted docs)

4.4. All allegations of sexual assault or unprofessional relationship, to include
trainee/student-on-trainee/student incidents, shall be:

4.4.1. Immediately reported to 2 AF through command channels.

4.4.2. Immediately reported to the servicing staff judge advocate’s office.

4.4.3. Continuing updates for these cases will be provided via one or more appropriate reporting
channels (OPREP, AMJAMS, and consolidated misconduct reporting under paragraph 4.5.).
Exception: Trainee/student-on-trainee/student incidents must be reported via chain of command
to 2 AF/CC immediately, but should not be included on weekly consolidated reports.

4.5. All allegations of faculty/staff sexual assault or unprofessional relationship or
student/trainee abuse shall be reported by all 2 AF squadrons to their higher headquarters,
consolidated by wing or direct-reporting group, and provided to 2 AF/JA on a weekly basis in
format as 2 AF/JA shall direct.
5. Organizations Existing Primarily to Service International Students.

5.1. Training organizations existing primarily to service international students (e.g. IAAFA,
DLIELC) are exempt from the specific requirements of paragraphs 6.1.1. – 6.1.3., paragraphs
6.2.1. – 6.2.3., paragraph 6.3., and paragraphs 7.5.1. - 7.5.2. However, these organizations are
expected to develop programs and materials for international students meeting the intent of
paragraphs 6.1., 6.2., 6.3., and 7.5. within the scope of their particular mission and in accordance
with language and cultural requirements. These programs and materials shall be submitted to the
2 AF/TTOC Director for review and approval.

6. Required Training.

6.1. All training squadrons and training groups will provide briefings regarding faculty/staff
sexual assault or unprofessional relationship or student/trainee abuse within 30 days of
assignment and annually thereafter to each MTI, MTL, TTI, or other member of the faculty and
staff.

6.1.1. Prior to this briefing, each applicable member shall view the 2 AF videos, Trainer Abuse
of Power and Trainee Rights and Duties, if available from the 2 AF Portal page.

6.1.2. HQ 2 AF Form 3, Military Trainer/Instructor Abuse of Power Agreement, describes the
material to be briefed and shall be used to document the briefing and video review for military
personnel.

6.1.3. A current version of HQ 2 AF Form 3 shall be maintained by the squadron for each
member in a covered position. It shall be disposed of not more than 180 days following the

first permanent duty station. Missing forms will be replaced by 2 AF/TTOC Det 1 and initial
skills training squadrons.

6.3. All students/trainees shall be briefed on the availability and use of the 2 AF Abuse Hotline,
feedback/critique boxes, surveys, and any other available reporting option. Although
students/trainees may be encouraged to employ their chain of command, they shall not be
discouraged from employing anonymous reporting options.
6.4. In order to support effective training required under paragraphs 6.1. – 6.3., in complex
technical training endeavors and pipelines the 2 AF/TTOC Director shall have waiver authority
to designate appropriate locations, timeframes, and local variations to meet the above intent.
Submit all waiver requests to 2 AF/TTOC for review.

7. Enabling Student Reporting.

7.1. All end of course (EOC) surveys performed at the conclusion of training in 2 AF will
contain questions inviting students/trainees to provide anonymous reports in regard to
faculty/staff sexual assault or unprofessional relationship or student/trainee abuse. This
requirement may be fulfilled via the automated Technical Training Management System (TTMS)
EOC misconduct survey.

7.1.1. If the training squadron does not use or have access to electronic TTMS EOC surveys, the
commander shall contact 2 AF/TTOC for implementation guidance and approval for paper-based
surveys.

7.2. Anonymous feedback boxes shall be locked and permanently affixed within high-traffic
student gathering areas (e.g. community centers, student lounges) and within high-use student
areas of student dormitories.

7.2.1. In order to preserve anonymity, refrain from installing feedback box locations in view of
the camera monitoring system.

7.2.2. Feedback boxes must be checked at minimum twice per week.

7.3. Commanders of all training squadrons shall select, by name, trusted personnel to review all
student feedback, whether provided via electronic means (TTMS EOC comments) or paper
based (feedbox critiques). These trusted personnel shall not include MTLs, MTIs, TTIs, or their
immediate supervisors. Appropriate reviewers are squadron or detachment commanders,
directors of operation, first sergeants, detachment chiefs, the senior enlisted member assigned to
a unit, and personnel assigned specifically to perform full-time group evaluation or misconduct
reporting functions. This responsibility may not be delegated and should not be assumed by
personnel temporarily filling the position in an “acting” capacity.

7.4. Squadron commanders, detachment commanders, or commanders of the respective training
groups for all Basic Military Training and initial skills training squadrons, shall provide an in-
brief to all trainees containing, at minimum, the information in Attachment 3.

7.5. Commanders of all training squadrons shall ensure that students/trainees have access to
anonymous reporting options. They shall employ the following means:

in Attachment 4 are posted prominently in squadron facilities.

7.6. In order to support the effective use of these reporting tools in complex technical training
endeavors and pipelines, the 2 AF/TTOC Director shall have waiver authority to designate
appropriate locations, timeframes, personnel, and materials to meet the above intent. Submit all
waiver requests to 2 AF/TTOC for review.

8. PIF Review.

8.1. All training wings and direct-reporting groups within 2 AF shall institute and maintain
internal policies that require review of a member’s existing PIF by all levels of leadership prior
to taking any action regarding a MTI, MTL, TTI, or other member of the faculty/staff. For
example, internal procedures should require the PIF to accompany an instructor's quarterly award
nomination through each level of leadership. The internal procedures must include reviews for
the following actions: awards, decorations, SDI removal, hat removal, inter and intra unit
transfers, adverse administrative actions, performance reports, promotion to supervisory
positions, and appointment as acting first sergeants.

Sample Trainee In-Brief IAW Paragraph 7.4

[TT ONLY] Be aware, MTIs should not contact you in any way upon graduation from BMT or
upon arrival here at technical training, except for official reasons.

[ALL] You will ensure your relationships with MTIs, MTLs, faculty and staff, to include DoD
and international personnel, either military or civilian or contract personnel, are professional.
These professional relationships should continue throughout your entire period of training or
instruction received here in technical training. If any of these individuals must counsel you one-
on-one in private (i.e., behind closed doors), another permanent party staff member (or
leadership rope if a permanent party member is not reasonably available) of the same gender as
you will be present. Furthermore, you must maintain these professional relationships until you
report to your permanent duty station of assignment and have been in the AF for more than 180
days.

Similarly, you will not establish, develop, attempt to develop or conduct a social, personal,
intimate or sexual relationship with MTIs, MTLs, faculty or staff. This includes, but is not
limited to, dating, handholding, kissing, embracing, caressing and engaging in sexual activities.
Prohibited personal, intimate or sexual relationships include those unprofessional relationships,
that are conducted in person and/or via cards, letters, e-mails, telephone calls, social media (e.g.,
Twitter, Facebook, MySpace, YouTube), photographs and any other means of communication.

If an MTI, MTL, faculty or staff member attempts to contact you for other than official business,
immediately contact your squadron commander, first sergeant or the Sexual Assault Response
Coordinator (SARC) at XXX-XXXX, or the 2 AF Abuse Hotline at DSN 487-4007 or
