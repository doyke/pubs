and Air National Guard (ANG) units. Note: Guidance in this instruction applicable to Major
Commands (MAJCOMs) also applies to Headquarters Air Force (HAF), National Guard Bureau
(NGB), Geographically Separated Units (GSU), and Limited Scope Facilities. The term GSU
includes detachments and operating locations. All references to wings include installations and
bases. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be reviewed in entirety. Significant
revisions include: reorganized content; updated training exemptions; deletion of Exercise
Evaluation Team (EET), Staff Assistance Visit (SAV) and Military Personnel Flight (MPF)
requirements; introduction of Medical Readiness Decision Support System (MRDSS) SABC
module. Major changes are a result of Air Force Instruction (AFI) reduction and compliance
tiering. Commander (CC) responsibility, program execution and overall management are
streamlined in this update.

                                 PROGRAM OVERVIEW

1.1. Overview. SABC training fulfills an Expeditionary Skills Training (EST) requirement to
produce deployment-ready Airmen. SABC training provides knowledge and skills to minimize
injury and prevent death or disability in deployed environments or home station emergencies.
Foundational education received during basic military enlisted/officer training courses do not
fulfill the SABC requirement for pre-deployment EST. SABC training does not qualify as
formal medical education therefore is exempt from regulatory and educational requirements
associated with formal medical courses (e.g., Blood-Borne Pathogen Protection, Privacy Act).
1.2. Applicability. Unless otherwise stated, this instruction applies to AF personnel (AF, AFRC
and ANG) and designated civilian/contract employees. Designated civilian/contract employees
are individuals who have a SABC requirement referenced in their position description.

        personnel not directly assigned by Personnel Accounting Symbol (PAS) code should
        have a training support agreement between the host installation and parent unit(s).
        Agreements should clearly define each wing/unit’s SABC program roles and
        responsibilities.
        2.4.1.2. AFRC and ANG units retain responsibility for their personnel even when co-
        located with active duty units. AFRC and/or ANG units may attend and/or consolidate
