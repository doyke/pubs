     review each training cycle, or upon significant changes (ANG: to ACC/A3G, AFRC: to
     ACC/A3U upon request). Review supplements each training cycle.
  1.2.5. Squadron supervisor (ARC: Appropriate operations supervisor) will:
     1.2.5.1. Ensure adequate continuity and supervision of individual training needs,
     experience, and proficiencies of assigned/attached pilots.
     1.2.5.2. Review training and evaluation records of newly-assigned pilots and those
     completing formal training to determine the training required for them to achieve BMC
     or CMR and to ensure provisions of this instruction have been met.
     1.2.5.3. Orient Ready Aircrew Program (RAP) missions to develop combat skills or
     practice tactical employment relevant to expected unit tasking. Provide guidance to
     ensure only effective RAP missions are logged. See Attachment 2 for RAP mission
     definitions.
     1.2.5.4. Review qualifications and training requirements of FS/GLO and determine
     appropriate flight restrictions.
     1.2.5.5. Determine missions/events in which individual BMC pilots will maintain
     qualification versus familiarization.
     1.2.5.6. Determine utilization of BMC pilots.
     1.2.5.7. Determine how many and which BMC and CMR pilots will carry special
     capabilities/ qualifications.
     1.2.5.8. Identify the levels of supervision required to accomplish the required training,
     unless specifically directed.
     1.2.5.9. Assist the wing/group in developing the unit training programs.
     1.2.5.10. Monitor individual assigned/attached pilot currencies and requirements.
     1.2.5.11. Ensure pilots only participate in missions, events, and tasks for which they are
     adequately prepared, trained, and current.
     1.2.5.12. Designated combat aircraft (CC-coded) squadrons will submit a training report
     to MAJCOM/A3TO (ANG: ACC/A3G) every 4th month during the training cycle
     (always at the end of Jan, May, Sep for all). Squadrons may submit an out of cycle report
     at anytime if Higher Headquarters (HHQ) assistance is required to prepare for Designed
     Operational Capability (DOC) or AEF tasking. Reports will consist of: 1) an email
     memo summarizing results or unresolved issues since the last report, current training plan
     summary, and significant shortfalls/Limiting Factors (LIMFACS) affecting training. 2)
     A filled out squadron training health slide (attachment to email memo) summarizing
     critical training issues. Both items IAW the guidance and examples at the web site
     https://A3.acc.af.mil/A3t/A3TO/Fighter/FighterTeam.asp .           Reports will reflect on
     different phases of training unique to each AEF pair. Key reports are the Post-AEF (end
     of the 1st month after AEF Vulnerability (Vul) period) and the Pre-AEF 4 months prior
     to AEF Vul period, others are snapshots of a squadron’s training health. Report only
     significant shortfalls/LIMFACS of events/missions that affect 15% or greater of the
     squadron’s pilot force. Include possible solutions or specific assistance required if able.

        HQ ACC will attempt to rectify or minimize noted shortfalls/LIMFACS while the
        training cycle is under way. Other MAJCOMs submit training reports IAW RAP
        Tasking Memo.
            1.2.5.12.1. Shortfalls occur when required mission training tasks are not
            accomplished due to shortages of equipment, munitions, etc. Example: unable to
            accomplish actual weapons release due to a shortage of training weapons.
            1.2.5.12.2. LIMFACS are factors, constraints, restrictions, etc. that degrade training
            effectiveness. Example: squadron's ability to accomplish actual weapons release is
            limited due to the lack of ranges that allow aircraft to drop munitions. This may
            include support hardware and software.
            1.2.5.12.3. All deviations from these training requirements, after proration, will be
            summarized and reported to ACC/A3T (ANG: ACC/A3G) with the Post-AEF
            training report (end of the 1st month after AEF Vul period) IAW paragraph 1.2.5.12
            above. This includes requirements waived by OG/CC. Email training reports to
            ACC/A3TO RAP program manager at accdoto.rapreporting@langley.af.mil , DSN
            574-8323 (ANG: Email training reports to accdog.rapreporting@langley.af.mil ).
            Contact ACC/A3TO F-16 Functional Area Manager (FAM) DSN 574-4099. Other
            MAJCOMs submit training reports IAW RAP Tasking Memo.
     1.2.6. Individual pilots will:
     1.2.6. (AETC) This also applies to F-16 weapons system officers (WSO).
        1.2.6.1. Hand carry all available training records, gradebook, and Flight Evaluation
        Folders to assist the gaining unit in assessing qualifications and training requirements.
        1.2.6.2. Complete training requirements and currencies within the guidelines of this
        instruction.
        1.2.6.3. Participate only in ground and flying activities for which they are qualified,
        current, and prepared.
1.3. Processing Changes:
     1.3.1. Forward recommendations for change to this volume to MAJCOM/A3 on AF IMT
     847, Recommendation for Change of Publication.
     1.3.2. MAJCOMs will forward approved recommendations to HQ ACC/A3.
     1.3.3. HQ ACC/A3 will:
        1.3.3.1. Coordinate all changes to the basic instruction with all MAJCOM/A3s.
        1.3.3.2. Process recommendations for change after approval by HQ USAF/A3/5.
        1.3.3.3. Address time sensitive changes by immediate action message.
        1.3.3.4. MAJCOM/A3 (ANG: ACC/A3G) will determine training requirements for
        subordinate units. AFI changes will be issued via revision, Interim Change (IC), or
        Administrative Change (AC) to this publication. Due to dynamic requirements of
        Combatant Commanders, training requirements and currencies may be altered regularly.
        These training requirement and currency adjustments may be made via RAP Tasking
AFI11-2F-16V1_AETCSUP_I 3 JULY 2013                                                              9


       Memorandum. HQ ACC/A3 will include MAJCOM supplemental guidance in the next
       publication of the AFI.
1.4. Training. Training programs are designed to progress pilots from Initial Qualification
Training (IQT) (B-Course or Transition/Requalification Training [TX]), then to Mission
Qualification Training (MQT), and finally to Continuation Training (CT).
   1.4.1. IQT provides the training necessary to initially qualify pilots in a basic position and
   flying duties without regard to a unit's mission. Upon completion of IQT, the pilots attain
   Basic Aircraft Qualification (BAQ) status. BAQ is a prerequisite for MQT. Except for
   General Officers above wing level, BAQ is not a long term qualification status. Waiver
   authority for pilots, other than general officers above the wing level, to remain BAQ is
   MAJCOM/A3 (ANG: ACC/A3G).
   1.4.2. MQT provides the training necessary to initially qualify or requalify pilots in a
   specific position and flying duties to perform the missions assigned to a specific unit. Pilots
   maintain BAQ status until they complete MQT. Completion of MQT or FTU instructor
   course is a prerequisite for BMC and CMR.
   1.4.3. CT. There are two aspects of CT. The first consists of pilot training in the basic
   flying skills contained in the RAP Tasking Memo (RTM). These skills ensure safe operation
   of the aircraft. The second consists of specific mission-related training required to
   accomplish the unit's assigned missions.
   1.4.4. Ready Aircrew Program (RAP). The CT program is designed to focus training on
   capabilities needed to accomplish a unit's core tasked missions. Following completion of
   IQT and MQT, pilots will have received training in all the basic missions of a specific unit
   unless excepted in Chapter 3. Pilots will then be assigned to either a CMR or BMC
   position.
       1.4.4.1. Combat Mission Ready (CMR). The minimum training required for pilots to
       be qualified and proficient in all of the primary missions tasked to their assigned unit and
       weapons system.
       1.4.4.2. All CC-coded unit active duty API-1 positions, flying SQ/CC and DO positions
       are designated CMR positions. OG/CCs may designate other API-6 positions not
       assigned to the flying squadron as CMR. (Exception: If a unit is over-manned, the
       SQ/CC may elect to train the front line of their Unit Manning Document (UMD) API-1s
       to CMR and designate the overage BMC. In this case, priority should be given to
       inexperienced pilots with at least 50 percent, if available, designated CMR). (ARC/TFI:
       Any pilot may be designated CMR at OG/CC discretion). CMR pilots maintain
       proficiency and qualification in all core missions of the flying unit to which they are
       assigned or attached. CMR pilots maintain currencies which affect CMR status,
       accomplish all core designated flight training (missions and events), and all mission
       ground training. Failure to complete this training or maintain these currencies results in
       regression to non-CMR (N-CMR) status unless waived by appropriate authority.
       1.4.4.3. Basic Mission Capable (BMC). Pilot accomplishes training required to remain
       familiarized in all, and may be qualified and proficient in some, of the primary missions
       of their weapon system and unit. (ARC: Any pilot may be designated BMC at OG/CC
       discretion).
 10                                              AFI11-2F-16V1_AETCSUP_I 3 JULY 2013


      1.4.4.4. All non-CMR active duty wing pilot positions are designated BMC positions.
      BMC designations are assigned to pilots who have a primary job performing wing
      supervision or staff functions that directly support the flying operation, or are FTU
      instructors, Weapons School instructors, pilots assigned to active flying billets in units
      without assigned aircraft (i.e. 549 CTS [Air Warrior I], etc.), or operational test pilots.
      For those missions in which they maintain familiarization only, BMC pilots must be able
      to attain proficiency and qualification in 30 days or less. BMC pilots accomplish all
      mission related ground training designated by their attached SQ/CC. BMC pilots may
      deploy and may participate in any mission for which they are proficient and qualified,
      without additional training, as determined by the SQ/CC. Failure to complete BMC
      required training results in regression to non-BMC (N-BMC) status. AFRC and AFRC
      TFI BMC training events will be directed by RAP Tasking Memo.
      1.4.4.5. BMC pilots assigned to units without assigned aircraft (i.e. 549 CTS [Air
      Warrior I], etc.) will fly a RAP mix as determined by the unit commander consistent with
      their unit’s tasking. RAP events and weapon requirements are determined by the unit
      commander.
      1.4.4.6. N-CMR/N-BMC. Pilots that regress to N-CMR/N-BMC status will accomplish
      the requirements in accordance with paragraph 4.10. While N-CMR, pilots may
      participate in missions, including exercise and contingency, in which they are current and
      qualified at the discretion of the SQ/CC.
      1.4.4.7. Specialized Training. Specialized training is training in any special skill(s)
      necessary to carry out the unit's assigned missions that is not required by every pilot.
      Specialized training consists of upgrade training such as FLUG, IPUG, FAC(A),
      ASA/ONE with TGP/ATP, etc., including CT to maintain proficiency and qualification in
      unit tasked special capabilities and missions. Specialized training is normally
      accomplished after a pilot is assigned CMR/BMC status, and is normally in addition to
      CMR/BMC requirements. Unless otherwise specified, pilots in CMR or BMC positions
      may hold special capabilities/qualifications as long as any additional training
      requirements are accomplished.
1.5. Training Concepts and Policies:
   1.5.1. Units will design training programs to achieve the highest degree of combat readiness
   consistent with flight safety and resource availability. Training must balance the need for
   realism against the expected threat, pilot capabilities, and safety. This instruction provides
   training guidelines and policies for use with operational procedures specified in applicable
   flying/operations publications.
   1.5.2. ACC Training Support Squadron (ACC TRSS) will assist OG/CCs in development of
   training programs when/where tasked by the HQ ACC/A3. Other MAJCOMs may submit
   requests for training program support to the HQ ACC/A3. If validated, these requests will be
   prioritized and tasked to ACC TRSS. Designated test units (CB-coded) may develop syllabi
   to upgrade operational test pilots in support of specific test plans. These syllabi will be
   approved by the OG/CC and submitted to ACC TRSS.
   1.5.3. Design training missions to achieve combat capability in squadron tasked roles,
   maintain proficiency, and enhance mission accomplishment and safety. RAP training
AFI11-2F-16V1_AETCSUP_I 3 JULY 2013                                                            11


   missions should emphasize either basic combat skills or scenarios that reflect procedures and
   operations based on employment plans, location, current intelligence, and opposition
   capabilities. Tactical training will include use of inert and live ordnance, threat simulators,
   countermeasures, targeting pods, HTS pods and dissimilar aircraft as much as possible.
   1.5.4. In-flight Supervision:
      1.5.4.1. Unless specifically directed, the SQ/CC determines the level of supervision
      necessary to accomplish the required training.
      1.5.4.2. IPs and FL-qualified SQ supervisors may allow any pilot to lead portions of a
      mission if appropriately briefed. This provision will only be used to allow the pilot to
      practice events in which he is already qualified or to help determine if the pilot is ready
      for FLUG.
      1.5.4.3. Flight leads may give their wingman the tactical lead for specific tasks. As a
      tactical lead, the wingman makes tactical decisions for the flight, but the flight lead
      retains overall authority and responsibility.
   1.5.5. Experienced Pilot (EXP)
      1.5.5.1. An experienced pilot has one of the following:
          1.5.5.1.1. 500 hours F-16, or
          1.5.5.1.2. 300 hours F-16 with 1,000 hours (FP/IP/MP), or
          1.5.5.1.3. 100 hours F-16 and previously fighter EXPERIENCED.
      1.5.5.2. For pilots, fighter time is defined as FP/IP/MP hours logged in aircraft while
      assigned an AFSC of 11FX. OA-10 and AT-38 are considered fighter time. WSOs must
      achieve fighter EXPERIENCED while assigned an AFSC of 12F3X or 12F4X.
      1.5.5.3. Hours logged in the MTC accomplishing RAP Tasking Memo-approved
      missions will be counted as “hours” when determining experience level. RAP MTC
      Mission hours will not exceed 20% of the total required to meet the experienced
      threshold (ex: 100 RAP MTC Mission hours out of 500 hours F-16 time). See the current
      RAP Tasking Memo for guidance on approved RAP MTC Missions and logging
      procedures. AFRC: N/A.
1.6. Ready Aircrew Program Policy and Management:
   1.6.1. The RAP training cycle is 12 months and is aligned with the Fiscal Year. RAP
   tasking executed IAW RAP Tasking Memorandum.
   1.6.1. (AETC) The AETC RAP training cycle is aligned with the Calendar Year.
   1.6.2. Each RAP training level (CMR, BMC & BAQ) is defined by a total number of RAP
   missions, broken down into simulators, missions, specific weapons qualifications, and
   associated events as determined by the MAJCOM and unit commander.
   1.6.3. The breakout of mission and event types is provided as a guideline to be followed as
   closely as possible but minor variances (other than increased Red Air allocations for CMR;
   AFRC: N/A) are authorized. However, SQ/CCs may still use variations in missions or events
   as a basis for regression.
 12                                               AFI11-2F-16V1_AETCSUP_I 3 JULY 2013


   1.6.4. An effective RAP training mission requires accomplishing a tactical or building block
   profile. Each mission requires successfully completing a significant portion of the relevant
   events as determined by the SQ/CC, RTM, and Attachment 2.
      1.6.4.1. Only one RAP training mission may be logged per sortie (day or night) unless
      separated by AAR. Each mission on either side of the AAR must stand alone as an
      effective RAP training mission. A maximum of three RAP missions per sortie may be
      logged under these rules.
   1.6.5. The SQ/CC's first priority should be to train all designated pilots to CMR status.
   CMR status requires:
      1.6.5.1. A 1-month lookback at the CMR sortie rate (ref paragraph 4.7.1.1 for specifics
      and further criteria).
      1.6.5.2. Qualification in all core missions and weapons events required at CMR.
      1.6.5.3. Confirmation that CMR pilots can complete the prorated number of sortie/event
      requirements remaining by the end of the training cycle.
      1.6.5.4. Completion of mission-related ground training, to include a current verification
      or certification.
   1.6.6. Progression from BMC to CMR requires:
      1.6.6.1. A 1-month lookback at the CMR rate.
      1.6.6.2. Qualification in all core missions and weapons events required at CMR.
      1.6.6.3. Completion of mission-related ground training, to include a current verification
      or certification.
      1.6.6.4. Squadron CC certification.
   1.6.7. SQ/CCs will determine and assign pilots that will train for and maintain special
   capabilities or qualifications. Special capability/qualification mission and event requirements
   are normally accomplished in addition to baseline CMR/BMC requirements except for
   mission commander and flight lead training.
   1.6.8. End of Cycle training requirements are based on the pilot's experience level on the last
   day of the current training cycle.
   1.6.9. Units converting to another MDS may fly pilots in CMR positions at the BMC rate if
   CMR sortie rates cannot be supported. One month prior to the operationally ready date,
   CMR pilots should be flown at a CMR rate. Active duty wings converting to new MDS are
   authorized one SQ equivalent (7/6 for 24/18 or less PAI) of additional API-6s during the
   conversion period. However, total wing staff flying the new aircraft shall not exceed new
   authorized total.
1.7. Training Sortie Program Development:
   1.7.1. RAP mission and event requirements (see Attachment 2) apply to CMR and BMC
   pilots including those carrying special capabilities or qualifications. They are IAW the RAP
   tasking memo which specifies the total RAP training cycle mission requirements. RAP
   Lookback and Mission requirements are published in Table 5a of the current Rap Tasking
AFI11-2F-16V1_AETCSUP_I 3 JULY 2013                                                            13


   Memorandum. It establishes the minimum number of missions required for BMC and CMR
   levels. The RAP tasking memo takes precedence over this instruction and may contain
   updated requirements and events not yet incorporated in Attachment 2.
   1.7.2. Navigation sorties should be programmed for API-1 pilots. These sorties ensure that
   pilots maintain their skills necessary to operate safely in the civil airspace environment.
   1.7.3. Experiencing/Collateral sortie requirements must be considered when developing unit
   flying hour programs.
      1.7.3.1. Experiencing sorties are additional training sorties necessary to achieve desired
      proficiency in optimum time. RAP missions may not provide sufficient hours to
      experience pilots to achieve overall unit experience levels.
      1.7.3.2. Collateral sorties are not directly related to combat employment training but are
      necessary in day to day unit operations. These include, but are not limited to, functional
      check flights, ferry flights, incentive/orientation flights, deployments, and air shows. For
      the training cycle, the MAJCOM allocates a block of sorties to the unit for these
      purposes.
   1.7.4. Attrition sorties are allocated to unit flying hour programs to compensate for non-
   effective training sorties. Non-effective sorties are logged when a training sortie is planned,
   but a major portion of valid training for that type of mission is not accomplished due to poor
   weather, IFE, adversary fallout, etc. For CMR pilots, non-effective sorties will be logged
   (and not counted toward RAP totals) when Red Air allocations are exceeded during a training
   cycle (AFRC: N/A). In order to accurately allocate the number of attrition sorties, it is
   essential that non-effective sorties are logged appropriately.
1.8. Training Records and Reports.
   1.8.1. Units will maintain pilot records for individual training and evaluations IAW:
      1.8.1.1. AFI 11-202V1, Aircrew Training.
      1.8.1.2. AFI 11-202V2, Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program.
      1.8.1.3. AFI 11-401, Aviation Management.
   1.8.2. Units will track the following information for all pilots (as applicable):
   1.8.2.1. F-16 specific ground training (not Ancillary Training).
      1.8.2.2. Requirements and accomplishment of individual missions and events
      cumulatively for the training cycle.
      1.8.2.3. RAP requirements and accomplishment using 1-month and 3-month running
      totals for look-back.
      1.8.2.4. Currencies.
      1.8.2.5. Weapons employment qualification requirements in sufficient detail to document
      all employment attempts and hit/miss percentages in a COTS database of choice.
   1.8.3. Units will maintain a training folder for each assigned aircrew to include the following
   information:
      1.8.3.1. Current aircrew qualifications and upgrade training programs.
 14                                                AFI11-2F-16V1_AETCSUP_I 3 JULY 2013


       1.8.3.2. Letter of qualification from previous unit (if applicable).
       1.8.3.3. Documentation for completion of any specialized training programs from AFI
       11-2F-16, Volume 1, while assigned to the unit.
   1.8.4. Unit training folders will be forwarded to the gaining unit when the aircrew has a
   permanent change of station.
1.9. Pilot Utilization Policy:
   1.9.1. Commanders will ensure that wing/group tactical pilots (API-1/6s) fill authorized
   positions IAW unit manning documents and that pilot status is properly designated. The
   overall objective is that pilots perform combat-related duties. Supervisors may assign pilots
   to valid, short-term tasks (escort officer, FEB/mishap board member, etc.), but must
   continually weigh the factors involved, such as level of pilot tasking, flying proficiency,
   currency, and experience. For inexperienced pilots in the first year of their initial operational
   F-16 assignment, supervisors will limit the non-flying duties to those related to combat
   activities.
   1.9.2. Duties required by various publications that may be assigned to CAF API-1 pilots are
   weapons and tactics officer, programmer, flight safety officer, SOF, mobility/contingency
   plans, training (except ARMS documentation), SQ Standardization/Evaluation Liaison
   Officer (SELO), squadron life support officer, electronic combat officer, and other duties
   directly related to flying operations. In some instances, such as squadron-assigned flying
   safety officers, API-1s may be attached to the wing. API-1s will not be attached to wing
   staffs or man wing staff positions unless total wing pilot API-1 manning is 100 percent or
   better. CCs will ensure wing staff pilots (API-6s) perform duties justified in MAJCOM
   manpower standards documents and authorized in UMDs. AFRC: OG/CC may designate
   API positions as required to meet unit requirement.
1.10. Sortie Allocation Guidance:
   1.10.1. Inexperienced API-1 pilots should receive sortie allocation priority over experienced
   pilots. Priorities for sortie allocation are as follows:
       1.10.1.1. Operational Units. CMR API-1, MQT API-1, CMR API-6, MQT API-6,
       BMC (API- All), API-5 pilot physicians.
       1.10.1.2. Combined Formal Training and Operational Units. Formal syllabus
       training, CMR/API-1, MQT API-1, CMR API-6, MQT API-6, BMC (API-All), API-5
       pilot physicians, others.
       1.10.1.3. Formal Training Units and USAFWS. Formal syllabus training, Instructor
       Upgrade, Instructor CT, authorized staff personnel not performing Instructor or FE duties
       (to include API-5 pilot physicians not on instructor orders).
       1.10.1.4. Test and Test Evaluation Squadron (TES) Units. Requirements directed by
       MAJCOM, training required to prepare for assigned projects/tasking, BMC training
       requirements that cannot be accomplished on primary missions, API-5 pilot physicians.
   1.10.2. Wing API-6 authorizations are IAW unit manning documents
   1.10.3. For FTU-only wings, all API-6 pilots will maintain instructor status (optional for
   WG/OG CC, FCF pilots, and one other). These wings will fly API-1/6 pilots as required by
AFI11-2F-16V1_AETCSUP_I 3 JULY 2013                                                             15


   PFT. For wings consisting of both FTU and operational units, at least one of the following
   pilots will maintain formal IP status: WG/CC, WG/CV, OG/CC, OG/CD.
   1.10.4. API-8 rated personnel flying authorizations, MAJCOM/IGS inspectors in API-6
   billets, and Test Unit pilots will be IAW AFI 11-401 and MAJCOM guidance. API-8 pilots
   will fly the BMC sortie rate, however they are not required to complete BMC specific
   missions/events or meet monthly lookback requirements. Test unit pilots will fly the BMC
   sorite rate as a minimum and should meet montly BMC lookback. SQ/CCs will direct
   additional sorties if syllabus or test missions provide insufficient pilot proficiency training.
   Units should provide assigned API 6/8 flyers adequate resources to maintain minimum
   training requirements. However, API-6 flyer support will not come at the expense of the
   flying squadron's primary mission. API 6 flyers will accomplish basic skills events with
   allotted BMC sorties. API-8 IGS flyers will strive to accomplish basic skills events with
   allotted BMC sorties. If attached units cannot meet attached flyer requirements, they must
   request relief IAW AFI 11-401, as supplemented. Units requiring flying hour adjustments
   for attached API-8 and applicable API-6 flyers must request program changes IAW
   MAJCOM directives.
1.11. Waiver Authority:
   1.11.1. With MAJCOM/A3 approval, waiver authority for all requirements of the RAP
   tasking memo is the OG/CC. Additional guidance may be provided in the memo. Unless
   specifically noted otherwise in the appropriate section, and also with MAJCOM/A3 approval,
   the OG/CC may adjust individual requirements in Chapter 4, Chapter 5, and Chapter 6, on
   a case-by-case basis, to accommodate variations in aircrew member experience and
   performance. For all other provisions of this volume, and IAW AFI 11-202 Vol 1, the
   waiver authority is MAJCOM/A3 (ANG: ACC/A3G).
   1.11.2. Waiver authority for supplemental guidance will be as specified in the supplement
   and approved through higher level coordination authority.
   1.11.2. (AETC) AETC/A2/3/10 is the waiver authority unless otherwise specified in this
   supplement. Send waiver requests through stan/eval channels to AETC/A3V. The operations
   group commander (OG/CC), or equivalent, of the unit that generated their supplement will
   handle waivers to supplemental guidance. All references to MAJCOM/A3T should be
   replaced by AETC/A3Z for AETC matters.
   1.11.3. Waivers to this instruction will be valid until end of the training cycle.

                           INITIAL QUALIFICATION TRAINING

2.1. General. This chapter outlines Initial Qualification Training (IQT) of pilots into the F-16.
IQT includes Basic (B-Course) and Transition/Requalification/Senior Officer (TX-Course)
training and will normally be conducted during formal syllabus courses at a Formal Training
Unit (FTU) squadron whenever possible. Graduates of F-16 FTU will be proficient in air-to-air
and air-to-ground mission tasks as indicated by the Training Task List/Course Training
Standards (TTL/CTS) of the FTU syllabus. Students will graduate current and qualified in
ACBT, LASDT CAT I (500’), NVG, TGP, weapons employment qualification (GP, LGBs,
IAMs; EO - Fam), and receive block differences training as required by next assignment.
2.2. Approval/Waiver for IQT. In exceptional circumstances, when FTU training is not
available within a reasonable time period, IQT may be conducted at the local unit IAW
provisions of this chapter. This local IQT will normally be conducted using appropriate formal
USAF Transition or Requalification Training Course syllabus tracks, flow programs, and
requirements. When local IQT is authorized, the gaining MAJCOM assumes responsibility for
the burden of providing this training locally. The following guidance applies only to other than
formal course IQT.
   2.2.1. MAJCOM/A3 (ANG:NGB/A3O) is approval authority to conduct local IQT, and is
   waiver authority to change the formal requirements of locally conducted IQT (ANG:
   ACC/A3G). Info MAJCOM/A3T.
   2.2.2. MAJCOM/CC (ANG: ACC/CG) is the approval authority for non-formal course IQT
   for Colonel selectees and above to be conducted at the unit to which the officer is assigned.
   2.2.3. Requests to conduct local IQT will include the following:
       2.2.3.1. Justification for the local training in lieu of formal course training.
       2.2.3.2. Summary of individual's flying experience to include last centrifuge training
       date.
       2.2.3.3. Date training will begin and expected completion date.
       2.2.3.4. Requested exceptions to formal course syllabus, with rationale.
   2.2.4. Successful completion of IQT requires the upgrading pilot to complete an aircraft
   instrument qualification IAW AFI 11-202V2 (AFI 11-2F-16V2).
2.3. Prerequisites. Course prerequisites will be IAW the appropriate formal course syllabus
and the USAF Education and Training Course Announcements (ETCA).
2.4. Ground Training. Ground training may be tailored to the individual's background and
experience or peculiar local conditions. However, available and current reference materials such
as AFTTP 3-3, AFTTP 3-1.F16, Operational Test Reports and Tactical Bulletins, instructor
guides, and audiovisual programs, should be used as supporting materials to the maximum extent
possible. Simulator missions will be accomplished in the best simulator available.
2.5. Flying Training:
AFI11-2F-16V1_AETCSUP_I 3 JULY 2013                                                             17


   2.5.1. Mission sequence and prerequisites will be IAW the appropriate formal course
   syllabus.
   2.5.2. Training will be completed within the time specified by the syllabus, as approved.
   Failure to complete within the specified time limit requires notification through
   MAJCOM/A3T to MAJCOM/A3 (ANG: ACC/A3G) with pilot's name, rank, reason for
   delay, planned actions, and estimated completion date.
   2.5.3. Pilots in IQT will fly under IP supervision (dual or chased) until completing the
   instrument qualification checkride.
   2.5.4. Formal course syllabus mission objectives and tasks are minimum requirements for
   IQT. However, additional training events, based on student proficiency and background,
   may be incorporated into the IQT program with authorization of the SQ/CC. Additional
   training due to student non-progression is available within the constraints of the formal
   course syllabus and may be added at the discretion of the SQ/CC.
2.6. IQT for Senior Officers:
   2.6.1. All formal training courses for senior officers (colonel selectees and above) will be
   conducted at FTUs unless waived IAW paragraph 2.2
   2.6.2. Senior officers must meet course entry prerequisites and will complete all syllabus
   requirements unless waived IAW syllabus directives and paragraph 2.2.2
   2.6.3. If senior officers must be trained at the base to which they are assigned they will be in
   formal training status. Unit duties will be turned over to appropriate deputies or vice
   commanders until training is completed. Exceptions to this policy must be approved by
   MAJCOM/CC (ANG: ACC/CG).

                                             Chapter 3

                          MISSION QUALIFICATION TRAINING

3.1. General. Mission Qualification Training (MQT) is a unit developed training program that
upgrades newly assigned B or TX course graduates to BMC/CMR to accomplish the unit
mission. The culmination of initial MQT is an evaluation IAW AFI 11-2F-16V2. For other
newly assigned pilots, MQT-LAO, SIM MQT-1 LAO/Instruments, and appropriate theater-
specific ground training events are the minimum requirements. Guidance in this chapter is
provided to assist SQ/CCs in executing an OG/CC approved MQT program. Units are expected
to further tailor their programs based on current qualification, experience, currency, documented
performance, and formal training. Applicable portions of MQT may be used to create a
requalification program for pilots who have regressed from BMC/CMR to specifically address
deficiencies which caused regression.
   3.1.1. MQT will be completed within 90 calendar days (ARC: 120 calendar days). Timing
   starts at the pilot's first duty day at the gaining operational unit. If a pilot elects to take leave
   prior to entering MQT, the timing will begin after the termination of the pilot's leave.
   Training is complete upon SQ/CC certification to CMR/BMC. Notify MAJCOM/A3T if
   delay beginning MQT due to security clearance exceeds 30 days. If training exceeds the
   specified limit, units will notify MAJCOM/A3 (ANG: ACC/A3G).
   3.1.2. The following CMR/BMC training items are granted grace periods for completion
   after MQT: AAR and night training may be accomplished NLT 90 days (ARC: 180 days)
   from completion of MQT. Failure to comply will result in regression to N-CMR/N-BMC
   until training is complete. AAR and night training accomplished in IQT may fulfill MQT
   requirements as determined by the SQ/CC. Night training events require demonstrated
   proficiency and currency in similar day events, unless accomplished dual with an IP.
   3.1.3. Pilots in MQT will not fly in FLAG-level exercises or Weapons School support
   sorties.
   3.1.4. Prior to BMC/CMR certification, if not accomplished during FTU training, pilots must
   complete initial Weapons Employment Qualification IAW Chap. 5 and RAP tasking memo.
3.2. Ground Training:
   3.2.1. Units will develop blocks of instruction covering areas pertinent to the mission as
   determined by the SQ/CC. Training accomplished during IQT may be credited towards this
   requirement.
   3.2.2. Pilots transferring from another MAJCOM require region-specific airspace procedures
   academics before flying.
   3.2.3. Initial Verification: (N/A CB/TF-coded units): Initial verification will be completed
   within 90 days (ARC: 180 days) after completing MQT. Each pilot (not required for BMC)
   will demonstrate to a formal board a satisfactory knowledge of the squadron’s assigned
   mission. Board composition will be established by the SQ/CC. Desired composition is
   SQ/CC or SQ/DO, weapons, electronic combat, intelligence, and plans representatives.
3.3. Simulator Training:
AFI11-2F-16V1_AETCSUP_I 3 JULY 2013                                                          19


   3.3.1. SIM MQT profiles should be accomplished in the best available simulator. SIM
   MQT-1 is a prerequisite for the first MQT flight. Locally directed simulator missions should
   concentrate on squadron tasking and unique capabilities. AFRC: Any SIM requirements or
   events can be waived or replaced with flying training as required by SQ/CC.
   3.3.2. SIM MQT--Local Area Orientation/Instruments. Normal ground operations,
   standard departure(s), navigation, emergency airfield procedures and approaches, published
   penetration and approach to primary alternates and home base, emergency divert procedures,
   EPs.
   3.3.3. SIM MQT-Day/Night Air-to-Air Procedures. Trail departure, intercepts, EC
   equipment operation, threat detection and defensive reactions, switchology, emergency
   procedures, TGP employment, NVG operations, and weapons employment IAW squadron
   UCML.
   3.3.4. SIM MQT--Day/Night Air-to-Surface Procedures. Heavyweight takeoff, weapons
   deliveries, jettison procedures, EC equipment operation, threat recognition and defensive
   reactions, local range procedures, emergency divert procedures, hung ordnance procedures,
   TGP employment, NVG operations, and weapons employment IAW squadron UCML.
3.4. Flying Training. The appropriate missions from those listed below will be used to upgrade
to BMC or CMR. Unit-developed MQT programs should use profiles typical of squadron
missions. Maximum use of armament recording assets and captive missiles is encouraged on all
MQT missions.
   3.4.1. Supervision. A FL-qualified SQ supervisor or IP is required unless specified
   otherwise. The SQ/CC will determine the proper flight position of the supervisor/IP unless
   specified otherwise.
   3.4.2. If more than 14 calendar days elapse between sorties, an additional review sortie will
   be flown before continuing in the program.
   3.4.3. All pilots must conduct practice airborne emergency procedures training during any
   one of the MQT sorties. As a minimum, the training will consist of briefing, flying, and
   debriefing a simulated critical action procedure scenario to include airborne communication
   with the SOF.
   3.4.4. Sortie Requirements. The sorties listed in paragraphs 3.4.5, ACBT Qualification,
   and 3.4.6 Air-to-Surface Training, are suggested mission profiles that the SQ/CC may use to
   develop the unit's MQT program based on unit tasking. Supervision will be an IP or FL-
   qualified SQ supervisor. Pilots will demonstrate proficiency in the following additional
   minimum events during MQT:
Trail departure
Instrument approach (precision and non-precision)
Radar Trail Arrival
       3.4.4.1. MQT-LAO--Mission Objectives. Practice local area orientation, local
       instrument procedures, airspace/range familiarization, and emergency airfield(s)
       overflight/approaches. B/TX course graduates may combine with MQT-AHC.
 20                                              AFI11-2F-16V1_AETCSUP_I 3 JULY 2013


       3.4.4.2. Mission Evaluation Checkride (If Required). This sortie will be flown IAW
       AFI 11-202V2 and local standardization/evaluation criteria on a mission representing the
       unit's primary mission tasking.
   3.4.5. ACBT Qualification. The following sorties (in sequence) will be used to become
   ACBT qualified. Units may expand this program to achieve desired proficiency or
   capability. ACBT programs for pilots with previous fighter experience may be individually
   tailored based on experience, currency, and documented performance. If both 4 v X TI and
   ACT rides were accomplished during FTU, then an FTU graduates meets the requirements
   of having initial ACBT Qualification, but they may require an ACBT recurrency during
   MQT at their operational squadron.
       3.4.5.1. MQT-Aircraft          Handling          Characteristics       (AHC)--Mission
       Objectives. Familiarize the pilot with aircraft maneuvering capabilities and limitations,
       by practicing advanced handling maneuvers. Specific Mission Tasks: High AOA/low

Defense Ensemble (ACDE) and to familiarize pilots with combat capabilities while wearing
ACDE. Pilots must complete Initial ACDT NLT 90 days (ARC: 180 days) from MQT
completion. Initial ACDT affects CMR/BMC, but is non-grounding. All initial ACDT is to be
accomplished prior to the first ACDE flight. Pilots will be ACDE certified upon the completion
AFI11-2F-16V1_AETCSUP_I 3 JULY 2013                                                            21


of initial ACDT. Pilots who accomplished initial ACDT in previous tours in a fighter type MDS
are not required to reaccomplish the ACDE Flight.
   3.5.1. Ground Training. Pilots will accomplish initial (LL04) Aircrew Chemical Defense
   Training/ACDT (LL04) initial and CT refresher thereafter. Egress Training with ACDE
   (LL05) IAW AFI 11-301 (Aircrew Life Support Program), and Emergency Parachute

   3.5.2. Aircrew Chemical Defense Ensemble (ACDE) Simulator. A simulator mission in
   full ACDE gear (anti-exposure suit not required), harness, and G-suit. Within the mission
   profile, practice doffing simulated contaminated equipment. An ACDE simulator can count
   toward EP or TAC SIM requirements if an appropriate scenario is flown . Units will use
   their best available simulator for ACDE simulator training. The ACDE SIM is accomplished
   only once per MDS, and should be conducted as close as possible to the first ACDE (CW)
   flight (but not more than 30 days prior).
   3.5.3. Aircrew Chemical Defense Ensemble (ACDE) Flight. The ACDE flight will be
   accomplished once in a career (unless previously accomplished in a fighter type MDS).
   Flight training must consider limitations of operating while wearing ACDE. Full donning
   and doffing procedures/sequence will be practiced in conjunction with the ACDE flight but
   the only ACDE worn in-flight will be mask, filter pack, and gloves.
   3.5.4. ACDE Flight Restrictions:
       3.5.4.1. Pilots will be fully current and qualified in an event prior to accomplishing that
       event on an ACDE flight.
       3.5.4.2. Minimum formation spacing is route unless fingertip is required for safe mission
       accomplishment (i.e., WX penetration).
       3.5.4.3. Minimum altitude is 500 feet AGL except takeoffs, approaches and landings.
       3.5.4.4. No ACBT or night sorties. AAR requires an IP in the flight.
       3.5.4.5. Weather minimums are 1,500 feet ceiling and 3 miles (4.8 km) visibility for
       pilots wearing ACDE.
       3.5.4.6. Dual cockpit operations will be used to the maximum extent possible with a
       safety observer, qualified in the aircraft, not wearing ACDE in the rear cockpit. Solo
       operations will be supervised by an ACDE qualified FL from a chase position.
       Formations, to include chase, are limited to two-ship and only one pilot in the element
       will be wearing ACDE unless both aircraft are dual with an experienced pilot in each
       RCP. Pilots wearing ACDE gear will not fly in dissimilar formations.
       3.5.4.7. Operations supervision should not conduct ACDE flight training when, in their
       judgment, temperature/dew point conditions are not favorable to safe operations.
3.6. Flight Surgeon (FS) and Ground Liaison Officer (GLO) Training:
   3.6.1. Ground Training. Flight Surgeons and GLOs who are assigned to tactical units and
   who have not previously flown the unit-assigned aircraft will accomplish the following
   before the initial flight briefing: Aircraft general review, hanging harness training (as
22                                              AFI11-2F-16V1_AETCSUP_I 3 JULY 2013


  applicable), egress training, protective equipment training, AGSM training, and an
  instrument/EP simulator (optional) with a CMR/BMC pilot.
  3.6.2. Flight Training. The first flight in the unit-assigned aircraft will be with an IP and
  may be flown in conjunction with other training sorties. The briefing and sortie will
  emphasize stick/throttle interferrence avoidance, communications and equipment, tactical
  display interpretation, and the aircraft's performance envelope.
AFI11-2F-16V1_AETCSUP_I 3 JULY 2013                                                            23

                                CONTINUATION TRAINING

4.1. General. This chapter outlines ground and flying training requirements for CMR, BMC,
and BAQ pilots. Pilots must be qualified IAW AFI 11-401, AFI 11-2F-16 V2, and AFI 11-202
V1/V2. Additionally, they must complete IQT to fly in BAQ status, MQT or FTU IP upgrade to
fly in BMC status, or MQT to fly in CMR status.
4.2. Ground Training. Ground training will be accomplished IAW the ground training table in
the RTM. Waiver authority for the ground training specified is IAW the reference directive.
Ground training accomplished during IQT/MQT may be credited toward CT requirements for the
training cycle in which it was accomplished. This list is intended to be a single source reference
for F-16 specific ground training only, which will be tracked in ARMS. This list does not
include non-F-16 specific ancillary training (e.g. SABC, IA training) which should not be
tracked ARMS. Where discrepancies exist, the reference directive takes precedence.
   4.2.1. Simulator (SIM): The event requirements in the most current RTM depict the
   minimum EP and TAC SIM training requirements to be accomplished in best available
   simulator. SQ/CC will determine the required supervision for CT SIM missions, based on
   SIM capabilities, and mission training objectives. Units will develop scenarios that cover
   both EP and TAC SIM missions based on expected employment tasking and general systems
   knowledge requirements. Emphasis should be placed on training not readily attainable
   during daily flying activities. Units will review scenarios each training cycle and update as
   required. Pilots may receive credit for training accomplished in special SIM devices or
   HHQ-directed simulator test support, etc., if approved by the SQ/CC (AFRC: N/A).
       4.2.1.1. During EP SIM missions, training in the following areas will be accomplished
       each training cycle: unusual attitude recoveries, spatial disorientation, inadvertent
       weather entry, controlled flight departure recognition and recovery procedures, controlled
       and uncontrolled ejection parameters, aircraft subsystem failure checklist procedures,
       relevant critical action procedures, and precision instrument procedures. NOTE: Pilots
       may satisfy EP SIM requirements by accomplishing or administering INSTM/QUAL EP
       Evaluations (EPEs).
       4.2.1.2. During TAC SIM missions, training in the following areas will be accomplished
       each training cycle: AEF and DOC relevant simulated combat employment, threat
       recognition/reactions and counter tactics, aircraft subsystem failure checklist procedures,
       relevant critical action procedures. NOTE: Pilots may satisfy TAC SIM requirements by
       accomplishing or administering MSN EPEs.
   4.2.2. Situational Emergency Procedures Training (SEPT).
       4.2.2.1. This training is not an evaluation, but a review of abnormal/emergency
       procedures and aircraft systems operations/limitations during realistic scenarios. One
       pilot should present a situation and another discusses actions necessary to cope with the
       malfunction and carry it to a logical conclusion. Critical action/Boldface procedures (if
       applicable) and squadron special interest items should be emphasized. Incorporate the
       following elements into squadron SEPT training programs:
24                                               AFI11-2F-16V1_AETCSUP_I 3 JULY 2013


         4.2.2.1.1. Unless dictated otherwise by the OG/CC, SEPTs are designed and
         released by OGV with optional inputs by OG/CC or Squadron Leadership.
         4.2.2.1.2. Develop SEPT scenarios using actual mishaps/incidents as baseline cases.
         4.2.2.1.3. Discuss at least one EP for each major subsystem (engine, electrical,
         hydraulic, fuel, flight control and auxiliary power as applicable) in each session. The
         EPs should also span all phases of flight to include the role of supporting a fighter
         that has an emergency (checklist backup, ATC coordination and flight path
         clearance). For at least one emergency, discuss considerations for handling that
         emergency at night.
         4.2.2.1.4. Accomplish two SEPTs each training cycle with an IP or SQ supervisor to
         include minimum fuel and emergency divert training.
     4.2.2.2. SEPT training will be accomplished each calendar month, and the currency will
     expire at the end of the following month. Pilots with an expired SEPT are grounded until
     subsequently completed.
     4.2.2.3. SEPTs should be accomplished in the best available simulator. If a simulator is
     not available, SEPTs should be accomplished one-on-one or in small flight-sized groups
     as long as all members participate fully and share equal time responding to emergency
     situations.
     4.2.2.4. Completion of a simulator EP profile satisfies the monthly SEPT requirement.
     For an IP/FE administering the SEPT/EP Sim, this will satisfy their SEPT requirement.

4.5. Multiple Qualification/Currency:
   4.5.1. MAJCOM/A3 (ANG: NGB/A3) may authorize qualification in more than one MDS
   aircraft for pilots only when such action is directed by command mission requirements and is
   economically justifiable. This authority cannot be delegated below MAJCOM level. Unless
   required for unit mission accomplishment, commanders must not permit pilots qualified in
   primary mission aircraft to maintain qualification in support aircraft. Individuals assigned to
   positions covered by paragraph 4.5.2 have MAJCOM/A3 approval, and not need to submit
   specific requests.
      4.5.1.1. Submit multiple qualification requests through command channels to
      MAJCOM/A3 (ANG: NGB/A3). All requests must contain full justification. Approval
      for a multiple qualification request must be provided to the appropriate host installation

      4.5.1.2. Individually authorized multiple qualifications are valid as long as the individual
      is assigned to the specific position, and aircraft requested, or until rescinded by the
      approval authority.
   4.5.2. Paragraph 4.5.1 does not apply to variants of the F-16. These aircraft are considered
   the same MDS. See paragraph 6.14 for block differences training.
   4.5.3. Multiple qualification is not appropriate for senior wing supervisors of units with
   different types of aircraft. Wing commanders will qualify in only one of their wing's aircraft.
   Either the WG/ CV or OG/CC should qualify in another of the wing's aircraft (not the same
   one selected by the WG/ CC).
   4.5.4. Multiple Requirements. Pilots will satisfy at least 50 percent of the sortie
   requirements of their primary aircraft in that aircraft. If CMR, they will meet all RAP
   sortie/event requirements of the primary aircraft. In addition, pilots will fly an equitable
   distribution of emergency patterns, instrument sorties, penetrations, non-precision
   approaches, and precision approaches in each MDS to fill their non-RAP requirements.
   4.5.5. Multiple Currencies. Pilots will fly at least once each 45 days in each aircraft. They
   will comply with all other currency requirements for each aircraft.
   4.5.6. Pilots must complete conversion training IAW an approved syllabus.
4.6. Currencies/Recurrencies/Requalifications:
   4.6.1. Currency. Table 4.1, as supplemented by the most current RTM, defines currency
   requirements for all F-16 pilots. If a pilot loses a particular currency, that sortie/event may
   not be performed except for the purpose of regaining currency as noted.
   4.6.1. (AETC) Table 4.3 (added), as supplemented by the most current RTM, defines
   currency requirements for all F-16 WSOs. If a WSO loses a particular currency, that sortie or
   event may not be performed except for the purpose of regaining currency as noted.

NOTES:
1. See Attachment 2 for demanding/non-demanding sortie definitions. In addition, BAQ pilots will fly in a super
vised status (with a FL-qualified SQ supervisor or IP) any time a non-demanding sortie is required.
2. Recurrency supervision level is IP in aircraft or chase, qualified and current in event. To regain RCP landing
currency, FCP must be occupied by a BMC/CMR pilot with landing currency.
3. Supervision will be FL-qualified SQ supervisor or instructor, qualified and current in the event/capability.
4. For formal course IP's (WIC and FTU), CT and exercise participation require above currencies; formal syllabus
training missions require 180 days currency.
5. Flight leaders may update currency from either lead or wing position. Recurrency will be accomplished from
wing position.
6. Updated by an actual weapons release on a class A/B/C range.
7. Currency is required in the pilot’s low altitude category for operations below 1000 feet (Table 6.1). Loss of
currency requires regression to the next higher altitude block. Operations in a lower block will update the higher
block categories. Re-currency requires satisfactory performance in the following events: vertical awareness
training, hard turns, tactical formation, and offensive/defensive maneuvering.
8. If non-current in precision approaches, increase the pilot weather minimum by one category. To regain currency,
fly a precision approach. Any simulator may be used to update currency (but not to regain currency) provided
simulator training is accomplished with WX at/below pilot minimums.
9. Element Air-to-Air currency. Currency is updated by accomplishing an A-A event with emphasis on blue
element employment contracts and deconfliction. Does not affect CMR. If non-current, must accomplish a day
event. Opposed Air-to-Ground sorties that fit the definition in A2.1.24 may update this currency.
10. For IPs, accomplishing or instructing the event from either cockpit will update currency. WIC student sorties
count as instructor sorties.
11. Must be current in NVG Refresher Academics. Supervision will be an NVG current, qualified pilot in the
aircraft or current, FL-qualified SQ supervisor or IP in the element..
12. Currency is required in NVG LOW to fly in the night low altitude environment (IAW AFI 11-214). Loss of
currency will require re-accomplishment of single ship low altitude familiarization (IP/Sq supervisor chased) IAW
para 6.7.6.8.
13. Supervision for flight or simulator will be a current and qualified FCF pilot.
14. FAC(A)s will perform two controls to update ASC currency, IAW the current JCAS FAC(A) MOA. No more
than two controls may be counted per CAS target or 9-line briefing. FAC(A)s will satisfy ASC currency and event
requirements by training with actual fighters and TACPs to the maximum extent possible. Failing to meet either
proficiency or currency will result in FAC(A) pilots being non-qualified.
15. For units with an MTC, this currency may be updated in the simulator as part of a tactical/EP sim profile.
16. For units with any type of simulator (UTD, MTT, NTC, MTC), this currency may be updated as part of a
tactical/EP sim profile.
17. See paragraph 4.6.9.
18. LOW ALT LGB currency applies to LANTIRN pilots conducting LGB attacks in a certified LOW ALT block
while operations are conducted using the LANTIRN system.

     4.6.2.1. Pilots must accomplish overdue training requirements as specified by the SQ/CC
     before they are considered requalified to perform the task. Training annotated as
     affecting CMR status will require regression to N-CMR until the pilot accomplishes the
     training. Training identified as not affecting CMR status does not require regression
     from CMR; however, it may result in grounding until the training is completed. The
     duration of grounding and status of sortie lookback will determine the effect on CMR
     status.
     4.6.2.2. Unless otherwise specified, supervisory requirements pertaining to recurrency
     may be satisfied in the cockpit or flight position that offers the best control of the
     mission, as determined by the SQ/CC.
  4.6.3. Landing Recurrency. Loss of landing currency requires the following action (timing
  starts from date of last landing):
     4.6.3.1. 31-90 Days (46-90 Days--Experienced). Regain landing currency.
     4.6.3.2. 91-135 Days. Same as paragraph 4.6.3.1, plus instructor supervised SIM
     (tactics, normal and emergency procedures for CMR pilots; normal, instrument, and
     emergency procedures for BMC pilots).
     4.6.3.3. 136-210 Days (136-225 for experienced). Same as paragraph 4.6.3.2, plus
     (CMR/BMC) closed and open book qualification examinations, EPE, and CAPs written
     examination.
     4.6.3.4. 211 (226 for experienced) or More Days. Requalification training IAW AFI
     11-202, Volume 1. Training will include landing recurrency, and appropriate weapons
     event initial qualification.
  4.6.4. ACBT Recurrency. Pilots losing currency in ACBT require action IAW the
  following paragraphs:
     4.6.4.1. 61-90 Days (91-120 Experienced). BFM (offensive and/or defensive).
     4.6.4.2. 91-180 Days (121-180 Experienced). BFM (offensive and/or defensive). Prior
     to commencing first BFM set, pilot requiring recurrency will accomplish AHC (One
     Vertical Recovery and one event from the HARTS series IAW AFTTP 3-3.5).
     4.6.4.3. Over 180 Days. Accomplish a SQ/CC tailored program IAW paragraph 3.4.5
  4.6.5. Loss of/Requalification to IP Status. IPs will be decertified for:
     4.6.5.1. Failure of a flight evaluation. To regain IP status, the IP must successfully
     complete a flight check IAW AFI 11-202V2.
     4.6.5.2. Failure of an INST/QUAL open book test. To regain IP status, the IP must
     successfully reaccomplish the written exam.
     4.6.5.3. Expiration of instructor currency. 91-180 days requires an instructor recurrency
     flight with an IP. Over 180 days requires a Stan/Eval flight evaluation IAW 11-2F-16V2.
     IP rear cockpit landing currency is 90 days. WIC student sorties count as instructor
     sorties for currency. Waiver authority is IAW 11-202v2 and 11-2F-16v2.
 32                                              AFI11-2F-16V1_AETCSUP_I 3 JULY 2013


      4.6.5.4. Loss of CMR/BMC status due to loss of currency in an event/sortie and the
      SQ/CC deems decertification is required. If the SQ/CC does not elect this option or if the
      instructor becomes noncurrent in events/sorties which do not require removal from
      CMR/BMC status, instructor status may be retained, but the IP will not instruct in that
      event/sortie until the required currency is regained.
   4.6.6. NVG Re-currency Mission. Pilots losing NVG currency must accomplish the
   following events prior to unrestricted night operations:
      4.6.6.1. 2-ship basic formation work / light drills and unit specific mission elements.
      4.6.6.2. Tactical turns and maneuvers.
      4.6.6.3. Minimum of one of the following night profiles/sorties:
          4.6.6.3.1. Intercept NVG-TI profile not to exceed 2v2, above 5,000 feet AGL or
          MSA whichever is higher, or
          4.6.6.3.2. 2-ship BSA (OG/CC waiverable up to 4-ship) above 4,500 feet AGL or
          MSA whichever is higher, or
          4.6.6.3.3. 2-ship Unopposed SAT / SEAD (OG/CC waiverable up to 4-ship) above
          4,500 feet AGL or MSA whichever is higher.
          4.6.6.3.4. CAS above 4,500 feet AGL or MSA whichever is higher.
   4.6.7. ASC Currency. Air strike control events only apply to FAC(A) qualified pilots and
   are IAW JCAS FAC(A) MOA (dated 24 Mar 05). Track each ASC performed by type as
   applicable for JCAS FAC(A) MOA documentation requirements. This currency only
   updates when FAC(A) qualified pilots act as the FAC(A) element lead. FAC(A)s will satisfy
   their requirements with ground units or TACPs whenever possible.
   4.6.8. MAJCOM/AOS Currency Requirements. Units will comply with AFI 11-207 for
   additional currencies required for the flight delivery of aircraft coordinated through any
   AOS.
   4.6.9. TFR Recurrency. Loss of TFR currency requires the following actions (timing starts
   from date of last event): CB-coded units may use single seat aircraft with a current/qualified
   IP or SQ CC-designated supervisor in a chase aircraft to update TFR currency requirements.
      4.6.9.1. 46-90 Days (61-90 Experienced). Regression to Medium Altitude until
      recurrent. Accomplish a night dual-supervised TFR event. Supervision required is an IP
      or SQ/CC-designated supervisor current and qualified in the event.
      4.6.9.2. 91-210 Days. Accomplish a LANTIRN SIM and a night dual-supervised TFR
      event.
      4.6.9.3. 211 Days-1 Year. Re-accomplish unit Low Altitude LANTIRN top-off training
      IAW locally tailored Chp 6 upgrade program.
      4.6.9.4. Over 1 Year. Accomplish LANTIRN requalification training.
4.7. Regression:
   4.7.1. CMR/BMC Regression for Failure to Meet Lookback. Only RAP training and
   Contingency Operations sorties may be used for lookback. If a pilot does not meet monthly
AFI11-2F-16V1_AETCSUP_I 3 JULY 2013                                                             33


   lookback requirements throughout the training cycle, SQ/CCs can either: Regress the pilot to
   N-CMR/N-BMC, as applicable; remove the pilot from a CMR/BMC manning position; or
   initiate action to remove the pilot from active flying status.
       4.7.1.1. Failure to meet 1-month RAP/Contingency Operations sortie lookback requires a
       review of the pilot's 3-month sortie history. If the 3-month lookback has been met, pilots
       may, at SQ/CC discretion, remain CMR/BMC. Failure to meet the 3-month lookback
       will result in regression to N-CMR/N-BMC status as appropriate, or the pilot may be
       placed in probation status for one month at the squadron commander's discretion. If
       probation is chosen, the only way to remove a pilot from probation and preserve the
       current status is to reestablish a 1-month lookback at the end of the probation period.
       Probation should not be used to disguise extended shortfalls in sorties that would result in
       underperforming the training cycle totals. Probation should be used sparingly.
       4.7.1.2. CMR/BMC pilots regressed to N-CMR/N-BMC for lookback, must complete a
       SQ/CC approved re-certification program to return the pilot to CMR/BMC standards.
       Upon completion of the re-certification program, the CMR/BMC pilots must also meet 1-
       month lookback requirement prior to reclaiming CMR/BMC status. The sorties and
       events accomplished during the re-certification program may be credited towards their
       total/type sortie and event requirements for the training cycle as well as for their monthly
       sortie requirement.
       4.7.1.3. Lookback computations begin following completion of MQT. The pilot must
       maintain 1-month lookback until 3-month lookback is established. SQ/CCs may apply
       probation rules as described in paragraph 4.7.1.1 if a new CMR/BMC pilot fails to meet
       1-month lookback while establishing 3-month lookback. In addition, 1-month lookback
       will start the first full month of CMR/BMC status.
   4.7.2. Regression for Weapons Qualification. Failure to maintain RAP tasked weapons
   qualification at the end of the training cycle may require regression to N-CMR/N-BMC.
   Refer to section 5.3.3 for requalification.
   4.7.3. Regression for Evaluation. Pilots who fail an aircraft qualification, mission, or
   instrument evaluation will be handled IAW AFI 11-202V2. Pilots will regress to N-CMR or
   N-BMC as applicable. These pilots will remain N-CMR/N-BMC until successfully
   completing required corrective action, a reevaluation, and are recertified by the SQ/CC.
4.8. End of Cycle Requirements. Pilots who fail to complete mission and/or event
requirements of this instruction at the end of the training cycle may require additional training
depending on the type and magnitude of the deficiency. Refer to paragraph 4.9 to see if some of
these requirements can be prorated. In all cases, report training shortfalls IAW paragraph
1.2.5.12
   4.8.1. Pilots failing to meet total training cycle RAP mission requirements may continue CT
   at CMR/BMC as determined by lookback. The SQ/CC will determine if additional training
   is required.
   4.8.2. Pilots failing to meet RAP mission type requirements will result in one of the
   following:
 34                                              AFI11-2F-16V1_AETCSUP_I 3 JULY 2013


         4.8.2.1. Regress to N-CMR/N-BMC if SQ/CC determines the mission type deficiency is
         significant. To regain CMR/BMC the pilot must complete all deficient sortie types.
         These sorties may count towards total requirements for the new training cycle.
         4.8.2.2. Continue at CMR/BMC if total RAP sorties and lookback are maintained and the
         sortie type deficiencies are deemed insignificant by the SQ/CC.
   4.8.3. Pilots failing to accomplish sorties required for Special Capabilities/Qualifications
   will lose their qualification. The SQ/CC will determine requalification requirements.
4.9. Proration of End-of-Cycle Requirements. At the end of the training cycle, the SQ/CC
may prorate all training requirements when DNIFs, emergency leaves, Consecutive Overseas
Tour (COT) leaves, non-flying TDY/exercises combat/contingency deployments, (ANG: and or
mandatory training required by civilian employment), preclude training for a portion of the
training period. Use Table 4.2 to determine proration. Normal leave will not be considered as
non-availability. Extended bad weather, which precludes the unit from flying for more than 15
consecutive days may be considered as non-availability. (ANG: End-of-cycle proration is
permitted for documented attrition (e.g. HHQ or weather cancels, MNDs, ground or air aborts) in
monthly increments when the total number of occurrences ranges from one half to one times the
individual’s normal monthly rate of flying). The following guidelines apply:

NOTES:
1. Supervision will be FL-qualified squadron supervisor or instructor, qualified and current
in the event/capability.
2. Recurrency supervision level is IP in aircraft or chase, qualified and current in event.
3. See Attachment 2 of the basic instruction for demanding/non-demanding sortie
definitions. In addition, WSOs will fly in a supervised status (with a FL-qualified SQ
supervisor or IP) any time a non-demanding sortie is required.
4. Currency is updated by accomplishing an A-A event with emphasis on blue element
employment contracts and deconfliction. Does not affect CMR. If non-current, must
accomplish a day event. Opposed Air-to-Ground sorties that fit the definition in A2.1.24 of
the basic instruction may update this currency.
5. Low Alt LGB currency applies to LANTIRN WSOs conducting LGB attacks in a
certified LOW ALT block while operations are conducted using the LANTIRN system.
6. Currency is required in the WSO’s low altitude category for operations below 1000 feet
(Table 6.1). Loss of currency requires regression to the next higher altitude block.
Operations in a lower block will update the higher block categories. Re-currency requires
satisfactory performance in the following events: vertical awareness training, hard turns,
tactical formation, and offensive/defensive maneuvering.
7. Must be current in NVG Refresher Academics. Supervision will be an NVG current,
 36                                                 AFI11-2F-16V1_AETCSUP_I 3 JULY 2013


qualified pilot in the aircraft, or current FL-qualified SQ supervisor or IP in the element.
8. For units with any type of simulator (UTD, MTT, NTC, MTC), this currency may be
updated as part of a tactical/EP simulator profile.
9. See paragraph 4.6.9 of the basic instruction.
10. Updated by an actual weapons release on a class A/B/C range.
   4.9.1. Proration will only be used to adjust for genuine circumstances of training non-
   availability and not to mask maintenance, FHP execution, training or planning deficiencies.
   4.9.2. Proration is based on cumulative days of non-availability for flying in the training
   cycle. Use Table 4.2. to determine the number of months to be prorated based on the
   cumulative number of calendar days the pilot was not available for flying during the training
   cycle.
   4.9.3. If IQT or MQT is reaccomplished a pilot's training cycle will start over at a prorated
   share following completion of IQT/MQT training.
   4.9.4. Example: Capt Jones was granted 17 days of emergency leave in January and
   attended SOS in residence from March through April for 56 consecutive calendar days. His
   SQ/CC authorized a total of two months proration from his training cycle (two months for
   the 73 cumulative days of non-availability for flying). (ANG: Maj Smith is an experienced
   CMR pilot with a normal monthly requirement of 6 sorties. He had eight attrition occurences
   throughout the training cycle, therefore his SQ/CC can prorate one month of Maj Smith’s
   training requirements).
   4.9.5. Prorated numbers resulting in fractions of less than 0.5 will be rounded to the next
   lower whole number; however, no requirement may be prorated below one.
   4.9.6. Newly assigned/converted pilots and pilots achieving CMR/BMC after the 15th of the
   month are considered to be in CT on the first day of the following month for proration
   purposes. A prorated share of RAP sorties must be completed in CT.
   4.9.7. Night and AAR requirements accomplished during MQT may be credited toward
   prorated CT requirements if accomplished during the cycle in which the pilot was declared
   CMR/BMC unless specified otherwise by MAJCOM.
   4.9.8. A pilot's last month on station prior to departing PCS may be prorated provided 1
   month's proration is not exceeded. Individuals departing PCS may be considered CMR for
   reporting purposes until loss of CMR currency, port call date, or sign in at new duty station,
   whichever occurs first.
   4.9.9. CMR pilots who attend USAF Weapons School in TDY-and-return status may be
   reported throughout the TDY as CMR. Upon return, those pilots will accomplish a prorated
   share of sortie/ event requirements (see Table 4.2).
   4.9.10. Contingency Operations. Contingency operations can have a positive or negative
   impact on a unit's CT program, as emphasis is on supporting the actual contingency. A
   potential lack of training opportunities while supporting contingency operations can place a
   burden on the unit, forcing it to accomplish the majority of its CT program in a reduced
   period of time or with reduced assets. The following proration procedures are intended to
   provide flexibility in accomplishing the unit's CT program.
AFI11-2F-16V1_AETCSUP_I 3 JULY 2013                                                         37


      4.9.10.1. Missions flown during contingency operations do not count toward RAP
      requirements, but may be used for lookback purposes. RAP events accomplished during
      contingency operations may be used to update currencies (i.e. landing currency) but they
      do not count toward training cycle requirements (Exception: AAR can be used to update
      currencies and count toward training cycle requirements). (ANG/AFRC: individuals
      deployed for more than a seven-day period may prorate a one-month portion of RAP
      missions and events.)
      4.9.10.2. As the training quality of missions flown at contingency locations may vary
      considerably, OG/CCs are authorized to allow sorties that provided valid training to be
      logged as RAP sorties. Events accomplished on these sorties count toward RAP event
      requirements, and these sorties/events may not be prorated.
      4.9.10.3. Upon return from contingency operations, units will prorate the sorties for the
      entire deployment, subtracted by the number of valid OG/CC-authorized RAP missions.
      The result is the allowable sortie proration. SQ/CCs will prorate based on the events
      accomplished during valid RAP missions. In all cases, negative numbers equate to zero.
4.10. Regaining CMR/BMC Status:
   4.10.1. If CMR/BMC status is lost due to failure to meet the end of cycle weapons
   qualifications and/or event requirements, requalification is IAW paragraph 5.3.3
   4.10.2. If CMR/BMC status is lost due to failure to meet lookback IAW paragraph 4.7.1, the
   following applies (timing starts from the date the pilot came off CMR/BMC status):
      4.10.2.1. Up to 90 Days. The pilot must complete SQ/CC directed re-certification
      program in accordance with paragraph 4.7.1.2 In addition, all RAP event currencies must
      be regained. The SQ/CC will approve any other additional training prior to re-
      certification to CMR.
      4.10.2.2. 91-180 Days. Same as above, plus Stan/Eval generated open and closed book
      written examinations.
      4.10.2.3. 181 Days and Beyond: Reaccomplish MQT to include a Form 8 Mission
      Evaluation.
4.11. Example of the Lookback, Regression, Proration, and Requalification Process:
   4.11.1. Capt Smith is an experienced CMR pilot in ACC with a 1 and 3 month lookback
   requirement of 9 and 27 RAP missions respectively. On 3 Feb, he flew an ACBT sortie prior
   to departing for a non-flying TDY for two months. He reported back for flight duty on 6
   Apr. What is his status throughout his TDY and on his return?
      4.11.1.1. The SQ/CC wanted to list Capt Smith as a countable CMR pilot for reporting
      purposes throughout the TDY. Therefore, on 1 Mar, his Flt/CC performed the mandatory
      1-month lookback (Feb) on Capt Smith. He only flew one RAP sortie, failing the 1-
      month lookback. The Flt/CC then performed a 3-month lookback (Dec, Jan, Feb). This
      showed that he flew only 24 sorties for this period. Had he flown three more sorties, his
      SQ/CC could continue Capt Smith at CMR. With 21 sorties, Capt Smith did not meet the
      3-month lookback for a CMR pilot. The SQ/CC could regress Capt Smith to N-CMR,
      but instead elected to put him on probation, still carrying him as CMR.

     4.11.1.2. The SQ/CC decided to carry Capt Smith on probation for one month. On 1
     Apr, Capt Smith's 1 month lookback (Mar) was 0 sorties. The SQ/CC must now regress
     Capt Smith to N-CMR. When Capt Smith returns, the SQ/CC will have to place him in a
     re-certification program. Upon completing this program, Capt Smith will need to re-
     establish his 1-month lookback by 1 May. Failing to do so would force him to be
     reported N-CMR one more month until the next lookback process on 1 June.
     4.11.1.3. If he had returned on 22 Mar, and had last landed the jet 48 days ago, he could
     fly a non-demanding sortie to regain demanding sortie and landing currency. For CMR
     purposes, Capt Smith would need to complete 9 RAP missions to recapture his 1-month
     lookback and get off probation. Although Capt Smith was still CMR in Mar, the SQ/CC
     flew him with an IP on his first few sorties to regain his landing, AAR, LOWAT, and
     Formation T/O and Landing currencies.
     4.11.1.4. At the end of the training cycle on 30 Jun, the SQ/CC prorated 2 months off of
     Capt Smith's total requirements. In spite of this proration, Capt Smith was deficient in
     one mission category. The SQ/CC could regress Capt Smith to N-CMR if deemed
     significant. After accomplishing the tailored recertification program (in this case, the
     deficient sorties), the SQ/CC would recertify Capt Smith to CMR. This training counts
     for the new training cycle.

4.12. Instrument Training.
   4.12.1. An instrument training program will be developed IAW AFM 11-210.
   4.12.2. Units which seldom encounter bad weather and/or night recoveries should exercise
   pilots and approach facilities by periodically simulating "weather day" recovery operations,
   as determined by the SQ/CC.
   4.12.3. Pilots transferring from another MAJCOM require the theater-specific portions of
   IRC before flying without a theater-experienced pilot in the formation. MQT academics and
   the MQT LAO mission may satisfy this requirement.
 40                                               AFI11-2F-16V1_AETCSUP_I 3 JULY 2013


   4.12.4. RAP events may be accomplished on an instrument mission provided
   accomplishment does not interfere with the primary goal of instrument training. The
   transition from instruments to visual references should be practiced on all instrument
   approaches. An instrument sortie is a basic skills requirement and may be credited toward
   monthly RAP lookback only IAW the RTM.
4.13. G-Awareness Continuation Training. Units will develop a CT program that provides
feedback to pilots and imprints a proper L-1 AGSM so that it becomes an integral part of pulling
Gs.
   4.13.1. The basis of this program is to give each FL, SQ supervisor, flight surgeon and, if
   available, aerospace physiologist the skills needed to evaluate a flight member's AVTR to
   ensure a proper AGSM is being performed. This program also makes assessment of the
   AGSM a normal debrief item after every flight. The assessment should be done as a normal
   part of AVTR assessment while reviewing other tactical portions of the mission.
   4.13.2. Use the following minimum guidance to implement the unit's program:
       4.13.2.1. AGSM technique and assessment will be incorporated into the squadron CT
       program. Emphasis will be placed on briefing, debriefing, and assessing the L-1 AGSM
       using the AVTR in the debrief on a daily basis. FLs, IPs, SQ supervisors, and flight
       surgeons should become adept at assessing and teaching the correct AGSM. Academics
       will include a discussion of the limitations imposed on aircraft performance as a result of
       an ineffective AGSM.
       4.13.2.2. The G-awareness exercise will be flown IAW the guidance in AFI 11-2F-16V3.
       4.13.2.3. FLs will assess the AGSM effectiveness of flight members during mission
       debriefings. This assessment should not be limited to the G-awareness exercise.
       Evaluate the AGSM after the pilot has had the time to fatigue to get an accurate
       assessment of a pilot's AGSM during a tactically and G-demanding portion of flight.
       AGSM should also be evaluated under relatively low intensity G such as A/S sorties.
       4.13.2.4. An A/A mission tape for each pilot will be reviewed each training cycle by the
       squadron flight surgeon, aerospace physiologist, or a squadron supervisor. The reviews
       will be documented.
   4.13.3. FLs or SQ supervisors will identify pilots having poor AGSM technique or low G-
   tolerance to the Flt/CC or appropriate operations supervisor. The SQ/DO or appropriate
   operations supervisor will determine what action is required to improve the pilot's G-
   tolerance. The SQ/CC will determine if refresher training is required IAW AFI 11-404.

                      WEAPONS EMPLOYMENT QUALIFICATION

5.1. General. This chapter outlines requirements for attaining initial qualification and
maintaining CT qualification in the employment of air-to-surface and air-to-air weapons. Refer
to "Glossary of Missions/Sorties/Events" at Attachment 2 for further guidance on weapons
qualifications.
5.2. Initial qualification (QUAL): Pilots must attain initial qualification in any weapon or
weapon category listed as QUAL in the RAP Tasking memo. Initial qualification can be attained
in IQT or MQT, and may be credited toward CT qualification requirements.
   5.2.1. Initial qualification and requalification in a weapon or weapon category is satisfied
   when the pilot has achieved a minimum of 3 hits out of 6 consecutive employment attempts.
   Initial qualification will carry over for consecutive F-16 assignments.
5.3. CT qualification (QUAL): Pilots must maintain qualification in any weapon or weapon
category listed as QUAL in the RAP Tasking memo. These criteria establish the minimum
standards for a pilot to maintain qualification and do not necessarily determine evaluation criteria
established by other instructions or agencies (e.g., inspection/evaluation teams).
   5.3.1. CT weapons employment will be from tactical deliveries or intercepts simulating
   realistic employment of UCML munitions, and IAW all appropriate guidance. To maintain a
   combat perspective during training, CT air-to-surface weapons employment qualification
   requirements will be accomplished using full scale live/inert munitions and Standard
   Conventional Loads (SCLs) to the maximum extent possible. To achieve this, units should
   schedule full scale live/inert munitions such that every CMR pilot and the maximum number
   of aircraft have the opportunity to expend.
   5.3.2. QUAL for air-to-surface weapons requires a hit rate of 50 percent when compared to
   total employment attempts. QUAL for air-to-air weapons requires a 75% hit rate (valid at
   pickle/trigger squeeze) when compared to total employment attempts. Hit criteria is IAW
   AFTTP 3-1 and/or this Volume, as applicable. The RAP Tasking memo further defines
   QUAL requirements based on the training cycle.
       5.3.2.1. Video assessment. 100% of guided air-to-surface and air-to-air weapons
       employment qualification requirements can be video assessed. Unguided Munitions and
       Strafe require actual weapons employment. Squadron Commanders can waive the
       requirement for actual weapons employment in locations where limited range availability
       prohibits sufficient employment opportunities, provided and equal number of dry, video-
       assessed attempts are accomplished.
       5.3.2.2. At the end of the training cycle, each pilot's weapons employment statistics
       (hit/miss percentages) will be reviewed to assess qualifications. Weapons employment
       qualifications are valid through the subsequent training cycle.
   5.3.3. Failure to Qualify: Failure to qualify in one weapon or weapon category does not
   invalidate qualification in others. SQ/CCs may declare a pilot unqualified in a weapon or
   weapon category at any time during a training cycle without affecting other weapon
   employment qualifications. If qualification is required at CMR/BMC, failure to qualify will

   result in regression to N-CMR/N-BMC until requalification is accomplished IAW paragraph
   5.2.1
5.4. Familiarization (FAM): Familiarization for weapons does not require a hit rate when
compared to total employment attempts. The RAP Tasking memo further defines FAM
requirements based on the training cycle.
5.5. Weapons Employment Parameters. The event requirements and parameters listed below
form the basic framework for pilot weapons employment training. All weapons employment
will conform to the limits established for each specific event. Pattern descriptions, procedures,
training rules, and foul criteria are contained in AFI 11-2F-16V3 and AFI 11-214. Events
performed at night may require higher minimum recovery altitudes based on AFI 11-214 Night
Training Rules.
   5.5.1. Strafe Events. Tactical Strafe (TAC STRF) is a combined event.                   Any
   combination of LAS and/or HAS hits satisfies this training requirement. Each pass is a
   standalone event for weapons employment qualification with a maximum of 3 passes per
   sortie. Hit criteria (regardless of aircraft rounds limiter setting): acoustically scored or
   independently observed impacts on a point target, or bullet dispersion within 36 feet of any
   target. For VTR assessment: a stabilized pipper on target during witness cue.
       5.5.1.1. Low Angle Strafe (LAS). Planned dive angle 15 degrees or less.        Minimum
       recovery altitude is 75 feet AGL. Foul line is 2,000 feet.
       5.5.1.2. High Angle Strafe (HAS). Planned dive angle greater than 15 degrees.
           5.5.1.2.1. Day High Angle Strafe minimum recovery altitudes are 1,000 feet AGL for
           planned dive angles 30 degrees or less and 1,500 feet AGL for planned dive angles
           above 30 degrees.
           5.5.1.2.2. Night High Angle Strafe HIGH Illum minimum recovery altitudes are
           1,000 feet AGL for planned dive angles 30 degrees or less and 1,500 feet AGL for
           planned dive angles above 30 degrees if qualified to execute below MSA at night.
           5.5.1.2.3. Night High Angle Strafe LOW Illum minimum recovery altitudes are
           1,000 feet AGL or MSA whichever is higher for planned dive angles 30 degrees or
           less and 1,500 feet AGL or MSA whichever is higher for planned dive angles above
           30 degrees.
       5.5.1.3. (Added-AETC) Pilots will use the range cue techniques found on the current F-
       16 Tactical Strafe card in AFTTP 3-1.F-16 for all TAC STRF attacks.
   5.5.2. Guided Munitions Events:
       5.5.2.1. AGM-65 Maverick. A delivery initiated from a level, diving, or pop-up
       maneuver to achieve line-of-sight to the target(s). Acquisition, missile lock-on and
       launch, or 2 seconds stable lock-on in "No launch" conditions, followed by a tactical
       escape maneuver is required. Hit criteria: Either actual target impact or valid, recorded
       TGM simulated weapon release within launch parameters with stabilized target tracking.
       May be accomplished in a simulator (AFRC: N/A).
       5.5.2.2. Laser Guided Bomb (LGB). An event in which a combat/training laser is
       employed to self-lase simulated/actual ordnance during an LGB delivery. Minimum
AFI11-2F-16V1_AETCSUP_I 3 JULY 2013                                                           43


     recovery is safe escape/fuze arm/guide time required for the ordnance being
     simulated/delivered. Hit criteria: IAW AFTTP 3-1.
     5.5.2.3. Inertially Aided Munition (IAM). An event in which an aircraft system is used
     to determine release parameters for JDAM, JASSM, JSOW or WCMD weapons.
     Simulated or actual delivery of ordnance is required. Minimum recovery is safe escape
     for the ordnance being simulated/delivered. Hit criteria: IAW AFTTP 3-1.
     5.5.2.4. GBU-54 Laser JDAM. For weapons qualifications purposes, laser JDAM will
     be counted towards either an LGB or IAM event, depending on the mode of terminal
     guidance. If the bomb receives terminal laser guidance, it is and LGB event. Bomb-on-
     coordinate (BOC) deliveries (without terminal laser guidance) are IAM events
     5.5.2.5. AGM-88 High Speed Antiradiation Missile (HARM). Maneuver as required
     to achieve weapon employment. Acquisition and launch may be performed from a level,
     climbing, or diving maneuver to achieve firing parameters. A maximum of 4 HTS and 4
     HAS shots may be credited toward qualification per mission. 4 HAS shots per training
     cycle must be with a CATM. Hit criteria: valid HARM launch (actual or simulated)
     IAW AFTTP 3-1 shot criteria at pickle as determined by VTR review.
  5.5.3. Unguided Munitions Events: Unguided Bomb (UGB) is a combined event. Any
  combination of hits from the following list of events satisfies this training requirement.
     5.5.3.1. Visual Level Delivery (VLD). Is a delivery with less than five degrees of climb
     or dive at weapons release (non-maneuvering) using any means of delivery with visual
     target acquisition/designation. Minimum altitude is safe separation/escape/fuze arm for

     qualification or range/target area restrictions, whichever is higher. Hit criteria: 195 feet
     (60m).
     5.5.3.3. Low Angle High Drag (LAHD). Planned dive angle is less than 30 degrees.
     Minimum recovery altitude is safe escape for ordnance being simulated/delivered, or as
     required to recover above 100 feet AGL (300 feet on a Class B/C range or over water), or
     one-half the computed altitude loss from bomb release to recovery, whichever is higher.
     Hit criteria: 75 feet (23m) for computed deliveries; 105 feet (32m) for manual; or within
     the target area or impacting the vertical panel in the skip target.
     5.5.3.4. Low Angle Low Drag (LALD). Planned dive angle is less than 30 degrees.
     Minimum recovery altitude is safe escape for ordnance being simulated/delivered or as

       for target acquisition, tracking and weapons release) approaches the target at low altitude,
       makes a definite pull-up at a given point, releases the bomb at a predetermined point
       during the pull-up while maximizing standoff range or weapons effects. Minimum run-
       in/recovery altitude is the pilot's minimum low altitude qualification or range/target area
       restrictions, whichever is higher. Hit criteria: 750 feet (229m).
       5.5.3.11. Special Weapons Event. A delivery which utilizes all applicable nuclear

AFI11-2F-16V1_AETCSUP_I 3 JULY 2013                                                      45


as many types of weapons on the unit's UCML as possible. To provide this opportunity, pilots
should expend the following ordnance:
   5.6.1. Three Unguided Munitions FSWD (IAW Attachment 1 definition) per training cycle.
   5.6.2. Two actual IAM per training cycle.
   5.6.3. Two actual LGB per training cycle.

                                 SPECIALIZED TRAINING

6.1. Specialized Training Programs. This chapter outlines upgrade training programs for
special capabilities and qualifications. These programs are intended to provide a basic starting
point and should be modified by the SQ/CC based on the unit's requirements and/or the
upgradee's previous experience, qualifications, and documented performance. Unless governed
by a formal syllabus, ground and device training for these programs will consist of unit-
developed academics and scenarios. Flight training will be conducted in accordance with a
program approved by the SQ/CC.
6.2. Flight Lead (FL) Upgrade. This program establishes the minimum guidelines for those
pilots identified by the SQ/CC to upgrade to flight lead. This program takes an F-16 pilot with
demonstrated tactical proficiency as a wingman and teaches flight leadership and decision-
making.
   6.2.1. Initial entry may be as a two-ship/element FL until experience and proficiency warrant
   further progression, in which case, responsibilities for employment will not exceed two
   aircraft until certified as a four-ship FL. The SQ/CC will determine when a two-ship FL may
   train toward larger, more complex formations (three- or four-ship).
   6.2.2. The following minimum flying hours are required prior to entering FL upgrade
   training:
       6.2.2.1. 300 hours F-16, or
       6.2.2.2. 200 hours F-16 with 400 hours IP/FP/MP in a 11Fxx, 11K3C, or 11K3D, 11K3F
       AFSC, or
       6.2.2.3. 50 hours F-16, if previously qualified as a 11Fxx AFSC flight lead.
       6.2.2.4. -(ANG, AFRC) For converting units, OG/CC's may select prior flight lead
       qualified pilots to upgrade to flight lead concurrently with the MQT top off program
       regardless of PAI hours.
   6.2.3. Ground Training. Ground training will consist of locally developed instruction in
   the following areas. Add unit specific ground training items for unique ordnance, pods, or
   capabilities.
       6.2.3.1. FL Responsibilities. FL/wingman relationship, airmanship, judgment and
       maturity should be addressed as they relate to flying and squadron related duties.
       6.2.3.2. Mission Preparation. Mission objectives, wingman requirements and
       responsibilities, currencies, capabilities, delegation of mission planning duties, and
       briefing preparation.
       6.2.3.3. Conduct of Flight Briefings and Debriefings. Objectives, use of briefing
       guides and audiovisual aids, flight member involvement, briefing techniques,
       debriefing/questioning techniques, tape review responsibilities and procedures.
       6.2.3.4. Conduct of Missions. Control of flight, flight discipline, emergency
       procedures, training rules, and responsibilities to SQ/CC.
AFI11-2F-16V1_AETCSUP_I 3 JULY 2013                                                             47


     6.2.3.5. AGSM Techniques. Briefing, debriefing, and AVTR assessment.
     6.2.3.6. IFEs and Emergency Diverts. Divert decisions as an element, support of
     wingman during EPs, FL responsibility and authority, min fuel planning, and ATC
     assistance.
     6.2.3.7. Simulator Training. To the maximum extent possible, high-fidelity simulator
     training should be incorporated into FL upgrade. SIM missions should precede flight
     training whenever possible and reinforce common errors allowing upgrade pilots to
     repeatedly practice upgrade tasks. Emergency procedures, lost wingman, and instrument
     training should be demonstrated in the sim.
  6.2.4. Flight Training. Flight training will be conducted in accordance with an upgrade
  program approved by the SQ/CC. Missions may be flown in any order. The program
  outlined below provides a basic starting point and may be modified by squadron commanders
  based on unit needs and/or upgradee's previous experience, qualifications, and documented
  performance. All FLUG training will be under the supervision of an IP or flight lead-
  qualified squadron supervisor flying as the upgrading student’s wingman. Dissimilar
  adversaries should be used to the maximum extent practical during FLUG training. Units
  will add considerations/techniques for specialized capability (TGP, HTS, etc) to applicable
  areas.
     6.2.4.1. FLUG Event Requirements. Two formation takeoffs and landings, a day or
     night aerial refueling, trail departure, and a trail recovery will be accomplished as a flight
     lead during the program.
     6.2.4.2. Night Employment. Employment with NVGs is integral to night missions in
     every upgrade program. Include some non-NVG events in FLUG training. All A-G
     missions may be completed in the day or night to include certification.
     6.2.4.3. FLUG-BFM--Mission Objectives. Practice leading and controlling a 1v1 BFM
     mission including WVR and BVR setups. Specific Mission Tasks: Briefing, WVR
     setups, intercepts to BFM, weapons employment, mission reconstruction and debriefing,
     tape review/assessment (to include AGSM).
     6.2.4.4. FLUG-ACM--Mission Objectives. Practice leading and controlling a 2v1(+1)
     ACM mission including WVR and BVR setups. Specific Mission Tasks: Briefing, perch

Students must complete all missions in the following profiles to gain FAC(A) certification IAW
Joint Directives and will not proficiency advance. Squadrons may not deviate from these
profiles, and OG/CC is the waiver authority for all FAC(A) training.
   6.8.1. Upgrade Administration. FAC(A) certification (upgrade) training will be IAW the
   current Joint Close Air Support FAC(A) Memorandum of Agreement (JMOA). The JMOA
   defines the Joint Mission Task List (JMTL) for a FAC(A) to attain certification and maintain
   qualification/currency, and the SQ/CC will ensure all of these JMTLs are met in the course of
   training. Following the upgrade, FAC(A)s will be capable of performing all FAC(A) mission
   tasks defined in the current JMOA. OG/CCs or their designated squadron commander
AFI11-2F-16V1_AETCSUP_I 3 JULY 2013                                                        59


  representatives have authority to waive any JMOA experience requirements for upgrade
  entry based on commanders' judgment of experience level.
     6.8.1.1. To ensure standardization and efficiency, MAJCOMs/Fighter Wings are
     authorized and encouraged to adopt this instruction as their sole guidance for conducting
     FAC(A) training in lieu of local syllabi.
     6.8.1.2. Training at the F-16 RTU is available to reduce burden on home-station training.
     AETC RTU OG/CC is responsible for coordinating and adjudicating RTU course
     apportionment IAW MAJCOM requirements. When the RTU is conducting training for
     other MAJCOM pilots, AETC RTU OG and unit OG are the combined waiver authority
     for prerequisites or waivers.
     6.8.1.3. Units will ensure FAC(A)s maintain qualification and currency IAW the JMOA.
     SQ/CCs must ensure upgrades meet JMOA specific requirements for number and types
     of controls. Re-qualification will include at least one day and night mission defined by
     the SQ/CC that meet re-qualification control requirements. Pilots will log any FAC(A)
     evaluations required by the JMOA in either their CAS control log and/or with a squadron
     standard gradesheet. These evaluations do not require a Form 8, do not require a SEFE to
     conduct the evaluation. Qualification as a FAC(A) IP also qualifies the IP to conduct
     FAC(A) evaluations.
     6.8.1.4. Prior to FAC(A) certification, the SQ/CC will personally interview the UP and
     review FAC(A) responsibilities and authority. The SQ/CC will certify the new FAC(A)’s
     status, including any restrictions, in appropriate written format (grade sheet, training
     folder, Letter of Xs, etc.). The FAC(A) will log all controls accomplished during and
     after training in the JCAS AP MOA Appendix A format as part of their training
     documentation.
     6.8.1.5. Pilots identified for FAC(A) upgrade must meet the following minimum
     requirements. Track 1 produces mission capable F-16 FAC(A)s. Track 2 produces
     FAC(A) instructors. Track 3 produces a FAC(A) pilot and instructor from a previously

6.10. Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System (JHMCS) Qualification Training. The purpose
of this program is to train IPs, flight leads, and wingmen in JHMCS high off-boresight system
(HOBS) operation and employment. The program outlined below provides a basic starting point
and may be modified by SQ/CC based on unit needs, previous experience, qualifications, and
documented performance. This upgrade is not required if >50% of MQT sorties were flown with
a JHMCS.
   6.10.1. Ground Training. Pilots upgrading to JHMCS must complete the following
   requirements prior to their first sortie:
       6.10.1.1. JHMCS Academics. Initial academics will be accomplished locally or during
       simulator orientation (if available). Academic courseware will be approved by
       ACC/TRSS. Academics will be accomplished within 60 days prior to the first JHMCS
       qualification sortie. If more than 60 days elapse between academics and the first sortie,
       pilots will re-accomplish academics.
       6.10.1.2. JHMCS Simulator Orientation Training. Although AIM-9X capability
       should be incorporated into unit MTCs with M3.3+ OFP, JHMCS-modified simulators
       may not be available for initial orientation training. If a SIM with JHMCS is available,
       pilots will complete JHMCS SIM-1 prior to flight.
AFI11-2F-16V1_AETCSUP_I 3 JULY 2013                                                             65


           6.10.1.2.1. JHMCS SIM-1 Mission Objectives. Introduce JHMCS preflight, ground
           operations, radar/missile cueing and employment, JHMCS degraded and failure
           modes, system limitations, emergency egress, ejection, and human factors
           implications (display fixation, fatigue, etc.). Specific Tasks: JHMCS preflight, strap-
           in, boresight, switchology/HOTAS functions, ground operations, JHMCS and AIM-
           9X Built-in Test (BIT) and indications, fence check, weapons/radar/navigation

           and missile (AIM-9M/X) cueing and employment, AIM-9X Link16 cueing, "uplook"
           cueing orientation, declutter modes, and after landing checks. Special subjects to be
           emphasized during all JHMCS training include the potential for display fixation and
           ejection risks.
   6.10.2. General Instructions
       6.10.2.1. CMR/BMC pilots may conduct JHMCS training separately or as part of any
       upgrade.
       6.10.2.2. JHMCS-IPUG can be flown in conjunction with unit IPUG program.
   6.10.3. Flying Training. Provided a suitable JHMCS capable simulator is available, and
   JHMCS SIM-1 is accomplished, squadron commanders may waive the requirement for
   JHMCS-BFM for experienced pilots. IPs must complete JHMCS-IPUG before they can be
   designated a JHMCS IP by SQ/CC. To the max extent practical, AIM-9X CATMs should be
   employed during A-A JHMCS missions.
       6.10.3.1. JHMCS-A/A. Mission Objectives: Introduce/practice A-A training using
       JHMCS. Specific Mission Tasks: Practice JHMCS ground procedures, HOTAS
       operation, display interpretation, radar and missile cueing, airborne uplook alignment and
       HMD re-alignment G-awareness exercise, JHMCS display orientation, fence check, off-
       boresight radar/missile cueing exercise, uplook cueing.
       6.10.3.2. JHMCS-A/G. Mission Objectives: Introduce/practice A-G employment using
       JHMCS. Specific Mission Tasks: G-awareness exercise, low level navigation, defensive
       reactions, 2-ship low/medium altitude tactical SAT attacks, CAS wheel attacks, and
       JHMCS/HOBS recce / weapons employment considerations (with TGP if available).
       6.10.3.3. JHMCS-IPUG. Mission Objectives: Evaluation of the IP’s ability to brief,
       lead, and debrief a JHMCS qualification mission. The IP will demonstrate the ability to
       instruct JHMCS/HOBS employment and to manage the scenario to achieve the desired
       learning outcomes.
6.11. Alert Camera. CMR/BMC pilots with an operational requirement to fly with cameras on
active air defense alert missions will complete this training. Ground training will be coordinated
through the squadron training officer and unit intel, and is only required prior to being scheduled
for alert duty where flight with a camera is required by an ATO. Possessing an adequate supply
of cameras to equip a normally tasked number of alert aircraft and having a plan to accomplish
training as described above satisfies the requirement to have an alert camera capability. Use of
cameras will be IAW AFI 11-202V3 paragraph 2.5.1 and applicable MAJCOM supplements.
    66                                              AFI11-2F-16V1_AETCSUP_I 3 JULY 2013


      6.11.1. Ground training will cover operation of a basic point-and-shoot camera and
      intelligence gathering techniques, MAJCOM/local restrictions on the use of cameras in the
      cockpit, and hands-on cockpit training in the best available training device.
6.12. Low Altitude Step-Down Training (LASDT). This training is normally conducted as
part of IQT. It may be used to requalify pilots who are significantly out of currency or to train
pilots to a lower category.
      6.12.1. To conduct low altitude operations safely, pilots need to be knowledgeable of aircraft
      handling and performance characteristics, tactical formation, intercept, offensive
      maneuvering, defensive reactions, and navigation. LASDT qualifies pilots to conduct low
      altitude training (LOWAT) at or below 1,000 feet AGL. LOWAT block/category
      certification is required prior to performing unsupervised operations in that block/category.
      6.12.2. To provide a structured approach, the step-down training program is built on a multi-
      phase training process IAW Table 6.1 There is no time limit to progress beyond Category I
      and progress will be based upon individual pilot proficiency and training availability. All
      LASDT missions will be supervised by an IP or FL-qualified SQ supervisor who has
      completed LASDT training and is current in the LOWAT category being instructed.

Table 6.1. LOWAT Categories.

Category                    Altitude Block                    Upgrade Sorties To Certify

I                           1,000-500                         LASDT-1, LASDT-2, LASDT-3

II                          Below 500-300                     LASDT-5, LASDT-6, LASDT-7

III                         Below 300-100                     LASDT-8, LASDT-9, LASDT-10

      6.12.3. Category I qualification is a minimum requirement for CMR status. Units may
      accept a transfer pilot's LOWAT qualification from other units. Category II training may not
      be conducted during MQT.
      6.12.4. Entry into LASDT (other than at FTU) requires SQ/CC approval. The altitude to
      which a pilot is certified is determined by the SQ/CC and based on the lowest altitude at
      which all tasks can be comfortably performed and proficiency demonstrated. The goal is
      proficiency down to the minimum altitude compatible with squadron mission. Upon
      successful completion of LASDT training, the SQ/CC will certify the pilot to the minimum
      approved altitude of the LASDT category. Squadrons may accept documented LASDT
      certification for pilots coming from other units/commands. With SQ/CC approval, low
      altitude training conducted at a formal course may be used to fulfill applicable requirements
      of this paragraph.
      6.12.5. LASDT will be scheduled and briefed as a primary portion of the mission.
      Compatible RAP CT events may be accomplished in conjunction with LASDT as long as the
      objectives of the LASDT sortie are met. LASDT will not be flown as an alternate mission.
AFI11-2F-16V1_AETCSUP_I 3 JULY 2013                                                            67

6.13. Armed Tactical Reconnaissance. Armed Tactical Reconnaissance is a RAP special
capability to support unit DOC requirements or AEF tasking. The minimum requirement for
pilot training is academics. Conduct familiarization training in a compatible simulator if
resources are available. If excess sorties are available, a familiarization flight (during a RAP
mission) is desired to assist training maintenance and intel personnel. Unless directed by the
SQ/CC, no dedicated flight training is required.
6.14. F-16 Block Differences Training. To train between all variants of the F-16, pilots must
be current and qualified prior to beginning training. Using 11-202 Vol 1 definitions, CCIP
aircraft conversion requires differences training only; out-of-cycle checkrides are not required.
   6.14.1. Academics. Academic instruction should be tailored to the pilot's previous
   experience and should concentrate on the differences between the two blocks. Instruction
   should address avionics system, electrical systems, engine differences (as applicable), flight
   control system differences (as applicable), aircraft handling characteristics (including
   departure susceptiblity), EPs, OBOGS normal and emergency operation (if transitioning from
   a LOX equipped A/C), both A/A and A/G radar modes, and cockpit layouts. If available, an
   AETC formal course (such as Blk 50 course) meet the requirements for academics and
   device training.
   6.14.2. Device Training. Pilots should receive simulator training as required by previous
   experience. This simulator should include systems EPs, practice instrument procedures,
   review of radar and intercept procedures, review of air-to-ground systems, and CAPs. Pilots
   assigned/attached to units without concurrent simulators will substitute two SEPTs for the
   simulator.
   6.14.3. Flying Training. Block differences training may be conducted during MQT. Pilots
   who do not require MQT should receive one supervised aircraft sortie. Flight briefing should
   stress cockpit procedures and employment techniques.
6.15. Contingency/Exercise Spin-Up Training. This training will be conducted prior to
support of contingency operations (if time permits) or exercises. The objective of this training is
to ensure the pilot's ability to conduct all missions in support of expected tasking. For

responsible for referring to appropriate EXPLANS and contacting appropriate exercise POCs
prior to deployment to determine expected mission taskings. These EXPLANS include
COMACC EXPLANS 80 for Red, Maple, and Coalition Flags, EXPLANS 323 for Air Warrior
1, and EXPLANS 163 for Air Warrior 2. This assures the units are prepared for the appropriate
tasking and allows the responding OG/CC to tailor this training for the theater, threat, and tactics
for the assigned task. The SQ/CC is then responsible for implementation of this spin-up,
prosecuting the required missions, and determining the specific requirements necessary to reach
the desired level of proficiency. Emphasis will be placed on training needed for missions not
accomplished in daily operations. This training will be conducted IAW all applicable
instructions.
   6.15.1. If a pilot is not assigned to the tasked squadron, they must receive spin-up training as
   determined by the tasked SQ/CC. This applies to all attached pilots (OG/WG/HQ staffs,
   etc.), and all pilots augmenting from other squadrons (operational, FTU, weapons school,
   test, etc.). The objective of this training is to ensure attached/augmenting pilot is proficient
   to conduct all missions in support of expected tasking. The deploying SQ/CC will determine
   the amount of spin-up training required for each attached/augmenting pilot based on the
   pilot's level of proficiency, currency, qualification, experience, etc. For augmenting pilots,
   once the amount of spin-up training is determined, the augmentee's SQ/CC is responsible for
   ensuring the spin-up training is accomplished.
   6.15.2. Ground Training. All applicable pilots will complete ground training as necessary
   prior to their support of contingency operations or exercises.
       6.15.2.1. Academics. Units will brief exercise SPINS, ROE/Training Rules, command
       and control, engagement authority and procedures, and visual identification.
       MAJCOM/IN will assist the unit's intelligence functions in the development of threat
       assessments and visual recognition training materials.
       6.15.2.2. Visual Recognition. Pilots must be able to visually identify aircraft (rotary
       and fixed-wing, including joint/allied assets) they are likely to encounter by name or
       numerical designator and determine whether the aircraft is a threat or non-threat (training
       should incorporate all aspects/angles, theater-specific paint schemes/fin flashes, and
       various configurations), identify ground equipment, and determine major categories of
       naval vessels.
   6.15.3. Flying Training. Tailor spin-up training to ensure all supporting pilots are
   proficient, current, and qualified in all expected mission taskings.

Terms
Air Combat Training (ACBT)—A general term which may include (D)BFM, (D)ACM, and
(D)ACT. Accomplishment of this event requires visual manuevering against an airborne
adversary. Limited/Unlimited TRs (IAW 11-214) are not a litmus test for the accomplishment of
ACBT. The prefix (D) refers to dissimilar assets. When the prefix is missing, similar is assumed
as flown/required. When present in parenthesis, dissimilar is optional. When present without
parenthesis, dissimilar is assumed flown or required. This convention corresponds to all facets
of ACBT (i.e., BFM, ACM, ACT).
Air Combat Tactics (ACT)—Training in the application of offensive and defensive
maneuvering to achieve a tactical air-to-air objective. DCA, OCA, Force Protection and other
A-A centric missions that include element/multi-ship blue tactics are examples of ACT.
Limited/Unlimited TRs (IAW 11-214) are not a litmus test for the accomplishment of ACT.
Basic Mission Capable (BMC)—The status of an pilot who has satisfactorily completed
training (MQT) prescribed to be fully qualified to perform the basic unit operational missions but
does not maintain CMR status. Pilot accomplishes training required to remain familiarized in
all, and may be qualified and proficient in some, of the primary missions of their weapon system
and unit. These pilots may also maintain special capabilities (refer to paragraph 4.3).
Basic Aircraft Qualification (BAQ)—A status of a pilot who has satisfactorily completed
training prescribed to maintain the skills necessary to fly the unit aircraft. The member must
perform at the minimum frequency necessary to meet the most recent sortie and flight standards
set for the weapons system. BAQ will only be carried by pilot until completion of MQT. BAQ is
not a permanent qualification except for General Officers above the wing level, and any other
crew members specifically authorized by MAJCOM/A3. Pilots are not authorized to perform
RAP-tasked missions/events without instructor pilot or SQ supervisor supervision. Flight duties
will be limited to those identified in paragraph 4.3
Certification—The process of certifying pilot tactical employment and special weapons
capabilities, procedures, and rules. Replaces verification for nuclear tasked units.
Circular Error (CE)—Miss distance of a given weapon impact expressed in radial distance
from center of target.
Cockpit Familiarization Trainer (CFT)—A training device in which the controls, switches,
and instruments do not have to respond to trainee inputs. Used for checklist use, normal
procedures, and emergency procedures (see AFP 50-11 (AFPAM 36-2211)).
AFI11-2F-16V1_AETCSUP_I 3 JULY 2013                                                             83


Cockpit Procedures Trainer (CPT)—A training device in which instruments and displays are
activated to respond to trainee inputs. Used for safety of flight, instrument, normal, and
emergency procedures (see AFP 50-11 (AFPAM 36-2211)).
Combat Edge (CE)—A positive-pressure breathing-for-G (PPG) system which provides pilots
additional protection against high positive G accelerations experienced during flight. The system
consists of pilot equipment (high-pressure mask, counter-pressure suit (optional with the CRU-
94 Port Plug installed), G-suit), and aircraft equipment (oxygen regulator, G-valve, and
interfacing sense line). Above 4G regulated air and oxygen are supplied to the system to provide
automatic mask tensioning, vest inflation (n/a with port plug installed), and positive pressure
breathing to the mask.
Combat Mission Ready (CMR)—A status of a pilot who has satisfactorily completed training
(MQT) prescribed to be fully qualified to perform the basic unit operational missions, and
maintains qualification and proficiency in these missions. All active duty API-1/2's, Squadron
Commander, Operations Officers, and OG/CC designated API-6 manning positions are required
to maintain this qualification level. Exception: If a unit is over-manned, they may elect to train
the front line of their UMD to CMR with the overage designated as BMC. Approximately 50%
of the pilots selected for CMR must be inexperienced (refer to paragraph 4.3).
Composite Force Training (CFTR)—Scenarios employing multiple flights of the same or
different types of aircraft, each under the direction of its own flight leader, performing the same
or different roles.
Continuation Training (CT)—-Training to maintain proficiency and improve pilot capabilities
to perform unit missions (does not include formal syllabus or test plan missions). Applicable to
CMR and BMC pilots.
Currency—The minimum frequency required to perform a mission, sortie, or an event safely.
Delivery Parameters—Data reflecting current delivery considerations for general purpose
ordnance as well as tactical survivability. Appropriate aircraft/ weapons Tech Orders must be
consulted for live ordnance safe escape criteria and -1 performance charts for recovery altitudes.
Emergency Procedures Evaluation (EPE)—An evaluation of pilot knowledge and
responsiveness to critical and non-critical EPs conducted by an FE in an OFT, CPT, CFT, MTT,
UTD, or aircraft cockpit.
Experienced Aircrew (EXP)—See paragraph 1.5.5
Flight Lead (FL)—As designated on flight orders, the individual responsible for overall conduct
of mission from preflight preparation/briefing to postflight debriefing, regardless of actual
position within the formation. A certified 4-ship FL may lead formations and missions in excess
of four aircraft, unless restricted by the unit CC. A 2-ship FL is authorized to lead an element in
a larger formation.
Full Mission Trainer (FMT)—A training device which dynamically simulates flight
characteristics. Used for normal, emergency, and instrument procedures, to include safety of
flight, warfighting tasks, and skill integration training (see AFP 50-11 (AFPAM 36-2211)).
Full Scale Weapons Delivery (FSWD)—Delivery of live or inert ordnance representing a
typical combat configuration/SCL of Unguided Munitions in a tactical scenario.

targeting system that provides tactical aircraft with a low-altitude, under-the-weather, day and
night operational capability.
Low Altitude Training (LOWAT)—Operations in a certified low altitude block as defined in
Table 6.1. Currency associated with and updated by either LOW A/A or LOW A/G.
Low Altitude Tactical Formation (LATF)—Flying tactical formation while conducting LATN
training.
Low Altitude Tactical Navigation (LATN)—Training conducted below 1,000 feet AGL using
onboard systems and the fundamental aspects of dead reckoning and point-to-point low altitude
navigation, with or without prior route planning.
Low Altitude Intercept (LAI)—An intercept conducted below 5,000 feet AGL.
Medium Altitude Tactics—Day or night (if appropriate for night mission profiles) tactical
formation above 5,000 feet AGL, ingressing to a target area, employing actual or simulated
ordnance, and egressing with mutual support.
Mission Qualification Training (MQT)—Training required to achieve a basic level of
competence in unit's primary tasked missions. This training is a prerequisite for CMR or BMC
status.
Mission Training Center (MTC)—An installation of high-fidelity networked simulators
providing 360-degree visual capabilities coupled with realistic brief and debriefing tools. The
facility will have the capability to network local simulator cockpits together, and the potential for
long-distance networked operations, providing realistic multi-aircraft virtual training.
Night Sortie—Sortie on which either takeoff or landing and at least 50 percent of flight duration
or 1 hour, whichever is less, occur between the end of evening civil twilight and the beginning of
morning civil twilight, as published in the American Air Almanac, coverted to local time. Once
trained and equipped, all night sorties should include the use of NVGs. All NVG aided missions
should include covert/lights out training.
Primary Aircraft Inventory (PAI)—Aircraft authorized for performance of the operational

   lead, passing attack (9-line) information and performing Type 1, 2, or 3 control duties. Two
   controls are required to update an ASC event. The controls do not have to occur on the same
   mission. A control consists of at least one aircraft attacking a surface target. The control
   begins with a CAS briefing from a FAC(A) and ends with either an actual/simulated weapons
   release or an abort on a final attack run. No more than two controls can be counted per CAS
   briefing per target. Air strike control (ASC) events only apply to FAC(A) qualified pilots
   and are IAW JCAS FAC(A) MOA (dated 24 Mar 05). Track each ASC performed by type as
   applicable (see definition below) for JCAS FAC(A) MOA documentation requirements.
   Only applies to FAC(A) qualified pilots when performed as the FAC(A) element lead.

  should include the use of NVGs. All NVG aided missions should include covert/lights out
  training.
  A2.1.14. Collateral Sortie. Sortie not directly related to combat employment or basic skills
  training but necessary for accomplishment of unit training programs, such as ferry flights,
  deployments, incentive flights, hurrevac, airshows, etc. MAJCOMs will normally assign
  collateral sorties in lump sum (nominally 200 per fighter unit) adjusted for local conditions
  and circumstances (see paragraph 1.7.2). Tactical events accomplished on collateral sorties
  may be logged and used to update currencies but may not be logged as RAP missions or
  count towards RAP lookback requirements.
  A2.1.15. Commander Option/AEF Prep Mission. Mission allocated at the beginning of
  each training cycle by the unit commander based on DOC requirements or AEF
  commitments. Allocate for CMR pilots to meet individual training requirements and unit

  opposed by air and surface threats and should include at least 8 blue aircraft. Only one event
  may be logged per mission.
  A2.1.17. Contingency Sortie. A sortie tasked and flown while deployed for a contingency
  operation. These sorties are logged as Contingency Operations Sortie (SC13) in ARMS.
  These sorties and events accomplished on these sorties do not count towards training cycle
  RAP requirements, however, the sorties may be used for lookback and the events may be
  used to update currencies.
  A2.1.18. Defensive Counter Air (Night) [DCA (N)] Mission. Mission designed to develop
  proficiency in Defensive Counter Air (DCA) mission tactics. Mission elements include: Intel
  scenario and mission planning, execution of tactics to detect, engage, and negate aircraft
  employing adversary tactics and weapons capabilities to penetrate protected airspace or
  attack a specific target area, and in-flight report. Additional night missions may be applied to

  currency are: BFM (N/A for AGRS SQ), ACM, ACT, LOW A-A or A-G (below 1,000 feet
  AGL), CAS < 5000’ AGL (including weapons delivery and recovery), Opposed SAT, CFTR,
  night missions, instructor duties, aerial demonstrations, etc. SQ/CCs may add
  missions/events to the demanding sortie list, depending on unit tasking and the individual's
  capabilities. Also see Non-demanding Sortie.
  A2.1.20. Destruction of Enemy Air Defenses (DEAD) Mission. Mission designed to
  develop proficiency in Destruction of Enemy Air Defense tactics. Mission elements include:
  Intel scenario and integrated mission planning to support force package objectives, execution
  of tactics to detect and destroy (utilizing conventional, IAM, or LGB munitions) enemy
  IADS, to include SAM, AAA systems, and critical IADS nodes, employing adversary tactics
  and weapons capabilities to disrupt force package employment/destroy package assets, and
  in-flight report. Destructive suppression effects are cumulative, resulting in reduced attrition
  of friendly aircraft. Destructive operations should be integrated and used with disruptive
  operations. TGP employment (dual-carriage when capable) is highly desired.
  A2.1.21. DT A/A Event. Complete an air-to-air intercept/engagement against a target
  relayed/passed by an appropriate command and control (C2) asset. Track information should
  be a datalinked (J 3.2 track) if possible, otherwise via normal radio communications (C2

  logged per mission.
  A2.1.22. DT A/G Event. Complete an air-to-ground attack/engagement against a
  target/TST relayed/passed by an appropriate command and control (C2) asset. Track
  information should be a datalinked (J 3.5 track) if possible, otherwise via normal radio
  communications (C2 asset and relay/passing of track information can be simulated).
  Targeting within a CAS scenario does not meet the intent of this event. Only two events may
  be logged per mission.

  and weapons engagement zones, consider environmental factors, attain turning room and
  energy at end game, practice ID/ROE procedures, and terminate when briefed objectives or
  training rule stops are reached. These intercepts will not update ACBT currency. Two
  events may be logged per mission, but not on the same engagement. Units assigned the
  ASA/ONE mission will accomplish low/slow VID intercepts with TGP/ATP to assist in VID,
  shadow, and weapons employment.
  A2.1.37. Moving Target LGB Attack Event. Self or buddy-lase LGB attack against a
  target in motion. Until AFTTP 3.1 hit criteria is available, units will develop simulated

  aircraft versus a minimum of two pre-planned adversary aircraft. May be logged in
  conjunction with baseline training requirements.
  A2.1.40. Non-demanding Sortie. A day sortie that provides the pilot with the opportunity
  to regain basic flying proficiency without excessively tasking those skills that have been
  under used during the non-flying period. Authorized events flown on a nondemanding sortie
  are: Instruments, AHC, low level navigation at or above 1000 feet AGL, unopposed basic
  weapons delivery, CAS > 5000’ AGL (including weapons delivery and recovery) and
  intercepts executed under limited-maneuvering training rules, BFM (AGRS only). SQ/CCs
  may delete sorties/events from this non-demanding sortie list, depending on unit tasking and
  the individual's capabilities.
  A2.1.41. Non-effective Sortie. A sortie planned and launched as a training mission, test
  mission, basic skills sortie, or collateral sortie that, due to some circumstance (weather, IFE,
  maintenance, etc.), fails to accomplish a sufficient number of planned events. While
  maintenance statistics support historical data for sorties that are cancelled before takeoff, a
  non-effective sortie or “air abort” is not usually captured by maintenance for future flying
  hour programming. These sorties must be accounted for in building unit flying hour
  programs.
  A2.1.42. NVG LOW ALT Event (ANG: N/A)- Event is defined as performing realistic,
  mission oriented low altitude NVG operations below the MSA during high-illumination.
  Events include low altitude navigation, tactical formation, defensive maneuvering to avoid or

  Mission elements include: Intel scenario and tactical mission planning, execution of striker
  escort and sweep tactics designed to detect, engage, and negate simulated adversary aircraft
  which are operating within specific commit criteria (i.e., range, airspace corridor, vul time,
  etc.), and in-flight report.
  A2.1.44. Red Air Mission. A/A mission where tactics, aircraft simulation, weapon systems,
  and/or maneuvering is limited to the extent that complete own MDS training is not
  accomplished. Restrictions which limit aircraft capabilities to some level which might be
  encountered in combat do not require logging the mission as Red Air. For CMR pilots, Red
  Air mission allocations in the RTM are a maximum cap on degraded training. Red air
  missions flown above max allocation do not count toward RAP mission
  requirements/lookback. However, CMR pilots may accomplish individual events (e.g.
  formation landing, AAR, etc.) and update applicable currencies. Unused Red Air allocations
  should be flown in one of the other A/A training mission categories.
  A2.1.45. SEAD Mission. Mission designed to develop proficiency in Suppression of
  Enemy Air Defense tactics. Mission elements include: Intel scenario and integrated mission
  planning to support force package objectives, execution of tactics to detect and negate enemy

  weapons delivery attempt results in: munitions impact outside the range scoring capability; a
  chargeable dry pass; a foul; an unintentional release; or exceeding tactical delivery time on
  final requirements.
  A2.2.5. Hit. Any munitions impact within the weapons criteria established for that event.
  A2.2.6. Inadvertent Release. Ordnance which has released without command by the pilot
  or by a verified system malfunction.. Impact will not be scored.
  A2.2.7. Multiple Release. More than one weapon released against the same target on a
  single pass.
  A2.2.8. No Spot. A weapons release during which no impact was observed. No score or
  error will be assigned.
  A2.2.9. Qualification QUAL. See Chapter 5.
  A2.2.10. Tactical Delivery. A delivery using patterns and techniques that minimize final
  flight path predictability, yet allow sufficient time for accurate weapons delivery. Wings
  level time on final will be limited to 5 seconds or less when aircraft will descend below 4,500
  feet AGL. Timing is from completion of roll-out (as defined in Wing standards or AFTTP),
  until initiation of recovery. Exceeding 5 seconds results in a gross error. Level, IAM, LGB,
  MAV, and climbing deliveries may exceed 5 seconds. All tactical deliveries will normally
  include recovery to egress parameters.
  A2.2.11. Unintentional Release. Ordnance released due to pilot error. Scored as gross error
  regardless of impact point.
