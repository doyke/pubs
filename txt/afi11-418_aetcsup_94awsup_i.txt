1. General. The basic supervision structure for flying operations consists of the Operations
Group Commander (OG/CC), the Supervisor of Flying (SOF) and the squadron supervisors, i.e.,
Operations Supervisor (Ops Sup) and Stand-by Duty Officer (SDO). The chain of supervision
begins with the OG/CC, through the SOF, down to the individual squadron supervisors. Specific
duties and responsibilities of each are defined later in this instruction. Paragraph 3. specifies the
requirements for each position.
NOTE: For the purpose of this instruction “experienced” (aircrew) is used in accordance with
(IAW) the definition specified in the Mission Design Series (MDS) specific AFI 11-2 MDS
Volume 1. Aircrews are also considered “experienced” when previously rated “experienced” in
another MDS or previously rated “experienced” in a different crew position in the same MDS,
are selected by the Squadron CC and approved by the OG/CC. Where no definition is provided,
“experienced” will be determined by the unit squadron commander and approved by OG/CC.
1. (AETC) General. For the 479th and 306th Flying Training Groups (FTG), operations group
commander (OG/CC) and wing commander (WG/CC) refer to the FTG/CC. For the 336th
Training Group (TRG), OG/CC and WG/CC refer to the TRG/CC.

2.   Operations Supervision Functions:
     2.1.        Supervisor of Flying. When on duty, the SOF is a group-level position and is the
     direct representative of the OG/CC. The SOF is the focal point for command and control of
     flight operations. Decision authority is delegated to this position to accomplish the mission.
        1.       SOF is not required for rescue/weather/electronic attack/airlift/air refueling/RC-
             26 operations/special operations/deployed U-2 Ops.
        2.       ANG/AFRC may combine SOF and Ops Sup duties.
        3.       DELETED.
     2.1. (AETC) The OG/CC, 97 OG/CC, 314 OG/CC, and 336 TRG/CC will determine if a
     wing supervisor of flying (SOF) is required. In these units, if a SOF is not used, either the
     operations supervisor (Ops Sup) or a duty officer will be on duty in the squadron to handle
     squadron-unique issues.
     2.1. (94AW) 94 OG will not utilize a Supervisor of Flying (SOF); an Operations Supervisor
     (Op Sup) will be used for command and control.
     2.2. Operations Supervisor. The squadron Ops Sup must be filled by the squadron
     operations officer, assistant operations officer, flight commanders, or other individuals
     deemed qualified by the squadron commander and approved by the OG/CC.
     ANG/AFRC: OG/CC or Air Operations Officer (AOO) will determine requirements for Ops
     Sup and will determine the appropriate personnel to fill the Ops Sup position.
     2.2. (AETC)      The Ops Sup is the focal point for decisions affecting squadron flying
     operations and will ensure flying operations comply with applicable directives. The OG/CC
     will establish a training program for those selected for Ops Sup duties. Once training is
     complete, the OG/CC must certify the individual, in writing, before the individual may
     perform Ops Sup duties. On a case-by-case basis and with the OG/CC’s approval, an
     individual who has not been trained or certified as an Ops Sup may perform Ops Sup duties.
     This will allow short-term coverage until a trained and certified Ops Sup can assume these
     duties.
        2.2.1.   Squadron commanders can always fill the Ops Sup position, if available.
        2.2.2. During local flying operations, an Ops Sup will always be immediately available
        to the OG/CC, the SOF, command and control (C2) personnel or other supporting
        agencies to respond to any current operations issues requiring time-sensitive answers,
        decisions and actions.
        2.2.2. (AETC) The Ops Sup will be at the primary duty location to the maximum
        extent possible and, as a minimum, available as outlined in Table 1., Note 5 (as
        supplemented), while on duty. (Exception: The 98 FTS Ops Sup may provide
        supervision from outside the primary duty location for UV-18 sorties that do not conduct
        operations at the USAF Academy.)
        2.2.3. For Tanker Airlift Control Center (TACC) tasked missions, AFRC units require
        an Ops Sup for home station departure and arrival.
     2.3. Stand-by Duty Officer (SDO). The SDO is an experienced squadron member,
     designated by the squadron operations officer, who has the authority to make operations-
6                                     AFI11-418_AETCSUP_94AWSUP_I 7 DECEMBER 2009


    related decisions and recommendations. The SDO is necessary when the squadron has on-
    going off-station operations. These operations include sorties that do not otherwise qualify as
    deployed sorties. When on duty, the SDO will be available to the OG/CC, the SOF, C2
    personnel and other supporting agencies to respond to squadron operations issues. For
    operations where the SOF is not qualified to provide technical assistance to the type of
    aircraft airborne and an Ops Sup is not readily available, the SDO will assist the SOF as
    required.
3. Supervision of Flying Operations. All levels of flight operations may not require each
supervisory position to be manned. With the exception of scramble (Active Duty), some type of
squadron-level supervisor is always required (Ops Sup/SDO), but other factors enter into the
decision if the group-level SOF position should be manned. Table 1 outlines the minimum
supervision requirements.
3. (AETC) Supervision of Flying Operations. The Ops Sup and SOF may be combined when
the number of aircraft involved is very small (less than 5) and flights occur over a short duration.
When duties are combined, SOF duty hour limitations apply. Actual search-and-rescue
operations require the Ops Sup location to be the squadron. Note: For Table 1., consider T-1, T-
6, T-37, and T-38 aircraft as fighter aircraft.

2. Duty location as directed by paragraph 10. and unit supplement.
3. The designated supervisor will be in the unit operations complex and can be immediately contacted
   or summoned by telephone, pager, radio or intercom.
4. For deployed operations, the detachment commander will coordinate with host base Operations
   Group for supervision requirements. This may involve integrating into the host base SOF and/or
   Ops Sup program.
5. The designated supervisor can be immediately reached by telephone, pager or radio.
6. The designated supervisor will be in the unit operations complex until 45 minutes after departure
   and 45 minutes prior to arrival and can be immediately contacted or summoned by telephone,
   pager, radio, or intercom.
7. For cross-country departures, Note 3 applies. For cross-country recoveries, Note 5 applies.
8. ANG/AFRC may combine SOF and Ops Sup duties.

9. Applies to AFRC units only.
10. For TACC missions, the designated supervisor will be available until 45 minutes after departure
and 45 minutes prior to arrival.

Table 1. (AETC) Minimum Flying Unit Supervision Requirements.

NOTE 3. For trainer operations, the Ops Sup must be at the duty desk to the maximum extent possible
while on duty to accomplish responsibilities listed in paragraphs 4.3. through 4.3.9.1. of the basic
instruction and paragraphs 4.3.1. and 4.3.10. (Added) through 4.3.18. (Added) of this supplement.

NOTE 5. For airlift or tanker operations, the Ops Sup will remain at the primary duty location until the
crew for the last launch of the day leaves the squadron for their mission. As long as there are no
outstanding issues, the Ops Sup may then notify the wing SOF and depart the duty location, but must
remain on telephone recall. Profile changes made after the step brief, but before takeoff, will be
coordinated with the Ops Sup by telephone. The SOF will remain on duty as long as aircraft are
airborne and will ensure any Ops Sup released is recalled as necessary. Ops Sups released to telephone
recall may begin crew rest for the next day’s flying activities (flying, SOF duty, etc.). However, any
official interruptions, including telephone calls, will trigger crew rest interruption safeguards for the
next day’s flying activities (AFI 11-202, Volume 3, General Flight Rules).

Table 1. (94AW) Minimum Flying Unit Supervision Requirements.
Note 5. The Ops Sup will remain at the primary duty location as long as aircraft are airborne for
local training sorties. For weekend cross country departures and returns the SQ/DO, OG/CD or
OG/CC will act as Ops Sup.

    3.1. Types of Operations. Classifying types and levels of flight activity is the basis for
    designating minimum supervision requirements. The definitions for types of operations that
    are used in Table 1 are:
       3.1.1. Daily Flying Operations. Normal or surge operations at the unit's home station
       (this does not include other types of operations defined below).
       3.1.2. Reduced Flying Operations. Operations, scheduled or unscheduled, that occur
       when majority of the unit is not flying. Under these conditions, OG/CC may direct that
       the group-level SOF position is not required.
       3.1.3. On-Going Off Station Sorties. Missions/sorties that do not takeoff or land at
       home station.
       3.1.4. Out of Local Area Operations. Missions that take off and land at home base but
       operate outside the local area for extended periods of time. These missions usually have
       primary emergency landing fields other than home base.
       3.1.5. Deployment/Re-deployment. The departure from home station to another
       location or return to home station from another location.
       3.1.6. Deployed Operations. Flight operations away from home station that are part of a
       deployment, exercise or contingency.
AFI11-418_AETCSUP_94AWSUP_I 7 DECEMBER 2009                                                 9


      3.1.6. (AETC) Deployed operations are defined as five or more aircraft away from
      home station with the intent to accomplish multiple, syllabus-directed sorties from the
      same location.
      3.1.7. Cross Country Departures/Returns. Aircraft departing from or returning to home
      station for other than a deployment, exercise or contingency.
      3.1.8. Functional Check Flight. Aircraft launched to ensure it is airworthy and capable
      of accomplishing its mission.
      3.1.9.   Scrambles. Aircraft launched on a scramble order from an alert posture.
      3.1.10. TACC Missions. Missions flown with OPCON by the Tanker Airlift Control
      Center (TACC).
   3.2.      Minimum Supervision Requirements. These are outlined in Table 1 for each type
   of operation. The OG/CC may impose additional requirements depending on local
   circumstances.
4. Responsibilities of Supervisors: NOTE: For the purposes of this instruction, the term
“operations group commander” also refers to the designated representative.
   4.1. OG/CC (ANG/AFRC: OG/CC or AOO) will:
      4.1.1. Be responsible for the implementation, direction and execution of the Operations
      Supervision program.
      4.1.2. Be immediately available to the SOF or Ops Sup for consultation during daily
      flying operations.
      4.1.3. Ensure tenant flying units use host/tenant memorandum of agreement
      (MOA)/letter of agreement (LOA) to avoid duplication of effort, where appropriate.
      4.1.4.   Be the final approval authority for unit supplement to this instruction.
      4.1.5. (Added-AETC) Appoint, in writing, a SOF program manager at the OGV level.
      Maintain the appointment memorandum in the program manager’s training folder. Note:
      The OGV SOF program manager will be a current SOF.
      4.1.6. (Added-AETC) Review the qualifications of all candidates before they enter into
      the SOF program.
      4.1.7. (Added-AETC) Certify the minimum number of SOFs necessary to safely
      accomplish the mission. Certification will include a face-to-face interview. Accomplish
      and document certification before the candidate performs SOF duty. (The SOF program
      manager will maintain the nomination and certification memorandum in the candidate’s
      training folder.)
      4.1.8. (Added-AETC) (Airlift, tanker, special operations, and rescue units only) For
      units that have elected not to have a SOF, include guidance in unit supplements on which
      SOF functions in the basic instruction and this supplement need to be performed by other
      agencies or duty positions.
      4.1.9. (Added-AETC) Ensure adequate means are employed to counter the adverse
      effects of temperature extremes on crewmembers for airlift, tanker, special operations,
      and rescue aircraft that require extended ground preparation.
10                                  AFI11-418_AETCSUP_94AWSUP_I 7 DECEMBER 2009


        4.1.10. (Added-94AW) In addition to 94 AW/CC and 94 OG/CC, the 700 AS/CC or
        DO can cancel flying operations. When unable to contact the above commanders, the
        Ops Sup can cancel flying for weather, operational or immediate safety concerns.
        Immediately upon any flight cancellation the Ops Sup will notify the 94 OG/CC and log
        the cancellation and reasons in the Ops Sup log.
     4.2. SOF will:
        4.2.1.   Be on duty when required by Table 1 or when directed by the OG/CC.
        4.2.2. Be responsible to the OG/CC for monitoring and supervising all phases of unit
        flying operations and will provide guidance, advice, assistance and recommendations to
        aircrews, supervisors, command and control personnel and support agencies regarding the
        safe and efficient conduct of flight operations.
            4.2.2.1. While aircraft commanders are ultimately responsible for the safe operation
            of their aircraft, the SOF will ensure that in-flight emergency (IFE) recovery plans
            and weather related mission changes reflect sound airmanship, follow AFI and
            technical order guidance, and “pass the common sense check.”
        4.2.3. Remember that safety is the first priority. If safety is an issue, the SOF has the
        authority to direct appropriate actions, on behalf of the OG/CC, to correct/prevent unsafe
        situations. This includes the use of any and all resources to include radios, FM nets,
        telephone hot lines and all wing-flying operations on the ground or in the air.
        4.2.4. Prior to the first launch, ensure the airfield status is suitable for safe operations
        IAW Air Force, major command (MAJCOM) and local directives.
        4.2.4. (AETC)      For specialized undergraduate pilot training (SUPT), joint primary
        pilot training (JPPT), Euro-NATO joint jet pilot training (ENJJPT), and pilot instructor
        training (PIT), establish a home and auxiliary field status (to include an alternate if
        required), 1 hour before the first scheduled launch.
        4.2.5. During an emergency or an abnormal situation, provide aircrews with guidance,
        timely advice and assistance to determine a correct course of action to safely recover the
        aircraft.
        4.2.5. (AETC) When required, designate an aircraft to fly chase. Refer to the checklist
        at Attachment 2 of the basic instruction for additional information.
        4.2.6. Be in a position to visually monitor the final approach and landing of IFE
        aircraft. If unable, the SOF will direct another highly qualified aircrew member to be in
        position to monitor the landing and provide needed assistance or guidance. (ANG/AFRC:
        Not required.)
        4.2.6. (AETC)      (Note: The 58 SOW is exempt from this requirement.)
        4.2.7. Closely monitor the status of primary and emergency airfields and inform
        aircrews of changes that may affect flight operations.
        4.2.7. (AETC)         Also, closely monitor the status of the runways and navigational
        facilities serving the home field, auxiliary fields, ranges, drop zones, etc. Designate
        alternate airfields if required. Notify local aircraft through the tower watch supervisor, air
        route traffic control center (ARTCC), or guard frequency (if necessary) of any status
AFI11-418_AETCSUP_94AWSUP_I 7 DECEMBER 2009                                                    11


     changes that may affect recovery fuel. Ensure the automatic terminal information service
     (ATIS) reflects all relevant local flying information.
     4.2.8. When deteriorating weather conditions affect flying operations, coordinate with
     wing agencies and utilize all available resources (i.e., weather, radar, tower personnel,
     pilot reports, etc.) to determine the best course of action for wing aircraft. This course of
     action could extend to departures and recoveries as well as diverts or SOF directed
     holding. The SOF will determine suitable weather alternates, assign them accordingly
     and monitor them. When necessary to ensure safe flight operations, the SOF will
     coordinate with the air traffic control (ATC) watch supervisor or senior controller for
     runway changes.
     4.2.9. Prepare a daily log tracking major events, with format and content as defined by
     unit supplement. The SOF will debrief the OG/CC and the applicable squadron
     commander of any aircraft involved in an unusual situation, IFE, weather divert or other
     mission change requiring SOF action or intervention.
     4.2.10. (Added-AETC) Complete the opening, changeover, and closing SOF
     checklists. As a minimum, opening SOFs will:
        4.2.10.1. (Added-AETC) Complete squadron go/no-go checklist items before
        reporting to the tower.
        4.2.10.2. (Added-AETC) Review and initial quarterly meeting minutes before
        reporting to the tower.
        4.2.10.3. (Added-AETC) Adequately evaluate current and forecast weather
        conditions, to include current observations, forecasts, watches, warnings, advisories,
        and significant changes expected.
        4.2.10.4. (Added-AETC) Verify status of home field runways, navigational
        facilities, and bird conditions.
        4.2.10.5.   (Added-AETC) Review notices to airmen (NOTAM).
        4.2.10.6. (Added-AETC) Check communications to confirm the operability of hot
        lines, radios, etc.
        4.2.10.7. (Added-AETC) Comply with local reporting requirements regarding
        emergency aircraft.
     4.2.11. (Added-AETC) Contact squadron Ops Sups and clarify any special
     requirements (initial solo, solo and team out-and-back, flight evaluations, air refueling,
     airdrops, etc.).
     4.2.12. (Added-AETC) Advise aircrews of extreme environmental temperatures and
     ensure flying activities comply with procedures governing operations under extreme heat
     and cold according to Attachment 5 (Added) and Attachment 6 (Added), respectively.
     4.2.13.   (Added-AETC) Take action to locate any overdue aircraft.
     4.2.14. (Added-AETC) Brief the replacement SOF on the current situation. Do not
     change SOFs when an emergency is in progress.
  4.3. Ops Sup will:

     required in the performance of the duties listed below.
     4.3.1. (AETC) Be at the primary duty location to the maximum extent possible and, as
     a minimum, available as outlined in Table 1 (as supplemented), while on duty.
     4.3.2. Be immediately available to assist the SOF or aircrew (for units which do not
     require a SOF).
     4.3.3. When the SOF is not qualified in the distressed aircraft or the unit does not
     require a SOF, be the primary source of technical assistance.
     4.3.4. For situations where the SOF and Ops Sup are not qualified to provide technical
     assistance to the type of aircraft airborne, schedule an instructor or experienced
     crewmember to be immediately available for aircraft technical assistance.
     4.3.5. Ensure the SOF is advised of any changes or deviations to the squadron's flying
     schedule.
     4.3.6. Be responsible for the execution of the daily flying schedule and coordinate any
     mission changes as required. Ensure that the actual mission flown is accurately annotated
     on the flying schedule.
     4.3.6. (94AW) Ensure Command Post, Aerial Delivery, Drop Zone Controller (DZC),

     schedule. Electronic changes will be made by the schedulers or Current Operations
     (A3OO).
        4.3.9.1. Prepare, at squadron commander’s discretion, a daily operations log to aid
        in tracking daily operations. For missions where a SOF is not required, this log will
        be prepared by Ops Sup or SDO. Log format and content will be defined by unit
        supplement.
        4.3.9.1. (94AW) The Ops Sup log will contain the following information: Ops Sup
        name, date, signature, latest read file date, and information on aircraft issues, crew

       aircrews when WBGT index is heat category 4 or above.
       4.3.14. (Added-AETC) Ensure the SOF is familiar with any special requirements for
       that day (for example, initial solo, solo and team out-and-back, air refueling, airdrops).
       4.3.15. (Added-AETC) Notify the runway supervisory unit (RSU) of special flying
       requirements (for example, initial solos, students in the Commander’s Awareness
       Program, solo and team out-and-back, and flight evaluations).
       4.3.16.   (Added-AETC) Monitor the SOF’s radio frequency.
       4.3.17. (Added-AETC) Before aircrews “step” to the aircraft, brief them and verify
       they have accomplished all required currency items. In addition, ensure the currency of
       crews scheduled to perform currency-based ground duties (RSU, SOF, etc.). Units will
       prescribe the content of these step briefings in their unit supplement. Due to the remote
       location of UV-18 aircraft from the squadron, the 98 FTS Ops Sup may conduct the
       briefing via telephone.
       4.3.17. (94AW) The step brief is accomplished by the Ops Sup when the aircraft
       mission folder is picked up at bus time. The briefing ensures Flight Authorizations are
       properly signed off, Operational Risk Management (ORM) is properly annotated, flight
       plans have been copied/filed and NOTAMs are in the notebook along with any mission
       related updates.

        4.6.2.   (Added-AETC) Perform duties assigned by the SOF program manager.
5.   Responsibilities of Other Key Unit Personnel:
     5.1. Wing/unit commanders are responsible for an effective Operations Supervision
     program for all assigned and attached units and ensure other group commanders support the
     OG/CC when and where needed in order to execute an effective program.
     5.2. Mission Support group commanders are responsible for the maintenance, upgrade and
     repair of the applicable SOF facilities and equipment.
     5.3. Mission Support group/Logistic Readiness group commanders are responsible for
     maintenance, upgrade and repair of the SOF vehicle.
     5.4. Squadron commanders ensure a SOF/Ops Sup/SDO is on duty when required by Table
     1
     5.5. Command post is responsible for tracking all wing flying activities, both on and off
     station. It functions as the central source for information during an emergency. ANG/AFRC:
     Single squadron units and units with minimal command post full-time manning may establish
     procedures for unit SOF, Ops Sup, and duty desk personnel to track flying activities and be
     the central source for information during an emergency.
     5.5. (94AW) When command post is not tracking wing flying activities, the Ops Sup and
     duty desk personnel will track flying activities and be the central source of information
     during an emergency.
     5.6. (Added-AETC) As required by AETCI 11-204, Runway Supervisory Unit (RSU)
     Operations, the RSU controller (SUPT only) and crew will closely supervise solo student
     operations and ensure safe and efficient traffic pattern operations. RSU controllers will
     provide senior supervisors with an additional quality check of traffic patterns and landings
16                                  AFI11-418_AETCSUP_94AWSUP_I 7 DECEMBER 2009


     and work directly with the SOF to safely resolve emergency situations. Refer to AETCI 11-
     204, Table 2.1, for guidance on T-38 supervised solo out-and-backs.
     5.7. (Added-AETC) During flying operations, the squadron duty desk is the focal point for
     information and scheduling execution. Operations resource management specialists (or other
     knowledgeable personnel) certified in duty desk procedures by the squadron operations
     officer will occupy the desk as specified in the local supplement. See Attachment 7 (Added)
     for a list of SOF telephone numbers for AETC bases and Attachment 8 (Added) for a list of
     typical squadron duty desk equipment.
     5.7. (94AW) The Ops Sup, who is certified by 94 OG/CC, will occupy the squadron duty
     desk and perform the functions as supplemented by AETC.
     5.8. (Added-AETC) The flight commander is the first echelon of command responsible for
     safely and efficiently scheduling people, missions, and aircraft. He or she must know the
     capabilities and experience levels of all flight members and ensure they fly the right mission
     at the right time according to the current syllabus and applicable directives. Safety must
     remain paramount in the flight commander’s mind, and he or she must keep the Ops Sup
     informed of the training plan and any changes.
     5.9. (Added-AETC) (NA AFRC stand-alone) Each wing will develop and manage a flight
     commander’s training course as outlined in AETCI 36-2226, Wing Level Flight Commander
     Training Program. The OG/CC should tailor the program to meet individual unit
     requirements.
6.   Handling of In-Flight Emergencies:
     6.1. The primary objective during an abnormal/emergency situation is the safe recovery of
     the aircrew and aircraft. When establishing procedures, units will consider:
        6.1.1. Providing a single, discrete frequency for recovering an emergency aircraft. ATC
        and the emergency aircrew should determine when to use a single frequency approach
        (SFA). The SOF will have access to the SFA. The SFA should be available to
        crash/fire/rescue personnel to monitor the recovery.
        6.1.1. (AETC) In-flight emergency (IFE) aircrews recovering to an RSU-controlled
        runway will switch to the RSU frequency according to local procedures.
        6.1.2. Using the command post, or other capable agency, to notify all appropriate
        agencies and key personnel of an IFE and provide situation updates, allowing the SOF or
        Ops Sup to devote full attention to the emergency.
        6.1.2. (AETC) At the first opportunity, units will notify the OG/CC of the situation
        and the radio frequency to be used in the aircraft recovery.
        6.1.3.   Prioritizing actions during concurrent emergencies/abnormal situations.
        6.1.4. Authorizing direct communications (over discrete SOF or squadron common
        frequency) from the Ops Sup/SDO to an IFE aircrew. Only ATC personnel may authorize
        direct communication over ATC frequencies, including the SFA frequency. However,
        this does not preclude the SOF from using whatever communication necessary, to include
        GUARD and SFA, to prevent an unsafe situation that could immediately jeopardize safe
        recovery.
AFI11-418_AETCSUP_94AWSUP_I 7 DECEMBER 2009                                                        17


        6.1.4. (94AW) Emergency aircraft use the Command Post frequency as the primary
        means to communicate with Command Post, maintenance and the Ops Sup. The Ops Sup
        will monitor Command Post frequency and serve as a focal point for assets and
        information for the flying squadron. In addition, Ops Sup will monitor the situation,
        record activity in the events log, and provide additional assistance as necessary. Direct
        Aircraft Commanders to complete applicable forms (AMC Form 97, AMC In-Flight
        Emergency and Unusual Occurrence Worksheet, AF Form 853, Air Force Wildlife Strike
        Report, etc) as part of their post-flight duties.
        6.1.5. That only the on-scene commander, normally the fire chief, can terminate an
        emergency.
        6.1.6. That the final decision during any IFE/abnormal situation rests with the aircraft
        commander. However, SOFs may declare an IFE for any aircraft based on their
        knowledge of the aircraft and the flight and airfield environment.
        6.1.7.   Obtaining a chase ship for single ship emergency aircraft if time permits.
        6.1.8. Directing the Ops Sup or other highly qualified individual to report to the SOF's
        duty location during an abnormal situation/recovery if time permits.
7.   CONFERENCE HOTEL Aircraft Specific Procedures: NOTE:                     DELETED.
     7.1. These procedures make aircraft specialists accessible to the SOF or Ops Sup and
     aircrew when in-flight situations pose systems-related questions that cannot be answered at
     the local level. See Attachment 4 for specific MDS procedures.
     7.2. Table A4.1 shows the different MDSs and the MDS-specific reference paragraphs.
     7.3. (Added-94AW) The Command Post will be the primary point of contact for
     CONFERENCE HOTEL procedures. The Ops Sup will be the secondary point of contact. If
     the Command Post is unavailable, the Ops Sup will run the appropriate checklist. The Ops
     Sup will contact all assets needed to aid in the in-flight situation and act as a focal point for
     assets and information.
8.   SOF/ATC Relationship:
     8.1. The relationship between supervisors and ATC must be based on professionalism, trust
     and teamwork. SOFs represent the OG/CC for the conduct of safe flight operations and
     mission accomplishment.
     8.2. The separation and sequencing of traffic are the responsibilities of the watch
     supervisors and controllers. Unless safety is an issue, the SOF will work directly with the
     watch supervisor. To promote effective and efficient flight operations, the SOF may suggest,
     based on knowledge of the flying schedule and unique circumstances of individual missions,
     actions that affect ATC concerns or desires.
     8.3. Except in an emergency, the SOF will not transmit over ATC frequencies without prior
     coordination with ATC (this does not apply to dedicated SOF frequencies). All radio
     transmissions to a distressed aircrew, from other than the SOF or ATC, will be coordinated
     through the SOF.
9.   Duty Hours:
18                                    AFI11-418_AETCSUP_94AWSUP_I 7 DECEMBER 2009


      9.1. Prior to beginning supervisory duties, the SOF will meet crew rest requirements as
      directed by AFI 11-202V3, General Flight Rules, as supplemented. For AFRC units, 12

      paragraph 4.2 and will be in the primary or alternate duty location 30 minutes prior to first
      scheduled takeoff and remain on duty until the last aircraft is shut down.
      9.4.        (AFRC/ANG) If Ops Sup and SOF duties are combined, SOF duty hour
      limitations apply.
      9.4. (94AW) The Ops Sup will be on duty from 15 minutes prior to aircraft release until the
      last aircrew has completed its mission. The Ops Sup will be at the duty location one hour
      prior to first takeoff. The squadron may use other personnel familiar with flight operations to
      man the duty desk during short periods when the Ops Sup is not at the duty desk.
10.    SOF Duty Location:
      10.1. The OG/CC will designate primary and alternate SOF duty locations. As a minimum,
      the location must have adequate communication equipment and the capability to monitor
      weather conditions. It is desirable to have a SOF duty position from which ground
      operations, takeoffs, landings and local traffic patterns can be observed. The designated
      locations must provide the SOF with timely access to a SOF vehicle and the airfield when
      required. AFRC units are not required to have a dedicated vehicle for the SOF, but must be
      provided access to a vehicle to perform required duties in a timely manner.
      10.2. The primary SOF location for active duty bomber and fighter units will be in the
      control tower. The primary SOF location for all ACC flying units will be in the control tower
      (OG/CC may designate an alternate SOF duty location IAW this regulation). ANG/AFRC
      and smaller than wing-sized units will designate, in priority order, the SOF primary and
      alternate duty locations in their unit supplement to this instruction. Also see paragraph 16. for
      ANG/AFRC and smaller than wing-sized units. Unless contained in the following list, SOF
      duty locations need an OG/CC waiver:
      10.2. (AETC) The primary SOF duty location for SUPT, ENJJPT, PIT (except T-1 PIT),
      and fighter training is the tower. If the SOF is not in the primary duty location, he or she
      must be available to the OG/CC via a handheld radio or cellular phone.

      back, ground training courses, etc.). All SOF related items will be current. Qualified SOFs
      will not perform SOF duties in unqualified (UQ) status. EXCEPTION: AFRC OG/CC may
      approve qualified SOFs to perform SOF duties in UQ status on a case by case basis.
13. SOF Currency/Recurrency. The currency for SOF duties is 90 days (ANG/AFRC: 180
days; AETC ANG/Reserve Associate Instructor Pilots: 90 days). Individual squadrons will
track SOF currencies (Aviation Resource Management System [ARMS] preferred). To regain
currency, as a minimum, accomplish a 1-hour supervised tour with a current and qualified SOF.
13. (AETC)     SOF Currency/Recurrency. Within AETC, the currency for SOF duty
(including AFRC IPs) is 45 days and the following requirements apply:
      13.1. (Added-AETC) If 45 days pass without performance of SOF duty, the SOF will
      undergo refresher training to include a review of appropriate publications and a 1-hour on-
      the-job (OJT) training tour under the supervision of a current and certified SOF. The training
      folder will reflect the reason for loss of currency and the date of recertification. Both the
      current and noncurrent SOF will log the tour.
      13.2. (Added-AETC) If 90 days pass without performance of SOF duty, the SOF will
      undergo refresher training to include a review of appropriate publications; at least two 2-hour
      OJT tours under the supervision of a current and certified SOF; successful completion of a
      25-question written test. The training folder will reflect the reason for loss of currency and
      the date of recertification. Both the current and noncurrent SOF will log the tour.
      13.3. (Added-AETC) The squadron commander will review each instance of currency loss
      resulting in refresher training. The OG/CC will review and document the circumstances for
      individuals who exceed 60-day currency. If a SOF exceeds the 45-day currency requirements
      on two separate occasions, the OG/CC will review the circumstances to determine if the
      SOF’s removal from the SOF program is warranted.
14.    SOF Upgrade Program:
      14.1. Squadron commanders will screen and review qualifications of all SOF candidates
      before nominating them for entry into the upgrade program.
      14.1. (AETC)      Squadron commanders will nominate the minimum number of SOF

16. Provisions for ANG/AFRC and Smaller Than Wing-Sized Units. The provisions of this
paragraph apply to ANG/AFRC units and to units not directly associated with a typical wing
(i.e., geographically separated units/squadrons, detachments, etc.).
      16.1. If a unit operates from a location with another organization (i.e., tenant unit),
      integration into host unit supervisory program should be attempted if operations are
      compatible. These procedures will be implemented through LOAs/MOAs.
AFI11-418_AETCSUP_94AWSUP_I 7 DECEMBER 2009                                                     23


      16.2. In ANG/AFRC and smaller than wing size units, supervisory positions are limited
      based on unit authorizations. At the discretion of the OG/CC (or equivalent), more than one
      supervisory position may be covered by a single supervisor. The responsibilities of the SOF
      position take priority over all other duties and the single operations supervisor will be SOF
      qualified. Units will establish procedures in their unit supplement to this instruction for
      others to assist with SOF and Ops Sup duties and responsibilities if required during times
      when one supervisor is covering both SOF and Operations Supervisor positions.
      16.2. (94AW) Not applicable to 94 OG. According to Table 1, Note 1, airlift units are not
      required to have a SOF. Hence, there is no requirement to establish a procedure for others to
      assist with SOF and Ops Sup duties as described in this paragraph.
      16.3. For AFRC units which do not require a SOF, the OG/CC will designate duty
      locations and procedures for Ops Sup during IFEs in the unit supplement to AFI 11-418.
      16.3. (94AW) The Ops Sup primary duty location is the squadron operations area/duty
      desk. Alternate locations are, in priority order, the Command Post, Dobbins Air Traffic
      Control (ATC) Tower or Ops Sup vehicle. Emergency power out operations may be
      conducted in the Ops Sup vehicle. Contact via phone, hot line, Land Mobile Radio (LMR) or
      Nextel.
17.    SOF Program Administration:
      17.1. The OG/CC will designate an Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) for the
      administration of the program.
      17.1. (AETC) The OG/CC will appoint, in writing, a SOF program manager at the OGV
      level as the SOF OPR. (See paragraph 4.5 (Added) of this supplement for SOF program
      manager duties.)
      17.2. The OPR will:
         17.2.1.   Develop and administer the SOF initial training program.
         17.2.2. Develop and administer the SOF qualification test. This is a controlled test of at
         least 25 questions. It will be updated/reviewed annually.
         17.2.3. Retain all initial qualification and continuation training records IAW the Air
         Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at https://afrims.amc.af.mil.
         17.2.4. Establish procedures for monitoring SOF currencies and continuation training
         requirements (ARMS preferred).
         17.2.5.   Schedule semi-annual SOF meetings.
         17.2.5. (AETC) The SOF program manager will schedule and conduct quarterly SOF
         meetings. Attendees will include all SOFs, applicable air traffic control representatives,
         the chief of wing safety, a representative from base weather, the fire chief, and other
         members as determined by the OG/CC and outlined in the local supplement. The agenda
         will include a review of procedures and recent situations and emergencies. To stimulate
         discussion, the SOF program manager will use tapes of recent emergencies (if available).
         17.2.6. Publish SOF meeting minutes for review by SOFs and other supervisors unable
         to attend.
24                                    AFI11-418_AETCSUP_94AWSUP_I 7 DECEMBER 2009


         17.2.7.    Develop normal and emergency SOF checklists and review/update annually.
         17.2.8.    Update the SOF publications as required.

19.    Waivers.
19. (AETC) Waivers. (NA AFRC stand-alone) Unless otherwise specified, 19 AF/A3 is the
waiver authority for the basic instruction and this supplement. For waivers to unit supplements,
the OG/CC of the unit generating the supplement will handle waivers to supplemental guidance,
AFI11-418_AETCSUP_94AWSUP_I 7 DECEMBER 2009                                                    25


if used. 19 AF/A3 will send a copy of all approved waivers to HQ AETC/A3FV for file. The
wing or group SOF functional manager will maintain each approved waiver for 1 year. At that
time, the waiver will expire or must be reissued by 19 AF/A3. The wing or group SOF functional
manager will comply with guidance in AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management,
regarding waivers.
      19.1. Unit guidance cannot be less restrictive than the basic instruction except where
      specifically permitted. The OG/CC, unless otherwise stated, is the waiver authority for this
      instruction. Waivers may be issued for a maximum of 1 year or until this instruction is
      superseded, whichever occurs first. All waivers must be reviewed and renewed in one year
      increments to ensure their individual validity. Forward a copy of any waivers, through
      channels, to the MAJCOM/A3T (A3V) (or the equivalent). ANG/AFRC units will forward a
      copy to the Numbered Air Force /A3 with oversight responsibility. ACC-gained ANG units
      will forward a copy to HQ ACC/A3G.

in the recovery of a serious in-flight emergency. These procedures can put the OG/CC, SOF or
Ops Sup directly in contact with a representative from Air Logistics Center (ALC), the Wright
Patterson Program Office, or the contractor.
A4.1. (AETC) Conference Hotel Procedures. During local flying the command post will help
the SOF (as necessary) coordinate emergency response and facilitate CONFERENCE HOTEL
conference calls.
A4.2. Emergency Assistance Numbers. The following contractor, Program Office or ALC
numbers provide a link to the most knowledgeable maintenance and engineering personnel for
each weapons system. Once the terms "placing a CONFERENCE HOTEL call" are expressed,
the person receiving the call will put the flying supervisor in contact with the appropriate experts.
A4.3. Call Initiation. To initiate CONFERENCE HOTEL, contact the appropriate facility
IAW A4.5 and provide the following information:

                            INDEX OF THERMAL STRESS (ITS)

A5.1. (Added-AETC) Instructions. Enter the charts in Figure A5.1. (Added) and Figure
A5.2. (Added) with local dry bulb temperature and dew point temperature. At the intersection,
read ITS value and zone. (Note: These figures apply only to lightweight flight clothing.) The
“X” denotes combinations above saturation temperature.
A5.2. (Added-AETC) Procedures. The base weather shop determines the ITS zone. The SOF
will work the ITS zone applicability. Aircrew members will monitor their physical condition and
not exceed their capability for safe mission accomplishment. These procedures are only the
recommended limits of exposure. Wings are encouraged to develop additional restrictions if
mission requirements allow.
     A5.2.1.    (Added-AETC) Caution Zone:
        A5.2.1.1.      (Added-AETC) Be alert for symptoms of heat stress.
        A5.2.1.2.      (Added-AETC) Drink plenty of liquids (noncaffeinated).
        A5.2.1.3.      (Added-AETC) Limit ground operations time to 90 minutes (time outside
        an air-conditioned environment).
     A5.2.2.    (Added-AETC) Danger Zone.
     In addition to caution zone procedures:
        A5.2.2.1.      (Added-AETC) Avoid exercise 4 hours prior to takeoff on pattern only or
        low-level sorties.
        A5.2.2.2.      (Added-AETC) Minimum recovery time between sorties should be 2
        hours (landing time to next takeoff time). The SQ/DO or above will make an appropriate
        ORM determination when determining minimum recovery time for missions of short
        duration (for example, FCF or RSU sorties) or other non-standard situations on a case by
        case basis.
        A5.2.2.3.      (Added-AETC) Limit ground operations to 45 minutes for fighter- and
        trainer-type aircraft (time outside an air-conditioned environment). If exceeded, the
        minimum recovery time is 1 hour. All others may continue operations when the
        provisions of paragraph 4.1.9 (Added) are met.
        A5.2.2.4.       (Added-AETC) When possible, wait in a cool, shaded area if the aircraft
        is not ready to fly.
        A5.2.2.5.       (Added-AETC) Complete a maximum of two aircraft inspections (two
        exterior inspections on initial sorties and one exterior inspection on subsequent sorties for
        fighters and trainers).
        A5.2.2.6.      (Added-AETC) SUPT solo students may only accomplish one exterior
        inspection per sortie.
        A5.2.2.7.      (Added-AETC) Limit ground operations to 45 minutes for fighter- and
        trainer-type aircraft (time outside an air-conditioned environment). If exceeded, the
AFI11-418_AETCSUP_94AWSUP_I 7 DECEMBER 2009                                    51


      minimum recovery time is 1 hour. All others may continue operations when the
      provisions of paragraph 4.1.9 (Added) are met.

                                        CHILL INDEX

A6.1. (Added-AETC) Instructions. Enter the chart in Figure A6.1 (Added) with sustained
wind speed and temperature. At the intersection, read the wind chill value and danger zone. The
caution zone is determined as wind chill temperatures at or below freezing temperatures with a
risk of frostbite. The danger zone is determined at 30 minutes or less with a risk of frostbite
(depending on the temperature).
A6.2. (Added-AETC) Procedures. The base weather shop determines the chill index. The
SOF will use the chill index and determine applicability. Aircrew members will monitor their
physical condition and not exceed their capability for safe mission accomplishment. These
procedures are only recommended limits of exposure. Wings are encouraged to develop
additional restrictions based on mission requirements.
   A6.2.1.    (Added-AETC) Caution Zone:
   (Note: In this zone, wind chill temperatures are at or below freezing [32 oF or 0 oC].)
       A6.2.1.1.      (Added-AETC) Beware of stress due to cold temperatures.
       A6.2.1.2.      (Added-AETC) Limit ground operations to 30 minutes for fighter- and
       primary trainer-type aircraft (time outside a heated environment).
   A6.2.2.    (Added-AETC) Danger Zone (No Fly):
   (Note: In this zone, wind chill temperatures are at or below -20 oF or -29 oC. The OG/CC
   will ensure adequate means are employed to protect airlift, tanker, and special operations and
   rescue crewmembers from the adverse effects of temperature extremes when duty requires
   extended ground preparation.)
       A6.2.2.1.      (Added-AETC) Exposed flesh can freeze in 30 minutes or less.
       A6.2.2.2.      (Added-AETC) No flying is allowed for fighter- and primary trainer-type
       aircraft.
