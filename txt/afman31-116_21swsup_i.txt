                                      INTRODUCTION

1.1. Program Management. This manual implements policy, assigns responsibility and
establishes procedures for motor vehicle traffic supervision on Air Force installations located in
the continental United States (CONUS), outside the continental United States (OCONUS), and
deployed locations, where implemented. This AFMAN provides additional Air Force specific
guidance to complement guidance found in AFI 31-218 (I). The objective of traffic control
programs is the safe and efficient flow of vehicles and pedestrians through reduction of factors
contributing to accidents.
1.2. Responsibilities. Installation Defense Force Commander (DFC). The DFC is the
Installation Commander's principal advisor on issues pertaining to the lawful movement of
personnel and traffic. The DFC exercises staff responsibility for directing, regulating and
controlling traffic, and enforcing installation rules pertaining to traffic control. DFCs assist
traffic engineers by performing traffic control studies to gather information on traffic problems
and use patterns.
   1.2.1. (Added-21SW) Traffic Safety Committee. The Traffic Safety Coordinating Group
   (TSCG) is the designated body by the 21st Space Wing Commander (21SW/CC) who, in
   accordance with AFI 91-207, The US Air Force Traffic Safety Program, will prepare and
   review, as necessary, the 21SW Traffic Circulation Plan (TCP). The TSCG evaluates,
   studies, proposes, and approves measures to mitigate traffic hazards and improve installation
   traffic safety.
       1.2.1.1. (Added-21SW) The TSCG will include 21st Space Wing Safety (21 SW/SE,
       21st Security Forces Squadron (21 SFS), 21st Civil Engineer Squadron (21 CES), and
       21st Logistics Readiness Squadron (21 LRS), transportation function. The 21st Space
       Wing Office of the Staff Judge Advocate, installation drug and alcohol program officials,
       and local community authorities may also attend.
       1.2.1.2. (Added-21SW) The TSCG will meet annually, or more frequently as directed
       or required.
1.3. Delegation of Authority. Installation commanders may delegate their responsibilities
under this manual to their vice commanders, mission support commanders or other group
commanders as appropriate and provided the individual does not occupy a position such as law
enforcement which would constitute a conflict of interest. Commanders should coordinate letters
of delegation through their SJAs.
   1.3.1. (Added-21SW) 21 SW/CC delegates the authority under this manual to the 21st
   Mission Support Group Commander (21 MSG/CC) and 21st Mission Support Group Deputy
   Commanders (21 MSG/CD). This authority includes the suspension, revocation, and
   modifications of base driving privileges, as well as the rebuttal authority.  The
   representatives may also be referred to as "approval authorities."

1.4. (Added-21SW) General.
     1.4.1. (Added-21SW) This instruction specifically adopts selected portions of the Colorado
     Revised Statutes (CRS) and Colorado Springs local ordinances. Although not restated in full
     in this instruction, provisions of the CRS pertaining to motor vehicle and pedestrian traffic
     laws, which are not addressed herein, are expressly adopted and made applicable to PAFB.
     1.4.2. (Added-21SW) Criminal violations of the CRS are assimilated by the installation
     under U.S.C. Title 18, Section 13, and Department of Defense Directive (DoDD) 5525.4,
     Enforcement of State Traffic Laws on DoD Installations. Violations of CRS may result in
     prosecution before local civil authorities.
     1.4.3. (Added-21SW) Upon entering through any access/entry point on PAFB, drivers
     automatically imply consent to have their vehicle searched and inspected by Security Forces
     (SF) upon request. These entry points include installation entry control points, as well as
     restricted and controlled areas and their respective entry control points.
     1.4.4. (Added-21SW) Implied consent to blood, breath, or urine tests. Persons who drive on
     the installation shall be deemed to have given their consent to evidential tests for alcohol or
     other drug content of their blood, breath, or urine when lawfully stopped, apprehended, or
     cited for any offense allegedly committed while driving or in physical control of a motor
     vehicle on military installations to determine the influence of intoxicants.
        1.4.4.1. (Added-21SW) A person subject to chemical tests, as stated above may request
        that an additional test be done privately. The person may choose a doctor, qualified
        technician, chemist, registered nurse, or other qualified person to do the test. The person
        must pay the cost of the test. The test must be a chemical test approved by the State of
        Colorado, and will be completed as soon as possible, with any delay being noted on the
        results.
        1.4.4.2. (Added-21SW) The suspect is responsible for making all arrangements. If the
        suspect fails to or cannot obtain any additional test, the results of the tests that were done
        at the direction of a law enforcement official are not invalid and may still be used to
        support actions under separate Service regulations and the UCMJ.
     1.4.5. (Added-21SW) All operators and passengers in any vehicle will be properly
     restrained with seat belts or appropriate child-restraint devices. Restraint systems (seat belts)
     will be worn by all operators and passengers of U.S. Government vehicles on or off the
     installation.
     1.4.6. (Added-21SW) All operators of U.S. Government vehicles will comply with State
     and local traffic laws when operating U.S. Government vehicles on or off the installation.
AFMAN31-116_21SWSUP_I 25 JUNE 2013                                                               7


                                            Chapter 2

                                   DRIVING PRIVILEGES

2.1. Requirements for Driving Privileges. Each Installation Commander will determine if
international driver’s licenses will be recognized and authorized for use on the installation. Take
into consideration the local (civilian) jurisdiction’s policy on recognition and acceptance of
international driver’s licenses. As a general rule, most CONUS civilian jurisdictions will honor
use of international driver’s licenses for short periods of time by non-resident visitors and
assigned military personnel and dependents. When practical, Installation Commanders should
incorporate local guidance to prevent conflicts and confusion.
   2.1.1. (Added-21SW) Driving on PAFB is a privilege granted by 21SW/CC. Drivers who
   fail to comply with applicable traffic laws and instructions while driving within the legal
   boundaries of PAFB may have their driving privileges suspended or revoked.
   2.1.2. (Added-21SW) International driver's licenses are recognized and accepted on PAFB,
   IAW the state laws of Colorado.
       2.1.2.1. (Added-21SW) Foreign operators must carry their driver’s license from their
       home country. International driver’s licenses are valid IAW the state laws of Colorado.
       2.1.2.2. (Added-21SW) Military personnel returning from an overseas assignment with
       an international driver’s license must obtain a valid U.S. driver’s license in accordance
       IAW the state laws of Colorado.
2.2. Stopping and Inspecting Personnel or Vehicles.
   2.2.1. AFI 31-101, Integrated Defense, and AFI 10-245, Antiterrorism, require Installation
   Commanders to develop instructions and guidance that detail stop, inspection, search and
   impoundment of motor vehicles at CONUS installation entry gates, to include Air Force
   restricted and controlled areas.
   2.2.2. MAJCOMs responsible for overseas military installations must provide their
   Installation Commanders with written guidelines governing stop, inspection, search and
   impoundment of vehicles. This guidance must reflect host nation agreements and pass
   appropriate legal review. Note: A combatant commander or those commanding unified forces
   may direct guidance covering all installations under their command. In this case, MAJCOMs
   must review those policies before issuing their guidance.
   2.2.3. (Added-21SW) 21 SFS is responsible for traffic enforcement (i.e., traffic stops, etc.)
   on PAFB; however, due to PAFB’s proprietary jurisdiction, local law enforcement personnel
   (i.e., El Paso County Sheriff’s Office (EPSO), Colorado Springs Police Department (CSPD),
   Colorado State Police (CSP), etc.) are authorized, by law, to assist with traffic enforcement.
   Facility parking wardens are the only other individuals authorized to issue traffic citations on
   PAFB.
       2.2.3.1. (Added-21SW) Installation SFS personnel may conduct traffic stops,
       inspections (entry point checks), and searches of any vehicle on PAFB, including at
       installation entry control points, as well as restricted and controlled areas and their
       respective entry control points, for reasons specified in this instruction, and other
 8                                                  AFMAN31-116_21SWSUP_I 25 JUNE 2013


        governing directives, or if they believe the vehicle is unsafe or not properly equipped, as
        required by law. If a 21 SFS member determines a vehicle is in such condition that
        further operation would be hazardous, the vehicle will be driven to the nearest garage,
        place of safety, or immediately removed from PAFB. Should an installation entry
        controller detect a serious or hazardous violation, the vehicle will be denied entry to

AFMAN31-116_21SWSUP_I 25 JUNE 2013                                                               9


2.4. Implied Consent to Vehicle Impoundment. In addition to those conditions for
impoundment listed in AFI 31-218(I), paragraph 2-3, local situations may arise that require
impoundment. The determination will be made by the Installation Commander or designee.
Installation and unit commanders must view the abandonment of personal property as a
personnel management issue and be diligent in deterring occurrences. Commanders must include
the consequences when personal property is abandoned during familiarization and indoctrination
training into units. Additionally, measures must be established to ensure personal effects are
cleared prior to personnel departing on permanent change-of-station orders.
   2.4.1. (Added-21SW) PAFB unit commanders will ensure the inclusion of the
   consequences when personal property is abandoned during familiarization and indoctrination
   training into their units. Additionally, unit commanders will ensure personal effects are
   cleared prior to individuals departing on permanent change-of-station orders.
   2.4.2. (Added-21SW) The DFC is designated as the impoundment authority. The 21 SFS
   Investigations section (S2) has been delegated approval authority for the purpose contacting a
   towing company for vehicle impoundment on PAFB. On-duty 21 SFS flight chiefs, with
   concurrence of 21 SFS/S3 will contact S2 in order to obtain approval to tow vehicles. For
   processing procedures not listed in this supplement, refer to AFI 31-218 and 21 SFS local
   operating instructions.
2.5. Suspension or Revocation of Driving Privileges. Installation Commanders must
incorporate procedures governing suspension and revocation in base publications or as a
supplement to this instruction. Make these known to the base population. AF will follow the
administrative due process for suspensions detailed in AFI 31-218(I).
   2.5.1. Suspensions.
       2.5.1.1. Installation Commanders determine suspension and revocation guidance for non-
       moving violations, as well as what constitutes a non-moving violation on their
       installation (i.e., performing unauthorized repair; failure to register and insure vehicles;
       unauthorized modifications or alterations; failure to maintain safety standards, etc).
       Make these standards part of the local installation traffic code and take reasonable steps
       to make them known to the general public.
       2.5.1.2. Persons under the age of 21, when in the United States or where legal alcohol
       consumption age is 21, operating a motor vehicle with a BAC or BrAC level standard of
       .01 or higher is reason for automatic suspension. Refer to AFI 31-218(I) 2-
       4.a.(3).(a).(b).(c).(d). for additional guidance.
       2.5.1.3. The .08 blood alcohol limit for presumptive intoxication determination may be
       reduced to reflect a more stringent local, state or host nation standard.
          2.5.1.3.1. (Added-21SW) Operating a motor vehicle with a BAC or BrAC level of
          .05 but less than .08 may constitute driving while ability impaired (DWAI) and is a
          basis for suspension.
          2.5.1.3.2. (Added-21SW) Immediate suspension of installation driving privileges
          pending resolution of an intoxicated driving incident is authorized for active duty
          military personnel, family members, retired members of the military services, DOD
          civilian personnel, and others with installation driving privileges, regardless of the
10                                              AFMAN31-116_21SWSUP_I 25 JUNE 2013


         geographic location of the intoxicated driving incident. Suspension is authorized for
         non–DOD affiliated civilians only with respect to incidents occurring on the
         installation or in areas subject to military traffic supervision. After a review of
         available information, installation driving privileges will be immediately suspended
         pending resolution of the intoxicated driving accident in the below circumstances.
            2.5.1.3.2.1. (Added-21SW) Refusal to take or complete a lawfully requested
            chemical test to determine contents of blood for alcohol or other drugs.
            2.5.1.3.2.2. (Added-21SW) Operating a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol
            content (BAC) of 0.08 percent by volume (0.08 grams per 100 milliliters) or
            higher or in violation of the law of the jurisdiction that is being assimilated on the
            military installation.
            2.5.1.3.2.3. (Added-21SW) Operating a motor vehicle with a BAC of 0.05
            percent by volume but less than 0.08 percent blood alcohol by volume in violation
            of the law of the jurisdiction in which the vehicle is being operated if the
            jurisdiction imposes a suspension solely on the basis of the BAC level (as
            measured in grams per 100 milliliters).
            2.5.1.3.2.4. (Added-21SW) Operating a motor vehicle with a BAC of 0.05
            percent by volume but less than 0.08 percent blood alcohol by volume and
            evidence suggests the individual was operating a motor vehicle while impaired
            (DWAI).
            2.5.1.3.2.5. (Added-21SW) On an arrest report or other official documentation
            of the circumstances of an apprehension for intoxicated driving.
                2.5.1.3.2.5.1. (Added-21SW) Documents          supporting an  immediate
                suspension using memorandums pre-signed by the approval authority will be
                processed for review as outlined in paragraph 2.5.4.5.
  2.5.2. Revocation.
     2.5.2.1. The Installation Commander will immediately revoke driving privileges for a
     period of not less than 1 year when a serious incident involving a motor vehicle occurs
     and the Installation Commander determines immediate revocation of driving privileges is
     required to preserve public safety or the good order and discipline of military personnel.
     2.5.2.2. The DFC develops plans and procedures to forward revocation, suspension and
     driving records to gaining commanders and to initiate appropriate staff action when
     receiving similar records from losing commanders of inbound personnel.
     2.5.2.3. Installation Commanders may impose multiple suspensions to run consecutively
     or concurrently.
         2.5.2.3.1. (Added-21SW) In cases of multiple suspensions or revocations, the
         periods will run consecutively.
  2.5.3. (Added-21SW) Suspensions and revocations issued by another installation or service
  component may be honored by PAFB; however, PAFB will maintain their own suspension
  and revocation rosters independently from other installation rosters.
AFMAN31-116_21SWSUP_I 25 JUNE 2013                                                              11


       2.5.3.1. (Added-21SW) Upon notification of an inbound or newly arrived individual
       with suspended or revoked driving privileges, the installation's security forces reports and
       analysis section (S5R) will notify the individual’s gaining unit commander. The
       commander will ensure the individual is aware his/her suspension or revocation is still in
       effect on PAFB. Individuals will be added to the Suspension/ Revocation/ Debarment
       (SRB) Listing through the Security Forces Management Information System (SFMIS)
       and the Defense Biometric Identification System (DBIDS).
       2.5.3.2. (Added-21SW) The installation’s FSS will include 21 SFS/S5R in the virtual
       Military Personnel Flight (vMPF) outprocessing checklist. 21 SFS/S5R will follow
       procedures established in existing guidelines for forwarding suspension/revocation
       records to gaining units during reassignment.
   2.5.4. (Added-21SW) Administrative Due Process for Suspensions and Revocations.
       2.5.4.1. (Added-21SW) Suspension/Revocation Procedures. See Table 2.1. below for
       guidelines. NOTE: These guidelines are not all-inclusive and the approval authority
       reserves the authority to determine suspensions and revocations considering relevant
       circumstances on a case-by-case basis.

            2.5.4.1.1. (Added-21SW) 21 SFS/S5R will be the OPR for all suspensions and
            revocations. 21 SW/JA will review each suspension or revocation for legal
            sufficiency. 21 SFS/S5R will forward all suspensions and revocations to the approval
            authority for a final determination.
        2.5.4.2. (Added-21SW) 21 SFS will issue the written notice of suspension or revocation
        from the approval authority. The notice will specify the following: when the suspension
        or revocation becomes effective, which is normally 14 days after notification except for
        alcohol/drug related offenses; the period of time for which the suspension/revocation is
        effective; and the administrative hearing and appeal process.
AFMAN31-116_21SWSUP_I 25 JUNE 2013                                                              13


        2.5.4.2.1. (Added-21SW) When practicable, military members, federal employees,
        and contractor personnel will report with their supervisor to 21 SFS/S5R to personally
        receipt for the action and will sign an acknowledgement.
        2.5.4.2.2. (Added-21SW) Non-affiliated personnel (retirees, dependents, sponsored
        civilians, etc.) will be notified by certified mail. If after a reasonable attempt has been
        made to notify the individual, e.g., documented postal attempts, and contact has not
        been made with the individual, the suspension/revocation becomes effective
        immediately and is considered a refusal to sign.
     2.5.4.3. (Added-21SW) Unit commanders may request the suspension or revocation of
     driving privileges of personnel under their command by forwarding supporting
     evidence/documents to 21 SFS/S5R. These requests will be processed in the same
     manner as directed previously in this supplement.
     2.5.4.4. (Added-21SW) Non-intoxicated Driving Offenses. For offenses other than
     intoxicated driving, suspension or revocation of the installation driving privilege will not
     become effective until approval authority notifies the affected person and offers that
     person an administrative hearing. Suspension or revocation will take place 14 calendar
     days after written notice is received unless the affected person makes an application for a
     hearing within this period. Such application will stay the pending suspension or
     revocation for a period of 14 calendar days. Individuals may waive, in writing, the 14-day
     wait period. In this case, the suspension or revocation will be effective immediately upon
     the waiver.
        2.5.4.4.1. (Added-21SW) If, due to action by the Government, a hearing is not held
        within 14 calendar days, the suspension will not take place until such time as the
        person is granted a hearing and is notified of the action of the approval authority.
        However, if the affected person requests that the hearing be continued to a date
        beyond the 14–day period, the suspension or revocation will become effective
        immediately on receipt of notice that the request for continuance has been granted,
        and remain in force pending a hearing at a scheduled hearing date.
        2.5.4.4.2. (Added-21SW) If it is determined as a result of a hearing to suspend or
        revoke the affected person’s driving privilege, the suspension or revocation will
        become effective when the person receives the written notification of such action. A
        reasonable effort will be made to notify the individual immediately following the
        hearing. In the event that written notification cannot be verified either through a
        return receipt for mail or delivery through command channels, the approval authority
        will determine the effective date on a case–by–case basis.
        2.5.4.4.3. (Added-21SW) If the revocation or suspension is imposed after such
        hearing, the person whose driving privilege has been suspended or revoked will have
        the right to appeal or request reconsideration. Such requests must be forwarded
        through command channels within 14 calendar days from the date the individual is
        notified of the suspension or revocation resulting from the administrative hearing.
        The request will be submitted to 21 SFS/S5R, who will then forward the request to
        the approval authority. The suspension or revocation will remain in effect pending a
        final ruling on the request.
14                                             AFMAN31-116_21SWSUP_I 25 JUNE 2013


        2.5.4.4.4. (Added-21SW) If driving privileges are temporarily restored (that is, for
        family hardship) pending resolution of charges, the period of revocation (after final
        authority determination) will still total the mandatory 12 months. The final date of the
        revocation will be adjusted to account for the period when the violator’s privileges
        were temporarily restored, as this period does not count towards the revocation time.
     2.5.4.5. (Added-21SW) Intoxicated Driving Offenses. For drunk driving or driving
     under the influence offenses, reliable evidence readily available will be presented
     promptly to the approval authority for review and authorization for immediate suspension
     of installation driving privileges.
        2.5.4.5.1. (Added-21SW) Reliable evidence includes witness statements, military or
        civilian police report of apprehension, chemical test results if completed, refusal to
        consent to complete chemical testing, videotapes, and statements by the apprehended
        individual, field sobriety or preliminary breath tests results, and other pertinent
        evidence. Immediate suspension should not be based solely on published lists of
        arrested persons, statements by parties not witnessing the apprehension, or telephone
        conversations or other information not supported by documented and reliable
        evidence.
        2.5.4.5.2. (Added-21SW) Reviews normally will be accomplished within the first
        normal duty day, but as soon as practical, following final assembly of evidence.
        2.5.4.5.3. (Added-21SW) For active duty military personnel, final written notice of
        suspension for intoxicated driving will be provided to the individual in person, when
        practicable. If necessary forward the notice to the individual’s first sergeant or
        commander for immediate presentation to the individual. The individual will be
        required to provide written acknowledgement of receipt to 21 SFS/S5R. 21 SFS will
        provide the temporary suspension to the individual at the time of the incident, or
        when processing an immediate suspension. 21 SFS will maintain a copy of the
        temporary suspension and acknowledgement in accordance with records disposition
        schedules.
        2.5.4.5.4. (Added-21SW) For civilian personnel, written notice of suspension for
        intoxicated driving will normally be provided without delay via certified mail. 21 SFS
        will provide the temporary suspension to the individual at the time of the incident, or
        when processing an immediate suspension. 21 SFS will maintain a copy of the
        temporary suspension and acknowledgement in accordance with records disposition
        schedules. If the person is employed on the installation, such notice will be provided
        to the individual in person, when practicable. If necessary, forward through the
        military or civilian supervisor. When the notice of suspension is forwarded through
        the supervisor, the person whose privileges are suspended will be required to provide
        written acknowledgment of receipt of the suspension notice to 21 SFS/S5R.
        2.5.4.5.5. (Added-21SW) Notices of suspension for intoxicated driving will include
        the following:
            2.5.4.5.5.1. (Added-21SW) The fact that the suspension can be made a
            revocation under AFI 31-218 paragraph 2–4b.
            2.5.4.5.5.2. (Added-21SW) The right to request, in writing, a hearing before the
AFMAN31-116_21SWSUP_I 25 JUNE 2013                                                         15


          installation commander or designee to determine if installation driving privileges
          will be restored pending resolution of the charge; and that such request must be
          made within 14 calendar days of the final notice of suspension.
          2.5.4.5.5.3. (Added-21SW) The right of military personnel to be represented by
          counsel at his or her own expense and to present evidence and witnesses at his or
          her own expense. Installation commanders will determine the availability of any
          local active duty representatives requested.
          2.5.4.5.5.4. (Added-21SW) The right of DOD civilian employees to have a
          personal representative present at the administrative hearing in accordance with
          applicable laws and regulations.
          2.5.4.5.5.5. (Added-21SW) Written acknowledgment of receipt to be signed by
          the individual whose privileges are to be suspended or revoked.
          2.5.4.5.5.6. (Added-21SW) If a hearing is requested, it must take place within
          14 calendar days of receipt of the request. The suspension for intoxicated driving
          will remain in effect until a decision has been made by the installation
          commander or designee, but will not exceed 14 calendar days after the hearing
          while awaiting the decision. If no decision has been made by that time, full

             2.5.4.5.5.7.1. (Added-21SW) The law enforcement official had reasonable
             grounds to believe the person was driving or in actual physical control of a
             motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol or other drugs.
             2.5.4.5.5.7.2. (Added-21SW) The person was lawfully cited or apprehended
             for a driving under the influence offense.
             2.5.4.5.5.7.3. (Added-21SW) The person was lawfully requested to submit
             his or her blood, breath, or urine in order to determine the content of alcohol
             or other drugs, and was informed of the implied consent policy (consequences
             of refusal to take or complete the test).
             2.5.4.5.5.7.4. (Added-21SW) The person refused to submit to the test for
             alcohol or other drug content of blood, breath, or urine; failed to complete the
             test; submitted to the test and the result was 0.08 or higher BAC, or between
             0.05 and 0.08 in violation of the law of the jurisdiction in which the vehicle in
             being operated if the jurisdiction imposes a suspension solely on the basis of
             the BAC level; or showed results indicating the presence of other drugs for an
             on–post apprehension or in violation of State laws for an off–post
             apprehension.
             2.5.4.5.5.7.5. (Added-21SW) The testing methods were valid and reliable
             and the results accurately evaluated.

            revocation is mandatory on conviction or other findings that confirm the charge.
            (Pleas of nolo contendere are considered equivalent to guilty pleas).
                2.5.4.5.5.8.1. (Added-21SW) Revocations are effective as of the date of
                conviction or other findings that confirm the charges. Test refusal revocations
                will be in addition to any other revocation incurred during a hearing.
                Revocations for multiple offenses will run consecutively when taking into
                consideration if offenses occurred on the same occasion or different times,
                dates. The exception is that test refusal will be one year automatic revocation
                in addition to any other suspension.
                2.5.4.5.5.8.2. (Added-21SW) The notice that revocation is automatic may be
                placed in the suspension letter. If it does not appear in the suspension letter, a
                separate letter must be sent and revocation is not effective until receipt of the
                written notice.
                2.5.4.5.5.8.3. (Added-21SW) Revocations cancel any full or restricted
                driving privileges that may have been restored during suspension and the
                resolution of the charges. Requests for restoration of full driving privileges are
                not authorized.
     2.5.4.6. (Added-21SW) Administrative Hearing Requests. Requests for administrative
     appeal/hearing are made by submitting a request in writing and indorsed by their

       or upon direction of the approval authority.
       2.5.4.10. (Added-21SW) Reinstatement of Driving Privileges. Unit commanders who
       wish to request reinstatement of driving privileges for personnel under their command
       must submit the request in writing to 21 SFS/S5R, who will forward to approval authority
       for consideration and disposition.
           2.5.4.10.1. (Added-21SW) The request must contain justification for reinstatement.
           Once action is taken by the approval authority, the request and disposition will be
           forwarded to 21 SFS/S5R for required action and filing.
       2.5.4.11. (Added-21SW) Restricted driving privileges or probation. Any individual,
       other than those whose privileges were suspended for intoxicated driving offenses, may
       request limited driving privileges. Submit written requests, indorsed by the individual's
       commander (military members and dependants or DoD employees) or supervisor

       to the approval authority.
           2.5.4.11.1. (Added-21SW) Probation or restricted driving privileges will not be
           granted to any person whose driver license or right to operate motor vehicles is under
           suspension or revocation by a State, Federal, or host nation licensing authority. Prior
           to application for probation or restricted driving privileges, a State, Federal, or host
           nation driver’s license or right to operate motor vehicles must be reinstated. The
           burden of proof for reinstatement of driving privileges lies with the person applying
           for probation or restricted driving privileges. Revocations for test refusals shall
           remain.
           2.5.4.11.2. (Added-21SW) 21 SW/JA will review the request for legal sufficiency
           and provide a recommendation to the approval authority. 21 SFS/S5R will then
           forward to the approval authority for final determination.
       2.5.4.12. (Added-21SW) At least once a month, SFS/S5R notifies 21 SW/SE and 21
       LRS of any changes in the driving privileges of personnel concerned. Refer to AFI 91-
       207, The US Air Force Traffic Safety Program, and any applicable supplements, for more
       information on safety’s role.
2.6. Alcohol and Drug Abuse Programs. After coordination with the SJA, unit commanders
will direct drug and/or alcohol testing within 24 hours of suspected alcohol related motor
vehicle/traffic incidents or misconduct, episodes of aberrant or bizarre behavior or where there is
reasonable suspicion of drug use and the member refuses to provide consent for testing.
Commanders are also encouraged to ensure Blood Alcohol Tests (BAT) are taken as soon after
the incident as possible to determine the level and intensity of alcohol involvement. For
additional information refer to AFI 31-218(I).
   2.6.1. (Added-21SW) 21 SFS will process alcohol and drug-related driving offenses in
   accordance with established instruction, guidance, and procedures.

   1315, Accident Report, field sketch, scale diagram (if death or serious bodily harm), and
   accident narrative.
4.3. Traffic Accident Investigation Reports.
   4.3.1. Military members report information to Security Forces if they are on/off base
   resulting in accidents involving injuries or damage to military property. Local guidance will
   capture procedures to accomplish these notifications and the timeframes to report.
   Installation Commanders determine what agencies to notify and for what type of accidents to
   notify them. The DFC must develop a local notification matrix or other procedures to ensure
   proper notification of appropriate base and civilian agencies are conducted. Develop and
   publish these notification procedures locally.
   4.3.2. Security Forces will act as the focal point for gathering off-base accident information
   of military affiliated personnel. Record the information in the Security Forces blotter, along
   with the associated case number from the investigating police agency. When possible,
   Security Forces Reports and Analysis (S5R) will obtain copies of major accident reports
   prepared by investigating civilian police agencies to accompany off-base accident reporting
   information.
   4.3.3. Security Forces respond to all on-base major vehicle accidents (unless local conditions
   or policies prohibit) to accomplish the following:
       4.3.3.1. Render first aid and arrange for medical assistance.
       4.3.3.2. Protect personal property.
       4.3.3.3. Normalize traffic.
       4.3.3.4. Identify witnesses and personnel involved.
       4.3.3.5. Conduct a formal investigation.
       4.3.3.6. The DFC (with Installation Commander approval) will develop local response
       and investigative procedures for various types of accidents to include minor vehicle
       accidents. S/He may delegate this authority to on-duty Security Forces supervisory
       personnel.
   4.3.4. Record accident information in the Security Forces blotter. This information should
   include the accident type, time and date, location, name(s) of vehicle operator(s), unit (or
   address when civilian not affiliated with military), vehicle description and license
   number(s)/plate. Also, include a brief summary of any damage and circumstances behind or
   causing the accident, as well as any traffic citations issued.
       4.3.4.1. (Added-21SW) Traffic Accident Investigation Reports. 21 SFS is primarily
       responsible to conduct vehicle traffic accident investigations on the installation.

             SFS/S5R and will be released in accordance with the Privacy Act and the
             Freedom of Information Act.
  4.3.5. Investigation conducted by Security Forces and/or AFOSI of any traffic accident will
  take precedence over any other types of investigations relating to the accident. This
  precludes the loss of any potential evidence that may later have to be introduced in any
  criminal/judicial proceedings. (Example: Any safety related investigation and/or any other
  investigation that may hamper accident investigation practices by Security Forces and/or
  AFOSI.)
  4.3.5. (21SW) Investigation conducted by Security Forces and/or AFOSI of any traffic
  accident will take precedence over any other types of investigations relating to the accident.

AFMAN31-116_21SWSUP_I 25 JUNE 2013                                                            25


  4.4.1. Reserved Parking. When not addressed by MAJCOMs, Installation Commanders
  determine reserved parking guidance for their installations. Number of available spaces,
  facility design and layout, traffic flow and number of vehicles using facilities will help
  determine the number and location of reserved parking spaces. Make guidance and
  procedures governing reserved parking a part of the installation supplement to this
  instruction, separate traffic control instruction or installation-parking plan. The publication
  must address approval, issue, control and review of reserved parking and should give special
  consideration to bicycle, motorcycle, visitor and car pool parking. Consideration should also
  be given to labor and management contracts when designating parking. Handicap parking is
  regulated under the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards and applies to all Air Force
  installations.
     4.4.1.1. (Added-21SW) See Appendix 3 for the PAFB Reserved Parking Plan.
  4.4.2. Use distinctive emblems, decals, stickers, etc, to control parking space assignments
  and to indicate authorized use of the parking slot. MAJCOMs (or Installation Commanders if
  not addressed by the MAJCOM) may develop guidance concerning the issue and control of
  the identification media discussed above. Designation of parking spaces by name, grade, rank
  or title should be avoided due to force protection concerns.
  4.4.3. Installations may create a parking wardens program to monitor and cite parking
  violators at their facilities.
     4.4.3.1. If utilized, installations will develop a local publication to
     supplement/implement this instruction addressing the parking warden program. The
     supplement will include a requirement for individual unit commanders to delegate a
     minimum of one primary and alternate at the grade of E-5 or above, in writing. All
     monitors will issue parking tickets on the DD Form 1408, Armed Forces Traffic Ticket.
     S5R will obtain a letter with the current monitors and maintain the letter on file.
     4.4.3.2. Monitors will be trained by the Security Forces unit on the correct procedures to
     complete tickets, including the routing process of issued tickets to S5R. The main
     difference between a DD Form 1408 issued by a Security Forces member and one by a
     parking monitor is the special instructions on the back of the pink copy that directs the
     violator to contact the monitor within 24 hours or next duty day who issued the ticket
     instead of Security Forces. Monitors will provide contact information on parking tickets
     to enable violators to provide information necessary to complete the citation.
     4.4.3.3. (Added-21SW) PAFB Parking Warden Program. Units may use facility
     parking wardens (unit personnel) to monitor and cite parking violators, especially within
     off-street parking facilities. Parking wardens will be provided books of DD Forms 1408,
     Armed Forces Traffic Tickets, and will be trained by 21 SFS/S5R on the correct
     procedures to complete the tickets. Parking wardens will only issue citations for parking
     (non-moving) violations.
         4.4.3.3.1. (Added-21SW) Unit commanders choosing to participate in the Parking
         Warden Program will delegate parking wardens, in writing, for participation in the
         Parking Warden Program. 21 SFS/S5R will obtain a letter with the current parking
         wardens and maintain the letter on file. The letter will specify a minimum of one E-5
         or above primary and alternate.

           4.4.3.3.2. (Added-21SW) All parking wardens will issue parking tickets on the DD
           Form 1408.
           4.4.3.3.3. (Added-21SW) Parking wardens must include special instructions on the
           back of the pink copy directing the violator to contact the parking warden who issued
           the ticket. The parking warden must include how and where they can be reached by
           the violators so they can provide the parking warden with the necessary information
           to complete the citation.
           4.4.3.3.4. (Added-21SW) All active duty, guard, reserve, civil service, contractor,
           and visitor parking violations will be cited via DD Form 1408 and forwarded not later
           than the next duty day to 21 SFS/S5R after completion by the parking warden.
           4.4.3.3.5. (Added-21SW) 21 SFS/S5R will process the citation IAW governing
           instructions.
   4.4.4. (Added-21SW) Refer to Attachment 3 for the PAFB Parking Plan.
4.5. Off-installation Traffic Activities. The DFC must develop procedures for the sharing and
exchanging of information with civil authorities. Local procedures must cover the receiving,
processing and securing of traffic and related incident reports received from other investigative
agencies. Unit commanders will be notified when personnel under their authority are involved in
serious off-base incidents (i.e., major accidents, DUI, hit and run, etc).
4.5. (21SW)Off-installation Traffic Activities. The DFC must develop procedures for the
sharing and exchanging of information with civil authorities. Local procedures must cover the
receiving, processing and securing of traffic and related incident reports received from other
investigative agencies. Unit commanders will be notified when personnel under their authority
are involved in serious off-base incidents (i.e., major accidents, DUI, hit and run, etc).
   4.5.1. (Added-21SW) The DFC will, by way of Memorandum of Agreement
   (MOA)/Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs), or through local collaborative, coordinate
   with local law enforcement agencies to ensure the prompt exchange of information.
       4.5.1.1. (Added-21SW) 21 SFS/S5R will request reports from civil authorities when
       PAFB-assigned personnel are involved in serious off-base incidents. Once reviewed, 21
       SFS/S5R will secure and process the reports in same manner as if the incident occurred
       on the installation.

when the vehicle will be driven or moved without owner’s consent if the owner cannot be
contacted or the owner refuses and conditions in AFI 31-218(I) are present.
6.2. Procedures for Impoundment. At times, civilian law enforcement or civilian government
agencies will request the Air Force impound an on-base vehicle for reasons not related to
military issues. Staff such requests through the SJA and DFC. When appropriate, comply and
support such requests and impound the vehicle for a reasonable period. Release the vehicle if
civil authorities do not take custody of the vehicle within a reasonable period as determined by
Installation Commanders.
   6.2.1. (Added-21SW) See Attachment 2 of this instruction for PAFB procedures for
   impoundment.
6.3. Disposition of Vehicles After Impoundment. Impoundment and disposition of privately
owned vehicles is a high-risk process. It is imperative an installation have a detailed plan to:
Ensure wide publicity of base impoundment rules; have a process to provide reasonable notice of
impoundment and an opportunity to reclaim a vehicle; conduct a review of proposed disposal by
appropriate base offices, to include the SJA, prior to taking action; and a process to obtain retail
records of these actions in the event of litigation or high-level inquiry. Further information on
impoundment can be found in AFI 31-218(I).
   6.3.1. (Added-21SW) See Attachment 2 of this instruction for PAFB procedures for the
   disposition of vehicles after impoundment.

           Military uniforms do not qualify as meeting this criterion. If a dark colored upper
           outer garment or ABU is worn, a safety vest of any high visibility color must be
           worn by the operator (belts alone do not qualify). During nighttime hours (1 hour
           before sunset to 1 hour after sunrise) or times of reduced visibility, operators must
           wear a retro-reflective upper garment. The reflective material may be part of the
           upper outer garment. Wearing a backpack is authorized if it has high visibility
           colors/high visibility reflective properties or does not obscure the high visibility
           and reflectivity of the rider’s upper garment. Backpacks alone, even if they have
           bright colors (daytime) and reflective material (nighttime), do not satisfy these
           requirements. Upper outer garments shall be clearly visible at all times.

     deemed mission-essential and only for official purposes. In all cases, owning/operating
     units must also ensure they comply with requirements identified in AFI 91-207.
     A2.1.3.11. (Added-21SW) Drivers of all government owned vehicles will not back up
     unless it can be done safely and without interfering with other traffic. A vehicle spotter
     will be used during backing operations. If a spotter is not available, the driver will check
     behind the vehicle for adequate clearance before backing.
     A2.1.3.12. (Added-21SW) Bicycles. Bicyclists must ride with the flow of traffic. Refer
     to AFI 91-207, for more information on bicycle safety.
        A2.1.3.12.1. (Added-21SW) Bicycles will not be ridden on sidewalks. The
        exceptions are bicycles with training wheels or bicycles ridden by children 10 years
        of age or younger.

     inclement weather and unsafe conditions are subject to a suspension of their base driving
     privileges.
        A2.1.3.13.1. (Added-21SW) After determination that the PAFB road conditions are
        "priority" and roads are closed, it shall be unlawful for any driver to obstruct the flow
        of traffic due to lack of adequate traction equipment. For the purpose of this
        provision, snow tires, chains, or 4-wheel drive will be considered adequate
        equipment.
        A2.1.3.13.2. (Added-21SW) Vehicles left abandoned during such periods may be
        towed by 21 SW or locally-contracted civilian tow companies at the owner's expense.
        In such cases, SF personnel are not required to cite vehicles or give advance
        notification. SF will attempt to notify the owner of this action and where the vehicle
        is located.
     A2.1.3.14. (Added-21SW) Operation of Emergency Vehicles. The driver of an
     authorized emergency vehicle, when responding to an emergency call, or when in pursuit
     of an actual or suspected violator of the law, or when responding to but not upon
     returning from a fire alarm, may exercise the privileges IAW CRS 42-4-108, Public

          except at a designated pickup or drop-off point or in an emergency.
          A2.1.3.20.6. (Added-21SW) Pedestrians will use sidewalks when available. Where
          no sidewalk exists, pedestrians will walk single file facing oncoming traffic and will
          not walk on roadway pavement (except to cross intersections) unless no other option
          exists.
          A2.1.3.20.7. (Added-21SW) Troops in Formation will march on the right side of the
          roadway with the direction of traffic. Personnel in front and rear ranks will use
          fluorescent or reflective personal protective equipment or organizational clothing
          with sewn-on reflective tape. Road guards will be provided for safety at intersections.
      A2.1.3.21. (Added-21SW) Major vehicle maintenance on any POV may not be
      performed anywhere on PAFB due to environmental spill hazards.
      A2.1.3.22. (Added-21SW) Owners of vehicles identified or cited for not meeting the
      safety standards will correct the discrepancy and present evidence of correction to SF
      within 10 days of the citation. If the defect is satisfactorily repaired or corrected no points
      will be assessed against the individual's on-base driver's record. However, if the vehicle
      operator or owner fails to correct the discrepancy within 10 days, points will be assessed
      and the operator or owner will remove the vehicle from PAFB until the discrepancy is
      corrected. The only exception to this requirement is for vehicles taken to an appropriate
      repair facility for repairs. Evidence of such disposition of vehicles will be presented to SF
      within 10 days of citation and again when the discrepancy has been corrected. When an
      extension is needed, the owner of the vehicle must contact 21 SFS/S5R; extensions will
      be granted on a case-by-case situation.
A2.2. (Added-21SW) PAFB standards for impoundment.
   A2.2.1. (Added-21SW) POVs should not be impounded unless the vehicles clearly interfere
   with ongoing operations or movement of traffic, threaten public safety or convenience, are
   involved in criminal activity, contain evidence of criminal activity, or are stolen or

     vehicle. In this case, the owner, operator, or person empowered to control the vehicle will
     be informed that law enforcement personnel are not responsible for safeguarding the
     POV.
  A2.2.3. (Added-21SW) Impounding of POVs is justified when any of the following
  conditions exist:
     A2.2.3.1. (Added-21SW) The POV is illegally parked
        A2.2.3.1.1. (Added-21SW) On a street or bridge, in a tunnel, or is double parked,

        on a railroad track, in a fire lane, or is blocking a driveway, so that the vehicle
        interferes with operations or creates a safety hazard to other roadway users or the
        general public. An example would be a vehicle parked within 15 feet of a fire hydrant
        or blocking a properly marked driveway of a fire station or aircraft–alert crew facility.
        A2.2.3.1.3. (Added-21SW) When blocking an emergency exit door of any public
        place (installation theater, club, dining hall, hospital, and other facility).

      conspicuously placed on POVs considered unattended. This action will be documented
      by an entry in the 21 SFS blotter.
      A2.3.1.2. (Added-21SW) The owner will be allowed 3 days from the date the POV is
      tagged to remove the vehicle before impoundment action is initiated. If the vehicle has
      not been removed after 3 days, it will be removed by the installation towing service or the
      contracted wrecker service. If a contracted wrecker service is used, a DD Form 2505
      (Abandoned Vehicle Removal Authorization) will be completed and issued to the
      contractor by 21 SFS.
      A2.3.1.3. (Added-21SW) After the vehicle has been removed, 21 SFS or the contractor
      will complete the DD Form 2506 (Vehicle Impoundment Report) as a record of the
      actions taken.
         A2.3.1.3.1. (Added-21SW) An inventory listing personal property will be done to
         protect the owner, law enforcement personnel, the contractor, and the commander.
         A2.3.1.3.2. (Added-21SW) The contents of a closed container such as a suitcase
         inside the vehicle need not be inventoried. Such articles should be opened only if
         necessary to identify the owner of the vehicle or if the container might contain
         explosives or otherwise present a danger to the public. Merely listing the container
         and sealing it with security tape will suffice.
         A2.3.1.3.3. (Added-21SW) Personal property must be placed in a secure area for
         safekeeping.
      A2.3.1.4. (Added-21SW) The DD Form 2507 (Notice of Vehicle Impoundment) will be
      forwarded by certified mail to the address of the last known owner of the vehicle to

   A2.4.1. (Added-21SW) Search of a POV in conjunction with impoundment based on
   criminal activity will likely occur in one of the following general situations:
      A2.4.1.1. (Added-21SW) The owner or operator is not present. This situation could
      arise during traffic and crime–related impoundments and abandoned vehicle seizures. A
      property search related to an investigation of criminal activity should not be conducted
      without search authority unless the item to be seized is in plain view or is readily
      discernible on the outside as evidence of criminal activity. When in doubt, proper search
      authority should be obtained before searching.
      A2.4.1.2. (Added-21SW) The owner or operator is present. This situation can occur
      during either a traffic or criminal incident, or if the operator is apprehended for a crime or
      serious traffic violation and sufficient probable cause exists to seize the vehicle. This
      situation could also arise during cases of intoxicated driving or traffic accidents in which
      the operator is present but incapacitated or otherwise unable to make adequate
      arrangements to safeguard the vehicle. If danger exists to the police or public or if there is
      risk of loss or destruction of evidence, an investigative type search of the vehicle may be
      conducted without search authority.
A2.5. (Added-21SW) PAFB Procedures for disposition of vehicles after impoundment.
   A2.5.1. (Added-21SW) If a POV is impounded for evidentiary purposes, the vehicle can be
   held for as long as the evidentiary or law enforcement purpose exists. The vehicle must then
   be returned to the owner without delay unless directed otherwise by competent authority.
   A2.5.2. (Added-21SW) If the vehicle is unclaimed after 120 days from the date notification
   was mailed to the last known owner or the owner released the vehicle by properly completing
   DD Form 2505, the vehicle will be disposed of by one of the following procedures:
      A2.5.2.1. (Added-21SW) Release to the lienholder, if known.
      A2.5.2.2. (Added-21SW) Process as abandoned property in accordance with DOD
      4160.21–M.
          A2.5.2.2.1. (Added-21SW) Property may not be disposed of until diligent effort has
          been made to find the owner; or the heirs, next of kin, or legal representative of the
          owner.
          A2.5.2.2.2. (Added-21SW) The diligent effort to find one of those mentioned in

The Installation Planning Committee (IPC), chaired by the 21 SW/CC (or designated
representative) has final approval authority for all reserved parking plans.
A3.2. (Added-21SW) Policy. Spaces reserved for handicapped personnel and government
vehicles are determined first from the total available. Approval authorities may assign up to 10%
of the remaining number of available spaces in an area as reserved parking. Up to half (5%) of
the allowable 10% may be assigned to key personnel (commanders or equivalent, first sergeants,
chief enlisted managers, command chief master sergeants, etc.). The remaining 5% can be used
for award winners, volunteer, customer parking, etc. Spaces reserved for handicap will be those
closest to the facility followed by those for official vehicles. Facility managers are required to
maintain a map of their assigned parking areas identifying the current number of reserved
parking spaces. 21 CES will also maintain a current list of all approved reserved parking spaces.
Special consideration should be given to bicycle, motorcycle, visitor and car pool parking.

   Form 332, Base Civil Engineer Work Request) work order for reserved parking spaces to 21
   CES, after coordinating the request with 21 SFS and any other affected facility manager(s).
   Requests will be completed as follows:
       A3.3.1.1. (Added-21SW) Provide a map or drawing depicting the parking area, total
       spaces, number, and desired location of the reserved spaces, designation for each space
       and the name and duty phone of the facility manager submitting the request.
       A3.3.1.2. (Added-21SW) The approval authority, 21 CES will notify the requester of
       the decision. The decision is final. The requester will receive the approved request back
       and submit the request to 21 CES to have the spaces marked.
   A3.3.2. (Added-21SW) Signs and markings for reserved parking spaces will be in
   compliance with current facility excellence program requirements.
   A3.3.3. (Added-21SW) Facility managers or special event coordinators are responsible for
   the placement and removal of temporary signs after coordination with 21 CES and 21 SFS.
