                                       GENERAL GUIDANCE

1.1. Maintenance Concept. The overall mission of Air Force maintenance is to provide aerospace sys-
tems ready to fly and fight, and to sustain mission-ready equipment at the time and place it is needed.
Maintenance tasks are divided into two categories, on-equipment (maintenance performed directly on the
aerospace vehicle or support equipment) and off-equipment maintenance (maintenance performed to
removed component parts of the aerospace vehicle or support equipment). In turn, these categories may
be preventive or corrective in nature, and may be performed at the wing, regional, and depot level. Most
Air Force weapon systems are currently repaired at three levels: organizational (on-equipment), interme-
diate (off-equipment), and depot. Each level indicates the type of repair to be performed from simplest to
most difficult. Organizational is the simplest and consists of minor repairs, cannot duplicate testing
(CND), and calibration. Intermediate repair is primarily testing and replacement of component parts.
Depot level are those repairs that could not be accomplished at the intermediate level and major over-
hauls.
The Air Force however, is shifting its maintenance philosophy, procedures, and organization to accommo-
date a two level maintenance (2LM) approach. Changing to a 2LM concept by modifying and/or elimi-
nating the intermediate (off-equipment) function where possible; and where possible, consolidating that
repair function at a depot or regional level, successfully supports the Air Force objectives of reducing
manpower, equipment, facilities, and mobility footprint while still meeting its Global Engagement mis-
sion objectives. The Air Force adopted the 2LM concept for new and upcoming weapon systems, and to
the extent practical for existing weapon systems. Using state-of-the-art communications, item visibility,
and fast transportation systems, unserviceable parts will be moved rapidly to and through the regional,
depot, or contractor repair processes. 2LM will be performed at the appropriate organic Air Force
regional, depot and/or contractor repair activity.
A regional repair center concept embodying Air Force and DOD doctrine can also provide lowered cost
per flying hour maintenance and reduce manning requirements accordingly. A regional repair center is a
hybrid of 3LM and 2LM and combines intermediate level maintenance from multiple bases to one loca-
tion. Therefore, to the effected bases, the unserviceable assets are treated as 2LM and shipped to the
regional repair center. The regional repair center performs the traditional intermediate level maintenance
and the depot still performs the same type of repairs under the 3LM concept. This regional repair center
concept should be applied where it makes good economic sense, as it offers similar advantages to that of
2LM. Some of these advantages are:
   1.1.1. Consolidates like-maintenance efforts.
   1.1.2. Affords a mobility/surge option.
   1.1.3. Provides a second source and/or multiple sources of repair.
   1.1.4. Provides a source of experienced personnel.
   1.1.5. Allows for increased repair flexibility while maintaining lower overall repair costs due to econ-
   omies of scale.

1.2. General Guidance. This section describes the various organizational responsibilities for managing
the 2LM program. All requests for policy/procedural changes and waivers to this AFI will be submitted
4                                                                               AFI21-129 1 MAY 1998

by the MAJCOM/ANG/FOA to HQ USAF/ILMM for HQ USAF/ILM approval and/or disapproval. All
approved changes will be coordinated through the appropriate HQ USAF/IL Directorates.
    1.2.1. HQ USAF/ILM Responsibilities.
       1.2.1.1. The Air Force focal point for overall Air Force 2LM policy and guidance issues.
       Establishes and approves procedures, changes, and waivers for all 2LM policy.
       1.2.1.2. Develop Air Force automated measurements and/or standards of performance data that
       reflect the current 2LM performance of weapon systems and it included, support equipment items
       and/or components.
    1.2.2. MAJCOM/ANG/FOA Responsibilities.
       1.2.2.1. Designate focal points to work organizational, functional, and technical issues
       pertaining to their respective 2LM programs.
       1.2.2.2. Develop respective automated measurements and/or standards of performance data that
       reflect the current 2LM performance of their weapons systems and if included, support equipment
       items and/or components, as required.
       1.2.2.3. HQ AFMC/LG, in conjunction with the Air Force Air Logistics Centers, contractor repair
       activities, and customers will: develop, collect, track, and/or analyze Air Force 2LM data using
       the appropriate metrics. The AFMC/LG will have available these metrics for the respective cus-
       tomers and/or HQ USAF, as required.
       1.2.2.4. HQ AFMC/LG will maintain current criteria for analyzing candidate items for conver-
       sion from 3LM to 2LM or from 2LM to 3LM.
       1.2.2.5. All requests for a Second Source of Repair will be forwarded to AFMC/LGP for AFMC/
       LG approval/disapproval.
    1.2.3. Single Manager Responsibilities.
       1.2.3.1. Identify candidates for possible 2LM conversion. (See Chapter 5 for additional responsi-
       bilities)
    1.2.4. Customer Responsibilities.
       1.2.4.1. By Mission Design Series (MDS), designate a focal point for functional, technical, and
       quality assurance matters relating to 2LM items.

1.3. Metrics. The successful implementation of 2LM principles relies upon the ability to accurately mea-
sure and evaluate logistics actions throughout the repair pipeline. Metrics are required to gauge weapon
system performance under 2LM and evaluate effectiveness of depot and base support. These indicators
will provide 2LM information to key decision makers. They will be capable of supporting changes in
operating behavior and environments. They can serve as an diagnostic tool, and can be used individually
or jointly to aid management decision-making.
    1.3.1. Purpose of 2LM Metrics. To provide specific levels of management with information that
    will identify problems, suggest solutions, establish benchmarks, lead to changes in 2LM maintenance
    behavior, and establish correct goals and incentives at all levels of 2LM operations. Some metrics will
AFI21-129 1 MAY 1998                                                                                  5

  be established for use solely at the MAJCOM/ANG/FOA level or higher; others will include more
  detailed indicators of performances and/or will be more diagnostic in design to help resolve problems.
     1.3.1.1. Defining the proper metrics that support 2LM maintenance is a key issue in the overall
     Air Force Logistics concept. It is imperative that all those involved in the implementation and
     management of 2LM, focus on a standard set of terms, definitions, and metrics for measurement
     and evaluation purposes. Metrics are divided into the following categories:
         1.3.1.1.1. Maintenance
         1.3.1.1.2. Supply
         1.3.1.1.3. Transportation
         1.3.1.1.4. Depot (regional and/or contractor repair facilities)

                    TWO LEVEL MAINTENANCE CONVERSION GUIDANCE

2.1. General. Requests for policy, procedural changes and waivers to this AFI will be submitted through
the MAJCOM headquarters organizations, to HQ USAF/ILMM for HQ USAF/ILM approval and/or dis-
approval. It is the users’ responsibility, per T.O. 00-25-195, to detect opportunities for improved source,
maintenance, and recoverability (SMR) codes. Requests for code changes will be IAW T.O. 00-25-195.

2.2. Decision Processes. The selection of a 2LM item is a detailed and deliberate process involving a
series of decision steps. These steps each include a set of criteria which key decision makers and manag-
ers can use in evaluating items for inclusion into the 2LM process and/or removal from 2LM back to
3LM. The action to transfer an item into or out of 2LM must be a joint decision of the MAJCOM/ANG/
FOA, Item Manager and any potential customers. The decision begins as a broad base filter and as each
step or filter is applied, the criteria becomes more stringent. The first step provides three sorting tech-
niques to begin the overall analysis of assets for possible transition to 2LM. The sorting techniques focus
on combat readiness as the primary criteria, potential savings associated with eliminating manpower tied
to intermediate level repair and avoiding the cost of buying high acquisition cost items. Cost savings
must take into account residual tasks that must remain at the unit, i.e. F-16 CND screening/quick repair.
2LM candidates should be highly reliable, have a low demand on supply, have sufficient spares, and be
easy to transport. Single Managers will identify items that have these characteristics. An example would
be aircraft avionics as these items are generally small, and many are highly reliable. Periodic review pro-
cesses will ensure that both unmodified and modified and/or redesigned items are evaluated using this
first step in the conversion criteria. The second step will involve more detailed analysis using specially
developed metrics. An automated matrix will allow for further analysis of potential NSNs, by comparing
them against various logistics indicators such as Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) and CND rates.
The third step will involve evaluating the 2LM candidate list in terms of cost to transition to a different
repair level, potential reduction in mobility footprint, and impacts to operational capability. The final step
requires the Single Managers to run a checklist of repair environment and funding factors against the
National Stock Numbers (NSNs) they are still considering for 2LM. This AFI will not cover the specific
2LM conversion criteria. The 2LM conversion criteria incorporating the various decision steps can be
found in Air Force Handbook (AFH) 21-130, Technical Analysis to Determine Criterion for Two Versus
Three Level Repair.
    2.2.1. Common Items. If an item is used on more than one weapon system and has been identified by
    a Single Manager as a 2LM candidate, the policy is it should be 2LM for all weapon systems. How-
    ever, the decision to make it 2LM across the Air Force should be based on what is in the best interest
    of all weapon systems. The initiating Single Manager will coordinate with the other effected Single
    Managers and the effected Single Managers should apply the criteria listed in AFH 21-130. The
    action to make an item 2LM common across multiple weapon systems must be a joint decision of the
    Single Managers, MAJCOM/ANG/FOA, Item Manager and any potential customers. An annual
    aggregate Two-Level Coordination and Activation Process (TCAP) meeting is the recommended
    forum to do this. If the joint decision is to “not” make the item common, the initiating Single Manager
    can still gain approval for the item to be 2LM on the single weapon system but the item will “not” be
    coded as 2LM in the Air Force supply system.
AFI21-129 1 MAY 1998                                                                                    7

2.3. Responsibilities. The intended user of this 2LM Conversion Criteria AFH will be the various single
managers and senior logistics representatives from the appropriate MAJCOMs/ANG/FOA.

2.4. Applications. The 2LM Conversion Criteria can be applied to most items in order to enter as many
items into the 2LM process as practical. In addition, this criteria will be implemented when significant
change and/or changes occur in an item’s reliability, supply availability, or transportation requirements.

                                   MOVEMENT OF REPARABLES

3.1. General. 2LM must concentrate on continual improvement of the unit’s mission capability by inte-
grating and using the best business practices and logistics concepts. The main objective of Air Force
Logistics is to maximize operational capability by using high velocity, time-definite processes to manage
mission and maintenance uncertainty. This, in-turn, gives the Air Force shorter repair and delivery times,
reduced inventories and associated costs, and a smaller mobility footprint. To improve the operations of
the reparable and/or serviceable pipeline, Air Force 2LM operations will use:
    3.1.1. Fast, time-definite delivery transportation to and from the depot or other source of repair.
    3.1.2. Expedited DLA processing of reparables to the appropriate depot repair shop, non-batch repair
    processes, and the use of express transportation to return serviceable assets to the wing/installation or
    deployed location.
    3.1.3. Expedited evacuation of reparables by the base to the appropriate depot.

3.2. Retrograde Movement Standards and Goals. All 2LM coded LRUs are to be evacuated off the
base/installation within a standard time of two working days/48 hours. The start clock is when Base Sup-
ply issues a replacement LRU to the requesting maintenance activity or the maintenance activity removes
the 2LM LRU off the weapon system, which ever occurs first. The stop clock is when the carrier picks up
the 2LM LRU. If a unit is deployed and transportation channels exist, the unit will make every effort to
meet the two workday/ 48 hour standard. Customers will use either standard depending on their current
automated information system ability/capability to measure evacuation times.
    3.2.1. Automated systems will be used to the maximum extent possible to command, control, com-
    municate, track, and monitor the movement of reparables and/or serviceable 2LM items through the
    needed repair actions, to include transportation and supply.
    3.2.2. Base Installation - Maintenance, Supply, and Transportation functions will develop coordi-
    nated processes, to include cut-off times, to facilitate evacuation of the reparable from the base/instal-
    lation.
    3.2.3. HQ AFMC will ensure that all depots and related like facilities:
       3.2.3.1. Repair on demand all 2LM reparable items required by the customer. 2LM coded items
       will not be batch-processed at the source of repair. If repair of items are being accomplished at a
       regional MAJCOM/ANG/FOA owned facility, the owning organization will ensure that all 2LM
       reparable items are repaired IAW this AFI.
       3.2.3.2. Determine the required bit and piece requirements needed to fully implement 2LM.
       3.2.3.3. Institute streamlined repair processes for contractor repair operations and meet similar
       repair times as organic Air Force repair operations.
       3.2.3.4. Use item/asset pipeline visibility tools at all organic and contract repair activities to mon-
       itor the logistics pipeline flow.
       3.2.3.5. Develop processes to ensure all reparable items are reviewed for 2LM applicability.

     3.2.3.6. In conjunction with the Single Managers, and respective MAJCOMs/ANG/FOA, will
     ensure that items identified as 2LM are updated in the Stock Number Users Directory (SNUD) and
     Federal Logistics Data (FED LOG) system.
     3.2.3.7. Have a surge plan for 2LM items.

               MAINTENANCE, SUPPLY AND TRANSPORTATION PROCESSING

4.1. General. There are several Air Force Logistics concepts and strategies upon which 2LM depends.
Their main purpose is to develop and improve the pipeline processes, causing less reliance on inventories,
ensuring a sufficient flow of items to and from units/installations, and deployed units. These concepts
are:
     4.1.1. High Speed Processes
     4.1.2. Right-Sized Inventories
     4.1.3. Asset/Item Visibility Tools
     Wing/installations will support the concept of high-speed processes to ensure an uninterrupted flow of
     items through the logistics pipeline. The support concept for inventories will have the appropriate
     amount of inventory supporting the wing/installation, based on Readiness Based Leveling (RBL)
     computations. Wings/installations will acquire and use asset/item visibility tools. Managers will
     oversee the logistics pipeline, to ensure that the flow of assets through the system is not constrained,
     thus threatening combat capability. Managers must improve and update business practices, policies,
     management structures, and information systems to achieve more efficient, effective, logistics sys-
     tems. This will allow better decision making about possible re-allocation of items and/or focus man-
     agement attention on areas within the pipeline that are not performing as desired.

4.2. Maintenance Processing.
     4.2.1. Once Base Supply issues a replacement 2LM LRU or the 2LM LRU item is removed from the
     weapon system (which ever occurs first), 2LM reparable items must be processed and either installed
     back on the aircraft or turned into Base Supply (serviceable or unserviceable) within one workday/24
     hours. Base maintenance activities are authorized to do Cannot Duplicate (CND) screening and minor
     (quick) repairs only as long as it can be accomplished within one workday/24 hours and does not
     sub-optimize overall base repair capability. The one workday/24 hour standard includes any time
     spent in non-chargeable Due-In-From-Maintenance (DIFM) status codes (i.e., AWP, DWP).

4.3. Supply Processing.
     4.3.1. HQ AFMC/LG will ensure that all 2LM NSNs (addition/deletions) are pushed to the bases via
     SNUD as changes occur. Base supply personnel are responsible to process these SNUD inputs and
     ensure appropriate codes are loaded in SBSS. Although this process is automated, there are instances
     when the proper codes will not be loaded unless supply personnel manually load them; i.e. MICAP/
     off-line requisitions, post-post processing, and new NSN loads. MAJCOM/ANG/FOA LGSs will
     implement training and procedural guidance to ensure their personnel process these requisitions prop-
     erly.
     4.3.2. MAJCOM/ANG/FOA will ensure SBSS records are modified to preclude requisitioning of
     SRUs indentured to 2LM LRUs and excess SRUs are identified for disposition by the Item Manager.
     HQ AFMC/LG and the Single Managers will develop a process to identify and update this SRU list
     for MAJCOM/ANG/FOA validation processing.

   4.3.3. 2LM reparable items must be processed through Supply and Transportation within one work-
   ing day/24 hours (from NRTS turn-in to carrier pick-up). Wings/installations will implement stream-
   lined processes that assure this time frame is met.
   4.3.4. 2LM requisition procedures are identified in AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2, Part Two.

4.4. Transportation Processing.
   4.4.1. Traffic managers must ensure that reparable 2LM items are evacuated as quickly as possible
   for shipment to repair activities. Shipment planners must make every effort to ship those assets the
   same day they are received from Supply or Maintenance organizations. Enroute transportation activ-
   ities will expedite movement of 2LM reparable items to minimize delays. Receipting transportation
   activities will also ensure that 2LM items are quickly processed and transferred to Supply or Mainte-
   nance activities.
   4.4.2. Transportation organizations will ensure that 2LM items are moved using fast, time-definite
   best value transportation, including both Air Mobility Command (AMC) and commercial express
   door-to-door service. Delivery performance, speed, flexibility and consistency, will be the top criteria
   in selecting among defense transportation system carriers.
   4.4.3. All organizations will reuse serviceable shipping containers to help expedite shipment of 2LM
   reparables to and from the organization and source of repair.

TWO LEVEL MAINTENANCE ANNUAL REVIEW OF WEAPON SYSTEMS AND SUPPORT
                           EQUIPMENT

5.1. General. The evolving environment in Air Force Logistics has resulted in many changes in the way
the Air Force thinks about, and performs, maintenance. Critical to meeting many maintenance require-
ments will be accurately forecasting 2LM actions for the DOD Future Year Defense Plan (FYDP). These
fiscal requirements, will in turn, enable the Air Force to achieve the goals of the DOD Logistics Strategic
Plan, partially by, reducing the costs and mobility footprint associated with maintenance. The result will
be the best peace and wartime logistics profile that optimizes future Air Force roles and missions. There-
fore, HQ AFMC, along with the Air Force Single Managers, and with the respective MAJCOM/ANG/
FOA logistics representatives, will:
     5.1.1. Meet at least annually (more often if needed) to review potential 3LM items for inclusion into
     2LM.
     5.1.2. Identify any 2LM candidates that should be returned to 3LM.
     5.1.3. Ensure that the respective organizational Unit Type Codes (UTCs) are tailored to reflect the
     2LM manpower and equipment changes.
     5.1.4. Ensure that any changes to either 2LM or 3LM items are identified to the appropriate MAJ-
     COM/ANG/FOA Comptroller organization, so they are included in estimated fiscal impacts.
     5.1.5. Ensure that MRSP/IRSP and other spares packages are modified to represent the proper
     deployable maintenance support tasking.

Terms
Air Mobility Express (AMX)—AMX is the Air Force’s adaptation of commercial overnight delivery
that consists of (1) express carrier’s CONUS infrastructure, (2) AMC airlift (organic/CRAF), and (3) the
theater distribution system for express shipments. CRAF carriers provide DOD not only the use of
aircraft, but their integrated CONUS express infrastructure. Express carrier’s distribution structure will
be used to pick-up/deliver cargo to/from their hubs where the carrier’s personnel will load, off-load, and
service AMC airlift missions. AMC will provide daily round trip direct service between the express
carriers CONUS hub(s) and the designated APODs in the theater of operations. The theater commander
will establish a distribution system that provides next day delivery of critical cargo.
Awaiting Parts (AWP)—Elapsed time a reparable spends awaiting parts while in the repair cycle.
Batch Processing—The accumulation of assets to achieve economic process quantity inducted into
maintenance.
Express Transportation—Express Transportation leverages the relatively low cost and high reliability
of fast transportation against the high cost of maintaining large inventories of spare parts. Express
Transportation will be used to speed the shipment and return of 2LM items.
Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)—A measure of the average time between failures of weapon
system and/or equipment item functions.
Mobility Readiness Spares Packages (MRSP)—An air transportable package of spares and repair parts
required to sustain planned wartime or contingency operations of a weapon or support system for a
specified period of time pending resupply.
Order and Ship Time (O&ST)—Represents the expected number of days between initiation of a
requisition and receipt of the stock by the user.
Retrograde—Reparable carcasses returning to the depot from operation locations and units/installations.
Single Managers—Refers to a System Program Director (SPD) or Product Group Manager (PGM).
