                                   GENERAL GUIDANCE

1.1. Objective and Scope. This instruction specifies the responsibilities of Air Force Weapons
and Tactics Offices, Weapons Officer (WO) management, WO utilization, Weapons Instructor
Course (WIC) standup, WIC closure and Air Reserve Component (ARC) agreements.
Throughout this instruction, Weapons and Tactics Offices (or their equivalent) are referred to as
"weapons shops." Due to the diversity of weapons shops, this instruction provides only common,
required actions. Specific programs may require MAJCOM, Numbered Air Force (NAF), Wing,
Operations Group (OG) or Squadron supplements to this instruction. Throughout this
publication, the USAF Weapons School is abbreviated as "USAFWS" or “WS” and wherever the
term MAJCOM is used, it also refers to MAJCOM equivalent organizations (e.g. Air Force
Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance Agency (AFISRA) where no MAJCOM exists).
Additionally, AFSOF will be referred to as “SOF” throughout this document.

4.4. WIC Establishment/Termination/Modification.
   4.4.1. Approval authority. All proposals to establish or terminate WICs will be approved by
   the CSAF. Requests shall be submitted from the sponsoring MAJCOM/A3 to the USAF
   Warfare Center commander (USAFWC/CC). Once the USAFWC/CC determines the
   prospective WIC meets the entry standard, the request will be staffed from the sponsoring
   MAJCOM/A3 to ACC/A3 (through A3TW), to the CSAF for final approval. Requests to
   terminate a WIC will follow the same procedure. Requests to modify an existing WIC shall
   be staffed to ACC/A3TW and must be approved by COMACC. (T-1)
   4.4.2. WIC Standard of Entry. Any weapons system or combat capability seeking a weapons
   instructor course at the Weapons School must satisfy five criteria: (1) mission requirement
   (2) weapons officer utilization (3) supportability (4) command and control and (5) mission
   integration. Once the five criteria are satisfied, the staffing process may begin. Entry into a
   WIC and award of the W-prefix is restricted to officers.
      4.4.2.1. Mission Requirement. Every weapons instructor course must conduct the
      preponderance of its mission in one or more of the following Air Force Service Core
      Functions.
          4.4.2.1.1. Air Superiority (ACC).
          4.4.2.1.2. Space Superiority (AFSPC).

          4.4.2.1.8. Command and Control (ACC).
          4.4.2.1.9. Personnel Recovery (ACC).
          4.4.2.1.10. Nuclear Deterrence Ops (AFGSC).
   4.4.3. Weapons Officer Utilization. The requesting MDS or combat capability, represented
   by the lead-MAJCOM Functional Area Manager (FAM) in close-coordination with the
   Program Element Manager (PEM), must provide the USAFWC a complete written Concept
   of Operations (CONOPS) that answers the following questions:
      4.4.3.1. What is the undergraduate career path (what path does an officer take from entry
      in the MDS or combat capability that leads them to the USAFWS)?
12                                                           AFI11-415 15 OCTOBER 2014


     4.4.3.2. What are the requirements for entry into the WIC (must be consistent with the
     established guidelines in sections 5 of this publication and applicable WIC
     Announcement Message)?
     4.4.3.3. How many Tier 1 and Tier 2 W-prefix billets do you anticipate needing in the
     field? The Tier 1 number will help define the instructor and class size requirements.
     4.4.3.4. What are the syllabus requirements?
     4.4.3.5. What is the utilization plan for graduates (number of weapons officers required
     throughout the AF for this MDS/combat capability on a Tier-based experience and
     priority plan consistent with 6.5, below)?
     4.4.3.6. How many graduates are required per year (based on AF total required to keep
     mission viable)?
     4.4.3.7. What is the support plan for the graduate requirement (instructors/support
     personnel)?
  4.4.4. Supportability Requirement.
     4.4.4.1. The completed CONOPS must also address how the weapon system or combat
     capability will dedicate sufficient resources (manpower and funding) to support the
     graduate requirement. The resources will include dedicated TF-coded aircraft or
     Memoranda of Agreement clearly defining how the host organization will support the
     WIC as well as a supportable funding line for the initial startup and sustainment of the
     proposed WIC. If funding has not been identified and secured throughout the life of the
     proposed WIC, it will not be considered valid or supportable and coordination will cease.
     4.4.4.2. Organizations hosting WIC squadrons must provide sufficient training,
     maintenance and office facilities to meet the graduate production requirements as
     determined by a formal Site Activation Task Force (SATF). ACC will conduct SATFs for
     USAFWS. All SATFs will include respective USAFWS representation.
  4.4.5. USAFWS Command and Control Requirement. USAFWS squadrons will be under the
  command of the USAFWS Commandant (USAFWS/CO) and report through the 57th Wing
  to the USAFWC under ACC.
  4.4.6. The staffing process starts with the lead-MAJCOM FAM/PEM and will culminate
  with CSAF approval for WIC stand-up. Once the USAFWC determines the prospective WIC
  meets the entry standard, the request will be staffed as an Organization Change Request
  (OCR) from the lead-MAJCOM FAM/PEM (sponsoring MAJCOM) to ACC. Failure to
  provide sufficient information will cause delays in ACC manpower, programming and
  funding analysis. The first two steps below can take from 6 months up to one year to
  complete. Since the program objective memorandum (POM) budget cycle is two years, this
  process should start a minimum of two and one-half years prior to desired execution. Military
  construction (MILCON) requests must go through Congress and can take five years for
  execution. Once a completed CONOPS is received from the sponsoring MAJCOM,
  ACC/A3TW, as the ACC advocate, will ensure all staffing actions from the lead-MAJCOM
  FAM’s request through CSAF signature are completed. (T-1)
     4.4.6.1. ACC/A3TW will review the OCR and proposed syllabus for coordination and
     seek ACC/A3 endorsement. (T-1)
AFI11-415 15 OCTOBER 2014                                                                      13


      4.4.6.2. The endorsed OCR will be forwarded to ACC/A1M (Manpower & Org) &
      ACC/A5P (Programs), while the proposed syllabus will be routed through ACC Training
      Support Squadron (TRSS). These organizations will seek Air Staff approval for
      organizational structure, manpower and logistics requirements utilizing the Logistics
      Composite Model (LCOM), coordinate/conduct all necessary environmental/other impact
      studies and determine funding requirements. (T-1)
      4.4.6.3. ACC/A1M, ACC/A5P and ACC/A3TW will interact with ACC/FM and the Air
      Staff to facilitate funding, manpower and logistics support. (T-1)
      4.4.6.4. ACC/A3TW, through ACC/A3 and COMACC, will submit the completed
      package to CSAF for final approval. (T-1)
      4.4.6.5. See Attachment 4, Procedures to establish a new WIC.
4.5. WIC Cancellation/Termination/Modification. Cancellation of a specific WS WIC class
(e.g. Class 13B) requires coordination with AFPC and all affected MAJCOMs culminating in
ACC/A3 approval.
   4.5.1. Cancellation of WIC class for a specific MDS. Requests for cancellation of MDS
   WICs (e.g. B-2 WIC 15B) must be submitted to ACC/A3TW for ACC/A3 approval.
   Requests must provide ample justification, including impact to affected MDS community and
   specific reasons for the request. ACC/A3 is the final authority for specific WIC cancellations.
   (T-1)
   4.5.2. Reduction of WIC class size. Requests to intentionally reduce specific MDS WIC
   class size for a given course (e.g. A-10 WIC 15B) must be submitted to ACC/A3TW for
   ACC/A3 approval. Requests must provide ample justification to reduce course size,
   including impact to affected MDS community and specific reasons for the request. ACC/A3
   is the final authority for WIC reduction of class size. (T-1)
   4.5.3. Termination of a WIC. Requests to terminate a WIC due to changes in AF force
   structure or changing AF requirements should be initiated by the WIC’s supporting
   MAJCOM through ACC/A3TW. ACC/A3TW, through ACC/A3 and COMACC, will
   submit the completed package to CSAF for final approval. (T-1)
   4.5.4. Modification of a WIC. Requests to modify the structure of a WIC to meet emerging
   AF requirements (e.g. MQ-1/9 rapid CAP growth or F-15C Redux), requires COMACC
   approval. Modifications include permanent increased/decreased class size which will result
   in increased/decreased instructor staff and the appropriate changes in facility size, funding
   requirement, flying hours, etc. Requests to permanently modify a WIC must provide ample
   justification to include impact to affected MDS community and specific reasons for the
   request. COMACC is the final authority for specific WIC modifications. (T-1)

   appropriate) to release individual nominees to compete for WS selection. (T-1)
   5.2.7. MAJCOMs will provide one representative for the board. This representative must be
   familiar with the command's nominations and provide additional information (if required) for
   a full evaluation. (T-1)
   5.2.8. HQ AFPC/DPOAT3 will support the selection board. This includes, but is not limited
   to, preparation of selection folders, assisting with board facilities and selection notification.
   (T-1)
   5.2.9. Wing commanders. Wing commanders (and equivalent) are responsible for
   nominating qualified individuals, ensuring WS selects meet course prerequisites, and
   initiating waiver request actions or withdrawal/deferment requests when selects are unable to
   meet course prerequisites before CSD. Individual units are responsible for providing a
   complete selection package. These packages must contain all the information specified in the
   USAFWS Announcement Message. Failure to provide the required information could result
   in the disqualification of the nominee. Do not submit additional paperwork (e.g. additional
   recommendation letters or endorsement letters). If a wing nominates more than one
   individual (per crew position/MDS) for a WIC, the WG/CC must also provide a letter
   prioritizing the nominees (by crew position/MDS) to HQ ACC/A3TW, IAW the USAFWS
   Announcement Message. Send a courtesy copy of the nominee rankings to the respective
   MAJCOM (or equivalent) weapons shops (if other than ACC). Wing Commander’s
   prioritization receives significant consideration, but is not the sole criteria for selection. (T-3)
5.3. Nomination Criteria.
   5.3.1. The Air Force Education and Training Course Announcement (ETCA) and the
   USAFWS Announcement Message establish Weapons School nomination criteria. The
   ETCA is located at https://etca.randolph.af.mil. These criteria are designed to ensure
   selection of the most highly qualified individuals who will enhance combat capability
   throughout the Air Force. The WS seeks only the finest officers and tactical instructors.
   These officers must exhibit extraordinary intelligence, dedication, technical skill, military
   bearing, and professional attitude. Finally, these officers must be outstanding role models for
   their peers and subordinates.
   5.3.2. Officers placed on assignment (already received orders) outside of their Major
   Weapon System (MWS) prior to the WIC selection board date are ineligible for
   consideration. This includes any assignment to a staff or AOC, regardless of attached flyer
   status (except space or intelligence officers assigned to AOC duties within their career field).
   Waivers will not be considered for officers on assignment outside their MWS.
   5.3.3. All Active Duty (AD) nominees will be counseled that they incur an active duty
   service commitment (ADSC) IAW AFI 36-2107, Active Duty Service Commitments, Table
   1.1, Rule 17, and applicable notes upon entry into the WIC (not applicable for ARC
   nominees). All AFRC nominees will be counseled that they incur a 3-year Reserve Service
   Commitment (RSC), upon completion of WS, IAW AFRCI 36-2102, Air Force Reserve
   Service Commitment Date Program.
   5.3.4. Applicants competing for WIC must be instructor qualified in their respective weapon
   system at least six months prior to the course start date. Intelligence WIC applicants must be
16                                                           AFI11-415 15 OCTOBER 2014


  External Intelligence Trainer (EIT) qualified if required under AFI 14-202V2 series and
  applicable AFDCGS MDS specific series. SOF WIC applicants are required to meet the
  instructor qualified timeline given above or 50 hours of instructor time in Primary Aircraft
  Assigned (PAA) by course start date. See paragraph 5.6.1.2 for CSD waivers. (T-1)
  5.3.5. Total Force Absorption Program (TFAP). TFAP pilots will apply through their active
  duty chain of command, but will not be ranked among nominees from their associate
  administrative organization. Instead, TFAP pilots will compete as “at large” candidates IAW
  the CSAF-approved TFAP CONOP. Active Component (AC) members embedded into the
  “Active Association” construct will accompany TFAP candidates and compete as “at large”
  candidates
  5.3.6. Individual nomination packages will be a single consolidated document, formatted in
  accordance with the USAF Weapons School Announcement Message, and will include the
  following:
     5.3.6.1. Nomination Data Sheet. An example of the nomination data sheet is located on
     the            HQ            ACC/A3TW             share            point             site.
     https://cs.eis.af.mil/weptac/Wpnschool/Sample%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx
     IAW Social Security Reduction Act of 2007, do not include full or partial social security
     numbers in nomination packages.
     5.3.6.2. Endorsement memo. A single endorsement memo, signed by the applicant’s
     Wing commander or equivalent, shall emphasize instructor and flying/operational
     abilities. Do not submit additional endorsement memos or endorsement memos above the
     wing commander level. Submit endorsement memo on single page letterhead addressed
     to the Chairman, USAF Weapons School Selection Board. Ensure the letter is dated and
     electronically signed (type “//SIGNED//” above official signature block). Example
     endorsement letters are located on the HQ ACC/A3TW share point site.
     https://cs.eis.af.mil/weptac/Wpnschool/Sample%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx
     5.3.6.3. Submit Air Force Fitness Management Scores. Applicants will include AF
     Fitness score documentation IAW the USAFWS Announcement Message.
     5.3.6.4. Packages will consist of the following elements in the following order: 1)
     applicant’s data sheet, 2) one-page endorsement memo, 3) fitness results, 4) last three
     Form 8s (front and back) and all 942s (as applicable), and 5) any additional
     documentation instructed by the USAFWS Announcement Message. Do not fax hand-
     signed documents, or send each document of the nomination package as a separate file.
     Wing commanders (and equivalents), or their executive staff should e-mail nomination
     packages directly to HQ ACC/A3TW, with a courtesy copy to the appropriate MAJCOM
     weapons shop, by the due date established in the USAFWS Announcement Message.
     Nomination packages submitted directly by individuals or offices below wing
     commander (or equivalent) shall not be considered. (T-1)
     5.3.6.5. Timelines for nomination packages. Nomination packages for WS selection
     boards are due to ACC/A3TW approximately 60 days prior to the selection board date.
     Nominee information is due to AFPC/DPAOT3 from ACC/A3TW approximately 45
     days prior to the board date. Complete nomination packages and wing commander
     ranking letters are due to AFPC/DPAOT3 from ACC/A3TW NLT 30 days prior to the
AFI11-415 15 OCTOBER 2014                                                                     17


       selection board date. Late nomination packages will be accepted only if coordinated with
       ACC/A3TW in advance (prior to the nomination package due date established in the
       USAFWS Announcement Message). All other late nomination packages will be
       considered on a case-by-case basis. WS Selection Board and nomination package
       timelines, due dates, and examples will be available on the HQ ACC/A3TW share point
       site. (T-1)
5.4. Selection Board.
   5.4.1. The primary goal for the WS selection board is to select the most qualified officers.
   Minimum allocations to the ARC are shown in Table 1. These officers will provide the
   expertise and leadership necessary to ensure their units are ready for combat. In an effort to
   ensure the most qualified officers are selected every class, individual WICs will consider
   applicants from all ARC components. AFRC/ANG will participate in the combined AD/ARC
   board and vote on behalf of their MAJCOM for all WIC classes. HQ AFPC will host or
   support two WS selection boards each year, each approximately 4 to 5 months prior to WS
   class-start date. The WS/CO, or his designated representative, will chair each board. The
   chairman will instruct board members on their duties and ensure the board progresses
   efficiently. The WS/CO will resolve questions on procedures, policies or selection criteria
   and will review board recommendations to ensure selections are fair and equitable. The
   chairman will be the final approval authority for board composition. The MDS allocations
   not included in the table will be discussed and decided during the W-Prefix Management
   Conference held in conjunction with the combined WIC Selection Board. Factors influencing
   final slot allocation include, but are not limited to, USAFWS WIC production capabilities,
   ANG requirements, AFRC requirements, AD requirements, and availability of viable
   ARC/AD candidates. Total Force Integration (TFI) wings do not present a standard or easily
   quantifiable requirement for allocations. TFI wing requirements will attempt to be satisfied
   within existing ARC slot allocations. If TFI wing requirements cannot be satisfied within
   existing ARC allocations, then allocations will be decided during the W-Prefix Management
   Conference as outlined above. (T-1)
   5.4.2. WIC Commanders, HQ ACC/A3TW, HQ AFGSC/A3TW, HQ USAFE/A3TW, HQ
   PACAF/A3OW, HQ AETC/A3Z, HQ AFSPC/A3TW, AFSOAWC/A9T, HQ AMC/A3DT,
   HQ AFRC/A3T, and ACC/A3G will each provide one voting member. A representative will
   be available from AFPC/DP (assignment officer for each respective weapons
   system/specialty) to provide information as required. With WS/CO approval, additional non-
   voting officers may attend to provide information for various systems or specialties.
   Selections are based on records scoring made by voting members only. (T-1)

   5.4.3. WS Selection Boards will select the most qualified nominees, regardless of unit or
   command retainability. The board chairman (WS/CO) will attempt to resolve selection
   disagreements. If the board chairman is unable or unwilling to resolve disagreements,
   ACC/A3 is the final authority for all selection board issues. If necessary, ACC/A3 can direct
   the board to reconvene in order to settle disagreements. If the disagreement involves
   selection of an AD member over the ARC and the result will place the ARC outside of 11-
   415 unit refresh rates, ACC/A3 will coordinate with AFRC/A3 or ACC/A3G prior to
   finalizing the selection list. (T-1)
5.5. Selects.
AFI11-415 15 OCTOBER 2014                                                                     19


  5.5.1. WS selects will attend classes as specified in the AFPC/DPAOT3 “USAF Weapons
  Instructor Course Selection Board Results” message, normally released as a Personnel
  Services Delivery Memorandum (PSDM) to base Force Support Squadrons (FSS).
  Immediately upon selection notification, all primary and alternate selects must begin
  processing requirements outlined on the WS web page. All WS students are required to have
  a current TS clearance with SCI access based on a closed and adjudicated Single Scope
  Background Investigation (SSBI) or SSBI Periodic Reinvestigation (SBPR) with an
  investigation date within 5 years of course graduation date (CGD), or have an open SBPR.
  Primary and alternate WS selects without a current TS/SCI clearance must contact their unit
  security managers and submit all applicable paperwork immediately. Failure to initiate
  security clearance actions within the WS mandated timeline may result in inadequate security
  access at CSD. The WS/CO may disenroll individuals without the proper accesses.
  5.5.2. Selects must ensure they meet all CSD requirements, including security clearance
  requirements, prior to reporting to WIC. CSD requisites are defined in each WIC syllabus
  and in the Selection Board Announcement Message prior to each class. If an individual is
  unable to meet course entry requisites due to extenuating circumstances, the select’s WG/CC
  (or equivalent) must submit a CSD waiver request (see paragraph 5.6.1.2. to request a CSD
  waiver) or request withdrawal or deferment. The WS/CO may disenroll individuals reporting
  to the WS who do not meet minimum requisites and do not have a waiver. All CSD Waivers
  (i.e. Course Entry Waivers) will be submitted to ACC/A3TW IAW USAFWS
  Announcement Message, and will be staffed for ACC/A3 approval.
  5.5.3. Withdrawal, alternate activation, and deferment. HQ ACC/A3T is the approval
  authority for AD nominee/select withdrawal prior to CSD and for alternate activation. HQ
  ACC/A3 is the final approval authority for all deferment (grandfathering) actions. WIC
  candidates may need to withdraw from WIC consideration/selection, or be deferred
  (grandfathered) to a subsequent class. Withdrawal for humanitarian or operational necessity
  (due to personal or family medical conditions, real world operations, changes in available
  WS resources, etc.) will normally be considered “without prejudice,” and the candidate will
  be allowed to re-compete for any subsequent WIC for which the candidate remains qualified.
  Withdrawal for no apparent humanitarian or operational justification shall be considered
  “with prejudice,” and the candidate shall generally not be welcome to compete at any
  subsequent WIC selection board (e.g. elimination from WIC). This includes self-initiated
  elimination (SIE) after CSD. SIE is processed IAW applicable USAFWS Operating
  Instructions (OI). Because of the time sensitivity inherent in activating available alternates,
  the WIC select’s WG/CC (or equivalent) shall coordinate withdrawal requests prior to CSD
  and directly with HQ ACC/A3T (via HQ ACC/A3TW), with a courtesy copy to the
  appropriate MAJCOM weapons shop. HQ ACC/A3TW will notify the WS and HQ AFPC to
  coordinate alternate notification (if required). Units must inform HQ ACC as soon as
  practical if a primary select might not attend WIC; do not wait until it is absolutely certain
  the select will not attend WS. Without sufficient notification, alternate selects may not be
  able to adequately prepare and the training slot may go unfilled.
     5.5.3.1. Withdrawal before selection. Nominees withdrawing their nomination packages
     before the WIC selection board meets shall notify their WG/CC (or equivalent) with the
     details and reasoning for their withdrawal. The nominating WG/CC will in turn notify
     HQ ACC/A3TW of the withdrawal and should include comments on whether the WIC
20                                                            AFI11-415 15 OCTOBER 2014


     applicant should be considered with/without prejudice for the withdrawal. HQ
     ACC/A3TW shall prepare the appropriate withdrawal memo for HQ ACC/A3T release
     back to the nominee’s WG/CC. If the withdrawal is outside ACC, ACC/A3TW will
     notify the MAJCOM weapons shop of the withdrawal.
     5.5.3.2. Withdrawal after selection (before selection message release from AFPC). WIC
     selects withdrawing their names after selection, but before AFPC has released the official
     WIC selection results message, will require a memorandum from the nominating WG/CC
     to HQ ACC/A3T. HQ ACC/A3T shall make the with/without prejudice determination
     and notify HQ AFPC/DPALT3 and the USAFWS/CO. If the withdrawal is outside ACC,
     ACC/A3TW will notify the MAJCOM weapons shop of the withdrawal. HQ
     ACC/A3TW shall coordinate with HQ AFPC/DPALT3 and the USAFWS/CO to re-order
     the remaining selects and alternates for the affected WIC before releasing the message.
     Nominally, the first alternate shall become a “primary select” and any remaining
     alternates will move up in the queue (see paragraph 5.5.3.5, below).
     5.5.3.3. Withdrawal after selection (after selection message release from AFPC). WIC
     selects withdrawing their names after AFPC has released the official WIC selection
     results message will require a memorandum from the nominating WG/CC to HQ
     ACC/A3T. If appropriate (see paragraph 5.5.3), the nominating WG/CC should request
     deferment (grandfather) for the select at the time of the withdrawal request. HQ
     ACC/A3T shall coordinate the withdrawal and any required alternate activation actions
     immediately (see paragraphs 5.5.3.5 and 5.5.3.6, below) and follow up with any required
     deferment coordination, once all required alternate activation coordination is complete.
     5.5.3.4. Withdrawal for simultaneous competitive board selection. In cases where a
     nominee is selected for both WIC and another board selection program (including, but
     not limited to, Undergraduate Flying Training (UFT), cross-training Formal Training
     Unit (FTU), USAF Air Demonstration Squadron, USAF Aggressors, Test Pilot School,
     Astronaut School, professional fellowships, etc.), the select must choose one program
     over the other. It is not possible for a candidate to pay back the required minimum time in
     weapons officer duty while enrolled in a demanding program outside the primary MDS
     or combat capability. It is the select’s responsibility to notify HQ ACC/A3TW and their
     respective MAJCOM weapons shop, through the chain of command, which program he
     or she will attend at the earliest possible time, to allow for activating any available WIC
     alternates. If the multi-selected candidate fails to identify a preferred program choice, HQ
     AFPC/DPALT3 shall notify the applicable wing commander (or equivalent) and HQ
     ACC/A3TW of the dual-selected officer’s status and solicit a final attendance decision. If
     the select fails to respond or coordinate a program decision, HQ ACC/A3TW shall
     initiate a withdrawal request to HQ ACC/A3T and the USAFWS Commandant, with a
     courtesy copy to the MAJCOM weapons shop, to remove the WIC select from the
     incoming class and activate any viable alternate.
     5.5.3.5. Alternate activation. When a WIC select is withdrawn and a selection board-
     designated alternate is available, HQ ACC/A3TW shall coordinate with HQ
     AFPC/DPALT3 and the USAFWS/CO to activate that alternate and notify all concerned
     parties. If there is more than one designated alternate for a specific WIC, the remaining
     alternate(s) moves up in priority. If the USAFWS can accommodate more students than
AFI11-415 15 OCTOBER 2014                                                                      21


     selected at the central board, the USAFWS/CO may request HQ ACC/A3T to activate
     WIC alternates.
     5.5.3.6. Deferment (grandfathering). HQ ACC/A3 is the final approval authority for all
     "grandfathering" decisions. Simply stated, an approved deferment (grandfather) allows
     WIC candidates to withdraw from the class for which they were selected and attend the
     following WIC, without re-competing at the WS selection board. Generally, deferment
     requests will follow one of two tracks: prior to CSD, from the nominating wing
     commander to HQ ACC/A3, or, after CSD (while student is enrolled in WIC), from the
     USAFWS Commandant, through the 57 WG/CC, to HQ ACC/A3. Any deferment request
     that will result in the individual requiring a selection board waiver for the selection board
     class that they are requesting deferment into may be disapproved based on the fact that
     deferment request will necessitate a selection board waiver. Instead, individuals may be
     withdrawn from their selected WIC class without prejudice and allowed to compete at
     future WIC selection boards. Deferment requests are handled on a case by case basis.
     Because of the time sensitivity inherent in activating available alternates, deferment
     requests shall be coordinated directly with HQ ACC/A3 (via HQ ACC/A3TW), with a
     courtesy copy to the appropriate MAJCOM weapons shop. Expect deferred selects to
     decrement available training allocation selections for the next WIC selection board. (T-
     1)
        5.5.3.6.1. Prior to CSD. For deferments prior to CSD, the nominating wing
        commander shall send an electronic request to HQ ACC/A3 (via HQ ACC/A3TW),
        with a courtesy copy to the applicable MAJCOM A3. The request should outline
        justification for deferment with adequate detail pertaining to the particular
        situation/condition warranting deferment. Common reasons justifying deferrals prior
        to CSD include, but are not limited to, illness, injury, family emergency or
        operational requirements (e.g. deployment).
        5.5.3.6.2. If the WS cannot support the number of students selected because of a
        change in resources (available aircraft, munitions, instructors, etc.), the appropriate
        Weapons Squadron (WPS) commander may request, through the USAFWS/CO and
        57 WG/CC, to defer one or more students to a subsequent class. The WS
        Commandant’s formal deferral request, through the 57 WG, will be staffed by HQ
        ACC/A3TW for HQ ACC/A3 approval.
        5.5.3.6.3. After CSD. Once a student is enrolled in WIC, the appropriate WPS/CC
        may request elimination (including SIE) or deferment approval through the
        USAFWS/CO and 57 WG/CC IAW applicable WS OIs. When the commander
        judges the student is not satisfactorily progressing in syllabus objectives and does not
        warrant deferment, the commander will recommend elimination. In such a case
        where an AFRC or ANG member is eliminated from training, AFRC/A3T or
        ACC/A3G will be immediately notified. Students eliminated for failure to
        satisfactorily progress in the syllabus will not be welcome to compete at any future
        WIC selection boards. When the commander judges the student is doing well enough
        in the course to merit return in a subsequent class without re-competing at the WS
        selection board, deferment is recommended.               Common reasons justifying
        “grandfathering” after CSD include, but are not limited to: illness, injury, family
        emergency, or unplanned changes in WS resources. USAFWS/CO, in coordination
 22                                                            AFI11-415 15 OCTOBER 2014


          with respective WPS/CC, will determine at what point the deferred student may
          return in the next WIC class. This decision will be based on student availability to
          return, student performance prior to deferment, MDS mission, syllabus turbulence
          and requirements at a minimum.
   5.5.4. If WS selects are unable to complete all syllabus requirements by the established class
   graduation date, graduation waivers must be submitted and approved to successfully
   complete the class. HQ ACC/A3 is the final approval authority for all "graduation" waivers.
5.6. Waivers.
   5.6.1. Types of WS waivers. There are three broad waiver categories within the WS
   program: selection board, course start date (CSD), and end of course (graduation) waivers.
   Selection board and CSD waiver requests must be submitted through applicant’s wing
   commander (or equivalent) to HQ ACC/A3 (via ACC/A3TW), with a courtesy copy to
   respective MAJCOM weapons shop (if other than ACC). The USAFWS/CO shall submit
   end of course waivers to HQ ACC/A3, via the 57 WG. HQ ACC/A3 is the final waiver
   approval authority. (T-1)
      5.6.1.1. Selection Board Waivers. Selection board waivers include Total Active Federal
      Commissioned Service Date (TAFCSD), rank, minimum MDS/specialty experience,
      instructor qualification date, and total hours in PAA, as defined by MDS/specialty criteria
      in the nomination message. Waiver requests for individuals exceeding the TAFCSD time
      are evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Selection Board Waivers for rank or TAFCSD
      requirements are N/A for ARC nominees. Nominees requiring a waiver to meet the
      selection board must submit a waiver letter through their wing commander (or
      equivalent) to HQ ACC/A3TW, and courtesy copy their respective MAJCOM weapons
      and tactics shop. Include the following information: 1) specific reason for waiver request,
      2) justification for waiver, and 3) plan to mitigate shortfall, either before CSD or for
      graduate assignment management. Approval of these waiver requests by ACC/A3 does
      not guarantee selection at the board, only that the nominee will be allowed to compete for
      selection. Address waiver requests to HQ ACC/A3 and forward, along with the
      nomination package, to HQ ACC/A3TW. See paragraph 5.6.1.4 for the waiver staffing
      process. An example of the waiver request letter is located on the HQ ACC/A3TW
      SharePoint                                                                            site:
      https://cs.eis.af.mil/weptac/Wpnschool/Sample%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx
      5.6.1.2. CSD waivers. CSD waivers are for requirements that must be met by WIC
      selects prior to course start date. Do not submit these waivers for the selection board.
      These requirements include CMR/BMC look-back and landing currency, as well as
      instructor hours as defined by MDS/specialty in the USAFWS Announcement Message.
      The USAFWS/CO may disenroll individuals reporting to the WS who do not meet
      minimum requirements and do not have an approved CSD waiver. CSD waivers are due
      to HQ ACC/A3TW NLT 14 days prior to CSD.
          5.6.1.2.1. WPS/CCs shall collect flying records (or equivalent) on the first day of the
          course and verify each student meets course entry requirements. If the WPS/CC finds
          discrepancies, the USAFWS/CO shall determine whether to disenroll affected
          students or forward a Post-CSD waiver request to HQ ACC/A3TW, NLT 7 duty days
          after CSD.
AFI11-415 15 OCTOBER 2014                                                                    23


        5.6.1.2.2. Upon notification from the USAFWS/CO, HQ ACC/A3TW will staff AD
        waiver request(s) to HQ ACC/A3, with a targeted approval date for all waiver
        requests before the end of Core 1 academics. Students may not fly/perform syllabus
        events until HQ ACC/A3 approves the waiver or the CSD shortfall is corrected under
        instructor supervision (e.g. WIC IP supervises student landing currency sortie).
     5.6.1.3. Graduation Waivers. If WIC students are unable to complete all syllabus
     requirements by the established class graduation date, the USAFWS/CO shall prepare a
     consolidated “graduation” requirement waiver request NLT 21 days prior to graduation
     for ACC/A3 approval. The waiver request will include both syllabus requirements not
     currently met, and those not projected to be met, by graduation. Details will include any
     extenuating circumstances as well as an assessment of CAF/MAF/SOF impact for not
     meeting the syllabus requirements. Failure to submit waiver requests in a timely manner
     may result in students not being allowed to graduate on time.
     5.6.1.4. Waiver Staffing Process. Wing commander (or equivalent) will address all
     selection board and CSD waiver requests through the WIC-owning MAJCOM (AFGSC
     for 315th, 325th, and 340th WPS; AFSOC for 14th WPS; AFSPC for 328th WPS; AMC
     for 29th, 57th, and 509th WPS, ACC for 8th, 16th, 17th, 19th, 26th, 34th, 66th, 77th, and
     433rd WPS) for formal MAJCOM/A3 coordination via the MAJCOM OPR as listed in
     paragraph 6.1 below. Submit requests IAW the timelines outlined in the WIC selection
     message. The MAJCOM OPR will be responsible for all internal MAJCOM staffing
     requirements and will submit to ACC/A3TW a finalized MAJCOM/A3-coordinated
     waiver IAW the WIC selection message timelines. Upon receiving a MAJCOM/A3-
     coordinated waiver list, ACC/A3TW will route all waivers to ACC/A3 for coordination
     and consolidated dissemination via formal message traffic.
     5.6.1.5. Waiver Considerations. MAJCOM/A3s should generally NOT recommend
     approval for waivers when there are enough fully qualified applicants available to fill the
     expected board vacancy and alternate positions. MAJCOM/A3s should carefully
     consider all TAFSCD waivers to ensure that normal career progression/timing will not be
     negatively impacted by the AFI 11-415 required three year continuous weapons officer
     duty payback for approved TAFCSD waiver applicants. MAJCOM weapons and tactics
     staff elements should discuss all waiver requests with the impacted WPS/CC prior to
     staffing to the MAJCOM/A3 for coordination. (T-1)

                                            Chapter 6

                   WEAPONS SCHOOL GRADUATE MANAGEMENT

6.1. Purpose. This chapter establishes HQ ACC/A3TW as the CAF WS graduate management
OPR and provides CAF WS graduate utilization and tier guidance. HQ AFGSC/A3TW is the B-
2/B-52/ICBM graduate management OPR. AFSOAWC/A9T is the SOF graduate management
OPR. HQ AFSPC/A3TW is the Space and Cyber Warfare graduate management OPR. HQ
AMC/A3DT is the MAF graduate management OPR. AFISRA/A3TW is the Intelligence
Weapons Instructor Course (IWIC)/Intelligence Sensor Weapons Instructor Course (ISWIC)
graduate management OPR for graduates assigned to their subordinate units. This chapter
provides specific guidance on WS graduate utilization and establishes W-prefix manning levels.
HQ ACC/A3TW, HQ AFGSC/A3TW, AFSOAWC/A9T, HQ USAFE/A3TW, HQ
PACAF/A2OK, HQ AETC/A3ZF, HQ AFSPC/A3TW, HQ AMC/A3DT, and AFISRA/A3TW
will coordinate with applicable Air Staff, MAJCOM, and AFPC agencies on all W-prefix
manpower actions, to ensure requirements reflect adequate justification for assignment of the W-
prefix. ANG and AFRC WS graduate management, utilization and related policies are the
responsibility of NGB/A3 for ANG units and HQ AFRC/A3T for AFRC units respectively. (T-1)
6.2. USAFWS Graduate Patch/Badge/Insignia. USAFWS Graduate Patch/Badge/Insignia
will be worn as follows:
   6.2.1. On the left shoulder of flight suit or on the left breast pocket of ABUs.
   6.2.2. By graduates of USAFWS, USAF Fighter Weapons School (FWS), or MAF Weapons
   School.
   6.2.3. By current and previous USAFWS instructor cadre.
   6.2.4. The bold black bordered USAFWS Graduate Patch designates the graduate as a
   current or previous FWS or USAFWS instructor and is only authorized for wear by those
   graduates who have been assigned as a FWS or USAFWS instructor.
6.3. W-prefix Management. HQ ACC/A3TW will convene a W-prefix Management
Conference prior to WS selection boards. The following are the objectives of the conference: 1)
discuss USAF W-prefix needs and evaluate WS production capability, 2) validate weapons
officer billets and scrub current W-prefix billet requirements list, 3) evaluate additional ARC
requirements or ARC candidate shortfalls, per paragraph 6.4, and 4) discuss issues relevant to
weapons officers and the Weapons Officer Program. Conference attendees will include
representatives from USAFWS, AFPC, AFRC, ANG, and all MAJCOMs. The intent is for WS
graduates to be assigned throughout the Total Force, based upon guidance in this document
consistent with the rated prioritization plan. The conference will be held in conjunction with each
WS selection board. (T-1)
6.4. Weapons School Manning. AFPC will attempt to man each squadron at 100 percent. WS
instructor billets are typically long-lead assignments and AFPC will attempt to overlap PCS
orders when feasible. This overlap will help ease WPS instructor cadre transition. Failure to
properly man each squadron with fully qualified instructors and mission planning personnel may
result in graduate production lower than Air Force requirements. The WS/CO, WPS/CCs, AFPC,
and other responsible MAJCOMs will coordinate instructor assignments. (T-1)
AFI11-415 15 OCTOBER 2014                                                                          25


6.5. W-prefix Utilization. Comply with the following WS graduate utilization directives.
   6.5.1. Following WS attendance, WIC graduates shall incur an ADSC in accordance with
   AFI 36-2107. AFRC graduates will incur a similar commitment as outlined in AFRCI 36-
   2102. Additionally, graduates who remain on active duty shall serve in a weapons officer
   position for a total of 5 years, with a minimum of 3 years continuous initial service.
   Graduate utilization within the initial 3 years from date of graduation shall be in a valid W-
   prefix billet normally assigned at the operational squadron level unless selected for
   DO/CC/IDE. Removing WIC graduates from their primary MDS within the initial 3 year
   period (e.g. for MAJCOM/NAF Exec/CAG, etc.) requires MAJCOM/A3 approval (with
   courtesy copy to ACC/A3TW). MAJCOM/A3 approval is required to ensure graduates
   remain tacticians in their primary MDS and to ensure the USAF gains the appropriate return
   on investment for the specialized training received IAW the Tier System (described below)
   and the intent of this paragraph. (T-1)
   6.5.2. Tier System. Weapons officer positions shall be categorized within a three-tier system,
   to denote desired experience level for each billet (see Table 2, Table 3, and Table 4).
   Individual billets shall further be prioritized, independent of Tier level, to optimize use of
   available weapons officers. Separately, a weapons officer position’s priority denotes when a
   billet should be filled in relation to other billets. It is possible to have a high priority Tier 2
   billet filled before a lower priority Tier 1 billet.
       6.5.2.1. Tier 1 positions are normally filled by first assignment weapons officers. Tier 1
       indicates responsibilities commensurate with a captain or junior major and will normally
       reside in an operational squadron (operations support squadron (OSS) for some
       intelligence weapons and ICBM officers). Tier 1, Priority 1 units are defined as those
       units that directly support warfighting units or organizations. Tier 1 jobs include fighter,
       bomber, rescue, air control, reconnaissance, air refueling, intelligence, airlift, information
       operations, space, missile, CWO, and SOF squadrons (and operations support squadrons
       for some intelligence weapons officers) that support AEF-tasked warfighting wings.
       Although Tier 1 assignments denote an experience level of a first assignment weapons
       officer, priority positions can be filled by second assignment weapons officers as
       required.
       6.5.2.2. Tier 2 positions indicate responsibilities commensurate with a senior captain or
       field grade officer and are normally filled by second assignment weapons officers. Tier 2
       billets are normally associated with operations support squadrons (except for intelligence
       and ICBM), USAF Weapons School, or test. Although Tier 2 assignments denote an
       experience level of a second assignment weapons officer, priority positions may be filled
       by exception with first assignment weapons officers.
       6.5.2.3. Tier 3 positions are normally filled by graduates with more than 5 years of W-
       prefix experience and indicate responsibility commensurate with a field grade officer. An
       individual can be considered a Tier-3 weapons officer once he or she completes the 5
       year payback. A Tier-2 weapons officer can fill a Tier-3 position if there is no one who
       meets the payback criteria. Conversely, a Tier-3 weapons officer could fill a Tier-2
       position, if the individual is the only graduate available. Tier 3 assignments include
       MAJCOM staff, HQ AF staff, Joint staff, and Warfighting NAFs with Falconer AOCs.
       Tier 3 billets may also be filled by field grade weapons officers that have not fulfilled 5
26                                                             AFI11-415 15 OCTOBER 2014


     years of “W” service. Tier 3 billets are not tracked by MAJCOM. Aviation Change
     Requests (ACR) may be submitted to remove the W-prefix from Tier 3 billets if W
     experience is desired, but not required. Officers eligible for these positions will have
     served 3 years of Tier 1 and 2 years of Tier 2.
  6.5.3. New AD graduates should expect a 3-year assignment to a Tier 1 unit immediately
  following graduation from the USAFWS. Graduates PCS’ing prior to completing their 3-year
  payback window should expect assignment to a Tier commensurate with rank and a priority
  commensurate with USAF weapons officer manning, until the 3-year payback is complete.
  Following completion of the initial 3-year Tier 1 assignment, graduates can expect
  assignment to a Tier 2 or Tier 3 position. As a rule of thumb, graduates should not expect
  assignment to a Tier 3 position until completing tours in Tier 1 and Tier 2 assignments,
  unless required by the needs of the USAF. New ANG and AFRC graduates should expect a
  3-year assignment to a Tier 1 unit immediately following graduation from the USAFWS.
  6.5.4. Billets will be prioritized from one (highest) to three (lowest). Priority One billets are
  required to support warfighting organizations and should be filled before all others. Priority
  Two billets are highly desired positions to support critical components of the mission, while
  Priority Three billets are desired positions to enhance combat capability once higher priority
  billets have been filled. Unit commanders should utilize their weapons officers in their
  weapons and tactics shops, but may assign weapons officers to any duties as required by unit
  needs IAW paragraph 6.5.1. Commanders should not expect AFPC to backfill vacant “W”
  billets as long as the weapons officer placed against that billet remains in that unit or if the
  WO is moved prior to the initial 3-year Tier 1 payback (e.g. moved to WG/CC exec). (T-1)
  6.5.5. AFPC will assign AD weapons officers to units by using criteria depicted in Table 2
  (below). Billet priorities shall be assigned by the MAJCOM weapons shop, in coordination
  with individual units and other MAJCOM directorate FAMs. AFPC shall use billet priorities,
  in conjunction with desired experience level (Tier), to place weapons officers on assignment.
  Assignment priorities do not dictate that AFPC or commanders fill W-prefix billets to the
  detriment of professional development, unit need, or Air Force requirements. Before
  assigning weapons officers outside of defined priorities, AFPC and unit commanders should
  consider the impact to CAF/MAF/SOF combat capability and the utilization of a scarce
  resource. (T-1)
  6.5.6. The W-Prefix Management FAM is HQ ACC/A3TW, HQ AFSPC/A3TW for Space
  and Cyber weapons officers, HQ AFGSC/A3TW for B-2/B-52/ICBM weapons officers,
  AFSOAWC/A9 for SOF weapons officers, HQ, AFRC/A3T for AFRC weapons officers, HQ
  AMC/A3D for MAF weapons officers, and AFISRA/A3TW for IWIC/ISWIC weapons
  officers assigned to subordinate units. FAMs will provide AFPC prioritization guidance,
  anticipated personnel moves, and other factors bearing on mission priorities, when conflicts
  among competing Tier requirements arise. For example, it could be possible to fill a Tier
  2/Priority 1 billet with a Tier 3 graduate, when all/most of the Tier 3/Priority 1 billets are
  filled. Assigning a Tier 1 or Tier 2 graduate to a Tier 3 position shall require W-Prefix
  Management FAM coordination before taking final assignment actions. The FAM will work
  closely with AFPC and the WPS/CCs to determine WO placement.

    6.5.7. (KC-135, C-17, C-130 graduates only) HQ AMC/DPAD, HQ AMC/A3DT and
    AFPC will return graduates to the providing unit for 1 year ‘payback,’ when able. This policy
    will not be used as a means of extending personnel time on station.

         manning standards, will be brought into compliance by appropriate MAJCOM weapons
         shop and manpower offices by the following W-prefix Management Conference. Table
         5 lists the minimum number of W-prefix billets a unit will have, although additional
         billets may be authorized. Refer to MAJCOM tactics instructions for additional manning
         guidance. ACRs must be coordinated through MAJCOM/A3T with a copy sent to

   6.6.2. Other Units:
        6.6.2.1. Intelligence. IWIC and ISWIC graduates are assigned to a list of prioritized OSS
        Intelligence flight or W-prefix billets per Table 4, Intelligence Weapons Officer
        Tier/Priority Matrix. Intelligence Sensor Weapons Instructor Course (ISWIC) graduates
        are assigned to a list of prioritized Intelligence Squadron, IOS, or OSS W-prefix billets
        per Table 4, Intelligence Weapons Officer Tier/Priority Matrix. ACC/A3TW,
        AFISRA/A3TW, and AFPC will manage the list IAW priorities established during the
        W-prefix conference. After the initial Tier 1 assignment, and prior to completing the 5-
        year Weapons School graduation commitment, IWIC and ISWIC graduates fill vacant
        Tier 2 "Grad-Plus" billets.
        6.6.2.2. Space and Cyber. Space and Cyber WIC graduates are assigned to primarily
        support the integration of tactics development at operational space or cyber units.
        Graduates are assigned IAW Table 3 and the AFSPC/A3-approved billet plan, which
        expands on Table 3 and identifies space weapons officer billets force-wide. Changes to
        the AFSPC/A3-approved billet plan must be coordinated through the appropriate
        MAJCOM/A3TW office.
        6.6.2.3. ICBM. ICBM WIC graduates are primarily assigned to support Missile Wings
        to improve wing integration and proficiency of crew members. Graduates are assigned
        IAW Table 2 and the AFGSC/A3-approved billet plan, which expands on Table 2 and
        identifies ICBM weapons officer billets force-wide. Changes to the AFGSC/A3-
        approved billet plan must be coordinated through AFGSC/A3TW.
   6.6.3. HQ ACC/A3TW, AFGSC/3TW, ACC/A3GW, AFRC/A3TT AFSOAWC/A9T
   AFSPC/A3TW, AMC/A3DT, and AFISRA/A3TW maintain all applicable W-prefix priority
   lists. These lists are produced and updated at the W-prefix Management conference. To be
   considered for the priority list, units must submit their request to their designated MAJCOM
   lead with justification for the priority.
   6.6.4. Additional Authorizations. The above W-prefix authorizations are IAW WS graduate
   production capacity. However, these manning levels do not preclude additional W-prefixes

   or special W-prefix authorizations (such as an EWO, Space, Missile, and Intel), if unit
   tasking dictates. ACC/A3TW must be notified before any W-prefix billet modifications are
   made.
6.7. Weapons School Responsibilities. NLT 30 days after graduation, the WS registrar,
through the WS/CO, will update OTA and forward the name and rank of each WS graduate to
AFPC/DPAO, HQ ACC/A3TW, HQ ACC/A1M, AFGSC/A3TW, AFSOAWC/A9T , HQ
AFSOC/DP, HQ AFSPC/A3TW, HQ AFSPC/A1, HQ AFRC/A3T and others as applicable.

                      PROCEDURES TO ESTABLISH A NEW WIC

A4.1. General. Refer to Chapter 4 of this document for guidance on establishing a new WIC.
For proposed new WICs, this attachment will further outline required approval authority,
USAFWS entry standard, weapons officer utilization, supportability requirements, and command
and control requirements for proposed WICs. It will then outline the staffing process for
proposed WICs, standard timeline, and current relevant issues and related problem areas.
NOTE: The entire process to create a WIC can take as long as 5 years.
A4.2. Approval authority. Any proposal to establish a new WIC must be approved by the
CSAF. The Program Element Manager (PEM) and Functional Area Manager (FAM) of the
MAJCOM owning the weapons system and Service Core Function (SCF) seeking to establish a
WIC begins the process by presenting a written CONOPs to the USAFWC. A well thought out
and written CONOPs is the cornerstone of the proposed WIC and must address the following
areas.
   A4.2.1. USAFWS entry standard.
       A4.2.1.1. Mission requirement: Every proposed WIC must conduct the preponderance
       of its mission in one or more of the SCFs: Air Superiority, Space Superiority,
       Cyberspace Superiority, Special Operations, Global Precision Attack, Global Integrated
       ISR, Rapid Global Mobility, Command and Control, Personnel Recovery, and/or Nuclear
       Deterrence Operations.
       A4.2.1.2. Weapons officer utilization. Address these areas in detail in the CONOPs:
          A4.2.1.2.1. Undergraduate career path: Outline in detail the career path an officer
          will take from entry into the weapons system or combat capability that will lead to
          entry in the proposed WIC.
          A4.2.1.2.2. WIC entry requirements: Outline in detail the desired criteria for officers
          to enter training in the proposed WIC. Comply with the guidelines in para 5.3 of this
          document.
          A4.2.1.2.3. CAF “W-prefix” manpower requirements and graduate utilization plan:
          Analyze in detail the projected requirement for W-prefix manpower authorizations
          across the CAF. See Table 6.4. “W-prefix Manning Standards” for guidance.
          Provide suggested prioritization of requested authorizations IAW paragraph 7.5 and
          Table 6.1, 6.2, and/or 6.3.
       A4.2.1.3. Syllabus requirements: Create a detailed draft WIC syllabus. All current
       USAFWS       syllabi   can    be   found    on     the   ACC     TRSS    Website:
       https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/docman/DOCMain.asp?Tab=0&FolderID=OO-ED-
       AC-02-15&Filter=OO-ED-AC-02.
       A4.2.1.4. Graduate requirement: Based on the manpower analysis and graduate
       utilization plan, analyze the annual graduate production requirement from the proposed
       WIC. Use a 2-year refresh rate for planning purposes IAW paragraph 6.5.1.
 44                                                            AFI11-415 15 OCTOBER 2014


      A4.2.1.5. WIC support plan: Define the number of WIC instructors and other support
      personnel needed to support the proposed graduate requirement. Instructor-to-student
      ratio is not strictly defined; however, 1.5:1 is a good rule of thumb. Any ratio higher than
      2:1 is unsupportable.
   A4.2.2. Supportability requirements. Failure to identify specific sources of required support
   renders the CONOPs invalid and unsupportable. Additionally, stating that the USAFWS will
   fund a proposed WIC “out of hide” until the owning PEM/FAM can include the requirement
   in the next POM cycle is not acceptable. Such CONOPs will not be staffed forward by
   ACC/A3TW and will be returned to the originator to address the shortfalls. Address these
   areas in detail in the CONOPs:
      A4.2.2.1. Manpower support: Identify in detail active-duty, civilian, and contractor
      manpower requirements. Identify which specific organizations/functions will transfer
      manpower authorizations (by manpower UMD position number) to HQ ACC/57
      WG/USAFWS to support the proposed WIC. If adequate manpower is not identified and
      secured, CONOPS coordination will not begin.
      A4.2.2.2. Funding support: Estimate in detail the O&M, adversary air support, range
      support, and contract (typically courseware development and sustainment under the
      current USAFWS contract) support costs required to operate the proposed WIC. Identify
      in detail (by Program Element Code) what organizations/functions will provide funding
      to stand up and sustain the proposed WIC throughout its life. If adequate resources are
      not identified and secured, CONOP coordination will not begin.
      A4.2.2.3. Aircraft support: Identify specific TF-coded aircraft (to include a sustainment
      funding line) to be transferred to the 57 WG/USAFWS or provide properly staffed/signed
      memoranda or agreement clearly defining how host MAJCOMs/Wings will support the
      proposed WIC with aircraft/flying hours/range time and any other syllabus-required
      resources.
      A4.2.2.4. Facilities support: Identify in detail (by base and facility building number) the
      operations, training, and maintenance facilities required to support the proposed WIC. If
      none exist, provide estimated MILCON requirements (in this case, include estimated cost
      of any required temporary facilities needed while awaiting completion of MILCON if
      proposed WIC is approved for execution). If the CSAF approves the CONOPs and
      directs the WIC be created, coordinate for a SATAF. ACC/A5B will conduct all Site
      Activation Task Forces (SATAFs) for new WICs.
   A4.2.3. Command and control requirements. All USAFWS squadrons will be under the
   command of the Commandant, and will report through the 57th Wing and the USAF Warfare
   Center to HQ ACC.
A4.3. Staffing process. The PEM/FAM of the MAJCOM owning the weapons system or
mission area seeking to establish a WIC begins the process by presenting a written CONOPs,
prepared as outlined in this document, to the United States Air Force Warfare Center
(USAFWC). Once USAFWC determines that the proposed WIC meets the entry standard, the
proposal will be staffed as an organizational change request (OCR) from the sponsoring
MAJCOM PEM/FAM to ACC.
AFI11-415 15 OCTOBER 2014                                                                    45


   A4.3.1. ACC/A3TW is the ACC staff point of entry and advocate for all ACC staff actions
   related to the proposed new WIC. ACC/A3TW will review the OCR and proposed syllabus
   for proper coordination and will seek ACC/A3 endorsement. Contact ACC/A3TW for a
   copy of a recently approved WIC CONOPS.
   A4.3.2. ACC/A3TW will forward the ACC/A3-endorsed OCR to ACC/A1M (Manpower
   and Organization) and ACC/A5P (Programs).
       A4.3.2.1. These organizations will seek Air Staff approval for proposed organizational
       structure, manpower and logistics requirements, funding requirements, and will
       coordinate for any required environmental impact or other studies.
   A4.3.3. Once the OCR is approved, ACC/A3TW, A1M, and A5P will coordinate with
   ACC/FM to execute funding, manpower, and logistics support. Once all listed actions are
   complete, ACC/A3TW will submit the completed package (through A3 and COMACC) to
   the CSAF for approval.
A4.4. Planning timeline. As noted in the opening paragraph of the attachment, the entire
process outlined above can take from 3 to 5 years to complete. As the POM budget cycle is two
years, it is desirable to begin the process of seeking CSAF approval for a new WIC at least two
and a half years prior to desired execution.
   A4.4.1. Coordination to complete an executable CONOPs, staffing the resulting OCR, and
   gaining ACC/A3 endorsement typically requires two years. It is not uncommon for draft
   documents to require more than one revision before an approval can be obtained.
   A4.4.2. If MILCON is required, the request must be submitted to Congress. Standard
   timeline for such a request from submission to execution is five years.
A4.5. Common WIC request problem areas and trends.
   A4.5.1. Incomplete CONOP. Proposed CONOP does not convey the detail to evaluate the
   graduate utilization and management, sustainment requirements, or funding. Proper attention
   to creating a high-quality CONOPs will significantly ease the process and improve the
   likelihood of success. Staff actions will stop for any CONOPS submitted that does not
   convey a well thought out and resourced proposal. “Out of hide” and “Time share” proposed
   solutions to manpower or funding issues does not satisfy the test for the identification of
   adequate and sustainable resources; consequently, coordination will cease and the CONOPS
   returned.
   A4.5.2. There has been an alarming trend recently in the quality and rigor of proposed WIC
   syllabi. The CSAF stated in July 2006 that “We will not accept an FTU-level course…” as a
   Weapons School course of instruction. This has led to ACC/A3TW nonconcurrence on
   proposed syllabi which adds additional time to the staffing process.
   A4.5.3. There has also been an alarming trend recently as parties with an agenda try to force
   the creation of new WICs by shortcutting the process in an attempt to meet a perceived need.
   Our historical data reflects that WICs that were created in an expedited manner did not fully
   consider all CONOP aspects and have thus suffered by not having adequate funding,
   adversary support, sustainment, and other WIC shortfalls.
