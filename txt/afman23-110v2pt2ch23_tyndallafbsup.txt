23.24.2.2. The organization commander or designated representative may use Tyndall AFB
Form 18, Request for Issue of Individual Equipment/Clothing.
23.26.1.3. Returnable NF1 items stored in Mobility Bags are placed under inventory control
using the Mobility Inventory Control and Accounting System (MICAS).
23.26.3.3. TAFB Form 18, Request for Issue of Individual Equipment/Clothing, is used to
backorder items in the IE System. Backordered items are entered into a backorder log.
23.27.1.3. The backorder log is used for customer notification.
23.27.2.8. IEE advises the Customer Service Document Control function of DOR items not
picked up by the customer. IEE processes the turn-in using the original DOR document number.
The DOR will be moved to history with the reason the item was not picked up by the customer
and cross-referenced to the transaction register number of the turn-in.
23.28.2.1. The automated IEE system produces a receipt document in triplicate at IEE checkout.
The customer signs the receipt document for all issued and backordered items. The original
signature copy is forwarded to the Customer Service Document Control function. The remaining
copies are distributed as one copy to the customer and the other filed in suspense to validate
transaction processing. The Daily Retail Sales Transaction Listing, Discoverer report is
reviewed daily to ensure issue and due-out documents have processed. Once transactions are
verified as processed, the suspense copy of the receipt document may be destroyed.
23.31.3.4. The Customer Service Equipment Accountability Office is the one-stop out
processing function to clear outgoing personnel via Virtual MPF.
