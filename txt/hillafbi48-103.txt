inflicted.
Owners of pets are encouraged to maintain additional liability insurance in the event that their
animal bites another person or animal.

Control of Pets
Pets will not be permitted to run loose. A Pet Citation may be issued or the privilege of having a pet may
be revoked if a resident or guest routinely violates the leash law. When pets (to include cats) are not
penned, they will be leashed at all times. Dogs will not be chained outdoors and left unattended at any
time. Dogs may be left in fenced-in yards for short periods of time with proper food, water, and shelter.
Dogs may not be left unattended unless confined indoors, outdoors in a securely enclosed and locked
pen, or other approved structure designed to completely restrain the animal. The BHMH Leasing Office,
or a representative of the BHMH Leasing Office, will determine if the structure used to restrain the animal
is sufficient. Anytime a dog is outside the above confined secured areas, it must, at all times, be securely
leashed and under the control of the owner or his/her representative. Dog houses are allowed in yards
