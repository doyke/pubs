     Episode Plan available on the Air Quality website.
     3.16.2. The UDAQ Air Pollution Officer will notify the Director of Environmental
     Management of any Emergency Air Episodes. 75 CEG/CEIEA Air Quality will in turn
     notify the affected Industrial Organization UEC/ER with a courtesy copy to the CEM.
  3.17. Start-up, Shutdown and Malfunction Planning.
     3.17.1. Source Start-up, Shutdown, and Malfunction Plans (SSMPs) must be developed,
     maintained and followed by Industrial Organizations as required by 40 CFR 63.
     3.17.2. Hill AFB requires that an SSMP be written and incorporated into the site book of
     Aerospace National Emissions Standard for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) paint
     booths utilizing a control other than a dry filter system (e.g. a waterfall control for
     inorganic hazardous air pollutants).
     3.17.3. New NESHAP sources may require an SSMP based on pollution control system
     utilized as dictated by the specific NESHAP. 75 CEG/CEIEA Air Quality will
     coordinate this with the affected Industrial Organization UEC/ER.
     3.17.4. Documentation showing that the plan was followed is required along with any
     documentation required by the plan and/or site book.
     3.17.5. Industrial Organizations will submit any revisions to the plans to 75 CEG/CEIEA
     Air Quality for review and archival.
  3.18. Additional Communication/Coordination Between 75 CEG/CEIEA Air Quality and the
  Industrial Organizations.
     3.18.1. 75 CEG/CEIEA Air Quality (or other designee) will facilitate data collection and
     information dissemination.
     3.18.2. 75 CEG/CEIEA Air Quality will notify the affected Industrial Organization
     UEC/ER with a courtesy copy to the CEM in writing when requesting action.

     3.18.4. For site-specific day-to-day issues, 75 CEG/CEIEA Air Quality staff including
     contract support, will typically communicate directly with the UEC/ER. 75 CEG/CEIEA
     Air Quality communications with the Industrial Organizations regarding new
     processes/equipment and process/equipment modifications or other issues will be with
     the UEC/ER or ER’s delegate, with a courtesy copy to the CEM as appropriate.
  3.19. Training Requirements.
     3.19.1. 75 CEG/CEIEA Air Quality will:
         3.19.1.1. Provide training materials to meet applicable federal, state, and local air
         quality compliance requirements if not otherwise developed by the Hill AFB Center
         Training Office.
 10                                                     HILLAFBI32-104 1 OCTOBER 2014


          3.19.1.2. Develop and maintain training for emission units with five or more
          processes, or where otherwise warranted.
          3.19.1.3. Coordinate with the Hill AFB Center Training Office to ensure training
          materials are developed and approved IAW Installation training procedures.
      3.19.2. Courses updated in response to TVOP updates will be reviewed internally by 75
      CEG/CEIEA Air Quality before release. New courses and courses with significant
      changes will be reviewed by both 75 CEG/CEIEA Air Quality and the affected Industrial
      Organizations before finalization/approval.
      3.19.3. Tracking. It is the responsibility of the Industrial Organizations to track training
      assigned within their organizations.
      3.19.4. 75 CEG/CEIEA Air Quality will not conduct training for Industrial
      Organizations.
4. Implementation and Operation.
   4.1. General Guidelines. 75 CEG/CEIEA Air Quality will oversee the operation of all air
   emission sources, both mobile and stationary, to ensure compliance with federal, state, and
   local air quality regulations and permits. At a minimum, 75 CEG/CEIEA Air Quality will
   conduct oversight inspections, obtain necessary permits, complete emissions inventories, and
   document de minimis and/or exempt sources.
   4.2. Annual Emissions Inventories (AEIs).
      4.2.1. 75 CEG/CEIEA Air Quality will:
          4.2.1.1. Complete AEIs at the frequency specified by federal, state, and local
          regulations (every three years for sources with no periodic inventory requirements).
          4.2.1.2. Submit AEIs to regulators as required or upon request, and will submit them
          in electronic format to the AF AEI repository custodian and 75 CEG/CEIEA Air
          Quality’s parent command within 30 days of final report completion.
   4.3. Title V, AO, and Flex Permits. Industrial Organizations must operate air emission
   equipment in full compliance with permit terms and conditions.
   4.4. Vehicle Emission and Portable Equipment Controls.
      4.4.1. Hill AFB will comply with AFI 32-7040 and the Hill AFB Supplement to AFI 31-
      204 regarding mobile sources.
      4.4.2. 75 CEG/CEIEA Air Quality is responsible for managing the Hill AFB Employee
      Vehicle Inspection and Maintenance (I/M) Program.
      4.4.3. Employee Vehicle Certification and Reporting System (ECARS). Civilian and
      military employees of Hill AFB will be required to use ECARS to illustrate compliance
      with federal and local vehicle emissions requirements. To meet this requirement, each
      employee must follow the instructions sent to his/her work email address from ECARS at
      no-reply@apims.af.mil. These emails are designed to guide participants through the
      web-based process of certifying their commuter status and personal vehicle information
      in ECARS. Employees will meet this requirement at a frequency as prompted by
HILLAFBI32-104 1 OCTOBER 2014                                                                      11


       ECARS (usually annually). Employees who fail to take the appropriate action(s)
       specified in ECARS notifications may be subject to administrative action.
   4.5. Operational Site Management and Compliance. All activities that construct, operate,
   modify, relocate or demolish stationary or mobile air emission sources must be managed by
   Industrial Organizations IAW all applicable air quality regulations, policies, and instructions.
       4.5.1. Complex Environmental Managers (CEMs). Some wings and tenants appoint
       CEMs to oversee environmental issues within their organizations. In cases as such,
       coordination should be afforded to these CEMs as appropriate and directed in this
       instruction. Correspondence on Group environmental issues will be primarily conducted
       directly between 75 CEG/CEIEA Air Quality and Group ERs/UECs.
       4.5.2. Environmental Representatives (ERs). Each Industrial Organization ER will serve
       as the organization’s liaison to 75 CEG/CEIEA Air Quality, and be the air quality
       compliance advisor and point of contact for that organization.
       4.5.3. Unit Environmental Coordinators (UECs).
           4.5.3.1. Each Industrial Organization UEC is responsible for air quality compliance
           activities for specific sources.
           4.5.3.2. Each air emission source must be assigned a UEC.
           4.5.3.3. The UEC can act as ER, where the ER has delegated that authority.
           4.5.3.4. The ER must submit an approved 75 CEG/CEIEA appointment letter to 75
           CEG/CEIEA Air Quality for each UEC in their organization. The approved 75
           CEG/CEIEA appointment letter template can be found on the Air Quality website.
       4.5.4. Personnel and Equipment Certification. Industrial Organizations must ensure
       personnel, processes, and equipment are certified as required by regulation, and maintain
       records of certification. Examples of required certifications include internal combustion
       engine certification with EPA emission standards, and qualified refrigerant service
       technician.
       4.5.5. Compliance Deviations.
           4.5.5.1. Potential violations must be dealt with in a responsible manner. Known or
           suspected violations of federal, state, and local air quality requirements will be
           promptly reported NLT one business day after discovery to 75 CEG/CEIEA Air
           Quality Program Manager. Violations can lead to enforcement actions by regulatory
           agencies. Enforcement may involve fines. If enforcement actions result in fines, the
           Industrial Organization incurring the enforcement action will incur the cost of the fine
           or Supplemental Environmental Project.
4.5.5.2. Industrial Organizations will operate IAW this instruction; and all applicable air quality
federal, state, and local regulations, permits and policies. If, at any time, further operation would
increase the risk of excess emissions or non-compliance, operations must be shutdown, the
problem reported, and corrective action initiated.
           4.5.5.3. All operators, supervisors, and other affected personnel must ensure
           compliance with all applicable local, state and federal air quality rules, regulations,
           instructions, policies and other requirements. Furthermore, operators, supervisors,
12                                                    HILLAFBI32-104 1 OCTOBER 2014


        CEMs, UECs, ERs, 75 CEG/CEIEA Air Quality oversight inspectors, and others, are
        generally expected to not only “inspect” work areas but to take reasonable steps to
        ensure compliance and conduct training.
        4.5.5.4. Determination of the necessity to report a deviation will ultimately be made
        by 75 ABW/JACE and will be documented on the Air Quality SharePoint site, or
        equivalent.
        4.5.5.5. As a matter of routine and as a part of their work process, all operators,
        supervisors, CEMs, UECs, ERs and oversight inspectors should immediately correct
        any air quality deficiencies.
            4.5.5.5.1. In instances where circumstances prevent personal corrective action
            due to training requirements, licenses, or other workplace restrictions, the person
            should immediately notify the responsible employees or supervisors and follow-
            up to ensure the appropriate personnel take necessary corrective actions.
            4.5.5.5.2. In extremely rare circumstances, correction should not be performed,
            whether or not a particular deviation is reportable. Such exceptions might exist
            when disturbance of the area would destroy evidence necessary for an accident
            investigation.
            4.5.5.5.3. If an industrial organization is not sure if the deviation should be
            corrected on the spot, they should contact 75 CEG/CEIEA Air Quality for
            direction.
        4.5.5.6. To prevent recurrence of any violation, additional training is always an
        appropriate response. Taking proactive and aggressive action, particularly when
        deviations occur, generally helps reduce risk of a local, state or federal enforcement
        action, as well as reducing risk of future non-compliance. All employees and
        supervisors have an obligation to take reasonable and appropriate steps necessary to
        ensure no repeat deviations, particularly by the same employee(s) or in the same work
        area(s).
        4.5.5.7. Inspections, checks and actions should be recorded immediately. Certain
        actions are clearly specified in the TVOP and must be conducted and recorded IAW
        the TVOP. In the event a required action has been completed but not immediately
        recorded, a record may be corrected within a reasonable time without causing a
        reportable deviation. A reasonable time means for each shift (e.g.; daily, weekly or
        other defined frequency for recordkeeping requirements) that the record may be
        annotated at any time during that inspection, check or required action period.
        However, it is subject to a self-reportable deviation if the inspection, check or action
        is recorded at any time beyond 14 days from the date it was performed. This
        procedure does not at any time allow for recording a check or action that did not
        actually take place. If the required action was not completed IAW regulatory
        requirements, the action shall be subject to a self-reportable deviation.
     4.5.6. Site Books.
        4.5.6.1. Permitted air emission sources will have a site book prepared and located in
        a convenient location near the source as specified below. The site book will:
HILLAFBI32-104 1 OCTOBER 2014                                                                 13


            4.5.6.1.1. Define mandatory mechanisms, procedures and recordkeeping to be
            used to ensure compliance.
            4.5.6.1.2. Contain all current inspection checklists, and maintenance logs that are
            not documented and available elsewhere, and other required documentation to
            demonstrate source compliance with all applicable federal, state, and local
            requirements including but not limited to those contained in the TVOP, AO, and
            flex notice.
        4.5.6.2. Site books must be tailored by the Industrial Organization and contain the
        following minimum information: points of contact, summary of responsibilities,
        reference material(s) and applicable completed 75 CEG/CEIEA Air Quality approved
        checklist(s), log(s), and other compliance documentation dating back to the last time
        75 CEG/CEIEA Air Quality collected and archived these documents. Examples of
        these documents will be found on the Air Quality Website.
        4.5.6.3. Inspection Checklists and Logs.
            4.5.6.3.1. Inspection checklists and logs will not have blanks or gaps. If
            operations did not occur, this will be clearly stated on the checklist and log as
            applicable. Any potential issues (e.g., missed readings, out of range readings,
            etc.) will be reported to 75 CEG/CEIEA Air Quality as discussed in Paragraph
            4.5.5.1, and clearly annotated on the checklist and log as applicable. If pressure
            drop readings are required to be taken during a shift, the reading will be taken
            prior to beginning operations. If the reading is outside of established operating
            parameters, operations shall not begin until appropriate corrective actions have
            resulted in bringing reading(s) within established operating parameters.
            4.5.6.3.2. All corrective actions, checklists, and logs must be appropriately
            recorded and documentation retained for a period of five years.
        4.5.6.4. Format and/or structural changes made to site books by the Industrial
        Organizations must meet the same level of regulatory compliance as 75 CEG/CEIEA
        Air Quality templates to preclude any compliance risks. 75 CEG/CEIEA Air Quality
        will maintain templates for site books, logs and checklists on the Air Quality Website.
        Changes made by 75 CEG/CEIEA Air Quality to templates shall be promptly
        distributed to all affected parties.
     4.5.7. Equipment Maintenance. Compliance often involves equipment maintenance.
     Follow your organizational procedures for documenting maintenance.
     4.5.8. Start-ups, Shutdowns, Malfunctions and Breakdowns.
        4.5.8.1. Industrial Organizations will report to 75 CEG/CEIEA Air Quality all
        process/equipment start-ups, and shutdowns in advance IAW this instruction.
        4.5.8.2. A start-up is considered to be the first time a piece of equipment or process is
        powered on for production and operated once installed or modified.
        4.5.8.3. A shutdown occurs when a process or piece of equipment is shutdown for
        removal or any instance whereby a piece of equipment or process malfunctions and/or
        breaks down, and therefore, the equipment must be shutdown to comply with air
        quality regulations.
14                                                    HILLAFBI32-104 1 OCTOBER 2014


        4.5.8.4. All malfunctions and unavoidable breakdowns including those during start-
        up and shutdown resulting in excess emissions will be reported to 75 CEG/CEIEA
        Air Quality within 2 hours of the beginning of the breakdown if reasonable, but in no
        case longer than 16 hours after the beginning of the breakdown.
        4.5.8.5. 75 CEG/CEIEA Air Quality will review start-up, malfunction, breakdown,
        and shutdown information provided by the Industrial Organizations and if necessary
        submit the required notifications under 40 CFR 60.6 and UAC R307-107.
     4.5.9. Air Emissions Monitoring.
        4.5.9.1. 75 CEG/CEIEA Air Quality will identify regulatory requirements for air
        emissions monitoring.
        4.5.9.2. Opacity limits apply to air emission sources as specified in the applicable
        TVOP; affected sources must be monitored accordingly.
        4.5.9.3. Industrial Organizations are responsible for monitoring opacity IAW with
        the applicable requirements and documenting the results of opacity surveys and/or
        official EPA 40 CFR 60, Appendix A, Method 9 observations/determinations.
        4.5.9.4. 75 CEG/CEIEA Air Quality and Industrial Organizations with emission units
        with opacity monitoring requirements will have trained Visible Emission Observers
        on staff.
        4.5.9.4.1.
     4.5.10. Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) Emission Minimization.
        4.5.10.1. It is required that sources operate in a manner consistent with federal, state
        and local requirements specific to any operations performed in conjunction with the
        regulated process.
        4.5.10.2. Care must always be taken to minimize spills, splashing, and any other
        actions that contribute to an increase in the emission of VOCs.
        4.5.10.3. Employees must ensure that solvent-laden rags are properly containerized
        upon “completion of use.” For purposes of reporting, completion of use means when
        a task is completed or prior to leaving the immediate work area (whichever comes
        first). If a specific rag will be used for cleaning one item, and a second item directly
        follows the first, it is considered to be one task.
            4.5.10.3.1. A rag is considered to still be in use if it has been under the
            continuous control of associated personnel throughout that task or process
            throughout the relevant time period.
            4.5.10.3.2. Continuous control is defined as possessing actual physical and
            management control over a work process for a continuous time period in the
            immediate work area (line of sight and always within a reasonable distance of the
            location of the work process or an item). Workers who have switched to a
            separate or new task are no longer considered to be in the immediate work area.
            Continuous control ends once all associated personnel abandon a work process or
            an item for a break, lunch or at the end of a duty day.
HILLAFBI32-104 1 OCTOBER 2014                                                              15


        4.5.10.4. Operators, supervisors, and any other affected personnel shall ensure VOC-
        containing material containers (e.g., containers containing paint, solvent, etc.) are
        closed at all times except when removing or adding materials (e.g., paints, solvents,
        etc.) to the container or in the event of adding or removing items (e.g., paint guns,
        parts, brushes, etc.) to the container.
           4.5.10.4.1. Closed lids should be tight-fitting, properly aligned and fully closed.
           A VOC-containing container that is not fully closed must be treated as a potential
           reportable deviation and shall be reported IAW the procedure detailed in
           Paragraph 4.5.5, Compliance Deviations.
     4.5.11. High Vapor Pressure Solvent (HVPS) Procedures.
        4.5.11.1. All HVPS must be procured IAW AFI 32-7086, and the Hill AFB
        Supplement to AFI 32-7086.
        4.5.11.2. If the vapor pressure of a material being requested exceeds 45 mmHg at 20
        degrees Celsius it meets the classification criteria of an HVPS.
        4.5.11.3. Any HVPS material request by an Industrial Organization must meet
        specific criteria.
           4.5.11.3.1. If the product is being used in an Aerospace NESHAP applicable
           hand-wipe process, the Industrial Organization must provide information via
           email or telephone to 75 CEG/CEIEA Air Quality detailing the exact use and
           purpose of the solvent.
           4.5.11.3.2. For an Industrial Organization to receive authorization for use of any
           HVPS material as a hand-wipe product in an Aerospace NESHAP applicable
           process, it may only be used as a hand-wipe solvent in exempt processes detailed
           in 40 CFR 63.744(e). Industrial Organizations will not use any HVPS for hand-
           wipe cleaning without issuance of an HVPS license from 75 CEG/CEIEA Air
           Quality.
     4.5.12. Air Quality Working Group (AQWG) Protocol.
        4.5.12.1. The purpose of the AQWG is to meet monthly or as needed for continual
        development and on-going implementation of the Hill AFB Air Quality Compliance
