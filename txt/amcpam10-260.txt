                                           Chapter 1

                                 GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Introduction. This document describes Air Mobility Command’s (AMC) responsibilities
for planning, organizing, training, and equipping Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) aircrews that
could operate in a Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and High Yields Explosive
(CBRNE) threat area. This instruction implements the policies outlined in AFMAN 10-2503,
Operations In A Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, And High-Yield Explosive
(CBRNE) Environment, and AMC Concept of Operations, Air Mobility Operations in a
Chemical and Biological Environment.
1.2. Policy. The CRAF program, a unique and significant part of the Department of Defense
(DOD) mobility resources since 1952, is a national plan, based on the Defense Production Act of
1950 and Executive Order 12656, to utilize airlift resources of US commercial air carriers to
support DOD airlift requirements in a national security situation and defense emergencies when
airlift needs exceed the capability of military aircraft. CRAF aircraft and aircrews augment
AMC airlift operations in support of US national security objectives. While it is not policy to
knowingly send commercial air carriers into high threat areas, civil aircraft participating in the
CRAF program may conduct flights into Areas of Responsibility (AORs) that inadvertently have
the potential of CBRNE contamination. They will not conduct operations into an airbase that is
under attack or contaminated at the time of flight arrival. AMC provides CRAF with a CBRNE
familiarization briefing and issues a ground crew chemical ensemble before entry into these
areas. Although commercial aircrews are issued ground crew ensembles for personal protection,
they are neither trained nor equipped for flight operations in a contaminated environment. Upon
warning of impending CBRNE attack, every effort will be made to divert inbound commercial
aircraft and launch those on the ground. If a CRAF aircraft or aircrew is caught on the ground
during a chemical or biological attack, the crew will be evacuated by first available means and
their aircraft grounded. (NOTE: See AMCI 10-402, Civil Reserve Air Fleet, for detailed
information on commercial airlift operations in chemical and biological environment.)
1.3. Responsibilities.
     1.3.1. Headquarters AMC, Directorate of Operations, DOD Commercial Airlift Division
     (HQ AMC/A3B), will:
        1.3.1.1. Administer, control, and monitor the CRAF program for AMC.
        1.3.1.2. Assess the capability of commercial air carriers to provide safe, reliable, and
        quality airlift services for the DOD. See DOD Directive 4500.53, Department of Defense
        (DOD) Commercial Air Transportation Quality and Safety Review Program.
        1.3.1.3. Develop and implement plans and procedures that are intended to provide
        reasonable assurance of the continuation of essential services during crisis situations
        using contractor employees or other resources as necessary.
        1.3.1.4. Designate Intermediate Staging Base (ISB) locations. See AMCI 10-402, Civil
        Reserve Air Fleet, paragraphs 4.5.2 and 4.5.3.
        1.3.1.5. Ensure CBRNE familiarization and equipment is provided to contractors as
        required by contract agreement (see DODI 3020.37, Continuation of Essential DOD
AMCPAM10-260 26 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                           5


     Contractor Services During Crises). Issue CRAF aircrews the same ground personal
     protective gear as is issued to military personnel in theater and provide them CBRNE
     Defense Familiarization.
     1.3.1.6. Coordinate with HQ AMC/A4R to identify total CRAF and contract airlift
     requirements, as validated by United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM),
     to HQ AMC/A7X in order to program funding requirements.
     1.3.1.7. Develop and coordinate with AMC/A7X and HQ AMC/A4RE procedures for
     issue and turn-in of defensive personal protective gear to CRAF and contract airlift
     personnel.
     1.3.1.8. Obtain approval from AMC Director of Operations (A3), following advice from
     the Threat Working Group (TWG), to issue Individual Protective Equipment (IPE) to
     CRAF members.
  1.3.2. Headquarters AMC, Director of Installations and Mission Support, Readiness and
  Emergency Management Division (HQ AMC/A7X) will:
     1.3.2.1. Provide manpower to administer just-in-time CBRNE familiarization briefing to
     CRAF aircrews at designated ISBs.
     1.3.2.2. Include HQ AMC/A3B CRAF Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and
     high-yield explosive (CBRNE)IPE requirements into the CBRNE Passive Defense
     program element (PE 27593F).
  1.3.3. Headquarters AMC, Director of Logistics, Material Readiness Division, Weapons
  Systems Operations Branch (HQ AMC/A4O) will:
     1.3.3.1. If tasked by CRAF Enabling Concept OST Force Module (8ECRF within the
     088EF Plan Identification Number (PID) (Extended Force Module PID)) provide supply
     personnel to issue, receive, and maintain CRAF CBRNE IPE at designated ISBs.

                                             Chapter 2

                                 CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS

2.1. Equipment Issue.
     2.1.1. CRAF aircrews IPE bags/ensembles are for emergency use only. These ensembles are
     stored at Dover AFB, DE and are issued at an ISB prior to entering the AOR. Crews receive
     just-in-time training in order to quickly and properly don the suit and proceed to a protective
     shelter. Under no circumstances are civil crews expected to sustain operations in a chemical-
     biological (CB) environment.
     2.1.2. Aircrew members receiving IPE will sign a hand receipt and receive just-in-time
     training on the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) of CBRNE defense and proper
     wearing of IPE.
     2.1.3. CRAF aircrews will be fitted and issued appropriate (IPE). The standard Basis Of
     Issue (BOI) for CRAF aircrews is identified in Table 2.1

Table 2.1. CRAF IPE BOI.

Glove Inserts                                        2
     2.1.4. Individuals that are assigned IPE may be required to open the mobility bag for
     security inspections along the route. If bags are opened, ensure they are opened on one end
     and the opening of the bag does not affect any of the printed information on the bag. These
     security checks should consist of a nondestructive visual inspection. This inspection does not
     affect the shelf life or usability of the IPE equipment. If the bag is opened for inspection, it
     should be resealed immediately or at a minimum, as soon as practical with two-inch wide
     duct tape. The date of the sealing will be written across the tape with an indelible black or
     blue marker. If any material damage or destruction to IPE occurs during the inspection,
     report the damage to the security supervisor on duty at the security checkpoint. Individuals
     will report any damage to the personnel issuing or collecting IPE bags at the next ISB
     transited.
2.2. Just-in-Time Training.
     2.2.1. Through the CRAF Enabling Concept Operations Support Team (OST) Force Module,
     Civil Engineer Emergency Management (EM) personnel will be sent to designated ISBs. At
     these locations, EM personnel will provide just-in-time CBRNE familiarization to CRAF
     aircrews that are en route to the area of responsibility.
AMCPAM10-260 26 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                             7


   2.2.2. Familiarization will consist of an overview of CBRNE Defense protective equipment
   and donning procedures. As a minimum, each CRAF aircrew member will attend the
   required briefing and will demonstrate they can satisfactorily don, clear and seal the
   protective mask for the AF EM member.
2.3. Equipment Return.
   2.3.1. As per the CRAF Contract, CRAF aircrews will return IPE bags upon mission
   completion in accordance with instructions provided.
   2.3.2. AMC personnel will inspect all returned IPE bags for serviceability and return hand
   receipts to the aircrews.
2.4. Attack Warning Signals. Air Force Visual Aid 10-2511, USAF Standard Attack Warning
Signals For CBRNE Medium And High Threat Areas, outlines the Air Force’s standardized
warning signals. Figure 2.1 and the following paragraphs provide an explanation of the alarm
conditions and required actions.

Figure 2.1. Air Force Visual Aid 10-2511, USAF Standard Attack Signals For CBRNE
Medium And High Threat Areas




   2.4.1. ALARM GREEN: Attack Is Not Probable. Alarm Green is the normal condition of
   readiness in wartime. Although the area could be attacked at any time, there is no active
   threat of attack at present. Joint Service Lightweight Integrated Suit Technology (JSLIST)
8                                                    AMCPAM10-260 26 SEPTEMBER 2012


    wear is not required; keep it close at hand, or keep within a distance so you can obtain your
    IPE in 5 minutes, and be prepared for rapid donning. During ALARM GREEN conditions,
    CRAF aircraft will be cleared to land in the AOR. If CRAF aircrews must remain in a CB
    threat area overnight and the alarm condition is GREEN, the senior aircrew member must
    keep the 618th Contingency Response Group advised of the aircrew location at all times.
    Should the alarm condition change to YELLOW, RED, or BLACK, follow the procedures
    below.
    2.4.2. ALARM YELLOW: This condition indicates an attack against the airbase or
    identified location is expected in the near term. Wear your JSLIST and keep other IPE at
    hand. Go to and remain in a protective shelter, or depart the area as instructed by the
    controlling operational commander.
       2.4.2.1. If an ALARM YELLOW signal is declared, offload unneeded personnel and
       request controlling agency clearance for take-off immediately. Proceed to the nearest
       suitable airfield outside the CB threat area, fuel permitting, or to a destination provided
       by the carrier operations center or the AMC controlling agency.
       2.4.2.2. If in ALARM YELLOW and aircraft launch is not possible, aircrew should
       attempt to leave the CB threat area via any departing civil or military aircraft. If unable
       to depart, remain in your protective shelter and wear IPE as instructed by controlling
       agency until the alarm signal changes to GREEN or transportation arrangements out of
       the AOR are established.
    2.4.3. ALARM RED: Two conditions of Alarm Red are used to warn the airbase.
       2.4.3.1. One condition warns of an air or missile attacks, while the other is used to
       provide ground attack warning. In either case, you should take cover and don your
       chemical warfare defense equipment. Decon kits may be issued by airfield personnel at
       this time.
       2.4.3.2. ATTACK BY AIR OR MISSILE: This condition indicates the airbase, or
       identified location, is under aircraft or missile attack or an attack will begin within
       minutes. Warning will usually be issued by a 3-5 minute wavering siren accompanied by
       giant voice announcement.
       2.4.3.3. Signals for ATTACK BY GROUND FORCE: Indications the airbase or
       identified location is under attack by a ground force will vary from location to location.
       Crew members will receive a briefing when they arrive.
    2.4.4. ALARM BLACK: This condition indicates an attack is over and initiates base
    recovery. CRAF aircrew will remain under cover until advised to do otherwise.

   2.5.1. MOPP levels for ground forces are protection options. These options allow
   commanders to balance protection requirements and performance degradation with mission
   requirements. Standard MOPP levels also allow commanders to rapidly communicate their
   decision to their forces. MOPP levels are always used together with alarm conditions to
   quickly increase or decrease individual protection against CBRNE threats. AFVA 10-2512
   (Figure 2.2) provides a graphic depiction of the type of protective clothing worn during each
   MOPP condition.
   2.5.2. MOPP READY: Insuring CBRNE protective equipment is stowed and readily
   available on plan.
   2.5.3. MOPP 0: MOPP 0 is the normal wartime MOPP level when the enemy has a NBCC
   capability.
      2.5.3.1. Personnel will inspect issued IPE and prepare it for use.
      2.5.3.2. Keep IPE available for immediate donning.

     2.5.3.3. Do not remove the operational suit from the vapor bag or install operational C-
     2A series canisters or the M-61 filter on the protective mask until directed.
     2.5.3.4. When directed, remove the suit from the vapor bag and inspect it.
     2.5.3.5. Adjust the protective mask. Remove contact lenses (if worn).
  2.5.4. MOPP 1: MOPP 1 is used when attacks, such as missile attacks, could occur with
  little or no warning.
     2.5.4.1. Wear the JSLIST. Carry the protective mask, footwear covers, gloves, and
     decon kit.
     2.5.4.2. Close all zippers, snaps, and velcro fasteners. Wear field gear and personal body
     armor (if issued) when outdoors or when directed.
     2.5.4.3. Remove contact lenses (if not already done).
     2.5.4.4. Implement forced hydration, work-rest cycles, and buddy checks.
  2.5.5. MOPP 2: MOPP 2 is used when attacks, such as missile attacks, could occur with
  little or no warning. Individuals assume MOPP 2 when Alarm Yellow is declared, unless
  otherwise directed. MOPP 2 is utilized to provide additional protection to personnel when
  crossing or operating in previously contaminated areas.
     2.5.5.1. Wear the JSLIST and overboots. Carry the protective mask, gloves, and decon
     kit (if issued). Close all zippers, snaps, and velcro fasteners.
     2.5.5.2. Remove contact lenses (if not already done).
     2.5.5.3. Implement forced hydration, work-rest cycles, and buddy checks.
  2.5.6. MOPP 3: MOPP 3 is a post-attack protective posture that has very limited
  application. Use it at additional risk when personnel performing essential task require
  increased dexterity. MOPP 3 is used when a negligible contact or percutaneous (skin
  absorption) vapor hazard is present.
     2.5.6.1. Wear the JSLIST, overboots, and protective mask. Carry the gloves. Close all
     zippers, snaps, and velcro fasteners. Configure the mask hood according to technical
     order guidance.
     2.5.6.2. Remove contact lenses (if not already done).
     2.5.6.3. Enforce hydration standards, work-rest cycles, and buddy checks.
  2.5.7. MOPP 4: MOPP 4 is used when attacks are imminent or in progress or when
  contamination is suspected or present. Individuals will assume MOPP 4 when Alarm Red is
  declared, unless otherwise directed. MOPP 4 is used to provide the maximum protection to
  personnel.
     2.5.7.1. Wear the JSLIST, overboots, protective mask, and gloves. Close all zippers,
     snaps, and velcro fasteners.
     2.5.7.2. Enforce hydration standards, work-rest cycles, and buddy checks.

   3.2.3. Donning Preparation Procedures.
      3.2.3.1. Mask Donning Preparation Procedures. If warn, member will remove hair
      fasteners (hair clips, pins) and let hair hang freely before donning mask. When wearing
      chemical protective overgarments, hair will be neatly tucked inside jacket, see Figure 3.6
      Failure to do this could result in an improper mask fit, resulting in illness or death.
      Due to the short time it takes for toxic agents to affect you, becoming an expert in
      donning the mask and getting an airtight seal is imperative. With suspected
      contamination, every step in donning the mask is important and must be done quickly and
      accurately. Proper donning procedures are as follows:

3.3. Overgarments.
   3.3.1. Overgarments (coat and trousers) are depicted in Figure 3.8 below.
   3.3.2. JSLIST are made of permeable materials and are designed to be worn as the primary
   chemical and biological protective garment over the duty uniform or as a duty uniform over
   personal underwear. The JSLIST is made of a carbon bead material with an outer layer. The
   outer layer is made of similar materials as the battle dress uniform and is designed to repel
   water and chemical and biological agents. The JSLIST is a two-piece garment (coat and
   trousers) with an integral hood that is compatible with existing protective masks. The coat
   and trousers are packaged and issued separately but are worn together as an overgarment.

Figure 3.8. JSLIST.




   3.3.3. JSLIST Inspection and Donning Procedures: Ref TO 14P3-1-141
   3.3.3.1. First inspect and mark the suit: Preparation for a new garment:
      3.3.3.2. Remove coat and trousers from factory vacuum-sealed bags.
      3.3.3.3. Perform preventive maintenance checks to ensure the garment’s fabric is in good
      condition and that the fasteners are complete and functional.
      3.3.3.4. Mark label with date that garment was removed from package. Coats and
      trousers have labels to record when they were first removed from the factory bags and the
      number of times they have been washed. JSLIST has a 120-day service life once
      removed from the factory sealed bag. The wash/wear life for an uncontaminated JSLIST
      is 6 launderings or 45 days (whichever occurs first). With a permanent marker, mark the
      ―laundry label‖ after each wash.
   3.3.4. The following donning order is provided as a guide:
      3.3.4.1. Don the trousers by placing the legs into the trousers and pulling them up. Then
      close the slide fastener (front zipper) and fasten the two fly opening snaps.
 18                                                   AMCPAM10-260 26 SEPTEMBER 2012


       3.3.4.2. Pull the suspenders over the shoulders and fasten the snap couplers (plastic
       clips). Adjust the suspenders for the proper inseam and leg length.
       3.3.4.3. Adjust the waistband hook-and-pile fastener tapes for a snug fit.
       3.3.4.4. Don overboots over footwear. Pull the trouser legs over the overboots and
       secure the two hook-and-pile fastener tapes on each ankle so that they fit snugly around
       the boot.
       3.3.4.5. Don the coat by placing the arms into the sleeves and pulling on the coat. Then
       close the slide fastener (zipper) and the front closure flap up as far as the chest.
       3.3.4.6. Pull the bottom of the coat down over the trousers and adjust the waist for a snug
       fit using the waist drawcord.
       3.3.4.7. Secure the coat-retention loop. Bend over, reach between your legs and grasp
       the loop on the back of the garment coat. Pull on the loop so that the bottom of the
       garment coat fits snugly over garment trousers. Bring the loop forward between your
       legs. Place the loop over the webbing strip at the bottom of the coat.
       3.3.4.8. When directed to perform MOPP Levels 1 through 4, pull the coat’s waist cord
       through the front of the coat and tie it in a bow.
       3.3.4.9. Fasten the snap on the webbing strip to keep the coat’s retention-cord loop in
       place. Re-tie the coat’s retention-cord, if needed. This may result in some discomfort in
       the crotch area.
   3.3.5. PULL INTEGRATED HOOD OVER MASK AND SECURE DRAWCORD.
3.4. Overboots are made of butyl rubber and vinyl plastic, which are impermeable to liquid,
vapor, and dusty agents. The overboots are designed to be worn over combat boots/shoes. To
reduce the risk of falls and prevent damage to the overboots, ladies wearing heels should
change to a flat sole shoe. To prevent contact with chemical contamination around the legs, the
upper portion of the footwear covers must be worn in the legs of the overgarment.
3.5. Protective Gloves are a two-piece hand protection system consisting of rubber gloves for
chemical protection and separate inner cotton liners for perspiration absorption. Liners can be
worn on either hand; gloves are form fitted for either the left or right hand. The butyl rubber and
vinyl plastic gloves are impermeable to liquid, vapor, and dusty agents. To prevent contact with
chemical contamination around the wrists, the gauntlet portion of the protective gloves must be
worn in the sleeves of the overgarment.
3.6. Personal Decontamination Kit - M-291.
   3.6.1. The purpose of the M-291 kit is to allow an individual to perform immediate
   decontamination of their skin. The kit allows the physical removal and absorption of toxic
   liquid chemical agent, with no long-term effects.
   3.6.2. When you find or suspect a liquid chemical agent on your skin, or a buddy sees it and
   tells you, act immediately. The complete decontamination of the face and other areas of
   exposed skin must be done as quickly as possible--3 minutes or less.
AMCPAM10-260 26 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                               19


   3.6.3. The M-291 Kit is for external use only. It may be slightly irritating to skin or eyes.
   Keep decontaminating powder out of eyes, cuts, and wounds. Use water to wash toxic liquid
   chemical agent out of eyes, cuts, or wounds.
   3.6.4. M-291 kit is used as follows:
      3.6.4.1. Remove one Skin Decon Kit from carrying pouch.
      3.6.4.2. Tear open quickly at notch. NOTE: Although any notch may be used to open
      packet, opening at TEAR LINE will place applicator pad in a position that is easier to
      use.
      3.6.4.3. Remove applicator from packet and discard empty packet.
      3.6.4.4. Unfold applicator pad and slip finger(s) into handle. Figure 3.9
      3.6.4.5. Thoroughly scrub, using a zigzag motion, all exposed skin. NOTE: For heavily
      contaminated areas where contamination about the size of a penny is visible, place pad
      with the center line directly over contaminated area. Using a pinching motion, remove
      liquid gross contamination from skin surface. Properly dispose of contaminated pad
      (preferably in a hazardous waste container) and use a second pad for the removal of any
      residual liquid contamination.
      3.6.4.6. Distribution of the M-291 Skin Decon Kit will be managed at the destination
      airfield by Military personel. Provisions to document this requirement will be included in
      contingency-specific OPLANS or other similar documents.

                                   EQUIPMENT SIZING

4.1. General. To afford an individual with the ultimate amount of personal protection the
majority of all IPE is sized.
4.2. Protective Mask MCU 2A/P and JSGPM/M-50. There are three mask sizes: Short,
Medium, and Long. An improper mask fit could result in illness or death. Initial mask size
selection is determined by a face length measurement. The use of any 6-inch calipers is required
to measure the user’s face length and determine the proper mask size. Figure 4.1 provides an
overview of the mask measurement process and sizing.

Figure 4.1. MCU 2A/P and JSGPM/M-50 Mask Sizing.




4.3. JSLIST.
   4.3.1. Coat: Measure individual’s height and chest circumference; find corresponding height
   and chest circumference on the vertical and horizontal axes of Table 4.1; the highlighted
   section where the horizontal and vertical lines intersect is the size of coat the user should
   wear.

personal clothing and equipment required to protect an individual from biological and chemical
hazards and some nuclear effects. (JP 1-02) 2. For Air Force units, this includes the
groundcrew chemical ensemble or specialized equipment, such as the J-FIRE and field gear.
(AFI 10-2501)
Mission Oriented Protective Posture (MOPP)—A flexible system of protection against
nuclear, biological, and chemical contamination. This posture requires personnel to wear only
that protective clothing and equipment (mission-oriented protective posture gear) appropriate to
the threat level, work rate imposed by the mission, temperature, and humidity. Also called
MOPP. (JP 1-02)
Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Environment—Environments in which there is deliberate
or accidental employment, or threat of employment, of nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons;
deliberate or accidental attacks or contamination with toxic industrial materials, including toxic
industrial chemicals; or deliberate or accidental attacks or contamination with radiological
(radioactive) materials. (JP 1-02)
Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP) —Applies basic and operational doctrine to
military actions by describing the proper use of specific weapons systems or detailed tactics,
techniques, and procedures to accomplish specific military operations. (AFI 33-360)
