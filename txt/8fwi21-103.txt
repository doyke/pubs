1. General. The 8th Maintenance Squadron Commander (8 MXS/CC) has the primary
responsibility for conducting CDDAR operations, as directed by the 8th Maintenance Group
Commander (8 MXG/CC). The 8th Fighter Wing, Maintenance Operations Center (MOC) will
implement the maintenance group commander’s instructions and will request support from
transient aircraft home station/MAJCOM as required. Maintenance Flight will develop CDDAR
procedures in coordination with the base 8th Civil Engineers Squadron/Fire Department (8
CES/CEF), 8th Fighter Wing/Ground Safety (8 FW/SEG), 8 CES/Readiness and Emergency
Management Flight (8 CES/CEX), 8th Medical Operations Squadron/Base Bioenvironmental
Engineering (8 MDOS/SGOJ), 8th Security Forces Squadron (8 SFS), 8 CES/Explosive
Ordnance Disposal Flight (8 CES/CED), 8th Operations Support Squadron/Airfield Manager (8
OSS/OSAM) and other on/off base agencies as applicable.
2. Generalized CDDAR Responsibilities
     2.1. Supervisors at all levels must recognize the sources of hazards and apply appropriate
     safety practices to minimize their effect. There is an infinite variety of possible emergency
     and crash recovery situations; therefore, specific procedures cannot be prescribed for every
8FWI21-103 28 NOVEMBER 2012                                                                     3


   situation. All aircraft recovery actions are coordinated through the Incident Commander (IC)
   to the Emergency Operations Center (EOC). Practice and participation in wing crash
   recovery exercises and implementation of operational risk management techniques are
   imperative for all emergency and crash recovery operations.
3. Definitions
   3.1. Normal Responses: Aircrew declared In-Flight Emergencies (IFE) and Ground
   Emergencies (GE) requiring crash recovery team responses but limited action in recovering
   the aircraft. Examples: Flight control malfunctions, radio failures, bird strikes, hydrazine
   leaks/spills, low fuel, hung ordnance and gun malfunctions, emergency power unit
   activations, hot brakes, blown tires, hung flares, barrier engagement/cable arrestment, etc.
   3.2. Major Responses: Aircrew declared emergencies requiring crash recovery team
   response and action in recovering and removing an aircraft by means of lifting. Examples:
   Landing gear will not extend, collapsed landing gear, aircraft departs runway/taxiway and/or
   aircraft crashes, etc.
   3.3. Incident Commander (IC): The Incident Commander (IC) is a trained and
   experienced responder who provides on-scene tactical control using subject matter experts
   (SME) and support from other functionals. Normally, ICs are SMEs from the Fire, Medical,
   or SF response elements. The IC will use the Air Force Incident Management System
   (AFIMS) to manage the incident.
       3.3.1. Depending upon the situation, other personnel may function as ICs if they have
       completed Incident Command System (ICS) training IAW Chapter 6 and meet DOD and
       Federal certification standards for the specific type of incident. For example, the IC must
       meet Department of Defense Instruction (DODI) 6055.6, DOD Fire and Emergency
       Services Program and Department of Defense Manual (DODM) 6055.6, DOD Fire and
       Emergency Services Certification Program, requirements for Hazardous Materials
       (HAZMAT) and suspected Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear (CBRN)
       responses. Fire Emergency Services (FES) personnel serve as IC for EOD incidents
       during peacetime and terrorist response incidents after SF have contained or neutralized
       any hostile forces.
   3.4. Senior Fire Official (SFO): Fire department personnel by certification and duty
   position assigned responsibility for all fire fighting and rescue actions.
   3.5. Crash Recovery Team Chief (CRTC): Individual assigned responsibility for
   managing the crash recovery program according to Air Force instructions, wing mission
   plans, and applicable host-tenant agreements. Qualification will consist of reviewing the
   following: 8 FWI 21-103, Crash, Damaged or Disabled Aircraft Recovery Plan, AFI 21-101
