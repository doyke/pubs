                                      INTRODUCTION

1. These Qualification Training Packages (QTPs) were developed to enhance on-the-
job training for Aerospace Medical Service Specialty personnel. As a trainer, the QTPs
provide you with the breakdown of tasks into teachable elements. The teachable
elements will help you to guide the trainee toward sufficient proficiency for task
performance without assistance. QTPs are also used by the task
certifiers/certification official to evaluate trainees concerning tasks which need third-
party certification.

2. Review each volume and identify which modules of QTPs are needed for the
trainee’s job position. Core task items are identified with the number “5” on the STS
Column 2; these items are the minimum mandatory skills which are required for all
4N0X1 personnel to be proficient in performing. You have the flexibility to arrange
training for each module in the order that you decide.

3. Review the subject-area tasks in each module with the trainee. Direct the trainee to
review the training references to gain a better understanding of the objective for each
module. If the trainee has any questions about the objective, clarify the behavior that is
expected in the objective. Review the performance checklist with the trainee, and allow
him/her sufficient time to learn each step (some objectives may take longer to teach).
Remember--the objective of each QTP is to standardize training and to allow sufficient
time for the trainee to learn each task thoroughly in order to perform the task without
assistance.

4. When the trainee receives sufficient training and is ready to be evaluated on an
objective, follow the evaluation instructions. The performance checklist must be used
as you evaluate each task objective. When the trainee successfully accomplishes the
objective, document task completion appropriately in the six-part folder.

6. The QTP task completion is to be annotated on AF Form 1098, Special Task
Certification and Recurring Training, filed in Part 3, Section B of the six-part training
folder. NOTE: The individual checklists are not filed in each member’s six-part training
folder. A master checklist is filed in Part 3, Section B of the Master Training Plan (MTP)
six-part training folder.

7. If the trainee does not accomplish the objective, review the areas which need
remediation. Conduct a feedback concerning each module with the trainee, and
document appropriately in the 6-part folder. As the trainer, when you are satisfied that
the trainee is qualified to perform the task, he/she will be re-evaluated until the objective
is met.

8. If the task which is being trained requires third-party certification by a task
certifier/certifying official, the trainer first must ensure that the trainee is qualified to
perform the task without assistance. Then the trainee will be evaluated by a task
certifier/certifying official. The tasks which require third-party certification are denoted


                                               3
with a “^” in Column 3E of the Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP). After
third-party certification, training qualification is documented appropriately in the 6-part
folder.

9. The QTPs are a necessary tool for standardizing refresher/sustainment training.
Such standardization will benefit the CFETP training concept throughout each member’s
career. These documents also will be utilized for assessing/certifying the Aerospace
Medical Service Specialist each time that he/she is assigned to a new duty position.
The QTP developers’ goal is to publish a usable document for certifying officials,
trainers, and trainees for the purpose of enhancing on-the-job training for Aerospace
Medical Service Specialty personnel. We value your first-hand expertise, and we
encourage your feedback. Direct all inquiries to:

OBJECTIVE:                          The trainee will successfully demonstrate without error the
                                    performance aspects of assisting with an EGD examination.

EVALUATION INSTRUCTIONS:

1.   After the trainee has received instruction, allow sufficient practice on each part of the
     task.

2.   The evaluator will STOP the procedure immediately and correct the trainee if
     performance could become detrimental to patient safety at any time.

3.   Use the performance checklist to ensure all steps of the task are accomplished.

4.   Document task competency upon completion of the evaluation in the trainee’s OJT
     record. Initial evaluation should be documented in the CFETP. All recurring
     evaluations should be documented on AF Form 1098.

TASK(s):                            Perform sterilization of endoscope.

CFETP/STS REFERENCE(s):             Pertinent AF Form 797.

REMARKS/NOTES:                      **The elevator channel of diagnostic/therapeutic
                                    duodenoscopes requires repeated flushing with disinfectant
                                    and alcohol. Most mechanical processors do not have
                                    adaptors for the channel. Failure to properly irrigate this
                                    channel between uses has been shown to contribute to
                                    disease transmission and patient infection. See the
                                    manufacturers guide for further guidance.

OBJECTIVE:                          The trainee will successfully demonstrate without error the
                                    performance aspects of performing sterilization of
                                    endoscope.

EVALUATION INSTRUCTIONS:

1.   After the trainee has received instruction, allow sufficient practice on each part of the
     task.

2.   The evaluator will STOP the procedure immediately and correct the trainee if
     performance could become detrimental to patient safety at any time.

3.   This assessment should not be performed using real patient in an emergency situation.

4.   Use the performance checklist to ensure all steps of the task are accomplished.
