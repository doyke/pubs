This wing operating instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 21-1, Air and
Space Maintenance, Air Force Instruction (AFI) 21-101 Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance
Management, Chapter 13, Mobility Aircraft Defensive Systems Loading Policy. Establishing
specific guidelines for C-130 aircraft configured with chaff/flare munitions for the Aircraft
Defensive Systems (ADS). These systems use class/division 1.3 and 1.4 explosives, which
require special handling and coordination. The following procedures must be accomplished to
ensure explosives are handled safely and expeditiously while on Ramstein Air Base or at a
deployed location. All personnel working around explosives-loaded aircraft must be trained and
familiar with the hazards involved. The goal is to enhance safety by exposing the minimum
number of people to the minimum amount of explosives for a minimum amount of time. Ensure
that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in
accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of
in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule located in Air Force Records
Information Management System: https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61a/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm.

RAMSTEINABI21-201 7 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                5


   4.6. No maintenance shall be performed on aircraft munitions defensive systems or the
   WOW system until all munitions are removed from the aircraft and the defensive systems are
   safed.
   4.7. Using the proper technical data, the AMXS/MXS Production Superintendent and lead
   Electronic Countermeasure technician/system 7-levels will determine which maintenance
   actions should/can be performed on explosives-loaded aircraft.
5. Procedures for Launch/Recovering and Explosives-Loaded Aircraft
   5.1. Launch all explosives-loaded aircraft as normal IAW AFI 11-218, Aircraft Operations
   and Movement on the Ground.
   5.2. As soon as inbound notification is received from an aircraft that previously launched
   with flares loaded, Command Post will notify MOC, who will then contact the Munitions
   Flight and the AMXS Production Superintendent to announce the aircraft tail number,
   parking location and downtime. In addition, Command Post/MOC will remind the aircraft
   commander that the aircraft must be inspected for hung flares prior to proceeding to final
   parking.
   5.3. After landing, the aircraft will proceed to the hammerhead for end-of-runway
   inspections where the aircrew will inspect for hung flares. The aircraft will not attempt to go
   to final parking until the aircrew has visually inspected the munitions and been cleared by the
   MOC.
   5.4. If an un-commanded release of munitions occur:
      5.4.1. Aircrew personnel will ensure the defensive systems are made safe before landing.
      5.4.2. Aircrew will perform all applicable hung flare checks at the hammerhead. If a
      hung flare exists, go to step 5.5.
      5.4.3. If no hung flare is discovered the aircraft will taxi to final parking when cleared to
      do so.
      5.4.4. Upon arrival, qualified Electronic Countermeasures technicians will download the
      aircraft chaff/flare. Once munitions are downloaded IAW T.O. 1C-130-J-33-1-2 or T.O.
      1C-130J-33-1-2CL-1, the aircraft is considered safe and cargo can be downloaded.
      5.4.5. The aircraft will be impounded until an investigation is performed by qualified
      Electronic Countermeasures technicians.
   5.5. If a hung flare or unknown condition exists:
      5.5.1. Inform MOC and they will contact Command Post who will notify EOD, Wing
      Weapons Safety, and the Fire Department to respond to applicable aircraft. MOC will
      also notify Maintenance Group/Quality Assurance and the AMXS Production
      Superintendent.
      5.5.2. Engines will be shut down immediately and the aircraft will be chocked.
      5.5.3. Crew and all nonessential personnel will evacuate to a safe distance determined by
      "Emergency Withdrawal Distances" in Table 1
      5.5.4. EOD will secure the area around the aircraft and download the hung munitions.

    5.5.5. The aircraft will then be towed to an aircraft parking spot.
    5.5.6. Upon arrival to the parking spot, aircraft will be impounded until an investigation
    is performed by qualified Electronic Countermeasures technicians.
