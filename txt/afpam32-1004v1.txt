                                   for guidance only. Air Force Instructions have minimized
                                   mandatory requirements to encourage innovation. To better
                                   support the Air Force mission and its people, base Civil
                                   Engineer (BCE) managers are given the maximum degree
                                   of flexibility to achieve the desired results.

1.1   Flight Overview              The Operations Flight is composed of five elements to pro-
                                   cess requirements in an efficient and timely manner. These
                                   elements are Maintenance Engineering, Facility Mainte-
                                   nance Work centers, Material Acquisition, Infrastructure
                                   Support, and Heavy Repair.

                                   The Maintenance Engineering Flight provides engineer-
                                   ing expertise for the Operations Flight, support of infra-
                                   structure and facility project review, program management,
                                   some drafting, service and utility contract management,
                                   recurring work program, and work analysis and method
                                   improvement.

                                   The Facility Maintenance Work centers mission is to es-
                                   tablish all recurring work, minor maintenance and repair,
                                   and selected work orders. Because the facility maintenance
                                   manager controls the people and resources within the work
                                   center, they can work directly with the customer to execute
                                   work. The facility maintenance manager meets with facility
                                   managers during periodic visits.

                                   The Material Acquisition Element accounts for all activi-
                                   ties related to vehicle, equipment, and material acquisition,
                                   receiving, warehousing, and distribution. This includes op-
                                   eration of the base self-help center.

                                   The Infrastructure Support Element provides the opera-
                                   tion and maintenance of base utilities. These normally in-
                                   clude water and waste, heat plant, exterior electric, power
                                   production, liquid fuels, and alarms.

                                  The Heavy Repair Element accomplishes the majority of
                                  in-house large and multi-craft work orders and all pave-
                                  ments and equipment work; including, facility renovation,
                                  alteration projects, all pavements, airfields, roads and side-
                                  walks, sweeping, pest management, and equipment opera-
                                  tions and repair.

1.2   Origin of the               The Operations Flight is the core of the Civil Engineering
      Operations Flight           organization. Over the past 50 years, Operations Flight has
                                  been known, officially, as the Repair and Utilities Division,
                                  Maintenance Branch, and Maintenance and Operations Di-
                                  vision. Although the configuration has varied somewhat;
                                  functionally, the mission has remained the same.

                                  The Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) conducted a
                                  management study in 1990. The result was The Manage-
                                  ment Review Study — DMRD that proposed six major ini-
                                  tiatives:
                                  (1)    creation of public works centers,
                                  (2)    zonal maintenance,
                                  (3)    multi-skilling of military workforce,
                                  (4)    maintenance engineering,
                                  (5)    reduction of military positions from 28,950 to
                                         7,150, and
                                  (6)    a savings of $2.4 billion within a six-year period.
                                  As a result of this study, the current configuration of Op-
                                  erations Flight was indirectly created. After an evaluation
                                  of DMRD-967, the Air Force concluded that the proposals
                                  resulting from the study would severely degrade wartime
                                  capability and responsiveness to customer needs.

                                  The initiatives offered by the Air Force as a counter-
                                  proposal maintained the intent of OSD without compro-
                                  mising readiness and responsiveness. The Air Force initia-
                                  tives included:
                                  (1)    reducing the functional layers,
                                  (2)    reducing the number of career fields from 17 to 10,
                                  (3)    reorganizing based on task instead of skill,
                                  (4)    applying total quality management methods,
                                  (5)    increasing productivity of individuals and teams,
                                  (6)    reducing military strength from 28,950 to 22,765,
                                  (7)    saving $915 million within a six-year period,
                                  (8)    ending product orientation,
                                  (9)    increasing war fighting capability, and
                                  (10)   increasing customer satisfaction.

                                   The Operations Flight realignment of manpower, skills,
                                   training, and responsibilities was configured to achieve the
                                   efficiencies and customer satisfaction standards inherent in
                                   a service organization.

1.3   The Objective                The approval and implementation of the Objective Squad-
      Squadron                     ron structure developed a basic and standard capability
                                   throughout the Air Force. A major concern at all command
                                   levels is the ability to meet mission demands in a timely
                                   and efficient manner in an era of diminishing resources.
                                   Sophisticated weaponry and new technologies continue to
                                   be the tail wind pushing the needs for innovative manage-
                                   ment techniques under austere funding conditions. Imagi-
                                   nation, discipline, and foresight, forged with a can-do atti-
                                   tude, create the environment necessary to achieve desired
                                   goals.

                                   The Objective Squadron was formed to improve job ac-
                                   complishment and centralize the work or the mission. The
                                   objective was to reduce unnecessary or redundant supervi-
                                   sory positions, multi-craft and multi-skill the workforce,
                                   and implement better business-like practices to the process
                                   associated with work accomplishment. The reorganization
                                   of CE and the evolution of the five-element Operations
                                   Flight marked a major improvement in the CE structure.
                                   Previously, the focus of CE on functions resulted in some
                                   inefficiencies. To become more efficient and customer-
                                   focused, the new structure consolidates functions and crafts
                                   by products, such as readiness, environmental, and re-
                                   sources.

                                   The Operations Flight, composed of five elements, proc-

                                   interface with the contractors. Service contracts such as
                                   ground maintenance, refuse collection, custodial services,
                                   and the development of IDIQ service contracts can signifi-
                                   cantly enhance the BCE’s ability to meet customers needs.
                                   Service contracts can greatly offset workload, allowing the
                                   BCE to concentrate the limited workforce to core work.

                                   Recurring work program: The RWP applies to all rou-
                                   tine, redundant recurring work involving real property, real
                                   property installed equipment (RPIE), or systems and other
                                   equipment maintained by CE. Recurring work includes op-
                                   erations, service work, and preventative maintenance for
                                   which the scope and level of effort is known without a job
                                   site visit each time the work is scheduled. The RWP is an
                                   objective shared by all elements in the Operations Flight.
                                   Maintenance Engineering’s task is to oversee the develop-
                                   ment of the program and periodic assessment of its ele-
                                   ments. This assessment of the RWP includes the periodic
                                   review of the requirements and initiating recommendation
                                   to improve the infrastructure and manpower usage.

                                   Work analysis and method improvements: Analyze the
                                   Operations Flight resources and mission requirements and
                                   providing recommendations to the flight chief and element
                                   superintendents on resource allocation and work execution.
                                   These analyses include developing performance standards,
                                   economic or cost benefit analyses, developing and meas-
                                   uring productivity and quality force indicators, and review
                                   of work center workload manpower balance and skills mix.
                                   The ultimate goal of this objective is a workforce who
                                   works smarter, not harder.

Chapter 3           Facility Maintenance Element
3.1   Mission                     The mission of the Facility Maintenance Element is to es-
                                  tablish all recurring work, minor maintenance and repair,
                                  and selected work orders. Since the facility maintenance
                                  manager controls the people and resources within the work
                                  center, they can work directly with the customer to execute
                                  work. The facility maintenance manager meets with facility
                                  managers during periodic visits and records minor mainte-
                                  nance and repair requirements on AF Form 1219, BCE
                                  Multi-Craft Job Order, or direct schedule work order. For-
                                  ward work beyond work centers capability or approval
                                  level to the next approval level. Large work order require-
                                  ments normally meet a work order review panel which de-
                                  termines the priority of execution and method of accom-
                                  plishment.

3.2   Objectives                  The Facility Maintenance Element objectives are to provide
                                  single-point customer service, facility reviews, mainte-
                                  nance, repair, and modification to real property, recurring
                                  work program, training, and inspection.

                                  Provide single-point customer service: The work center
                                  customer service unit is the primary interface between the
                                  CE and the base customers. The facility maintenance man-
                                  agers control the resources within their work centers.
                                  Therefore, the manager can schedule and execute work re-
                                  quirements based upon verbal or written guidance directly
                                  from the customer. It is essential for facility maintenance
                                  managers to establish a working relationship with the facil-
                                  ity managers and meet with them frequently.

                                  Provide facility reviews: The facility maintenance man-
                                  ager should schedule facility visits based on 30- to 90-day
                                  schedule or as required and accomplish all recurring work,
                                  minor maintenance and repair, and selected work orders.
                                  Facility reviews performed by the building manager and the
                                  CE personnel foster a sense of ownership and stewardship.
                                  This reinforces the Flight’s commitment to providing cus-
                                  tomer service.

                                  Maintenance, repair, and modifications to real prop-
                                  erty: The facility maintenance manager meets with the
                                  facility managers during periodic visits and records minor

                                   plished within the element based on available manpower,
                                   man-hours, and skill level capability on a direct scheduled
                                   work order. The engineers and the customers share the re-
                                   sponsibilities associated with good stewardship and maxi-
                                   mizing resources.

                                   Perform recurring work program: The recurring work
                                   program is managed by the facility maintenance manager.
                                   It is used to ensure work is accomplished by reserving
                                   hours for this work before routine requirements are sched-
                                   uled. The RWP should be developed so the majority of the
                                   requirements are scheduled and accomplished during the
                                   facility-cycled visits. This results in the most efficient use
                                   of available resources and time management.

                                  The Chief reviews and evaluates management procedures,
                                  work performance plans and methods, and flow of work as
                                  they involve or affect immediate office, subordinate staff

Chapter 8           Manpower
8.1   Manning the Flight          The single most critical factor affecting Operations Flight
                                  capability is manpower resources. Air Force Manpower
                                  Standard (AFMS) 44EO quantifies the manpower required
                                  to accomplish the tasks described in the process oriented
                                  description for varying levels of workload (See Attachment
                                  2, Core Requirements — All Flight Elements).

                                  The BCE, with MAJCOM’s approval, has the authority to
                                  determine the distribution of the total core manpower re-
                                  quirement among the elements. This provides a guide for
                                  distribution of earned manpower and grades among the five
                                  Elements.

                                  The AFMS defines the manpower allowed to support an
                                  Objective Flight (Objective Wing Operations Flight). It ap-
                                  plies only to peacetime operations. The Objective Flight
                                  includes the following initiatives:
                                  (1)    zonal maintenance,
                                  (2)    multi-skilled military work force,
                                  (3)    cradle-to-grave design and construction project
                                         management,
                                  (4)    streamlined production-oriented organization,
                                  (5)    maintenance engineering,
                                  (6)    a Government Operated Civil Engineer Supply
                                         Store (GOCESS) (i.e., operated by in-house re-
                                         sources),
                                  (7)    Work Information Management System (WIMS)
                                         and Civil Engineer Material Acquisition System

                                         and
                                  (8)    an active Simplified Acquisition Base Engineering
                                         Requirements (SABER) program.
                                  Authorizations are adjusted according to the following
                                  workload factors:
                                  (1)    weighted total square feet of floor space,
                                  (2)    the number of facilities,
                                  (3)    the number of military family housing units, and
                                  (4)    the number of general officer quarters.

                                  The Objective Squadron prioritized the flight and element
8.2   Element Manpower            responsibilities and tasks; thereby, establishing core re-
      Issues                      quirements and non-core requirements. Authorizations are
                                  earned by accomplishing the core tasks. Limited manpower
                                  resources encourage operations personnel to find alterna-
                                  tive methods for those other non-core tasks.

8.3   Variances                   Variances are a process where increased manpower, mili-
                                  tary and civilian, are determined necessary to meet in-
                                  creased or mission needs and changes. Variances may be
                                  submitted to request approval to perform work that does
                                  not appear to be part of the core responsibilities.

8.4   Contracting                 Contracting is, and will continue to be, a major force multi-
                                  plier to perform base maintenance, repair, alteration, and
                                  construction requirements. Coordination with Maintenance
                                  Engineering, Resources and the other flights can provide a
                                  wealth of information on how to establish the right con-
                                  tracts needed to support Operations Flight requirements.
                                  One alternative to accomplishing work that is necessary,
                                  but no longer part of the CE core task, is service contracts.
                                  These contracts can be utilized to group like types of work
                                  together that are necessary, but not critical, to the mission.
                                  Service contracts are currently being used to support the
                                  RWP program in areas such as heating, ventilation, and air
                                  conditioning (HVAC) filter replacements, some water and
                                  sewer valve maintenance, and air balancing on air condi-
                                  tioning systems.

                                  tivity while the workforce was going through manpower
                                  reductions.

                                  nical skill. Example: A plumber replaces a wall-mounted
                                  water cooler, reconnects the electrical power, and refinishes
                                  the wall.

                                  The intent of multi-crafting was to create teams of skilled
                                  craftsmen with the purpose of quickly completing work as-

                                   signments. This factor is increasingly more important to the
                                   overall success of the zonal maintenance concept.

8.5.2 Multi-skilling               Multi-skilling is defined as: Craftsman has journeyman
                                   skills in two or more trades. Example: An HVAC me-
                                   chanic has journeyman skills in both heating and air condi-
                                   tioning and apprentice-type skills in controls. Multi-skilling
                                   created teams of professionals who shared common exper-
                                   tise, with the intent of taking full advantage of each profes-
                                   sional’s skills and, at the same time, enhancing the experi-
                                   ences of each. Both multi-skilling and multi-crafting make
                                   use of military and civilian personnel.

8.6   Overhires                    Overhires are non-permanent employees hired to fulfill a
                                   specific purpose (e.g., snow removal); they do not fill an
                                   authorized position on the unit manning document and may
                                   be paid with O&M funds. All CE squadrons have a work
                                   year ceiling which limits their number of man-years. Every
                                   overhire funded reduces the number of man-years, which in
                                   turn reduces the number of funded or authorized positions
                                   that may be filled.

8.7   Matrixing                    Productivity gains are achieved through matrixing. Ma-
                                   trixing is the movement of personnel within an element to
                                   support an identified shortage in a skill level, Air Force
                                   specialty (AFS), or specialized work task. Inspection of
                                   specialized service contracts is one example where crafts-
                                   men are used to augment quality assurance evaluators
                                   (QAEs) in the Maintenance Engineering Element.

                                  Manning levels and authorizations are based upon fully
                                  qualified personnel. The appropriate training prior to as-
                                  signment is essential for acceptable work performance.

9.1   Enlisted Workforce          The requirement for having a military workforce is to meet
                                  the wartime contingency taskings. Each MAJCOM has a
                                  military strength, which is distributed to each installation.
                                  There is some flexibility in the overall military-to-civilian
                                  mix based on the core AFS requirements (Attachment 2).
                                  Coordination with the MAJCOM and Resources Flight
                                  manpower person can assist in determining the right mix
                                  and numbers required to meet specific base needs. The
                                  Readiness Flight is responsible for management and exe-
                                  cution of the readiness training program.

9.2   Civilian Workforce          The Operations Flight is comprised of a civilian work
                                  force, which augments the military forces to accomplish
                                  operations, maintenance and repair, recurring work, and
                                  modifications to real property. This civilian work force:
                                  (1)    provides a higher level of career field knowledge to
                                         supplement the senior enlisted force;
                                  (2)    provides continuity and stability at the installation
                                         during contingency exercises and deployments of
                                         military personnel;
                                  (3)    has specific duties and responsibilities during base
                                         exercises, military deployments, and natural disas-
                                         ters/emergencies; and
                                  (4)    provides training to enlisted and other civilian per-
                                         sonnel.
                                  The local Consolidated Personnel Center and Labor Man-
                                  agement Agreement can give specific criteria for each of
                                  these instances. Most civilians hired are at the Journeyman
                                  level; however; in the future they may be hired as appren-
                                  tices and intermediate level employees.

9.3   Training Objectives         It is the responsibility of each organization to develop and
      and Organization            tailor a training program to meet their needs and require-
                                  ments, as well as base and contingency requirements. This
                                  training program must provide a level of training consistent
                                  with prescribed reporting and documentation requirements.

                                   Guide for Civil Engineer Training (March '96). This docu-
                                   ment, in its entirety, is available through HQ AFCESA,
                                   Operations Directorate, Training Division.
                                   (1)    The Career Development Section (CDS) is an es-
                                          tablished work center with a minimum of five CE
                                          technicians assigned from HVAC, electrical, struc-
                                          tural, utilities, and pavements and equipment. These
                                          personnel should be selected based on their motiva-
                                          tion, subject matter knowledge, and, most impor-
                                          tantly, their positive attitude toward training. The
                                          unit training manager is the advisor and ensures
                                          CDS personnel follow established guidelines,
                                          meeting objectives and goals.
                                   (2)    The team should work together for a minimum of
                                          four months to meet the objectives. Technicians do
                                          not perform work center-related duties or standby
                                          during the time they are assigned except for emer-
                                          gencies (e.g., base power outage). Once the squad-
                                          ron training days are established, technicians may
                                          return to their work centers. Then, they meet once
                                          or twice a month to coordinate the training days and
                                          resolve problems that have occurred.
                                   (3)    The team develops training plans for core tasks
                                          listed on the career field education and training
                                          plans (CFETP) for each Air Force specialty.
                                   (4)    Keep current in national, state, and local agencies'
                                          environmental laws. State certified plant operators
                                          must maintain currency in their field as prescribed
                                          by the appropriate agency or dictated by other
                                          regulatory directives. The plant operators should
                                          prominently post written operating procedures for
                                          ready reference.
                                   (5)    The team develops lesson plans and instructs train-
                                          ing sessions using both the lecture and demonstra-
                                          tion/performance methods. They assist the unit
                                          training manager in identifying certification and
                                          testing (CerTest) videos to enhance the on-the-job
                                          training program. They develop career development
                                          course pretest examinations to validate study habits
                                          and enhance knowledge levels; assist in the devel-
                                          opment of training plans for specific contingency-
                                          required tasks, especially those requiring multi-
                                          skills. The team establishes rotation schedules for
                                          transition trainees to ensure certification on all core
                                          tasks and conducts task evaluations on technicians

                                         in both formal upgrade training and transition
                                         training (multi-skill).
9.3.1 Enlisted Training           The training program for enlisted personnel is based on es-
                                  tablishing a strategic plan by identifying specific goals and
                                  achieving the desired results.

                                  The training goals are to ensure everyone in a multi-skilled
                                  specialty completes the standard core taskings in their area
                                  by January 1998 and all others are trained and qualified on
                                  their core tasks. The purpose of the plan is to identify re-
                                  sponsibilities and requirements for training. The plan de-
                                  fines points of contact, objectives for training, and metrics.

                                  The specialty function manager (SFM) is the senior ranking
                                  enlisted person in the specialty (electrical function man-
                                  ager, HVAC/R functional manager). The commander dele-
                                  gates the responsibility and authority to these members to
                                  ensure training is available and scheduled. The SFM over-
                                  sees the training process. The supervisors and flight chiefs
                                  must ensure individuals complete the training. Multi-skilled
                                  specialties (shown on Table 2, Personnel Responsible for
                                  Training) are indicated with an asterisk.

                                  The specialties function manager uses the CFETP to plan,
                                  conduct, and evaluate training. The SFM also:
                                  (1)    maintains a list of all personnel in the specialty E-1
                                         through E-6 in upgrade training (UGT) and qualifi-
                                         cation training, and oversees their training;
                                  (2)    identifies in which core tasks each individual must
                                         train;
                                  (3)    identifies which tasks each work center can train
                                         on-the-job using actual equipment or training aids
                                         when the equipment is not available (training sup-
                                         port that could be provided by the other work cen-
                                         ters or base units should be considered);
                                  (4)    consolidates training requirements of all work cen-
                                         ters; and
                                  (5)    identifies training limitations due to equipment non-
                                         availability.
                                  If the team needs to go to nearby bases or commercial
                                  sources, they should provide the commander, through the
                                  unit training manager, estimated costs of doing so.

*Multi-skilled specialty
**The specialty function manager (SFM) is the senior ranking enlisted person in the specialty
   (electrical functional manager, HVAC/R functional manager)

                                    Each SFM will develop a master task list (MTL) for the
                                    specialty, where the specialties are assigned to more than
                                    one work center. Work centers where training can be done
                                    should be documented and 5- and 7-level core tasks re-
                                    quired for UGT and qualification training identified.

                                    Each work center develops an MTL for each assigned spe-
                                    cialty; the work center/individuals perform including one-
                                    deep positions. Items included on the MTL are core tasks;
                                    normal, day-to-day taskings; wartime/contingency tasks;
                                    special certifications and recurring requirements; and local
                                    taskings (e.g., additional duties).

                                    The SFM will plan and schedule training and distribute the
                                    information to flight chiefs. This should be done in advance
                                    to allow flight chiefs to plan and schedule their workload.
                                    Flight chiefs should also notify the SFM when unique
                                    training opportunities are available (tasks usually not per-
                                    formed).

                                    Requirements for computer upgrades also need to be identi-
                                    fied. A computer in the work center (with limited access for
                                    a controlled environment) should be designated as the
                                    computer for training applications. This will be used for the

Chapter 10 Safety
                                   Safety is an important factor in executing and performing
                                   the BCE work requirements. A good safety program re-
                                   quires dedicated individuals continually monitoring and
                                   checking work being accomplished in the work centers, and
                                   the field. Weekly safety programs with videos, presenta-
                                   tions, and visual displays help reduce the number of safety
                                   violations and hazards that may occur in an area. Sharing
                                   safety information with the Installation Ground Safety Of-
                                   fice may lead to a structured safety program designed to
                                   eliminate safety hazards before they occur. OSHA and
                                   other agencies are more than willing to assist in meeting
                                   needs and requirements to support and promote safety
                                   within an organization.

                                   Identification of potential problem areas is the first step in a
                                   good safety program. This identification process requires a
                                   complete walk through existing work centers and evaluat-
                                   ing current working conditions. This evaluation identifies
                                   hazards and aids in establishing a formal training program.

                                   While conducting an investigation, any permanently and
                                   temporarily installed electric, pressure, and mechanical
                                   type equipment used within the inspected area should be
                                   identified. How they operate and what types of material
                                   may be used with the equipment should be reviewed. Safe
                                   clearances around that equipment should be determined,
                                   using OSHA standards. The names of formally-trained op-
                                   erators who are to operate the equipment should be posted.

                                   Emergency cut-off switches attached to the equipment, in
                                   case of an accident, and any manufacturer safety compo-
                                   nents must be identified on the equipment and in working
                                   order. The use of equipment by unauthorized personnel,
                                   and without the required safety equipment, is not allowed.

                                   Other hazards may be noted during the safety identification
                                   process. Many CE work centers use, store, and handle some
                                   type of hazardous material. These materials include paints,
                                   thinners, cleaning solvents, and oils. Coordination with the
                                   Environmental Flight will ensure the proper handling, stor-
                                   age, and disposal of all hazardous material. Continuous
                                   emphasis on these issues provides for a safe and hazard-
                                   free environment.

                                  These are just a few hazards that exist within a typical CE
                                  squadron. A formal training program develops, implements
                                  and, continually, observes and briefs all employees on the
                                  use of equipment and hazardous material with which they
                                  may come in contact. In addition, hazardous situations may
                                  occur while performing work. The proper use of methods
                                  and tools of the trade should be a major concern. Continu-
                                  ous emphasis should be placed on monitoring and inspect-
                                  ing job sites to reduce and eliminate accidents and hazards
                                  before they become injuries.

Chapter 11 Meeting Customer Requirements
                                   The focus of the Flight is on customer service. Excellence
                                   means genuine concern for customers’ needs and satisfac-
                                   tion. Customer service must pervade every aspect of the
                                   Operations Flight. If the customers are not satisfied, the job
                                   is not being done.

                                   No other base organization directly affects the living envi-
                                   ronment of every person on a base as does the Operations
                                   Flight. It is essential that BCE personnel know the impor-
                                   tance of each customer contact in terms of BCE response
                                   and personnel behavior. It is not possible to satisfy every
                                   request, but it is possible to explain constraints and seek
                                   alternatives in a courteous and helpful manner. Manage-
                                   ment must carefully select personnel to operate customer
                                   service units (CSU), work center customer service units,
                                   service call functions, and other functions and elements
                                   where there is heavy exposure to customers.

                                   Commitments to customers should be carefully made and
                                   every reasonable effort made to meet them. If a commit-
                                   ment is not met, the customer should be told the reason and
                                   given a new commitment. The building managers should be
                                   part of the BCE management team. Keeping managers in-
                                   formed on BCE programs, constraints, and the status of
                                   projects is important. Cooperative planning, budget, con-
                                   tracting, supply, and transportation help the BCE organiza-
                                   tion meet its commitments. Publicity in bulletins and news-
                                   papers is useful, but motivated BCE people in personal
                                   contact with customers are most important to a positive,
                                   results-oriented organization.

11.1 Providing Customer            Providing customer service initializes the coordination ef-
     Service                       fort in providing information or work requirements. There
                                   are two primary methods. First, the most efficient method
                                   is for the customer to call or come into their respective
                                   work center (a central point) and talk to someone they
                                   know to get what information they need. This familiarizes
                                   the customer with the person to see if problems arise or if
                                   they need some other type of service; such as, materials for
                                   a self-help project. Second, the establishment of a sched-
                                   uled facility visit program increases the commitment. This
                                   will ultimately reduce the number of walk-ins and tele-
                                   phone

                                  calls for routine work. The customers knows who to expect
                                  and when and why. The objective is to get as close to this
                                  customer-friendly environment as possible.

                                  Communication between the customer and the civil engi-
                                  neer representative is the key ingredient to a successful re-
                                  lationship to meeting the customers needs. Understanding
                                  exactly what the customer wants in service requirements
                                  and being able to provide that service to the customer have
                                  been a continuing concern of Operations Flight Chiefs.

                                  Meeting regularly, both formally and informally, with Ele-
                                  ment Chiefs, building managers, and commanders to dis-
                                  cuss program considerations builds customer good will.
                                  Once some type of regular and consistent agenda is estab-
                                  lished, customers develop a sense of trust and knows that
                                  the civil engineer shares the same level of concern towards
                                  the facilities as they do.

                                  Establishing some type of structured approach to work ac-
                                  ceptance and prioritization demonstrates to customers that
                                  CE is working their concerns and mission priorities.

                                  The Facility Maintenance Element is responsible for the
                                  building managers program. Building managers are the
                                  primary contact between the BCE and executing all work
                                  requirements. Building managers should have at least 18
                                  months retainability at the time of appointment. In multi-
                                  purpose facilities, the major user should be assigned as the
                                  primary building manager. Any other organization using a
                                  portion of a multipurpose may be allowed to appoint an al-
                                  ternate building manager for its area. Alternates can proc-
                                  ess actions with the BCE or work center, but should coor-
                                  dinate with the primary building manager. The primary
                                  building manager will then be able to track all work
                                  planned or accomplished in the facility.

                                  Self-help is an excellent way to accomplish important
                                  “people projects;” such as, facility enhancements, land-
                                  scaping projects, and general improvements. Self-help,
                                  usually work that cannot be accomplished due to higher
                                  priority work, is requested and accomplished by personnel
                                  from that facility or squadron. A successful self-help pro-
                                  gram improves facilities and fosters a feeling of pride and
                                  ownership. It is the responsibility of everyone in CE to
                                  promote and foster this program.

                                   Acquisition to be stocked for recurring demands.
                                   Approval is based on demand history, funding
                                   availability, and storage limitation.
CEMAS stock list (CSL) --          A unique number assigned to individual items listed in
                                   the noun dictionary.
certificate of necessity --        A written statement, signed by Deputy Assistant
                                   Secretary of the Air Force for Installation (SAF/MII),
                                   which certifies it is necessary (for reasons vital to the
                                   national security) for the Air Force to exceed the
                                   statutory cost limits established in AFI 32-9001 relative
                                   to annual rent or alterations, improvements, and repairs
                                   to leased buildings.
cession --                         Ceding or yielding by a state of its legislative
                                   jurisdiction over government-controlled real property
                                   to the federal government.
clearance easement --              The right to remove or prevent obstructions rising into

                                   the sides of the runway (transition zones), clearance for
                                   approach lighting sites, communication sites, etc. A
                                   clearance easement, specifically, does not include the
                                   right of aircraft passage over the land, so the landowner
                                   may separately recover for loss of value to his or her
                                   land due to low and frequent flights of aircraft.
commercial facilities              Air Force-owned and -operated facilities housing a
(industrial-type) --               function that could be done by private industry, such as
                                   motor repair shops, laundries, bakeries, ice cream
                                   manufacturing plants. (Exceptions are base exchanges,
                                   commissaries, and other non-appropriated fund
                                   activities.)

condemnation --                       A judicial proceeding started by the government
                                      through the Department of Justice for the purpose of
                                      exercising its right of eminent domain. Condemnation
                                      results in passage of title and land to the government
                                      with or without the consent of the landowner, but with
                                      just compensation paid to him or her.
consideration --                      Compensation or an equivalent (such as money,

                                      acquired or promised. This may be the appraised fair
                                      market value of the real property or may include
                                      protection of the real property against loss by fire,
                                      water, or other causes, or any mutually agreeable
                                      arrangement that does not conflict with governing
                                      statutory limitations.
core requirements --                  Process oriented descriptions which describe the tasks
                                      needed to support Maintenance Engineering.
declaration of taking --              A pleading filed with a federal court of law in a real
                                      property condemnation proceeding whereby, on filing
                                      the pleading, together with deposit of estimated "just
                                      compensation" in the court, the real estate interest is
                                      vested in the government.
declaration of excess --              A narrative description of real property that is no
                                      longer required for foreseeable Air Force missions. The
                                      declaration contains an identification of the land, type
                                      of governmental real estate interest, facility inventory
                                      information, recommended disposal dates, re-use
                                      rights, and services, obligations, and outgrants
                                      outstanding (see AFI 32-9004).
direct scheduled work order --        Emergency or essential work generally not requiring
                                      detailed planning, also known as job orders.
direct digital control --             Any control system (HVAC, alarms, lighting, or
                                      otherwise) using entirely solid-state (digital)
                                      components.
District Engineer --                  One of the several Division Engineers, US Army Corps
                                      of Engineers, who supervise the activities of certain
                                      District Engineers and are the intervening management
                                      level between the Chief of Engineers and District
                                      Engineers (e.g., US Army Engineer Division, North

easement --                        The right to use the land of another for a specified
                                   purpose. Usually, the owners of the land continue in
                                   possession and may use it as long as such use does not
                                   interfere with the purpose for which the easement was
                                   granted. An easement may be acquired for a specific
                                   term or in perpetuity. An easement differs from a
                                   license because: the privilege granted usually cannot be
                                   withdrawn during its term and it is considered to be a
                                   permanent interest in the property if the term exceeds
                                   one year.
emergency work --                  Work that must be accomplished immediately.
eminent domain --                  The right of the government to take private property for
                                   public use upon payment of just compensation.
Energy Conservation Investment     A Military Construction (MILCON)-funded program
Program (ECIP) --                  primarily intended for accomplishing energy
                                   conservation retrofits of existing buildings. It includes
                                   construction of new, high-efficiency energy systems
                                   and modernization of existing systems. ECIP is an
                                   OSD centrally-managed program.
Energy Savings Performance         Contracting with a private sector company for
Contract (ESPC) --                 completion of energy audits and installation of energy
                                   conservation projects. This provides a method to
                                   acquire energy conservation projects with no AF
                                   resources and without payment if savings do not result.
Energy Management Control System   The civil engineer energy control system that
(EMCS) --                          historically manages heating, ventilation, and air
                                   conditioning (HVAC) systems. It differs from direct
                                   digital control in that it includes both solid state
                                   systems and the older pneumatic systems.
engineers --                       Any engineer in Civil Engineer units to include the
                                   Base Civil Engineer, the Maintenance Engineer,
                                   program engineers, and project engineers.
environmental assessment --        A document, occurring early in the planning process,
                                   for evaluating the potential environmental impact of a
                                   proposed action. An assessment covers the same
                                   topical areas as an environmental impact statement
                                   (EIS), but with less detail. An assessment results in a
                                   decision that an EIS is necessary, or that the proposed
                                   action will have no significant effect, therefore, a
                                   finding of no significant impact (FONSI) can be made
                                   (AFI 32-7004).

environmental impact statement --     A detailed full-disclosure report which, pursuant to the
                                      National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969,
                                      (42 U.S.C. 4321-4347), identifies and analyzes the
                                      anticipated environmental impact of a proposed Air
                                      Force action and discusses how the adverse effects of
                                      the proposal will be mitigated. It is prepared in two
                                      stages: a draft statement which is filed with the
                                      Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and made
                                      available to the public for comment and a final
                                      statement which is revised to reflect comments made
                                      on the draft EIS (AFI 32-7004).
essential work --                     Work that cannot wait for the next 1219 visit.

                                      feet on each side of the runway center line extended,
                                      that are incompatible with or could impede, aircraft
                                      operations. For additional guidance see AFI 32-7003.
facility investment metric (FIM) --   An Air Force facilities requirements identification
                                      program to assess facilities based on mission priority;
                                      used to develop funding priorities.
Federal Energy Management             An OSD, centrally-managed program for projects less
Program (FEMP) --                     than $300K. Projects accomplish energy conservation
                                      retrofits of existing buildings or new construction plus
                                      energy audits, designs and metering programs. It
                                      includes construction of new, high-efficiency energy
                                      systems and modernization of existing systems.
fee ownership --                      Title to real property belonging to a person or the
                                      government where full and unconditional ownership
                                      exists. Such ownership does not necessarily include
                                      mineral rights.
floodplain --                         The 100-year floodplain is the lowland area adjoining

                                   Administration (GSA) which GSA has found to be
                                   suitable for use by federal agencies, generally. The
                                   following categories of space are excluded: space in
                                   any building in a foreign country; space in any building
                                   on the grounds of a military or Coast Guard
                                   installation; space in airports; and special purpose
                                   space, as defined in GSA Federal Property
                                   Management Regulations (41 CFR 101, subpart
                                   101-18.104-1).
grantee --                         One to whom a grant is made.
grantor --                         The person by whom a grant is made; a transferor of
                                   property.
GSA reimbursables --               These are special services, beyond the standard levels
                                   of service normally provided by GSA, for which the
                                   Air Force must reimburse GSA.
GSA rent --                        Formerly called "standard level user charge (SLUC)," a

                                      is called a "license.” However, the term also is used to
                                      describe an authorization to use property under the

                                      used to reduce administrative cost and buyer time for
                                      purchasing high usage items such as CEMAS store
                                      stock.
preventative maintenance --           Recurring work performed to safeguard and/or extend

                                   for an ammunition storage project usually involves the
                                   acquisition of fee ownership for the land area used to
                                   construct storage facilities and restrictive easements

                                   Secretary of the Interior through the Bureau of Land
                                   Management without regard as to how the United
                                   States acquired ownership. The term excludes lands
                                   located on the outer Continental Shelf and lands held
                                   for the benefit of Indians, Aleuts, and Eskimos (43

value (current, fair, and estimated) --   As used in this regulation, these terms mean current
                                          fair market value or current fair market rental value, as
                                          appropriate. Fair market value is the amount in cash, or
                                          on terms reasonably equivalent to cash, for which the
                                          property would be sold by an owner, willing but not
                                          obliged to sell, to a purchaser who desires, but is not
                                          obliged, to buy. Fair market rental value of a property
                                          is the amount that, in a competitive market, a
                                          well-informed and willing lessee would pay and that a
                                          well-informed lessor would accept for the use and
                                          occupancy of the property for a particular term.
vault --                                  Storage location of base as-built and Base
                                          Comprehensive Plan drawings, so termed because
                                          many bases originally stored these drawings in a vault
                                          for physical security.
wetlands --                               Areas that are inundated by surface or ground water
                                          with a frequency sufficient to support, and under
                                          normal circumstances do or would support, a
                                          prevalence of vegetative or aquatic life that requires
                                          saturated or seasonally-saturated soil conditions for
                                          growth and reproduction. Wetlands generally include
                                          swamps, marshes, bogs and similar areas such as mud
                                          flats, natural ponds, potholes, river overflows, sloughs,
                                          and wet meadows. Wetlands may be, but are not
                                          necessarily, located in floodplains (AFI 32-7005).
withdrawn land --                         Public land that has been set aside or designated for a
                                          specific public purpose, such as a national park,
                                          wildlife refuge, or national defense use. Withdrawal of
                                          public lands generally has the effect of segregating
                                          such land from lease, sale, settlement, or other
                                          dispositions under the public land laws.
work center(s) --                         Civil Engineering Operations maintenance teams
                                          organized to maintain and repair base facilities and
                                          infrastructure systems. Depending on the installation,
                                          these Centers can be classified as either shops, zones or
                                          a combination of both.
work orders --                            Work requiring detailed planning or capitalization of
                                          the real property records.
