SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This revision updates publication title and updated office symbols. A bar (|) indicates revisions from the
previous edition.


1. Competitive Areas. Each of the following geographical and organizational areas constitutes a sepa-
rate competitive area for all employees located therein who are serviced by the Hill AFB Central Civilian
Personnel Office (CCPO).
   1.1. All activities within a 50 mile radius of Hill AFB.
   1.2. All activities at the Utah Test and Training Range (UTTR) and Dugway, Utah.
   1.3. All activities at Wendover, Utah.
   1.4. Other employees at locations outside the commuting area, such as Weapon System Logistics
   Officer (WSLO), and System Program Offices (SPO). A separate competitive area is set up for these
   employees at each Hill AFB serviced location. If employees cannot be placed in their own competi-
   tive area, their placement will be accomplished in accordance with the provisions of regulations or
   directives which govern the particular program to which they are assigned.
   1.5. Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA).
   1.6. NGB - Human Resources - Western Center Army funded employees.
   1.7. On-Site Inspection Agency (OSIA), Magna, Utah, employees.

2. Identical Additional Positions. When an organization must cancel one of two or more additional
identical positions, the incumbent of the position who has the least retention rights in that organization is
reached for the first round of competition within the competitive level.

3. Ties. Ties in retention standing will first be broken on the basis of employee's total length of time at or
above the current grade level; second, length of time in occupational series; third, length of time in orga-
nization; and fourth, random numbering based on Attachment 1.

4. Validated Vacancy. A vacated position is not considered a vacancy for the purpose of a valid RIF
placement offer until it has been validated by the Classification Branch (75 SPTG/DPCC).

NOTE: By using the last digit of the tied employeesâ€™ social security number (SSN), the SSN closest to
the next random number is the employee affected. (Example - Scale is O 123456789). If SSNs are 3 and
9 and next random number is 1, 9 is.-closer to 1 because you always count up and around from the SSN to
the random number.
