     weather information agencies for and provide weather services to the 49th Wing (49 WG)
     and other units assigned to Holloman AFB, New Mexico. Basic concepts and procedures are
     outlined in the 15-series Air Force and Air Combat Command directives.
     1.1.2. This instruction establishes requirements and procedures for weather support, which
     must be coordinated at the local level to meet mission needs. It consolidates weather support
     requirements and procedures for peacetime operations and eliminates the need for written
     agreements between the weather unit and supported operations. It does not cover weather
     support procedures for emergency war operations or certain other special operations or
     procedures. These are covered in applicable plans and regulations.
1.2. Designators. All weather products disseminated by or for Holloman AFB will use KHMN
as the ICAO location indicator. The World Meteorological Organization index number is
747320.
1.3. Weather Operations.
     1.3.1. The 25 OWS at Davis-Monthan AFB, Arizona provides regional and operational-level
     weather products and information to Air Force and Army units operating in the western
     CONUS. The 25 OWS provides resource protection (by issuing weather warnings, watches,
     and advisories), Terminal Aerodrome Forecasts (TAFs), regional and operational-level
     weather products and information, meteorological watch (METWATCH), limited flight
     weather (DD Form 175-1, Flight Weather Briefing) support, and verbal weather briefings.
     1.3.2. The EU at each Air Force and Army location will focus on providing tactical-level
     weather products and information needed for mission execution and provide weather
     products and information to the commander of deployed forces during wartime, contingency,
     and exercise operations. The EU provides the Mission Execution Forecast (MEF), base
     resource protection, and deployment weather information to the 49 WG and tenant units.
     Primary weather support for transient aircrews will be provided by 25 OWS. EU may
     provide transient aircrew support during duty-hours as time permits.
1.4. Assumptions. Adequate resources and communications will be available to execute this
instruction and sufficient weather data will be available from various sources on which to base
weather operations and production.
1.5. Shortfalls and Limiting Factors. There are several limiting factors included in the
following list. The weather technician’s limited view of the horizon can prevent observation of
some weather phenomena to the south. The automated fixed meteorological equipment (FMQ-
19) cannot determine a ceiling above 25,000 feet and cannot observe tornados, volcanic ash,
snow depth, hail, ice pellets, funnel clouds, or smoke, limiting measurement during automated
procedures. Finally, the high intensity lights northeast of Building 577 and near the softball
HOLLOMANAFBI15-101 19 FEBRUARY 2014                                                              7


fields to the south may restrict the ability to determine sky condition and visibility during hours
of darkness when backup/augmentation procedures are being conducted.
1.6. Duty Priorities. All base EU tasks cannot be accomplished simultaneously. Therefore,
duty priorities are established to ensure tasks are accomplished in order of relative importance
and publicized to avoid misunderstanding among supported agencies. Duty priorities will ensure
timely response to situations under normal conditions. However, the list will not replace good
judgment. The weather technician may deviate in the best interest of flight safety and/or
protection of personnel or property. The weather technician will use the following priority list as
a guide for accomplishing duties.
   1.6.1. Perform Emergency War Order Taskings.
   1.6.2. Perform Facility Evacuation Procedures.
   1.6.3. Respond to Aircraft/Ground Emergencies.
   1.6.4. Provide Products and Services in Support of Combat Operations, Contingency
   Operations, and Military Operations Other Than War (MOOTW).
   1.6.5. Provide Airborne Aircrew Support through Pilot-to-Metro Services (PMSV).
   1.6.6. Notify Supervisor of Flying (SOF) of Imminent Weather Hazards to Airborne
   Aircraft.
   1.6.7. Record and Disseminate Augmented Airfield Weather Observations.
   1.6.8. Disseminate Urgent Pilot Reports (PIREPs) and Special Air Reports (AIREPs).
   1.6.9. Conduct Severe Weather Action Procedure (SWAP) Operations.
   1.6.10. Provide ‘Eyes Forward’ and Collaborate with 25 OWS.
   1.6.11. Produce and Disseminate Mission Execution Forecasts (MEF).
   1.6.12. Disseminate all other PIREPs and AIREPs.
   1.6.13. Perform METWATCH and MISSIONWATCH Activities.
   1.6.14. Provide Transient Aircrew and Other Weather Support Briefings.
   1.6.15. Accomplish Weather Functional Training.
   1.6.16. Accomplish Administrative and Additional Duty Tasks.
1.7. Geographic Area of Responsibility. The area of responsibility for products and services
provided by the EU is the terminal area, which is the area located within a 5 nautical mile radius
around the center of the Holloman airfield complex. The EU will also produce a MEF and
MISSIONWATCH for all areas and routes in which 49 WG and tenant flying units are
conducting operations. This Local Flying Area encompasses much of the state of New Mexico.
1.8. Operating Hours and Contact Information.
   1.8.1. Staff services are available from 0730 local time to 1630, Monday through Friday,
   except federal holidays, ACC, and 49 WG “down-days.”
 8                                           HOLLOMANAFBI15-101 19 FEBRUARY 2014


     1.8.2. Weather technicians are available to provide services at Holloman AFB during local
     flying operations. A technician will be on duty, as required, prior to scheduled missions in
     order to prepare and disseminate MEFs.
     1.8.3. The 25 OWS provides 24/7 weather support to Holloman AFB and transient aircrews.
     It becomes the primary weather support agency when the EU is off duty.
     1.8.4. During non-duty hours there is one EU member on standby to receive weather
     information from the 25 OWS via Command Post to determine if the Severe Weather
     Management Team (SWMT) needs to be activated, and to respond to urgent requests or
     troubleshoot meteorological equipment.
     1.8.5. The EU can be contacted at DSN 572-3924/3925 or Commercial (575) 572-
     3924/3925. The standby person can be contacted at Commercial (575) 430-2024. If a
     forecaster can’t be reached by the previous numbers, contact can also be made through the
     Command Post DSN 572-7575 or Commercial (575) 572-7575. The 25 OWS can be
     contacted at DSN 228-7653, Commercial (520) 228-7653.
1.9. Joint Environmental Toolkit (JET2). JET2 is the primary weather data dissemination
system on Holloman AFB. All required agencies will have access to the JET2 portal and
running at all times, so they automatically receive weather updates as they occur. ATC Tower,
Airfield Operations, and RAPCON use AFAS as the primary weather data dissemination system.
1.10. Base Weather Station Evacuation. If the EU is required to evacuate the base weather
station (Building 577 at 1148 Rescue Road), the team will relocate to the alternate operating
location (AOL), building 302 at 1022 Fifth Street. The EU can be contacted at DSN 572-4015 or
Commercial (575) 572-4015
     1.10.1. The 25 OWS will assume the following duties until the EU resumes operations:
        1.10.1.1. Perform METWATCH and MISSIONWATCH for 49 WG and tenant unit
        operations and issue all terminal and flying area weather warnings and advisories to the
        best of their ability. Since the 25 OWS is limited to cloud-to-ground strike data from the
        National Lightning Detection Network, it does not have the capability to detect or
        observe other lightning strike occurrences (e.g., cloud-to-cloud lightning).
        1.10.1.2. Mission Execution Forecast. If the EU is unable to produce MEFs from the
        alternate site, the 25 OWS will produce and update the MEFs for the 49 WG and tenant
        units using their standard format. The MEFs will be posted on the 25 OWS website
        under        the      Unit     Tailored     Pages      link     (HOME       PAGE):
        https://ows.dm.af.mil/index.cfm?fuseaction=main&bandwidth=H&aor=2&aoi=1).
        1.10.1.3. The 25 OWS will assume responsibility for all other flight weather MEFs for
        missions departing Holloman AFB and conduct limited MISSIONWATCH for these
        flights.
     1.10.2. Upon arrival at the AOL, the EU will standup operations and notify the 25 OWS, Air
     Traffic Control (ATC), Radar Approach Control (RAPCON), Command Post, and all
     Holloman AFB flying units that the EU has resumed operations at the AOL.
     1.10.3. The weather technician will provide the following services from the AOL:
HOLLOMANAFBI15-101 19 FEBRUARY 2014                                                           9


       1.10.3.1. If the FMQ-19 is not operational, weather elements included in surface weather
       observations will obtained using the Kestrel or other back-up equipment. Surface
       weather observations will be disseminated using primary dissemination methods (JET2).
       If primary dissemination methods are not available, observations will be disseminated
       using back-up procedures on the Air Force Weather Web Services (AFW-WEBS) or
       through the 25 OWS. An observation will be taken within 15 minutes of arriving at the
       AOL containing, as a minimum, prevailing visibility, present weather and obscurations,
       sky condition, wind direction and speed, temperature and dewpoint, and altimeter setting.
       1.10.3.2. Continue to issue and update MEFs if the capability exists. The MEF will
       continue to be updated on the EU webpage if possible (SHAREPOINT):
       https://holloman.eim.acc.af.mil/Weather/default.aspx). If the webpage is inaccessible,
       the MEF will be faxed or emailed to the flying units.
       1.10.3.3. Provide METWATCH for Holloman AFB from the AOL. Weather warnings,
       watches, and advisories will be disseminated by the 25 OWS or by phone or fax if JET2
       is non-operational.
       1.10.3.4. Brief aircrews and MISSIONWATCH.
   1.10.4. PMSV radio support will not be available from the AOL. The EU will request that
   ATC monitor the frequency and relay any PMSV contacts to Cannon AFB at 343.1.
   1.10.5. Timeliness and accuracy of services provided from the AOL will suffer due to
   limited communications and use of backup equipment.
1.11. Backup Weather Support. If weather operations at 25 OWS are interrupted (e.g., power
outage, natural disaster), the 25 OWS will contact the EU. The Holloman AFB Terminal
Aerodrome Forecast (TAF), weather watch, weather warning, and weather advisory
responsibility will be transferred to the EU until such time the 25 OWS is postured to resume
operations. Responsibility for other 25 OWS products (e.g., graphical products) will be
transferred to other agencies as necessary to continue weather information flow to Holloman
AFB customers.
1.12. Release of Weather Information. Support to non-DoD agencies and the general public
will not be provided unless the Wing Public Affairs Office has provided permission.
 10                                           HOLLOMANAFBI15-101 19 FEBRUARY 2014


                                            Chapter 2

                              AIRFIELD SERVICES ELEMENT

2.1. Terminal Aerodrome Forecast (TAF).
   2.1.1. Weather technicians at the 25 OWS will prepare and disseminate a TAF via JET2 at
   0400, 1200, and 2000 Zulu time and cover a 30-hour period. See Attachment 7 for code
   breakdown. A TAF is produced primarily for transient aircraft support.
   2.1.2. Specification and Amendment Criteria. The TAF Specification and Amendment
   criteria are listed in Attachment 3 and are specified IAW AFMAN 15-129, V1.
   2.1.3. Dissemination. The 25 OWS will disseminate the TAF via JET2. If JET2 is
   inoperative, TAFs will be disseminated telephonically by the EU to ATC, SOF, and
   Command Post during EU duty hours.
2.2. Basic Weather Watch (BWW). BWW will be conducted using the automated fixed
meteorological equipment (FMQ-19). The FMQ-19 updates weather conditions every minute
24/7 and produces Aviation Routine Weather Reports (METARs) and Aviation Selected Special
Weather Reports (SPECIs) in accordance with AFMAN 15-111, Surface Weather Observations,
and local documented criteria. METAR, SPECI, or Aviation Local Weather Reports (LOCAL)
observations will be generated at least every 60 minutes during duty hours.
   2.2.1. The FMQ-19 may be augmented during duty hours when the weather technician feels
   augmentation is necessary to accurately support local flying.
   2.2.2. When a reliable source (ATC personnel, pilots, law enforcement, etc.) reports weather
   conditions different from the last report, weather personnel will recheck the weather and, if
   required, disseminate a new observation and log out the FMQ-19 if needed.
2.3. Continuous Weather Watch (CWW) Concept. The weather technician will transition to
a CWW (in lieu of the BWW) when severe weather is occurring or forecast to occur. Severe
weather includes, hail greater than ½ inch, tornados, hurricanes, flooding, snow fall greater than
2 inches in 12 hrs, and winds 50 knots or greater. The weather technician monitors conditions
more frequently than every 20 minutes during severe weather or conditions impacting flying
operations. Weather personnel will augment the FMQ-19 for hail, ice pellets, tornados, funnel
clouds, volcanic ash, smoke, and snow depth during flight operations and/or when the SWMT is
activated for base resource protection. Additionally, during flight operations, the weather
technicians will increase awareness of the current weather situation to determine if augmentation
of the automated observations is required when terminal conditions fall below 3,000 foot ceilings
and 3 statute miles visibility. Under these circumstances, the technician’s primary job is to
monitor changing conditions, and coordinate and disseminate weather watches and warnings.
2.4. Cooperative Weather Watch. A Cooperative Weather Watch is the name given for the
cooperation between weather personnel and control tower operators in identifying significant
weather changes. The primary concern is the occurrence of previously unreported weather
conditions that could affect flight safety or could be critical to the safety or efficiency of other
local operations and resources. Due to the weather technician’s limited view of the horizon from
building obstructions, tower personnel will notify the weather technician of the occurrence of
previously unreported weather conditions. These include prevailing visibility which meets
HOLLOMANAFBI15-101 19 FEBRUARY 2014                                                           11


special criteria as listed in Attachment 2, sector visibilities which differ from prevailing
visibility, beginning or ending of precipitation, thunderstorms, lightning, and any other
significant weather. The assistance provided by tower personnel will not interfere with their
primary duties and does not reduce the responsibility of weather personnel to identify changes in
weather conditions. Tower personnel will notify the 25 OWS Holloman AFB forecaster of
unreported weather conditions during EU non-duty hours. When the tower reports weather
conditions different from the last disseminated observation, the weather technician will
reevaluate the weather conditions. Based on reevaluation of the different weather conditions
reported and local policy, the technician will:
   2.4.1. Begin supplementing augmentation to take and disseminate a SPECI observation if
   different conditions warrant immediate dissemination.
   2.4.2. Include the report of the differing conditions in the next METAR or SPECI
   observation if the different conditions alone do not warrant immediate dissemination and the
   Automated Meteorological Observing System (AMOS) report differs significantly.
2.5. ‘Eyes Forward. ’
   2.5.1. The EU integrates weather radar data, meteorological satellite imagery, lightning
   detection display, and non-standard weather data systems to create an integrated weather
   picture and near-term trend forecast for the 25 OWS. ‘Eyes forward’ yields meaningful
   meteorological information not contained in coded observations to the 25 OWS and is an
   integral part of the METWATCH for Holloman AFB. The EU will provide ‘eyes forward’ to
   the 25 OWS during EU duty hours.
   2.5.2. The EU will provide the ‘eyes forward’ function by providing significant information
   to the 25 OWS concerning local area weather patterns and un-forecasted changes. The EU
   will contact the 25 OWS when:
       2.5.2.1. Severe weather signatures on radar displays or METSAT imagery are identified
       that will affect the Holloman AFB installation or mission.
       2.5.2.2. Warning/advisory criteria are occurring or forecast to occur and the 25 OWS has
       yet to issue the warning/advisory. The EU will also contact the 25 OWS when
       warning/advisory criteria are forecast by the 25 OWS and are not expected to occur.
       2.5.2.3. When weather phenomena are forecast to occur (next 30 minutes) and these
       phenomena will affect the 25 OWS and/or EU products (i.e., TAFs and MEFs). The EU
       will also contact the 25 OWS when significant forecast elements on 25 OWS products are
       not expected to occur. This communication is necessary to help the 25 OWS technicians
       anticipate changes and subsequently adjust forecast products.
       2.5.2.4. When surface observations or other information (e.g., PIREPs) cause the 25
       OWS-issued TAFs for Holloman AFB to be "out of category" or weather information
       indicates EU-issued MEFs will cross operational thresholds.
2.6. Surface Observations.
   2.6.1. The official observation for Holloman Air Force Base is taken by the FMQ-19 which
   is located within the intersection of runways 16 and 22. The discontinuity sensor group at
   the approach end of runway 34 measures winds, visibility, and ceiling. Winds and ceiling are
   also measured at the approach ends of runways 25 and the 04/07 intersection. An additional
 12                                           HOLLOMANAFBI15-101 19 FEBRUARY 2014


   wind sensor takes measurements at the midfield intersection of runways 34/16 and 07/25.
   The FMQ-19 has no weather limitations due to its location on the airfield. The FMQ-19 does
   have limitations on what it can observe; the FMQ-19 cannot determine a ceiling above
   25,000 feet and it cannot observe tornados, volcanic ash, snow depth, hail, ice pellets, funnel
   clouds, or smoke. A known error in precipitation reports can occur when high winds persist.
   2.6.2. When augmentation is required (supplementation or backup), the EU technician goes
   to the manual observation point approximately 30 feet north of the northeast corner of
   Building 577. The field of view from this point is significantly limited due to buildings and
   parked aircraft. The point of manual observation does not allow a clear, unobstructed view
   of the entire runway complex. Weather technicians may compensate for this by walking
   around Building 577 while taking observations. This process may cause short delays during
   periods of rapidly changing conditions. High intensity lights northeast of Building 577 and
   near the softball fields to the south may restrict the ability to determine sky condition and
   visibility during hours of darkness.
   2.6.3. Operational Risk Management dictates additional supplementation criteria for the
   FMQ-19 automated observations when the airfield services section is on duty.
       2.6.3.1. The mandatory supplementation criteria from AFMAN 15-111 are tornado,
       funnel cloud, waterspout, hail > or equal to 3/4'”, volcanic ash, sandstorm, dust storm,
       visibility less than ¼ mile, and snow depth when the airfield is open.
       2.6.3.2. In addition to the mandatory supplementation criteria, the weather technician
       may also supplement the observation when there is blowing dust that causes erroneous
       ceilings below 3000’ and visibility less than 3 miles, erroneous precipitation readings,
       measurements during prolonged wind events, when thunder is observed but not in
       automated observation, whenever lighting is within 10 NM, and any time the automated
       observation is in error and could impact operations.
2.7. Dissemination of Observations. The FMQ-19 can automatically send/disseminate weather
observations through Joint Environmental Toolkit (JET2). The weather technician can augment
the FMQ-19 observation in JET2 and then disseminate observations over JET2. All METAR
and SPECI observations produced by the FMQ-19 will include wind, visibility, sky condition,
temperature, dew point, altimeter setting, remarks, pressure altitude, and density altitude. Code
breakdown is in Attachment 7. Runway Visual Range (RVR) will be automatically included
when visibility is one mile or less, and/or the RVR is 6,000 ft or less. Meteorological equipment,
tower reports, and pilot reports are all used in determining surface visibility and sky conditions.
See attachment 2 for special observation criteria.
2.8. Backup Dissemination. If JET2 is inoperative, observations will be disseminated verbally
to ATC, RAPCON, SOF, Command Post, and Airfield Management Operations. The
observation will be disseminated long-line through 25 OWS, AFW-WEBS, another EU, or the
National Weather Service (NWS).
2.9. Tropical Cyclone Products. The EU will use the Tropical Cyclone Threat Assessment
Products produced by the responsible OWS (derived from National Hurricane Center or Joint
Typhoon Warning Center) to provide EU customers forecasts of the expected onset, intensity,
end times of significant winds, and closest point of approach for the associated tropical cyclone.
HOLLOMANAFBI15-101 19 FEBRUARY 2014                                                   13


No deviation from the official forecast position, track, movement, maximum wind speed, or
intensity trend is authorized.

3.3. MISSIONWATCH.
  3.3.1. The EU will conduct a continuous MISSIONWATCH of all routes and flying areas
  used by Holloman flying units during the times they are using them. The EU will provide the
  Supervisor of Flying (SOF) and flying units updates for weather affecting airfield operations
  and area missions via the MEF and phone notification. MISSIONWATCH criteria will be
  based off of aircraft sensitivities and mission requirements. If weather conditions change and
  an amendment MEF is needed (due to changes in cloud heights, hazards, flight winds,
  forecasts at alternate bases, or any condition that affects aircraft weather thresholds), re-
  accomplish the MEF and re-issue as an amendment. The amendment will be posted to the
  Base Weather SharePoint Site. During emergency situations or rapidly changing conditions,
  the EU will immediately notify the SOF and all affected flying units. The SOF may be a
  member of the 49 WG, the German Air Force Flight Training Center (GAF FTC), or the 46
  Test Group (46 TG). If the 46 TG is conducting SOF duties when the 49 WG and GAF are
  not conducting flight operations, their duty location is the 586 FLTS Ops Desk with contact
  performed at 572-1222 and not through the SOF Hotline.
  3.3.2. Flying Unit Points of Contact. All the flying units maintain an operations desk where
  they can be contacted for any significant changes in the observation or amendments in the
  forecast as shown in Table 3.1.

3.4. Flight Weather Brief. The EU will provide flight weather briefings verbally or using the
DD Form 175-1 to all assigned aircraft, transient aircraft (during duty hours if time permits), and
aircraft contacted through Pilot-Metro Service via an Airfield Management phone patch. If duty
priorities preclude timely completion of the briefing, an OWS or home-station EU can be utilized
for support as decided upon by the aircrew.
3.5. Pilot-to-Metro Service (PMSV). During duty hours, the EU will provide full service
PMSV on the assigned frequency of 346.55 MHz through Airfield Management or Tower via
phone patch. Aircrews are highly encouraged to relay pilot reports during phone patches or
through the SOF. The Air Traffic Control Tower will monitor 346.55 MHz for attempts to
contact Holloman Metro and inform airborne contacts of the closest alternate PMSV location and
frequency, to include Cannon AFB at 343.1 or Kirtland AFB at 342.3. A Notice to Airmen
(NOTAM) has been issued through Airfield Management indicating the PMSV outage at
Holloman AFB.
3.6. Space Weather Support. Space weather products will be provided, as requested, from the
Space Weather Products section located under ‘Product Manager’ through AF-WEBS.
3.7. Toxic Corridors. The EU will provide the 49 CES/CEX with weather information so they
can calculate toxic corridors for chemical spills. The EU will not be responsible for producing
toxic corridors.
3.8. Chemical Downwind and Effective Downwind Messages. The EU will provide Chemical
Downwind and Effective Downwind Messages upon request for disaster response,
chemical/nuclear attack, and exercise purposes.

4.1. Installation Staff Meetings. The EU will present a briefing at the Installation Staff
Meeting. The content of the briefing is flexible but will include a current satellite picture, a 5-
day forecast for Holloman AFB, and a stoplight operational impacts slide.
4.2. Installation Command Center/Commander’s Senior Staff. The EU will provide weather
briefings to the Installation Command Center and Wing Commander’s Senior Staff as necessary.
The format of the briefing will be tailored to the scenario driving the meeting. The briefing may
include the current weather, 5-day outlook for Holloman AFB, en route weather and hazards, and
forecast destination weather.
4.3. Deployment Concept Briefing. The EU will provide a briefing at all Deployment Concept
Briefings as stated in the Installation Deployment Plan. The focus of this briefing will be on
departure conditions and deployed area conditions and climatology. As a minimum, the briefing
will include forecast conditions at Holloman AFB for departure time, deployed area
climatological conditions, and forecast conditions for destination arrival time. Other topics will
be briefed as required.
4.4. Instrument Refresher Course (IRC). A EU representative will provide a local weather
effects briefing to all IRC classes for host and tenant units. IRC schedulers will provide the EU
with a schedule of upcoming IRCs as early in the process as possible.
4.5. Climatology Support. Climatology data will be available upon request including data for
other locations. Requests should be made at least two duty days in advance in order to allow the
EU to research and compile the data.
4.6. Air Traffic Control Training/Orientation. The EU will provide orientation, training, and
certification for ATC personnel on METAR code, TAF code, and visibility determination.
Training/certification will be conducted Monday-Friday, between the hours of 0800-1600L, upon
coordination with the EU.
4.7. Meteorological Subject Matter Experts (SMEs). EU personnel will support any
meteorological request as duty priorities permit. Requests from outside the DoD will be
coordinated through Public Affairs.

                              METEOROLOGICAL WATCH

5.1. General.
   5.1.1. The 25 OWS and the EU will jointly monitor observed and forecast weather
   conditions and notify selected agencies when pre-established weather condition criteria, as
   seen in Tables 5.1.-5.6., occur or are expected to occur.
   5.1.2. Desired Lead Time (DLT). Advanced warning of threatening weather conditions
   allows local agencies to take specific actions prior to occurrence. The desired lead-time is
   the minimum amount of advanced notice an agency requires prior to the onset of a particular
   weather phenomenon.
   5.1.3. All weather watches, warnings, and advisories are issued IAW AFMAN 15-129 V1 &
   V2. Warnings and advisories may be issued as forecasted or observed.
   5.1.4. The EU may issue or supersede a 25 OWS-issued weather warning only when
   imminent weather conditions pose a hazard to life or property and prior coordination with 25
   OWS is not practical or communications do not allow. The EU will be responsible for local
   dissemination and contact the 25 OWS as soon as possible afterward so the 25 OWS can
   assume responsibility/accountability.
5.2. Responsibilities.
   5.2.1. The 25 OWS will produce, disseminate, and maintain all weather watches, weather
   warnings, and weather advisories as outlined in the tables below.
   5.2.2. The EU will:
       5.2.2.1. Perform an ‘eyes forward’ function during duty hours.
       5.2.2.2. Assist with METWATCH for the Holloman AFB terminal area and advise the
       25 OWS when hazardous conditions could affect Holloman AFB, or pose a hazard to life
       or property, are observed or expected to occur.
       5.2.2.3. Issue weather warning and advisories during duty hours as outlined in the tables
       below.
       5.2.2.4. When a weather technician is on duty, the EU will notify the 25 OWS when
       local MISSIONWATCH indicates a 25 OWS-issued watch, warning, or advisory is, or
       may become, unrepresentative of current or expected weather conditions.
   5.2.3. The Command Post will:
       5.2.3.1. Monitor weather information disseminated over JET2.
       5.2.3.2. Disseminate weather watches, warnings, and advisories to required agencies.
       5.2.3.3. When called by the 25 OWS or the EU, acknowledge receipt of the weather
       watch, warning, or advisory. The 25 OWS and EU should not have to read the text of the
       weather watch, warning, or advisory to the Command Post unless their JET2 is not
       working.

Note: Asterisked items (*) indicate variation from AFMAN 15-129V1 & V2. Identified items
(#) indicate Severe Weather Action Procedure Criteria (Section 5.8.).
     5.4.2. Observed Weather Warnings. The EU will issue an observed weather warning for
     events within 5 NM of Holloman AFB runway complex or within 10 NM of either north or
     south end of the High Speed Test Track (HSTT) when the criteria defined in Table 5.3.
     occurs. The 25 OWS will issue the warning when the EU is closed. However, since 25
     OWS is limited to cloud-to-ground strike data from the National Lightning Detection
     Network, it does not have the capability to detect or observe other lightning strike
     occurrences (e.g., cloud-to-cloud lightning).

11 Fighter Index of Thermal Stress (FITS) changes in category to Caution, Observed
   Danger or Cancel (FITS chart is in attachment 8)

5.6. Dissemination of Watches/Warnings/Advisories. All weather WWAs will be
disseminated using JET2. When the EU is open, the EU will contact the ATC Tower, RAPCON,
SOF, Command Post, and Airfield Management to confirm WWA receipt. If the JET2 is
inoperative during EU duty hours, the EU will contact the same agencies to disseminate WWAs.
The Command Post and Airfield Management will disseminate information to the agencies listed
in attachment 4. During EU non-duty hours, Airfield Management and/or Command Post are the
sole agencies initiating WWA notification once they receive the WWA from the OWS via JET
and telephone.
5.7. Weather Warning/Watch/Advisory Text Format. The text of weather warnings,
watches, and advisories will contain the warning/watch/advisory number, the specific valid time
period (or “until further notice” for observed warnings or advisories), and specific conditions
expected. They will be numbered consecutively with the # of the month, and the # of the
warning. For example, the first warning issued in March will be #3-1; the next is #3-2. A watch
for potential lightning or a warning for observed lightning is the only criterion that will be issued
separately from other watch/warning criteria. More than one advisory may be in effect at the
same time. The following additional requirements apply to watches/warnings issued for criteria
other than potential/observed lightning.
    5.7.1. Only one watch or warning will be in effect at a time (other than potential/observed
    lightning), and it will include all elements meeting watch/warning criteria.
    5.7.2. Watches/warnings issued to add or delete a weather phenomenon (for example, adding
    hail greater than or equal to 3/4 inch to an existing warning for winds greater than or equal to
    50 knots) will include the explanation “This warning upgrades/downgrades Weather Warning
    # (previous warning)”.

Figure 5.1. Upgrades/Downgrades Weather Warnings.




   5.7.3. WWAs issued to extend the valid time will not be re-issued or re-numbered. These
   will include the explanation in the format “This is an extension of Weather Warning #
   (current warning)”.
   5.7.4. When the weather technician believes that phenomena meeting WWA criteria are no
   longer expected during the valid time, they will be canceled with the explanation in the
   format “Weather Warning # (current warning) is canceled”. See attachment 5 for
   dissemination formats.
5.8. Severe Weather Action Procedures (SWAP). These procedures are in place to ensure
sufficient personnel are available during potential/actual severe weather events or during
meteorological/operational events critical to mission success. For the purposes of these
procedures severe weather is defined as any weather phenomenon considered critical enough by
the customer to require advance/special notice and subsequent actions to prevent serious injury
or damage to personnel, property, or resources. These procedures document a two-tier system
with the EU and the 25 OWS sharing responsibilities for SWAP and resource protection.
   5.8.1. EU Responsibilities. The EU will perform the EU SWAP responsibilities as defined
   in AFMAN 15-129V2, AFI 10-229, AFI 10-206, Operational Reporting, and this document.
   More specifically, the EU will accomplish the following procedures:

Terms
Actual Lead-time—The elapsed time between issue time of a watch, warning, or advisory and
the first occurrence of the event.
Aircraft Mishap—Term used to denote any event resulting in damage to, or destruction of any
aircraft to include lightning strikes, inadvertent departure from the paved runway or taxiway
surface, aircraft or Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE) fires, and forced landings due to in-
flight emergencies.
Amendment (AMD)—Used as a message modifier when transmitting an aerodrome forecast
amendment.
Climatology—The historical records of weather conditions measured or observed at a specific
location is known as climatology. Some data goes back over 100 years, but generally, a 10- to
25-year history is more common. Climatology is useful in planning operations beyond 5 to 7
days. It usually describes the average (or mean) conditions such as high and low temperatures
and extremes.
Desired Lead-time (DLT)—-The amount of advance notice a supported agency desires before
the onset of a particular weather phenomenon.
‘Eyes Forward’—-EU technicians are the ‘eyes forward’ for the technicians in the Operational
Weather Squadron (OWS) and integrate weather radar data, meteorological satellite imagery,
lightning detection readouts, and non-standard weather data systems (vertical profilers, mesonet
data, etc.) to create an integrated weather picture and near-term trend forecasts for the OWS.
‘Eyes forward’ yields meaningful meteorological information not contained in coded observation
to the servicing OWS and is an integral part of the meteorological watch for an installation or
contingency operating location.

Issue Time—-The time when an agency is notified of a watch, warning, or advisory. When
more than one agency is notified, the issue time is the time the last agency is notified. Follow-up
notifications are not considered when determining issue time.
Joint Environmental Toolkit (JET)—Replacement computer system for N-TFS.
LOCAL Observation—-An unscheduled observation taken when specific local criteria are met.
All LOCALs shall be made as soon as possible after the relevant criteria are observed. These
reports are not transmitted long-line.
METAR Observation—Meteorological Aviation Report. A routine scheduled surface weather
observation. It contains a report of wind, visibility, runway visual range, present weather, sky
condition, temperature, dew point, and altimeter setting. In addition, significant remarks are
appended to the METAR observation.
METWATCH—Monitoring aerospace weather for a route, area, or terminal and advising
concerned organizations when phenomena that could affect their operations or pose a hazard to
life or property are occurring or about to occur.
Mission Execution Forecast (MEF)—-A customized weather product providing terrestrial and
space weather data and forecasts for a specific mission, or set of missions. It fully integrates
aerospace weather with the customer’s tactics, weapon systems, environmental sensitivities of
equipment, and other operational requirements.

Severe Thunderstorm—-A thunderstorm that produces hail greater than or equal to ¾ inch in
diameter and/or surface wind greater than or equal to 50 knots.
Severe Weather—-Any weather condition that poses a hazard to property or life.
SPECI Observation—An unscheduled observation produced when changes in weather elements
meet special criteria. All SPECIs shall be made as soon as possible after the relevant criteria are
observed.

Terminal Aerodrome Forecast (TAF)--A weather forecast prepared by the 25th Operational
Weather Squadron (OWS) composed of required weather elements for Holloman AFB airfield
and covers a 24-hour period. Forecast elements in the body of the forecast text refer to the area
within 5 SM of the center of the aerodrome complex. Operationally significant elements outside
this area are included in remarks (e.g., TS OMTNS or VCTS). The term VC (vicinity) refers to
the area between 5 SM and 10 SM of the aerodrome complex.

A8.5. Comments: This chart applies only to lightweight flight clothing to include COMBAT
EDGE equipment and Chemical Defense (CD) training gear. CD training in the caution and
danger zones should be limited to wear of flight helmet, CD mask, filter pack/blower, and
Nomex flight gloves. Every effort should be taken to limit direct exposure to high temperatures
by keeping the aircraft sheltered for as long as possible and cooling the cockpit as much and
soon as possible. Observe the following general hot-weather precautions: (1) Allow time for
acclimatization to hot weather; avoid extreme efforts on the first several days of exposure. (2)
Drink more water than thirst dictates; water intake is vital to sweat secretion, the body’s main
defense against heat.
