                                                 Chapter 1

                                   PLANNING AND PROGRAMMING

1.1. Purpose. This chapter implements laws, incorporates DoD and Air Force policies, and provides
basic guidance unique to family housing (FH) planning, programming, design and construction. The FH
program is different from other facilities programs in statutory authorities, policy directions, budget and
funding requirements and type of construction. It has its unique rules, limitations, and restrictions in plan-
ning, programming, budgeting, and execution that are different from other military construction and real
property operation and maintenance (O&M) programs.

1.2. Program Overview:
   1.2.1. Acquisition programs include:
       1.2.1.1. New and replacement construction.
       1.2.1.2. Domestic leasing.
       1.2.1.3. Foreign leasing.
       1.2.1.4. Private-sector financing (FH Privatization).
       1.2.1.5. No-cost acquisition.
       1.2.1.6. Interservice transfer.
   1.2.2. Other programs include:
       1.2.2.1. Improvement (including minor improvements).
       1.2.2.2. Maintenance and Repair (M&R) (including minor alterations).
       1.2.2.3. Restoration or replacement for damaged or destroyed housing.
       1.2.2.4. Disposal of surplus housing.

1.3. Planning Policy:
   1.3.1. Air Force Family Housing Master Plan (FHMP). The Air Force FHMP is a corporate plan
   that provides a prioritized investment strategy for providing adequate homes through the Military
   Housing Privatization Initiative (MHPI), traditional construction programs, and O&M funding. An
   intensive investigative process is accomplished at each installation, which defines their housing
   requirement by considering the local community’s ability to provide housing support, and assessing
   the condition and requirements for upgrading any required on-base housing. The results identify
   whether the most cost-effective investment option is privatization or continued use of traditional FH
   construction and O&M funding. Office of The Civil Engineer Programs Division (AF/A7CP) and
   Office of The Civil Engineer, Asset Management Division, Housing Branch (AF/A7CAH) use the Air
   Force FHMP to prepare budget submissions, and to prioritize and allocate housing program funds for
   the following program requirements: privatization scored-costs (P-711/P-713); new/replacement
   (P-711); improvement (P-713); operations (P-721); leasing (P-723/P-724/P-725/P-726) M&R
   (P-722); privatization (P-727) and utilities (P-728).
6                                                                          AFI32-6002 15 JANUARY 2008


    1.3.2. Installation Family Housing Master Plans (IFHMP). Bases and MAJCOMs, in conjunction
    with AF/A7CAH, are responsible for developing IFHMPs. IFHMPs are consolidated to produce the
    Air Force FHMP. To develop the IFHMPs, MAJCOMs and bases use Housing Requirements and
    Market Analyses (HRMA), Housing Community Profiles (HCP), Family Housing Analysis Check-
    book Tool (FHACT), and a privatization decision analysis. The IFHMP makes a preliminary assess-
    ment for privatization potential considering the costs to provide required housing that meets modern
    standards. Privatization is generally selected if the installation is located in the United States or its ter-
    ritories and meets economic criteria listed in the IFHMP. If privatization is not selected, requirements
    are met through the traditional FH construction (new, replacement and improvement) program. The
    IFHMP is updated every 2 years and funded by AF/A7CAH.
    1.3.3. Housing Requirements and Market Analysis (HRMA). Consistent with Office of the Sec-
    retary of Defense (OSD) policy, installations must rely on local community housing first and may
    only provide FH to maintain a minimum FH requirement (floor housing requirement) and to compen-
    sate for shortfalls of adequate, affordable housing in the local housing market.
        1.3.3.1. MAJCOMs and bases, in conjunction with AF/A7CAH:
            1.3.3.1.1. Perform an HRMA to ensure plans are made to only replace, improve, construct, or
            acquire units the Air Force needs.
            1.3.3.1.2. Comply with the Housing Requirements and Market Analysis (HRMA) Guidance
            Manual and supplemental policy guidance.
            1.3.3.1.3. Support projects with HRMAs that are less than 4 years old to identify housing
            requirement.
        1.3.3.2. AF/A7CAH funds HRMA updates every 4 years, or as necessary.
    1.3.4. Housing Community Profile (HCP) Requirements. MAJCOMs and bases, under direction
    and guidance of AF/A7CAH, must develop an HCP to construct, replace, improve, maintain, repair,
    and dispose of surplus FH facilities.
        1.3.4.1. HCPs must include:
            1.3.4.1.1. Floor plan concepts for improvement of existing unit types.
            1.3.4.1.2. Projected program requirements.
            1.3.4.1.3. Plans for land use as defined in the Installation General Plan.
            1.3.4.1.4. Uses for existing housing inventory.
            1.3.4.1.5. Housing community areas such as playgrounds and parks.
            1.3.4.1.6. Housing infrastructure and support facilities.
            1.3.4.1.7. Requirements data based on the most current HRMA.
            1.3.4.1.8. Disposal plan for surplus housing units.
            1.3.4.1.9. Condition assessment matrix (CAM) scores.
            1.3.4.1.10. Sustainment requirement for existing units.
            1.3.4.1.11. Improvement/replacement analysis.
AFI32-6002 15 JANUARY 2008                                                                             7


         1.3.4.1.12. Replacement concepts and costs.
         1.3.4.1.13. Investment (Improvement and Replacement Phasing Plan).
         1.3.4.1.14. Privatization investment strategy.
     1.3.4.2. AF/A7CAH funds HCP updates every 4 years. Tabletop updates may be completed on an
     interim basis (every 2 years) or as necessary when major mission or execution delays occur.
     1.3.4.3. An HCP may not be developed for bases where the housing inventory is fully privatized.
     A limited HCP (up to 50 percent submittal) may be prepared for a base to be fully privatized if the
     limited HCP is required to develop the privatization project concept.
  1.3.5. Family Housing Analysis Checkbook Tool (FHACT). The FHACT is a tool to collect finan-
  cial and programmatic data to support the FHMP. MAJCOMs and bases identify and provide Future
  Years Defense Program (FYDP) cost estimates associated with the O&M of government owned and
  leased units, and for specific costs of managing privately owned units. These estimates include man-
  agement, services, furnishings, utilities, leases, privatization, and routine, emergency and change in
  occupancy maintenance and repair (M&R).
  1.3.6. Privatization Decision Analysis. The IFHMP is a tool to screen installations for privatization
  consideration by estimating privatization costs with an Air Force pro forma (for feasibility) and an
  economic analysis (EA) (for practicality) (AFI 65-501, Economic Analysis).
  1.3.7. General Officer Quarters (GOQ) Master Plan. The Air Force developed the GOQ Master
  Plan to ensure MAJCOMs and bases appropriately plan, program and budget for the GOQ require-
  ment. The plan contains an individual facility profile (IFP) for each GOQ, which captures facility con-
  dition data, identifies major and minor M&R requirements, and provides recommendations and cost
  estimates for each GOQ based on a whole-house perspective. The IFP is incorporated into the HCP
  and FHMP.
     1.3.7.1. GOQ construction, replacement, and improvement are programmed within revitalization
     projects already identified in FHMP and must be based on the GOQ Master Plan. MAJCOMs and
     bases will program GOQ M&R, and investment requirements as whole-house improvement
     (P-713) or replacement (P-711) projects. Bases must comply with the requirements identified in
     the IFP or seek approval from AF/A7CAH to deviate.
     1.3.7.2. Bases must prepare an annual 5-year plan to budget for GOQ costs, which must be sup-
     ported by the IFP.
     1.3.7.3. If necessary, GOQ operation, maintenance, and repair (OMR) may also be accomplished
     with P-721 and P-722 funds. Congress has established an annual GOQ OMR threshold of
     $35,000. The sum of management (P721.1), services (P-721.2), furnishings (P-721.4), miscella-
     neous (P-721.5) and M&R (P-722) annual expenditures for a GOQ cannot exceed $35,000 with-
     out prior notification to Congress. If total OMR costs will exceed the threshold, notification to
     Congress must be submitted in advance of the work being performed (paragraph 1.15.3.1.).
     1.3.7.4. Major M&R and minor alteration work must be supported by recommendations in the
     IFP. Out-of-cycle requests for such work may be submitted only when the work is for safety,
     health, or security purposes and so urgent and compelling that it cannot wait for the next annual
     budget submission. Out-of-cycle security requests must be supported by the installation Joint Staff
     Integrated Vulnerability Assessment (JSIVA).

       1.3.7.5. Refer to the General Officer Quarters Guide, Volumes 1 and 2, and AFI 32-6003, General
       Officer Quarters, for additional policies and guidance for GOQs.
    1.3.8. Surplus Housing:
       1.3.8.1. Dispose of surplus inadequate housing in accordance with (IAW) the HCP and the FHMP
       disposal plan. Requirements for approval of disposal/divestitures of FH units are provided in AFI
       32-6001, Family Housing Management (also see AFI 32-9004, Disposal of real Property).
       1.3.8.2. Retain surplus adequate housing where the installation has maintained a 3-year average
       occupancy rate of 97 percent. Limit work on surplus adequate housing to health, safety and mini-
       mal cosmetic repairs, and dispose of at the end of the useful operating/economic life. In calculat-
       ing the occupancy rate for purposes of identifying surplus units to retain, remove units from the
       inventory that are undergoing M&R above that normally required for change of occupancy main-
       tenance.
       1.3.8.3. M&R funding for surplus housing M&R expenditures is limited to $3,800 per unit per
       FY. The Air Force Office of the Civil Engineer (AF/A7C) must approve expenditures in excess of
       this limitation.
       1.3.8.4. Surplus housing may be permanently converted to other uses. Diversion (temporary con-
       version) of surplus housing units is not permitted. Convert only units considered adequate based
       on the current HCP condition assessment matrix. However, units considered inadequate due only
       to functional suitability deficiencies, but otherwise in adequate condition, may be converted. Per-
       manent conversions change Air Force real property records and therefore determine the source of
       funds for the conversion, follow-on maintenance, repair and construction work. For permanent
       conversion requests the MAJCOM and installation must demonstrate a valid need for the pro-
       posed new use (Attachment 1, Terms).
    1.3.9. Inadequate Housing. Bases may improve or replace inadequate housing only if the housing
    requirement is validated by a current HRMA.
    1.3.10. Disposal/Divestiture. MAJCOMs must include in the FHMP their program for disposal/
    divestiture of surplus units (as defined in the HRMA), inadequate units that are replaced via Military
    Construction (MILCON) and units conveyed as part of a privatization initiative.
       1.3.10.1. MAJCOM/A7s request approval from AF/A7C for FH disposals/divestitures on a
       unit-by-unit basis. Requirements for approval of disposals/divestitures are provided in AFI
       32-6001.
       1.3.10.2. Bases must comply with:
           1.3.10.2.1. McKinney-Vento Act (Title 42 U.S.C. § 11411) before disposing of any govern-
           ment-owned units. McKinney-Vento Act requires the identification and publication of surplus
           housing to make the property available for application to assist the homeless. Surplus housing
           disposed of through a privatization initiative is exempt from the provisions of the McKin-
           ney-Vento Act.
           1.3.10.2.2. Prior consent and annual reporting requirements for disposing of Capehart and
           Wherry housing, IAW AFI 32-6001.
AFI32-6002 15 JANUARY 2008                                                                              9


1.4. Programming Policy:
   1.4.1. Bases are restricted from undertaking a replacement, improvement, minor improvement, major
   M&R or minor alteration project on a new or improved dwelling or non-dwelling unit within 3 years
   after initial occupancy.
      1.4.1.1. The 3-year limit does not apply when:
          1.4.1.1.1. A project addresses health, safety, or life-threatening situations,
          1.4.1.1.2. A project falls under the auspices of a larger program such as a general energy-effi-
          ciency upgrade program, or
          1.4.1.1.3. Work must be accomplished to prevent further damage to the dwelling following a
          natural disaster or other emergency.
      1.4.1.2. In other cases, including host nation funded new construction MAJCOMs must seek
      approval from AF/A7CAH by submitting Department of Defense (DD) Form 1391, FY__ Military
      Construction Project Data, with full justification for not meeting the 3-year limit.
   1.4.2. For self-help projects, AF/A7CAH waives the 3-year limit for projects less than $2,500. The
   waiver is for simple, minor projects such as installing ceiling fans, fences and flowerbeds. The waiver
   is not intended for large projects such as kitchen or bathroom renovations.
   1.4.3. Programming size standards for constructing, acquiring and improving FH units are in Attach-
   ment 2.
   1.4.4. The Air Force Family Housing Guide gives general guidance for calculating gross/net floor
   areas.
   1.4.5. Housing units may be increased above the programming benchmark for new construction up to
   ten percent for the following housing categories:
      1.4.5.1. GOQ occupied by an incumbent designated by OSD as a Special Command Position
      (SCP).
      1.4.5.2. Installation Commander.
      1.4.5.3. Command Chief (CCM) or Service equivalent residing on a military installation.
   1.4.6. Housing units may be increased up to 300 net square feet (28 net square meters) for indoor
   activity rooms in FH located in harsh climates. Bases in harsh climates are those with more than 7,500
   heating degree-days or 5,500 cooling degree-days annually. Eligible bases are listed in the Air Force
   Family Housing Guide.
   1.4.7. Outdoor living spaces include patios, enclosed patios, decks, lanais, balconies, back porches,
   and breezeways (converted to enclosed patios). Front entry porches, which are typically part of the
   main entry of the house and not enclosed, are not counted against the combined outdoor living spaces
   unless they are increased in size and function, or are connected to another interior or exterior living
   area. Size limits in Table 1.1. apply for combined outdoor living spaces:
10                                                                     AFI32-6002 15 JANUARY 2008

     1.4.8. FH with more than 12 units per building must comply with the antiterrorism requirements as
     defined in Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) 4-010-01, DoD Minimum Antiterrorism Standards for
     Buildings. FH with 12 or fewer units per building is exempt from the minimum antiterrorism require-
     ments in UFC 4-010-01. The DoD antiterrorism standards are minimum requirements. The MAJ-
     COMs may set more stringent antiterrorism building standards to meet specific threats identified and
     justified by integrated JSIVA, or MAJCOM, service, or installation vulnerability assessments.
     1.4.9. Follow the following environmental requirements:
        1.4.9.1. Comply with applicable federal, state, interstate and local environmental regulations, as
        well as DoD and Air Force environmental policies. Examples include: underground storage tanks,
        asbestos, radon, lead-based paint and any other requirements as defined by environmental regula-
        tions (AFI 32-7080, Pollution prevention Program).
        1.4.9.2. Identify requirements, and develop plans for environmental compliance, and address
        these requirements in projects to maintain, repair, improve, replace or construct FH, using applica-
        ble housing funds (AFPD 32-70, Environmental Planning).
        1.4.9.3. Ensure completion of an environmental impact analysis 2 years prior to the program year.
        1.4.9.4. Complete an environmental baseline survey no later than 6 months before start of con-
        struction, and complete an environmental assessment no later than 12 months before start of con-
        struction.
        1.4.9.5. Comply with environmental restoration requirements contained in AFI 32-7020, The
        Environmental Restoration Program.
     1.4.10. Follow the following requirements for historic housing facilities:
        1.4.10.1. Use Military Family Housing (MFH) funds to maintain historic housing units in livable
        condition.
AFI32-6002 15 JANUARY 2008                                                                               11


       1.4.10.2. When repairing or improving units, or when performing whole-house renovations, work
       with the State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) to make a reasonable effort to preserve historic
       significance (16 U.S.C. § 470; 36 CFR 800, Protection of Historic Properties).
       1.4.10.3. Consider major upgrading, alternative uses, or disposing of historic housing or support
       facilities if requirements for M&R funds become excessive.
   1.4.11. Requirements may not be split between an improvement project (P-713) and an M&R project
   (P-722), and apply both statutory improvements cost limits and M&R thresholds. For P-722 projects,
   do not split scope across multiple years, which is considered project splitting and is prohibited. Apply
   only one threshold at any time. The statutory improvements cost limit (paragraph 1.8.2.) applies dur-
   ing the construction period of an improvement project, and the M&R thresholds (paragraph 1.15.3.)
   resume after initial occupancy following project completion. In addition, incremental improvements
   that, combined together, significantly alter a housing unit are also prohibited (paragraph 1.4.1.).
   1.4.12. Lawn irrigation systems may be included for housing units where one of the following condi-
   tions exist: (1) Any yard size for personnel, regardless of rank, where the average annual rainfall is
   less than 20 inches (arid and semi-arid climates) (see approved listing of installations in the Air Force
   Family Housing Guide, approved by the Air Force Combat Climatology Center [AFCCC]), or (2) the
   yard is one-half an acre or greater (lot size, less footprint of housing unit), regardless of rank.
       1.4.12.1. Lawn irrigation systems for GOQs must be approved by the Deputy Assistant Secretary
       of the Air Force, Installations (SAF/IEI) prior to installation, regardless of criterion met or fund
       sources used.
   1.4.13. For GOQ improvement, minor improvement, new and replacement, and M&R exceed thresh-
   old projects, signatures of the MAJCOM/CE and General Officer in the resident’s chain of command
   are required on DD Form 1391c, MAJCOM/CE and GO Certificate for GOQ Projects, (Attachment
   14) to certify the project meets the GOQ Master Plan IFP. MAJCOMs and bases must use the IFP rec-
   ommendation, GOQ Master Plan, local GOQ standards and the projected FHMP investment schedule
   as guidelines for GOQ investment. If there are compelling or unforeseen reasons that cause deviation
   from the GOQ IFP, bases must document the circumstances with a life-cycle cost analysis, and pro-
   vide either photos or other justification supporting early replacement/repair decisions.
   1.4.14. The number of units proposed in acquisition, privatization and construction projects should
   target the projected housing requirement as determined through the HRMA process.
   1.4.15. The number of new units proposed in acquisition, privatization and construction projects may
   not exceed 90 percent of the projected housing deficit.

1.5. Approval Levels. Attachment 3 shows project approval levels and delegation authority.

1.6. Funding Policy (AFPD 65-5, Cost and Economics; AFPD 65-6, Budget; AFI 65-601, Volume 1,
Budget Guidance and Procedures; AFMAN 65-604, Appropriation Symbols and Budget Codes):
   1.6.1. Military Family Housing (MFH) Funds. MAJCOMs and bases use MFH funds to acquire,
   construct, replace, improve, operate, lease, maintain and repair housing and ancillary support facili-
   ties. Ancillary housing support facilities include:
       1.6.1.1. Asset management (housing flights), maintenance facilities and supply and storage facil-
       ities (self-help stores).
12                                                                        AFI32-6002 15 JANUARY 2008


        1.6.1.2. Recreational, athletic and other community support facilities and infrastructure located in
        FH areas for the exclusive use by housing area residents.
        1.6.1.3. Utility distribution systems and associated protective or control devices, including trans-
        formers, switch gears, manholes and hydrants located in FH areas for the exclusive support of the
        housing area.
     1.6.2. Fund Types:
        1.6.2.1. P-711. New construction funds used to acquire, construct and replace housing; funds also
        used to demolish FH units and ancillary support facilities, when they are associated with a replace-
        ment or construction project.
        1.6.2.2. P-713. Improvement funds used to improve housing. Funds also used to demolish FH
        units and ancillary support facilities, when associated with an improvement project.
        1.6.2.3. P-714. Planning and design funds used to design projects for new and replacement con-
        struction and improvement programs.
        1.6.2.4. P-721. Operations funds, used to operate housing.
        1.6.2.5. P-722. M&R funds used to maintain and repair government-owned FH; also used to
        demolish FH units and ancillary support facilities when not associated with a replacement or
        improvement project, and may also be design funds for M&R projects.
        1.6.2.6. P-723/724/725/726. Leasing funds used to lease, operate and maintain leased FH units
        and ancillary support facilities.
        1.6.2.7. P-727. Privatization funds used to cover costs associated with the identification, defini-
        tion, acquisition, oversight and execution of FH privatization projects (paragraph. 1.12.).
        1.6.2.8. P-728. Utilities funds used to cover the costs of utilities.
        1.6.2.9. DoD Family Housing Improvement Funds (FHIF) used to acquire, construct, replace and
        improve FH units and ancillary support facilities under the military housing privatization program.
        New construction funds (P-711) and improvement funds (P-713), are transferred to DoD FHIF by
        the OSD Comptroller for FH privatization projects.
     1.6.3. Funding FH Communications. MFH funds are used to fund permanently installed communica-
     tions requirements, such as fiber optic cables. Distribution branch lines, exclusively used by housing,
     are funded with MFH funds. Communications equipment that is readily removable and mis-
     sion-required is funded with non-MFH funds.
     1.6.4. Prohibition of Non-MFH M&R Funding for FH M&R. The annual DoD Appropriations Act
     prohibits the use of base O&M funds (Element of Expense/Investment Code [EEIC] 521, 522, 524) to
     maintain and repair FH units, including areas used to conduct official DoD business. The annual Mil-
     itary Construction Appropriations Act requires that FH O&M funds are the exclusive source of funds
     for M&R of all FH units.
     1.6.5. Diverted (temporarily converted) Units. Use M&R (P-722) funds to maintain FH units diverted
     for other uses.
     1.6.6. Funding Antiterrorism and Force Protection (AT/FP) Requirements. Use MFH funds for AT/FP
     measures required exclusively for FH (paragraph 1.4.8.).
AFI32-6002 15 JANUARY 2008                                                                                 13


1.7. New and Replacement Construction Program (P-711 Funds):
   1.7.1. Authority. The Air Force may acquire, construct or replace FH units and ancillary support
   facilities under the authority of 10 U.S.C. § 2821-2824.
   1.7.2. Congressional Authorization and Appropriation. Congress approves, by line item, new and
   replacement construction projects.
   1.7.3. Economic Analysis (EA). An EA is required to support new and replacement construction
   requirements (AFI 65-501).
   1.7.4. Compliance with the Family Housing Master Plan (FHMP). For nonhistoric units, when
   total improvement costs exceed 70 percent of the replacement cost, as identified in the FHMP, a hous-
   ing project is programmed as a replacement construction project. New construction must address def-
   icits identified in the FHMP. AF/A7CP will advocate funding according to the FHMP priorities.
   MAJCOMs and bases will develop projects for each location. The projects must follow the FHMP and
   GOQ Master Plans.
   1.7.5. Major Land Acquisition Moratorium. OSD established the major land acquisition morato-
   rium in fiscal year (FY) 90. An OSD waiver is required for any land purchase, lease, permit or other
   agreement exceeding 1,000 acres in size, or $1M in cost. MAJCOMs must obtain a waiver prior to
   submitting any project involving major land acquisition in the applicable Budget Estimate Submission
   (BES). The Air Force Real Property Agency (AFRPA) is responsible for processing the waiver
   request.
   1.7.6. Prohibition of Advance Land Acquisition and Site Preparation. Congress prohibits any
   funds to be used solely to (1) acquire land, (2) provide for site preparation, or (3) install utilities for
   any FH units, unless the housing units are authorized by law and funds for such units are appropriated.
   1.7.7. Project Documentation. For each project, submit the following forms to AF/A7CP for
   approval:
      1.7.7.1. DD Form 1391 and DOD Cost Model for new and replacement construction projects (see
      Attachment 4, Attachment 5, Attachment 7 and Attachment 8 for sample forms).
      1.7.7.2. DD Form 1523, Military Family Housing Justification, for acquisition projects (see
      Attachment 6 and Attachment 9 for sample forms).
      1.7.7.3. DD Form 1391, Sample Deficiency Detail Data (DDD) Sheets for Support Facilities
      Projects (see Attachment 10 and Attachment 11 for sample forms).

1.8. Improvement Program (P-713 Funds):
   1.8.1. Overview. This program improves the existing FH inventory to meet whole-house and
   whole-neighborhood standards and covers required M&R to extend the life of the house for 25 years.
   Improvement projects include:
      1.8.1.1. Altering, adding, expanding, or extending the life of an existing housing facility.
      1.8.1.2. Upgrading related housing support facilities such as asset management offices and hous-
      ing maintenance facilities.
      1.8.1.3. Upgrading or constructing other exclusive-use community support facilities such as park-
      ing areas, utilities, bus shelters and playgrounds.
14                                                                     AFI32-6002 15 JANUARY 2008


        1.8.1.4. Upgrading exclusive-use utility distribution systems such as electric, gas, water and sew-
        age disposal.
     1.8.2. Statutory Limit for Improvement Cost. Congress sets the statutory unit-cost limit for hous-
     ing improvements and concurrent M&R (10 U.S.C. § 2825).
        1.8.2.1. Congress set the current limit at:
            1.8.2.1.1. A cost of $50,000, multiplied by the area cost factor (ACF), per housing unit at the
            time of the contract award.
            1.8.2.1.2. A cost of $60,000, multiplied by the ACF, per housing unit at the time of the con-
            tract award for improvements necessary to make the unit suitable for handicapped family
            members.
        1.8.2.2. In foreign locations, bases may not apply the ACF to increase the cost limit. NOTE: Cost
        increases after contract award resulting solely from varying foreign currency exchange rates do
        not constitute a violation of this limit. EXCEPTION: This limit does not apply to projects autho-
        rized for restoring or replacing damaged or destroyed housing units.
        1.8.2.3. Exclusions for communications, security and AT/FP equipment. The costs associated
        with the installation, maintenance, or repair of communications, security and antiterrorism equip-
        ment required by the resident in the performance of assigned duties can be excluded from the
        application of the statutory improvement cost limit.
        1.8.2.4. Waivers to statutory improvement cost limit:
            1.8.2.4.1. AF/A7CP issues a call letter to MAJCOMs every year to prepare the BES. MAJ-
            COMs identify those improvement projects where the costs of the most expensive unit exceed
            the statutory improvement cost limit. Projects are included in the annual President’s Budget
            (PB) for approval by Congress. See the Air Force Family Housing Guide for a timeline.
            1.8.2.4.2. To request a waiver, bases must perform an EA IAW the latest Air Force Housing
            Economic Analysis Guidance Manual and show improving the facility is more cost effective
            than other alternatives.
            1.8.2.4.3. SAF/IEI is the approval authority to waive the cost limit after a 21-day congres-
            sional notification period. For out-of-cycle requests, the congressional notification package
            includes a “marked-up” DD Form 1391 showing the cost revisions to the original document
            and an EA. Following the 21-day notification period, if there are no congressional objections
            or concerns, the Air Force is authorized to proceed.
     1.8.3. Programming Improvement Projects:
        1.8.3.1. Program improvement projects to whole-house and whole-neighborhood criteria, even if
        the projected costs exceed the statutory improvement cost limit. If projected costs exceed the
        limit, bases must perform an EA to determine whether to program the project under the improve-
        ment program or the construction (replacement) program. Identify rank and bedroom mix on the
        DD Form 1391.
        1.8.3.2. Program improvements and necessary M&R work, as well as minor alterations that will
        bring units up to whole-house standards. Improvement projects must comply with the base HCP.
AFI32-6002 15 JANUARY 2008                                                                              15


   1.8.4. Programming Minor Improvement Projects (MIP):
      1.8.4.1. Plan minor improvement projects for low-cost, small-scale projects to improve existing
      housing facilities or housing community areas to include concurrent maintenance or repair work.
      1.8.4.2. A minor improvement project (P-713) is defined as an improvement project where the
      per-unit cost does not exceed the statutory improvement cost limit (Attachment 3). In calculating
      the statutory improvement cost limit, include the total cost of improvement, major M&R and
      minor alteration work planned or accomplished during the current FY.
   1.8.5. Out-of-Cycle Improvement Projects:
      1.8.5.1. MAJCOMs may apply to AF/A7CP for approval of urgent, out-of-cycle requirements
      that address safety, health or other life-threatening issues.
      1.8.5.2. SAF/IEI is the approval authority requests for out-of-cycle improvements, contingent on
      the availability of funds. Out-of-cycle improvement projects may not exceed the improvement
      cost limit.
   1.8.6. Conjunctive Funding for Host Nation Funded Projects. When a host nation government
   funds housing construction to meet Air Force housing requirements at less than Air Force standards,
   the installation will program an improvement project (P-713) to provide the conjunctive funding
   required for constructing housing to Air Force standards. The conjunctive funding requirement is pro-
   grammed to coincide with the host nation funded program year.
   1.8.7. Improvement Project Approval Levels. Improvement projects approval levels are listed in
   Attachment 3.
   1.8.8. Improvement Project Form. See Attachment 13 for a sample of DD Form 1391, Improve-
   ment Projects.

1.9. Maintenance and Repair (M&R) Program (P-722 Funds):
   1.9.1. Authority and Overview. The Air Force may maintain and repair FH units and ancillary sup-
   port facilities under the authority of 10 U.S.C. § 2833. This program covers minor alterations and
   major and minor M&R (Attachment 1, Terms) required to preserve FH units and support facilities,
   and also covers M&R thresholds (Attachment 3).
   1.9.2. Minor Alterations. Minor alteration is construction-type work normally performed in support
   of an M&R project.
      1.9.2.1. Minor alteration projects can improve housing units, support facilities and streets (includ-
      ing sidewalks), parking areas, utility systems and recreation facilities. Fund minor alteration
      projects with P-722 funds and use the approval limits listed in Attachment 3.
      1.9.2.2. Do not use minor alteration authority to increase the size of a unit or the number of rooms
      in a unit.
      1.9.2.3. MAJCOM Authority:
          1.9.2.3.1. Non-GOQs. MAJCOM/CEs are authorized to approve non-GOQ FH minor alter-
          ations costing less than $7,500 annually per unit and less than $750,000 per project using FH
          O&M (P-722) funds. Generally, this authority is used concurrently with the repair of FH units;
          however, some circumstances may warrant the use of the authority without repair. This author-
16                                                                      AFI32-6002 15 JANUARY 2008


            ity can be used for interior and exterior work consistent with the Air Force Family Housing
            Guide.
            1.9.2.3.2. GOQs. MAJCOM/CEs are authorized to approve GOQ minor alterations for inte-
            rior and exterior work consistent with Air Force GOQ standards and the Air Force GOQ Mas-
            ter Plan. Minor alteration work on GOQs can be accomplished up to $3,000 annually and the
            MAJCOM can delegate this authority to the installation Base Civil Engineer (BCE). Minor
            alteration work exceeding $3,000 and up to but not exceeding $7,500 annually must be
            approved by the MAJCOM Vice Commander (MAJCOM/CV). No general officer can
            approve work on his/her own unit. For single installation MAJCOMs and Direct Reporting
            Units (DRU), the approval authority is the Air Force Assistant Vice Commander (AF/CVA).
            For MAJCOM Commanders (MAJCOM/CC) or other O-10s, the approval authority is Air
            Force Vice Commander (AF/CV). Minor alterations to a GOQ must be properly documented
            in the annual GOQ cost report submitted to Congress, and must be accomplished within the
            GOQ OMR threshold.
        1.9.2.4. Non-Dwelling Units. Subject to the approval limits in Attachment 3, use the minor alter-
        ation authority on non-dwelling units to increase the size of the facility, extend streets, construct
        new parking areas, increase the capacity of utility systems and expand recreation areas.
        1.9.2.5. Antiterrorism/Force protection (AT/FP) FH Communications Exclusion. AT/FP and mis-
        sion-related, permanently installed communications requirements for FH dwelling units are not
        subject to the minor alteration limits, but do count against the annual O&M limit. AT/FP require-
        ments subject to this exclusion must be identified through JSIVA, or MAJCOM, Service, or instal-
        lation vulnerability assessments and be approved by the installation commander. Documentation
        of the assessment and approval for AT/FP requirements should be kept on file with project
        approval documentation. AT/FP and communications work is still subject to the GOQ and
        non-GOQ M&R thresholds.
        1.9.2.6. MAJCOMs and bases track the cost and scope of work for minor alterations to ensure the
        per-unit and per-project limits are not exceeded (Attachment 3) and that no restrictions are vio-
        lated.
     1.9.3. GOQ Maintenance and Repair (M&R), and Operations, Maintenance and Repair (OMR)
     Annual Thresholds. There are two statutory limitations (10 U.S.C. § 2831) and annually recurring
     provisions in the Military Construction Appropriation Acts that limit the annual expenditure of the
     following funds on any GOQ:
        1.9.3.1. M&R Threshold. Military Construction Appropriation Acts place an annual ceiling of
        $35,000 on M&R expenditures per GOQ, per FY. GOQ expenditures counted against the M&R
        annual limit include change of occupancy, minor/routine M&R, major M&R, grounds mainte-
        nance and minor alterations. FY05 MILCON Appropriation Act allows for after-the-fact notifica-
        tion based on unforeseen environmental remediation.
        1.9.3.2. OMR Threshold. 10 U.S.C. § 2831 placed a ceiling of $35,000 on OMR expenditures per
        GOQ, per FY. GOQ expenditures counted against the OMR annual limit include management
        (P-721.1), services (P-721.2), furnishings (P-721.4) and M&R (P-722). M&R expenditures
        include change of occupancy, minor/routine M&R, major M&R, grounds maintenance and minor
        alterations. 10 U.S.C. § 2831 allows for after-the-fact notification based on unforeseen environ-
        mental remediation or safety and security as defined below. 10 U.S.C. § 2831 also allows restora-
AFI32-6002 15 JANUARY 2008                                                                          17


     tion costs for GOQ historical features, which are exempted from the annual OMR limit. These
     costs must be counted against the annual M&R limit and may not be waived.
     1.9.3.3. The M&R or OMR thresholds may not be exceeded without prior notification to Con-
     gress or approval to notify Congress after-the fact. An after-the-fact notification may only be
     accomplished if the requirement arose after the PB was submitted. Approval to notify the Con-
     gress after-the-fact must be based on unforeseen environmental remediation (M&R or OMR
     threshold) or resident safety and security (OMR threshold only) as defined below.
        1.9.3.3.1. Exception for Environmental Remediation. The Military Construction Appropria-
        tion Acts and 10 U.S.C. § 2831 allow after-the-fact notification to Congress if the GOQ annual
        M&R or OMR threshold ($35,000 or as notified) is exceeded solely due to costs associated
        with unforeseen environmental remediation costs resulting from an on-going M&R action.
        Work executed under this exemption should be limited to that required to ensure resident
        safety and health from environmental conditions.
            1.9.3.3.1.1. The MAJCOM/A7 is the approval authority to exceed the annual M&R or
            OMR limit ($35,000 or as notified).
            1.9.3.3.1.2. MAJCOMs will notify the Air Force Civil Engineer, Asset Management Divi-
            sion (AF/A7CA) within 15 days of approval to exceed the annual M&R or OMR limit due
            to unforeseen environmental hazard remediation. The notification package will include a
            copy of the approval letter plus a DD Form 1391 (with backup detailed cost estimates)
            documenting revised project costs including the planned remediation plan, start date of the
            original M&R project (prior to discovery of the remediation work) and a summary of cur-
            rent and projected end-of-the-year OMR costs for the GOQ. If approved, MAJCOM/A7
            will provide a copy of the approval letter to the installation.
            1.9.3.3.1.3. File a copy of the after-the-fact notification approval memo in the GOQ
            project folder and the GOQ cost report files.
            1.9.3.3.1.4. Submit a copy of the after-the-fact notification approval memo to the AF/
            A7CAH with the annual cost report for the GOQ.
            1.9.3.3.1.5. SAF/IEI notifies Congress after the fact, as required.
        1.9.3.3.2. Exception for Safety and Security. Provided that the GOQ M&R threshold is not
        also exceeded, 10 U.S.C. § 2831 allows after-the-fact notification to Congress if the annual
        GOQ OMR limit ($35,000 or as notified) is exceeded to protect the safety and security of the
        residents or because of a combination of environmental remediation and safety and security
        costs. Since the FY05 MILCON Appropriation Act does not allow for this exception, this
        authority cannot be used to notify Congress after-the-fact of exceeding the M&R limit
        ($35,000 or as notified). This exception is provided to allow the Services to respond in a
        timely manner to correct imminent, documented threats to GOQ resident safety or security.
        Appropriate documentation of the requirement and its urgency should include AT/FP or threat
        assessments, JSIVA reports, and Risk Assessment Codes (RAC) and/or safety evaluation
        reports.
            1.9.3.3.2.1. The MAJCOM/A7 is the approval authority to exceed the $35,000 OMR limit
            due to resident safety and security issues. This authority may not be used to exceed the
            $35K M&R limit. Approval must be obtained prior to starting any work that will cause the
18                                                                     AFI32-6002 15 JANUARY 2008


               GOQ annual OMR costs to exceed the annual limit. MAJCOMs will provide a copy of the
               approval memo to the installation.
               1.9.3.3.2.2. MAJCOMs must notify AF/A7C within 15 days of MAJCOM/A7 approval to
               exceed the $35,000 OMR limit for resident safety or security. The notification package
               must include a copy of the exception approval memo, detailed documentation of the safety
               or security issue (e.g. safety reports, threat evaluations, JSIVA report), a DD Form 1391
               (with backup detailed cost estimates) and a summary of current and projected
               end-of-the-year OMR costs for the GOQ.
               1.9.3.3.2.3. File a copy of the after-the-fact notification approval memo in the GOQ
               project folder and the OMR cost files.
               1.9.3.3.2.4. Submit a copy of the after-the-fact notification approval memo with the
               annual cost report for the GOQ.
               1.9.3.3.2.5. SAF/IEI notifies Congress after the fact, as required.
           1.9.3.3.3. Historical Restoration Costs. Costs for restoration of GOQs historical features must
           be reported as part of the annual M&R costs but can be exempted from counting against the 10
           U.S.C. § 2831 OMR limit. Work on any other system or component not specifically identified
           as a historical feature is charged to the annual OMR limit. All M&R costs (for historical fea-
           tures or otherwise) count against the Military Construction Appropriation Acts M&R limit.
           SAF/IEI is the approval authority for historical restoration exemptions. Work to repair, main-
           tain or replace historical features on GOQs eligible for or currently on the historical register
           can qualify for this exclusion. Historical features qualifying for this exemption must be
           recorded in the SHPO description of the property.
               1.9.3.3.3.1. SAF/IEI is the approval authority to exempt work on historical features from
               the annual OMR limit. Approval to exempt work of this type must be obtained prior to
               starting any work that will cause the GOQ annual OMR costs to exceed the OMR limit.
               1.9.3.3.3.2. Forward requests for SAF/IEI approval to AF/A7C for processing. The
               request package must include a copy of the SHPO documents validating the items being
               worked on are historical features, a DD Form 1391 (with backup detailed cost estimates)
               and a summary of current and projected end-of-year OMR costs for the GOQ. If approved,
               AF/A7C provides a copy of the approval letter to the MAJCOM.
               1.9.3.3.3.3. File a copy of the exception approval memo in the GOQ project folder and the
               OMR cost files.
               1.9.3.3.3.4. Submit a copy of the exception approval memo with the annual cost report for
               the GOQ.
     1.9.4. Non-GOQ Major Maintenance and Repair (M&R) Threshold:
        1.9.4.1. This threshold is set at $20,000 per unit, and:
           1.9.4.1.1. Places an annual obligation limit on major M&R and alteration work, accomplished
           by job order, work order or contract, on non-GOQ units.
           1.9.4.1.2. Excludes costs for design and contract claims.
AFI32-6002 15 JANUARY 2008                                                                            19


        1.9.4.1.3. Applies to the cost of housing units and ancillary support facilities up to the 5-foot
        (1.5 meters) line outside of the housing unit and any support facility.
     1.9.4.2. Exception for Environmental Hazard Remediation for Non-GOQs:
        1.9.4.2.1. The cost to correct unforeseen environmental hazards, such as removing asbestos,
        mitigating radon, removing and abating lead-based paint and correcting other known legisla-
        tive environmental hazards in an on-going contract may exceed M&R thresholds. MAJCOMs
        must notify AF/A7CA at the end of March and September each year, listing each instance
        where M&R thresholds were exceeded because of unforeseen environmental hazard remedia-
        tion. A notification package will include a DD Form 1391 with backup detailed cost estimates
        documenting revised project costs including the planned remediation and a summary of cur-
        rent and projected end-of-year M&R costs for the non-GOQ.
        1.9.4.2.2. SAF/IEI notifies Congress after the fact, as required.
  1.9.5. Funding and Budget Constraints:
     1.9.5.1. Significant needs in all categories of FH, including GOQs, must be addressed with lim-
     ited housing O&M budgets. The Air Force does not budget for nor expect to spend the full amount
     of the GOQ or Non-GOQ annual thresholds annually on each unit.
     1.9.5.2. Under Military Construction Appropriation Committee report language, SAF/IEI must
     approve and notify Congress when an M&R project cost exceeds $7.5M.
     1.9.5.3. AF/A7CA issues a call letter to MAJCOMs each year to prepare the BES. MAJCOMs
     identify those M&R projects where GOQ and non-GOQ thresholds are to be exceeded. Projects
     are included in the annual PB for approval by Congress.
        1.9.5.3.1. Execute work approved over the GOQs and non-GOQs M&R thresholds no later
        than 1 year following the program year.
        1.9.5.3.2. Do not exceed the annual M&R and OMR thresholds for GOQs until Congress has
        approved. Once authorized to exceed GOQ M&R or OMR thresholds, MAJCOM/A7s must
        notify AF/A7C on 1 September of the budget year of any unawarded projects. The notification
        will include the reasons why each project has not yet been awarded in the budget year and a
        description of the plan to achieve award. A copy of this notification will be included in the
        base level project file.
        1.9.5.3.3. Do not increase the per-unit cost threshold for non-GOQs more than five percent
        without prior written approval by AF/A7C. AF/A7C may only approve an increase in project
        costs by up to 25 percent of the high unit cost (HUC) and the total project cost cannot exceed
        25 percent of the approved project threshold.
        1.9.5.3.4. The project scope may be reduced for non-GOQs by up to 25 percent of the project
        previously notified to Congress. However, the project scope may not be reduced when costs
        are increased above per-unit or project cost thresholds.
        1.9.5.3.5. Do not exceed the 25 percent flexibility for non-GOQs without prior congressional
        renotification.
20                                                                      AFI32-6002 15 JANUARY 2008


     1.9.6. Out-of-Cycle Notification to Exceed GOQ or Non-GOQ M&R Thresholds.
        1.9.6.1. In the year of execution, the BCE, with resident assistance, prioritizes requirements to
        stay within the monetary limit. If unforeseen urgent requirements arise, consider deferring other
        less critical work to stay within the GOQ and non-GOQ thresholds. Out-of-cycle requests to
        exceed the GOQ and non-GOQ thresholds are considered only in extraordinary circumstances.
           1.9.6.1.1. GOQ out-of-cycle budget submissions are allowed only when there is an extremely
           urgent situation, typically relating to risks to health, life or safety. Out-of-cycle requests must
           be for proposed work so urgent and compelling it cannot wait for the next annual budget sub-
           mission; it could not reasonably have been foreseen at the time of budget submission; cost of
           the work will cause the GOQ to exceed the $35,000 OMR limit and possibly the M&R limit;
           and work does not constitute an alteration, addition or improvement.
           1.9.6.1.2. Out-of-cycle requests to exceed the $35,000 limit are scrutinized by numerous Air
           Staff and Air Force Secretariat officials. After-the-fact notifications are not allowed except as
           described in paragraph 2.5.2. SAF/IE must review and approve out-of-cycle notifications.
           Approved requests are then submitted to Congress for notification. Congress has 30 days to act
           on the notification to exceed the M&R limit. Time periods for notification to exceed the OMR
           limit only, may be shorter. Submissions should include:
               1.9.6.1.2.1. Strong justification for why work must be done out-of-cycle, including rea-
               sons the requirement was not included in the budget submission, urgency and impact of the
               delay.
               1.9.6.1.2.2. Comprehensive narrative for each GOQ project, including validation the work
               is identified in the GOQ IFP. If the work is not included in the GOQ plan, provide a
               detailed explanation of the work.
               1.9.6.1.2.3. A completed DD Form 1391 to show specific project work to be accom-
               plished on the unit and to identify costs additional to the threshold.
               1.9.6.1.2.4. Detailed cost breakout (including line item details).
               1.9.6.1.2.5. Photographs depicting repair requirements.
               1.9.6.1.2.6. A statement signed by the GOQ resident acknowledging the work.
               1.9.6.1.2.7. A project certification statement signed by the MAJCOM/A7.
               1.9.6.1.2.8. Detailed breakout of other anticipated costs for the FY, including, but not lim-
               ited to, specific projects approved by SAF/IEI and all OMR costs.
        1.9.6.2. MAJCOMs may apply to AF/A7CAH for consideration of urgent M&R requirements.
        Include DD Form 1391 in supporting documentation, and explain why the MAJCOM did not
        identify the requirement for budget submission, the urgency of the requirement and the impact of
        the delay. SAF/IEI is the approval authority for out-of-cycle projects and notifies Congress.
        1.9.6.3. Congress limits submission of out-of-cycle M&R projects exceeding the GOQ M&R
        threshold to once per year. GOQ out-of-cycle notification may be submitted only for emergency
        requirements (health, safety, or life-threatening conditions). AF/A7CA will initiate a project call
        to MAJCOMs near the FY midpoint.
AFI32-6002 15 JANUARY 2008                                                                               21


   1.9.7. Self-Help Work. Self-help work is for simple, minor M&R projects (including minor alter-
   ation) on government-owned FH units, and is not intended for large or complicated improvement or
   replacement projects. Self-help projects are funded with MFH O&M funds and should not exceed
   $2,500. Self-help work must comply with Air Force housing standards and appropriate codes, safety
   and functionality. If the BCE approves self-help projects with the condition that the unit is returned to
   its original configuration, the resident is responsible for restoring the unit to its original condition
   before clearing the GOQ. The cost of self-help work combined with other minor alteration and M&R
   work performed by contracts or service orders may not exceed approval levels, Air Force size stan-
   dards, improvement cost limits, or annual GOQ or non-GOQ thresholds.
   1.9.8. Common Utility Infrastructure. For maintenance, repair and minor alteration, only the first 5
   feet of utility infrastructure, measured from the footprint of the unit, are considered dwelling costs.
   Utilities include water, electricity, gas, wastewater, stormwater, communications and alarm systems.
   This does not apply to the alarm system itself, but does apply to communications lines connecting the
   alarm to a central off-site system. For driveways and sidewalks exclusively serving a specific dwell-
   ing, all costs are considered a dwelling cost and subject to the appropriate limits. All dwelling costs
   must be counted towards the GOQ and non-GOQ M&R thresholds.
   1.9.9. Sample Forms. See Attachment 15 for sample DD Form 1391, M&R Project.

1.10. Foreign Lease Program (P-723/724 Funds). The Air Force may lease FH in a foreign country
under the authority of 10 U.S.C. § 2828(c) (10 U.S.C. § 2835; AFI 32-6001). Procedures are:
   1.10.1. Validate a housing shortage with a HRMA. For 25 units or more of new or renewal leases
   exceeding $30,000 per unit per year, perform an EA showing that leasing costs are less than alterna-
   tive housing options.
   1.10.2. A short-term foreign lease may be used as an interim solution to unforeseen housing require-
   ments. Short-term leases must be renewed annually and may not exceed 10 years, total.
   1.10.3. When a long-term housing requirement is identified, develop plans for acquiring facilities or
   constructing housing.
   1.10.4. Congress sets the foreign lease ceilings, annually. Lease ceilings include utility, maintenance
   and operational costs.
   1.10.5. The following guidelines must be followed:
       1.10.5.1. Publicly advertise and competitively bid or negotiate foreign build-to-lease contracts.
       1.10.5.2. Ensure that construction complies with local building codes and supplemented by DoD
       specifications.
       1.10.5.3. Limit foreign build-to-lease contracts to 10 years.
       1.10.5.4. Include a buy-out provision specifying the buy-out cost for each year of the lease period.
   1.10.6. Congress limits the total number of units leased under this program.

1.11. Domestic Lease Program (P-725/726 Funds). The Air Force may lease FH units constructed or
rehabilitated near a military installation within the United States under the authority of 10 U.S.C. §
2828(a) (AFI 32-6001). Procedures are:
22                                                                       AFI32-6002 15 JANUARY 2008


     1.11.1. Justify leases using an HRMA less than 3 years old.
     1.11.2. Use a short-term domestic lease as an interim solution to unforeseen housing requirements.
     Renew short-term leases annually and the lease may not exceed 5 years, total.
     1.11.3. For long-term lease requirements, develop a plan to alleviate the need for the lease by acquir-
     ing facilities, programming new construction projects, or incorporating the requirements into a FH
     privatization project.
     1.11.4. Congress sets the domestic lease ceilings, annually. Lease ceilings include utility, mainte-
     nance and operational costs.
     1.11.5. AF/A7CAH validates availability of leasing authority (points) and provides approval author-
     ity to the MAJCOM prior to execution of the lease. SAF/IEI provides a quarterly notification to Con-
     gress of new and renewal leases exceeding $20,000 per unit per year.

1.12. Military Housing Privatization Initiative (MHPI):
     1.12.1. Authority. The Air Force may use a wide variety of guarantees, leases, investments and loans
     to provide for the acquisition or construction of FH and ancillary support facilities by private develop-
     ers, using the authority of 10 U.S.C. Chapter 169, Subchapter IV, § 2871 through § 2885. The author-
     ity is limited to the United States and its territories (foreign locations excluded). See AFI 32-6007,
     Privatized Family Housing, for authorities, scoring requirements and execution. Authority includes
     the following
        1.12.1.1. Utilities and Services.
        1.12.1.2. Direct loans and loan guarantees.
        1.12.1.3. Leasing of housing.
        1.12.1.4. Investments.
        1.12.1.5. Rental guarantees.
        1.12.1.6. Differential lease payments.
        1.12.1.7. Conveyance or lease of existing properties and facilities.
     1.12.2. Housing Privatization Responsibilities:
        1.12.2.1. AF/A7CAH provides program management and oversight, and is the liaison between
        the Air Force and the OSD Housing & Competitive Sourcing (H&CS) office, the advocate for Air
        Force projects.
        1.12.2.2. AF/A7CAH validates housing requirements and developing housing programs, includ-
        ing privatization projects, consistent with the Air Force FHMP. AF/A7CAH also works jointly
        with MAJCOMs to determine whether to execute housing requirements as a privatization initia-
        tive or as a traditional military construction project.
        1.12.2.3. MAJCOMs and installations develop housing requirements and identify potential priva-
        tization projects, and may play an extensive or limited role in executing privatization projects,
        depending on the authority or combination of authorities used.
     1.12.3. Five-Phase Process. See AFI 32-6007, for details of the five-phases of developing and man-
     aging a housing privatization project, from initial concept through project closeout. The five phases
AFI32-6002 15 JANUARY 2008                                                                            23


  are project identification, project definition, project acquisition, portfolio and project management,
  and project closeout.
  1.12.4. Congressional Notification:
     1.12.4.1. Proposal Solicitation. SAF/IEI and the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Air Force,
     Budget (SAF/FMB) provide congressional notification 30 days prior to soliciting privatization
     request for proposals. AF/A7CAH will coordinate notification packages with the Air Force Center
     for Engineering and the Environment, Housing Privatization Division (AFCEE/HDP) prior to
     staffing for SAF/IEI and SAF/FMB signature and notification to Congress of Air Force intent to
     solicit a project.
     1.12.4.2. Contract Award and Transfer of Funds. Contract award and transfer of funds notifica-
     tions are two separate and distinct congressional notifications. Per 10 U.S.C. § 2871, the term
     “contract” includes any contract, lease or other agreement entered into under the privatization
     authorities. The Air Force closes a real estate transaction or deal, with a private sector developer
     as opposed to awarding a contract. Prior to closing a privatization deal the legislation requires a
     congressional notification with a 30-day waiting period. AF/A7CAH will coordinate notification
     packages with AFCEE/HDP prior to staffing for SAF/IEI and SAF/FMB signature and notifica-
     tion to Congress of the Air Force intent to close a deal. If required to support the privatization
     project, appropriated funds (P-711 and/or P-713) are transferred to the DoD Family Housing
     Improvement Fund (FHIF) prior to project closing. A congressional notification and a 30-day
     waiting period is required before P-711 and /or P-713 funds can be transferred to the DoD FHIF.
     AF/A7CAH will identify the funding transfer requirements and coordinate with SAF/FMB prior
     to submission to OSD Housing & Competitive Sourcing [OSD (H&CS)]. Following coordination
     with OMB, OSD (H&CS) will forward the transfer of funds request to the OSD Comptroller (C).
     OSD (C) will notify Congress of Air Force intent to transfer P-711 and /or P-713 funds to the DoD
     FHIF.
  1.12.5. Funding Privatization Projects:
     1.12.5.1. Housing Privatization Program funds (P-727) include all costs associated with planning,
     development, solicitation, selection and closing MHPIs, and specifically for:
         1.12.5.1.1. Environmental assessments, baseline surveys, or supplemental studies, initial pro
         forma and EA development and required property surveys.
         1.12.5.1.2. Industry forums and requests for proposal development.
         1.12.5.1.3. Project management office expenses, including contract costs, temporary duty
         (TDY), training and non-material support costs, until initial construction.
         1.12.5.1.4. The cost of construction surveillance during the initial development period and
         portfolio management costs for closed privatization projects.
         1.12.5.1.5. Support consultants and higher headquarters oversight and supervision.
     1.12.5.2. P-727 funds should not be used for any construction, demolition, supplies, or service
     contract requirements to support the execution of an MHPI.
     1.12.5.3. Privatization project scored costs are funded through the DoD FHIF. Funds are trans-
     ferred into the FHIF from P-711/P-713 appropriations. Approval from Congress is required to
     transfer funds into the FHIF. The DoD FHIF is centrally managed by OSD.

     1.12.6. Project Documentation. For each project, submit a DD Form 1391, Privatization Project,
     (see Attachment 12 for sample form). Any land acquisition requirement must be identified on the DD
     Form 1391.

1.13. No-Cost Acquisition Program:
     1.13.1. The Air Force may acquire FH units at no cost to the government under authority of 10 U.S.C.
     § 2822. This program does not require line-item authorization.
     1.13.2. SAF/IEI is the approval authority for no-cost acquisition projects before the installation
     acquires FH units.

1.14. Interservice Transfer Program. DoD permits the transfer of FH among the services without com-
pensation under authority of 10 U.S.C. § 2571. The Secretaries of the respective services and OSD are the
approval authorities for transfers.

1.15. Restoration/Replacement for Damaged or Destroyed Housing Program (P-711/713/722
Funds).
     1.15.1. This program provides funds for restoring or replacing FH units damaged by fire, hurricanes,
     earthquakes, storms or other disasters.
     1.15.2. After-the-fact notification for restoration of damaged or destroyed housing is limited to
     projects exceeding non-GOQ M&R threshold. It does not apply to projects exceeding GOQ OMR
     threshold.
     1.15.3. Procedures are as follows:
        1.15.3.1. Use P-722 funds for immediate temporary repair to make units livable.
        1.15.3.2. Program permanent repairs as soon as possible, using P-722 funds.
        1.15.3.3. Program replacement facility projects, using P-711 funds.
        1.15.3.4. Include known maintenance, repair and improvement requirements resulting from
        unforeseen events.
        1.15.3.5. Notify SAF/IEI through MAJCOMs and AF/A7CAH when restoring damaged or
        destroyed housing units due to unforeseen events, not from long-term deterioration, and when per-
        forming emergency work exceeding the M&R thresholds.
        1.15.3.6. Include in the cost estimate, a per-unit cost to restore each unit in multifamily structures.
        1.15.3.7. SAF/IEI approves the after-the-fact notification memos to Congress, and SAF/FMB
        signs the notification memos to the Appropriations Committees.
     1.15.4. MAJCOMs submit to AF/A7CAH any per-unit restoration cost that exceeds 70 percent of
     replacement costs or $100,000, whichever is less; or any changes to the programmed amount (PA) for
     a previously approved project that exceeds the 70 percent or $100,000 threshold. Identify the total
     extent of damage and other projects programmed to restore damaged or destroyed units.
        1.15.4.1. AF/A7CAH processes after-the-fact notification, semiannually. MAJCOM submissions
        for the after-the-fact congressional notification should arrive in AF/A7CAH no later than the first
        day of the first and third quarters of each FY. Only projects with low bids will be processed.
AFI32-6002 15 JANUARY 2008                                                                         25


     1.15.4.2. SAF/IEI approves and provides after-the-fact notification to Congress for projects that
     exceed either 70 percent of the replacement costs, or $100,000 per unit.
  1.15.5. The statutory improvement cost limit (paragraph 1.8.2.) does not apply to damaged or
  destroyed facilities.

     2.2.3. Ensuring that the housing area meets the needs of its residents.
     2.2.4. Making the housing area attractive and a source of pride.

2.3. Whole-House Design Criteria. Develop whole-house designs to enhance functional layout, sys-
tems and equipment in housing units and support facilities. The design work updates an existing house to
current construction codes and contemporary quality living standards and extends the useful life of the
housing unit 25 years.
     2.3.1. Whole-house designs typically include:
        2.3.1.1. Adding and altering space.
        2.3.1.2. Upgrading mechanical, electrical and utilities systems.
        2.3.1.3. Adding energy conservation features.
        2.3.1.4. Repairing building structure, components and equipment.
        2.3.1.5. Improving yards, walks and driveways.
     2.3.2. The Air Force Family Housing Guide provides the following:
        2.3.2.1. Details requirements for whole-house design. It addresses functional layout and basic
        amenities, minimal floor areas, room dimensions, energy criteria and environmental issues.
        2.3.2.2. Handicapped design criteria for FH IAW the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).
        Each base must ensure five percent of its FH inventory is handicap adaptable.
        2.3.2.3. Fire safety criteria, including requirements for fire sprinkler systems, smoke detectors
        and carbon monoxide detectors.
        2.3.2.4. Environmental remediation criteria, including handling and removing asbestos-contain-
        ing materials, preventing the entry of radon gas and assessing, managing and abating lead-based
        paint in housing.
        2.3.2.5. Additional detailed GOQ design guidance is provided in the GOQ Master Plan, GOQ
        Standards for Programming, Design and Construction.
AFI32-6002 15 JANUARY 2008                                                                           27


     2.3.2.6. Consider using renewable forms of energy in FH projects. For energy conservation meth-
     ods and cost effective techniques to design new and replacement construction and improvement
     projects, also consider the following:
         2.3.2.6.1. Renewable energy sources (particularly passive or active solar energy systems.
         2.3.2.6.2. High efficiency equipment, lighting and appliances with appropriate controls.
         2.3.2.6.3. Increased insulation in floors, walls, ceilings and roofs.
         2.3.2.6.4. Radiant barriers.
         2.3.2.6.5. Energy efficient windows and doors with insulated or low-emissivity (Low-E) glass
         and panels, double or triple glazing, thermal breaks and weather-stripping.
         2.3.2.6.6. Air lock entries on exterior doors where winter temperatures drop to -10 degrees
         Fahrenheit (-23 degrees Celsius) or lower.
         2.3.2.6.7. Window shading to reduce interior overheating caused by solar gain.
     2.3.2.7. Prohibited materials, finishes and equipment based on considerations such as mainte-
     nance, fire safety, environmental restrictions and energy efficiency.
     2.3.2.8. Electrical and mechanical design criteria that agents must follow as well as applicable
     codes to determine the electrical and mechanical design requirements.
     2.3.2.9. Minimum noise level reductions for FH improvement and construction. Also, review the
     Air Installation Compatible Use Zone Report for each project to ensure that adequate sound atten-
     uation is incorporated into the design of FH units.
     2.3.2.10. Guidance for installing irrigation systems, as well as a list of approved installations
     meeting rainfall conditions (paragraph 1.4.12.).
     2.3.2.11. AT/FP requirements (paragraph 1.4.8.).
     2.3.2.12. Sustainable development concepts, to be incorporated into the planning, design, con-
     struction, environmental management operation, maintenance and disposal of facilities and infra-
     structure projects, consistent with budget and mission requirements. A sustainable facility
     achieves optimum resource efficiency and constructability while minimizing adverse impacts to
     built and natural environments through all phases of its life cycle.
     2.3.2.13. Design and construction criteria for prestige housing. The Air Force authorizes prestige
     housing for CCMs at Air Force installations. Air Force minimum standards for prestige housing
     allow commanders and CCMs to designate prestige housing above other senior enlisted quarters.
     Commanders must carefully assess the number of prestige FH units needed at each installation.
  2.3.3. Follow the guidelines in the Air Force Housing Support Facilities Guide to plan and design
  Asset Management Offices, housing maintenance facilities and storage warehouses.

   and specifications for a FH project, to six percent of the PA.

3.4. Programming, Design and Construction Execution Reporting:
   3.4.1. MAJCOMs report to AF/A7CPA the design and construction status of FH projects. Status of
   programming, design and construction must be reported timely, using Automated Civil Engineer Sys-
   tem-Project Management (ACES-PM).
   3.4.2. MAJCOMs review, validate and update programming, design and construction information.
   Projects under design, which exceed PA and/or increase or decrease scope within PA, or revise rank
   and bedroom mix, must be identified to AF/A7CPA for a review of programming options.
   3.4.3. AF/A7CPA:
       3.4.3.1. Issues design instruction (DI) based on approved DD Form 1391 (PA/scope and rank and
       bedroom mix) and MAJCOM request.
       3.4.3.2. Uses ACES-PM data to oversee the Air Force FH program.
       3.4.3.3. At the MAJCOM request, issues authority to advertise (ATA) when project design is
       reported 100 percent in ACES-PM.
       3.4.3.4. Issues construction funds based on a validated bid report entered into ACES-PM by the
       MAJCOMs.

3.5. MILCON Design Authority:
   3.5.1. AF/A7CPA:
       3.5.1.1. Delegates three percent design authority to MAJCOMs for A-E selection, predefinition
       conference and preliminary A-E negotiations.
       3.5.1.2. Issues 35 percent design instructions on FH projects on delivery of the BES to OSD.
       3.5.1.3. Issues 100 percent design instructions on FH projects on 35 percent design completion as
       validated by ACES-PM.

3.6. Advanced Authority to Advertise (ATA) FY-Plus-1-Year Family Housing (FH) Projects. A F /
A7CPA generally issues ATA FY projects after MAJCOMs confirm projects are 100 percent designed and
30                                                                       AFI32-6002 15 JANUARY 2008


ready to advertise and after passage of the FY DoD funding bills. However, MAJCOMs may realize cer-
tain benefits from advertising projects early. AF/A7CPA will issue advance ATA for FY, plus 1 year for
FH projects before all congressional committees have marked the MILCON bill on the following condi-
tions:
     3.6.1. The project must be 100 percent designed (as shown in ACES-PM) by 15 July of the year prior
     to appropriation.
     3.6.2. The project has a current working estimate less than or equal to the PA, given that the PA is sub-
     ject to change with congressional reduction and foreign currency withholds.
     3.6.3. The project must successfully pass three congressional committee marks.
     3.6.4. The bid acceptance period must be flexible for extensions until the MILCON bill is passed and
     funds are available for issuance.

3.7. Design/Construction Agent. Under U.S.C. § 2851 and DoDD 4270.5, Military Construction, spe-
cific design/construction agents are designated based on geographical areas.
     3.7.1. For CONUS locations (including Alaska, Hawaii and Guam), the Air Force may act as its own
     design/construction agent.
     3.7.2. For overseas (foreign) locations, Air Force must use either Army Corps of Engineers or Naval
     Facilities Engineering Commands as its design/construction agent for new and replacement construc-
     tion projects. These agencies are responsible for the following geographical regions:
        3.7.2.1. Army Corps of Engineers: Europe, excluding Spain, Portugal, Italy, Greece, United King-
        dom, Japan, Korea and Turkey.
        3.7.2.2. Naval Facilities Engineering Commands: Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal, including the
        Azores.

      CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND PROJECT OVERSIGHT OF NEW AND
               REPLACEMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS

4.1. Construction Management. Construction agents must prepare a comprehensive management plan
to define roles and responsibilities for participants in the construction management process. The plan
must provide a mechanism for resolving conflicts and serves as a tool for managing and controlling
schedules.

4.2. Cost Control. MAJCOMs must:
   4.2.1. Avoid reprogramming projects, if at all possible.
   4.2.2. Submit a cost control management plan to AF/A7CPA when a project exceeds 120 percent of
   the PA.

4.3. Cost/Scope Variation and Reprogramming:
   4.3.1. AF/A7CPA reprograms FH projects IAW 10 U.S.C. § 2853 when unforeseen conditions arise
   during construction causing cost increases or scope variations.
   4.3.2. MAJCOM/A7s submit a written justification for reprogramming that includes:
       4.3.2.1. Current working estimates based on valid bids or proposals, including bid extensions.
       4.3.2.2. EA, if required, justifying an upward adjustment of High Unit Cost (HUC).
       4.3.2.3. Impact of terminating the contract.
       4.3.2.4. DD Form 1391, marked with changes.
       4.3.2.5. Justification for reprogramming.
   4.3.3. Use the following procedures for approving FH project costs exceeding PA, scope reductions
   and scope increases:
       4.3.3.1. AF/A7CPA approves cost increases less than 20 percent over the PA or $2M, whichever
       is less, and scope reductions of less than 20 percent. Requests for AF/A7CPA approval may come
       from MAJCOM division chiefs or higher.
       4.3.3.2. AF/A7C approves cost increases over the PA between 20 and 25 percent or $2M, which-
       ever is less and scope reductions from 20 to 25 percent. Requests for AF/A7C approval must come
       from MAJCOM/CEs.
       4.3.3.3. Congress approves new and improvement construction projects with cost variations
       (increase/decrease) or scope reductions (including funds) greater than 25 percent of the PA, or
       greater than $2M, whichever is less.
          4.3.3.3.1. SAF/IEI must approve cost variations or scope reductions greater than 25 percent of
          the PA, or greater than $2M, whichever is less.
          4.3.3.3.2. Requests for SAF/IEI approval and congressional notification are submitted by
          MAJCOM/A7s and sent to AF/A7C. AF/A7C processes the request and forwards the request
          to SAF/IEI.
32                                                                       AFI32-6002 15 JANUARY 2008


            4.3.3.3.3. A reduction of 25 percent or more from the PA while maintaining the scope of a
            project is considered scope reduction and a prior congressional notification is required. The
            prior congressional notification is independent of any request to reprogram funds that are
            excess to a project due to a scope reduction.
        4.3.3.4. Requests for congressional approval must come from MAJCOM/CEs.
        4.3.3.5. A reduction of 25 percent or more taken from the PA while maintaining the scope of a
        project is considered scope reduction and congressional notification is required. The 21-day prior
        notification is independent of any request to reprogram funds that are excess to a project due to a
        scope reduction.
     4.3.4. Requests for approval of project costs exceeding the PA or scope reductions/increases must
     include:
        4.3.4.1. Current working estimates based on valid bid proposals.
        4.3.4.2. Thorough justification for the request, including an analysis of the cause for the change.
        4.3.4.3. Impact if not approved.
        4.3.4.4. Plan to prevent future occurrences (except scope increases).
     4.3.5. Use the following procedures for HUC approval:
        4.3.5.1. Improvement Projects Exceeding Statutory Improvement Cost Limit. In compliance with
        10 U.S.C. § 2825, congressional notification is made by the budget submission for improvement
        projects wherein the HUC exceeds the statutory improvement cost limit. The statute does not
        require congressional notification when, during project execution, the unit costs are expected to
        exceed the HUC identified on the DD Form 1391 contained in the approved budget submission.
        However, AF/A7C approval is required to exceed the approved HUC and SAF/IEI approval is
        required to exceed the HUC by more than 25 percent.
        4.3.5.2. Improvement Projects Less than the Statutory Improvement Cost Limit. The congres-
        sional budget submittal only includes DD Form 1391 for projects estimated to exceed the statutory
        improvement cost limit. Therefore, if a DD Form 1391 with an HUC is not included, by default,
        the approved unit cost is less than the statutory improvement cost limit. If, during project execu-
        tion, costs are projected to exceed the statutory improvement cost limit, the base must accomplish
        the statutory requirement to notify Congress. A 21-day notice-and-wait to Congress is required
        prior to executing the improvements. Once congressional notification is complete, paragraph
        4.3.5.1. applies.
        4.3.5.3. MAJCOM/A7 Request. Requests for AF/A7C or SAF/IEI approval to exceed HUC and
        requests for congressional notification, as outlined in paragraph 4.3.5.1. and 4.3.5.2., respectively,
        must be signed by MAJCOM/CE and submitted to AF/A7CPA.
        4.3.5.4. Utilities and Infrastructure Inclusion. The high unit (most expensive unit) cost should be
        calculated to include utilities and infrastructure that are the exclusive use of the unit. For example,
        include sewer lateral for sewer line, water branch for water line, patio, porch, walkways, privacy
        fencing and driveway in the cost calculation since it exclusively services the housing unit.
AFI32-6002 15 JANUARY 2008                                                                                33


   4.3.6. Costs associated with legally required environmental hazard remediation is excluded from the
   application of cost variations/reprogramming thresholds, if the remediation could not have been rea-
   sonably anticipated at the time the project was approved originally by Congress.

4.4. Substituting Improvement Projects with Replacement Projects. If an authorized improvement
project cost exceeds 70 percent of the cost to replace the housing and an EA further shows the improve-
ment project is no longer the most cost effective alternative after a review of post-design or bid cost esti-
mate, request to substitute a replacement project at the improvement project programmed amount.
   4.4.1. SAF/IEI is the approval authority for project substitutions and notifies Congress. After con-
   gressional notification, a waiting period of 21 days must elapse before the contract may be awarded.
   The notification includes the EA and marked DD Form 1391.

4.5. Inspection Policy. Each FH construction project delivery team:
   4.5.1. Ensures a quality project is delivered on time and IAW the terms of the contract.
   4.5.2. May not accept any FH units without a prefinal and final inspection.
   4.5.3. Must ensure the contractor completes prefinal punch list items before final inspection.

4.6. Financial Closeout:
   4.6.1. MAJCOMs financially close out a project within 4 months after physical completion.
   4.6.2. SAF/FMBI and AF/A7CR withdraws surplus funds identified by the MAJCOMs.
   4.6.3. MAJCOMs reopen a project account in ACES-PM for a claim that warrants funding to be pro-
   cessed by AF/A7CR.

4.7. Architectural-Engineering (A-E) Liability. MAJCOMs pursue A-E liability for design deficien-
cies when the liability results from:
   4.7.1. Errors or omissions in design or construction.
   4.7.2. Failure to meet standards.
   4.7.3. Breach in contracts that damages the government.
   4.7.4. Additional construction contract cost.

4.8. Adopted Forms:
   4.8.1. DD Form 1523, Military Family Housing Justification
   4.8.2. DD Form 1391, FY__ Military Construction Project Data

Terms
Change of Occupancy Maintenance (COM)—Minor M&R work done on housing units when
occupancy changes. Includes interior painting; repairing floors, walls and ceiling finishes; and repairing
electrical and plumbing fixtures. Does not include other maintenance or repair work, which may have
been deferred until change of occupancy to avoid inconveniencing the residents.
Conversion—A permanent change in use of a FH facility requiring a permanent change of category code
on real property inventory records from a FH unit to a non-FH facility category code.
Diversion (previously known as temporary conversion)—Temporary change in the designated use of a
facility, normally not to exceed 3 years. Diversion requires a real property inventory record annotation of
the applicable temporary facilities construction category code, but does not change category code on real
property inventory records.
Dwelling Units—A single structure or part of a multi-family building, with other facilities directly
associated with the unit. Examples include carports, garages, driveways, patios, walks, privacy fences, or
other attached facilities and utility service lines (from the dwelling unit to the main utility line).
General Officer Quarters (GOQ)—A housing unit, including grounds, walks, driveways and other
paved areas and structures designated for the exclusive use of general officers, their families or guests.
Historic Housing Facilities—Facilities currently on or eligible for nomination to the National Register
of Historic Places; or facilities that figure significantly in state or local history. Consult the State Historic
Preservation Office (SHPO) and other interested parties on undertakings involving historic housing as per
the National Historic Preservation Act.
Housing Area—An identifiable grouping of FH facilities planned, developed and maintained in a
residential character.
Housing Community Profile (HCP)—A long range planning and programming document, consistent
with land use as defined in the base comprehensive plan, which maps out development of the entire
housing area to incorporate whole-house and whole-neighborhood concepts, including:
• Developing elements of neighborhood vehicular and pedestrian circulation based on sitting, density,
landscaping, parking, playgrounds, recreation areas and utilities.
• Reconfiguring floor layouts, if necessary, to make housing more functional, livable and accessible.
• Extending the life of a unit for another 25 years by adding, expanding, or converting space.
• Housing unit as defined as a single structure or part of a multifamily buildings that include a carport,
garage, driveway, or other associated parking, patio, privacy fence, utility service lines and other attached
facilities.
Housing Requirements and Market Analysis (HRMA)—A formalized method used to estimate
current and projected housing deficits or surpluses at any given installation. Professional economists
trained in social sciences and familiar with principal data sources and analysis techniques conduct these
analyses working as independent consultants. They justify the need for the Air Force to acquire or
construct new FH units, replace existing FH units, or undertake whole-house or whole-neighborhood
improvement projects.
AFI32-6002 15 JANUARY 2008                                                                                 39


Major Maintenance and Repair (M&R)—Work necessary to fix or replace systems and their
components nearing the end of their useful lives. Bases generally contract out for this work. The work
includes:
• Restoring or replacing components of facilities damaged by fire, storm, or other disaster.
• Restoring or replacing equipment (over 1 HP), utility systems, or plants.
• Restoring or replacing structural members in their original locations, foundations, roofs, exterior struc-
tures or walls, interior partitions, electrical, plumbing, heating, ventilation and air conditioning and real
property installed equipment.
• Any project where the cost of materials and labor exceed $2,500.
• Addition of insulation where either no insulation or inadequate insulation exists.
• Installation of carpet, vinyl wall coverings and wall paneling in existing facilities (when the flooring or
walls require repair).
• Complete exterior painting, landscaping and planting of trees or shrubs.
• An upgrade to contemporary standards may be considered major M&R if (1) the work is consistent with
projected facility life, utilization and sound engineering practices and (2) the upgrade would provide a
better product and/or be more economical than the existing product. An engineering analysis will be per-
formed.
Minor Alterations—Construction/Improvement work accomplished with P-722 funds. Minor alterations
work installs or constructs systems, features, or functional spaces that do not currently exist, replaces
items still within their services life, or changes spaces that already exist (relocates walls, adds or removes
openings, or otherwise reconfigures existing spaces). Projects can be interior or exterior work but may not
add, expand, or extend the physical dimensions of the house or increase net floor area. Replacement of
failed or unserviceable components with contemporary standard components or materials, consistent with
local GOQ standards, is not minor alteration if justified by a life-cycle analysis considering planned and
programmed work. Anti-Terrorism/Force Protection (AT/FP) requirements supported by documented
vulnerability assessments are excluded from minor alteration cost limits.
Minor Improvement—Improvement project (P-713) where the per-unit cost does not exceed the
statutory improvement cost limit (see Attachment 3). In calculating the statutory improvement cost limit,
include the total cost of all improvement, major M&R and minor alteration work planned or accomplished
during the current FY.
Minor Maintenance and Repair (M&R)—Day-to-day M&R work performed in response to service
calls or urgent job orders accomplished by contract or in-house forces.
Net Floor Area—Space within the interior faces of exterior walls and party walls of living units, with the
exclusions as stated in Attachment 2.
Non-Dwelling Units (Ancillary Support Facilities)—Communal facilities directly associated with a
housing area or facilities outside the housing area that solely support FH. Examples include roads,
common-use parking areas, bus shelters, playgrounds, common-use walks, utility mains and FH
management offices and shops.
Programmed Amount (PA)—Total project cost, including construction, contingencies, supervision,
inspection and overhead.
40                                                                       AFI32-6002 15 JANUARY 2008


Project—All work necessary to produce a complete and usable facility, or a complete and usable
improvement and M&R to an existing facility. Do not split the work to avoid limits, restrictions and
thresholds.
Replacement Cost—Cost of replacing an existing FH unit built to its authorized size and whole-house
standards. MAJCOMs and bases estimate the unit cost together with the cost to replace supporting
facilities using the DoD Family Housing Cost Model. Calculate unit cost per net floor area according to

(1) Operation, M&R thresholds of $35,000 and M&R threshold of $20,000 include the minor alteration threshold ($7,500) except as noted
in (2).
(2) Anti-terrorism/Force Protection (AT/FP) and mission-related permanently installed communication requirements for FH dwelling units
are not subject to minor alteration limits. AT/FP requirements subject to this execution must be identified through Joint Service Integrated
Vulnerability Assessments (JSIVA), or MAJCOM, Service or installation vulnerability assessments, and approved by the installation
commander. AT/FP and communications work are still subject to the statutory M&R limits for $35,000 per unit for GOQs and $20,000 per
unit for non-GOQs.
(3) No general officer can approve work on his/her unit; for single installation MAJCOMs and Direct Reporting Units (DRU), the approval
authority is the AF/CVA. For all other MAJCOMs, approval authority is the AF/CV.
(4) All minor alteration costs including those for FP and mission-related permanently installed communications requirements cost against
the $30,000 limit for non-dwelling units.
(5) No authority.
(6) AF/A7C approves non-dwelling unit MIPs exceeding the $30,000 limit and non-GOQ dwelling unit MIPs exceeding the $200,000 limit.
(7) Applies only to Non-GOQs

PROJECT: Military Family Housing (Current Mission)

REQUIREMENT: Project is required to provide modern and efficient housing for military members and their dependents, at Blue AFB. Units
will meet modern housing standards and are programmed IAW the HCP, Phase xx. Housing will provide a safe, comfortable and appealing
living environment comparable to the off-base civilian community. Design will provide a modern kitchen, living room, family room, bedroom
and bath configuration, with ample interior and exterior storage. Number of bedrooms will range from two to four, as identified in the most
recent HRMA. Units will have a one or two car garage and exterior parking for a single vehicle. Space will also be provided with an adequate
support infrastructure of roads and utilities. The base currently has 800 housing units versus a validated requirement of 1,000.

This is the first phase of a multi-phase initiative to construct an additional 180 housing units for the base.

CURRENT SITUATION: The most recent HRMA for the base shows a deficit of 200 housing units over and above adequate and affordable
housing available in the local community. The shortage of suitable housing forces many military families to occupy inadequate housing units,
thus affecting family morale, or forcing members to occupy housing at rents outside the acceptable range, causing unacceptable financial
hardships as other portions of limited budges are used to offset high housing costs.

IMPACT IF NOT PROVIDED: Units will continue to deteriorate rapidly, resulting in increasing operation, M&R to the government and
inconvenience to residents. Without the project, repair of these units will continue in a costly piecemeal fashion with little or no improvement
in living quality.

ADDITIONAL: This project meets the criteria/scope specified in Air Force Family Housing Guide. An EA has been prepared comparing the
alternatives of new construction, acquisition and status quo operation. Based on the net present values and benefit of this respective
alternative, new construction was found to be most cost effective over the life of the project. The local school authority indicates a capability
exists to accept the increase in the student population generated by this project. No additional school construction will be required. The
construction agent for this project is the Naval Facility Command, resulting in SIOH costs of 6.0%. Base Civil Engineer: Lt Col John Doe,
(123) 456-7890.

PROJECT: REPLACE FAMILY HOUSING (PHASE 2)

REQUIREMENT: Project is required to provide modern and efficient housing for military members and their dependents at Blue AFB.
All units will meet modern housing standards and are programmed IAW the Housing Community Profile. The design will provide a
modern kitchen, living room, family room, bedroom and bath configuration, with ample interior and exterior storage. The number of
bedrooms will range from two to four, as identified in the most recent Housing Requirements and Market Analysis. Units will be
provided with a single-car garage and exterior parking for a second vehicle. Adequate infrastructure support for roads and utilities must
also be provided. This is the seventh phase of a multiphase initiative to replace an additional 219 housing units for Blue AFB. The
Housing Community Profile and Housing Requirements and Market Analysis are elements of the General Plan for Blue AFB, and are the
basis for this project.

CURRENT SITUATION: These existing housing units were constructed in the 1930s and 1970s. They show the effects of age and
heavy use. They have had no major upgrades since construction and do not meet the needs of today’s families, nor do they provide a
modern home environment. The roof, walls, foundations and exterior pavements require major repair or replacement due to age. The
plumbing and electrical systems are antiquated and do not meet current standards for efficiency and safety. Interiors are generally
inadequate by modern criteria. Bathrooms are small and lack adequate closet space. Kitchens have insufficient cabinets, storage and
counter space. Lighting, heating and air conditioning systems require upgrade and replacement. The current Housing Requirements and
Market Analysis and Housing Community Profile renovation costs exceed the current replacement cost. The cost to correct eminent
problems existing with the inventory, space deficiencies and modernization requirements has proven to be more costly then the original
voucher cost and the capitalization combined.

IMPACT IF NOT PROVIDED: Units will continue to deteriorate rapidly, resulting in increasing operation, maintenance and repair to
the government and inconveniences to residents. Without the project, repair of these units will continue in a costly piecemeal fashion
with little or no improvement in living quality.

ADDITIONAL: This project meets the criteria/scope specified in the Air Force Family Housing Guide. An EA has been prepared
comparing the alternatives of new construction, improvement and status quo operation. The EA found new construction is the most cost
effective option. The improvement cost is 80% of the replacement cost. The construction agent for this project is the Army Corps of
Engineers, resulting in SIOH costs of 5.7%. Base Civil Engineer: Lt Col John Doe, (123) 456-7890.

10. DESCRIPTION OF PROPOSED CONSTRUCTION: All site preparation, drainage improvements, concrete slab foundation, brick
    veneer exterior surfaces over concrete block, with decorative interior finishing. Project provides offices, restrooms, counseling and
    meeting rooms, customer waiting area, computer equipment room and interior and exterior child play areas. Includes all utilities,
    parking, landscaping and irrigation system. Air conditioning: 5 tons.
11. REQUIREMENT: 472 SM ADEQUATE: 0 INADEQUATE: 472 SM
PROJECT: Construct Family Housing Management Facility (Current Mission)
REQUIREMENT: An adequate facility is required for managing base owned/operated family housing assets, for assisting all arriving
personnel in finding adequate on or offbase housing, and for managing furnishings for authorized base personnel. The facility must be
located for convenient access by arriving personnel and those already assigned to base housing. It must be handicapped accessible and have
adequate parking for vehicles pulling trailers and small trucks, which may be used by arriving personnel. The facility must provide office
space, a conference room, private counseling rooms, administrative space, a reception and customer waiting area, a customer referral area
with multiple telephones, a computer room and storage space for equipment and publications, a kitchen area for use by families, and interior
and exterior play areas for children of customers. Exterior play areas must be provided with recreation equipment and be fenced for security.
The facility exterior requires landscaping to enhance customer appeal.
CURRENT SITUATION: PROVIDE A GOOD “WORD PICTURE” OF EXISTING CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS. The current
Housing Management function is located in a wood frame structure constructed as an open-bay, central latrine barracks in 1948. The facility
has had little work done in the intervening 45 years to make it an adequate administrative facility. The facility does not have adequate space
to accommodate housing management functions and furnishings management responsibilities. The result is an extremely crowded housing
management office with some office functions dispersed in other buildings. The poor facility presents an unfavorable impression and
“welcome” to the thousands of customers who transit the facility each year. Facility layout is inadequate. The facility is located in the
industrial portion of the base and is not convenient to users. The small building does not have the layout or space to provide necessary
customer support. Counseling rooms are inadequate resulting in customer delays. Existing space affords little privacy to families in
counseling. There is no interior play area for children to use while parents are being counseled on housing opportunities. Lack of storage
space results in open storage or supplies and equipment in office and customer areas.

Heating and air conditioning systems are unreliable and do not adequately support the facility. Age and the environment have taken their
toll on the structure. Floors are uneven, plumbing and electrical systems do not meet modern codes, and walls and ceilings are stained
from water leakage. The facility will be demolished on completion of this replacement project.

IMPACT IF NOT PROVIDED: Unusual and costly resource commitment will be necessary to keep the existing facility habitable. Major
repair or improvement is not an option due to the age and condition of the facility and extensive investment required. Customers will
continue to be served in an extremely cramped, deteriorated and unprofessional environment. Management and operation of housing
functions will continue from multiple facilities, which detracts from the effectiveness of personnel and available for customers support.

ADDITIONAL: This project meets the criteria/scope specified in Air Force Housing Support Facilities Guide. Base Civil Engineer: Lt
Col John Doe, (123) 456-7890.

10. DESCRIPTION OF PROPOSED WORK:
Convey 1,413 existing single and multiplex units and construct 87 units for a privatization end state of 1,500 units on approximately 440
acres of leased lands. Without privatization, MILCON cost for this work is $166M for an anticipated leverage of 6.8:1. Privatized units will
provide modern interior and exterior conveniences and met current space and floor plan requirements.
11. REQUIREMENT: 1,500 UN ADEQUATE: 250 UN INADEQUATE: 1,200 UN

PROJECT: Privatize Military Family Housing (Current Mission)

REQUIREMENT: This project is required to provide modern and efficient housing for military members and their dependents stationed at
Blue AFB. 300 units will be upgraded to meet current life safety codes and to provide a comfortable and appealing living environment
comparable to the off-base civilian community. Additionally, 200 new units will be constructed to reduce the projected deficits. All units
will meet ”whole house” standards and are programmed IAW the Housing Community Profile. Renovated housing will provide a modern
kitchen, living room, family room, bedroom and bath configuration, with ample interior and exterior storage. Living units will be expanded
to meet current space authorizations. Single car garages and off street parking will be provided where deficient. Neighborhood
improvements are required and will include landscaping, playgrounds and recreation areas.

CURRENT SITUATION: This project upgrades and modernizes housing that was constructed in 1958. These 40-year-old houses require
major renovation and repair to correct deterioration resulting from age and heavy use. They have had no major upgrades since construction,
and do meet the needs of today’s families, nor do they provide a modern home improvement. Kitchen and bathroom cabinets and fixtures
are obsolete and deteriorated. Counter tops are warped, stained, and separating at the seams. Plumbing and lighting fixtures are deteriorated
and dated. The electrical systems do meet modern construction cods. Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter protection is not provided for
bathrooms, kitchens, and exterior circuits. Flooring is stained, loose, and mismatched due to the non-availability of original materials for
replacement. Windows, siding, and insulation require replacement. The units have inadequate living space and storage, and no patio or
backyard privacy. Landscaping and recreation areas for housing residents are deficient. Paved areas need renovation.

IMPACT IF NOT PROVIDED: Units will continue to deteriorate rapidly, resulting in increasing operation, M&R costs to the government
and inconvenience to residents. Without this project, repair of these units will continue in a costly, piecemeal fashion with little or no
improvement in living quality. Housing Requirements and Market Analysis shows an on-base housing deficit of 230 units.

WORK ACCOMPLISHED IN PREVIOUS 3 YEARS: None

WORK ACCOMPLISHED FOR NEXT 3 YEARS: None

ADDITIONAL: The installation commander agreed these units are severable according to the criteria contained in the 1999 Air Force
Family Housing Master Plan. This project contains no resale merchandise, services or commercial recreation operations or activities IAW
with the SAF/MI Housing Privatization Interim Operating Instructions memo dated 2 March 1999 and AF/IL memo regarding
coordination with AAFES, DeCA, and MWR Board dated 19 March 1999. A viable pro forma and a preliminary EA will be developed
and provided during the concept approval process, and a certified EA will be accomplished prior to completion of the solicitation process.
The local school authority indicates a capability exists to accept the increased student population generated by this project. In the event
privatization is financially infeasible, the Air Force will execute an improvement project for 300 units at the programmed amount
requested by this project IAW the installation’s Housing Community Profile. Base Civil Engineer: Lt Col John Doe, (123) 456-7890.

The units have inadequate living space and storage, and no patio or backyard privacy. Landscaping and recreation areas for housing
residents are deficient. Paved areas need renovation.

IMPACT IF NOT PROVIDED: Units will continue to deteriorate rapidly, resulting in increasing OMR to the Government and
inconvenience to residents. Without this project, repair of these units will continue in a costly, piecemeal fashion with little or no
improvement in living quality. Housing Requirements and Market Analysis shows an on-base housing deficit of 150 units.

WORK ACCOMPLISHED IN PREVIOUS 3 YEARS: None

WORK ACCOMPLISHED FOR NEXT 3 YEARS: None

ADDITIONAL: An EA has been prepared comparing the alternatives of new construction, improvement, and status quo operation. Based
on the net present values and benefits of the respective alternatives, improvement was found to be the most cost effective over the life of the
project. The cost to improve the units is 60% of the replacement cost. Base Civil Engineer: Lt Col John Doe, (123) 456-7890.

10. DESCRIPTION OF PROPOSED CONSTRUCTION:
Replace existing countertops and metal cabinets with new laminated plastic countertops and wood cabinets in 900 Capehart units. Replace
sinks. Reroute plumbing under sinks. Paint and patch walls and ceilings. Reconfigure the kitchen layout for 200 units.

11. REQUIREMENT: 1,600 UN ADEQUATE: 700 UN INADEQUATE: 900 UN
PROJECT: Provides for replacement of deteriorated kitchen countertops, cabinets, plumbing, and installation of dishwashers and disposers.

REQUIRMENT: Project is required to provide adequate kitchen facilities and prevent damage to interior walls and cabinets due to frozen
pipes.

CURRENT SITUATION: The kitchen cabinets and countertops were installed during the original construction of these units 23 years ago
and have deteriorated beyond repair. A unit survey reveals that the metal kitchen cabinets are stained, warped, dented, and do not close
properly. The countertops are peeled, scratched, and chipped. The existing piping is located in he exterior walls and is subject to freezing
in sub-zero temperatures, resulting in leaks and water damage every winter. All but 200 units had dishwasher and disposers installed in the
1970s. These units are scheduled for accomplishment in the first phase so that the dishwasher and disposers may be installed in conjunction
with replacement of the cabinets.

ADDITIONAL: These units are not scheduled for major repair or improvement work in the future. Residents have identified the kitchen
cabinets and countertops as their only major dissatisfaction with these units. The cost to repair these units is 10% of the replacement costs.

10. DESCRIPTION OF PROPOSED CONSTRUCTION:
Replace debris. Provide chemical or mechanical deodorization. Reconstruct portions of roof, wall, and floor areas. Replace burned
electrical and heat systems, paint interior. Reconfigure kitchen area and provide landscape. Facility number 1003.

11. REQUIREMENT: 1,200 UN ADEQUATE: 900 UN INADEQUATE: 300 UN
PROJECT: Provides for restoration of a three-bedroom company grade Capehart unit damaged by fire.

REQUIRMENT: Project is required to restore the unit to a livable condition. The unit will remain vacant until the repairs are
accomplished.

CURRENT SITUATION: This unit was damaged by fire on 17 October 2000. The furnace heat stack was disconnected, causing wood
framing above the furnace firebox to ignite. A survey has been made to determine if there are similar furnace stacks that need to be
reconnected or replaced.

ADDITIONAL: The base has a deficit of 200 units with a 50-unit deficit in the company grade officer units. The current occupancy rate at
Blue AFB is 98.9 percent. There are a total of 250 families on the waiting list, with seven families waiting for this type of unit. The average
waiting time is 4 to 6 months. The estimated replacement cost for this type of unit is $108,000. This project represents 60 percent of the
replacement cost effective over the life of the project. No personal injuries were suffered. A smoke detector was present and did activate.
The residents were not held liable for the damage. (Also include pertinent information resulting from applicable Report of Survey).
