1. General. This instruction prescribes basic policy and guidance for training United States Air
Force aircrews according to AFPD 11-2, Aircraft Rules and Procedures (AFPD 11-2 establishes
the publications architecture). Undergraduate and Graduate aircrew production is tasked in the
Programmed Flying Training (PFT) document. Undergraduate and Introduction to Fighter
Fundamentals (IFF) training is conducted according to HQ AETC syllabi. Unique, customized,
and/or specialized training programs are defined in AFI 11-2MDS Vol 1 instructions. IAW AFI
33-360, Publications and Forms Management, when this publication is revised (either by an
interim change (IC) or a rewrite), implementing instructions (such as supplements) must be
rewritten, updated using an IC, or, if applicable, certified as current, within 180 days.
     1.1. Program Goals. The USAF Aircrew Training Program (ATP) ensures all aircrew
     members obtain and maintain the certification/qualification and proficiency needed to
     effectively perform their unit’s mission. The objective of the ATP is to develop and maintain
     a high state of mission readiness for immediate and effective employment across the range of
     military operations. Justify dedicated flying hours on the basis of accomplishing peacetime
     missions while maintaining wartime readiness. Structure each training mission to achieve
     optimum training experience.
     1.2. Waiver Authority.
        1.2.1. Unless otherwise specified, HQ USAF/A3O-A is the waiver authority for the
        provisions of this instruction. EXCEPTION: MAJCOM/A3 is the waiver authority for
        individual aircrew requirements, but may not approve blanket or group (two or more
        aircrew) waivers.
        1.2.2. Request waivers through applicable channels to MAJCOM/A3,(or equivalent). As
        applicable, MAJCOM/A3s will forward requests to HQ USAF/A3O-A, with an info copy
        to HQ USAF/A3O-AT.
        1.2.3. Waiver authority for supplemental guidance will be as specified in the supplement
        and approved through higher level coordination authority.
        1.2.3. (AETC) Unless otherwise specified, AETC/A2/3/10 is the overall waiver
        authority for this supplement. AETC/A3F, AETC/A3Q or AETC/A3Z, as appropriate, is
        approval authority for individual personnel exceptions to the policy outlined in this
        supplement caused by special or unusual circumstances. Universal waivers that would
        change the intent of the policy outlined in this supplement are not authorized without
        AETC/ A2/3/10 approval. Waivers may be issued for a maximum of 1 year or until this
        supplement is superseded, whichever occurs first. All waivers must be reviewed and
AFI11-202V1_AETCSUP_I 2 JANUARY 2013                                                         5

        required.
           1.3.3.5.1. The FCR will review formal training programs and syllabi for
           currency, applicability, compliance and effectiveness.
           1.3.3.5.2. Attendees should include program managers from lead commands,
           training representatives from user commands, curriculum developers, formal
           schools, NAF training and standardization offices (if applicable), selected unit
           representatives, and ATS contractors.
        1.3.3.6. Progress Review (PR). Outline procedures for a PR to be accomplished when
        a student fails to progress according to syllabus requirements.
        1.3.3.6. (AETC) For progress review procedures, follow guidance in the appropriate
        volume of AETCI 36-2205 and approved syllabuses.
           1.3.3.6.1. The PR may recommend continuation in training or action IAW AFI
           11-402, Aviation and Parachutist Service, Aeronautical Ratings and Badges, e.g.,
           a Flying Evaluation Board (FEB).

          1.3.3.6.2. If the recommendation is to continue training, then the PR will
          determine the extent of additional training.
    1.3.4. All MAJCOMs. All MAJCOMs will accomplish the following:
       1.3.4.1. Establish an aircrew training office responsible for the overall management
       of the command’s aircrew training program. (Air National Guard (ANG) is
       considered a MAJCOM for purposes of this instruction.)
       1.3.4.1. (AETC) AETC/A3F is the office responsible for management of the AETC
       undergraduate aircrew training programs and United States Air Force Academy
       (USAFA) airmanship programs.          AETC/A3Z is the office responsible for
       management of the AETC graduate aircrew training programs. AETC/A3Q is the
       office responsible for management of the AETC air advisor training programs. The
       appropriate MAJCOM A3T, or equivalent, is the responsible office for training issues
       other than the AETC training mission conducted by AFRC and ANG units gained by
       AETC.
       1.3.4.2. Justify dedicated flying hours on the basis of accomplishing peacetime
       missions and/or maintaining wartime readiness, and structure each training mission to
       achieve optimum training.
       1.3.4.3. Develop theater indoctrination training and ensure aircrews are trained for
       specific theater flight operations. As a minimum, this training will include:
          1.3.4.3.1. A thorough review of theater unique instrument requirements and
          procedures.
          1.3.4.3.2. The use of non-DoD instrument approach procedures.
          1.3.4.3.3. Required instrumentation for specific approaches.
          1.3.4.3.4. Theater weather conditions and annual weather trends.
          1.3.4.3.5. Local area procedures and host nation agreements.
       1.3.4.4. Notify training command headquarters and training units prior to recalling a
       student from a formal school course.
       1.3.4.4. (AETC) Conduct graduate evaluations according to AETCI 36-2206,
       Aircrew Graduate Evaluation Program, and AETCI 36-2207, Survival, Evasion,
       Resistance, and Escape (SERE) Training Systems Evaluation.
          1.3.4.4.1. Students will not be recalled to prevent initiation of any actions
          associated with unsatisfactory performance.
          1.3.4.4.2. Recalling a student may be done only for reasons other than
          performance, i.e., emergencies, unforeseen delays in training, etc.
              1.3.4.4.2.1. ANG units will request approval from NGB/A3O if there is a
              need to recall a student. NGB/A3O will notify training command headquarters
              and the unit prior to recall.
                1.3.4.4.2.1.1. Disposition of an ANG student (return at a later date,
                secondary method, etc.) will be determined as soon as reasonable and
AFI11-202V1_AETCSUP_I 2 JANUARY 2013                                                               9


                     preferably prior to student departing formal course training.
                     1.3.4.4.2.1.2. Determination will be made among home unit, flying training
                     unit and NGB/A3O. All recalls for ANG undergraduate flying training
                     (UFT) students will be IAW AETCI 36-2205 and will not be initiated due to
                     performance deficiencies.
           1.3.4.5. Ensure formal school post-graduate evaluations are accomplished. If the
           aircrew member completed training through an AETC formal undergraduate or
           graduate flying training program, the primary instructor or gaining supervisor, as
           appropriate, will complete the aircrew graduate evaluation survey found in the
           Aircrew Graduate Evaluation Program (AGEP) on the AF portal. The instructor or
           supervisor will complete the survey at the specified point in the training syllabus or
           when notified the survey is required.
           1.3.4.6. Send proposals for amending existing formal school course prerequisites and
           syllabi or deleting obsolete courses to the training command for approval.
2. Qualification Training. This section specifies minimum training requirements for initial
qualification training, requalification, conversion/difference qualification, multiple qualification,
senior officer qualification, and mission qualification training.
   2.1. Initial Qualification Training (IQT). Training needed to qualify for basic aircrew
   duties in an assigned crew position for a specific aircraft, without regard for the unit’s
   operational mission.
       2.1.1. General Requirements. All personnel maintaining flying status will meet the
       requirements listed in the sub-paragraphs below. Unless specified in applicable AFI 11-2
       MDS Vol 1, the primary method of IQT is to attend and complete the appropriate formal
       training course listed in the ETCA. Completing the appropriate formal course satisfies all
       IQT requirements. When attendance is not practical or quotas are not available, units will
       request waivers as specified in the applicable AFI 11-2MDS Vol 1, to conduct in-unit
       IQT, using formal school courseware (see also paragraph 2.1.4). Note: Before performing
       flying duties in USAF fixed-wing aircraft, helicopter-only qualified pilots must meet the
       eligibility criteria for and complete USAF Undergraduate Pilot Training (UPT) or Fixed-
       Wing Qualification (FWQ) training. Waiver authority is HQ AETC/A3. See also AFI
       11-402.
       2.1.1. (AETC) All in-unit training requests must include justification that addresses
       both AFI 11-202, Volume 1 requirements: (1) impractical attendance and (2) lack of a
       quota. The word ―quota‖ refers to the Formal Training Unit (FTU) resources (academics,
       Aircrew training Devises [ATD], sorties, etc) required to accomplish the training.
       AETC/A3R manages FTU quotas and can make adjustments as required. Any request
       due to a quota not being available for FTU training must include the denied quota
       request. When approved, in-unit training invokes the same active duty service
       commitment as FTU attendance, according to AFI 36-2107, Active Duty Service
       Commitments (ADSC).
           2.1.1.1. Aircrew members entered into in-unit IQT leading to qualification or
           requalification will be dedicated to that program; i.e., give training requirements
10                                          AFI11-202V1_AETCSUP_I 2 JANUARY 2013


        priority over non-training related duties. EXCEPTION: Supervisory personnel may
        continue their normal duties as time permits.
        2.1.1.2. Training time limitations for IQT completion are contained in applicable AFI
        11-2MDS Vol 1. In-unit IQT will begin no later than 45 days (90 days for the Air
        Reserve Components [ARC]) after reporting to a new duty station or unit, unless
        waived by the MAJCOM aircrew training function.
        2.1.1.3. Physical Examinations. Complete flight physical examinations IAW AFI
        48-123, Medical Examinations and Standards, and AFI 44-170, Preventive Health
        Assessment. Aircrew members who fail to successfully complete a flight physical
        may not perform inflight duties until they successfully complete the examination. For
        further action to be taken on personnel who fail to complete a required flight physical
        examination when due, see AFI 11-402.
        2.1.1.4. Physiological Training. Complete physiological training IAW AFI 11-403,
        Aerospace Physiological Training Program.
            2.1.1.4.1. Requirements are waived for personnel assigned to inactive flying
            status codes (FSC) J, K and L (except individuals selected for indoctrination
            flying, FSC T), and for personnel performing remotely piloted aircraft (RPA)
            ground control station aircrew duties (FSC V and Z). Requalification is completed
            IAW AFI 11-403.
            2.1.1.4.2. Personnel who perform flying duty in other than their rated specialty
            (for example, airborne command post duty) must maintain currency in
            physiological training.
            2.1.1.4.3. Personnel who are delinquent in physiological training will not be
            scheduled for flight duty.
        2.1.1.5. Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape (SERE) Training. Complete
        training IAW AFI 16-1301, Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape (SERE)
        Program. For action to be taken on personnel who fail to meet training standards
        while enrolled in a USAF survival school, see AFI 11-402. Note: SERE training is
        not required for cadet aircrew.
     2.1.2. IQT Prerequisites. Before entering qualification training, each aircrew member
     must comply with the appropriate formal course training prerequisites prescribed in the
     applicable syllabus. Due to quota allocations, scheduling limitations and fiscal
     constraints, SERE training (Ex. S-V-80/90) for ANG students is desired but not required
     for entry into IQT. Water survival training requirement is prescribed in the MDS-specific
     formal course syllabus. All ANG members will comply with training requirements in
     AFI 16-1301 and receive training prior to their first operational assignment.
     2.1.3. Ground Training Requirements. (For in-unit IQT, commanders will obtain and
     use the current formal school courseware, if available.)
        2.1.3.1. Accomplish academic training requirements as directed in the applicable
        syllabus.
        2.1.3.2. For written examinations, comply with AFI 11-202 Vol 2, Aircrew
        Standardization/Evaluation Program, and the applicable AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2.
AFI11-202V1_AETCSUP_I 2 JANUARY 2013                                                         11


         2.1.3.3. Accomplish emergency parachute training, local area survival, AFE, egress,
         and ejection seat training (as applicable) before the first flight IAW AFI 11-2MDS
         Vol 1, AFI 11-301 Vol 1, Aircrew Flight Equipment Program, and AFI 16-1301.
         (N/A for RPA aircrew.)
         2.1.3.4. Aircrew chemical defense ensemble (ACDE) training (to include ACDE
         egress training and emergency parachute training with ACDE) must be completed
         prior to the first ACDE flight.
         2.1.3.5. Accomplish combat survival training (CST), conduct after capture training,
         and water survival training IAW AFI 16-1301. See also AFI 11-2MDS Vol 1, AFI
         11-2MDS Vol 1 Ready Aircrew Program (RAP) tasking memorandum, and/or
         MAJCOM Supplements, as applicable.
         2.1.3.6. Applicable ground training (i.e., simulators, aircraft systems, etc.)
         accomplished at the formal school establishes due dates for subsequent continuation
         training. If completion dates are unknown, use the evaluation completion date on the
         formal school generated AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification, or AF Form
         8a, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification (Multiple Aircraft).
     2.1.4. In-Unit IQT Requirements. Approved in-unit training must be accomplished
     IAW applicable formal school courseware and the following guidance:
         2.1.4.1. Flying training lessons should be completed in order; however, if mission
         scheduling or student progress dictates otherwise, the unit commander or designated
         training supervisor may change the order.
         2.1.4.2. Training syllabi will establish a maximum time lapse between training
         missions. Failure to accomplish training as scheduled will require documentation and
         corrective action.
         2.1.4.3. With operations group commander (OG/CC) (or equivalent) approval, IQT
         requirements may be completed during operational missions under the supervision of
         an instructor of like specialty. Comply with restrictions in appropriate AFI 11-2 MDS
         Vol 1, MAJCOM directives, and applicable operation order (OPORD).
  2.2. Requalification Training. An aircrew member is unqualified upon expiration of his or
  her qualification evaluation, loss of currency exceeding 6 months (for currency items
  specified in applicable AFI 11-2MDS Vol 1, IAW paragraph 3.4.3.2), or completion of a
  qualification evaluation in a different MDS (unless multiple qualification has been approved
  prior to the evaluation), whichever occurs first. The duration of unqualified time is from the
  date the aircrew member became unqualified until the specific retraining start date. For
  aircrew members who are not authorized multiple qualification and who complete a
  qualification evaluation in a different MDS, members must complete requalification training
  as specified below to regain qualification in the original MDS. For all aircrew members
  except flight surgeons, requalification requirements are as follows: (MAJCOMS may provide
  more restrictive guidance and may adjust requirements as necessary to allow for aircrew
  member experience level and similarity of aircraft types. Provide specific guidance in
  command supplements or AFI 11-2 MDS Vol 1.) (Terms TX-1, TX-2 and TX-3 identify
  formal courses required, from longest to shortest course.) (As noted below, completing the
  ETCA formal school flying training course is the desired standard. When attendance is not
12                                            AFI11-202V1_AETCSUP_I 2 JANUARY 2013


  practical or quotas are not available, units will request waivers as specified in the applicable
  AFI 11-2MDS Vol 1, to conduct in-unit IQT, using formal school courseware.)
  2.2. (AETC) Requalification Training. Aircrews enrolled in an AETC formal course will
  not fly outside the prescribed syllabus once they start any portion of a flying training
  program (including academics and simulator training) for the newly assigned mission design
  series (MDS) aircraft.
     2.2.1. Unqualified up to 39 months at the end of a non-flying assignment, or up to
     51 months at the end of any active flying assignment. Complete training in all
     delinquent items (as applicable), additional training as directed by the squadron
     commander, and a requalification evaluation IAW AFI 11-202 Vol 2 and AFI 11-2MDS
     Vol 2. An ETCA formal school flying training course (TX-3) satisfies this requalification
     requirement, if specified in the applicable AFI 11-2MDS Vol 1.
     2.2.2. Unqualified 39 or more months at the end of a non-flying assignment, or 51
     or more months at the end of any active flying assignment, up to 8 Years. Complete
     the appropriate ETCA formal school flying training course (TX-2) and a flight evaluation
     IAW AFI 11-202 Vol 2 and AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2.
     2.2.3. Unqualified in MDS Over 8 Years. Complete the appropriate ETCA formal
     school flying training (TX-1) and a flight evaluation IAW AFI 11-202 Vol 2 and AFI 11-
     2MDS Vol 2.
     2.2.4. Instructor Requalification. IAW AFI 11-202 Vol 2, and AFI 11-2 MDS Vols 1
     and 2.
  2.3. Conversion Qualification Training.
     2.3.1. Conversion training is normally associated with a unit conversion to another MDS.
     Conversion training requires completion of a formal school qualification course. For unit
     conversions, when formal school courses are not available, MAJCOMs will develop and
     coordinate with the training command, in-unit training plans that maximize use of highly
     experienced personnel as the initial cadre. See also AFI 11-202 Vol 2 for instructor
     qualification and flight examiner certification guidance.
     2.3.2. Submit requests for conversion qualification training IAW the applicable AFI 11-
     2MDS Vol 1.
  2.4. Difference Training.
     2.4.1. Difference training is required for qualification in a different series aircraft in the
     same MDS. When MAJCOMs determine the differences between series are great enough,
     the training required is a formal TX course.
     2.4.2. Difference qualification training requirements will be established in AFI 11-2
     MDS Vol 1.
  2.5. Transition Training. MAJCOMs may prescribe shortened versions of qualification
  training for aircrew members cross-flowing from another military aircraft to allow credit for
  acquired aviation proficiency. Requirements will be established in AFI 11-2 MDS Vol 1.
  2.6. Multiple Qualification. MAJCOMs may authorize qualification in more than one
  MDS aircraft for crewmembers only when such action is directed by command mission
AFI11-202V1_AETCSUP_I 2 JANUARY 2013                                                           13


  requirements and is economically justifiable. This authority cannot be delegated below the
  MAJCOM level, except HQ AFMC, which may further delegate, but not lower than wing
  commander.
  2.6. (AETC) Multiple Qualification. AETC/A2/3/10 is the approval authority for all
  multiple qualifications. Exception: AETC/A3Q is the delegated approval authority for
  multiple qualifications in Air Advisor aircraft. Route approval requests through AETC/A3V.
  Note: Due to the specific mission requirements of the 306th Flying Training Group (306
  FTG), the following multiple qualifications are approved as required: sailplanes for 94th
  Flying Training Squadron (94 FTS) assigned and attached personnel (to include cadets) and
  T-41 and T-51 for the 557 FTS assigned and attached personnel. The 306 FTG/CC will
  certify all multiple qualifications and provide appropriate documentation to ARMS
  personnel. Multiple qualification certification memorandums for record will be filed in the
  aircrew member’s flight evaluation folder (FEF).
     2.6.1. Unless required for unit mission accomplishment, commanders must not permit
     aircrew members qualified in primary mission aircraft to maintain qualification in
     support aircraft.
     2.6.2. General officers will only maintain qualification in a single MDS. Difference
     qualification in variants of the same MDS is authorized, but is not permitted when
     qualification involves formal conversion training, IAW AFI MDS Vol 2.
         2.6.2.1. Approval authority for general officer multiple qualification is AF/CC.
     2.6.3. Multiple qualification does not apply to aircrew members selected for
     reassignment to another MDS who attend training prior to PCS. Flying squadron
     commanders will review reassignment training and validate requirement for additional
     qualification prior to aircrew member flights in original aircraft. Additional qualification
     authorization under this exception terminates when the aircrew member signs out from
     the losing organization.
  2.7. Senior Officer Qualification and Performance Requirements. Senior officers
  (colonel selects and above) whose position requires operational flying will complete the
  appropriate formal training course unless already qualified. Aircraft qualification will include
  instrument qualification and an AF Form 8/8a flight evaluation. A senior officer course that
  does not result in an AF Form 8/8a flight evaluation will not permit unsupervised flying. In
  addition, senior officers will comply with paragraph 3.1.4 of this instruction. Note: All senior
  officers must complete a formal training course qualification program that results in an AF
  Form 8/8a flight evaluation prior to flying an aircraft with passengers on board. Exceptions
  to this policy must be approved by HQ USAF/A3/5 (colonels and colonel selects); exceptions
  for general officers must be approved by AF/CC.
     2.7.1. General officers in commander billets approved for operational flying may fly
     without an instructor in their primary assigned aircraft if they are current and qualified
     and maintain Mission Ready (MR)/Combat Mission Ready (CMR), or Basic Mission
     Capable (BMC) status IAW the applicable AFI 11-2MDS Vol 1.
     2.7.2. All other general officers and general officer commanders maintaining Basic
     Aircraft Qualification (BAQ) status or less, must fly with an instructor.
14                                           AFI11-202V1_AETCSUP_I 2 JANUARY 2013


     2.7.3. When approved for operational flying, general officers authorized to fly single-
     place aircraft are limited to HQ USAF/CC, commanders, and MAJCOM/A3s. See AFI
     11-401, Aviation Management, for specific general officer flying authorizations. If
     approved by AF/CC for operational flying, numbered Air Force general officer vice
     commanders may also fly single-place aircraft. General officers maintaining BAQ in
     single-place aircraft require an instructor pilot in the flight.
     2.7.4. Except for HQ USAF/CC, HQ USAF/CV, MAJCOM commanders (or
     equivalents), and Combatant Command commanders (when filled by a USAF general
     officer), and when those officers are in operational flying status, general officers who are
     in operational flying status and who do not directly oversee Operational Support Airlift
     (OSA) aircraft and/or Very Important Person/Special Airlift Mission (VIP/SAM)
     operations should not fly OSA/VIP/SAM aircraft. MAJCOM commanders may develop
     further OSA/VIP/SAM guidelines as necessary.
     2.7.5. As a minimum, HQ USAF/CC and HQ USAF/CV will maintain BAQ in their
     assigned aircraft when they maintain operational flying status. Minimum and maximum
     sortie rates do not apply.
     2.7.6. Unless further restricted by AFI 11-2MDS Vol 1, colonels and colonel selects who
     comply with paragraph 2.7 may fly without an instructor in their primary assigned
     aircraft.
     2.7.7. MAJCOMs may establish additional guidelines and flight requirements as
     necessary.
     2.7.8. Test pilots of any rank assigned to AFMC, AFMC civilian employees who have
     previously graduated from a military test pilot school (or equivalent), contract personnel
     who work under a government contract administered by AFMC or DCMA who have
     previously graduated from a military test pilot school (or equivalent), and Aggressor and
     Thunderbird selectees (with MAJCOM concurrence), may attend senior officer
     qualification training courses.
  2.8. Mission Qualification Training (MQT). The purpose of MQT is to qualify aircrew
  members in assigned aircrew positions to perform the command or unit mission. AFI 11-2
  MDS Vol 1 prescribes minimum training requirements to qualify individuals in unit
  missions. All crew members will complete MQT before entering special mission (e.g.,
  Special Operations Low Level (SOLL) II, etc.) certification/qualification, unless the special
  mission training is specifically directed as pre-MQT in AFI 11-2MDS Vol 1, e.g., LANTIRN
  training.
     2.8.1. For aircraft with multiple mission certifications/qualifications, document the
     various courses and governing instructions in each applicable AFI 11-2MDS Vol 1.
     Provide a brief description of training required to transition between mission sets.
     2.8.2. Upgrade/Special Mission Training. With OG/CC (or equivalent) approval,
     upgrade and special certification/qualification training requirements may be completed
     during operational missions under the supervision of an instructor of like specialty.
     Comply with restrictions in appropriate AFI 11-2MDS Vol 1, MAJCOM directives, and
     any applicable OPORDs.
AFI11-202V1_AETCSUP_I 2 JANUARY 2013                                                        15


      2.8.3. (Added-AETC) An AF Form 4348, USAF Air Crew Training Certifications
      documenting certifications by assigned flying unit and primary MDS, will be maintained
      for all squadron personnel and personnel attached to the squadron for flying. For aircrew
      members with aircraft certifications in multiple MDS aircraft which do not require
      qualification in each aircraft (i.e. F-16C and F-16CM), only one AF Form 4348 is
      required; specify the primary mission MDS designation.
         2.8.3.1. (Added-AETC) Unit Stan/Eval will document all initial, downgrade and re-
         certifications for aircrew assigned/attached to their flying unit to indicate a
         chronological history of certifications of aircrew while assigned/attached to their
         flying unit.
         2.8.3.2. (Added-AETC) During review of individual training folders, review
         previous certification documents to determine all applicable certifications of new
         assigned/attached aircrew member. Then, document applicable aircrew certifications
         accepted by the gaining flying unit commander on a new AF Form 4348.
         2.8.3.3. (Added-AETC) The squadron commander (SQ/CC) or other individual
         designated by the SQ/CC will sign a one line entry below all other entries on the AF
         Form 4348 verifying that above certification transcriptions are accurate.

     Office. The SARM office will ensure the unit letter of Xs matches the qualifications
     listed on the AF Form 4324, Aircraft Assignment/ Aircrew Qualification Worksheet. As a
     minimum, the SARM office will perform a monthly audit to ensure aircrew member’s
     ARMS profile assignments reflect the unit letter of Xs and member’s certified AF Forms
     4324.
  3.3. Training Events/Profiles. Aircrew members’ CT and additional (ground) training
  events/profiles are maintained in ARMS. Commanders have the option of monitoring AF-
  wide awareness training (e.g. Resource Protection) for aircrew members in ARMS.
     3.3.1. Use the following forms when documenting aircrew training in ARMS (If
     additional forms are needed, see AFI 33-360 for guidance): Note: Reports and updates
     to ARMS generated from AF-approved automated systems (e.g. ARMS, PEX, TIMS)
     may be used as source documentation for CT provided these reports contain the
     minimum required elements. Updates generated from an automated system must be
     validated by a mission review process.
     3.3.1. (AETC) 1 Non-grounding additional training events and/or events that do not
     require instructor certification may be entered using TIMS/GTIMS.
        3.3.1.1. Additional Training. Use AF Form 1522, ARMS Additional Training
        Accomplishment Report, to document aircrew ground training for processing into
        ARMS. Training events required to be taught by a certified instructor (e.g. CBRNE,
        small arms), as well as grounding events (e.g. ground egress training), must be
        documented on the AF Form 1522 and signed by an instructor.
        3.3.1.1. (AETC) 7 (Added). Non-grounding training events and/or events that do
        not require instructor certification may be entered using TIMS/GTIMS.
            3.3.1.1.1. AF Form 1522 may also be used to document training accomplished by
            a single individual when no instructor is involved (e.g. computer based training).
18                                      AFI11-202V1_AETCSUP_I 2 JANUARY 2013


        In this case, the form may be emailed directly from the individual's official e-mail
        account to a unit aviation resource manager’s official e-mail account.
        3.3.1.1.2. Training and other non-grounding events accomplished by other
        agencies (e.g. fire extinguisher training) but without documentation must be
        documented on the AF Form 1522.
        3.3.1.1.3. Events that do not require a formal course of instruction (e.g. SOF
        duties) may be documented on a locally developed form for processing into
        ARMS. Locally developed forms must contain the minimum elements found on
        the AF Form 1522, with the exception of instructor certification. Refer to AFI 33-
        360 for additional guidance.
        3.3.1.1.4. Training events accomplished by other agencies and documented on
        another form and/or certificate may be photocopied and annotated in the lower
        right corner with the ARMS training event ID, date of input, signature of
        instructor conducting the training (for instructor led events – i.e. CATMS, aircrew
        flight equipment training, etc.), initials of the individual processing the ARMS
        transaction, date of audit, and the initials of the individual who audited the ARMS
        transaction.
        3.3.1.1.5. For training events maintained in ARMS that are accomplished by a
        single individual when no instructor is involved (e.g. computer based training),
        provide a copy of the certificate to the unit SARM office. The SARM office will
        maintain a copy of the certificate as a source document.
        3.3.1.1.6. Reports and updates to ARMS generated from AF-approved automated
        systems may be used as source documentation for continuation training provided
        these reports contain the minimum required elements listed in paragraph 3.3.1.1.4
        Updates generated from an automated system must be validated by a review
        process.
     3.3.1.2. Continuation Training. CT events will be logged in Zulu date to match the
     AFTO Forms 781 and the Flight Authorizations. MAJCOMs will establish specific
     criteria and forms for documenting CT. With MAJCOM approval, units may develop
     local mission accomplishment reports and/or training accomplishment reports to
     document CT for processing into ARMS. MAJCOMs will establish minimum
     elements required for locally developed forms.
     3.3.1.2. (AETC) Criteria for documenting continuation training (CT) are established
     in each MDS-specific volume 1. Training accomplishments will be annotated on the
     appropriate Zulu date; therefore, credit training accomplished after the Zulu training
     cycle towards the next training cycle. Units may use Training Integrated
     Management System (TIMS), Graduate Training Integrated Management System
     (GTIMS), or an AETC-authorized MDS-specific training management system (TMS)
     for processing training into ARMS. In addition, units may develop local mission
     accomplishment reports and training accomplishment reports to document CT for
     processing into ARMS. Locally developed reports will contain the following
     minimum elements:

            3.3.1.2.13. (Added-AETC) Initials of individual auditing the inputs into ARMS
            database.
  3.4. Currency. Currency requirements for aircrew members will be listed in AFI 11-2MDS
  Vol 1.
     3.4.1. MAJCOMs determine similar equipment or systems for aircrew members who fly
     more than one mission or design aircraft.
     3.4.2. MAJCOM/A3s may waive currency requirements for aircraft that are unique to an
     organization when accomplishment is not practical. In such cases, commanders will
     ensure that aircrew members are current and certified/qualified in all normal and
     emergency procedures before unsupervised flight.
     3.4.3. Recurrency Training.
        3.4.3.1. Loss of Currency up to 6 Months. An aircrew member must demonstrate
        proficiency with an instructor (or designated supervisor, when specified in the
        applicable AFI 11-2MDS Vol 1) in all delinquent items.
        3.4.3.2. Loss of Currency Exceeding 6 Months. AFI 11-2 MDS Vol 1 will
        establish which currency items result in unqualified status requiring requalification
        according to paragraph 2.2, and which currency items do not result in unqualified
        status allowing recurrency to be regained according to paragraph 3.4.3.1.
  3.5. Proration of Training. When determining training requirements, prorate an aircrew
  member not available for flying duties (for example, PCS, nonflying TDY, duty not
  including flying [DNIF] status, or emergency leave).
     3.5.1. Proration does not apply to individuals who are available for 15 days or less, who
     will not incur training requirements.
20                                          AFI11-202V1_AETCSUP_I 2 JANUARY 2013


     3.5.2. For individuals available for flying duties for 16 days or more, requirements
     prorated are in direct proportion to the number of days of nonavailability. Do not prorate
     for nonavailability of 15 days or less.
     3.5.3. For every 30 days of nonavailability beyond 15 days, prorate training requirements
     one month, but not to less than one event. Additional proration guidance may be
     established in AFI 11-2MDS Vol 1.
  3.6. Failure to Complete Continuation Training Requirements.
     3.6.1. Declare individuals in Status of Resources and Training System (SORTS) non-
     mission ready (N-MR), non-combat mission ready (N-CMR), non-basic mission capable
     (N-BMC), or non-basic aircraft qualified (N-BAQ) if they fail to complete periodic
     ground or flying continuation training requirements defined in paragraph 3.1.5 and in AFI
     11-2MDS Vol 1.
     3.6.2. Individuals who fail to accomplish minimum CT requirements and subsequently
     lose currency must fly in supervised status when currency in the item is required for the
     particular flight (unless otherwise directed in the applicable AFI 11-2 MDS Vol 1). If
     failure to accomplish the minimum requirement results in grounding, individuals will not
     fly as aircrew members and will not perform aircrew duties until the requirement is
     accomplished.
     3.6.3. Suspend aircrew members assigned to active flying positions who fail to attain and
     maintain aircrew qualification, when such action is within the member’s control, IAW
     AFI 11-402.
     3.6.4. Document decisions to suspend, retain or regress aircrew member status following
     failure of the individual to meet required standards IAW AFI 11-202 Vol 2 and/or AFI
     11-2MDS Vol 1 and/or Vol 2.
  3.7. Requirements Before PCS or TDY by Members on Active Flying Status. The
  following paragraphs apply to flying personnel departing PCS from their old station or
  departing for a non-flying TDY from their permanent station.
     3.7.1. Aircrew members should complete a proportionate share of flying requirements by
     the end of the month preceding the date of departure.
     3.7.2. Complete flight physical and physiological training requirements before departing,
     if the due date occurs within three months after departure date (CONUS assignments), or
     if the due date occurs prior to DEROS (overseas assignments). Air University graduating
     students may delay physiological refresher training until they arrive at their new duty
     location or formal flying training base, if the assigned base is a location with a
     physiological training facility.
  3.8. Requirements Before Removal from Active Flying. The following paragraphs apply
  to flying personnel being retired, separated, placed in inactive status, or reassigned to
  nonflying positions. Paragraph 3.1.5 applies.
     3.8.1. Training requirements apply until the last day of the fourth month prior to an
     individual’s removal from active flying. For example, a person who retires or starts
     terminal leave on 1 July must complete requirements through 31 March; or, if a person is
     reassigned to a nonflying position on 15 November, he must complete requirements
AFI11-202V1_AETCSUP_I 2 JANUARY 2013                                                        21


     through 31 July. MAJCOMs may extend specific training requirement applicability,
     based on unit mission requirements, on a case-by-case basis.
     3.8.2. Refresher physiological training and academic refresher courses are not required if
     individuals on active flying status are current, and if removal from active flying status
     occurs during the 4-month period after the due date.
  3.9. Requirements While in Inactive Flying Status.
     3.9.1. Personnel placed in inactive status will not complete flying and ground training
     requirements of this instruction and AFI 11-2MDS Vol 1.
     3.9.2. Physical qualification must be maintained according to AFI 48-123 and AFI 44-
     170, except for flying personnel in aviation service codes (ASCs) 6J, 7J, 8J, and 9J, GJ
     and HJ. When inactive members in the preceding ASCs have been selected and
     confirmed for assignment to aircrew duties, these individuals must be in compliance with
     paragraph 3.1.5 before performing inflight duties. Individuals will regain their physical
     qualification prior to PCS/PCA to an active flying assignment.
  3.10. Aircrews Flying in Non-US Air Force Aircraft and with Non-US Air Force
  Units. Air Force aircrews performing appropriate duties in non-US Air Force aircraft IAW
  AFI 11-401, or on duty with or attached to non-US Air Force units for flying, are only
  required to maintain a current flight physical and review their flight records IAW AFI 11-
  401. Aircrew members affected by this paragraph are not required to maintain currency in
  USAF physiological training, but must regain physiological qualification (when required)
  prior to performing aircrew duty in USAF aircraft. See also AFI 11-202 Vol 2.
  3.11. Flight Surgeon Requirements. Flight surgeon flying requirements are according to
  the appropriate AFI 11-2 MDS Vol 1, but in no case are they less than those in Table 1
  Provide assigned and attached flight surgeons every opportunity to fly in the unit’s primary
  mission aircraft. Flight surgeons must fly at least 50 percent of their annual minimum
  requirements in primary unit aircraft unless assigned or attached to operational units
  equipped only with single place aircraft or deployed away from their primary unit for more
  than 90 days. Waiver authority for this paragraph is AFMSA/SG3P (send info copy to HQ
  USAF/A3O-AT and appropriate MAJCOM/SG office).

NOTES:
         1.       Flight surgeons may log more than one sortie per day; however, no more than one
              sortie per single calendar day will be credited towards semi-annual and annual sortie
              requirements in Table 1. (Credit hours flown IAW AFI 11-401.) EXCEPTION:
              Credit ARC flight surgeons with a maximum of two sorties for separate flights
              performed in a single calendar day, provided the interval between flights does not
              exceed 60 days and a minimum of six missions are flown each six months.
         2.       A night sortie is one on which either takeoff or landing and at least 50 percent of
              flight duration or one hour, whichever is less, occurs during night time, as defined in
              AFI 11-401.
         3.      Flight surgeons are conditional fliers and must meet DODFMR (DOD Financial
              Management Regulation) flying requirements for entitlement to ACIP. See also AFI
              11-421, Aviation Resource Management.
         4.       To maintain currency, time between flights must not be more than 60 days.
              Notify the MAJCOM/SG when time between flights exceeds 60 days. MAJCOMs
              establish procedures for flight surgeons to regain flying currency.
         5.       Squadron aviation resource managers will set up flight surgeon training profiles
              on an annual cycle. Reference Attachment 2 Table A2.1 for ARMS training event
              identifiers.
         6.       Notify the MAJCOM/SG when flight surgeons fail to meet semi-annual or annual
              sortie requirements. MAJCOMs establish procedures to assess continued active
              flying authorization. Place a copy of the MAJCOM/SG notification in the member’s

Table 1. (AETC) Flight Surgeon Sortie Requirements (See Notes).

Sortie                              Semi-Annual Period                  Annual Sorties
Total                               Minimum: 6                          Minimum: 12
Night                               Minimum: 1                          Minimum: 2
Notes:
1. Flight surgeons may log more than one sortie per day; however, no more than one sortie per single
calendar day will be credited towards semi-annual and annual sortie requirements in Table 1. (Credit
hours flown IAW AFI 11-401.) EXCEPTION: Credit ARC flight surgeons with a maximum of two
sorties for separate flights performed in a single calendar day, provided the interval between flights
does not exceed 60 days and a minimum of six missions are flown each six months.
2. A night sortie is one on which either takeoff or landing and at least 50 percent of flight duration or
one hour, whichever is less, occurs during night time, as defined in AFI 11-401.
3. Flight surgeons are conditional fliers and must meet DODFMR (DOD Financial Management
Regulation) flying requirements for entitlement to ACIP. See also AFI 11-421, Aviation Resource
Management.
4. (AETC) If the time between flights exceeds 60 days or a flight surgeon fails to meet
semiannual or annual sortie requirements, the SARM office will notify the host aviation resource
management (HARM) office who will then notify the AETC Surgeon’s office (AETC/SGP).
Maintain AETC/SG notification memorandum in the member’s training folder until the member
completes a creditable flight. AETC flight surgeons unable to complete the currency or training
requirements are also required to notify AETC/SGP in writing explaining why they were not able
to complete the requirements (TDY, deployments, unavailable aircraft, illness, injury, etc.). The
noncurrent flight surgeon must retake the On-line Flight Surgeon Test (via Air Force Medical
Service Knowledge Exchange, Aerospace Operations, Flight Medicine, Operational and Flight
Medicine, On-line Flight Surgeon Test), complete all required life support and egress training,
and read/complete all required FCIF before their next flight. In fixed-wing passenger-carrying
aircraft (including the T-1A), training should include emergency ground egress (land and water),
operation of the hatches, use of emergency oxygen systems, and location and use of firefighting
equipment. In fighter/trainer type aircraft, training should include emergency ground egress,
ejection procedures, seat operation, control procedures unique to the rear cockpit, and canopy
operation. For helicopters, review land and water egress, location and use of firefighting
equipment, and restraint devices.
5. Squadron aviation resource managers will set up flight surgeon training profiles on an annual
cycle. Reference Attachment 2 Table A2.1 for ARMS training event identifiers.
6. (AETC) AF/SG3P has oversight on all flight surgeon API-5 authorizations. AETC/SG
coordinates annually with AF/SG3P to assess/validate all AETC active flying authorizations. The
SARM office will notify AETC/SGP when flight surgeons fail to meet semi-annual or annual
training requirements. Maintain AETC/SGP notification memorandum in the member’s training
folder until completion of the next annual training cycle.

    3.12. Requirements for X-Prefix Fliers. Requirements for X-prefix fliers are according to
    the appropriate AFI 11-2 MDS Vol 1, but in no case are they less than those in Table 2
 24                                          AFI11-202V1_AETCSUP_I 2 JANUARY 2013


Table 2. Requirements for X-Prefix Fliers (See Note).

ARC           Minimum: 9                                Minimum: 18

Note: To maintain currency, time between flights must not be more than 30 days. MAJCOMs
establish procedures for X-prefix fliers to regain flying currency.
4. Upgrade Training. See applicable AFI 11-2 MDS Vol 1 for specific instructions for
additional requirements.
5. Aircrew Training System (ATS). ATS is a system wherein a civilian contractor provides
academic, simulator, and other designated aircrew training. ATS courses are listed in the
applicable AFI 11-2 MDS Vol 1.
   5.1. Applicability. Guidance applies to all aircrew members attending either formal schools
   using ATS courseware or ATS refresher/phase training, or units conducting secondary
   method training utilizing formal courseware.
   5.2. Students. ATS students will enroll on a full-time basis to ensure their training is
   completed in a timely and uninterrupted manner. Students will be relieved of duties not
   directly related to training. EXCEPTION: Supervisory personnel may continue their normal
   duties as time permits when this training is conducted at home station.
   5.3. Course Prerequisites. Commanders will ensure ATS students complete ATS course
   prerequisites as outlined in the applicable syllabus or AFI 11-2MDS Vol 1.
   5.4. Objectives. Lesson objective descriptions, remediation procedures, specific training
   evaluation criteria, administration procedures and scheduling guidelines/procedures are
   found in the applicable course syllabus or AFI 11-2MDS Vol 1.
   5.5. Unsatisfactory Student Progress:
      5.5.1. If a student’s training progress is unsatisfactory, the contractor will notify the
      appropriate government representative (wing training, operations officer, etc.). Following
      review of the student's record, the government representative will determine whether to
      continue or terminate training.
      5.5.2. The contractor will provide written feedback to the unit commander or training
      office for students who display substandard performance.
   5.6. Courseware Changes. Submit formal school courseware changes through appropriate
   MAJCOM channels to the training command. The training command will coordinate with the
   command responsible for overseeing the ATS contract, if different than the training
   command. Submit all other courseware changes to the MAJCOM responsible for overseeing
   the ATS contract.
   5.7. Source Document. Changes to aircrew qualifications (including training profiles) that
   are tracked in ARMS will be documented on the AF Form 4324, Aircraft
AFI11-202V1_AETCSUP_I 2 JANUARY 2013                                                        25


   Assignment/Aircrew Qualification Worksheet. Forms will be certified by the appropriate
   agency and provided to the Squadron Aviation Resource Management office.
6. Ancillary Training. Reference prescribing AFIs and the ETCA website to determine
ancillary training requirements.
   6.1. MAJCOM aircrew training offices will coordinate publications issues (paragraph
   1.3.3.1). Supported commands will provide inputs to lead commands. Lead commands will
   provide inputs to HQ USAF/A3O-AT. If issues cannot be readily resolved, waivers or
   exceptions to policy may be requested IAW paragraph 1.2. Comply with existing guidance in
   the source establishing the training requirement until the source is changed, a waiver is
   granted, or an exception to policy is approved. EXCEPTION: MAJCOMs may establish
   more restrictive guidance; waivers or exceptions to policy are only required when the intent
   is to be less restrictive than the source publication.
7. Standard Training Event identifiers. Attachment 2 lists the training event identifiers to
use for all Air Force personnel in ARMS.
8. Hours-per-Crewmember-per-Month/Sorties-per-Crewmember-per-Month
Report. MAJCOMs will submit quarterly Hours-per-Crewmember-per-Month/Sorties-per-
Crewmember-per-Month (HCM/SCM) report (RCS: HAF-XO(Q)0502) to HQ USAF/A3O-AT
by the 15th of the month following each calendar quarter. Submit data requirements as

Terms
Aircrew—The total complement of rated (pilots, navigators, combat systems officers, air battle
managers, and flight surgeons), career enlisted aviators (1AXXX and 1UXXX Air Force
Specialty Codes), and nonrated aircrew (K-, Q-, or X-prefixed Air Force Specialty Code)
personnel responsible for the safe ground and flight operation of the aircraft and onboard
systems, or for airborne duties essential to accomplishment of the aircraft’s mission. Includes
members in initial formal training for immediate assignment to an authorized operational flying
position. Individuals must be on aeronautical orders and assigned to an authorized position
according to AFI 65-503, US Air Force Cost and Planning Factors, or nonrated aircrew not in an
aircraft’s basic crew complement, but required for the mission. Aircrew members perform their
 30                                              AFI11-202V1_AETCSUP_I 2 JANUARY 2013


principal duties inflight and their presence is required for the aircraft to accomplish its primary
tasked mission. Duties must be essential to operating the aircraft or mission systems and
equipment used for completing a mission, or other duties essential to the aircraft’s mission.
NOTES:—1. US Air Force Academy (USAFA)/Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps
(AFROTC) cadets enrolled in approved USAFA flying programs are accorded aircrew status
while actively participating in such programs. Cadets will be placed on aeronautical orders
authorizing flying status while participating in approved USAFA flying programs and will not be
added in the operational ARMS database. HARM office personnel will not assign an Aviation
Service Code (ASC) and an Aviation Service Date (ASD) will not be established. Neither flying
incentive pay nor flying duty credit are authorized.
IAW AFI 11—401, cadets who fly as part of their scheduled OPS AF training are authorized to
participate in flying duties as observers, in a special training status. These training sorties are not
orientation sorties, which are authorized for USAFA and AFROTC cadets not on aeronautical
orders. Observer sorties may be conducted IAW all regularly-scheduled sorties and are not
restricted to the local flying area. They may be flown in conjunction with student training and IP
continuation training sorties, as well as IAW direct support flights, but may not be flown on
functional check flight (FCF) or operational check flight (OCF) sorties.
The purpose of cadet training sorties is to introduce cadets to USAF flying operations and
motivate cadets to consider a career as a rated aircrew member. As such, all normally—
permitted training events, to include touch and go landings, aerobatics, air combat maneuvering,
air refueling, and low level training, are authorized. An IP must be at the controls during all
critical phases of flight on cadet training sorties.
2. The term ―navigator‖ includes all navigator specialties and is synonymous with the
designation Combat Systems Officer (CSO). New UFT graduates are designated CSOs, but
previously qualified individuals will continue to be identified as navigators.
Basic Aircraft Qualification—An aircrew member who has satisfactorily completed training
prescribed to maintain the skills necessary to perform aircrew duties in the unit aircraft.
Basic Mission Capable—An aircrew member who has satisfactorily completed mission
qualification training, is qualified in some aspect of the unit mission, but does not maintain
MR/CMR status.
Combat Mission Ready—An aircrew member who has satisfactorily completed mission
qualification training and maintains qualification and proficiency in the command or unit combat
mission.
Continuation Training—The continuation training program provides crew members with the
volume, frequency, and mix of training necessary to maintain proficiency in the assigned
qualification level.
Conversion Training—Training conducted in association with a unit converting to a different
MDS.
Currency—A measure of how frequently and/or recently a task is completed. Currency
requirements should ensure the average aircrew member maintains a minimum level of
proficiency in a given event.
AFI11-202V1_AETCSUP_I 2 JANUARY 2013                                                              31


Difference Training—Training provided to qualify members in a different series aircraft in the
same MDS.
Flying Training CONOPS—The process that ties validated training requirements to the Air
Force Programming, Planning, and Budgeting System.
Formal Course—A course of instruction listed in the Air Force Education and Training Course
Announcement (ETCA).
Initial Qualification Training—Training needed to qualify aircrew for basic aircrew duties in
an assigned crew position for a specific aircraft, without regard for the unit’s operational
mission.
Mission Ready—An aircrew member who has satisfactorily completed mission qualification
training and maintains qualification and proficiency in the command or unit operational mission.
Mission Qualification Training—Training needed to qualify aircrew in an assigned crew
position for a specific aircraft to perform the command or unit mission.
Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR)—Any headquarters, agency, or activity having the
primary functional interest in, and responsibility for, a specific action, project, plan, program, or
problem.
Proficiency—A measure of how well a task is completed. An aircrew member is considered
proficient when they can perform tasks at the minimum acceptable levels of speed, accuracy, and
safety.
Special Mission Training—Training in any special skills necessary to carry out the unit’s
assigned missions that are not required by every crew member. Specialized training is normally
accomplished after the crew member is assigned MR/CMR or BMC status, and is normally in
addition to MR/CMR or BMC requirements. May be an additional certification or qualification
event as determined by AFI 11-2MDS Vol 1 or 2.
Training Command—The MAJCOM assigned responsibility for formal school training in each
MDS.
Transition Course—A formal course that qualifies an aircrew member in a similar type aircraft.

Note: Duplicate double letters (AA through ZZ) identify Air Force specified training events. HQ USAF/A3O-ATF
establishes and authorizes the use of Air Force duplicate double letter codes. Other letter and/or number
combinations (such as AB) are authorized for events identified in other publications. Locally developed training
task IDs will begin with the letter X. The HARM office or training profile manager will ensure the OG/CC
approves locally developed task IDs.

                CREWMEMBER-PER-MONTH (SCM) REPORT

A3.1. Units and/or MAJCOMs will capture HCM and SCM data on aircrew assigned to API-1,
API-2, API-6, API-8, and API-9 positions. MAJCOMs will consolidate unit-level HCM and
SCM data by weapon system and API category. All reports will be defined by Fiscal
Year/Quarter and will be submitted in the following format (pilot example provided; use same
columns for API-2 and API-9 positions):

   A3.1.1. Aircrew Reporting:
       A3.1.1.1. Pilots: Average number of N-coded pilots assigned to the designated API
       during the quarter, broken out by Experienced and Inexperienced levels, IAW AFI 11-
       2MDS Vol 1. Do not include other coded pilots, such as retired, separated, PCS, TDY,
       inbound and new record. Only include pilots assigned and N-coded during the entire
       quarter. Report API-1 pilots only to HQ USAF/A3O-AT; retain data on other API pilot
       positions at MAJCOM, to be reported as requested by HQ USAF/A3O-AT.
       A3.1.1.2. CSO/Navigator: Average number of N-coded CSOs/Navigators and related
       specialties (EWO/WSO) assigned to the designated API during the quarter. Report API-
       2 data.
       A3.1.1.3. Air Battle Managers. Average number of ABMs assigned to the designated
       API during the quarter. Report API-9 data.
   A3.1.2. Hours per Quarter: Total number of hours flown (to include Primary, Secondary,
   Instructor, Evaluator, and Other time) during the quarter for the designated API (N-coded
   only).
   A3.1.3. HCM: Average numbers of hours flown per position per month. For the F-15C
   example above, 3000 hours flown divided by 50 pilots divided by the 3 months in the quarter
   equals 20 hours per crewmember per month.
   A3.1.4. Sorties per Quarter: Total number of sorties flown during the quarter for the
   designated API (N-coded only).

  A3.1.5. SCM: Average number of sorties flown per position per month. For the KC-135
  example above, 850 sorties flown divided by 50 pilots divided by the three months in the
  quarter equals 5.7 sorties per crewmember per month.
  A3.1.6. Reports will include explanatory remarks when actual HCM differs from
  programmed HCM (by MDS and API) by 10 percent or more.
  A3.1.7. Reports are required from the following commands: ACC, AFGSC, AFRC, AFSOC,
  AMC, NGB, PACAF, USAFE. Reporting requirements may be revised as directed by HQ
  USAF.
