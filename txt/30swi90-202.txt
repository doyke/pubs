This publication defines the roles and responsibilities for life cycle management of reimbursable
programs at the 30th Space Wing (30 SW) in support of the AFSPC Space Support mission in
accordance with (IAW) AFPD 10-12, Space and DODI 3100.12, Space Support; DODD
3200.11, Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB); DODD 3230.3, DOD Support for
Commercial Space Launch Activities; and Interservice and Intragovernmental support IAW
DODI 4000.19, Interservice and Intragovernmental Support. As financial and technical
resources become increasingly scarce, it is imperative the 30 SW develop and implement
processes to insure services provided to programs are reimbursed and programs are managed at
peak efficiency. It is the intent of this instruction to create a wing-wide strategic process
whereby all wing agencies will work in a collaborative environment, with free flow of
information to be shared without restrictions across all wing agencies. All agencies supporting
reimbursable programs will work together to identify and resolve funding discrepancies and
opportunities, user support issues, and opportunities for process improvements. This instruction
applies to all 30 SW units, organizations, agencies, contractor personnel, and offices whose
duties directly relate to the management, preparation, and conduct of reimbursable programs
operating at the 30 SW under the authorities listed above. Waivers from this instruction will be
requested through the 30 SW Chief of Plans and Programs (30 SW/XP). Waivers will be
coordinated with all applicable base agencies and submitted for approval/disapproval to the
30 SW Commander (30 SW/CC). Public Law 104-13, Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, affect

1. Introduction.
    1.1. 30 SW provides operational, testing, and host base support to a wide variety of
    programs in performance of its Space Support mission, in its role as an MRTFB for test and
    evaluation (T&E) activities, in support of commercial space activities as encouraged by
    statutes, and in support to other DOD activities and non-DOD Federal activities when in the
    best interest of the United States. These programs vary in magnitude from short duration
    tests, experiments, and military exercises, to continuing programs involving developmental
    and operational testing of complex weapons systems or spacelift systems.
    1.2. Wing support to a reimbursable program can be very complex, and typically involves
    considerable efforts from military, civil service, and contractors to prepare and review plans
    and procedures, operate instrumentation, and conduct operations in support of User
    programs.
       1.2.1. For the purposes of this instruction, Government is defined as DOD and non-DOD
       Federal, State, and Local governments (supported IAW the Economy Act, 31 U.S.C.,
       section 1535; or other applicable statute).
       1.2.2. For the purposes of this instruction, “commercial” is defined as:
           1.2.2.1. A commercial space activity licensed (e.g., site operators license or launch
           license) by the Federal Aviation Administration (supported IAW 49 U.S.C., section
           70101- 70120) and party to a AFSPC Commercial Space Operations Support
           Agreement and 30 SW Annex B commercial agreement.
           1.2.2.2. A commercial space activity granted temporary use of AF real property in
           furtherance of the Commercial Space Launch Act, as amended, and IAW 10 U.S.C.
           2667 and AFI 32-9003 and party to a AFSPC Commercial Space Operations Support
           Agreement (CSOSA) and 30 SW Annex B commercial agreement.
           1.2.2.3. A commercial space activity contracted or sponsored by a DOD activity not
           licensed by the FAA (supported IAW 15 U.S.C., section 5801-5807) and party to a
           AFSPC CSOSA and 30 SW Annex B commercial agreement.
           1.2.2.4. A commercial MRTFB T&E activity (supported IAW 10 U.S.C., section
           2681) and party to a 30 SW Commercial support agreement.
    1.3. For the purposes of this instruction, a Reimbursable Program (herein known as
    Program) is defined as any Government or Commercial activity requiring recurring support
    on a cost-reimbursable basis for host base services and/or operational or T&E launch and/or
    range services for the types of activities listed below. The chart in Attachment 2 shows a
    variety of Programs intended to be captured under the purview of this instruction.

      1.5.1. 30 SW contracts or contractors.
      1.5.2. New 30 SW facility constructions (i.e., Military Construction).
      1.5.3. Associated operations conducted in conjunction with a major operation and in
      accordance with 2 ROPS Operating Instruction 10-07, Procedures for Conducting
      Associated/Related Operations on the Western Range.
      1.5.4. Overall beddown/site survey management and tracking of requirements in
      accordance with AFI 10-503, Base Unit Beddown Program.
      1.5.5. On-base unit relocations/movements.
      1.5.6. Aeronautical tests
      1.5.7. Other non-reimbursable activity or activity otherwise not falling within the
      definition of reimbursable Programs.
2. Organization.
   2.1. The overall wing responsibility for strategic level Program Management is assigned to
   the 30 SW Plans and Programs office (30 SW/XP), which serves as the Wing’s “Front Door”
   (liaison) for those reimbursable programs defined in Paragraph 1.3, above.
   2.2. Within 30 SW/XP, a Wing Program Requirements Manager (WPRM) will be assigned
   to each 30 SW program for strategic wing level planning and management. A WPRM may
   have responsibility for more than one program based on the size and complexity of the
   program. In addition, a Program Support Manager (PSM) from 30 OG and a Launch
   Mission Manager (LMM) from 30 LCG will be assigned, as applicable, to 30 SW launch
   programs for tactical level planning, management, and execution.
   2.3. The WPRM will serve the Wing Commander as the focal point for overall strategic
   level 30 SW support by facilitating, coordinating, mediating or integrating 30 SW support as
   required to ensure program success; e.g., resolving non-Range, host base support issues
   across the wing or with Numbered Air Force and AFSPC or other external agencies. The
   WPRM will chair regularly scheduled Wing Program Management Working Groups
   (WPMWG). All wing agencies that support the Program are required to have representatives
   at these interchanges. All interchange attendees are empowered to openly discuss the status
4                                                           30SWI90-202 1 FEBRUARY 2010


    of the Program in relation to their area of responsibility, and answer questions from those
    assembled. If a wing position requires commander signature, staffing of that position will
    follow normal wing staffing process.
    2.4. Program support at the 30 SW will be accomplished in accordance with Headquarters
    Air Force Space Command (HQ AFSPC) Directives, 30 SW Directives, 30 SW Instructions,
    Intra-Inter Service Support Agreements (ISSA), CSOSAs and their subsidiary Annex B,
    Space Operations Support Agreements (SOSAs), and the wing’s support plans as
    documented in the UDS.
    2.5. To better manage reimbursable programs, recurring personnel transfers were established
    between 30 LCG and 30 SW/XP. As military personnel PCS from XP, 30 LCG will
    typically transfer replacements with acquisition experience to 30 SW/XP via Permanent
    Change of Assignment (PCA) at approximate two-year intervals (see para 3.3.6). 30 SW/XP
    will requisition new personnel for those slots vacated by the 30 LCG personnel. Newly
    requisitioned personnel will typically replace 30 LCG PCA’d individuals as agreed to by 30
    LCG/CC and 30 SW/XP.
3. Roles and Responsibilities.
    3.1. Wing Plans and Programs (XP). The XP will:
       3.1.1. At program introduction to the wing, assign a WPRM to be the user’s primary
       point of contact. As the program matures and the WPRMs guide users into working
       relationships with functional areas within the wing, the WPRM role evolves from being
       the focal point for overall 30 SW support to a program liaison for the 30 SW. This
       “cradle to grave” service will ensure initial agreements for program support are routinely
       monitored, reported and readily modified (if required) to ensure adequacy and to meet
       evolving program requirements or changes in 30 SW services. Specific roles of the
       WPRM are defined below:
       3.1.2. New Programs:
           3.1.2.1. Serve as the initial primary point of contact and user interface for all new
           requests for 30 SW support.
           3.1.2.2. In coordination with affected agencies, provide preliminary assessment to 30
           SW leadership of environmental, safety, communications, facility, logistics, security,
           range, treaty, transportation, PA, and civil engineering requirements. This assessment
           will include a consolidated list of impacts to 30 SW mission and the identified
           potential workload and reimbursement implications to assist 30 SW leadership in
           developing recommended way-ahead.”
           3.1.2.3. Act as lead agent for management of Program Introduction and/or Level 1
           Planning documentation as required. This includes providing assistance to wing users
           in the development of appropriate documentation. Task and coordinate with outside
           agencies as required in developing Statement of Support response to be coordinated
           by appropriate wing agencies and eventually signed by 30 SW/CC.
           3.1.2.4. Facilitate 30 SW support to meet program requirements by chairing regularly
           scheduled WPMWGs. The WPRM will determine the frequency of these reviews,
           based upon the maturity of the program and/or the extent of support required.
30SWI90-202 1 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                    5

        coordinated between 30 LCG and 30 SW/XP far enough in advance to plan the
        transfer appropriately.
     3.1.3. Ongoing strategic planning and management:
        3.1.3.1. Serve as the User liaison to 30 SW. An example of this would be the
        WPRMs attending 30 SW Mission Stakeholder’s Board (MSB) meetings with

      predicted expenditures), critical milestones, range schedule, user watch items, and wing
      watch items. The WPRM with other program WPRMs will attempt to detect common
      issues among the various programs or within the wing and elevate or take action to
      correct, as appropriate.
      4.1.3. Program Status. The WPRM, in coordination with WPRMWG members, will
      support the reporting of reimbursable JON status to include preparation and review of
      JON reports and briefing charts, participation in various financial planning and review
      meetings, etc.
      4.1.4. Action Items.
         4.1.4.1. Action item delegation and timelines will be agreed to by all affected
         WPRMWG members. WPRMWG members have the authority to accept timelines
         where the level of effort is inherent in their area of expertise. If the level of effort
         extends to other disciplines within their organization, the WPRMWG member may be
         required to work an acceptable due date within their chain of command, wing
         schedule permitting. WPRMWG due dates reflect wing need dates, and as such, any
         required internal coordination must meet the wing timeline.
         4.1.4.2. Action item deliverables may be coordinated through the POCs chain of
         command prior to submission to the WPRMWG. However, chain of command
         coordination must occur within the timelines specified at the WPRMWG.
         4.1.4.3. WPRMWGs will endeavor to allow adequate time for internal coordination.

Terms
Launch Program—Any program involved in the preparation, launch or recovery of a launch
vehicle, payload, or the conduct of a launch or recovery. A launch vehicle means 1) a vehicle
built to operate in, or place a payload in outer space and 2) a suborbital rocket.
30SWI90-202 1 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                 13


Launch User—The proponent or sponsor of a Program. The User (a.k.a. customer or launch
agency) is the single responsible entity that requests 30 SW services, funds 30 SW services,
owns the Program requirements and has overall responsibility for Program operations and
management.
Mission Specific Base Support—Applies to support that is linked to an operation or test using
Western Range resources.
Non-Mission Specific Base Support—Applies to day-to-day support of a 30 SW User that is
operating a facility or site at Vandenberg.
Non-Range or Non-Launch Program—A program requiring 30 SW support that does not
intend to conduct a launch or require range instrumentation support.
Program—An effort conducted under the authority and funding of a single clearly defined
agency or User. A program has a singular objective that is described in a Program Introduction.
Two or more Programs may have common objectives (i.e. launch vehicle, payload, associated
operation, etc) and may receive concurrent operations support. Major launch programs typically
require significant amount of range instrumentation support. Range instrumentation support is
heavily reliant on the Universal Documentation System.
Universal Documentation System (UDS)—The Range Commanders Council approved
MRTFB standardized process for documenting User requirements; documenting 30 SW support
plans and operations support configurations; documenting 30 SW support deficiencies; and
scheduling of major, minor or test operations. The UDS consists of three levels of
documentation:
Level 1: Program Introduction (PI) from user and associated Statement of Support (SoS) from
Wing.
Level 2: Program Requirements Document (PRD) from user and associated Program Support
Plan (PSP) from Wing.
Level 3: Operations Requirements (OR) from user and associated Operations Directive (OD)
from Wing.
