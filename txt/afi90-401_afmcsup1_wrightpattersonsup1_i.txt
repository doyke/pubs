SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This is the second publication of AFI 90-401. The initial publication superseded AFR 11-7, 22 December
1983, eliminating the requirement to file reports for congressional committee investigations, hearings, or
visits. This revision establishes the Office of Legislative Liaison, Congressional Action Division, SAF/
LLX, as the OPR to provide support to wing commanders during visits with members of Congress and
their staffs. SAF/LLX will provide support to wing commanders in coordination with the Office of Bud-
get and Appropriations Liaison, SAF/FML, as appropriate. Paragraphs 3.2. and 4.1. are modified, and
paragraph 4.9. is added. Additionally, paragraph 1.4. is consolidated into paragraph 1.2., and existing
paragraphs 1.5. through 1.8 are redesignated as paragraphs 1.4. through 1.7.
(AFMC) This supplement revises the supplement dated 1 March 1996. It clarifies the fact that the Office
of Congressional Activities is AFMC/XPPL. It emphasizes the fact that all AFMC HQ organizations and
field units must comply with AFI 90-401.

1. Releasing Information:
   1.1. Congressional Inquiries. Air Force policy is to cooperate fully with the Congress, and to give
   full and timely responses to congressional inquiries.
   1.2. Classified Information. Air Force personnel must properly safeguard information classified in
   the interests of national defense (according to DoD 5200.1-R, Information Security Program Regula-
   tion, June 1986, with Change 1 and AFI 31-401, Information Security Program Management [for-
   merly AFRs 205-1 and 205-43]). We may disclose classified information to the Congress only with
   the consent of the Secretary of the Air Force IAW the aforementioned regulations. The Secretary has
   designated the Office of Security Review (SAF/PAS) as the approval authority for release of classified
   information to the Congress. Refer congressional requests for classified information to SAF/PAS
   through SAF/LL or SAF/FML. Also, Air Force officials must not disclose classified information to
   the Congress for release to a congressional constituent. The only exception is declassified and releas-
   able information the constituent could receive under AFI 37-131 (converting to AF Supplement to
   DoD 5400.7-R).
   1.3. "For Official Use Only" Information. According to AFI 37-131, Air Force Freedom of Infor-
   mation Act Program (converting to AF Supplement to DoD 5400.7-R), Air Force officials may gener-
   ally not disclose For Official Use Only (FOUO) information to the public that falls within exemptions
   2 through 9 of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). However, the Air Force may release such
   information to chairpersons or ranking minority members of congressional committees or subcommit-
   tees if the information relates to matters within their jurisdiction. An Air Force official who decides
   the information should not be released to the congressional committee must staff the congressional
   request for information with a recommendation to the Secretary of the Air Force through SAF/LL.
   1.4. Privacy Act Information. Air Force officials must protect personal information about military
   and civilian employees according to the guidelines of the Privacy Act. Without an individual’s written
   consent to release information, Air Force officials may provide only general information according to
   the provisions of AFI 37-132, Air Force Privacy Act Program (converting to AFI 33-332) which sets
   forth the Privacy Act procedures. The Air Force may, however, disclose an individual’s records with-
   out the individual’s consent when requested by a chairperson or ranking minority member of a con-
   gressional committee or subcommittee if the information relates to matters within their jurisdiction.
   When making such a disclosure, the Air Force should tell the committee or subcommittee members
   about any sensitive information and the need to safeguard it.
   1.5. Information from Air Force People. Air Force personnel have the legal right to petition, fur-
   nish information to, or communicate with the Congress (Title 5, United States Code, Section 7102 and
   Title 10, United States Code, Section 1034).
   1.6. Locally Sensitive Information. Information on changes in the status of Air Force units, installa-
   tions, and industrial facilities may have an impact on states and congressional districts. Therefore, Air
   Force officials must not release such information without approval from the Secretary of the Air
   Force. Refer congressional requests for such information to the Office of the Secretary of the Air
   Force through SAF/LL or SAF/FML.
   1.7. Congressional Security Clearances. Senators and Representatives have Top Secret clearances.
   The Air Force allows members on special committees to see all documents relevant to the committee.
   To verify the security clearance of congressional staff members, contact the Office of the Secretary of
   Defense, Legislative Affairs Security Office (OSD/LA).

       4.2.2. When you plan to invite Members, staff or employees of Congress, the Executive Office of
       the President, or the Office of the Vice President, send SAF/LL the signed invitation and a cover
       letter explaining the details of the event 60 days in advance. If 60 days notice is not possible, call
       the Air Force House or Senate Liaison Office to determine the best way to extend the invitation to
       Members of Congress, and call the Air Force Congressional Inquiry Division for the best way to
       extend the invitation to the Executive Office of the President or the Office of the Vice President.
       These offices can also advise on the proper forms of address. Make no public announcement until
       SAF/LL or SAF/FML confirms that the guests will attend. Do not mention transportation of mem-
       bers, employees, or spouses in the invitation.
       4.2.3. Coordinate with SAF/LL or SAF/FML when Members of Congress or staff plan to visit
       your Air Force activity.
       4.2.4. Do not commit the Air Force to providing transportation until SAF/LL notifies you that
       transportation is approved.
    4.3. Congressional Inquiries to Local Commanders:
       4.3.1. Air Force policy is to respond promptly and factually to direct requests for information

AFI90-401_AFMCSUP1_WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBSUP1_I 13 JANUARY 2006                                              7


     4.4.1. Because of their sensitive nature, process all inquiries about cases dealing with Status of
     Forces Agreements, individual privileges or rights while stationed outside the continental United
     States, legal or policy problems, or issues that may become sensitive or controversial as follows:
     4.4.2. Within 24 hours of receipt of a congressional inquiry, send an acknowledgment that SAF/
     LL will send a final reply. Do not speculate on decisions or dates.

     with copies of needed back-up information or correspondence.
     4.4.4. Inform SAF/LL of any changes in intensity or scope of the case.
  4.5. Congressional Field Hearings and Investigations:
     4.5.1. SAF/LL or SAF/FML is the commander’s liaison with the Secretary of the Air Force on all
     congressional requests for inspection, investigation, and summary reports that require the Secre-
     tary’s attention.
     4.5.2. Members of Congress and their personal and committee staff are entitled to courtesy and
     respect. Proper identification admits them to any base, field installation, or facility and allows
     them to use private working space and facilities at a central location. Commanders must ensure
     that all personnel fully cooperate with committees during hearings and investigations. Allow
     access to controlled areas in accordance with DoD 5200-1.R and AFI 31-401.
     4.5.3. When a committee wants to examine official documents, files, or records within its area of
     interest or pertinent to its investigation, provide the material in a room set aside for the committee
     unless release of these materials is not allowed under paragraph 1.1. Assign an Air Force repre-
     sentative to assist if needed.
     4.5.4. Refer any requests from a congressional committee to copy, remove, or retain official files,
     documents, or records (or copies of these documents) to SAF/LL or SAF/FML. SAF/LL or SAF/
     FML, as appropriate, will coordinate requests to remove files with the Air Force Records Officer
     (AFCIC/ITC).
     4.5.5. Coordinate with Office of the General Counsel (SAF/GC) concerning release of documents
     related to congressional investigations when there are legal issues involved such as the Privacy
     Act and claims of privilege.
     4.5.6. If a committee notes any deficiencies in Air Force operations or procedures during its field
     investigation and if the Air Force can take immediate corrective action, do so and advise the com-
     mittee and either SAF/LL or SAF/FML.
  4.6. Congressional Itinerary Changes:
     4.6.1. A commander or escort officer who learns of a change in congressional itinerary must coor-
     dinate with facilities scheduled for later visits to avoid unannounced arrivals.
     4.6.2. The escort officer coordinates each schedule change with SAF/LL or SAF/FML and with
     all affected activities. All Air Force personnel must give the officer full cooperation.
     4.6.3. For unescorted trips, the host commander notifies SAF/LL or SAF/FML of itinerary
     changes and any new or changed requests. Coordinate directly with facilities scheduled later in
     the itinerary regarding briefings, transportation, quarters, or other support.
  4.7. Photography During Congressional Visits:
8              AFI90-401_AFMCSUP1_WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBSUP1_I 13 JANUARY 2006


       4.7.1. When the Air Force takes photographs during a congressional visit, the host field organiza-
       tion must send copies of black and white, 5 by 7-inch glossy prints, with captions, to SAF/LL or
       SAF/FML within 72 hours after they are developed. For color photographs, send a first-generation
       transparency.
       4.7.2. Original negatives of congressional visits are nonrecord photography. Destroy them with
       the permission of the local commander. The Air Force may arrange for processing prints of con-
       gressional visits through Air Force-sponsored, government-owned, or commercially operated
       plants.
    4.8. Congressional Committee Investigation or Visit:
       4.8.1. If SAF/LL or SAF/FML personnel do not escort members of the Congress or their staffs,
       field commanders should inform SAF/LL or SAF/FML about the outcome of the visit or investi-
       gation. Field commanders should also provide information to other interested echelons at their dis-
       cretion.
