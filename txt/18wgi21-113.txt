1. General.
    1.1. Authorization for Local Manufacture:
       1.1.1. LM requests are automatically approved if Source Maintenance and
       Recoverability (SMR) codes identify them as LM and the fabricating activity has the
       capability to fabricate requested item. The weapons system illustrated parts breakdown
       technical order provides the SMR code for all parts. Technical Order 00-25-195, AF
       Technical Order System Source, Maintenance, and Recoverability Coding or Air Force
       Weapons, Systems and Equipments, is the authority on SMR codes. Additionally,
       hydraulic lines which are not stock listed must follow the LM process. This does not
       apply to items coded assembled at field level. Procedures are outlined in paragraph 2.
       below.
       1.1.2. Procurable Hydraulic Tube Assemblies: Manufacture of procurable lines (not
       having a Supply Routing Identification Code of JBD, which is a supply code meaning
       local manufacture) is restricted to those items which are mission essential and are
       approved by the depot item manager. Tube assemblies with SMR codes PA, PB, PE, PG,
       MD, XA and XB are procurable items, depot manufactured, salvage, etc. and will be
       ordered, not locally manufactured. 18th Equipment Maintenance Squadron Production
       Superintendent (18 EMS/MXM Pro Super) will determine when aircraft tubing
       assemblies are deemed mission essential. For procedures, see paragraph 3..
       1.1.3. Procurable Assets (Non-Tubing): Manufacture of procurable assets (not having a
       Supply Routing Identification Code of JBD, which is a supply code meaning local
       manufacture) is restricted to those items which are mission essential and approved by the
       depot item manager. Assets with SMR codes PA, PB, PE, PG, MD, XA and XB are
       procurable items, depot manufactured, salvage, etc. and will be ordered, not locally
       manufactured. 18th Maintenance Group Commander (18 MXG/CC) is the approving
       authority for the local manufacture of all non-tubing procurable assets and will determine
       when they are deemed mission essential. For procedures, see paragraph 4.
       1.1.4. Prior to submitting a request for LM, the requesting activity must determine if
       item is essential for mission accomplishment, i.e., satisfy mission capable condition
       priority 02 (MICAP) or if the item adversely affects mission capabilities, i.e., priority 03
       through 05 (Non-MICAP). Flying Squadron Production Superintendent must notify 18
       EMS Pro Super of all MICAP LM requests.
    1.2. Materials Management:
       1.2.1. 18 EMS Fabrication Flight’s Aircraft Structural Maintenance Section maintains
       some material on bench stock for LM of lines and other items coded as LM.
       1.2.2. In the event the required material is not available in bench stock, requesting
       Flying/Fighter Squadron’s COSO will order all required material against the aircraft
       requiring local manufactured part(s).
2. Non-Stock Listed Lines (NSL) and Stock Listed Items with Local Manufacture (SL-LM)
SMR Code:
    2.1. These items are considered LM and will be processed LM items. These items are
    identified by, but not restricted to, items with SMR codes MO and MF. In addition, lines
18WGI21-113 1 APRIL 2010                                                                        3


   with an SMR of AF are intended to be procured and assembled at field level but are rarely
   available. Every effort should be made to procure these lines through the supply system. In
   the event they are not available, AF lines may be processed as LM.
   2.2. Procedures for NSL and SL-LM lines are covered in paragraph 3.2.
3. Procedures:
   3.1. For Tube Assemblies Code as Procurable:
      3.1.1. Requesters will order the item through base supply.
      3.1.2. Once a demand (valid document number is considered proof of demand) has been
      established with base supply, COSO will verify status via the Enterprise Solution-Supply
      (ES-S). In the event status is not available or the Estimated Delivery Date (EDD) is
      unacceptable, COSO technicians will contact the applicable depot and/or item manager to
      inquire status. If the item manager or depot communicates the asset should be local
      manufactured, COSO will follow the procedures in paragraph 3.3. For SL-LM tube
      assemblies, the asset will be loaded and ordered, ― or Kill.‖ If zero balance, follow
                                                         Fill
      procedures listed in paragraph 3.2.
   3.2. For Tube Assemblies coded as NSL or SL-LM (zero balance):
      3.2.1. Requester will hand carry completed AF Form 2005, Issue Turn-In Request,
      completed AFTO Form 350, Repairable Item Processing Tag, Integrated Maintenance
      Data System (IMDS)/GO81 documentation (to include printed IMDS screen #122 or
      equivalent GO81 work center event verification), 18WG Form 61, Local Manufacture
      Worksheet, and a sample part to the fabricating activity. When the fabricating activity
      signs the LM worksheet, the requester will take the required paperwork to the Flight
      Service Center (FSC) for processing (during FSC duty hours) and to Supply Customer
      Service for a master national stock number (NSN). During FSC/Customer Service non-
      duty hours, the requesting activity will retain the LM paperwork until FSC duty hours, at
      which time it will be processed. The requester still retains responsibility for ensuring all
      data is accurate and correcting discrepancies.
      3.2.2. Fabricating Activity will:
          3.2.2.1. Fabricating element 7-level will verify ability to manufacture tube assembly
          and verify line is non-stock listed, coded LM and has been ordered (item must be
          loaded, ordered and be zero balance locally) or is SMR-coded LM. If AFTO 350 tag
          indicates MICAP, verify MICAP condition with 18 EMS Pro Super.
          3.2.2.2. Verify availability of all needed material. If material is not on hand,
          fabricating element will annotate on 18WG Form 61 to ensure Flying Squadron
          Supply Section (FSSS) or COSO orders required material. Fabricating activity will
          sign 18WG Form 61 once all annotations are complete.
          3.2.2.3. Process request once processed by FSC (except during FSC non-duty hours)
          in accordance with priority assigned. Establish an estimated completion time/date
          with requester and 18 EMS Pro Super (Note: The priority assigned by the requester
          does not necessarily set the priority for the fabricating activity). During FSC non-
          duty          hours           the           fabricating           activity       and
          18 EMS Pro Super will determine if maintenance will be started prior to completed
4                                                                  18WGI21-113 1 APRIL 2010


           FSC processing. Fabricating activity will ensure completed paperwork by all
           agencies up to FSC approval is accomplished prior to part release. Once FSC re-
           opens the requester will complete the routing of the paperwork and return it to the
           fabricating activity.
           3.2.2.4. Notify 18 EMS Pro Super and requester when item is ready for pick-up.
           Release item to the requester and ensure individual receiving property signs
           fabricating logbook. Hold the AF Form 2005 and /or AF Form 1386, Advice of
           Transactions Paid for Others, for the FSC LM monitor to reconcile and provide FSC
           LM monitor with approximate cost of LM, excluding man-hours.
           3.2.2.5. FSC LM Monitor will ensure total reconciliation with applicable fabricating
           activities.
    3.3. For procurable tubing assets that do not have a favorable EDD and are deemed LM by
    item manager, or depot, COSO must take the following actions:
       3.3.1. Follow procedures outlined in paragraph 3.2.2.
       3.3.2. Identify and coordinate LM request to 18 EMS/MXM for approval and 18 WG
       Form 61 endorsement.
       3.3.3. COSO must maintain due out in the supply system until the part is received from
       supply. Once received, the asset will be returned to stock locally for future use.
4. All Other Local Manufacture Items (Non-Tubing):
    4.1. Requester will:
       4.1.1. Complete procedures in paragraph 3.2.2.         Obtain fabricating activity 7-level
       signature on the 18WG Form 61.
       4.1.2. Obtain approval from the 18th Maintenance Group Commander (or designated
       representative) and the depot item manager for LM of all procurable assets.
       4.1.3. Obtain a due-out document number and complete AF Form 2005. Ensure Job
       Control Number (JCN), if applicable, is annotated in columns 45 through 50 of the AF
       Form 2005. Additionally, for non-stock listed items, complete DD Form 1348-6, DoD
       Single Line Item Requisition System Document (Manual - Long Form).
       4.1.4. Hand carry sample, technical drawings/blueprints, AF Form 2005, DD Form 1348-
       6 (if required), 18WG Form 61 and IMDS/GO81 documentation (printed IMDS screen
       #122 or equivalent GO81 work center event verification) to the FSC LM Monitor.
    4.2. FSC LM Monitor will:
       4.2.1. Load due-out document numbers for the LM request. Coordinate status and
       estimated completion date with fabricating activity. FSC will use FSC specific serial #’s
       4650 – 4699 for LM requests.
       4.2.2. Use local list to monitor supply status of all outstanding supply requisitions.
           4.2.2.1. Process all issue requests for material required to manufacture end item.
           Upon receipt of materials, forward the requirement and materials to the fabricating
           activity.

          4.2.2.2. Reconcile all outstanding requisitions’ status with appropriate fabricating
          activity on an as-needed basis. Update status, as required, and perform follow up
          actions when necessary.
   4.3. Fabricating Activity will:
       4.3.1. Process requests in accordance with priority assigned. Note: The requester’s
       assigned priority is not necessarily the priority for the fabricating activity.
       4.3.2. Provide total cost to FSC when LM is complete, excluding man-hours.
