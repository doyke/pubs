flict of interest or the appearance of such conflict during their administration of the motor vehicle traffic
supervision program. Installation commanders must coordinate their letters of delegation through their
installation staff judge advocate

                                      DRIVING PRIVILEGES

2.1. Requirements for Driving Privileges.
   2.1.1. Driving a government owned vehicle (GOV) or POV on an Air Force installation is a privilege
   granted by the installation commander. If you accept that privilege, you must comply with the laws
   and instructions governing motor vehicle operation and registration on the installation. Consequently,
   everyone operating a motor vehicle on a military installation must produce, upon request from the
   security police, the following:
      2.1.1.1. Proof of vehicle ownership or registration if required by the issuing authority.
      2.1.1.2. A valid state, overseas command, host nation, or international driver’s license and/or AF
      Form 2293, US Air Force Motor Vehicle Operator’s Identification Card, supported by a DD
      Form 2, US Armed Forces Identification Card. Locally determine acceptable identification
      media for civilian personnel and base contractors. Note: Each installation commander must deter-
      mine if international drivers licenses are recognized and accepted by the local (civilian) jurisdic-
      tion, and if so, will their use be authorized on the installation. As a general rule, most CONUS
      civilian jurisdictions will honor use of international drivers licenses for short periods of time by
      non-resident visitors and assigned military personnel. When practical, installation commanders
      should assimilate local policy to preclude conflicting policy.
      2.1.1.3. If required by the jurisdiction in which the vehicle is operated, a valid record of motor
      vehicle safety inspection, emission control test, or any other test, evaluation, safety inspection, or
      other documents required by local, state, or host nation law or agreement. Note: In some
      instances, a state or other governing jurisdiction in which a vehicle is registered may require, as a
      condition for keeping registration/plates issued by that state or jurisdiction, a safety or other
      inspection even when the vehicle is operated in another state or jurisdiction. Though not enforce-
      able (in another state), failure to comply may invalidate the vehicle registration leaving the owner/
      operator in a precarious legal position. In such cases, it becomes the owner's responsibility to
      comply with their "home state" or other issuing jurisdiction requirements in addition to host state
      requirements. Owners should secure host registration when unable to comply with licensing and/
      or registration requirements issued by their home state or other jurisdiction.
      2.1.1.4. Proof of current vehicle insurance when required by state, host nation, or the installation
      commander.
          2.1.1.4.1. (Added-90SW) Personnel who are cited for operating a vehicle on FEW for no
          insurance, no registration or failure to produce documents that prove otherwise, are subject to
          having their base driving privileges revoked for 60 days maximum. Personnel who are cited
          for no registration and the registration is expired 30 days or less have two duty days (Monday
          – Friday) to properly register the vehicle and provide proof to 90 SFS/SFAR. If proof cannot
          be made their base driving privileges will be suspended for 14 days. If the registration is
          expired for 31 days but not more than 59 days, their base driving privileges will be suspended
          for 30 days. If the registration is expired 60 days or more, their base driving privileges will be
          suspended for 60 days. They still must properly register the vehicle in order to enter or park on
          any part of FEW. The 90th Security Forces Squadron, Security Forces Reports and Analysis

           Section will initiate and issue suspension letters for failure to have proper registration or insur-
           ance.

2.2. Stopping and Inspecting Personnel or Vehicles.
    2.2.1. The security police may stop vehicles on military installations based on the installation com-
    mander's authority. The following principles govern the stopping of motor vehicles:
       2.2.1.1. In overseas areas, security police may stop, search, and detain vehicles on or off base as
       determined by host nation agreements and local command policy.
       2.2.1.2. AFI 31-209, The Air Force Resource Protection Program, local command instructions,
       and policies established by the installation commander will detail stop, inspection, search, and
       impoundment of motor vehicles at CONUS installation entry gates and in Air Force restricted
       areas.
           2.2.1.2.1. (Added-90SW) AFI 31-209 has been superseded by AFI 31-101. Personnel will
           abide by and submit to Random Vehicle Inspections. Failure to comply may warrant punitive
           and/or administrative action.
       2.2.1.3. On-base traffic stops and inspections (other than at entry gates and restricted areas) of
       POVs is authorized when there is a reasonable basis to believe it’s necessary to enforce a traffic
       regulation or when there is suspicion of criminal activity.
    2.2.2. MAJCOMs responsible for overseas military installations must provide their installation com-
    manders with written guidelines governing stop, inspection, search, and impoundment of vehicles.
    This guidance must reflect host nation agreements and pass appropriate legal review. Note: A theater
    commander or those commanding unified forces may direct policy covering all installations under
    their command. In this case, MAJCOMs must review those policies before issuing their guidance.

2.3. Implied Consent to Blood, Breath, or Urine Tests. Drivers give consent to evidential tests for
alcohol or other drug content of their blood, breath, and/or urine as a condition to accepting installation
driving privileges. This consent applies when lawfully detained, apprehended, or cited for any impaired
driving offense committed while driving or in physical control of a motor vehicle on an Air Force instal-
lation.
2.3. (90SW) Implied Consent to Blood, Breath, or Urine Tests. All drivers who accept installation
driving privileges automatically give Implied Consent to blood, breath or urine tests. This consent applies
when lawfully detained, apprehended, or cited for any impaired driving offense committed while driving,
or in physical control of, a motor vehicle on the installation.

2.4. Implied Consent to Vehicle Impoundment. As a condition to accepting installation driving privi-
leges, drivers must give their consent for the removal and temporary impoundment of their POV if their
POV is: 1) Illegally parked for unreasonable periods; 2) Interferes with traffic operations; 3) Creates a
safety hazard; 4) Disabled by accident or incident; 5) Left unattended in, or adjacent to, a restricted, con-
trolled, or off-limits area; and 6) Abandoned. Drivers also agree to reimburse an authorized agency or
contractor for the cost of towing, storage, and disposal should a need arise to remove or impound their
motor vehicle because of a situation described above.
    2.4.1. Installation commanders define in local procedures or supplement to this instruction, the defi-
    nitions for "unreasonable periods," "abandoned," and other terms relevant to enforcement action
AFI31-204_90SWSUP1_I 20 FEBRUARY 2004                                                                    9


   under paragraph 2.4. Incorporate those instructions, procedures, and definitions into the local instal-
   lation traffic code and make them known to the general public.
       2.4.1.1. (Added-90SW) Vehicles illegally parked for a period exceeding 24 hours are deemed ille-
       gally parked for an unreasonable period and are subject to impoundment. Abandoned vehicles are
       subject to towing and impoundment at the expense of the owner. A vehicle is considered aban-
       doned when:
           2.4.1.1.1. (Added-90SW) The vehicle is not displaying current registration, a valid DD Form
           2220, or a valid AF Form 75.
           2.4.1.1.2. (Added-90SW) The vehicle has been sited by law enforcement personnel via DD
           Form 2504 and attempts to contact the registered owner have failed or 30 days have elapsed
           since the vehicle was sited.
           2.4.1.1.3. (Added-90SW) The vehicle is parked in an approved slot, but the owner cannot be
           contacted to recover the vehicle at the request of security forces. The provisions of paragraph
           2.4.1.1.2. (Added) will apply in such cases.
           2.4.1.1.4. (Added-90SW) The vehicle is impeding traffic or creating a safety hazard, or when
           requested by security forces.
           Exception: (Added-90SW) Missile field personnel who must remain in the missile field for 72
           hours or more, whose PMV has broken down on base en route to their dispatch point must
           notify the Law Enforcement Desk (LED) of the vehicle location and the date they will return
           from the missile field to preclude vehicle towing unless one of the provisions of paragraph
           2.4.1.1.1. (Added) to 2.4.1.1.4. (Added) applies.
       2.4.1.2. (Added-90SW) Personnel deployed may park their privately owned vehicles at their
       respective work-centers; however, they must have made prior coordination with the unit's com-
       mander's support staff to preclude vehicle impoundment.
       2.4.1.3. (Added-90SW) Recreational vehicles will not be left or parked within the housing area
       over 48 hours.

2.5. Suspension or Revocation of Driving Privileges . Installation commanders may suspend or
revoke installation driving privileges and POV registration for lawful reasons both related and unrelated
to traffic violations or safe vehicle operations. Installation commanders must incorporate procedures gov-
erning suspension and revocation in local publications or supplement to this instruction. Make these
known to the general public.
2.5. (90SW) Suspension or Revocation of Driving Privileges. The Law Enforcement Desk (LED) Ser-
geant maintains unissued Letters of Preliminary Revocation of Driving Privileges while on FEW. These
letters will be completed by Security Forces IAW the instructions that accompany the letters. These letters
will be issued in accordance with 90 SFS instructions.
   2.5.1. Suspensions.
       2.5.1.1. Installation commanders can suspend driving privileges for serious violations or when
       lesser measures fail to improve a driver's performance. The commander may also suspend or
       revoke licenses for up to 12 months if a driver continually violates installation parking standards,
       or habitually violates other standards considered non-moving in nature. Installation commanders
10                                                  AFI31-204_90SWSUP1_I 20 FEBRUARY 2004


     determine suspension and revocation policy for non-moving violations, as well as what constitutes
     a non-moving violation on their installation (i.e., performing unauthorized repair; failure to regis-
     ter; unauthorized modifications or alterations; failure to maintain safety standards, etc.). Make
     these standards part of the local installation traffic code and take reasonable steps to make them
     known to the general public.
     2.5.1.1. (90SW) Three parking violations within a 12-month period will result in suspension of
     driving privileges for 30 days. Each additional violation within this period will result in an addi-
     tional 30-day suspension. Unauthorized parking in a handicapped slot will result in an initial sus-
     pension of driving privileges for 3 days. Subsequent handicapped parking violations will result in
     a 30-day suspension.
     2.5.1.2. The installation commander has discretionary authority and may withdraw anyone's
     authorization to operate a government or privately owned motor vehicle on the installation.
     2.5.1.3. Installation commanders will immediately suspend installation GOV or POV driving
     privileges pending resolution of an intoxicated driving incident which involves active duty mili-
     tary personnel, their family members, retired members of the military service, and DoD civilian
     personnel. This applies regardless of the geographic location of an intoxicated driving incident.
     Installation commanders can only suspend privileges of non-DoD affiliated civilians for incidents
     occurring on the installation or in the areas subject to their military traffic jurisdiction. After a
     review of available evidence as specified in paragraph 2.6., suspend driver’s privileges pending
     resolution of the intoxicated driving incident under the circumstances outlined below:
     2.5.1.3. (90SW) Letters of Preliminary Revocation for Driving While Intoxicated (DWI) are
     maintained and issued by the Security Forces. For each on-base DWI offender, these letters will be
     completed IAW instructions. For each off-base offender, the offender will be contacted by 90 SFS/
     SFAR and directed to report to the 90 SFS/SFAR office to be issued a preliminary revocation let-
     ter. All final letters of revocation for DWI or refusal to submit to a chemical test listed in para-
     graph 4.14.3. of this supplement will be initiated by 90 SFS/SFAR. The removal of all DD Form
     2220, DoD Registered Vehicle Decal, (accountable) will be supervised by the first sergeant, com-
     mander or designated representative and turned into 90 SFS/SFOXI on the next duty day follow-
     ing the incident. Offenders who have family members authorized installation driving privileges
     may have the family member transfer registration into their name. All other offenders will be
     issued a “RESTRICTED” driving decal by 90 SFS/SFOXI and directed in writing to attend the 90
     SW Safety’s Defensive Driving Course V by the first sergeant or commander. Upon approval of
     90 SFS/SFOXI, the vehicle may then be parked in the lot near Gate 2. Civilians who have no mil-
     itary affiliation charged with DWI while on FEW will be issued a Preliminary Notice of Revoca-
     tion of Base Driving Privileges letter. If deemed appropriate by the 90 MSG/CC, the individual
     may be barred from the installation. Furthermore, letters for preliminary revocation will be issued
     for:
        2.5.1.3.1. Refusal to take or complete a lawfully requested chemical test to determine blood
        alcohol content BAC) or breath alcohol content (BrAC) for alcohol or other drugs.
        2.5.1.3.1. (90SW) Operating a motor vehicle with BAC or BrAC of 0.08 percent by volume or
        higher.
        2.5.1.3.2. Operating a motor vehicle with BAC or BrAC of 0.10 percent by volume or higher.
AFI31-204_90SWSUP1_I 20 FEBRUARY 2004                                                                   11


          2.5.1.3.2. (90SW) Operating a motor vehicle with a BAC or BrAC below 0.08 percent blood
          alcohol by volume when an arrest report or other official document reasonably shows an intox-
          icated driving incident occurred.
          2.5.1.3.3. Operating a motor vehicle with a BAC or BrAC below 0.10 percent blood alcohol
          by volume if the jurisdiction in which the vehicle is operated imposes a suspension for a BAC
          or BrAC level below 0.10.
          2.5.1.3.4. On an arrest report or other official document reasonably showing an intoxicated
          driving incident occurred.
   2.5.2. Revocation.
      2.5.2.1. The installation commander will immediately revoke driving privileges for a period of
      not less than one year in the following circumstances:
          2.5.2.1.1. A person is lawfully detained for intoxicated driving and refuses to submit to or
          complete tests to measure blood alcohol or drug content as required by the law of the jurisdic-
          tion, installation traffic code, or this instruction.
          2.5.2.1.2. A conviction, nonjudicial punishment, or a military or civilian administrative action
          resulting in the suspension or revocation of a driver’s license for intoxicated driving. Official
          documentation is required as the basis for this type of revocation action.
          2.5.2.1.3. When a serious incident involving a motor vehicle occurs and the installation com-
          mander determines immediate revocation of driving privileges is required to preserve public
          safety or the good order and discipline of military personnel.
      2.5.2.2. The CSP develops plans and procedures to forward revocation, suspension, and driving
      records to gaining commanders and to initiate appropriate staff action when receiving similar
      records from losing commanders of inbound personnel.
      2.5.2.3. When temporary suspensions are followed by revocations, compute the revocation period
      from the original suspension date, exclusive of any period during which full driving privileges
      were restored pending resolution of charges.
      2.5.2.4. Installation commanders may impose multiple suspensions to run consecutively or con-
      currently.

2.6. Reciprocal Procedures.
   2.6.1. Air Force installation commanders will honor revocations issued by other installation com-
   manders regardless of service component affiliation. Revocations remain in effect during reassign-
   ment unless the issuing authority terminates the revocation before reassignment. Installation
   commander may honor suspensions as determined on a case by case basis. Anyone with suspended or
   revocated privileges may petition an installation commander for partial or limited driving privileges.

2.7. Administrative Due Process for Suspensions and Revocations.
   2.7.1. When considering suspending or revoking someone’s driving privileges, notify that person in
   writing and tell them what action you are taking and the reason for it. Coordinate this notice with the
   base legal office.
12                                                      AFI31-204_90SWSUP1_I 20 FEBRUARY 2004


     2.7.2. Except for incidents outlined in para 2.5.1.3. and 2.5.2.1., do not suspend or revoke a person's
     driving privileges until they are notified (or reasonable attempts made) and offered an administrative
     hearing. Installation commanders determine when a suspension or revocation takes effect once mak-
     ing or attempting this written notice. Only in unusual circumstances should you make verbal notifica-
     tions. Unless an application for a hearing is made within the prescribed period, suspension or
     revocation takes place on the prescribed date and time. Installation commanders determine the time
     period for staying a suspension or revocation action after receiving a request for a administrative hear-
     ing. For offenses outlined in para 2.5.1.3. and 2.5.2.1., an installation commander will authorize an
     immediate preliminary suspension based on reliable evidence. Such evidence can include witness
     statements, a military or civilian police report, chemical test results, a refusal to complete chemical
     testing, video tapes, written statements, field sobriety test results, or other evidence.
     2.7.2. (90SW) Letters of revocation or suspension for other traffic violations will be prepared by 90
     SFS/SFAR. The 90 MSG/CC will conduct administrative hearings and release findings and recom-
     mendations. Failure of the offender to submit a request for an administrative hearing within 10 days
     from the date of receipt of the revocation or suspension letter will result in a waiver of such hearing.
     Any person whose driving privileges have been revoked or suspended will surrender any military
     driver’s license to their squadron commander. Persons may not use a civilian license to drive GOVs
     off base when on base driving privileges have been suspended or revoked. Any person whose driving
     privileges revoked or suspended will be directed in writing to attend the 90 SW Safety’s Defensive
     Driving Course V by the first sergeant or commander. Driving while under suspension will result in an
     additional year of suspended driving privileges on base.
        2.7.2.1. Installation commanders or their designee must conduct evidence reviews as soon as pos-
        sible, but no later than three duty days following final assembly of evidence.
        2.7.2.1. (90SW) 90 SFS/SFAR will serve the letter by contacting the offender’s first sergeant or
        unit commander. The unit commander or first sergeant will direct the offender to 90 SFS/SFAR to
        sign the letter within 3 duty days (unless TDY or in leave status). If a revocation for implied con-
        sent is combined with another revocation such as DWI, revocations will run consecutively.
        2.7.2.2. For active duty military personnel, send a written notice of preliminary suspension for
        intoxicated driving to their commander or reasonable equivalent. For non-installation, non-DoD
        affiliated civilians, present the written notice of preliminary suspension for intoxicated driving
        either in person (preferred) or by certified mail. If the person is employed on the installation, send
        the notice to their commander or reasonable equivalent.
        2.7.2.3. Advise the individual of the following in the preliminary suspension notification for
        intoxicated driving:
            2.7.2.3.1. Suspension can be made a revocation under the authority of paragraph 2.5.2. of this
            AFI.
            2.7.2.3.2. The right to request restoration of driving privileges pending investigation or reso-
            lution of the incident (direct request letters to the installation commander or designee).
            2.7.2.3.3. The right of military personnel to present evidence and witnesses and be repre-
            sented by a civilian counsel (at their own expense) or assigned military counsel. Commanders
            determine the availability of specific (by name) military counsel requests.

             2.7.2.3.3.1. (Added-90SW) Appeal process for DD Form 1408, Suspensions and Revoca-
             tions. The appealing individual will submit an in-turn letter endorsed by their commander
             to 90 SFS/SFAR, 90 SFG/CC, 90 SW/JA and 90 MSG/CC. This letter will include the
             date, time and location of the violation, as well as the citation number and justification for
             the appeal. 90 SFS/SFAR will coordinate and add appropriate attachments (i.e., statements
             from issuing patrol/witnesses). 90 SFS/SFAR and 90 SFG/CC will coordinate and make
             recommendations to 90 MSG/CC. The 90 MSG/CC will make the final determination and
             forward the original letters to 90 SFS/SFAR. 90 SFS/SFAR will notify the unit of 90 MSG/
             CC decision. The appeal process for DD Form 1805 (civilians) will be IAW the US Mag-
             istrate or District Court procedures.
         2.7.2.3.4. The right of DoD civilian employees to have a personal representative present at the
         administrative hearing in accordance with applicable laws and instructions.
         2.7.2.3.5. Amount of time the individual has to respond and request the administrative hearing
         before the preliminary suspension or revocation becomes permanent.
         2.7.2.3.6. Direction to sign the acknowledgment of receipt and to return the signed letter to
         the address shown in the letter.
         2.7.2.3.7. Requested hearings must take place within a reasonable period which is determined
         by the installation commander. A preliminary suspension for intoxicated driving remains in
         effect until the installation commander makes a final decision. However, if no decision is
         made within 30 days of the preliminary suspension or revocation, restore full driving privi-
         leges until the accused is notified of the final hearing results.
  2.7.3. Hearings for intoxicated driving will cover only the pertinent issues of whether: 1) The law
  enforcement official had reasonable grounds to believe the person was driving or was in physical con-
  trol of a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or other drugs; 2) The person was lawfully
  cited or apprehended for an intoxicated driving offense; 3) The person was asked to submit to a test for
  alcohol or other drug content of blood, breath, or urine and was informed of the consequences for
  refusing to take or complete such a test; 4) The person refused to submit to the test for alcohol, breath,
  or urine; failed to complete the test; submitted to the test and the result exceeded the amount of
  allowed blood alcohol content; results indicate the presence of other drugs for an on-installation
  apprehension or in violation of state laws for an off-installation apprehension; and 5) The testing
  methods used were valid and reliable, and the results accurately recorded and evaluated.
     2.7.3.1. For revocation actions under paragraph 2.5.2.1. for intoxicated driving, the revocation is
     mandatory on conviction or other findings that confirm the charge.
         2.7.3.1.1. The date of conviction or other findings that confirm the charge is the effective date
         of the revocation.
         2.7.3.1.2. You may place the notice that revocation is automatic in the suspension letter, or
         send a separate letter. Revocation is not effective until receipt of the written notice, or the
         showing that you made reasonable attempts to notify the individual.
         2.7.3.1.3. Revocations cancel any partial or restricted driving privileges previously granted.
         Once revocation is acknowledged, a person may petition for the restoration of all or partial
         driving privileges.

2.8. Alcohol and Drug Abuse Programs.
     2.8.1. Refer military personnel involved in any intoxicated (drug or alcohol) motor vehicle incident to
     Substance Abuse Office, Drug and Alcohol Control for evaluation.

2.9. Restoration of Driving Privileges on Acquittal. When an official report or finding determines
lack of guilt (not guilty) or when charges are dismissed or reduced to an offense not amounting to intoxi-
cated driving, vacate the suspension of driving privileges except when:
     2.9.1. The preliminary suspension was based on refusal to take a BAC test.
     2.9.2. Operating a motor vehicle with a BAC of 0.10 percent by volume or higher or in violation of
     the law of the jurisdiction that is bring assimilated on the military installation.
     2.9.3. The person was driving or in physical control of a motor vehicle while under another prelimi-
     nary suspension or revocation.
     2.9.4. The state or host nation authorities made an administrative determination to suspend or revoke
     driving privileges based on local law or pertinent regulations.
     2.9.5. The individual failed to complete a formally directed substance abuse or driver’s training pro-
     gram.

2.10. Restricted Driving Privileges or Probation.
     2.10.1. Unless prohibited by higher authority, host nation authority, or other publication, installation
     commanders may authorize partial or restricted driving privileges to those whose authority to drive on
     military installations was suspended or revocated by a military service authority. Ensure the individ-
     ual’s driving credentials (civilian state, international, host nation, etc.) are still valid.
     2.10.2. Without due cause, do not grant restricted driving privileges, probation, or reinstatement to
     any person whose civilian driver’s license is under suspension or revocation by a state, federal, or host
     nation licensing authority. If absolutely necessary to do so (and for on base privileges only), coordi-
     nate with the installation staff judge advocate. Note: This option applies only to installations exercis-
     ing exclusive military jurisdiction. Outline procedures for applying for partial or restricted privileges
     in the base supplement to this AFI or in another appropriate publication. Only consider requests in
     which there is extreme hardship and there are no other workable alternatives. Do not consider the
     granting of limited privileges as an alternative to administrative discharge action when discharge is
     the more appropriate action. Installation commanders must weigh heavily the potential liability
     inherent when an individual with a suspended or revoked state, host nation, or other license is
     allowed to operate a motor vehicle on the installation. Administrative separation may be appropri-
     ate when the loss of driving privileges renders someone ineffective and incapable of performing their
     military duties, and a change in duty position is not reasonable.

2.11. Extensions of Suspensions and Revocations.
     2.11.1. Increase by two years the suspension or revocation period when someone is discovered driv-
     ing in violation of their original suspension or revocation. The unit or installation commander may
     also take administrative or disciplinary action.
AFI31-204_90SWSUP1_I 20 FEBRUARY 2004                                                                  15


   2.11.2. Extend the suspension or revocation of installation driving privileges until the offender com-
   pletes an approved remedial driver training course, drug or alcohol program, or other program deemed
   necessary by the installation commander or local authorities.

2.12. Reciprocal State-Military Action.
   2.12.1. Statutory authority may exist within some host nations or states for reciprocal suspension and
   revocation of driving privileges. If so, the installation commander should honor the reciprocal agree-
   ments with the state or host nation driver licensing authorities. On receipt of written notice, the
   receiving party may suspend or revoke driving privileges as if the violations or incidents occurred
   within its own jurisdiction.
       2.12.1.1. Use the following procedures if statutory authority does not provide for formal military
       reciprocity:
          2.12.1.1.1. When such authority suspends or revokes a license, automatically terminate the
          individual’s installation GOV and POV driving privileges. Take only comparable military
          administrative actions (suspensions, revocation, or point assessment) for those off-base viola-
          tions reported by local, state, or host nation authorities.
          2.12.1.1.2. In the CONUS, notify the licensing authority of the state where a license is issued
          when revoking a person’s installation driving privileges (for a period of one year or more only)
          following final adjudication of an intoxicated driving offense or for refusal to submit to a
          BAC/BrAC test. Include in the notification the basis for the revocation and the BAC/BrAC
          level.
   2.12.2. Provisions of the applicable status of forces agreement (SOFA) and the law of the host nation
   concerning reciprocal suspension and revocation can affect OCONUS installation commanders.
   When permitted at a particular overseas installation and to the extent an agreement concerning reci-
   procity exists, the installation commander must have prior authorization to negotiate and conclude
   such an international agreement in accordance with applicable directives.

                                                 Chapter 3

                                 MOTOR VEHICLE REGISTRATION

3.1. Registration Policy.
     3.1.1. Register motor vehicles according to guidance in this instruction and policies established by
     the installation commander. Installation commanders may extend registration to anyone they deem
     appropriate. This may include reserve force personnel who maintain close affiliation with the instal-
     lation and other persons who frequently visit the base, such as local dignitaries, community leaders,
     retired civilian employees, civil air patrol members, etc.
        3.1.1.1. Consistent with base entry policy in AFI 31-209, the installation commander is responsi-
        ble for ensuring vehicles entering their installation are controlled. Vehicles entering Air Force
        installations must be registered or meet other entry requirements outlined in paragraph 3.2. Eligi-
        ble vehicle registrants include assigned active duty military and civilian personnel working on
        base, retired military personnel, reserve and national guard personnel assigned to a unit or
        attached for training on an active installation or a reserve or national guard base or facility, and
        survivors of deceased active duty and retired military members who are authorized to use base
        facilities. The installation commander may authorize the registration of vehicles that are in the
        custody of or owned by dependents, step-parents, or guardians of minor children authorized to use
        base facilities. A dependent living away from home may require a letter stating acceptance of
        responsibility from the military sponsor to support an application for vehicle registration. Further-
        more, a person need not own the vehicle to register it; however, they must have a lease agreement,
        power of attorney, or notarized statement from the owner of the vehicle granting them permission
        to use the vehicle and specifying the inclusive use dates.
        3.1.1.2. Treat rental vehicles as government vehicles when being used for official business by
        military or DoD personnel. Check the driver's installation entry credentials and if all is in order,
        the vehicle may proceed in the same manner as a marked government vehicle.
     3.1.2. Vehicles intended for construction and material handling or used solely off the road are not
     usually registered as motor vehicles. Installation commanders determine the need and method for reg-
     istering off road vehicles (ORV) on the installation. However, ORV owners must register and license
     the vehicle prior to its operation on installation roadways.
     3.1.3. When unit vehicle registration (via orderly rooms) is authorized by the installation commander,
     each unit commander can grant limited temporary registration for up to 45 days pending permanent
     registration, or in other circumstances for longer terms.
     3.1.4. Air Force installations and activities honor the DD Form 2220, DOD Registered Vehicle
     Decal, issued by other military or DoD organizations.
     3.1.5. Use of AF Form 75, Visitor/Vehicle Pass. The AF Form 75 is one method to control and iden-
     tify personnel and vehicles on a temporary basis. You can give it to installation visitors who do not
     have the authorized personal or vehicle credentials needed for unescorted or unchecked entry to the
     base. Installation commanders determine the use of AF Forms 75 on their installation and, if used, to
     what degree and to whom issued. If used, develop local policy and procedures governing the issue
     and control of visitor passes. Issue other access credentials when a pass is needed for longer than one
     year.
AFI31-204_90SWSUP1_I 20 FEBRUARY 2004                                                                         17


        3.1.5.1. How to process the AF Form 75:
            3.1.5.1.1. Ask the visitor to fill out the form and sign the consent to search and towing/
            impoundment warning.
            3.1.5.1.2. Use either the driver's license, state vehicle registration, or passport (overseas) or
            other recognized credential according to para 2.1.1.
            3.1.5.1.3. Display the form so one can view it from outside the vehicle.
            3.1.5.1.4. Installation commanders determine if and how to retrieve passes once the visit is
            finished.
    3.1.6. The installation commander determines local policy on authorizing and honoring other vehicle
    registration systems and decals of nonmilitary or non-DoD tenant activities tenanted on the installa-
    tion. Tenant-operated registration systems must meet the requirements of this instruction for:
        3.1.6.1. Complying with registration prerequisites and individual responsibilities in this instruc-
        tion and on the AF Form 533, Certificate of Compliance-Private Motor Vehicle Registration
        (or its equivalent).
        3.1.6.2. Displaying decals on the vehicle.
        3.1.6.3. Storing, issuing, and recovering decals.
    3.1.7. Installation commanders can implement decentralized POV registration among installation
    units. However, the security police must have 24-hour access to registrant information on all registra-
    tion systems used on the installation.

3.2. Registration and Driver Requirements. Registration systems for POVs on Air Force installations
will include the requirements specified below. Overseas commands and overseas installations should
modify these procedures to conform with local and international agreements. All motorcycle operators
must comply with the requirements of AFI 91-207 prior to registering a motorcycle. Individuals must
have the following credentials immediately available upon demand as required by state law or policies
established by the installation commander. 1) A valid state, overseas command, host nation, or interna-
tional driver’s license (as applicable) supported by DD Form 2, or other appropriate identification for
DoD civilians; 2) A certificate of state registration as required by the state or authority in which the vehi-
cle is registered; 3) Proof of meeting the minimum requirements for automobile insurance laws or regu-
lations of the state or host nation. Within the United States, the installation commander may set
reasonable liability insurance requirements for registration and operation of POVs within the confines of
the installation; and 4) Evidence of satisfactory completion of emission, safety, mechanical, or other test
or evaluation required by local, state, or other jurisdiction in which the vehicle is licensed or located.
Installation commanders may require periodic safety inspections for all vehicles operated routinely on
their installation if a like inspection is not required by a nonmilitary jurisdiction. In such cases, the instal-
lation commander must ensure reasonable and accessible inspection facilities are available and that
inspections follow National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) standards. Note: The
owner or authorized operator is responsible for reasonable fees and expenses associated with vehicle
inspections. Failure to comply with safety inspection standards will result in termination or denial of use
of installation roadways.
3.2. (90SW) Registration and Driver Requirements. Requirements for base registration are found in
AFI 31-101, AFI 31-204 and this supplement.
18                                                        AFI31-204_90SWSUP1_I 20 FEBRUARY 2004


     3.2.1. Vehicle registration record keeping. Registering officials must check the eligibility to register
     and ownership (or legitimate custody) of a vehicle. Unit distribution points (i.e., unit orderly rooms)
     may perform registration functions under the supervision of the installation pass and registration sec-
     tion. In this case, these distribution points receive registration decals in bulk from the pass and regis-
     tration section. After issuing decals, provide the pass and registration section the completed AF Form
     533 or the necessary information for entering registration data into the automated system. Use one of
     the following methods to keep records:
     3.2.1. (90SW) Personnel must obtain a memorandum letter from 90 SW/SE, Ground Safety, schedul-
     ing them for the next Motorcycle Safety Foundation (MSF) Course in accordance with AFI 91-207,
     Air Force Traffic Safety Program. Upon receipt of this memorandum, Pass and Registration will issue
     a temporary vehicle pass to those attending the safety class. Permits will only authorize personnel
     temporary access until completion of this course. (A valid driver’s license or Wyoming permit
     endorsed to authorize motorcycle operation is required whether the person’s home state requires a
     motorcycle endorsement or not.) Upon completion of the motorcycle safety course, the person will
     then present the MSF course completion card to Pass and Registration personnel for issuance of
     decals. All motorcycle operators will have a copy of the initial letter or MSF course completion card
     in their possession while operating a motorcycle on FEW at all times.
         3.2.1.1. Manually kept records. Each registrant fills out an AF Form 533 upon initial Air Force
         vehicle registration and upon arrival at a new installation after permanent change of station. The
         registrant’s signature on the AF Form 533 certifies compliance with registration requirements. To
         minimize inconvenience to the registrant, you can preprint the name of the installation and mini-
         mum insurance limits in the appropriate blocks on the front. Determine filing methods locally.
         3.2.1.1. (90SW) Vehicles registered on FEW must meet minimum liability insurance require-
         ments of $25,000 for bodily injury per person, $50,000 for bodily injury for all persons per acci-
         dent, and $20,000 property damage. Vehicles registered in Wyoming must meet the requirements
         of Wyoming State Statutes (WSS) (WSS 31-9-405).
         3.2.1.2. Automated records. Use the security police automated system (SPAS) computerized
         vehicle registration program. The registrant must read and understand the registration require-
         ments before issuing a decal.

3.3. Appointing Registration Officials . The chief of security police (CSP) develops local procedures
governing base registration officials. Generally, security police personnel working in the pass and regis-
tration section are assigned duties as registration officials. When authorized by the installation com-
mander, unit orderly room personnel may also act as registration officials for their unit personnel when
unit-level vehicle registration has been authorized. Local registration official procedures must cover the
following:
     3.3.1. Qualifications (i.e., grade, duty position, and skill level).
     3.3.2. Duty training requirements and general position responsibilities which must include record
     keeping procedures, inventory, and security procedures for controlled DD forms.
     3.3.3. Appointment procedures for those authorized to perform as registration officials.

3.4. Specifications for DD Form 2220.
AFI31-204_90SWSUP1_I 20 FEBRUARY 2004                                                                       19


   3.4.1. Use the DD Form 2220 to register vehicles on Air Force installations. Remove the form from
   POVs when registration expires or registration privileges terminate.
   3.4.2. Use the installation tag (4” X 1/2”) to identify the Air Force installation where the vehicle is
   registered. Position this decal directly under the DD Form 2220. The tags are color coded according
   to the category of the registrant and are issued as follows:
       3.4.2.1. Officer--blue background with white letters.
       3.4.2.2. Noncommissioned officer--gold background with black letters.
       3.4.2.3. Airman--red background with white letters.
       3.4.2.4. Civilian--green background with white letters.
       3.4.2.5. Contractor--white background with black letters.
NOTE: The installation commander determines the color code used by dependents of deceased military
members.
   3.4.3. Use AF Form 2219, Registered Vehicle Expiration (2” X 3/4”), to maintain the validity of a
   vehicle’s registration. This tab has a suffix (series) corresponding to a particular year of expiration
   (i.e., 2219A, 2219B, etc.). Revalidate registration by issuing a different “series” at a minimum of
   every three years. Position this decal to the right of the DD Form 2220.
   3.4.4. Prominently affix registration decals to the windshield (centered at the top or at lower driver's
   side corner), on the front bumper (driver's side), or to a owner supplied plate securely fastened to the
   driver's side bumper, bumper mounting bracket, or license plate mounting bracket. State and local
   policy can affect the exact placement. On two-wheeled vehicles, place registration decals on a con-
   spicuous front-facing surface or plate affixed to a front-facing surface.
   3.4.5. Use AF Form 787, Handicapped Person Vehicle Decal, to identify vehicles of handicapped
   persons. Position the decal to the right of the DD Form 2220. For short term and temporary disabili-
   ties, the installation commander may authorize issue of the AF Form 787 or a locally devised card or
   form. When authorized, temporary local cards or forms should contain an issue and expiration date.
   Issue and display in accordance with local procedure. Note: Honor local and state issued handicap
   decals, placards, signs, etc., on all Air Force installations. Don't require personnel issued local or state
   handicapped parking identification media to have an AF Form 787.

3.5. Termination or Denial of Registration . Vehicle registration will be denied under the following
conditions:
   3.5.1. The owner fails to comply with the registration requirements of paragraph 3.2.
   3.5.2. The owner sells or disposes of the registered POV, is released from active duty, is separated
   from the service, or terminates civilian employment with a military service or DoD agency.
   3.5.3. The owner is other than an active duty military or civilian employee and discontinues regular
   operation of the POV on the installation.
   3.5.4. The state, overseas command, host nation, or installation suspends or revokes the owner's driv-
   ing privilege. Affected persons can apply to reregister their POV after their suspension or revocation
   period expires. Other family members having installation driving privileges may transfer the base
   vehicle registration into their name. If so, change the AF Form 533 or SPAS data base to reflect the
20                                                        AFI31-204_90SWSUP1_I 20 FEBRUARY 2004


     new registrant. Note: The installation commander determines the period of time a person has before
     they must surrender their DD Form 2220 or transfer the decal and base registration to another autho-
     rized driver.
     3.5.5. When a registrant is transferred. The installation commander may permit registration by the
     spouse or other dependents continuing to live near the installation. When this occurs, update the AF
     Form 533 or SPAS data base.
     3.5.6. When ownership of a vehicle is transferred. The new owner of a previously registered vehicle
     can transfer the registration provided the new owner is eligible for base vehicle registration. The new
     owner must follow the procedures in paragraph 3.2.
     3.5.7. During a PCS transfer. If authorized by the installation commander, a registrant may keep the
     registration decal on their vehicle for re-registration at the gaining installation. In this case, the losing
     installation transfers the registration number to the gaining pass and registration section where only a
     new installation tab is issued upon the member's arrival at the new duty station. Note: This procedure
     is not allowed for CONUS to OCONUS POV shipments or consecutive OCONUS to OCONUS trans-
     fers unless the vehicle will be accompanied or driven by a registered owner. Unless the vehicle is
     accompanied or driven, surrender the DD Form 2220 as part of normal out processing.

3.6. Specified Consent to Impoundment. Personnel must consent to the installation vehicle impound-
ment policy if they wish to drive on the installation. POV registration forms or policy will contain or have
appended to them a certificate with the following statement:
“I am aware that AFI 31-204, Air Force Motor Vehicle Traffic Supervision, and the installation traffic
code provide for the removal and temporary impoundment of privately owned vehicles parked illegally
for unreasonable periods, interfering with military operations, creating a safety hazard, disabled by inci-
dent, left unattended in a restricted or controlled area, or abandoned. I agree to reimburse any agency or
contractor for the cost of towing, storing, and disposing of my motor vehicle if it is lawfully removed and
impounded."

                                                Chapter 4

                                TRAFFIC PLANNING AND CODES

4.1. Traffic Planning
   4.1.1. Safe and efficient movement of traffic on an installation requires traffic supervision. A strong
   traffic supervision program includes sound traffic circulation planning, supervision, and control of
   motor vehicle traffic. Proactive publication and enforcement of traffic laws and regulations together
   with timely and professional investigation of motor vehicle accidents are also important. Finally,
   every successful program must include meaningful interaction, education, and communication with
   the general public.
   4.1.2. Installation commanders develop traffic circulation plans that provide for the safest and most
   efficient use of primary and secondary roads. A major focus of installation traffic planning is circula-
   tion control. The base traffic engineer, CSP, safety officer, and other concerned staff agencies develop
   the traffic circulation plan. Consult with highway engineering representatives from adjacent civilian
   communities to ensure the installation plan is compatible with plans developed by the state and sur-
   rounding local communities. As a minimum, your base traffic plan should consider the following:
      4.1.2.1. Normal and peak load routing based on traffic control studies.
      4.1.2.2. Effective control of traffic, using planned traffic flow patterns which include measures
      for special events and adverse road conditions.
      4.1.2.3. Point control at congested locations by law enforcement personnel or designated traffic
      directors or wardens, including trained school-crossing guards.
      4.1.2.4. Use of traffic control signs and devices.
      4.1.2.5. Efficient use of available parking facilities.
      4.1.2.6. Efficient use of mass transportation.
      4.1.2.7. Every installation commander should appoint a primary and alternate base traffic engi-
      neer. The engineer directs, develops, and staffs the base traffic circulation plan. This is normally
      a civil engineering responsibility and those considered for the position should have an infrastruc-
      ture planning and engineering background.
   4.1.3. Traffic control studies provide factual data on existing roads, traffic density and flow patterns,
   and points of congestion. The CSP and traffic engineer usually conduct coordinated traffic control
   studies to obtain the data. Accurate data helps determine major and minor routes, locations for traffic
   control devices, and special conditions requiring engineering or enforcement services.
   4.1.4. The Military Traffic Management Command Transportation Engineering Agency (MTMC-
   TEA) will help installation commanders solve complex highway traffic engineering problems. MTM-
   CTEA traffic engineering team services include:
      4.1.4.1. Traffic studies of lifted areas and other special situations.
      4.1.4.2. Complete studies of traffic operations of entire installations.
      4.1.4.3. Assistance in complying with established traffic engineering standards.
22                                                     AFI31-204_90SWSUP1_I 20 FEBRUARY 2004


     4.1.5. Installation commanders submit requests for MTMCTEA assistance in accordance with AFR
     75-88, Highways for National Defense.

4.2. Installation Traffic Codes.
     4.2.1. Installation commanders must establish a traffic code for operation of motor vehicles on the
     installation. Commanders in overseas areas establish a traffic code to the extent military authority is
     empowered to regulate traffic under applicable treaties or agreements. Installation traffic codes must
     contain the base rules of the road and will, to the degree possible, conform to the code of the state or
     host nation in which the installation is located. The CSP is responsible for developing the traffic code
     and for ensuring it meets all local and legal requirements, this AFI, and the standards published in the
     following:
     4.2.1. (90SW) The Installation Traffic Code (ITC) is established in attachment three to this supple-
     ment. In addition, all state statutes governing traffic are assimilated under Title 18 USC, Sec 13,
     Assimilated Crimes Act, and will be enforced on the installation. The WSS listed in the ITC are not all
     inclusive; this is a list of the most violated statues. The US District Court sets the fines.
        4.2.1.1. The National Highway Safety Program Standards, as published in 23, CFR 1230.
        4.2.1.2. Applicable portions of the Uniform Vehicle Code and Model Traffic Ordinance published
        by the National Committee on Uniform Traffic Laws and Ordinances, which is contained in 23,
        CFR 1204.
        4.2.1.3. DoDI 6055.4, DoD Traffic Safety Program.
     4.2.2. The installation traffic code must contain policy and procedures for the towing, searching,
     impounding, and inventorying of vehicles. Publish these provisions and ensure they contain the fol-
     lowing:

        ing motorcycles, mopeds, or other open two-, three-, and four-wheel vehicles powered by a motor-
        cycle-type engine. See paragraph 4.2.6. for information concerning off-road vehicle use.
        Installations should adopt local, state, or host nation guidance concerning the legal definition,
        operation, use, and control of mopeds, motorized bicycles, and other such devices on installation
        roadways. Such guidelines will be modified or restricted as necessary to ensure personal safety or

     the safe and orderly flow of installation traffic. Refer to AFI 91-207 for helmet, eye, and clothing
     safety requirements.
     4.2.3.2. Restraint systems.
         4.2.3.2.1. Operators and passengers of all vehicles operated on Air Force installations must
         wear restraint systems. In addition, operators and passengers of GOVs must wear restraint
         systems when driving or riding off the installation as well.
         4.2.3.2.1. (90SW) Personnel operating a motor vehicle who are found (not wearing restraint
         systems) in violation of AFI 31-204, paragraphs 4.2.3.2.1., 4.2.3.2.2. and 4.2.3.2.3., will have
         base driving privileges suspended as follows:
             4.2.3.2.1.1. (Added-90SW) First violation: Base driving privileges suspended for 10 days.
             4.2.3.2.1.2. (Added-90SW) Second violation: Base driving privileges suspended for 30
             days.
             4.2.3.2.1.3. (Added-90SW) Third violation: Base driving privileges suspended for 90
             days.
         4.2.3.2.2. All Air Force active duty and reserve component members on active duty must
         wear restraint systems while driving or riding in a POV whether on or off the installation.
         4.2.3.2.3. US Department of Transportation requires approved infant/child restraint devices in
         POVs for children 4 years old or under and not exceeding 50 pounds in weight.
         4.2.3.2.4. Cars manufactured after model year 1966 require a manufacturer-approved restraint
         system meeting federal traffic safety standards.
         4.2.3.2.5. Operators using vehicles equipped with air bags must still wear the manufacturer's
         primary restraint system (seat belts).
     4.2.3.3. Headphones and earphones. The wearing of headphones and earphones is prohibited
     while driving a motor vehicle on base. This does not negate wearing of hearing protection when
     conditions and good judgment dictate its use such as when driving in noise hazard areas. This
     restriction does not apply to intercom systems worn by motorcycle operators and their passengers.
     4.2.3.3. (90SW) Headphones and earphones. Wearing headphones and earphones is prohibited
     while driving a motor vehicle on base. This does not negate wearing hearing protection when con-
     ditions and good judgment dictate its use, such as driving in noise hazard areas. This restriction
     does not apply to intercom systems worn by motorcycle operators and their passengers.
         4.2.3.3.1. (Added-90SW) No person operating a vehicle shall allow the volume of the ampli-
         fied sound to be heard for a distance of 50 feet from the source. Negative considerations will
         be if the noise is raucous, jarring, or vibration is deemed and/or reported as a nuisance or dis-
         turbance by a person(s) in the area of audibility.
  4.2.4. Take only administrative actions (reprimand, assessment of points, loss of installation driving
  privileges, etc.) for off-installation violations of the installation traffic code.
  4.2.5. At bases with concurrent or exclusive federal jurisdiction, make violations of state traffic codes
  applicable to base driving records when those violations are included in that state’s criminal offense
  code. This provision is covered under the authority of Title 18 United States Code 13 (USC).
24                                                      AFI31-204_90SWSUP1_I 20 FEBRUARY 2004


        4.2.5.1. DoDD 5525.4, Enforcement of State Traffic Laws on DoD Installations, adopts the vehic-
        ular and pedestrian traffic laws of states where traffic law violations are not considered criminal
        offenses and cannot be assimilated under 18 USC. It makes these laws applicable to military
        installations having concurrent or exclusive federal jurisdiction. It also delegates authority to
        installation commanders to establish additional vehicular and pedestrian traffic rules and regula-
        tions for their installations. Those found guilty of violating traffic laws made applicable on instal-
        lations under provisions of DoDD 5525.4 are subject to a fine of not more than $50 or
        imprisonment for not more than 30 days or both for each violation. In those states where you can-
        not assimilate traffic laws, post an extracted copy of this paragraph and a copy of DoDD 5525.4 in
        a prominent place accessible to persons assigned, living, or working on the installation.
            4.2.5.1.1. Take only administrative actions in states where you cannot assimilate violations of
            traffic laws under either Title 18 USC 13 or DoDD 5525.4. Generally, this applies to installa-
            tions under part or full proprietary jurisdiction.
            4.2.5.1.2. (Added-90SW) U-Turns are only allowed at installation gates when directed by
            Security Forces, on dead end streets, off-street parking areas or at gates closed to traffic.
            4.2.5.1.3. (Added-90SW) Knowingly allowing a person under the influence of alcohol or
            drugs to operate a vehicle will result in 1-year revocation of installation driving privileges and/
            or prosecution under the UCMJ.
            4.2.5.1.4. (Added-90SW) Children under 8 will not be left in motor vehicles at any time with-
            out supervision (a responsible individual). Vehicles will not be left idling without a qualified
            driver in the vehicle. Pets will not be left unattended in motor vehicles for any length of time
            that would be hazardous to the pet’s health.
     4.2.6. Off-road vehicles usage: The installation commander or his or her designee determines if,
     when, and where off-road vehicles may be operated on base. In many areas, the operation of off-road
     vehicles is unregulated while other jurisdictions have strict requirements concerning age, safety train-
     ing, and vehicle equipment. Generally, some "on-street" safety practices such as reflective vests,
     gloves, headlight on, and goggles may not apply when operating off road in a recreational capacity.
     However, ensure full compliance with local, state, or host nation requirements. When necessary,
     develop additional procedures and guidance locally and publish in the installation traffic safety plan or
     supplement to this instruction. Ensure environmental considerations are reviewed prior to designating
     any off-road vehicle use area.
        4.2.6.1. (Added-90SW) Off-road vehicle use is not authorized on FEW. All Terrain Vehicles
        (ATV) which are registered off base as privately owned vehicles are not authorized access or reg-
        istration on FEW. ATVs utilized for mission needs are authorized; however, these vehicles are not
        authorized for normal transportation on paved roads. If needed, ATVs will be driven parallel to the
        paved surface, but will not interfere with pedestrian traffic. Brief excursions across paved road-
        ways for mission requirements are authorized.

4.3. Traffic Law Enforcement Principles.
     4.3.1. Traffic law enforcement should motivate drivers to operate vehicles safely within traffic laws
     and regulations and maintain an effective and efficient flow of traffic. Effective enforcement should
     emphasize selective enforcement and voluntary compliance by drivers. You can reach these goals by
     developing effective programs in the following areas.
AFI31-204_90SWSUP1_I 20 FEBRUARY 2004                                                                   25


      4.3.1.1. Publishing a realistic traffic code well known by all personnel.
      4.3.1.2. Adopting standard signs, markings, and signals in accordance with National Highway
      Safety Program Standards (NHSPS) and the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for
      Streets and Highways.
      4.3.1.3. Ensuring enforcement personnel establish courteous, personal contact with drivers, and
      act promptly when driving behavior is improper or when observing a defective vehicle in opera-
      tion.
      4.3.1.4. Maintain an aggressive program to detect and apprehend those who drive with suspended
      or revoked privileges.
      4.3.1.5. Use sound discretion and judgment in deciding when to apprehend, issue a citation, or
      warn the offender.
   4.3.2. Enforcement activities against intoxicated driving will include:
      4.3.2.1. Detecting, apprehending, and testing persons suspected of driving under the influence of
      alcohol or drugs.
      4.3.2.2. Training law enforcement personnel in special enforcement standards, detection tech-
      niques, and equipment standards unique to your location and jurisdiction.
      4.3.2.3. Enforcing blood-alcohol concentration standards (see paragraph 4.11.).
      4.3.2.4. Denying installation driving privileges to those whose use of alcohol or drugs prevents
      their safe operation of a motor vehicle.

4.4. Speed-measuring Devices. Use speed-measuring devices in traffic control studies and enforce-
ment programs. Post signs to indicate the use of speed-measuring devices.
   4.4.1. Equipment purchases. Installations located in states having a formal civilian police training
   and certification program for speed measurement should consider purchasing the same brand and
   model of equipment used by their civilian counterparts. Where possible, attend the same or similar
   certification courses used by local authorities.
   4.4.2. Training and certification standards.
   4.4.2. (90SW) The use of radar detection devices to indicate the presence of speed recording instru-
   ments or to transmit simulated erroneous speed is unauthorized while on F. E. Warren AFB.
      4.4.2.1. The CSP should strive to ensure operators of speed-measuring devices meet training and
      certification requirements prescribed by the state or jurisdiction where the installation is located.
      Obtain specific information on course dates, costs, and prerequisites for attending by contacting
      the state agency responsible for police traffic radar training. Notwithstanding the above informa-
      tion, the CSP may establish other local training and certification programs for operators of
      speed-measuring devices. If exercising this option, you must ensure your qualification and train-
      ing standards are admissible as evidence and considered reliable by both military and civil author-
      ities. This requirement applies to courts-martial, nonjudicial proceedings, and civilian courts used
      to prosecute civilian offenders. Coordination between the military staff judge advocate and attor-
      ney general (or equivalent) is necessary.
26                                                     AFI31-204_90SWSUP1_I 20 FEBRUARY 2004


        4.4.2.2. Develop local training programs or attend a civilian institution or manufacturer's training
        program if security police are unable to attend local or state-sponsored radar certification courses.
        4.4.2.3. The objective of civilian or manufacturer-sponsored courses is to improve the effective-
        ness of speed enforcement through the proper and efficient use of speed-measurement radar. On
        successful completion, the course graduate must know how to:
            4.4.2.3.1. Describe the association between excessive speed and accidents, deaths, and inju-
            ries, and describe the traffic safety benefits of effective speed control.
            4.4.2.3.2. Describe the basic principles of radar speed measurement.
            4.4.2.3.3. Identify and describe Air Force speed measurement and speed enforcement policy
            and procedure.
            4.4.2.3.4. Identify the specific radar instrument used and describe the instrument’s major
            components and functions.
            4.4.2.3.5. Demonstrate basic skills in calibrating and operating the specific radar instru-
            ment(s).
            4.4.2.3.6. Demonstrate basic skills in preparing and presenting records and courtroom testi-
            mony relating to radar speed measurement and enforcement.
     4.4.3. Recertification. Certify operators every three years or more frequently when required by the
     state or governing jurisdiction. The CSP must document and maintain certification and training stan-
     dards in the unit training section. Forward records to gaining unit commanders when personnel PCS.
     4.4.3. (90SW) At F. E. Warren AFB, RADAR operators are not required to show the speed displayed
     on the RADAR unit to the vehicle operator stopped for a speed violation.
     4.4.4. Use the following sources in local training and certification programs:
        4.4.4.1. State or local training guides, plans, and procedures.
        4.4.4.2. Publish techniques for radar speed detection and legal aspects of speed-measuring
        devices by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the International Association
        of Directors of Law Enforcement Standards and Training.

4.5. Traffic Accident Investigation.
     4.5.1. Conduct detailed investigations of the following:
        4.5.1.1. All accidents involving a fatality or personal injury.
        4.5.1.2. Vehicle and private property damage over the amount specified by the installation com-
        mander. This applies to government as well as private vehicles and property damage; however,
        the installation commander may establish different damage amounts for each category.
        4.5.1.2. (90SW) Security forces personnel will conduct detailed investigations of vehicle and pri-
        vate property damage over the amount of $10,000.
     4.5.2. Conduct investigations of off-installation accidents involving military personnel according to
     local policy developed by the CSP and local police leaders.
AFI31-204_90SWSUP1_I 20 FEBRUARY 2004                                                                      27


NOTE: Generally, a detailed accident investigation includes, but is not limited to, an accident report
form, field sketch, scale diagram, and accident narrative.

4.6. Traffic Accident Investigation Reports.
   4.6.1. Anyone involved in an on-base vehicle accident must immediately report the incident to the
   security police. Report off-base accidents to the security police if they involve injuries to military per-
   sonnel or damage to military property. The installation commander determines what agencies to notify
   and for what type of accidents to notify them. The CSP must develop a local notification matrix or
   other procedures that will ensure notification of appropriate base and civilian agencies. Develop and
   publish these notification procedures locally.
   4.6.1. (90SW) Minor collisions are those that do not meet the major accident criteria in AFI 31-204.
   Drivers involved in any on-base collisions will report the accident immediately to the LED.
   4.6.2. The security police will act as the focal point for gathering off-base accident information.
   Record the information in the security police desk blotter. When possible, obtain copies of major
   accident reports prepared by investigating civilian police agencies.
   4.6.2. (90SW) 90 SFS/SFAR will request a copy of the accident report through the responsible police
   agency. They will then forward a copy of the report to 90 SW/SE.
   4.6.3. Security police respond to all on-base major vehicle accidents (unless local conditions or poli-
   cies prohibit) to accomplish the following:
       4.6.3.1. Render first aid and arrange for medical assistance.
       4.6.3.2. Protect personal property.
       4.6.3.3. Normalize traffic.
       4.6.3.4. Identify witnesses and personnel involved.
       4.6.3.5. Conduct a formal investigation.
       4.6.3.6. The CSP determines (with installation commander approval) when and/or if minor vehi-
       cle accidents require investigation or a police response. He or she may delegate this authority to
       on-duty security police supervisory personnel. Develop policy in this area locally.
   4.6.4. Report minor accidents not involving a security police response to the security police within 72
   hours. Record accident information in the security police blotter. This information should include the
   accident type, time and date, location, name(s) of vehicle operator(s), unit (or address when civilian
   not affiliated with military), vehicle description, and license number(s). You should also include a
   brief summary of any damage and circumstances behind or causing the accident. A minor accident is
   any accident in which there are no fatalities/injuries or vehicle/property damage above the amount
   established by the installation commander. Consequently, a major accident is any accident involving
   a fatality, injury, or property damage above the amount established by the installation commander.
   The installation commander may set differing amounts for government versus private vehicle and
   property damage. The investigation of major accidents involve specialized accident investigative
   techniques to draw conclusions and opinions about how and why the accident occurred.
       4.6.4.1. Injury is defined as any one of the following caused or aggravated by a motor vehicle
       accident:
28                                                     AFI31-204_90SWSUP1_I 20 FEBRUARY 2004


            4.6.4.1.1. Any condition requiring medical attention
            4.6.4.1.2. Complaint or report of pain or injury regardless if medical attention is sought
            4.6.4.1.3. Any visible injury. This includes bruises, contusions, cuts, scrapes, compression, or
            any other visible damage to the body.

4.7. Use of Traffic Accident Investigation Report Data.
     4.7.1. Analyze data derived from traffic accident investigations to determine accident causes. When
     frequent accidents occur in one area, analyze location conditions, type of accidents, and other factors
     in an attempt to isolate causes. With the exception of privacy act information, make accident data and
     trend analysis available to agencies requesting the data for reporting and analytical purposes. With the
     exception of requests filed under the Freedom of Information Act, the CSP determines the agencies
     cleared to receive accident and incident data.
     4.7.2. Law enforcement personnel and others who prepare traffic accident investigation reports will
     indicate if a seat restraint was used at the time of the accident, and where applicable, if air bags
     deployed.

4.8. Parking.
4.8. (90SW) Parking. Parking is not authorized on any paved or dirt surface not clearly lined, marked or
otherwise designated for parking. Exception: Personnel residing in military housing may park along the
curb unless in a clearly marked prohibited area to include designated snow routes if it is already snowing,
snow is forecast within the next 24 hours or 90 CE is already clearing roadways. During special events
(e.g. commander’s call) temporary authorized roadside parking along selected streets will be authorized.
No private automotive repairs will be performed on roadways within the confines of the installation. The
only authorized locations are inside base housing area garages, at the Auto Hobby Shop or at the Shop-
pette Service Station. Repairs made in the housing area or dormitories must be of minor maintenance
activity (e.g., engine oil change, battery replacement, etc.) and hazardous materials must be disposed of
properly. Any repair that renders the vehicle inoperative for a period exceeding 24 hours is unauthorized
in all base housing areas/dormitories.
     4.8.1. Illegal parking contributes to congestion and slows traffic flow on the installation. Strong
     enforcement of parking rules results in better use of available parking while reducing traffic accidents
     and hazards. Combine enforcement with community education and awareness initiatives in areas
     where illegal parking is a problem. When education and awareness fail, installation commanders may
     authorize more serious enforcement measures such as towing and "booting" of vehicles. Do not use
     towing and booting if less severe means of enforcement such as warnings, ticketing, reprimands, revo-
     cations, etc., prove effective. When using towing and booting, follow the guidelines below:
        4.8.1.1. Publish operating instructions to control discretion of enforcers and limit towing or boot-
        ing to specific offenses.
        4.8.1.2. Focus on specific reasons for towing or booting. Booting is effective for immobilizing
        unsafe vehicles, or vehicles not inspected or registered. Use booting in high offense areas or to
        compel the presence of repeat offenders. Towing is more effective for moving vehicles that pose
        safety hazards. Some examples include double parking, and blocking fire hydrants and fire lanes.
AFI31-204_90SWSUP1_I 20 FEBRUARY 2004                                                                  29


     4.8.1.3. Notify drivers that certain violations or multiple violations may result in towing or boot-
     ing. Also, provide drivers a prompt opportunity to obtain release of their property.
     4.8.1.4. Warn drivers when a boot is attached to their vehicle and instruct them on how to have the
     boot removed without damaging the vehicle.
  4.8.2. Reserved Parking. When not addressed by MAJCOMs, installation commanders determine
  reserved parking policy for their installations. Number of available spaces, facility design and layout,
  traffic flow, and number of vehicles using facilities will help determine the number and location of
  reserved parking spaces. Make policy and procedures governing reserved parking a part of the instal-
  lation supplement to this instruction, separate traffic control instruction, or base parking plan. The
  publication must address approval, issue, control, and review of reserved parking and should give spe-
  cial consideration to bicycle, motorcycle, visitor, and car pool parking. Handicap parking is regulated
  under the uniform federal accessibility standards and applies to all Air Force installations.
  4.8.2. (90SW) Reserved parking. Signs will be IAW 90 Civil Engineering Squadron guidelines and
  AFP 88-40. Exceptions will be considered on a case-by-case basis. 90 CES/CC is the approval author-
  ity for all reserved parking sign requests, including proposed signs that deviate from the guidance
  above. The building facility manager will request approval for desired parking spaces by submitting
  an AF Form 1768, Staff Summary Sheet, through 90 CES/CEO, 90 SW/SE, and 90 SFS/SFOSP for
  approval by 90 CES/CC. This request must include a legible diagram showing the location of the
  reserved parking. Once approved, submit a work order to request the appropriate signs. Each base
  facility will be allowed reserved parking for the following users:
     4.8.2.1. (Added-90SW) Wing and vice wing commander (Certain buildings only.)
     4.8.2.2. (Added-90SW) One reserved space for each group commander and each deputy group
     commander permanently occupying a facility
     4.8.2.3. (Added-90SW) One reserved space for each squadron commander and each deputy
     squadron commander (or appropriate equivalent) permanently occupying a facility
     4.8.2.4. (Added-90SW) One reserved space for each squadron first sergeant permanently occupy-
     ing a facility
     4.8.2.5. (Added-90SW) Disabled parking based on the Americans with Disabilities Act Accessi-
     bility Guidelines
  4.8.3. You can use distinctive emblems, decals, stickers, etc., to control parking space assignments
  and to indicate authorized use of the parking slot. If this identification media is placed on a vehicle
  bumper, separate it from the vehicle registration identification. MAJCOMs (or installation command-
  ers if not addressed by the MAJCOM) may develop policy concerning the issue and control of the
  identification media discussed above.
  4.8.3. (90SW) 90 SFS Pass & Registration will control restricted parking at the lot near Gate Two.
  Pass and Registration will issue a parking permit for 30 days.
  4.8.4. You can use parking wardens (unit personnel) to monitor and cite parking violators, especially
  within off-street parking facilities.
  4.8.4. (90SW) Officers, NCOs or civilian equivalents, may perform duties as a Parking Warden in
  parking areas under their commander’s control. Parking Wardens are authorized to issue tickets only
  for parking violations listed in the ITC. Commanders submit memorandums to 90 SFS/CC appointing
30                                                      AFI31-204_90SWSUP1_I 20 FEBRUARY 2004


     primary and alternate Parking Wardens that include appointee’s full name, rank, office symbol, and
     duty phone. Parking Wardens receive training and ticket books from 90 SFS/SFO. Tickets will be for-
     warded to 90 SFS/SFAR by the next duty day. Parking Wardens will comply with rules established by
     90 SFS/SFAR.

4.9. Traffic Violation Reports.
     4.9.1. Commanders should deal with most traffic violations occurring on Air Force installations
     within Air Force channels.
     4.9.2. You can refer traffic violations occurring on Air Force installations (within the United States or
     its territories) to the proper US Magistrate. Do not refer violations in the following circumstances:
        4.9.2.1. The operator is driving a government vehicle at the time of the violation.
        4.9.2.2. A US Federal Magistrate is either not available or lacks jurisdiction to hear the matter
        because the violation occurred in an area where the federal government has only proprietary legis-
        lative jurisdiction.
        4.9.2.3. Mission requirements make referral of offenders impractical.
        4.9.2.4. A US Magistrate is available, but the accused refuses to consent to the jurisdiction of the
        court and the US attorney refuses to process the case before a US district court.
     4.9.3. Issue traffic violators on military installations a DD Form 1408, Armed Forces Traffic Ticket,
     or a DD Form 1805, United States District Court Violation Notice. The CSP determines who is autho-
     rized to issue those forms and what training they must complete before issuing either form. The DD
     Form 1408 is issued to the following personnel: active duty personnel, Cadets/Midshipmen of the Mil-
     itary Academies to include the Coast Guard Academy, reservists on orders or performing inactive
     duty training including commuting to and from training, and guardsman in federal service under Title
     10 of the United States Code. Title 10 status is reflected on the guardsman’ s orders. Issue civilians the
     DD Form 1805, or the DD Form 1408 when a US Magistrate system is not available.”
     4.9.4. Installation commanders establish procedures for disposing of traffic violation cases through
     administrative or judicial action consistent with the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) and
     federal law. Additionally, forward a copy of all violation reports on military personnel and DoD civil-
     ian employees apprehended for intoxicated driving to the Substance Abuse Office, Drug and Alcohol
     Control.
     4.9.5. Unless restricted under the provisions of para 4.9.2., use the DD Form 1805 to refer civilian
     violators of state and federal traffic laws to the appropriate US magistrate. Notify the commander,
     first sergeant, or supervisor when any military personnel or DoD civilian employees is cited with the
     DD Form 1805. If requested, locally reproduce a copy of the DD Form 1805 and make it available to
     the commander, first sergeant, or supervisor.
        4.9.5.1. Preparation of the DD Form 1805. This prenumbered form is issued through standard
        publication channels and is only accountable once it is issued to an offender. Before issuing this
        form, stamp (type) in black ink the specific address of the clerk of the US District Court (Central
        Violations Bureau) to which the violator must address the communication, on the reverse of the
        violator’s copy (manila card stock) of the four-part form. Determine the entry for the amount of
        the fine, mandatory court appearance of the offender, and the date of appearance according to
        guidance furnished by the governing district court.
AFI31-204_90SWSUP1_I 20 FEBRUARY 2004                                                                   31


       4.9.5.2. Identify the assimilation of state traffic laws by a specific state code reference in the
       CODE SECTION block of the DD Form 1805 or in a complaint filed with the US magistrate.
       4.9.5.3. Use the statement of probable cause on the DD Form 1805 according to local staff judge
       advocate and US magistrate court policy. The statement of probable cause is required by the fed-
       eral misdemeanor rules to support the issuance of a summons or arrest warrant.
       4.9.5.4. For cases referred to US magistrate, normal distribution of DD Form 1805 is as follows:
          4.9.5.4.1. The CSP forwards copy 1 (white) and copy 2 (yellow) to the US District Court
          (Central Violation Bureau).
          4.9.5.4.2. Security police file copy 3 (pink).
          4.9.5.4.3. Provide copy 4 (envelope) to the violator.
NOTE: Ensure unit personnel are notified IAW para 4.9.5. above.
       4.9.5.5. When DD Form 1408 is used, distribute the form as follows:
          4.9.5.5.1. Provide the pink copy to the violator with normal reporting instructions and rebuttal
          instructions as determined by the installation commander.
          4.9.5.5.2. Forward the white copy to the service member’s commander, to the commander of
          the family member’s sponsor, or to the civilian’s supervisor or employer for administrative
          action within the unit/organization.
          4.9.5.5.3. Forward the yellow copy to the security police administration branch for processing
          and tracking until the white "action copy" is returned by the unit commander, section com-
          mander, or first sergeant. When the white copy is received, review it for action taken, annotate
          the information in SPAS or the AF Form 1313, Driver Record, with the moving or non-mov-
          ing violation and any points assessed. File the white and yellow copies with the driver record.

4.10. Standards and Procedures for Processing Intoxicated Drivers.
   4.10.1. As a minimum, the CSP must train installation law enforcement personnel to do the follow-
   ing:
       4.10.1.1. Recognize signs of alcohol and other drug impairment in persons operating motor vehi-
       cles.
       4.10.1.2. Prepare DD Form 1920, Alcohol Influence Report, or other form which adequately
       documents sobriety and sobriety testing of an individual.
       4.10.1.3. Perform standard field sobriety tests. The standardized Air Force field sobriety test con-
       sists of the one leg stand, the walk and turn, and the horizontal gaze nystagmus. Also consider any
       local, state, or host nation sobriety test requirements in addition to the above standard Air Force
       tests.
       4.10.1.4. Determine to a reasonable and practical degree when a person appears intoxicated, but
       is actually physically or mentally ill and requires prompt medical attention.
       4.10.1.5. Understand the operation of breath-testing devices.
   4.10.2. Each installation using breath-testing devices will ensure operators of these devices:
32                                                      AFI31-204_90SWSUP1_I 20 FEBRUARY 2004


        4.10.2.1. Are chosen for integrity, maturity, and sound judgment.
        4.10.2.2. Meet installation, and where possible, state certification standards.
     4.10.3. Use only breath-testing devices listed on the approved NHTSA conforming products list pub-
     lished in the Federal Register. Ensure only trained personnel administer tests as specified in para-
     graph 4.13. and adhere to the procedures described in paragraphs 4.14. and 4.15. relating to voluntary
     and involuntary testing.
     4.10.4. Installations located in states or overseas areas with no formal training program will develop
     their own training program following material and guidance from selected civilian institutions or
     manufacturers of the equipment. Coordinate local training programs with the installation staff judge
     advocate and state's attorney general (or local equivalent) to ensure your program meets local require-
     ments for legal admissibility. Conduct refresher training at the intervals determined by the CSP and
     staff judge advocate.

4.11. Blood Alcohol Concentration Standards.
     4.11.1. Uniformly apply administrative revocation of driving privileges and other enforcement mea-
     sures to offenders driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs. When a person is tested per para-
     graph 2.3., evaluate the results of the test as follows:
        4.11.1.1. If the percentage of alcohol in the person’s blood is less than 0.05 percent, presume the
        person is not under the influence of alcohol.
        4.11.1.2. If the percentage is 0.05 but less than 0.10, presume the person is impaired. Consider
        this standard with other competent evidence in determining whether the person was under the
        influence of alcohol. Suspend driving privileges according to para 2.5. Note: The 0.10 threshold
        delineating impaired from intoxicated can be lesser level when assimilating a more stringent local,
        state, or host nation standard.
        4.11.1.3. If the percentage is 0.10 (or lesser amount when assimilating local, state, or host nation
        standards) or more or if tests reflect the presence of illegal drugs, the person is considered to have
        been driving under the influence of intoxicants. Suspend driving privileges according to para
        2.5.1.3.
            4.11.1.3.1. (Added-90SW) A person younger than 21 years of age shall not operate, or be in
            physical control of, a vehicle in Wyoming with an alcohol concentration of two one-hun-
            dredths of one percent (0.02%) or more. One-year revocation/suspension is mandatory.
     4.11.2. Percentages in paragraph 4.11.1. are percent of weight by volume of alcohol in the blood
     based on grams of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood. Installation commanders will modify military
     standards to agree with a more stringent state, local authority, or host nation standard. Refer to Assess-
     ment #3, Table 5.1.

4.12. Chemical Testing Policies and Procedures.
     4.12.1. Results of chemical testing are valid under this instruction only under the following circum-
     stances:
        4.12.1.1. Testing of blood, breath, urine, or other bodily substances using generally accepted sci-
        entific and medical methods and standards.
AFI31-204_90SWSUP1_I 20 FEBRUARY 2004                                                                     33


      4.12.1.2. Qualified personnel administer breath tests.
      4.12.1.3. Use of a nonportable breath-testing device approved by the state or host nation.
   4.12.2. If the state or host nation has not established procedures for use of breath-testing devices, then
   apply the following procedures if you use portable breath-testing devices: 1) During the initial traffic
   stop as a field sobriety testing technique in lieu of or in conjunction with other field sobriety testing
   techniques as long as the state or host nation does not prohibit such use, and 2) According to the man-
   ufacturer's operating instructions.
      4.12.2.1. Use nonportable evidentiary breath-testing devices as follows:
          4.12.2.1.1. Observe the suspected person for at least 20 minutes before collecting the breath
          specimen. During this time, the person must not drink, eat, smoke, chew tobacco, or ingest
          any substance.
          4.12.2.1.2. Verify calibration and proper operation of the instrument according to manufac-
          turer's specifications and any specific local, state, or host nation requirements.
          4.12.2.1.3. Comply with operational procedures in the manufacturer’s current instruction
          manual. Perform the preventive maintenance as required by the owner's manual.
   4.12.3. Chemical tests of personnel involved in fatal accidents.
      4.12.3.1. Installation medical authorities will immediately notify and brief the CSP upon death of
      any person involved in a motor vehicle accident. Subject to military jurisdiction, medical author-
      ities will examine anyone killed in an on-base motor vehicle accident or mishap. Conduct tests for
      the presence and concentration of alcohol or other drugs in the blood, bodily fluids, or tissues as
      soon as possible and where practical within eight hours of death. Include the test results in the
      medical reports.
      4.12.3.2. As provided by law and medical conditions permitting, obtain a blood or breath sample
      from any surviving operator whose vehicle is involved in a fatal accident.

4.13. Detection, Apprehension, and Testing of Intoxicated Drivers.
   4.13.1. Most of the time you will detect drunk drivers by observing unusual or abnormal driving
   behavior. Stop these drivers and determine the cause of their unusual driving behavior. If you reason-
   ably conclude that the individual in control of the vehicle is impaired, perform field sobriety tests.
   The DD Form 1920 is used in examining, interpreting, and recording results of such tests. Use the
   standard field sobriety tests outlined in para 4.10. Specific procedures for administering them can be
   found in AFH 31-227, Air Force Motor Vehicle and Traffic Control. Also see AFH 31-227 for proce-
   dures and guidance concerning the use of traffic mazes, DWI checkpoints, and other drunk driving
   reduction measures.
   4.13.1. (90SW) Report Every Drunk Driver Immediately (REDDI) at extension 773-3501 will be
   used by the base public to report suspected incidents of an alcohol or drug-related driving incident in
   progress. Callers may remain anonymous. Emphasis of the program is to encourage participation,
   resulting in protection of the public. Law Enforcement may establish a traffic maze at locations where
   analysis identifies a trend involving alcohol or drug-related incidents. Drivers who do not successfully
   negotiate the maze will be subject to further sobriety evaluations. Location and times of the maze will
   be approved by the 90 MSG/CC.
34                                                      AFI31-204_90SWSUP1_I 20 FEBRUARY 2004


4.14. Voluntary Breath and Bodily Fluid Testing Based on Implied Consent.
     4.14.1. Implied consent policy is explained in paragraph 2.3.
     4.14.2. Administer tests only when the following conditions are met:
        4.14.2.1. The person was lawfully stopped while driving or while in physical control of a motor
        vehicle on the installation.
        4.14.2.2. Reasonable suspicion exists to believe the person was driving under the influence of
        alcohol or drugs.
        4.14.2.3. A request was made of the person to consent and he or she was advised that failure to
        voluntarily submit to or complete a chemical test of bodily fluids or breath may result in revoca-
        tion of on-base driving privileges.
     4.14.3. The installation commander prescribes the type of chemical tests used. Advise the driver that
     the installation commander may revoke driving privileges if they fail to voluntarily submit to or com-
     plete a requested chemical test and that they do not have the right to have an attorney present before
     deciding if they will or will not take the test. Testing will follow policies and procedures in paragraph
     4.12. Also advise the driver that you can use the results of chemical tests conducted under the implied
     consent provisions of this instruction as evidence in courts-martial, nonjudicial proceedings under
     Article 15 of the UCMJ, administrative action, or civil court proceeding.
     4.14.3. (90SW) The Intoximeter EC/IR (model) breath test accomplished by certified police person-
     nel is the primary method for determining blood alcohol concentration (BAC) at FEW. Military mem-
     bers may have a blood alcohol test administered by medical personnel if deemed necessary.
     4.14.4. Special rules exist for persons who have hemophilia, other blood-clotting disorders, or any
     medical or surgical disorder under treatment with an anticoagulant. Such people may refuse a blood
     extraction without penalty, but you can offer a breath or urine test, or both. You must outline these
     procedures and the type of medical conditions that qualify for nonpunitive refusal in readily available
     medical guidelines located in emergency rooms or other reasonable areas where blood samples might
     be drawn from those suspected of drunk driving. Valid refusals must have the concurrence of a med-
     ical doctor.
     4.14.5. If a person suspected of intoxicated driving refuses to submit to a chemical test, do not admin-
     ister a test except as specified in paragraph 4.15.

4.15. Involuntary Extraction of Bodily Fluids in Traffic Cases.
     4.15.1. These procedures pertain only to the investigation of individuals stopped, apprehended, or
     cited on a military installation for any offense related to driving a motor vehicle and for whom proba-
     ble cause exists to believe that such individual is intoxicated. Rule 312d, Military Rules of Evidence,
     and regulatory rules concerning requesting and granting authorizations for searches govern the extrac-
     tion of body fluids in furtherance of other kinds of investigations. Air Force policy on nonconsensual
     extraction of blood samples is further addressed in AFI 44-102, Patient Care and Management of
     Clinical Services.
     4.15.2. Involuntary bodily fluid extractions (blood or urine) require valid search and seizure authori-
     zations. A person subject to the UCMJ who does not consent to chemical testing, and who subse-
     quently refuses a lawful order to surrender to the test,. may nonetheless be forced to submit to an
AFI31-204_90SWSUP1_I 20 FEBRUARY 2004                                                                      35


   involuntary extraction of bodily fluids. As a general rule, forced extractions are considered only when
   an individual is involved in an accident in which there is a death, serious personal injury, or significant
   property damage. Probable cause must exist to believe the individual was driving or was in control of
   a vehicle while under the influence of an intoxicant. Conduct the extraction in accordance with the
   following procedures: 1) A search authorization by an appropriate commander or military magistrate
   obtained pursuant to Rule 315, Military Rules of Evidence, is required prior to such nonconsensual
   extraction; 2) A search authorization is not required under such circumstances when there is a clear
   indication that one will find evidence of intoxication and there is reason to believe that the delay nec-
   essary to obtain a search authorization would result in the loss or destruction of the evidence sought;
   and 3) Conduct warrantless searches only after coordination with the servicing staff judge advocate
   and attempts to gain authorization from an appropriate official fail because of the unavailability of the
   appropriate commander or military magistrate.
   4.15.2. (90SW) When civilians refuse to submit to a test to determine BAC, 90 MSG/CC will deter-
   mine revocation of driving privileges and actions to suspend the offender’s driver’s license.
      4.15.2.1. If authorization from the military magistrate or commander proves unsuccessful (due to
      nonavailability), the commander of a medical facility is empowered by Rule 315(d), Military
      Rules of Evidence, to authorize such extraction from an individual located in the facility at the
      time an authorization is sought.
          4.15.2.1.1. Before authorizing the involuntary extraction, the commander of the medical facil-
          ity should, if circumstances permit, coordinate with the servicing staff judge advocate.
          4.15.2.1.2. The medical facility commander authorizing an extraction under Rule 315(d) need
          not be on duty as the attending physician. Any qualified medical person can perform the
          extraction.
          4.15.2.1.3. The authorizing official may consider his or her own observations of the individ-
          ual in determining probable cause.
   4.15.3. Authorization for the nonconsensual extraction of blood samples for evidentiary purposes by
   qualified medical personnel is independent of and not limited by provisions defining medical care,
   such as the provision for nonconsensual medical care pursuant to AFR 160-12. Only qualified medi-
   cal personnel administer extractions and use only reasonable measures to accomplish the procedure.
   Assistance to overcome an individual’s resistance to the extraction is normally provided by law
   enforcement personnel or unit personnel acting under orders from the member’s commanding officer
   or designee. Do not use any form of life endangering force to effect nonconsensual extractions.
      4.15.3.1. Nonconsensual extraction will not interfere with or delay proper medical attention.
      Medical personnel determine the priority given to involuntary fluid extractions when other medi-
      cal treatment is required.

4.16. Testing at the Request of the Apprehended Person.
   4.16.1. A person subject to tests under paragraph 2.3. can request additional testing. These tests are
   paid for by the requesting individual, and an approved facility such as an off-base hospital or research
   laboratory performs the tests. If they desire admissibility of other tests in a military or civilian court
   of law, they must ensure the state (or host nation when in an overseas area) approves the test and test
   method. Complete all tests as soon as possible, noting any delay on the resulting documents.
36                                                      AFI31-204_90SWSUP1_I 20 FEBRUARY 2004


     4.16.2. If someone requests additional testing, the apprehending official may help make those
     arrangements. However, tests conducted under authority of the UCMJ remain valid when circum-
     stances prevent timely release of the individual, or for whatever reason additional testing is not com-
     pleted.

4.17. Off-installation Traffic Activities. Civil authorities enforce traffic laws in areas not under mili-
tary control. Likewise, the security police often investigate on-base accidents and incidents of interest to
local authorities. Consequently, the CSP must develop a program for the sharing and exchanging of infor-
mation with civil authorities. In overseas areas, these procedures are generally well documented in formal
agreements with the host nation. Local procedures must cover the receiving, processing, and securing of
traffic and related incident reports received from other investigative agencies.

4.18. Compliance With Local and State Laws.
     4.18.1. Installation commanders must ensure drivers comply with state and local traffic laws when
     operating government vehicles on or off base.
     4.18.2. Commanders coordinate with the proper civil law enforcement agency before moving gov-
     ernment vehicles or property that require special handling or exceed legal limits such as weight,
     length, width, or other standards.
     4.18.3. Installation commanders should maintain a close liaison with civil enforcement agencies and
     encourage the following:
        4.18.3.1. When possible, the prompt release of government vehicles and operators involved in
        accidents or incidents.
        4.18.3.2. Prompt notice to military authorities when military personnel or drivers of government
        motor vehicles are involved in traffic accidents or detained for serious violations of civil traffic
        laws.
        4.18.3.3. Prompt notice of any state, local, or host nation action to suspend, revoke, or restrict the
        driving privileges of personnel assigned to the installation.

4.19. Civil-Military Cooperative Programs.
     4.19.1. The State-Armed Forces Traffic Workshop Program is an organized effort to coordinate mili-
     tary and civil traffic safety activities throughout a state or area. Installation commanders should coop-
     erate and provide proper support and participation.
     4.19.2. The installation commander should establish a community-installation traffic workshop pro-
     gram to coordinate the installation traffic efforts with those of local communities. Sound and practical
     traffic planning depends on a balanced program of traffic enforcement, engineering, and education.
     Civilian and military legal and law enforcement officers, traffic engineers, safety officials, and public
     affairs officers should take part.

                   DRIVING RECORDS AND THE TRAFFIC POINT SYSTEM

5.1. Driving Records. Use SPAS or the AF Form 1313 to record vehicle traffic accidents, moving and
parking violations, suspension or revocation actions, and traffic point assessments involving military and
DoD civilian personnel, their family members, and other personnel operating motor vehicles on a military
installation. In filling out the form, use the following codes in the “accident classification” block:
   5.1.1. Identify individuals who are principals in a motor vehicle accident as “S” subject or “V” vic-
   tim.
   5.1.2. Identify accidents appropriately with “MVA” minor vehicle accident; “NLD” no liability deter-
   mined; “PD” property damage; “PI” personal injury; “G” government; “P” private; “V” vehicle; and
   “FO” fixed object.

Table 5.1. Suspension/Revocation of Driving Privileges (See Notes 1 and 2).
Assessment: 1. Two-year revocation is mandatory on determination of facts by installation
commander.

2. Commission of an offense in another state which, if committed on the installation, would establish
grounds for suspension or revocation.
3. Permitting an unlawful or fraudulent use of an official driver’s license.
4. Conviction of fleeing or attempting to elude a police officer.
5. Conviction of racing on the highway.
6. Excessive parking and other non-moving violations as covered under paragraph 2.5.1.1.
NOTES:
1. When imposing a suspension or revocation because of an off-installation offense, the effective date is
the same as the date of civil conviction or the suspension or revocation date of state or host nation driving
privileges. This effective date can be retroactive.
2. No points are assessed solely for revocation or suspension actions. Except for implied consent viola-
tions, base revocations on a conviction by a civilian court, military courts-martial, nonjudicial punishment
under Article 15 of the UCMJ, or a separate hearing as otherwise addressed in this instruction. If revoca-
tion for implied consent is combined with another revocation such as one year for intoxicated driving,
revocations may run consecutively (total of 24 months) or concurrently (total of 12 months). Apply the
installation commander’s policy systematically and not on a case-by-case basis.

5.2. The Traffic Point System. The traffic point system provides a uniform administrative device to
impartially judge service personnel's driving performance. This system is not a disciplinary measure or a
substitute for punitive action. Further, this system is not intended to interfere in any way with the reason-
able exercise of an installation commander’s prerogative to issue, suspend, revoke, deny, or reinstate
installation driving privileges.
5.2. (90SW) The Traffic Point System. Any non-use of occupant protective devices shall be enforced
as a primary traffic violation. This authorizes installation patrols to make a traffic stop based solely on the
failure of the operator or passengers to use available restraint system devices while moving per DOD
directive 6055.4, dated 20 July 1999.
     5.2.1. (Added-90SW) Child safety restraint system: No person shall operate a passenger vehicle in
     this state (or on this installation) unless each child who is a passenger in that vehicle and is 4 years of
     age or under and weighs 40 pounds or less, is properly secured in an approved child safety restraint
     system in the back seat of the vehicle, as equipped. Children between 41 and 80 pounds who are 4 to
     8 years of age are required to be secured with a seatbelt and seated in an approved booster seat in the
     back seat of the vehicle, as equipped. NOTE: Approved seats have a sticker stating that they conform
     to all applicable U.S. motor vehicle safety standards.

5.3. Point System Application. The use of the point system and procedures prescribed herein are man-
datory. The point system applies to civilian personnel operating government vehicles on and off the
installation and to their POVs driven on-base. It applies to military personnel operating GOVs and POVs
on or off the installation and to dependents, civilian employees, and all other individuals subject to this
instruction operating POVs on the installation. Unless an individual submits a rebuttal, assess points
according to the Table 5.2. Also assess points to individuals found guilty by a military or civilian court,
or upon payment of fine or forfeiture of pay and allowances, or posted bond or collateral. Do not use the
point system for non-moving violations.

instruments or to transmit simulated erroneous speed (prohibited on DoD installations).
Driver involved in accident is deemed responsible (only added to points assessed for 1
specific violations).
NOTES:
1. When two or more violations are committed on a single occasion, assess the points for the offense hav-
ing the greater value.
2. Use this measure for other than minor vehicle safety defects or when a driver or registrant fails to cor-
rect a minor defect (for example, a burned out headlight not replaced within the grace period on a warning
ticket).
3. Applies to not using or improper use of a child restraint device, i.e., car seat, infant carrier, booster seat,
belt/strap modification (when required by manufacturer) etc. Assess four points when no restraint system
of any kind is used.

5.4. Point System Procedures.
     5.4.1. Reports of moving traffic violations recorded on DD Form 1408 or DD Form 1805 will serve
     as a basis for determining point assessment.
     5.4.2. On receipt of DD Form 1408 or other military law enforcement report of a moving violation
     (e.g., AFI 3545) the unit commander or designated supervisor will conduct an inquiry. The com-
     mander will take or recommend proper disciplinary or administrative action.
        5.4.2.1. (Added-90SW) Unit commanders will forward the report of action on the reverse of the
        DD Form 1408, to 90 SFS/SFAR within 14 days.
     5.4.3. Distribute citation copies and process point assessments IAW para 4.9.
     5.4.4. Installation commanders may require the following driver improvement measures as appropri-
     ate:
        5.4.4.1. Advisory letter through the unit commander or supervisor to any person who has
        acquired six traffic points within a six-month period.
        5.4.4.2. Counseling or driver improvement interview by the unit commander of any person who
        acquires more than six points but less than 12 traffic points within a six-month period.
        5.4.4.3. Referral for medical evaluation when a driver, based on reasonable belief, appears to
        have mental or physical limits that had, or may have, an adverse effect on driving ability.
        5.4.4.4. Attendance at driver improvement program (DIP) to improve driving skill, awareness, or
        attitude.
        5.4.4.5. Referral to an alcohol or drug treatment or rehabilitation facility for evaluation, counsel-
        ing, or treatment. This action is required for active duty military personnel in all cases in which
        alcohol or other drugs are a contributing factor to a traffic citation, incident, or accident.
     5.4.5. The installation commander may suspend or revoke driving privileges as provided by this
     instruction regardless of whether these improvement measures are accomplished.
AFI31-204_90SWSUP1_I 20 FEBRUARY 2004                                                                      41


   5.4.6. Notify in writing anyone whose driving privileges are suspended or revoked (for one violation
   or an accumulation of 12 traffic points within 12 consecutive months, or 18 traffic points within 24
   consecutive months). Installation commanders determine suspension and revocation periods for
   offenses not covered in Table 5.1.; however, any revocation must be for a period of 6 months or more.
   The installation commander may impose a longer suspension or revocation period (to include offenses
   in Table 5.1.) based on the person’s overall driving record. Consider the frequency, flagrancy, and
   severity of moving violations, and the response to previous driver improvement measures. In all
   cases, military members must successfully complete a prescribed course in remedial driver training
   before reinstatement of driving privileges.
   5.4.7. Points assessed against a person remain in effect for point accumulation purposes for 24 con-
   secutive months. Routinely review driver records to delete traffic points during records update while
   recording new offenses and forwarding records to new duty stations. Completion of a revocation
   based on points requires removal from the driver record of all points assessed before the revocation.
   5.4.8. Removal of points does not authorize removal of driving record entries for moving violations,
   chargeable accidents, suspensions, or revocations. Recorded entries will remain posted on individual
   driving records for the period of time indicated below.
       5.4.8.1. Chargeable nonfatal traffic accidents or moving violations--three years.
       5.4.8.2. Nonmandatory suspensions or revocations--five years.
       5.4.8.3. Mandatory revocations--seven years.

5.5. Disposition of Driving Records. Establish procedures to promptly notify the CSP when a person
assigned to or employed on the installation is transferred to another installation, released from military
service, or ends employment or affiliation with the installation.
   5.5.1. If persons transferred to another Air Force installation have valid points or other entries on
   their driving records, the CSP must forward the records to the CSP of the gaining installation. The
   gaining CSP should coordinate with applicable commanders and continue any Air Force suspension
   or revocation based on intoxicated driving or accumulation of traffic points. Traffic points for persons
   transferred will continue to accumulate as specified in para 5.4.7.
   5.5.2. Follow AFI 37-138, Records Disposition--Procedures and Responsibilities, and AFMAN
   37-139, Records Disposition Schedule, to maintain and destroy records of military personnel released
   from active duty. Driving records remain active in the case of immediate reenlistment, change of
   officer component, or military and civilian retirement when continued vehicle registration is autho-
   rized. Retain or destroy according to AFMAN 37-139 records on civilian personnel who are terminat-
   ing on-base employment or on-base registration.
   5.5.3. Forward driving records of military family members containing point assessments or other
   entries to the sponsor’s gaining installation and review in the same manner as for service members.
   Retain driving records of retirees electing to retain installation driving privileges. Do not delete points
   accumulated or entries on the driver record regarding suspensions, revocations, moving violations, or
   chargeable accidents from the driver records except per para 5.4.7. and 5.4.8.

                                                  Chapter 6

                           IMPOUNDING PRIVATELY OWNED VEHICLES

6.1. General. This chapter provides the standards and procedures for law enforcement personnel when
towing, inventorying, searching, impounding, and disposing of POVs. This policy is based on:
     6.1.1. The interests of the Air Force in crime prevention, traffic safety, and the orderly flow of vehicle
     traffic movement.
     6.1.2. The vehicle owner's constitutional rights to due process, freedom from unreasonable search
     and seizure, and freedom from deprivation of private property.

6.2. Standards for Impoundment.
     6.2.1. You should not impound a vehicle unless it interferes with traffic, threatens public safety or
     convenience, is involved in criminal activity, contains evidence of criminal activity, or is stolen or
     abandoned.
     6.2.2. The impoundment of vehicles is inappropriate if other reasonable alternatives exist. When
     possible, attempt to locate the owner of the POV and have the vehicle removed. If reasonably feasi-
     ble, allow another responsible person to drive or tow the POV, if they first have permission from the
     owner, operator, or person empowered to control the vehicle. However in such cases, the security
     police (or towing contractor) is not responsible for safeguarding the vehicle.
     6.2.3. Impounding of POVs is justified when any of the following conditions exist:
        6.2.3.1. The vehicle is illegally parked:
            6.2.3.1.1. On a street or bridge, in a tunnel, or is double parked and interferes with the orderly
            flow of traffic.
            6.2.3.1.2. On a sidewalk, within an intersection, on a crosswalk, on a railroad track, in a fire
            lane, or is blocking a driveway so that the vehicle interferes with operations or creates a safety
            hazard to other roadway users or the general public.
            6.2.3.1.3. When blocking an emergency exit door of any public place.
            6.2.3.1.4. In a “tow-away” zone that is so marked with signs.
        6.2.3.2. The vehicle interferes with or is involved in one of the following:
            6.2.3.2.1. Street cleaning or snow removal operations after attempts to contact the owner fail.
            6.2.3.2.2. Emergency operations during a natural disaster, fire, or other emergency.
            6.2.3.2.3. The vehicle was used in a crime or contains evidence of criminal activity.
            6.2.3.2.4. The owner or person in charge of the vehicle is apprehended and therefore unable
            (or unwilling) to arrange removal of the vehicle.
            6.2.3.2.5. The POV is mechanically defective and is a menace to others using the public road-
            ways.
            6.2.3.2.6. The POV is disabled by a traffic accident and the operator is unavailable or physi-
            cally incapable of having the vehicle towed to a place of safety for storage or safekeeping.
AFI31-204_90SWSUP1_I 20 FEBRUARY 2004                                                                    43


          6.2.3.2.7. Law enforcement personnel reasonably believe the vehicle is abandoned.

6.3. Towing and Storage.
   6.3.1. The Air Force or a contracted wrecker service may tow and store impounded POVs depending
   on availability of towing services and the local commander’s preference.
   6.3.2. The installation commander designates a securable enclosed area on the installation for use as
   an impound lot. You may use an impoundment area belonging to a contracted wrecker service pro-
   vided the area is reasonably secure. The CSP approves contractor impoundment areas and maintains
   keys for all on-base impoundment areas.
   6.3.3. Impound or tow POVs for appropriate violations of the installation traffic code or involvement
   in criminal activities under the direct supervision of law enforcement personnel.

6.4. Procedures for Impoundment.
   6.4.1. Unattended POVs.
      6.4.1.1. Conspicuously place DD Form 2504, Abandoned Vehicle Notice (See DODD 5525.4),
      on POVs considered abandoned or improperly unattended. Document this action with an entry in
      the security police blotter.
      6.4.1.2. Allow the owner three days from the date the POV is tagged to remove the vehicle. Have
      the vehicle towed if it's not moved within the allotted time. If a contracted wrecker service is used,
      complete a DD Form 2505 according to local procedures.
      6.4.1.3. After the vehicle is removed, security police or the contractor completes the DD Form
      2506, Vehicle Impoundment Report (See DODD 5525.4), as a record of action taken.
          6.4.1.3.1. Law enforcement personnel or the towing contractor conduct an inventory listing
          personal property. Do not open closed containers such as a suitcase unless necessary to iden-
          tify the owner or if the contents might present a danger to the public. In most cases, listing the
          container and sealing it with security tape will suffice.
          6.4.1.3.2. Place personal property in a secure area for safekeeping.
      6.4.1.4. Forward DD Form 2507, Notice of Vehicle Impoundment (See DODD 5525.4), by cer-
      tified mail to the address of the last known owner of the vehicle to advise the owner of the
      impoundment action and request information concerning the owner’s intentions concerning the
      vehicle.
   6.4.2. Stolen POVs or vehicles involved in criminal activity.
      6.4.2.1. Keep vehicles in Air Force custody when holding them for evidentiary purposes. Release
      recovered stolen POVs to the registered owner, unless held for evidentiary purposes, or to the law
      enforcement agency reporting the vehicle stolen, as appropriate.
      6.4.2.2. At times, civilian law enforcement or civilian government agencies will request the Air
      Force impound an on-base vehicle for reasons not related to military issues. Staff such requests
      through the Staff Judge Advocate and CSP. When appropriate, comply and support such requests
      and impound the vehicle for a reasonable period. Release the vehicle if civil authorities do not
44                                                      AFI31-204_90SWSUP1_I 20 FEBRUARY 2004


        take custody of the vehicle within a reasonable period as determined by the installation com-
        mander.

6.5. Search Incident to Impoundment Based On Criminal Activity. Search of a POV in conjunction
with impoundment based on criminal activity will likely occur in one of the following general situations:
     6.5.1. The owner or operator is not present. This situation could arise during traffic and crime-related
     impoundments and abandoned vehicle seizures. Do not search the vehicle unless evidence or contra-
     band is in plain view or is readily discernible on the outside as evidence of criminal activity. When in
     doubt, obtain proper search authority before searching.
     6.5.2. The owner or operator is present. This situation can occur during a traffic or criminal incident
     or if the operator is apprehended for a crime or serious traffic violation and sufficient probable cause
     exists to seize the vehicle. In some cases, the operator is present but is unwilling, incapacitated, or
     otherwise unable to make adequate arrangements to safeguard the vehicle. As a general rule, you may
     search vehicles without search authority when there is a reasonable danger to police or public, there is
     a risk of loss or destruction of evidence, or the search is reasonable under rules governing search inci-
     dent to apprehension.

6.6. Disposition Of Vehicles After Impoundment.
     6.6.1. When a vehicle is impounded, hold it for as long as necessary for evidentiary, law enforcement,
     or other legal purposes. Unless directed otherwise by competent authority, release vehicles and prop-
     erty when no longer needed for one of the reasons stated above. Review Title 10, USC 2575, Dispo-
     sition of Unclaimed Property, and DoD Directive 4160.21-M, Defense Reutilization Marketing
     Manual, (when DRMO is used) before taking action to dispose of vehicles not claimed by the owner
     or an authorized agent.
     6.6.2. A vehicle is considered abandoned 60 days after making reasonable good faith efforts to con-
     tact the owner or when the owner is contacted and fails to take appropriate steps to assume responsi-
     bility for the vehicle. When owners decline to recover their vehicles, attempt to secure release of the
     vehicle by having the registered owners complete and sign the DD Form 2507. The 60-day waiting
     period does not apply when the owner releases the vehicle to the Air Force on DD Form 2507, signed
     letter, power of attorney, or other legally recognized document.
        6.6.2.1. Once the vehicle becomes the lawful possession of the Air Force, process the vehicle as
        abandoned property in accordance with local procedures. Unless otherwise directed, installation
        commanders have considerable latitude in determining the best use for, or disposal of, abandoned
        property. Scrap, auction, or use to support Morale, Welfare, and Recreation (MWR) activities are
        potential options. Consider local, state, or if applicable, host nation requirements. If you process
        vehicles through the Defense Reutilization Marketing Office (DRMO), follow applicable DRMO
        and DoD directives.
