SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This is the initial publication of ACCI 21-152. This instruction deletes ACCR 66-23 Engine
Conditioning and Monitoring Program (ECMP) and establishes policies and procedures to be
followed by applicable ACC units.

(SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) This document has been substantially revised and must be
completely reviewed.
1. Purpose.
     1.1. The Engine Trending & Diagnostic (ET&D) program is intended to further the safe
     operation, performance reliability, and lower maintenance operating costs of installed gas
     turbine engines. The program analyses trends in all available engine parameters to detect the
     onset of engine internal failures and shifts in instrumentation calibration or accuracy. When
     properly administered, this will be an effective management tool that allows maintenance
     personnel to take corrective actions before an engine failure or expensive secondary damage
     occurs.
     1.1. (SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) All references made in ACCI 21-152 to the Logistics
     Group (LG) will be handled by the MXG.
2. ACC Headquarters Responsibilities.
     2.1. The Directorate of Combat Weapon Systems, Systems Support Division, Propulsion
     Branch (HQ ACC/XRSP), is designated as the ACC office of primary responsibility (OPR)
     for this program. The OPR will:
        2.1.1. Establish a headquarters OPR for ET&D responsibilities.
        2.1.2. Participate in major ET&D conferences, meetings, and committees to identify and
        discuss relevant ET&D issues and policies.
        2.1.3. Identify specific requirements to assist the ET&D programs through all available
        technology channels and processes.
        2.1.4. Ensure Units operating ET&D programs have sufficient manning positions and
        appoint qualified, experienced persons as ET&D Project Managers at each operating
        base.

      2.1.5. Ensure owning units submit accurate and timely quality deficiency reports to the
      applicable engine program offices on all equipment requiring any maintenance activity
      due to an ET&D recommendation and on all ET&D component failures where no ET&D
      maintenance recommendation was made.
      2.1.6. Ensure that each unit provides timely and accurate metrics to the CEMS
      IV/CETADS database.
   2.2. In addition, ACC/XRSP is to:
