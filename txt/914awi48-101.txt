SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed.
1. Written Workplace Program. Each work area supervisor will develop and maintain a work
area/shop specific Hazardous Communication (HAZCOM) Written Workplace Program. The
program will include these elements:
   1.1. This instruction.
   1.2. AFI 90-821, Hazard Communication.
 2                                                             914AWI 48-101 18 JULY 2012


     1.3. A work area/shop-specific HAZCOM written program.
     1.4. The Work Area Hazardous Chemical Inventory.
        1.4.1. AF Form 3952, Chemical Hazardous Material Request Authorizations.
     1.5. A list of all routine and non-routine tasks involving hazardous materials, to include
     associated hazards and controls.
     1.6. Labels and other forms of warning.
     1.7. Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS).
2. Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS):
     2.1. Bioenvironmental Engineering Services (BES), building 207 will maintain the MSDS
     master file for hazardous chemicals used at the 914 AW. The master file consists of the
     Hazardous Material Information System (HMIS) on CD-Rom, the DOD HMIRS on-line
     (which is available to all employees by registering at www.dlis.dla.mil/hmirs/default.asp)
     and Manufacturer’s MSDS or equivalent forms.
     2.2. Supervisors will maintain, in the work area, a hard copy of the MSDS for each chemical
     product used in the work area. MSDS’s must be readily available to workers at all times.
     Workers desiring an explanation of an MSDS should contact their supervisor, or call BES.
     Supervisors will review all MSDS’s at a minimum annually, to ensure that each chemical
     product and each manufacturer has a separate and current MSDS.
     2.3. Supply or the Hazmart will furnish an MSDS with each issue of DOD managed
     materials when an MSDS is received from the source of supply.
     2.4. An MSDS must be obtained for each local purchase item considered by BES to be
     potentially hazardous or whose toxicity is not yet determined. All Government Purchase
     Card (GPC) purchases, AF Form 332, Work Order Requests, and AF Forms 2005,
     Issue/Turn-in Request, must be reviewed, approved and signed by the BES Program Manager
     before being submitted to supply or BOS purchasing. Contracting and BOS purchasing will
     request an MSDS for each local purchase item that is considered potentially hazardous. The
     supply receiving branch and BOS purchasing will not accept any local purchase item without
     an MSDS. Supply will furnish an MSDS with the item when it is issued. The work area
     supervisor will not accept any local purchase item into the work area without an MSDS.
3. Employee Information and Training:
     3.1. Unit commanders will ensure supervisors of work areas using hazardous materials
     receive training on the AF HAZCOM program containing all elements of the requirements in
     AFI 90-821. This training must be approved by the installation BES. BES will train
     supervisors. (Contact BES Public Health to schedule training).
     3.2. Supervisors will ensure subordinate workers are initially trained on the AF HAZCOM
     approved program containing the elements described above, before workers handle or
     become occupationally exposed to hazardous materials. Supervisors will include
     supplemental training for area/shop specific materials that pose a new hazard. Specific
     Hazard Communication training will be conducted upon initial work area assignment and
     whenever a new chemical/hazard is introduced into the work area.
914AWI 48-101 18 JULY 2012                                                                      3

      are present, and a list of these materials.
      3.3.3. Location and contents of the work area/shop specific written hazard
      communication program.
      3.3.4. Emergency procedures, such as recognition of a spill or release of hazardous
      material in the work area, by BES, visual appearance, odor, or alarm and escape
      procedures, locations of eye wash/showers and monitoring capabilities.
      3.3.5. Physical and health hazards associated with potential exposure to work area
      hazardous materials and non-routine tasks.
      3.3.6. Measures employees can take to protect themselves from the hazards associated
      with the hazardous materials used in the workplace, such as personal protective
      equipment, administrative controls, work practices and emergency procedures.
      Supervisors will refer to the BES work area survey reports for specific control
      requirements.
      3.3.7. Identification of relevant hazard categories associated with each chemical that is
      used, including, but not limited to, those with specific regulatory requirements (i.e. lead,
      asbestos, benzene, etc.)
      3.3.8. Explanation of the labeling system.
      3.3.9. Explanation of the Hazmart Program elements and procedures.
   3.4. Training will be documented on the individual’s AF Form 55, Employee Safety and
   Health Record, or other electronic record of training.
4. Hazardous Chemical Inventory:
   4.1. The hazardous chemical inventory will be developed by the work area supervisor and
   BES. This may be accomplished using the AF ESOH-MIS data base program.
   4.2. Supervisors will maintain the hazardous chemical inventory in the work area. The
   chemical inventory will be up-dated any time a product is added or deleted. When a new
   chemical is introduced into the work area, the supervisor will contact BES to determine if it
   should be added to the inventory. The supervisor will review the chemical inventory
   annually. Supervisors will submit a current chemical inventory including annual review
   documentation to BES whenever requested.
   4.3. BES will review the inventory at least annually.
   4.4. The chemical inventory will include the name of each product, name of the
   manufacturer, and the stock number as it appears on the MSDS. Proprietary information will
   not be included on the hazardous chemical inventory.
   4.5. The identity that is used on the MSDS must be cross-referenced to the inventory. The
   inventory may be maintained in the ESOH-MIS.
5. Contractor Operations:
 4                                                               914AWI 48-101 18 JULY 2012


     5.1. The Administrative Contracting Officer (ACO), with assistance from BES and the work
     area supervisor, if requested, will advise contractors of hazardous chemicals they may
     encounter and protective measures needed in the normal course of their work in the work
     area. The ACO will also inform the contractor that MSDS information is available through
     BES (building 207), and provide information on the labeling system.
     5.2. At the pre-performance conference and subsequently during the contract performance
     period, the requiring activity quality assurance evaluator will advise work area supervisors
     and Air Force employees monitoring the performance of contractors, of hazardous chemicals
     introduced by the contractor. The contractor is required to submit information on the use of
     hazardous materials, including usage data, according to FAR Clause’s 52.222-3, and
     5352.223.9002, Hazardous Materials Identification and Material Safety Data.
     5.3. The contracting officer will provide to BES all MSDS information, including usage data
     provided by the contractor.
6. Non-Routine Tasks Involving Hazardous Materials:
     6.1. Non-routine tasks are:
        6.1.1. Those tasks included within a work area’s normal activities but performed
        infrequently; for example, cleaning a solvent tank and changing the solvent, or cleaning
        up spills.
        6.1.2. Temporary duties outside an individual’s normal Air Force Specialty Code
        (AFSC), or job series.
     6.2. The work area supervisor will list all non-routine tasks performed in the work area
     which involve hazardous materials. The supervisor will ensure work area operating
     instructions thoroughly describe non-routine tasks, associated hazards and controls for the
     infrequent tasks performed in the work area. Operating instructions do not need to be
     prepared if Technical Orders (TOs) or other official documents adequately describe these
     tasks. Supervisors will ensure workers review these procedures before performing the non-
     routine tasks.
     6.3. When workers temporarily perform duties outside their normal jobs, the supervisor of
     the activity will ensure they receive the following training prior to beginning the activity:
        6.3.1. The initial Hazard Communication Training Program described in Paragraph
        2.7.2.1 of AFI 90-821, Hazard Communication, for workers not previously trained.
        6.3.2. Supplemental training, as required, on work area specific chemical hazards and
        associated controls.
        6.3.3. The supervisor of the activity will forward a letter to the worker’s formal
        supervisor describing the training conducted so the individual’s AF Form 55, Employee
        Safety and Health Record, or other electronic record of training can be updated.
7. Hazardous Waste Generation:
     7.1. If a product used in any work center results in the generation and accumulation of
     hazardous waste:
